The invention further relates to methods of using anti-CD22 antibodies and immunoconjugates thereof.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND\n\n\n \n \n \nLymphocytes are one of many types of white blood cells produced in the bone marrow during the process of hematopoiesis. There are two major populations of lymphocytes: B lymphocytes (B cells) and T lymphocytes (T cells). The lymphocytes of particular interest herein are B cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nB cells mature within the bone marrow and leave the marrow expressing an antigen-binding antibody on their cell surface. When a naive B cell first encounters the antigen for which its membrane-bound antibody is specific, the cell begins to divide rapidly and its progeny differentiate into memory B cells and effector cells called “plasma cells.” Memory B cells have a longer life span and continue to express membrane-bound antibody with the same specificity as the original parent cell. Plasma cells do not produce membrane-bound antibody but instead produce the antibody in a form that can be secreted. Secreted antibodies are the major effector molecule of humoral immunity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nB cell-related disorders include, but are not limited to, malignant lymphoma (Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, NHL), multiple myeloma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL, B cell leukemia (CD5+ B lymphocytes). Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs), a heterogeneous group of cancers principally arising from B lymphocytes, represent approximately 4% of all newly diagnosed cancers (Jemal, A. et al., CA-Cancer J Clin, 52: 23-47, (2002)). Aggressive NHL comprises approximately 30-40% of adult NHL (Harris, N. L. et al., Hematol. J. 1:53-66 (2001)) and includes diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), peripheral T-cell lymphoma, and anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Frontline combination chemotherapy cures less than half of the patients with aggressive NHL, and most patients eventually succumb to their disease (Fisher, R. I. Semin. Oncol. 27(suppl 12): 2-8 (2000)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nB cell-related disorders also include autoimmune diseases. Autoimmune diseases remain clinically important diseases in humans. As the name implies, autoimmune diseases act through the body's own immune system. While the pathological mechanisms differ among individual types of autoimmune diseases, one general mechanism involves the binding of certain antibodies (referred to herein as self-reactive antibodies or autoantibodies) to the body's endogenous proteins. Physicians and scientists have identified more than 70 clinically distinct autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, vasculitis, immune-mediated diabetes, and lupus such as systemic lupus erythematosus. While many autoimmune diseases are rare—affecting fewer than 200,000 individuals—collectively, these diseases afflict millions of Americans, an estimated five percent of the population, with women disproportionately affected by most diseases. The chronic nature of these diseases leads to an immense social and financial burden.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCytotoxic agents which target B cell surface antigens are an important focus of B cell-related cancer therapies. One such B cell surface antigen is CD20. Rituximab (Rituxan; Genentech, Inc. (South San Francisco, Calif.) and IDEC Pharmaceutical Corp. (San Diego, Calif.)), a chimeric (mouse/human) anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, was the first therapeutic antibody approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for treatment of relapsed or refractory low-grade or follicular NHL (Leonard, J. P. et al., Clin. Canc. Res. 10:5327-5334 (2004)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther B-cell antigens, such as CD19, CD22, and CD52, represent targets of therapeutic potential for treatment of lymphoma (Grillo-Lopez A. J. et al., Curr Pharm Biotechnol, 2:301-11, (2001)). CD22 is a 135-kDa B-cell-restricted sialoglycoprotein expressed on the B-cell surface only at the mature stages of differentiation (Dorken, B. et al., J. Immunol. 136:4470-4479 (1986)). The predominant form of CD22 in humans is CD22beta which contains seven immunoglobulin superfamily domains in the extracellular domain (\nFIG. 1\n) (Wilson, G. L. et al., J. Exp. Med. 173:137-146 (1991)). A variant form, CD22 alpha, lacks \nimmunoglobulin superfamily domains\n 3 and 4 (Stamenkovic, I. and Seed, B., Nature 345:74-77 (1990)). Ligand-binding to human CD22 has been shown to be associated with \nimmunoglobulin superfamily domains\n 1 and 2 (also referred to as \nepitopes\n 1 and 2) (Engel, P. et al., J. Exp. Med. 181:1581-1586, 1995).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn B-cell NHL, CD22 expression ranges from 91% to 99% in the aggressive and indolent populations, respectively (Cesano, A. et al., Blood 100:350a (2002)). CD22 may function both as a component of the B-cell activation complex (Sato, S. et al., Semin. Immunol. 10:287-296 (1998)) and as an adhesion molecule (Engel, Pl t al., J. Immunol. 150:4719-4732 (1993)). The B cells of CD22-deficient mice have a shorter life span and enhanced apoptosis, which suggests a key role of this antigen in B-cell survival (Otipoby, K. L. et al., Nature (Lond) 384:634-637 (1996)). After binding with its natural ligand(s) or antibodies, CD22 is rapidly internalized, providing a potent costimulatory signal in primary B cells and proapoptotic signals in neoplastic B cells (Sato, S. et al., Immunity 5:551-562 (1996)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-CD22 antibodies have been studied as potential therapies for B cell cancers and other B cell proliferative diseases. Such anti-CD22 antibodies include RFB4 Mansfield, E. et al., Blood 90:2020-2026 (1997)), CMC-544 (DiJoseph, J. F., Blood 103:1807-1814 (2004)) and LL2 (Pawlak-Byczkowska, E. J. et al., Cancer Res. 49:4568-4577 (1989)). The LL2 antibody (formerly called HPB-2) is an IgG2a mouse monoclonal antibody directed against the CD22 antigen (Pawlak-Byczkowska, E. J. et al. (1989), supra). In vitro immunohistological evaluations demonstrated reactivity of the LL2 antibody with 50 of 51 B-cell NHL specimens tested, but not with other malignancies or normal nonlymphoid tissues (Pawlak-Byczkowska (1989), supra; Stein, R. et al., Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 37:293-298 (1993)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe use of antibody-drug conjugates for the local delivery of cytotoxic or cytostatic agents, i.e. drugs to kill or inhibit tumor cells in the treatment of cancer (Syrigos and Epenetos (1999) Anticancer Research 19:605-614; Niculescu-Duvaz and Springer (1997) Adv. Drg Del. Rev. 26:151-172; U.S. Pat. No. 4,975,278) allows targeted delivery of the drug moiety to tumors, and intracellular accumulation therein, where systemic administration of these unconjugated drug agents may result in unacceptable levels of toxicity to normal cells as well as the tumor cells sought to be eliminated (Baldwin et al., (1986) Lancet pp. (Mar. 15, 1986):603-05; Thorpe, (1985) “Antibody Carriers Of Cytotoxic Agents In Cancer Therapy: A Review,” in Monoclonal Antibodies '84: Biological And Clinical Applications, A. Pinchera et al. (ed.s), pp. 475-506). Maximal efficacy with minimal toxicity is sought thereby. Both polyclonal antibodies and monoclonal antibodies have been reported as useful in these strategies (Rowland et al., (1986) Cancer Immunol. Immunother., 21:183-87). Drugs used in these methods include daunomycin, doxorubicin, methotrexate, and vindesine (Rowland et al., Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 21:183-87 (1986)). Toxins used in antibody-toxin conjugates include bacterial toxins such as diphtheria toxin, plant toxins such as ricin, small molecule toxins such as geldanamycin (Kerr et al (1997) Bioconjugate Chem. 8(6):781-784; Mandler et al (2000) Journal of the Nat. Cancer Inst. 92(19):1573-1581; Mandler et al (2000) Bioorganic & Med. Chem. Letters 10: 1025-1028; Mandler et al (2002) Bioconjugate Chem. 13:786-791), maytansinoids (EP 1391213; Liu et al., (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:8618-8623), and calicheamicin (Lode et al (1998) Cancer Res. 58:2928; Hinman et al (1993) Cancer Res. 53:3336-3342). The toxins may effect their cytotoxic and cytostatic effects by mechanisms including tubulin binding, DNA binding, or topoisomerase inhibition (Meyer, D. L. and Senter, P. D. “Recent Advances in Antibody Drug Conjugates for Cancer Therapy” in Annual Reports in Medicinal Chemistry, Vol 38 (2003) \nChapter\n 23, 229-237). Some cytotoxic drugs tend to be inactive or less active when conjugated to large antibodies or protein receptor ligands.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nZEVALIN® (ibritumomab tiuxetan, Biogen/Idec) is an antibody-radioisotope conjugate composed of a murine IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody directed against the CD20 antigen found on the surface of normal and malignant B lymphocytes and \n111\nIn or \n90\nY radioisotope bound by a thiourea linker-chelator (Wiseman et al (2000) Eur. Jour. Nucl. Med. 27(7):766-77; Wiseman et al (2002) Blood 99(12):4336-42; Witzig et al (2002) J. Clin. Oncol. 20(10):2453-63; Witzig et al (2002) J. Clin. Oncol. 20(15):3262-69). Although ZEVALIN has activity against B-cell non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL), administration results in severe and prolonged cytopenias in most patients. MYLOTARG™ (gemtuzumab ozogamicin, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals), an antibody drug conjugate composed of a hu CD33 antibody linked to calicheamicin, was approved in 2000 for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia by injection (Drugs of the Future (2000) 25(7):686; U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,970,198; 5,079,233; 5,585,089; 5,606,040; 5,693,762; 5,739,116; 5,767,285; 5,773,001). Cantuzumab mertansine (Immunogen, Inc.), an antibody drug conjugate composed of the huC242 antibody linked via the disulfide linker SPP to the maytansinoid drug moiety, DM1, is being developed for the treatment of cancers that express CanAg antigen, such as colon, pancreatic, gastric, and others. MLN-2704 (Millennium Pharm., BZL Biologics, Immunogen Inc.), an antibody drug conjugate composed of the anti-prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) monoclonal antibody linked to the maytansinoid drug moiety, DM1, is under development for the potential treatment of prostate tumors. The same maytansinoid drug moiety, DM1, was linked through a non-disulfide linker, SMCC, to a mouse murine monoclonal antibody, TA.1 (Chari et al. (1992) Cancer Research 52:127-131). This conjugate was reported to be 200-fold less potent than the corresponding disulfide linker conjugate. The SMCC linker was considered therein to be “noncleavable.”\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral short peptidic compounds have been isolated from the marine mollusk, \nDolabella auricularia\n, and found to have biological activity (Pettit et al (1993) Tetrahedron 49:9151; Nakamura et al (1995) Tetrahedron Letters 36:5059-5062; Sone et al (1995) Journal Org Chem. 60:4474). Analogs of these compounds have also been prepared, and some were found to have biological activity (for a review, see Pettit et al (1998) Anti-Cancer Drug Design 13:243-277). For example, auristatin E (U.S. Pat. No. 5,635,483) is a synthetic analogue of the marine \nnatural product Dolastatin\n 10, an agent that inhibits tubulin polymerization by binding to the same site on tubulin as the anticancer drug vincristine (G. R. Pettit, (1997) Prog. Chem. Org. Nat. Prod. 70:1-79). \nDolastatin\n 10, auristatin PE, and auristatin E are linear peptides having four amino acids, three of which are unique to the dolastatin class of compounds, and a C-terminal amide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe auristatin peptides, auristain E (AE) and monomethylauristatin (MMAE), synthetic analogs of dolastatin, were conjugated to: (i) chimeric monoclonal antibodies cBR96 (specific to Lewis Y on carcinomas); (ii) cAC10 which is specific to CD30 on hematological malignancies (Klussman, et al (2004), Bioconjugate Chemistry 15(4):765-773; Doronina et al (2003) Nature Biotechnology 21(7):778-784; “Monomethylvaline Compounds Capable of Conjugation to Ligands”; Francisco et al (2003) Blood 102(4): 1458-1465; \nUS\n 2004/0018194; (iii) anti-CD20 antibodies such as Rituxan® (rituximab) (WO 04/032828) for the treatment of CD20-expressing cancers and immune disorders; (iv) anti-EphB2 antibodies 2H9 and anti-IL-8 for treatment of colorectal cancer (Mao, et al (2004) Cancer Research 64(3):781-788); (v) E-selectin antibody (Bhaskar et al (2003) Cancer Res. 63:6387-6394); and (vi) other anti-CD30 antibodies (WO 03/043583). Monomethylauristatin (MMAE) has also been conjugated to 2H9, an antibody against EphB2R which is a \ntype\n 1 TM tyrosine kinase receptor with close homology between mouse and human, and is over-expressed in colorectal cancer cells (Mao et al (2004) Cancer Res. 64:781-788).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMonomethylauristatin MMAF, a variant of auristatin E (MMAE) with a phenylalanine at the C-terminus (U.S. Pat. No. 5,767,237; U.S. Pat. No. 6,124,431), has been reported to be less potent than MMAE, but more potent when conjugated to monoclonal antibodies (Senter et al, Proceedings of the American Association for Cancer Research, \nVolume\n 45, Abstract Number 623, presented Mar. 28, 2004). Auristatin F phenylene diamine (AFP); a phenylalanine variant of MMAE was linked to an anti-CD70 mAb, 1F6, through the C-terminus of 1F6 via a phenylene diamine spacer (Law et al, Proceedings of the American Association for Cancer Research, \nVolume\n 45, Abstract Number 625, presented Mar. 28, 2004).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-CD22 antibody-toxin conjugates have also been studied as potential therapeutic compounds. For example, early reports described ricin A chain-containing immunotoxins directed against anti-CD22 as potential anti-cancer agents (May, R. D. et al., Chemical Abstracts 106(21): 168656x pages 35-36 (1987); Ghetie, M. A. et al., Cancer Research 48:2610-2617 (1988); and Amlot, P. L. et al., Blood 82(9):2624-2633 (1993)). Where the toxin was a radioisotope, Epratuzumab, the humanized (CDR-grafted) IgG1 version of LL2, has shown evidence of therapeutic activity for the radioimmunoconjugate (Juweid, M. E. et al., Clin. Cancer Res. 5 (Suppl 10):3292s-3303s (1999); Griffiths, G. L. et al., J. Nucl. Med. 44:77-84 (2003); Linden, O. et al., Clin. Cancer Res. 5(suppl 10):3287s-3291s (1999)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere exists a need in the art for additional drugs to treat various B cell-related cancers such as lymphomas such as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and other B cell proliferative disorders. Particularly useful drugs for this purpose include B cell targeted anti-CD22 antibody-drug conjugates having a significantly lower toxicity, yet useful therapeutic efficiency.

In one embodiment, the method comprises determining the level of expression of CD22 on the surface of the test cell and comparing the level of expression of CD22 on the surface of the test cell with the level of expression of CD22 on the surface of the control cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, a method of diagnosing a cell proliferative disorder associated with an increase in cells, such as B cells, expressing CD22 is provided, the method comprising contacting a test cells in a biological sample with any of the above antibodies; determining the level of antibody bound to test cells in the sample by detecting binding of the antibody to CD22; and comparing the level of antibody bound to cells in a control sample, wherein the level of antibody bound is normalized to the number of CD22-expressing cells in the test and control samples, and wherein a higher level of antibody bound in the test sample as compared to the control sample indicates the presence of a cell proliferative disorder associated with cells expressing CD22.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, a method of detecting soluble CD22 in blood or serum, the method comprising contacting a test sample of blood or serum from a mammal suspected of experiencing a B cell proliferative disorder with an anti-CD22 antibody of the invention and detecting a increase in soluble CD22 in the test sample relative to a control sample of blood or serum from a normal mammal. In an embodiment, the method of detecting is useful as a method of diagnosing a B cell proliferative disorder associated with an increase in soluble CD22 in blood or serum of a mammal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the antibodies of the invention include cysteine engineered antibodies where one or more amino acids of a parent antibody are replaced with a free cysteine amino acid as disclosed in WO2006/034488 (herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). Any form of anti-CD22 antibody may be so engineered, i.e. mutated. For example, a parent Fab antibody fragment may be engineered to form a cysteine engineered Fab, referred to herein as “ThioFab.” Similarly, a parent monoclonal antibody may be engineered to form a “ThioMab.” It should be noted that a single site mutation yields a single engineered cysteine residue in a ThioFab, while a single site mutation yields two engineered cysteine residues in a ThioMab, due to the dimeric nature of the IgG antibody. The cysteine engineered anti-CD22 antibodies of the invention include monoclonal antibodies, humanized or chimeric monoclonal antibodies, and antigen-binding fragments of antibodies, fusion polypeptides and analogs that preferentially bind cell-associated CD22 polypeptides. A cysteine engineered antibody may alternatively comprise an antibody comprising a cysteine at a position disclosed herein in the antibody or Fab, resulting from the sequence design and/or selection of the antibody, without necessarily altering a parent antibody, such as by phage display antibody design and selection or through de novo design of light chain and/or heavy chain framework sequences and constant regions. A cysteine engineered antibody comprises one or more free cysteine amino acids having a thiol reactivity value in the ranges of 0.6 to 1.0; 0.7 to 1.0 or 0.8 to 1.0. A free cysteine amino acid is a cysteine residue which has been engineered into the parent antibody and is not part of a disulfide bridge. Cysteine engineered antibodies are useful for attachment of cytotoxic and/or imaging compounds at the site of the engineered cysteine through, for example, a maleimide or haloacetyl. The nucleophilic reactivity of the thiol functionality of a Cys residue to a maleimide group is about 1000 times higher compared to any other amino acid functionality in a protein, such as amino group of lysine residues or the N-terminal amino group. Thiol specific functionality in iodoacetyl and maleimide reagents may react with amine groups, but higher pH (>9.0) and longer reaction times are required (Garman, 1997, Non-Radioactive Labelling: A Practical Approach, Academic Press, London).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an embodiment, a cysteine engineered anti-CD22 antibody of the invention comprises an engineered cysteine at any one of the following positions, where the position is number according to Kabat et al. in the light chain (see Kabat et al (1991) Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md.) and according to EU numbering in the heavy chain (including the Fc region) (see Kabat et al. (1991), supra), wherein the light chain constant region depicted by underlining in \nFIG. 17A\n begins at position 108 (Kabat numbering) and the heavy chain constant region depicted by underling in \nFIGS. 17B and 17C\n begins at position 118 (EU numbering). The position may also be referred to by its position in sequential numbering of the amino acids of the full length light chain or heavy chain shown in \nFIGS. 17A-17C\n. According to one embodiment of the invention, an anti-CD22 antibody comprises an engineered cysteine at LC-V205C (Kabat number: Val 205; sequential number 210 in \nFIG. 17A\n engineered to be Cys at that position). The engineered cysteine in the light chain is shown in bold, double underlined text in \nFIG. 17A\n. According to one embodiment, an anti-CD22 antibody comprises an engineered cysteine at HC-A118C (EU number: Ala 118; sequential number 121 in \nFIG. 17B\n engineered to be Cys at that position). The engineered cysteine in the heavy chain is shown in bold, double underlined text in \nFIG. 17B\n. According to one embodiment, an anti-CD22 antibody comprises an engineered cysteine at Fc-S400C (EU number: \nSer\n 400; sequential number 403 in \nFIG. 17C\n engineered to be Cys at that position). The engineered cysteine in the Fc region of the heavy chain is shown in bold, double underlined text in \nFIG. 17C\n. In other embodiments, the engineered cysteine of the heavy chain (including the Fc region) is at any one of the following positions (according to EU numbering): 41, 88, 116, 118, 120, 171, 282, 375, or 400. Thus, changes in the amino acid at these positions for a parent anti-CD22 antibody of the invention are: A41C, A88C, S116C, A118C, T120C, A171C, V282C, S375C, or S400C. In other embodiments, the engineered cysteine of the light chain is at any one of the following positions (according to Kabat numbering): 15, 43, 110, 144, 168, 205. Thus, changes in the amino acid at these positions for a parent anti-CD22 antibody of the invention are: V15C, A43C, V110C, A144C, S168C, or V205C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA cysteine engineered anti-CD22 antibody comprises one or more free cysteine amino acids wherein the cysteine engineered anti-CD22 antibody binds to a CD22 polypeptide and is prepared by a process comprising replacing one or more amino acid residues of a parent anti-CD22 antibody by cysteine wherein the parent antibody comprises at least one HVR sequence selected from:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(a) an HVR-L1 sequence RSSQSIVHSNGNTFLE (SEQ ID NO:9) or sequence RSSQSIVHSVGNTFLE (SEQ ID NO:10) (\nFIG. 2B\n);\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(b) an HVR-L2 sequence KVSNRFS SEQ ID NO:12 (\nFIG. 2B\n);\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(c) an HVR-L3 sequence FQGSQFPYT (SEQ ID NO:14) (\nFIG. 2B\n);\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(d) an HVR-H1 sequence GYEFSRSWMN (SEQ ID NO:2) (\nFIG. 2A\n);\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(e) an HVR-H2 sequence GRIYPGDGDTNYSGKFKG (SEQ ID NO:4 (\nFIG. 2A\n); and\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(f) an HVR-H3 sequence DGSSWDWYFDV (SEQ ID NO:6) (\nFIG. 2A\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a certain aspect, the invention concerns a cysteine engineered anti-CD22 antibody, comprising an amino acid sequence having at least about 80% amino acid sequence identity, alternatively at least about 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100% amino acid sequence identity, to a cysteine engineered antibody having a full-length amino acid sequence as disclosed herein, or a cysteine engineered antibody amino acid sequence lacking the signal peptide as disclosed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a yet further aspect, the invention concerns an isolated cysteine engineered anti-CD22 antibody comprising an amino acid sequence that is encoded by a nucleotide sequence that hybridizes to the complement of a DNA molecule encoding (a) a cysteine engineered antibody having a full-length amino acid sequence as disclosed herein, (b) a cysteine engineered antibody amino acid sequence lacking the signal peptide as disclosed herein, (c) an extracellular domain of a transmembrane cysteine engineered antibody protein, with or without the signal peptide, as disclosed herein, (d) an amino acid sequence encoded by any of the nucleic acid sequences disclosed herein or (e) any other specifically defined fragment of a full-length cysteine engineered antibody amino acid sequence as disclosed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a specific aspect, the invention provides an isolated cysteine engineered anti-CD22 antibody without the N-terminal signal sequence and/or without the initiating methionine and is encoded by a nucleotide sequence that encodes such an amino acid sequence as described in. Processes for producing the same are also herein described, wherein those processes comprise culturing a host cell comprising a vector which comprises the appropriate encoding nucleic acid molecule under conditions suitable for expression of the cysteine engineered antibody and recovering the cysteine engineered antibody from the cell culture.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention provides an isolated cysteine engineered anti-CD22 antibody which is either transmembrane domain-deleted or transmembrane domain-inactivated. Processes for producing the same are also herein described, wherein those processes comprise culturing a host cell comprising a vector which comprises the appropriate encoding nucleic acid molecule under conditions suitable for expression of the cysteine engineered antibody and recovering the cysteine engineered antibody from the cell culture.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the invention provides isolated anti-CD22 chimeric cysteine engineered antibodies comprising any of the herein described cysteine engineered antibody fused to a heterologous (non-CD22) polypeptide. Example of such chimeric molecules comprise any of the herein described cysteine engineered antibodies fused to a heterologous polypeptide such as, for example, an epitope tag sequence or a Fc region of an immunoglobulin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cysteine engineered anti-CD22 antibody may be a monoclonal antibody, antibody fragment, chimeric antibody, humanized antibody, single-chain antibody or antibody that competitively inhibits the binding of an anti-CD22 polypeptide antibody to its respective antigenic epitope. Antibodies of the present invention may optionally be conjugated to a growth inhibitory agent or cytotoxic agent such as a toxin, including, for example, an auristatin, an antibiotic, a radioactive isotope, a nucleolytic enzyme, or the like. The antibodies of the present invention may optionally be produced in CHO cells or bacterial cells and preferably inhibit the growth or proliferation of or induce the death of a cell to which they bind. For diagnostic purposes, the antibodies of the present invention may be detectably labeled, attached to a solid support, or the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments of the present invention, the invention provides vectors comprising DNA encoding any of the herein described anti-CD22 antibodies and anti-CD22 cysteine engineered antibodies. Host cells comprising any such vector are also provided. By way of example, the host cells may be CHO cells, \nE. coli \ncells, or yeast cells. A process for producing any of the herein described polypeptides is further provided and comprises culturing host cells under conditions suitable for expression of the desired polypeptide and recovering the desired polypeptide from the cell culture.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCysteine engineered antibodies may be useful in the treatment of cancer and include antibodies specific for cell surface and transmembrane receptors, and tumor-associated antigens (TAA). Such antibodies may be used as naked antibodies (unconjugated to a drug or label moiety) or as antibody-drug conjugates (ADC). Cysteine engineered antibodies of the invention may be site-specifically and efficiently coupled with a thiol-reactive reagent. The thiol-reactive reagent may be a multifunctional linker reagent, a capture label reagent, a fluorophore reagent, or a drug-linker intermediate. The cysteine engineered antibody may be labeled with a detectable label, immobilized on a solid phase support and/or conjugated with a drug moiety. Thiol reactivity may be generalized to any antibody where substitution of amino acids with reactive cysteine amino acids may be made within the ranges in the light chain selected from amino acid ranges: L-10 to L-20; L-38 to L-48; L-105 to L-115; L-139 to L-149; L-163 to L-173; and within the ranges in the heavy chain selected from amino acid ranges: H-35 to H-45; H-83 to H-93; H-114 to H-127; and H-170 to H-184, and in the Fc region within the ranges selected from H-268 to H-291; H-319 to H-344; H-370 to H-380; and H-395 to H-405, where the numbering of amino acid positions begins at \nposition\n 1 of the Kabat numbering system (Kabat et al. (1991) Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md.) and continues sequentially thereafter as disclosed in WO2006034488. Thiol reactivity may also be generalized to certain domains of an antibody, such as the light chain constant domain (CL) and heavy chain constant domains, CH1, CH2 and CH3. Cysteine replacements resulting in thiol reactivity values of 0.6 and higher may be made in the heavy chain constant domains α, δ, ε, γ, and μ of intact antibodies: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, respectively, including the IgG subclasses: IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA, and IgA2. Such antibodies and their uses are disclosed in WO2006/034488.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCysteine engineered antibodies of the invention preferably retain the antigen binding capability of their wild type, parent antibody counterparts. Thus, cysteine engineered antibodies are capable of binding, preferably specifically, to antigens. Such antigens include, for example, tumor-associated antigens (TAA), cell surface receptor proteins and other cell surface molecules, transmembrane proteins, signalling proteins, cell survival regulatory factors, cell proliferation regulatory factors, molecules associated with (for e.g., known or suspected to contribute functionally to) tissue development or differentiation, lymphokines, cytokines, molecules involved in cell cycle regulation, molecules involved in vasculogenesis and molecules associated with (for e.g., known or suspected to contribute functionally to) angiogenesis. The tumor-associated antigen may be a cluster differentiation factor (i.e., a CD protein, including but not limited to CD22). Cysteine engineered anti-CD22 antibodies of the invention retain the antigen binding capability of their parent anti-CD22 antibody counterparts. Thus, cysteine engineered anti-CD22 antibodies of the invention are capable of binding, preferably specifically, to CD22 antigens including human anti-CD22 isoforms beta and/or alpha, including when such antigens are expressed on the surface of cells, including, without limitation, B cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn antibody of the invention may be conjugated to other thiol-reactive agents in which the reactive group is, for example, a maleimide, an iodoacetamide, a pyridyl disulfide, or other thiol-reactive conjugation partner (Haugland, 2003, Molecular Probes Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals, Molecular Probes, Inc.; Brinkley, 1992, Bioconjugate Chem. 3:2; Garman, 1997, Non-Radioactive Labelling: A Practical Approach, Academic Press, London; Means (1990) Bioconjugate Chem. 1:2; Hermanson, G. in Bioconjugate Techniques (1996) Academic Press, San Diego, pp. 40-55, 643-671). The partner may be a cytotoxic agent (e.g. a toxin such as doxorubicin or pertussis toxin), a fluorophore such as a fluorescent dye like fluorescein or rhodamine, a chelating agent for an imaging or radiotherapeutic metal, a peptidyl or non-peptidyl label or detection tag, or a clearance-modifying agent such as various isomers of polyethylene glycol, a peptide that binds to a third component, or another carbohydrate or lipophilic agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, antibodies of the invention may be conjugated with any label moiety which can be covalently attached to the antibody through a reactive moiety, an activated moiety, or a reactive cysteine thiol group (Singh et al (2002) Anal. Biochem. 304:147-15; Harlow E. and Lane, D. (1999) Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Springs Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.; Lundblad R. L. (1991) Chemical Reagents for Protein Modification, 2nd ed. CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla.). The attached label may function to: (i) provide a detectable signal; (ii) interact with a second label to modify the detectable signal provided by the first or second label, e.g. to give FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer); (iii) stabilize interactions or increase affinity of binding, with antigen or ligand; (iv) affect mobility, e.g. electrophoretic mobility or cell-permeability, by charge, hydrophobicity, shape, or other physical parameters, or (v) provide a capture moiety, to modulate ligand affinity, antibody/antigen binding, or ionic complexation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLabelled cysteine engineered antibodies may be useful in diagnostic assays, e.g., for detecting expression of an antigen of interest in specific cells, tissues, or serum. For diagnostic applications, the antibody will typically be labeled with a detectable moiety. Numerous labels are available which can be generally grouped into the following categories:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRadioisotopes (radionuclides), such as \n3\nH, \n11\nC, \n14\nC, \n18\nF, \n32\nP, \n35\nS, \n64\nCu, \n68\nGa, \n86\nY, \n99\nTc, \n111\nIn, \n123\nI, \n124\nI, \n125\nI, \n131\nI, \n133\nXe, \n177\nLu, \n211\nAt, or \n213\nBi. Radioisotope labelled antibodies are useful in receptor targeted imaging experiments. The antibody can be labeled with ligand reagents that bind, chelate or otherwise complex a radioisotope metal where the reagent is reactive with the engineered cysteine thiol of the antibody, using the techniques described in Current Protocols in Immunology, \n \nVolumes\n \n 1 and 2, Coligen et al, Ed. Wiley-Interscience, New York, N.Y., Pubs. (1991). Chelating ligands which may complex a metal ion include DOTA, DOTP, DOTMA, DTPA and TETA (Macrocyclics, Dallas, Tex.). Radionuclides can be targeted via complexation with the antibody-drug conjugates of the invention (Wu et al (2005) Nature Biotechnology 23(9): 1137-1146).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLinker reagents such as DOTA-maleimide (4-maleimidobutyramidobenzyl-DOTA) can be prepared by the reaction of aminobenzyl-DOTA with 4-maleimidobutyric acid (Fluka) activated with isopropylchloroformate (Aldrich), following the procedure of Axworthy et al (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97(4):1802-1807). DOTA-maleimide reagents react with the free cysteine amino acids of the cysteine engineered antibodies and provide a metal complexing ligand on the antibody (Lewis et al (1998) Bioconj. Chem. 9:72-86). Chelating linker labelling reagents such as DOTA-NHS (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid mono (N-hydroxysuccinimide ester) are commercially available (Macrocyclics, Dallas, Tex.). Receptor target imaging with radionuclide labelled antibodies can provide a marker of pathway activation by detection and quantitation of progressive accumulation of antibodies in tumor tissue (Albert et al (1998) Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 8:1207-1210). The conjugated radio-metals may remain intracellular following lysosomal degradation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMetal-chelate complexes suitable as antibody labels for imaging experiments are disclosed: U.S. Pat.

The fluorescent labels can be conjugated to antibodies using the techniques disclosed in Current Protocols in Immunology, supra, for example. Fluorescent dyes and fluorescent label reagents include those which are commercially available from Invitrogen/Molecular Probes (Eugene, Oreg.) and Pierce Biotechnology, Inc. (Rockford, Ill.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(c) Various enzyme-substrate labels are available or disclosed (U.S. Pat. No. 4,275,149). The enzyme generally catalyzes a chemical alteration of a chromogenic substrate that can be measured using various techniques. For example, the enzyme may catalyze a color change in a substrate, which can be measured spectrophotometrically. Alternatively, the enzyme may alter the fluorescence or chemiluminescence of the substrate. Techniques for quantifying a change in fluorescence are described above. The chemiluminescent substrate becomes electronically excited by a chemical reaction and may then emit light which can be measured (using a chemiluminometer, for example) or donates energy to a fluorescent acceptor. Examples of enzymatic labels include luciferases (e.g., firefly luciferase and bacterial luciferase; U.S. Pat. No. 4,737,456), luciferin, 2,3-dihydrophthalazinediones, malate dehydrogenase, urease, peroxidase such as horseradish peroxidase (HRP), alkaline phosphatase (AP), β-galactosidase, glucoamylase, lysozyme, saccharide oxidases (e.g., glucose oxidase, galactose oxidase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase), heterocyclic oxidases (such as uricase and xanthine oxidase), lactoperoxidase, microperoxidase, and the like. Techniques for conjugating enzymes to antibodies are described in O'Sullivan et al (1981) “Methods for the Preparation of Enzyme-Antibody Conjugates for use in Enzyme Immunoassay”, in Methods in Enzym. (ed J. Langone & H. Van Vunakis), Academic Press, New York, 73:147-166.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of enzyme-substrate combinations include, for example:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(i) Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) with hydrogen peroxidase as a substrate, wherein the hydrogen peroxidase oxidizes a dye precursor (e.g., orthophenylene diamine (OPD) or 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine hydrochloride (TMB));\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(ii) alkaline phosphatase (AP) with para-nitrophenyl phosphate as chromogenic substrate; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(iii) β-D-galactosidase (β-D-Gal) with a chromogenic substrate (e.g., p-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactosidase) or fluorogenic substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-D-galactosidase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNumerous other enzyme-substrate combinations are available to those skilled in the art. For a general review, see U.S. Pat. No. 4,275,149 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,318,980.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA label may be indirectly conjugated with an amino acid side chain, an activated amino acid side chain, a cysteine engineered antibody, and the like. For example, the antibody can be conjugated with biotin and any of the three broad categories of labels mentioned above can be conjugated with avidin or streptavidin, or vice versa. Biotin binds selectively to streptavidin and thus, the label can be conjugated with the antibody in this indirect manner. Alternatively, to achieve indirect conjugation of the label with the polypeptide variant, the polypeptide variant is conjugated with a small hapten (e.g., digoxin) and one of the different types of labels mentioned above is conjugated with an anti-hapten polypeptide variant (e.g., anti-digoxin antibody). Thus, indirect conjugation of the label with the polypeptide variant can be achieved (Hermanson, G. (1996) in Bioconjugate Techniques Academic Press, San Diego).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibody of the present invention may be employed in any known assay method, such as ELISA, competitive binding assays, direct and indirect sandwich assays, and immunoprecipitation assays (Zola, (1987) Monoclonal Antibodies: A Manual of Techniques, pp. 147-158, CRC Press, Inc.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA detection label may be useful for localizing, visualizing, and quantitating a binding or recognition event. The labelled antibodies of the invention can detect cell-surface receptors. Another use for detectably labelled antibodies is a method of bead-based immunocapture comprising conjugating a bead with a fluorescent labelled antibody and detecting a fluorescence signal upon binding of a ligand. Similar binding detection methodologies utilize the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect to measure and detect antibody-antigen interactions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDetection labels such as fluorescent dyes and chemiluminescent dyes (Briggs et al (1997) “Synthesis of Functionalised Fluorescent Dyes and Their Coupling to Amines and Amino Acids,” J. Chem. Soc., Perkin-Trans. 1:1051-1058) provide a detectable signal and are generally applicable for labelling antibodies, preferably with the following properties: (i) the labelled antibody should produce a very high signal with low background so that small quantities of antibodies can be sensitively detected in both cell-free and cell-based assays; and (ii) the labelled antibody should be photostable so that the fluorescent signal may be observed, monitored and recorded without significant photo bleaching. For applications involving cell surface binding of labelled antibody to membranes or cell surfaces, especially live cells, the labels preferably (iii) have good water-solubility to achieve effective conjugate concentration and detection sensitivity and (iv) are non-toxic to living cells so as not to disrupt the normal metabolic processes of the cells or cause premature cell death.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDirect quantification of cellular fluorescence intensity and enumeration of fluorescently labelled events, e.g. cell surface binding of peptide-dye conjugates may be conducted on an system (FMAT® 8100 HTS System, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.) that automates mix-and-read, non-radioactive assays with live cells or beads (Miraglia, “Homogeneous cell- and bead-based assays for high throughput screening using fluorometric microvolume assay technology”, (1999) J. of Biomolecular Screening 4:193-204). Uses of labelled antibodies also include cell surface receptor binding assays, immunocapture assays, fluorescence linked immunosorbent assays (FLISA), caspase-cleavage (Zheng, “Caspase-3 controls both cytoplasmic and nuclear events associated with Fas-mediated apoptosis in vivo”, (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95:618-23; U.S. Pat. No. 6,372,907), apoptosis (Vermes, “A novel assay for apoptosis. Flow cytometric detection of phosphatidylserine expression on early apoptotic cells using fluorescein labelled Annexin V” (1995) J. Immunol. Methods 184:39-51) and cytotoxicity assays. Fluorometric microvolume assay technology can be used to identify the up or down regulation by a molecule that is targeted to the cell surface (Swartzman, “A homogeneous and multiplexed immunoassay for high-throughput screening using fluorometric microvolume assay technology”, (1999) Anal. Biochem. 271:143-51).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLabelled antibodies of the invention are useful as imaging biomarkers and probes by the various methods and techniques of biomedical and molecular imaging such as: (i) MRI (magnetic resonance imaging); (ii) MicroCT (computerized tomography); (iii) SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography); (iv) PET (positron emission tomography) Chen et al (2004) Bioconjugate Chem. 15:41-49; (v) bioluminescence; (vi) fluorescence; and (vii) ultrasound. Immunoscintigraphy is an imaging procedure in which antibodies labeled with radioactive substances are administered to an animal or human patient and a picture is taken of sites in the body where the antibody localizes (U.S. Pat. No. 6,528,624). Imaging biomarkers may be objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacological responses to a therapeutic intervention. Biomarkers may be of several types: \nType\n 0 are natural history markers of a disease and correlate longitudinally with known clinical indices, e.g. MRI assessment of synovial inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis; Type I markers capture the effect of an intervention in accordance with a mechanism-of-action, even though the mechanism may not be associated with clinical outcome; Type II markers function as surrogate endpoints where the change in, or signal from, the biomarker predicts a clinical benefit to “validate” the targeted response, such as measured bone erosion in rheumatoid arthritis by CT. Imaging biomarkers thus can provide pharmacodynamic (PD) therapeutic information about: (i) expression of a target protein, (ii) binding of a therapeutic to the target protein, i.e. selectivity, and (iii) clearance and half-life pharmacokinetic data. Advantages of in vivo imaging biomarkers relative to lab-based biomarkers include: non-invasive treatment, quantifiable, whole body assessment, repetitive dosing and assessment, i.e. multiple time points, and potentially transferable effects from preclinical (small animal) to clinical (human) results. For some applications, bioimaging supplants or minimizes the number of animal experiments in preclinical studies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptide labelling methods are well known.

Reporter groups are typically fluorescent dyes that are excited by light at a certain wavelength and transfer energy to an acceptor, or quencher, group, with the appropriate Stokes shift for emission at maximal brightness. Fluorescent dyes include molecules with extended aromaticity, such as fluorescein and rhodamine, and their derivatives. The fluorescent reporter may be partially or significantly quenched by the quencher moiety in an intact peptide. Upon cleavage of the peptide by a peptidase or protease, a detectable increase in fluorescence may be measured (Knight, C. (1995) “Fluorimetric Assays of Proteolytic Enzymes”, Methods in Enzymology, Academic Press, 248:18-34).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe labelled antibodies of the invention may also be used as an affinity purification agent. In this process, the labelled antibody is immobilized on a solid phase such a Sephadex resin or filter paper, using methods well known in the art. The immobilized antibody is contacted with a sample containing the antigen to be purified, and thereafter the support is washed with a suitable solvent that will remove substantially all the material in the sample except the antigen to be purified, which is bound to the immobilized polypeptide variant. Finally, the support is washed with another suitable solvent, such as glycine buffer, pH 5.0, that will release the antigen from the polypeptide variant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLabelling reagents typically bear reactive functionality which may react (i) directly with a cysteine thiol of a cysteine engineered antibody to form the labelled antibody, (ii) with a linker reagent to form a linker-label intermediate, or (iii) with a linker antibody to form the labelled antibody. Reactive functionality of labelling reagents include: maleimide, haloacetyl, iodoacetamide succinimidyl ester (e.g. NHS, N-hydroxysuccinimide), isothiocyanate, sulfonyl chloride, 2,6-dichlorotriazinyl, pentafluorophenyl ester, and phosphoramidite, although other functional groups can also be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn exemplary reactive functional group is N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester (NHS) of a carboxyl group substituent of a detectable label, e.g. biotin or a fluorescent dye. The NHS ester of the label may be preformed, isolated, purified, and/or characterized, or it may be formed in situ and reacted with a nucleophilic group of an antibody. Typically, the carboxyl form of the label is activated by reacting with some combination of a carbodiimide reagent, e.g. dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, diisopropylcarbodiimide, or a uronium reagent, e.g. TSTU (O—(N-Succinimidyl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate, HBTU (O-benzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate), or HATU (O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate), an activator, such as 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt), and N-hydroxysuccinimide to give the NHS ester of the label. In some cases, the label and the antibody may be coupled by in situ activation of the label and reaction with the antibody to form the label-antibody conjugate in one step. Other activating and coupling reagents include TBTU (2-(1H-benzotriazo-1-yl)-1-1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate), TFFH (N,N′,N″,N′″-tetramethyluronium 2-fluoro-hexafluorophosphate), PyBOP (benzotriazole-1-yl-oxy-tris-pyrrolidino-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate, EEDQ (2-ethoxy-1-ethoxycarbonyl-1,2-dihydro-quinoline), DCC (dicyclohexylcarbodiimide); DIPCDI (diisopropylcarbodiimide), MSNT (1-(mesitylene-2-sulfonyl)-3-nitro-1H-1,2,4-triazole, and aryl sulfonyl halides, e.g. triisopropylbenzenesulfonyl chloride.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlbumin Binding Peptide-Fab Compounds of the Invention:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the antibody of the invention is fused to an albumin binding protein. Plasma-protein binding can be an effective means of improving the pharmacokinetic properties of short lived molecules. Albumin is the most abundant protein in plasma. Serum albumin binding peptides (ABP) can alter the pharmacodynamics of fused active domain proteins, including alteration of tissue uptake, penetration, and diffusion. These pharmacodynamic parameters can be modulated by specific selection of the appropriate serum albumin binding peptide sequence (US 20040001827). A series of albumin binding peptides were identified by phage display screening (Dennis et al. (2002) “Albumin Binding As A General Strategy For Improving The Pharmacokinetics Of Proteins” J Biol Chem. 277:35035-35043; WO 01/45746). Compounds of the invention include ABP sequences taught by: (i) Dennis et al (2002) J Biol Chem. 277:35035-35043 at Tables III and IV, page 35038; (ii) US 20040001827 at [0076] SEQ ID NOS: 9-22; and (iii) WO 01/45746 at pages 12-13, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. Albumin Binding (ABP)-Fabs are engineered by fusing an albumin binding peptide to the C-terminus of Fab heavy chain in 1:1 stoichiometric ratio (1 ABP/1 Fab). It was shown that association of these ABP-Fabs with albumin increased antibody half life by more than 25 fold in rabbits and mice. The above described reactive Cys residues can therefore be introduced in these ABP-Fabs and used for site-specific conjugation with cytotoxic drugs followed by in vivo animal studies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary albumin binding peptide sequences include, but are not limited to the amino acid sequences listed in SEQ ID NOS:42-46:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCDKTHTGGGSQRLMEDICLPRWGCLWEDDF\n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 42\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nQRLMEDICLPRWGCLWEDDF\n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 43\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nQRLIEDICLPRWGCLWEDDF\n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 44\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRLIEDICLPRWGCLWEDD\n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 45\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDICLPRWGCLW\n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 46\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody-Drug Conjugates\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides immunoconjugates, or antibody-drug conjugates (ADC), comprising an antibody conjugated to a cytotoxic agent such as a chemotherapeutic agent, a drug, a growth inhibitory agent, a toxin (e.g., an enzymatically active toxin of bacterial, fungal, plant, or animal origin, or fragments thereof), or a radioactive isotope (i.e., a radioconjugate). In another aspect, the invention further provides methods of using the immunoconjugates. In one aspect, an immunoconjugate comprises any of the above anti-CD22 antibodies covalently attached to a cytotoxic agent or a detectable agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe use of antibody-drug conjugates for the local delivery of cytotoxic or cytostatic agents, i.e. drugs to kill or inhibit tumor cells in the treatment of cancer (Syrigos and Epenetos (1999) Anticancer Research 19:605-614; Niculescu-Duvaz and Springer (1997) Adv. Drg Del. Rev. 26:151-172; U.S. Pat. No. 4,975,278) allows targeted delivery of the drug moiety to tumors, and intracellular accumulation therein, where systemic administration of these unconjugated drug agents may result in unacceptable levels of toxicity to normal cells as well as the tumor cells sought to be eliminated (Baldwin et al., (1986) Lancet pp. (Mar. 15, 1986):603-05; Thorpe, (1985) “Antibody Carriers Of Cytotoxic Agents In Cancer Therapy: A Review,” in Monoclonal Antibodies '84: Biological And Clinical Applications, A. Pinchera et al. (ed.s), pp. 475-506). Maximal efficacy with minimal toxicity is sought thereby. Both polyclonal antibodies and monoclonal antibodies have been reported as useful in these strategies (Rowland et al., (1986) Cancer Immunol. Immunother., 21:183-87). Drugs used in these methods include daunomycin, doxorubicin, methotrexate, and vindesine (Rowland et al., (1986) supra). Toxins used in antibody-toxin conjugates include bacterial toxins such as diphtheria toxin, plant toxins such as ricin, small molecule toxins such as geldanamycin (Mandler et al (2000) Jour. of the Nat. Cancer Inst. 92(19):1573-1581; Mandler et al (2000) Bioorganic & Med. Chem. Letters 10:1025-1028; Mandler et al (2002) Bioconjugate Chem. 13:786-791), maytansinoids (EP 1391213; Liu et al., (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:8618-8623), and calicheamicin (Lode et al (1998) Cancer Res. 58:2928; Hinman et al (1993) Cancer Res. 53:3336-3342). The toxins may effect their cytotoxic and cytostatic effects by mechanisms including tubulin binding, DNA binding, or topoisomerase inhibition. Some cytotoxic drugs tend to be inactive or less active when conjugated to large antibodies or protein receptor ligands.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nZEVALIN® (ibritumomab tiuxetan, Biogen/Idec) is an antibody-radioisotope conjugate composed of a murine IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody directed against the CD20 antigen found on the surface of normal and malignant B lymphocytes and \n111\nIn or \n90\nY radioisotope bound by a thiourea linker-chelator (Wiseman et al (2000) Eur. Jour. Nucl. Med. 27(7):766-77; Wiseman et al (2002) Blood 99(12):4336-42; Witzig et al (2002) J. Clin. Oncol. 20(10):2453-63; Witzig et al (2002) J. Clin. Oncol. 20(15):3262-69). Although ZEVALIN has activity against B-cell non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL), administration results in severe and prolonged cytopenias in most patients. MYLOTARG™ (gemtuzumab ozogamicin, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals), an antibody drug conjugate composed of a hu CD33 antibody linked to calicheamicin, was approved in 2000 for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia by injection (Drugs of the Future (2000) 25(7):686; U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,970,198; 5,079,233; 5,585,089; 5,606,040; 5,693,762; 5,739,116; 5,767,285; 5,773,001). Cantuzumab mertansine (Immunogen, Inc.), an antibody drug conjugate composed of the huC242 antibody linked via the disulfide linker SPP to the maytansinoid drug moiety, DM1, is advancing into Phase II trials for the treatment of cancers that express CanAg, such as colon, pancreatic, gastric, and others. MLN-2704 (Millennium Pharm., BZL Biologics, Immunogen Inc.), an antibody drug conjugate composed of the anti-prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) monoclonal antibody linked to the maytansinoid drug moiety, DM1, is under development for the potential treatment of prostate tumors. The auristatin peptides, auristatin E (AE) and monomethylauristatin (MMAE), synthetic analogs of dolastatin, were conjugated to chimeric monoclonal antibodies cBR96 (specific to Lewis Y on carcinomas) and cAC10 (specific to CD30 on hematological malignancies) (Doronina et al (2003) Nature Biotechnology 21(7):778-784) and are under therapeutic development.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChemotherapeutic agents useful in the generation of immunoconjugates are described herein. Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof that can be used include diphtheria A chain, nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin, exotoxin A chain (from \nPseudomonas aeruginosa\n), ricin A chain, abrin A chain, modeccin A chain, alpha-sarcin, \nAleurites fordii \nproteins, dianthin proteins, \nPhytolaca americana \nproteins (PAPI, PAPII, and PAP-S), momordica charantia inhibitor, curcin, crotin, sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor, gelonin, mitogellin, restrictocin, phenomycin, enomycin, and the tricothecenes. See, e.g., WO 93/21232 published Oct. 28, 1993. A variety of radionuclides are available for the production of radioconjugated antibodies. Examples include \n212\nBi, \n131\nI, \n131\nIn, \n90\nY, and \n186\nRe. Conjugates of the antibody and cytotoxic agent are made using a variety of bifunctional protein-coupling agents such as N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithiol) propionate (SPDP), iminothiolane (IT), bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters (such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl), active esters (such as disuccinimidyl suberate), aldehydes (such as glutaraldehyde), bis-azido compounds (such as bis(p-azidobenzoyl) hexanediamine), bis-diazonium derivatives (such as bis-(p-diazoniumbenzoyl)-ethylenediamine), diisocyanates (such as \ntoluene\n 2,6-diisocyanate), and bis-active fluorine compounds (such as 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene). For example, a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al (1987) Science, 238:1098. Carbon-14-labeled 1-isothiocyanatobenzyl-3-methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid (MX-DTPA) is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody (WO94/11026).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConjugates of an antibody and one or more small molecule toxins, such as a calicheamicin, maytansinoids, dolastatins, auristatins, a trichothecene, and CC1065, and the derivatives of these toxins that have toxin activity, are also contemplated herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMaytansine and Maytansinoids\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the immunoconjugate comprises an antibody (full length or fragments) of the invention conjugated to one or more maytansinoid molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMaytansinoids are mitototic inhibitors which act by inhibiting tubulin polymerization. Maytansine was first isolated from the east African shrub \nMaytenus serrata \n(U.S. Pat. No. 3,896,111). Subsequently, it was discovered that certain microbes also produce maytansinoids, such as maytansinol and C-3 maytansinol esters (U.S. Pat. No. 4,151,042). Synthetic maytansinol and derivatives and analogues thereof are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,137,230; 4,248,870; 4,256,746; 4,260,608; 4,265,814; 4,294,757; 4,307,016; 4,308,268; 4,308,269; 4,309,428; 4,313,946; 4,315,929; 4,317,821; 4,322,348; 4,331,598; 4,361,650; 4,364,866; 4,424,219; 4,450,254; 4,362,663; and 4,371,533.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMaytansinoid drug moieties are attractive drug moieties in antibody drug conjugates because they are: (i) relatively accessible to prepare by fermentation or chemical modification, derivatization of fermentation products, (ii) amenable to derivatization with functional groups suitable for conjugation through the non-disulfide linkers to antibodies, (iii) stable in plasma, and (iv) effective against a variety of tumor cell lines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMaytansine compounds suitable for use as maytansinoid drug moieties are well known in the art, and can be isolated from natural sources according to known methods, produced using genetic engineering techniques (see Yu et al (2002) PNAS 99:7968-7973), or maytansinol and maytansinol analogues prepared synthetically according to known methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary maytansinoid drug moieties include those having a modified aromatic ring, such as: C-19-dechloro (U.S. Pat. No. 4,256,746) (prepared by lithium aluminum hydride reduction of ansamytocin P2); C-20-hydroxy (or C-20-demethyl) +/−C-19-dechloro (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,361,650 and 4,307,016) (prepared by demethylation using \nStreptomyces \nor \nActinomyces \nor dechlorination using LAH); and C-20-demethoxy, C-20-acyloxy (—OCOR), +/−dechloro (U.S. Pat. No. 4,294,757) (prepared by acylation using acyl chlorides). and those having modifications at other positions\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary maytansinoid drug moieties also include those having modifications such as: C-9-SH (U.S. Pat.

No. 4,331,598); C-14-hydroxymethyl or acyloxymethyl (CH\n2\nOH or CH\n2\nOAc) (U.S. Pat. No. 4,450,254) (prepared from \nNocardia\n); C-15-hydroxy/acyloxy (U.S. Pat. No. 4,364,866) (prepared by the conversion of maytansinol by \nStreptomyces\n); C-15-methoxy (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,313,946 and 4,315,929) (isolated from \nTrewia nudlflora\n); C-18-N-demethyl (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,362,663 and 4,322,348) (prepared by the demethylation of maytansinol by \nStreptomyces\n); and 4,5-deoxy (U.S. Pat. No. 4,371,533) (prepared by the titanium trichloride/LAH reduction of maytansinol).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary embodiments of maytansinoid drug moieties include: DM1; DM3; and DM4, having the structures:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwherein the wavy line indicates the covalent attachment of the sulfur atom of the drug to a linker (L) of an antibody drug conjugate. HERCEPTIN® (trastuzumab, anti-HER2 antibody) linked by SMCC to DM1 has been reported (WO 2005/037992, which is expressly incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). An antibody drug conjugate of the present invention may be prepared according to the procedures disclosed therein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther exemplary maytansinoid antibody drug conjugates have the following structures and abbreviations, (wherein Ab is antibody and p is 1 to about 8):\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary antibody drug conjugates where DM1 is linked through a BMPEO linker to a thiol group of the antibody have the structure and abbreviation:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwhere Ab is antibody; n is 0, 1, or 2; and p is 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmunoconjugates containing maytansinoids, methods of making same, and their therapeutic use are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,208,020; 5,416,064; 6,441,163 and \nEuropean Patent EP\n 0 425 235 B1, the disclosures of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference. Liu et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:8618-8623 (1996) described immunoconjugates comprising a maytansinoid designated DM1 linked to the monoclonal antibody C242 directed against human colorectal cancer. The conjugate was found to be highly cytotoxic towards cultured colon cancer cells, and showed antitumor activity in an in vivo tumor growth assay. Chari et al., Cancer Research 52:127-131 (1992) describe immunoconjugates in which a maytansinoid was conjugated via a disulfide linker to the murine antibody A7 binding to an antigen on human colon cancer cell lines, or to another murine monoclonal antibody TA.1 that binds the HER-2/neu oncogene. The cytotoxicity of the TA.1-maytansonoid conjugate was tested in vitro on the human breast cancer cell line SK-BR-3, which expresses 3×10\n5 \nHER-2 surface antigens per cell. The drug conjugate achieved a degree of cytotoxicity similar to the free maytansinoid drug, which could be increased by increasing the number of maytansinoid molecules per antibody molecule. The A7-maytansinoid conjugate showed low systemic cytotoxicity in mice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-CD22 antibody-maytansinoid conjugates are prepared by chemically linking an antibody to a maytansinoid molecule without significantly diminishing the biological activity of either the antibody or the maytansinoid molecule. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,208,020 (the disclosure of which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference). An average of 3-4 maytansinoid molecules conjugated per antibody molecule has shown efficacy in enhancing cytotoxicity of target cells without negatively affecting the function or solubility of the antibody, although even one molecule of toxin/antibody would be expected to enhance cytotoxicity over the use of naked antibody. Maytansinoids are well known in the art and can be synthesized by known techniques or isolated from natural sources. Suitable maytansinoids are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,208,020 and in the other patents and nonpatent publications referred to hereinabove. Preferred maytansinoids are maytansinol and maytansinol analogues modified in the aromatic ring or at other positions of the maytansinol molecule, such as various maytansinol esters.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are many linking groups known in the art for making antibody-maytansinoid conjugates, including, for example, those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,208,020, 6,441,163, or \nEP Patent\n 0 425 235 B1, Chari et al., Cancer Research 52:127-131 (1992), and US 2005/0169933 A1, the disclosures of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference. Antibody-maytansinoid conjugates comprising the linker component SMCC may be prepared as disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/141,344, filed 31 May 2005, “Antibody Drug Conjugates and Methods”. The linking groups include disulfide groups, thioether groups, acid labile groups, photolabile groups, peptidase labile groups, or esterase labile groups, as disclosed in the above-identified patents. Additional linking groups are described and exemplified herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConjugates of the antibody and maytansinoid may be made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionate (SPDP), succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC), iminothiolane (IT), bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters (such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl), active esters (such as disuccinimidyl suberate), aldehydes (such as glutaraldehyde), bis-azido compounds (such as bis(p-azidobenzoyl) hexanediamine), bis-diazonium derivatives (such as bis-(p-diazoniumbenzoyl)-ethylenediamine), diisocyanates (such as \ntoluene\n 2,6-diisocyanate), and bis-active fluorine compounds (such as 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene). Particularly preferred coupling agents include N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionate (SPDP) (Carlsson et al., Biochem. J. 173:723-737 (1978)) and N-succinimidyl-4-(2-pyridylthio)pentanoate (SPP) to provide for a disulfide linkage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe linker may be attached to the maytansinoid molecule at various positions, depending on the type of the link. For example, an ester linkage may be formed by reaction with a hydroxyl group using conventional coupling techniques. The reaction may occur at the C-3 position having a hydroxyl group, the C-14 position modified with hydroxymethyl, the C-15 position modified with a hydroxyl group, and the C-20 position having a hydroxyl group. In a preferred embodiment, the linkage is formed at the C-3 position of maytansinol or a maytansinol analogue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, any of the antibodies of the invention (full length or fragment) is conjugated to one or more maytansinoid molecules. In one embodiment of the immunoconjugate, the cytotoxic agent D, is a maytansinoid DM1. In one embodiment of the immunoconjugate, the linker is SMCC. In one embodiment, the antibody-linker-drug conjugate is an anti-CD22 antibody as disclosed herein to which is covalently DM1 cytotoxic agent via the SMCC linker.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAuristatins and Dolostatins\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the immunoconjugate comprises an antibody of the invention conjugated to dolastatins or dolostatin peptidic analogs and derivatives, the auristatins (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,635,483; 5,780,588). Dolastatins and auristatins have been shown to interfere with microtubule dynamics, GTP hydrolysis, and nuclear and cellular division (Woyke et al (2001) Antimicrob. Agents and Chemother. 45(12):3580-3584) and have anticancer (U.S. Pat. No. 5,663,149) and antifungal activity (Pettit et al (1998) Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 42:2961-2965). The dolastatin or auristatin drug moiety may be attached to the antibody through the N (amino) terminus or the C (carboxyl) terminus of the peptidic drug moiety (WO 02/088172).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary auristatin embodiments include the N-terminus linked monomethylauristatin drug moieties DE and DF, disclosed in “Senter et al, Proceedings of the American Association for Cancer Research, \nVolume\n 45, Abstract Number 623, presented Mar. 28, 2004, the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn exemplary auristatin embodiment is MMAE (wherein the wavy line indicates the covalent attachment to a linker (L) of an antibody drug conjugate).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother exemplary auristatin embodiment is MMAF, wherein the wavy line indicates the covalent attachment to a linker (L) of an antibody drug conjugate (US 2005/0238649):\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional exemplary embodiments comprising MMAE or MMAF and various linker components (described further herein) have the following structures and abbreviations (wherein Ab means antibody and p is 1 to about 8):\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypically, peptide-based drug moieties can be prepared by forming a peptide bond between two or more amino acids and/or peptide fragments. Such peptide bonds can be prepared, for example, according to the liquid phase synthesis method (see E. Schröder and K. Lübke, “The Peptides”, \nvolume\n 1, pp 76-136, 1965, Academic Press) that is well known in the field of peptide chemistry. The auristatin/dolastatin drug moieties may be prepared according to the methods of: U.S. Pat. No. 5,635,483; U.S. Pat. No. 5,780,588; Pettit et al (1989) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 111:5463-5465; Pettit et al (1998) Anti-Cancer Drug Design 13:243-277; Pettit, G. R., et al. Synthesis, 1996, 719-725; Pettit et al (1996) J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1 5:859-863; and Doronina (2003) Nat Biotechnol 21(7):778-784.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCalicheamicin\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the immunoconjugate comprises an antibody of the invention conjugated to one or more calicheamicin molecules. The calicheamicin family of antibiotics are capable of producing double-stranded DNA breaks at sub-picomolar concentrations. For the preparation of conjugates of the calicheamicin family, see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,712,374, 5,714,586, 5,739,116, 5,767,285, 5,770,701, 5,770,710, 5,773,001, 5,877,296 (all to American Cyanamid Company). Structural analogues of calicheamicin which may be used include, but are not limited to, γ\n1\n \nI\n, α\n2\n \nI\n, α\n3\n \nI\n, N-acetyl-γ\n1\n \nI\n, PSAG and θ\nI\n \nl \n(Hinman et al., Cancer Research 53:3336-3342 (1993), Lode et al., Cancer Research 58:2925-2928 (1998) and the aforementioned U.S. patents to American Cyanamid). Another anti-tumor drug that the antibody can be conjugated is QFA which is an antifolate. Both calicheamicin and QFA have intracellular sites of action and do not readily cross the plasma membrane. Therefore, cellular uptake of these agents through antibody mediated internalization greatly enhances their cytotoxic effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther Cytotoxic Agents\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther antitumor agents that can be conjugated to the antibodies of the invention include BCNU, streptozoicin, vincristine and 5-fluorouracil, the family of agents known collectively LL-E33288 complex described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,053,394, 5,770,710, as well as esperamicins (U.S. Pat. No. 5,877,296).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof which can be used include diphtheria A chain, nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin, exotoxin A chain (from \nPseudomonas aeruginosa\n), ricin A chain, abrin A chain, modeccin A chain, alpha-sarcin, \nAleurites fordii \nproteins, dianthin proteins, \nPhytolaca americana \nproteins (PAPI, PAPII, and PAP-S), momordica charantia inhibitor, curcin, crotin, sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor, gelonin, mitogellin, restrictocin, phenomycin, enomycin and the tricothecenes. See, for example, WO 93/21232 published Oct. 28, 1993.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention further contemplates an immunoconjugate formed between an antibody and a compound with nucleolytic activity (e.g., a ribonuclease or a DNA endonuclease such as a deoxyribonuclease; DNase).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor selective destruction of the tumor, the antibody may comprise a highly radioactive atom. A variety of radioactive isotopes are available for the production of radioconjugated antibodies. Examples include At\n211\n, I\n131\n, I\n125\n, Y\n90\n, Re\n186\n, Re\n188\n, Sm\n153\n, Bi\n212\n, P\n32\n, Pb\n212 \nand radioactive isotopes of Lu. When the conjugate is used for detection, it may comprise a radioactive atom for scintigraphic studies, for example tc\n99m \nor I\n123\n, or a spin label for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging (also known as magnetic resonance imaging, mri), such as iodine-123 again, iodine-131, indium-111, fluorine-19, carbon-13, nitrogen-15, oxygen-17, gadolinium, manganese or iron.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe radio- or other labels may be incorporated in the conjugate in known ways. For example, the peptide may be biosynthesized or may be synthesized by chemical amino acid synthesis using suitable amino acid precursors involving, for example, fluorine-19 in place of hydrogen. Labels such as tc\n99m \nor I\n123\n, Re\n186\n, Re\n188 \nand In\n111 \ncan be attached via a cysteine residue in the peptide. Yttrium-90 can be attached via a lysine residue. The IODOGEN method (Fraker et al (1978) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 80: 49-57 can be used to incorporate iodine-123. “Monoclonal Antibodies in Immunoscintigraphy” (Chatal, CRC Press 1989) describes other methods in detail.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConjugates of the antibody and cytotoxic agent may be made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionate (SPDP), succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC), iminothiolane (IT), bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters (such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl), active esters (such as disuccinimidyl suberate), aldehydes (such as glutaraldehyde), bis-azido compounds (such as bis(p-azidobenzoyl) hexanediamine), bis-diazonium derivatives (such as bis-(p-diazoniumbenzoyl)-ethylenediamine), diisocyanates (such as \ntoluene\n 2,6-diisocyanate), and bis-active fluorine compounds (such as 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene). For example, a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al., Science 238:1098 (1987). Carbon-14-labeled 1-isothiocyanatobenzyl-3-methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid (MX-DTPA) is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See WO94/11026. The linker may be a “cleavable linker” facilitating release of the cytotoxic drug in the cell. For example, an acid-labile linker, peptidase-sensitive linker, photolabile linker, dimethyl linker or disulfide-containing linker (Chari et al., Cancer Research 52:127-131 (1992); U.S. Pat. No. 5,208,020) may be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention expressly contemplate, but are not limited to, ADC prepared with cross-linker reagents: BMPS, EMCS, GMBS, HBVS, LC-SMCC, MBS, MPBH, SBAP, SIA, SIAB, SMCC, SMPB, SMPH, sulfo-EMCS, sulfo-GMBS, sulfo-KMUS, sulfo-MBS, sulfo-SIAB, sulfo-SMCC, and sulfo-SMPB, and SVSB (succinimidyl-(4-vinylsulfone)benzoate) which are commercially available (e.g., from Pierce Biotechnology, Inc., Rockford, Ill., U.S.A). See pages 467-498, 2003-2004 Applications Handbook and Catalog.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreparation of Antibody Drug Conjugates:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the antibody drug conjugates (ADC) of the invention, an antibody (Ab) is conjugated to one or more drug moieties (D), e.g. about 1 to about 20 drug moieties per antibody, through a linker (L). The ADC of Formula I may be prepared by several routes, employing organic chemistry reactions, conditions, and reagents known to those skilled in the art, including: (1) reaction of a nucleophilic group of an antibody with a bivalent linker reagent, to form Ab-L, via a covalent bond, followed by reaction with a drug moiety D; and (2) reaction of a nucleophilic group of a drug moiety with a bivalent linker reagent, to form D-L, via a covalent bond, followed by reaction with the nucleophilic group of an antibody. Additional methods for preparing ADC are described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \nAb-(L-D)\np\n  Formula I\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe linker may be composed of one or more linker components. Exemplary linker components include 6-maleimidocaproyl (“MC”), maleimidopropanoyl (“MP”), valine-citrulline (“val-cit”), alanine-phenylalanine (“ala-phe”), p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl (“PAB”), N-Succinimidyl 4-(2-pyridylthio) pentanoate (“SPP”), N-Succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane-1 carboxylate (“SMCC”), and N-Succinimidyl (4-iodo-acetyl) aminobenzoate (“SIAB”). Additional linker components are known in the art and some are described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the linker may comprise amino acid residues. Exemplary amino acid linker components include a dipeptide, a tripeptide, a tetrapeptide or a pentapeptide. Exemplary dipeptides include: valine-citrulline (vc or val-cit), alanine-phenylalanine (af or ala-phe). Exemplary tripeptides include: glycine-valine-citrulline (gly-val-cit) and glycine-glycine-glycine (gly-gly-gly). Amino acid residues which comprise an amino acid linker component include those occurring naturally, as well as minor amino acids and non-naturally occurring amino acid analogs, such as citrulline. Amino acid linker components can be designed and optimized in their selectivity for enzymatic cleavage by a particular enzymes, for example, a tumor-associated protease, cathepsin B, C and D, or a plasmin protease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary linker component structures are shown below (wherein the wavy line indicates sites of covalent attachment to other components of the ADC):\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional exemplary linker components and abbreviations include (wherein the antibody (Ab) and linker are depicted, and p is 1 to about 8):\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleophilic groups on antibodies include, but are not limited to: (i) N-terminal amine groups, (ii) side chain amine groups, e.g. lysine, (iii) side chain thiol groups, e.g. cysteine, and (iv) sugar hydroxyl or amino groups where the antibody is glycosylated. Amine, thiol, and hydroxyl groups are nucleophilic and capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including: (i) active esters such as NHS esters, HOBt esters, haloformates, and acid halides; (ii) alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides; (iii) aldehydes, ketones, carboxyl, and maleimide groups. Certain antibodies have reducible interchain disulfides, i.e. cysteine bridges. Antibodies may be made reactive for conjugation with linker reagents by treatment with a reducing agent such as DTT (dithiothreitol). Each cysteine bridge will thus form, theoretically, two reactive thiol nucleophiles. Additional nucleophilic groups can be introduced into antibodies through the reaction of lysines with 2-iminothiolane (Traut's reagent) resulting in conversion of an amine into a thiol. Reactive thiol groups may be introduced into the antibody (or fragment thereof) by introducing one, two, three, four, or more cysteine residues (e.g., preparing mutant antibodies comprising one or more non-native cysteine amino acid residues).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody drug conjugates of the invention may also be produced by modification of the antibody to introduce electrophilic moieties, which can react with nucleophilic substituents on the linker reagent or drug. The sugars of glycosylated antibodies may be oxidized, e.g. with periodate oxidizing reagents, to form aldehyde or ketone groups which may react with the amine group of linker reagents or drug moieties. The resulting imine Schiff base groups may form a stable linkage, or may be reduced, e.g. by borohydride reagents to form stable amine linkages. In one embodiment, reaction of the carbohydrate portion of a glycosylated antibody with either glactose oxidase or sodium meta-periodate may yield carbonyl (aldehyde and ketone) groups in the protein that can react with appropriate groups on the drug (Hermanson, Bioconjugate Techniques). In another embodiment, proteins containing N-terminal serine or threonine residues can react with sodium meta-periodate, resulting in production of an aldehyde in place of the first amino acid (Geoghegan & Stroh, (1992) Bioconjugate Chem. 3:138-146; U.S. Pat. No. 5,362,852). Such aldehyde can be reacted with a drug moiety or linker nucleophile.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLikewise, nucleophilic groups on a drug moiety include, but are not limited to: amine, thiol, hydroxyl, hydrazide, oxime, hydrazine, thiosemicarbazone, hydrazine carboxylate, and arylhydrazide groups capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including: (i) active esters such as NHS esters, HOBt esters, haloformates, and acid halides; (ii) alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides; (iii) aldehydes, ketones, carboxyl, and maleimide groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another aspect, the antibody has one or more lysine residues that can be chemically modified to introduce one or more sulfhydryl groups. The antibody unit bonds to the Linker unit via the sulfhydryl group's sulfur atom. The reagents that can be used to modify lysines include, but are not limited to, N-succinimidyl S-acetylthioacetate (SATA) and 2-Iminothiolane hydrochloride (Traut's Reagent).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the antibody can have one or more carbohydrate groups that can be chemically modified to have one or more sulfhydryl groups. The antibody unit bonds to the Linker Unit, such as the Stretcher Unit, via the sulfhydryl group's sulfur atom, as disclosed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment, the antibody can have one or more carbohydrate groups that can be oxidized to provide an aldehyde (—CHO) group (see, for e.g., Laguzza, et al., J. Med. Chem. 1989, 32(3), 548-55). The corresponding aldehyde can form a bond with a Reactive Site on a Stretcher. Reactive sites on a Stretcher that can react with a carbonyl group on an antibody include, but are not limited to, hydrazine and hydroxylamine. Other protocols for the modification of proteins for the attachment or association of Drug Units are described in Coligan et al., Current Protocols in Protein Science, vol. 2, John Wiley & Sons (2002), incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for the conjugation of linker-drug moieties to cell-targeted proteins such as antibodies, immunoglobulins or fragments thereof are found, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,208,020; U.S. Pat. No. 6,441,163; WO2005037992; WO2005081711; and WO2006/034488, all of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference in their entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, a fusion protein comprising the antibody and cytotoxic agent may be made, e.g., by recombinant techniques or peptide synthesis. The length of DNA may comprise respective regions encoding the two portions of the conjugate either adjacent one another or separated by a region encoding a linker peptide which does not destroy the desired properties of the conjugate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment, the antibody may be conjugated to a “receptor” (such streptavidin) for utilization in tumor pre-targeting wherein the antibody-receptor conjugate is administered to the patient, followed by removal of unbound conjugate from the circulation using a clearing agent and then administration of a “ligand” (e.g., avidin) which is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent (e.g., a radionucleotide).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the immunoconjugate, the cytotoxic agent, D, is an auristatin of formula D\nE \nor D\nF\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nand wherein R\n2 \nand R\n6 \nare each methyl, R\n3 \nand R\n4 \nare each isopropyl, R\n7 \nis sec-butyl, each R\n8 \nis independently selected from CH\n3\n, O—CH\n3\n, OH, and H; R\n9 \nis H; R\n10 \nis aryl; Z is —O— or —NH—; R\n11 \nis H, C\n1\n-C\n8 \nalkyl, or —(CH\n2\n)\n2\n—O—(CH\n2\n)\n2\n—O—(CH\n2\n)\n2\n—O—CH\n3\n; and R\n18 \nis —C(R\n8\n)\n2\n—C(R\n8\n)\n2\n-aryl; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(d) p ranges from about 1 to 8.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following embodiments are further provided for any of the above immunoconjugates.

Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials which would interfere with research, diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. In some embodiments, an antibody is purified (1) to greater than 95% by weight of antibody as determined by, for example, the Lowry method, and in some embodiments, to greater than 99% by weight; (2) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of, for example, a spinning cup sequenator, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions using, for example, Coomassie blue or silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody's natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily, however, isolated antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “isolated” nucleic acid molecule is a nucleic acid molecule that is separated from at least one other nucleic acid molecule with which it is ordinarily associated, for example, in its natural environment. An isolated nucleic acid molecule further includes a nucleic acid molecule contained in cells that ordinarily express the nucleic acid molecule, but the nucleic acid molecule is present extrachromosomally or at a chromosomal location that is different from its natural chromosomal location.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Purified” means that a molecule is present in a sample at a concentration of at least 95% by weight, or at least 98% by weight of the sample in which it is contained.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “substantially similar” or “substantially the same,” as used herein, denotes a sufficiently high degree of similarity between two numeric values (for example, one associated with an antibody of the invention and the other associated with a reference/comparator antibody), such that one of skill in the art would consider the difference between the two values to be of little or no biological and/or statistical significance within the context of the biological characteristic measured by said values (e.g., Kd values). The difference between said two values is, for example, less than about 50%, less than about 40%, less than about 30%, less than about 20%, and/or less than about 10% as a function of the reference/comparator value.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase “substantially reduced,” or “substantially different,” as used herein, denotes a sufficiently high degree of difference between two numeric values (generally one associated with a molecule and the other associated with a reference/comparator molecule) such that one of skill in the art would consider the difference between the two values to be of statistical significance within the context of the biological characteristic measured by said values (e.g., Kd values). The difference between said two values is, for example, greater than about 10%, greater than about 20%, greater than about 30%, greater than about 40%, and/or greater than about 50% as a function of the value for the reference/comparator molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “vector,” as used herein, is intended to refer to a nucleic acid molecule capable of transporting another nucleic acid to which it has been linked. One type of vector is a “plasmid,” which refers to a circular double stranded DNA into which additional DNA segments may be ligated. Another type of vector is a phage vector. Another type of vector is a viral vector, wherein additional DNA segments may be ligated into the viral genome. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into which they are introduced (e.g., bacterial vectors having a bacterial origin of replication and episomal mammalian vectors). Other vectors (e.g., non-episomal mammalian vectors) can be integrated into the genome of a host cell upon introduction into the host cell, and thereby are replicated along with the host genome. Moreover, certain vectors are capable of directing the expression of genes to which they are operatively linked. Such vectors are referred to herein as “recombinant expression vectors,” or simply, “expression vectors.” In general, expression vectors of utility in recombinant DNA techniques are often in the form of plasmids. In the present specification, “plasmid” and “vector” may be used interchangeably as the plasmid is the most commonly used form of vector.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Polynucleotide,” or “nucleic acid,” as used interchangeably herein, refer to polymers of nucleotides of any length, and include DNA and RNA. The nucleotides can be deoxyribonucleotides, ribonucleotides, modified nucleotides or bases, and/or their analogs, or any substrate that can be incorporated into a polymer by DNA or RNA polymerase or by a synthetic reaction. A polynucleotide may comprise modified nucleotides, such as methylated nucleotides and their analogs. If present, modification to the nucleotide structure may be imparted before or after assembly of the polymer. The sequence of nucleotides may be interrupted by non-nucleotide components. A polynucleotide may comprise modification(s) made after synthesis, such as conjugation to a label. Other types of modifications include, for example, “caps,” substitution of one or more of the naturally occurring nucleotides with an analog, internucleotide modifications such as, for example, those with uncharged linkages (e.g., methyl phosphonates, phosphotriesters, phosphoamidates, carbamates, etc.) and with charged linkages (e.g., phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates, etc.), those containing pendant moieties, such as, for example, proteins (e.g., nucleases, toxins, antibodies, signal peptides, ply-L-lysine, etc.), those with intercalators (e.g., acridine, psoralen, etc.), those containing chelators (e.g., metals, radioactive metals, boron, oxidative metals, etc.), those containing alkylators, those with modified linkages (e.g., alpha anomeric nucleic acids, etc.), as well as unmodified forms of the polynucleotides(s). Further, any of the hydroxyl groups ordinarily present in the sugars may be replaced, for example, by phosphonate groups, phosphate groups, protected by standard protecting groups, or activated to prepare additional linkages to additional nucleotides, or may be conjugated to solid or semi-solid supports. The 5′ and 3′ terminal OH can be phosphorylated or substituted with amines or organic capping group moieties of from 1 to 20 carbon atoms. Other hydroxyls may also be derivatized to standard protecting groups. Polynucleotides can also contain analogous forms of ribose or deoxyribose sugars that are generally known in the art, including, for example, 2′-O-methyl-, 2′-O-allyl-, 2′-fluoro- or 2′-azido-ribose, carbocyclic sugar analogs, α-anomeric sugars, epimeric sugars such as arabinose, xyloses or lyxoses, pyranose sugars, furanose sugars, sedoheptuloses, acyclic analogs, and basic nucleoside analogs such as methyl riboside. One or more phosphodiester linkages may be replaced by alternative linking groups. These alternative linking groups include, but are not limited to, embodiments wherein phosphate is replaced by P(O)S (“thioate”), P(S)S (“dithioate”), (O)NR\n2 \n(“amidate”), P(O)R, P(O)OR′, CO, or CH2 (“formacetal”), in which each R or R′ is independently H or substituted or unsubstituted alkyl (1-20 C) optionally containing an ether (—O—) linkage, aryl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl or araldyl. Not all linkages in a polynucleotide need be identical. The preceding description applies to all polynucleotides referred to herein, including RNA and DNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Oligonucleotide,” as used herein, generally refers to short, generally single-stranded, generally synthetic polynucleotides that are generally, but not necessarily, less than about 200 nucleotides in length. The terms “oligonucleotide” and “polynucleotide” are not mutually exclusive. The description above for polynucleotides is equally and fully applicable to oligonucleotides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Percent (%) amino acid sequence identity” with respect to a reference polypeptide sequence is defined as the percentage of amino acid residues in a candidate sequence that are identical with the amino acid residues in the reference polypeptide sequence, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity, and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity. Alignment for purposes of determining percent amino acid sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art, for instance, using publicly available computer software such as BLAST, BLAST-2, ALIGN or Megalign (DNASTAR) software. Those skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters for aligning sequences, including any algorithms needed to achieve maximal alignment over the full length of the sequences being compared. For purposes herein, however, % amino acid sequence identity values are generated using the sequence comparison computer program ALIGN-2. The ALIGN-2 sequence comparison computer program was authored by Genentech, Inc., and the source code has been filed with user documentation in the U.S. Copyright Office, Washington D.C., 20559, where it is registered under U.S. Copyright Registration No. TXU510087. The ALIGN-2 program is publicly available from Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, Calif., or may be compiled from the source code. The ALIGN-2 program should be compiled for use on a UNIX operating system, preferably digital UNIX V4.0D. All sequence comparison parameters are set by the ALIGN-2 program and do not vary.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn situations where ALIGN-2 is employed for amino acid sequence comparisons, the % amino acid sequence identity of a given amino acid sequence A to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B (which can alternatively be phrased as a given amino acid sequence A that has or comprises a certain % amino acid sequence identity to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B) is calculated as follows:\n\n\n \n \n \n100 times the fraction X/Y\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwhere X is the number of amino acid residues scored as identical matches by the sequence alignment program ALIGN-2 in that program's alignment of A and B, and where Y is the total number of amino acid residues in B. It will be appreciated that where the length of amino acid sequence A is not equal to the length of amino acid sequence B, the % amino acid sequence identity of A to B will not equal the % amino acid sequence identity of B to A. Unless specifically stated otherwise, all % amino acid sequence identity values used herein are obtained as described in the immediately preceding paragraph using the ALIGN-2 computer program.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “B-cell surface marker” or “B-cell surface antigen” herein is an antigen expressed on the surface of a B cell that can be targeted with an antagonist that binds thereto, including but not limited to, antibodies to a B-cell surface antigen or a soluble form a B-cell surface antigen capable of antagonizing binding of a ligand to the naturally occurring B-cell antigen. Exemplary B-cell surface markers include the CD10, CD19, CD20, CD21, CD22, CD23, CD24, CD37, CD40, CD53, CD72, CD73, CD74, CDw75, CDw76, CD77, CDw78, CD79a, CD79b, CD80, CD81, CD82, CD83, CDw84, CD85 and CD86 leukocyte surface markers (for descriptions, see The Leukocyte Antigen Facts Book, 2\nnd \nEdition. 1997, ed. Barclay et al. Academic Press, Harcourt Brace & Co., New York). Other B-cell surface markers include RP105, FcRH2, B-cell CR2, CCR6, P2X5, HLA-DOB, CXCR5, FCER2, BR3, BAFF, BLyS, Btig, NAG14, SLGC16270, FcRH1, IRTA2, ATWD578, FcRH3, IRTA1, FcRH6, BCMA, and 239287. The B-cell surface marker of particular interest is preferentially expressed on B cells compared to other non-B-cell tissues of a mammal and may be expressed on both precursor B cells and mature B cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “CD22,” as used herein, refers to any native CD22 from any vertebrate source, including mammals such as primates (e.g. humans, cynomolgus monkey (cyno)) and rodents (e.g., mice and rats), unless otherwise indicated. The term encompasses “full-length,” unprocessed CD22 as well as any form of CD22 that results from processing in the cell. The term also encompasses naturally occurring variants of CD22, e.g., splice variants, allelic variants, and isoforms. The major isoform of CD22 (CD22beta) comprises 847 amino acids and seven immunoglobulin-like regions in the extracellular domain (see Wilson, G. L. et al., J. Exp. Med. 173:137-146 (1991)). A minor isoform, CD22alpha, comprises 647 amino acids and lacks immunoglobulin-\n \nlike domains\n \n 3 and 4 in the extracellular domain (see Stamenkovic, I. and Seed, B., Nature 345:74-77 (1990)) and Wilson et al. (1991), supra). The amino acid sequence of CD22 beta is depicted in \nFIG. 1B\n in which the underlined portion is the extracellular domain (ECD) and the italicized portion indicates the amino acids missing from the CD22 alpha extracellular domain sequence. \nFIG. 1C\n depicts the amino acid sequence of CD22alpha in which the ECD is underlined. The amino acid sequence from \namino acid\n 1 to \namino acid\n 21 represents the signal sequence cleaved from the mature form of the protein. In one embodiment, CD22 is expressed on the cell surface, such as on the surface of a normal B cell or a tumor B cell. \nFIG. 1D\n depicts the amino acid sequence of CD22 from cynomolgus monkey.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Antibodies” (Abs) and “immunoglobulins” (Igs) are glycoproteins having similar structural characteristics. While antibodies exhibit binding specificity to a specific antigen, immunoglobulins include both antibodies and other antibody-like molecules which generally lack antigen specificity. Polypeptides of the latter kind are, for example, produced at low levels by the lymph system and at increased levels by myelomas.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “antibody” and “immunoglobulin” are used interchangeably in the broadest sense and include monoclonal antibodies (e.g., full length or intact monoclonal antibodies), polyclonal antibodies, monovalent antibodies, multivalent antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity) and may also include certain antibody fragments (as described in greater detail herein). An antibody can be chimeric, human, humanized and/or affinity matured.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “anti-CD22 antibody” or “an antibody that binds to CD22” refers to an antibody that is capable of binding CD22 with sufficient affinity such that the antibody is useful as a diagnostic and/or therapeutic agent in targeting CD22. Preferably, the extent of binding of an anti-CD22 antibody to an unrelated, non-CD22 protein is less than about 10% of the binding of the antibody to CD22 as measured, e.g., by a radioimmunoassay (RIA). In certain embodiments, an antibody that binds to CD22 has a dissociation constant (Kd) of ≦1 μM, ≦100 nM, ≦10 nM, ≦1 nM, or ≦0.1 nM. In certain embodiments, an anti-CD22 antibody binds to an epitope of CD22 that is conserved among CD22 from different species.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe “variable region” or “variable domain” of an antibody refers to the amino-terminal domains of the heavy or light chain of the antibody. The variable domain of the heavy chain may be referred to as “VH.” The variable domain of the light chain may be referred to as “VL.” These domains are generally the most variable parts of an antibody and contain the antigen-binding sites.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “variable” refers to the fact that certain portions of the variable domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies and are used in the binding and specificity of each particular antibody for its particular antigen. However, the variability is not evenly distributed throughout the variable domains of antibodies. It is concentrated in three segments called complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) or hypervariable regions (HVRs) both in the light-chain and the heavy-chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of variable domains are called the framework regions (FR). The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FR regions, largely adopting a beta-sheet configuration, connected by three CDRs, which form loops connecting, and in some cases forming part of, the beta-sheet structure. The CDRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FR regions and, with the CDRs from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen-binding site of antibodies (see Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991)). The constant domains are not involved directly in the binding of an antibody to an antigen, but exhibit various effector functions, such as participation of the antibody in antibody-dependent cellular toxicity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe “light chains” of antibodies (immunoglobulins) from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types, called kappa (κ) and lambda (λ), based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDepending on the amino acid sequences of the constant domains of their heavy chains, antibodies (immunoglobulins) can be assigned to different classes. There are five major classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM, and several of these may be further divided into subclasses (isotypes), e.g., IgG\n1\n, IgG2, IgG3, IgG\n4\n, IgA\n1\n, and IgA\n2\n. The heavy chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called α, δ, ε, γ, and μ, respectively. The subunit structures and three-dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known and described generally in, for example, Abbas et al. Cellular and Mol. Immunology, 4th ed. (2000). An antibody may be part of a larger fusion molecule, formed by covalent or non-covalent association of the antibody with one or more other proteins or peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “full length antibody,” “intact antibody” and “whole antibody” are used herein interchangeably to refer to an antibody in its substantially intact form, not antibody fragments as defined below. The terms particularly refer to an antibody with heavy chains that contain the Fc region.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Antibody fragments” comprise only a portion of an intact antibody, wherein the portion retains at least one, and as many as most or all, of the functions normally associated with that portion when present in an intact antibody. In one embodiment, an antibody fragment comprises an antigen binding site of the intact antibody and thus retains the ability to bind antigen. In another embodiment, an antibody fragment, for example one that comprises the Fc region, retains at least one of the biological functions normally associated with the Fc region when present in an intact antibody, such as FcRn binding, antibody half life modulation, ADCC function and complement binding. In one embodiment, an antibody fragment is a monovalent antibody that has an in vivo half life substantially similar to an intact antibody. For example, such an antibody fragment may comprise on antigen binding arm linked to an Fc sequence capable of conferring in vivo stability to the fragment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPapain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen-binding fragments, called “Fab” fragments, each with a single antigen-binding site, and a residual “Fc” fragment, whose name reflects its ability to crystallize readily. Pepsin treatment yields an F(ab′)\n2 \nfragment that has two antigen-combining sites and is still capable of cross-linking antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Fv” is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen-binding site. In one embodiment, a two-chain Fv species consists of a dimer of one heavy- and one light-chain variable domain in tight, non-covalent association. In a single-chain Fv (scFv) species, one heavy- and one light-chain variable domain can be covalently linked by a flexible peptide linker such that the light and heavy chains can associate in a “dimeric” structure analogous to that in a two-chain Fv species. It is in this configuration that the three CDRs of each variable domain interact to define an antigen-binding site on the surface of the VH-VL dimer. Collectively, the six CDRs confer antigen-binding specificity to the antibody. However, even a single variable domain (or half of an Fv comprising only three CDRs specific for an antigen) has the ability to recognize and bind antigen, although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Fab fragment contains the heavy- and light-chain variable domains and also contains the constant domain of the light chain and the first constant domain (CH1) of the heavy chain. Fab′ fragments differ from Fab fragments by the addition of a few residues at the carboxy terminus of the heavy chain CH1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab′-SH is the designation herein for Fab′ in which the cysteine residue(s) of the constant domains bear a free thiol group. F(ab′)\n2 \nantibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab′ fragments which have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Single-chain Fv” or “scFv” antibody fragments comprise the VH and VL domains of antibody, wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. Generally, the scFv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the VH and VL domains which enables the scFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of scFv see Pluckthun, in The Pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibodies, vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds., Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315 (1994).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “diabodies” refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites, which fragments comprise a heavy-chain variable domain (VH) connected to a light-chain variable domain (VL) in the same polypeptide chain (VH-VL). By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain, the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen-binding sites. Diabodies may be bivalent or bispecific. Diabodies are described more fully in, for example, EP 404,097; WO93/1161; Hudson et al. (2003) Nat. Med. 9:129-134; and Hollinger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90: 6444-6448 (1993). Triabodies and tetrabodies are also described in Hudson et al. (2003) Nat. Med. 9:129-134.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “monoclonal antibody” as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible mutations, e.g., naturally occurring mutations, that may be present in minor amounts. Thus, the modifier “monoclonal” indicates the character of the antibody as not being a mixture of discrete antibodies. In certain embodiments, such a monoclonal antibody typically includes an antibody comprising a polypeptide sequence that binds a target, wherein the target-binding polypeptide sequence was obtained by a process that includes the selection of a single target binding polypeptide sequence from a plurality of polypeptide sequences. For example, the selection process can be the selection of a unique clone from a plurality of clones, such as a pool of hybridoma clones, phage clones, or recombinant DNA clones. It should be understood that a selected target binding sequence can be further altered, for example, to improve affinity for the target, to humanize the target binding sequence, to improve its production in cell culture, to reduce its immunogenicity in vivo, to create a multispecific antibody, etc., and that an antibody comprising the altered target binding sequence is also a monoclonal antibody of this invention. In contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody of a monoclonal antibody preparation is directed against a single determinant on an antigen. In addition to their specificity, monoclonal antibody preparations are advantageous in that they are typically uncontaminated by other immunoglobulins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe modifier “monoclonal” indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by a variety of techniques, including, for example, the hybridoma method (e.g., Kohler et al., Nature, 256: 495 (1975); Harlow et al., Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2\nnd \ned. 1988); Hammerling et al., in: Monoclonal Antibodies and T-Cell Hybridomas 563-681 (Elsevier, N.Y., 1981)), recombinant DNA methods (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567), phage display technologies (see, e.g., Clackson et al., Nature, 352: 624-628 (1991); Marks et al., J. Mol. Biol. 222: 581-597 (1992); Sidhu et al., J. Mol.

Methods 284(1-2): 119-132 (2004), and technologies for producing human or human-like antibodies in animals that have parts or all of the human immunoglobulin loci or genes encoding human immunoglobulin sequences (see, e.g., WO98/24893; WO96/34096; WO96/33735; WO91/10741; Jakobovits et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90: 2551 (1993); Jakobovits et al., Nature 362: 255-258 (1993); Bruggemann et al., Year in Immunol. 7:33 (1993); U.S. Pat.

Rev. Immunol. 13: 65-93 (1995).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include “chimeric” antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and Morrison et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:6851-6855 (1984)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Humanized” forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. In one embodiment, a humanized antibody is a human immunoglobulin (recipient antibody) in which residues from a hypervariable region of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit, or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity, affinity, and/or capacity. In some instances, framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications may be made to further refine antibody performance. In general, a humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin, and all or substantially all of the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally will also comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin.

Biotech. 5:428-433 (1994).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “human antibody” is one which possesses an amino acid sequence which corresponds to that of an antibody produced by a human and/or has been made using any of the techniques for making human antibodies as disclosed herein. This definition of a human antibody specifically excludes a humanized antibody comprising non-human antigen-binding residues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “hypervariable region,” “HVR,” or “HV,” when used herein refers to the regions of an antibody variable domain which are hypervariable in sequence and/or form structurally defined loops. Generally, antibodies comprise six hypervariable regions; three in the VH (H1, H2, H3), and three in the VL (L1, L2, L3). In native antibodies, H3 and L3 display the most diversity of the six hypervariable regions, and H3 in particular is believed to play a unique role in conferring fine specificity to antibodies. Xu et al. (2000) Immunity 13:37-45; Johnson and Wu (2003) in Methods in Molecular Biology 248:1-25 (Lo, ed., Human Press, Totowa, N.J.). Indeed, naturally occurring camelid antibodies consisting of a heavy chain only are functional and stable in the absence of light chain. Hamers-Casterman et al. (1993) Nature 363:446-448; Sheriff et al. (1996) Nature Struct. Biol. 3:733-736.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA number of hypervariable region delineations are in use and are encompassed herein. The Kabat Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs) are based on sequence variability and are the most commonly used (Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991)). Chothia refers instead to the location of the structural loops (Chothia and Lesk J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917 (1987)). The AbM hypervariable regions represent a compromise between the Kabat CDRs and Chothia structural loops, and are used by Oxford Molecular's AbM antibody modeling software. The “contact” hypervariable regions are based on an analysis of the available complex crystal structures. The residues from each of these hypervariable regions are noted below.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoop\n\n\nKabat\n\n\nAbM\n\n\nChothia\n\n\nContact\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL1\n\n\nL24-L34\n\n\nL24-L34\n\n\nL26-L32\n\n\nL30-L36\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL2\n\n\nL50-L56\n\n\nL50-L56\n\n\nL50-L52\n\n\nL46-L55\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL3\n\n\nL89-L97\n\n\nL89-L97\n\n\nL91-L96\n\n\nL89-L96\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH1\n\n\nH31-H35B\n\n\nH26-H35B\n\n\nH26-H32\n\n\nH30-H35B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Kabat Numbering)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH1\n\n\nH31-H35\n\n\nH26-H35\n\n\nH26-H32\n\n\nH30-H35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Chothia Numbering)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH2\n\n\nH50-H65\n\n\nH50-H58\n\n\nH53-H55\n\n\nH47-H58\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH3\n\n\nH95-H102\n\n\nH95-H102\n\n\nH96-H101\n\n\nH93-H101\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHypervariable regions may comprise “extended hypervariable regions” as follows: 24-36 or 24-34 (L1), 46-56 or 50-56 (L2) and 89-97 or 89-96 (L3) in the VL and 26-35 (H1), 50-65 or 49-65 (H2) and 93-102, 94-102, or 95-102 (H3) in the VH. The variable domain residues are numbered according to Kabat et al., supra, for each of these definitions. The HVR-H1 and HVR-H2 hypervariable regions of the anti-CD22 10F4 antibodies of the invention are H26-H35 and H49-H65 using Kabat numbering.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Framework” or “FR” residues are those variable domain residues other than the hypervariable region residues as herein defined.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “variable domain residue numbering as in Kabat” or “amino acid position numbering as in Kabat,” and variations thereof, refers to the numbering system used for heavy chain variable domains or light chain variable domains of the compilation of antibodies in Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5\nth \nEd. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991). Using this numbering system, the actual linear amino acid sequence may contain fewer or additional amino acids corresponding to a shortening of, or insertion into, a FR or HVR of the variable domain. For example, a heavy chain variable domain may include a single amino acid insert (residue 52a according to Kabat) after \nresidue\n 52 of H2 and inserted residues (e.g. residues 82a, 82b, and 82c, etc. according to Kabat) after heavy \nchain FR residue\n 82. The Kabat numbering of residues may be determined for a given antibody by alignment at regions of homology of the sequence of the antibody with a “standard” Kabat numbered sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “free cysteine amino acid” refers to a cysteine amino acid residue which has been engineered into a parent antibody, has a thiol functional group (—SH), and is not paired as, or otherwise part of, an intramolecular or intermolecular disulfide bridge.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “thiol reactivity value” is a quantitative characterization of the reactivity of free cysteine amino acids. The thiol reactivity value is the percentage of a free cysteine amino acid in a cysteine engineered antibody which reacts with a thiol-reactive reagent, and converted to a maximum value of 1. For example, a free cysteine amino acid on a cysteine engineered antibody which reacts in 100% yield with a thiol-reactive reagent, such as a biotin-maleimide reagent, to form a biotin-labelled antibody has a thiol reactivity value of 1.0. Another cysteine amino acid engineered into the same or different parent antibody which reacts in 80% yield with a thiol-reactive reagent has a thiol reactivity value of 0.8. Another cysteine amino acid engineered into the same or different parent antibody which fails totally to react with a thiol-reactive reagent has a thiol reactivity value of 0. Determination of the thiol reactivity value of a particular cysteine may be conducted by ELISA assay, mass spectroscopy, liquid chromatography, autoradiography, or other quantitative analytical tests. Thiol-reactive reagents which allow capture of the cysteine engineered antibody and comparison and quantitation of the cysteine reactivity include biotin-PEO-maleimide ((+)-biotinyl-3-maleimidopropionamidyl-3,6-dioxaoctainediamine, Oda et al (2001) Nature Biotechnology 19:379-382, Pierce Biotechnology, Inc.) Biotin-BMCC, PEO-Iodoacetyl Biotin, Iodoacetyl-LC-Biotin, and Biotin-HPDP (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc.), and Nα-(3-maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin (MPB, Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg.). Other commercial sources for biotinylation, bifunctional and multifunctional linker reagents include Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg., and Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “parent antibody” is an antibody comprising an amino acid sequence from which one or more amino acid residues are replaced by one or more cysteine residues. The parent antibody may comprise a native or wild type sequence. The parent antibody may have pre-existing amino acid sequence modifications (such as additions, deletions and/or substitutions) relative to other native, wild type, or modified forms of an antibody. A parent antibody may be directed against a target antigen of interest, e.g. a biologically important polypeptide. Antibodies directed against nonpolypeptide antigens (such as tumor-associated glycolipid antigens; see U.S. Pat. No. 5,091,178) are also contemplated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following abbreviations are used herein and have the indicated definitions: BME is beta-mercaptoethanol, Boc is N-(t-butoxycarbonyl), cit is citrulline (2-amino-5-ureido pentanoic acid), dap is dolaproine, DCC is 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, DCM is dichloromethane, DEA is diethylamine, DEAD is diethylazodicarboxylate, DEPC is diethylphosphorylcyanidate, DIAD is diisopropylazodicarboxylate, DIEA is N,N-diisopropylethylamine, dil is dolaisoleucine, DMA is dimethylacetamide, DMAP is 4-dimethylaminopyridine, DME is ethyleneglycol dimethyl ether (or 1,2-dimethoxyethane), DMF is N,N-dimethylformamide, DMSO is dimethylsulfoxide, doe is dolaphenine, dov is N,N-dimethylvaline, DTNB is 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), DTPA is diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, DTT is dithiothreitol, EDCI is 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride, EEDQ is 2-ethoxy-1-ethoxycarbonyl-1,2-dihydroquinoline, ES-MS is electrospray mass spectrometry, EtOAc is ethyl acetate, Fmoc is N-(9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl), gly is glycine, HATU is O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate, HOBt is 1-hydroxybenzotriazole, HPLC is high pressure liquid chromatography, ile is isoleucine, lys is lysine, MeCN(CH\n3\nCN) is acetonitrile, MeOH is methanol, Mtr is 4-anisyldiphenylmethyl (or 4-methoxytrityl), nor is (1S,2R)-(+)-norephedrine, PAB is p-aminobenzylcarbamoyl, PBS is phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7), PEG is polyethylene glycol, Ph is phenyl, Pnp is p-nitrophenyl, MC is 6-maleimidocaproyl, phe is L-phenylalanine, PyBrop is bromo tris-pyrrolidino phosphonium hexafluorophosphate, SEC is size-exclusion chromatography, Su is succinimide, TFA is trifluoroacetic acid, TLC is thin layer chromatography, UV is ultraviolet, and val is valine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “affinity matured” antibody is one with one or more alterations in one or more HVRs thereof which result in an improvement in the affinity of the antibody for antigen, compared to a parent antibody which does not possess those alteration(s). In one embodiment, an affinity matured antibody has nanomolar or even picomolar affinities for the target antigen. Affinity matured antibodies are produced by procedures known in the art. Marks et al. Bio/Technology 10:779-783 (1992) describes affinity maturation by VH and VL domain shuffling. Random mutagenesis of HVR and/or framework residues is described by: Barbas et al. Proc Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 91:3809-3813 (1994); Schier et al. Gene 169:147-155 (1995); Yelton et al. J. Immunol. 155:1994-2004 (1995); Jackson et al., J. Immunol. 154(7):3310-9 (1995); and Hawkins et al, J. Mol. Biol. 226:889-896 (1992).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “blocking” antibody or an “antagonist” antibody is one which inhibits or reduces biological activity of the antigen it binds. Certain blocking antibodies or antagonist antibodies substantially or completely inhibit the biological activity of the antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “agonist antibody,” as used herein, is an antibody which mimics at least one of the functional activities of a polypeptide of interest.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody “effector functions” refer to those biological activities attributable to the Fc region (a native sequence Fc region or amino acid sequence variant Fc region) of an antibody, and vary with the antibody isotype. Examples of antibody effector functions include: C1q binding and complement dependent cytotoxicity; Fc receptor binding; antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC); phagocytosis; down regulation of cell surface receptors (e.g. B cell receptor); and B cell activation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Fc receptor” or “FcR” describes a receptor that binds to the Fc region of an antibody. In some embodiments, an FcR is a native human FcR. In some embodiments, an FcR is one which binds an IgG antibody (a gamma receptor) and includes receptors of the FcγRI, FcγRII, and FcγRIII subclasses, including allelic variants and alternatively spliced forms of those receptors. FcγRII receptors include FcγRIIA (an “activating receptor”) and FcγRIIB (an “inhibiting receptor”), which have similar amino acid sequences that differ primarily in the cytoplasmic domains thereof. Activating receptor FcγRIIA contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in its cytoplasmic domain. Inhibiting receptor FcγRIIB contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) in its cytoplasmic domain. (see Daëron, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 15:203-234 (1997)). FcRs are reviewed in Ravetch and Kinet, Annu. Rev. Immunol 9:457-92 (1991); Capel et al., Immunomethods 4:25-34 (1994); and de Haas et al., J. Lab. Clin. Med. 126:330-41 (1995). Other FcRs, including those to be identified in the future, are encompassed by the term “FcR” herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “Fc receptor” or “FcR” also includes the neonatal receptor, FcRn, which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus (Guyer et al., J. Immunol. 117:587 (1976) and Kim et al., J. Immunol. 24:249 (1994)) and regulation of homeostasis of immunoglobulins. Methods of measuring binding to FcRn are known (see, e.g., Ghetie 1997, Hinton 2004). Binding to human FcRn in vivo and serum half life of human FcRn high affinity binding polypeptides can be assayed, e.g., in transgenic mice or transfected human cell lines expressing human FcRn, or in primates administered with the Fc variant polypeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWO00/42072 (Presta) describes antibody variants with improved or diminished binding to FcRs. The content of that patent publication is specifically incorporated herein by reference. See, also, Shields et al. J. Biol. Chem. 9(2): 6591-6604 (2001).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Human effector cells” are leukocytes which express one or more FcRs and perform effector functions. In certain embodiments, the cells express at least FcγRIII and perform ADCC effector function(s). Examples of human leukocytes which mediate ADCC include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes, cytotoxic T cells and neutrophils. The effector cells may be isolated from a native source, e.g., from blood.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity” or “ADCC” refers to a form of cytotoxicity in which secreted Ig bound onto Fc receptors (FcRs) present on certain cytotoxic cells (e.g. Natural Killer (NK) cells, neutrophils, and macrophages) enable these cytotoxic effector cells to bind specifically to an antigen-bearing target cell and subsequently kill the target cell with cytotoxins. The primary cells for mediating ADCC, NK cells, express FcγRIII only, whereas monocytes express FcγRI, FcγRII and FcγRIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet, Annu. Rev. Immunol 9:457-92 (1991). To assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest, an in vitro ADCC assay, such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,500,362 or 5,821,337 or Presta U.S. Pat. No. 6,737,056 may be performed. Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and Natural Killer (NK) cells. Alternatively, or additionally, ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo, e.g., in a animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. PNAS (USA) 95:652-656 (1998).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Complement dependent cytotoxicity” or “CDC” refers to the lysis of a target cell in the presence of complement. Activation of the classical complement pathway is initiated by the binding of the first component of the complement system (C1q) to antibodies (of the appropriate subclass) which are bound to their cognate antigen. To assess complement activation, a CDC assay, e.g. as described in Gazzano-Santoro et al., J. Immunol. Methods 202:163 (1996), may be performed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolypeptide variants with altered Fc region amino acid sequences and increased or decreased C1q binding capability are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,194,551B1 and WO99/51642. The contents of those patent publications are specifically incorporated herein by reference. See, also, Idusogie et al. J. Immunol. 164: 4178-4184 (2000).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “Fc region-comprising polypeptide” refers to a polypeptide, such as an antibody or immunoadhesin, which comprises an Fc region. The C-terminal lysine (residue 447 according to the EU numbering system) of the Fc region may be removed, for example, during purification of the polypeptide or by recombinant engineering the nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide. Accordingly, a composition comprising a polypeptide having an Fc region according to this invention can comprise polypeptides with K447, with all K447 removed, or a mixture of polypeptides with and without the K447 residue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “acceptor human framework” for the purposes herein is a framework comprising the amino acid sequence of a VL or VH framework derived from a human immunoglobulin framework or a human consensus framework. An acceptor human framework “derived from” a human immunoglobulin framework or a human consensus framework may comprise the same amino acid sequence thereof, or it may contain pre-existing amino acid sequence changes. In some embodiments, the number of pre-existing amino acid changes are 10 or less, 9 or less, 8 or less, 7 or less, 6 or less, 5 or less, 4 or less, 3 or less, or 2 or less. Where pre-existing amino acid changes are present in a VH, preferably those changes occur at only three, two, or one of positions 71H, 73H and 78H; for instance, the amino acid residues at those positions may be 71A, 73T and/or 78A. In one embodiment, the VL acceptor human framework is identical in sequence to the VL human immunoglobulin framework sequence or human consensus framework sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “human consensus framework” is a framework which represents the most commonly occurring amino acid residues in a selection of human immunoglobulin VL or VH framework sequences. Generally, the selection of human immunoglobulin VL or VH sequences is from a subgroup of variable domain sequences. Generally, the subgroup of sequences is a subgroup as in Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5\nth \nEd. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991). In one embodiment, for the VL, the subgroup is subgroup kappa I as in Kabat et al., supra. In one embodiment, for the VH, the subgroup is subgroup III as in Kabat et al., supra.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “VH subgroup III consensus framework” comprises the consensus sequence obtained from the amino acid sequences in variable heavy subgroup III of Kabat et al., supra. In one embodiment, the VH subgroup III consensus framework amino acid sequence comprises at least a portion or all of each of the following sequences:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEVQLVESGGGLVQPGGSLRLSCAAS (FR-H1, SEQ ID NO: 1)-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHVR-H1-WVRQAPGKGLEWV (FR-H2, SEQ ID NO: 3)-HVR-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nH2-RFTISADTSKNTAYLQMNSLRAEDTAVYYC (FR-H3, SEQ ID \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNO: 5)-HVR-H3-WGQGTLVTVSS (FR-H4, SEQ ID NO: 7).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “VL subgroup I consensus framework” comprises the consensus sequence obtained from the amino acid sequences in variable light kappa subgroup I of Kabat et al., supra. In one embodiment, the VH subgroup I consensus framework amino acid sequence comprises at least a portion or all of each of the following sequences:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIQMTQSPSSLSASVGDRVTITC (FR-L1, SEQ ID NO: 8)-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHVR-L1-WYQQKPGKAPKLLIY (FR-L2, SEQ ID NO: 11)-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHVR-L2-GVPSRFSGSGSGTDFTLTISSLQPEDFATYYC (FR-L3,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 13)-HVR-L3-FGQGTKVEIK (FR-L4, SEQ ID\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNO: 15).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Secretion signal sequence” or “signal sequence” refers to a nucleic acid sequence encoding a short signal peptide that can be used to direct a newly synthesized protein of interest through a cellular membrane, usually the inner membrane or both inner and outer membranes of prokaryotes. As such, the protein of interest such as the immunoglobulin light or heavy chain polypeptide is secreted into the periplasm of the prokaryotic host cells or into the culture medium. The signal peptide encoded by the secretion signal sequence may be endogenous to the host cells, or they may be exogenous, including signal peptides native to the polypeptide to be expressed. Secretion signal sequences are typically present at the amino terminus of a polypeptide to be expressed, and are typically removed enzymatically between biosynthesis and secretion of the polypeptide from the cytoplasm. Thus, the signal peptide is usually not present in a mature protein product.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Binding affinity” generally refers to the strength of the sum total of noncovalent interactions between a single binding site of a molecule (e.g., an antibody) and its binding partner (e.g., an antigen). Unless indicated otherwise, as used herein, “binding affinity” refers to intrinsic binding affinity which reflects a 1:1 interaction between members of a binding pair (e.g., antibody and antigen). The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the dissociation constant (Kd). Affinity can be measured by common methods known in the art, including those described herein. Low-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen slowly and tend to dissociate readily, whereas high-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen faster and tend to remain bound longer. A variety of methods of measuring binding affinity are known in the art, any of which can be used for purposes of the present invention. Specific illustrative embodiments are described in the following.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the “Kd” or “Kd value” according to this invention is measured by a radiolabeled antigen binding assay (RIA) performed with the Fab version of an antibody of interest and its antigen as described by the following assay. Solution binding affinity of Fabs for antigen is measured by equilibrating Fab with a minimal concentration of (125I)-labeled antigen in the presence of a titration series of unlabeled antigen, then capturing bound antigen with an anti-Fab antibody-coated plate (Chen, et al., (1999) J. Mol. Biol. 293:865-881). To establish conditions for the assay, microtiter plates (Dynex) are coated overnight with 5 μg/ml of a capturing anti-Fab antibody (Cappel Labs) in 50 mM sodium carbonate (pH 9.6), and subsequently blocked with 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for two to five hours at room temperature (approximately 23° C.). In a non-adsorbent plate (Nunc #269620), 100 pM or 26 pM [\n125\nI]-antigen are mixed with serial dilutions of a Fab of interest (e.g., consistent with assessment of the anti-VEGF antibody, Fab-12, in Presta et al., (1997) Cancer Res. 57:4593-4599). The Fab of interest is then incubated overnight; however, the incubation may continue for a longer period (e.g., about 65 hours) to ensure that equilibrium is reached. Thereafter, the mixtures are transferred to the capture plate for incubation at room temperature (e.g., for one hour). The solution is then removed and the plate washed eight times with 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS. When the plates have dried, 150 μl/well of scintillant (MicroScint-20; Packard) is added, and the plates are counted on a Topcount gamma counter (Packard) for ten minutes. Concentrations of each Fab that give less than or equal to 20% of maximal binding are chosen for use in competitive binding assays.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to another embodiment, the Kd or Kd value is measured by using surface plasmon resonance assays using a BIAcore™-2000 or a BIAcore™-3000 (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.) at 25° C. with immobilized antigen CM5 chips at ˜10 response units (RU). Briefly, carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CM5, BIAcore Inc.) are activated with N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's instructions. Antigen is diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, to 5 μg/ml (˜0.2 μM) before injection at a flow rate of 5 μl/minute to achieve approximately 10 response units (RU) of coupled protein. Following the injection of antigen, 1 M ethanolamine is injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of Fab (0.78 nM to 500 nM) are injected in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) at 25° C. at a flow rate of approximately 25 μl/min. Association rates (kon) and dissociation rates (koff) are calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIAcore Evaluation Software version 3.2) by simultaneously fitting the association and dissociation sensorgrams. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) is calculated as the ratio koff/kon. See, e.g., Chen, Y., et al., (1999) J. Mol. Biol. 293:865-881. If the on-rate exceeds 106 M−1 s−1 by the surface plasmon resonance assay above, then the on-rate can be determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity (excitation=295 nm; emission=340 nm, 16 nm band-pass) at 25° C. of a 20 nM anti-antigen antibody (Fab form) in PBS, pH 7.2, in the presence of increasing concentrations of antigen as measured in a spectrometer, such as a stop-flow equipped spectrophometer (Aviv Instruments) or a 8000-series SLM-Aminco spectrophotometer (ThermoSpectronic) with a stirred cuvette.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “on-rate,” “rate of association,” “association rate,” or “k\non\n” according to this invention can also be determined as described above using a BIAcore™-2000 or a BIAcore™-3000 system (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “disorder” is any condition or disease that would benefit from treatment with an substance/molecule or method of the invention. This includes chronic and acute disorders including those pathological conditions which predispose the mammal to the disorder in question. Non-limiting examples of disorders to be treated herein include cancerous conditions such as B cell proliferative disorders and/or B cell tumors, e.g., lymphoma, non-Hogkins lymphoma (NHL), aggressive NHL, relapsed aggressive NHL, relapsed indolent NHL, refractory NHL, refractory indolent NHL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), small lymphocytic lymphoma, leukemia, hairy cell leukemia (HCL), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and mantle cell lymphoma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “cell proliferative disorder” and “proliferative disorder” refer to disorders that are associated with some degree of abnormal cell proliferation. In one embodiment, the cell proliferative disorder is cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Tumor,” as used herein, refers to all neoplastic cell growth and proliferation, whether malignant or benign, and all pre-cancerous and cancerous cells and tissues. The terms “cancer,” “cancerous,” “cell proliferative disorder,” “proliferative disorder” and “tumor” are not mutually exclusive as referred to herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “cancer” and “cancerous” refer to or describe the physiological condition in mammals that is typically characterized by unregulated cell growth/proliferation. Examples of cancer include, but are not limited to, cancerous B cell proliferative disorders B cell proliferative disorder is selected from lymphoma, non-Hogkins lymphoma (NHL), aggressive NHL, relapsed aggressive NHL, relapsed indolent NHL, refractory NHL, refractory indolent NHL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), small lymphocytic lymphoma, leukemia, hairy cell leukemia (HCL), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and mantle cell lymphoma.

More particular examples of such cancers include squamous cell cancer, small-cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma of the lung, squamous carcinoma of the lung, cancer of the peritoneum, hepatocellular cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, pancreatic cancer, glioma, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer, bladder cancer, hepatoma, breast cancer, colon cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial or uterine carcinoma, salivary gland carcinoma, kidney cancer, liver cancer, prostate cancer, vulval cancer, thyroid cancer, hepatic carcinoma, leukemia and other lymphoproliferative disorders, and various types of head and neck cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “B-cell malignancy” herein includes non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), including low grade/follicular NHL, small lymphocytic (SL) NHL, intermediate grade/follicular NHL, intermediate grade diffuse NHL, high grade immunoblastic NHL, high grade lymphoblastic NHL, high grade small non-cleaved cell NHL, bulky disease NHL, mantle cell lymphoma, AIDS-related lymphoma, and Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin's disease (LPHD), small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), indolent NHL including relapsed indolent NHL and rituximab-refractory indolent NHL; leukemia, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), Hairy cell leukemia, chronic myeloblastic leukemia; mantle cell lymphoma; and other hematologic malignancies. Such malignancies may be treated with antibodies directed against B-cell surface markers, such as CD22. Such diseases are contemplated herein to be treated by the administration of an antibody directed against a B cell surface marker, such as CD22, and includes the administration of an unconjugated (“naked”) antibody or an antibody conjugated to a cytotoxic agent as disclosed herein. Such diseases are also contemplated herein to be treated by combination therapy including an anti-CD22 antibody or anti-CD22 antibody drug conjugate of the invention in combination with another antibody or antibody drug conjugate, another cytoxic agent, radiation or other treatment administered simultaneously or in series. In exemplary treatment method of the invention, an anti-CD22 antibody of the invention is administered in combination with an anti-CD20 antibody, immunoglobulin, or CD20 binding fragment thereof, either together or sequentially. The anti-CD20 antibody may be a naked antibody or an antibody drug conjugate. In an embodiment of the combination therapy, the anti-CD22 antibody is an antibody of the present invention and the anti-CD20 antibody is Rituxan® (rituximab).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “non-Hodgkin's lymphoma” or “NHL”, as used herein, refers to a cancer of the lymphatic system other than Hodgkin's lymphomas. Hodgkin's lymphomas can generally be distinguished from non-Hodgkin's lymphomas by the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells in Hodgkin's lymphomas and the absence of said cells in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Examples of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas encompassed by the term as used herein include any that would be identified as such by one skilled in the art (e.g., an oncologist or pathologist) in accordance with classification schemes known in the art, such as the Revised European-American Lymphoma (REAL) scheme as described in Color Atlas of Clinical Hematology (3rd edition), A. Victor Hoffbrand and John E. Pettit (eds.) (Harcourt Publishers Ltd., 2000). See, in particular, the lists in FIG. 11.57, 11.58 and 11.59. More specific examples include, but are not limited to, relapsed or refractory NHL, front line low grade NHL, Stage III/IV NHL, chemotherapy resistant NHL, precursor B lymphoblastic leukemia and/or lymphoma, small lymphocytic lymphoma, B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and/or prolymphocytic leukemia and/or small lymphocytic lymphoma, B-cell prolymphocytic lymphoma, immunocytoma and/or lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, marginal zone B cell lymphoma, splenic marginal zone lymphoma, extranodal marginal zone-MALT lymphoma, nodal marginal zone lymphoma, hairy cell leukemia, plasmacytoma and/or plasma cell myeloma, low grade/follicular lymphoma, intermediate grade/follicular NHL, mantle cell lymphoma, follicle center lymphoma (follicular), intermediate grade diffuse NHL, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, aggressive NHL (including aggressive front-line NHL and aggressive relapsed NHL), NHL relapsing after or refractory to autologous stem cell transplantation, primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, primary effusion lymphoma, high grade immunoblastic NHL, high grade lymphoblastic NHL, high grade small non-cleaved cell NHL, bulky disease NHL, Burkitt's lymphoma, precursor (peripheral) large granular lymphocytic leukemia, mycosis fungoides and/or Sezary syndrome, skin (cutaneous) lymphomas, anaplastic large cell lymphoma, angiocentric lymphoma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “autoimmune disease” herein is a disease or disorder arising from and directed against an individual's own tissues or organs or a co-segregate or manifestation thereof or resulting condition therefrom. In many of these autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, a number of clinical and laboratory markers may exist, including, but not limited to, hypergammaglobulinemia, high levels of autoantibodies, antigen-antibody complex deposits in tissues, benefit from corticosteroid or immunosuppressive treatments, and lymphoid cell aggregates in affected tissues. Without being limited to any one theory regarding B-cell mediated autoimmune disease, it is believed that B cells demonstrate a pathogenic effect in human autoimmune diseases through a multitude of mechanistic pathways, including autoantibody production, immune complex formation, dendritic and T-cell activation, cytokine synthesis, direct chemokine release, and providing a nidus for ectopic neo-lymphogenesis. Each of these pathways may participate to different degrees in the pathology of autoimmune diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Autoimmune disease” can be an organ-specific disease (i.e., the immune response is specifically directed against an organ system such as the endocrine system, the hematopoietic system, the skin, the cardiopulmonary system, the gastrointestinal and liver systems, the renal system, the thyroid, the ears, the neuromuscular system, the central nervous system, etc.) or a systemic disease which can affect multiple organ systems (for example, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, polymyositis, etc.). Preferred such diseases include autoimmune rheumatologic disorders (such as, for example, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren's syndrome, scleroderma, lupus such as SLE and lupus nephritis, polymyositis/dermatomyositis, cryoglobulinemia, anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome, and psoriatic arthritis), autoimmune gastrointestinal and liver disorders (such as, for example, inflammatory bowel diseases (e.g., ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease), autoimmune gastritis and pernicious anemia, autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and celiac disease), vasculitis (such as, for example, ANCA-negative vasculitis and ANCA-associated vasculitis, including Churg-Strauss vasculitis, Wegener's granulomatosis, and microscopic polyangiitis), autoimmune neurological disorders (such as, for example, multiple sclerosis, opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome, myasthenia gravis, neuromyelitis optica, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and autoimmune polyneuropathies), renal disorders (such as, for example, glomerulonephritis, Goodpasture's syndrome, and Berger's disease), autoimmune dermatologic disorders (such as, for example, psoriasis, urticaria, hives, pemphigus vulgaris, bullous pemphigoid, and cutaneous lupus erythematosus), hematologic disorders (such as, for example, thrombocytopenic purpura, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, post-transfusion purpura, and autoimmune hemolytic anemia), atherosclerosis, uveitis, autoimmune hearing diseases (such as, for example, inner ear disease and hearing loss), Behcet's disease, Raynaud's syndrome, organ transplant, and autoimmune endocrine disorders (such as, for example, diabetic-related autoimmune diseases such as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), Addison's disease, and autoimmune thyroid disease (e.g., Graves' disease and thyroiditis)). More preferred such diseases include, for example, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, ANCA-associated vasculitis, lupus, multiple sclerosis, Sjögren's syndrome, Graves' disease, IDDM, pernicious anemia, thyroiditis, and glomerulonephritis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecific examples of other autoimmune diseases as defined herein, which in some cases encompass those listed above, include,

Such diseases are contemplated herein to be treated by the administration of an antibody which binds to a B cell surface marker, such as CD22, and includes the administration of an unconjugated (“naked”) antibody or an antibody conjugated to a cytotoxic agent as disclosed herein. Such diseases are also contemplated herein to be treated by combination therapy including an anti-CD22 antibody or anti-CD22 antibody drug conjugate of the invention in combination with another antibody or antibody drug conjugate, another cytoxic agent, radiation or other treatment administered simultaneously or in series.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “treatment” (and variations such as “treat” or “treating”) refers to clinical intervention in an attempt to alter the natural course of the individual or cell being treated, and can be performed either for prophylaxis or during the course of clinical pathology. Desirable effects of treatment include preventing occurrence or recurrence of disease, alleviation of symptoms, diminishment of any direct or indirect pathological consequences of the disease, preventing metastasis, decreasing the rate of disease progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state, and remission or improved prognosis. In some embodiments, antibodies of the invention are used to delay development of a disease or disorder or to slow the progression of a disease or disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “individual” is a vertebrate. In certain embodiments, the vertebrate is a mammal. Mammals include, but are not limited to, farm animals (such as cows), sport animals, pets (such as cats, dogs, and horses), primates, mice and rats. In certain embodiments, a mammal is a human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “effective amount” refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired therapeutic or prophylactic result.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “therapeutically effective amount” of a substance/molecule of the invention may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the individual, and the ability of the substance/molecule, to elicit a desired response in the individual. A therapeutically effective amount encompasses an amount in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the substance/molecule are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects. A “prophylactically effective amount” refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired prophylactic result. Typically, but not necessarily, since a prophylactic dose is used in subjects prior to or at an earlier stage of disease, the prophylactically effective amount would be less than the therapeutically effective amount.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “cytotoxic agent” as used herein refers to a substance that inhibits or prevents a cellular function and/or causes cell death or destruction. The term is intended to include radioactive isotopes (e.g., At\n211\n, I\n131\n, I\n125\n, Y\n90\n, Re\n186\n, R\n188\n, Sm\n153\n, Bi\n212\n, P\n32\n, Pb\n212 \nand radioactive isotopes of Lu), chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., methotrexate, adriamicin, vinca alkaloids (vincristine, vinblastine, etoposide), doxorubicin, melphalan, mitomycin C, chlorambucil, daunorubicin or other intercalating agents, enzymes and fragments thereof such as nucleolytic enzymes, antibiotics, and toxins such as small molecule toxins or enzymatically active toxins of bacterial, fungal, plant or animal origin, including fragments and/or variants thereof, toxins, growth inhibitory agents, drug moieties, and the various antitumor or anticancer agents disclosed below.

They may be hormones themselves. Examples include anti-estrogens and selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), including, for example, tamoxifen (including NOLVADEX® tamoxifen), EVISTA® raloxifene, droloxifene, 4-hydroxytamoxifen, trioxifene, keoxifene, LY117018, onapristone, and FARESTON® toremifene; anti-progesterones; estrogen receptor down-regulators (ERDs); agents that function to suppress or shut down the ovaries, for example, leutinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists such as LUPRON® and ELIGARD® leuprolide acetate, goserelin acetate, buserelin acetate and tripterelin; other anti-androgens such as flutamide, nilutamide and bicalutamide; and aromatase inhibitors that inhibit the enzyme aromatase, which regulates estrogen production in the adrenal glands, such as, for example, 4(5)-imidazoles, aminoglutethimide, MEGASE® megestrol acetate, AROMASIN® exemestane, formestanie, fadrozole, RIVISOR® vorozole, FEMARA® letrozole, and ARIMIDEX® anastrozole.

Thus, the growth inhibitory agent may be one which significantly reduces the percentage of cells (such as a cell expressing CD22) in S phase. Examples of growth inhibitory agents include agents that block cell cycle progression (at a place other than S phase), such as agents that induce G1 arrest and M-phase arrest. Classical M-phase blockers include the vincas (vincristine and vinblastine), taxanes, and topoisomerase II inhibitors such as doxorubicin, epirubicin, daunorubicin, etoposide, and bleomycin. Those agents that arrest G1 also spill over into S-phase arrest, for example, DNA alkylating agents such as tamoxifen, prednisone, dacarbazine, mechlorethamine, cisplatin, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, and ara-C. Further information can be found in The Molecular Basis of Cancer, Mendelsohn and Israel, eds., \nChapter\n 1, entitled “Cell cycle regulation, oncogenes, and antineoplastic drugs” by Murakami et al. (WB Saunders: Philadelphia, 1995), especially p. 13. The taxanes (paclitaxel and docetaxel) are anticancer drugs both derived from the yew tree. Docetaxel (TAXOTERE®, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer), derived from the European yew, is a semisynthetic analogue of paclitaxel (TAXOL®, Bristol-Myers Squibb). Paclitaxel and docetaxel promote the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers and stabilize microtubules by preventing depolymerization, which results in the inhibition of mitosis in cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “intracellular metabolite” refers to a compound resulting from a metabolic process or reaction inside a cell on an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). The metabolic process or reaction may be an enzymatic process, such as proteolytic cleavage of a peptide linker of the ADC, or hydrolysis of a functional group such as a hydrazone, ester, or amide. Intracellular metabolites include, but are not limited to, antibodies and free drug which have undergone intracellular cleavage after entry, diffusion, uptake or transport into a cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “intracellularly cleaved” and “intracellular cleavage” refer to a metabolic process or reaction inside a cell on an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) whereby the covalent attachment, i.e. linker, between the drug moiety (D) and the antibody (Ab) is broken, resulting in the free drug dissociated from the antibody inside the cell. The cleaved moieties of the ADC are thus intracellular metabolites.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “bioavailability” refers to the systemic availability (i.e., blood/plasma levels) of a given amount of drug administered to a patient. Bioavailability is an absolute term that indicates measurement of both the time (rate) and total amount (extent) of drug that reaches the general circulation from an administered dosage form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “cytotoxic activity” refers to a cell-killing, cytostatic or growth inhibitory effect of an antibody-drug conjugate or an intracellular metabolite of an antibody-drug conjugate. Cytotoxic activity may be expressed as the IC\n50 \nvalue, which is the concentration (molar or mass) per unit volume at which half the cells survive.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Alkyl” is C1-C18 hydrocarbon containing normal, secondary, tertiary or cyclic carbon atoms.

P. Parker, Ed., McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Chemical Terms (1984) McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York; and Eliel, E. and Wilen, S., Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds (1994) John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York. Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms, i.e., they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. In describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L, or R and S, are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center(s). The prefixes d and l or (+) and (−) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with (−) or l meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with (+) or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure, these stereoisomers are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer may also be referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or a racemate, which may occur where there has been no stereoselection or stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process. The terms “racemic mixture” and “racemate” refer to an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species, devoid of optical activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Leaving group” refers to a functional group that can be substituted by another functional group.

The antigen used for screening the library was a polypeptide having the sequence of amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NO:28 or SEQ ID NO:30, corresponding to the extracellular domains (ECDs) of CD22 beta and alpha. The antibodies resulting from the library screen are affinity matured.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, monoclonal antibodies that compete with murine 10F4.4.1, humanized 10F4v1 and v3, and murine 5E8.1.8 for binding to CD22 are provided. Monoclonal antibodies that bind to the same epitope as murine 10F4.4.1, humanized 10F4v1 and v3, and murine 5E8.1.8 are also provided.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect of the invention, polynucleotides encoding anti-CD22 antibodies are provided. In certain embodiments, vectors comprising polynucleotides encoding anti-CD22 antibodies are provided. In certain embodiments, host cells comprising such vectors are provided. In another aspect of the invention, compositions comprising anti-CD22 antibodies or polynucleotides encoding anti-CD22 antibodies are provided. In certain embodiments, a composition of the invention is a pharmaceutical formulation for the treatment of a cell proliferative disorder, such as those enumerated herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody Administration and Formulation\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the anti-CD22 antibody or anti-CD22 antibody drug conjugate (including, but not limited to, an anti-CD22 thiomab drug conjugate of the invention) of the invention is administered in combination with an antagonist of a B-cell surface antigen. Administration “in combination with” one or more further therapeutic agents includes simultaneous (concurrent) and consecutive administration in any order. In one embodiment, the administration is consecutive or sequential. In another embodiment, the administration is simultaneous, concurrent, or together in the same formulation. In one embodiment, the B-cell surface antigen antagonist is an antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof. In one embodiment, the B-cell surface antagonist is an antibody drug conjugate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe formulations herein may contain more than one active compound as necessary for the particular indication being treated, preferably those with complementary activities that do not adversely affect each other. For example, in addition to an anti-CD22 antibody, anti-CD22 antibody drug conjugate or CD22 binding oligopeptide, it may be desirable to include in the one formulation, an additional antibody, e.g., a second anti-CD22 antibody which binds a different epitope on the CD22 polypeptide, or a second antibody that binds a different B-cell surface antigen, or an antibody to some other target such as a growth factor that affects the growth of the particular cancer. Alternatively, or additionally, the composition may further comprise a chemotherapeutic agent, cytotoxic agent, cytokine, growth inhibitory agent, anti-hormonal agent, and/or cardioprotectant. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCurrently, depending on the stage of the cancer, cancer treatment involves one or a combination of the following therapies: surgery to remove the cancerous tissue, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Anti-CD22 antibody, anti-CD22 antibody drug conjugate or oligopeptide therapy may be especially desirable in elderly patients who do not tolerate the toxicity and side effects of chemotherapy well and in metastatic disease where radiation therapy has limited usefulness. The tumor targeting anti-CD22 antibodies, anti-CD22 antibody drug conjugate or oligopeptide of the invention are useful to alleviate CD22-expressing cancers upon initial diagnosis of the disease or during relapse. For therapeutic applications, the anti-CD22 antibody, anti-CD22 antibody drug conjugate or oligopeptide can be used alone, or in combination therapy with, e.g., hormones, antiangiogens, or radiolabelled compounds, or with surgery, cryotherapy, and/or radiotherapy. Anti-CD22 antibody, anti-CD22 antibody drug conjugate or oligopeptide treatment can be administered in conjunction with other forms of conventional therapy, either consecutively with, pre- or post-conventional therapy. In the present method of the invention for treating or alleviating cancer, the cancer patient can be administered anti-CD22 antibody, anti-CD22 antibody drug conjugate or oligopeptide in conjunction with treatment with the one or more of the preceding chemotherapeutic agents. The anti-CD22 antibody, anti-CD22 antibody drug conjugate or oligopeptide will be administered with a therapeutically effective dose of the chemotherapeutic agent. In another embodiment, the anti-CD22 antibody, anti-CD22 antibody drug conjugate or oligopeptide is administered in conjunction with chemotherapy to enhance the activity and efficacy of the chemotherapeutic agent. The Physicians' Desk Reference (PDR) discloses dosages of these agents that have been used in treatment of various cancers. The dosing regimen and dosages of these aforementioned chemotherapeutic drugs that are therapeutically effective will depend on the particular cancer being treated, the extent of the disease and other factors familiar to the physician of skill in the art and can be determined by the physician.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one particular embodiment, a conjugate comprising an anti-CD22 antibody, anti-CD22 antibody drug conjugate or oligopeptide conjugated with a cytotoxic agent is administered to the patient. Preferably, the immunoconjugate bound to the CD22 protein is internalized by the cell, resulting in increased therapeutic efficacy of the immunoconjugate in killing the cancer cell to which it binds. In one embodiment, the cytotoxic agent targets or interferes with the nucleic acid in the cancer cell. Examples of cytotoxic agents are described above and include auristatins, maytansinoids, calicheamicins, ribonucleases and DNA endonucleases, or biologically active derivatives thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-CD22 antibodies, anti-CD22 antibody drug conjugates or oligopeptides or toxin conjugates thereof are administered to a human patient, in accord with known methods, such as intravenous administration, e.g., as a bolus or by continuous infusion over a period of time, by intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intracerobrospinal, subcutaneous, intra-articular, intrasynovial, intrathecal, oral, topical, or inhalation routes. Intravenous or subcutaneous administration of the antibody, anti-CD22 antibody drug conjugate or oligopeptide is preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther therapeutic regimens may be combined with the administration of the anti-CD22 antibody, anti-CD22 antibody drug conjugate or oligopeptide. The combined administration includes co-administration, using separate formulations or a single pharmaceutical formulation, and consecutive administration in either order, wherein preferably there is a time period while both (or all) active agents simultaneously exert their biological activities. Preferably such combined therapy results in a synergistic therapeutic effect.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt may also be desirable to combine administration of the anti-CD22 antibody or antibodies, anti-CD22 antibody drug conjugates or oligopeptides, with administration of an antibody directed against another tumor antigen or B-cell surface antigen associated with the particular cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the therapeutic treatment methods of the present invention involves the combined administration of an anti-CD22 antibody (or antibodies), anti-CD22 antibody drug conjugate(s) or oligopeptide(s) and one or more chemotherapeutic agents or growth inhibitory agents, including co-administration of cocktails of different chemotherapeutic agents. Chemotherapeutic agents include estramustine phosphate, prednimustine, cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, melphalan, cyclophosphamide, hydroxyurea and hydroxyureataxanes (such as paclitaxel and doxetaxel) and/or anthracycline antibiotics, as well as combinations of agents such as, but not limited to, CHOP or FOLFOX. Preparation and dosing schedules for such chemotherapeutic agents may be used according to manufacturers' instructions or as determined empirically by the skilled practitioner. Preparation and dosing schedules for such chemotherapy are also described in Chemotherapy Service Ed., M. C. Perry, Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore, Md. (1992).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibody is administered by any suitable means, including parenteral, topical, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intrapulmonary, intranasal, and/or intralesional administration. Parenteral infusions include intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous administration. Intrathecal administration is also contemplated (see, e.g., US Patent Appln No. 2002/0009444, Grillo-Lopez, A, concerning intrathecal delivery of a CD20 antibody). Preferably, the dosing is given intravenously or subcutaneously.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA second medicament may be administered with the initial exposure and/or later exposures of the therapeutic antibody or immunoadhesin, such combined administration includes co-administration, using separate formulations or a single pharmaceutical formulation, and consecutive administration in either order, wherein preferably there is a time period while both (or all) active agents simultaneously exert their biological activities.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile the therapeutic anti-CD22 antibody, anti-CD22 antibody drug conjugate, immunoadhesin or other biologic may be administered as a single-agent to treat the autoimmune disease, generally, the therapeutic antibody or immunoadhesin will be combined with one or more second medicament(s).

PTA-7620.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n2. Antibody Fragments\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention encompasses antibody fragments. Antibody fragments may be generated by traditional means, such as enzymatic digestion, or by recombinant techniques. In certain circumstances there are advantages of using antibody fragments, rather than whole antibodies. The smaller size of the fragments allows for rapid clearance, and may lead to improved access to solid tumors. For a review of certain antibody fragments, see Hudson et al. (2003) Nat. Med. 9:129-134.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious techniques have been developed for the production of antibody fragments. Traditionally, these fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies (see, e.g., Morimoto et al., Journal of Biochemical and Biophysical Methods 24:107-117 (1992); and Brennan et al., Science, 229:81 (1985)). However, these fragments can now be produced directly by recombinant host cells. Fab, Fv and ScFv antibody fragments can all be expressed in and secreted from \nE. coli\n, thus allowing the facile production of large amounts of these fragments. Antibody fragments can be isolated from the antibody phage libraries discussed above. Alternatively, Fab′-SH fragments can be directly recovered from \nE. coli \nand chemically coupled to form F(ab′)\n2 \nfragments (Carter et al., Bio/Technology 10:163-167 (1992)). According to another approach, F(ab′)\n2 \nfragments can be isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture. Fab and F(ab′)\n2 \nfragment with increased in vivo half-life comprising salvage receptor binding epitope residues are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,869,046. Other techniques for the production of antibody fragments will be apparent to the skilled practitioner. In certain embodiments, an antibody is a single chain Fv fragment (scFv). See WO 93/16185; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,571,894; and 5,587,458. Fv and scFv are the only species with intact combining sites that are devoid of constant regions; thus, they may be suitable for reduced nonspecific binding during in vivo use. scFv fusion proteins may be constructed to yield fusion of an effector protein at either the amino or the carboxy terminus of an scFv. See Antibody Engineering, ed. Borrebaeck, supra. The antibody fragment may also be a “linear antibody”, e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,870, for example. Such linear antibodies may be monospecific or bispecific.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n3. Humanized Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention encompasses humanized antibodies. Various methods for humanizing non-human antibodies are known in the art. For example, a humanized antibody can have one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source which is non-human. These non-human amino acid residues are often referred to as “import” residues, which are typically taken from an “import” variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co-workers (Jones et al. (1986) \nNature \n321:522-525; Riechmann et al. (1988) \nNature \n332:323-327; Verhoeyen et al. (1988) \nScience \n239:1534-1536), by substituting hypervariable region sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly, such “humanized” antibodies are chimeric antibodies (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567) wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non-human species. In practice, humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some hypervariable region residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe choice of human variable domains, both light and heavy, to be used in making the humanized antibodies can be important to reduce antigenicity. According to the so-called “best-fit” method, the sequence of the variable domain of a rodent antibody is screened against the entire library of known human variable-domain sequences. The human sequence which is closest to that of the rodent is then accepted as the human framework for the humanized antibody (Sims et al. (1993) \nJ. Immunol. \n151:2296; Chothia et al. (1987) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n196:901. Another method uses a particular framework derived from the consensus sequence of all human antibodies of a particular subgroup of light or heavy chains. The same framework may be used for several different humanized antibodies (Carter et al. (1992) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, \n89:4285; Presta et al. (1993) \nJ. Immunol., \n151:2623.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is further generally desirable that antibodies be humanized with retention of high affinity for the antigen and other favorable biological properties. To achieve this goal, according to one method, humanized antibodies are prepared by a process of analysis of the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized products using three-dimensional models of the parental and humanized sequences. Three-dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable three-dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence, i.e., the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way, FR residues can be selected and combined from the recipient and import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic, such as increased affinity for the target antigen(s), is achieved. In general, the hypervariable region residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n4. Human Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHuman anti-CD22 antibodies of the invention can be constructed by combining Fv clone variable domain sequence(s) selected from human-derived phage display libraries with known human constant domain sequences(s) as described above. Alternatively, human monoclonal anti-CD22 antibodies of the invention can be made by the hybridoma method. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines for the production of human monoclonal antibodies have been described, for example, by Kozbor J. Immunol., 133: 3001 (1984); Brodeur et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, pp. 51-63 (Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987); and Boerner et al., J. Immunol., 147: 86 (1991).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is now possible to produce transgenic animals (e.g. mice) that are capable, upon immunization, of producing a full repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production. For example, it has been described that the homozygous deletion of the antibody heavy-chain joining region (JH) gene in chimeric and germ-line mutant mice results in complete inhibition of endogenous antibody production. Transfer of the human germ-line immunoglobulin gene array in such germ-line mutant mice will result in the production of human antibodies upon antigen challenge. See, e.g., Jakobovits et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90: 2551 (1993); Jakobovits et al., Nature, 362: 255 (1993); Bruggermann et al., Year in Immunol., 7: 33 (1993).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGene shuffling can also be used to derive human antibodies from non-human, e.g. rodent, antibodies, where the human antibody has similar affinities and specificities to the starting non-human antibody. According to this method, which is also called “epitope imprinting”, either the heavy or light chain variable region of a non-human antibody fragment obtained by phage display techniques as described herein is replaced with a repertoire of human V domain genes, creating a population of non-human chain/human chain scFv or Fab chimeras. Selection with antigen results in isolation of a non-human chain/human chain chimeric scFv or Fab wherein the human chain restores the antigen binding site destroyed upon removal of the corresponding non-human chain in the primary phage display clone, i.e. the epitope governs (imprints) the choice of the human chain partner. When the process is repeated in order to replace the remaining non-human chain, a human antibody is obtained (see PCT WO 93/06213 published Apr. 1, 1993). Unlike traditional humanization of non-human antibodies by CDR grafting, this technique provides completely human antibodies, which have no FR or CDR residues of non-human origin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n5. Bispecific Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBispecific antibodies are monoclonal antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different antigens. In certain embodiments, bispecific antibodies are human or humanized antibodies. In certain embodiments, one of the binding specificities is for CD22 and the other is for any other antigen. In certain embodiments, bispecific antibodies may bind to two different epitopes of CD22. Bispecific antibodies may also be used to localize cytotoxic agents to cells which express CD22. These antibodies possess a CD22-binding arm and an arm which binds a cytotoxic agent, such as, e.g., saporin, anti-interferon-α, vinca alkaloid, ricin A chain, methotrexate or radioactive isotope hapten. Bispecific antibodies can be prepared as full length antibodies or antibody fragments (e.g. F(ab′)\n2 \nbispecific antibodies).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditionally, the recombinant production of bispecific antibodies is based on the co-expression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pairs, where the two heavy chains have different specificities (Milstein and Cuello, Nature, 305: 537 (1983)). Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, these hybridomas (quadromas) produce a potential mixture of 10 different antibody molecules, of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. The purification of the correct molecule, which is usually done by affinity chromatography steps, is rather cumbersome, and the product yields are low. Similar procedures are disclosed in WO 93/08829 published May 13, 1993, and in Traunecker et al., EMBO J., 10: 3655 (1991).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to a different approach, antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities (antibody-antigen combining sites) are fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. The fusion, for example, is with an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant domain, comprising at least part of the hinge, CH2, and CH3 regions. In certain embodiments, the first heavy-chain constant region (CH1), containing the site necessary for light chain binding, is present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and, if desired, the immunoglobulin light chain, are inserted into separate expression vectors, and are co-transfected into a suitable host organism. This provides for great flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction provide the optimum yields. It is, however, possible to insert the coding sequences for two or all three polypeptide chains in one expression vector when the expression of at least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios are of no particular significance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of this approach, the bispecific antibodies are composed of a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm, and a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pair (providing a second binding specificity) in the other arm. It was found that this asymmetric structure facilitates the separation of the desired bispecific compound from unwanted immunoglobulin chain combinations, as the presence of an immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of the bispecific molecule provides for a facile way of separation. This approach is disclosed in WO 94/04690. For further details of generating bispecific antibodies see, for example, Suresh et al., Methods in Enzymology, 121:210 (1986).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to another approach, the interface between a pair of antibody molecules can be engineered to maximize the percentage of heterodimers which are recovered from recombinant cell culture. The interface comprises at least a part of the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 domain of an antibody constant domain. In this method, one or more small amino acid side chains from the interface of the first antibody molecule are replaced with larger side chains (e.g. tyrosine or tryptophan). Compensatory “cavities” of identical or similar size to the large side chain(s) are created on the interface of the second antibody molecule by replacing large amino acid side chains with smaller ones (e.g. alanine or threonine). This provides a mechanism for increasing the yield of the heterodimer over other unwanted end-products such as homodimers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBispecific antibodies include cross-linked or “heteroconjugate” antibodies. For example, one of the antibodies in the heteroconjugate can be coupled to avidin, the other to biotin. Such antibodies have, for example, been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells (U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980), and for treatment of HIV infection (WO 91/00360, WO 92/00373, and EP 03089). Heteroconjugate antibodies may be made using any convenient cross-linking method. Suitable cross-linking agents are well known in the art, and are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980, along with a number of cross-linking techniques.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTechniques for generating bispecific antibodies from antibody fragments have also been described in the literature. For example, bispecific antibodies can be prepared using chemical linkage. Brennan et al., Science, 229: 81 (1985) describe a procedure wherein intact antibodies are proteolytically cleaved to generate F(ab′)\n2 \nfragments. These fragments are reduced in the presence of the dithiol complexing agent sodium arsenite to stabilize vicinal dithiols and prevent intermolecular disulfide formation. The Fab′ fragments generated are then converted to thionitrobenzoate (TNB) derivatives. One of the Fab′-TNB derivatives is then reconverted to the Fab′-thiol by reduction with mercaptoethylamine and is mixed with an equimolar amount of the other Fab′-TNB derivative to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibodies produced can be used as agents for the selective immobilization of enzymes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecent progress has facilitated the direct recovery of Fab′-SH fragments from \nE. coli\n, which can be chemically coupled to form bispecific antibodies. Shalaby et al., J. Exp. Med., 175: 217-225 (1992) describe the production of a fully humanized bispecific antibody F(ab′)\n2 \nmolecule. Each Fab′ fragment was separately secreted from \nE. coli \nand subjected to directed chemical coupling in vitro to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibody thus formed was able to bind to cells overexpressing the HER2 receptor and normal human T cells, as well as trigger the lytic activity of human cytotoxic lymphocytes against human breast tumor targets.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious techniques for making and isolating bispecific antibody fragments directly from recombinant cell culture have also been described. For example, bispecific antibodies have been produced using leucine zippers. Kostelny et al., J. Immunol., 148(5):1547-1553 (1992). The leucine zipper peptides from the Fos and Jun proteins were linked to the Fab′ portions of two different antibodies by gene fusion. The antibody homodimers were reduced at the hinge region to form monomers and then re-oxidized to form the antibody heterodimers. This method can also be utilized for the production of antibody homodimers. The “diabody” technology described by Hollinger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90:6444-6448 (1993) has provided an alternative mechanism for making bispecific antibody fragments. The fragments comprise a heavy-chain variable domain (VH) connected to a light-chain variable domain (VL) by a linker which is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain. Accordingly, the VH and VL domains of one fragment are forced to pair with the complementary VL and VH domains of another fragment, thereby forming two antigen-binding sites. Another strategy for making bispecific antibody fragments by the use of single-chain Fv (sFv) dimers has also been reported. See Gruber et al., J. Immunol., 152:5368 (1994).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies with more than two valencies are contemplated. For example, trispecific antibodies can be prepared. Tutt et al. J. Immunol. 147: 60 (1991).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n6. Multivalent Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA multivalent antibody may be internalized (and/or catabolized) faster than a bivalent antibody by a cell expressing an antigen to which the antibodies bind. The antibodies of the present invention can be multivalent antibodies (which are other than of the IgM class) with three or more antigen binding sites (e.g. tetravalent antibodies), which can be readily produced by recombinant expression of nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide chains of the antibody. The multivalent antibody can comprise a dimerization domain and three or more antigen binding sites. In certain embodiments, the dimerization domain comprises (or consists of) an Fc region or a hinge region. In this scenario, the antibody will comprise an Fc region and three or more antigen binding sites amino-terminal to the Fc region. In certain embodiments, a multivalent antibody comprises (or consists of) three to about eight antigen binding sites. In one such embodiment, a multivalent antibody comprises (or consists of) four antigen binding sites. The multivalent antibody comprises at least one polypeptide chain (for example, two polypeptide chains), wherein the polypeptide chain(s) comprise two or more variable domains. For instance, the polypeptide chain(s) may comprise VD1-(X1)n-VD2-(X2)n-Fc, wherein VD1 is a first variable domain, VD2 is a second variable domain, Fc is one polypeptide chain of an Fc region, X1 and X2 represent an amino acid or polypeptide, and n is 0 or 1. For instance, the polypeptide chain(s) may comprise: VH-CH1-flexible linker-VH-CH1-Fc region chain; or VH-CH1-VH-CH1-Fc region chain. The multivalent antibody herein may further comprise at least two (for example, four) light chain variable domain polypeptides. The multivalent antibody herein may, for instance, comprise from about two to about eight light chain variable domain polypeptides. The light chain variable domain polypeptides contemplated here comprise a light chain variable domain and, optionally, further comprise a CL domain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n7. Single-Domain Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, an antibody of the invention is a single-domain antibody. A single-domain antibody is a single polypeptide chain comprising all or a portion of the heavy chain variable domain or all or a portion of the light chain variable domain of an antibody. In certain embodiments, a single-domain antibody is a human single-domain antibody (Domantis, Inc., Waltham, Mass.; see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,248,516 B1). In one embodiment, a single-domain antibody consists of all or a portion of the heavy chain variable domain of an antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n8. Antibody Variants\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, amino acid sequence modification(s) of the antibodies described herein are contemplated. For example, it may be desirable to improve the binding affinity and/or other biological properties of the antibody. Amino acid sequence variants of the antibody may be prepared by introducing appropriate changes into the nucleotide sequence encoding the antibody, or by peptide synthesis. Such modifications include, for example, deletions from, and/or insertions into and/or substitutions of, residues within the amino acid sequences of the antibody. Any combination of deletion, insertion, and substitution can be made to arrive at the final construct, provided that the final construct possesses the desired characteristics. The amino acid alterations may be introduced in the subject antibody amino acid sequence at the time that sequence is made.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA useful method for identification of certain residues or regions of the antibody that are preferred locations for mutagenesis is called “alanine scanning mutagenesis” as described by Cunningham and Wells (1989) Science, 244:1081-1085. Here, a residue or group of target residues are identified (e.g., charged residues such as arg, asp, his, lys, and glu) and replaced by a neutral or negatively charged amino acid (e.g., alanine or polyalanine) to affect the interaction of the amino acids with antigen. Those amino acid locations demonstrating functional sensitivity to the substitutions then are refined by introducing further or other variants at, or for, the sites of substitution. Thus, while the site for introducing an amino acid sequence variation is predetermined, the nature of the mutation per se need not be predetermined. For example, to analyze the performance of a mutation at a given site, ala scanning or random mutagenesis is conducted at the target codon or region and the expressed immunoglobulins are screened for the desired activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmino acid sequence insertions include amino- and/or carboxyl-terminal fusions ranging in length from one residue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more residues, as well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Examples of terminal insertions include an antibody with an N-terminal methionyl residue. Other insertional variants of the antibody molecule include the fusion to the N- or C-terminus of the antibody to an enzyme (e.g. for ADEPT) or a polypeptide which increases the serum half-life of the antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, an antibody of the invention is altered to increase or decrease the extent to which the antibody is glycosylated. Glycosylation of polypeptides is typically either N-linked or O-linked. N-linked refers to the attachment of a carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The tripeptide sequences asparagine-X-serine and asparagine-X-threonine, where X is any amino acid except proline, are the recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. Thus, the presence of either of these tripeptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site. O-linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of one of the sugars N-aceylgalactosamine, galactose, or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid, most commonly serine or threonine, although 5-hydroxyproline or 5-hydroxylysine may also be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAddition or deletion of glycosylation sites to the antibody is conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that one or more of the above-described tripeptide sequences (for N-linked glycosylation sites) is created or removed. The alteration may also be made by the addition, deletion, or substitution of one or more serine or threonine residues to the sequence of the original antibody (for O-linked glycosylation sites).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere the antibody comprises an Fc region, the carbohydrate attached thereto may be altered. For example, antibodies with a mature carbohydrate structure that lacks fucose attached to an Fc region of the antibody are described in US Pat Appl No US 2003/0157108 (Presta, L.). See also \nUS\n 2004/0093621 (Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co., Ltd). Antibodies with a bisecting N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) in the carbohydrate attached to an Fc region of the antibody are referenced in WO 2003/011878, Jean-Mairet et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 6,602,684, Umana et al. Antibodies with at least one galactose residue in the oligosaccharide attached to an Fc region of the antibody are reported in WO 1997/30087, Patel et al. See, also, WO 1998/58964 (Raju, S.) and WO 1999/22764 (Raju, S.) concerning antibodies with altered carbohydrate attached to the Fc region thereof. See also US 2005/0123546 (Umana et al.) on antigen-binding molecules with modified glycosylation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, a glycosylation variant comprises an Fc region, wherein a carbohydrate structure attached to the Fc region lacks fucose. Such variants have improved ADCC function. Optionally, the Fc region further comprises one or more amino acid substitutions therein which further improve ADCC, for example, substitutions at positions 298, 333, and/or 334 of the Fc region (Eu numbering of residues). Examples of publications related to “defucosylated” or “fucose-deficient” antibodies include: US 2003/0157108; WO 2000/61739; WO 2001/29246; US 2003/0115614; US 2002/0164328; \nUS\n 2004/0093621; \nUS\n 2004/0132140; \nUS\n 2004/0110704; \nUS\n 2004/0110282; \nUS\n 2004/0109865; WO 2003/085119; WO 2003/084570; WO 2005/035586; WO 2005/035778; WO2005/053742; Okazaki et al. J. Mol. Biol. 336:1239-1249 (2004); Yamane-Ohnuki et al. Biotech. Bioeng. 87: 614 (2004). Examples of cell lines producing defucosylated antibodies include Lec13 CHO cells deficient in protein fucosylation (Ripka et al. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 249:533-545 (1986); US Pat Appl No US 2003/0157108 A1, Presta, L; and WO 2004/056312 A1, Adams et al., especially at Example 11), and knockout cell lines, such as alpha-1,6-fucosyltransferase gene, FUT8, knockout CHO cells (Yamane-Ohnuki et al. Biotech. Bioeng. 87: 614 (2004)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the antibody is altered to improve its serum half-life. To increase the serum half life of the antibody, one may incorporate a salvage receptor binding epitope into the antibody (especially an antibody fragment) as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,739,277, for example. As used herein, the term “salvage receptor binding epitope” refers to an epitope of the Fc region of an IgG molecule (e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4) that is responsible for increasing the in vivo serum half-life of the IgG molecule (US 2003/0190311, U.S. Pat. No. 6,821,505; U.S. Pat. No. 6,165,745; U.S. Pat. No. 5,624,821; U.S. Pat. No. 5,648,260; U.S. Pat. No. 6,165,745; U.S. Pat. No. 5,834,597).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother type of variant is an amino acid substitution variant. These variants have at least one amino acid residue in the antibody molecule replaced by a different residue. Sites of interest for substitutional mutagenesis include the hypervariable regions, but FR alterations are also contemplated. Conservative substitutions are shown in Table 1 under the heading of “preferred substitutions.” If such substitutions result in a desirable change in biological activity, then more substantial changes, denominated “exemplary substitutions” in Table 1, or as further described below in reference to amino acid classes, may be introduced and the products screened.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOriginal\n\n\nExemplary\n\n\nPreferred\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nResidue\n\n\nSubstitutions\n\n\nSubstitutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAla (A)\n\n\nVal; Leu; Ile\n\n\nVal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nArg (R)\n\n\nLys; Gln; Asn\n\n\nLys\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAsn (N)\n\n\nGln; His; Asp, Lys; Arg\n\n\nGln\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAsp (D)\n\n\nGlu; Asn\n\n\nGlu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCys (C)\n\n\nSer; Ala\n\n\nSer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGln (Q)\n\n\nAsn; Glu\n\n\nAsn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGlu (E)\n\n\nAsp; Gln\n\n\nAsp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGly (G)\n\n\nAla\n\n\nAla\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHis (H)\n\n\nAsn; Gln; Lys; Arg\n\n\nArg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIle (I)\n\n\nLeu; Val; Met; Ala;\n\n\nLeu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nPhe; Norleucine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLeu (L)\n\n\nNorleucine; Ile; Val;\n\n\nIle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMet; Ala; Phe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLys (K)\n\n\nArg; Gln; Asn\n\n\nArg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMet (M)\n\n\nLeu; Phe; Ile\n\n\nLeu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPhe (F)\n\n\nTrp; Leu; Val; Ile; Ala; Tyr\n\n\nTyr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPro (P)\n\n\nAla\n\n\nAla\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSer (S)\n\n\nThr\n\n\nThr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThr (T)\n\n\nVal; Ser\n\n\nSer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTrp (W)\n\n\nTyr; Phe\n\n\nTyr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTyr (Y)\n\n\nTrp; Phe; Thr; Ser\n\n\nPhe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nVal (V)\n\n\nIle; Leu; Met; Phe;\n\n\nLeu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAla; Norleucine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubstantial modifications in the biological properties of the antibody are accomplished by selecting substitutions that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining (a) the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitution, for example, as a sheet or helical conformation, (b) the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site, or (c) the bulk of the side chain. Amino acids may be grouped according to similarities in the properties of their side chains (in A. L. Lehninger, in Biochemistry, second ed., pp. 73-75, Worth Publishers, New York (1975)):\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(1) non-polar: Ala (A), Val (V), Leu (L), Ile (I), Pro (P), Phe (F), Trp (W), Met (M)\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(2) uncharged polar: Gly (G), Ser (S), Thr (T), Cys (C), Tyr (Y), Asn (N), Gln (Q)\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(3) acidic: Asp (D), Glu (E)\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(4) basic: Lys (K), Arg (R), His (H)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, naturally occurring residues may be divided into groups based on common side-chain properties:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(1) hydrophobic: Norleucine, Met, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(2) neutral hydrophilic: Cys, Ser, Thr, Asn, Gln;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(3) acidic: Asp, Glu;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(4) basic: His, Lys, Arg;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(5) residues that influence chain orientation: Gly, Pro;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(6) aromatic: Trp, Tyr, Phe.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for another class. Such substituted residues also may be introduced into the conservative substitution sites or, into the remaining (non-conserved) sites.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne type of substitutional variant involves substituting one or more hypervariable region residues of a parent antibody (e.g. a humanized or human antibody). Generally, the resulting variant(s) selected for further development will have modified (e.g., improved) biological properties relative to the parent antibody from which they are generated. A convenient way for generating such substitutional variants involves affinity maturation using phage display. Briefly, several hypervariable region sites (e.g. 6-7 sites) are mutated to generate all possible amino acid substitutions at each site. The antibodies thus generated are displayed from filamentous phage particles as fusions to at least part of a phage coat protein (e.g., the gene III product of M13) packaged within each particle. The phage-displayed variants are then screened for their biological activity (e.g. binding affinity). In order to identify candidate hypervariable region sites for modification, scanning mutagenesis (e.g., alanine scanning) can be performed to identify hypervariable region residues contributing significantly to antigen binding. Alternatively, or additionally, it may be beneficial to analyze a crystal structure of the antigen-antibody complex to identify contact points between the antibody and antigen. Such contact residues and neighboring residues are candidates for substitution according to techniques known in the art, including those elaborated herein. Once such variants are generated, the panel of variants is subjected to screening using techniques known in the art, including those described herein, and antibodies with superior properties in one or more relevant assays may be selected for further development.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acid molecules encoding amino acid sequence variants of the antibody are prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include, but are not limited to, isolation from a natural source (in the case of naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants) or preparation by oligonucleotide-mediated (or site-directed) mutagenesis, PCR mutagenesis, and cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared variant or a non-variant version of the antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt may be desirable to introduce one or more amino acid modifications in an Fc region of antibodies of the invention, thereby generating an Fc region variant. The Fc region variant may comprise a human Fc region sequence (e.g., a human IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4 Fc region) comprising an amino acid modification (e.g. a substitution) at one or more amino acid positions including that of a hinge cysteine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with this description and the teachings of the art, it is contemplated that in some embodiments, an antibody of the invention may comprise one or more alterations as compared to the wild type counterpart antibody, e.g. in the Fc region. These antibodies would nonetheless retain substantially the same characteristics required for therapeutic utility as compared to their wild type counterpart. For example, it is thought that certain alterations can be made in the Fc region that would result in altered (i.e., either improved or diminished) C1q binding and/or Complement Dependent Cytotoxicity (CDC), e.g., as described in WO99/51642. See also Duncan & Winter Nature 322:738-40 (1988); U.S. Pat. No. 5,648,260; U.S. Pat. No. 5,624,821; and WO94/29351 concerning other examples of Fc region variants. WO0/42072 (Presta) and WO 2004/056312 (Lowman) describe antibody variants with improved or diminished binding to FcRs. The content of these patent publications are specifically incorporated herein by reference. See, also, Shields et al. J. Biol. Chem. 9(2): 6591-6604 (2001). Antibodies with increased half lives and improved binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus (Guyer et al., J. Immunol. 117:587 (1976) and Kim et al., J. Immunol. 24:249 (1994)), are described in US2005/0014934A1 (Hinton et al.). These antibodies comprise an Fc region with one or more substitutions therein which improve binding of the Fc region to FcRn. Polypeptide variants with altered Fc region amino acid sequences and increased or decreased C1q binding capability are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,194,551B1, WO99/51642. The contents of those patent publications are specifically incorporated herein by reference. See, also, Idusogie et al. J. Immunol. 164: 4178-4184 (2000).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention provides antibodies comprising modifications in the interface of Fc polypeptides comprising the Fc region, wherein the modifications facilitate and/or promote heterodimerization. These modifications comprise introduction of a protuberance into a first Fc polypeptide and a cavity into a second Fc polypeptide, wherein the protuberance is positionable in the cavity so as to promote complexing of the first and second Fc polypeptides. Methods of generating antibodies with these modifications are known in the art, e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,731,168.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n9. Antibody Derivatives\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies of the present invention can be further modified to contain additional nonproteinaceous moieties that are known in the art and readily available. Preferably, the moieties suitable for derivatization of the antibody are water soluble polymers. Non-limiting examples of water soluble polymers include, but are not limited to, polyethylene glycol (PEG), copolymers of ethylene glycol/propylene glycol, carboxymethylcellulose, dextran, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, poly-1,3-dioxolane, poly-1,3,6-trioxane, ethylene/maleic anhydride copolymer, polyaminoacids (either homopolymers or random copolymers), and dextran or poly(n-vinyl pyrrolidone)polyethylene glycol, propropylene glycol homopolymers, prolypropylene oxide/ethylene oxide co-polymers, polyoxyethylated polyols (e.g., glycerol), polyvinyl alcohol, and mixtures thereof. Polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde may have advantages in manufacturing due to its stability in water. The polymer may be of any molecular weight, and may be branched or unbranched. The number of polymers attached to the antibody may vary, and if more than one polymer are attached, they can be the same or different molecules. In general, the number and/or type of polymers used for derivatization can be determined based on considerations including, but not limited to, the particular properties or functions of the antibody to be improved, whether the antibody derivative will be used in a therapy under defined conditions, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, conjugates of an antibody and nonproteinaceous moiety that may be selectively heated by exposure to radiation are provided. In one embodiment, the nonproteinaceous moiety is a carbon nanotube (Kam et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 102: 11600-11605 (2005)). The radiation may be of any wavelength, and includes, but is not limited to, wavelengths that do not harm ordinary cells, but which heat the nonproteinaceous moiety to a temperature at which cells proximal to the antibody-nonproteinaceous moiety are killed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain Methods of Making Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \n \n1. Certain Hybridoma-Based Methods\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-CD22 monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be made using the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al., Nature, 256:495 (1975), or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the hybridoma method, a mouse or other appropriate host animal, such as a hamster, is immunized to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the protein used for immunization. Antibodies to CD22 generally are raised in animals by multiple subcutaneous (sc) or intraperitoneal (ip) injections of CD22 and an adjuvant. CD22 may be prepared using methods well-known in the art, some of which are further described herein. For example, CD22 may be produced recombinantly. In one embodiment, animals are immunized with a derivative of CD22 that contains an extracellular portion of CD22 fused to the Fc portion of an immunoglobulin heavy chain. In one embodiment, animals are immunized with an CD22-IgG1 fusion protein. In one embodiment, animals are immunized with immunogenic derivatives of CD22 in a solution with monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL)/trehalose dicorynomycolate (TDM) (Ribi Immunochem. Research, Inc., Hamilton, Mont.), and the solution is injected intradermally at multiple sites. Two weeks later the animals are boosted. Seven to fourteen days later the animals are bled, and the serum is assayed for anti-CD22 titer. Animals are boosted until titer plateaus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, lymphocytes may be immunized in vitro. Lymphocytes then are fused with myeloma cells using a suitable fusing agent, such as polyethylene glycol, to form a hybridoma cell (Goding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, pp. 59-103 (Academic Press, 1986)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe hybridoma cells thus prepared are seeded and grown in a suitable culture medium, e.g., a medium that contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused, parental myeloma cells. For example, if the parental myeloma cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (HAT medium), which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, myeloma cells are those that fuse efficiently, support stable high-level production of antibody by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. Exemplary myeloma cells include, but are not limited to, murine myeloma lines, such as those derived from MOPC-21 and MPC-11 mouse tumors available from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, Calif. USA, and SP-2 or X63-Ag8-653 cells available from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Md. USA. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies (Kozbor, J. Immunol., 133:3001 (1984); Brodeur et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, pp. 51-63 (Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCulture medium in which hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production of monoclonal antibodies that bind to CD22. Preferably, the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA). The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can, for example, be determined by the Scatchard analysis of Munson et al., Anal. Biochem., 107:220 (1980).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter hybridoma cells are identified that produce antibodies of the desired specificity, affinity, and/or activity, the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods (Goding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, pp. 59-103 (Academic Press, 1986)). Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, D-MEM or RPMI-1640 medium. In addition, the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites tumors in an animal. Monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones are suitably separated from the culture medium, ascites fluid, or serum by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as, for example, protein A-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, or affinity chromatography.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n2. Certain Library Screening Methods\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-CD22 antibodies of the invention can be made by using combinatorial libraries to screen for antibodies with the desired activity or activities. For example, a variety of methods are known in the art for generating phage display libraries and screening such libraries for antibodies possessing the desired binding characteristics. Such methods are described generally in Hoogenboom et al. (2001) in Methods in Molecular Biology 178:1-37 (O'Brien et al., ed., Human Press, Totowa, N.J.), and in certain embodiments, in Lee et al. (2004) J. Mol. Biol. 340:1073-1093.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn principle, synthetic antibody clones are selected by screening phage libraries containing phage that display various fragments of antibody variable region (Fv) fused to phage coat protein. Such phage libraries are panned by affinity chromatography against the desired antigen. Clones expressing Fv fragments capable of binding to the desired antigen are adsorbed to the antigen and thus separated from the non-binding clones in the library. The binding clones are then eluted from the antigen, and can be further enriched by additional cycles of antigen adsorption/elution. Any of the anti-CD22 antibodies of the invention can be obtained by designing a suitable antigen screening procedure to select for the phage clone of interest followed by construction of a full length anti-CD22 antibody clone using the Fv sequences from the phage clone of interest and suitable constant region (Fc) sequences described in Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, NIH Publication 91-3242, Bethesda Md. (1991), vols. 1-3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the antigen-binding domain of an antibody is formed from two variable (V) regions of about 110 amino acids, one each from the light (VL) and heavy (VH) chains, that both present three hypervariable loops (HVRs) or complementarity-determining regions (CDRs). Variable domains can be displayed functionally on phage, either as single-chain Fv (scFv) fragments, in which VH and VL are covalently linked through a short, flexible peptide, or as Fab fragments, in which they are each fused to a constant domain and interact non-covalently, as described in Winter et al., Ann. Rev. Immunol., 12: 433-455 (1994). As used herein, scFv encoding phage clones and Fab encoding phage clones are collectively referred to as “Fv phage clones” or “Fv clones.”\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRepertoires of VH and VL genes can be separately cloned by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and recombined randomly in phage libraries, which can then be searched for antigen-binding clones as described in Winter et al., Ann. Rev. Immunol., 12: 433-455 (1994). Libraries from immunized sources provide high-affinity antibodies to the immunogen without the requirement of constructing hybridomas. Alternatively, the naive repertoire can be cloned to provide a single source of human antibodies to a wide range of non-self and also self antigens without any immunization as described by Griffiths et al., EMBO J, 12: 725-734 (1993). Finally, naive libraries can also be made synthetically by cloning the unrearranged V-gene segments from stem cells, and using PCR primers containing random sequence to encode the highly variable CDR3 regions and to accomplish rearrangement in vitro as described by Hoogenboom and Winter, J. Mol. Biol., 227: 381-388 (1992).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, filamentous phage is used to display antibody fragments by fusion to the minor coat protein pIII. The antibody fragments can be displayed as single chain Fv fragments, in which VH and VL domains are connected on the same polypeptide chain by a flexible polypeptide spacer, e.g. as described by Marks et al., J. Mol. Biol., 222: 581-597 (1991), or as Fab fragments, in which one chain is fused to pIII and the other is secreted into the bacterial host cell periplasm where assembly of a Fab-coat protein structure which becomes displayed on the phage surface by displacing some of the wild type coat proteins, e.g. as described in Hoogenboom et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 19: 4133-4137 (1991).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, nucleic acids encoding antibody gene fragments are obtained from immune cells harvested from humans or animals. If a library biased in favor of anti-CD22 clones is desired, the subject is immunized with CD22 to generate an antibody response, and spleen cells and/or circulating B cells other peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) are recovered for library construction. In a preferred embodiment, a human antibody gene fragment library biased in favor of anti-CD22 clones is obtained by generating an anti-CD22 antibody response in transgenic mice carrying a functional human immunoglobulin gene array (and lacking a functional endogenous antibody production system) such that CD22 immunization gives rise to B cells producing human antibodies against CD22. The generation of human antibody-producing transgenic mice is described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional enrichment for anti-CD22 reactive cell populations can be obtained by using a suitable screening procedure to isolate B cells expressing CD22-specific membrane bound antibody, e.g., by cell separation using CD22 affinity chromatography or adsorption of cells to fluorochrome-labeled CD22 followed by flow-activated cell sorting (FACS).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the use of spleen cells and/or B cells or other PBLs from an unimmunized donor provides a better representation of the possible antibody repertoire, and also permits the construction of an antibody library using any animal (human or non-human) species in which CD22 is not antigenic. For libraries incorporating in vitro antibody gene construction, stem cells are harvested from the subject to provide nucleic acids encoding unrearranged antibody gene segments. The immune cells of interest can be obtained from a variety of animal species, such as human, mouse, rat, lagomorpha, luprine, canine, feline, porcine, bovine, equine, and avian species, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acid encoding antibody variable gene segments (including VH and VL segments) are recovered from the cells of interest and amplified. In the case of rearranged VH and VL gene libraries, the desired DNA can be obtained by isolating genomic DNA or mRNA from lymphocytes followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers matching the 5′ and 3′ ends of rearranged VH and VL genes as described in Orlandi et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA), 86: 3833-3837 (1989), thereby making diverse V gene repertoires for expression. The V genes can be amplified from cDNA and genomic DNA, with back primers at the 5′ end of the exon encoding the mature V-domain and forward primers based within the J-segment as described in Orlandi et al. (1989) and in Ward et al., Nature, 341: 544-546 (1989). However, for amplifying from cDNA, back primers can also be based in the leader exon as described in Jones et al., Biotechnol., 9: 88-89 (1991), and forward primers within the constant region as described in Sastry et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA), 86: 5728-5732 (1989). To maximize complementarity, degeneracy can be incorporated in the primers as described in Orlandi et al. (1989) or Sastry et al. (1989). In certain embodiments, library diversity is maximized by using PCR primers targeted to each V-gene family in order to amplify all available VH and VL arrangements present in the immune cell nucleic acid sample, e.g. as described in the method of Marks et al., J. Mol. Biol., 222: 581-597 (1991) or as described in the method of Orum et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 21: 4491-4498 (1993). For cloning of the amplified DNA into expression vectors, rare restriction sites can be introduced within the PCR primer as a tag at one end as described in Orlandi et al. (1989), or by further PCR amplification with a tagged primer as described in Clackson et al., Nature, 352: 624-628 (1991).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRepertoires of synthetically rearranged V genes can be derived in vitro from V gene segments. Most of the human VH-gene segments have been cloned and sequenced (reported in Tomlinson et al., J. Mol. Biol., 227: 776-798 (1992)), and mapped (reported in Matsuda et al., Nature Genet., 3: 88-94 (1993); these cloned segments (including all the major conformations of the H1 and H2 loop) can be used to generate diverse VH gene repertoires with PCR primers encoding H3 loops of diverse sequence and length as described in Hoogenboom and Winter, J. Mol. Biol., 227: 381-388 (1992). VH repertoires can also be made with all the sequence diversity focused in a long H3 loop of a single length as described in Barbas et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89: 4457-4461 (1992). Human Vκ and Vλ segments have been cloned and sequenced (reported in Williams and Winter, Eur. J. Immunol., 23: 1456-1461 (1993)) and can be used to make synthetic light chain repertoires. Synthetic V gene repertoires, based on a range of VH and VL folds, and L3 and H3 lengths, will encode antibodies of considerable structural diversity. Following amplification of V-gene encoding DNAs, germline V-gene segments can be rearranged in vitro according to the methods of Hoogenboom and Winter, J. Mol. Biol., 227: 381-388 (1992).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRepertoires of antibody fragments can be constructed by combining VH and VL gene repertoires together in several ways. Each repertoire can be created in different vectors, and the vectors recombined in vitro, e.g., as described in Hogrefe et al., Gene, 128: 119-126 (1993), or in vivo by combinatorial infection, e.g., the loxP system described in Waterhouse et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 21: 2265-2266 (1993). The in vivo recombination approach exploits the two-chain nature of Fab fragments to overcome the limit on library size imposed by \nE. coli \ntransformation efficiency. Naive VH and VL repertoires are cloned separately, one into a phagemid and the other into a phage vector. The two libraries are then combined by phage infection of phagemid-containing bacteria so that each cell contains a different combination and the library size is limited only by the number of cells present (about 10\n12 \nclones). Both vectors contain in vivo recombination signals so that the VH and VL genes are recombined onto a single replicon and are co-packaged into phage virions. These huge libraries provide large numbers of diverse antibodies of good affinity (K\nd\n \n−1 \nof about 10\n−8 \nM).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the repertoires may be cloned sequentially into the same vector, e.g. as described in Barbas et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 88: 7978-7982 (1991), or assembled together by PCR and then cloned, e.g. as described in Clackson et al., Nature, 352: 624-628 (1991). PCR assembly can also be used to join VH and VL DNAs with DNA encoding a flexible peptide spacer to form single chain Fv (scFv) repertoires. In yet another technique, “in cell PCR assembly” is used to combine VH and VL genes within lymphocytes by PCR and then clone repertoires of linked genes as described in Embleton et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 20: 3831-3837 (1992).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies produced by naive libraries (either natural or synthetic) can be of moderate affinity (K\nd\n \n−1 \nof about 10\n6 \nto 10\n7 \nM\n−1\n), but affinity maturation can also be mimicked in vitro by constructing and reselecting from secondary libraries as described in Winter et al. (1994), supra. For example, mutation can be introduced at random in vitro by using error-prone polymerase (reported in Leung et al., Technique, 1: 11-15 (1989)) in the method of Hawkins et al., J. Mol. Biol., 226: 889-896 (1992) or in the method of Gram et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89: 3576-3580 (1992). Additionally, affinity maturation can be performed by randomly mutating one or more CDRs, e.g. using PCR with primers carrying random sequence spanning the CDR of interest, in selected individual Fv clones and screening for higher affinity clones. WO 9607754 (published 14 Mar. 1996) described a method for inducing mutagenesis in a complementarity determining region of an immunoglobulin light chain to create a library of light chain genes. Another effective approach is to recombine the VH or VL domains selected by phage display with repertoires of naturally occurring V domain variants obtained from unimmunized donors and screen for higher affinity in several rounds of chain reshuffling as described in Marks et al., Biotechnol., 10: 779-783 (1992). This technique allows the production of antibodies and antibody fragments with affinities of about 10\n−9 \nM or less.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nScreening of the libraries can be accomplished by various techniques known in the art. For example, CD22 can be used to coat the wells of adsorption plates, expressed on host cells affixed to adsorption plates or used in cell sorting, or conjugated to biotin for capture with streptavidin-coated beads, or used in any other method for panning phage display libraries.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phage library samples are contacted with immobilized CD22 under conditions suitable for binding at least a portion of the phage particles with the adsorbent. Normally, the conditions, including pH, ionic strength, temperature and the like are selected to mimic physiological conditions. The phages bound to the solid phase are washed and then eluted by acid, e.g. as described in Barbas et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 88: 7978-7982 (1991), or by alkali, e.g. as described in Marks et al., J. Mol. Biol., 222: 581-597 (1991), or by CD22 antigen competition, e.g. in a procedure similar to the antigen competition method of Clackson et al., Nature, 352: 624-628 (1991). Phages can be enriched 20-1,000-fold in a single round of selection. Moreover, the enriched phages can be grown in bacterial culture and subjected to further rounds of selection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe efficiency of selection depends on many factors, including the kinetics of dissociation during washing, and whether multiple antibody fragments on a single phage can simultaneously engage with antigen. Antibodies with fast dissociation kinetics (and weak binding affinities) can be retained by use of short washes, multivalent phage display and high coating density of antigen in solid phase. The high density not only stabilizes the phage through multivalent interactions, but favors rebinding of phage that has dissociated. The selection of antibodies with slow dissociation kinetics (and good binding affinities) can be promoted by use of long washes and monovalent phage display as described in Bass et al., Proteins, 8: 309-314 (1990) and in WO 92/09690, and a low coating density of antigen as described in Marks et al., Biotechnol., 10: 779-783 (1992).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is possible to select between phage antibodies of different affinities, even with affinities that differ slightly, for CD22. However, random mutation of a selected antibody (e.g. as performed in some affinity maturation techniques) is likely to give rise to many mutants, most binding to antigen, and a few with higher affinity. With limiting CD22, rare high affinity phage could be competed out. To retain all higher affinity mutants, phages can be incubated with excess biotinylated CD22, but with the biotinylated CD22 at a concentration of lower molarity than the target molar affinity constant for CD22. The high affinity-binding phages can then be captured by streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads. Such “equilibrium capture” allows the antibodies to be selected according to their affinities of binding, with sensitivity that permits isolation of mutant clones with as little as two-fold higher affinity from a great excess of phages with lower affinity. Conditions used in washing phages bound to a solid phase can also be manipulated to discriminate on the basis of dissociation kinetics.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-CD22 clones may be selected based on activity. In certain embodiments, the invention provides anti-CD22 antibodies that bind to living cells that naturally express CD22. In one embodiment, the invention provides anti-CD22 antibodies that block the binding between a CD22 ligand and CD22, but do not block the binding between a CD22 ligand and a second protein. Fv clones corresponding to such anti-CD22 antibodies can be selected by (1) isolating anti-CD22 clones from a phage library as described above, and optionally amplifying the isolated population of phage clones by growing up the population in a suitable bacterial host; (2) selecting CD22 and a second protein against which blocking and non-blocking activity, respectively, is desired; (3) adsorbing the anti-CD22 phage clones to immobilized CD22; (4) using an excess of the second protein to elute any undesired clones that recognize CD22-binding determinants which overlap or are shared with the binding determinants of the second protein; and (5) eluting the clones which remain adsorbed following step (4). Optionally, clones with the desired blocking/non-blocking properties can be further enriched by repeating the selection procedures described herein one or more times.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDNA encoding hybridoma-derived monoclonal antibodies or phage display Fv clones of the invention is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g. by using oligonucleotide primers designed to specifically amplify the heavy and light chain coding regions of interest from hybridoma or phage DNA template). Once isolated, the DNA can be placed into expression vectors, which are then transfected into host cells such as \nE. coli \ncells, simian COS cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein, to obtain the synthesis of the desired monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells. Review articles on recombinant expression in bacteria of antibody-encoding DNA include Skerra et al., Curr. Opinion in Immunol., 5: 256 (1993) and Pluckthun, Immunol. Revs, 130: 151 (1992).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDNA encoding the Fv clones of the invention can be combined with known DNA sequences encoding heavy chain and/or light chain constant regions (e.g. the appropriate DNA sequences can be obtained from Kabat et al., supra) to form clones encoding full or partial length heavy and/or light chains. It will be appreciated that constant regions of any isotype can be used for this purpose, including IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, and IgE constant regions, and that such constant regions can be obtained from any human or animal species. An Fv clone derived from the variable domain DNA of one animal (such as human) species and then fused to constant region DNA of another animal species to form coding sequence(s) for “hybrid,” full length heavy chain and/or light chain is included in the definition of “chimeric” and “hybrid” antibody as used herein. In certain embodiments, an Fv clone derived from human variable DNA is fused to human constant region DNA to form coding sequence(s) for full- or partial-length human heavy and/or light chains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDNA encoding anti-CD22 antibody derived from a hybridoma of the invention can also be modified, for example, by substituting the coding sequence for human heavy- and light-chain constant domains in place of homologous murine sequences derived from the hybridoma clone (e.g. as in the method of Morrison et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 81: 6851-6855 (1984)). DNA encoding a hybridoma- or Fv clone-derived antibody or fragment can be further modified by covalently joining to the immunoglobulin coding sequence all or part of the coding sequence for a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide. In this manner, “chimeric” or “hybrid” antibodies are prepared that have the binding specificity of the Fv clone or hybridoma clone-derived antibodies of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n3. Vectors, Host Cells, and Recombinant Methods\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor recombinant production of an antibody of the invention, the nucleic acid encoding it is isolated and inserted into a replicable vector for further cloning (amplification of the DNA) or for expression. DNA encoding the antibody is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the antibody). Many vectors are available. The choice of vector depends in part on the host cell to be used. Generally, host cells are of either prokaryotic or eukaryotic (generally mammalian) origin. It will be appreciated that constant regions of any isotype can be used for this purpose, including IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, and IgE constant regions, and that such constant regions can be obtained from any human or animal species.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerating Antibodies Using Prokaryotic Host Cells:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVector Construction\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolynucleotide sequences encoding polypeptide components of the antibody of the invention can be obtained using standard recombinant techniques. Desired polynucleotide sequences may be isolated and sequenced from antibody producing cells such as hybridoma cells. Alternatively, polynucleotides can be synthesized using nucleotide synthesizer or PCR techniques. Once obtained, sequences encoding the polypeptides are inserted into a recombinant vector capable of replicating and expressing heterologous polynucleotides in prokaryotic hosts. Many vectors that are available and known in the art can be used for the purpose of the present invention. Selection of an appropriate vector will depend mainly on the size of the nucleic acids to be inserted into the vector and the particular host cell to be transformed with the vector. Each vector contains various components, depending on its function (amplification or expression of heterologous polynucleotide, or both) and its compatibility with the particular host cell in which it resides. The vector components generally include, but are not limited to: an origin of replication, a selection marker gene, a promoter, a ribosome binding site (RBS), a signal sequence, the heterologous nucleic acid insert and a transcription termination sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, plasmid vectors containing replicon and control sequences which are derived from species compatible with the host cell are used in connection with these hosts. The vector ordinarily carries a replication site, as well as marking sequences which are capable of providing phenotypic selection in transformed cells. For example, \nE. coli \nis typically transformed using pBR322, a plasmid derived from an \nE. coli \nspecies. pBR322 contains genes encoding ampicillin (Amp) and tetracycline (Tet) resistance and thus provides easy means for identifying transformed cells. pBR322, its derivatives, or other microbial plasmids or bacteriophage may also contain, or be modified to contain, promoters which can be used by the microbial organism for expression of endogenous proteins. Examples of pBR322 derivatives used for expression of particular antibodies are described in detail in Carter et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,648,237.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, phage vectors containing replicon and control sequences that are compatible with the host microorganism can be used as transforming vectors in connection with these hosts. For example, bacteriophage such as λGEM.TM.-11 may be utilized in making a recombinant vector which can be used to transform susceptible host cells such as \nE. coli \nLE392.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe expression vector of the invention may comprise two or more promoter-cistron pairs, encoding each of the polypeptide components. A promoter is an untranslated regulatory sequence located upstream (5′) to a cistron that modulates its expression. Prokaryotic promoters typically fall into two classes, inducible and constitutive. Inducible promoter is a promoter that initiates increased levels of transcription of the cistron under its control in response to changes in the culture condition, e.g. the presence or absence of a nutrient or a change in temperature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA large number of promoters recognized by a variety of potential host cells are well known. The selected promoter can be operably linked to cistron DNA encoding the light or heavy chain by removing the promoter from the source DNA via restriction enzyme digestion and inserting the isolated promoter sequence into the vector of the invention. Both the native promoter sequence and many heterologous promoters may be used to direct amplification and/or expression of the target genes. In some embodiments, heterologous promoters are utilized, as they generally permit greater transcription and higher yields of expressed target gene as compared to the native target polypeptide promoter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPromoters suitable for use with prokaryotic hosts include the PhoA promoter, the β-galactamase and lactose promoter systems, a tryptophan (trp) promoter system and hybrid promoters such as the tac or the trc promoter. However, other promoters that are functional in bacteria (such as other known bacterial or phage promoters) are suitable as well. Their nucleotide sequences have been published, thereby enabling a skilled worker operably to ligate them to cistrons encoding the target light and heavy chains (Siebenlist et al. (1980) Cell 20: 269) using linkers or adaptors to supply any required restriction sites.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect of the invention, each cistron within the recombinant vector comprises a secretion signal sequence component that directs translocation of the expressed polypeptides across a membrane. In general, the signal sequence may be a component of the vector, or it may be a part of the target polypeptide DNA that is inserted into the vector. The signal sequence selected for the purpose of this invention should be one that is recognized and processed (i.e. cleaved by a signal peptidase) by the host cell. For prokaryotic host cells that do not recognize and process the signal sequences native to the heterologous polypeptides, the signal sequence is substituted by a prokaryotic signal sequence selected, for example, from the group consisting of the alkaline phosphatase, penicillinase, Ipp, or heat-stable enterotoxin II (STII) leaders, LamB, PhoE, PelB, OmpA and MBP. In one embodiment of the invention, the signal sequences used in both cistrons of the expression system are STII signal sequences or variants thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the production of the immunoglobulins according to the invention can occur in the cytoplasm of the host cell, and therefore does not require the presence of secretion signal sequences within each cistron. In that regard, immunoglobulin light and heavy chains are expressed, folded and assembled to form functional immunoglobulins within the cytoplasm. Certain host strains (e.g., the \nE. coli \ntrxB− strains) provide cytoplasm conditions that are favorable for disulfide bond formation, thereby permitting proper folding and assembly of expressed protein subunits. Proba and Pluckthun Gene, 159:203 (1995).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies of the invention can also be produced by using an expression system in which the quantitative ratio of expressed polypeptide components can be modulated in order to maximize the yield of secreted and properly assembled antibodies of the invention. Such modulation is accomplished at least in part by simultaneously modulating translational strengths for the polypeptide components.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne technique for modulating translational strength is disclosed in Simmons et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,840,523. It utilizes variants of the translational initiation region (TIR) within a cistron. For a given TIR, a series of amino acid or nucleic acid sequence variants can be created with a range of translational strengths, thereby providing a convenient means by which to adjust this factor for the desired expression level of the specific chain. TIR variants can be generated by conventional mutagenesis techniques that result in codon changes which can alter the amino acid sequence. In certain embodiments, changes in the nucleotide sequence are silent. Alterations in the TIR can include, for example, alterations in the number or spacing of Shine-Dalgarno sequences, along with alterations in the signal sequence. One method for generating mutant signal sequences is the generation of a “codon bank” at the beginning of a coding sequence that does not change the amino acid sequence of the signal sequence (i.e., the changes are silent). This can be accomplished by changing the third nucleotide position of each codon; additionally, some amino acids, such as leucine, serine, and arginine, have multiple first and second positions that can add complexity in making the bank. This method of mutagenesis is described in detail in Yansura et al. (1992) METHODS: A Companion to Methods in Enzymol. 4:151-158.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, a set of vectors is generated with a range of TIR strengths for each cistron therein. This limited set provides a comparison of expression levels of each chain as well as the yield of the desired antibody products under various TIR strength combinations. TIR strengths can be determined by quantifying the expression level of a reporter gene as described in detail in Simmons et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,840,523. Based on the translational strength comparison, the desired individual TIRs are selected to be combined in the expression vector constructs of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProkaryotic host cells suitable for expressing antibodies of the invention include Archaebacteria and Eubacteria, such as Gram-negative or Gram-positive organisms. Examples of useful bacteria include \nEscherichia \n(e.g., \nE. coli\n), Bacilli (e.g., \nB. subtilis\n), Enterobacteria, \nPseudomonas \nspecies (e.g., \nP. aeruginosa\n), \nSalmonella typhimurium, Serratia marcescans, Klebsiella, Proteus, Shigella, Rhizobia, Vitreoscilla\n, or \nParacoccus\n. In one embodiment, gram-negative cells are used. In one embodiment, \nE. coli \ncells are used as hosts for the invention. Examples of \nE. coli \nstrains include strain W3110 (Bachmann, Cellular and Molecular Biology, vol. 2 (Washington, D.C.: American Society for Microbiology, 1987), pp. 1190-1219; ATCC Deposit No. 27,325) and derivatives thereof, including strain 33D3 having genotype W3110 ΔfhuA (ΔtonA) ptr3 lac Iq lacL8 ΔompTΔ(nmpc-fepE) degP41 kanR (U.S. Pat. No. 5,639,635). Other strains and derivatives thereof, such as \nE. coli \n294 (ATCC 31,446), \nE. coli \nB, \nE. coliλ \n1776 (ATCC 31,537) and \nE. coli \nRV308 (ATCC 31,608) are also suitable. These examples are illustrative rather than limiting. Methods for constructing derivatives of any of the above-mentioned bacteria having defined genotypes are known in the art and described in, for example, Bass et al., Proteins, 8:309-314 (1990). It is generally necessary to select the appropriate bacteria taking into consideration replicability of the replicon in the cells of a bacterium. For example, \nE. coli, Serratia\n, or \nSalmonella \nspecies can be suitably used as the host when well known plasmids such as pBR322, pBR325, pACYC177, or pKN410 are used to supply the replicon. Typically the host cell should secrete minimal amounts of proteolytic enzymes, and additional protease inhibitors may desirably be incorporated in the cell culture.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody Production\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHost cells are transformed with the above-described expression vectors and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters, selecting transformants, or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTransformation means introducing DNA into the prokaryotic host so that the DNA is replicable, either as an extrachromosomal element or by chromosomal integrant. Depending on the host cell used, transformation is done using standard techniques appropriate to such cells. The calcium treatment employing calcium chloride is generally used for bacterial cells that contain substantial cell-wall barriers. Another method for transformation employs polyethylene glycol/DMSO. Yet another technique used is electroporation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProkaryotic cells used to produce the polypeptides of the invention are grown in media known in the art and suitable for culture of the selected host cells. Examples of suitable media include luria broth (LB) plus necessary nutrient supplements. In some embodiments, the media also contains a selection agent, chosen based on the construction of the expression vector, to selectively permit growth of prokaryotic cells containing the expression vector. For example, ampicillin is added to media for growth of cells expressing ampicillin resistant gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny necessary supplements besides carbon, nitrogen, and inorganic phosphate sources may also be included at appropriate concentrations introduced alone or as a mixture with another supplement or medium such as a complex nitrogen source. Optionally the culture medium may contain one or more reducing agents selected from the group consisting of glutathione, cysteine, cystamine, thioglycollate, dithioerythritol and dithiothreitol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe prokaryotic host cells are cultured at suitable temperatures. In certain embodiments, for \nE. coli \ngrowth, growth temperatures range from about 20° C. to about 39° C.; from about 25° C. to about 37° C.; or about 30° C. The pH of the medium may be any pH ranging from about 5 to about 9, depending mainly on the host organism. In certain embodiments, for \nE. coli\n, the pH is from about 6.8 to about 7.4, or about 7.0.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf an inducible promoter is used in the expression vector of the invention, protein expression is induced under conditions suitable for the activation of the promoter. In one aspect of the invention, PhoA promoters are used for controlling transcription of the polypeptides. Accordingly, the transformed host cells are cultured in a phosphate-limiting medium for induction. In certain embodiments, the phosphate-limiting medium is the C.R.A.P. medium (see, e.g., Simmons et al., J. Immunol. Methods (2002), 263:133-147). A variety of other inducers may be used, according to the vector construct employed, as is known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the expressed polypeptides of the present invention are secreted into and recovered from the periplasm of the host cells. Protein recovery typically involves disrupting the microorganism, generally by such means as osmotic shock, sonication or lysis. Once cells are disrupted, cell debris or whole cells may be removed by centrifugation or filtration. The proteins may be further purified, for example, by affinity resin chromatography. Alternatively, proteins can be transported into the culture media and isolated therein. Cells may be removed from the culture and the culture supernatant being filtered and concentrated for further purification of the proteins produced. The expressed polypeptides can be further isolated and identified using commonly known methods such as polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and Western blot assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect of the invention, antibody production is conducted in large quantity by a fermentation process. Various large-scale fed-batch fermentation procedures are available for production of recombinant proteins. Large-scale fermentations have at least 1000 liters of capacity, and in certain embodiments, about 1,000 to 100,000 liters of capacity. These fermentors use agitator impellers to distribute oxygen and nutrients, especially glucose (the preferred carbon/energy source). Small scale fermentation refers generally to fermentation in a fermentor that is no more than approximately 100 liters in volumetric capacity, and can range from about 1 liter to about 100 liters.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a fermentation process, induction of protein expression is typically initiated after the cells have been grown under suitable conditions to a desired density, e.g., an OD550 of about 180-220, at which stage the cells are in the early stationary phase. A variety of inducers may be used, according to the vector construct employed, as is known in the art and described above. Cells may be grown for shorter periods prior to induction. Cells are usually induced for about 12-50 hours, although longer or shorter induction time may be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo improve the production yield and quality of the polypeptides of the invention, various fermentation conditions can be modified. For example, to improve the proper assembly and folding of the secreted antibody polypeptides, additional vectors overexpressing chaperone proteins, such as Dsb proteins (DsbA, DsbB, DsbC, DsbD and or DsbG) or FkpA (a peptidylprolyl cis,trans-isomerase with chaperone activity) can be used to co-transform the host prokaryotic cells. The chaperone proteins have been demonstrated to facilitate the proper folding and solubility of heterologous proteins produced in bacterial host cells. Chen et al. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274:19601-19605; Georgiou et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,083,715; Georgiou et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,027,888; Bothmann and Pluckthun (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275:17100-17105; Ramm and Pluckthun (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275:17106-17113; Arie et al. (2001) Mol. Microbiol. 39:199-210.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo minimize proteolysis of expressed heterologous proteins (especially those that are proteolytically sensitive), certain host strains deficient for proteolytic enzymes can be used for the present invention. For example, host cell strains may be modified to effect genetic mutation(s) in the genes encoding known bacterial proteases such as Protease III, OmpT, DegP, Tsp, Protease I, Protease Mi, Protease V, Protease VI and combinations thereof. Some \nE. coli \nprotease-deficient strains are available and described in, for example, Joly et al. (1998), supra; Georgiou et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,264,365; Georgiou et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,508,192; Hara et al., Microbial Drug Resistance, 2:63-72 (1996).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, \nE. coli \nstrains deficient for proteolytic enzymes and transformed with plasmids overexpressing one or more chaperone proteins are used as host cells in the expression system of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody Purification\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the antibody protein produced herein is further purified to obtain preparations that are substantially homogeneous for further assays and uses. Standard protein purification methods known in the art can be employed. The following procedures are exemplary of suitable purification procedures: fractionation on immunoaffinity or ion-exchange columns, ethanol precipitation, reverse phase HPLC, chromatography on silica or on a cation-exchange resin such as DEAE, chromatofocusing, SDS-PAGE, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and gel filtration using, for example, Sephadex G-75.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, Protein A immobilized on a solid phase is used for immunoaffinity purification of the antibody products of the invention. Protein A is a 41 kD cell wall protein from \nStaphylococcus aureas \nwhich binds with a high affinity to the Fc region of antibodies. Lindmark et al (1983) J. Immunol. Meth. 62:1-13. The solid phase to which Protein A is immobilized can be a column comprising a glass or silica surface, or a controlled pore glass column or a silicic acid column. In some applications, the column is coated with a reagent, such as glycerol, to possibly prevent nonspecific adherence of contaminants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs the first step of purification, a preparation derived from the cell culture as described above can be applied onto a Protein A immobilized solid phase to allow specific binding of the antibody of interest to Protein A. The solid phase would then be washed to remove contaminants non-specifically bound to the solid phase. Finally the antibody of interest is recovered from the solid phase by elution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerating Antibodies Using Eukaryotic Host Cells:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA vector for use in a eukaryotic host cell generally includes one or more of the following non-limiting components: a signal sequence, an origin of replication, one or more marker genes, an enhancer element, a promoter, and a transcription termination sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSignal Sequence Component\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA vector for use in a eukaryotic host cell may also contain a signal sequence or other polypeptide having a specific cleavage site at the N-terminus of the mature protein or polypeptide of interest. The heterologous signal sequence selected may be one that is recognized and processed (i.e., cleaved by a signal peptidase) by the host cell. In mammalian cell expression, mammalian signal sequences as well as viral secretory leaders, for example, the herpes simplex gD signal, are available. The DNA for such a precursor region is ligated in reading frame to DNA encoding the antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOrigin of Replication\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, an origin of replication component is not needed for mammalian expression vectors. For example, the SV40 origin may typically be used only because it contains the early promoter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSelection Gene Component\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExpression and cloning vectors may contain a selection gene, also termed a selectable marker. Typical selection genes encode proteins that (a) confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins, e.g., ampicillin, neomycin, methotrexate, or tetracycline, (b) complement auxotrophic deficiencies, where relevant, or (c) supply critical nutrients not available from complex media.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne example of a selection scheme utilizes a drug to arrest growth of a host cell. Those cells that are successfully transformed with a heterologous gene produce a protein conferring drug resistance and thus survive the selection regimen. Examples of such dominant selection use the drugs neomycin, mycophenolic acid and hygromycin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother example of suitable selectable markers for mammalian cells are those that enable the identification of cells competent to take up the antibody nucleic acid, such as DHFR, thymidine kinase, metallothionein-I and -II, preferably primate metallothionein genes, adenosine deaminase, ornithine decarboxylase, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, in some embodiments, cells transformed with the DHFR selection gene are first identified by culturing all of the transformants in a culture medium that contains methotrexate (Mtx), a competitive antagonist of DHFR. In some embodiments, an appropriate host cell when wild-type DHFR is employed is the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line deficient in DHFR activity (e.g., ATCC CRL-9096).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, host cells (particularly wild-type hosts that contain endogenous DHFR) transformed or co-transformed with DNA sequences encoding an antibody, wild-type DHFR protein, and another selectable marker such as \naminoglycoside\n 3′-phosphotransferase (APH) can be selected by cell growth in medium containing a selection agent for the selectable marker such as an aminoglycosidic antibiotic, e.g., kanamycin, neomycin, or G418. See U.S. Pat. No. 4,965,199.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPromoter Component\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExpression and cloning vectors usually contain a promoter that is recognized by the host organism and is operably linked to nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide of interest (e.g., an antibody). Promoter sequences are known for eukaryotes. For example, virtually all eukaryotic genes have an AT-rich region located approximately 25 to 30 bases upstream from the site where transcription is initiated. Another sequence found 70 to 80 bases upstream from the start of transcription of many genes is a CNCAAT region where N may be any nucleotide. At the 3′ end of most eukaryotic genes is an AATAAA sequence that may be the signal for addition of the poly A tail to the 3′ end of the coding sequence. In certain embodiments, any or all of these sequences may be suitably inserted into eukaryotic expression vectors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTranscription from vectors in mammalian host cells is controlled, for example, by promoters obtained from the genomes of viruses such as polyoma virus, fowlpox virus, adenovirus (such as Adenovirus 2), bovine papilloma virus, avian sarcoma virus, cytomegalovirus, a retrovirus, hepatitis-B virus and Simian Virus 40 (SV40), from heterologous mammalian promoters, e.g., the actin promoter or an immunoglobulin promoter, from heat-shock promoters, provided such promoters are compatible with the host cell systems.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe early and late promoters of the SV40 virus are conveniently obtained as an SV40 restriction fragment that also contains the SV40 viral origin of replication. The immediate early promoter of the human cytomegalovirus is conveniently obtained as a HindIII E restriction fragment. A system for expressing DNA in mammalian hosts using the bovine papilloma virus as a vector is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,419,446. A modification of this system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,601,978. See also Reyes et al., Nature 297:598-601 (1982), describing expression of human β-interferon cDNA in mouse cells under the control of a thymidine kinase promoter from herpes simplex virus. Alternatively, the Rous Sarcoma Virus long terminal repeat can be used as the promoter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnhancer Element Component\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTranscription of DNA encoding an antibody of this invention by higher eukaryotes is often increased by inserting an enhancer sequence into the vector. Many enhancer sequences are now known from mammalian genes (globin, elastase, albumin, α-fetoprotein, and insulin). Typically, however, one will use an enhancer from a eukaryotic cell virus. Examples include the SV40 enhancer on the late side of the replication origin (bp 100-270), the cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer, the polyoma enhancer on the late side of the replication origin, and adenovirus enhancers. See also Yaniv, Nature 297:17-18 (1982) describing enhancer elements for activation of eukaryotic promoters. The enhancer may be spliced into the vector at a \nposition\n 5′ or 3′ to the antibody polypeptide-encoding sequence, but is generally located at a \nsite\n 5′ from the promoter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTranscription Termination Component\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExpression vectors used in eukaryotic host cells may also contain sequences necessary for the termination of transcription and for stabilizing the mRNA. Such sequences are commonly available from the 5′ and, occasionally 3′, untranslated regions of eukaryotic or viral DNAs or cDNAs. These regions contain nucleotide segments transcribed as polyadenylated fragments in the untranslated portion of the mRNA encoding an antibody. One useful transcription termination component is the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation region. See WO94/11026 and the expression vector disclosed therein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSelection and Transformation of Host Cells\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable host cells for cloning or expressing the DNA in the vectors herein include higher eukaryote cells described herein, including vertebrate host cells. Propagation of vertebrate cells in culture (tissue culture) has become a routine procedure. Examples of useful mammalian host cell lines are monkey kidney CV1 line transformed by SV40 (COS-7, ATCC CRL 1651); human embryonic kidney line (293 or 293 cells subcloned for growth in suspension culture, Graham et al., J. Gen Virol. 36:59 (1977)); baby hamster kidney cells (BHK, ATCC CCL 10); Chinese hamster ovary cells/−DHFR (CHO, Urlaub et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77:4216 (1980)); mouse sertoli cells (TM4, Mather, Biol. Reprod. 23:243-251 (1980)); monkey kidney cells (CV1 ATCC CCL 70); African green monkey kidney cells (VERO-76, ATCC CRL-1587); human cervical carcinoma cells (HELA, ATCC CCL 2); canine kidney cells (MDCK, ATCC CCL 34); buffalo rat liver cells (BRL 3A, ATCC CRL 1442); human lung cells (\nWI\n 38, ATCC CCL 75); human liver cells (Hep G2, HB 8065); mouse mammary tumor (MMT 060562, ATCC CCL51); TRI cells (Mather et al., Annals N.Y. Acad. Sci. 383:44-68 (1982)); \nMRC\n 5 cells; FS4 cells; and a human hepatoma line (Hep G2).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHost cells are transformed with the above-described expression or cloning vectors for antibody production and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters, selecting transformants, or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCulturing the Host Cells\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe host cells used to produce an antibody of this invention may be cultured in a variety of media. Commercially available media such as Ham's F10 (Sigma), Minimal Essential Medium ((MEM), (Sigma), RPMI-1640 (Sigma), and Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium ((DMEM), Sigma) are suitable for culturing the host cells. In addition, any of the media described in Ham et al., Meth. Enz. 58:44 (1979), Barnes et al., Anal. Biochem. 102:255 (1980), U.S. Pat. No. 4,767,704; 4,657,866; 4,927,762; 4,560,655; or 5,122,469; WO 90/03430; WO 87/00195; or U.S. Pat. No. Re. 30,985 may be used as culture media for the host cells. Any of these media may be supplemented as necessary with hormones and/or other growth factors (such as insulin, transferrin, or epidermal growth factor), salts (such as sodium chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate), buffers (such as HEPES), nucleotides (such as adenosine and thymidine), antibiotics (such as GENTAMYCIN™ drug), trace elements (defined as inorganic compounds usually present at final concentrations in the micromolar range), and glucose or an equivalent energy source. Any other supplements may also be included at appropriate concentrations that would be known to those skilled in the art. The culture conditions, such as temperature, pH, and the like, are those previously used with the host cell selected for expression, and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPurification of Antibody\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen using recombinant techniques, the antibody can be produced intracellularly, or directly secreted into the medium. If the antibody is produced intracellularly, as a first step, the particulate debris, either host cells or lysed fragments, may be removed, for example, by centrifugation or ultrafiltration. Where the antibody is secreted into the medium, supernatants from such expression systems may be first concentrated using a commercially available protein concentration filter, for example, an Amicon or Millipore Pellicon ultrafiltration unit. A protease inhibitor such as PMSF may be included in any of the foregoing steps to inhibit proteolysis, and antibiotics may be included to prevent the growth of adventitious contaminants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibody composition prepared from the cells can be purified using, for example, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, and affinity chromatography, with affinity chromatography being a convenient technique. The suitability of protein A as an affinity ligand depends on the species and isotype of any immunoglobulin Fc domain that is present in the antibody. Protein A can be used to purify antibodies that are based on human γ1, γ2, or γ4 heavy chains (Lindmark et al., J. Immunol. Methods 62:1-13 (1983)). Protein G is recommended for all mouse isotypes and for human γ3 (Guss et al., EMBO J. 5:15671575 (1986)). The matrix to which the affinity ligand is attached may be agarose, but other matrices are available. Mechanically stable matrices such as controlled pore glass or poly(styrenedivinyl)benzene allow for faster flow rates and shorter processing times than can be achieved with agarose. Where the antibody comprises a CH3 domain, the Bakerbond ABX™ resin (J. T. Baker, Phillipsburg, N.J.) is useful for purification. Other techniques for protein purification such as fractionation on an ion-exchange column, ethanol precipitation, Reverse Phase HPLC, chromatography on silica, chromatography on heparin SEPHAROSE™ chromatography on an anion or cation exchange resin (such as a polyaspartic acid column), chromatofocusing, SDS-PAGE, and ammonium sulfate precipitation are also available depending on the antibody to be recovered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing any preliminary purification step(s), the mixture comprising the antibody of interest and contaminants may be subjected to further purification, for example, by low pH hydrophobic interaction chromatography using an elution buffer at a pH between about 2.5-4.5, preferably performed at low salt concentrations (e.g., from about 0-0.25M salt).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, various methodologies for preparing antibodies for use in research, testing, and clinical use are well-established in the art, consistent with the above-described methodologies and/or as deemed appropriate by one skilled in the art for a particular antibody of interest.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmunoconjugates\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides immunoconjugates (interchangeably referred to as “antibody-drug conjugates,” or “ADCs”) comprising any of the anti-CD22 antibodies of the invention conjugated to one or more cytotoxic agents, such as a chemotherapeutic agent, a drug, a growth inhibitory agent, a toxin (e.g., an enzymatically active toxin of bacterial, fungal, plant, or animal origin, or fragments thereof), or a radioactive isotope (i.e., a radioconjugate).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, an immunoconjugate comprises an anti-CD22 antibody and a chemotherapeutic agent or other toxin. Chemotherapeutic agents useful in the generation of immunoconjugates are described herein (e.g., above). Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof can also be used and are described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, an immunoconjugate comprises an anti-CD22 antibody and one or more small molecule toxins, including, but not limited to, small molecule drugs such as a calicheamicin, maytansinoid, dolastatin, auristatin, trichothecene, and CC1065, and the derivatives of these drugs that have cytotoxic activity. Examples of such immunoconjugates are discussed in further detail below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n1. Exemplary Immunoconjugates—Antibody Drug Conjugates\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn immunoconjugate (or “antibody-drug conjugate” (“ADC”)) of the invention may be of Formula I, below, wherein an anti-CD22 antibody is conjugated (i.e., covalently attached) to one or more drug moieties (D) through an optional linker (L).\n\n\n \n \n \nAb-(L-D)\np\n  Formula I\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, the anti-CD22 antibody may be conjugated to the drug either directly or via a linker. In Formula I, p is the average number of drug moieties per antibody, which can range, e.g., from about 1 to about 20 drug moieties per antibody, and in certain embodiments, from 1 to about 8 drug moieties per antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary Linkers\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary linkers and drug moieties are disclosed herein. A linker may comprise one or more linker components. Exemplary linker components include 6-maleimidocaproyl (“MC”), maleimidopropanoyl (“MP”), valine-citrulline (“val-cit” or “vc”), alanine-phenylalanine (“ala-phe”), p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl (a “PAB”), N-Succinimidyl 4-(2-pyridylthio) pentanoate (“SPP”), N-succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1 carboxylate (“SMCC”), and N-Succinimidyl (4-iodo-acetyl)aminobenzoate (“SIAB”). Various linker components are known in the art, some of which are described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA linker may be a “cleavable linker,” facilitating release of a drug in the cell. For example, an acid-labile linker (e.g., hydrazone), protease-sensitive (e.g., peptidase-sensitive) linker, photolabile linker, dimethyl linker or disulfide-containing linker (Chari et al., Cancer Research 52:127-131 (1992); U.S. Pat. No. 5,208,020) may be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a linker component may comprise a “stretcher unit” that links an antibody to another linker component or to a drug moiety. Exemplary stretcher units are shown below (wherein the wavy line indicates sites of covalent attachment to an antibody):\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a linker component may comprise an amino acid unit. In one such embodiment, the amino acid unit allows for cleavage of the linker by a protease, thereby facilitating release of the drug from the immunoconjugate upon exposure to intracellular proteases, such as lysosomal enzymes. See, e.g., Doronina et al. (2003) Nat. Biotechnol. 21:778-784. Exemplary amino acid units include, but are not limited to, a dipeptide, a tripeptide, a tetrapeptide, and a pentapeptide. Exemplary dipeptides include: valine-citrulline (vc or val-cit), alanine-phenylalanine (af or ala-phe); phenylalanine-lysine (fk or phe-lys); or N-methyl-valine-citrulline (Me-val-cit). Exemplary tripeptides include: glycine-valine-citrulline (gly-val-cit) and glycine-glycine-glycine (gly-gly-gly). An amino acid unit may comprise amino acid residues that occur naturally, as well as minor amino acids and non-naturally occurring amino acid analogs, such as citrulline. Amino acid units can be designed and optimized in their selectivity for enzymatic cleavage by a particular enzyme, for example, a tumor-associated protease, cathepsin B, C and D, or a plasmin protease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a linker component may comprise a “spacer” unit that links the antibody to a drug moiety, either directly or by way of a stretcher unit and/or an amino acid unit. A spacer unit may be “self-immolative” or a “non-self-immolative.” A “non-self-immolative” spacer unit is one in which part or all of the spacer unit remains bound to the drug moiety upon enzymatic (e.g., proteolytic) cleavage of the ADC. Examples of non-self-immolative spacer units include, but are not limited to, a glycine spacer unit and a glycine-glycine spacer unit. Other combinations of peptidic spacers susceptible to sequence-specific enzymatic cleavage are also contemplated. For example, enzymatic cleavage of an ADC containing a glycine-glycine spacer unit by a tumor-cell associated protease would result in release of a glycine-glycine-drug moiety from the remainder of the ADC. In one such embodiment, the glycine-glycine-drug moiety is then subjected to a separate hydrolysis step in the tumor cell, thus cleaving the glycine-glycine spacer unit from the drug moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “self-immolative” spacer unit allows for release of the drug moiety without a separate hydrolysis step. In certain embodiments, a spacer unit of a linker comprises a p-aminobenzyl unit. In one such embodiment, a p-aminobenzyl alcohol is attached to an amino acid unit via an amide bond, and a carbamate, methylcarbamate, or carbonate is made between the benzyl alcohol and a cytotoxic agent. See, e.g., Hamann et al. (2005) Expert Opin. Ther. Patents (2005) 15:1087-1103. In one embodiment, the spacer unit is p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl (PAB). In certain embodiments, the phenylene portion of a p-amino benzyl unit is substituted with Qm, wherein Q is —C\n1\n-C\n8 \nalkyl, —O—(C\n1\n-C\n8 \nalkyl), -halogen, -nitro or -cyano; and m is an integer ranging from 0-4. Examples of self-immolative spacer units further include, but are not limited to, aromatic compounds that are electronically similar to p-aminobenzyl alcohol (see, e.g., US 2005/0256030 A1), such as 2-aminoimidazol-5-methanol derivatives (Hay et al. (1999) Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 9:2237) and ortho- or para-aminobenzylacetals. Spacers can be used that undergo cyclization upon amide bond hydrolysis, such as substituted and unsubstituted 4-aminobutyric acid amides (Rodrigues et al., Chemistry Biology, 1995, 2, 223); appropriately substituted bicyclo[2.2.1] and bicyclo[2.2.2] ring systems (Storm, et al., J.

Elimination of amine-containing drugs that are substituted at the a-position of glycine (Kingsbury, et al., J. Med.

Maytansinoids are mitototic inhibitors which act by inhibiting tubulin polymerization. Maytansine was first isolated from the east African shrub \nMaytenus serrata \n(U.S. Pat. No. 3,896,111). Subsequently, it was discovered that certain microbes also produce maytansinoids, such as maytansinol and C-3 maytansinol esters (U.S. Pat. No. 4,151,042). Synthetic maytansinol and derivatives and analogues thereof are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,137,230; 4,248,870; 4,256,746; 4,260,608; 4,265,814; 4,294,757; 4,307,016; 4,308,268; 4,308,269; 4,309,428; 4,313,946; 4,315,929; 4,317,821; 4,322,348; 4,331,598; 4,361,650; 4,364,866; 4,424,219; 4,450,254; 4,362,663; and 4,371,533.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMaytansinoid drug moieties are attractive drug moieties in antibody-drug conjugates because they are: (i) relatively accessible to prepare by fermentation or chemical modification or derivatization of fermentation products, (ii) amenable to derivatization with functional groups suitable for conjugation through non-disulfide linkers to antibodies, (iii) stable in plasma, and (iv) effective against a variety of tumor cell lines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMaytansine compounds suitable for use as maytansinoid drug moieties are well known in the art and can be isolated from natural sources according to known methods or produced using genetic engineering techniques (see Yu et al (2002) PNAS 99:7968-7973).

Nos. 5,635,483; 5,780,588). Dolastatins and auristatins have been shown to interfere with microtubule dynamics, GTP hydrolysis, and nuclear and cellular division (Woyke et al (2001) Antimicrob. Agents and Chemother. 45(12):3580-3584) and have anticancer (U.S. Pat. No. 5,663,149) and antifungal activity (Pettit et al (1998) Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 42:2961-2965).

(2006) Bioconjugate Chem. 17:114-124, which is expressly incorporated herein by reference. Exemplary embodiments of ADCs of Formula I comprising MMAE or MMAF and various linker components have the following structures and abbreviations (wherein “Ab” is an antibody; p is 1 to about 8, “Val-Cit” is a valine-citrulline dipeptide; and “S” is a sulfur atom:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary embodiments of ADCs of Formula I comprising MMAF and various linker components further include Ab-MC-PAB-MMAF and Ab-PAB-MMAF.

See, Doronina et al. (2006) Bioconjugate Chem. 17:114-124. In such instances, drug release is believed to be effected by antibody degradation in the cell. Id.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypically, peptide-based drug moieties can be prepared by forming a peptide bond between two or more amino acids and/or peptide fragments. Such peptide bonds can be prepared, for example, according to the liquid phase synthesis method (see E. Schröder and K. Lübke, “The Peptides”, \nvolume\n 1, pp 76-136, 1965, Academic Press) that is well known in the field of peptide chemistry. Auristatin/dolastatin drug moieties may be prepared according to the methods of: US 2005-0238649 A1; U.S. Pat. No. 5,635,483; U.S. Pat. No. 5,780,588; Pettit et al (1989) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 111:5463-5465; Pettit et al (1998) Anti-Cancer Drug Design 13:243-277; Pettit, G. R., et al. Synthesis, 1996, 719-725; Pettit et al (1996) J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1 5:859-863; and Doronina (2003) Nat. Biotechnol. 21(7):778-784.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular, auristatin/dolastatin drug moieties of formula D\nF\n, such as MMAF and derivatives thereof, may be prepared using methods described in US 2005-0238649 A1 and Doronina et al. (2006) Bioconjugate Chem. 17:114-124. Auristatin/dolastatin drug moieties of formula D\nE\n, such as MMAE and derivatives thereof, may be prepared using methods described in Doronina et al. (2003) Nat. Biotech. 21:778-784. Drug-linker moieties MC-MMAF, MC-MMAE, MC-vc-PAB-MMAF, and MC-vc-PAB-MMAE may be conveniently synthesized by routine methods, e.g., as described in Doronina et al. (2003) Nat. Biotech. 21:778-784, and Patent Application Publication No. US 2005/0238649 A1, and then conjugated to an antibody of interest.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDrug Loading\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDrug loading is represented by p and is the average number of drug moieties per antibody in a molecule of Formula I. Drug loading may range from 1 to 20 drug moieties (D) per antibody. ADCs of Formula I include collections of antibodies conjugated with a range of drug moieties, from 1 to 20. The average number of drug moieties per antibody in preparations of ADC from conjugation reactions may be characterized by conventional means such as mass spectroscopy, ELISA assay, and HPLC. The quantitative distribution of ADC in terms of p may also be determined. In some instances, separation, purification, and characterization of homogeneous ADC where p is a certain value from ADC with other drug loadings may be achieved by means such as reverse phase HPLC or electrophoresis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor some antibody-drug conjugates, p may be limited by the number of attachment sites on the antibody. For example, where the attachment is a cysteine thiol, as in the exemplary embodiments above, an antibody may have only one or several cysteine thiol groups, or may have only one or several sufficiently reactive thiol groups through which a linker may be attached. In certain embodiments, higher drug loading, e.g. p>5, may cause aggregation, insolubility, toxicity, or loss of cellular permeability of certain antibody-drug conjugates. In certain embodiments, the drug loading for an ADC of the invention ranges from 1 to about 8; from about 2 to about 6; from about 3 to about 5; from about 3 to about 4; from about 3.1 to about 3.9; from about 3.2 to about 3.8; from about 3.2 to about 3.7; from about 3.2 to about 3.6; from about 3.3 to about 3.8; or from about 3.3 to about 3.7. Indeed, it has been shown that for certain ADCs, the optimal ratio of drug moieties per antibody may be less than 8, and may be about 2 to about 5. See US 2005-0238649 A1 (herein incorporated by reference in its entirety).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, fewer than the theoretical maximum of drug moieties are conjugated to an antibody during a conjugation reaction. An antibody may contain, for example, lysine residues that do not react with the drug-linker intermediate or linker reagent, as discussed below. Only the most reactive lysine groups may react with an amine-reactive linker reagent. Generally, antibodies do not contain many free and reactive cysteine thiol groups which may be linked to a drug moiety; indeed most cysteine thiol residues in antibodies exist as disulfide bridges. In certain embodiments, an antibody may be reduced with a reducing agent such as dithiothreitol (DTT) or tricarbonylethylphosphine (TCEP), under partial or total reducing conditions, to generate reactive cysteine thiol groups. In certain embodiments, an antibody is subjected to denaturing conditions to reveal reactive nucleophilic groups such as lysine or cysteine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe loading (drug/antibody ratio) of an ADC may be controlled in different ways, e.g., by: (i) limiting the molar excess of drug-linker intermediate or linker reagent relative to antibody, (ii) limiting the conjugation reaction time or temperature, (iii) partial or limiting reductive conditions for cysteine thiol modification, (iv) engineering by recombinant techniques the amino acid sequence of the antibody such that the number and position of cysteine residues is modified for control of the number and/or position of linker-drug attachments (such as thioMab or thioFab prepared as disclosed herein and in WO2006/034488 (herein incorporated by reference in its entirety)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is to be understood that where more than one nucleophilic group reacts with a drug-linker intermediate or linker reagent followed by drug moiety reagent, then the resulting product is a mixture of ADC compounds with a distribution of one or more drug moieties attached to an antibody. The average number of drugs per antibody may be calculated from the mixture by a dual ELISA antibody assay, which is specific for antibody and specific for the drug. Individual ADC molecules may be identified in the mixture by mass spectroscopy and separated by HPLC, e.g. hydrophobic interaction chromatography (see, e.g., Hamblett, K. J., et al. “Effect of drug loading on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity of an anti-CD30 antibody-drug conjugate,” Abstract No. 624, American Association for Cancer Research, 2004 Annual Meeting, Mar. 27-31, 2004, Proceedings of the AACR, \nVolume\n 45, March 2004; Alley, S. C., et al. “Controlling the location of drug attachment in antibody-drug conjugates,” Abstract No. 627, American Association for Cancer Research, 2004 Annual Meeting, Mar. 27-31, 2004, Proceedings of the AACR, \nVolume\n 45, March 2004). In certain embodiments, a homogeneous ADC with a single loading value may be isolated from the conjugation mixture by electrophoresis or chromatography.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain Methods of Preparing Immunoconjugates\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn ADC of Formula I may be prepared by several routes employing organic chemistry reactions, conditions, and reagents known to those skilled in the art, including: (1) reaction of a nucleophilic group of an antibody with a bivalent linker reagent to form Ab-L via a covalent bond, followed by reaction with a drug moiety D; and (2) reaction of a nucleophilic group of a drug moiety with a bivalent linker reagent, to form D-L, via a covalent bond, followed by reaction with a nucleophilic group of an antibody. Exemplary methods for preparing an ADC of Formula I via the latter route are described in US 20050238649 A1, which is expressly incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleophilic groups on antibodies include, but are not limited to: (i) N-terminal amine groups, (ii) side chain amine groups, e.g. lysine, (iii) side chain thiol groups, e.g. cysteine, and (iv) sugar hydroxyl or amino groups where the antibody is glycosylated. Amine, thiol, and hydroxyl groups are nucleophilic and capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including: (i) active esters such as NHS esters, HOBt esters, haloformates, and acid halides; (ii) alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides; (iii) aldehydes, ketones, carboxyl, and maleimide groups. Certain antibodies have reducible interchain disulfides, i.e. cysteine bridges. Antibodies may be made reactive for conjugation with linker reagents by treatment with a reducing agent such as DTT (dithiothreitol) or tricarbonylethylphosphine (TCEP), such that the antibody is fully or partially reduced. Each cysteine bridge will thus form, theoretically, two reactive thiol nucleophiles. Alternatively, sulfhydryl groups can be introduced into antibodies through modification of lysine residues, e.g., by reacting lysine residues with 2-iminothiolane (Traut's reagent), resulting in conversion of an amine into a thiol. Reactive thiol groups may be introduced into an antibody by introducing one, two, three, four, or more cysteine residues (e.g., by preparing variant antibodies comprising one or more non-native cysteine amino acid residues).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody-drug conjugates of the invention may also be produced by reaction between an electrophilic group on an antibody, such as an aldehyde or ketone carbonyl group, with a nucleophilic group on a linker reagent or drug. Useful nucleophilic groups on a linker reagent include, but are not limited to, hydrazide, oxime, amino, hydrazine, thiosemicarbazone, hydrazine carboxylate, and arylhydrazide. In one embodiment, an antibody is modified to introduce electrophilic moieties that are capable of reacting with nucleophilic subsituents on the linker reagent or drug. In another embodiment, the sugars of glycosylated antibodies may be oxidized, e.g. with periodate oxidizing reagents, to form aldehyde or ketone groups which may react with the amine group of linker reagents or drug moieties. The resulting imine Schiff base groups may form a stable linkage, or may be reduced, e.g. by borohydride reagents to form stable amine linkages. In one embodiment, reaction of the carbohydrate portion of a glycosylated antibody with either galactose oxidase or sodium meta-periodate may yield carbonyl (aldehyde and ketone) groups in the antibody that can react with appropriate groups on the drug (Hermanson, Bioconjugate Techniques). In another embodiment, antibodies containing N-terminal serine or threonine residues can react with sodium meta-periodate, resulting in production of an aldehyde in place of the first amino acid (Geoghegan & Stroh, (1992) Bioconjugate Chem. 3:138-146; U.S. Pat. No. 5,362,852). Such an aldehyde can be reacted with a drug moiety or linker nucleophile.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleophilic groups on a drug moiety include, but are not limited to: amine, thiol, hydroxyl, hydrazide, oxime, hydrazine, thiosemicarbazone, hydrazine carboxylate, and arylhydrazide groups capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including: (i) active esters such as NHS esters, HOBt esters, haloformates, and acid halides; (ii) alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides; (iii) aldehydes, ketones, carboxyl, and maleimide groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention expressly contemplate, but are not limited to, ADC prepared with the following cross-linker reagents: BMPS, EMCS, GMBS, HBVS, LC-SMCC, MBS, MPBH, SBAP, SIA, SIAB, SMCC, SMPB, SMPH, sulfo-EMCS, sulfo-GMBS, sulfo-KMUS, sulfo-MBS, sulfo-SIAB, sulfo-SMCC, and sulfo-SMPB, and SVSB (succinimidyl-(4-vinylsulfone)benzoate) which are commercially available (e.g., from Pierce Biotechnology, Inc., Rockford, Ill., U.S.A; see pages 467-498, 2003-2004 Applications Handbook and Catalog.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmunoconjugates comprising an antibody and a cytotoxic agent may also be made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionate (SPDP), succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC), iminothiolane (IT), bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters (such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl), active esters (such as disuccinimidyl suberate), aldehydes (such as glutaraldehyde), bis-azido compounds (such as bis(p-azidobenzoyl) hexanediamine), bis-diazonium derivatives (such as bis-(p-diazoniumbenzoyl)-ethylenediamine), diisocyanates (such as \ntoluene\n 2,6-diisocyanate), and bis-active fluorine compounds (such as 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene). For example, a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al., Science 238:1098 (1987). Carbon-14-labeled 1-isothiocyanatobenzyl-3-methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid (MX-DTPA) is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See WO94/11026.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, a fusion protein comprising an antibody and a cytotoxic agent may be made, e.g., by recombinant techniques or peptide synthesis. A recombinant DNA molecule may comprise regions encoding the antibody and cytotoxic portions of the conjugate either adjacent to one another or separated by a region encoding a linker peptide which does not destroy the desired properties of the conjugate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment, an antibody may be conjugated to a “receptor” (such as streptavidin) for utilization in tumor pre-targeting wherein the antibody-receptor conjugate is administered to the patient, followed by removal of unbound conjugate from the circulation using a clearing agent and then administration of a “ligand” (e.g., avidin) which is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent (e.g., a radionucleotide).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n2. Exemplary Immunoconjugates—Thio-Antibody Drug Conjugates\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreparation of Cysteine Engineered Anti-CD22 Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDNA encoding an amino acid sequence variant of the cysteine engineered anti-CD22 antibodies and parent anti-CD22 antibodies of the invention is prepared by a variety of methods which include, but are not limited to, isolation from a natural source (in the case of naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants), preparation by site-directed (or oligonucleotide-mediated) mutagenesis (Carter (1985) et al Nucleic Acids Res. 13:4431-4443; Ho et al (1989) Gene (Amst.) 77:51-59; Kunkel et al (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:488; Liu et al (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273:20252-20260), PCR mutagenesis (Higuchi, (1990) in PCR Protocols, pp. 177-183, Academic Press; Ito et al (1991) Gene 102:67-70; Bernhard et al (1994) Bioconjugate Chem. 5:126-132; and Vallette et al (1989) Nuc. Acids Res. 17:723-733), and cassette mutagenesis (Wells et al (1985) Gene 34:315-323) of an earlier prepared DNA encoding the polypeptide. Mutagenesis protocols, kits, and reagents are commercially available, e.g. QuikChange® Multi Site-Direct Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.). Single mutations are also generated by oligonucleotide directed mutagenesis using double stranded plasmid DNA as template by PCR based mutagenesis (Sambrook and Russel, (2001) Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 3rd edition; Zoller et al (1983) Methods Enzymol. 100:468-500; Zoller, M. J. and Smith, M. (1982) Nucl. Acids Res. 10:6487-6500). Variants of recombinant antibodies may be constructed also by restriction fragment manipulation or by overlap extension PCR with synthetic oligonucleotides. Mutagenic primers encode the cysteine codon replacement(s). Standard mutagenesis techniques can be employed to generate DNA encoding such mutant cysteine engineered antibodies (Sambrook et al Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989; and Ausubel et al Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Greene Publishing and Wiley-Interscience, New York, N.Y., 1993).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPhage display technology (McCafferty et al (1990) Nature 348:552-553) can be used to produce anti-CD22 human antibodies and antibody fragments in vitro, from immunoglobulin variable (V) domain gene repertoires from unimmunized donors. According to this technique, antibody V domain genes are cloned in-frame into either a major or minor coat protein gene of a filamentous bacteriophage, such as M13 or fd, and displayed as functional antibody fragments on the surface of the phage particle. Because the filamentous particle contains a single-stranded DNA copy of the phage genome, selections based on the functional properties of the antibody also result in selection of the gene encoding the antibody exhibiting those properties. Thus, the phage mimics some of the properties of the B-cell (Johnson et al (1993) Current Opinion in Structural Biology 3:564-571; Clackson et al (1991) Nature, 352:624-628; Marks et al (1991) J. Mol. Biol. 222:581-597; Griffith et al (1993) EMBO J. 12:725-734; U.S. Pat. No. 5,565,332; U.S. Pat. No. 5,573,905; U.S. Pat. No. 5,567,610; U.S. Pat. No. 5,229,275).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-CD22 antibodies may be chemically synthesized using known oligopeptide synthesis methodology or may be prepared and purified using recombinant technology. The appropriate amino acid sequence, or portions thereof, may be produced by direct peptide synthesis using solid-phase techniques (Stewart et al., \nSolid\n-\nPhase Peptide Synthesis\n, (1969) W.H. Freeman Co., San Francisco, Calif.; Merrifield, (1963) J. Am. Chem. Soc., 85:2149-2154). In vitro protein synthesis may be performed using manual techniques or by automation. Automated solid phase synthesis may be accomplished, for instance, employing t-BOC or Fmoc protected amino acids and using an Applied Biosystems Peptide Synthesizer (Foster City, Calif.) using manufacturer's instructions. Various portions of the anti-CD22 antibody or CD22 polypeptide may be chemically synthesized separately and combined using chemical or enzymatic methods to produce the desired anti-CD22 antibody or CD22 polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious techniques have been developed for the production of antibody fragments. Traditionally, these fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies (Morimoto et al (1992) Journal of Biochemical and Biophysical Methods 24:107-117; and Brennan et al (1985) Science, 229:81), or produced directly by recombinant host cells. Fab, Fv and ScFv anti-CD22 antibody fragments can all be expressed in and secreted from \nE. coli\n, thus allowing the facile production of large amounts of these fragments. Antibody fragments can be isolated from the antibody phage libraries discussed herein. Alternatively, Fab′-SH fragments can be directly recovered from \nE. coli \nand chemically coupled to form F(ab′)\n2 \nfragments (Carter et al (1992) Bio/Technology 10: 163-167), or isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture. The anti-CD22 antibody may be a (scFv) single chain Fv fragment (WO 93/16185; U.S. Pat. No. 5,571,894; U.S. Pat. No. 5,587,458). The anti-CD22 antibody fragment may also be a “linear antibody” (U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,870). Such linear antibody fragments may be monospecific or bispecific.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe description below relates primarily to production of anti-CD22 antibodies by culturing cells transformed or transfected with a vector containing anti-CD22 antibody-encoding nucleic acid. DNA encoding anti-CD22 antibodies may be obtained from a cDNA library prepared from tissue believed to possess the anti-CD22 antibody mRNA and to express it at a detectable level. Accordingly, human anti-CD22 antibody or CD22 polypeptide DNA can be conveniently obtained from a cDNA library prepared from human tissue. The anti-CD22 antibody-encoding gene may also be obtained from a genomic library or by known synthetic procedures (e.g., automated nucleic acid synthesis).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe design, selection, and preparation methods of the invention enable cysteine engineered anti-CD22 antibodies which are reactive with electrophilic functionality. These methods further enable antibody conjugate compounds such as antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) compounds with drug molecules at designated, designed, selective sites. Reactive cysteine residues on an antibody surface allow specifically conjugating a drug moiety through a thiol reactive group such as maleimide or haloacetyl. The nucleophilic reactivity of the thiol functionality of a Cys residue to a maleimide group is about 1000 times higher compared to any other amino acid functionality in a protein, such as amino group of lysine residues or the N-terminal amino group. Thiol specific functionality in iodoacetyl and maleimide reagents may react with amine groups, but higher pH (>9.0) and longer reaction times are required (Garman, 1997, Non-Radioactive Labelling: A Practical Approach, Academic Press, London). The amount of free thiol in a protein may be estimated by the standard Ellman's assay. Immunoglobulin M is an example of a disulfide-linked pentamer, while immunoglobulin G is an example of a protein with internal disulfide bridges bonding the subunits together. In proteins such as this, reduction of the disulfide bonds with a reagent such as dithiothreitol (DTT) or selenol (Singh et al (2002) Anal. Biochem. 304:147-156) is required to generate the reactive free thiol. This approach may result in loss of antibody tertiary structure and antigen binding specificity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Pheselector (Phage ELISA for Selection of Reactive Thiols) Assay allows for detection of reactive cysteine groups in antibodies in an ELISA phage format thereby assisting in the design of cysteine engineered antibodies (WO 2006/034488). The cysteine engineered antibody is coated on well surfaces, followed by incubation with phage particles, addition of HRP labeled secondary antibody, and absorbance detection. Mutant proteins displayed on phage may be screened in a rapid, robust, and high-throughput manner. Libraries of cysteine engineered antibodies can be produced and subjected to binding selection using the same approach to identify appropriately reactive sites of free Cys incorporation from random protein-phage libraries of antibodies or other proteins. This technique includes reacting cysteine mutant proteins displayed on phage with an affinity reagent or reporter group which is also thiol-reactive.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe PHESELECTOR assay allows screening of reactive thiol groups in antibodies. Identification of the A121C variant by this method is exemplary. The entire Fab molecule may be effectively searched to identify more ThioFab variants with reactive thiol groups. A parameter, fractional surface accessibility, was employed to identify and quantitate the accessibility of solvent to the amino acid residues in a polypeptide. The surface accessibility can be expressed as the surface area (Å\n2\n) that can be contacted by a solvent molecule, e.g. water. The occupied space of water is approximated as a 1.4 Å radius sphere. Software is freely available or licensable (Secretary to CCP4, Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, WA4 4AD, United Kingdom, Fax: (+44) 1925 603825, or by internet: www.ccp4.ac.uk/dist/html/INDEX.html) as the CCP4 Suite of crystallography programs which employ algorithms to calculate the surface accessibility of each amino acid of a protein with known x-ray crystallography derived coordinates (“The CCP4 Suite: Programs for Protein Crystallography” (1994) Acta. Cryst. D50:760-763). Two exemplary software modules that perform surface accessibility calculations are “AREAIMOL” and “SURFACE”, based on the algorithms of B. Lee and F. M. Richards (1971) J. Mol. Biol. 55:379-400. AREAIMOL defines the solvent accessible surface of a protein as the locus of the centre of a probe sphere (representing a solvent molecule) as it rolls over the Van der Waals surface of the protein. AREAIMOL calculates the solvent accessible surface area by generating surface points on an extended sphere about each atom (at a distance from the atom centre equal to the sum of the atom and probe radii), and eliminating those that lie within equivalent spheres associated with neighboring atoms. AREAIMOL finds the solvent accessible area of atoms in a PDB coordinate file, and summarizes the accessible area by residue, by chain and for the whole molecule. Accessible areas (or area differences) for individual atoms can be written to a pseudo-PDB output file. AREAIMOL assumes a single radius for each element, and only recognizes a limited number of different elements.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAREAIMOL and SURFACE report absolute accessibilities, i.e. the number of square Angstroms (Å). Fractional surface accessibility is calculated by reference to a standard state relevant for an amino acid within a polypeptide. The reference state is tripeptide Gly-X-Gly, where X is the amino acid of interest, and the reference state should be an ‘extended’ conformation, i.e. like those in beta-strands. The extended conformation maximizes the accessibility of X. A calculated accessible area is divided by the accessible area in a Gly-X-Gly tripeptide reference state and reports the quotient, which is the fractional accessibility. Percent accessibility is fractional accessibility multiplied by 100. Another exemplary algorithm for calculating surface accessibility is based on the SOLV module of the program xsae (Broger, C., F. Hoffman-LaRoche, Basel) which calculates fractional accessibility of an amino acid residue to a water sphere based on the X-ray coordinates of the polypeptide. The fractional surface accessibility for every amino acid in an antibody may be calculated using available crystal structure information (Eigenbrot et al. (1993) J Mol Biol. 229:969-995).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDNA encoding the cysteine engineered antibodies is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies). The hybridoma cells serve as a source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA may be placed into expression vectors, which are then transfected into host cells such as \nE. coli \ncells, simian COS cells, Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, or other mammalian host cells, such as myeloma cells (U.S. Pat. No. 5,807,715; US 2005/0048572; \nUS\n 2004/0229310) that do not otherwise produce the antibody protein, to obtain the synthesis of monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter design and selection, cysteine engineered antibodies, e.g. ThioFabs, with the engineered, highly reactive unpaired Cys residues, may be produced by: (i) expression in a bacterial, e.g. \nE. coli\n, system (Skerra et al (1993) Curr. Opinion in Immunol. 5:256-262; Pluckthun (1992) Immunol. Revs. 130:151-188) or a mammalian cell culture system (WO 01/00245), e.g. Chinese Hamster Ovary cells (CHO); and (ii) purification using common protein purification techniques (Lowman et al (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266(17):10982-10988).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe engineered Cys thiol groups react with electrophilic linker reagents and drug-linker intermediates to form cysteine engineered antibody drug conjugates and other labelled cysteine engineered antibodies. Cys residues of cysteine engineered antibodies, and present in the parent antibodies, which are paired and form interchain and intrachain disulfide bonds do not have any reactive thiol groups (unless treated with a reducing agent) and do not react with electrophilic linker reagents or drug-linker intermediates. The newly engineered Cys residue, can remain unpaired, and able to react with, i.e. conjugate to, an electrophilic linker reagent or drug-linker intermediate, such as a drug-maleimide. Exemplary drug-linker intermediates include: MC-MMAE, MC-MMAF, MC-vc-PAB-MMAE, and MC-vc-PAB-MMAF. The structure positions of the engineered Cys residues of the heavy and light chains are numbered according to a sequential numbering system. This sequential numbering system is correlated to the Kabat numbering system (Kabat et al., (1991) Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md.) starting at the N-terminus, differs from the Kabat numbering scheme (bottom row) by insertions noted by a,b,c. Using the Kabat numbering system, the actual linear amino acid sequence may contain fewer or additional amino acids corresponding to a shortening of, or insertion into, a FR or CDR of the variable domain. The cysteine engineered heavy chain variant sites are identified by the sequential numbering and Kabat numbering schemes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the cysteine engineered anti-CD22 antibody is prepared by a process comprising:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(a) replacing one or more amino acid residues of a parent anti-CD22 antibody by cysteine; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(b) determining the thiol reactivity of the cysteine engineered anti-CD22 antibody by reacting the cysteine engineered antibody with a thiol-reactive reagent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cysteine engineered antibody may be more reactive than the parent antibody with the thiol-reactive reagent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe free cysteine amino acid residues may be located in the heavy or light chains, or in the constant or variable domains. Antibody fragments, e.g. Fab, may also be engineered with one or more cysteine amino acids replacing amino acids of the antibody fragment, to form cysteine engineered antibody fragments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother embodiment of the invention provides a method of preparing (making) a cysteine engineered anti-CD22 antibody, comprising:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(a) introducing one or more cysteine amino acids into a parent anti-CD22 antibody in order to generate the cysteine engineered anti-CD22 antibody; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(b) determining the thiol reactivity of the cysteine engineered antibody with a thiol-reactive reagent;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwherein the cysteine engineered antibody is more reactive than the parent antibody with the thiol-reactive reagent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStep (a) of the method of preparing a cysteine engineered antibody may comprise:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(i) mutagenizing a nucleic acid sequence encoding the cysteine engineered antibody;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(ii) expressing the cysteine engineered antibody; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(iii) isolating and purifying the cysteine engineered antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStep (b) of the method of preparing a cysteine engineered antibody may comprise expressing the cysteine engineered antibody on a viral particle selected from a phage or a phagemid particle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStep (b) of the method of preparing a cysteine engineered antibody may also comprise:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(i) reacting the cysteine engineered antibody with a thiol-reactive affinity reagent to generate an affinity labelled, cysteine engineered antibody; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(ii) measuring the binding of the affinity labelled, cysteine engineered antibody to a capture media.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother embodiment of the invention is a method of screening cysteine engineered antibodies with highly reactive, unpaired cysteine amino acids for thiol reactivity comprising:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(a) introducing one or more cysteine amino acids into a parent antibody in order to generate a cysteine engineered antibody;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(b) reacting the cysteine engineered antibody with a thiol-reactive affinity reagent to generate an affinity labelled, cysteine engineered antibody; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(c) measuring the binding of the affinity labelled, cysteine engineered antibody to a capture media; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(d) determining the thiol reactivity of the cysteine engineered antibody with the thiol-reactive reagent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStep (a) of the method of screening cysteine engineered antibodies may comprise:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(i) mutagenizing a nucleic acid sequence encoding the cysteine engineered antibody;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(ii) expressing the cysteine engineered antibody; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(iii) isolating and purifying the cysteine engineered antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStep (b) of the method of screening cysteine engineered antibodies may comprise expressing the cysteine engineered antibody on a viral particle selected from a phage or a phagemid particle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStep (b) of the method of screening cysteine engineered antibodies may also comprise:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(i) reacting the cysteine engineered antibody with a thiol-reactive affinity reagent to generate an affinity labelled, cysteine engineered antibody; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(ii) measuring the binding of the affinity labelled, cysteine engineered antibody to a capture media.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCysteine Engineering of Anti-CD22 10F4 IgG Variants\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCysteine was introduced at the heavy chain 118 (EU numbering) (equivalent to heavy chain position 121, sequential numbering) site into the full-length, chimeric parent monoclonal anti-CD22 antibodies by the cysteine engineering methods described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe parent antibody, “std Anti-CD22 Hu 10F4v3 Fc” (Heavy Chain sequence: SEQ ID NO:88, Light Chain sequence: SEQ ID NO:87, \nFIG. 5B\n) was cysteine engineered to give “A118C thio hu anti-CD22 10F4v3” (Heavy Chain sequence: SEQ ID NO:92, Light Chain sequence: SEQ ID NO:91, \nFIG. 17\n), “S400C thio hu anti-CD22 10F4v3” (Heavy Chain sequence: SEQ ID NO:93, Light Chain sequence: SEQ ID NO:91, \nFIG. 17\n), or “V205C thio anti-CD22 10F4v3” (Heavy Chain sequence: SEQ ID NO:88, Light Chain sequence: SEQ ID NO:91, \nFIGS. 5B and 17\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese cysteine engineered monoclonal antibodies were expressed in CHO (Chinese Hamster Ovary) cells by transient fermentation in media containing 1 mM cysteine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLabelled Cysteine Engineered Anti-CD22 Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCysteine engineered anti-CD22 antibodies may be site-specifically and efficiently coupled with a thiol-reactive reagent. The thiol-reactive reagent may be a multifunctional linker reagent, a capture, i.e. affinity, label reagent (e.g. a biotin-linker reagent), a detection label (e.g. a fluorophore reagent), a solid phase immobilization reagent (e.g. SEPHAROSE™, polystyrene, or glass), or a drug-linker intermediate. One example of a thiol-reactive reagent is N-ethyl maleimide (NEM). In an exemplary embodiment, reaction of a ThioFab with a biotin-linker reagent provides a biotinylated ThioFab by which the presence and reactivity of the engineered cysteine residue may be detected and measured. Reaction of a ThioFab with a multifunctional linker reagent provides a ThioFab with a functionalized linker which may be further reacted with a drug moiety reagent or other label. Reaction of a ThioFab with a drug-linker intermediate provides a ThioFab drug conjugate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe exemplary methods described here may be applied generally to the identification and production of antibodies, and more generally, to other proteins through application of the design and screening steps described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch an approach may be applied to the conjugation of other thiol-reactive reagents in which the reactive group is, for example, a maleimide, an iodoacetamide, a pyridyl disulfide, or other thiol-reactive conjugation partner (Haugland, 2003, Molecular Probes Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals, Molecular Probes, Inc.; Brinkley, 1992, Bioconjugate Chem. 3:2; Garman, 1997, Non-Radioactive Labelling: A Practical Approach, Academic Press, London; Means (1990) Bioconjugate Chem. 1:2; Hermanson, G. in Bioconjugate Techniques (1996) Academic Press, San Diego, pp. 40-55, 643-671). The thiol-reactive reagent may be a drug moiety, a fluorophore such as a fluorescent dye like fluorescein or rhodamine, a chelating agent for an imaging or radiotherapeutic metal, a peptidyl or non-peptidyl label or detection tag, or a clearance-modifying agent such as various isomers of polyethylene glycol, a peptide that binds to a third component, or another carbohydrate or lipophilic agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUses of Cysteine Engineered Anti-CD22 Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCysteine engineered anti-CD22 antibodies, and conjugates thereof may find use as therapeutic and/or diagnostic agents. The present invention further provides methods of preventing, managing, treating or ameliorating one or more symptoms associated with a B-cell related disorder. In particular, the present invention provides methods of preventing, managing, treating, or ameliorating one or more symptoms associated with a cell proliferative disorder, such as cancer, e.g., lymphoma, non-Hogkins lymphoma (NHL), aggressive NHL, relapsed aggressive NHL, relapsed indolent NHL, refractory NHL, refractory indolent NHL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), small lymphocytic lymphoma, leukemia, hairy cell leukemia (HCL), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and mantle cell lymphoma. The present invention still further provides methods for diagnosing a CD22 related disorder or predisposition to developing such a disorder, as well as methods for identifying antibodies, and antigen-binding fragments of antibodies, that preferentially bind B cell-associated CD22 polypeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother embodiment of the present invention is directed to the use of a cysteine engineered anti-CD22 antibody for the preparation of a medicament useful in the treatment of a condition which is responsive to a B cell related disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCysteine Engineered Antibody Drug Conjugates (Thio-Antibody Drug Conjugates)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention is an antibody-drug conjugate compound comprising a cysteine engineered anti-CD22 antibody (Ab), and an auristatin drug moiety (D) wherein the cysteine engineered antibody is attached through one or more free cysteine amino acids by a linker moiety (L) to D; the compound having Formula I:\n\n\n \n \n \nAb-(L-D)\np\n  I\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwhere p is 1, 2, 3, or 4; and wherein the cysteine engineered antibody is prepared by a process comprising replacing one or more amino acid residues of a parent anti-CD22 antibody by one or more free cysteine amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 10\n shows embodiments of cysteine engineered anti-CD22 antibody drug conjugates (ADC) where an auristatin drug moiety is attached to an engineered cysteine group in: the light chain (LC-ADC); the heavy chain (HC-ADC); and the Fc region (Fc-ADC).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPotential advantages of cysteine engineered anti-CD22 antibody drug conjugates include improved safety (larger therapeutic index), improved PK parameters, the antibody inter-chain disulfide bonds are retained which may stabilize the conjugate and retain its active binding conformation, the sites of drug conjugation are defined, and the preparation of cysteine engineered antibody drug conjugates from conjugation of cysteine engineered antibodies to drug-linker reagents results in a more homogeneous product.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLinkers\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Linker”, “Linker Unit”, or “link” means a chemical moiety comprising a covalent bond or a chain of atoms that covalently attaches an antibody to a drug moiety. In various embodiments, a linker is specified as L. A “Linker” (L) is a bifunctional or multifunctional moiety which can be used to link one or more Drug moieties (D) and an antibody unit (Ab) to form antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) of Formula I. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) can be conveniently prepared using a Linker having reactive functionality for binding to the Drug and to the Antibody. A cysteine thiol of a cysteine engineered antibody (Ab) can form a bond with an electrophilic functional group of a linker reagent, a drug moiety or drug-linker intermediate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, a Linker has a reactive site which has an electrophilic group that is reactive to a nucleophilic cysteine present on an antibody. The cysteine thiol of the antibody is reactive with an electrophilic group on a Linker and forms a covalent bond to a Linker. Useful electrophilic groups include, but are not limited to, maleimide and haloacetamide groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLinkers include a divalent radical such as an alkyldiyl, an arylene, a heteroarylene, moieties such as: —(CR\n2\n)\nn\nO(CR\n2\n)\nn\n—, repeating units of alkyloxy (e.g. polyethylenoxy, PEG, polymethyleneoxy) and alkylamino (e.g. polyethyleneamino, Jeffamine™); and diacid ester and amides including succinate, succinamide, diglycolate, malonate, and caproamide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCysteine engineered antibodies react with linker reagents or drug-linker intermediates, with electrophilic functional groups such as maleimide or α-halo carbonyl, according to the conjugation method at page 766 of Klussman, et al (2004), Bioconjugate Chemistry 15(4):765-773, and according to the protocol of Example x.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe linker may be composed of one or more linker components. Exemplary linker components include 6-maleimidocaproyl (“MC”), maleimidopropanoyl (“MP”), valine-citrulline (“val-cit” or “vc”), alanine-phenylalanine (“ala-phe” or “af”), p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl (“PAB”), N-succinimidyl 4-(2-pyridylthio) pentanoate (“SPP”), N-succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1 carboxylate (“SMCC”), N-Succinimidyl (4-iodo-acetyl)aminobenzoate (“SIAB”), ethyleneoxy —CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO— as one or more repeating units (“EO” or “PEO”). Additional linker components are known in the art and some are described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, linker L of an ADC has the formula:\n\n\n \n \n \n-A\na\n-W\nw\n—Y\ny\n—\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwherein:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n-A- is a Stretcher unit covalently attached to a cysteine thiol of the antibody (Ab);\n\n\n \n \n \n \na is 0 or 1;\n\n\n \n \n \n \neach —W— is independently an Amino Acid unit;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nw is independently an integer ranging from 0 to 12;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n—Y— is a Spacer unit covalently attached to the drug moiety; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \ny is 0, 1 or 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStretcher Unit\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Stretcher unit (-A-), when present, is capable of linking an antibody unit to an amino acid unit (—W—). In this regard an antibody (Ab) has a functional group that can form a bond with a functional group of a Stretcher. Useful functional groups that can be present on an antibody, either naturally or via chemical manipulation include, but are not limited to, sulfhydryl (—SH), amino, hydroxyl, carboxy, the anomeric hydroxyl group of a carbohydrate, and carboxyl. In one aspect, the antibody functional groups are sulfhydryl or amino. Sulfhydryl groups can be generated by reduction of an intramolecular disulfide bond of an antibody. Alternatively, sulfhydryl groups can be generated by reaction of an amino group of a lysine moiety of an antibody using 2-iminothiolane (Traut's reagent) or another sulfhydryl generating reagent. In one embodiment, an antibody (Ab) has a free cysteine thiol group that can form a bond with an electrophilic functional group of a Stretcher Unit.

Dendritic linkers can increase the molar ratio of drug to antibody, i.e. loading, which is related to the potency of the ADC. Thus, where a cysteine engineered antibody bears only one reactive cysteine thiol group, a multitude of drug moieties may be attached through a dendritic linker.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmino Acid Unit\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe linker may comprise amino acid residues.

Each carbon atom to which R\n19 \nis attached is independently in the (S) or (R) configuration, or a racemic mixture. Amino acid units may thus be enantiomerically pure, racemic, or diastereomeric.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary —W\nw\n— Amino Acid units include a dipeptide, a tripeptide, a tetrapeptide or a pentapeptide. Exemplary dipeptides include: valine-citrulline (vc or val-cit), alanine-phenylalanine (af or ala-phe). Exemplary tripeptides include: glycine-valine-citrulline (gly-val-cit) and glycine-glycine-glycine (gly-gly-gly). Amino acid residues which comprise an amino acid linker component include those occurring naturally, as well as minor amino acids and non-naturally occurring amino acid analogs, such as citrulline.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Amino Acid unit can be enzymatically cleaved by one or more enzymes, including a tumor-associated protease, to liberate the Drug moiety (-D), which in one embodiment is protonated in vivo upon release to provide a Drug (D). Amino acid linker components can be designed and optimized in their selectivity for enzymatic cleavage by a particular enzymes, for example, a tumor-associated protease, cathepsin B, C and D, or a plasmin protease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpacer Unit\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Spacer unit (—Y—), when present (y=1 or 2), links an Amino Acid unit (—W\nw\n—) to the drug moiety (D) when an Amino Acid unit is present (w=1-12). Alternately, the Spacer unit links the Stretcher unit to the Drug moiety when the Amino Acid unit is absent. The Spacer unit also links the drug moiety to the antibody unit when both the Amino Acid unit and Stretcher unit are absent (w, y=0). Spacer units are of two general types: self-immolative and non self-immolative. A non self-immolative Spacer unit is one in which part or all of the Spacer unit remains bound to the Drug moiety after cleavage, particularly enzymatic, of an Amino Acid unit from the antibody-drug conjugate or the Drug moiety-linker. When an ADC containing a glycine-glycine Spacer unit or a glycine Spacer unit undergoes enzymatic cleavage via a tumor-cell associated-protease, a cancer-cell-associated protease or a lymphocyte-associated protease, a glycine-glycine-Drug moiety or a glycine-Drug moiety is cleaved from Ab-A\na\n-W\nw\n-. In one embodiment, an independent hydrolysis reaction takes place within the target cell, cleaving the glycine-Drug moiety bond and liberating the Drug.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, —Y\ny\n— is a p-aminobenzylcarbamoyl (PAB) unit whose phenylene portion is substituted with Q\nm \nwherein Q is —C\n1\n-C\n8 \nalkyl, —O—(C\n1\n-C\n8 \nalkyl), -halogen, -nitro or -cyano; and m is an integer ranging from 0-4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary embodiments of a non self-immolative Spacer unit (—Y—) are: -Gly-Gly-; -Gly-; -Ala-Phe-; -Val-Cit-.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, a Drug moiety-linker or an ADC is provided in which the Spacer unit is absent (y=0), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, an ADC containing a self-immolative Spacer unit can release -D. In one embodiment, —Y— is a PAB group that is linked to —W\nw\n— via the amino nitrogen atom of the PAB group, and connected directly to -D via a carbonate, carbamate or ether group, where the ADC has the exemplary structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwherein Q is —C\n1\n-C\n8 \nalkyl, —O—(C\n1\n-C\n8 \nalkyl), -halogen, -nitro or -cyano; m is an integer ranging from 0-4; and p ranges from 1 to 4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther examples of self-immolative spacers include, but are not limited to, aromatic compounds that are electronically similar to the PAB group such as 2-aminoimidazol-5-methanol derivatives (Hay et al. (1999) Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 9:2237), heterocyclic PAB analogs (US 2005/0256030), beta-glucuronide (WO 2007/011968), and ortho or para-aminobenzylacetals. Spacers can be used that undergo cyclization upon amide bond hydrolysis, such as substituted and unsubstituted 4-aminobutyric acid amides (Rodrigues et al (1995) Chemistry Biology 2:223), appropriately substituted bicyclo[2.2.1] and bicyclo[2.2.2] ring systems (Storm et al (1972) J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 94:5815) and 2-aminophenylpropionic acid amides (Amsberry, et al (1990) J. Org. Chem. 55:5867). Elimination of amine-containing drugs that are substituted at glycine (Kingsbury et al (1984) J. Med. Chem. 27:1447) are also examples of self-immolative spacer useful in ADCs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary Spacer units (—Y\ny\n—) are represented by Formulas X-XII:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDendritic Linkers\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, linker L may be a dendritic type linker for covalent attachment of more than one drug moiety through a branching, multifunctional linker moiety to an antibody (Sun et al (2002) Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters 12:2213-2215; Sun et al (2003) Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry 11:1761-1768). Dendritic linkers can increase the molar ratio of drug to antibody, i.e. loading, which is related to the potency of the ADC. Thus, where a cysteine engineered antibody bears only one reactive cysteine thiol group, a multitude of drug moieties may be attached through a dendritic linker. Exemplary embodiments of branched, dendritic linkers include 2,6-bis(hydroxymethyl)-p-cresol and 2,4,6-tris(hydroxymethyl)-phenol dendrimer units (\nWO\n 2004/01993; Szalai et al (2003) J. Amer.

Useful electrophilic groups on an antibody include, but are not limited to, aldehyde and ketone carbonyl groups. The heteroatom of a nucleophilic group of a Linker can react with an electrophilic group on an antibody and form a covalent bond to an antibody unit. Useful nucleophilic groups on a Linker include, but are not limited to, hydrazide, oxime, amino, hydrazine, thiosemicarbazone, hydrazine carboxylate, and arylhydrazide. The electrophilic group on an antibody provides a convenient site for attachment to a Linker.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypically, peptide-type Linkers can be prepared by forming a peptide bond between two or more amino acids and/or peptide fragments. Such peptide bonds can be prepared, for example, according to the liquid phase synthesis method (E. Schröder and K. Lübke (1965) “The Peptides”, \nvolume\n 1, pp 76-136, Academic Press) which is well known in the field of peptide chemistry. Linker intermediates may be assembled with any combination or sequence of reactions including Spacer, Stretcher, and Amino Acid units. The Spacer, Stretcher, and Amino Acid units may employ reactive functional groups which are electrophilic, nucleophilic, or free radical in nature. Reactive functional groups include, but are not limited to carboxyls, hydroxyls, para-nitrophenylcarbonate, isothiocyanate, and leaving groups, such as O-mesyl, O-tosyl, —Cl, —Br, —I; or maleimide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the Linker may be substituted with groups which modulated solubility or reactivity. For example, a charged substituent such as sulfonate (—SO\n3\n \n−\n) or ammonium, may increase water solubility of the reagent and facilitate the coupling reaction of the linker reagent with the antibody or the drug moiety, or facilitate the coupling reaction of Ab-L (antibody-linker intermediate) with D, or D-L (drug-linker intermediate) with Ab, depending on the synthetic route employed to prepare the ADC.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLinker Reagents\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConjugates of the antibody and auristatin may be made using a variety of bifunctional linker reagents such as N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionate (SPDP), succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC), iminothiolane (IT), bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters (such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl), active esters (such as disuccinimidyl suberate), aldehydes (such as glutaraldehyde), bis-azido compounds (such as bis(p-azidobenzoyl) hexanediamine), bis-diazonium derivatives (such as bis-(p-diazoniumbenzoyl)-ethylenediamine), diisocyanates (such as \ntoluene\n 2,6-diisocyanate), and bis-active fluorine compounds (such as 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibody drug conjugates may also be prepared with linker reagents: BMPEO, BMPS, EMCS, GMBS, HBVS, LC-SMCC, MBS, MPBH, SBAP, SIA, SIAB, SMPB, SMPH, sulfo-EMCS, sulfo-GMBS, sulfo-KMUS, sulfo-MBS, sulfo-SIAB, sulfo-SMCC, and sulfo-SMPB, and SVSB (succinimidyl-(4-vinylsulfone)benzoate), and including bis-maleimide reagents: DTME, BMB, BMDB, BMH, BMOE, BM(PEO)\n3\n, and BM(PEO)\n4\n, which are commercially available from Pierce Biotechnology, Inc., Customer Service Department, P.O. Box 117, Rockford, Ill. 61105 U.S.A, U.S.A 1-800-874-3723, International +815-968-0747. Bis-maleimide reagents allow the attachment of the thiol group of a cysteine engineered antibody to a thiol-containing drug moiety, label, or linker intermediate, in a sequential or concurrent fashion. Other functional groups besides maleimide, which are reactive with a thiol group of a cysteine engineered antibody, drug moiety, label, or linker intermediate include iodoacetamide, bromoacetamide, vinyl pyridine, disulfide, pyridyl disulfide, isocyanate, and isothiocyanate.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUseful linker reagents can also be obtained via other commercial sources, such as Molecular Biosciences Inc.

Conjugation methods (1) and (2) may be employed with a variety of cysteine engineered antibodies, drug moieties, and linkers to prepare the antibody-drug conjugates of Formula I.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody cysteine thiol groups are nucleophilic and capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker reagents and drug-linker intermediates including: (i) active esters such as NHS esters, HOBt esters, haloformates, and acid halides; (ii) alkyl and benzyl halides, such as haloacetamides; (iii) aldehydes, ketones, carboxyl, and maleimide groups; and (iv) disulfides, including pyridyl disulfides, via sulfide exchange. Nucleophilic groups on a drug moiety include, but are not limited to: amine, thiol, hydroxyl, hydrazide, oxime, hydrazine, thiosemicarbazone, hydrazine carboxylate, and arylhydrazide groups capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCysteine engineered antibodies may be made reactive for conjugation with linker reagents by treatment with a reducing agent such as DTT (Cleland's reagent, dithiothreitol) or TCEP (tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride; Getz et al (1999) Anal. Biochem. Vol 273:73-80; Soltec Ventures, Beverly, Mass.), followed by reoxidation to reform interchain and intrachain disulfide bonds (Example x). For example, full length, cysteine engineered monoclonal antibodies (ThioMabs) expressed in CHO cells are reduced with about a 50 fold excess of TCEP for 3 hrs at 37° C. to reduce disulfide bonds in cysteine adducts which may form between the newly introduced cysteine residues and the cysteine present in the culture media. The reduced ThioMab is diluted and loaded onto HiTrap S column in 10 mM sodium acetate, \npH\n 5, and eluted with PBS containing 0.3M sodium chloride. Disulfide bonds were reestablished between cysteine residues present in the parent Mab with dilute (200 nM) aqueous copper sulfate (CuSO\n4\n) at room temperature, overnight. Alternatively, dehydroascorbic acid (DHAA) is an effective oxidant to reestablish the intrachain disulfide groups of the cysteine engineered antibody after reductive cleavage of the cysteine adducts. Other oxidants, i.e. oxidizing agents, and oxidizing conditions, which are known in the art may be used. Ambient air oxidation is also effective. This mild, partial reoxidation step forms intrachain disulfides efficiently with high fidelity and preserves the thiol groups of the newly introduced cysteine residues. An approximate 10 fold excess of drug-linker intermediate, e.g. MC-vc-PAB-MMAE, was added, mixed, and let stand for about an hour at room temperature to effect conjugation and form the 10F4v3 anti-CD22 antibody-drug conjugate. The conjugation mixture was gel filtered and loaded and eluted through a HiTrap S column to remove excess drug-linker intermediate and other impurities.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 12\n shows the general process to prepare a cysteine engineered antibody expressed from cell culture for conjugation. When the cell culture media contains cysteine, disulfide adducts can form between the newly introduced cysteine amino acid and cysteine from media. These cysteine adducts, depicted as a circle in the exemplary ThioMab (left) in \nFIG. 12\n, must be reduced to generate cysteine engineered antibodies reactive for conjugation. Cysteine adducts, presumably along with various interchain disulfide bonds, are reductively cleaved to give a reduced form of the antibody with reducing agents such as TCEP. The interchain disulfide bonds between paired cysteine residues are reformed under partial oxidation conditions with copper sulfate, DHAA, or exposure to ambient oxygen. The newly introduced, engineered, and unpaired cysteine residues remain available for reaction with linker reagents or drug-linker intermediates to form the antibody conjugates of the invention. The ThioMabs expressed in mammalian cell lines result in externally conjugated Cys adduct to an engineered Cys through —S—S— bond formation. Hence the purified ThioMabs are treated with the reduction and reoxidation procedures as described in Example x to produce reactive ThioMabs. These ThioMabs are used to conjugate with maleimide containing cytotoxic drugs, fluorophores, and other labels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods of Screening\n\n\n \n \n \n \nYet another embodiment of the present invention is directed to a method of determining the presence of a CD22 polypeptide in a sample suspected of containing the CD22 polypeptide, wherein the method comprises exposing the sample to a cysteine engineered anti-CD22 antibody, or antibody drug conjugate thereof, that binds to the CD22 polypeptide and determining binding of the cysteine engineered anti-CD22 antibody, or antibody drug conjugate thereof, to the CD22 polypeptide in the sample, wherein the presence of such binding is indicative of the presence of the CD22 polypeptide in the sample. Optionally, the sample may contain cells (which may be cancer cells) suspected of expressing the CD22 polypeptide. The cysteine engineered anti-CD22 antibody, or antibody drug conjugate thereof, employed in the method may optionally be detectably labeled, attached to a solid support, or the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother embodiment of the present invention is directed to a method of diagnosing the presence of a tumor in a mammal, wherein the method comprises (a) contacting a test sample comprising tissue cells obtained from the mammal with a cysteine engineered anti-CD22 antibody, or antibody drug conjugate thereof, that binds to a CD22 polypeptide and (b) detecting the formation of a complex between the cysteine engineered anti-CD22 antibody, or antibody drug conjugate thereof, and the CD22 polypeptide in the test sample, wherein the formation of a complex is indicative of the presence of a tumor in the mammal. Optionally, the cysteine engineered anti-CD22 antibody, or antibody drug conjugate thereof, is detectably labeled, attached to a solid support, or the like, and/or the test sample of tissue cells is obtained from an individual suspected of having a cancerous tumor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMetabolites of the Antibody-Drug Conjugates\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso falling within the scope of this invention are the in vivo metabolic products of the ADC compounds described herein, to the extent such products are novel and unobvious over the prior art. Such products may result for example from the oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, amidation, esterification, enzymatic cleavage, and the like, of the administered compound. Accordingly, the invention includes novel and unobvious compounds produced by a process comprising contacting a compound of this invention with a mammal for a period of time sufficient to yield a metabolic product thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMetabolite products typically are identified by preparing a radiolabelled (e.g. \n14\nC or \n3\nH) ADC, administering it parenterally in a detectable dose (e.g. greater than about 0.5 mg/kg) to an animal such as rat, mouse, guinea pig, monkey, or to man, allowing sufficient time for metabolism to occur (typically about 30 seconds to 30 hours) and isolating its conversion products from the urine, blood or other biological samples. These products are easily isolated since they are labeled (others are isolated by the use of antibodies capable of binding epitopes surviving in the metabolite). The metabolite structures are determined in conventional fashion, e.g. by MS, LC/MS or NMR analysis. In general, analysis of metabolites is done in the same way as conventional drug metabolism studies well-known to those skilled in the art. The conversion products, so long as they are not otherwise found in vivo, are useful in diagnostic assays for therapeutic dosing of the ADC compounds of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical Formulations\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdministration of Antibody-Drug Conjugates, Including Thio-Antibody Drug Conjugates\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibody-drug conjugates (ADC), including thio-antibody drug conjugates (TDC), of the invention may be administered by any route appropriate to the condition to be treated. The ADC will typically be administered parenterally, i.e. infusion, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intradermal, intrathecal and epidural.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor treating these cancers, in one embodiment, the antibody-drug conjugate is administered via intravenous infusion. The dosage administered via infusion is in the range of about 1 μg/m\n2 \nto about 10,000 μg/m\n2 \nper dose, generally one dose per week for a total of one, two, three or four doses. Alternatively, the dosage range is of about 1 μg/m\n2 \nto about 1000 μg/m\n2\n, about 1 μg/m\n2 \nto about 800 μg/m\n2\n, about 1 μg/m\n2 \nto about 600 μg/m\n2\n, about 1 μg/m\n2 \nto about 400 μg/m\n2\n, about 10 μg/m\n2 \nto about 500 μg/m\n2\n, about 10 μg/m\n2 \nto about 300 μg/m\n2\n, about 10 μg/m\n2 \nto about 200 μg/m\n2\n, and about 1 μg/m\n2 \nto about 200 μg/m\n2\n. The dose may be administered once per day, once per week, multiple times per week, but less than once per day, multiple times per month but less than once per day, multiple times per month but less than once per week, once per month or intermittently to relieve or alleviate symptoms of the disease. Administration may continue at any of the disclosed intervals until remission of the tumor or symptoms of the lymphoma, leukemia being treated. Administration may continue after remission or relief of symptoms is achieved where such remission or relief is prolonged by such continued administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides a method of alleviating an autoimmune disease, comprising administering to a patient suffering from the autoimmune disease, a therapeutically effective amount of a humanized 10F4 antibody-drug conjugate of any one of the preceding embodiments. In preferred embodiments the antibody is administered intravenously or subcutaneously. The antibody-drug conjugate is administered intravenously at a dosage in the range of about 1 μg/m\n2 \nto about 100 mg/m\n2 \nper dose and in a specific embodiment, the dosage is 1 μg/m\n2 \nto about 500 μg/m\n2\n. The dose may be administered once per day, once per week, multiple times per week, but less than once per day, multiple times per month but less than once per day, multiple times per month but less than once per week, once per month or intermittently to relieve or alleviate symptoms of the disease. Administration may continue at any of the disclosed intervals until relief from or alleviation of symptoms of the autoimmune disease being treated. Administration may continue after relief from or alleviation of symptoms is achieved where such alleviation or relief is prolong by such continued administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides a method of treating a B cell disorder comprising administering to a patient suffering from a B cell disorder, such as a B cell proliferative disorder (including without limitation lymphoma and leukemia) or an autoimmune disease, a therapeutically effective amount of a humanized 10F4 antibody of any one of the preceding embodiments, which antibody is not conjugated to a cytotoxic molecule or a detectable molecule. The antibody will typically be administered in a dosage range of about 1 μg/m\n2 \nto about 1000 mg/m\n2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention further provides pharmaceutical formulations comprising at least one anti-CD22 antibody of the invention and/or at least one immunoconjugate thereof and/or at least one anti-CD22 antibody-drug conjugate of the invention. In some embodiments, a pharmaceutical formulation comprises 1) an anti-CD22 antibody and/or an anti-CD22 antibody-drug conjugate and/or an immunoconjugate thereof, and 2) a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In some embodiments, a pharmaceutical formulation comprises 1) an anti-CD22 antibody and/or an immunoconjugate thereof, and optionally, 2) at least one additional therapeutic agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical formulations comprising an antibody or immunoconjugate of the invention or the antibody-drug conjugate of the invention are prepared for storage by mixing the antibody or antibody-drug conjugate having the desired degree of purity with optional physiologically acceptable carriers, excipients or stabilizers (Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. (1980)) in the form of aqueous solutions or lyophilized or other dried formulations. Acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, histidine and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride); phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugars such as sucrose, mannitol, trehalose or sorbitol; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g., Zn-protein complexes); and/or non-ionic surfactants such as TWEEN™, PLURONICS™ or polyethylene glycol (PEG). Pharmaceutical formulations to be used for in vivo administration are generally sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nActive ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsule prepared, for example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization, for example, hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsule and poly-(methylmethacylate) microcapsule, respectively, in colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules) or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. (1980).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSustained-release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the antibody or immunoconjugate of the invention, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, or microcapsule. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and γ ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT™ (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and poly-D-(−)-3-hydroxybutyric acid. While polymers such as ethylene-vinyl acetate and lactic acid-glycolic acid enable release of molecules for over 100 days, certain hydrogels release proteins for shorter time periods. When encapsulated antibodies or immunoconjugates remain in the body for a long time, they may denature or aggregate as a result of exposure to moisture at 37° C., resulting in a loss of biological activity and possible changes in immunogenicity. Rational strategies can be devised for stabilization depending on the mechanism involved. For example, if the aggregation mechanism is discovered to be intermolecular S—S bond formation through thio-disulfide interchange, stabilization may be achieved by modifying sulfhydryl residues, lyophilizing from acidic solutions, controlling moisture content, using appropriate additives, and developing specific polymer matrix compositions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody-Drug Conjugate Treatments\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is contemplated that the antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) of the present invention may be used to treat various diseases or disorders, e.g. characterized by the overexpression of a tumor antigen. Exemplary conditions or hyperproliferative disorders include benign or malignant tumors; leukemia and lymphoid malignancies. Others include neuronal, glial, astrocytal, hypothalamic, glandular, macrophagal, epithelial, stromal, blastocoelic, inflammatory, angiogenic and immunologic, including autoimmune, disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ADC compounds which are identified in the animal models and cell-based assays can be further tested in tumor-bearing higher primates and human clinical trials. Human clinical trials can be designed to test the efficacy of the anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody or immunoconjugate of the invention in patients experiencing a B cell proliferative disorder including without limitation lymphoma, non-Hogkins lymphoma (NHL), aggressive NHL, relapsed aggressive NHL, relapsed indolent NHL, refractory NHL, refractory indolent NHL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), small lymphocytic lymphoma, leukemia, hairy cell leukemia (HCL), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and mantle cell lymphoma. The clinical trial may be designed to evaluate the efficacy of an ADC in combinations with known therapeutic regimens, such as radiation and/or chemotherapy involving known chemotherapeutic and/or cytotoxic agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, the disease or disorder to be treated is a hyperproliferative disease such as a B cell proliferative disorder and/or a B cell cancer. Examples of cancer to be treated herein include, but are not limited to, B cell proliferative disorder is selected from lymphoma, non-Hogkins lymphoma (NHL), aggressive NHL, relapsed aggressive NHL, relapsed indolent NHL, refractory NHL, refractory indolent NHL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), small lymphocytic lymphoma, leukemia, hairy cell leukemia (HCL), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and mantle cell lymphoma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cancer may comprise CD22-expressing cells, such that the ADC of the present invention are able to bind to the cancer cells. To determine CD22 expression in the cancer, various diagnostic/prognostic assays are available. In one embodiment, CD22 overexpression may be analyzed by IHC. Parrafin-embedded tissue sections from a tumor biopsy may be subjected to the IHC assay and accorded a CD22 protein staining intensity criteria with respect to the degree of staining and in what proportion of tumor cells examined.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the prevention or treatment of disease, the appropriate dosage of an ADC will depend on the type of disease to be treated, as defined above, the severity and course of the disease, whether the molecule is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes, previous therapy, the patient's clinical history and response to the antibody, and the discretion of the attending physician. The molecule is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments. Depending on the type and severity of the disease, about 1 μg/kg to 15 mg/kg (e.g. 0.1-20 mg/kg) of molecule is an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient, whether, for example, by one or more separate administrations, or by continuous infusion. A typical daily dosage might range from about 1 μg/kg to 100 mg/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. An exemplary dosage of ADC to be administered to a patient is in the range of about 0.1 to about 10 mg/kg of patient weight.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor repeated administrations over several days or longer, depending on the condition, the treatment is sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. An exemplary dosing regimen comprises administering an initial loading dose of about 4 mg/kg, followed by a weekly maintenance dose of about 2 mg/kg of an anti-ErbB2 antibody. Other dosage regimens may be useful. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCombination Therapy\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) of the invention may be combined in a pharmaceutical combination formulation, or dosing regimen as combination therapy, with a second compound having anti-cancer properties. The second compound of the pharmaceutical combination formulation or dosing regimen preferably has complementary activities to the ADC of the combination such that they do not adversely affect each other.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe second compound may be a chemotherapeutic agent, cytotoxic agent, cytokine, growth inhibitory agent, anti-hormonal agent, and/or cardioprotectant. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended. A pharmaceutical composition containing an ADC of the invention may also have a therapeutically effective amount of a chemotherapeutic agent such as a tubulin-forming inhibitor, a topoisomerase inhibitor, or a DNA binder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the first compound is an anti-CD22 ADC of the invention and the second compound is an anti-CD20 antibody (either a naked antibody or an ADC). In one embodiment the second compound is an anti-CD20 antibody rituximab (Rituxan®) or 2H7 (Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, Calif.). Another antibodies useful for combined immunotherapy with anti-CD22 ADCs of the invention includes without limitation, anti-VEGF (e.g, Avastin®).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther therapeutic regimens may be combined with the administration of an anticancer agent identified in accordance with this invention, including without limitation radiation therapy and/or bone marrow and peripheral blood transplants, and/or a cytotoxic agent, a chemotherapeutic agent, or a growth inhibitory agent. In one of such embodiments, a chemotherapeutic agent is an agent or a combination of agents such as, for example, cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, adriamycin, doxorubincin, vincristine (Oncovin™), prednisolone, CHOP, CVP, or COP, or immunotherapeutics such as anti-CD20 (e.g., Rituxan®) or anti-VEGF (e.g., Avastin®). The combination therapy may be administered as a simultaneous or sequential regimen. When administered sequentially, the combination may be administered in two or more administrations. The combined administration includes coadministration, using separate formulations or a single pharmaceutical formulation, and consecutive administration in either order, wherein preferably there is a time period while both (or all) active agents simultaneously exert their biological activities.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, treatment with an ADC involves the combined administration of an anticancer agent identified herein, and one or more chemotherapeutic agents or growth inhibitory agents, including coadministration of cocktails of different chemotherapeutic agents. Chemotherapeutic agents include taxanes (such as paclitaxel and docetaxel) and/or anthracycline antibiotics. Preparation and dosing schedules for such chemotherapeutic agents may be used according to manufacturer's instructions or as determined empirically by the skilled practitioner. Preparation and dosing schedules for such chemotherapy are also described in “Chemotherapy Service”, (1992) Ed., M. C. Perry, Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore, Md.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable dosages for any of the above coadministered agents are those presently used and may be lowered due to the combined action (synergy) of the newly identified agent and other chemotherapeutic agents or treatments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe combination therapy may provide “synergy” and prove “synergistic”, i.e. the effect achieved when the active ingredients used together is greater than the sum of the effects that results from using the compounds separately. A synergistic effect may be attained when the active ingredients are: (1) co-formulated and administered or delivered simultaneously in a combined, unit dosage formulation; (2) delivered by alternation or in parallel as separate formulations; or (3) by some other regimen. When delivered in alternation therapy, a synergistic effect may be attained when the compounds are administered or delivered sequentially, e.g. by different injections in separate syringes. In general, during alternation therapy, an effective dosage of each active ingredient is administered sequentially, i.e. serially, whereas in combination therapy, effective dosages of two or more active ingredients are administered together.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMetabolites of the Antibody-Drug Conjugates\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso falling within the scope of this invention are the in vivo metabolic products of the ADC compounds described herein, to the extent such products are novel and unobvious over the prior art. Such products may result for example from the oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, amidation, esterification, enzymatic cleavage, and the like, of the administered compound. Accordingly, the invention includes novel and unobvious compounds produced by a process comprising contacting a compound of this invention with a mammal for a period of time sufficient to yield a metabolic product thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMetabolite products typically are identified by preparing a radiolabelled (e.g. 14C or 3H) ADC, administering it parenterally in a detectable dose (e.g. greater than about 0.5 mg/kg) to an animal such as rat, mouse, guinea pig, monkey, or to man, allowing sufficient time for metabolism to occur (typically about 30 seconds to 30 hours) and isolating its conversion products from the urine, blood or other biological samples. These products are easily isolated since they are labeled (others are isolated by the use of antibodies capable of binding epitopes surviving in the metabolite). The metabolite structures are determined in conventional fashion, e.g. by MS, LC/MS or NMR analysis. In general, analysis of metabolites is done in the same way as conventional drug metabolism studies well-known to those skilled in the art. The conversion products, so long as they are not otherwise found in vivo, are useful in diagnostic assays for therapeutic dosing of the ADC compounds of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther Methods of Using Anti-CD22 Antibodies and Immunoconjugates\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiagnostic Methods and Methods of Detection\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, anti-CD22 antibodies and immunoconjugates of the invention are useful for detecting the presence of CD22 in a biological sample. The term “detecting” as used herein encompasses quantitative or qualitative detection. In certain embodiments, a biological sample comprises a cell or tissue. In certain embodiments, such tissues include normal and/or cancerous tissues that express CD22 at higher levels relative to other tissues, for example, B cells and/or B cell associated tissues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention provides a method of detecting the presence of CD22 in a biological sample. In certain embodiments, the method comprises contacting the biological sample with an anti-CD22 antibody under conditions permissive for binding of the anti-CD22 antibody to CD22, and detecting whether a complex is formed between the anti-CD22 antibody and CD22.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention provides a method of diagnosing a disorder associated with increased expression of CD22. In certain embodiments, the method comprises contacting a test cell with an anti-CD22 antibody; determining the level of expression (either quantitatively or qualitatively) of CD22 by the test cell by detecting binding of the anti-CD22 antibody to CD22; and comparing the level of expression of CD22 by the test cell with the level of expression of CD22 by a control cell (e.g., a normal cell of the same tissue origin as the test cell or a cell that expresses CD22 at levels comparable to such a normal cell), wherein a higher level of expression of CD22 by the test cell as compared to the control cell indicates the presence of a disorder associated with increased expression of CD22. In certain embodiments, the test cell is obtained from an individual suspected of having a disorder associated with increased expression of CD22. In certain embodiments, the disorder is a cell proliferative disorder, such as a cancer or a tumor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary cell proliferative disorders that may be diagnosed using an antibody of the invention include a B cell disorder and/or a B cell proliferative disorder including, but not limited to, lymphoma, non-Hogkins lymphoma (NHL), aggressive NHL, relapsed aggressive NHL, relapsed indolent NHL, refractory NHL, refractory indolent NHL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), small lymphocytic lymphoma, leukemia, hairy cell leukemia (HCL), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and mantle cell lymphoma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, a method of diagnosis or detection, such as those described above, comprises detecting binding of an anti-CD22 antibody to CD22 expressed on the surface of a cell or in a membrane preparation obtained from a cell expressing CD22 on its surface. In certain embodiments, the method comprises contacting a cell with an anti-CD22 antibody under conditions permissive for binding of the anti-CD22 antibody to CD22, and detecting whether a complex is formed between the anti-CD22 antibody and CD22 on the cell surface. An exemplary assay for detecting binding of an anti-CD22 antibody to CD22 expressed CD22 on the surface of a cell is a “FACS” assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain other methods can be used to detect binding of anti-CD22 antibodies to CD22. Such methods include, but are not limited to, antigen-binding assays that are well known in the art, such as western blots, radioimmunoassays, ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay), “sandwich” immunoassays, immunoprecipitation assays, fluorescent immunoassays, protein A immunoassays, and immunohistochemistry (IHC).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, anti-CD22 antibodies are labeled. Labels include, but are not limited to, labels or moieties that are detected directly (such as fluorescent, chromophoric, electron-dense, chemiluminescent, and radioactive labels), as well as moieties, such as enzymes or ligands, that are detected indirectly, e.g., through an enzymatic reaction or molecular interaction. Exemplary labels include, but are not limited to, the radioisotopes \n32\nP, \n14\nC, \n125\nI, \n3\nH, and \n131\nI, fluorophores such as rare earth chelates or fluorescein and its derivatives, rhodamine and its derivatives, dansyl, umbelliferone, luceriferases, e.g., firefly luciferase and bacterial luciferase (U.S. Pat. No. 4,737,456), luciferin, 2,3-dihydrophthalazinediones, horseradish peroxidase (HRP), alkaline phosphatase, β-galactosidase, glucoamylase, lysozyme, saccharide oxidases, e.g., glucose oxidase, galactose oxidase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, heterocyclic oxidases such as uricase and xanthine oxidase, coupled with an enzyme that employs hydrogen peroxide to oxidize a dye precursor such as HRP, lactoperoxidase, or microperoxidase, biotin/avidin, spin labels, bacteriophage labels, stable free radicals, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, anti-CD22 antibodies are immobilized on an insoluble matrix. Immobilization entails separating the anti-CD22 antibody from any CD22 that remains free in solution. This conventionally is accomplished by either insolubilizing the anti-CD22 antibody before the assay procedure, as by adsorption to a water-insoluble matrix or surface (Bennich et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,720,760), or by covalent coupling (for example, using glutaraldehyde cross-linking), or by insolubilizing the anti-CD22 antibody after formation of a complex between the anti-CD22 antibody and CD22, e.g., by immunoprecipitation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny of the above embodiments of diagnosis or detection may be carried out using an immunoconjugate of the invention in place of or in addition to an anti-CD22 antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherapeutic Methods\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn antibody or immunoconjugate of the invention may be used in, for example, in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo therapeutic methods. In one aspect, the invention provides methods for inhibiting cell growth or proliferation, either in vivo or in vitro, the method comprising exposing a cell to an anti-CD22 antibody or immunoconjugate thereof under conditions permissive for binding of the immunoconjugate to CD22. “Inhibiting cell growth or proliferation” means decreasing a cell's growth or proliferation by at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, or 100%, and includes inducing cell death. In certain embodiments, the cell is a tumor cell. In certain embodiments, the cell is a B cell. In certain embodiments, the cell is a xenograft, e.g., as exemplified herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, an antibody or immunoconjugate of the invention is used to treat or prevent a B cell proliferative disorder. In certain embodiments, the cell proliferative disorder is associated with increased expression and/or activity of CD22. For example, in certain embodiments, the B cell proliferative disorder is associated with increased expression of CD22 on the surface of a B cell. In certain embodiments, the B cell proliferative disorder is a tumor or a cancer. Examples of B cell proliferative disorders to be treated by the antibodies or immunoconjugates of the invention include, but are not limited to, lymphoma, non-Hogkins lymphoma (NHL), aggressive NHL, relapsed aggressive NHL, relapsed indolent NHL, refractory NHL, refractory indolent NHL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), small lymphocytic lymphoma, leukemia, hairy cell leukemia (HCL), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and mantle cell lymphoma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention provides methods for treating a B cell proliferative disorder comprising administering to an individual an effective amount of an anti-CD22 antibody or immunoconjugate thereof. In certain embodiments, a method for treating a B cell proliferative disorder comprises administering to an individual an effective amount of a pharmaceutical formulation comprising an anti-CD22 antibody or anti-CD22 immunoconjugate and, optionally, at least one additional therapeutic agent, such as those provided below. In certain embodiments, a method for treating a cell proliferative disorder comprises administering to an individual an effective amount of a pharmaceutical formulation comprising 1) an immunoconjugate comprising an anti-CD22 antibody and a cytotoxic agent; and optionally, 2) at least one additional therapeutic agent, such as those provided below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, at least some of the antibodies or immunoconjugates of the invention can bind CD22 from species other than human. Accordingly, antibodies or immunoconjugates of the invention can be used to bind CD22, e.g., in a cell culture containing CD22, in humans, or in other mammals having a CD22 with which an antibody or immunoconjugate of the invention cross-reacts (e.g. chimpanzee, baboon, marmoset, cynomolgus and rhesus monkeys, pig or mouse). In one embodiment, an anti-CD22 antibody or immunoconjugate can be used for targeting CD22 on B cells by contacting the antibody or immunoconjugate with CD22 to form an antibody or immunoconjugate-antigen complex such that a conjugated cytotoxin of the immunoconjugate accesses the interior of the cell. In one embodiment, the CD22 is human CD22.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, an anti-CD22 antibody or immunoconjugate can be used in a method for binding CD22 in an individual suffering from a disorder associated with increased CD22 expression and/or activity, the method comprising administering to the individual the antibody or immunoconjugate such that CD22 in the individual is bound. In one embodiment, the bound antibody or immunoconjugate is internalized into the B cell expressing CD22. In one embodiment, the CD22 is human CD22, and the individual is a human individual. Alternatively, the individual can be a mammal expressing CD22 to which an anti-CD22 antibody binds. Still further the individual can be a mammal into which CD22 has been introduced (e.g., by administration of CD22 or by expression of a transgene encoding CD22).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn anti-CD22 antibody or immunoconjugate can be administered to a human for therapeutic purposes. Moreover, an anti-CD22 antibody or immunoconjugate can be administered to a non-human mammal expressing CD22 with which the antibody cross-reacts (e.g., a primate, pig, rat, or mouse) for veterinary purposes or as an animal model of human disease. Regarding the latter, such animal models may be useful for evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of antibodies or immunoconjugates of the invention (e.g., testing of dosages and time courses of administration).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies or immunoconjugates of the invention can be used either alone or in combination with other compositions in a therapy. For instance, an antibody or immunoconjugate of the invention may be co-administered with at least one additional therapeutic agent and/or adjuvant. In certain embodiments, an additional therapeutic agent is a cytotoxic agent, a chemotherapeutic agent, or a growth inhibitory agent. In one of such embodiments, a chemotherapeutic agent is an agent or a combination of agents such as, for example, cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, adriamycin, doxorubincin, vincristine (Oncovin™), prednisolone, CHOP, CVP, or COP, or immunotherapeutics such as anti-CD20 (e.g., Rituxan®) or anti-VEGF (e.g., Avastin®), wherein the combination therapy is useful in the treatment of cancers and/or B cell disorders such as B cell proliferative disorders including lymphoma, non-Hogkins lymphoma (NHL), aggressive NHL, relapsed aggressive NHL, relapsed indolent NHL, refractory NHL, refractory indolent NHL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), small lymphocytic lymphoma, leukemia, hairy cell leukemia (HCL), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and mantle cell lymphoma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch combination therapies noted above encompass combined administration (where two or more therapeutic agents are included in the same or separate formulations), and separate administration, in which case, administration of the antibody or immunoconjugate of the invention can occur prior to, simultaneously, and/or following, administration of the additional therapeutic agent and/or adjuvant. Antibodies or immunoconjugates of the invention can also be used in combination with radiation therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn antibody or immunoconjugate of the invention (and any additional therapeutic agent or adjuvant) can be administered by any suitable means, including parenteral, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intrapulmonary, and intranasal, and, if desired for local treatment, intralesional administration. Parenteral infusions include intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous administration. In addition, the antibody or immunoconjugate is suitably administered by pulse infusion, particularly with declining doses of the antibody or immunoconjugate. Dosing can be by any suitable route, e.g. by injections, such as intravenous or subcutaneous injections, depending in part on whether the administration is brief or chronic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies or immunoconjugates of the invention would be formulated, dosed, and administered in a fashion consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated, the particular mammal being treated, the clinical condition of the individual patient, the cause of the disorder, the site of delivery of the agent, the method of administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to medical practitioners. The antibody or immunoconjugate need not be, but is optionally formulated with one or more agents currently used to prevent or treat the disorder in question. The effective amount of such other agents depends on the amount of antibody or immunoconjugate present in the formulation, the type of disorder or treatment, and other factors discussed above. These are generally used in the same dosages and with administration routes as described herein, or about from 1 to 99% of the dosages described herein, or in any dosage and by any route that is empirically/clinically determined to be appropriate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the prevention or treatment of disease, the appropriate dosage of an antibody or immunoconjugate of the invention (when used alone or in combination with one or more other additional therapeutic agents, such as chemotherapeutic agents) will depend on the type of disease to be treated, the type of antibody or immunoconjugate, the severity and course of the disease, whether the antibody or immunoconjugate is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes, previous therapy, the patient's clinical history and response to the antibody or immunoconjugate, and the discretion of the attending physician. The antibody or immunoconjugate is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments. Depending on the type and severity of the disease, about 1 μg/kg to 100 mg/kg (e.g. 0.1 mg/kg-20 mg/kg) of antibody or immunoconjugate can be an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient, whether, for example, by one or more separate administrations, or by continuous infusion. One typical daily dosage might range from about 1 μg/kg to 100 mg/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. For repeated administrations over several days or longer, depending on the condition, the treatment would generally be sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. One exemplary dosage of the antibody or immunoconjugate would be in the range from about 0.05 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg. Thus, one or more doses of about 0.5 mg/kg, 2.0 mg/kg, 4.0 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg (or any combination thereof) of antibody or immunoconjugate may be administered to the patient. Such doses may be administered intermittently, e.g. every week or every three weeks (e.g. such that the patient receives from about two to about twenty, or e.g. about six doses of the antibody or immunoconjugate). An initial higher loading dose, followed by one or more lower doses may be administered. An exemplary dosing regimen comprises administering an initial loading dose of about 4 mg/kg, followed by a weekly maintenance dose of about 2 mg/kg of the antibody. However, other dosage regimens may be useful. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAssays\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-CD22 antibodies and immunoconjugates of the invention may be characterized for their physical/chemical properties and/or biological activities by various assays known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nActivity Assays\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, assays are provided for identifying anti-CD22 antibodies or immunoconjugates thereof having biological activity. Biological activity may include, e.g., the ability to inhibit cell growth or proliferation (e.g., “cell killing” activity), or the ability to induce cell death, including programmed cell death (apoptosis). Antibodies or immunoconjugates having such biological activity in vivo and/or in vitro are also provided.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, an anti-CD22 antibody or immunoconjugate thereof is tested for its ability to inhibit cell growth or proliferation in vitro. Assays for inhibition of cell growth or proliferation are well known in the art. Certain assays for cell proliferation, exemplified by the “cell killing” assays described herein, measure cell viability. One such assay is the CellTiter-Glo™ Luminescent Cell Viability Assay, which is commercially available from Promega (Madison, Wis.). That assay determines the number of viable cells in culture based on quantitation of ATP present, which is an indication of metabolically active cells. See Crouch et al (1993) J. Immunol. Meth. 160:81-88, U.S. Pat. No. 6,602,677. The assay may be conducted in 96- or 384-well format, making it amenable to automated high-throughput screening (HTS). See Cree et al (1995) AntiCancer Drugs 6:398-404. The assay procedure involves adding a single reagent (CellTiter-Glo® Reagent) directly to cultured cells. This results in cell lysis and generation of a luminescent signal produced by a luciferase reaction. The luminescent signal is proportional to the amount of ATP present, which is directly proportional to the number of viable cells present in culture. Data can be recorded by luminometer or CCD camera imaging device. The luminescence output is expressed as relative light units (RLU).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother assay for cell proliferation is the “MTT” assay, a colorimetric assay that measures the oxidation of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide to formazan by mitochondrial reductase. Like the CellTiter-Glo™ assay, this assay indicates the number of metabolically active cells present in a cell culture. See, e.g., Mosmann (1983) J. Immunol. Meth. 65:55-63, and Zhang et al. (2005) Cancer Res. 65:3877-3882.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, an anti-CD22 antibody is tested for its ability to induce cell death in vitro. Assays for induction of cell death are well known in the art. In some embodiments, such assays measure, e.g., loss of membrane integrity as indicated by uptake of propidium iodide (PI), trypan blue (see Moore et al. (1995) Cytotechnology, 17:1-11), or 7AAD. In an exemplary PI uptake assay, cells are cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (D-MEM):Ham's F-12 (50:50) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Hyclone) and 2 mM L-glutamine. Thus, the assay is performed in the absence of complement and immune effector cells. Cells are seeded at a density of 3×10\n6 \nper dish in 100×20 mm dishes and allowed to attach overnight. The medium is removed and replaced with fresh medium alone or medium containing various concentrations of the antibody or immunoconjugate. The cells are incubated for a 3-day time period. Following treatment, monolayers are washed with PBS and detached by trypsinization. Cells are then centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5 minutes at 4° C., the pellet resuspended in 3 ml cold Ca\n2+\n binding buffer (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 140 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl\n2\n) and aliquoted into 35 mm strainer-capped 12×75 mm tubes (1 ml per tube, 3 tubes per treatment group) for removal of cell clumps. Tubes then receive PI (10 μg/ml). Samples are analyzed using a FACSCAN™ flow cytometer and FACSCONVERT™ CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson). Antibodies or immunoconjugates which induce statistically significant levels of cell death as determined by PI uptake are thus identified.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, an anti-CD22 antibody or immunoconjugate is tested for its ability to induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) in vitro. An exemplary assay for antibodies or immunoconjugates that induce apoptosis is an annexin binding assay. In an exemplary annexin binding assay, cells are cultured and seeded in dishes as discussed in the preceding paragraph. The medium is removed and replaced with fresh medium alone or medium containing 0.001 to 10 μg/ml of the antibody or immunoconjugate. Following a three-day incubation period, monolayers are washed with PBS and detached by trypsinization. Cells are then centrifuged, resuspended in Ca\n2+\n binding buffer, and aliquoted into tubes as discussed in the preceding paragraph. Tubes then receive labeled annexin (e.g. annexin V-FITC) (1 μg/ml). Samples are analyzed using a FACSCAN™ flow cytometer and FACSCONVERT™ CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Antibodies or immunoconjugates that induce statistically significant levels of annexin binding relative to control are thus identified. Another exemplary assay for antibodies or immunoconjugates that induce apoptosis is a histone DNA ELISA colorimetric assay for detecting internucleosomal degradation of genomic DNA. Such an assay can be performed using, e.g., the Cell Death Detection ELISA kit (Roche, Palo Alto, Calif.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCells for use in any of the above in vitro assays include cells or cell lines that naturally express CD22 or that have been engineered to express CD22. Such cells include tumor cells that overexpress CD22 relative to normal cells of the same tissue origin. Such cells also include cell lines (including tumor cell lines) that express CD22 and cell lines that do not normally express CD22 but have been transfected with nucleic acid encoding CD22.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, an anti-CD22 antibody or immunoconjugate thereof is tested for its ability to inhibit cell growth or proliferation in vivo. In certain embodiments, an anti-CD22 antibody or immunoconjugate thereof is tested for its ability to inhibit tumor growth in vivo. In vivo model systems, such as xenograft models, can be used for such testing. In an exemplary xenograft system, human tumor cells are introduced into a suitably immunocompromised non-human animal, e.g., a SCID mouse. An antibody or immunoconjugate of the invention is administered to the animal. The ability of the antibody or immunoconjugate to inhibit or decrease tumor growth is measured. In certain embodiments of the above xenograft system, the human tumor cells are tumor cells from a human patient. Such cells useful for preparing xenograft models include human leukemia and lymphoma cell lines, which include without limitation the BJAB-luc cells (an EBV-negative Burkitt's lymphoma cell line transfected with the luciferase reporter gene), Ramos cells (ATCC, Manassas, Va., CRL-1923), Raji cells (ATCC, Manassas, Va., CCL-86), SuDHL-4 cells (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany, AAC 495), DoHH2 cells (see Kluin-Neilemans, H. C. et al., Leukemia 5:221-224 (1991), and Kluin-Neilemans, H. C. et al., Leukemia 8:1385-1391 (1994)), Granta-519 cells (see Jadayel, D. M. et al, Leukemia 11(1):64-72 (1997)). In certain embodiments, the human tumor cells are introduced into a suitably immunocompromised non-human animal by subcutaneous injection or by transplantation into a suitable site, such as a mammary fat pad.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBinding Assays and Other Assays\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, an anti-CD22 antibody is tested for its antigen binding activity. For example, in certain embodiments, an anti-CD22 antibody is tested for its ability to bind to CD22 expressed on the surface of a cell. A FACS assay may be used for such testing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, competition assays may be used to identify a monoclonal antibody that competes with murine 10F4.4.1 antibody, humanized 10F4v1 antibody, humanized 10F4v3 antibody and/or murine 5E8.1.8 antibody for binding to CD22. In certain embodiments, such a competing antibody binds to the same epitope (e.g., a linear or a conformational epitope) that is bound by murine 10F4.4.1 antibody, humanized 10F4v1 antibody, humanized 10F4v3 antibody and/or murine 5E8.1.8 antibody. Exemplary competition assays include, but are not limited to, routine assays such as those provided in Harlow and Lane (1988) Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual ch. 14 (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.). Detailed exemplary methods for mapping an epitope to which an antibody binds are provided in Morris (1996) “Epitope Mapping Protocols,” in Methods in Molecular Biology vol. 66 (Humana Press, Totowa, N.J.). Two antibodies are said to bind to the same epitope if each blocks binding of the other by 50% or more.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an exemplary competition assay, immobilized CD22 is incubated in a solution comprising a first labeled antibody that binds to CD22 (e.g., murine 10F4.4.1 antibody, humanized 10F4v1 antibody, humanized 10F4v3 antibody and/or murine 5E8.1.8 antibody) and a second unlabeled antibody that is being tested for its ability to compete with the first antibody for binding to CD22. The second antibody may be present in a hybridoma supernatant. As a control, immobilized CD22 is incubated in a solution comprising the first labeled antibody but not the second unlabeled antibody. After incubation under conditions permissive for binding of the first antibody to CD22, excess unbound antibody is removed, and the amount of label associated with immobilized CD22 is measured. If the amount of label associated with immobilized CD22 is substantially reduced in the test sample relative to the control sample, then that indicates that the second antibody is competing with the first antibody for binding to CD22. In certain embodiments, immobilized CD22 is present on the surface of a cell or in a membrane preparation obtained from a cell expressing CD22 on its surface.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, purified anti-CD22 antibodies can be further characterized by a series of assays including, but not limited to, N-terminal sequencing, amino acid analysis, non-denaturing size exclusion high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), mass spectrometry, ion exchange chromatography and papain digestion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the invention contemplates an altered antibody that possesses some but not all effector functions, which make it a desirable candidate for many applications in which the half life of the antibody in vivo is important yet certain effector functions (such as complement and ADCC) are unnecessary or deleterious. In certain embodiments, the Fc activities of the antibody are measured to ensure that only the desired properties are maintained. In vitro and/or in vivo cytotoxicity assays can be conducted to confirm the reduction/depletion of CDC and/or ADCC activities. For example, Fc receptor (FcR) binding assays can be conducted to ensure that the antibody lacks FcγR binding (hence likely lacking ADCC activity), but retains FcRn binding ability. The primary cells for mediating ADCC, NK cells, express FcγRIII only, whereas monocytes express FcγRI, FcγRII and FcγRIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 9:457-92 (1991). An example of an in vitro assay to assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,500,362 or 5,821,337. Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and Natural Killer (NK) cells. Alternatively, or additionally, ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo, e.g., in a animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. PNAS (USA) 95:652-656 (1998). C1q binding assays may also be carried out to confirm that the antibody is unable to bind C1q and hence lacks CDC activity. To assess complement activation, a CDC assay, e.g. as described in Gazzano-Santoro et al., J. Immunol. Methods 202:163 (1996), may be performed. FcRn binding and in vivo clearance/half life determinations can also be performed using methods known in the art.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following are examples of methods and compositions of the invention. It is understood that various other embodiments may be practiced, given the general description provided above.\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\nPreparation of Murine Anti-Human CD22 Monoclonal Antibody\n\n\n \n \n \nMurine monoclonal antibodies capable of specifically binding human CD22 was prepared. BALB/c female mice, age six weeks, were immunized in their foot pads with purified human CD22 his-8 tagged extracellular \ndomain lacking domains\n 3 and 4 (SEQ ID NO:30 (ECD) plus the sequence GRAHHHHHHHH at the C-terminus) or CD22 his-8 tagged extracellular domain comprising domains 1-7 (SEQ ID NO:28 (ECD) plus the above His sequence tag) in Ribi's adjuvant. Subsequent injections were performed in the same manner at one and three weeks after the initial immunizations. Three days after the final injection, the inguinal and popliteal lymph nodes were removed and pooled, and a single cell suspension was made by passing the tissue through steel gauze. The cells were fused at a 4:1 ratio with mouse myeloma such as P3×63-Ag8.653 (ATCC CRL 1580) in high glucose (DMEM) containing 50% w/v polyethylene glycol 4000. The fused cells were then plated at a density of 2×105 per well in 96 well tissue culture plates. After 24 hours HAT selective medium (hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine, Sigma, #H0262) was added. Fifteen days after the fusion, supernatants of growing cells were tested for the presence of antibodies specific for human CD22 using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe murine anti-human CD22 10F4.4.1 (mu 10F4) and 5E8.1.8 (mu 5E8) monoclonal antibodies were selected for further study based on cell-based assays and plate assays which showed the antibodies to bind specifically to human CD22. The assays are described in the following paragraphs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nELISA-based assays: Anti-CD22 antibody screening by ELISA is performed as follows, with all incubations done at room temperature. Test plates (Nunc Immunoplate) were coated for 2 hours with purified CD22 in 50 mM sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.6, then blocked with 0.5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 30 minutes, then washed four times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST). Test antibody supernatants are added and incubated two hours with shaking, then washed four times with PBST. The plates are developed by adding 100 μl/well of a solution containing 10 mg of o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma, #P8287) and 10 □l of a 30% hydrogen peroxide solution in 25 ml phosphate citrate buffer, pH 5.0, and incubating for 15 minutes. The reaction is stopped by adding 100 μl/well of 2.5 M sulfuric acid. Data is obtained by reading the plates in an automated ELISA plate reader at an absorbance of 490 nm.\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\nFACS Based Assays for Analysis of Anti-Human CD22 Monoclonal Antibodies (MAbs)\n\n\n \n \n \nCHO cells expressing human CD22 on their surface were incubated with anti-CD22 hybridoma supernatant in 100 μl FACS buffer (0.1% BSA, 10 mM sodium azide in PBS, pH 7.4) for 30 minutes at 4° C. followed by one wash with FACS buffer. The amount of anti-CD22 binding was determined by incubating an aliquot of the antibody/cell mixture with a polyclonal FITC conjugated goat or rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Accurate Chem. Co., Westbury, N.Y.) (for murine test antibodies) or goat or rabbit anti-human IgG (for humanized antibodies) for 30 minutes at 4° C. followed by three washes with FACS buffer.\n\n\n \nExample 3\n\n\nPreparation of Humanized Anti-CD22 Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nHumanized 10F4 antibodies were generated wherein hypervariable region (HVR) amino acid residues (interchangeably referred to as complementarity determining regions or CDRs) were modified via site-directed mutagenesis (Kunkel et al., Methods Enzymol. (1987), 154:367-382) to arrive at two variants, humanized 10F4v1 and humanized 10F4v2 (also referred to herein as “10F4v1,” “hu10F4v1,” “10F4v2,” or “hu10F4v2,” respectively). A third version, humanized 10F4v3 (“10F4v3” or “hu10Fv3”), used in some studies disclosed herein has the same light and heavy chain amino acid sequences for the mature protein as hu10F4v2, but comprises a different signal sequence in the vector used for protein expression.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHumanization of the murine 10F4 antibody was preformed as disclosed herein. Briefly, the hypervariable regions of the light and heavy chains of murine 10F4 were cloned into modified consensus framework sequences to generate the light and heavy chain variable regions amino acid sequences shown in \nFIGS. 2A and 2B\n. Alternative light and heavy chain framework sequences that may be used as framework sequences of antibodies of the invention are shown in \nFIGS. 3 and 4\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA monovalent Fab-g3 display vector (pV0350-2B) phagemid having two open reading frames under control of the phoA promoter, essentially as described in Lee et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n340:1073-93 (2004), was used in the humanization of the 10F4 antibody. The first open reading frame comprised the \nE. coli \nheat stable STII signal sequence for protein secretion fused to the VL and CH1 domains of the acceptor light chain sequence. The second open reading frame comprised the STII signal sequence fused to the VH and CH1 domains of the acceptor heavy chain sequence followed by a truncated minor phage coat protein P3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe VH and VL domains from murine 10F4 (SEQ ID NOs:89 and 90, respectively) were aligned with the human subgroup III consensus VH (huIII) domain (SEQ ID NO:24) and human consensus kappaI (huK1) domain (SEQ ID NO:25), respectively. The amino acid sequences of the hypervariable regions (HVRs, interchangeably referred to herein as complimentary determining regions (CDRs)) of the murine anti-human CD22 MAb 10F4 were inserted into consensus framework sequences as follows. The light chain HVRs (HVR-L1 (Kabat positions 24-34), HVR-L2 (Kabat positions 50-56), and HVR-L3 (Kabat positions 89-97) of the mu 10F4 antibody were engineered into a human kappa I (huKI) consensus sequence antibody framework to produce the humanized 10F4v1 light chain (SEQ ID NO:17, \nFIG. 2B\n). The heavy chain HVRs (HVR-H1 (Kabat positions 26-35), HVR-H2 (Kabat positions 49-65), and HVR-H3 (Kabat positions 95-102) of the mu 10F4 antibody were engineered into a modified human subgroup III (humIII) consensus VH domain which differs from the humIII sequence at three positions: R71A, N73T, and L78A were used (see Carter et all, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:4285 (1992)) to produce the humanized 10F4v1 heavy chain variable region (SEQ ID NO:16, \nFIG. 2A\n). Genetic engineering of HVRs into the acceptor frameworks was performed by Kunkel mutagenesis using a separate oligonucleotide for each hypervariable region. The sequence of each clone was determined by standard DNA sequencing techniques. Hypervariable regions and framework regions shown in \nFIGS. 2A and 2B\n are numbered according to Kabat numbering (Kabat et al. (1991), supra). The light and heavy chains were sequenced and the amino acid sequences of the variable regions (including HVRs and framework regions (FRs)) of the huKI, the humIII, murine 10F4, humanized 10F4v1 and humanized 10F4v2 are shown in \nFIGS. 2A and 2B\n. Humanized 10F4v3 antibody has the identical amino acid sequence as 10F4v2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acid molecules encoding amino acid sequence variants of the antibody, antibody fragment, VL domain or VH domain are prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include, but are not limited to, isolation from a natural source (in the case of naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants) or preparation by oligonucleotide-mediated (or site-directed) mutagenesis, PCR mutagenesis, and cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared variant or a non-variant version of the antibody, antibody fragment, VL domain or VH domain. For example, libraries can be created by targeting VL accessible amino acid positions in VH, and optionally in one or more CDRs, for amino acid substitution with variant amino acids using the Kunkel method. See, for e.g., Kunkel et al., Methods Enzymol. (1987), 154:367-382 and the examples herein. Generation of randomized sequences is also described below in the Examples.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe sequence of oligonucleotides includes one or more of the designed codon sets for a particular position in a CDR (HVR) or FR region of a polypeptide of the invention. A codon set is a set of different nucleotide triplet sequences used to encode desired variant amino acids. Codon sets can be represented using symbols to designate particular nucleotides or equimolar mixtures of nucleotides as shown in below according to the IUB code.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIUB Codes\n\n\n \n \n \n \nG Guanine\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA Adenine\n\n\n \n \n \n \nT Thymine\n\n\n \n \n \n \nC Cytosine\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR (A or G)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nY (C or T)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nM (A or C)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nK (G or T)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nS (C or G)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nW (A or T)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nH (A or C or T)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nB (C or G or T)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nV (A or C or G)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nD (A or G or T)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nN (A or C or G or T)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, in the codon set DVK, D can be nucleotides A or G or T; V can be A or G or C; and K can be G or T. This codon set can present 18 different codons and can encode amino acids Ala, Trp, Tyr, Lys, Thr, Asn, Lys, Ser, Arg, Asp, Glu, Gly, and Cys.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOligonucleotide or primer sets can be synthesized using standard methods. A set of oligonucleotides can be synthesized, for example, by solid phase synthesis, containing sequences that represent all possible combinations of nucleotide triplets provided by the codon set and that will encode the desired group of amino acids. Synthesis of oligonucleotides with selected nucleotide “degeneracy” at certain positions is well known in that art. Such sets of nucleotides having certain codon sets can be synthesized using commercial nucleic acid synthesizers (available from, for example, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.), or can be obtained commercially (for example, from Life Technologies, Rockville, Md.). Therefore, a set of oligonucleotides synthesized having a particular codon set will typically include a plurality of oligonucleotides with different sequences, the differences established by the codon set within the overall sequence. Oligonucleotides, as used according to the invention, have sequences that allow for hybridization to a variable domain nucleic acid template and also can include restriction enzyme sites for cloning purposes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one method, nucleic acid sequences encoding variant amino acids can be created by oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis. This technique is well known in the art as described by Zoller et al, 1987, Nucleic Acids Res. 10:6487-6504. Briefly, nucleic acid sequences encoding variant amino acids are created by hybridizing an oligonucleotide set encoding the desired codon sets to a DNA template, where the template is the single-stranded form of the plasmid containing a variable region nucleic acid template sequence. After hybridization, DNA polymerase is used to synthesize an entire second complementary strand of the template that will thus incorporate the oligonucleotide primer, and will contain the codon sets as provided by the oligonucleotide set.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, oligonucleotides of at least 25 nucleotides in length are used. An optimal oligonucleotide will have 12 to 15 nucleotides that are completely complementary to the template on either side of the nucleotide(s) coding for the mutation(s). This ensures that the oligonucleotide will hybridize properly to the single-stranded DNA template molecule. The oligonucleotides are readily synthesized using techniques known in the art such as that described by Crea et al., Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA, 75:5765 (1978).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe DNA template is generated by those vectors that are either derived from bacteriophage M13 vectors (the commercially available M13mp18 and M13mp19 vectors are suitable), or those vectors that contain a single-stranded phage origin of replication as described by Viera et al., Meth. Enzymol., 153:3 (1987). Thus, the DNA that is to be mutated can be inserted into one of these vectors in order to generate single-stranded template. Production of the single-stranded template is described in sections 4.21-4.41 of Sambrook et al., above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo alter the native DNA sequence, the oligonucleotide is hybridized to the single stranded template under suitable hybridization conditions. A DNA polymerizing enzyme, usually T7 DNA polymerase or the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, is then added to synthesize the complementary strand of the template using the oligonucleotide as a primer for synthesis. A heteroduplex molecule is thus formed such that one strand of DNA encodes the mutated form of \ngene\n 1, and the other strand (the original template) encodes the native, unaltered sequence of \ngene\n 1. This heteroduplex molecule is then transformed into a suitable host cell, usually a prokaryote such as \nE. coli \nJM101. After growing the cells, they are plated onto agarose plates and screened using the oligonucleotide primer radiolabelled with a 32-Phosphate to identify the bacterial colonies that contain the mutated DNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe method described immediately above may be modified such that a homoduplex molecule is created wherein both strands of the plasmid contain the mutation(s). The modifications are as follows: The single stranded oligonucleotide is annealed to the single-stranded template as described above. A mixture of three deoxyribonucleotides, deoxyriboadenosine (dATP), deoxyriboguanosine (dGTP), and deoxyribothymidine (dTT), is combined with a modified thiodeoxyribocytosine called dCTP-(aS) (which can be obtained from Amersham). This mixture is added to the template-oligonucleotide complex. Upon addition of DNA polymerase to this mixture, a strand of DNA identical to the template except for the mutated bases is generated. In addition, this new strand of DNA will contain dCTP-(aS) instead of dCTP, which serves to protect it from restriction endonuclease digestion. After the template strand of the double-stranded heteroduplex is nicked with an appropriate restriction enzyme, the template strand can be digested with ExoIII nuclease or another appropriate nuclease past the region that contains the site(s) to be mutagenized. The reaction is then stopped to leave a molecule that is only partially single-stranded. A complete double-stranded DNA homoduplex is then formed using DNA polymerase in the presence of all four deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates, ATP, and DNA ligase. This homoduplex molecule can then be transformed into a suitable host cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs indicated previously the sequence of the oligonucleotide set is of sufficient length to hybridize to the template nucleic acid and may also, but does not necessarily, contain restriction sites. The DNA template can be generated by those vectors that are either derived from bacteriophage M13 vectors or vectors that contain a single-stranded phage origin of replication as described by Viera et al. ((1987) Meth. Enzymol., 153:3). Thus, the DNA that is to be mutated must be inserted into one of these vectors in order to generate single-stranded template. Production of the single-stranded template is described in sections 4.21-4.41 of Sambrook et al., supra.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to another method, a library can be generated by providing upstream and downstream oligonucleotide sets, each set having a plurality of oligonucleotides with different sequences, the different sequences established by the codon sets provided within the sequence of the oligonucleotides. The upstream and downstream oligonucleotide sets, along with a variable domain template nucleic acid sequence, can be used in a polymerase chain reaction to generate a “library” of PCR products. The PCR products can be referred to as “nucleic acid cassettes”, as they can be fused with other related or unrelated nucleic acid sequences, for example, viral coat proteins and dimerization domains, using established molecular biology techniques.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOligonucleotide sets can be used in a polymerase chain reaction using a variable domain nucleic acid template sequence as the template to create nucleic acid cassettes. The variable domain nucleic acid template sequence can be any portion of the heavy immunoglobulin chains containing the target nucleic acid sequences (ie., nucleic acid sequences encoding amino acids targeted for substitution). The variable region nucleic acid template sequence is a portion of a double stranded DNA molecule having a first nucleic acid strand and complementary second nucleic acid strand. The variable domain nucleic acid template sequence contains at least a portion of a variable domain and has at least one CDR. In some cases, the variable domain nucleic acid template sequence contains more than one CDR. An upstream portion and a downstream portion of the variable domain nucleic acid template sequence can be targeted for hybridization with members of an upstream oligonucleotide set and a downstream oligonucleotide set.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA first oligonucleotide of the upstream primer set can hybridize to the first nucleic acid strand and a second oligonucleotide of the downstream primer set can hybridize to the second nucleic acid strand. The oligonucleotide primers can include one or more codon sets and be designed to hybridize to a portion of the variable region nucleic acid template sequence. Use of these oligonucleotides can introduce two or more codon sets into the PCR product (ie., the nucleic acid cassette) following PCR. The oligonucleotide primer that hybridizes to regions of the nucleic acid sequence encoding the antibody variable domain includes portions that encode CDR residues that are targeted for amino acid substitution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe upstream and downstream oligonucleotide sets can also be synthesized to include restriction sites within the oligonucleotide sequence. These restriction sites can facilitate the insertion of the nucleic acid cassettes (i.e., PCR reaction products) into an expression vector having additional antibody sequence. In one embodiment, the restriction sites are designed to facilitate the cloning of the nucleic acid cassettes without introducing extraneous nucleic acid sequences or removing original CDR or framework nucleic acid sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acid cassettes can be cloned into any suitable vector for expression of a portion or the entire light or heavy chain sequence containing the targeted amino acid substitutions generated via the PCR reaction. According to methods detailed in the invention, the nucleic acid cassette is cloned into a vector allowing production of a portion or the entire light or heavy chain sequence fused to all or a portion of a viral coat protein (i.e., creating a fusion protein) and displayed on the surface of a particle or cell. While several types of vectors are available and may be used to practice this invention, phagemid vectors are the preferred vectors for use herein, as they may be constructed with relative ease, and can be readily amplified. Phagemid vectors generally contain a variety of components including promoters, signal sequences, phenotypic selection genes, origin of replication sites, and other necessary components as are known to those of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen a particular variant amino acid combination is to be expressed, the nucleic acid cassette contains a sequence that is able to encode all or a portion of the heavy or light chain variable domain, and is able to encode the variant amino acid combinations. For production of antibodies containing these variant amino acids or combinations of variant amino acids, as in a library, the nucleic acid cassettes can be inserted into an expression vector containing additional antibody sequence, for example all or portions of the variable or constant domains of the light and heavy chain variable regions. These additional antibody sequences can also be fused to other nucleic acids sequences, such as sequences that encode viral coat proteins and therefore allow production of a fusion protein.\n\n\n \nExample 4\n\n\nVariable Region Sequence Determination\n\n\n \n \n \nThe nucleic acid and amino acid sequences of the murine and humanized 10F4 monoclonal antibodies were determined by standard procedures. Total RNA was extracted from hybridoma cells producing the mouse anti-human CD22 10F4.4.1 monoclonal antibodies using the RNeasy® (Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany). The variable light (VL) and variable heavy (VH) domains were amplified using RT-PCR with degenerate primers. The forward primers were specific for the N-terminal amino acid sequences of the VL and VH regions of the antibody. Respectively, the light chain and heavy chain reverse primers were designed to anneal to a region in the constant light (CL) and constant heavy domain 1 (CH1), which is highly conserved across species. Amplified VH and VL were cloned into a pRK mammalian cell expression vector (Shields et al., J. Biol. Chem. 276:659-04 (2000)). The polynucleotide sequence of the inserts was determined using routine sequencing methods. The amino acid sequences of the murine chimeric 10F4 and humanized 10F4v1 and humanized 10F4v2 light and heavy chain variable regions are shown in \nFIGS. 2A and 2B\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHumanized 10F4v1 was further modified at HVR-L1 position 28 (N28) (SEQ ID NO:9) (see \nFIG. 2B\n. The asparagine residue at that position was replaced with a valine residue (N28V) to generate HVR-L1 (SEQ ID NO:10) for the hu10F4v2 and hu10F4v3 variants, which showed improved binding affinity. These variants comprise the same variable and constant domain sequences of the mature antibody and differ only in a signal sequence not found in the mature antibody of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional amino acid sequence modifications were generated at one or both of amino acids Asn28 (N28) and/or Asn30 (N30) of the HVR-L1 hypervariable region (see \nFIG. 2B\n) of hu10F4v1. Because N28 and N30 are possible sites for deamination, amino acid changes at these sites were tested. For example, Asparagine at position 28 (N28) was replaced alternatively with A, Q, S, D, V, or I, and Asparagine at position 30 (N30) was replaced alternatively with A or Q. Amino acid sequence changes in the HVR-L1 domain according to the invention are provided in Table 2 along with their binding affinities as tested by competition analysis in a phage ELISA assay (IC50) using standard procedures.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstitution Variants of hu 10F4v1 antibody\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAmino Acid\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nChange\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIn HVR-L1\n\n\nHVR-L1 SEQ ID\n\n\nBinding Affinity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFIG. 2B\n\n\nNO\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNo \nchange\n \n\n\n9\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(N28, N30)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nN28A, \nN30\n \n\n\n19\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nN28Q, \nN30\n \n\n\n20\n\n\n7.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nN28S, \nN30\n \n\n\n21\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nN28D, \nN30\n \n\n\n22\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nN28V, \nN30\n \n\n\n10\n\n\n7.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nN28I, \nN30\n \n\n\n23\n\n\n9.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nN28, \nN30A\n \n\n\n32\n\n\n7.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nN28, \nN30Q\n \n\n\n33\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor generation of full-length human IgG1 versions of humanized 10F4 antibody, the heavy and light chains are subcloned separately into previously described pRK plasmids (Gorman, C. M. et al. (1990), DNA Protein Eng. Tech. 2: 3). Appropriate heavy and light chain plasmids (depending upon the sequence change(s) desired) are cotransfected into an adenovirus-transformed human embryonic kidney cell line, known as 293 (Graham, F. L. et al. (1977), J. Gen. Virol. 36: 59), using a high efficiency procedure (Graham et al., supra & Gorman, C. M., Science 221: 551). Media is changed to serum free and harvested daily for up to 5 days. Antibodies are purified from the pooled supernatants using protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia). The eluted antibody is buffer exchanged into PBS by G25 gel filtration, concentrated by ultrafiltration using a Centriprep-30 or Centricon-100 (Millipore), and stored at 4° C. The concentration of antibody is determined using total IgG-binding ELISA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary heavy chain IgG1 constant domains according to the invention are depicted in \nFIG. 5A\n. An exemplary human light chain κ constant domain comprises, for example, RTVAAPSVFIFPPSDEQLKSGTASVVCLLNNFYPREAKVQWKVDNALQSGNSQESV TEQDSKDSTYSLSSTLTLSKADYEKHDVYACEVTHQGLSSPVTKSFNRGEC (SEQ ID NO:37). The full length amino acid sequence of h10F4v2 is shown in \nFIG. 5B\n in which the constant regions of the light and heavy chains are indicated by underlining. The h10F4v1, v2, and v3 antibodies are IgG1 isotype.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCharacterization of Anti-CD22 Antibodies\n\n\n \nExample 5\n\n\nEpitope Mapping\n\n\n \n \n \nThe epitopes of CD22 to which 10F4.4.1 and 5E8.1.8 antibodies bound were determined according to the following procedures. CD22 sequences lacking various of the seven immunoglobulin-like domains of the major CD22 isoform (CD22beta) were cloned and transformed into cells for stable expression. For example, CD22 variants lacking domain 1 (Δ1), domain 2 (Δ2), or \ndomains\n 3 and 4 (Δ3,4) were cloned, transformed into CHO cells, and expressed on the cells. Control cells expressed CD22beta. Deletions were performed using Stratagene QuikChange XL™ reagent kit. Deletion of \ndomain\n 1 was performed by deletion of amino acids 22-138; deletion of \ndomain\n 2 was performed by deletion of amino acids 139-242; and deleted \n \ndomains\n \n 3 and 4 were available as the minor isoform CD22alpha (deletion of amino acids 241-417). All amino acid numbers refer to the numbering of full length precursor CD22beta by Wilson, G. L. et al. (see \nFIG. 1\n in Wilson, G. L. et al., J. Exp. Med. 173:137-146 (1991)). \nFIG. 14\n is a diagram of the deleted domains. Binding was determined by flow cytometry using an isotype control. Binding of 10F4.4.1 was detected using goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa 488. Binding of 5E8.1.8 was detected using biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG plus streptavidin PE. An adverse affect on the binding of murine 10F4.4.1 or murine 5E8.1.8 antibodies in the absence of particular ECD domains indicated that the antibody bound those domains. Murine 10F4.4.1 and 5E8.1.8 showed the same binding characteristics under these conditions. Neither bound \nCD22 lacking domain\n 1 or \ndomain\n 2, and both bound \n \nCD22 comprising domains\n \n 1 and 2, but lacking \n \ndomains\n \n 3 and 4. Using this method, it was determined that 10F4.4.1 and 5E8.1.8 bind to \n \ndomains\n \n 1 and 2 of human CD22, within the sequence from \namino acid\n 22 to \namino acid\n 240 of SEQ ID NO:27 (see Wilson, G. L. et al., (1991) supra).\n\n\n \nExample 6\n\n\nCharacterization of Binding Affinity to Soluble Antigen\n\n\n \n \n \nThe binding affinity of murine and humanized 10F4 antibody for soluble CD22 extracellular domain (ECD) was determined by surface plasmon resonance measurement using a BIACOR® 3000 system (Biacore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.). Briefly, carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CM5, Biacore Inc.) were activated with N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's instructions. These activated chips were coated with anti-CD22 IgG1 antibody 10F4 (murine or humanized) by dilution to 5 μg/ml with 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, before injection at a flow rate of 5 μl/minute to achieve approximately 500 response units (RU) of coupled antibody. Next, 1M ethanolamine was injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of human CD22-beta-ECD-His tagged soluble antigen (approximately 500 nM to approximately 7.8 nM) were injected in PBS with 0.05\n% Tween\n 20 at 25° C. at a flow rate of 30 μl/min. Association rates (k\non\n) and dissociation rates (k\noff\n) were calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIAevaluation Software version 3.2). The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated as the ratio k\noff\n/k\non\n. Anti-CD22 antibody, RFB4, was used as a control (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, Calif., catalog no. CBL147).

Briefly, CHO cells stably expressing full length human CD22 (SEQ ID NO:27) or cynomolgus monkey (cyno) CD22 (SEQ ID NO:31). Anti-CD22 antibody (murine or humanized 10F4v1 or v2) was iodinated with Iodogen® [\n125\nI] reagent to a specific activity of approximately 10 μCi/μg. A cell-based, competitive binding assay was performed using serially diluted, unlabeled anti-CD22 antibody. Antibodies were allowed to bind to the cells for 4 hours at 4° C. Binding affinity, K\nD\n, of the antibodies was determined in accordance with standard Scatchard analysis performed utilizing a non-linear curve fitting program (see, for example, Munson et al., Anal Biochem, 107: 220-239, 1980).

Prior to conjugation, the antibodies were partially reduced with TCEP using standard methods in accordance with the methodology described in WO 2004/010957. The partially reduced antibodies were conjugated to the above drug-linker moieties using standard methods in accordance with the methodology described in Doronina et al. (2003) Nat. Biotechnol. 21:778-784 and US 2005/0238649 A1. Briefly, the partially reduced antibodies were combined with the drug linker moieties to allow conjugation of the moieties to cysteine residues. The conjugation reactions were quenched, and the ADCs were purified. The drug load (average number of drug moieties per antibody) for each ADC was determined by HPLC. Other useful linkers for the preparation of ADCs include, without limitation, BMPEO, BMPS, EMCS, GMBS, HBVS, LC-SMCC, MBS, MPBH, SBAP, SIA, SIAB, SMPB, SMPH, sulfo-EMCS, sulfo-GMBS, sulfo-KMUS, sulfo-MBS, sulfo-SIAB, sulfo-SMCC, and sulfo-SMPB, and SVSB (succinimidyl-(4-vinylsulfone)benzoate), and including bis-maleimide reagents: DTME, BMB, BMDB, BMH, BMOE, BM(PEO)\n3\n, and BM(PEO)\n4\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-CD22 ADCs are also produced by conjugation to lysine residues of the antibody. Lysines of the antibody are converted to sulfhydryl groups using, for example, Traut's reagent (Pierce Chemical Co.) as disclosed herein. The resultant sulfhydryl groups are reactive with linkers or linker drug molecules for the preparation of ADCs. Alternatively, ADC's are produced by reacting a lysine on an anti-CD22 antibody with the linker, SPP (N-succinimidyl 4-(2′-pyridyldithio) pentanoate, which may be already attached to a drug molecule or may be subsequently reacted with a drug molecule, such as a maytansinoid. For example, an antibody is modified by reaction with SPP, followed by conjugation with f as disclosed in Wang, L. et al., Protein Science 14:2436-2446 (2005), which reference is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Lysine residues on an anti-CD22 antibody may also be reacted with the linker, SMCC (Pierce Chemical Co.), at pH 7-9 such that the amine-reactive N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS ester) of SMCC forms a stable amide bond with the antibody. The sulfhydryl-reactive maleimide group of SMCC is reacted with the sulfhydryl group of DM1 at pH 6.5-7.5 (see Pierce Chemical Co., piercenet.com) to form the ADC. Lysine or cysteine residues are reacted with linker-drug to produce ADCs comprising an average drug load of approximately 1-8 linker drug molecules per antibody, alternatively 1-6, 1-4, 1-3 or 1-2 linker drug molecules per antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nADCs anti-CD22(RFB4)-SMCC-DM1 and anti-GP120-SMCC-DM1 were prepared according to this method, where RFB4-smcc-DM1 was prepared at low (1.95), medium (3.7) and high (6.75) drug loads. Anti-GP120-smcc-DM1 was prepared at high (6.1) drug load. These ADCs were shown to be efficacious in vivo, as shown in Example 9 and Table 9, herein below.\n\n\n \nExample 9\n\n\nEfficacy of Anti-CD22 Antibody Drug Conjugates\n\n\n \n \n \nIn Vitro Studies of Efficacy Determinants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe determinants of anti-CD22 ADC (or TDC) efficacy in a lymphoma cell line were determined. It is known that CD22 expressed on the surface of B cells is internalized upon binding of its ligand(s) or antibodies (Sato, S. et al., Immunity 5:551-562 (1996)). To test whether and how the level of B cell surface expression of CD22 and/or internalization of CD22 affect efficacy, the following in vitro studies were performed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSurface expression of human CD22 on multiple lymphoma cell lines. Nineteen lymphoma cell lines expressing varying amounts of CD22 on their surface were cultured and harvested in log phase growth. Cells were resuspended in FACS wash buffer (PBS; 0.5% bovine serum albumin; 0.1% sodium azide) containing 100 μg/ml each normal mouse IgG and normal human IgG and maintained on ice. Approximately 1×10̂6 cells/100 μl were stained with anti-huCD22 APC (mIgG1, clone RFB4, Southern Biotech #9361-11) or murine IgG1 APC isotype (BD Pharmingen #555751) for 30 minutes on ice. Dead cells were stained with 7-AAD (BD Pharmingen #559925). Data were acquired on a BD FacsCalibur™ flow cytometer and analyzed with FlowJo™ software. The IC50 determination for hu10F4v3-SMCC-DM1 or each free drug (DM1, MMAF, or MMAE) were determined by culturing lymphoma cells as above, harvesting the cultured cells in log phase and seeding 5,000 cells in 90 μl culture medium per well in 96 well plate. ADC and free drug were diluted serially within the detection range (starting at 300 μg/ml for ADC, or 90 nM for free drug and diluting to essentially zero assay target). Aliquots of 101 diluted ADC or free drug were added to replicate wells containing cells and incubated for 3 days at 37° C. To each well, 100 μl CellTiter Glo™ was added and incubated for 30 min. Chemiluminescence was detected and data were analyzed using Prism™ software. The results are shown in \nFIG. 6A\n, in which high surface CD22 levels correlate with low IC50 (higher efficacy) of hu10F4v3-SMCC-DM1. \nFIG. 6C\n indicates that a stronger correlation exists between the intrinsic sensitivity of the cells to free drug and the IC50 of the ADC.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInternalization of hu10F4v3-SMCC-DM1 was determined by FACS assay. Briefly, lymphoma cells were stained by standard FACS techniques with CD22-FITC (RFB4) in the presence of hu10F4v3-SMCC-DM1 and incubated on ice for 20-30 minutes. To determine CD22 levels on the cell surface after the initial staining, cells were washed in cold RPMI/10% FBS media and 200 μl pre-warmed RPMI/10% FBS was added and incubated at 37° C. for 15 minutes. 80 μl staining buffer and 20 μl heat-inactivated normal mouse serum (HI NMS) were added, followed by incubation on ice for 15 minutes. Anti-DM1-Alexa-647 was added, incubated on ice for 20-30 minutes and cells were washed and fixed with 200 μl PBS/1% paraformaldehyde prior to FACS analysis. To determine surface and internal staining of CD22 after the initial staining, cells were washed with cold RPMI/10% FBS, pre-warmed RPMI/10% FBS was added and the cells incubated for 15 minutes at 37° C. Cells were then washed with FACS Wash and fixed with Fix Reagent A (Dako™ #k2311) at room temperature for 15 minutes, and the step was repeated with Fix Reagent B (Dako™). Staining buffer and HI NMS were added and the cell mixture was incubated on ice for 15 min. Fix Reagent B was added, followed by anti-DM1-Alexa-647 and incubated at room temperature for 20-30 minutes. Cells were washed in FACS Wash and fixed in PBS/1% paraformaldehyde. FACS analysis was performed on each cell mixture (surface, surface post-internalization, and internal staining) using a BD FacsCalibur™ flow cytometer and analyzed with FlowJo™ software. The results are shown in \nFIG. 6B\n in which high amounts of internalized DM1 correlated with low IC50 (high efficacy); and in \nFIG. 6D\n in which internalized DM1 is visualized by fluorescent microscopy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn Vivo Efficacy Studies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo test the efficacy of toxin-conjugated or unconjugated anti-CD22 monoclonal antibodies for the ability to reduce tumor volume in vivo, the following protocol was employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSCID mice were each inoculated subcutaneously in the flank with 2×10\n7 \na human B-cell lymphoma cell line. The human cell lines included human Burkitt lymphoma cell lines Daudi, Ramos, and Raji cells (available from the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va., USA), and other B-cell lines including U-698-M cells and Su-DHL-4 cells (available from DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany; Su-DHL-4 cells were transfected with the luciferase reporter gene), DoHH2 cells (Kluin-Neilemans, H. C. (1991), supra), and Granta-519 (Mantle cell lymphoma cells, Jadayel, D. M. et al., Leukemia 11(1):64-72 (1997)), and BJAB-luc cells (BJAB human B-cell lymphoblastoid cell line which expresses reporter gene luciferase. When the tumors reached a mean tumor volume of between 100-200 mm3, the mice were divided into groups, and treated on \nday\n 0 by intravenous injection with toxin-conjugated antibody or unconjugated antibody as shown in Tables 4-16, below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-CD22 Maytansine Drug Conjugates Reduce B-Cell Tumor Volume\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSixty-five SCID mice were injected with 2×10̂7 BJAB-luc cells subcutaneously in a volume of 0.2 ml per mouse in the flank.

DNA encoding the 10F4v3 antibody, having the same variable and constant region sequences as 10F4v2 (light chain, SEQ ID NO:87; and heavy chain, SEQ ID NO:88, \nFIG. 5B\n), was mutagenized by methods disclosed herein to modify the light chain, the heavy chain or the Fc region of the heavy chain. DNA encoding the light chain was mutagenized to substitute cysteine for valine at Kabat position 205 in the light chain (sequential position 210) as shown in \nFIG. 17A\n (light chain SEQ ID NO:91 of humanized antibody 10F4v3 thiomab). DNA encoding the heavy chain was mutagenized to substitute cysteine for alanine at EU position 118 in the heavy chain (sequential position 121) as shown in \nFIG. 17B\n (heavy chain SEQ ID NO:92 of humanized antibody 10F4v3 thiomab). The Fc region was mutagenized to substitute cysteine for serine at \nEU position\n 400 in the heavy chain Fc region (sequential position 403) as shown in \nFIG. 17C\n (heavy chain SEQ ID NO:93).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreparation of Cysteine Engineered Anti-CD22 Antibodies for Conjugation by Reduction and Reoxidation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFull length, cysteine engineered anti-CD22 monoclonal antibodies (ThioMabs) expressed in CHO cells are dissolved in 500 mM sodium borate and 500 mM sodium chloride at about pH 8.0 and reduced with about a 50-100 fold excess of 1 mM TCEP (tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride; Getz et al (1999) Anal. Biochem. Vol 273:73-80; Soltec Ventures, Beverly, Mass.) for about 1-2 hrs at 37° C. The reduced ThioMab is diluted and loaded onto a HiTrap S column in 10 mM sodium acetate, \npH\n 5, and eluted with PBS containing 0.3M sodium chloride. The eluted reduced ThioMab is treated with 2 mM dehydroascorbic acid (dhAA) at \npH\n 7 for 3 hours, or 2 mM aqueous copper sulfate (CuSO\n4\n) at room temperature overnight. Ambient air oxidation may also be effective. The buffer is exchanged by elution over Sephadex G25 resin and eluted with PBS with 1 mM DTPA. The thiol/Ab value is checked by determining the reduced antibody concentration from the absorbance at 280 nm of the solution and the thiol concentration by reaction with DTNB (Aldrich, Milwaukee, Wis.) and determination of the absorbance at 412 nm.\n\n\n \nExample 11\n\n\nPreparation of Cysteine Engineered Anti-CD22 Antibody Drug Conjugates by Conjugation of Cysteine Engineered Anti-CD22 Antibodies and Drug-Linker Intermediates\n\n\n \n \n \nAfter the reduction and reoxidation procedures of Example 10, the cysteine engineered anti-CD22 antibody is dissolved in PBS (phosphate buffered saline) buffer and chilled on ice. About 1.5 molar equivalents relative to engineered cysteines per antibody of an auristatin drug linker intermediate, such as MC-MMAE (maleimidocaproyl-monomethyl auristatin E), MC-MMAF, MC-val-cit-PAB-MMAE, or MC-val-cit-PAB-MMAF, with a thiol-reactive functional group such as maleimido, is dissolved in DMSO, diluted in acetonitrile and water, and added to the chilled reduced, reoxidized antibody in PBS. After about one hour, an excess of maleimide is added to quench the reaction and cap any unreacted antibody thiol groups. The reaction mixture is concentrated by centrifugal ultrafiltration and the cysteine engineered anti-CD22 antibody drug conjugate is purified and desalted by elution through G25 resin in PBS, filtered through 0.2 μm filters under sterile conditions, and frozen for storage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreparation of hu 10F4v3 HC(A118C) thiomab-BMPEO-DM1 was performed as follows. The free cysteine on hu 10F4v3 HC(A118C) thiomab was modified by the bis-maleimido reagent BM(PEO)4 (Pierce Chemical), leaving an unreacted maleimido group on the surface of the antibody. This was accomplished by dissolving BM(PEO)4 in a 50% ethanol/water mixture to a concentration of 10 mM and adding a tenfold molar excess of BM(PEO)4 to a solution containing hu4D5Fabv8-(V110C) ThioFab in phosphate buffered saline at a concentration of approximately 1.6 mg/ml (10 micromolar) and allowing it to react for 1 hour. Excess BM(PEO)4 was removed by gel filtration (HiTrap column, Pharmacia) in 30 mM citrate, \npH\n 6 with 150 mM NaCl buffer. An approximate 10 fold molar excess DM1 dissolved in dimethyl acetamide (DMA) was added to the hu4D5Fabv8-(V110C) ThioFab-BMPEO intermediate. Dimethylformamide (DMF) may also be employed to dissolve the drug moiety reagent. The reaction mixture was allowed to react overnight before gel filtration or dialysis into PBS to remove unreacted drug. Gel filtration on S200 columns in PBS was used to remove high molecular weight aggregates and furnish purified hu 10F4v3 HC(A118C) thiomab-BMPEO-DM1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy the same protocols, control HC (A118C) MAb-MC-MMAF, control HC ThioMAb-MC-MMAF, control HCThioMAb-MCvcPAB-MMAE, and control HC ThioMab-BMPEO-DM1 were prepared.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy the procedures above, the following cysteine engineered anti-CD22 antibody drug conjugates were prepared and tested:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nthio hu thio-HC-10F4v3-MC-MMAF by conjugation of A118C thio hu 10F4v3 and MC-MMAF;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nthio hu thio-HC-10F4v3-MC-val-cit-PAB-MMAE by conjugation of A118C thio hu 10F4v3 and MC-val-cit-PAB-MMAE;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nthio hu HC-10F4v3-bmpeo-DM1 by conjugation of A118C thio hu HC-10F4v3 and bmpeo-DM1;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nthio hu LC-10F4v3-MC-val-cit-PAB-MMAE by conjugation of V205C thio hu LC-10F4v3 and MC-val-cit-PAB-MMAE; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \nthio hu Fc-10F4v3-MC-val-cit-PAB-MMAE by conjugation of S400C thio hu Fc-10F4v3 and MC-val-cit-PAB-MMAE.\n\n\n \nExample 12\n\n\nCharacterization of Binding Affinity of Cysteine Engineered ThioMAb Drug Conjugates to Cell Surface Antigen\n\n\n \n \n \nThe binding affinity of thio hu 10F4v3 drug conjugates to CD22 expressed on BJAB-lucs cells was determined by FACS analysis. Briefly, approximately 1×10̂6 cells in 100 μl were contacted with varying amounts of one of the following anti-CD22 ThioMAb drug conjugates: thio hu LC(V205C) 10F4v3-MCvcPAB-MMAE, thio hu Fc(S400C) 10F4v3-MCvcPAB-MMAE, thio hu HC(A118C) 10F4v3-MCvcPAB-MMAE, thio hu HC(A118C) 10F4v3-MC-MMAF, or thio hu HC(A118C) 10F4v3-BMPEO-DM1 (see \nFIGS. 18A-18E\n, respectively). Anti-CD22 antibody bound to the cell surface was detected using biotinylated goat anti-huFc plus Streptavidin-PE. The plots of \nFIGS. 18A-18E\n indicate that antigen binding was approximately the same for all of the thiomab drug conjugates tested.\n\n\n \nExample 13\n\n\nAssay for In Vivo Tumor Volume Reduction by Anti-CD22 ThioMab Drug Conjugates\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ability of the thiomab drug conjugates prepared according to Example 11 to reduce B-cell tumor volume in xenograft models was tested according to the procedure disclosed in Example 9, herein. To SCID mice having Granta-519 cell xenograft tumors, control and anti-CD22 humanized 10F4v3 thiomab drug conjugates were administered at \nDay\n 0 in the doses shown in Table 14, below.

The anti-CD22 10F4v3-HC(A118C)-MCvcPAB-MMAE TDC appeared to be the most efficacious of the test agents in this study. However, at the increased dose levels in this experiment, some efficacy was noted in the anti-HER2-HC(A118C)-MCvcPAB-MMAE controls. This activity is possibly attributable to release of the drug from the ADC in circulation. The anti-CD22 hu10F4-HC(A118C)-MC-MMAF and -BMPEO-DM1 test agents showed intermediate efficacy and, consistent with the increased stability of these linkers, the non-binding anti-HER2 controls showed little activity. \nFIG. 20D\n is a plot of percent weight change in the mice from the DOHH2 xenograft study showing that there was no significant change in weight during the first 14 days of the study.\n\n\n \nExample 14\n\n\nSafety of Anti-CD22 Drug Conjugates in Rats and Cynomolgus Monkeys\n\n\n \n \n \nThe hu10F4 anti-CD22 antibody cross-reacts with cynomolgus (cyno) monkey CD22 with an affinity equivalent to human CD22. The hu10F4 anti-CD22 antibody does not cross-react with rat CD22. As a result, the target-independent and target-dependent safety and toxicity of anti-CD22 drug conjugates were assessed in rat and cyno, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSafety and Toxicity in Rats.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor safety and toxicity studies in rats, two studies were performed. In one study, rats were dosed intravenously on \nDay\n 1 with hu10F4v3-SMCC-DM1, -SPP-DM1, -MC-vc-PAB-MMAE, or -MC-MMAF conjugates in which the drug was linked via a cleavable (-vc- or -spp-) or uncleavable (MC or SMCC (also referred to as MCC)) linker. Vehicle was administered as the control. Blood samples were collected on \nDay\n 5 for pharmacokinetic analysis, and on Day 12 (at necropsy). Clinical observations and body weight recordings were conducted at least three times per week. Serum AST (aspartate aminotransferase) was monitored as an indication of toxicity. Serum AST levels were increased at \nDay\n 5 relative to \nDay\n 0 in rats dosed with 20 mg/kg hu10F4v3-vcMMAE and hu10F4v3-SPP-DM1 comprising cleavable linkers (\nFIG. 21A\n). Neutrophil levels were increased at \nDay\n 5 relative to \nDay\n 0 in rats dosed with 20 mg/kg hu10F4v3-MC-MMAF or hu10F4v3-MCC-DM1 (uncleavable linkers, \nFIG. 21B\n). Neutrophil levels were decreased at \nDay\n 5 relative to \nDay\n 0 in rats dosed with hu10F4v3-vc-MMAE or hu10F4v3-SPP-DM1. Increased serum AST and decreased neutrophils in rats dosed with ADCs comprising cleavable linkers indicates increased toxicity of such ADCs\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the same rat study, six animals per group were dosed with 20, 40, or 60 mg/kg hu10F4v3-MC-MMAF or hu10F4v3-SMCC-DM1 at \nDay\n 1 and monitored for twelve days. In animals dosed with hu10F4v3-MC-MMAF, there were no observations in the following indicators: decreased body weight, increases in serum liver enzymes, decreases in platelets, or decreases in neutrophils. In rats dosed with hu10F4v3-SMCC-DM1, reversible decreased body weight and reversible increases in serum liver enzymes were observed at dose levels of 40 and 60 mg/kg, whereas reversible decreases in neutrophils and transient decreases in platelets were observed at 60 mg/kg doses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSafety and Toxicity in Cynomolgus Monkeys.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo assess safety and toxicity of anti-CD22 ADCs in a primate model, thirty cyno monkeys were assigned to the following treatment groups: vehicle control (6 animals), hu10F4v3-SMCC-DM1 at doses of 2, 4, and 6 mg/m̂2 drug dose (equivalent to 0, 10, 20, and 30 mg/kg antibody dose; 4 animals per dosage group), and hu10F4v3-MC-MMAF at doses of 2, 4, and 6 mg/m̂2 (4 animals per dosage group). Animals were dosed intravenously on \nDay\n 1 and \nDay\n 22. The animals were evaluated for changes in body weight, food consumption, and pathology indices. Blood samples were collected and assayed to assess toxicological, pharmacodynamic, and anti-drug antibody effects. One-half of the animals in each group were euthanized at each of \nDay\n 25 and \nDay\n 43 and tissue samples were collected.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNo noticeable body weight changes were noted in either ADC group. Levels of serum liver enzymes AST (aspartate aminotransferase), ALT (aminotransferase) and GGT (gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase) were assayed according to standard methods well known in the relevant arts. Reversible increases in serum liver enzymes were observed in animals dosed at 30 mg/kg with either ADC, although ALT was elevated in the DM1 group, whereas AST and GGT were elevated in the MMAF group. Sciatic nerve degeneration was minimal to mild in the DM1 group in 2 of 4 animals at a dose of 20 mg/kg and in 4 of 4 animals at a dose of 30 mg/kg. Sciatic nerve degeneration was minimal in the MMAF group in 1 of 4 animals at a dose of 30 mg/kg. Tissue from various organs was examined microscopically. Two of four animals in the 30 mg/kg MMAF group had lung lesions of unknown significance, whereas none were observed in the DM1 group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDepletion of peripheral B cells by the hu10F4v3-MC-MMAF and —SMCC-DM1 ADCs was determined by measuring CD20\n+\n cell levels in blood over 43 days in cyno monkeys dosed at \nDay\n 0 and \nDay\n 22. Blood collected periodically during the study was assayed by FACS using a fluorescently labeled anti-CD20 antibody. The anti-CD22 MMAF and DM1 ADCs deplete cyno peripheral B cells as shown in \nFIG. 22A\n (MMAF group) and \nFIG. 22B\n (DM1 group). No significant effects of MMAF or DM1 ADCs were observed for other lymphocyte populations as shown in \nFIGS. 23A and 23B\n in which it is shown that CD4\n+\n cells were not significantly depleted over the same time period.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHu10F4v3-SMCC-DM1 depleted germinal center B cells in the cyno monkey tonsil samples relative to control as shown in the photomicrographs in \nFIGS. 24A and 24B\n. Exemplary germinal centers are circled in \nFIG. 24A\n. Complete ablation of germinal center B cells was observed at the 10 mg/kg dose level as shown if \nFIG. 24B\n. The same results were obtained following administration of the hu10F4v3-MC-MMAF ADC under the same conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHu10F4v3-MC-MMAF dosed at 10 mg/kg depleted dividing B cells from the spleen follicle germinal centers of cyno monkeys. See the diagram in \nFIG. 25A\n and the tissue photomicrographs in \nFIGS. 25B and 25C\n. The same results were obtained when the hu10F4v3-SMCC-DM1 ADC was tested under the same conditions. Germinal centers appear as dark regions in \nFIG. 25B\n using Ki-67 stain and as unstained areas surrounded by dark regions when stained with detectably labeled anti-IgD in \nFIG. 25D\n. Loss of the germinal centers due to depletion of germinal center B cells by anti-10F4v3-MC-MMAF is shown in \nFIGS. 25C and 25E\n. Thus, these anti-mitotic drugs have an impact on proliferating B cell populations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following hybridoma has been deposited with the American Type Culture Collection, PO Box 1549, Manassas, Va., 20108, USA (ATCC):\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nATCC\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAccession\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCell Lines\n\n\nNo.\n\n\nDeposit Date\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHybridoma 10F4.4.1\n\n\nPTA-7621\n\n\nMay 26, 2006\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHybridoma 5E8.1.8\n\n\nPTA-7620\n\n\nMay 26, 2006\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese deposits were made under the provisions of the Budapest Treaty on the International Recognition of the Deposit of Microorganisms for the Purpose of Patent Procedure and the Regulations thereunder (Budapest Treaty).

The government has certain rights in the invention.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThis invention relates generally to methods and compositions for the regulation of apoptosis.\n\n\n \nINCORPORATION BY REFERENCE OF SEQUENCE LISTING\n\n\n \n \n \nThe contents of the text file named “20363-021C02USSeqList.txt”, which was created on Dec. 10, 2010 and is 5 KB in size, are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nProgrammed cell death, referred to as apoptosis, plays an indispensable role in the development and maintenance of tissue homeostasis within all multicellular organisms (Raff, Nature 356: 397-400, 1992). Genetic and molecular analysis from nematodes to humans has indicated that the apoptotic pathway of cellular suicide is highly conserved (Hengartner and Horvitz, Cell 76: 1107-1114, 1994). In addition to being essential for normal development and maintenance, apoptosis is important in the defense against viral infection and in preventing the emergence of cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiverse intrinsic death signals emanating from multiple subcellular locales all induce the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to activate Apaf-1 and result in effector caspase activation. Proteins in the BCL-2 family are major regulators of the commitment to programmed cell death as well as executioners of death signals at the mitochondrion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMembers of this family include both pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins and share homology in up to four conserved regions termed BCL-2 homology (BH) 1-4 domains (Adams and Cory, 1998). The family can be divided into three main sub-classes. The anti-apoptotic proteins, which include BCL-2 and BCL-X\nL\n, are all “multidomain,” sharing homology throughout all four BH domains. However, the pro-apoptotic proteins can be further subdivided and include multidomain proteins, such as BAX and BAK, which possess sequence homology in BH1-3 domains. The more distantly related “BH3-only” proteins are to date all pro-apoptotic and share sequence homology within the amphipathic α-helical BH3 region, which is required for their apoptotic function (Chittenden et al., 1995; O'Connor et al., 1998; Wang et al., 1996; Zha et al., 1997).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMultidomain pro-apoptotic proteins such as BAX and BAK upon receipt of death signals participate in executing mitochondrial dysfunction. In viable cells, these proteins exist as monomers. In response to a variety of death stimuli, however, inactive BAX, which is located in the cytosol or loosely attached to membranes, inserts deeply into the outer mitochondrial membrane as a homo-oligomerized multimer (Eskes et al., 2000; Gross et al., 1998; Wolter et al., 1997). Inactive BAK resides at the mitochondrion where it also undergoes an allosteric conformational change in response to death signals, which includes homo-oligomerization (Griffiths et al., 1999; Wei et al., 2000). Cells deficient in both BAX and BAK are resistant to a wide variety of death stimuli that emanate from multiple locations within the cell (Wei et al., 2001).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe BH3-only molecules constitute the third subset of this family and include BID, NOXA, PUMA, BIK, BIM and BAD (Kelekar and Thompson, 1998). These proteins share sequence homology only in the amphipathic α-helical BH3 region which mutation analysis indicated is required in pro-apoptotic members for their death activity. Moreover, the BH3-only proteins require this domain to demonstrate binding to “multidomain” BCL-2 family members. Multiple binding assays, including yeast two-hybrid, co-immunoprecipitation from detergent solubilized cell lysates and in-vitro pull down experiments indicate that individual BH3-only molecules display some selectivity for multidomain BCL-2 members (Boyd et al., 1995; O'Connor et al., 1998; Oda et al., 2000; Wang et al., 1996; Yang et al., 1995). The BID protein binds pro-apoptotic BAX and BAK as well as anti-apoptotic BCL-2 and BCL-X\nL \n(Wang et al., 1996; Wei et al., 2000). In contrast, BAD, NOXA and BIM as intact molecules display preferential binding to anti-apoptotic members (Boyd et al., 1995; O'Connor et al., 1998; Oda et al., 2000; Yang et al., 1995).\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention is based on the discovery that the BH3 domain from the BCL-2 family of proteins alone can function as a specific death ligand. The peptides are referred to herein as BH3 peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect the invention provides an isolated peptide having a sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, 2 or 10. The peptide induces BAK oligomerization and cytochrome c release from mitochondria. In another aspect the invention provides an isolated peptide having a sequence of SEQ ID NOs: 3-9 or 11. The peptide binds BCL-2 or MCL-1. For example, SEQ ID NO:1-5 binds BCL-2. Alternatively, SEQ ID NO: 6 and 7 bind MCL-1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso include in the invention is a chimeric peptide having a first domain and a second domain. The first domain having and amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NOs: 1-11. The second domain having a translocation sequence which facilitates transport across a biological membrane.

The peptide of the invention were derived in part from the BH3 domain of BID, BIM, BAD, BIK, NOXA, and BCLX polypeptides and initiate cell death either by activating pro-apoptotic members or by counteracting anti-apoptotic members, by displacing BH3 domains from their pockets. The peptides which activate pro-apoptotic members are referred to herein as “BID-like BH3 peptides” (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 1, 2, and 10) whereas the peptides that counteract anti-apoptotic members, are referred to herein as “BAD-like BH3 peptide” (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 3-7 and 11). The BID-like and BAD-like peptide are summarized below in Table 1 and are collectively referred to herein as BH3 peptides. Additionally, the invention provides methods and pharmaceutical compositions for treating pathophysiologies associated with apoptosis, e.g., cell proliferative disorders.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nK\nd\n \n\n\n \n\n\nIC50 (nM),\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nK\nd\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ\n\n\n(nM),\n\n\n \n\n\nBID\n\n\n \n\n\n%\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nID\n\n\nBCL-2\n\n\nSD\n\n\nDisplace-\n\n\nSD\n\n\nHelicity\n\n\nMCL-1\n\n\nSD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAmino Acid Sequence\n\n\nNO\n\n\nBinding\n\n\n+/−\n\n\nment\n\n\n+/−\n\n\n(222 nM)\n\n\nBinding\n\n\n(+/−)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nBIDBH3\n \n \nEDIIRNIARHLAQVGDSMDR\n \n \n\n\n1\n\n\n220\n\n\n30\n\n\n838\n\n\n192\n\n\n19.5\n\n\n283\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nBIMBH3\n \n \nMRPEIWIAQELRRIGDEFNA\n \n \n\n\n2\n\n\n74\n\n\n2\n\n\nND\n\n\n—\n\n\n15.8\n\n\n79\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nmBADBH3\n \n \nLWAAQRYGRELRRMSDEFEGSFKGL\n \n \n\n\n3\n\n\n39\n\n\n6\n\n\n173\n\n\n60\n\n\nND\n\n\n>2600\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nBADBH3\n \n \nNLWAAQRYGRELRRMSDEFVDSFKK\n \n \n\n\n4\n\n\n41\n\n\n11\n\n\nND\n\n\n—\n\n\n23.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nBIKBH3\n \n \nMEGSDALALRLACIGDEMDV\n \n \n\n\n5\n\n\n485\n\n\n272\n\n\n4920\n\n\n1648\n\n\n8.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNOXAABH3\n \n \nAELPPEFAAQLRKIGDKVYC\n \n \n\n\n6\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n—\n\n\n>30,000\n\n\n—\n\n\n5.1\n\n\n752\n\n\n334\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNOXABBH3\n \n \nPADLKDECAQLRRIGDKVNL\n \n \n\n\n7\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n—\n\n\n>30,000\n\n\n—\n\n\n11.6\n\n\n829\n\n\n149\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nBCLXBH3\n \n \nVIPMAAVKQALREAGDEFEL\n \n \n\n\n8\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n—\n\n\n>30,000\n\n\n—\n\n\n3.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIDBH3 mut\n\n\nEDIIRNIARHAAQVGASMDR\n\n\n9\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n—\n\n\n>30,000\n\n\n—\n\n\n16.4\n\n\n>2600\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBID-\nlike\n \n \nXXXXXXIAXXLXXXGDXXXX\n \n \n\n\n10\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nconsensus\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBAD-\nlike\n \n \nXXXXXXXXXXLXXXXDXXXX\n \n \n\n\n11\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nconsensus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBH3 Peptides\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention provides a BH3 peptide. No particular length is implied by the term “peptide”. In some embodiments, the BH3 peptide is less than 195 amino acids in length, e.g., less than or equal to 150, 100, 75, 50, 35, 25 or 15 amino acid in length. For example a BH3 peptide includes the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1-11. In various embodiments, the BH3 peptide includes the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1-2 or 10 where the peptide induces BAK oligomerization and cytochrome c mobilization (e.g., release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria). By BAK oligomerization is meant that the BH3 peptide induces the formation of BAK oligomers, e.g., dimers, trimers, etc. The oligomers are hetero-oligomers. Alternatively, the oligomers are homo-oligomers. In a further embodiment, the BH3 peptide stimulates apoptosis, e.g., programmed cell death. Alternatively the BH3 peptides includes the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3-5 or 11, where the peptide binds BCL-2 or other anti-apoptotic members of the BCL-2 family of proteins. Alternatively the BH3 peptides includes the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6 or 7, where the peptide binds MCL-1 or other anti-apoptotic members of the BCL-2 family of proteins. (See, Table 1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of BID-like BH3 peptides include a peptide which includes (in whole or in part) the sequence \nNH\n \n2\n-XXXXXXIAXXLXXXGDXXXX-\nCOOH \n(SEQ ID NO:10). Examples of BAD-like BH3 peptides includes (in whole or in part) the sequence \nNH\n \n2\n-XXXXXXXXXXLXXXXDXXXX-\nCOOH \n(SEQ ID NO:11). As used herein X may be any amino acid. Alternatively, the BID-like or BAD-like BH3 peptides include at least 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 15 or more amino acids of SEQ ID NO:10 or SEQ ID NO:11)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe BH3 peptides can be polymers of L-amino acids, D-amino acids, or a combination of both. For example, in various embodiments, the peptides are D retro-inverso peptides. The term “retro-inverso isomer” refers to an isomer of a linear peptide in which the direction of the sequence is reversed and the chirality of each amino acid residue is inverted. See, e.g., Jameson et al., \nNature, \n368, 744-746 (1994); Brady et al., Nature, 368, 692-693 (1994). The net result of combining D-enantiomers and reverse synthesis is that the positions of carbonyl and amino groups in each amide bond are exchanged, while the position of the side-chain groups at each alpha carbon is preserved. Unless specifically stated otherwise, it is presumed that any given L-amino acid sequence of the invention may be made into an D retro-inverso peptide by synthesizing a reverse of the sequence for the corresponding native L-amino acid sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the BH3 peptides are cyclic peptides. BH3 cyclic peptide are prepared by methods known in the art. For example, macrocyclization is often accomplished by forming an amide bond between the peptide N- and C-termini, between a side chain and the N- or C-terminus [e.g., with K\n3\nFe(CN)\n6 \nat pH 8.5] (Samson et al., \nEndocrinology, \n137: 5182-5185 (1996)), or between two amino acid side chains. See, e.g., DeGrado, \nAdv Protein Chem, \n39: 51-124 (1988).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreparation of BH3 Peptide\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBH3 peptides are easily prepared using modern cloning techniques, or may be synthesized by solid state methods or by site-directed mutagenesis. A BH3 peptide may include dominant negative forms of a polypeptide. In one embodiment, native BH3 peptides can be isolated from cells or tissue sources by an appropriate purification scheme using standard protein purification techniques. In another embodiment, BH3 polypeptides are produced by recombinant DNA techniques. Alternative to recombinant expression, BH3 peptides can be synthesized chemically using standard peptide synthesis techniques.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “isolated” or “purified” protein or biologically active portion thereof is substantially free of cellular material or other contaminating proteins from the cell or tissue source from which the BH3 peptide is derived, or substantially free from chemical precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized. The language “substantially free of cellular material” includes preparations of BH3 peptides in which the protein is separated from cellular components of the cells from which it is isolated or recombinantly produced. In one embodiment, the language “substantially free of cellular material” includes preparations of BH3 peptides having less than about 30% (by dry weight) of non-BH3 peptide (also referred to herein as a “contaminating protein”), more preferably less than about 20% of non-BH3 peptide, still more preferably less than about 10% of non-BH3 peptide, and most preferably less than about 5% non-BH3 peptide. When the BH3 peptide or biologically active portion thereof is recombinantly produced, it is also preferably substantially free of culture medium, i.e., culture medium represents less than about 20%, more preferably less than about 10%, and most preferably less than about 5% of the volume of the protein preparation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe language “substantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals” includes preparations of BH3 peptides in which the protein is separated from chemical precursors or other chemicals that are involved in the synthesis of the protein. In one embodiment, the language “substantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals” includes preparations of BH3 peptides having less than about 30% (by dry weight) of chemical precursors or non-BH3 peptide chemicals, more preferably less than about 20% chemical precursors or non-BH3 peptide chemicals, still more preferably less than about 10% chemical precursors or non-BH3 peptide chemicals, and most preferably less than about 5% chemical precursors or non-BH3 peptide chemicals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “biologically equivalent” is intended to mean that the compositions of the present invention are capable of demonstrating some or all of the same apoptosis modulating effects, i.e., release of cytocrome c or BAK oligomerization although not necessarily to the same degree as the BH3 polypeptide deduced from sequences identified from cDNA libraries of human, rat or mouse origin or produced from recombinant expression symptoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPercent conservation is calculated from the above alignment by adding the percentage of identical residues to the percentage of positions at which the two residues represent a conservative substitution (defined as having a log odds value of greater than or equal to 0.3 in the PAM250 residue weight table). Conservation is referenced to sequences as indicated above for identity comparisons. Conservative amino acid changes satisfying this requirement are: R-K; E-D, Y-F, L-M; V-I, Q-H.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBH3 peptides can also include derivatives of BH3 peptides which are intended to include hybrid and modified forms of BH3 peptides including fusion proteins and BH3 peptide fragments and hybrid and modified forms in which certain amino acids have been deleted or replaced and modifications such as where one or more amino acids have been changed to a modified amino acid or unusual amino acid and modifications such as glycosylation so long as the hybrid or modified form retains the biological activity of BH3 peptides. By retaining the biological activity, it is meant that cell death is induced by the BH3 polypeptide, although not necessarily at the same level of potency as that of the naturally-occurring BH3 polypeptide identified for human or mouse and that can be produced, for example, recombinantly. The terms induced and stimulated are used interchangeably throughout the specification.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred variants are those that have conservative amino acid substitutions made at one or more predicted non-essential amino acid residues. A “conservative amino acid substitution” is one in which the amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a similar side chain. Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined in the art. These families include amino acids with basic side chains (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.g., glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine), nonpolar side chains (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine, tryptophan), beta-branched side chains (e.g., threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine). Thus, a predicted nonessential amino acid residue in a BH3 polypeptide is replaced with another amino acid residue from the same side chain family. Alternatively, in another embodiment, mutations can be introduced randomly along all or part of a BH3 coding sequence, such as by saturation mutagenesis, and the resultant mutants can be screened to identify mutants that retain activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso included within the meaning of substantially homologous is any BH3 peptide which may be isolated by virtue of cross-reactivity with antibodies to the BH3 peptide described herein or whose encoding nucleotide sequences including genomic DNA, mRNA or cDNA may be isolated through hybridization with the complementary sequence of genomic or subgenomic nucleotide sequences or cDNA of the BH3 peptides herein or fragments thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChimeric and Fusion Proteins\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides BH3 chimeric or fusion proteins. As used herein, a BH3 or BID mutein “chimeric protein” or “fusion protein” comprises a BH3 or BID mutein polypeptide operatively linked to a non-BH3 polypeptide. An “BH3 peptide” refers to a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence corresponding to a BH3 peptide whereas a “non-BH3 peptide refers to a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence corresponding to a protein that is not substantially homologous to the BH3 peptide, e.g., a protein that is different from the BH3 peptide and that is derived from the same or a different organism. Within a BH3 peptide the BH3 peptide can correspond to all or a portion of a BH3 peptide. In one embodiment, a BH3 peptide fusion protein comprises at least one biologically active portion of a BH3 peptide. In another embodiment, a BH3 peptide fusion protein comprises at least two biologically active portions of a BH3 peptide. Within the fusion protein, the term “operatively linked” is intended to indicate that the BH3 peptide and the non-BH3 peptide are fused in-frame to each other. The non-BH3 peptide can be fused to the N-terminus or C-terminus of the BH3 peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, in on aspect the invention provides a chimeric peptide that include a first domain containing BH3 peptide operably linked to a second domain containing a translocation sequence\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “translocation sequence” refers to any sequence of amino acids that directs a peptide in which it is present to a desired cellular destination. For example the translocation sequence is polyarginine. Thus, the translocation sequence can direct or facilitate penetration of the peptide across a biological membrane, e.g., a phospholipid membrane, mitochondrial membrane, or nuclear membrane. For example the translocation sequence directs the peptide from outside the cell, through the plasma membrane, and into the cytoplasm or to a desired location within the cell, e.g., the nucleus, the ribosome, the mitochondria, the ER, a lysosome, or peroxisome. Alternatively, or in addition, the translocation sequence can direct the peptide across a physiological barrier such as the blood-brain barrier, the trans-mucosal barrier, or the hematoencephalic, hematoretinal, gastrointestinal and pulmonary barriers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, a BH3 peptide fusion protein comprises a BH3 peptide operably linked to the extracellular domain of a second protein. Such fusion proteins can be further utilized in screening assays for compounds that modulate BH3 peptide activity (such assays are described in detail below).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the fusion protein is a GST-BH3 peptide fusion protein in which the BH3 peptide sequences are fused to the C-terminus of the GST (i.e., glutathione S-transferase) sequences. Such fusion proteins can facilitate the purification of recombinant BH3 peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the fusion protein is a BH3 peptide-immunoglobulin fusion protein in which the BH3 peptide sequences comprising one or more domains are fused to sequences derived from a member of the immunoglobulin protein family. The BH3 peptide-immunoglobulin fusion proteins of the invention can be incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions and administered to a subject to inhibit an interaction between a BH3 peptide ligand and a BH3 peptide on the surface of a cell, to thereby suppress BH3 peptide-mediated signal transduction in vivo. In one nonlimiting example, a contemplated BH3 peptide ligand of the invention is a VHL polypeptide. The BH3 peptide-immunoglobulin fusion proteins can be used to affect the bioavailability of a BH3 peptide cognate ligand Inhibition of the BID α6 peptide ligand/BH3 peptide interaction may be useful therapeutically for both the treatment of proliferative disorders, as well as modulating (e.g., inducing or inhibiting) cell survival or apoptosis. For example, inhibition of the BH3 peptide ligand/BH3 peptide can be used to various disorders as described herein. Moreover, the BH3 peptide-immunoglobulin fusion proteins of the invention can be used as immunogens to produce anti-BH3 antibodies in a subject, to purify BH3 peptide ligands, and in screening assays to identify molecules that inhibit the interaction of BH3 peptide with a BH3 peptide ligand.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the fusion protein is a BH3 peptide-basic charged domain fusion protein in which the BH3 peptide sequences comprising one or more domains are fused to a basic peptide domain. The BH3 peptide-basic charged domain fusion proteins of the invention can be incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions and administered to a subject to inhibit an interaction between a BH3 peptide ligand and a BH3 peptide in a cell, to thereby suppress BH3 peptide-mediated signal transduction in vivo. Several examples of biologically active fusion proteins, comprising basic peptide domains, for direct delivery of proteins into human patients in the context of protein therapy are known in the art, including, but not limited to, the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) TAT protein, HIV-1 Rev protein, Drosophila Antennapedia or HIV-1 octaarginine protein. These basic peptide domains can be arginine-rich. These transducing proteins have been shown to have a membrane permeability and a carrier function for the delivery of proteins to the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells, both in vivo and in vitro. These cells can be mammalian cells (i.e. human cells) (Suzuki et al., J Biol Chem 276: 5836-40, 2001 and Suzuki et al., J Biol Chem 277: 2437-43, 2002).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA BH3 chimeric or fusion protein of the invention can be produced by standard recombinant DNA techniques. For example, DNA fragments coding for the different polypeptide sequences are ligated together in-frame in accordance with conventional techniques, e.g., by employing blunt-ended or stagger-ended termini for ligation, restriction enzyme digestion to provide for appropriate termini, filling-in of cohesive ends as appropriate, alkaline phosphatase treatment to avoid undesirable joining, and enzymatic ligation. In another embodiment, the fusion gene can be synthesized by conventional techniques including automated DNA synthesizers. Alternatively, PCR amplification of gene fragments can be carried out using anchor primers that give rise to complementary overhangs between two consecutive gene fragments that can subsequently be annealed and reamplified to generate a chimeric gene sequence (see, for example, Ausubel et al. (Eds.) C\nURRENT \nP\nROTOCOLS IN \nM\nOLECULAR \nB\nIOLOGY\n, John Wiley & Sons, 1992). Moreover, many expression vectors are commercially available that already encode a fusion moiety (e.g., a GST polypeptide). A BH3 peptide-encoding nucleic acid can be cloned into such an expression vector such that the fusion moiety is linked in-frame to the BH3 peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBH3 Nucleic Acids\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention additionally relates to nucleic acids that encode BH3 peptide. Nucleic acids encoding the BH3 peptides may be obtained by any method known in the art (e.g., by PCR amplification using synthetic primers hybridizable to the 3′- and 5′-termini of the sequence and/or by cloning from a cDNA or genomic library using an oligonucleotide sequence specific for the given gene sequence).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor recombinant expression of one or more BH3 peptides, the nucleic acid containing all or a portion of the nucleotide sequence encoding the peptide may be inserted into an appropriate expression vector (i.e., a vector that contains the necessary elements for the transcription and translation of the inserted peptide coding sequence). In some embodiments, the regulatory elements are heterologous (i.e., not the native gene promoter). Alternately, the necessary transcriptional and translational signals may also be supplied by the native promoter for the genes and/or their flanking regions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of host-vector systems may be utilized to express the peptide coding sequence(s). These include, but are not limited to: (i) mammalian cell systems that are infected with vaccinia virus, adenovirus, and the like; (ii) insect cell systems infected with baculovirus and the like; (iii) yeast containing yeast vectors or (iv) bacteria transformed with bacteriophage, DNA, plasmid DNA, or cosmid DNA. Depending upon the host-vector system utilized, any one of a number of suitable transcription and translation elements may be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPromoter/enhancer sequences within expression vectors may utilize plant, animal, insect, or fungus regulatory sequences, as provided in the invention. For example, promoter/enhancer elements can be used from yeast and other fungi (e.g., the GAL4 promoter, the alcohol dehydrogenase promoter, the phosphoglycerol kinase promoter, the alkaline phosphatase promoter). Alternatively, or in addition, they may include animal transcriptional control regions, e.g., (i) the insulin gene control region active within pancreatic β-cells (see, e.g., Hanahan, et al., 1985. \nNature \n315: 115-122); (ii) the immunoglobulin gene control region active within lymphoid cells (see, e.g., Grosschedl, et al., 1984. \nCell \n38: 647-658); (iii) the albumin gene control region active within liver (see, e.g., Pinckert, et al., 1987. \nGenes and Dev \n1: 268-276; (iv) the myelin basic protein gene control region active within brain oligodendrocyte cells (see, e.g., Readhead, et al., 1987. \nCell \n48: 703-712); and (v) the gonadotropin-releasing hormone gene control region active within the hypothalamus (see, e.g., Mason, et al., 1986. \nScience \n234: 1372-1378), and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExpression vectors or their derivatives include, e.g. human or animal viruses (e.g., vaccinia virus or adenovirus); insect viruses (e.g., baculovirus); yeast vectors; bacteriophage vectors (e.g., lambda phage); plasmid vectors and cosmid vectors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA host cell strain may be selected that modulates the expression of inserted sequences of interest, or modifies or processes expressed peptides encoded by the sequences in the specific manner desired. In addition, expression from certain promoters may be enhanced in the presence of certain inducers in a selected host strain; thus facilitating control of the expression of a genetically-engineered peptides. Moreover, different host cells possess characteristic and specific mechanisms for the translational and post-translational processing and modification (e.g., glycosylation, phosphorylation, and the like) of expressed peptides. Appropriate cell lines or host systems may thus be chosen to ensure the desired modification and processing of the foreign peptide is achieved. For example, peptide expression within a bacterial system can be used to produce an unglycosylated core peptide; whereas expression within mammalian cells ensures “native” glycosylation of a heterologous peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso included in the invention are derivatives, fragments, homologs, analogs and variants of BH3 peptides and nucleic acids encoding these peptides. For nucleic acids, derivatives, fragments, and analogs provided herein are defined as sequences of at least 6 (contiguous) nucleic acids, and which have a length sufficient to allow for specific hybridization. For amino acids, derivatives, fragments, and analogs provided herein are defined as sequences of at least 4 (contiguous) amino acids, a length sufficient to allow for specific recognition of an epitope.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe length of the fragments is less than the length of the corresponding full-length nucleic acid or polypeptide from which the BH3 peptides s, or nucleic acid encoding same, is derived. Derivatives and analogs may be full length or other than full length, if the derivative or analog contains a modified nucleic acid or amino acid. Derivatives or analogs of the BH3 peptides include, e.g., molecules including regions that are substantially homologous to the peptides, in various embodiments, by at least about 30%, 50%, 70%, 80%, or 95%, 98%, or even 99%, identity over an amino acid sequence of identical size or when compared to an aligned sequence in which the alignment is done by a computer homology program known in the art. For example sequence identity can be measured using sequence analysis software (Sequence Analysis Software Package of the Genetics Computer Group, University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center, 1710 University Avenue, Madison, Wis. 53705), with the default parameters therein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the case of polypeptide sequences, which are less than 100% identical to a reference sequence, the non-identical positions are preferably, but not necessarily, conservative substitutions for the reference sequence. Conservative substitutions typically include substitutions within the following groups: glycine and alanine; valine, isoleucine, and leucine; aspartic acid and glutamic acid; asparagine and glutamine; serine and threonine; lysine and arginine; and phenylalanine and tyrosine. Thus, included in the invention are peptides having mutated sequences such that they remain homologous, e.g. in sequence, in function, and in antigenic character or other function, with a protein having the corresponding parent sequence. Such mutations can, for example, be mutations involving conservative amino acid changes, e.g., changes between amino acids of broadly similar molecular properties. For example, interchanges within the aliphatic group alanine, valine, leucine and isoleucine can be considered as conservative. Sometimes substitution of glycine for one of these can also be considered conservative. Other conservative interchanges include those within the aliphatic group aspartate and glutamate; within the amide group asparagine and glutamine; within the hydroxyl group serine and threonine; within the aromatic group phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan; within the basic group lysine, arginine and histidine; and within the sulfur-containing group methionine and cysteine. Sometimes substitution within the group methionine and leucine can also be considered conservative. Preferred conservative substitution groups are aspartate-glutamate; asparagine-glutamine; valine-leucine-isoleucine; alanine-valine; phenylalanine-tyrosine; and lysine-arginine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere a particular polypeptide is said to have a specific percent identity to a reference polypeptide of a defined length, the percent identity is relative to the reference peptide. Thus, a peptide that is 50% identical to a reference polypeptide that is 100 amino acids long can be a 50 amino acid polypeptide that is completely identical to a 50 amino acid long portion of the reference polypeptide. It might also be a 100 amino acid long polypeptide, which is 50% identical to the reference polypeptide over its entire length. Of course, other polypeptides will meet the same criteria.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also encompasses allelic variants of the disclosed polynucleotides or peptides; that is, naturally-occurring alternative forms of the isolated polynucleotide that also encode peptides that are identical, homologous or related to that encoded by the polynucleotides. Alternatively, non-naturally occurring variants may be produced by mutagenesis techniques or by direct synthesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecies homologs of the disclosed polynucleotides and peptides are also provided by the present invention. “Variant” refers to a polynucleotide or polypeptide differing from the polynucleotide or polypeptide of the present invention, but retaining essential properties thereof. Generally, variants are overall closely similar, and in many regions, identical to the polynucleotide or polypeptide of the present invention. The variants may contain alterations in the coding regions, non-coding regions, or both.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, altered sequences include insertions such that the overall amino acid sequence is lengthened while the protein retains trafficking properties. Additionally, altered sequences may include random or designed internal deletions that shorten the overall amino acid sequence while the protein retains transport properties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe altered sequences can additionally or alternatively be encoded by polynucleotides that hybridize under stringent conditions with the appropriate strand of the naturally-occurring polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide or peptide from which the BH3 peptide is derived. The variant peptide can be tested for BH3 peptide-binding and modulation of BH3 peptide-mediated activity using the herein described assays. ‘Stringent conditions’ are sequence dependent and will be different in different circumstances. Generally, stringent conditions can be selected to be about 5° C. lower than the thermal melting point (T\nM\n) for the specific sequence at a defined ionic strength and pH. The T\nM \nis the temperature (under defined ionic strength and pH) at which 50% of the target sequence hybridizes to a perfectly matched probe. Typically, stringent conditions will be those in which the salt concentration is at least about 0.02 molar at \npH\n 7 and the temperature is at least about 60° C. As other factors may affect the stringency of hybridization (including, among others, base composition and size of the complementary strands), the presence of organic solvents and the extent of base mismatching, the combination of parameters is more important than the absolute measure of any one.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHigh stringency can include, e.g., Step 1: Filters containing DNA are pretreated for 8 hours to overnight at 65° C. in buffer composed of 6×SSC, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, 0.02% PVP, 0.02% Ficoll, 0.02% BSA, and 500 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Step 2: Filters are hybridized for 48 hours at 65° C. in the above prehybridization mixture to which is added 100 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA and 5-20×10\n6 \ncpm of \n32\nP-labeled probe. Step 3: Filters are washed for 1 hour at 37° C. in a solution containing 2×SSC, 0.01% PVP, 0.01% Ficoll, and 0.01% BSA. This is followed by a wash in 0.1×SSC at 50° C. for 45 minutes. Step 4: Filters are autoradiographed. Other conditions of high stringency that may be used are well known in the art. See, e.g., Ausubel et al., (eds.), 1993, C\nURRENT \nP\nROTOCOLS IN \nM\nOLECULAR \nB\nIOLOGY\n, John Wiley and Sons, NY; and Kriegler, 1990, G\nENE \nT\nRANSFER AND \nE\nXPRESSION\n, A L\nABORATORY \nM\nANUAL\n, Stockton Press, NY.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModerate stringency conditions can include the following: Step 1: Filters containing DNA are pretreated for 6 hours at 55° C. in a solution containing 6×SSC, 5×Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS and 100 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Step 2: Filters are hybridized for 18-20 hours at 55° C. in the same solution with 5-20×106 cpm \n32\nP-labeled probe added. Step 3: Filters are washed at 37° C. for 1 hour in a solution containing 2×SSC, 0.1% SDS, then washed twice for 30 minutes at 60° C. in a solution containing 1×SSC and 0.1% SDS. Step 4: Filters are blotted dry and exposed for autoradiography. Other conditions of moderate stringency that may be used are well-known in the art. See, e.g., Ausubel et al., (eds.), 1993, C\nURRENT \nP\nROTOCOLS IN \nM\nOLECULAR \nB\nIOLOGY\n, John Wiley and Sons, NY; and Kriegler, 1990, G\nENE \nT\nRANSFER AND \nE\nXPRESSION\n, A L\nABORATORY \nM\nANUAL\n, Stockton Press, NY.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLow stringency can include: Step 1: Filters containing DNA are pretreated for 6 hours at 40° C. in a solution containing 35% formamide, 5×SSC, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM EDTA, 0.1% PVP, 0.1% Ficoll, 1% BSA, and 500 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Step 2: Filters are hybridized for 18-20 hours at 40° C. in the same solution with the addition of 0.02% PVP, 0.02% Ficoll, 0.2% BSA, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 10% (wt/vol) dextran sulfate, and 5-20×106 cpm \n32\nP-labeled probe. Step 3: Filters are washed for 1.5 hours at 55° C. in a solution containing 2×SSC, 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mM EDTA, and 0.1% SDS. The wash solution is replaced with fresh solution and incubated an additional 1.5 hours at 60° C. Step 4: Filters are blotted dry and exposed for autoradiography. If necessary, filters are washed for a third time at 65-68° C. and reexposed to film. Other conditions of low stringency that may be used are well known in the art (e.g., as employed for cross-species hybridizations). See, e.g., Ausubel et al., (eds.), 1993, C\nURRENT \nP\nROTOCOLS IN \nM\nOLECULAR \nB\nIOLOGY\n, John Wiley and Sons, NY; and Kriegler, 1990, G\nENE \nT\nRANSFER AND \nE\nXPRESSION\n, A L\nABORATORY \nM\nANUAL\n, Stockton Press, NY.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBH3 Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso included in the invention are antibodies to BH3 peptides or fragments thereof. The term “antibody” as used herein refers to immunoglobulin molecules and immunologically active portions of immunoglobulin (Ig) molecules, i.e., molecules that contain an antigen binding site that specifically binds (immunoreacts with) an antigen. Such antibodies include, but are not limited to, polyclonal, monoclonal, chimeric, single chain, F\nab\n, F\nab′\n and F\n(ab′)2 \nfragments, and an F\nab \nexpression library. In general, an antibody molecule obtained from humans relates to any of the classes IgG, IgM, IgA, IgE and IgD, which differ from one another by the nature of the heavy chain present in the molecule. Certain classes have subclasses as well, such as IgG\n1\n, IgG\n2\n, and others. Furthermore, in humans, the light chain may be a kappa chain or a lambda chain. Reference herein to antibodies includes a reference to all such classes, subclasses and types of human antibody species.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn isolated BH3-related protein of the invention may be intended to serve as an antigen, or a portion or fragment thereof, and additionally can be used as an immunogen to generate antibodies that immunospecifically bind the antigen, using standard techniques for polyclonal and monoclonal antibody preparation. The full-length protein can be used or, alternatively, the invention provides antigenic peptide fragments of the antigen for use as immunogens. An antigenic peptide fragment comprises at least 6 amino acid residues of the amino acid sequence of the full length protein, or amino acid sequences as shown in SEQ ID NOs:1-7, and encompasses an epitope thereof such that an antibody raised against the peptide forms a specific immune complex with the full length protein or with any fragment that contains the epitope. By epitope reference is made to an antigenic determinant of a polypeptide. Typically, epitopes contain hydrophilic amino acids such that the particular region of the polypeptide is located on its surface and likely to be exposed in an aqueous based milieu. Preferably, the antigenic peptide comprises at least 3 amino acid residues in a spatial conformation which is unique to the epitope. Generally, the antigenic peptide comprises at least 5 amino acid residues, or at least 10 amino acid residues, or at least 15 amino acid residues, or at least 20 amino acid residues, or at least 30 amino acid residues. Furthermore, antibodies to a BH3 peptide or fragments thereof can also be raised against oligopeptides that include a conserved region such as the α6 helix domain of BID identified herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments of the invention, at least one epitope encompassed by the antigenic peptide is a region of BH3 that is located on the surface of the protein, e.g., a hydrophilic region. A hydrophobicity analysis of the human BH3 sequence will indicate which regions of a BH3 are particularly hydrophilic and, therefore, are likely to encode surface residues useful for targeting antibody production. As a means for targeting antibody production, hydropathy plots showing regions of hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity may be generated by any method well known in the art, including, for example, the Kyte Doolittle or the Hopp Woods methods, either with or without Fourier transformation. See, e.g., Hopp and Woods, 1981, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 78: 3824-3828; Kyte and Doolittle 1982, J. Mol. Biol. 157: 105-142, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Antibodies that are specific for one or more domains within an antigenic protein, or derivatives, fragments, analogs or homologs thereof, are also provided herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA protein of the invention, or a derivative, fragment, analog, homolog or ortholog thereof, may be utilized as an immunogen in the generation of antibodies that immunospecifically bind these protein components.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious procedures known within the art may be used for the production of polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies directed against a protein of the invention, or against derivatives, fragments, analogs homologs or orthologs thereof (see, for example, Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Harlow E, and Lane D, 1988, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., incorporated herein by reference). Some of these antibodies are discussed below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolyclonal Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the production of polyclonal antibodies, various suitable host animals (e.g., rabbit, goat, mouse or other mammal) may be immunized by one or more injections with the native protein, a synthetic variant thereof, or a derivative of the foregoing. An appropriate immunogenic preparation can contain, for example, the naturally occurring immunogenic protein, a chemically synthesized polypeptide representing the immunogenic protein, or a recombinantly expressed immunogenic protein. Furthermore, the protein may be conjugated to a second protein known to be immunogenic in the mammal being immunized. Examples of such immunogenic proteins include but are not limited to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, serum albumin, bovine thyroglobulin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor. The preparation can further include an adjuvant. Various adjuvants used to increase the immunological response include, but are not limited to, Freund's (complete and incomplete), mineral gels (e.g., aluminum hydroxide), surface active substances (e.g., lysolecithin, pluronic polyols, polyanions, peptides, oil emulsions, dinitrophenol, etc.), adjuvants usable in humans such as Bacille Calmette-Guerin and \nCorynebacterium parvum\n, or similar immunostimulatory agents. Additional examples of adjuvants which can be employed include MPL-TDM adjuvant (monophosphoryl Lipid A, synthetic trehalose dicorynomycolate) and CpG dinucleotide motifs (Krieg, A. M. Biochim Biophys Acta 1489(1):107-16, 1999).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe polyclonal antibody molecules directed against the immunogenic protein can be isolated from the mammal (e.g., from the blood) and further purified by well known techniques, such as affinity chromatography using protein A or protein G, which provide primarily the IgG fraction of immune serum. Subsequently, or alternatively, the specific antigen which is the target of the immunoglobulin sought, or an epitope thereof, may be immobilized on a column to purify the immune specific antibody by immunoaffinity chromatography. Purification of immunoglobulins is discussed, for example, by D. Wilkinson (The Scientist, published by The Scientist, Inc., Philadelphia Pa., Vol. 14, No. 8 (Apr. 17, 2000), pp. 25-28).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMonoclonal Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “monoclonal antibody” (MAb) or “monoclonal antibody composition”, as used herein, refers to a population of antibody molecules that contain only one molecular species of antibody molecule consisting of a unique light chain gene product and a unique heavy chain gene product. In particular, the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of the monoclonal antibody are identical in all the molecules of the population. MAbs thus contain an antigen binding site capable of immunoreacting with a particular epitope of the antigen characterized by a unique binding affinity for it.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMonoclonal antibodies can be prepared using hybridoma methods, such as those described by Kohler and Milstein, Nature, 256:495 (1975). In a hybridoma method, a mouse, hamster, or other appropriate host animal, is typically immunized with an immunizing agent to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the immunizing agent. Alternatively, the lymphocytes can be immunized in vitro.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe immunizing agent will typically include the protein antigen, a fragment thereof or a fusion protein thereof. Generally, either peripheral blood lymphocytes are used if cells of human origin are desired, or spleen cells or lymph node cells are used if non-human mammalian sources are desired. The lymphocytes are then fused with an immortalized cell line using a suitable fusing agent, such as polyethylene glycol, to form a hybridoma cell (Goding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, Academic Press, (1986) pp. 59-103) Immortalized cell lines are usually transformed mammalian cells, particularly myeloma cells of rodent, bovine and human origin. Usually, rat or mouse myeloma cell lines are employed. The hybridoma cells can be cultured in a suitable culture medium that preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused, immortalized cells. For example, if the parental cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (“HAT medium”), which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred immortalized cell lines are those that fuse efficiently, support stable high level expression of antibody by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. More preferred immortalized cell lines are murine myeloma lines, which can be obtained, for instance, from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, Calif. and the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies (Kozbor, J. Immunol., 133:3001 (1984); Brodeur et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, (1987) pp. 51-63).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe culture medium in which the hybridoma cells are cultured can then be assayed for the presence of monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen. Preferably, the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by the hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA). Such techniques and assays are known in the art. The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can, for example, be determined by the Scatchard analysis of Munson and Pollard, Anal. Biochem., 107:220 (1980). Preferably, antibodies having a high degree of specificity and a high binding affinity for the target antigen are isolated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter the desired hybridoma cells are identified, the clones can be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods. Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium and RPMI-1640 medium. Alternatively, the hybridoma cells can be grown in vivo as ascites in a mammal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones can be isolated or purified from the culture medium or ascites fluid by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as, for example, protein A-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, or affinity chromatography.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe monoclonal antibodies can also be made by recombinant DNA methods, such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567. DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies). The hybridoma cells of the invention serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA can be placed into expression vectors, which are then transfected into host cells such as simian COS cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein, to obtain the synthesis of monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells. The DNA also can be modified, for example, by substituting the coding sequence for human heavy and light chain constant domains in place of the homologous murine sequences (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; Morrison, Nature 368, 812-13 (1994)) or by covalently joining to the immunoglobulin coding sequence all or part of the coding sequence for a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide. Such a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide can be substituted for the constant domains of an antibody of the invention, or can be substituted for the variable domains of one antigen-combining site of an antibody of the invention to create a chimeric bivalent antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHumanized Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies directed against the protein antigens of the invention can further comprise humanized antibodies or human antibodies. These antibodies are suitable for administration to humans without engendering an immune response by the human against the administered immunoglobulin. Humanized forms of antibodies are chimeric immunoglobulins, immunoglobulin chains or fragments thereof (such as Fv, Fab, Fab′, F(ab′)\n2 \nor other antigen-binding subsequences of antibodies) that are principally comprised of the sequence of a human immunoglobulin, and contain minimal sequence derived from a non-human immunoglobulin. Humanization can be performed following the method of Winter and co-workers (Jones et al., Nature, 321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al., Nature, 332:323-327 (1988); Verhoeyen et al., Science, 239:1534-1536 (1988)), by substituting rodent CDRs or CDR sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. (See also U.S. Pat. No. 5,225,539.) In some instances, Fv framework residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Humanized antibodies can also comprise residues which are found neither in the recipient antibody nor in the imported CDR or framework sequences. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the framework regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. The humanized antibody optimally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin (Jones et al., 1986; Riechmann et al., 1988; and Presta, Curr. Op. Struct. Biol., 2:593-596 (1992)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHuman Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFully human antibodies relate to antibody molecules in which essentially the entire sequences of both the light chain and the heavy chain, including the CDRs, arise from human genes. Such antibodies are termed “human antibodies”, or “fully human antibodies” herein. Human monoclonal antibodies can be prepared by the trioma technique; the human B-cell hybridoma technique (see Kozbor, et al., 1983 Immunol Today 4: 72) and the EBV hybridoma technique to produce human monoclonal antibodies (see Cole, et al., 1985 In: M\nONOCLONAL \nA\nNTIBODIES AND \nC\nANCER \nT\nHERAPY\n, Alan R. Liss, Inc., pp. 77-96). Human monoclonal antibodies may be utilized in the practice of the present invention and may be produced by using human hybridomas (see Cote, et al., 1983. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 80: 2026-2030) or by transforming human B-cells with Epstein Barr Virus in vitro (see Cole, et al., 1985 In: M\nONOCLONAL \nA\nNTIBODIES AND \nC\nANCER \nT\nHERAPY\n, Alan R. Liss, Inc., pp. 77-96).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, human antibodies can also be produced using additional techniques, including phage display libraries (Hoogenboom and Winter, J. Mol. Biol., 227:381 (1991); Marks et al., J. Mol. Biol., 222:581 (1991)) Similarly, human antibodies can be made by introducing human immunoglobulin loci into transgenic animals, e.g., mice in which the endogenous immunoglobulin genes have been partially or completely inactivated. Upon challenge, human antibody production is observed, which closely resembles that seen in humans in all respects, including gene rearrangement, assembly, and antibody repertoire. This approach is described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,545,807; 5,545,806; 5,569,825; 5,625,126; 5,633,425; 5,661,016, and in Marks et al. (Bio/\nTechnology\n 10, 779-783 (1992)); Lonberg et al. (Nature 368 856-859 (1994)); Morrison (Nature 368, 812-13 (1994)); Fishwild et al, (Nature Biotechnology 14, 845-51 (1996)); Neuberger (Nature Biotechnology 14, 826 (1996)); and Lonberg and Huszar (Intern. Rev. Immunol. 13 65-93 (1995)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHuman antibodies may additionally be produced using transgenic nonhuman animals which are modified so as to produce fully human antibodies rather than the animal's endogenous antibodies in response to challenge by an antigen. (See PCT publication WO94/02602). The endogenous genes encoding the heavy and light immunoglobulin chains in the nonhuman host have been incapacitated, and active loci encoding human heavy and light chain immunoglobulins are inserted into the host's genome. The human genes are incorporated, for example, using yeast artificial chromosomes containing the requisite human DNA segments. An animal which provides all the desired modifications is then obtained as progeny by crossbreeding intermediate transgenic animals containing fewer than the full complement of the modifications. The preferred embodiment of such a nonhuman animal is a mouse, and is termed the Xenomouse™ as disclosed in PCT publications WO 96/33735 and WO 96/34096. This animal produces B cells which secrete fully human immunoglobulins. The antibodies can be obtained directly from the animal after immunization with an immunogen of interest, as, for example, a preparation of a polyclonal antibody, or alternatively from immortalized B cells derived from the animal, such as hybridomas producing monoclonal antibodies. Additionally, the genes encoding the immunoglobulins with human variable regions can be recovered and expressed to obtain the antibodies directly, or can be further modified to obtain analogs of antibodies such as, for example, single chain Fv molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn example of a method of producing a nonhuman host, exemplified as a mouse, lacking expression of an endogenous immunoglobulin heavy chain is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,939,598. It can be obtained by a method including deleting the J segment genes from at least one endogenous heavy chain locus in an embryonic stem cell to prevent rearrangement of the locus and to prevent formation of a transcript of a rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain locus, the deletion being effected by a targeting vector containing a gene encoding a selectable marker; and producing from the embryonic stem cell a transgenic mouse whose somatic and germ cells contain the gene encoding the selectable marker.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA method for producing an antibody of interest, such as a human antibody, is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,916,771. It includes introducing an expression vector that contains a nucleotide sequence encoding a heavy chain into one mammalian host cell in culture, introducing an expression vector containing a nucleotide sequence encoding a light chain into another mammalian host cell, and fusing the two cells to form a hybrid cell. The hybrid cell expresses an antibody containing the heavy chain and the light chain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further improvement on this procedure, a method for identifying a clinically relevant epitope on an immunogen, and a correlative method for selecting an antibody that binds immunospecifically to the relevant epitope with high affinity, are disclosed in PCT publication WO 99/53049.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nF\nab \nFragments and Single Chain Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to the invention, techniques can be adapted for the production of single-chain antibodies specific to an antigenic protein of the invention (see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,778). In addition, methods can be adapted for the construction of F\nab \nexpression libraries (see e.g., Huse, et al., 1989 Science 246: 1275-1281) to allow rapid and effective identification of monoclonal F\nab \nfragments with the desired specificity for a protein or derivatives, fragments, analogs or homologs thereof. Antibody fragments that contain the idiotypes to a protein antigen may be produced by techniques known in the art including, but not limited to: (i) an F\n(ab′)2 \nfragment produced by pepsin digestion of an antibody molecule; (ii) an F\nab \nfragment generated by reducing the disulfide bridges of an F\n(ab′)2 \nfragment; (iii) an F\nab \nfragment generated by the treatment of the antibody molecule with papain and a reducing agent and (iv) F\nv \nfragments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBispecific Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBispecific antibodies are monoclonal, preferably human or humanized, antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different antigens. In the present case, one of the binding specificities is for an antigenic protein of the invention. The second binding target is any other antigen, and advantageously is a cell-surface protein or receptor or receptor subunit.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditionally, the recombinant production of bispecific antibodies is based on the co-expression of two immunoglobulin heavy-chain/light-chain pairs, where the two heavy chains have different specificities (Milstein and Cuello, Nature, 305:537-539 (1983)). Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, these hybridomas (quadromas) produce a potential mixture of ten different antibody molecules, of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. The purification of the correct molecule is usually accomplished by affinity chromatography steps. Similar procedures are disclosed in WO 93/08829, published 13 May 1993, and in Traunecker et al., 1991 \nEMBO J., \n10:3655-3659.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities (antibody-antigen combining sites) can be fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. The fusion preferably is with an immunoglobulin heavy-chain constant domain, comprising at least part of the hinge, CH2, and CH3 regions. It is preferred to have the first heavy-chain constant region (CH1) containing the site necessary for light-chain binding present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy-chain fusions and, if desired, the immunoglobulin light chain, are inserted into separate expression vectors, and are co-transfected into a suitable host organism. For further details of generating bispecific antibodies see, for example, Suresh et al., Methods in Enzymology, 121:210 (1986).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to another approach described in WO 96/27011, the interface between a pair of antibody molecules can be engineered to maximize the percentage of heterodimers which are recovered from recombinant cell culture. The preferred interface comprises at least a part of the CH3 region of an antibody constant domain. In this method, one or more small amino acid side chains from the interface of the first antibody molecule are replaced with larger side chains (e.g. tyrosine or tryptophan). Compensatory “cavities” of identical or similar size to the large side chain(s) are created on the interface of the second antibody molecule by replacing large amino acid side chains with smaller ones (e.g. alanine or threonine). This provides a mechanism for increasing the yield of the heterodimer over other unwanted end-products such as homodimers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBispecific antibodies can be prepared as full-length antibodies or antibody fragments (e.g. F(ab′)\n2 \nbispecific antibodies). Techniques for generating bispecific antibodies from antibody fragments have been described in the literature. For example, bispecific antibodies can be prepared using chemical linkage. Brennan et al., Science 229:81 (1985) describe a procedure wherein intact antibodies are proteolytically cleaved to generate F(ab′)\n2 \nfragments. These fragments are reduced in the presence of the dithiol complexing agent sodium arsenite to stabilize vicinal dithiols and prevent intermolecular disulfide formation. The Fab′ fragments generated are then converted to thionitrobenzoate (TNB) derivatives. One of the Fab′-TNB derivatives is then reconverted to the Fab′-thiol by reduction with mercaptoethylamine and is mixed with an equimolar amount of the other Fab′-TNB derivative to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibodies produced can be used as agents for the selective immobilization of enzymes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, Fab′ fragments can be directly recovered from \nE. coli \nand chemically coupled to form bispecific antibodies. Shalaby et al., J. Exp. Med. 175:217-225 (1992) describe the production of a fully humanized bispecific antibody F(ab′)\n2 \nmolecule. Each Fab′ fragment was separately secreted from \nE. coli \nand subjected to directed chemical coupling in vitro to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibody thus formed was able to bind to cells overexpressing the ErbB2 receptor and normal human T cells, as well as trigger the lytic activity of human cytotoxic lymphocytes against human breast tumor targets.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious techniques for making and isolating bispecific antibody fragments directly from recombinant cell culture have also been described. For example, bispecific antibodies have been produced using leucine zippers. Kostelny et al., J. Immunol. 148(5):1547-1553 (1992). The leucine zipper peptides from the Fos and Jun proteins were linked to the Fab′ portions of two different antibodies by gene fusion. The antibody homodimers were reduced at the hinge region to form monomers and then re-oxidized to form the antibody heterodimers. This method can also be utilized for the production of antibody homodimers. The “diabody” technology described by Hollinger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:6444-6448 (1993) has provided an alternative mechanism for making bispecific antibody fragments. The fragments comprise a heavy-chain variable domain (V\nH\n) connected to a light-chain variable domain (V\nL\n) by a linker which is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain. Accordingly, the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains of one fragment are forced to pair with the complementary V\nL \nand V\nH \ndomains of another fragment, thereby forming two antigen-binding sites. Another strategy for making bispecific antibody fragments by the use of single-chain Fv (sFv) dimers has also been reported. See, Gruber et al., J. Immunol. 152:5368 (1994).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies with more than two valencies are contemplated. For example, trispecific antibodies can be prepared. Tutt et al., J. Immunol. 147:60 (1991).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary bispecific antibodies can bind to two different epitopes, at least one of which originates in the protein antigen of the invention. Alternatively, an anti-antigenic arm of an immunoglobulin molecule can be combined with an arm which binds to a triggering molecule on a leukocyte such as a T-cell receptor molecule (e.g. CD2, CD3, CD28, or B7), or Fc receptors for IgG (FcγR), such as FcγRI (CD64), FcγRII (CD32) and FcγRIII (CD16) so as to focus cellular defense mechanisms to the cell expressing the particular antigen. Bispecific antibodies can also be used to direct cytotoxic agents to cells which express a particular antigen. These antibodies possess an antigen-binding arm and an arm which binds a cytotoxic agent or a radionuclide chelator, such as EOTUBE, DPTA, DOTA, or TETA. Another bispecific antibody of interest binds the protein antigen described herein (BID or BID α6).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHeteroconjugate Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHeteroconjugate antibodies are also within the scope of the present invention. Heteroconjugate antibodies are composed of two covalently joined antibodies. Such antibodies have, for example, been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells (U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980), and for treatment of HIV infection (WO 91/00360; WO 92/200373; EP 03089). It is contemplated that the antibodies can be prepared in vitro using known methods in synthetic protein chemistry, including those involving crosslinking agents. For example, immunotoxins can be constructed using a disulfide exchange reaction or by forming a thioether bond. Examples of suitable reagents for this purpose include iminothiolate and methyl-4-mercaptobutyrimidate and those disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEffector Function Engineering\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt can be desirable to modify the antibody of the invention with respect to effector function, so as to enhance, e.g., the effectiveness of the antibody in treating cancer. For example, cysteine residue(s) can be introduced into the Fc region, thereby allowing interchain disulfide bond formation in this region. The homodimeric antibody thus generated can have improved internalization capability and/or increased complement-mediated cell killing and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). See Caron et al., J. Exp Med., 176: 1191-1195 (1992) and Shopes, J. Immunol., 148: 2918-2922 (1992). Homodimeric antibodies with enhanced anti-tumor activity can also be prepared using heterobifunctional cross-linkers as described in Wolff et al. Cancer Research, 53: 2560-2565 (1993). Alternatively, an antibody can be engineered that has dual Fc regions and can thereby have enhanced complement lysis and ADCC capabilities. See Stevenson et al., Anti-Cancer Drug Design, 3: 219-230 (1989).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmunoconjugates\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also pertains to immunoconjugates comprising an antibody conjugated to a cytotoxic agent such as a chemotherapeutic agent, toxin (e.g., an enzymatically active toxin of bacterial, fungal, plant, or animal origin, or fragments thereof), or a radioactive isotope (i.e., a radioconjugate).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChemotherapeutic agents useful in the generation of such immunoconjugates have been described above. Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof that can be used include diphtheria A chain, nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin, exotoxin A chain (from \nPseudomonas aeruginosa\n), ricin A chain, abrin A chain, modeccin A chain, alpha-sarcin, \nAleurites fordii \nproteins, dianthin proteins, \nPhytolaca americana \nproteins (PAPI, PAPII, and PAP-S), momordica charantia inhibitor, curcin, crotin, sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor, gelonin, mitogellin, restrictocin, phenomycin, enomycin, and the tricothecenes. A variety of radionuclides are available for the production of radioconjugated antibodies. Examples include \n212\nBi, \n131\nI, \n131\nIn, \n90\nY, and \n186\nRe.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConjugates of the antibody and cytotoxic agent are made using a variety of bifunctional protein-coupling agents such as N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithiol) propionate (SPDP), iminothiolane (IT), bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters (such as dimethyl adipimidate HCL), active esters (such as disuccinimidyl suberate), aldehydes (such as glutareldehyde), bis-azido compounds (such as bis (p-azidobenzoyl) hexanediamine), bis-diazonium derivatives (such as bis-(p-diazoniumbenzoyl)-ethylenediamine), diisocyanates (such as \ntolyene\n 2,6-diisocyanate), and bis-active fluorine compounds (such as 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene). For example, a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al., Science, 238: 1098 (1987). Carbon-14-labeled 1-isothiocyanatobenzyl-3-methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid (MX-DTPA) is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See WO94/11026.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the antibody can be conjugated to a “receptor” (such streptavidin) for utilization in tumor pretargeting wherein the antibody-receptor conjugate is administered to the patient, followed by removal of unbound conjugate from the circulation using a clearing agent and then administration of a “ligand” (e.g., avidin) that is in turn conjugated to a cytotoxic agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods of Modulating Apoptosis\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso included in the invention are methods of inducing apoptosis or sensitizing a cell to apoptosis. By “inducing apoptosis” is meant that that the program cell death is initiated. Apoptosis is measured by methods known in the art, for example apoptosis is measured by annexin V staining.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect apoptosis is induced in subject in need thereof by administering a BH3 peptide or BH3 chimeric peptide in an amount sufficient to induce apoptosis. The subject can be e.g., any mammal, e.g., a human, a primate, mouse, rat, dog, cat, cow, horse, pig. In various aspects the subject is susceptible to cancer or an autoimmune disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA BH3 peptide or BH3 chimeric peptide is administered with an anti-angiogenic compound. Examples of an anti-angiogenic compound include, but are not limited to, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, an epidermal-derived growth factor inhibitor, a fibroblast-derived growth factor inhibitor, a platelet-derived growth factor inhibitor, a matrix metalloprotease (MMP) inhibitor, an integrin blocker, interferon alpha, interferon-\ninducible protein\n 10, interleukin-12, pentosan polysulfate, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID), a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, carboxyamidotriazole, tetrahydrocortizol, combretastatin A-4, squalamine, 6-O-chloroacetyl-carbonyl)-fumagillol, thalidomide, angiostatin, endostatin, troponin-1, an antibody to VEGF, \nplatelet factor\n 4 or thrombospondin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe BH3 peptide or BH3 chimeric peptide is further administered with an chemotherapeutic compound. Examples of chemotherapeutic compounds include, but are not limited to, paclitaxel, Taxol, lovastatin, minosine, tamoxifen, gemcitabine, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), methotrexate (MTX), docetaxel, vincristin, vinblastin, nocodazole, teniposide, etoposide, adriamycin, epothilone, navelbine, camptothecin, daunonibicin, dactinomycin, mitoxantrone, amsacrine, epirubicin or idarubicin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the BH3 peptide or BH3 chimeric peptide is further administered with an antibody, such as polyclonal, monoclonal, humanized, human, bispecific, heteroconjugate, immunoconjugate, chimeric, single chain, F\nab\n, F\nab′\n and F\n(ab′)2 \nfragments, and an F\nab \nexpression library as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, apoptosis is induced in a cell by contacting a cell with a BH3 peptide or BH3 chimeric peptide in an amount sufficient to induce apoptosis. Alternatively, a cell is sensitized to apoptosis by contacting a cell with a BH3 peptide or BH3 chimeric peptide in an amount sufficient to sensitize the cell to apoptosis. The cell population that is exposed to, i.e., contacted with, the BH3 peptide or BH3 chimeric peptide can be any number of cells, i.e., one or more cells, and can be provided in vitro, in vivo, or ex vivo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome disease conditions are related to the development of a defective down-regulation of apoptosis in the affected cells. For example, neoplasias result, at least in part, from an apoptosis-resistant state in which cell proliferation signals inappropriately exceed cell death signals. Furthermore, some DNA viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus, African swine fever virus and adenovirus, parasitize the host cellular machinery to drive their own replication. At the same time, they modulate apoptosis to repress cell death and allow the target cell to reproduce the virus. Moreover, certain disease conditions such as lymphoproliferative conditions, cancer including drug resistant cancer, arthritis, inflammation, autoimmune diseases and the like may result from a down regulation of cell death regulation. In such disease conditions, it would be desirable to promote apoptotic mechanisms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods of Screening for Apoptotic Modulating Compounds\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention further provides a method of screening for compound that modulate apoptosis, i.e., activators or sensitizers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn various methods, a apoptotic sensitizer compound is identified by contacting a mitochondrion overexpressing an anti-apoptotic protein, e.g. BCL-2 or BCL-X\nL \nwith a BID-like BH3 peptide to form a protein-peptide complex. The complex is contacted with a candidate compound, and cytochrome c release is determined and compared to the amount of cytochrome c release in the test population to a control population that has or has not been exposed to the compound An increase in cytochrome c release presence of the compound as compared to the absence of the compound indicates the compound is an apoptotic sensitizer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also includes an apoptosis sensitizer identified according to this screening method, and a pharmaceutical composition which includes the apoptosis modulator.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds, e.g., BH3 peptides BH3 chimeric peptides, nucleic acids encoding BH3 peptides, and BH3 and BH3 antibodies (also referred to herein as “active compounds”) of the invention, and derivatives, fragments, analogs and homologs thereof, can be incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions suitable for administration. Such compositions typically comprise the nucleic acid molecule, or protein, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used herein, “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” is intended to include any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like, compatible with pharmaceutical administration. Suitable carriers are described in the most recent edition of Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, a standard reference text in the field, which is incorporated herein by reference. Preferred examples of such carriers or diluents include, but are not limited to, water, saline, finger's solutions, dextrose solution, and 5% human serum albumin. Liposomes and non-aqueous vehicles such as fixed oils may also be used. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active compound, use thereof in the compositions is contemplated. Supplementary active compounds can also be incorporated into the compositions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA pharmaceutical composition of the invention is formulated to be compatible with its intended route of administration. Examples of routes of administration include parenteral, e.g., intravenous, intradermal, subcutaneous, oral (e.g., inhalation), transdermal (topical), transmucosal, and rectal administration. Solutions or suspensions used for parenteral, intradermal, or subcutaneous application can include the following components: a sterile diluent such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils, polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents; antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; buffers such as acetates, citrates or phosphates, and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. The pH can be adjusted with acids or bases, such as hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. The parenteral preparation can be enclosed in ampoules, disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. For intravenous administration, suitable carriers include physiological saline, bacteriostatic water, Cremophor EL™ (BASF, Parsippany, N.J.) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In all cases, the composition must be sterile and should be fluid to the extent that easy syringeability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as manitol, sorbitol, sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which delays absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound (e.g., a BH3 peptide or BH3 peptide encoding nucleic acid) in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle that contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying that yields a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOral compositions generally include an inert diluent or an edible carrier. They can be enclosed in gelatin capsules or compressed into tablets. For the purpose of oral therapeutic administration, the active compound can be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of tablets, troches, or capsules. Oral compositions can also be prepared using a fluid carrier for use as a mouthwash, wherein the compound in the fluid carrier is applied orally and swished and expectorated or swallowed. Pharmaceutically compatible binding agents, and/or adjuvant materials can be included as part of the composition. The tablets, pills, capsules, troches and the like can contain any of the following ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature: a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatin; an excipient such as starch or lactose, a disintegrating agent such as alginic acid, Primogel, or corn starch; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate or Sterotes; a glidant such as colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening agent such as sucrose or saccharin; or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl salicylate, or orange flavoring.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor administration by inhalation, the compounds are delivered in the form of an aerosol spray from pressured container or dispenser which contains a suitable propellant, e.g., a gas such as carbon dioxide, or a nebulizer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSystemic administration can also be by transmucosal or transdermal means. For transmucosal or transdermal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art, and include, for example, for transmucosal administration, detergents, bile salts, and fusidic acid derivatives. Transmucosal administration can be accomplished through the use of nasal sprays or suppositories. For transdermal administration, the active compounds are formulated into ointments, salves, gels, or creams as generally known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds can also be prepared in the form of suppositories (e.g., with conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter and other glycerides) or retention enemas for rectal delivery.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the active compounds are prepared with carriers that will protect the compound against rapid elimination from the body, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Methods for preparation of such formulations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The materials can also be obtained commercially from Alza Corporation and Nova Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Liposomal suspensions (including liposomes targeted to infected cells with monoclonal antibodies to viral antigens) can also be used as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These can be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,522,811, incorporated fully herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is especially advantageous to formulate oral or parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subject to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on the unique characteristics of the active compound and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions can be included in a container, pack, or dispenser together with instructions for administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTransgenic Animals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the present invention includes transgenic animals having a heterologous (or exogenous) gene construct or transgene encoding a BCL-2 polypeptide. (e.g., the tet-BCL-2 allele)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe preparation of a transgenic mammal includes introducing a nucleic acid construct that expresses a nucleic acid encoding a BCL-2 polypeptide into an undifferentiated cell type, e.g., an embryonic stem (ES) cell. The ES cell is injected into a mammalian embryo, where it integrates into the developing embryo. The embryo is implanted into a foster mother for the duration of gestation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEmbryonic stem cells are typically selected for their ability to integrate into and become part of the germ line of a developing embryo so as to create germ line transmission of the heterologous gene construct. Thus, any ES cell line that has this capability is suitable for use herein. One mouse strain that is typically used for production of ES cells is the 129J strain. A preferred ES cell line is murine cell line D3 (American Type Culture Collection catalog no. CRL 1934). More preferably, the cell line is RW4. The cells are cultured and prepared for DNA insertion using methods well known in the art, such as those set forth by Robertson (Robertson, In: \nTeratocarcinomas and Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach\n, E. J. Robertson, ed., IRL Press, Washington, D.C., 1987). Insertion of the nucleic acid construct into the ES cells can be accomplished using a variety of methods well known in the art including for example, electroporation, microinjection, and calcium phosphate treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “transgene” is used herein to describe genetic material that has been or is about to be artificially inserted into the genome of a mammalian cell, particularly a mammalian cell of a living animal. The transgene is used to transform a cell, meaning that a permanent or transient genetic change, preferably a permanent genetic change, is induced in a cell following incorporation of an heterologous nucleic acid, such as DNA. A permanent genetic change is generally achieved by introduction of the DNA into the genome of the cell. Vectors for stable integration include plasmids, retroviruses and other animal viruses, YACs, and the like. Of interest are transgenic mammals, e.g. cows, pigs, goats, horses, etc., and particularly rodents, e.g., rats, mice, etc. Preferably, the transgenic animals are mice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTransgenic animals comprise an heterologous nucleic acid sequence present as an extrachromosomal element or stably integrated in all or a portion of its cells, especially in germ cells. Unless otherwise indicated, it will be assumed that a transgenic animal comprises stable changes to the germline sequence. During the initial construction of the animal, “chimeras” or “chimeric animals” are generated, in which only a subset of cells have the altered genome. Chimeras are primarily used for breeding purposes in order to generate the desired transgenic animal. Animals having a heterozygous alteration are generated by breeding of chimeras. Male and female heterozygotes are typically bred to generate homozygous animals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe heterologous gene is usually either from a different species than the animal host, or is otherwise altered in its coding or non-coding sequence. The introduced gene may be a wild-type gene, naturally occurring polymorphism, or a genetically manipulated sequence, for example having deletions, substitutions or insertions in the coding or non-coding regions. Where the introduced gene is a coding sequence, it is usually operably linked to a promoter, which may be constitutive or inducible, and other regulatory sequences required for expression in the host animal. By “operably linked” is meant that a DNA sequence and a regulatory sequence(s) are connected in such a way as to permit gene expression when the appropriate molecules, e.g., transcriptional activator proteins, are bound to the regulatory sequence(s). The transgenic animals of the invention can comprise other genetic alterations in addition to the presence of the heterologous gene. For example, the host's genome may be altered to affect the function of endogenous genes comprising BH-3 domains (e.g., endogenous BID, BIM, BAD, BIK, NOXA and/or BCLX genes), contain marker genes, or other genetic alterations. Construction of a BCL-2 transgenic mouse is illustrated in \nFIG. 10\n where 16 chimeras were bred to B6 mice to produce 45 positive F1 offspring.\n\n\n \nKnockouts and Knockins\n\n\n \n \n \nAlthough not necessary to the operability of the invention, the transgenic animals described herein may comprise alterations to endogenous genes comprising BCL-2 in addition to the genetic alterations described above. For example, the host animals may be either “knockouts” and/or “knockins” for a target gene(s) as is consistent with the goals of the invention (e.g., the host animal's endogenous BCL-2 gene may be “knocked out” and/or the BCL-2 gene may be “knocked in”). Knockouts have a partial or complete loss of function in one or both alleles of an endogenous gene comprising BCL-2 genes of interest. Knockins have an introduced transgene with altered genetic sequence and/or function from the endogenous BCL-2 gene. The two may be combined, for example, such that the naturally occurring gene is disabled, and an altered form introduced. For example, it may be desirable to knockout the host animal's endogenous gene comprising BCL-2, while introducing an exogenous gene comprising BCL-2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a knockout, preferably the target gene expression is undetectable or insignificant. For example, a knock-out of a gene comprising BCL-2 means that function of the BCL-2 gene has been substantially decreased so that expression is not detectable or only present at insignificant levels. This may be achieved by a variety of mechanisms, including introduction of a disruption of the coding sequence, e.g., insertion of one or more stop codons, insertion of a DNA fragment, etc., deletion of coding sequence, substitution of stop codons for coding sequence, etc. In some cases the exogenous transgene sequences are ultimately deleted from the genome, leaving a net change to the native sequence. Different approaches may be used to achieve the “knock-out”. A chromosomal deletion of all or part of the native gene may be induced, including deletions of the non-coding regions, particularly the promoter region, 3′ regulatory sequences, enhancers, or deletions of gene that activate expression of BCL-2 genes. A functional knock-out may also be achieved by the introduction of an anti-sense construct that blocks expression of the native genes (See, e.g., Li and Cohen (1996) \nCell \n85:319-329). “Knock-outs” also include conditional knock-outs, for example where alteration of the target gene occurs upon exposure of the animal to a substance that promotes target gene alteration, introduction of an enzyme that promotes recombination at the target gene site (e.g. Cre in the Cre-lox system), or other method for directing the target gene alteration post-natally.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “knockin” of a target gene means an alteration in a host cell genome that results in altered expression or function of a native target gene. Increased (including ectopic) or decreased expression may be achieved by introduction of an additional copy of the target gene, or by operatively inserting a regulatory sequence that provides for enhanced expression of an endogenous copy of the target gene. These changes may be constitutive or conditional, i.e. dependent on the presence of an activator or represser. The use of knockin technology may be combined with production of exogenous sequences to produce the transgenic animals of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe heterologous gene construct includes a nucleic acid encoding a protein comprising BCL-2 proteins. The heterologous gene construct can also encode for various selection markers and enhancer elements.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA selection marker can be any nucleic acid sequence that is detectable and/or assayable. Examples of selection markers include positive selection markers and negative selection markers. Positive selection markers include drug resistance genes; e.g., neomycin resistance genes or hygromycin resistance genes, or beta-galactosidase genes. Negative selection markers, e.g., thymidine kinase gene, diphtheria toxin gene and ganciclovir are useful in the heterologous gene construct in order to eliminate embryonic stem (ES) cells that do not undergo homologous recombination. The selection marker gene is usually operably linked to its own promoter or to another strong promoter from any source that will be active or can easily be activated in the cell into which it is inserted; however, the marker gene need not have its own promoter attached as it may be transcribed using the promoter of the BCL-2 containing gene to be suppressed. In addition, the marker gene will normally have a polyA sequence attached to the 3′ end of the gene; this sequence serves to terminate transcription of the gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Enhancer elements” include nucleic acid sequences that are bound by polypeptides associated with transcription, and are usually in cis with the nucleic acid encoding a light-generating fusion protein. Examples of enhancer elements include cyclic AMP response elements (CRE), serum response elements (SRE), nuclear factor B (NF-κB), activator protein 1 (AP-1), serum response factor (SRF), and p53 binding sites. These enhancer elements may further include a TATA box.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe heterologous gene construct may be constituitively expressed in the transgenic mammal. The gene construct may expressed in specific tissues, e.g., the construct is under the control of a tissue-specific promoter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention includes a transgenic mouse containing a heterologous gene construct encoding a BCL-2 protein. The gene construct is under the control of a conditional promoter Activation of the promoter by a transgenic trans-activator protein results in increased expression of the gene construct encoding the BCL-2 protein. Inactivation of the transactivator is achieved by the interaction of a selected biocompatible entity, or parts of the entity, with the transactivator elements. This results in a decrease in expression of the BCL-2 transgene. If the activation occurs only in a part of the animal, only cells in that part will express the BCL-2 proteins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTransgenic Cell Lines\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also includes cell lines derived from the transgenic animals described above. An example cell line is derived from the bone marrow of a triply transgenic (E-mu myc+/tet-Bcl-2+/MMTVtTA+) leukemic mouse. The cell line is dependent on IL-7 for division. When treated with doxycycline, which turns off BCL-2, all the cells die, demonstrating the BCL-2 dependence of the cell line. The invention also includes a method of using the cell line in an in vitro assay to determine the inhibition of BCL-2 by a peptide or peptidomimetic comprising a BH3 domain (i.e. BCL-2 inhibition) or determine the effects of a test compound (i.e. BH3 agonist).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention will be further described in the following examples, which do not limit the scope of the invention described in the claims.\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\nGeneral Methods\n\n\nPeptide Stocks\n\n\n \n \n \nPeptides were synthesized by Tufts University Core Facility, purified by HPLC, and identity confirmed by mass spectroscopy. Stock solutions were 10-20 mM DMSO.\n\n\n \nIsolation of Mitochondria\n\n\n \n \n \nMouse liver mitochondria were isolated from age-matched wt or Bak−/− mice. Livers were diced, subjected to Dounce rotary Teflon pestle disruption, then homogenized using a Kinematica Polytron homognizer. Following suspension in isolation buffer (250 mM sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 0.1 mM EGTA), mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation steps, followed by two washes in isolation buffer. Mitochondria from FL5.12 cells were isolated by cell disruption followed by differential centrifugation and washing as above. Cell disruption was performed either by a Kinematika Polytron homogenizer or by a combination of Dounce homogenization followed by 6-10 expulsions through a 27 gauge needle.\n\n\n \nCytochrome c Release\n\n\n \n \n \nMitochondria at a protein concentration of 0.5 mg/ml were treated at room temperature in experimental buffer (125 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-MOPS pH 7.4, 5 mM glutamate, 2.5 mM malate, 1 mM KPO\n4\n, 10 □M EGTA-Tris pH 7.4). Percent release was quantitated using a colorimetric ELISA (MCTC0, R&D Systems). In all experiments, treatments with DMSO were used as a control for solvent activity.\n\n\n \nBMH Cross-Linking\n\n\n \n \n \n1,6-Bismaleimidohexane was obtained from Pierce (#22330). A 10 mM stock solution in DMSO was added to treated mitochondrial suspensions at a 1:11 dilution. Cross-linking took place for 30 minutes at room temperature, followed by centrifugation to pellet mitochondria. Pellets were dissolved in NuPAGE loading buffer (Invitrogen).\n\n\n \nBinding Assays\n\n\n \n \n \nTo determine K\nd \nfor peptide binding to BCL-2, a GST-BCL-2 fusion protein lacking the C-terminal transmembrane domain was utilized. Peptides were synthesized with a fluorescein amino-terminus using an AHA linker. Peptides at 25 nM were mixed with titrations of GST-BCL-2 in binding buffer (140 mM NaCL, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4) at 37° C. An increase in fluorescence polarization measured on a Perkin-Elmer LS 50B luminescence spectrophotometer was quantitated to calculate binding. A non-linear fit to a sigmoidal dose-response curve utilized the program Origin 6.0 to determine K\nd\n. For quantitative BIDBH3 displacement assays, 25 nM fluoresceinated BIDBH3 was mixed with 1 μM GST-BCL-2 in binding buffer. Increasing amounts of unlabelled BH3 peptides were titrated in, with loss of fluorescence polarization as a measurement of displacement of BIDBH3. Data were fitted to a sigmoidal curve as above, and IC50 determined\n\n\n \nGST-BCL-2 Production\n\n\n \n \n \nGST-BCL-2δC21 fusion proteins were induced in BL21 DE3 by 0.1 mM IPTG. The bacterial pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (1 mg/ml lysozyme/1% Triton X-100/0.1 mg/ml PMSF/2 μg/ml aprotinin/2 μg/ml leupeptine/1 μg/ml pepstatin A in PBS) and sonicated. After centrifugation at 20,000×g for 20 min, the supernatant was applied to glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma). The beads were washed with PBS and treated with 50 mM glutathione/50 mM TrisHCl, pH8.0 to elute protein. Eluate was dialyzed against binding buffer and concentrated using Amicon centrifugal concentrating devices.\n\n\n \nCircular Dichroism\n\n\n \n \n \nCircular dichroism (CD) spectra were obtained on a Jasco J-710 spectropolarimeter at 20° C. using the following standard measurement parameters: wavelength, 190-260 nm; step resolution, 0.5 nm; speed, 20 nm/sec; accumulations, 10; response, 1 sec; band width, 1 nm; path length, 0.1 cm. Stock solutions of peptide were dissolved in deionized water and concentrations determined by amino acid analysis. Samples were then diluted in 50 mM \npotassium phosphate pH\n 7 to a calculated final concentration of 50 μM. The CD spectrum of each sample was measured in triplicate and a background spectrum of diluent alone was subtracted. For comparison, the subtracted CD spectra were normalized to 35 μM based on repeat peptide concentration determination by amino acid analysis of the diluted peptide solutions. The α-helical content of each peptide was calculated by dividing the mean residue ellipticity [q]222obs by the reported [q]222obs for a model helical decapeptide (Yang et al., 1986).\n\n\n \nImmunoblot Analysis\n\n\n \n \n \nAntibodies used for immunoblot analysis included anti-cytochrome c (75981A, Pharmingen), anti-BAK (Upstate Biotechnology), and anti-BAX (N-20, Santa Cruz). Antibody detection was accomplished using enhanced chemiluminescence (Western Lightning, Perkin-Elmer).\n\n\n \nJurkat Cell Death\n\n\n \n \n \nJurkat cells were grown in \nRPMI\n 1640, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 u/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml/strep, 2 mM glutamine, 50 μM β-mercaptoethanol. Cells were treated with peptide for 5 hours followed by staining with fluorescently-tagged Annexin V according to manufacturer's protocol (BD Biosciences 556547). Death was quantitated by FACS followed by analysis using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc.)\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\nBH3 Peptides from BID and BIM, but not all BH3-Only Members Release Cytochrome c Similar to Myristoylated BID\n\n\n \n \n \nRecombinant p15tBID and even more efficiently the p7/myrp15, myristoylated BID complex (myrBID), initiate BAK oligomerization and cytochrome c release in a mitochondrial in-vitro system that appears to recapitulate the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis in-vivo. Since the pro-apoptotic activity of BID in-vitro and in-vivo requires an intact BH3 domain, we tested the ability of peptides derived from this BH3 domain to initiate this activity. A 20 mer of BIDBH3 (aa 80-99) at 10 μM (Table 1) proved capable of initiating cytochrome c release, as did myrBID (\nFIG. 1A\n). the activity of other BH3 domain peptides were compared. While BIMBH3 (Table 1) demonstrated cytochrome c release, peptides derived from other BH3-only members BAD, BIK, and NOXA (Table 1) even at 100 μM did not display this activity (\nFIG. 1B\n). A peptide derived from the BH3 domain of anti-apoptotic Bcl-X\nL \ndid not cause cytochrome c release (\nFIG. 1B\n). Circular dichroism studies indicate that while the relative α-helical content of these peptides varies, the percent α-helicity does not solely dictate the activity of the peptides. While NOXAABH3 and BCL-X\nL\nBH3 have relatively low α-helical content, BADBH3 demonstrates the highest α-helical content and is still inactive in this assay (Table 1) Likewise, a peptide derived from the BH3 domain of BID, but containing substitutions (L90A, D95A) at two residues highly conserved throughout the family, retained α-helicity, but did not cause cytochrome c release (Table 1, \nFIG. 1B\n).\n\n\n \nExample 3\n\n\nBAK is Required for BH3 Peptide-Induced Cytochrome c Release\n\n\n \n \n \nTo test whether BH3 peptides work through an established mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis, we examined whether they required the “multidomain” member BAK to be present. One hallmark of cytochrome c release by native tBID is that it requires the presence of multidomain BAK or BAX in intact cells or BAK on purified mitochondria (Wei et al., 2000; Wei et al., 2001) Immunoblots of mitochondria isolated from the liver of Bak−/− mice confirmed that neither “multi-domain” pro-apoptotic BAX nor BAK was present (\nFIG. 2\n). Moreover, there is no compensatory alteration in the levels of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 members in the absence of BAX and/or BAK (not shown). Comparison of 100 μM BIMBH3 or BIDBH3 peptide on Bak+/+ vs. −/− mitochondria indicated that BAK is required for the release of cytochrome c (\nFIG. 3\n). This requirement for BAK argues that these α-helical BH3 peptides function through the genetic pathway of mitochondrial apoptosis rather than by an autonomous permeabilization of membranes which non-specifically damages mitochondria.\n\n\n \nExample 4\n\n\nPeptides that Induce Cytochrome c Release Induce BAK Oligomerization\n\n\n \n \n \nPrevious work demonstrated that the translocation of tBID to the mitochondrion results in allosteric conformational activation of BAK, which includes its homo-oligomerization followed by the release of cytochrome c (Wei et al., 2000). It was found that the BIDBH3 peptide (like tBID or the p7/myr15BID complex) induces BAK oligomerization as detected with the cross-linker, BMH (\nFIG. 4A\n). Moreover, there is temporal relationship between BAK oligomerization and the release of cytochrome c induced by BIDBH3 peptide (FIG. \n4\nA,B). While BIMBH3 also induces BAK oligomerization, BADBH3 peptide, which lacks the ability to cause cytochrome c release, is unable to induce BAK oligomerization (\nFIG. 4C\n). In was also found that BIMBH3 and BIDBH3, but not BADBH3, could also induce oligomerization of BAX in mitochondria isolated from cultured FL5.12 cells, which contain both BAX and BAK (\nFIG. 2\n, \n4\nC). Note that while BIDBH3 induces more prominent cross-linking of BAK than does BIMBH3, BIMBH3 induces more prominent cross-linking of BAX than does BIDBH3. A mutant BID peptide BIDBH3mut (L90A, D95A) was tested and it lacked the ability to induce either cytochrome c release (\nFIG. 1B\n) or BAX, BAK oligomerization (\nFIG. 4C\n). These results indicate that BIDBH3 and BIMBH3 peptides, like intact tBID protein are capable of inducing an allosteric change in mitochondrial-resident BAK or BAX, which includes their homo-oligomerization and subsequent release of cytochrome c.\n\n\n \nExample 5\n\n\nBCL-2 Inhibits Mitochondrial Release of Cytochrome c by BH3 Peptides\n\n\n \n \n \nMitochondria bearing protective levels of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 do not release cytochrome c following treatment with 25 ng tBID in vitro, apparently because tBID is bound and sequestered by BCL-2 in stable complexes that prevent tBID from activating BAK (Cheng et al., 2001) Similarly, mitochondria with overexpressed BCL-2 proved resistant to 10 μM BIDBH3, 1 μM BIMBH3, as well as 30 nM myrBID failing to release cytochrome c (\nFIG. 5A\n) Furthermore, the presence of BCL-2 is coordinate with the loss of BAK oligomerization following exposure to BH3 peptide, suggesting that BCL-2 inhibits upstream of BAK activation (\nFIG. 5B\n). These findings support a model wherein a major component of BCL-2's role in inactivating tBID is to specifically sequester the BH3 domain, thus preventing BH3 itself from activating multidomain pro-apoptotic members.\n\n\n \nExample 6\n\n\nBADBH3 Binds BCL-2 and Restores Cytochrome c Release by BID\n\n\n \n \n \nBH3 peptides were tested which lack the intrinsic ability to activate BAK and cause cytochrome c release for their capacity to interfere with the anti-apoptotic protection by BCL-2. This subset of BH3 peptides might occupy the hydrophobic pocket of BCL-2 and consequently displace proapoptotic BIDBH3 or BIMBH3 peptides. The BADBH3 peptide most prominently demonstrates the capacity to overcome BCL-2 protection of mitochondria treated with a subliminal concentration of myrBID (30 nM), while BIKBH3 shows significant, but lesser, potency (\nFIG. 6A\n). The remaining BH3 peptides derived from NOXA and BCL-X\nL \ndid not demonstrate the capacity to overcome BCL-2 protection (\nFIG. 6A\n). Since even 100 μM BADBH3 in and of itself cannot activate BAK or release cytochrome c, this suggests that BADBH3 sensitizes mitochondria to BIDBH3 or BIMBH3 by successfully competing with these peptides for binding to BCL-2. At 100 μM, BADBH3 was able to restore the cytochrome c release of BCL-2 overexpressing mitochondria in a dose-response fashion to BIDBH3 (\nFIG. 6B\n) and BIMBH3 (\nFIG. 6C\n) to levels observed for wt mitochondria. An increase in the sensitivity of wt mitochondria treated with BADBH3 was observed. This would be expected, as the source of wt mitochondria, FL5.12 cells, express some murine BCL-2. It was noted that the restoration of cytochrome c release by BADBH3 was accompanied by restoration of BAK oligomerization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhether eliminating BCL-2 protection by BADBH3 would enable the more physiologic ligand, myristoylated BID complex (p7/myrp15BID) was tested. Addition of 200 μM BADBH3 to BCL-2 overexpressing mitochondria markedly restores their sensitivity to even 1 nM myrBID. These BADBH3 treated mitochondria are more sensitive than wt mitochondria, probably reflecting the capacity of BADBH3 to inhibit the endogenous murine BCL-2 and BCL-X\nL \nresident on the mitochondria (\nFIG. 6D\n). The dose response range of BADBH3 was examined, revealing it had measurable activity at concentrations as low as 1 μM in inhibiting BCL-2 (\nFIG. 6E\n) and enabling cytochrome c release by myrBID. At 100 μM, BIKBH3 can also restore near-total cytochrome c release to mitochondria over-expressing BCL-2, demonstrating a mechanism of action like BADBH3, albeit at higher concentrations (\nFIG. 6E\n). This reveals that short BADBH3 and BIKBH3 peptides can effectively compete with the natural myrBID protein for binding BCL-2 thus abrogating BCL-2's antiapoptotic effect and enabling myrBID induced cytochrome c release.\n\n\n \nExample 7\n\n\nBADBH3 Displaces BIDBH3 from BCL-2 by Fluorescence Polarization Analysis\n\n\n \n \n \nTo directly test whether BADBH3 could displace BIDBH3 from BCL-2 we utilized fluorescence polarization analysis. BADBH3 peptide bound full-length BCL-2 with approximately 5-fold greater affinity than BIDBH3 peptide (average of 41 vs. 220 nM, Table 1, \nFIG. 7A\n). Moreover, BADBH3 can efficiently displace pre-bound BIDBH3 peptide from BCL-2 (\nFIG. 7B\n). However, to compete pre-bound BIDBH3, an excess of BADBH3 is required, despite the 5-fold greater affinity of BADBH3 for BCL-2 in solution. This finding suggests a conformational change takes place in either BCL-2 and/or a BH3 peptide upon binding. In contrast, BIDBH3 does not effectively displace BADBH3 from BCL-2. Testing the remaining peptides reveals that those peptides which cause cytochrome c release by themselves (BIDBH3 and BIMBH3) or those which enable cytochrome c release by counteracting BCL-2 (BADBH3 and BIKBH3) all bind to BCL-2 with affinities in the 50-500 nM range. BADBH3 and BIKBH3 demonstrate the ability to displace BIDBH3 from the BCL-2 protein (Table 1). The remaining peptides (NOXABH3, NOXABBH3, BCLXBH3, BIDBH3mut) which were unable to overcome BCL-2 inhibition did not bind detectably to BCL-2 or displace BIDBH3 from BCL-2 (Table 1). These results are consistent with the capacity of “sensitizing” BH3 domains (e.g. BADBH3 or BIKBH3) to displace “activating” BH3 domains (e.g. BIDBH3 or BIMBH3) from the pocket of anti-apoptotic BCL-2. Once free, “activating” BH3 domains by this model would trigger BAK oligomerization with subsequent cytochrome c release (\nFIG. 7C\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhether apoptosis of cancer cells could be triggered by transduction of such BH3 peptides was explored. Prior studies utilizing internalization moieties including decanoic acid, antennepedia (ANT) or HIV Tat have noted confounding issues of cellular and mitochondrial toxicity. For example, when various BH3 domains were linked to a Tat 11-mer both wt and mutant transduced peptides rapidly killed cells. Moreover, many conjugates did not appear to work through the genetic pathway as they displayed no inhibition by BCL-2 and readily killed Bax, Bak doubly deficient cells (not shown) Linking a polyarginine (8 aa) stretch to the BH3 peptides appears more promising. Polyarginine tags have been shown to facilitate the transport of peptides across the plasma membrane (Rothbard et al., 2000). r8BIDBH3 was capable of killing Jurkat leukemic cells, whereas r8BIDBH3mut was ineffective. Moreover, the addition of non-toxic 10YM r8BADBH3 was able to sensitize Jurkat cells to subliminal concentrations (10 μM) of r8BIDBH3 (\nFIG. 8\n). Both r8BIDBH3 and r8BADBH3 failed to kill Bax, Bak doubly-deficient cells. Thus, this appears to provide an initial proof of concept experiment that “sensitizing” and “activating” BH3 domains will also synergize in vivo to initiate apoptosis of cancer cells.\n\n\n \nExample 8\n\n\n \n \n \nThe use of synthetic peptides coupled with genetically defined mitochondria indicate that the BH3 peptide domain itself, excised from the context of an entire BH3-only molecule, can function as a specific death ligand. The activity of BH3 peptides supports a ligand/receptor model in which “BID-like” BH3 domains are sufficient to trigger allosteric conformational activation of BAX, BAK, their respective receptors. Activation by BIDBH3 peptide was qualitatively indistinguishable from the myrBID protein in that either requires BAK, results in BAK oligomerization followed by cytochrome c release, and can be bound and sequestered by BCL-2 with resultant protection of BAK. The synthetic peptides also indicate that BH3 regions are true domains rather than merely conserved sequence motifs, as the peptide domain itself has inherent functional activity. Comparison of various α-helical peptides from BH3-only proteins reveals evidence for 2 functional classes of BH3 domains. BID-like domains “activate” multidomain proapoptotic BAX, BAK. Whereas, BAD-like domains “sensitize” mitochondria for apoptosis by occupying the pocket of anti-apoptotic BCL-2. The latter displace BID-like domains which even at subliminal levels can now initiate cytochrome c release. This predicts that therapeutics which mimic a BH3 domain, whether they be peptidomimetics or small molecules, will be assignable to these functional classes and should be classified utilizing the genetic and molecular reagents defined here.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFrom a therapeutic vantage point, BAD-like “sensitizing” BH3 mimetics would possess several attractive characteristics. They might be predicted to reset susceptibility of cells protected by BCL-2 or BCLX\nL\n, but would require a second apoptotic signal to initiate an “activating” BH3-only protein. This implies that as a single agent, “sensitizing” mimetics might prove non-toxic, especially to normal cells. The need for a second signal provides the opportunity to utilize cancer cell selective pathways that could also spare normal cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEvidence here for a “sensitizing” subset of BAD-like BH3 peptides provides an explanation for previous, apparent discrepancies concerning the mechanism of action of these proteins. Most BH3-only intact proteins including BAD, NOXA and BIK display a marked binding preference for anti-apoptotic members BCL-2, BCL-X\nL \nin interaction assays of yeast two-hybrid, pull down, or co-immunoprecipitation from detergent solubilized lysates (Boyd et al., 1995; Oda et al., 2000; Yang et al., 1995). Moreover, mutational analysis suggested that only when BAD was able to bind anti-apoptotic BCL-X\nL \nwas it capable of promoting death (Kelekar and Thompson, 1998). Yet, BAD, NOXA and BIK all require the multidomain proapoptotic BAX, BAK proteins to kill as evidenced in Bax, Bak-doubly deficient cells (Cheng et al., 2001; Zong et al., 2001). The ability of BAD-like BH3 peptides to mediate a displacement reaction from the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 pocket provides a mechanism of action that would accommodate all observations. The cooperating protein displaced from anti-apoptotic pockets within intact cells would include, but not be restricted to, BID-like “activating” BH3-only members. While helping to resolve this issue, the analysis of the BIMBH3 peptide proved provocative. Prior interaction assays indicate that the intact BIM protein displays preferential binding to anti-apoptotic BCL-2, BCL-X\nL \nover proapoptotic BAX or BAK. Previous reports testing the capacity of intact BIM protein to release cytochrome c from mitochondria gave differing results (Li et al., 2001; Terradillos et al., 2002). Here, the isolated BIM BH3 domain when removed from the context of the entire protein scored as BID-like, capable of activating BAX, BAK. Several potential explanations can be envisioned. It is possible that the critical α-helical face of the BH3 domain that recognizes BAX, BAK may not be exposed in the intact BIM protein. Alternatively, it is also conceivable that the standard protein interaction assays used to measure binding may not reflect all of the conformational states that a native BIM molecule undergoes during cell death in-vivo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe mechanistic pathway to cytochrome c release for BIDBH3 peptide appears similar to native myrBID complex, yet the efficiency of triggering varies greatly. Near total release of cytochrome c from mitochondria requires but 10 nM myrBID complex, but 10 μM BIDBH3 peptide. Myristoylation increases the efficiency of BID targeting to mitochondria and could conceivably help focus its location on the outer mitochondrial membrane (Lutter et al., 2001; Zha et al., 2000). It is also possible that an integrated myrp15BID protein may more effectively present the BH3 domain to the BAK pocket. Of note the sources of mitochondria vary in their response to individual BH3 domains. BIDBH3 is more potent than BIMBH3 for liver mitochondria, whereas BIMBH3 is more effective on the FL5.12 mitochondria. This may reflect the presence of BAX on FL5.12 but not liver mitochondria. The efficiency of oligomerization (\nFIG. 4\n) supports a preference of BIDBH3 for BAK and BIMBH3 for BAX. An hypothesis that BIMBH3 prefers BAX would be consistent with the finding that BIM functions upstream of BAX in neuronal cell death following NGF deprivation (Putcha et al., 2001). The binding affinity of individual BH3 domains for BCL-2 members varies considerably (Sattler et al., 1997) (\nFIG. 7\n) providing a measurement for selectivity. Assessment of BH3 peptides by circular dichroism indicates that α-helical content is not the sole determinant of differential binding affinity, nor for the ability to induce BAX, BAK oligomerization and cytochrome c release. The specificity noted suggests a model in which distinct BH3 domains have select multidomain partners which provides a rationale for the large number of both BH3-only and multidomain antiapoptotic members.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhether the BH3 domains of multidomain members can initiate apoptosis is less certain. The BH3 domain isolated from BCL-X\nL \nstudied here showed no activity, while BH3 peptides from BAX have generated mixed results. Addition of a BH3 peptide from BAK to a Xenopus cell free system induced release of cytochrome c and caspase activity, although the site of action was unknown (Cosulich et al., 1997). Addition of BAXBH3 to mammalian mitochondria has been reported to release cytochrome c without inducing permeability transition (Polster et al., 2001), consistent with the mechanistic pathway dissected here; whereas, others report BAXBH3 peptides which do induce permeability transition and loss of transmembrane potential as an explanation for cytochrome c release (Narita et al., 1998). This may be inherent to α-helices themselves or to hybrid proteins which can damage organelle membranes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA substantial challenge for the future is to effectively transduce BH3 peptides or BH3 peptidomimetics into cells and assure that the induction of apoptosis is through the genetic pathway. Several studies (Holinger et al., 1999; Wang et al., 2000) including the initial polyarginine transduction approach presented here suggest this warrants further efforts. However, caution exists as a number of amphipathic α-helical peptides, especially if they are cationic, can be attracted to negatively charged membranes, including mitochondrial membranes where they can non-specifically disrupt the lipid matrix and membrane barrier function (Ellerby et al., 1999; Matsuzaki, 2001; Westerhoff et al., 1989). Others utilizing ANT-BH3BAD found toxicity was independent of the BCL-2 pathway and also killed yeast, which tolerate expression of the BH3-only proteins (Schimmer et al., 2001; Vieira et al., 2002). Alternative methods of internalization including receptor mediated pathways should also be considered for BH3 peptidomimetics. The work here provides a proof of concept that BH3 mimetics can be designed which initiate apoptosis correctly, at definable points in the genetic pathway. Moreover, it provides a paradigm and reagents to dissect the mechanism of action of future BH3 mimetics.\n\n\n \nExample 9\n\n\nScreening for BH3-Mimetics Using a Mitochodrial Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nBH3-mimetics, e.g., BAD-like or BID-like, are screened using a mitochondrial assay. (See, \nFIG. 9\n) Mitochondria from livers of mice that are either wild-type or Bak−/− are isolated. Isolated mitochondria are contacted with a test compound and cytochrome c release is determined No cytochrome c release in either wt or Bak−/− mitochondria indicates the test compound is a “sensitizing”, BAD-like mimetic. To further test this potential “sensitizing” BAD-like mimetic is added to subliminal concentration of a BID-like mimetic myrBID itself to determine if cytochrome c release is enhanced from BAK wt mitochondria. A BAD like mimetic is useful for example as a specific BCL-2/BCL-X\nL \ninhibitor. A compound that induces cytochrome c release in wt but not Bak−/− mitochondria indicates the compound is an “activating” BID-like mimetic. BADBH3 and myrBID are used as controls for sensitizing and activating compounds respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCandidate sensitizing compounds are further characterized by isolating mitochondria from either wt or over expressing BCL-2 FL5.12 cells. Sensitizer compound do not induce cytochrome c release from wt F15.12 mitochondria, however sensitizer compounds do enable subliminal concentrations of myrBID or a BID-like mimetic to release cytochrome c from BCL-2 protected mitochondria.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA candidate sensitizing compound is further tested for its ability to kill BCL-2 dependent rather than BCL-2 independent cancer cells in culture.\n\n\n \nExample 10\n\n\nProduction and Characterization of BCL-2 Conditional Knockin Mouse\n\n\n \n \n \nUsing standard recombinant DNA technology, the tet-BCL-2 allele was targeted to the \nDNA methyltransferase\n 1 locus (\nFIG. 10\n). By crossing the new mouse line with the MMTV-tTA line (Jackson Labs) mice were generated which conditionally overexpresse BCL-2 in epithelial cells and in B-lineage lymphocytes. Administration of doxycycline successfully suppresses BCL-2 overexpression in these animals. When these mice are crossed with mice expressing myc in the B-lymphocyte lineage (Eμ-myc mice, Jackson Labs) mice which uniformly have B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia were obtained.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo examine the effect of removing BCL-2 expression form the leukemia cells, the effects of doxycycline treatment in a cohort of 28 mice were examined. By genotype, each of the 28 mice contained the tet-BCL-2, the MMTV-tTA, and the Eμ-myc alleles. Phenotypically, each were found to have leukemia by blood smear, and a WBC in excess of 100,000/μl. At 4-5 weeks of age, half were treated with doxycycline (500 μg/ml) in drinking water, and half were left untreated. The WBC was measured by hemocytometer using 2 μl blood from tail which was lysed with 0.3% saponin and stained with Hoechst 33258. As shown in \nFIG. 11\n that the loss of BCL-2 expression induced by doxycycline treatment induces a dramatic, 1-2 log decrease in WBC and a remission of the leukemia. These data provide strong support for the requirement of BCL-2 for tumor maintenance in this murine cancer model, and validates this model for future in vivo testing of candidate BCL-2 inhibitors.\n\n\n \nExample 11\n\n\nPropagation of a Cell Lines Derived from the BCL-2 Conditional Knockin Mouse\n\n\n \n \n \nA culture a cell line from the bone marrow of a triply transgenic, leukemic mouse was propagated. When BCL-2 transgene expression is eliminated by doxycycline treatment, the cell line dies. This BCL-2 dependent cancer cell line is useful for cellular testing of candidate BCL-2 inhibitors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, as a control for specificity of a putative BCL-2 antagonist, a cell line from B-cell malignancies which are not dependent on BCL-2 expression were generated. The tumors arose in triply transgenic mice that had not been maintained on doxycycline to abolish BCL-2 transgene expression. Cell from these mice were grown in culture in the absence of doxycycline. Turning off BCL-2 expression by administration of doxycycline did not induce cell death. These results demonstrate that these cell lines are useful in conjunction with the BCL-2 dependent cell line described above to assess the specificity of action of a putative BCL-2 antagonist. A specific BCL-2 antagonist is a compound that kills the BCL-2 dependent cell line but does not kill the BCL-2 independent cell line.\n\n\n \nREFERENCES\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\nAdams, J.

For complete activation of T cells to occur, at least two distinct signaling events are required. A first signal is produced by the interaction of T cell receptors (TCR) expressed on T cells with specific antigens (Ag) presented in the context of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules expressed on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). A second (co-stimulation) signal results from the interaction between co-stimulatory ligands expressed on APCs and their corresponding receptors expressed on T cells. A dominant co-stimulation pathway involves the interaction between the CD80 (B7-1 or B7.1) and CD86 (B7-2 or B7.2) ligands expressed on APCs with CD28 and CTLA-4 (also known as CD152) expressed mainly on T cells. CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4) and CD28 serve as receptors for the CD80 and CD86 ligands.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPositive signaling is mediated through the CD28 receptor. Binding of the CD80 and/or CD86 ligand(s) to CD28 lowers the threshold of T cell activation by promoting the formation of immunological synapses (Viola A. et al., \nScience \n283:680-682 (1999)). Additionally, CD28 co-stimulation activates or enhances the production of factors central to T cell proliferation and survival, such as interleukin-2 (IL-2), NF-κB, and Bcl-XL (Norton S. D. et at., J. Immunol. 149:1556-1561 (1992); Vella A. T. et al., J. Immunol. 158: 4714-4720 (1997)). In vivo, CD28-deficient mice are severely immunocompromised and show poor antigen-specific T cell responses (Green, J. M. et al., Immunity 1:501-508 (1994)). T cell anergy or tolerance may result when T cells are activated in the absence of the costimulatory signal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNegative signaling is mediated through the CTLA-4 receptor. The CD80 and CD86 ligands each bind with high avidity to CTLA-4 and counterbalance immunoproliferative responses derived from CD28 signaling. Potential mechanisms of CTLA-4 signaling include competitive binding of co-stimulatory molecules CD80/CD86 (Masteller, E. M. et al., J. Immunol. 164:5319 (2000)), inhibition of TCR signaling by induction of phosphatases to the immunosynapse (Lee K. M. et al., Science 282:2263 (1998)), and disruption of the immunological synapse (Pentcheva-Hoang T. et al., Immunity 21:401 (2004); Chikuma S. et al., J. Exp. Med. 197:129 (2003); Schneider H. et al., Science 313: 1972 (2006)). In vivo, CTLA-4 deficient mice show profound autoimmune phenotypes characterized by massive tissue infiltration and organ destruction (Waterhouse P. et al., Science 270:985 (1995)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherapeutic agents designed to antagonize the CD80/CD86 co-stimulation pathway, such as soluble human CTLA-4-Ig, hold promise for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and disorders. The present invention provides advantageous molecules having improved abilities to modulate or suppress signaling through the CD80/CD86 co-stimulation pathway and methods of using such molecules for selected and differential manipulation of T cell responses.

which comprise a molecule of the invention (e.g., mutant CTLA-4 molecule) and an excipient, carrier, or diluent.

In \nFIG. 1\n, each mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein comprises a mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide of the invention fused at its C-terminus to the N-terminus of a human IgG2 (hIgG2) Fc polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIGS. 2A-2D\n are schematic diagrams of exemplary hCD80-Ig, hCD86-Ig, LEA29Y-Ig, and hCTLA-4-IgG2 fusion proteins, respectively. The signal peptide, extracellular domain (ECD), linker (if any), and Ig Fc domain of each fusion protein are shown schematically. The amino acid residues present at the junctions between the signal peptide, ECD, linker (if any), and Ig Fc are also shown. The signal peptide of each fusion protein is typically cleaved during processing and thus the secreted (mature) fusion protein typically does not contain the signal peptide sequence. \nFIG. 2D\n presents a schematic diagram of a human CTLA-4-IgG2 (“hCTLA-4-IgG2”) fusion protein comprising a human CTLA-4 extracellular domain (“hCTLA-4 ECD”) covalently fused at its C-terminus to the N-terminus of a human IgG2 polypeptide. The predicted polypeptide sequence of this hCTLA-4-IgG2 fusion protein is shown in SEQ ID NO:161 and comprises the following segments: hCTLA-4 signal peptide (amino acid residues 1-37), hCTLA-4 ECD polypeptide (amino acid residues 38-161), and human IgG2 Fc polypeptide (amino acid residues 162-389). No linker (e.g., no amino acid residue(s)) is included between the C-terminus of the hCTLA-4 ECD polypeptide and the N-terminus of the human IgG2 Fc. The human IgG2 Fc polypeptide comprises a hinge, CH2 domain, and CH3 domain of human IgG2. In \nFIG. 2D\n, the amino acid residues at the junctions between these various segments are shown. Specifically, the last four amino acid residues of the signal peptide, the first five and last five amino acid residues of the hCTLA-4 ECD polypeptide, and the first five and last five amino acid residues of the human IgG2 Fc polypeptide are shown.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe signal peptide is typically cleaved during processing and thus the secreted fusion protein (mature fusion protein) of hCTLA-4-IgG2 does not typically contain the signal peptide sequence. The polypeptide sequence of the mature or secreted form of this hCTLA-4-IgG2 fusion protein is shown in SEQ ID NO:162. The sequence of the hCTLA-4 ECD polypeptide comprises amino acid residues 1-124 of SEQ ID NO:162, and the sequence of human IgG2 Fc polypeptide comprises amino acid residues 125-352 of SEQ ID NO:162. In another aspect, this mature hCTLA-4 Ig fusion protein does not include the C-terminal lysine (K) residue and thus comprises amino acid residues 1-351 of SEQ ID NO:162.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe mature hCTLA-4-IgG2 fusion protein, which has a total of 352 amino acids, comprises amino acid residues 38-389 of the polypeptide sequence of the full-length WT hCTLA-4 protein shown in SEQ ID NO:160, and begins with the amino acid sequence: methionine-histidine-valine-alanine. If desired, the amino acids of the mature form can be numbered beginning with the Met of the Met-His-Val-Ala sequence, designating Met as the first residue (e.g., the ECD comprises amino acid residues numbered 1-124), as in SEQ ID NO:162. A mature hCTLA-4IgG2 dimer is the form of the fusion protein typically used in the assays of the Examples described infra, unless stated otherwise. A DNA sequence encoding the hCTLA-4-IgG2 fusion protein, which comprises the hCTLA-4 ECD fused to the hIgG2 Fc polypeptide, is shown in SEQ ID NO:163.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 3\n represents SDS/PAGE analyses of the following proteins: molecular weight markers of various mass (kilodaltons (kDa) (lane 1); an exemplary mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein of the invention based on clone D3 (i.e., D3-IgG2) (lane 2); an exemplary mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein based on clone D4 (i.e., D4-IgG2) (lane 3); and the Orencia® (Abatacept) fusion protein (lane 4) (Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Princeton, N.J.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 4\n presents an elution profile of an exemplary mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein of the invention (i.e., D3-IgG2) from SEC analysis, demonstrating that mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins of the invention are homogenous in size when purified from transiently-transfected COS cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 5\n shows a typical Biacore™ analysis of the binding of the following fusion proteins to hCD86-Ig: Orencia® fusion protein, LEA29Y-Ig, and D3-IgG2. The dissociation phase of the analysis begins at the time marked by the arrow. The Orencia® fusion protein, which is composed of the wild-type human CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide fused to a mutant IgG1 Fc domain polypeptide, effectively serves as a wild-type human CTLA-4-Ig control. A mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein of the invention, such as D3-IgG2, which has a higher avidity binding to CD86-Ig than the Orencia® fusion protein has a slower rate of dissociation from CD86-Ig than the Orencia® protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 6\n is a graphical representation of the results of PBMC proliferation inhibition assays (with anti-CD3 antibody stimulation) involving exemplary mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins of the invention (D3-04-IgG2, D3-11-IgG2, D3-12-IgG2, D3-14-IgG2). These assays show that mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins of the invention are significantly more potent than Orencia® and LEA29Y-Ig in inhibiting T cell proliferation in vitro.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 7\n is a graphical representation of CD4\n+\n T cell proliferation inhibition assays (with anti-CD3 stimulation and hB7.2-dependent costimulation) involving an exemplary set of mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins of the invention. The Orencia® and LEA29Y-Ig fusion proteins were included as controls for comparison.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 8\n is a graphical representation of PBMC proliferation inhibition assays (with PPD antigen stimulation) involving an exemplary set of mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins of the invention. Orencia® and LEA29Y-Ig were included as controls for comparison.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 9\n is a graphical representation of one-way mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) proliferation inhibition assays involving an exemplary mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein of the invention—D3-IgG2. The Orencia® and LEA29Y-Ig fusion proteins were included as controls for comparison.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 10\n is a schematic diagram showing the structure of an exemplary mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein of the invention. Two identical monomeric mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins are shown schematically, each comprising a mature mutant CTLA-4 ECD fused at its C-terminus to the N-terminus of a human IgG2 Fc polypeptide. Each human IgG2 polypeptide includes an IgG2 hinge, CH2 domain, and CH3 domain. Exemplary amino acid residues present at the junctions between the ECD and Ig Fc polypeptides are also shown. The amino acid residues at the junctions between these components may differ depending upon the mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide sequence and/or Ig polypeptide sequence. The dimeric fusion protein results from the formation of at least one disulfide bond between cysteine residues at analogous positions in the two monomers. The cysteine (C) residues potentially involved in forming disulfide bonds between the two monomers are marked with asterisks. The signal peptide of each monomeric fusion protein is typically cleaved during processing and thus the secreted (mature) fusion protein typically does not include the signal peptide sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 11\n is a graphical representation of CD4\n+\n T cell proliferation assays (with anti-CD3 stimulation and hB7.2-dependent costimulation) involving hCTLA-4-IgG2, Orencia® and LEA29Y-Ig fusion proteins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIGS. 12A-12F\n present an alignment of the polypeptide sequence of the wild-type human CTLA-4 extracellular domain (designated in the figure as “hCTLA4ECD”), the polypeptide sequence of the LEA29Y polypeptide (designated in the figure as “LEA29YECD”), and the polypeptide sequences of exemplary mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptides of the invention. The clone names of these mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptides of the invention are indicated at the left. Amino acid residues that are identical to those in the wild-type human CTLA-4 ECD are indicated with a period (.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 13\n presents a BLOSUM62 matrix.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIGS. 14A-14D\n show exemplary alignments and alignment scores determined by manual calculation for two amino acid sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIGS. 15A-15B\n show pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles for Orencia® fusion protein, human CTLA-4-IgG2, and representative mutant CTLA-4-IgG2 fusion proteins of the invention administered at 1 mg/kg as a single (A) intravenous (IV) bolus or (B) subcutaneous (SC) injection in rats.\n\n\n \n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nDefinitions\n\n\n \n \n \nIt is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting. Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which the invention pertains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “nucleic acid” and “polynucleotide” are used interchangeably to refer to a polymer of nucleic acid residues (e.g., deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides) in either single- or double-stranded form. Unless specifically limited, the terms encompass nucleic acids containing known analogues of natural nucleotides that have similar binding properties as the reference nucleic acid and are metabolized in a manner similar to naturally-occurring nucleotides. Unless otherwise indicated, a particular nucleic acid sequence also implicitly encompasses conservatively modified variants thereof (e.g., degenerate codon substitutions) and complementary nucleotide sequences as well as the sequence explicitly indicated. Specifically, degenerate codon substitutions may be achieved by generating sequences in which the third position of one or more selected (or all) codons is substituted with mixed-base and/or deoxyinosine residues (Batzer et al., Nucleic Acid Res. 19:5081 (1991); Ohtsuka et al., J. Biol. Chem. 260:2605 2608 (1985); and Cassol et al. (1992); Rossolini et al., Mol. Cell. Probes 8:91 98 (1994)). The term nucleic acid or polynucleotide is used interchangeably with cDNA or mRNA encoded by a gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “gene” broadly refers to any nucleic acid segment (e.g., DNA) associated with a biological function. A gene may include a coding sequence and/or regulatory sequence required for their expression. A gene may also include non-expressed DNA nucleic acid segment(s) that, e.g., form recognition sequences for other protein(s) (e.g., promoter, enhancer, or other regulatory region). A gene can be obtained from a variety of sources, including cloning from a source of interest or synthesizing from known or predicted sequence information, and may include one or more sequences designed to have desired parameters.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “polypeptide,” “peptide,” and “protein” are used interchangeably to refer to a polymer of amino acid residues. The terms apply to amino acid polymers in which one or more amino acid residue is an artificial chemical mimetic of a corresponding naturally occurring amino acid, as well as to naturally occurring amino acid polymers and non-naturally occurring amino acid polymers. As used herein, the terms encompass amino acid chains of any length, including full-length proteins (i.e., antigens), wherein the amino acid residues are linked by covalent peptide bonds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNumbering of a given amino acid polymer or nucleic acid polymer “corresponds to” or is “relative to” the numbering of a selected amino acid polymer or nucleic acid polymer when the position of any given polymer component (e.g., amino acid, nucleotide, also referred to generically as a “residue”) is designated by reference to the same or an equivalent position in the selected amino acid or nucleic acid polymer, rather than by the actual numerical position of the component in the given polymer. Thus, for example, the numbering of a given amino acid position in a given polypeptide sequence corresponds to the same or equivalent amino acid position in a selected polypeptide sequence used as a reference sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “equivalent position” (for example, an “equivalent amino acid position” or “equivalent nucleic acid position” or “equivalent residue position”) is defined herein as a position (such as an amino acid position or nucleic acid position or residue position) of a test polypeptide (or test polynucleotide) sequence which aligns with a corresponding position of a reference polypeptide (or reference polynucleotide) sequence, when aligned (preferably optimally aligned) using an alignment algorithm as described herein. The equivalent amino acid position of the test polypeptide sequence need not have the same numerical position number as the corresponding position of the test polypeptide. Likewise, the equivalent nucleic acid position of the test polynucleotide sequence need not have the same numerical position number as the corresponding position of the test polynucleotide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “mutant” polypeptide comprises a polypeptide sequence that differs in one or more amino acid residues from the polypeptide sequence of a parent or reference polypeptide (such as, e.g., a wild-type (WT) polypeptide sequence). In one aspect, a mutant polypeptide comprises a polypeptide sequence which differs from the polypeptide sequence of a parent or reference polypeptide in from about 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%, 11%, 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%, 20%, 30% 40%, 50% or more of the total number of residues of the parent or reference polypeptide sequence. In another aspect, a mutant polypeptide comprises a polypeptide sequence that has at least about 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% sequence identity to the polypeptide sequence of a parent or reference polypeptide. In another aspect, a mutant polypeptide comprises a polypeptide sequence that differs from the polypeptide sequence of a parent or reference polypeptide in from 1 to 100 or more amino acid residues (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 or more amino acid residues). A mutant polypeptide may comprise a polypeptide sequence that differs from the polypeptide sequence of a parent or reference polypeptide by, e.g., the deletion, addition, or substitution of one or more amino acid residues (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 or more amino acid residues) of the parent or reference polypeptide, or any combination of such deletion(s), addition(s), and/or substitution(s). The reference or parent polypeptide may itself be a mutant polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “mutant” nucleic acid comprises a nucleotide sequence that differs in one or more nucleic acid residues from the nucleotide sequence of a parent or reference nucleic acid (such as a WT nucleic acid). In one aspect, a mutant nucleic acid comprises a nucleotide sequence which differs from the nucleotide sequence of a parent or reference nucleic acid in from about 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%, 11%, 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%, 20%, 30% 40%, 50% or more of the total number of residues of the parent or reference nucleotide sequence. In another aspect, a mutant nucleic acid comprises a nucleotide sequence that has at least about 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% sequence identity to the nucleotide sequence of a parent or reference nucleic acid. In another aspect, a mutant nucleic acid comprises a nucleotide sequence that differs from the nucleotide sequence of a parent or reference nucleic acid in from 1 to 100 or more nucleotide residues (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 or more nucleotide residues). A mutant nucleic acid may comprise a nucleotide sequence that differs from that of a parent or reference nucleic acid by, e.g., the deletion, addition, or substitution of one or more nucleotide residues (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 or more nucleotide residues) of the parent or reference nucleic acid, or any combination of such deletion(s), addition(s), and/or substitution(s). A mutation in a nucleic acid may also result from an alternative splicing or truncation of nucleotides or errors in processing or cleavage of nucleotides. The reference or parent nucleic acid may itself be a mutant nucleic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Naturally occurring” as applied to an object means the object is found in nature as distinct from being artificially produced by man. “Non-naturally occurring” as applied to an object means the object is not naturally occurring (i.e., that the object cannot be found in nature). For example, a non-naturally occurring polypeptide refers to a polypeptide that has been prepared by man, such as, for example, by being synthesized in vitro or prepared artificially.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “subsequence” or “fragment” of a sequence of interest is any portion of the entire sequence, up to but not including the entire sequence of interest.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA nucleic acid, protein or other component is “isolated” when it is partially or completely separated from components with which it is normally associated (other proteins, nucleic acids, cells, synthetic reagents, etc.). On a molar basis, an isolated species is more abundant than other species in a composition. For example, an isolated species may comprise at least about 50%, 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% (on a molar basis) of all macromolecular species present. Preferably, the species of interest is purified to essential homogeneity (i.e., contaminant species cannot be detected in the composition by conventional detection methods). Purity and homogeneity can be determined using a number of techniques well known in the art, such as agarose or polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of a protein or nucleic acid sample, followed by visualization upon staining. If desired, a high-resolution technique, such as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or a similar means can be utilized for purification of the material.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “purified” as applied to nucleic acids or polypeptides generally denotes a nucleic acid or polypeptide that is essentially free from other components as determined by analytical techniques well known in the art (e.g., a purified polypeptide or polynucleotide forms a discrete band in an electrophoretic gel, chromatographic eluate, and/or a media subjected to density gradient centrifugation). For example, a nucleic acid or polypeptide that gives rise to essentially one band in an electrophoretic gel is “purified.” A purified nucleic acid or polypeptide is at least about 50% pure, usually at least about 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.5%, 99.6%, 99.7%, 99.8% or more pure (e.g., percent by weight on a molar basis).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a related sense, the invention provides methods of enriching compositions for one or more molecules of the invention, such as one or more polypeptides or polynucleotides of the invention. A composition is enriched for a molecule when there is a substantial increase in the concentration of the molecule after application of a purification or enrichment technique. A substantially pure polypeptide or polynucleotide will typically comprise at least about 55%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98, 99%, 99.5% or more by weight (on a molar basis) of all macromolecular species in a particular composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA nucleic acid or polypeptide is “recombinant” when it is artificial or engineered, or derived from an artificial or engineered protein or nucleic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “recombinant” when used with reference to a cell typically indicates that the cell replicates a heterologous nucleic acid or expresses a polypeptide encoded by a heterologous nucleic acid. Recombinant cells can comprise genes that are not found within the native (non-recombinant) form of the cell. Recombinant cells also include those that comprise genes that are found in the native form of the cell, but are modified and re-introduced into the cell by artificial means. The term also encompasses cells that comprise a nucleic acid endogenous to the cell that has been modified without removing the nucleic acid from the cell; such modifications include those obtained by gene replacement, site-specific mutation, and related techniques known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Recombinant DNA technology includes techniques for the production of recombinant DNA in vitro and transfer of the recombinant DNA into cells where it may be expressed or propagated, thereby producing a recombinant polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “recombinant expression cassette” or simply an “expression cassette” is a nucleic acid construct, generated recombinantly or synthetically, with nucleic acid elements that are capable of effecting expression of a structural gene in hosts compatible with such sequences. Expression cassettes include at least promoters and optionally transcription termination signals. Typically, the recombinant expression cassette includes a nucleic acid to be transcribed (e.g., a nucleic acid encoding a desired polypeptide) and a promoter. Additional factors necessary or helpful in effecting expression may also be used as described herein. For example, an expression cassette can also include nucleotide sequences that encode a signal sequence that directs secretion of an expressed protein from the host cell. Transcription termination signals, enhancers, and other nucleic acid sequences that influence gene expression, can also be included in an expression cassette.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “exogenous” nucleic acid,” “exogenous DNA segment,” “heterologous sequence,” or “heterologous nucleic acid,” as used herein, is one that originates from a source foreign to the particular host cell, or, if from the same source, is modified from its original form. Thus, a heterologous gene in a host cell includes a gene that is endogenous to the particular host cell, but has been modified. Modification of a heterologous sequence in the applications described herein typically occurs through the use of directed molecular evolution methods. Thus, the terms refer to a DNA segment which is foreign or heterologous to the cell, or homologous to the cell but in a position within the host cell nucleic acid in which the element is not ordinarily found. Exogenous nucleic acids or exogenous DNA are expressed to yield exogenous polypeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “vector” may be any agent that is able to deliver or maintain a nucleic acid in a host cell and includes, for example, but is not limited to, plasmids (e.g., DNA plasmids), naked nucleic acids, viral vectors, viruses, nucleic acids complexed with one or more polypeptide or other molecules, as well as nucleic acids immobilized onto solid phase particles. Vectors are described in detail below. A vector can be useful as an agent for delivering or maintaining an exogenous gene and/or protein in a host cell. A vector may be capable of transducing, transfecting, or transforming a cell, thereby causing the cell to replicate or express nucleic acids and/or proteins other than those native to the cell or in a manner not native to the cell. A vector may include materials to aid in achieving entry of a nucleic acid into the cell, such as a viral particle, liposome, protein coating, or the like. Any method of transferring a nucleic acid into the cell may be used; unless otherwise indicated, the term vector does not imply any particular method of delivering a nucleic acid into a cell or imply that any particular cell type is the subject of transduction. The present invention is not limited to any specific vector for delivery or maintenance of any nucleic acid of the invention, including, e.g., a nucleic acid encoding a mutant CTLA-4 polypeptide of the invention or a fragment thereof (e.g., mutant CTLA-4 ECD) that binds CD80 and/or CD86 or a fragment thereof (e.g., a CD80 ECD or CD86 ECD).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “expression vector” typically refers to a nucleic acid construct or sequence, generated recombinantly or synthetically, with a series of specific nucleic acid elements that permit transcription of a particular nucleic acid in a host cell. The expression vector typically includes a nucleic acid to be transcribed operably linked to a promoter. The term “expression” includes any step involved in the production of the polypeptide including, but not limited to, transcription, post-transcriptional modification, translation, post-translational modification, and/or secretion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “signal peptide” is a peptide (or amino acid) sequence that typically precedes a polypeptide of interest and is translated in conjunction with the polypeptide and directs or facilitates the polypeptide to the secretory system. A signal peptide is typically covalently attached or fused to the amino terminus of the polypeptide of interest and facilitates secretion of the polypeptide of interest from a host cell. The signal peptide is typically cleaved from the polypeptide of interest following translation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “encoding” refers to the ability of a nucleotide sequence to code for one or more amino acids. The term does not require a start or stop codon. An amino acid sequence can be encoded in any one of six different reading frames provided by a polynucleotide sequence and its complement.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “control sequence” is defined herein to include all components, which are necessary or advantageous for the expression of a polypeptide of the present invention. Each control sequence may be native or foreign to the nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide. Such control sequences include, but are not limited to, a leader, polyadenylation sequence, propeptide sequence, promoter, signal peptide sequence, and transcription terminator. At a minimum, a control sequence includes a promoter, and transcriptional and translational stop signals. The control sequences may be provided with linkers for the purpose of introducing specific restriction sites facilitating ligation of the control sequences with the coding region of the nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “coding sequence” refers to a nucleotide sequence that directly specifies the amino acid sequence of its protein product. The boundaries of the coding sequence are generally determined by an open reading frame (ORF), which may begin with the ATG start codon.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA nucleic acid is “operably linked” with another nucleic acid sequence when it is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For instance, a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it directs transcription of the coding sequence. Operably linked means that the DNA sequences being linked are typically contiguous and, where necessary to join two protein coding regions, contiguous and in reading frame. However, since enhancers generally function when separated from the promoter by several kilobases and intronic sequences may be of variable lengths, some polynucleotide elements may be operably linked but not contiguous.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “host cell” is any cell that is susceptible to transformation with a nucleic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Substantially the entire length of a polynucleotide sequence” or “substantially the entire length of a polypeptide sequence” refers to at least about 50%, 60%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.5% or more of the length of a polynucleotide sequence or polypeptide sequence, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “antigen” refers to a substance that reacts with the product(s) of an immune response stimulated by a specific immunogen. See, e.g., J\nULIUS \nC\nRUSE ET AL\n., A\nTLAS OF \nI\nMMUNOLOGY \n60 (1999); R\nICHARD \nC\nOICO ET AL\n., I\nMMUNOLOGY\n: A S\nHORT \nC\nOURSE \n27-30 (5\nth \ned. 2003). An immune response may comprise a humoral response and/or a cell-mediated immune response (e.g., cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs)). Products of an immune response may include antibodies and/or CTLs. Antigens are typically macromolecules (e.g., polypeptides, nucleic acids, complex carbohydrates, phospholipids, polysaccharides) that are foreign to the host; that portion of the antigen known as the antigenic determinant reacts with (e.g., binds to) the product(s) of the immune response, such as an antibody or a specific T cell receptor on a T lymphocyte. An antigen may, but not necessarily, induce an immune response as well as react with the product(s) of the immune response. “Antigenicity” refers the state or property of being antigenic—i.e., having the properties of an antigen. Specificity of an antigen may be shown in the relation of an antigen to its antibody or vice versa; an antigen typically reacts in a highly specific fashion with its corresponding antibody and not with the same degree of specificity with other antibodies evoked by the immunogen. An “antigenic amount” is an amount of an antigen that detectably reacts with the product(s) of an immune response stimulated by a specific immunogen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “immunogen” is a substance that is capable of inducing an immune response rather than immunological tolerance. See, e.g., J\nULIUS \nC\nRUSE ET AL\n., supra at 60-61; R\nICHARD \nC\nOICO\n, supra at 27-30. Immunogens also reacts with (e.g., bind) the product(s) of the induced immune response that has or have been specifically induced against them. Thus, all immunogens are antigens. “Immunogenicity” refers the state or property of being immunogenic—i.e., having the properties of an immunogen. An “immunogenic amount” is an amount of an immunogen that is effective to induce a detectable an immune response. An immunogen may elicit a strong immune response in a subject, such as at least partial or complete protective immunity to at least one pathogen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “immunomodulator” or “immunomodulatory” molecule, such as an immunomodulatory polypeptide or nucleic acid, modulates an immune response. By “modulation” or “modulating” an immune response is intended that the immune response is altered. For example, “modulation” of or “modulating” an immune response in a subject generally means that an immune response is stimulated, induced, inhibited, decreased, suppressed, increased, enhanced, or otherwise altered in the subject. Such modulation of an immune response can be assessed by means known to those skilled in the art, including those described below. An “immunosuppressor” or “immunosuppressant” is a molecule, such as a polypeptide or nucleic acid, which suppresses an immune response.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, an “antibody” (abbreviated “Ab”) refers to an immunoglobulin protein (abbreviated “Ig”), whether natural or wholly or partially synthetically produced. The term includes all derivatives thereof that maintain specific binding ability to an antigen. The term also covers any protein having a binding domain that is homologous or largely homologous to an immunoglobulin binding domain. Such proteins may be derived from natural sources, or partly or wholly synthetically produced. An antibody may be monoclonal or polyclonal. An antibody may be a member of any immunoglobulin class, including any of the five human classes: IgA (which includes subclasses IgA1 and IgA2), IgD, IgE, IgG (which includes subclasses IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4), and IgM. Antibodies comprise paired heavy and light polypeptide chains, and each such chain is composed of individual immunoglobulin domains. Each chain includes a constant (C) region and a variable (V) region. A typical antibody structural unit comprises a tetramer. Each tetramer is composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one “light” (about 25 kDa) and one “heavy” chain (about 50-70 kDa). Heavy chains exist in five major types (γ, μ, δ, α, and ε) depending on the antibody class and contain about 450-600 amino acid residues. Light chains are of two major types (λ and κ) and contain about 230 amino acid residues. As an example, an IgG antibody is a tetrameric protein comprising two heavy chains and two light chains. Each IgG heavy chain contains four immunoglobulin domains linked in the following order from the N-terminus to the C-terminus: V\nH\n-C\nH\n1-C\nH\n2-C\nH\n3 (also sometimes abbreviated as VH-CH1-CH2-CH3). These abbreviations refer to the heavy chain variable domain, heavy chain \nconstant domain\n 1, heavy chain \nconstant domain\n 2, and heavy chain constant domain 3), respectively. A heavy chain may also be referred to by antibody class, such as, e.g., Cγ1, which represents the first constant domain of the gamma (γ) heavy chain of IgG antibody. Each IgG light chain comprises two immunoglobulin domains linked in the following order from N- to C-terminus: V\nH\n-C\nL\n, wherein V\nH \nand C\nL \nrefer to the light chain variable domain and light chain constant domain, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe variable region of an antibody, which typically comprises about 100 to 110 or more amino acids at the N-terminus of each polypeptide chain, includes the antigen binding determinants and thus is primarily responsible for antigen recognition and specificity. The greatest degree of amino acid sequence variability between antibodies is found in the variable region. Most sequence variability occurs in the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) located in the variable region. There are a total of six CDRs, three CDRs in each heavy chain and three CDRs in each light chain, which together form the antigen-binding site. The heavy chain CDRs are designated as V\nH \nCDR1, V\nH \nCDR2, and V\nH \nCDR3 while the light chain CDRs are designated as V\nL \nCDR1, V\nL \nCDR2, and V\nL \nCDR3. The region located outside the CDRs is termed the framework (FR) region. Framework regions of different antibodies may vary in amino acid residues, but the degree of amino acid variability is not nearly as great as that which exists between the variable regions of different antibodies. In many instances, the framework regions provide a stable or constant scaffold for the amino acid diversity presented by the CDRs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “antibody fragment” refers to any derivative of an antibody that is less than full-length. Examples of antibody fragments include, but are not limited to, e.g., the antigen binding fragment (Fab) containing V\nH\n-\nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 and V\nH\n-C\nL\n, the variable fragment (Fv) containing V\nH \nand V\nL\n, the single chain variable fragment (scFv) containing V\nH \nand V\nL \nlinked together in one chain, as well as other V region fragments, such as Fab′, F(ab)\n2\n, F(ab′)\n2\n, dsFv diabody, Fc, and Fd polypeptide fragments. See Scott, T. A. and Mercer, E. I., C\nONCISE \nE\nNCYCLOPEDIA\n: B\nIOCHEMISTRY AND \nM\nOLECULAR \nB\nIOLOGY \n(de Gruyter, 3d ed. 1997), and Watson, J. D. et al., R\nECOMBINANT \nDNA (2d ed. 1992) (hereinafter “Watson”).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn antibody fragment may be produced by any means known in the art. For instance, the antibody fragment may be enzymatically or chemically produced by fragmentation of an intact antibody or it may be recombinantly produced from a gene encoding the partial antibody sequence. For example, fragments of antibodies can be produced by digestion with a peptidase. For example, pepsin digests an antibody below the disulfide linkages in the hinge region to produce F(ab′)\n2\n, a dimer of a Fab fragment which itself is a light chain joined to V\nH\n-\nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 by a disulfide bond. The F(ab′)\n2 \nmay be reduced under mild conditions to break the disulfide linkage in the hinge region thereby converting the (Fab′)\n2 \ndimer into an Fab′ monomer. The Fab′ monomer is essentially a Fab fragment with part of the hinge region. See F\nUNDAMENTAL \nI\nMMUNOLOGY\n, W. E. Paul, ed., Raven Press, N.Y. (1993) for a more detailed description of antibodies and antibody fragments. While various antibody fragments are defined in terms of the digestion of an intact antibody, one of skill will appreciate that such Fab′ fragments may be synthesized de novo either chemically or by utilizing recombinant DNA methodology. Thus, the term also includes antibody fragments either produced by the modification of whole antibodies or synthesized de novo using recombinant DNA methodologies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the antibody fragment may be wholly or partially synthetically produced. The antibody fragment may optionally be a single chain antibody fragment. Alternatively, the fragment may comprise multiple chains that are linked together, for instance, by disulfide linkages. The fragment may also optionally be a multimolecular complex. A functional antibody fragment will typically comprise at least about 50 amino acids and more typically will comprise at least about 200 amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn Fc region or domain of an immunoglobulin or antibody molecule (also termed an Ig Fc polypeptide or Fc polypeptide) corresponds largely to the constant region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain, and is responsible for various functions, including the antibody's effector function(s). For example, the Ig Fc region of IgG molecule comprises the immunoglobulin domains CH2 and CH3 and the N-terminal hinge region leading into CH2. The hinge region is a portion of the heavy chain between Fc and CH1 containing the inter-heavy chain disulfide binds and gives flexibility to the antibody molecule. The constant domains of the Fc region interact with cells of the immune system. Fc receptors are proteins that bind the Fc region of antibodies. One significant family of Fc receptors for the IgG antibody class includes the Fc gamma receptors (FcγR). The binding of antibodies to Fc receptors on cells mediates a number of antibody functions. Different IgG subclasses exhibit different affinities for Fc gamma receptors. In general, IgG1 and IgG3 bind to the receptors with a greater affinity than IgG2 and IgG4. Fc receptors are expressed on a variety of cells, including, e.g., B cells, monocytes, dendritic cells, neutrophils, and certain lymphocytes. Binding of an Ig Fc to its receptor brings these effector cells to sites of the bound antigen, resulting ultimately in signaling and immune responses, including B cell activation, inflammatory responses, cytotoxic responses, and phagocytic responses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn Ig Fc fusion is a molecule comprising one or more polypeptides (or one or more small molecules) operably linked to an Fc region of an immunoglobulin or antibody. See, e.g., Chamow et al., 1996, Trends Biotechnol. 14:52-60. Accordingly, an Ig Fc fusion protein is a molecule comprising one or more polypeptides operably linked to an Ig Fc region. An Ig Fc fusion protein may comprise, for example, the Fc region of an antibody (which facilitates effector functions and pharmacokinetics) and the binding region or binding domain of a receptor protein or ligand protein or other protein or fragment thereof. The binding region or binding domain mediates recognition of the target receptor or ligand (comparable to that of antibody variable region of an antibody for an antigen). An Ig Fc region may be linked indirectly or directly to one or more polypeptides or small molecules (fusion partners). Various linkers known in the art and as described in greater detail below can be used to link an Ig Fc to a fusion partner to generate an Ig Fc fusion. An Ig Fc fusion protein typically comprises an Ig Fc region covalently linked directly or indirectly to at least one polypeptide, which polypeptide typically binds a target ligand or receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMonoclonal or polyclonal antibodies can be prepared any technique known in the art can be used (see, e.g., Kohler & Milstein, Nature 256:495 497 (1975); Kozbor et al., Immunology Today 4: 72 (1983); Cole et al., pp. 77 96 in Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy (1985)). Techniques for the production of single chain antibodies (U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,778) can be adapted to produce antibodies to polypeptides of the invention. In addition, transgenic mice or other organisms, including mammals, may be used to express humanized antibodies. Phage display technology can be used to identify antibodies and heteromeric Fab fragments that specifically bind to selected antigens (see, e.g., McCafferty et al., Nature 348:552 554 (1990); Marks et al., Biotechnology 10:779 783 (1992)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “epitope” refers to an antigenic determinant capable of specific binding to a part of an antibody. Epitopes usually consist of chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids or sugar side chains and usually have specific 3-dimensional structural characteristics, as well as specific charge characteristics. Conformational and nonconformational epitopes are distinguished in that the binding to the former but not the latter is lost in the presence of denaturing solvents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “specific binding affinity” between two molecules, e.g., a ligand and a receptor, means a preferential binding of one molecule for another. The binding of molecules is typically considered specific if the equilibrium binding association constant (e.g., K\nA\n) is about 1×10\n2 \nM\n−1 \nto about 1×10\n13 \nM\n−1 \nor greater, including about 10\n4 \nto 10\n13 \nM\n−1\n, about 10\n6 \nto 10\n12 \nM\n−1\n, about 10\n8 \nM\n−1 \nto 10\n11 \nM\n−1 \nor about 10\n8 \nto 10\n10 \nM\n−1\n. Values of K\nA \nfor the binding interaction between an antigen and an antibody typically range from about 10\n5 \nM\n−1 \nto about 10\n12 \nM\n−1\n, usually about 10\n7 \nM\n−1 \nto about 10\n11 \nM\n−1\n, and often about 10\n8 \nM\n−1 \nto about 10\n10 \nM\n−1\n. K\nA \n(M\n−1\n) is determined by calculating k\na\n/k\nd\n, where k\na \nis the association rate constant and k\nd \nis the disassociation rate constant. The units of k\na \nand k\nd \nare M\n−1 \ns\n−1 \nand s\n−1\n, respectively. The equilibrium dissociation constant, K\nD\n, is the reciprocal of K\nA\n. K\nD\n=k\nd\n/k\na\n. For the reaction A+B<=>AB (representing a single ligand binding to a single protein of interest (e.g., receptor)), K\nD \nis equal to ([A]·[B])/[AB]. Non-limiting examples of well-known techniques for measuring binding affinities and/or avidities of molecules include, e.g., Biacore™ technology (GE Healthcare) as discussed elsewhere herein, isothermal titration microcalorimetry (MicroCal LLC, Northampton, Mass. USA), ELISA, and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) methods. For example, FACS or other sorting methods may be used to select for populations of molecules (such as for example, cell surface-displayed ligands) that specifically bind to the associated binding pair member (such as a receptor, e.g., a soluble receptor). Ligand-receptor complexes may be detected and sorted e.g., by fluorescence (e.g., by reacting the complex with a fluorescent antibody that recognizes the complex). Molecules of interest that bind an associated binding pair member (e.g., receptor) are pooled and re-sorted in the presence of lower concentrations of receptor. By performing multiple rounds sorting in the presence of decreasing concentrations of receptor (an exemplary concentration range being on the order of 10\n−6 \nM down to 10\n−13 \nM, i.e., 1 micromolar (μM) down to 1 nanomolar (nM), or less (e.g., 10\n−11 \nM or 10\n−12\nM), depending on the nature of the ligand-receptor interaction), populations of the molecule of interest exhibiting specific binding affinity for the receptor may be isolated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase “specifically (or selectively) binds” to an antibody or “specifically (or selectively) immunoreactive with,” when referring to a protein, refers to a binding reaction that is determinative of the presence of the protein in a heterogeneous population of proteins and other biologics. Thus, under designated immunoassay conditions, the specified antibodies bind to a particular protein at least two times the background and do not substantially bind in a significant amount to other proteins present in the sample. Specific binding to an antibody under such conditions may require an antibody that is selected for its specificity for a particular protein. A variety of immunoassay formats may be used to select antibodies specifically immunoreactive with a particular protein. For example, solid-phase ELISA immunoassays are routinely used to select antibodies specifically immunoreactive with a protein (see, e.g., Harlow & Lane, Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual (1988), for a description of immunoassay formats and conditions that can be used to determine specific immunoreactivity). Usually, a specific or selective reaction will be at least twice background signal or noise and more typically more than 10 to 100 times background.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “cytokine” includes, e.g., but is not limited to, interleukins, interferons (IFN), chemokines, hematopoietic growth factors, tumor necrosis factors (TNF), and transforming growth factors. In general, these are small molecular weight proteins that regulate maturation, activation, proliferation, and differentiation of cells of the immune system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “screening” describes, in general, a process that identifies optimal molecules of the present invention, such as, e.g., including polypeptides of the invention, and related fusion proteins comprising the same, and nucleic acids encoding all such molecules. Several properties of the respective molecules can be used in selection and screening, for example, an ability of a respective molecule to induce or alter a desired immune response in a test system or in an in vitro, ex vivo, or in vivo application. “Selection” is a form of screening in which identification and physical separation are achieved simultaneously by expression of a selection marker, which, in some genetic circumstances, allows cells expressing the marker to survive while other cells die (or vice versa). Screening markers include, for example, luciferase, beta-galactosidase and green fluorescent protein, reaction substrates, and the like. Selection markers include drug and toxin resistance genes, and the like. Another mode of selection involves physical sorting based on a detectable event, such as binding of a ligand to a receptor, reaction of a substrate with an enzyme, or any other physical process which can generate a detectable signal either directly (e.g., by utilizing a chromogenic substrate or ligand) or indirectly (e.g., by reacting with a chromogenic secondary antibody). Selection by physical sorting can by accomplished by a variety of methods, including, but not limited to, e.g., y FACS in whole cell or microdroplet formats.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBecause of limitations in studying primary immune responses in vitro, in vivo studies are particularly useful screening methods. In some such studies, a polynucleotide or polypeptide of the invention is first introduced to a test subject (e.g., a mammal, such as an animal), and an induced immune response is subsequently studied by analyzing the type of immune response in the immunized animal (e.g., antibody production in the immunized animal's serum, proliferation of T cells), or by studying the quality or strength of the induced immune response in the immunized animal (e.g., induced antibody titer level).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “subject” as used herein includes, but is not limited to, an organism or animal, including mammals and non-mammals. A mammal includes, e.g., but is not limited to, a human, non-human primate (e.g., baboon, orangutan, monkey, gorilla), mouse, dog, pig, cow, goat, cat, rabbit, rat, guinea pig, hamster, horse, sheep, or other non-human mammal. A non-mammal includes, e.g., but is not limited to, a non-mammalian invertebrate and non-mammalian vertebrate, such as a bird (e.g., a chicken or duck) or a fish.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutical composition” refers to a composition suitable for pharmaceutical use in a subject, including an animal or human. A pharmaceutical composition typically comprises an effective amount of an active agent and a carrier, excipient, or diluent. The carrier, excipient, or diluent is typically a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, excipient or diluent, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “effective amount” refers to a dosage (or dose) or amount of a substance sufficient to produce a desired result. The desired result may comprise an objective or subjective improvement in the recipient of the dosage or amount. For example, the desired result may comprise a measurable, detectable or testable induction, promotion, enhancement or modulation of an immune response in a subject to whom a dosage or amount of a particular antigen or immunogen (or composition thereof) has been administered. A dosage (or dose) or amount of an immunogen sufficient to produce such result can be described as an “immunogenic” dosage (or dose) or amount.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “prophylactic treatment” is a treatment administered to a subject who does not display signs or symptoms of, or displays only early signs or symptoms of, a disease, pathology, or disorder, such that treatment is administered for the purpose of preventing or decreasing the risk of developing the disease, pathology, or disorder. A prophylactic treatment functions as a preventative treatment against a disease, pathology, or disorder, or as a treatment that inhibits or reduces further development or enhancement of a disease, pathology or disorder. A “prophylactic activity” is an activity of an agent that, when administered to a subject who does not display signs or symptoms of, or who displays only early signs or symptoms of, a pathology, disease, or disorder, prevents or decreases the risk of the subject developing the pathology, disease, or disorder. A “prophylactically useful” agent (e.g., nucleic acid or polypeptide) refers to an agent that is useful in preventing development of a disease, pathology, or disorder, or useful in inhibiting or reducing further development or enhancement of a disease, pathology or disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “therapeutic treatment” is a treatment administered to a subject who displays symptoms or signs of pathology, disease, or disorder, in which treatment is administered to the subject for the purpose of diminishing or eliminating those signs or symptoms. A “therapeutic activity” is an activity of an agent that eliminates or diminishes signs or symptoms of pathology, disease or disorder when administered to a subject suffering from such signs or symptoms. A “therapeutically useful” agent means the agent is useful in decreasing, treating, or eliminating signs or symptoms of a disease, pathology, or disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, the nomenclature used herein and many of the laboratory procedures in cell culture, molecular genetics, molecular biology, nucleic acid chemistry, and protein chemistry described below are well known and commonly employed by those of ordinary skill in the art. Standard techniques, such as described in Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning—A Laboratory Manual (2nd Ed.), Vols. 1-3, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989 (hereinafter “Sambrook”) and C\nURRENT \nP\nROTOCOLS IN \nM\nOLECULAR \nB\nIOLOGY\n, F. M. Ausubel et al., eds., Current Protocols, a joint venture between Greene Publishing Associates, Inc. and John Wiley & Sons, Inc. (1994, supplemented through 1999) (hereinafter “Ausubel”), are used for recombinant nucleic acid methods, nucleic acid synthesis, cell culture methods, and transgene incorporation, e.g., electroporation, injection, gene gun, impressing through the skin, and lipofection. Generally, oligonucleotide synthesis and purification steps are performed according to specifications. The techniques and procedures are generally performed according to conventional methods in the art and various general references that are provided throughout this document. The procedures therein are believed to be well known to those of ordinary skill in the art and are provided for the convenience of the reader.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious additional terms are defined or otherwise characterized herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMolecules and Methods of the Invention\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides molecules and methods for treating diseases, disorders, and conditions of the immune system, including, e.g., those in which modulation of the immune system (e.g., T-cell dependent immune responses) is desirable. Molecules of the invention (e.g., polypeptides of the invention, conjugates of the invention, soluble fusion proteins of the invention, nucleic acids encoding such polypeptides or fusion proteins) are useful for the treatment of immune system diseases, disorders, and conditions in which immunosuppression is desirable, including, e.g., but not limited to, the treatment of autoimmune diseases, disorders, and conditions, immunoproliferative diseases, graft-related disorders, and treatment methods involving tissue, cell, organ, or graft transplantation from a donor to a recipient where suppression of an immune response in the recipient against the donor tissue, cell, organ, or graft is desirable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention provides novel mutant CTLA-4 molecules having improved properties compared to a CTLA-4 molecule, such as the wild-type human CTLA-4 polypeptide (“hCTLA-4”) or a fragment thereof that binds CD80 and/or CD86, such as the extracellular domain of human CTLA-4 (“hCTLA-4 ECD”). As discussed in greater detail below, a variety of mutagenesis and screening strategies were used to make and identify novel mutant CTLA-4 molecules that bind CD80 and/or CD86. In particular, such strategies were used to make and identify CTLA-4 mutant molecules having improved binding avidities for CD80 (B7-1) and/or CD86 (B7-2), as compared to human CTLA-4 (“hCTLA-4”), and/or having improved binding affinities for CD80 and/or CD86, as compared to the hCTLA-4 ECD. Mutant CTLA-4 molecules of the invention that bind endogenous CD80 and/or CD86 ligands expressed on antigen-presenting cells effectively inhibit or block the interaction of these ligands with the endogenous CD28 receptor, which is expressed on the surface of T cells. As a result, the costimulatory signal critical for T cell activation provided by the interaction of the T cell surface receptor CD28 with the B7 molecules (i.e., CD80 and CD86) is inhibited or blocked. Such T cells are not optimally activated and have reduced capacities for proliferation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn instances where signaling between a CD80 or CD86 ligand and a CD28 receptor is blocked, T cells are not optimally stimulated to become active and thus are not optimally induced to proliferate. Similarly, in instances where the signaling between a CD80 or CD86 ligand and a CD28 receptor is inhibited, activation and proliferation of T cells is inhibited. In one aspect, the invention provides mutant CTLA-4 molecules that function as antagonists to CTLA-4 signaling. In another aspect, the invention provides mutant CTLA-4 molecules that function as antagonists to CD28 signaling, thereby suppressing or blocking T cell-dependent immune responses; such molecules function as immunosuppressive agents. In yet another aspect, the invention provides mutant CTLA-4 molecules that bind both CD80 and CD86, but which have higher binding avidity for CD86 than for CD80, and therefore inhibit CD86-dependent costimulation to a greater extent than CD80-dependent costimulation. All such mutant CTLA-4 molecules of the invention are expected to be useful for the treatment of diseases, disorders, or conditions in which immunosuppression is desirable or would be of benefit.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA human CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein and a specific mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein—both developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (Princeton, N.J.)—have been shown to be effective in treating certain immune-related diseases or conditions. The Orencia® fusion protein (also known as Abatacept (“ABA”)) (Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (Princeton, N.J.)) is a soluble recombinant dimeric fusion protein consisting of two identical monomeric immunoglobulin (Ig) fusion proteins covalently linked together by a disulfide bond formed between a cysteine residue present in each monomeric fusion protein. ORENCIA is a registered trademark of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. Each monomeric Ig fusion protein of the Orencia® dimer consists of the extracellular domain of human CTLA-4 (SEQ ID NO:159) fused at its C-terminus to the N-terminus of a specific mutant IgG1 Fc polypeptide (SEQ ID NO:186). The complete polypeptide sequence of each such monomeric fusion protein is shown in SEQ ID NO:164. The Orencia® dimer is produced in a mammalian expression system and has an apparent molecule weight of 92 kDa. It is believed that the two monomeric Ig fusion proteins of the Orencia® dimer are covalently linked together by a single disulfide bond formed between the cysteine residue at \nposition\n 120 of each hCTLA-4-mutant IgG1 monomer and that no disulfide bonds are formed between the two mutant IgG1 Fc polypeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Orencia® dimer is a selective costimulation modulator that inhibits T cell activation by binding to CD80 and CD86 and thus blocking interaction with CD28. The Orencia® dimer is currently approved for the treatment of human adults suffering from moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Additional information about the Orencia® dimer and its clinical indications and effectiveness is provided on the worldwide web at orencia.com and bms.com.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs noted above, each fusion protein monomer of the Orencia® dimer contains a human CTLA-4 extracellular domain. Human CTLA-4 is a membrane protein that is transiently expressed on T cells. The full-length protein sequence of WT full-length hCTLA-4 is shown in SEQ ID NO:160, and a nucleic acid sequence encoding WT full-length hCTLA-4 is shown in SEQ ID NO:194. Human CTLA-4 includes a signal peptide (SP), extracellular domain (ECD), transmembrane domain (TD), and cytoplasmic domain (CD, covalently linked together in that order (e.g., the C-terminus of the SP is covalently linked to the N-terminus of the ECD, the C-terminus of the ECD is covalently linked to the N-terminus of the TD, and the C-terminus of the TD is covalently linked to the N-terminus of the CD). The WT hCTLA-4 ECD polypeptide typically comprises residues 38-161 of the full-length hCTLA-4 protein sequence (SEQ ID NO:160) and typically is 124 amino acid residues in length. This hCTLA-4 ECD polypeptide sequence is shown in SEQ ID NO:159. The signal peptide (SP) of the full-length hCTLA-4 protein, which typically comprises amino acid residues 1-35 or 1-37 of SEQ ID NO:160, is cleaved during processing. See, e.g., Harper et al., J. Immunol. 147(3):1037-1044 (1991). The human CTLA-4 signal peptide sequence comprising amino acid residues 1-35 or 1-37 of the hCTLA-4 protein is shown in SEQ ID NO:182 or SEQ ID NO:216, respectively. Whether the signal peptide sequence is that shown in SEQ ID NO:182 or SEQ ID NO:216, when the signal peptide is cleaved, the mature hCTLA-4 protein typically begins with the methionine residue at \namino acid position\n 38 of the full-length hCTLA-4 protein sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:160. Thus, even if the hCTLA-4 signal peptide sequence is that of SEQ ID NO:182, which comprises amino acid residues 1-35 of the hCTLA-4 protein, the resulting mature secreted hCTLA-4 protein begins with the methionine that is at \nposition\n 38 of the full-length hCTLA-4 protein. The lysine (K) and alanine (A) residues at \npositions\n 36 and 37, respectively, of the full-length hCTLA-4 protein are not present in the mature hCTLA-4 protein and are believed to be cleaved from the mature hCTLA-4 protein during processing. The amino acid residues of the mature hCTLA-4 protein sequence thus are typically numbered beginning with the methionine residue present at \nposition\n 38 of the full-length hCTLA-4 protein as the first amino acid (i.e., occupying position 1); accordingly, the histidine residue occupies \namino acid position\n 2 in the mature hCTLA-4 protein, etc. Each monomer of the Orencia® dimer includes the hCTLA-4 ECD polypeptide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:159. In the full-length WT hCTLA-4 protein, the signal peptide comprises amino acid residues 1-37, the extracellular domain (ECD) comprises amino acid residues 38-161, the transmembrane domain (TD) comprises amino acid residues 162-182, and the cytoplasmic domain (CD) comprises amino acid residues 183-223 of SEQ ID NO:160. The mature domain (MD) of the hCTLA-4 protein typically comprises amino acid residues 36-223, or in some instances, amino acid residues 37-223 or 38-223 of SEQ ID NO:160.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nucleic acid of SEQ ID NO:194 comprises a nucleic acid sequence encoding signal peptide sequence (nucleotide residues 1-111), a nucleic acid sequence encoding hCTLA-4 ECD (nucleotide residues 112-483), a nucleic acid sequence encoding the hCTLA-4 transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (nucleotide residues 484-669); the last 3 C-terminal nucleotides are the TGA stop codon.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBelatacept (also known as “LEA29Y-Ig,” “LEA-Ig,” or “A29YL104E-Ig”) (Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (Princeton, N.J.)) is a soluble recombinant dimeric protein composed of two identical Ig fusion proteins covalently linked together by a disulfide bond formed between a cysteine residue in each monomeric fusion protein. Each monomeric fusion protein is composed of a mutant CTLA-4 extracellular domain polypeptide fused at its C-terminus to the N-terminus of a specific mutant IgG1 polypeptide. The polypeptide sequence of the mutant CTLA-4 ECD differs from the polypeptide sequence of WT human CTLA-4 ECD by two mutations, specifically a substitution of a tyrosine for the alanine at position 29 (abbreviated as the substitution A29Y) and a substitution of a glutamine for the leucine at position 104 (abbreviated as the substitution L104E), wherein amino acid residues in the human CTLA-4 ECD are numbered with the methionine at the N-terminus representing the amino acid at \nposition\n 1. Each monomer of Belatacept includes the mutant IgG1 Fc polypeptide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:186; this mutant IgG1 Fc polypeptide is identical to the mutant IgG1 Fc polypeptide included in the Orencia® fusion protein. Belatacept monomeric fusion protein thus differs from each Orencia® monomeric fusion protein by two amino acids. The polypeptide sequence of each such monomeric fusion protein in Belatacept is shown in SEQ ID NO:166. The name “LEA29Y-Ig” thus reflects the fact that each monomeric fusion protein of the Belatacept dimer is composed of a mutant CTLA-4 ECD which differs from the human CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide sequence by two the mutations L104E and A29Y. Belatacept has been shown to bind CD86 about 4 times more avidly and to bind CD80 about 2 times more avidly than the Orencia® dimer (Larson et al., Amer. J. Transplant. 5:443-453, 444 (2005). Belatacept has been shown to be up to about 10 times more potent than the Orencia® dimer in inhibiting T cell activation in vitro and to have improved in vivo immunosuppressive potency compared to the Orencia® protein as shown by its increased ability to inhibit T cell-dependent antibody responses and its improved prolongation of renal allograft survival in clinical trials involving non-human primates. Id. Additional information about Belatacept and its clinical indications and effectiveness is provided on the worldwide web at bms.com.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention provides mutant CTLA-4 molecules, including novel soluble recombinant mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins described herein, which have a binding avidity for CD86 that is greater than the binding avidity of the Orencia® dimer (dimeric hCTLA-4-Ig) for CD86. The invention also provides mutant CTLA-4 molecules, including novel soluble recombinant dimeric mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins, which have a binding avidity for CD80 that is about equal to or greater than the binding avidity of the Orencia® dimer for CD80. In yet another aspect, the invention provides mutant CTLA-4 molecules, including novel soluble recombinant mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins, which have a greater ability to suppress one or more immune responses (e.g., T cell-dependent immune responses) than Orencia® (Abatacept). Mutant CTLA-4 molecules of the invention having one or more improved properties compared to the Orencia® dimer are expected to more potent and thus more effective, useful, and advantageous than the Orencia® dimer in treating diseases, disorders, or conditions in which immunosuppression is desirable, including those diseases, disorders, or conditions for which the Orencia® dimer is approved and/or has been shown to provide clinical benefit, such as autoimmune diseases, including, e.g., rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides mutant CTLA-4 molecules, including novel soluble recombinant mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins described herein, which have a binding avidity for CD86 that is greater than the binding avidity of Belatacept (LEA29Y-Ig) for CD86. The invention also provides mutant CTLA-4 molecules, including novel soluble recombinant mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins described herein, which have a binding avidity for CD86 that is greater than the binding avidity of Belatacept for CD86.

See, e.g., the worldwide website addresses at bms.com and orencia.com. For example, the degree to which a mutant CTLA-4 molecule of the invention (e.g., soluble mutant CTLA-4-Ig) is effective in reducing in subjects having rheumatoid arthritis (RA) the progression of joint damage, in alleviating the signs and symptoms of RA, including pain reduction, can be evaluated using methodologies similar to those employed in the Orencia® clinical trials involving RA patients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and clinical efficacy of a molecule of the invention (e.g., mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide or soluble mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein as described in detail below) in a subject in which immunosuppression is desirable (e.g., a subject undergoing tissue, cell, organ, or graft transplantation from a donor) and to whom a particular dose of the molecule is administered in a particular manner (e.g., parenteral, intravenous, or subcutaneous administration) can be determined using methodologies comparable to those employed in clinical trials for Belatacept involving similar subjects. See, e.g., the worldwide website address bms.com. For example, the degree to which a mutant CTLA-4 molecule of the invention (e.g., soluble mutant CTLA-4-Ig) is effective in reducing in kidney or renal transplant rejection in a recipient patient undergoing kidney or renal transplantation can be evaluated using methodologies similar to those employed in the Belatacept clinical trial involving patients undergoing kidney or renal transplantation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMolecules and methods of the invention and other aspects of the invention are discussed in additional detail below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolypeptides of the Invention\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides novel polypeptides, collectively referred to as “polypeptides of the invention.” The term “polypeptides of the invention” is intended to include variants and/or derivatives of the polypeptide sequences disclosed herein. Polypeptides of the invention include recombinant non-naturally occurring or mutant CTLA-4 polypeptides that bind CD80 and/or CD86 and/or that inhibit or suppress immune responses. Polypeptides of the invention include recombinant fusion proteins comprising a mutant CTLA-4 polypeptide of the invention, and include monomeric and dimer forms of such fusion proteins. Polypeptides of the invention include multimers comprising one or more mutant CTLA-4 polypeptides of the invention. The invention also includes conjugates comprising one or more mutant CTLA-4 polypeptides of the invention. Some polypeptides of the invention are soluble polypeptides. For example, as described in more detail below, the invention includes soluble fusion proteins comprising a mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide linked to a different polypeptide (such as, e.g., an immunoglobulin polypeptide, such as, e.g., an Ig Fc polypeptide) that enhances solubility of the mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs discussed in greater detail below, in one aspect of the invention, a variety of mutagenesis and screening strategies were used to make and identify novel polypeptides that bind CD80 and/or CD86. In particular, such strategies were used to make and identify novel polypeptides having improved abilities to bind CD80 and/or CD86, including novel mutant CTLA-4 polypeptides having improved binding affinities or avidities for CD80 and/or CD86. Polypeptides of the invention that bind CD80 and/or CD86 ligands expressed on antigen-presenting cells interfere with or block the interaction of these ligands with the CD28 receptors expressed on T cells. As a result, the T cell costimulatory signal provided by the interaction of the T cell surface receptor CD28 with the B7 molecules (i.e., CD80 and CD86) is inhibited or blocked. Such polypeptides are believed useful in the prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of diseases, disorders, and conditions in which modulation of the immune system (e.g., T cell responses) is of benefit.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMutant CTLA-4 Polypeptides\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention provides isolated or recombinant polypeptides which each comprise a polypeptide sequence that has at least 75%, 80%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 90.5%, 91%, 91.5%, 92%, 92.5%, 93%, 93.5%, 94%, 94.5%, 95%, 95.5%, 96%, 96.5%, 97%, 97.5%, 98%, 98.5%, 99%, 99.5%, or 100% sequence identity to at least one polypeptide sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS:1-73 (e.g., SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO:2, SEQ ID NO:3, SEQ ID NO:4, SEQ ID NO:5, SEQ ID NO:6, SEQ ID NO:7, SEQ ID NO:8, SEQ ID NO:9, SEQ ID NO:10, SEQ ID NO:11, SEQ ID NO:12, SEQ ID NO:13, SEQ ID NO:14, SEQ ID NO:15, SEQ ID NO:16, SEQ ID NO:17, SEQ ID NO:18, SEQ ID NO:19, SEQ ID NO:20, SEQ ID NO:21, SEQ ID NO:22, SEQ ID NO:23, SEQ ID NO:24, SEQ ID NO:25, SEQ ID NO:26, SEQ ID NO:27, SEQ ID NO:28, SEQ ID NO:29, SEQ ID NO:30, SEQ ID NO:31, SEQ ID NO:32, SEQ ID NO:33, SEQ ID NO:34, SEQ ID NO:35, SEQ ID NO:36, SEQ ID NO:37, SEQ ID NO:38, SEQ ID NO:39, SEQ ID NO:40, SEQ ID NO:41, SEQ ID NO:42, SEQ ID NO:43, SEQ ID NO:44, SEQ ID NO:45, SEQ ID NO:46, SEQ ID NO:47, SEQ ID NO:48, SEQ ID NO:49, SEQ ID NO:50, SEQ ID NO:51, SEQ ID NO:52, SEQ ID NO:53, SEQ ID NO:54, SEQ ID NO:55, SEQ ID NO:56, SEQ ID NO:57, SEQ ID NO:58, SEQ ID NO:59, SEQ ID NO:60, SEQ ID NO:61, SEQ ID NO:62, SEQ ID NO:63, SEQ ID NO:64, SEQ ID NO:65, SEQ ID NO:66, SEQ ID NO:67, SEQ ID NO:68, SEQ ID NO:69, SEQ ID NO:70, SEQ ID NO:71, SEQ ID NO:72, and SEQ ID NO:73), wherein the polypeptide binds CD80 and/or CD86 or a polypeptide fragment of CD80 and/or CD86 (or an ECD of either or both), and/or modulate or regulate an immune response. Some such polypeptides, such as each of those set forth in SEQ ID NOS:1-73, are described as secreted or mature mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptides. The mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptides set forth in each of SEQ ID NO:1-73 do not include a signal peptide; it has been cleaved during processing, thereby producing the mature or secreted polypeptide. A polypeptide fragment of CD80 may comprise, e.g., an extracellular domain polypeptide of a CD80 polypeptide, such as, e.g., human CD80 ECD polypeptide (“hCD80 ECD”). A polypeptide fragment of CD86 may comprise, e.g., an extracellular domain polypeptide of a CD86 polypeptide, such as, e.g., human CD86 ECD polypeptide (“hCD86 ECD”). Some such polypeptides bind a mammalian CD80 and/or CD86 or polypeptide fragment thereof, such as, e.g., a mammalian CD80 or CD86 ECD. Some such polypeptides bind WT human CD80 (“hCD80”) and/or WT human CD86 (“hCD86”) or a polypeptide fragment thereof, such as, e.g., hCD80 ECD or hCD86 ECD. In some such methods, at least one immune response is suppressed or inhibited.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome such polypeptides have a binding affinity or avidity for hCD80 or a fragment thereof (e.g., hCD80 ECD) that is at least about equal to or greater than the binding affinity or avidity of the hCTLA-4 ECD polypeptide for hCD80 or a fragment thereof, respectively. The predicted full-length hCD80 polypeptide sequence, which includes a signal peptide, ECD, transmembrane domain, and cytoplasmic domain covalently linked together in that order, is set forth in SEQ ID NO:195. The signal peptide comprises amino acid residues 1-34, the ECD comprises amino acid residues 35-242, the transmembrane domain comprises amino acid residues 243-263, and the cytoplasmic domain comprises amino acid residues 264-288 of SEQ ID NO:195. The polypeptide sequence of the hCD80 ECD is shown in SEQ ID NO:174. The nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:173 encodes the WT human CD80 signal peptide (at N-terminus) and human CD80 ECD.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome such polypeptides have a binding affinity or avidity for hCD86 or a fragment thereof (e.g., hCD86 ECD) that is at least about equal to or greater than the binding affinity or avidity of the hCTLA-4 ECD polypeptide for hCD86 or a fragment thereof (e.g., ECD), respectively. The predicted full-length hCD86 polypeptide sequence, which includes a signal peptide, ECD, transmembrane domain, and cytoplasmic domain covalently linked together in that order, is set forth in SEQ ID NO:175, and an exemplary nucleic acid encoding the predicted full-length hCD86 polypeptide sequence is shown in SEQ ID NO:176. The polypeptide sequence of the hCD86 ECD is shown in SEQ ID NO:180. Some such polypeptides have a binding affinity or avidity for hCD86 that is at least about equal to or greater than the binding affinity or avidity of the LEA29Y ECD polypeptide having the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:168 for hCD86. Exemplary polypeptides of the invention that have binding affinities or binding avidities for hCD86 or hCD86 ECD that are at least equal to or greater than those of hCTLA-4 ECD and LEA29Y ECD (also termed “A29YL104E” or “L104EA29Y” ECD) for hCD86 or hCD86 ECD, respectively, include, e.g., but are not limited to, those comprising a polypeptide sequence having at least 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100% sequence identity to the sequence of any of SEQ ID NOS:4, 10-12, 15, 17, 24, 26, 28, 35, and 61. See, e.g., Table 5 in Example 4. The data presented in Table 5 reflect a monomeric interaction between a representative CTLA-4-Ig and monomeric CD86 ECD. The term LEA29Y (or A29YL104E or L104EA29Y), if not otherwise indicated, refers to LEA29Y ECD (or A29YL104E or L104EA29Y ECD).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome such polypeptides comprise a polypeptide sequence having an amino acid length about equal to the amino acid length of the human CTLA-4 extracellular domain. Such polypeptides may be described as mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptides. Some such mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptides comprise a polypeptide sequence that is about 110 amino acids to about 138 amino acid residues, about 112 to about 136 amino acid residues, about 114 to about 134 amino acid residues, about 116 to about 132 amino acid residues, about 118 to about 130 amino acid residues, about 119 to about 129 amino acid residues, about 120 to about 128 amino acid residues, about 121 to about 127 amino acid residues, about 122 to about 126 amino acid residues, about 123 to about 125 amino acid residues in length. Some such mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptides comprise a sequence that is 124 amino acid residues in length. Exemplary polypeptides include, e.g., but are not limited to, a polypeptide comprising a polypeptide sequence having at least 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100% sequence identity to at least one polypeptide sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS:1-73, wherein such polypeptide binds CD80 and/or CD86 (or an ECD of either or both).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome such polypeptides described above, including, e.g., those isolated or recombinant polypeptides which each comprising a polypeptide sequence having at least 75%, 80%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.5%, or 100% sequence identity to at least one polypeptide sequence selected from the group of SEQ ID NOS:1-73 and which bind CD80 and/or CD86 and/or an ECD thereof, have an ability to modulate or regulate an immune response. One or more of a variety of immune responses may be modulated or regulated by such polypeptides of the invention, including, but not limited to, e.g., T cell activation or proliferation, cytokine synthesis or production (e.g., production of TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-2, etc.), induction of various activation markers (e.g., CD25, IL-2 receptor, etc.), synthesis or production of inflammatory molecules, inflammation, joint swelling, joint tenderness, pain, stiffness, serum levels of C-reactive protein, anti-collagen antibody production, and/or T cell-dependent antibody response(s)). In some instances, such a polypeptide has a greater ability to suppress or inhibit at least one such immune response than hCTLA-4 or hCTLA-4 ECD.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, some such polypeptides are capable of inhibiting T cell activation or T cell proliferation in in vitro assays. Examples 4-9 set forth below, for example, demonstrate the ability of representative fusion proteins of the invention comprising a representative mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide sequence, such as those described herein, to inhibit T cell proliferation in vitro. Some such polypeptides are capable of inhibiting or suppressing an immune response in a subject in vivo, such as through the administration of a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of at least one such polypeptide to a subject needing immunosuppressive therapy. Some such polypeptides are expected to be useful in a variety of applications, including, e.g., but not limited to, prophylactic and/or therapeutic methods for treating immune system diseases, disorders, and conditions in which immunomodulation is desirable, as discussed in greater detail infra. Such polypeptides are expected to be useful in prophylactic and/or therapeutic methods for inhibiting or suppressing an immune response in a subject (e.g., in the in vivo treatment of immune system diseases or disorders of mammals, such as e.g., humans, in which immunoinhibition or immunosuppression is desirable), methods for inhibiting rejection of a tissue or organ transplant from a donor by a recipient (e.g., by a mammal, such as, e.g., a human), and other methods described elsewhere herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally or alternatively, some such polypeptides have an ability to suppress or inhibit an immune response that is at least about equal to or greater than the ability of hCTLA-4 or hCTLA-4 ECD to suppress or inhibit one or more types of immune responses. For example, some such polypeptides have an ability to inhibit T cell activation or proliferation in in vitro and/or in vivo assays and/or applications, such as those described above and in greater detail below, which is at least about equal to or greater than the ability of hCTLA-4 or hCTLA-4 ECD to inhibit T cell activation or proliferation in such applications. Additionally, some such polypeptides have an ability to inhibit or suppress an immune response (e.g., T cell activation or proliferation, cytokine production, T cell-dependent antibody response) that is greater than the ability of a LEA29Y polypeptide—a specific mutant CTLA-4 ECD comprising the polypeptide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:168—to inhibit or suppress an immune response. Examples 4-9 set forth below, for example, compare the ability of representative fusion proteins of the invention comprising a mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide sequence of the invention to inhibit T cell proliferation in vitro relative to the ability of a fusion protein comprising the hCTLA-4 ECD or LEA29Y polypeptide to inhibit T cell proliferation in vitro. Such molecules are expected to be of beneficial use in a variety of therapeutic applications, including treatment of autoimmune diseases and disorders, and prophylactic and therapeutic methods for inhibiting rejection of organ, cell, or tissue graft transplantation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome such polypeptides may differ from one another by, e.g., an amino acid deletion, addition and/or substitution. An amino acid substitution may be a conservative or non-conservative substitution. See, e.g., the section entitled “Sequence Variation.”\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention also provides isolated or recombinant polypeptides which each comprise a polypeptide sequence having at least 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% sequence identity to at least one polypeptide sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS:1-73, wherein the polypeptide binds a monomeric hCD80 or monomeric hCD86 or an ECD of either or both. Some such polypeptides have (1) a binding affinity for monomeric hCD86 that is about equal to or greater than the binding affinity of monomeric hCTLA-4 or an LEA29Y polypeptide for monomeric hCD86 or an ECD thereof, and (2) a binding affinity for monomeric hCD80 that is about equal to or greater than the binding affinity of monomeric hCTLA-4 for monomeric hCD80. The LEA29Y polypeptide comprises the polypeptide sequence of SEQ ID NO:168. Further, some such polypeptides have a greater ability to suppress one or more immune responses described herein (e.g., T cell activation/proliferation, cytokine synthesis/production, induction of activation markers, production of inflammatory molecules, inflammation, anti-collagen Ab production, T cell-dependent Ab response) than monomeric hCTLA-4, monomeric hCTLA-4 ECD, or LEA29Y polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides isolated or recombinant polypeptides which each comprise a polypeptide sequence having at least 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% sequence identity to at least one polypeptide sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS:1-73, wherein the polypeptide has a binding affinity for a hCD86 ECD or hCD80 ECD that is about equal to or greater than the binding affinity of a hCTLA-4 ECD for the hCD86 ECD or hCD80 ECD, respectively. Some such polypeptides have a binding affinity for the hCD86 ECD that is greater than the binding affinity of the hCTLA-4 ECD (SEQ ID NO:159) or the LEA29Y polypeptide (SEQ ID NO:168) for the hCD86 ECD. Some such polypeptides have a binding affinity for the hCD80 ECD that is greater than the binding affinity of the hCTLA-4 ECD for the hCD80 ECD.

Such a multimer comprises at least one polypeptide of the invention and may further comprise at least one additional polypeptide that need not be a polypeptide of the invention. For example, the multimer may comprise at least one polypeptide of the invention and at least one other polypeptide which may be, e.g., a wild-type polypeptide (e.g., hCTLA-4 ECD or hCTLA-4-Ig) and/or at least other mutant polypeptide (such as a mutant polypeptide that is not a polypeptide of the invention). Some or all of the polypeptides in the multimer (or multimeric polypeptide) may be identical to one another, or, in some instances, all polypeptides in the multimer may be different from one another. In some instances, the polypeptide multimer is a dimer comprising two polypeptides of the invention, which optionally may be identical polypeptides (i.e., homodimer) or different polypeptides (i.e., heterodimer). In some instances, the polypeptide multimer is a tetramer comprising four polypeptides of the invention. The tetramer can comprise four identical polypeptides (i.e., homotetramer) or any combination of four polypeptides of the invention such that at least one polypeptide is not identical to the other three polypeptides (i.e., heterotetramer). The invention also includes a tetramer comprising four identical WT CTLA-4 ECD polypeptides (e.g., hCTLA-4 ECD) or four identical WT CTLA-4-Ig (e.g., hCTLA-4-Ig). In some instances, the multimer is capable of binding CD80 and/or CD86 (or an ECD of either or both) and/or suppressing or inhibiting an immune response in in vitro and/or in vivo methods (e.g., T cell proliferation or activation, cytokine production, etc.). Some such multimers have a greater ability to suppress or inhibit an immune response in vitro and/or in vivo than hCTLA-4 or hCTLA-4-Ig (e.g., hCTLA-4-IgG2 or Orencia® protein). The polypeptides of the multimers may be linked together, such as by covalent linkages, such as via disulfide bonds between one or more cysteine residues in the one or more polypeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome such tetramers of the invention comprise a structure schematically similar to that of an antibody, but in which the variable domains of the antibody are each replaced with any mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide of the invention described herein. The heavy chain of an antibody comprises a heavy chain variable domain (V\nH\n) fused to an immunoglobulin (Ig) CH1 domain (e.g., IgG2 CH1), which is fused to a hinge. The hinge is fused to an Ig CH2 domain (e.g., IgG2 CH2), which is fused to an Ig CH3 domain (e.g., IgG2 CH3). The light chain of an antibody comprises a light chain variable domain (V\nL\n) fused to an Ig C kappa (C\nκ\n) or C lambda (C\nλ\n) domain. Two heavy chains and two light chains are covalently linked together by one or more disulfide bonds formed via cysteine residues in the heavy and light chains. The invention includes a mutant CTLA-4 tetramer in which each of the variable domains of the heavy and light chains is replaced with a mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide of the invention. Thus, such tetramer comprises two light chains and two heavy chains. Each light chain comprises a mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide fused to an Ig C\nκ\n or C\nλ\n domain. Each heavy chain comprises a mutant CTLA-4 ECD fused to an Ig CH1 domain (e.g., IgG2 CH1), which is fused to a hinge. The hinge is fused to an Ig CH2 domain (e.g., IgG2 CH2), which is fused to an Ig CH3 domain (e.g., IgG2 CH3). The two heavy chains and two light chains are covalently linked together by one or more disulfide bonds formed via cysteine residues in the heavy and light chains. Such tetramer may be described as a CTLA-4-Ig tetramer. Methods for constructing such CTLA-4-Ig tetramer are known and would be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art. A tetrameric CD4-Ig construct, which comprises a CD4 polypeptide and which neutralizes \nprimary HIV type\n 1 isolates, is described in Allaway, G. P. et al., AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses 11(5):533-9 (1995). The tetramer can comprise four identical four mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptides or any combination of four mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptides of the invention such that at least one mutant CTLA-4 ECD is not identical to the other three mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptides. Some such tetramers are capable of binding CD80 and/CD86 with a higher binding avidity than hCTLA-4 (or hCTLA-4-Ig). Some such tetramers are capable of suppressing or inhibiting an immune response; in some instances, such a tetramer has a greater ability to suppress or inhibit an immune response in in vitro assays or in vivo applications (e.g., T cell proliferation or activation, cytokine production, etc) than hCTLA-4 or hCTLA-4-Ig (e.g., hCTLA-4-IgG2 or Orencia®). Multimers of the invention are expected to be of beneficial use in a variety of applications, including methods for treating autoimmune diseases and disorders, and methods for inhibiting organ, cell, or tissue graft transplantation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also includes an isolated or recombinant conjugate multimers comprising two or more conjugates, wherein at least one of the conjugates is a conjugate of the invention which comprises a mutant CTLA-4 polypeptide of the invention (e.g., a mutant CTLA-4 ECD or mutant CTLA-4-Ig). Some or all of the conjugates in the multimer may be identical to one another, or all conjugates in the multimer may be different from one another. In some instances, the conjugate multimer is a dimer comprising two conjugates or a tetramer comprising four conjugates of the invention. Some such conjugate multimers are capable of binding CD80 and/CD86 (or an ECD of either or both) and/or suppressing or inhibiting an immune response in vitro and/or in vivo. Conjugate molecules in multimers may be linked together, such as by covalent linkages, such as via disulfide bonds between one or more cysteine residues in the one or more conjugates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention includes an isolated or recombinant polypeptide dimer comprising any two polypeptides of the invention described above (e.g., mutant CTLA-4 ECD described above), wherein the dimer has a binding avidity for human CD86 or an extracellular domain thereof that is about equal to or greater than the binding avidity of a dimer comprising two human CTLA-4 extracellular domains for human CD86 or an extracellular domain thereof, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention includes isolated or recombinant polypeptide dimers comprising two polypeptides of the invention described above (e.g., mutant CTLA-4 ECD described above), wherein the dimer has a binding avidity for hCD80 or an ECD thereof that is about equal to or greater than the binding avidity of a dimer comprising two hCTLA-4 ECD polypeptides (SEQ ID NO:159) for hCD80 or an ECD thereof, respectively. For example, in a non-limiting aspect, the dimer may comprise two polypeptides, wherein each polypeptide comprises a polypeptide sequence having at least 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% identity to a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS:1-73, and each polypeptide binds hCD80 and/or hCD86 and/or inhibits an immune response. In another non-limiting aspect, the dimer may comprise two polypeptides, wherein each polypeptide differs from the polypeptide sequence of the hCTLA-4 ECD (SEQ ID NO:159) in no more than 6 amino acid residues and comprises at least one substitution at an amino acid position relative to SEQ ID NO:159 selected from the group consisting of A50M, M54K, G55E, N56D, S64P, I65S, and S70F; and which polypeptide optionally further comprises the substitution L104E, and each polypeptide binds hCD80 and/or hCD86 and/or inhibits an immune response.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some instances, the dimer has a binding avidity for hCD80 or an ECD thereof that is about equal to or greater than the binding avidity of a dimer comprising two hCTLA-4 ECD polypeptides for hCD80 or an ECD thereof, respectively. In some instances, the dimer has a binding avidity for hCD86 or an ECD thereof that is greater than the binding avidity of a dimer comprising two LEA29Y polypeptides for hCD86 or an ECD thereof, respectively, wherein each LEA29Y polypeptide comprises the polypeptide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:168. In some instances, the dimer dissociates from binding hCD86 or an ECD thereof at a rate that is less than the rate at which a dimer comprising two hCTLA-4 ECD polypeptides dissociates from binding hCD86 or an ECD thereof, respectively. In some instances, the dimer dissociates from binding hCD86 or an ECD thereof at a rate that is less than the rate at which a dimer comprising two LEA29Y polypeptides dissociates from binding hCD86 or an ECD thereof, respectively, wherein each LEA29Y polypeptide comprises the polypeptide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:168.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some instances, the dimer associates with hCD86 or an ECD thereof at a rate that is greater than the rate at which a dimer comprising two hCTLA-4 ECD polypeptides associates with hCD86 or an ECD thereof, respectively. In some instances, the dimer associates with hCD86 or an ECD thereof at a rate that is greater than the rate at which a dimer comprising two LEA29Y polypeptides associates with hCD86 or an ECD thereof, respectively, wherein each LEA29Y polypeptide comprises the polypeptide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:168.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some instances, such dimer comprising a mutant CTLA-4 ECD has a greater ability to suppress an immune response (e.g., T cell activation or proliferation, cytokine production, etc.) than a dimer comprising two human CTLA-4 extracellular domains or two LEA29Y polypeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome such dimers have a CD86 equilibrium dissociation constant (K\nD\n) that is less than the CD86 equilibrium dissociation constant (K\nD\n) of a dimer comprising two hCTLA-4 ECD polypeptides or two LEA29Y polypeptides. Some such dimers have a CD86 equilibrium dissociation constant (K\nD\n) that is less than the CD86 equilibrium dissociation constant (K\nD\n) of a dimer comprising two LEA29Y polypeptides, each LEA29Y polypeptide comprising the polypeptide sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:168.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome such multimers comprising at least two polypeptides of the invention (e.g., a dimer comprising two mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptides of the invention) have an enhanced ability to suppress an immune response compared to a multimer of full-length hCTLA-4 of the same valency (i.e., a multimer comprising the same number of full-length CTLA-4 polypeptides). Some such multimers comprising at least two polypeptides of the invention have an enhanced ability to suppress an immune response compared to a multimer of hCTLA-4 ECCD of the same valency (i.e., a multimer comprising the same number of hCTLA-4 ECD polypeptides).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny polypeptide of the invention described above may further comprise an additional polypeptide sequence that enhances solubility, such as an immunoglobulin (Ig) polypeptide sequence, thereby forming, e.g., a soluble fusion protein, as discussed in greater detail infra. Each polypeptide of a polypeptide multimer may further comprise an additional polypeptide sequence that enhances solubility, such as an Ig polypeptide sequence, thereby forming, e.g., a soluble fusion protein. Thus, for example, each polypeptide of a dimer comprising two or more polypeptides of the invention, as described above, may further comprise an additional polypeptide sequence that enhances solubility, such as an Ig polypeptide sequence, thereby forming, e.g., a soluble fusion protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch polypeptides and dimers of the invention are expected to be of beneficial use in a variety of applications, including methods for treating autoimmune diseases and disorders, and methods for inhibiting organ, cell, or tissue graft transplantation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs discussed previously, the mature hCTLA-4 protein sequence typically begins with the methionine residue at \namino acid position\n 38 of the full-length hCTLA-4 protein sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:160, and the amino acid residues of the mature hCTLA-4 protein sequence are typically numbered beginning with this methionine residue as the first amino acid (i.e., occupying amino acid position 1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome mutant CTLA-4 polypeptides of the invention (including monomeric and dimeric fusion proteins and multimeric polypeptides) include at least one amino acid substitution at an amino acid position corresponding to an amino acid position in the mature hCTLA-4 protein sequence that is outside the classical hCTLA-4/hB7-2 binding interface (see, e.g., Schwartz et al., Nature 410:604-608 (2001)), including, but not limited to, for example, any of amino acid positions 24, 41, 54, 55, 56, 64, 65, 70, and 85. In general, one of ordinary skill in the art would not have predicted that an amino acid substitution at any of the above-mentioned positions (24, 41, 54, 55, 56, 64, 65, 70, and/or 85) or any combination of one or more substitutions selected from the group of \n \n \npositions\n \n \n 24, 41, 54, 55, 56, 64, 65, 70, and 85 would have an ability to enhance the binding affinity or avidity of hCTLA-4 for hB7-2, would have an enhanced ability to inhibit the interaction of CD28-positive with B7-2-positive cells, or would provide a greater ability to suppress or inhibit an immune response than, e.g., hCTLA-4 ECD or hCTLA-4-Ig (e.g., T cell activation or proliferation, cytokine synthesis or production, induction of activation markers, synthesis or production of inflammatory molecules, anti-collagen antibody production, T cell-dependent antibody response, and the like). Further, one of ordinary skill in the art would not have predicted that a particular amino acid substitution(s) or combination of particular amino acid substitutions described herein at any of the above-mentioned positions (24, 41, 54, 55, 56, 64, 65, 70, and/or 85) or any combination of such positions would have ability to enhance the binding affinity or avidity of hCTLA-4 for hB7-2, have an enhanced ability to inhibit the interaction of CD28-positive with B7-2-positive cells, or provide a greater ability to suppress or inhibit an immune response than, e.g., hCTLA-4 ECD or hCTLA-4-Ig.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMutant CTLA-4 Fusion Proteins\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides novel isolated and recombinant fusion proteins which comprise a first polypeptide that is at least one of the polypeptides of the invention described above and throughout (such as a mutant CTLA-4 polypeptide of the invention, such as, e.g., a mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide) linked or fused to a second polypeptide, thereby forming a fusion protein. The second polypeptide typically facilitates secretion or expression of the first polypeptide. Exemplary mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptides include those comprising sequences identified as SEQ ID NOS:1-73. The invention includes fusion proteins comprising immunoglobulin (Ig) domains, such as Ig Fc domains, fused or attached to biological active moieties of the invention, such as mutant CTLA-4 polypeptides of the invention. Fusion proteins of the invention are believed useful as prophylactic and/or therapeutic agents for the prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatment of a variety of immune system diseases and disorders and conditions in immunomodulation and/or immunosuppression is of benefit, in diagnostic assays, and for the preparation of medicaments or agents having immunomodulating and/or immunosuppressive activities or properties as discussed in greater detail elsewhere herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFusion proteins of the invention comprising a mutant CTLA-4 polypeptide and an Ig polypeptide (e.g., Ig Fc) are typically termed mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins. Any of the fusion proteins of the invention, including monomeric and dimeric fusion proteins of the invention described in greater detail below and in the Examples, may comprise as Ig polypeptide, such as, e.g., an Ig Fc polypeptide, as described herein and elsewhere above and below. The second polypeptide may be linked directly to the first polypeptide. For example, the N-terminus of the second polypeptide (e.g., an Ig polypeptide, such as an Ig Fc polypeptide) may be covalently fused directly to the C-terminus of the first polypeptide of the invention (e.g., mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide). Alternatively, the second polypeptide may be linked indirectly to the first polypeptide, such as where a linker amino acid sequence comprising 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 or more amino acid residues is included between the first and second polypeptides. In instances in which a linker is included, the N-terminus of the amino acid linker sequence is typically covalently fused to the C-terminus of the first polypeptide (e.g., mutant CTLA-4 ECD), and the N-terminus of the second polypeptide (e.g., an Ig polypeptide, such as an Ig Fc) is typically covalently fused to the C-terminus of the amino acid linker sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some instances, the second polypeptide comprises at least a portion of an Ig polypeptide, such as, e.g., one or more domains of an Ig heavy chain constant region. The second polypeptide may comprise as a hinge region, CH2 domain, and CH3 domain of an Ig polypeptide. In some instances, the second polypeptide comprises an Fc domain of a WT Ig polypeptide (i.e., WT Ig Fc polypeptide), such as, e.g., an Fc domain of a WT human Ig polypeptide (i.e., WT human Ig Fc polypeptide). As discussed elsewhere, the Ig polypeptide may be from various species, including, e.g., mammal, e.g., human, mouse, non-human primate (e.g., monkey, gorilla), cat, dog, horse, etc., and can be from various classes (e.g., IgG, IgM, IgE, etc.) and subclasses (e.g., for IgG include IgG1, IgG2, IgG4, etc.), and may comprise an Fc domain or portion of any such Ig polypeptide. The amino acid and nucleic acid sequences of Ig polypeptides of such various species are known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention provides novel isolated or recombinant fusion proteins which each comprise an isolated or recombinant mutant CTLA-4 polypeptide of the invention described above (e.g., mutant CTLA-4 ECD) covalently linked or fused, either directly or indirectly (via an amino acid linker sequence), at its C-terminus to the N-terminus of an Ig Fc polypeptide, i.e., the Fc domain of an Ig polypeptide. Any of the fusion proteins of the invention, including monomeric and dimeric mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins of the invention described in greater detail below and in the Examples, may comprise as Ig Fc polypeptide as described herein and elsewhere above and below. An Ig Fc polypeptide typically comprises the hinge region, CH2 domain and CH3 domain of the Ig polypeptide. The Ig Fc polypeptide may be derived from various species, including, e.g., human, mouse, primate, etc., and may comprise a wild-type Ig Fc polypeptide (e.g., WT IgG1, IgG2, or IgG4). Exemplary human IgG Fc polypeptides include, e.g., but are not limited to, human IgG1, human IgG2, human IgG4, etc. The polypeptide sequence of exemplary human IgG1 Fc is set forth in SEQ ID NO:185. The polypeptide sequences of exemplary human IgG2 Fc polypeptides are set forth in SEQ ID NOS:184 and 218, respectively. Alternatively, the Ig Fc polypeptide may comprise a mutant Ig polypeptide. For example, a mutant IgG1 Fc in which one or more cysteine residues have been substituted with another amino acid (e.g., a serine residue), thereby eliminating one or more disulfide bonds formed between two Ig chains, or in which one or more proline residues is substituted with another amino acid (e.g., proline) to reduce effector function (reduced Fc receptor binding), may be included in a mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein. The polypeptide sequence of an exemplary mutant IgG1 Fc polypeptide is shown in SEQ ID NO:186. The invention includes an isolated or recombinant fusion protein, such as a mutant CTLA-4-Ig dimer or mutant CTLA-4-Ig monomer, which comprises at least one recombinant mutant CTLA-4 polypeptide described above linked at its C-terminus to the N-terminus of a recombinant Ig Fc polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence having at least 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% identity to an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS:184 (human IgG2 Fc polypeptide), 185 (human IgG1 Fc polypeptide), 186 (mutant IgG1 Fc polypeptide), and 218 (human IgG2 Fc polypeptide without C-terminal lysine (K) residue).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the predicted polypeptide sequence of a mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein of the invention comprises the following segments: a signal peptide sequence which facilitates secretion of the fusion protein (e.g., hCTLA-4 signal peptide (SEQ ID NO:182 or SEQ ID NO:216)); a mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide, which mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide typically, but not necessarily, comprises from about 118 to 130 amino acid residues, and usually about 124 amino acid residues in length; and an Ig Fc polypeptide. Exemplary mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptides include those described above and below. In some instances, no amino acid linker sequence is included between the C-terminus of the mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide and the N-terminus of the human Ig Fc polypeptide; that is, the C-terminus of a mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide is covalently fused directly to the N-terminus of the Ig Fc polypeptide in the mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein. If desired, however, a mutant CTLA-4-Ig may include a linker (e.g., one or more amino acid residues) between the C-terminus of the mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide and the N-terminus of the human Ig Fc polypeptide. The signal peptide of a predicted monomeric mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein of the invention is typically cleaved from the N-terminus of the mutant CTLA-4 Ig fusion protein during processing and thus the mature or secreted form of a mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein of the invention does not usually include a signal peptide sequence. A fusion protein dimer comprising two such monomeric mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins is typically formed during cellular processing by the creation of covalent disulfide bonds between (1) cysteine residues in the mutant CTLA-4 ECD and IgG2 Fc of one such monomeric fusion protein and (2) cysteine residues in the mutant CTLA-4 ECD and IgG2 Fc of the second (typically, but not necessarily identical) monomeric fusion protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention includes dimeric fusion proteins (also termed fusion protein dimer) which each comprise two monomeric fusion proteins of the invention. The dimer may comprise two identical or different monomeric fusion proteins. The dimeric fusion protein is formed by a linkage(s) between the two monomeric fusion proteins. A dimeric fusion protein comprising two such monomeric fusion proteins is typically formed during cellular processing by the generation of covalent disulfide bonds between cysteine residues in one monomeric fusion protein and cysteine residues in the second monomeric fusion protein. Thus, in some instances, a mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein of the invention is expressed as a dimer comprising two monomeric fusion proteins of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention provides an isolated or recombinant dimeric mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein comprising two monomeric fusion proteins, wherein each monomeric fusion protein comprises a mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide of the invention, as described in detail above and further below, fused at its C-terminus to an Ig Fc polypeptide. The dimer is formed during cellular processing by the generation of covalent disulfide bonds between cysteine residues in the mutant CTLA-4 ECD and Ig Fc of one monomeric fusion protein and cysteine residues in the mutant CTLA-4 ECD and Ig Fc of the second monomeric fusion protein. The two monomeric fusion proteins typically, but not necessarily, comprise identical sequences. The secreted or mature form of a mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein does not include a signal peptide, as the signal peptide is typically cleaved from the N-terminus of the protein during processing. The predicted mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion includes a signal peptide, the C-terminus of which is typically covalently linked to the N-terminus of the mutant CTLA-4-Ig protein. The N-terminus of each monomer of a mature mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein typically comprises a methionine (M).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a non-limiting example, the invention provides dimeric fusion proteins comprising two monomeric CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins, wherein each monomeric mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein comprises a mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide linked at its C-terminus to the N-terminus of an Ig Fc polypeptide, wherein the mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide comprises a polypeptide sequence selected from any of SEQ ID NOS:1-73. In some such dimeric fusion proteins, the two monomeric fusion proteins are covalently linked together by a covalent disulfide bond formed during cellular processing between a cysteine residue at \nposition\n 120 in each CTLA-4 mutant ECD polypeptide sequence. Alternatively, or in addition, the two monomeric fusion proteins are covalently linked together by a covalent disulfide bond formed between one or more cysteine residues in the Ig Fc polypeptide of the first monomeric fusion protein and one or more cysteine residues in the Ig Fc polypeptide of the second monomeric fusion protein. The monomeric fusion proteins may be linked together by multiple disulfide bonds (e.g., one, two, three, four, or more disulfide bonds) formed during cellular processing between cysteine residues present in their respective Ig Fc polypeptides. In some instances, each monomeric fusion protein is comprised of the same Ig Fc polypeptide (e.g., human IgG2 Fc, as shown in, e.g., SEQ ID NO:184 or 218), and covalent disulfide bond(s) may be generated during cellular processing between cysteine residues at equivalent positions in each Ig Fc polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn exemplary mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide is the D3-12 mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide comprising the polypeptide sequence of SEQ ID NO:11. An exemplary mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein of the invention is the D3-12 mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide covalently linked or fused directly (no linker) at its C-terminus to the N-terminus of the human IgG2 Fc polypeptide shown in SEQ ID NO:218, thereby forming the D3-12-IgG2 fusion protein shown in SEQ ID NO:205, or covalently linked or fused directly (no linker) at its C-terminus to the N-terminus of the human IgG2 Fc polypeptide shown in SEQ ID NO:184, thereby forming the D3-12-IgG2 fusion protein shown in SEQ ID NO:74. The sequence of SEQ ID NO:74 differs from that of SEQ ID NO:205 by one residue—i.e., an additional lysine residue is present at the C-terminus of SEQ ID NO:74. We have found experimentally by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS) analysis, or the like, that a mature CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein made in CHO cells by transfecting an expression vector comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a mutant CTLA-4 ECD, such as, e.g., the D3-12 ECD polypeptide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:11, and the hIgG2 Fc polypeptide shown in SEQ ID NO:184 does not typically include the predicted C-terminal lysine (K) residue, as would be expected based on the hIgG2 Fc sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:184.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:153 encodes the hCTLA-4 signal peptide and D3-12-IgG2 fusion protein and includes the stop codon TAA at its C-terminus. The codon AAA, which codes for a lysine residue, immediately precedes the stop codon TAA in the sequence of SEQ ID NO:153. The predicted polypeptide sequence of a mature D3-12-IgG2 fusion protein produced by transfecting an expression vector comprising the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:153 into CHO cells is shown in SEQ ID NO:74. The signal peptide is absent in the mature form of the D3-12-IgG2 fusion protein, as it has been cleaved during processing to form the mature fusion protein. However, we have found, based on LCMS analysis, that in such instance the mature D3-12-IgG2 does not typically include the predicted C-terminal lysine residue, as would be expected based on the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:153. Rather, the resulting mature D3-12-IgG2 polypeptide sequence produced by such method is that shown in SEQ ID NO:205. The C-terminal lysine of the IgG2 Fc polypeptide is believed to be cleaved during processing or prior to secretion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is believed that production of D3-12-IgG2 protein using another mammalian cell line by transfection of such vector comprising the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:153 into such mammalian cell (e.g., COS cells and the like) would produce a similar D3-12-IgG2 fusion protein lacking the predicted C-terminal lysine residue by virtue of analogous processing or secretion machinery.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dimeric D3-12-IgG2 fusion protein comprises two such D3-12-IgG2 monomers linked together by one or more disulfide bonds formed during cellular processing by the generation of covalent disulfide bonds between cysteine residues. D3-12-IgG2 and other fusion proteins of the invention can be made, e.g., by using methods set forth in Example 3. For example, a nucleic acid sequence encoding a D3-12 polypeptide (e.g., SEQ ID NO:90) can be cloned into the IgG2 Fc fusion vector, mammalian cells can be transfected with the vector, and the resultant fusion protein can be expressed (typically in dimeric form), purified, and evaluated as described in Example 3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother exemplary mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide is the D3-54 mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide comprising the polypeptide sequence of SEQ ID NO:36, and an exemplary mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein comprises the D3-54 mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide covalently linked or fused directly (no linker) at its C-terminus to the N-terminus of the hIgG2 Fc polypeptide shown in SEQ ID NO:218 (without the C-terminal lysine), thereby forming the D3-54-IgG2 fusion protein shown in SEQ ID NO:211, or covalently linked or fused directly (no linker) at its C-terminus to the N-terminus of the hIgG2 Fc polypeptide shown in SEQ ID NO:184 (with the C-terminal lysine), thereby forming the D3-54-IgG2 fusion protein shown in SEQ ID NO:197. As discussed above, experimental analysis indicates that the mature D3-54-IgG2 fusion protein made in CHO cells does not typically include the predicted C-terminal lysine residue. The C-terminal lysine of hIgG2 Fc is believed to be cleaved during processing or prior to secretion, resulting in the D3-54-IgG2 fusion protein sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:211. Further, as noted above, D3-29-IgG2 can be made by using methods of Example 3. The dimeric D3-54-IgG2 fusion protein comprises two D3-54-IgG2 monomers linked together by one or more disulfide bonds formed during cellular processing by the generation of covalent disulfide bonds between cysteine residues. The nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:201 encodes the fusion proteins shown in SEQ ID NOS:197 and 211.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther fusion proteins of the invention can similarly comprise a mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide linked or fused to hIgG2 (SEQ ID NO:218 or 184). Exemplary mature mutant CTLA-4-IgG2 fusion proteins of the invention include, e.g., the polypeptide sequences of each of SEQ ID NOS:74-79, 197-200, 205-214, and 219-222. Each of the polypeptide sequences of SEQ ID NOS:74-79, 197-200, 220, and 222 includes a C-terminal lysine residue; this C-terminal lysine residue is typically cleaved during processing or prior to secretion, resulting in the polypeptide sequences without the C-terminal lysine shown in SEQ ID NOS:205-210, 211-214, 219, and 221, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 10\n is a schematic diagram showing an exemplary configuration or structure of an exemplary mutant CTLA-4-IgG2 fusion protein of the invention. Two identical monomeric mutant CTLA-4-IgG2 fusion proteins are shown schematically, each comprising a mature mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide covalently linked at its C-terminus to the N-terminus of a human IgG2 Fc polypeptide. Each human IgG2 polypeptide includes a human IgG2 hinge, CH2 domain, and CH3 domain. Exemplary amino acid residues present at the junctions between the ECD and Ig Fc polypeptides are also shown. The amino acid residues at the junctions between these components may differ depending upon the mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide sequence and/or Ig polypeptide sequence. This dimeric mutant CTLA-4-IgG2 fusion protein results from the formation of at least one disulfide bond between cysteine residues at analogous positions in the two mutant CTLA-4-IgG2 fusion protein monomers. The cysteine (C) residues potentially involved in forming disulfide bonds between the two monomers are marked with asterisks. The signal peptide of each monomeric fusion protein is typically cleaved during processing and thus the secreted (mature) fusion protein typically does not include the signal peptide sequence. The polypeptide sequence of the human IgG2 polypeptide, which comprises the hinge, CH2 domain, and CH3 domain of human IgG2, is shown in SEQ ID NO:184. In an alternative aspect, the polypeptide sequence of the human IgG2 polypeptide, which comprises the hinge, CH2 domain, and CH3 domain of human IgG2, is shown in SEQ ID NO:218; in this instance, the IgG2 polypeptide does not include the C-terminal lysine (K) residue, as compared to the sequence of SEQ ID NO:184.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe properties of mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins of the invention, described in detail elsewhere, may be compared to the properties of one or more reference Ig fusion proteins, such as, e.g., hCTLA-4-IgG1, hCTLA-4-IgG2, Orencia® fusion protein, and LEA29Y-Ig. Properties that may be compared include, e.g., ability to bind CD80 and/or CD86 (and/or CD80-Ig and/or CD86-Ig), and/or ability to inhibit or suppress an immune response (e.g., T cell activation or proliferation, cytokine production, etc.). The mature hCTLA-4-IgG1 fusion protein typically exists in solution as a hCTLA-4-IgG1 fusion protein dimer comprising two identical monomeric hCTLA-4-IgG1 proteins, each monomeric hCTLA-4-IgG1 fusion protein comprising a hCTLA-4 ECD polypeptide (SEQ ID NO:159) linked to an IgG1 Fc polypeptide. The mature hCTLA-4-IgG2 fusion protein typically exists in solution as an hCTLA-4-IgG2 fusion protein dimer comprising two identical monomeric hCTLA-4-IgG2 proteins, each monomeric hCTLA-4-IgG2 fusion protein (SEQ ID NO:162) comprising an hCTLA-4 ECD polypeptide (SEQ ID NO:159) linked to an IgG2 Fc polypeptide. The mature Orencia® fusion protein is a fusion protein dimer comprising two identical monomeric Orencia® fusion proteins, each monomeric fusion protein (SEQ ID NO:164) comprising a hCTLA-4 ECD polypeptide (SEQ ID NO:159) linked to a specific mutant IgG1 polypeptide (SEQ ID NO:186). The mature LEA29Y-Ig fusion protein typically exists in solution as a LEA29Y-Ig fusion protein dimer comprising two identical monomeric LEA29Y-Ig fusion proteins, each monomeric LEA29Y-Ig fusion protein (SEQ ID NO:166) comprising a specific mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide (SEQ ID NO:168) linked to a specific mutant IgG1 polypeptide (SEQ ID NO:186). It is believed that the two fusion protein monomers of the Orencia® dimer are covalently linked together by a single disulfide bond formed between the cysteine residue at \nposition\n 120 of each hCTLA-4-mutant IgG1 monomer and that no disulfide bonds are formed between the two mutant IgG1 Fc polypeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome mutant CTLA-4 fusion proteins bind CD80 (e.g., hCD80) and/or CD86 (e.g., hCD86). Some such mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins bind a CD80-Ig fusion protein and/or a CD86-Ig fusion protein. Exemplary CD80-Ig fusion proteins include the hCD80-mIg fusion protein (SEQ ID NO:225), which comprises a human CD80 ECD linked to a murine Ig Fc polypeptide; and the hCD80-hIgG1 fusion protein (SEQ ID NO:171), which comprises the sequence of hCD80 ECD linked to human IgG1 Fc polypeptide.

See, e.g., Table 5 in Example 4. The mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide present in some such dimeric and monomeric fusion proteins comprises a polypeptide sequence having an amino acid length about equal to the amino acid length of the hCTLA-4 ECD. For example, some such mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptides comprise a polypeptide sequence that is about 110 to 138, 112 to 136, 114 to 134, 116 to 132, 118 to 130, 119 to 129, 120 to 128, 121 to 127, 122 to 126, or 123 to 125 amino acid residues in length. Some such mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptides comprise a sequence of 124 amino acid residues. Exemplary mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptides include, e.g., but are not limited to, those comprising a polypeptide sequence having at least 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100% sequence identity to at least one polypeptide sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS:1-73, wherein such mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide binds CD80 and/or CD86 (or an ECD of either or both), and/or has an ability to inhibit an immune response.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome such mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein dimers have a binding avidity for hCD86 and/or hCD86-Ig that is at least about equal to or greater than the binding avidity of a hCTLA-4-Ig fusion protein dimer (e.g., hCTLA-4-IgG2 or hCTLA-4-IgG1 dimer), Orencia® dimer, and/or LEA29Y-Ig dimer for hCD86 and/or hCD86-Ig, respectively.

See, e.g., exemplary dimeric fusion proteins of the invention in Table 3 below. Alternatively or additionally, some such fusion protein dimers have a binding avidity for hCD80 and/or hCD80-Ig that is at least about equal to or greater than the binding avidity of a hCTLA-4-Ig dimer (e.g., hCTLA-4-IgG2 or hCTLA-4-IgG1 dimer), Orencia® dimer, and/or LEA29Y-Ig dimer for hCD80 and/or hCD80-Ig, respectively.

See, e.g., exemplary dimeric fusion proteins of the invention in Table 4 below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome such mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein dimers dissociate from binding hCD86 and/or hCD86-Ig at a rate that is less than the rate at which a hCTLA-4-Ig dimer (e.g., hCTLA-4-IgG2 or hCTLA-4-IgG1 dimer), Orencia® dimer, and/or LEA29Y-Ig dimer dissociates from binding hCD86 and/or hCD86-Ig, respectively. Some such fusion proteins associate with or bind to hCD86 and/or hCD86-Ig at a rate that is at least equal to or greater than the rate at which an hCTLA-4-Ig dimer (e.g., hCTLA-4-IgG2 or hCTLA-4-IgG1 dimer), Orencia® dimer, and/or LEA29Y-Ig dimer associates with hCD86 and/or hCD86-Ig, respectively. For some such fusion protein dimers, the equilibrium dissociation constant (K\nD\n) for the binding reaction between CD86 (or CD86-Ig) and the fusion protein dimer of the invention is less than the equilibrium dissociation constant (K\nD\n) for the binding reaction between CD86 (or CD86-Ig) and an hCTLA-4-Ig dimer (e.g., hCTLA-4-IgG2 or hCTLA-4-IgG1 dimer), Orencia® dimer, and/or LEA29Y-Ig dimer. See, e.g., exemplary fusion protein dimers of the invention in Table 3. For some such fusion protein dimers, the equilibrium dissociation constant (K\nD\n) for the binding reaction between CD80 (or CD80-Ig) and the fusion protein dimer of the invention is about equal to or less than the equilibrium dissociation constant (K\nD\n) for the binding reaction between CD80 (or CD80-Ig) and a hCTLA-4-Ig dimer (e.g., hCTLA-4-IgG2 or hCTLA-4-IgG1 dimer), Orencia® dimer, or LEA29Y-Ig dimer. See, e.g., exemplary fusion protein dimers of the invention in Table 4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome such mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein dimers have an ability to inhibit or suppress an immune response (e.g., inhibit T cell activation or proliferation, inhibit cytokine production, etc.) that is at least about equal to or greater than the ability of a hCTLA-4-Ig dimer (e.g., hCTLA-4-IgG2 or hCTLA-4-IgG1 dimer), Orencia® dimer, and/or LEA29Y-Ig dimer to inhibit or suppress said immune response, respectively. For example, some such fusion protein dimers are capable of inhibiting T cell activation or T cell proliferation in in vitro assays. Examples 4-9 set forth below, for example, demonstrate the ability of representative fusion protein dimers of the invention comprising a representative mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide sequence to inhibit T cell proliferation in vitro. Some such dimers are capable of inhibiting or suppressing an immune response in a subject in vivo, such as through the administration of a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of at least one such dimer to a subject needing immunosuppressive therapy. Some such fusion protein dimers are expected to be useful in a variety of applications, including, e.g., but not limited to, in prophylactic and/or therapeutic methods for inhibiting or suppressing an immune response in a subject suffering from an immune system disease or disorder in which immunosuppression is desirable (e.g., autoimmune diseases) and methods for inhibiting rejection of a tissue, cell, or organ transplant from a donor by a recipient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome such dimers have varied abilities to modulate or suppress signaling through CD28, since they have different comparative binding avidities for CD80 and CD86. Such dimers are useful in applications in which differential manipulation of T cell responses is desirable, including therapeutic and prophylactic methods for treating immune system diseases and disorders, such as, e.g., immunodeficiency diseases and disorders (e.g., RA, MS, psoriasis, etc.). Exemplary dimeric fusion proteins comprising polypeptides of the invention having some of the above-described differential CD80/CD86 binding avidities and immunoinhibitory properties are shown in Example 4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome such mutant CTLA-4-Ig dimers have an ability to suppress or inhibit an immune response that is at least about equal to or greater than the ability of the hCTLA-4 protein or a hCTLA-4-Ig dimer to suppress or inhibit one or more types of immune responses. For example, some such dimers have an ability to inhibit T cell activation or proliferation in in vitro and/or in vivo assays and/or applications, such as those described above and below, which is at least about equal to or greater than the ability of the hCTLA-4 protein or a hCTLA-4-Ig dimer (e.g., Orencia®, hCTLA-4-IgG2 dimer, or hCTLA-4-IgG1 dimer) to inhibit T cell activation or proliferation in such applications. Additionally, some such dimers have an ability to inhibit or suppress an immune response (e.g., T cell activation or proliferation, cytokine production, T cell-dependent antibody response) that is greater than the ability of a LEA29Y-Ig dimer to inhibit or suppress an immune response. Examples 4-9, e.g., compare the ability of representative dimeric fusion proteins of the invention comprising a mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide sequence of the invention to inhibit T cell proliferation in vitro relative to the ability of dimeric hCTLA-4-IgG2, Orencia®, and LEAY29-Ig to inhibit T cell proliferation in vitro. See, e.g., Tables 6-9 below. Some such dimers have both an ability to bind hCD80 and/or hCD86 (or hCD80-Ig and/or hCD86-Ig) and an ability to inhibit or suppress an immune response in an in vitro and/or in vivo assays and/or applications, such as those described above and in greater detail below (e.g., an in vivo method in which in a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of at least one such dimer is administered).

The peptide is optionally a signal peptide. The C-terminus of the signal peptide is typically covalently linked to the N-terminus of a fusion protein. The signal peptide may comprise an amino acid sequence having at least 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% identity to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:182 or SEQ ID NO:216.

Furthermore, as discussed below, any such monomeric or dimeric mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein described above may comprise one or more of the amino acid residues that are glycosylated or pegylated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides a mature/secreted mutant CTLA-4-IgG2 fusion protein that is 352 amino acids in length and comprises a mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide comprising 124 amino acid residues and a human IgG2 Fc polypeptide comprising 228 amino acid residues. Exemplary mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptides include those polypeptides comprising sequences identified by any of SEQ ID NOS:1-73. Exemplary mutant CTLA-4-IgG2 fusion proteins include those comprising a polypeptide sequence identified by any of SEQ ID NOS:74-79, 197-200, 205-214, and 219-222. If desired, the amino acids of a mature mutant CTLA-4-IgG2 fusion protein can be numbered beginning with the first amino acid residue of the mutant CTLA-4-IgG2 (i.e., the first residue of the mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide). In some aspects, the first residue of the mutant CTLA-4-IgG2 fusion protein (or mutant CTLA-4 ECD) is methionine and thus the numbering of amino acids of the mutant CTLA-4-IgG2 fusion protein (or mutant CTLA-4 ECD) would begin with methionine (designated as amino acid residue 1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also includes isolated or recombinant multimeric fusion proteins comprising two or more mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins described above. In some instances, the multimer is a fusion protein dimer comprising two mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins, which may be identical fusion proteins (i.e., homodimer) or different fusion proteins (i.e., heterodimer). In some instances, the multimer is a tetrameric fusion protein, which comprises four mutant CTLA-4-ECD polypeptides of the invention. The tetramer can comprise four identical mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptides (i.e., homotetramer) or any combination of four mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptides of the invention such that all four mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptides are not identical (i.e., heterotetramer). Some such multimers bind CD80 and/CD86 (and/or hCD80-Ig and/or hCD86-Ig) and/or suppress or inhibit an immune response.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention includes soluble forms of any of the polypeptides, fusion proteins, and multimers described above. Also included are soluble forms on the conjugate of the invention described below. Soluble molecules of the invention—e.g., soluble polypeptides, dimeric fusion proteins, monomeric fusion proteins, multimers, and conjugates of the invention—are not linked or joined or bound to a cell. Some such soluble molecules may be in solution or are capable of circulating, e.g., in a fluid (e.g., in a subject's body). A signal peptide may typically be used to facilitate secretion of such a molecule, but the signal peptide is cleaved during secretion of the molecule from a host cell. Thus, in most instances, a soluble molecule, such as a soluble polypeptide, dimeric fusion protein, monomeric fusion protein, or multimer, does not include a signal peptide. As discussed above, a mutant CTLA-4 extracellular domain polypeptide of the invention can be linked to an Ig molecule, including, e.g., a portion of an Ig polypeptide, such as, e.g., an Ig Fc polypeptide, which results in a soluble fusion protein. Thus, in one aspect, the invention includes soluble mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins which comprise any mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide of the invention as described herein fused or linked to at least a portion of an Ig polypeptide, such as, e.g., a wild-type Ig Fc (e.g., human IgG2 Fc) or mutant Ig Fc polypeptide. Such soluble mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins may be monomeric or dimeric fusion proteins and include those mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein monomers and dimers described in detail above and elsewhere, including in the Examples below. As described in detail above and elsewhere herein, some such soluble monomeric and dimeric fusion proteins may have an ability to bind CD80 and/or CD86 and/or an ability to suppress or inhibit an immune response (e.g., T cell activation or proliferation) in in vitro and/or in vivo applications.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch soluble molecules of the invention are expected to be of particular benefit in a variety of applications, including, e.g., therapeutic and prophylactic methods for treating immune system diseases and disorders (e.g., autoimmune diseases) and prophylactic and therapeutic methods for inhibiting cell, organ or tissue graft transplantation. Soluble molecules of the invention—e.g., soluble recombinant mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptides, monomeric and dimeric mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins, mutant CTLA-4 ECD conjugates, mutant CTLA-4-Ig conjugates, multimers comprising mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptides or mutant CTLA-4-Ig, multimers comprising mutant CTLA-4 conjugates or mutant CTLA-4-Ig conjugates of the invention—which bind CD80 and/or CD86, when administered to a subject in a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount, inhibit the interaction between endogenous CD80 and/or CD86 and endogenous CD28, thereby suppressing in the subject an immune system response or immune system attack on the subject's healthy body tissues, organs, and/or cells. In instances where a subject is the recipient of healthy body tissues, organs, and/or cells from a donor (e.g., such as where the subject recipient has received a donor tissue graft or cell or organ transplant), such soluble molecules inhibit the interaction between endogenous CD80 and/or CD86 and endogenous CD28, thereby inhibiting a harmful response or attack by the subject's immune system on the healthy body tissues, organs, or cells donated to the subject by the donor. By suppressing an immune system response or attack on healthy body tissues, the side effects (e.g., pain, joint inflammation, etc.) associated with such immune system response or attack on healthy tissues, organs, or cells in the subject can be decreased, and the damage resulting from such a response or attack can be retarded or prevented.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for measuring binding affinities and avidities of polypeptides of the invention described above, including, e.g., mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptides, dimeric and monomeric mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins, and multimers of the invention would be known to those of ordinary skill in the art and include, e.g., but are not limited to, Biacore™ technology (GE Healthcare), isothermal titration microcalorimetry (MicroCal LLC, Northampton, Mass.), ELISA, binding affinity phage display methods, and FACS methods. Biacore methods are described in detail in Example 4 below. FACS or other sorting methods are described in greater detail above and elsewhere herein. Methods for measuring binding avidities of polypeptides of the invention to hCD80 and/or hCD86 by phage ELISA are described in Example 2 below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for detecting and measuring T cell responses induced by molecules of the invention (including, e.g., mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptides, dimeric and monomeric mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins, and multimers of the invention) are well known to those skilled in the art. T cell activation is commonly characterized by physiological events including, e.g., T cell-associated cytokine synthesis (e.g., IFN-γ production) and induction of activation markers (e.g., CD25, IL-2 receptor). CD4+ T cells recognize their immunogenic peptides in the context of MHC class II molecules, whereas CD8+ T cells recognize their immunogenic peptides in the context of MHC class I molecules. Exemplary methods for assessing and measuring the ability of molecules of the invention described above to inhibit or suppress T cell activation and/or T cell proliferation or to block signaling through CD86 and/or CD80 are described in Examples 5-8 and elsewhere herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolypeptides, monomeric and dimeric fusion proteins, and multimers of the invention, including those discussed above, optionally further comprise an additional amino acid, such as a methionine, added to the N-terminus and/or a peptide tag for purification or identification. Polypeptides of the invention, including those discussed above, optionally further comprise a polypeptide purification subsequence, such as, e.g., a subsequence is selected from an epitope tag, a FLAG tag, a polyhistidine sequence, and a GST fusion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, as discussed in greater detail below, the invention includes isolated, recombinant, or synthetic nucleic acids encoding all polypeptides, fusion proteins, and multimers of the invention described above and in additional detail below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSequence Identity\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs discussed above, in one aspect, the invention includes an isolated or recombinant polypeptide which comprises a polypeptide sequence having at least 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.5%, or 100% sequence identity to a polypeptide sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS:1-73, wherein the polypeptide binds CD80 or CD86 or an extracellular domain of either and/or has an ability to suppress or inhibit an immune response. In another aspect, as described in detail below, the invention provides an isolated or recombinant nucleic acid comprising a polynucleotide sequence that encodes a polypeptide comprising a polypeptide sequence having at least 75%, 80%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.5%, or 100% sequence identity to at least one polypeptide sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS:1-73, wherein the polypeptide has an ability to bind CD80 and/or CD86 and/or an ECD thereof, and/or has an ability to suppress an immune response, or a complementary polynucleotide sequence thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe degree to which a sequence (polypeptide or nucleic acid) is similar to another provides an indication of similar structural and functional properties for the two sequences. Accordingly, in the context of the present invention, sequences that have a similar sequence to any given exemplar sequence are a feature of the present invention. Sequences that have percent sequence identities as defined below are a feature of the invention. A variety of methods of determining sequence relationships can be used, including manual alignment and computer assisted sequence alignment and analysis. A variety of computer programs for performing sequence alignment are available, or can be produced by one of skill.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs noted above, the sequences of the nucleic acids and polypeptides employed in the subject invention need not be identical, but can be substantially identical to the corresponding sequence of a nucleic acid of the invention or polypeptide of the invention, respectively. For example, polypeptides of the invention can be subject to various changes, such as one or more amino acid insertions, deletions, and/or substitutions, either conservative or non-conservative, including where, e.g., such changes might provide for certain advantages in their use, such as, in their therapeutic or prophylactic use or administration or diagnostic application. The nucleic acids of the invention can also be subject to various changes, such as one or more substitutions of one or more nucleic acids in one or more codons such that a particular codon encodes the same or a different amino acid, resulting in either a silent variation (e.g., mutation in a nucleotide sequence results in a silent mutation in the amino acid sequence, e.g., when the encoded amino acid is not altered by the nucleic acid mutation) or non-silent variation, one or more deletions of one or more nucleic acids (or codons) in the sequence, one or more additions or insertions of one or more nucleic acids (or codons) in the sequence, cleavage of or one or more truncations of one or more nucleic acids (or codons) in the sequence. The nucleic acids can also be modified to include one or more codons that provide for optimum expression in an expression system (e.g., bacterial or mammalian), while, if desired, said one or more codons still encode the same amino acid(s). Such nucleic acid changes might provide for certain advantages in their therapeutic or prophylactic use or administration, or diagnostic application. The nucleic acids and polypeptides can be modified in a number of ways so long as they comprise a sequence substantially identical (as defined below) to a sequence in a respective nucleic acid or polypeptide of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “identical” or “identity,” in the context of two or more nucleic acid or polypeptide sequences, refers to two or more sequences that are the same or have a specified percentage of amino acid residues or nucleotides that are the same, when compared and aligned for maximum similarity, as determined using the sequence comparison algorithm described below or by visual inspection. The “percent sequence identity” (“% identity”) of a subject sequence to a reference (i.e. query) sequence means that the subject sequence is identical (i.e., on an amino acid-by-amino acid basis for a polypeptide sequence, or a nucleotide-by-nucleotide basis for a polynucleotide sequence) by a specified percentage to the query sequence over a comparison length.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe percent sequence identity (“% sequence identity” or “% identity”) of a subject sequence to a query sequence can be calculated as follows. First, the optimal alignment of the two sequences is determined using a sequence comparison algorithm with specific alignment parameters. This determination of the optimal alignment may be performed using a computer, or may be manually calculated, as described below. Then, the two optimally aligned sequences are compared over the comparison length, and the number of positions in the optimal alignment at which identical residues occur in both sequences are determined, which provides the number of matched positions. The number of matched positions is then divided by the total number of positions of the comparison length (which, unless otherwise specified, is the length of the query sequence), and then multiplying the result by 100, to yield the percent sequence identity of the subject sequence to the query sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWith regard to polypeptide sequences, typically one sequence is regarded as a “query sequence” (for example, a polypeptide sequence of the invention) to which one or more other sequences, i.e., “subject sequence(s)” (for example, sequences present in a sequence database) are compared. The sequence comparison algorithm uses the designated alignment parameters to determine the optimal alignment between the query sequence and the subject sequence(s). When comparing a query sequence against a sequence database, such as, e.g., GENBANK® database (Genetic Sequence Data Bank; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services) or GENESEQ® database (Thomson Derwent; also available as DGENE® database on STN), usually only the query sequence and the alignment parameters are input into the computer; optimal alignments between the query sequence and each subject sequence are returned for up to a specified number of subject sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n1. Determining the Optimal Alignment\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo polypeptide sequences are “optimally aligned” when they are aligned using defined parameters, i.e., a defined amino acid substitution matrix, gap existence penalty (also termed gap open penalty), and gap extension penalty, so as to arrive at the highest similarity score possible for that pair of sequences. The BLOSUM62 matrix (Henikoff and Henikoff (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89(22):10915-10919) is often used as a default scoring substitution matrix in polypeptide sequence alignment algorithms (such as BLASTP, described below). The gap existence penalty is imposed for the introduction of a single amino acid gap in one of the aligned sequences, and the gap extension penalty is imposed for each residue position in the gap. Unless otherwise stated, alignment parameters employed herein are: BLOSUM62 scoring matrix, gap existence penalty=11, and gap extension penalty=1. The alignment score is defined by the amino acid positions of each sequence at which the alignment begins and ends (e.g., the alignment window), and optionally by the insertion of a gap or multiple gaps into one or both sequences, so as to arrive at the highest possible similarity score.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile optimal alignment between two or more sequences can be determined manually (as described below), the process is facilitated by the use of a computer-implemented alignment algorithm such as BLAST® (National Library of Medicine), e.g., BLASTP for polypeptide sequences and BLASTN for nucleic acid sequences, described in Altschul et al. (1997) Nucleic Acids Res. 25:3389-3402, and made available to the public through various sources, such as the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website. When using a computerized BLAST interface, if the option exists to use a “low complexity filter”, this option should be turned off (i.e., no filter).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe optimal alignment between two polypeptide sequences can also be determined by a manual calculation of the BLASTP algorithm (i.e., without aid of a computer) using the same alignment parameters specified above (matrix=BLOSUM62, gap open penalty=11, and gap extension penalty=1). To begin, the two sequences are initially aligned by visual inspection. An initial alignment score is then calculated as follows: for each individual position of the alignment (i.e., for each pair of aligned residues), a numerical value is assigned according to the BLOSUM62 matrix (\nFIG. 13\n). The sum of the values assigned to each pair of residues in the alignment is the alignment score. If the two sequences being aligned are highly similar, often this initial alignment provides the highest possible alignment score. The alignment with the highest possible alignment score is the optimal alignment based on the alignment parameters employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of the manual calculation of alignment scores for two sequences are provided in \nFIGS. 14A-14D\n. \nFIG. 14A\n shows is the calculation of an alignment score for an arbitrary alignment (alignment \n14\nA) of a “query” sequence, identified herein as residues 39-53 of the human CTLA-4 ECD sequence (SEQ ID NO:159), and a “subject” sequence, identified herein as residues 40-54 of D3 (SEQ ID NO:61). The numerical value assigned by the BLOSUM62 matrix for each aligned pair of amino acids is shown beneath each position in the alignment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 14B\n shows the alignment score for the optimal alignment of the same two sequences. To aid in visualization, each identical pair of amino acids in the alignment is shown in boldface. The alignment in \nFIG. 14B\n (alignment \n14\nB) below results in the highest possible alignment score (the sum of the values shown beneath each aligned position) of these two sequences; any other alignment of these two sequences, with or without gaps, would result in a lower alignment score.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some instances, a higher alignment score might be obtained by introducing one or more gaps into the alignment. Whenever a gap is introduced into an alignment, a gap open penalty is assigned, and in addition a gap extension penalty is assessed for each residue position within that gap. Therefore, using the alignment parameters described above (including gap open penalty=11 and gap extension penalty=1), a gap of one residue in the alignment would correspond to a value of −(11+(1×1))=−12 assigned to the gap; a gap of two residues would correspond to a value of −(11+(2×1))=−13 assigned to the gap, and so on. This calculation is repeated for each new gap introduced into the alignment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following is an example, which demonstrates how introduction of a gap into an alignment can result in a higher alignment score, despite the gap penalty. \nFIG. 14C\n shows an alignment (alignment \n14\nC) of a “query” sequence, identified herein as residues 39-53 of the human CTLA-4 ECD sequence (SEQ ID NO:159), and a “subject” sequence, identified herein as residues 41-55 of D3 (SEQ ID NO:61), but in this instance with amino acids 49-50 deleted. Alignment \n14\nC, which is the best possible alignment without introduction of any gaps, results in an alignment score of 34.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe alignment in \nFIG. 14D\n (alignment \n14\nD) shows the effect of the introduction of a two-residue gap in the lower sequence on the alignment score. Despite the total gap penalty of 13 (the gap open penalty of 11, and 2 times the gap extension penalty of 1), the overall alignment score of the two sequences increases to 43. Alignment D below results in the highest possible alignment score, and is thus the optimal alignment of these two sequences; any other alignment of these two sequences (with or without gaps) would result in a lower alignment score.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is to be understood that the examples of sequence alignment calculations described above, which use relatively short sequences, are provided for illustrative purposes only. In practice, the alignment parameters employed (BLOSUM62 matrix, gap open penalty=11, and gap extension penalty=1) are generally intended for polypeptide sequences 85 amino acids in length or longer. The NCBI website provides the following alignment parameters for sequences of other lengths, which are suitable for computer-aided as well as manual alignment calculation, using the same procedure as described above. For sequences of 50-85 amino acids in length, optimal parameters are the BLOSUM80 matrix (Henikoff and Henikoff, supra), gap open penalty=10, and gap extension penalty=1. For sequences of 35-50 amino acids in length, optimal parameters are the PAM70 matrix (Dayhoff, M. O., Schwartz, R. M. & Orcutt, B. C. (1978) “A model of evolutionary change in proteins” in \nAtlas of Protein Sequence and Structure\n, vol. 5, suppl. 3, M. O. Dayhoff (ed.), pp. 345-352, Natl. Biomed. Res. Found., Washington, D.C.), gap open penalty=10, and gap extension penalty=1. For sequences of less than 35 amino acids in length, optimal parameters are PAM30 matrix (Dayhoff, M. O., supra), gap open penalty=9, and gap extension penalty=1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n2. Calculating Percent Identity\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOnce the sequences are optimally aligned, the percent identity of the subject sequence relative to the query sequence is calculated by counting the number of positions in the optimal alignment which contain identical residue pairs, divide that by the number of residues in the comparison length (also termed the comparison window), which, unless otherwise specified, is the number of residues in the query sequence, and multiplying the resulting number by 100. Referring back to the alignments above, in each example the sequence designated as the query (upper) sequence is 15 amino acids in length. In alignment B, 12 pairs of aligned amino acid residues (shown in boldface) are identical in the optimal alignment of the query sequence (upper) with the subject sequence (lower). Thus, this particular subject sequence has ( 12/15)×100=80% identity to the entire length of the 15-residue query sequence; in other words, the subject sequence in alignment B has at least 80% amino acid sequence identity to the query sequence. In alignment D, 11 pairs of amino acid residues (shown in boldface) in the optimal alignment are identical; thus this particular subject sequence has ( 11/15)×100=73.3% identity to the entire length of the 15-residue query sequence; in other words, the subject sequence in alignment D has at least 73% amino acid sequence identity to the query sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs applied to polypeptides, the term “substantial identity” (or “substantially identical”) typically means that when two amino acid sequences (i.e. a query sequence and a subject sequence) are optimally aligned using the BLASTP algorithm (manually or via computer) using appropriate parameters described above, the subject sequence has at least 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.5% or 100% amino acid sequence identity to the query sequence. In some instances, the substantial identity exists over a comparison length of at least 100 amino acid residues, such as, e.g., at least 110, 115, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 130, 135, 140, 145, 150, 200, 250, 300, 345, 346, 347, 348, 349, 350, 351, 352, 353, 354, 355, 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 375, 400, 450, or 500 amino acid residues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilarly, as applied in the context of two nucleic acid sequences, the term substantial identity (or substantially identical) means that when two nucleic acid sequences (i.e. a query and a subject sequence) are optimally aligned using the BLASTN algorithm (manually or via computer) using appropriate parameters described below, the subject sequence has at least about 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.5% or 100% nucleic acid sequence identity to the query sequence. Parameters used for nucleic acid sequence alignments are: \nmatch reward\n 1, mismatch penalty −3, \ngap existence penalty\n 5, gap extension penalty 2 (substitution matrices are not used in the BLASTN algorithm). In some instances, substantial identity exists over a comparison length of at least 300 nucleotide residues, e.g., at least 330, 345, 354, 357, 360, 363, 366, 369, 362, 365, 375, 390, 405, 420, 435, 450, 600, 750, 900, 1035, 1038, 1041, 1044, 1047, 1050, 1053, 1056, 1059, 1062, 1065, 1068, 1071, 1074, 1077, 1080, 1200, 1350, or 1500 nucleotide residues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther sequence alignment programs known in the art can be used. The ALIGN program produces an optimal global (overall) alignment of the two chosen protein or nucleic acid sequences using a modification of the dynamic programming algorithm described by Myers and Miller CABIOS 4:11-17 (1988). The ALIGN program typically, although not necessary, is used with weighted end-gaps. If gap opening and gap extension penalties are available, they are often set between about −5 to −15 and 0 to −3, respectively, more preferably about −12 and −0.5 to −2, respectively, for amino acid sequence alignments, and −10 to −20 and −3 to −5, respectively, more commonly about −16 and −4, respectively, for nucleic acid sequence alignments. The ALIGN program is further described in Pearson et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:2444-48 (1988), and Pearson et al., Meth. Enzymol. 18:63-98 (1990).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, and particularly for multiple sequence analysis (i.e., comparison of more than three sequences), the CLUSTALW program (described in, e.g., Thompson et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 22:4673-4680 (1994)) can be used. The CLUSTALW program is an algorithm suitable for multiple DNA and amino acid sequence alignments (Thompson et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 22:4673-4680 (1994)). CLUSTALW performs multiple pairwise comparisons between groups of sequences and assembles them into a multiple alignment based on homology. In one aspect, Gap open and Gap extension penalties are set at 10 and 0.05, respectively. Alternatively or additionally, the CLUSTALW program is run using “dynamic” (versus “fast”) settings. Typically, nucleotide sequence analysis with CLUSTALW is performed using the BESTFIT matrix, whereas amino acid sequences are evaluated using a variable set of BLOSUM matrixes depending on the level of identity between the sequences (e.g., as used by the CLUSTALW version 1.6 program available through the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) or version W 1.8 available from European Bioinformatics Institute, Cambridge, UK). Preferably, the CLUSTALW settings are set to the SDSC CLUSTALW default settings (e.g., with respect to special hydrophilic gap penalties in amino acid sequence analysis). The CLUSTALW program is further described in, e.g., Higgins et al., CABIOS 8(2):189-91 (1992), Thompson et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 22:4673-80 (1994), and Jeanmougin et al., Trends Biochem. Sci. 2:403-07 (1998).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an alternative format, the identity or percent identity between a particular pair of aligned amino acid sequences refers to the percent amino acid sequence identity that is obtained by CLUSTALW analysis (e.g., version W 1.8), counting the number of identical matches in the alignment and dividing such number of identical matches by the greater of (i) the length of the aligned sequences, and (ii) 96, and using the following default ClustalW parameters to achieve slow/accurate pairwise alignments—Gap Open Penalty:10; Gap Extension Penalty:0.10; Protein weight matrix:Gonnet series; DNA weight matrix: IUB; Toggle Slow/Fast pairwise alignments=SLOW or FULL Alignment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother useful algorithm for determining percent identity or percent similarity is the FASTA algorithm, which is described in Pearson et al., Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:2444 (1988) and Pearson, Methods Enzymol. 266:227-258 (1996). Typical parameters used in a FASTA alignment of DNA sequences to calculate percent identity are optimized, BL50 Matrix 15: −5, k-tuple=2; joining penalty=40, optimization=28; gap penalty=−12, gap length penalty=−2; and width=16.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther suitable algorithms include the BLAST and BLAST 2.0 algorithms, which facilitate analysis of at least two amino acid or nucleotide sequences, by aligning a selected sequence against multiple sequences in a database (e.g., GenSeq), or, when modified by an additional algorithm such as BL2SEQ, between two selected sequences. Software for performing BLAST analyses is publicly available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (worldwide website address ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The BLAST algorithm involves first identifying high scoring sequence pairs (HSPs) by identifying short words of length W in the query sequence, which either match or satisfy some positive-valued threshold score T when aligned with a word of the same length in a database sequence. T is referred to as the neighborhood word score threshold (Altschul et al., supra). These initial neighborhood word hits act as seeds for initiating searches to find longer HSPs containing them. The word hits are extended in both directions along each sequence for as far as the cumulative alignment score can be increased. Cumulative scores are calculated using, for nucleotide sequences, the parameters M (reward score for a pair of matching residues; always >0) and N (penalty score for mismatching residues; always <0). For amino acid sequences, a scoring matrix is used to calculate the cumulative score. Extension of the word hits in each direction are halted when: the cumulative alignment score falls off by the quantity X from its maximum achieved value; the cumulative score goes to zero or below, due to the accumulation of one or more negative-scoring residue alignments; or the end of either sequence is reached. The BLAST algorithm parameters W, T, and X determine the sensitivity and speed of the alignment. The BLASTN program (for nucleotide sequences) can be used with a word length (W) of 11, an expectation (E) of 10, M=5, N=−4 and a comparison of both strands. For amino acid sequences, the BLASTP program (e.g., BLASTP 2.0.14; Jun. 29, 2000) can be used with a word length of 3 and an expectation (E) of 10. The BLOSUM62 scoring matrix (see Henikoff & Henikoff, (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:10915) uses alignments (B) of 50, expectation (E) of 10, M=5, N=−4, and a comparison of both strands. Again, as with other suitable algorithms, the stringency of comparison can be increased until the program identifies only sequences that are more closely related to those in the sequence listing herein (e.g., a polypeptide comprising a polypeptide sequence having at least 85, 90, 91, 92, 93, 49, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99%, or 100% identity to a polypeptide sequence selected from SEQ ID NOS:1-79, 197-200, 205-214, and 219-222; or nucleic acid comprising a nucleotide sequence having at least 85, 90, 91, 92, 93, 49, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99%, or 100% identity to a nucleotide sequence selected from any of SEQ ID NOS:80-158, 201-204, 223, and 224, or a complementary nucleotide sequence thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe BLAST algorithm also performs a statistical analysis of the similarity or identity between two sequences (see, e.g., Karlin & Altschul, (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:5873-5787). One measure of similarity or identity provided by the BLAST algorithm is the smallest sum probability (P(N)), which provides an indication of the probability by which a match between two nucleotide or amino acid sequences would occur by chance. For example, a nucleic acid is considered similar to a reference sequence if the smallest sum probability in a comparison of the test nucleic acid to the reference nucleic acid is less than about 0.2, such as less than about 0.01 or less than about 0.001.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBLAST program analysis also or alternatively can be modified by low complexity filtering programs such as the DUST or SEG programs, which are preferably integrated into the BLAST program operations (see, e.g., Wootton et al., Comput. Chem. 17:149-63 (1993), Altschul et al., Nat. Genet. 6:119-29 (1991), Hancock et al., Comput. Appl. Biosci. 10:67-70 (1991), and Wootton et al., Meth. Enzymol. 266:554-71 (1996)). In such aspects, if a lambda ratio is used, useful settings for the ratio are between 0.75 and 0.95, including between 0.8 and 0.9. If gap existence costs (or gap scores) are used in such aspects, the gap existence cost typically is set between about −5 and −15, more typically about −10, and the per residue gap cost typically is set between about 0 to −5, such as between 0 and −3 (e.g., −0.5). Similar gap parameters can be used with other programs as appropriate. The BLAST programs and principles underlying them are further described in, e.g., Altschul et al., J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-10 (1990), Karlin and Altschul, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87:2264-68 (199) (as modified by Karlin and Altschul, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:5873-77 (1993)), and Altschul et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 25:3389-3402 (1997).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother example of a useful algorithm is incorporated in PILEUP software. The PILEUP program creates a multiple sequence alignment from a group of related sequences using progressive, pair-wise alignments to show relationship and percent sequence identity or percent sequence similarity. PILEUP uses a simplification of the progressive alignment method of Feng & Doolittle (1987) J. Mol. Evol. 35:351-360, which is similar to the method described by Higgins & Sharp (1989) CABIOS 5:151-153. The program can align up to 300 sequences, each of a maximum length of 5,000 nucleotides or amino acids. The multiple alignment procedure begins with the pairwise alignment of the two most similar sequences, producing a cluster of two aligned sequences. This cluster is then aligned to the next most related sequence or cluster of aligned sequences. Two clusters of sequences are aligned by a simple extension of the pairwise alignment of two individual sequences. The final alignment is achieved by a series of progressive, pairwise alignments. The program is run by designating specific sequences and their amino acid or nucleotide coordinates for regions of sequence comparison and by designating the program parameters. Using PILEUP, a reference sequence is compared to other test sequences to determine the percent sequence identity (or percent sequence similarity) relationship using specified parameters. Exemplary parameters for the PILEUP program are: default gap weight (3.00), default gap length weight (0.10), and weighted end gaps. PILEUP is a component of the GCG sequence analysis software package, e.g., version 7.0 (Devereaux et al. (1984) Nucl. Acids Res. 12:387-395).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther useful algorithms for performing identity analysis include the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman (1981) Adv. Appl. Math. 2:482, the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch (1970) J. Mol. Biol. 48:443, and the search for similarity method of Pearson and Lipman (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:2444. Computerized implementations of these algorithms (e.g., GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA and TFASTA) are provided in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package Release 7.0, Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Dr., Madison, Wis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSequence Variation\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs discussed above, in one aspect, the invention provides an isolated or recombinant mutant CTLA-4 extracellular domain polypeptide which comprises a polypeptide sequence which (a) differs from a polypeptide sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS:1-73 in no more than 6 amino acid residues (e.g., no more than 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 amino acid residues), wherein the mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide binds CD80 and/or CD86 and/or an extracellular domain of either or both, and/or inhibits an immune response. Such amino acid substitution(s) include conservative amino acid substitution(s).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a non-limiting example, a polypeptide of the invention may have a polypeptide sequence which differs from SEQ ID NO:1 in a total of up to 6 amino acids (which may be a combination of amino acid substitutions, deletions, and/or insertions, including those described above). In some instances, none, some, or all of the substitutions are substitutions according to a substitution group defined below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmino acid substitutions in accordance with the invention may include, but are not limited to, one or more conservative amino acid substitutions. A conservative amino acid residue substitution typically involves exchanging a member within one functional class of amino acid residues for a residue that belongs to the same functional class (identical amino acid residues are considered functionally homologous or conserved in calculating percent functional homology). Conservative substitution tables providing functionally similar amino acids are well known in the art. One example is provided in Table 1, which sets forth six exemplary groups containing amino acids that may be considered “conservative substitutions” for one another.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nConservative Amino Acid \nResidue Substitution Groups\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nAlanine (A)\n\n\nGlycine (G)\n\n\nSerine (S)\n\n\nThreonine (T)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nAspartic acid (D)\n\n\nGlutamic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nacid (E)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nAsparagine (N)\n\n\nGlutamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(Q)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nArginine (R)\n\n\nLysine (K)\n\n\nHistidine (H)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nIsoleucine (I)\n\n\nLeucine (L)\n\n\nMethionine (M)\n\n\nValine (V)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nPhenylalanine (F)\n\n\nTyrosine (Y)\n\n\nTryptophan (W)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther substitution groups of amino acids can be envisioned. For example, amino acids can be grouped by similar function or chemical structure or composition (e.g., acidic, basic, aliphatic, aromatic, sulfur-containing). For example, an Aliphatic grouping may comprise: Glycine (G), Alanine (A), Valine (V), Leucine (L), Isoleucine (I). Other groups containing amino acids that are considered conservative substitutions for one another include: Aromatic: Phenylalanine (F), Tyrosine (Y), Tryptophan (W); Sulfur-containing: Methionine (M), Cysteine (C); Basic: Arginine (R), Lysine (K), Histidine (H); Acidic: Aspartic acid (D), Glutamic acid (E); Non-polar uncharged residues, Cysteine (C), Methionine (M), and Proline (P); Hydrophilic Uncharged Residues: Serine (S), Threonine (T), Asparagine (N), and Glutamine (Q). See also Creighton (1984) \nProteins\n, W.H. Freeman and Company, for additional groupings of amino acids. Listing of a polypeptide sequence herein, in conjunction with the above substitution groups, provides an express listing of all conservatively substituted polypeptide sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore conservative substitutions exist within the amino acid residue classes described above, which also or alternatively can be suitable. Conservation groups for substitutions that are more conservative include: valine-leucine-isoleucine, phenylalanine-tyrosine, lysine-arginine, alanine-valine, and asparagine-glutamine. Thus, for example, in one particular aspect, the invention provides an isolated or recombinant polypeptide comprising a polypeptide sequence which has at least 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, or 99% identity to SEQ ID NO:1 (or any of SEQ ID NOS:1-79, 197-200, 205-214, and 219-222) and which differs from the sequence of SEQ ID NO:1 by mostly (e.g., at least 50%, 60%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 90%), if not entirely, by such more conservative amino acid substitutions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional groups of amino acids substitutions that also can be suitable can be determined using the principles described in, e.g., Creighton (1984) P\nROTEINS\n: S\nTRUCTURE AND \nM\nOLECULAR \nP\nROPERTIES \n(2d Ed. 1993), W.H. Freeman and Company. In some aspects, at least 33%, 50%, 60%, 70%, or more (e.g., at least 75%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97% or more) of the substitutions in an amino acid sequence variant comprise substitutions of one or more amino acid residues in a polypeptide sequence of the invention with residues that are within the same functional homology class (as determined by any suitable classification system, such as those described above) as the amino acid residues of the polypeptide sequence that they replace.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConservatively substituted variations of a polypeptide sequence of the present invention include substitutions of a small percentage, typically less than 10%, 9%, 8%, 7%, or 6% of the amino acids of the polypeptide sequence, or more typically less than 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, or 1%, of the amino acids of the polypeptide sequence, with a conservatively selected amino acid of the same conservative substitution group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention includes polypeptides that comprise amino acid variations of a polypeptide sequence of the invention described herein. As discussed above, in one aspect, the invention provides isolated or recombinant polypeptides (e.g., mutant CTLA-4 polypeptides, such as, e.g., mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptides) which each comprise a polypeptide sequence having at least 75%, 80%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.5%, or 100% sequence identity to at least one polypeptide sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS:1-73, wherein the polypeptide binds CD80 and/or CD86 or a polypeptide fragment of CD80 and/or CD86 (or an ECD of either or both), and/or suppresses an immune response. Such polypeptides may vary by one or more amino acid deletions, additions, or substitutions, including one or more conservative or non-conservative substitutions, provided, however, that the polypeptides possess the described functional properties. In a particular aspect, the invention provides polypeptide variants that comprise conservatively modified variations of any such polypeptide described herein, such as, e.g., one comprising a polypeptide sequence selected from the group of SEQ ID NOS:1-73.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs also discussed above, in another aspect, the invention provides isolated or recombinant fusion proteins (e.g., mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins) which each comprise a polypeptide sequence having at least 75%, 80%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.5%, or 100% sequence identity to at least one polypeptide sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS:74-79, 197-200, 205-214, and 219-222, wherein the fusion protein binds CD80 and/or CD86 (and/or CD80-Ig and/or CD86-Ig), and/or suppresses an immune response. Such fusion proteins may vary by one or more amino acid deletions, additions, or substitutions, including one or more conservative or non-conservative substitutions, provided, however, that the fusion proteins possess the described functional properties. In a particular aspect, the invention provides polypeptide variants that comprise conservatively modified variations of any such fusion protein described herein, such as, e.g., one comprising a polypeptide sequence selected from the group of SEQ ID NOS:74-79, 197-200, 205-214, and 219-222.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso provided are polypeptide variants of any isolated or recombinant polypeptide of the invention described above or elsewhere herein, wherein the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide variant differs from the respective polypeptide sequence of the reference polypeptide by one or more conservative amino acid residue substitutions, although non-conservative substitutions are sometimes permissible or even preferred (examples of such non-conservative substitutions are discussed further herein). For example, the sequence of the polypeptide variant can vary from a mutant CTLA-4 polypeptide sequence by one or more substitutions of amino acid residues in the mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide sequence with one or more amino acid residues having similar weight (i.e., a residue that has weight homology to the residue in the respective polypeptide sequence that it replaces). The weight (and correspondingly the size) of amino acid residues of a polypeptide can significantly impact the structure of the polypeptide. Weight-based conservation or homology is based on whether a non-identical corresponding amino acid is associated with a positive score on one of the weight-based matrices described herein (e.g., BLOSUM50 matrix; PAM250 matrix).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilar to the above-described functional amino acid classes, naturally occurring amino acid residues can be divided into weight-based conservations groups (which are divided between “strong” and “weak” conservation groups). The eight commonly used weight-based strong conservation groups are Ser Thr Ala, Asn Glu Gln Lys, Asn His Gln Lys, Asn Asp Glu Gln, Gln His Arg Lys, Met Ile Leu Val, Met Ile Leu Phe, His Tyr, and Phe Tyr Trp. Weight-based weak conservation groups include Cys Ser Ala, Ala Thr Val, Ser Ala Gly, Ser Thr Asn Lys, Ser Thr Pro Ala, Ser Gly Asn Asp, Ser Asn Asp Glu Gln Lys, Asn Asp Glu Gln His Lys, Asn Glu Gln His Arg Lys, Phe Val Leu Ile Met, and His Phe Tyr. Some versions of the CLUSTAL W sequence analysis program provide an analysis of weight-based strong conservation and weak conservation groups in the output of an alignment, thereby offering a convenient technique for determining weight-based conservation (e.g., CLUSTAL W provided by the SDSC, which typically is used with the SDSC default settings). In some aspects, at least 33%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, or 90% of the substitutions in such polypeptide variant comprise substitutions wherein a residue within a weight-based conservation replaces an amino acid residue of the polypeptide sequence that is in the same weight-based conservation group. In other words, such a percentage of substitutions are conserved in terms of amino acid residue weight characteristics.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe sequence of a polypeptide variant can differ from a mutant CTLA-4 polypeptide of the invention by one or more amino acid substitutions with one or more amino acid residues having a similar hydropathy profile (i.e., that exhibit similar hydrophilicity) to the substituted (original) residues of the mutant CTLA-4 polypeptide. A hydropathy profile can be determined using the Kyte & Doolittle index, the scores for each naturally occurring amino acid in the index being as follows: I (+4.5), V (+4.2), L (+3.8), F (+2.8), C (+2.5), M (+1.9); A (+1.8), G (−0.4), T (−0.7), S (−0.8), W (−0.9), Y (−1.3), P (−1.6), H (−3.2); E (−3.5), Q (−3.5), D (−3.5), N (−3.5), K (−3.9), and R (−4.5) (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,554,101 and Kyte & Doolittle, J. Molec. Biol. 157:105-32 (1982) for further discussion). At least 75%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97% 98%, 99%, or 100% of the amino acid residues in the variant polypeptide sequence that are not identical to the corresponding residues in the identical or functionally homologous mutant CTLA-4 polypeptide sequence disclosed herein (“most related homolog”), which homolog may be selected from any of SEQ ID NOS:1-73, exhibit less than a +/−2 change in hydrophilicity, including less than a +/−1 change in hydrophilicity and less than a +/−0.5 change in hydrophilicity with respect to the non-identical amino acid residue at the corresponding position in the most related homolog. The variant polypeptide may exhibit a total change in hydrophilicity with respect to its most related homolog selected from the group of SEQ ID NOS:1-73, of less than about 150, less than about 100, and/or less than about 50 (e.g., less than about 30, 20, or 10).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of typical amino acid substitutions that retain similar or identical hydrophilicity include arginine-lysine substitutions, glutamate-aspartate substitutions, serine-threonine substitutions, glutamine-asparagine substitutions, and valine-leucine-isoleucine substitutions. Algorithms and software, such as the GREASE program available through the SDSC, provide a convenient way for quickly assessing the hydropathy profile of an amino acid sequence. Because a substantial proportion (e.g., at least about 33%), if not most (at least 50%) or nearly all (e.g., about 65, 80, 90, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99%) of the amino acid substitutions in the sequence of a polypeptide variant often will have a similar hydropathy score as the amino acid residue that they replace in the (reference) polypeptide sequence, the sequence of the polypeptide variant is expected to exhibit a similar GREASE program output as the polypeptide sequence. For example, in a particular aspect, a polypeptide variant of SEQ ID NO:61 may be expected to have a GREASE program (or similar program) output that is more like the GREASE output obtained by inputting the polypeptide sequence of SEQ ID NO:61 than that obtained by using a WT CTLA-4 polypeptide (e.g., hCTLA-4), which can be determined by visual inspection or computer-aided comparison of the graphical (e.g., graphical overlay/alignment) and/or numerical output provided by subjecting the test variant sequence and SEQ ID NO:1 to the program.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe conservation of amino acid residues in terms of functional homology, weight homology, and hydropathy characteristics, also apply to other polypeptide sequence variants provided by the invention, including, but not limited to, e.g., polypeptide sequence variants of a polypeptide sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS:1-79197-200, 205-214, and 219-222.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a particular aspect, the invention includes at least one such polypeptide variant comprising an amino acid sequence that differs from a recombinant polypeptide sequence selected from the group of SEQ ID NOS:1-79, 197-200, 205-214, and 219-222, wherein the amino acid sequence of the variant has at least one such amino acid residue substitution selected according to weight-based conservation or homology or similar hydropathy profile as discussed above. Such polypeptide variants described above typically have an ability to bind CD80 and/or CD86 and/or an ability to suppress at least one type of immune response as described above and in greater detail below in the Examples.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSignal Peptide Sequences\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolypeptides of the invention can also further comprise any suitable number and type of additional amino acid sequences, such as one or more peptide fragments. In one embodiment, such a polypeptide of the invention further comprises a signal peptide. Generally, the signal peptide directs the recombinant polypeptide to the endoplasmic reticulum when the recombinant polypeptide is expressed in an animal cell. A signal sequence that directs organelle trafficking and/or secretion of at least a portion of the polypeptide upon expression in a cell may be included. Such sequences are typically present in the immature (i.e., not fully processed) form of the polypeptide, and are subsequently removed/degraded by cellular proteases to arrive at the mature form of the protein. For example, a mutant CTLA-4 polypeptide or fusion protein of the invention can include any suitable signal sequence or combinations of signal sequences that direct the polypeptide to intracellular compartments, such as a sequence that directs the polypeptide to be transported (e.g., translocated) into (e.g., such that the protein is processed by and released from) the endoplasmic reticulum or secretory pathway (e.g., the ER, golgi, and other secretory related organelles and cellular compartments), the nucleus, and/or which directs the polypeptide to be secreted from the cell, translocated in a cellular membrane, or target a second cell apart from the cell the protein is secreted from. In this respect, the polypeptide can include an intracellular targeting sequence (or “sorting signal”) that directs the polypeptide to an endosomal and/or lysosomal compartment(s) or other compartment rich in MHC II to promote CD4+ and/or CD8+ T cell presentation and response, such as a lysosomal/endosomal-targeting sorting signal derived from lysosomal associated membrane protein 1 (e.g., LAMP-1—see, e.g., Wu et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92:1161-75 (1995) and Ravipraskash et al., Virology 290:74-82 (2001)), a portion or homolog thereof (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,633,234), or other suitable lysosomal, endosomal, and/or ER targeting sequence (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,248,565). In some aspects, it may desirable for the intracellular targeting sequence to be located near or adjacent to a proven/identified epitope sequence(s) within the polypeptide, which can be identified by techniques known in the art, thereby increasing the likelihood of T cell presentation of polypeptide fragments that comprise such epitope(s). Such polypeptides may be expressed from an isolated, recombinant, or synthetic DNA or RNA delivered to a host cell by one or more of the nucleotide transfer vectors, including, e.g., one or more of the gene transfer vectors, described further herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe polypeptide may comprise a signal sequence that directs the polypeptide to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (e.g., facilitates ER translocation of the polypeptide) when the polypeptide is expressed in a mammalian cell. The polypeptide can comprise any suitable ER-targeting sequence. Many ER-targeting sequences are known in the art. Examples of such signal sequences are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,846,540. Commonly employed ER/secretion signal sequences include the yeast alpha factor signal sequence, and mammalian viral signal sequences such as herpes virus gD signal sequence. Exemplary signal peptides for \nE. coli \nproduction include the STII or Ipp signal sequences of \nE. coli\n. Further examples of signal sequences are described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,690,898, 5,284,768, 5,580,758, 5,652,139, and 5,932,445. Suitable signal sequences can be identified using skill known in the art. For example, the SignalP program (described in, e.g., Nielsen et al. (1997) Protein Engineering 10:1-6), which is publicly available through the Center for Biological Sequence Analysis at the worldwide website address designated cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP, or similar sequence analysis software capable of identifying signal-sequence-like domains can be used. Related techniques for identifying suitable signal peptides are provided in Nielsen et al., Protein Eng. 10(1): 1-6 (1997). Sequences can be manually analyzed for features commonly associated with signal sequences, as described in, e.g., European Patent Application (Appn) No. 0 621 337, Zheng and Nicchitta (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274(51): 36623-30, and Ng et al. (1996) J. Cell Biol. 134(2):269-78.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional Aspects\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny polypeptide of the invention (including any fusion protein of the invention) may be present as part of a larger polypeptide sequence, such as occurs upon the addition of one or more domains or subsequences for stabilization or detection or purification of the polypeptide. Such domains or subsequences may be covalently fused to the polypeptide of the invention, as one of skill would readily understand and be able to construct. A polypeptide purification subsequence may include, e.g., an epitope tag, a FLAG tag, a polyhistidine sequence, a GST fusion, or any other detection/purification subsequence or “tag” known in the art. These additional domains or subsequences either have little or no effect on the activity of the polypeptide of the invention, or can be removed by post synthesis processing steps such as by treatment with a protease, inclusion of an intein, or the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny polypeptide of the invention (including any fusion protein of the invention) may also comprise one or more modified amino acid. The modified amino acid may be, e.g., a glycosylated amino acid, a PEGylated amino acid, a farnesylated amino acid, an acetylated amino acid, a biotinylated amino acid, an amino acid conjugated to a lipid moiety, and/or an amino acid conjugated to an organic derivatizing agent. The presence of modified amino acids may be advantageous in, for example, (a) increasing polypeptide serum half-life and/or functional in vivo half-life, (b) reducing polypeptide antigenicity or immunogenicity, (c) increasing polypeptide storage stability, (d) increasing bioavailability, (e) decreasing effector function, and/or (f) decreasing or inhibiting undesired self-association (e.g., aggregate formation) between two or more molecules of the invention (such as between two or more fusion protein dimers of the invention). Amino acid(s) are modified, for example, co-translationally or post-translationally during recombinant production (e.g., N-linked glycosylation at N-X-S/T motifs during expression in mammalian cells) or modified by synthetic means.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolypeptides of the invention (including fusion proteins of the invention) described herein can be further modified in a variety of ways by, e.g., post-translational modification and/or synthetic modification or variation. For example, polypeptides or fusion proteins of the invention may be suitably glycosylated, typically via expression in a mammalian cell. For example, in one aspect, the invention provides glycosylated polypeptides that are capable of binding CD86 and/or CD80, and/or have an ability to suppress an immune response (e.g., T cell proliferation or activation) as described elsewhere herein, wherein each said glycosylated polypeptide comprises a polypeptide sequence having at least 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100% identity to a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS:1-79, 197-200, 205-214, and 219-222.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe polypeptides of the invention can be subject to any number of additional forms suitable of post translational and/or synthetic modification or variation. For example, the invention provides protein mimetics of the polypeptides of the invention. Peptide mimetics are described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,668,110 and the references cited therein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, a polypeptide or fusion protein of the invention can be modified by the addition of protecting groups to the side chains of one or more the amino acids of the polypeptide or fusion protein. Such protecting groups can facilitate transport of the polypeptide or fusion protein through membrane(s), if desired, or through certain tissue(s), for example, by reducing the hydrophilicity and increasing the lipophilicity of the polypeptide or fusion protein. Examples of suitable protecting groups include ester protecting groups, amine protecting groups, acyl protecting groups, and carboxylic acid protecting groups, which are known in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,121,236). Synthetic fusion proteins of the invention can take any suitable form. For example, the fusion protein can be structurally modified from its naturally occurring configuration to form a cyclic peptide or other structurally modified peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolypeptides of the invention also can be linked to one or more nonproteinaceous polymers, typically a hydrophilic synthetic polymer, e.g., polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylene glycol, or polyoxyalkylene, using techniques well known in the art, such as described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,179,337, 4,301,144, 4,496,689, 4,640,835, 4,670,417, and 4,791,192, or a similar polymer such as polyvinylalcohol or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention includes conjugates comprising at least one polypeptide of the invention (e.g., mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide, dimeric or monomeric mutant CTLA-4-Ig, multimeric mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide, multimeric mutant CTLA-4-Ig) and a non-polypeptide moiety. The term “conjugate” (or interchangeably “conjugated polypeptide”) is intended to indicate a heterogeneous (in the sense of composite or chimeric) molecule formed by the covalent attachment of one or more polypeptide(s) to one or more non-polypeptide moieties. The term “covalent attachment” means that the polypeptide and the non-polypeptide moiety are either directly covalently joined to one another, or else are indirectly covalently joined to one another through an intervening moiety or moieties, such as a bridge, spacer, or linkage moiety or moieties using an attachment group present in the polypeptide. Preferably, the conjugate is soluble at relevant concentrations and conditions, i.e., soluble in physiological fluids, such as blood. Examples of conjugated polypeptides of the invention include glycosylated and/or PEGylated polypeptides. The term “non-conjugated polypeptide” may be used about the polypeptide part of the conjugate. Such a conjugate typically binds CD80 (e.g., hCD80) and/or CD86 (e.g., hCD86) and/or an extracellular domain of either or both (including hCD80-Ig and/or hCD86-Ig), and/or has an ability to inhibit an immune response. Such an immune response can comprise, but is not limited to, e.g., T cell activation or proliferation, cytokine synthesis/production, induction of activation markers, production of inflammatory molecules, inflammation, anti-collagen Ab production, and/or T cell-dependent Ab response. Exemplary polypeptides include those having at least 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% identity to a sequence selected from the group of SEQ ID NOS: 1-79, 197-200, 205-214, and 219-222.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “non-polypeptide moiety” is intended to indicate a molecule that is capable of conjugating to an attachment group of a polypeptide of the invention. Preferred examples of such molecule include polymer molecules, sugar moieties, lipophilic compounds, or organic derivatizing agents.

Although the asparagine residue of the N-glycosylation site is the one to which the sugar moiety is attached during glycosylation, such attachment cannot be achieved unless the other amino acid residues of the N-glycosylation site is present. Accordingly, when the non-polypeptide moiety is a sugar moiety and the conjugation is to be achieved by N-glycosylation, the term “amino acid residue comprising an attachment group for the non-polypeptide moiety” as used in connection with alterations of the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide of the invention is to be understood as one, two or all of the amino acid residues constituting an N-glycosylation site is/are to be altered in such a manner that either a functional N-glycosylation site is introduced into the amino acid sequence, removed from said sequence or a functional N-glycosylation site is retained in the amino acid sequence (e.g., by substituting a serine residue, which already constitutes part of an N-glycosylation site, with a threonine residue and vice versa).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “introduce” (i.e., an “introduced” amino acid residue, “introduction” of an amino acid residue) is primarily intended to mean substitution of an existing amino acid residue for another amino acid residue, but may also mean insertion of an additional amino acid residue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “remove” (i.e., a “removed” amino acid residue, “removal” of an amino acid residue) is primarily intended to mean substitution of the amino acid residue to be removed for another amino acid residue, but may also mean deletion (without substitution) of the amino acid residue to be removed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “amino acid residue comprising an attachment group for the non-polypeptide moiety” is intended to indicate that the amino acid residue is one to which the non-polypeptide moiety binds (in the case of an introduced amino acid residue) or would have bound (in the case of a removed amino acid residue).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy removing and/or introducing amino acid residues comprising an attachment group for the non-polypeptide moiety it is possible to specifically adapt the polypeptide of the invention so as to make the molecule more susceptible to conjugation to the non-polypeptide moiety of choice, to optimize the conjugation pattern (e.g., to ensure an optimal distribution of non-polypeptide moieties on the surface of the polypeptide and thereby, e.g., effectively shield epitopes and other surface parts of the polypeptide without significantly impairing the function thereof). For instance, by introduction of attachment groups, the polypeptide is altered in the content of the specific amino acid residues to which the relevant non-polypeptide moiety binds, whereby a more efficient, specific and/or extensive conjugation is achieved. By removal of one or more attachment groups it is possible to avoid conjugation to the non-polypeptide moiety in parts of the polypeptide in which such conjugation is disadvantageous, e.g., to an amino acid residue located at or near a functional site of the polypeptide (since conjugation at such a site may result in inactivation or reduced CD80- or CD86-binding or reduced immunosuppressive activity of the resulting conjugate). Further, it may be advantageous to remove an attachment group located close to another attachment group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino acid residue comprising an attachment group for a non-polypeptide moiety, whether an existing residue or a removed or introduced residue, is selected on the basis of the nature of the non-polypeptide moiety and, in some instances, on the basis of the conjugation method to be used. For instance, when the non-polypeptide moiety is a polymer molecule, such as a polyethylene glycol (PEG) or polyalkylene oxide (POA) derived molecule, amino acid residues capable of functioning as an attachment group may be selected from the group consisting of cysteine, lysine (and/or the N-terminal amino group of the polypeptide), aspartic acid, glutamic acid, histidine and arginine. When the non-polypeptide moiety is a sugar moiety, the attachment group is an in vivo or in vitro N- or O-glycosylation site, preferably an N-glycosylation site.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some instances, in the mutant CTLA-4 polypeptide part of a conjugate of the invention, attachment groups located at or near the receptor binding sites are removed, such as by substitution of the amino acid residue comprising such group. In some instances, amino acid residues comprising an attachment group for a non-polypeptide moiety, such as cysteine or lysine, are often not introduced at or near the receptor binding site of the mutant CTLA-4 polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA mutant CTLA-4 polypeptide of the invention can be modified so as to shield and thereby modify or destroy or otherwise inactivate an epitope present in the mutant CTLA-4 polypeptide, by conjugation to a non-polypeptide moiety. Epitopes of mutant CTLA-4 polypeptides may be identified by use of methods known in the art, also known as epitope mapping, see e.g., Romagnoli et al., J. Biol. Chem. 380(5):553-9 (1999), DeLisser H M, Methods Mol Biol, 1999, 96:11-20, Van de Water et al., Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 85(3):229-35 (1997), Saint-Remy J M, Toxicology 119(1):77-81 (1997).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe exact number of attachment groups available for conjugation and present in the mutant CTLA-4 polypeptide is dependent on the effect desired to be achieved by conjugation. The effect to be obtained is, e.g., dependent on the nature and degree of conjugation (e.g., the identity of the non-polypeptide moiety, the number of non-polypeptide moieties desirable or possible to conjugate to the polypeptide, where they should be conjugated or where conjugation should be avoided, etc.). For instance, if reduced immunogenicity is desired, the number (and location of) attachment groups should be sufficient to shield most or all epitopes. This is normally obtained when a greater proportion of the mutant CTLA-4 polypeptide is shielded. Effective shielding of epitopes is normally achieved when the total number of attachment groups available for conjugation is in the range of 1-6 attachment groups, e.g., 1-5, such as in the range of 1-3, such as 1, 2, or 3 attachment groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFunctional in vivo half-life can be dependent on the molecular weight of the conjugate, and the number of attachment groups needed for providing increased half-life thus depends on the molecular weight of the non-polypeptide moiety in question. Some such conjugates comprise 1-6, e.g., 1-5, such as 1-3, e.g., 1, 2, or 3 non-polypeptide moieties each having a molecular weight of about 100-2000 Daltons (Da), such as about 200 Da, about 300 Da, about 400 Da, about 600 Da, about 900 Da, about 1000 Da, or about 2-40 kDa, such as about 2 kDa, about 5 kDa, about 12 kDa, about 15 kDa, about 20 kDa, about 30 kDa, about 40 kDa, or about 60 kDa.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the conjugate of the invention, some, most, or substantially all conjugatable attachment groups are occupied by the relevant non-polypeptide moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe conjugate of the invention may exhibit one or more of the following improved properties: (a) increased serum half-life and/or functional in vivo half-life, (b) reduced antigenicity or immunogenicity, (c) increased storage stability, (d) increased bioavailability, (e) decreased effector function, or (f) decreased or inhibited self-association (e.g., decreased aggregate formation) between two or more molecules of the invention. For example, the conjugate may exhibit a reduced immunogenicity as compared to hCTLA-4 or as compared to the corresponding non-conjugated polypeptide, e.g., a reduction of at least 10%, such as a reduction of at least of 25%, such as a reduction of at least of 50%, e.g., a reduction of at least 75% compared to the non-conjugated polypeptide or compared to a hCTLA-4. The conjugate may exhibit an increased functional in vivo half-life and/or increased serum half-life as compared to a reference molecule, such as hCTLA-4 or as compared to the corresponding non-conjugated polypeptide. Particular preferred conjugates are such conjugates where the ratio between the functional in vivo half-life (or serum half-life) of said conjugate and the functional in vivo half-life (or serum half-life) of said reference molecule is at least 1.25, such as at least 1.50, such as at least 1.75, such as at least 2, such as at least 3, such as at least 4, such as at least 5, such as at least 6, such as at least 7, such as at least 8. The half-life is conveniently determined in an experimental animal, such as rat or monkey, and may be based on intravenously or subcutaneously administration. In a further aspect, the conjugate may exhibit an increased bioavailability as compared to a reference molecule such as an hCTLA-4 or a corresponding non-conjugated polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe polymer molecule to be coupled to the polypeptide may be any suitable polymer molecule, such as a natural or synthetic homopolymer or heteropolymer, typically with a molecular weight in the range of 300-100,000 Da, such as 300-20,000 Da, more preferably in the range of 500-10,000 Da, even more preferably in the range of 500-5000 Da.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of homopolymers include a polyol (i.e. poly-OH), a polyamine (i.e. poly-NH\n2\n) and a polycarboxylic acid (i.e. poly-COOH). A heteropolymer is a polymer, which comprises one or more different coupling groups, such as, e.g., a hydroxyl group and an amine group. Examples of suitable polymer molecules include polymer molecules selected from the group consisting of polyalkylene oxide (PAO), including polyalkylene glycol (PAG), such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) and polypropylene glycol (PPG), branched PEGs, poly-vinyl alcohol (PVA), poly-carboxylate, poly-(vinylpyrolidone), polyethylene-co-maleic acid anhydride, polystyrene-co-malic acid anhydride, dextran including carboxymethyl-dextran, or any other biopolymer suitable for reducing immunogenicity and/or increasing functional in vivo half-life and/or serum half-life. Another example of a polymer molecule is human albumin or another abundant plasma protein. Generally, polyalkylene glycol-derived polymers are biocompatible, non-toxic, non-antigenic, non-immunogenic, have various water solubility properties, and are easily excreted from living organisms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPEG is the preferred polymer molecule to be used, since it has only few reactive groups capable of cross-linking compared, e.g., to polysaccharides such as dextran, and the like. In particular, monofunctional PEG, e.g., monomethoxypolyethylene glycol (mPEG), is of interest since its coupling chemistry is relatively simple (only one reactive group is available for conjugating with attachment groups on the polypeptide). Consequently, the risk of cross-linking is eliminated, the resulting polypeptide conjugates are more homogeneous and the reaction of the polymer molecules with the polypeptide is easier to control. When the molecule is PEGylated, it usually comprises 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules. Each PEG molecule can have a molecular weight of about 5 kDa (kilo Dalton) to 100 kDa, including, e.g., about 10 kDa, about 12 kDa, about 20 kDa, about 40 kDa. Suitable PEG molecules are available from Shearwater Polymers, Inc. and Enzon, Inc. and may be selected from SS-PEG, NPC-PEG, aldehyde-PEG, mPEG-SPA, mPEG-SCM, mPEG-BTC, SC-PEG, tresylated mPEG (U.S. Pat. No. 5,880,255), or oxycarbonyl-oxy-N-dicarboxylmide-PEG (U.S. Pat. No. 5,122,614).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention provides an isolated or synthetic conjugate comprising: (a) a polypeptide of the invention (e.g., mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide, dimeric or monomeric mutant CTLA-4-Ig, multimeric mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide, multimeric mutant CTLA-4-Ig); and (b) at least one non-polypeptide moiety, such as, e.g., 1-10, 1-9, 1-8, 1-7, 1-7, 1-6, 1-5, 1-4, 1-3, 1, 2, or 3 non-polypeptide moieties attached to the polypeptide, wherein the conjugate binds CD80 (e.g., hCD80) and/or CD86 (e.g., hCD86) and/or an extracellular domain of either or both (including hCD80-Ig and/or hCD86-Ig), and/or has an ability to induce an immune response (e.g., T cell-dependent immune response). Exemplary polypeptides include those having at least 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% identity to a polypeptide sequence selected from the group of SEQ ID NOS:1-79, 197-200, 205-214, and 219-222. In some instances, the conjugate comprises one non-polypeptide moiety. In some instances, the conjugate comprises two, three, four or more non-polypeptide moieties. In some instances, the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide of the conjugate further comprises one or more substitutions which each introduce an attachment group for the non-polypeptide moiety (e.g., by substitution of an amino acid residue of the polypeptide sequence with a different residue which comprises an attachment group for the non-polypeptide moiety, or by insertion into the polypeptide sequence of an additional amino acid residue which comprises an attachment group for the non-polypeptide moiety).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA conjugate can comprise two or more polypeptides of the invention. In some instances, a non-polypeptide moiety is covalently attached to either or both such polypeptides. If the conjugate comprises two or more identical polypeptides of the invention, the same type and number of non-polypeptide moieties are typically attached to each such polypeptide, usually in the same manner to the corresponding attachment group(s) on each polypeptide. As noted above, the non-polypeptide moiety can comprise, e.g., a sugar molecule, which optionally can be attached to an N-glycosylation site, or a polymer, such as, e.g., a polyethylene glycol moiety. The polyethylene glycol moiety can be covalently attached to a cysteine residue or lysine residue of the polypeptide of the invention. In some instances, the polyethylene glycol moiety is covalently attached to the N-terminal amino group of the polypeptide. A conjugate comprising a mutant CTLA-4-Ig of the invention may be described as a mutant CTLA-4-Ig conjugate of the invention. Multimers of conjugates are also included. Multimeric conjugates include two or more conjugates, wherein at least one conjugate is a conjugate of the invention comprising at least one polypeptide of the invention. The conjugates in a multimeric conjugate can be, but need not be, identical to one another.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs discussed above, polypeptides of the invention, including fusion proteins of the invention, can commonly be subject to glycosylation. Polypeptides and fusion proteins of the invention can further be subject to (or modified such that they are subjected to) other forms of post-translational modification including, e.g., hydroxylation, lipid or lipid derivative-attachment, methylation, myristylation, pegylation, phosphorylation, and sulfation. Other post-translational modifications that a polypeptide or fusion protein of the invention can be rendered subject to include acetylation, acylation, ADP-ribosylation, amidation, covalent attachment of flavin, covalent attachment of a heme moiety, covalent attachment of a nucleotide or nucleotide derivative, covalent attachment of phosphotidylinositol, cross-linking, cyclization, disulfide bond formation, demethylation, formylation, GPI anchor formation, iodination, oxidation, proteolytic processing, prenylation, racemization, selenoylation, arginylation, and ubiquitination. Other common protein modifications are described in, e.g., Creighton, supra, Seifter et al., Meth. Enzymol. 18:626-646 (1990), and Rattan et al., Ann. NY Acad. Sci. 663:48-62 (1992). Post-translational modifications for polypeptides or fusion proteins expressed from nucleic acids in host cells vary depending what kind of host or host cell type the peptide is expressed in. For instance, glycosylation often does not occur in bacterial hosts such as \nE. coli \nand varies considerably in baculovirus systems as compared to mammalian cell systems. Accordingly, when glycosylation is desired (which usually is the case for most polypeptides of the present invention), a polypeptide or fusion protein should be expressed (produced) in a glycosylating host, generally a eukaryotic cell (e.g., a mammalian cell or an insect cell). Modifications to the polypeptide or fusion protein in terms of post-translational modification can be verified by any suitable technique, including, e.g., x-ray diffraction, NMR imaging, mass spectrometry, and/or chromatography (e.g., reverse phase chromatography, affinity chromatography, or GLC).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe polypeptide or fusion protein also or alternatively can comprise any suitable number of non-naturally occurring amino acids (e.g., β amino acids) and/or alternative amino acids (e.g., selenocysteine), or amino acid analogs, such as those listed in the M\nANUAL OF \nP\nATENT \nE\nXAMINING \nP\nROCEDURE §\n2422 (7th Revision—2000), which can be incorporated by protein synthesis, such as through solid phase protein synthesis (as described in, e.g., Merrifield, Adv. Enzymol. 32:221-296 (1969) and other references cited herein). A polypeptide or fusion protein of the invention can further be modified by the inclusion of at least one modified amino acid. The inclusion of one or more modified amino acids may be advantageous in, for example, (a) increasing polypeptide or fusion protein serum half-life, (b) reducing polypeptide or fusion protein antigenicity, or (c) increasing polypeptide or fusion protein storage stability. Amino acid(s) are modified, for example, co-translationally or post-translationally during recombinant production (e.g., N-linked glycosylation site at N-X-S/T motifs during expression in mammalian cells) or modified by synthetic means. Non-limiting examples of a modified amino acid include a glycosylated amino acid, a sulfated amino acid, a prenylated (e.g., farnesylated, geranylgeranylated) amino acid, an acetylated amino acid, an acylated amino acid, a PEGylated amino acid, a biotinylated amino acid, a carboxylated amino acid, a phosphorylated amino acid, and the like. References adequate to guide one of skill in the modification of amino acids are replete throughout the literature. Example protocols are found in Walker (1998) Protein Protocols on CD-ROM Humana Press, Towata, N.J. The modified amino acid may be selected from a glycosylated amino acid, a PEGylated amino acid, a farnesylated amino acid, an acetylated amino acid, a biotinylated amino acid, an amino acid conjugated to a lipid moiety, and an amino acid conjugated to an organic derivatizing agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention further provides polypeptides (including fusion proteins) having the above-described characteristics that further comprise additional amino acid sequences that impact the biological function (e.g., immunogenicity, targeting, and/or half-life) of the polypeptide (or fusion protein).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA polypeptide or fusion protein of the invention may further include a targeting sequence other than, or in addition to, a signal sequence. For example, the polypeptide or fusion protein can comprise a sequence that targets a receptor on a particular cell type (e.g., a monocyte, dendritic cell, or associated cell) to provide targeted delivery of the polypeptide to such cells and/or related tissues. Signal sequences are described above, and include membrane localization/anchor sequences (e.g., stop transfer sequences, GPI anchor sequences), and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA particularly useful fusion partner for a polypeptide of the invention (including a fusion protein of the invention) is a peptide sequence that facilitates purification of the polypeptide, e.g., a polypeptide purification subsequence. A polynucleotide of the invention may comprise a coding sequence fused in-frame to a marker amino acid sequence that, e.g., facilitates purification of the encoded polypeptide. Such purification facilitating peptide domains or polypeptide purification subsequences include, but are not limited to, metal chelating peptides, such as histidine-tryptophan modules that allow purification on immobilized metals, such as a hexa-histidine peptide or other a polyhistidine sequence, a sequence encoding such a tag is incorporated in the pQE vector available from QIAGEN, Inc. (Chatsworth, Calif.), a sequence which binds glutathione (e.g., glutathione-S-transferase (GST)), a hemagglutinin (HA) tag (corresponding to an epitope derived from the influenza hemagglutinin protein; Wilson et al., Cell 37:767 (1984)), maltose binding protein sequences, the FLAG epitope utilized in the FLAGS extension/affinity purification system (Immunex Corp, Seattle, Wash.) (commercially available FLAG epitopes also are available through Kodak (New Haven, Conn.)), an E-epitope tag (E-tag), thioredoxin (TRX), avidin, and the like. Purification-facilitating epitope tags have been described in the art (see, e.g., Whitehorn et al., Biotechnology 13:1215-19 (1995)). A polypeptide can include an e-his tag, which may comprise a polyhistidine sequence and an anti-e-epitope sequence (Pharmacia Biotech Catalog); e-his tags can be made by standard techniques. The inclusion of a protease-cleavable polypeptide linker sequence between the purification domain and the polypeptide is useful to facilitate purification. The histidine residues facilitate purification on IMIAC (immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC), as described in Porath et al. Protein Expression and Purification 3:263-281 (1992)), while the enterokinase cleavage site provides a method for separating the polypeptide from the fusion protein. pGEX vectors (Promega; Madison, Wis.) can also be used to express foreign polypeptides as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase (GST). In general, such fusion proteins are soluble and can easily be purified from lysed cells by adsorption to ligand-agarose beads (e.g., glutathione-agarose in the case of GST-fusion) followed by elution in the presence of free ligand. Additional examples of polypeptide purification facilitating subsequences and the use thereof for protein purification are described in, e.g., Int'l Patent Appn Publ. No. WO 00/15823. After expression of the polypeptide of interest and isolation thereof by such fusion partners or otherwise as described above, protein refolding steps can be used, as desired, in completing configuration of the mature polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA fusion protein of the invention also can include one or more additional peptide fragments or peptide portions which promote detection of the fusion protein. For example, a reporter peptide fragment or portion (e.g., green fluorescent protein (GFP), β-galactosidase, or a detectable domain thereof) can be incorporated in the fusion protein. Additional marker molecules that can be conjugated to the polypeptide of the invention include radionuclides, enzymes, fluorophores, small molecule ligands, and the like. Such detection-promoting fusion partners are particularly useful in fusion proteins used in diagnostic techniques discussed elsewhere herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, a polypeptide of the invention can comprise a fusion partner that promotes stability of the polypeptide, secretion of the polypeptide (other than by signal targeting), or both. For example, the polypeptide can comprise an immunoglobulin (Ig) domain, such as an IgG polypeptide comprising an Fc hinge region, a CH2 domain, and a CH3 domain, that promotes stability and/or secretion of the polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe fusion protein peptide fragments or peptide portions can be associated in any suitable manner. The various polypeptide fragments or portions of the fusion protein may be covalently associated (e.g., by means of a peptide or disulfide bond). The polypeptide fragments or portions can be directly fused (e.g., the C-terminus of an antigenic or immunogenic sequence of the invention can be fused to the N-terminus of a purification sequence or heterologous immunogenic sequence). The fusion protein can include any suitable number of modified bonds, e.g., isosteres, within or between the peptide portions. Alternatively or additionally, the fusion protein can include a peptide linker between one or more polypeptide fragments or portions that includes one or more amino acid sequences not forming part of the biologically active peptide portions. Any suitable peptide linker can be used. Such a linker can be any suitable size. Typically, the linker is less than about 30 amino acid residues, less than about 20 amino acid residues, and/or less than 10 amino acid residues. The linker predominantly may comprise or consist of neutral amino acid residues. Suitable linkers are generally described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,990,275, 6,010,883, 6,197,946, and \nEuropean Patent Application\n 0 035 384. If separation of peptide fragments or peptide portions is desirable a linker that facilitates separation can be used. An example of such a linker is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,719,326. “Flexible” linkers, which are typically composed of combinations of glycine and/or serine residues, can be advantageous. Examples of such linkers are described in, e.g., McCafferty et al., Nature 348:552-554 (1990), Huston et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879-5883 (1988), Glockshuber et al., Biochemistry 29:1362-1367 (1990), and Cheadle et al., Molecular Immunol. 29:21-30 (1992), Bird et al., Science 242:423-26 (1988), and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,672,683, 6,165,476, and 6,132,992.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe use of a linker also can reduce undesired immune response to the fusion protein created by the fusion of the two peptide fragments or peptide portions, which can result in an unintended MHC I and/or MHC II epitope being present in the fusion protein. In addition to the use of a linker, identified undesirable epitope sequences or adjacent sequences can be PEGylated (e.g., by insertion of lysine residues to promote PEG attachment) to shield identified epitopes from exposure. Other techniques for reducing immunogenicity of the fusion protein of the invention can be used in association with the administration of the fusion protein include the techniques provided in U.S. Pat. No. 6,093,699.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMaking Polypeptides\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecombinant methods for producing and isolating polypeptides of the invention (including fusion proteins of the invention) are described below. In addition to recombinant production, the polypeptides may be produced by direct peptide synthesis using solid-phase techniques (see, e.g., Stewart et al. (1969) Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis, W.H. Freeman Co, San Francisco; Merrifield (1963) J. Am. Chem. Soc 85:2149-2154). Peptide synthesis may be performed using manual techniques or by automation. Automated synthesis may be achieved, for example, using Applied Biosystems 431A Peptide Synthesizer (Perkin Elmer, Foster City, Calif.) in accordance with the instructions provided by the manufacturer. For example, subsequences may be chemically synthesized separately and combined using chemical methods to provide mutant CTLA-4 polypeptides or functional fragments thereof. Alternatively, such sequences may be ordered from any number of companies that specialize in production of polypeptides. Most commonly, polypeptides of the invention are produced by expressing coding nucleic acids and recovering polypeptides, e.g., as described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention provides methods for producing polypeptides (including fusion proteins) of the invention. One such method comprises introducing into a population of cells any nucleic acid described herein, which is operatively linked to a regulatory sequence effective to produce the encoded polypeptide, culturing the cells in a culture medium to produce the polypeptide, and isolating the polypeptide from the cells or from the culture medium. An amount of nucleic acid sufficient to facilitate uptake by the cells (transfection) and/or expression of the polypeptide is utilized. The culture medium can be any described herein and in the Examples. Additional media are known to those of skill in the art. The nucleic acid is introduced into such cells by any delivery method described herein, including, e.g., injection, needleless injection device, gene gun, electroporation (e.g., DNA electroporation device, Inovio Biomedical Corp. (San Diego)), transdermal delivery, passive uptake, etc. The nucleic acid of the invention may be part of a vector, such as a recombinant expression vector, including a DNA plasmid vector, viral vector, or any vector described herein. The nucleic acid or vector comprising a nucleic acid of the invention may be prepared and formulated as described herein, above, and in the Examples below. Such a nucleic acid or expression vector may be introduced into a population of cells of a mammal in vivo, or selected cells of the mammal (e.g., tumor cells) may be removed from the mammal and the nucleic acid expression vector introduced ex vivo into the population of such cells in an amount sufficient such that uptake and expression of the encoded polypeptide results. Or, a nucleic acid or vector comprising a nucleic acid of the invention is produced using cultured cells in vitro. In one aspect, the method of producing a polypeptide of the invention comprises introducing into a population of cells a recombinant expression vector comprising any nucleic acid described herein in an amount and formula such that uptake of the vector and expression of the polypeptide will result; administering the expression vector into a mammal by any introduction/delivery format described herein; and isolating the polypeptide from the mammal or from a byproduct of the mammal. Suitable host cells, expression vectors, methods for transfecting host cells with an expression vector comprising a nucleic acid sequence encoding a polypeptide of the invention, cell cultures, and procedures for producing and recovering such polypeptide from a cell culture are described in detail below in the section entitled “Nucleic Acids of the Invention.” Additional methods of production are discussed in the Examples, infra.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs noted above, polypeptides of the invention (which includes fusion proteins of the invention) can be subject to various changes, such as one or more amino acid or nucleic acid insertions, deletions, and substitutions, either conservative or non-conservative, including where, e.g., such changes might provide for certain advantages in their use, e.g., in their therapeutic or prophylactic use or administration or diagnostic application. Procedures for making variants of polypeptides by using amino acid substitutions, deletions, insertions, and additions are routine in the art. Polypeptides and variants thereof having the desired ability to bind CD80 and/or CD86, or a fragment thereof (e.g., ECD) or an ability to suppress an immune response in vitro or in vivo as described in detail elsewhere herein are readily identified by assays known to those of skill in the art and by the assays described herein. See, e.g., assays presented in the Examples below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nucleic acids of the invention, discussed in greater detail infra, can also be subject to various changes, such as one or more substitutions of one or more nucleic acids in one or more codons such that a particular codon encodes the same or a different amino acid, resulting in either a conservative or non-conservative substitution, or one or more deletions of one or more nucleic acids in the sequence. The nucleic acids can also be modified to include one or more codons that provide for optimum expression in an expression system (e.g., mammalian cell or mammalian expression system), while, if desired, said one or more codons still encode the same amino acid(s). Procedures for making variants of nucleic acids by using nucleic acid substitutions, deletions, insertions, and additions, and degenerate codons, are routine in the art, and nucleic acid variants encoding polypeptides having the desired properties described herein (e.g., an ability to bind CD80 and/or CD86, and/or suppress an immune response in vitro or in vivo) are readily identified using the assays described herein. Such nucleic acid changes might provide for certain advantages in their therapeutic or prophylactic use or administration, or diagnostic application. In one aspect, the nucleic acids and polypeptides can be modified in a number of ways so long as they comprise a nucleic acid or polypeptide sequence substantially identical to the nucleic acid sequence of a respective mutant CTLA-4 polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid or mutant CTLA-4 polypeptide of the invention, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic Acids of the Invention\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention provides isolated or recombinant nucleic acids (also referred to herein as polynucleotides), collectively referred to as “nucleic acids of the invention” (or “polynucleotides of the invention”), which encode polypeptides of the invention. Nucleic acids of the invention, including all described below, are useful in recombinant production (e.g., expression) of polypeptides of the invention, typically through expression of a plasmid expression vector comprising a sequence encoding the polypeptide or fragment thereof; as therapeutics; as prophylactics; as diagnostic tools; as diagnostic probes for the presence of complementary or partially complementary nucleic acids (including for detection of a wild-type CTLA-4 nucleic acid). For example, nucleic acids of the invention, including all described below, are useful because they encode polypeptides that are useful in suppressing or inhibiting an immune response (e.g., T cell activation, T cell proliferation, cytokine synthesis or production (e.g., production of TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-2), induction of activation markers (e.g., CD25, IL-2 receptor), inflammation, anti-collagen antibody production, and/or T cell-dependent antibody response) in vitro and/or in vivo applications, including, e.g., prophylactic and/or therapeutic methods for treating immune system diseases, disorders, and conditions in which suppression of an immune response is desirable (e.g., methods for treating autoimmune diseases and disorders and methods for inhibiting rejection of a tissue, cell, or organ transplant from a donor by a recipient). Nucleic acids of the invention can also be incorporated into expression vectors useful for gene therapy, DNA vaccination, and immunosuppressive therapy. Additional uses of the nucleic acids and vectors of the invention comprising such nucleic acids are described elsewhere herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention provides an isolated or recombinant nucleic acid comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding any polypeptide (including any fusion protein, etc.) of the invention described above in the section entitled “Polypeptides of the Invention” and elsewhere herein. The invention also provides an isolated or recombinant nucleic acid comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a combination of two or more of any polypeptides (including any fusion proteins) of the invention described above and elsewhere herein. Also included is a nucleic acid that encodes any polypeptide of the invention, such as, e.g., a mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide or mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein, which comprises a sequence of codons substantially optimized for expression in a mammalian host, such as a human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, in one aspect, the invention provides an isolated or recombinant nucleic acid comprising a polynucleotide sequence that encodes a polypeptide comprising a polypeptide sequence that has at least 75%, 80%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.5%, or 100% sequence identity to at least one polypeptide sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS:1-73, or a complementary polynucleotide sequence thereof, wherein the polypeptide binds CD80 and/or CD86 or a polypeptide fragment of CD80 and/or CD86 (e.g., an extracellular domain of CD80 and/or CD86), and/or suppress an immune response in vitro and/or in vivo, or a complementary polynucleotide sequence thereof. Additional details regarding the functional properties and characteristics of such polypeptides are discussed above in “Polypeptides of the Invention.” Some such nucleic acids encode a polypeptide comprising a polypeptide sequence having an amino acid length about equal to the amino acid length of the hCTLA-4 ECD; as, e.g., 110-138, 112-132, 118-130, 119-129, 120-128, 121-127, 122-126, 123-125, or 124 amino acid residues. Exemplary nucleic acids which encode the mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptides comprising the sequences set forth in SEQ ID NOS:1-73, but are not limited to, e.g., nucleic acids having nucleotide sequences set forth in SEQ ID NOS:80-152, respectively. For example, an exemplary nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide shown in SEQ ID NO:1 (clone D3-1) is the nucleic acid shown in SEQ ID:80. Also included are fragments of any such nucleic acids, wherein such fragment encodes a polypeptide that binds CD80 and/or CD86 and/or an ECD of either or both, and/or has an ability to suppress an immune response.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides an isolated or recombinant nucleic acid comprising a polynucleotide sequence which encodes a polypeptide (e.g., mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide) which comprises a polypeptide sequence (a) which differs from a polypeptide sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS:1-73 in no more than 6 amino acid residues (e.g., no more than 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 amino acid residues), and (b) wherein the amino acid residue in the polypeptide sequence at \n \nposition\n \n 41, 50, 54, 55, 56, 64, 65, 70, or 85 is identical to the amino acid residue at the corresponding position of said polypeptide sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS:1-73, wherein the polypeptide binds CD80 and/or CD86 and/or an extracellular domain of either or both, and/or inhibits an immune response in vitro and/or in vivo, or a complementary polynucleotide sequence thereof. That is, the amino acid residue at \n \nsuch position\n \n 41, 50, 54, 55, 56, 64, 65, 70, or 85 in such selected polypeptide sequence is not deleted or substituted. Some such nucleic acids encode polypeptides comprising a sequence which differs from the selected polypeptide sequence by no more than 6 amino acid residues and which includes amino acid residues at 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and/or 14 positions selected from amino acid positions 24, 30, 32, 41, 50, 54, 55, 56, 64, 65, 70, 85, 104 and 106 that are identical to the amino acid residues at the corresponding positions in the selected polypeptide sequence. Such polypeptides can differ from the selected polypeptide sequence by amino acid deletion(s), addition(s), and/or amino acid substitution(s). An amino acid substitution may be a conservative or non-conservative substitution. Exemplary conservative substitutions are discussed in the section entitled “Sequence Variation.” Some such polypeptides comprise a sequence having a length of about 118-130, 119-129, 120-128, 121-127, 122-126, 123-125, or 124 amino acid residues. Additional details of the functional properties and characteristics of such polypeptides are discussed above. Exemplary nucleic acids include, but are not limited to, e.g., those comprising nucleotide sequences set forth in SEQ ID NOS:80-152.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides an isolated or recombinant nucleic acid comprising a polynucleotide sequence which encodes a polypeptide (e.g., mutant CTLA-4 ECD) comprising a polypeptide sequence which (a) differs from the polypeptide sequence of the extracellular domain of human CTLA-4 shown in SEQ ID NO:159 in no more than 6 amino acid residues, and (b) comprises at least one amino acid substitution at an amino acid position corresponding to position 50, 54, 55, 56, 64, 65, 70, or 85 relative to the polypeptide sequence of SEQ ID NO:159, wherein the polypeptide binds hCD80 and/or hCD86 and/or an ECD of either or both, and/or inhibits an immune response in vitro and/or in vivo, or a complementary polynucleotide sequence thereof.

Additional details of the functional properties and characteristics of such fusion proteins are discussed above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides an isolated or recombinant nucleic acid comprising a polynucleotide sequence which encodes a protein dimer (e.g., mutant CTLA-4-Ig dimer) comprising two monomeric fusion proteins (e.g., monomeric mutant CTLA-4 Ig), each monomeric fusion protein comprising: (a) a polypeptide (e.g., mutant CTLA-4 ECD) comprising a polypeptide sequence having at least 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.5%, or 100% identity to at least one polypeptide sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS:1-73, and (b) an Ig polypeptide, wherein the fusion protein dimer binds CD80 and/or CD86 (and/or CD80-Ig and/or CD86-Ig), and/or has an ability to inhibit or suppress an immune response, or a complementary polynucleotide sequence thereof. The two monomeric fusion proteins, upon expression, are linked together via at least one disulfide bond formed between two cysteine residues present in each monomeric mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein. The Ig polypeptide may comprise an Ig Fc polypeptide, including, e.g., an Ig Fc polypeptide comprising a sequence having at least 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% identity to a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS:184-186 and 218. In some instances, the C-terminus of the polypeptide of (a) is covalently linked or fused to the N-terminus of the Ig Fc polypeptide of (b). Additional details of the functional properties and characteristics of such dimers are discussed above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA stop codon (e.g., tga) is typically included at the C-terminus of each nucleic acid sequence when the sequence is included in an expression vector for expression of a protein of interest. For example, each of the nucleotide sequences of the invention encoding a mutant CTLA-4 polypeptide or mutant CTLA-4 fusion protein may optionally further include a stop codon at the C terminus, such as TAA. A different stop codon may be substituted for the TAA, such as a TGA stop codon. A nucleic acid sequence encoding a wild-type fusion protein (e.g., hCTLA-4-Ig, hCD86-Ig, etc.) may also include a stop codon at its C-terminus. Each of the nucleotide sequences may optionally further includes at the N-terminus a nucleotide sequence encoding a signal peptide to facilitate secretion of a mutant CTLA-4 polypeptide or fusion protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein dimers include those comprising polypeptide sequences shown in SEQ ID NOS:74-79, 197-200, 205-214, and 219-222. Exemplary nucleic acids encoding the mutant CTLA-4 Ig fusion proteins of SEQ ID NOS:74-79, 197-200, 220 and 222 are set forth in SEQ ID NO:153-158, 201-204, and 223-224, respectively. The fusion protein sequences of SEQ ID NOS:205-210, 211-214, 219, and 221 are identical to the protein sequences of SEQ ID NOS:74-79, 197-200, 220, and 222, respectively, except that the protein sequences of SEQ ID NOS:205-210 do not include the C-terminal lysine (K) residue; as explained above, it is believed that the predicted C-terminal lysine residue, which is encoded by the AAA codon immediately preceding the TAA stop codon of each such polynucleotide sequence, is cleaved from the resulting fusion protein during processing or secretion. The nucleic acid sequences of SEQ ID NOS:153-158, 201-204, and 223-224 encode the fusion protein sequences of SEQ ID NOS:74-79, 197-200, 220, and 222, respectively, each of which after cleavage/loss of the C-terminal K residue results in the fusion protein sequences shown in SEQ ID NOS:205-210, 211-214, 219, and 221, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach of the polynucleotide sequences SEQ ID NOS:153-158, 201-204, and 223-224 also includes at its N-terminus a nucleotide sequence encoding the signal peptide shown in SEQ ID NO:181 or 215, which signal peptide is ultimately cleaved to form the mature fusion protein. Nucleotide residues 1-111 of each of the polynucleotide sequences of SEQ ID NOS:153-158, 201-204, and 223-224, as counted from the N-terminus of each such polynucleotide sequence (nucleotide residues 1-111 are set forth in SEQ ID NO:215), encode the 37-amino acid residue WT hCTLA-4 signal peptide shown in SEQ ID NO:216, which signal peptide is ultimately cleaved upon expression of the mature mutant CTLA-4 fusion protein monomer or dimer; thus, for each of the nucleic acid sequences of SEQ ID NOS:153-158, 201-204, and 223-224, the first codon encoding the first amino acid residue (methionine) of the mature IgG2 fusion protein is composed of nucleotide residues 112-114 of said nucleotide sequence. As noted above, in some instances, the signal peptide sequence may comprise only amino acid residues 1-35 as shown in SEQ ID NO:182 and the nucleotide sequence encoding this 35-amino acid residue signal peptide is shown in SEQ ID NO:181. Nevertheless, the encoded lysine (K) and alanine (A) residues at \npositions\n 36 and 37, respectively (encoded by the two codons AAA-GCC), are not present in the resulting mature mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein and are believed cleaved from the mature mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein during processing. The mature mutant CTLA-4 protein sequence typically begins with the methionine residue present at amino \nacid residue position\n 38 of the encoded mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides an isolated or recombinant nucleic acid comprising a polynucleotide sequence which encodes a fusion protein dimer (e.g., mutant CTLA-4-Ig dimer) comprising two identical monomeric fusion proteins (e.g., monomeric mutant CTLA-4-Ig), wherein each such monomeric fusion protein comprises a polypeptide sequence having at least 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100% identity to a polypeptide sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS:74-79, 197-200, 205-214, and 219-222, wherein the fusion protein dimer binds CD80 and/or CD86 (and/or a CD80-Ig and/or CD86-Ig), and/or has an ability to inhibit an immune response, or a complementary polynucleotide sequence thereof. Also provided is an isolated or recombinant nucleic acid encoding such monomeric fusion protein which binds CD80 and/or CD86 (and/or a CD80-Ig and/or CD86-Ig, and/or has an ability to inhibit an immune response.

Additional exemplary mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein dimers comprise the polypeptide sequences of SEQ ID NOS:205-210, 211-214, 219, and 222, which are expressed as fusion protein dimers; these fusion proteins lack the C-terminal lysine residue because it is typically cleaved during processing or prior to secretion. Exemplary nucleic acids encoding these fusion protein sequences with the C-terminal lysine (the lysine is cleaved subsequently) include the polynucleotide sequences of SEQ ID NOS:153-158, 201-204, and 223-224, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides an isolated or recombinant nucleic acid comprising a polynucleotide sequence which encodes a fusion protein, wherein said fusion protein comprises a polypeptide sequence having at least 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100% identity to a polypeptide sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS:74-79, 197-200, 205-214, and 219-222, wherein the fusion protein binds CD80 and/or CD86 (and/or a CD80-Ig and/or CD86-Ig), and/or has an ability to inhibit an immune response, or a complementary polynucleotide sequence thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention includes an isolated or recombinant nucleic acid comprising a nucleotide sequence having at least 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100% sequence identity to a polynucleotide sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS:153-158, 201-204, and 223-224, wherein such nucleic acid encodes a mutant CTLA-4-Ig protein dimer binds CD80 and/or CD86 (and/or a CD80-Ig and/or CD86-Ig), and/or has an ability to inhibit an immune response, or a complementary polynucleotide sequence thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides an isolated or recombinant nucleic acid comprising a polynucleotide sequence which encodes a fusion protein dimer (e.g., mutant CTLA-4-Ig dimer) comprising two monomeric fusion proteins (e.g., monomeric mutant CTLA-4-Ig), wherein each such monomeric fusion protein comprises: (1) a polypeptide (e.g., mutant CTLA-4 ECD) which comprises a polypeptide sequence which differs from a polypeptide sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS:1-73 in no more than 6 amino acid residues, and wherein the amino acid residue in the polypeptide sequence at \n \nposition\n \n 41, 50, 54, 55, 56, 64, 65, 70, or 85 is identical to the amino acid residue at the corresponding position of said selected polypeptide sequence (e.g., a polypeptide selected from SEQ ID NOS:1-73), and (2) an Ig Fc polypeptide, wherein the dimer binds CD80 and/or CD86 (and/or CD80-Ig and/or CD86-Ig), and/or inhibits an immune response, or a complementary polynucleotide sequence thereof.

Additional details of the functional properties and characteristics of such dimers are discussed above. Also provided is a recombinant or isolated nucleic acid comprising a nucleotide sequence which encodes such a monomeric fusion protein which binds CD80 and/or CD86 (and/or CD80-Ig and/or CD86-Ig) and/or has an ability to inhibit an immune response.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides an isolated or recombinant nucleic acid encoding fusion protein dimer (e.g., mutant CTLA-4-Ig dimer) comprising two monomeric fusion proteins (e.g., monomeric mutant CTLA-4-Ig), wherein each such monomeric fusion protein comprises: (1) a polypeptide (e.g., mutant CTLA-4 ECD) comprising a polypeptide sequence which (a) differs from the polypeptide sequence of SEQ ID NO:31 in no more than 6 amino acid residues, and (b) comprises at least one of the following: a methionine residue at a position corresponding to position 50 of SEQ ID NO:31, a lysine residue at a position corresponding to position 54 of SEQ ID NO:31, a glutamic acid residue at a position corresponding to position 55 of SEQ ID NO:31, a proline residue at a position corresponding to position 64 of SEQ ID NO:31, a serine residue at a position corresponding to position 65 of SEQ ID NO:31, a phenylalanine residue at a position corresponding to position 70 of SEQ ID NO:31, wherein amino acid residue positions are numbered according to SEQ ID NO:31; and (2) an Ig polypeptide, wherein said dimer binds hCD80 and/or hCD86 (and/or hCD86-Ig and/or hCD86-Ig), and/or inhibits an immune response, or a complementary polynucleotide sequence thereof.

Many fragments of these nucleic acids will express polypeptides that bind hCD80 and/hCD86 or an ECD thereof, or suppress an immune response, which properties can be readily identified with reasonable experimentation. Nucleotide fragments typically comprise at least 250, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 950, 1000 or more nucleotide bases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention includes an isolated or recombinant nucleic acid that encodes a protein comprising a signal peptide and a polypeptide of the invention (which includes a dimeric or monomeric fusion protein of the invention), such as a mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide or mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein of the invention, that binds CD80 and/or CD86 and/or suppresses an immune response in in vitro or in vivo assays and/or methods as described in detail elsewhere herein. The encoded signal peptide sequence, which directs secretion of the mature polypeptide through a prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell membrane, is typically covalently linked to the amino terminus of said polypeptide. A variety of signal peptides can be used, including, e.g., the signal peptide sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:182, which is encoded by, e.g., the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:181, or the signal peptide sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:216, which is encoded by, e.g., the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:215. The invention also include an isolated or recombinant nucleic acid which encodes a protein comprising a signal peptide, mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide, transmembrane domain, and/or cytoplasmic domain as discussed detail above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe signal peptide sequence of the full-length human CTLA-4 protein can be used to direct expression or secretion of a recombinant mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide or mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein of the invention. In one aspect, the signal peptide (SP) of the hCTLA-4 protein comprises amino acid residues 1-37 of the hCTLA-4 protein; this signal peptide sequence is shown in SEQ ID NO:216. In this instance, the mature hCTLA-4 protein typically begins with the methionine residue at \nposition\n 38, and the amino acid residues of the mature hCTLA-4 protein are numbered accordingly beginning with this methionine residue being designated as the first amino acid (i.e., occupying position 1). Thus, a signal peptide comprising the peptide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:216 can be fused or linked to the amino (N) terminus of a mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide or mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein of the invention, such as by a covalent linkage, so as to facilitate expression or secretion of the mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide or mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein, respectively. An exemplary nucleic acid comprising a nucleotide sequence that encodes the hCTLA-4 signal peptide sequence of SEQ ID NO:216 is set forth in SEQ ID NO:215.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the signal peptide sequence of SEQ ID NO:216 is fused to linked to the N-terminus of a mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide or mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein, upon expression or secretion of said polypeptide or fusion protein, the signal peptide is cleaved; the resulting mature mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide or mature mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein typically begins with the methionine residue at \nposition\n 38, and the amino acid residues of the mature mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide or mature mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein are numbered accordingly beginning with this methionine residue being designated as the first amino acid (i.e., occupying position 1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention includes an isolated or recombinant polypeptide comprising a signal peptide (e.g., SEQ ID NO:216) and a mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide (e.g., a sequence selected from the group of SEQ ID NOS:1-73), wherein the signal peptide is covalently linked to the N-terminus of the mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide. Also included is an isolated or recombinant polypeptide comprising a signal peptide (e.g., SEQ ID NO:216) and a mutant CTLA-4-Ig (e.g., a sequence selected from the group of SEQ ID NOS:74-79, 197-200, 205-214, and 219-222), wherein the signal peptide is covalently linked to the N-terminus of the mutant CTLA-4-Ig. Also provided is an isolated or recombinant nucleic acid comprising a nucleotide sequence (e.g., SEQ ID NO:215) encoding a signal peptide (e.g., SEQ NO:216) and a nucleotide sequence encoding a mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide (e.g., a sequence selected from the group of SEQ ID NOS:1-73) or a mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein (e.g., a sequence selected from the group of SEQ ID NOS:74-79, 197-200, 205-214, and 219-222).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an alternative aspect, the signal peptide of the full-length hCTLA-4 protein comprises residues 1-35 of the full-length hCTLA-4 protein; this signal peptide comprises the peptide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:182. In this instance, the two amino acid residues lysine (K) and alanine (A) at \npositions\n 36 and 37, respectively, of the hCTLA-4 protein are nevertheless typically absent from the mature secreted hCTLA-4 protein as determined by protein sequencing. Thus, the resulting mature hCTLA-4 protein similarly begins with the methionine residue at \nposition\n 38, and the amino acid residues of the mature hCTLA-4 protein are numbered accordingly beginning with this methionine residue at \nposition\n 38 of the hCTLA-4 protein being designated as the first amino acid of the mature hCTLA-4 protein. Because amino acid residues lysine (K) and alanine (A) at \npositions\n 36 and 37, respectively, of the full-length hCTLA-4 protein are not present in the resulting mature hCTLA-4 protein, it is believed they have been cleaved from the mature hCTLA-4 protein during processing. An exemplary nucleic acid comprising a nucleotide sequence that encodes the hCTLA-4 signal peptide sequence (SEQ ID NO:182) is shown in SEQ ID NO:181.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA signal peptide comprising the peptide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:182 can be fused or linked to the N-terminus of a mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide or mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein of the invention, such as by a covalent linkage, so as to facilitate expression or secretion of the mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide or mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein, respectively. When the signal peptide sequence of SEQ ID NO:182 is fused or linked to the N-terminus of a mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide or mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein, upon expression or secretion of the polypeptide or fusion protein, the signal peptide is cleaved; the resulting mature mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide or mature mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein nevertheless typically begins with the methionine residue at \nposition\n 38, and the amino acid residues of the mature mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide or mature mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein are numbered accordingly beginning with this methionine residue being designated as the first amino acid (i.e., occupying position 1). Because amino acid residues lysine (K) and alanine (A) at \npositions\n 36 and 37, respectively, of the full-length hCTLA-4 protein are not present in the resulting mature mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide or mature mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein, it is believed they have been cleaved from said mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide or mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein during processing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention includes an isolated or recombinant polypeptide comprising a signal peptide (e.g., SEQ ID NO:182) and a mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide (e.g., a sequence selected from the group of SEQ ID NOS:1-73), wherein the signal peptide is covalently linked to the N-terminus of the mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide. Also included is an isolated or recombinant polypeptide comprising a signal peptide (e.g., SEQ ID NO:182) and a mutant CTLA-4-Ig (e.g., a sequence selected from the group of SEQ ID NOS:74-79, 197-200, 205-214, and 219-222), wherein the signal peptide is covalently linked to the N-terminus of the mutant CTLA-4-Ig. Also provided is an isolated or recombinant nucleic acid comprising a nucleotide sequence (e.g., SEQ ID NO:181) encoding a signal peptide (e.g., SEQ NO: 182) and a nucleotide sequence encoding a mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide (e.g., a sequence selected from the group of SEQ ID NOS:1-73) or a mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein (e.g., a sequence selected from the group of SEQ ID NOS:74-79, 197-200, 205-214, and 219-222).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA nucleic acid of the invention can further comprise one or more suitable additional nucleotide sequences. For example, given that a polypeptide of the invention (which includes a fusion protein of the invention) can comprise one or more additional polypeptide sequences, such as, e.g., a polypeptide purification subsequence (such as, e.g., a subsequence is selected from an epitope tag, a FLAG tag, a polyhistidine sequence, and a GST fusion), signal peptide sequence, etc., the invention includes nucleic acids that encode all such polypeptides comprising such additional sequences. Exemplary signal peptides, which upon expression are typically covalently linked to the N-terminal of a polypeptide of the invention, are discussed above. For example, a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide sequence of any of SEQ ID NOS:1-79, 197-200, 205-214, and 219-222 can further comprise a nucleic acid encoding a signal peptide, such as the signal peptide sequence of SEQ ID NO:182, such as, e.g., the nucleotide sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:181, or the signal peptide sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:216, which is encoded by, e.g., the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:215. Such nucleotide sequences can be directly fused together, in appropriate reading frame, such that the resulting nucleic acid comprises a nucleotide sequence encoding a signal peptide of the invention and a nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA nucleic acid of the invention can be isolated by any suitable technique, of which several are known in the art. An isolated nucleic acid of the invention (e.g., a nucleic acid that is prepared in a host cell and subsequently substantially purified by any suitable nucleic acid purification technique) can be re-introduced into a host cell or re-introduced into a cellular or other biological environment or composition wherein it is no longer the dominant nucleic acid species and is no longer separated from other nucleic acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNearly any isolated or recombinant nucleic acid of the invention can be inserted in or fused to a suitable larger nucleic acid molecule (including e.g., but not limited to, a chromosome, a plasmid, an expression vector or cassette, a viral genome, a gene sequence, a linear expression element, a bacterial genome, a plant genome, or an artificial chromosome, such as a mammalian artificial chromosome (MAC), or the yeast and bacterial counterparts thereof (i.e., a YAC or a BAC) to form a recombinant nucleic acid using standard techniques. As another example, an isolated nucleic acid of the invention can be fused to smaller nucleotide sequences, such as promoter sequences, immunostimulatory sequences, and/or sequences encoding other amino acids, such as other antigen epitopes and/or linker sequences to form a recombinant nucleic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some instances, a recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid may be generated by chemical synthesis techniques applied outside of the context of a host cell (e.g., a nucleic acid produced through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or chemical synthesis techniques, examples of which are described further herein).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acids encoding polypeptides (including fusion proteins) of the invention can have any suitable chemical composition that permits the expression of a polypeptide of the invention or other desired biological activity (e.g., hybridization with other nucleic acids). The polynucleotides of the invention can be in the form of RNA or in the form of DNA, and include mRNA, cRNA, recombinant or synthetic RNA and DNA, and cDNA. The nucleic acids of the invention are typically DNA molecules, and usually double-stranded DNA molecules. However, single-stranded DNA, single-stranded RNA, double-stranded RNA, and hybrid DNA/RNA nucleic acids or combinations thereof comprising any of the nucleotide sequences of the invention also are provided. A nucleic acid of the invention can include any suitable nucleotide base, base analog, and/or backbone (e.g., a backbone formed by, or including, a phosphothioate, rather than phosphodiester, linkage, e.g., DNA comprising a phosphothioate or phosphorothioate backbone). A nucleic acid of the invention, if single-stranded, can be the coding strand or the non-coding (i.e., antisense or complementary) strand. In addition to a nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide of the invention (e.g., nucleotide sequence that comprise the coding sequence of a mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide or mutant CTLA-4-Ig), the polynucleotide of the invention can comprise one or more additional coding nucleotide sequences, so as to encode, e.g., a fusion protein, targeting sequence (other than a signal sequence), or the like (more particular examples of which are discussed further herein), and/or can comprise non-coding nucleotide sequences, such as introns, terminator sequence, or 5′ and/or 3′ untranslated regions, which regions can be effective for expression of the coding sequence in a suitable host, and/or control elements, such as a promoter (e.g., naturally occurring or recombinant or shuffled promoter).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModifications to a nucleic acid are particularly tolerable in the 3rd position of an mRNA codon sequence encoding such a polypeptide. In particular aspects, at least a portion of the nucleic acid comprises a phosphorothioate backbone, incorporating at least one synthetic nucleotide analog in place of or in addition to the naturally occurring nucleotides in the nucleic acid sequence. Also or alternatively, the nucleic acid can comprise the addition of bases other than guanine, adenine, uracil, thymine, and cytosine. Such modifications can be associated with longer half-life, and thus can be desirable in nucleic acids vectors of the invention. Thus, in one aspect, the invention provides recombinant nucleic acids and nucleic acid vectors (discussed further below), which nucleic acids or vectors comprise at least one of the aforementioned modifications, or any suitable combination thereof, wherein the nucleic acid persists longer in a mammalian host than a substantially identical nucleic acid without such a modification or modifications. Examples of modified and/or non-cytosine, non-adenine, non-guanine, non-thymine nucleotides that can be incorporated in a nucleotide sequence of the invention are provided in, e.g., the M\nANUAL OF \nP\nATENT \nE\nXAMINING \nP\nROCEDURE §\n2422 (7th Revision—2000).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is to be understood that a nucleic acid encoding at least one of the polypeptides of the invention (which includes a fusion protein of the invention), including those described above and elsewhere herein, is not limited to a sequence that directly codes for expression or production of a polypeptide of the invention. For example, the nucleic acid can comprise a nucleotide sequence which results in a polypeptide of the invention through intein-like expression (as described in, e.g., Colson and Davis (1994) Mol. Microbiol. 12(3):959-63, Duan et al. (1997) Cell 89(4):555-64, Perler (1998) Cell 92(1):1-4, Evans et al. (1999) Biopolymers 51(5):333-42, and de Grey, Trends Biotechnol. 18(9):394-99 (2000)), or a nucleotide sequence which comprises self-splicing introns (or other self-spliced RNA transcripts), which form an intermediate recombinant polypeptide-encoding sequence (as described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,010,884). The nucleic acid also or alternatively can comprise sequences which result in other splice modifications at the RNA level to produce an mRNA transcript encoding the polypeptide and/or at the DNA level by way of trans-splicing mechanisms prior to transcription (principles related to such mechanisms are described in, e.g., Chabot, Trends Genet. (1996) 12(11):472-78, Cooper (1997) Am. J. Hum. Genet. 61(2):259-66, and Hertel et al. (1997) Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 9(3):350-57). Due to the inherent degeneracy of the genetic code, several nucleic acids can code for any particular polypeptide of the invention. Thus, for example, any of the particular nucleic acids described herein can be modified by replacement of one or more codons with an equivalent codon (with respect to the amino acid called for by the codon) based on genetic code degeneracy. Other nucleotide sequences that encode a polypeptide having the same or a functionally equivalent sequence as a polypeptide sequence of the invention can also be used to synthesize, clone and express such polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, any of the nucleic acids of the invention can be modified to increase expression in a particular host, using the techniques exemplified herein with respect to the above-described nucleic acids encoding a polypeptide of the invention (e.g., nucleic acids encoding mutant CTLA-4 ECD or mutant CTLA-4-Ig). Any of the nucleic acids of the invention as described herein may be codon optimized for expression in a particular mammal (normally humans). A variety of techniques for codon optimization are known in the art. Codons that are utilized most often in a particular host are called optimal codons, and those not utilized very often are classified as rare or low-usage codons (see, e.g., Zhang, S. P. et al. (1991) Gene 105:61-72). Codons can be substituted to reflect the preferred codon usage of the host, a process called “codon optimization” or “controlling for species codon bias.” Optimized coding sequence comprising codons preferred by a particular prokaryotic or eukaryotic host can be used to increase the rate of translation or to produce recombinant RNA transcripts having desirable properties, such as a longer half-life, as compared with transcripts produced from a non-optimized sequence. Techniques for producing codon-optimized sequences are known (see, e.g., E. et al. (1989) Nuc. Acids Res. 17:477-508). Translation stop codons can also be modified to reflect host preference. For example, preferred stop codons for \nS. cerevisiae \nand mammals are UAA and UGA respectively. The preferred stop codon for monocotyledonous plants is UGA, whereas insects and \nE. coli \nprefer to use UAA as the stop codon (see, e.g., Dalphin, M. E. et al. (1996) Nuc. Acids Res. 24:216-218). The arrangement of codons in context to other codons also can influence biological properties of a nucleic acid sequences, and modifications of nucleic acids to provide a codon context arrangement common for a particular host also is contemplated by the inventors. Thus, a nucleic acid sequence of the invention can comprise a codon optimized nucleotide sequence, i.e., codon frequency optimized and/or codon pair (i.e., codon context) optimized for a particular species (e.g., the polypeptide can be expressed from a polynucleotide sequence optimized for expression in humans by replacement of “rare” human codons based on codon frequency, or codon context, such as by using techniques such as those described in Buckingham et al. (1994) Biochimie 76(5):351-54 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,082,767, 5,786,464, and 6,114,148).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acids of the invention can be modified by truncation or one or more residues of the C-terminus portion of the sequence. Additional, a variety of stop or termination codons may be included at the end of the nucleotide sequence as further discussed below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne or more nucleic acids of the invention may be included in a vector, cell, or host environment in which a coding nucleotide sequence of the invention is a heterologous gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolynucleotides of the invention include polynucleotide sequences that encode any polypeptide of the invention (or polypeptide fragment thereof) which binds CD80 and/or CD86 and/or suppresses an immune response, polynucleotides that hybridize under at least stringent conditions to one or more such polynucleotide sequences described herein, polynucleotide sequences complementary to any such polynucleotide sequences, and variants, analogs, and homologue derivatives of all of the above. A coding sequence refers to a nucleotide sequence encodes a particular polypeptide or a domain, subsequence, region, or fragment of said polypeptide. A coding sequence may code for a mutant CTLA-4 polypeptide or fragment thereof having a functional property, such as the ability to bind CD80 and/or CD86 and/or inhibit or suppress an immune response. A nucleic acid of the invention may comprise a respective coding sequence of a mutant CTLA-4 polypeptide of the invention, and variants, analogs, and homologue derivatives thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acids of the invention can also be found in combination with typical compositional formulations of nucleic acids, including in the presence of carriers, buffers, adjuvants, excipients, diluents, and the like, as are known to those of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnless otherwise indicated, a particular nucleic acid sequence described herein also implicitly encompasses conservatively modified variants thereof (e.g., degenerate codon substitutions) and complementary sequences and as well as the sequence explicitly indicated. Specifically, degenerate codon substitutions may be achieved by generating sequences in which the third position of one or more selected (or all) codons is substituted with mixed-base and/or deoxyinosine residues (Batzer et al. (1991) Nucl. Acid Res. 19:5081; Ohtsuka et al. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260:2605-2608; Cassol et al. (1992); Rossolini et al. (1994) Mol. Cell. Probes 8:91-98).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic Acid Hybridization\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs noted above, the invention includes nucleic acids that hybridize to a target nucleic acid of the invention, such as, e.g., a polynucleotide selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS:80-158, 201-204, 223, and 224 or a complementary polynucleotide sequence thereof, wherein hybridization is over substantially the entire length of the target nucleic acid. The hybridizing nucleic acid may hybridize to a nucleotide sequence of the invention, such as, e.g., that of SEQ ID NO:80, under at least stringent conditions or under at least high stringency conditions. Moderately stringent, stringent, and highly stringent hybridization conditions for nucleic acid hybridization experiments are known. Examples of factors that can be combined to achieve such levels of stringency are briefly discussed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acids “hybridize” when they associate, typically in solution. Nucleic acids hybridize due to a variety of well-characterized physico-chemical forces, such as hydrogen bonding, solvent exclusion, base stacking and the like. An extensive guide to the hybridization of nucleic acids is found in P. Tijssen (1993) L\nABORATORY \nT\nECHNIQUES IN \nB\nIOCHEMISTRY AND \nM\nOLECULAR \nB\nIOLOGY\n—H\nYBRIDIZATION WITH \nN\nUCLEIC ACID \nP\nROBES\n, vol. 24, part I, \nchapter\n 2, “Overview of principles of hybridization and the strategy of nucleic acid probe assays,” (Elsevier, N.Y.) (hereinafter “Tijssen”), as well as in Ausubel, supra, Hames and Higgins (1995) G\n \nENE \n \n \nP\nROBES\n \n \n \n1, IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford, England (Hames and Higgins 1) and Hames and Higgins (1995) G\n \nENE \n \n \nP\nROBES\n \n \n \n2, IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford, England (Hames and Higgins 2) provide details on the synthesis, labeling, detection and quantification of DNA and RNA, including oligonucleotides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn indication that two nucleic acid sequences are substantially identical is that the two molecules hybridize to each other under at least stringent conditions. The phrase “hybridizing specifically to,” refers to the binding, duplexing, or hybridizing of a molecule only to a particular nucleotide sequence under stringent conditions when that sequence is present in a complex mixture (e.g., total cellular) DNA or RNA. “Bind(s) substantially” refers to complementary hybridization between a probe nucleic acid and a target nucleic acid and embraces minor mismatches that can be accommodated by reducing the stringency of the hybridization media to achieve the desired detection of the target polynucleotide sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Stringent hybridization wash conditions” and “stringent hybridization conditions” in the context of nucleic acid hybridization experiments, such as Southern and northern hybridizations, are sequence dependent, and are different under different environmental parameters. An extensive guide to hybridization of nucleic acids is found in Tijssen (1993), supra, and in Hames and \nHiggins\n 1 and Hames and \nHiggins\n 2, supra.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, high stringency conditions are selected such that hybridization occurs at about 5° C. or less than the thermal melting point (T\nm\n) for the specific sequence at a defined ionic strength and pH. The T\nm \nis the temperature (under defined ionic strength and pH) at which 50% of the test sequence hybridizes to a perfectly matched probe. In other words, the T\nm \nindicates the temperature at which the nucleic acid duplex is 50% denatured under the given conditions and its represents a direct measure of the stability of the nucleic acid hybrid. Thus, the T\nm \ncorresponds to the temperature corresponding to the midpoint in transition from helix to random coil; it depends on length, nucleotide composition, and ionic strength for long stretches of nucleotides. Typically, under “stringent conditions,” a probe will hybridize to its target subsequence, but to no other sequences. “Very stringent conditions” are selected to be equal to the T\nm \nfor a particular probe.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe T\nm \nof a DNA-DNA duplex can be estimated using equation (1): T\nm \n(° C.)=81.5° C.+16.6 (log\n10\nM)+0.41 (% G+C)−0.72 (% f)−500/n, where M is the molarity of the monovalent cations (usually Na+), (% G+C) is the percentage of guanosine (G) and cytosine (C) nucleotides, (% f) is the percentage of formalize and n is the number of nucleotide bases (i.e., length) of the hybrid. See Rapley, R. and Walker, J. M. eds., M\nOLECULAR \nB\nIOMETHODS \nH\nANDBOOK \n(1998), Humana Press, Inc. (hereinafter Rapley and Walker), Tijssen (1993), supra. The T\nm \nof an RNA-DNA duplex can be estimated using equation (2): T\nm \n(° C.)=79.8° C.+18.5 (log\n10\nM)+0.58 (% G+C)-11.8(% G+C)\n2\n−0.56 (% f)−820/n, where M is the molarity of the monovalent cations (usually Na+), (% G+C) is the percentage of guanosine (G) and cytosine (C) nucleotides, (% f) is the percentage of formamide and n is the number of nucleotide bases (i.e., length) of the hybrid. Id. \n \nEquations\n \n 1 and 2 above are typically accurate only for hybrid duplexes longer than about 100-200 nucleotides. Id. The T\nm \nof nucleic acid sequences shorter than 50 nucleotides can be calculated as follows: T\nm \n(° C.)=4(G+C)+2(A+T), where A (adenine), C, T (thymine), and G are the numbers of the corresponding nucleotides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, non-hybridized nucleic acid material is removed by a series of washes, the stringency of which can be adjusted depending upon the desired results, in conducting hybridization analysis. Low stringency washing conditions (e.g., using higher salt and lower temperature) increase sensitivity, but can product nonspecific hybridization signals and high background signals. Higher stringency conditions (e.g., using lower salt and higher temperature that is closer to the hybridization temperature) lower the background signal, typically with only the specific signal remaining. Addition useful guidance concerning such hybridization techniques is provided in, e.g., Rapley and Walker, supra (in particular, with respect to such hybridization experiments, part I, \nchapter\n 2, “Overview of principles of hybridization and the strategy of nucleic acid probe assays”), Elsevier, N.Y., as well as in Ausubel, supra, Sambrook, supra, Watson, supra, Hames and Higgins (1995) G\n \nENE \n \n \nP\nROBES\n \n \n \n1, IRL Press at Oxford Univ. Press, Oxford, England, and Hames and Higgins (1995) G\n \nENE \n \n \nP\nROBES\n \n \n \n2, IRL Press, Oxford Univ. Press, Oxford, England.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary stringent (or regular stringency) conditions for analysis of at least two nucleic acids comprising at least 100 nucleotides include incubation in a solution or on a filter in a Southern or northern blot comprises 50% formalin (or formamide) with 1 milligram (mg) of heparin at 42° C., with the hybridization being carried out overnight. A regular stringency wash can be carried out using, e.g., a solution comprising 0.2×SSC wash at about 65° C. for about 15 minutes (see Sambrook, supra, for a description of SSC buffer). Often, the regular stringency wash is preceded by a low stringency wash to remove background probe signal. A low stringency wash can be carried out in, for example, a solution comprising 2×SSC at about 40° C. for about 15 minutes. A highly stringent wash can be carried out using a solution comprising 0.15 M NaCl at about 72° C. for about 15 minutes. An example medium (regular) stringency wash, less stringent than the regular stringency wash described above, for a duplex of, e.g., more than 100 nucleotides, can be carried out in a solution comprising 1×SSC at 45° C. for 15 minutes. An example low stringency wash for a duplex of, e.g., more than 100 nucleotides, is carried out in a solution of 4-6×SSC at 40° C. for 15 minutes. For short probes (e.g., about 10-50 nucleotides), stringent conditions typically involve salt concentrations of less than about 1.0 M Na\n+\n ion, typically about 0.01 to 1.0 M Na\n+\n ion concentration (or other salts) at pH 7.0 to 8.3, and the temperature is typically at least about 30° C. Stringent conditions can also be achieved with the addition of destabilizing agents such as formamide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary moderate stringency conditions include overnight incubation at 37° C. in a solution comprising 20% formalin (or formamide), 0.5×SSC, 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.6), 5×Denhardt's solution, 10% dextran sulfate, and 20 mg/ml denatured sheared salmon sperm DNA, followed by washing the filters in 1×SSC at about 37-50° C., or substantially similar conditions, e.g., the moderately stringent conditions described in Sambrook, supra, and/or Ausubel, supra.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHigh stringency conditions are conditions that use, for example, (1) low ionic strength and high temperature for washing, such as 0.015 M sodium chloride/0.0015 M sodium citrate/0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) at 50° C., (2) employ a denaturing agent during hybridization, such as formamide, for example, 50% (v/v) formamide with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/0.1% Ficoll/0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)/50 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 6.5 with 750 mM sodium chloride, 75 mM sodium citrate at 42° C., or (3) employ 50% formamide, 5×SSC (0.75 M NaCl, 0.075 M sodium citrate), 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.8), 0.1% sodium pyrophosphate, 5×Denhardt's solution, sonicated salmon sperm DNA (50 μg/ml), 0.1% SDS, and 10% dextran sulfate at 42° C., with washes at (i) 42° C. in 0.2×SSC, (ii) at 55° C. in 50% formamide and (iii) at 55° C. in 0.1×SSC (preferably in combination with EDTA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, a signal to noise ratio of 2× or 2.5×-5× (or higher) than that observed for an unrelated probe in the particular hybridization assay indicates detection of a specific hybridization. Detection of at least stringent hybridization between two sequences in the context of the present invention indicates relatively strong structural similarity or homology to, e.g., the nucleic acids of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs noted, “highly stringent” conditions are selected to be about 5° C. or less lower than the thermal melting point (T\nm\n) for the specific sequence at a defined ionic strength and pH. Target sequences that are closely related or identical to the nucleotide sequence of interest (e.g., “probe”) can be identified under highly stringency conditions. Lower stringency conditions are appropriate for sequences that are less complementary. See, e.g., Rapley and Walker; Sambrook, all supra.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nComparative hybridization can be used to identify nucleic acids of the invention, and this comparative hybridization method is a preferred method of distinguishing nucleic acids of the invention. Detection of highly stringent hybridization between two nucleotide sequences in the context of the present invention indicates relatively strong structural similarity/homology to, e.g., the nucleic acids provided in the sequence listing herein. Highly stringent hybridization between two nucleotide sequences demonstrates a degree of similarity or homology of structure, nucleotide base composition, arrangement or order that is greater than that detected by stringent hybridization conditions. In particular, detection of highly stringent hybridization in the context of the present invention indicates strong structural similarity or structural homology (e.g., nucleotide structure, base composition, arrangement or order) to, e.g., the nucleic acids provided in the sequence listing herein. For example, it is desirable to identify test nucleic acids that hybridize to the exemplar nucleic acids herein under stringent conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, one measure of stringent hybridization is the ability to hybridize to a nucleic acid of the invention (e.g., a nucleic acid comprising a polynucleotide sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS:80-158, 201-204, 223, and 224, or a complementary polynucleotide sequence thereof) under highly stringent conditions (or very stringent conditions, or ultra-high stringency hybridization conditions, or ultra-ultra high stringency hybridization conditions). Stringent hybridization (including, e.g., highly stringent, ultra-high stringency, or ultra-ultra high stringency hybridization conditions) and wash conditions can easily be determined empirically for any test nucleic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, in determining highly stringent hybridization and wash conditions, the hybridization and wash conditions are gradually increased (e.g., by increasing temperature, decreasing salt concentration, increasing detergent concentration and/or increasing the concentration of organic solvents, such as formalin, in the hybridization or wash), until a selected set of criteria is met. For example, the hybridization and wash conditions are gradually increased until a probe comprising one or more nucleic acid sequences selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS:80-158, 201-204, 223, and 224 and complementary polynucleotide sequences thereof, binds to a perfectly matched complementary target (again, a nucleic acid comprising at least one nucleic acid sequences selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS:80-158, 201-204, 223, and 224 or complementary polynucleotide sequences thereof), with a signal to noise ratio that is at least 2.5×, and optionally 5× or more as high as that observed for hybridization of the probe to an unmatched target. The unmatched target may comprise a nucleic acid corresponding to, e.g., a CTLA-4 polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsually, the hybridization analysis is carried out under hybridization conditions selected such that a nucleic acid comprising a sequence that is perfectly complementary to the a disclosed reference (or known) nucleotide sequence (e.g., SEQ ID NO:80) hybridizes with the recombinant antigen-encoding sequence (e.g., a nucleotide sequence variant of the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:80) with at least about 5, 7, or 10 times higher signal-to-noise ratio than is observed in the hybridization of the perfectly complementary nucleic acid to a nucleic acid that comprises a nucleotide sequence that is at least about 80 or 90% identical to the reference nucleic acid. Such conditions can be considered indicative for specific hybridization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above-described hybridization conditions can be adjusted, or alternative hybridization conditions selected, to achieve any desired level of stringency in selection of a hybridizing nucleic acid sequence. For example, the above-described highly stringent hybridization and wash conditions can be gradually increased (e.g., by increasing temperature, decreasing salt concentration, increasing detergent concentration and/or increasing the concentration of organic solvents, such as formalin, in the hybridization or wash), until a selected set of criteria are met. For example, the hybridization and wash conditions can be gradually increased until a desired probe, binds to a matched complementary target, with a signal-to-noise ratio that is at least about 2.5×, and optionally at least about 5× (e.g., about 10×, about 20×, about 50×, about 100×, or even about 500×), as high as the signal-to-noise ration observed from hybridization of the probe to a nucleic acid not of the invention, such as a nucleic acid encoding WT CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMaking and Modifying Nucleic Acids\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acids of the invention can be obtained and/or generated by application of any suitable synthesis, manipulation, and/or isolation techniques, or combinations thereof. Exemplary procedures are described infra. For example, polynucleotides of the invention are typically produced through standard nucleic acid synthesis techniques, such as solid-phase synthesis techniques known in the art. In such techniques, fragments of up to about 100 bases usually are individually synthesized, then joined (e.g., by enzymatic or chemical ligation methods, or polymerase mediated recombination methods) to form essentially any desired continuous nucleic acid sequence. The synthesis of the nucleic acids of the invention can be also facilitated (or alternatively accomplished), by chemical synthesis using, e.g., the classical phosphoramidite method, which is described in, e.g., Beaucage et al. (1981) Tetrahedron Letters 22:1859-69, or the method described by Matthes et al. (1984) EMBO J. 3:801-05, e.g., as is typically practiced in automated synthetic methods. The nucleic acid of the invention also can be produced by use of an automatic DNA synthesizer. Other techniques for synthesizing nucleic acids and related principles are described in, e.g., Itakura et al., Annu. Rev. Biochem. 53:323 (1984), Itakura et al., Science 198:1056 (1984), and Ike et al., Nucl. Acid Res. 11:477 (1983).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConveniently, custom made nucleic acids can be ordered from a variety of commercial sources, such as The Midland Certified Reagent Company (mcrc@oligos.com), the Great American Gene Company (worldwide website address genco.com), ExpressGen Inc.

(worldwide website address htibio.com), and BMA Biomedicals Ltd. (U.K.), Bio.Synthesis, Inc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain nucleotides of the invention may also be obtained by screening cDNA libraries using oligonucleotide probes that can hybridize to or PCR-amplify polynucleotides which encode the polypeptides of the invention. Procedures for screening and isolating cDNA clones and PCR amplification procedures are well known to those of skill in the art; exemplary procedures are described infra (see, e.g., procedures described in the Examples below). Such techniques are described in, e.g., Berger and Kimmel, “Guide to Molecular Cloning Techniques,” in Methods in Enzymol. Vol. 152, Acad. Press, Inc., San Diego, Calif. (“Berger”); Sambrook, supra; and Ausubel, supra. Some nucleic acids of the invention can be obtained by altering a naturally occurring backbone, e.g., by mutagenesis, in vitro recombination (e.g., shuffling), or oligonucleotide recombination. In other cases, such polynucleotides can be made in silico or through oligonucleotide recombination methods as described in the references cited herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecombinant DNA techniques useful in modification of nucleic acids are well known in the art (e.g., restriction endonuclease digestion, ligation, reverse transcription and cDNA production, and PCR).

Codons that are utilized most often in a particular host are called optimal codons, and those not utilized very often are classified as rare or low-usage codons (see, e.g., Zhang, S. P. et al. (1991) Gene 105:61-72). Codons can be substituted to reflect the preferred codon usage of the host, a process called “codon optimization” or “controlling for species codon bias.”\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOptimized coding sequence comprising codons preferred by a particular prokaryotic or eukaryotic host can be used to increase the rate of translation or to produce recombinant RNA transcripts having desirable properties, such as a longer half-life, as compared with transcripts produced from a non-optimized sequence. Techniques for producing codon-optimized sequences are known (see, e.g., Murray, E. et al. (1989) Nucl. Acids Res. 17:477-508). Translation stop codons can also be modified to reflect host preference. For example, preferred stop codons for \nS. cerevisiae \nand mammals are UAA and UGA respectively. The preferred stop codon for monocotyledonous plants is UGA, whereas insects and \nE. coli \nprefer to use UAA as the stop codon (see, e.g., Dalphin, M. E. et al. (1996) Nucl. Acids Res. 24:216-218, for discussion). The arrangement of codons in context to other codons also can influence biological properties of a nucleic acid sequences, and modifications of nucleic acids to provide a codon context arrangement common for a particular host also is contemplated by the inventors. Thus, a nucleic acid sequence of the invention can comprise a codon optimized nucleotide sequence, i.e., codon frequency optimized and/or codon pair (i.e., codon context) optimized for a particular species (e.g., the polypeptide can be expressed from a polynucleotide sequence optimized for expression in humans by replacement of “rare” human codons based on codon frequency, or codon context, such as by using techniques such as those described in Buckingham et al. (1994) Biochimie 76(5):351-54 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,082,767, 5,786,464, and 6,114,148). For example, the invention provides a nucleic acid comprising a nucleotide sequence variant of SEQ ID NO:80, wherein the nucleotide sequence variant differs from the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:80 by the substitution of “rare” codons for a particular host with codons commonly expressed in the host, which codons encode the same amino acid residue as the substituted “rare” codons in SEQ ID NO:80.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVectors, Vector Components, and Expression Systems\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also includes recombinant constructs comprising one or more of the nucleic acids of the invention as broadly described above. Such constructs may comprise a vector, such as a plasmid, a cosmid, a phage, a virus, a viral particle, a virus-like particle, a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC), a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC), or the like, or a non-replicating vector, such as a liposome, naked or conjugated DNA, DNA-microparticle, into which at least one nucleic acid sequence of the invention has been inserted, in a forward or reverse orientation. In a particular aspect of this embodiment, the construct further comprises one or more regulatory sequences, including, for example, a promoter, operably linked to a nucleic acid sequence of the invention (e.g., nucleic acid encoding an isolated or recombinant mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide or dimeric or monomeric mutant CTLA-4-Ig). Large numbers of suitable vectors and promoters are known to those of skill in the art and are commercially available. In some instances, a vector, such as, e.g., a virus or virus-like particle, may also or alternatively include one or more polypeptides of the invention such as, e.g., incorporated into the coat of the virus or virus-like particle. Vectors can be useful as delivery agents for the delivery or administration to a subject of exogenous genes or proteins. Vectors of the present invention, including those described herein, are useful as delivery agents for the delivery or administration of nucleic acids and/or polypeptides of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGeneral texts that describe molecular biological techniques useful herein, including the use of vectors, promoters, and many other relevant topics, include Berger, supra, Sambrook (1989), supra, and Ausubel, supra. Examples of techniques sufficient to direct persons of skill through in vitro amplification methods, including the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) the ligase chain reaction (LCR), Q∃-replicase amplification and other RNA polymerase mediated techniques (e.g., NASBA), e.g., for the production of the homologous nucleic acids of the invention are found in Berger, Sambrook, and Ausubel, all supra, as well as Mullis et al. (1987) U.S. Pat. No. 4,683,202; PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications (Innis et al., eds.) Academic Press Inc. San Diego, Calif.

(1990) Gene 89:117-122, and Sooknanan and Malek (1995) Biotechnology 13:563-564.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPCR generally refers to a procedure wherein minute amounts of a specific piece of nucleic acid (e.g., RNA or DNA) are amplified by methods well known in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,683,195 and the other references cited above). Generally, sequence information from the ends of the region of interest or beyond is used for design of oligonucleotide primers. Such primers will be identical or similar in sequence to the opposite strands of the template to be amplified. The 5′ terminal nucleotides of the opposite strands may coincide with the ends of the amplified material. PCR may be used to amplify specific RNA or specific DNA sequences, recombinant DNA or RNA sequences, DNA and RNA sequences from total genomic DNA, and cDNA transcribed from total cellular RNA, bacteriophage or plasmid sequences, etc. PCR is one example, but not the only example, of a nucleic acid polymerase reaction method for amplifying a nucleic acid test sample comprising the use of another (e.g., known) nucleic acid as a primer. Improved methods of cloning in vitro amplified nucleic acids are described in Wallace et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,426,039. Improved methods of amplifying large nucleic acids by PCR are summarized in Cheng et al. (1994) Nature 369:684 685 and the references cited therein, in which PCR amplicons of up to 40 kilobases (kb) are generated. One of skill will appreciate that essentially any RNA can be converted into a double-stranded DNA suitable for restriction digestion, PCR expansion and sequencing using reverse transcriptase and a polymerase. See Ausubel, Sambrook, and Berger, all supra.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nucleic acids of the present invention can be incorporated into any one of a variety of vectors, e.g., expression vectors, for expressing a polypeptide, including, e.g., a polypeptide of the invention. Expression vectors compatible with prokaryotic host cells may be used; such prokaryotic expression vectors are known in the art and commercially available. Such vectors include, but are not limited to, e.g., BLUESCRIPT vector (Stratagene), T7 expression vector (Invitrogen), pET vector (Novagen), and similar prokaryotic vectors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExpression vectors compatible with eukaryotic host cells may alternatively be used; such eukaryotic expression vectors are known in the art and commercially available. Such vectors include, but are not limited to, e.g., pCMV vectors (e.g., Invitrogen), pIRES vector (Clontech), pSG5 vector (Stratagene), pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen Life Technologies), pcDNA3 (Invitrogen Life Technologies), Ubiquitous Chromatin Opening Element (UCOE™) expression vector (Millipore), and similar eukaryotic expression vectors. The UCOE™ vector is typically used for protein production in mammalian cells (e.g., CHO cells). According to Millipore, the UCOE™ expression technology thwarts transgene silencing and provides stable high-level gene expression without respect to the site of chromosomal integration. See Millipore website at worldwide web address millipore.com. An exemplary UCOE expression vector into which, for example, a nucleic acid of the invention can be incorporated is the UCOE expression vector named CET1019AS-puro-SceI, which is available for licensing from Millipore. Information about the UCOE expression vector CET1019AS-puro-SceI can be found in, e.g., John Wynne, “UCOE™ Technology Maximizes Protein Expression,” BioProcess International 4(7):104-105 (July/August 2006) (RP1725EN00) (available at worldwide web address millipore.com/bibliography/tech1/rp1725en00); additional information about this vector and licensing of this vector from Millipore can be found the Millipore website, including at, e.g., worldwide web addresses millipore.com/company/cp3/ucoe_licensing and millipore.com/techpublications/tech1/ps1013en00. Thus, for example, a DNA sequence encoding a mutant CTLA-4 ECD (e.g., SEQ ID NO:36 or SEQ ID NO:50) fused to a DNA sequence encoding an IgG2 Fc polypeptide (e.g., SEQ ID NO:184), resulting in the DNA sequence of SEQ ID NO:201 is inserted into a UCOE CET1019AS vector (Millipore) and the resulting DNA plasmid can be used for transfections of host cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExpression vectors include chromosomal, nonchromosomal and synthetic DNA sequences, e.g., derivatives of SV40, bacterial vectors (e.g., \nS. typhimurium, S. typhi, S. flexneri, Listeria monocytogenes, B. anthracis\n); plasmids; bacterial plasmids; phage DNA; baculovirus; yeast plasmids; vectors derived from combinations of plasmids and phage DNA; viral DNA or RNA vectors, including, e.g., vaccinia virus, adeno-associated virus (AAV), adenovirus, Semliki-Forest virus (e.g., Notka et al., Biol. Chem. 380:341-52 (1999), pox virus (e.g., MVA), alphavirus (e.g., Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEE), Western equine encephalitis virus (WEE), Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEE)), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), fowl pox virus, pseudorabies, herpes simplex viruses, retroviruses, and many others. Any vector that transduces genetic material into a cell, and, if replication is desired, which is replicable and viable in the relevant host can be used. Viral and bacterial vectors serving as delivery vehicles can be attenuated; attenuation should be sufficient to decrease if not eliminate induction of undesirable disease symptoms. \nFIG. 1\n is a schematic diagram of an exemplary plasmid expression vector pcDNA mutant CTLA-4-Ig which encodes a mutant CTLA-4-Ig of the invention. Additional details regarding suitable expression vectors are provided below, including in the Examples.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA vector of the invention comprising a nucleic acid sequence of the invention as described herein, as well as an appropriate promoter or control sequence, can be employed to transform an appropriate host to permit the host to express the protein. Examples of appropriate expression hosts include: bacterial cells, such as \nE. coli, Streptomyces\n, and \nSalmonella typhimurium\n; fungal cells, such as \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae, Pichia pastoris\n, and \nNeurospora crassa\n; insect cells such as \nDrosophila \nand \nSpodoptera frugiperda\n; mammalian cells, such as Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) (e.g., CHO-K1), COS (e.g., COS-1, COS-7), baby hamster kidney (BHK), and Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) (e.g., HEK 293), Bowes melanoma cells, and plant cells. It is understood that not all cells or cell lines need to be capable of producing fully functional polypeptides of the invention or fragments thereof. The invention is not limited by the host cells employed. Additional details regarding suitable host cells are provided below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn bacterial systems, a number of expression vectors may be selected depending upon the use intended for the desired polypeptide or fragment thereof. For example, when large quantities of a particular polypeptide or fragments thereof are needed for the induction of antibodies, vectors which direct high level expression of fusion proteins that are readily purified may be desirable. Such vectors include, but are not limited to, multifunctional \nE. coli \ncloning and expression vectors such as BLUESCRIPT (Stratagene), in which nucleotide coding sequence of interest (e.g., nucleotide sequence encoding a recombinant mutant CTLA-4-Ig) may be ligated into the vector in-frame with sequences for the amino-terminal Met and the subsequent 7 residues of beta-galactosidase so that a hybrid protein is produced; pIN vectors (Van Heeke & Schuster (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264:5503-5509); pET vectors (Novagen, Madison Wis.); and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilarly, in the yeast \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae\n, a number of vectors comprising constitutive or inducible promoters such as alpha factor, alcohol oxidase, and PGH may be used for production of the polypeptides of the invention. For reviews, see Ausubel, supra, Berger, supra, and Grant et al. (1987) Meth. Enzymol. 153:516-544.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn mammalian host cells, a number of expression systems, such as viral-based systems, may be utilized. In cases where an adenovirus is used as an expression vector, a coding sequence is optionally ligated into an adenovirus transcription/translation complex consisting of the late promoter and tripartite leader sequence. Insertion in a nonessential E1 or E3 region of the viral genome results in a viable virus capable of expressing a polypeptide of interest in infected host cells (Logan and Shenk (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:3655-3659). In addition, transcription enhancers, such as the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) enhancer, are used to increase expression in mammalian host cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA vector, e.g., expression vector, or polynucleotide of the invention can comprise one or more expression control sequences. An expression control sequence is typically associated with and/or operably linked to a nucleic acid sequence of the invention, such as a nucleic acid encoding a recombinant mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide or recombinant mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein. An expression control sequence is typically a nucleotide sequence that promotes, enhances, or controls expression (typically transcription) of another nucleotide sequence. Suitable expression control sequences that may be employed include a promoter, including a constitutive promoter, inducible promoter, and/or repressible promoter, an enhancer for amplifying expression, an initiation sequence, a termination translation sequence, a splicing control sequence, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen a nucleic acid of the invention is included in a vector, the nucleic acid is typically operatively linked to an appropriate transcription control sequence (promoter) to direct mRNA synthesis. Promoters exert a particularly important impact on the level of recombinant polypeptide expression. Any suitable promoter can be utilized. Examples of suitable promoters include the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter with or without the first intron (intron A), the HIV long terminal repeat promoter, the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter, Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) promoters, such as RSV long terminal repeat (LTR) promoters, SV40 promoters, mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoters, HSV promoters, such as the Lap2 promoter or the herpes thymidine kinase promoter (as described in, e.g., Wagner et al. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 78:144-145), promoters derived from SV40 or Epstein Barr virus, adeno-associated viral (AAV) promoters, such as the p5 promoter, metallothionein promoters (e.g., the sheep metallothionein promoter or the mouse metallothionein promoter (see, e.g., Palmiter et al. (1983) Science 222:809-814), the human ubiquitin C promoter, \nE. coli \npromoters, such as the lac and trp promoters, phage lambda P\nL \npromoter, and other promoters known to control expression of genes in prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells (either directly in the cell or in viruses which infect the cell). Promoters that exhibit strong constitutive baseline expression in mammals, particularly humans, such as CMV promoters, such as the CMV immediate-early promoter (described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,168,062, 5,385,839, 5,688,688, and 5,658,759), and promoters having substantial sequence identity with such CMV promoters, can be employed. Recombinant promoters having enhanced properties, such as in Int'l Pat. Publ. No. WO 02/00897, may also be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA promoter that is operably linked to a nucleic acid of the invention for expression of the nucleic acid can have any suitable mechanism of action. Thus, the promoter can be, for example, an “inducible” promoter, (e.g., a growth hormone promoter, metallothionein promoter, heat shock protein promoter, E1B promoter, hypoxia induced promoter, radiation inducible promoter, or adenoviral MLP promoter and tripartite leader), an inducible-repressible promoter, a developmental stage-related promoter (e.g., a globin gene promoter), or a tissue specific promoter (e.g., a smooth muscle cell α-actin promoter, myosin light-chain 1A promoter, or vascular endothelial cadherin promoter). Suitable inducible promoters include ecdysone and ecdysone-analog-inducible promoters. Ecdysone-analog-inducible promoters are commercially available, e.g., through Stratagene (La Jolla, Calif.). If desired, a nucleic acid of the invention can be induced by using an inducible on- and off-gene expression system. Examples of such on- and off-gene expression systems include the Tet-On™ Gene Expression System and Tet-Off™ Gene Expression System, respectively (Clontech, Palo Alto, Calif.; see, e.g., Clontech Catalog 2000, pg. 110-111 for a detailed description of each such system). The inducible promoter can be any promoter that is up- and/or downregulated in response to an appropriate signal. Additional inducible promoters include arabinose-inducible promoters, a steroid-inducible promoters (e.g., a glucocorticoid-inducible promoters), as well as pH, stress, and heat-inducible promoters.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe promoter can be, and often is, a host-native promoter, or a promoter derived from a virus that infects a particular host (e.g., a human beta actin promoter, human EF1α promoter, or a promoter derived from a human AAV operably linked to the nucleic acid of interest), particularly where strict avoidance of gene expression silencing due to host immunological reactions to sequences that are not regularly present in the host is of concern. A bi-directional promoter system (as described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,017,478) linked to multiple nucleotide sequences of interest can also be utilized.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther suitable promoters and principles related to the selection, use, and construction of suitable promoters are provided in, e.g., Werner (1999) Mamm Genome 10(2):168-75, Walther et al. (1996) J. Mol. Med. 74(7):379-92, Novina (1996) Trends Genet. 12(9):351-55, Hart (1996) Semin. Oncol. 23(1):154-58, Gralla (1996) Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 6(5):526-30, Fassler et al.

Gene Expr. 3(4):229-54, Dynan (1989) Cell 58(1):1-4, Levine (1989) Cell 59(3):405-8, and Berk et al. (1986) Annu. Rev. Genet. 20:45-79, as well as U.S. Pat. No. 6,194,191. Other suitable promoters can be identified by use of the Eukaryotic Promoter Database (release 68) (available at the worldwide website address epd.isb-sib.ch/) and other similar databases, such as the Transcription Regulatory Regions Database (TRRD) (version 4.1) (available at the worldwide website address bionet.nsc.ru/trrd/) and the transcription factor database (TRANSFAC) (available at the worldwide website address transfac.gbf.de/TRANSFAC/index.html).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs an alternative to a promoter, particularly in RNA vectors and constructs, a vector or nucleic acid of the invention can comprise one or more internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs), IRES-encoding sequences, or RNA sequence enhancers (Kozak consensus sequence analogs), such as the tobacco mosaic virus omega prime sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA vector or polynucleotide of the invention can include an upstream activator sequence (UAS), such as a Gal4 activator sequence (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,133,028) or other suitable upstream regulatory sequence (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,204,060).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA vector or polynucleotide of the invention can include a Kozak consensus sequence that is functional in a mammalian cell. The Kozak sequence can be a naturally occurring or modified sequence, such as the modified Kozak consensus sequences described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,107,477.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecific initiation signals can aid in efficient translation of a coding sequence of the invention, such as a mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide-encoding nucleotide sequence. Such signals can be included in a vector of the invention. These signals can include, e.g., the ATG initiation codon and adjacent sequences. In cases where a coding sequence, its initiation codon, and upstream sequences are inserted into an appropriate expression vector, no additional translational control signals may be needed. However, in cases where only a coding sequence (e.g., a mature protein coding sequence), or a portion thereof is inserted, exogenous nucleic acid transcriptional control signals including the ATG initiation codon must be provided. Furthermore, the initiation codon must be in the correct reading frame to ensure transcription of the entire insert. Exogenous transcriptional elements and initiation codons can be of various origins—both natural and synthetic. The efficiency of expression can be enhanced by the inclusion of enhancers appropriate to the cell system in use (see, e.g., Scharf et al., Results Probl. Cell. Differ. 20:125-62 (1994); and Bittner et al., Meth. Enzymol. 153:516-544 (1987)). Suitable enhancers include the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) enhancer and the RTE enhancers described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,225,082.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe skilled artisan will recognize that the introduction of a start codon (ATG) to the 5′ end of a particular nucleotide sequence of interest usually results in the addition of an N-terminal methionine to the encoded amino acid sequence when the sequence is expressed in a mammalian cell (other modifications may occur in bacterial and/or other eukaryotic cells, such as introduction of an formyl-methionine residue at a start codon). For expression of a nucleic acid of the invention in eukaryotic cells, a start codon and a nucleotide sequence encoding a signal peptide are typically be included at the 5′ end of a nucleic acid sequence of the invention (e.g., SEQ ID NO:80), and a termination codon is typically included at the C terminus of the nucleic acid (e.g., SEQ ID NO:80). An exemplary signal peptide sequence is the hCTLA-4 signal peptide sequence (SEQ ID NO:182); the nucleic acid sequence encoding the tissue plasminogen activator signal peptide is shown in SEQ ID NO:181. Another exemplary signal peptide sequence is the hCTLA-4 signal peptide sequence (SEQ ID NO:216), which is encoded by the nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:215.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTermination sequences are discussed in detail below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch elements can be included in the vector construct of choice. Upon expression, the polypeptide variant encoded by the nucleic acid (e.g., SEQ ID NO:80) will initially include an N-terminal methionine residue and the signal peptide sequence. However, the N-terminal methionine and signal peptide sequence will be cleaved upon secretion, thereby generating the encoded polypeptide (e.g., SEQ ID NO:1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe expression level of a nucleic acid of the invention (or a corresponding polypeptide of the invention can be assessed by any suitable technique. Examples include Northern Blot analysis (discussed in, e.g., McMaster et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 74(11):4835-38 (1977) and Sambrook, infra), reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (as described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,601,820 and Zaheer et al., Neurochem. Res. 20:1457-63 (1995)), and in situ hybridization techniques (as described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,750,340 and 5,506,098). Quantification of proteins also can be accomplished by the Lowry assay and other protein quantification assays (see, e.g., Bradford, Anal. Biochem. 72:248-254 (1976); Lowry et al., J. Biol. Chem. 193:265 (1951)). Western blot analysis of recombinant polypeptides of the invention obtained from the lysate of cells transfected with polynucleotides encoding such recombinant polypeptides is another suitable technique for assessing levels of recombinant polypeptide expression.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA vector, e.g., expression vector, or polynucleotide of the invention can comprise a ribosome-binding site for translation initiation and a transcription-terminating region. A suitable transcription-terminating region is, for example, a polyadenylation sequence that facilitates cleavage and polyadenylation of an RNA transcript produced from a DNA sequence. Any suitable polyadenylation sequence can be used, including a synthetic optimized sequence, as well as the polyadenylation sequence of BGH (Bovine Growth Hormone), human growth hormone gene, polyoma virus, TK (Thymidine Kinase), EBV (Epstein Barr Virus), rabbit beta globin, and the papillomaviruses, including human papillomaviruses and BPV (Bovine Papilloma Virus). Suitable polyadenylation (polyA) sequences also include the SV40 (human Sarcoma Virus-40) polyadenylation sequence and the BGH polyA sequence. Such polyA sequences are described in, e.g., Goodwin et al. (1998) Nucleic Acids Res. 26(12):2891-8, Schek et al. (1992) Mol. Cell. Biol. 12(12):5386-93, and van den Hoff et al. (1993) Nucleic Acids Res. 21(21):4987-8. Additional principles related to selection of appropriate polyadenylation sequences are described in, e.g., Levitt et al. (1989) Genes Dev. 1989 3(7):1019-1025, Jacob et al. (1990) Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 1(1):49-59, Chen et al. (1995) Nucleic Acids Res. 23(14):2614-2620, Moreira et al. (1995) EMBO J. 14(15):3809-3819, Carswell et al. (1989) Mol. Cell. Biol. 9(10):4248-4258.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA vector or polynucleotide of the invention can further comprise site-specific recombination sites, which can be used to modulate transcription of a nucleotide sequence of interest, as described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,959,317, 5,801,030 and 6,063,627, European Patent Application No. 0 987 326 and Int'l Patent App. Publ. No. WO 97/09439.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA vector or polynucleotide of the invention can also comprise a nucleic acid encoding a secretion/localization sequence, to target polypeptide expression to a desired cellular compartment, membrane, or organelle, or to direct polypeptide secretion to the periplasmic space or into the cell culture media. Such sequences are known in the art, and include secretion leader peptides or signal peptides, organelle targeting sequences (e.g., nuclear localization sequences, ER retention signals, mitochondrial transit sequences, chloroplast transit sequences), membrane localization/anchor sequences (e.g., stop transfer sequences, GPI anchor sequences), and the like. Polynucleotides of the invention can be fused, for example, in-frame to such a nucleic acid encoding a secretion and/or localization sequence. Polypeptides expressed by such polynucleotides of the invention may include the amino acid sequence corresponding to the secretion and/or localization sequence(s).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, a vector or polynucleotide of the invention can comprise one or more selectable marker nucleotide sequences or genes to provide a phenotypic trait for selection of transformed host cells, such as dihydrofolate reductase resistance, neomycin resistance, G418 resistance, puromycin resistance, and/or blasticidin resistance for eukaryotic cell culture, or such as tetracycline or ampicillin resistance in \nE. coli. \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nA vector or polynucleotide of the invention can also comprise an origin of replication useful for propagation in a microorganism. The bacterial origin of replication (Ori) utilized is preferably one that does not adversely affect gene expression in mammalian cells. Examples of useful origin of replication sequences include the f1 phage ori, RK2 oriV, pUC ori, and the pSC101 ori. Origin of replication sequences include the ColEI ori and the p15 (available from plasmid pACYC177, New England Biolab, Inc.), alternatively another low copy ori sequence (similar to p15) can be desirable in some contexts. The nucleic acid in this respect desirably acts as a shuttle vector, able to replicate and/or be expressed in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic hosts (e.g., a vector comprising an origin of replication sequences recognized in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention includes a naked DNA or RNA vector, including, for example, a linear expression element (as described in, e.g., Sykes and Johnston (1997) Nat Biotech 17:355-59), a compacted nucleic acid vector (as described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,077,835 and/or Int'l Pat. App. Publ. No. WO 00/70087), a plasmid vector such as pcDNA3.1, pBR322, pUC 19/18, or pUC 118/119, a “midge” minimal-sized nucleic acid vector (as described in, e.g., Schakowski et al. (2001) Mol. Ther. 3:793-800) or as a precipitated nucleic acid vector construct, such as a CaPO\n4 \nprecipitated construct (as described in, e.g., Int'l Patent Appn WO 00/46147, Benvenisty and Reshef (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83:9551-55, Wigler et al. (1978), Cell 14:725, and Coraro and Pearson (1981) Somatic Cell Genetics 7:603), comprising a nucleic acid of the invention. For example, the invention provides a naked DNA plasmid comprising SEQ ID NO:80 operably linked to a CMV promoter or CMV promoter variant and a suitable polyadenylation sequence. Naked nucleotide vectors and the usage thereof are known in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,589,466 and 5,973,972).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA vector of the invention typically is an expression vector that is suitable for expression in a bacterial system, eukaryotic system, mammalian system, or other system (as opposed to a vector designed for replicating the nucleic acid sequence without expression, which can be referred to as a cloning vector). For example, in one aspect, the invention provides a bacterial expression vector comprising a nucleic acid sequence of the invention (e.g., nucleic acid sequence encoding a recombinant mutant CTLA-4-Ig). Suitable vectors include, for example, vectors which direct high level expression of fusion proteins that are readily purified (e.g., multifunctional \nE. coli \ncloning and expression vectors such as BLUESCRIPT (Stratagene), pIN vectors (Van Heeke & Schuster, J. Biol. Chem. 264:5503-5509 (1989); pET vectors (Novagen, Madison Wis.); and the like). While such bacterial expression vectors can be useful in expressing particular polypeptides of the invention, glycoproteins of the invention are preferably expressed in eukaryotic cells and as such the invention also provides eukaryotic expression vectors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe expression vector can be a vector suitable for expression of the nucleic acid of the invention in a yeast cell. Any vector suitable for expression in a yeast system can be employed. Suitable vectors for use in, e.g., \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae \ninclude, e.g., vectors comprising constitutive or inducible promoters such as alpha factor, alcohol oxidase and PGH (reviewed in Ausubel, supra, Berger, supra, and Grant et al., Meth. Enzymol. 153:516-544 (1987)). Usually, the expression vector will be a vector suitable for expression of a nucleic acid of the invention in an animal cell, such as an insect cell (e.g., a SF-9 cell) or a mammalian cell (e.g., a CHO cell, 293 cell, HeLa cell, human fibroblast cell, or similar well-characterized cell). Suitable mammalian expression vectors are known in the art (see, e.g., Kaufman, Mol. Biotechnol. 16(2):151-160 (2000), Van Craenenbroeck, Eur. J. Biochem. 267(18):5665-5678 (2000), Makrides, Protein Expr. Purif. 17(2):183-202 (1999), and Yarranton, Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 3(5):506-511 (1992)). Suitable insect cell plasmid expression vectors also are known (Braun, Biotechniques 26(6):1038-1040:1042 (1999)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn expression vector typically can be propagated in a host cell, which may be a eukaryotic cell (such as a mammalian cell, yeast cell, or plant cell) or a prokaryotic cell, such as a bacterial cell. Introduction of a nucleic acid vector or expression vector into the host cell (e.g., transfection) can be effected by calcium phosphate transfection (see, e.g., calcium phosphate co-precipitation method of Graham et al., Virology 52:456-457 (1973)), DEAE-Dextran mediated transfection, electroporation, gene or vaccine gun, injection, lipofection and biolistics or other common techniques (see, e.g., Kriegler, G\nENE \nT\nRANSFER AND \nE\nXPRESSION\n: A L\nABORATORY \nM\nANUAL\n, Stockton Press (1990); see Davis, L., Dibner, M., and Battey, I., B\nASIC \nM\nETHODS IN \nM\nOLECULAR \nB\nIOLOGY \n(1986) for a description of in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro methods). Cells comprising these and other vectors of the invention form an important part of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention provides an expression vector comprising: (i) a first polynucleotide sequence that encodes a first polypeptide comprising a polypeptide sequence having at least 95%, 96% 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% sequence identity to at least one polypeptide sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS:1-73, wherein said first polypeptide binds human CD86 and/or human CD80 and/or an extracellular domain of either or both, and/or suppresses an immune response, and (ii) a second polynucleotide sequence that encodes a second polypeptide comprising a hinge region, a CH2 domain, and a CH3 domain of an immunoglobulin (Ig) polypeptide. The Ig polypeptide is optionally a human Ig Fc polypeptide (e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG4, etc.) or a mutant Ig Fc polypeptide. (e.g., an Ig Fc polypeptide in which one or more cysteine residues have been substituted with another amino acid (e.g., a serine residue), thereby eliminating one or more disulfide bonds formed between two Ig chains, or in which one or more proline residues is substituted with another amino acid (e.g., proline) to reduce effector function (reduced Fc receptor binding). In another aspect, the invention provides an expression vector comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a fusion protein having at least 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% sequence identity to at least one polypeptide sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS: 74-79, 197-200, 205-214, and 219-222.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional nucleic acids provided by the invention include cosmids. Any suitable cosmid vector can be used to replicate, transfer, and express the nucleic acid sequence of the invention. Typically, a cosmid comprises a bacterial oriV, an antibiotic selection marker, a cloning site, and either one or two cos sites derived from bacteriophage lambda. The cosmid can be a shuttle cosmid or mammalian cosmid, comprising a SV40 oriV and, desirably, suitable mammalian selection marker(s). Cosmid vectors are further described in, e.g., Hohn et al. (1988) Biotechnology 10:113-27.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acids of the invention can be included in and/or administered to a host or host cell in the form of a suitable delivery vehicle (i.e., a vector). The vector can be any suitable vector, including chromosomal, non-chromosomal, and synthetic nucleic acid vectors, or other vectors described above, and may include any combination of the above-described expression elements and/or other transfection-facilitating and/or expression-promoting sequence elements. Examples of such vectors include viruses, bacterial plasmids, phages, cosmids, phagemids, derivatives of SV40, baculovirus, yeast plasmids, vectors derived from combinations of plasmids and phage DNA, and viral nucleic acid (RNA or DNA) vectors, polylysine, and bacterial cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDelivery of a recombinant DNA sequence of the invention can be accomplished with a naked DNA plasmid or plasmid associated with one or more transfection-enhancing agents, as discussed further herein. The plasmid DNA vector can have any suitable combination of features. Plasmid DNA vectors may comprise a strong promoter/enhancer region (e.g., human CMV, RSV, SV40, SL3-3, MMTV, or HIV LTR promoter), an effective poly(A) termination sequence, an origin of replication for plasmid product in \nE. coli\n, an antibiotic resistance gene as selectable marker, and a convenient cloning site (e.g., a polylinker). A particular plasmid vector for delivery of the nucleic acid of the invention in this respect is shown in \nFIG. 1\n; the construction and features of this vector are described in the Examples below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides a non-nucleic acid vector comprising at least one nucleic acid or polypeptide of the invention. Such a non-nucleic acid vector includes, e.g., but is not limited to, a recombinant virus, a viral nucleic acid-protein conjugate (which, with recombinant viral particles, may sometimes be referred to as a viral vector), or a cell, such as recombinant (and usually attenuated) \nSalmonella, Shigella, Listeria\n, and \nBacillus \nCalmette-Guérin (BCG) bacterial cells. Thus, for example, the invention provides a viral vector, insect vector, bacterial vector, or plant vector comprising a nucleic acid of the sequence of the invention. Any suitable viral, insect, plant, or bacterial vector can be used in this respect and a number are known in the art. A viral vector can comprise any number of viral polynucleotides, alone (a viral nucleic acid vector) or more commonly in combination with one or more (typically two, three, or more) viral proteins, which facilitate delivery, replication, and/or expression of the nucleic acid of the invention in a desired host cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, intracellular bacteria (e.g., \nListeria monocytogenes\n) can be used to deliver a nucleic acid of the invention. An exemplary bacterial vector for plasmid DNA delivery of one or more nucleic acids of the invention is \nListeria monocytogenes \n(Lieberman et al., Vaccine 20:2007-2010 (2002)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention includes recombinant or isolated viral vectors that have been modified to comprise one or more nucleic acids or polypeptides of the invention. A viral vector may include a polynucleotide comprising all or part of a viral genome, a viral protein/nucleic acid conjugate, a virus-like particle (VLP), a vector similar to those described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,849,586 and Int'l Patent App. Publ. No. WO 97/04748, or an intact virus particle comprising one or more viral nucleic acids, and the viral vector is typically engineered to include at least one nucleic acid and/or polypeptide of the invention. A viral vector (i.e., a recombinant virus) can comprise a wild-type viral particle or a modified viral particle, particular examples of which are discussed below. Numerous viruses are typically used as vectors for the delivery of exogenous nucleic acids, including at least one nucleic acid of the invention, such as a nucleic acid encoding a mutant CTLA-4 ECD or mutant CTLA-4-Ig described herein. Such vectors include recombinantly modified enveloped or non-enveloped DNA and RNA viruses, typically selected from baculoviridiae, parvoviridiae, picomoviridiae, herpesveridiae, poxyiridae, adenoviridiae, or picornaviridiae. Viral vectors may be wild-type or may be modified by recombinant nucleic acid techniques to be replication deficient, replication competent, or conditionally replicating.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe viral vector can be a vector that requires the presence of another vector or wild-type virus for replication and/or expression (i.e., a helper-dependent virus), such as an adenoviral vector amplicon. Typically, such viral vectors comprise a wild-type viral particle, or a viral particle modified in its protein and/or nucleic acid content to increase transgene capacity or aid in transfection and/or expression of the nucleic acid (examples of such vectors include the herpes virus/AAV amplicons). The viral genome may be modified to include inducible promoters that achieve replication or expression only under certain conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe viral vector can be derived from or comprise a virus that normally infects animals, preferably vertebrates, such as mammals, including, e.g., humans. Suitable viral vector particles in this respect, include, for example, adenoviral vector particles (including any virus of or derived from a virus of the adenoviridae), adeno-associated viral vector particles (AAV vector particles) or other parvoviruses and parvoviral vector particles, papillomaviral vector particles, Semliki-Forest viral vector, flaviviral vectors, picornaviral vectors, alphaviral vectors, herpes viral vectors, pox virus vectors, retroviral vectors, including lentiviral vectors.

Opinion Biotech. 3:533-539 (1992) and Muzcyzka (1992) Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 158:97-129 (1992). Additional types and aspects of AAV vectors are described in, e.g., Buschacher et al., Blood 5(8):2499-504, Carter, Contrib. Microbiol. 4:85-86 (2000), Smith-Arica, Curr. Cardiol.

Adeno-associated viral vectors can be constructed and/or purified using the methods set forth, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,797,368 and Laughlin et al., Gene 23:65-73 (1983).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlphavirus vectors can be gene delivery vectors in other contexts. Alphavirus vectors are known in the art and described in, e.g., Carter (1992) Curr Opinion Biotech 3:533-539, Schlesinger Expert Opin. Biol. Ther. (2001) 1(2):177-91, Polo et al., Dev. Biol. (Basel). 2000; 104:181-5, Wahlfors et al., Gene Ther. (2000) 7(6):472-80, Int'l Pat. App. Publ. Nos. WO 01/81609, WO 00/39318, WO 01/81553, WO 95/07994, WO 92/10578.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother advantageous group of viral vectors are the herpes viral vectors. Examples are described in, e.g., Lachmann et al., Curr. Opin. Mol. Ther. (1999) 1(5):622-32, Fraefel et al., Adv. Virus Res. (2000) 55:425-51, Huard et al., Neuromuscul. Disord. (1997) 7(5):299-313, Frenkel et al., Gene Ther. (1994) Suppl 1:S40-6, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,261,552 and 5,599,691.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRetroviral vectors, including lentiviral vectors, also can be advantageous gene delivery vehicles in particular contexts. There are numerous retroviral vectors known in the art. Examples of retroviral vectors are described in, e.g., Miller, Curr Top Microbiol. Immunol. (1992) 158:1-24, Weber et al., Curr. Opin. Mol. Ther. (2001) 3(5):439-53, Hu et al., Pharmacol. Rev. (2000) 52(4):493-511, Kim et al., Adv. Virus Res. (2000) 55:545-63, Palu et al., Rev. Med. Virol. (2000) 10(3):185-202, Takeuchi et al., Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. (2000) 465:23-35, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,326,195, 5,888,502, 5,580,766, and 5,672,510.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBaculovirus vectors are another advantageous group of viral vectors, particularly for the production of polypeptides of the invention. The production and use of baculovirus vectors is known (see, e.g., Kost, Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 10(5):428-433 (1999); Jones, Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 7(5):512-516 (1996)). Where the vector is used for therapeutic uses, the vector will be selected such that it is able to adequately infect (or in the case of nucleic acid vectors transfect or transform) target cells in which the desired therapeutic effect is desired.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdenoviral vectors also can be suitable viral vectors for gene transfer. Adenoviral vectors are well known in the art and described in, e.g., Graham et al. (1995) Mol. Biotechnol. 33(3):207-220, Stephenson (1998) Clin. Diagn. Virol. 10(2-3):187-94, Jacobs (1993) Clin Sci (Lond). 85(2):117-22, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,922,576, 5,965,358 and 6,168,941 and International Patent Applications WO 98/22588, WO 98/56937, WO 99/15686, WO 99/54441, and WO 00/32754. Adenoviral vectors, herpes viral vectors, and Sindbis viral vectors, useful in the practice of the invention and suitable for organismal in vivo transduction and expression of nucleic acids of the invention, are generally described in, e.g., Jolly (1994) Cancer Gene Therapy 1:51-64, Latchman (1994) Molec. Biotechnol. 2:179-195, and Johanning et al. (1995) Nucl. Acids Res. 23:1495-1501.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe virus vector may be replication-deficient in a host cell. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors, which are naturally replication-deficient in the absence of complementing adenoviruses or at least adenovirus gene products (provided by, e.g., a helper virus, plasmid, or complementation cell), are included. By “replication-deficient” is meant that the viral vector comprises a genome that lacks at least one replication-essential gene function. A deficiency in a gene, gene function, or gene or genomic region, as used herein, is defined as a deletion of sufficient genetic material of the viral genome to impair or obliterate the function of the gene whose nucleic acid sequence was deleted in whole or in part. Replication-essential gene functions are those gene functions that are required for replication (i.e., propagation) of a replication-deficient viral vector. The essential gene functions of the viral vector particle vary with the type of viral vector particle at issue. Examples of replication-deficient viral vector particles are described in, e.g., Marconi et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93(21):11319-20 (1996), Johnson and Friedmann, Methods Cell Biol. 43 (pt. A):211-30 (1994), Timiryasova et al., J. Gene Med. 3(5):468-77 (2001), Burton et al., Stem Cells 19(5):358-77 (2001), Kim et al., Virology 282(1):154-67 (2001), Jones et al., Virology 278(1):137-50 (2000), Gill et al., J. Med. Virol. 62(2):127-39 (2000). Other replication-deficient vectors are based on simple MLV vectors (Miller et al. (1990) Mol. Cell. Biol. 10:4239; Kolberg (1992) J. NIH Res. 4:43, and Cornetta et al. (1991) Hum. Gene. Ther. 2:215). Canary pox vectors are advantageous in infecting human cells but being naturally incapable of replication therein (i.e., without genetic modification).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe basic construction of recombinant viral vectors is well understood in the art and involves using standard molecular biological techniques such as those described in, e.g., Sambrook et al., M\nOLECULAR \nC\nLONING\n: A L\nABORATORY \nM\nANUAL \n(Cold Spring Harbor Press 1989) and the third edition thereof (2001), Ausubel et al., C\nURRENT \nP\nROTOCOLS IN \nM\nOLECULAR \nB\nIOLOGY \n(Wiley Interscience Publishers 1995), and Watson, supra, and several of the other references mentioned herein. For example, adenoviral vectors can be constructed and/or purified using the methods set forth, for example, in Graham et al., Mol. Biotechnol. 33(3):207-220 (1995), U.S. Pat. No. 5,965,358, Donthine et al., Gene Ther. 7(20):1707-14 (2000), and other references described herein. Adeno-associated viral vectors can be constructed and/or purified using the methods set forth, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,797,368 and Laughlin et al., Gene 23:65-73 (1983). Similar techniques are known in the art with respect to other viral vectors, particularly with respect to herpes viral vectors (see e.g., Lachman et al., Curr. Opin. Mol. Ther. 1(5):622-32 (1999)), lentiviral vectors, and other retroviral vectors. In general, the viral vector comprises an insertion of the nucleic acid (for example, a wild-type adenoviral vector can comprise an insertion of up to 3 KB without deletion), or, more typically, comprises one or more deletions of the virus genome to accommodate insertion of the nucleic acid and additional nucleic acids, as desired, and to prevent replication in host cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-viral vectors, such as, e.g., DNA plasmids, naked nucleic acids, and nucleic acid complexed with a delivery vehicle such as a liposome, also can be associated with molecules that target the vector to a particular region in the host (e.g., a particular organ, tissue, and/or cell type). For example, a nucleotide can be conjugated to a targeting protein, such as a viral protein that binds a receptor or a protein that binds a receptor of a particular target (e.g., by modification of the techniques in Wu et al., J. Biol. Chem. 263(29):14621-24 (1988)). Targeted cationic lipid compositions are known (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,120,799). Other techniques for targeting genetic constructs are provided in Int'l Pat. App. Publ. No. WO 99/41402.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExpression Hosts\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides engineered host cells transduced, transfected or transformed with a vector of the invention (e.g., a cloning vector or expression vector) or a nucleic acid of the invention. The engineered host cells can be cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for activating promoters, selecting transformants, or amplifying the nucleic acid of interest. The culture conditions, such as temperature, pH, and the like, are those previously used with the host cell selected for expression, and will be apparent to those skilled in the art and in the references cited herein, including, e.g., Freshney (1994) Culture of Animal Cells, a Manual of Basic Technique, 3rd ed., Wiley-Liss, New York and the references cited therein. Polypeptides of the invention encoded by such vectors or nucleic acids of the invention are expressed in such host cells and can be isolated by standard techniques. For example, polypeptides released into the cell culture can be isolated from the culture by ultracentrifugation or similar techniques.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe polypeptides of the invention can be produced in a variety of expression hosts, including, but not limited to, animal cells, such as mammalian cells (e.g., CHO cells), including human and non-human primate cells, and in non-animal cells, such as plants, yeast, fungi, bacteria, and the like. Examples of suitable expression hosts include bacterial cells, such as \nE. coli, Streptomyces\n, and \nSalmonella typhimurium\n; fungal cells, such as \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae, Pichia pastoris\n, and \nNeurospora crassa\n; insect cells such as \nDrosophila \nand \nSpodoptera frugiperda\n; mammalian cells, such as CHO (e.g., CHO-K1), COS (e.g., COS-1, COS-7), BHK, and HEK (e.g., HEK 293) cells, Bowes melanoma cells, and plant cells. As noted above, the invention is not limited by the host cells employed. In addition to Sambrook, Berger and Ausubel, all supra, details regarding cell culture are found in, e.g., Payne et al. (1992) Plant Cell and Tissue Culture in Liquid Systems John Wiley & Sons, Inc. New York, N.Y.; Gamborg and Phillips (eds.) (1995) Plant Cell, Tissue and Organ Culture; Fundamental Methods Springer Lab Manual, Springer-Verlag (Berlin Heidelberg NY); Atlas & Parks (eds.) The Handbook of Microbiological Media (1993) CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla. Such host cells can be adapted to growth in serum-free, protein-free medium, animal component-free medium, such as, e.g., a chemically defined (CD) medium (such as, e.g., CD OptiCHO™ (Invitrogen, #12681) using procedures known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention provides a cell(s) comprising any one or more of the nucleic acids, vectors, or other constructs of the invention (e.g., a construct expressing a mutant CTLA-4 ECD or mutant CTLA-4-Ig) described herein or any combination thereof. Also included is a cell comprising one or more of any of the polypeptides, antibodies, or fusion proteins, or other constructs of the invention described herein, or any combination of one or more of these. A cell of the invention is typically an isolated or recombinant cell and may comprise a host cell. Such a cell, e.g., recombinant cell, may be modified by transformation, transfection, and/or infection with at least one nucleic acid, vector, or other construct of the invention. Such a cell can be a eukaryotic cell (e.g., mammalian, yeast, or plant cell) or a prokaryotic cell (e.g., bacterial cell) and can be transformed with any such construct of the invention using a variety of known methods, including, e.g., calcium phosphate transfection (see, e.g., calcium phosphate co-precipitation method), DEAE-Dextran mediated transfection, electroporation (Irving et al., Cell 64:891-901 (1991)), gene or vaccine gun, injection, lipofection and biolistics or other common techniques as noted above. See also Inovio Biomedical Corp. electroporation methods and technology at the worldwide website address inovio.com.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA host cell strain is optionally chosen for its ability to modulate the expression of the inserted sequences or to process the expressed protein in the desired fashion. Such modifications of the protein include, but are not limited to, acetylation, carboxylation, glycosylation, phosphorylation, lipidation and acylation. Different host cells such as \nE. coli, Bacillus \nsp., yeast, or mammalian cells, such as CHO, HeLa, BHK, MDCK, HEK 293, WI38, etc. have specific cellular machinery and characteristic mechanisms for such post-translational activities and may be chosen to ensure the correct modification and processing of the introduced foreign protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA nucleic acid of the invention can be inserted into an appropriate host cell (in culture or in a host organism) to permit the host to express a protein of interest (e.g., mutant CTLA-4 ECD or mutant CTLA-4-Ig). Any suitable host cell can be transformed/transduced by the nucleic acids of the invention. Examples of appropriate expression hosts include: bacterial cells, such as \nE. coli, Streptomyces, Bacillus \nsp., and \nSalmonella typhimurium\n; fungal cells, such as \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae, Pichia pastoris\n, and \nNeurospora crassa\n; insect cells such as \nDrosophila \nand \nSpodoptera frugiperda\n; mammalian cells such as Vero cells, HeLa cells, CHO cells (e.g., CHO-K1), COS cells, WI38 cells, NIH-3T3 cells (and other fibroblast cells, such as MRC-5 cells), MDCK cells, KB cells, SW-13 cells, MCF7 cells, BHK cells, HEK-293 cells, Bowes melanoma cells, and plant cells, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides host cells that are transduced, transformed or transfected with at least one nucleic acid or vector of the invention. As discussed above, a vector of the invention typically comprises a nucleic acid of the invention. Host cells are genetically engineered (e.g., transduced, transformed, infected, or transfected) with the vectors of the invention, which may be, e.g., a cloning vector or an expression vector. The vector may be in the form of a plasmid, a viral particle, a phage, attenuated bacteria, or any other suitable type of vector. Host cells suitable for transduction and/or infection with viral vectors of the invention for production of the recombinant polypeptides of the invention and/or for replication of the viral vector of the invention include the above-described cells. Examples of cells that have been demonstrated as suitable for packaging of viral vector particles are described in, e.g., Polo et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 96(8):4598-603 (1999), Farson et al., J. Gene Med. 1(3):195-209 (1999), Sheridan et al., Mol. Ther. 2(3):262-75 (2000), Chen et al., Gene Ther. 8(9):697-703 (2001), and Pizzaro et al., Gene Ther. 8(10):737-745 (2001). For replication-deficient viral vectors, such as AAV vectors, complementing cell lines, cell lines transformed with helper viruses, or cell lines transformed with plasmids encoding essential genes, are needed for replication of the viral vector.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe engineered host cells can be cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for activating promoters, selecting transformants, or amplifying the gene of interest. Host cells can be cultured in serum-containing medium or serum-free medium. Host cells can be cultured in a serum-free, protein-free, animal component-free medium, including, e.g., a chemically defined medium (e.g., CD OptiCHO™ (Invitrogen, #12681)). The cell culture medium can be supplemented, if desired, with supplements known to those of skill, such as, e.g., one or more amino acid(s), such L-glutamine (e.g., 2% v/v 200 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen, #25031)).

For example, cell lines that stably express a polypeptide of the invention can be transduced with expression vectors comprising viral origins of replication and/or endogenous expression elements and a selectable marker gene. Following the introduction of the vector, cells in the cell line may be allowed to grow for 1-2 days in an enriched media before they are switched to selective media. The purpose of the selectable marker is to confer resistance to selection, and its presence allows growth and recovery of cells that successfully express the introduced sequences. For example, resistant clumps of stably transformed cells can be proliferated using tissue culture techniques appropriate to the cell type. Serum-free media are readily available (e.g., JRH Biosciences, SAFC Biosciences, Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, worldwide web at sigmaaldrich.com). Serum-free media or conditioned medium (e.g., growth medium previously harvested from untransfected or naïve cell cultures) may be preferred for protein production or cell-banking in some instances.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention includes immortalized cells or cell lines comprising one or more polypeptides (including, e.g., dimeric or monomeric fusion proteins and multimeric polypeptides), conjugates, nucleic acids, or vectors or the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHost cells transformed with an expression vector and/or polynucleotide are optionally cultured under conditions suitable for the expression and recovery of the encoded protein from cell culture. The polypeptide or fragment thereof produced by such a recombinant cell may be secreted, membrane-bound, or contained intracellularly, depending on the sequence and/or the vector used. Expression vectors comprising polynucleotides encoding mature polypeptides of the invention can be designed with signal sequences that direct secretion of the mature polypeptides through a prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell membrane. Such signal sequences are typically incorporated into the vector such that the signal sequence is expressed at the N-terminus of the polypeptide of the invention. Principles related to such signal sequences are discussed elsewhere herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolypeptide Production and Recovery\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing transduction of a suitable host strain and growth of the host strain to an appropriate cell density, the selected promoter is induced by appropriate means (e.g., temperature shift or chemical induction) and cells are cultured for an additional period. Cells are typically harvested by centrifugation, disrupted by physical or chemical means, and the resulting crude extract retained for further purification. Microbial cells employed in expression of proteins can be disrupted by any convenient method, including freeze-thaw cycling, sonication, mechanical disruption, or use of cell lysing agents, or other methods, which are well know to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs noted, many references are available for the culture and production of many cells, including cells of bacterial, plant, animal (especially mammalian) and archebacterial origin.

Additional information for cell culture is found in available commercial literature such as the Life Science Research Cell Culture Catalogue (1998) from Sigma-Aldrich, Inc. (St. Louis, Mo.) (“Sigma-LSRCCC”) and, e.g., the Plant Culture Catalogue and supplement (1997) also from Sigma-Aldrich, Inc (St. Louis, Mo.) (“Sigma-PCCS”).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolypeptides of the invention can be recovered and purified from recombinant cell cultures by any of a number of methods well known in the art, including ammonium sulfate or ethanol precipitation, acid extraction, anion or cation exchange chromatography, phosphocellulose chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, affinity chromatography (e.g., using any of the tagging systems noted herein), hydroxylapatite chromatography, and lectin chromatography. Protein refolding steps can be used, as desired, in completing configuration of the mature protein. Finally, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) can be employed in the final purification steps. In addition to the references noted supra, a variety of purification methods are well known in the art, including, e.g., those set forth in Sandana (1997) Bioseparation of Proteins, Academic Press, Inc.; and Bollag et al.

For example, in place of the LEA29Y-encoding nucleic acid, a nucleic acid sequence encoding a mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide of the invention (e.g., D3-54 polypeptide) can be cloned into the IgG2 Fc fusion vector to produce a vector encoding the mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein (e.g., D3-54-IgG2), stable CHO-K1 cells expressing such mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein can be made by transfecting such cells with the mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein-encoding vector, and the resultant mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein (e.g., D3-54-IgG2) can be expressed (typically in dimeric form) and purified as described in Example 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn Vitro Expression Systems\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCell-free transcription/translation systems can also be employed to produce recombinant polypeptides of the invention or fragments thereof using DNAs and/or RNAs of the present invention or fragments thereof. Several such systems are commercially available. A general guide to in vitro transcription and translation protocols is found in Tymms (1995) I\nN VITRO \nT\nRANSCRIPTION AND \nT\nRANSLATION \nP\nROTOCOLS\n: M\nETHODS IN \nM\nOLECULAR \nB\nIOLOGY\n, \nVolume\n 37, Garland Publishing, New York.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods of the Invention\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolypeptides (including, e.g., dimeric and monomeric fusion proteins and multimeric polypeptides), conjugates, compositions, nucleic acids, vectors, and cells of the invention exhibit a variety of properties and characteristics and are believed useful in a variety of applications, including, but not limited to, e.g., in prophylactic or therapeutic methods for treating a variety of immune system diseases, disorders and conditions in which modulation or regulation of the immune system and immune system responses may be of benefit. For example, polypeptides, conjugates, compositions, nucleic acids, vectors, and cells of the invention that have an ability to bind CD80 and/or CD86 or an ECD of either or both and/or an ability to inhibit an immune response are believed to be useful in prophylactic and/or therapeutic methods for inhibiting or suppressing an immune response in a subject, methods for inhibiting rejection of a tissue, cell, or organ transplant from a donor by a recipient, and other methods described elsewhere herein. Some such polypeptides, conjugates, compositions, nucleic acids, vectors, and cells of the invention are expected to be useful in methods for method of modulating or inhibiting the interaction of T cells expressing CD28 and/or CTLA-4 with B7-positive cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, therapeutic or prophylactic methods of the invention involve administering to a subject an effective amount of at least one such polypeptide (including, e.g., fusion protein, multimer, etc.), conjugate, composition, nucleic acid, vector, and/or cell to suppress or inhibit an immune response. In a therapeutic context, the subject is typically one inflicted with an immune system disease, disorder, or condition, and administration is conducted to prevent further progression of the disease, disorder or condition. For example, administration of a molecule of the invention to a subject suffering from an immune system disease (e.g., autoimmune disease) can result in suppression or inhibition of such immune system attack or biological responses associated therewith. By suppressing this immune system attack on healthy body tissues, the resulting physical symptoms (e.g., pain, joint inflammation, joint swelling or tenderness) resulting from or associated with such attack on healthy tissues can be decreased or alleviated, and the biological and physical damage resulting from or associated with the immune system attack can be decreased, retarded, or stopped.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a prophylactic context, the subject may be one inflicted with, susceptible to, or believed to present an immune system disease, disorder or condition, and administration is typically conducted to prevent progression of the disease, disorder or condition, inhibit or alleviate symptoms, signs, or biological responses associated therewith, prevent bodily damage potentially resulting therefrom, and/or maintain or improve the subject's physical functioning.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention provides a method of modulating the interaction of T cells expressing CD28 and/or CTLA-4 with B7-positive cells, the method comprising contacting B7-positive cells with at least one of the following in an effective amount to modulate the interaction of B7-positive cells with CD28-positive T cells and/or CTLA-4-positive T cells: (1) a polypeptide of the invention (e.g., mutant CTLA-4-ECD polypeptide or dimeric or monomeric mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein); (2) a multimer comprising one of more polypeptides of the invention (e.g., a dimer comprising any two such polypeptides or a tetramer comprising any four such polypeptides); (3) a conjugate comprising at least one polypeptide of the invention; (4) a nucleic acid of the invention (e.g., a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide of the invention); (5) a vector comprising a nucleic acid of the invention or encoding a polypeptide of the invention; (6) a cell or population of cells comprising a polypeptide, nucleic acid, conjugate, and/or vector of the invention; and/or (7) composition of the invention, wherein the interaction of B7-positive cells with CD28-positive T cells and/or CTLA-4-positive T cells is modulated. Typically, the modulatory effect is an inhibitory effect such that the interaction of B7-positive cells with CD28-positive T cells and/or CTLA-4-positive T cells is inhibited. In some instances, the B7-positive cells are antigen-presenting cells (APCs). In some such methods, the interaction of B7-2-positive cells (e.g., APCs expressing B7-2 (CD86)) with CD28-positive T cells is inhibited. In some such methods, the interaction of B7-1-positive cells (e.g., APCs expressing B7-1 (CD80)) with CD28-positive T cells is inhibited.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides a method of inhibiting the interaction of CD28-positive T cells and/or CTLA-4-positive T cells with B7-positive cells, the method comprising contacting B7-positive cells (e.g., B7-1-positive cells and/or B7-2-positive cells) with at least one of the following molecules or components of the invention in an effective amount to inhibit the interaction of CD28-positive T cells and/or CTLA-4-positive T cells with B7-positive cells: (1) a polypeptide of the invention (e.g., mutant CTLA-4-ECD polypeptide or dimeric or monomeric mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein); (2) a multimer comprising one of more polypeptides of the invention (e.g., a dimer comprising any two such polypeptides or a tetramer comprising any four such polypeptides); (3) a conjugate comprising at least one polypeptide of the invention; (4) a nucleic acid of the invention (e.g., a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide of the invention); (5) a vector comprising a nucleic acid of the invention or encoding a polypeptide of the invention; (6) a cell or population of cells comprising a polypeptide, nucleic acid, conjugate, and/or vector of the invention; and/or (7) composition of the invention, wherein the interaction of CD28-positive T cells and/or CTLA-4-positive T cells with B7-positive cells is inhibited. In some instances, the B7-positive cells are APCs. In some instances, the interaction of CD28-positive T cells with hB7-1-positive cells and/or hB7-2-positive cells is inhibited. In some such methods, inhibition of the interaction of CD28-positive T cells with hB7-1-positive cells and/or hB7-2-positive cells results in suppression or inhibition of one or more of the following: T cell activation or proliferation, cytokine synthesis or production (e.g., production of TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-2), induction of various activation markers (e.g., CD25, IL-2 receptor), inflammation, joint swelling or tenderness, serum level of C-reactive protein, anti-collagen antibody production, and/or T cell-dependent antibody response(s).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some such methods, at least one such molecule or component of the invention is administered to a subject in an effective amount to inhibit the interaction of endogenous CD28-positive T cells with endogenous B7-1-positive cells and/or B7-2-positive cells in the subject. In some such methods, the interaction of endogenous CD28-positive T cells with endogenous B7-positive cells expressing B7-2 (CD86) or B7-1 (CD80) is inhibited. In some instances, the B7-positive cells are APCs which express B7-2 or B7-1, and the interaction of B7-2 or B7-1 with CD28-positive T cells is inhibited. In some instances, the interaction of both B7-2 and B7-1 expressed on APCs with CD28-positive T cells is inhibited.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides a method of suppressing an immune response in vitro or in vivo. The method comprises contacting a B7-positive cells with at least one of the following molecules or components of the invention in effective amount to suppress an immune response: (1) a polypeptide of the invention (e.g., mutant CTLA-4-ECD polypeptide or dimeric or monomeric mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein); (2) a multimer comprising one of more polypeptides of the invention (e.g., a dimer comprising any two such polypeptides or a tetramer comprising any four such polypeptides); (3) a conjugate comprising at least one polypeptide of the invention; (4) a nucleic acid of the invention (e.g., a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide of the invention); (5) a vector comprising a nucleic acid of the invention or encoding a polypeptide of the invention; (6) a cell or population of cells comprising a polypeptide, nucleic acid, conjugate, and/or vector of the invention; and/or (7) composition of the invention, wherein an immune response is thereby suppressed. One or more immune responses may be suppressed, including, e.g., T cell response, T cell proliferation or activation, cytokine synthesis or production, inflammation, joint swelling or tenderness, serum level of C-reactive protein, anti-collagen antibody production, and/or T cell-dependent antibody response(s). In such methods comprising contacting a B7-positive cell with a polypeptide of the invention, the polypeptide binds B7-1 (e.g., human B7-1) expressed on B7-positive cells, and/or binds B7-2 (e.g., human B7-2) expressed on B7-positive cells. In some instances, the B7-positive cells are APCs. In some instances, an immune response is suppressed in vitro, such as in, e.g., an in vitro assay, including those described in detail elsewhere herein (see, e.g., the Examples below). In some instances, an immune response is suppressed in vivo in a subject to whom an effective amount to suppress an immune response is administered, such as, e.g., in the therapeutic or prophylactic treatment methods (e.g., method of treating rheumatic disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis, or other autoimmune disease) discussed in detail elsewhere herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides a method of suppressing an immune response in a subject (e.g., mammal, such as a human). The method comprises administering to a subject in need thereof with at least one of the following molecules or components of the invention in a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount (e.g., therapeutically or prophylactically effective dose) which suppresses an immune response in the subject: (1) a polypeptide of the invention (e.g., mutant CTLA-4-ECD polypeptide or dimeric or monomeric mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein); (2) a multimer comprising one of more polypeptides of the invention (e.g., a dimer comprising any two such polypeptides or a tetramer comprising any four such polypeptides); (3) a conjugate comprising at least one polypeptide of the invention; (4) a nucleic acid of the invention (e.g., a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide of the invention); (5) a vector comprising a nucleic acid of the invention or encoding a polypeptide of the invention; (6) a cell or population of cells comprising a polypeptide, nucleic acid, conjugate, and/or vector of the invention; and/or (7) composition of the invention, wherein an immune response is thereby suppressed in the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides a method of treating a subject having an immune system disease or disorder modulated by interaction of endogenous T cells with endogenous cells expressing CD80 and/or CD86. The method comprises administering to a subject in need of such treatment a therapeutically effective amount of: (1) a polypeptide of the invention (e.g., mutant CTLA-4-ECD polypeptide or dimeric or monomeric mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein); (2) a multimer comprising one of more polypeptides of the invention (e.g., a dimer comprising any two such polypeptides or a tetramer comprising any four such polypeptides); (3) a conjugate comprising at least one polypeptide of the invention; (4) a nucleic acid of the invention (e.g., a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide of the invention); (5) a vector comprising a nucleic acid of the invention or encoding a polypeptide of the invention; (6) a cell or population of cells comprising a polypeptide, nucleic acid, conjugate, and/or vector of the invention; and/or (7) composition of the invention, thereby treating the immune system disease or disorder in the subject. If the subject is a human, CD80 is human CD80, CD86 is human CD86, and CD28 is human CD28. In some such methods, interaction between endogenous T cells expressing CD28 and endogenous cells expressing CD86 and/or endogenous cells expressing CD80 is inhibited.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is believed that a variety of immune system diseases or disorders, including rheumatic or autoimmune system disease or disorder, may be effectively treated using one or more of the molecules of the invention disclosed herein, such as, e.g., a mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide (e.g., any of SEQ ID NOS:1-73, such as, e.g., D3-54 (SEQ ID NO:36), D3-69 (SEQ ID NO:50), or D3-27 (SEQ ID NO:24) mutant CTLA-4 ECD), or a fusion protein thereof (e.g., D3-54-IgG2 (SEQ ID NO:197 or 211), D3-69-IgG2 (SEQ ID NO:199 or 213), D3-29-IgG2 (SEQ ID NO:79 or 210)).

For example, the effective amount or dose of the fusion protein dimer may comprise from about 0.001 mg/kg body weight of the subject to at least about 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 75, 80, 90, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 225, 250, or 300 mg/kg body weight of the subject (such as, e.g., human, including an adult human). In some instances, the effective amount or dose is from about 0.001 milligrams (mg) to about 50 milligrams per kilogram (kg) body weight of the subject, including, but not limited to, e.g., from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg body weight of the subject (e.g., human), from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg body weight of the subject, or from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 25 mg/kg weight of the subject; for example, about 0.05 mg/kg, 0.075 mg/kg, 0.1 mg/kg, 0.15 mg/kg, 0.2 mg/kg, 0.25 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, 0.75 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 1.5 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg, 2.5 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, about 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, 25 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg, 75 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg body weight of the subject (e.g., adult human patient) is administered to the subject.

In some aspects, the effective amount or dose is less than about 500 mg for a subject weighing less than 60 kg (e.g., less than about 100 mg, 75 mg, 50 mg, 25 mg, 12.5 mg. or 10 mg), less than about 750 mg for a subject weighing between 60-100 kg (e.g., less than about 150 mg, 100 mg, 75 mg, 37.5 mg, or 20 mg), or less than about 1000 mg for a subject weighing more than 100 kg (e.g., less than about 500 mg, 100 mg, 50 mg, 25 mg, or 10 mg).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effective amount or dose of a nucleic acid, vector, composition, and/or cell of the invention sufficient to similarly suppress an immune response or modulate, treat an immune system disease or disorder modulated by interaction of T cells with B7-expressing cells, or modulate or inhibit the interaction of T cells expressing CD28 and/or CTLA-4 with B7-positive cells can be determined. For example, if a vector encoding such a fusion protein dimer of the invention is to be administered to the subject, one skilled in the art can readily determine the amount of the vector to be administered such that a desired therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of the fusion protein dimer is likely produced in the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary fusion protein dimers of the invention include any of those described in detail above and herein, including, e.g., a fusion protein dimer comprising two identical fusion protein monomers, wherein each fusion protein monomer comprises a mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide of the invention fused at its C-terminus to the N-terminus of an Ig Fc polypeptide (e.g., IgG2 Fc, IgG1, IgG4 or mutant Ig Fc polypeptide which reduces effector function). An exemplary mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide is one comprising a polypeptide sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS:1-73. An exemplary fusion protein dimer is one comprising two fusion protein monomers, wherein each fusion protein monomer comprises a polypeptide sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS:74-79, 197-200, 205-214, and 219-222. Typically, the two monomeric fusion proteins in a dimeric fusion protein are covalently linked together via at least one disulfide bond formed between cysteine residue(s) present in each monomer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn any of the methods described above, the molecule or component of the invention (e.g., polypeptide (including, e.g., dimeric or monomeric fusion protein or polypeptide multimer), conjugate, nucleic acid, vector, composition, and/or cell of the invention) may be administered to the subject as a composition. The composition typically comprises at least one such molecule or component and an excipient, carrier, or diluent. The composition may comprise a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one such molecule or component and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, carrier, or diluent (e.g., PBS). The pH of compositions of the invention typically ranges from about pH 6.0 to about pH 9.0, including, e.g., from about pH 6.5 to about pH 8.5, usually from about pH 7.0 to about pH 8.0. In one aspect, the pH of compositions of the invention typically ranges from about \npH\n 3 to about \npH\n 10, from about \npH\n 4 to about \npH\n 10, from about \npH\n 5 to about \npH\n 9, from about \npH\n 6 to about \npH\n 9, from about pH 5.5 to about pH 8.5, from about pH 6.0 to about pH 6.7, from about pH 6.0 to about pH 6.5, from about pH 6.2 to about pH 8.7, from about pH 6.5 to about pH 7.5, from about pH 6.2 to about pH 7.0, from about pH 6.3 to about pH 6.8, from about pH 6.4 to about pH 6.8, and about pH 7.0 to about pH 7.4. In one aspect, a composition comprising at least one such molecule or component of the invention, such as, e.g., a mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein, has a pH of pH 5.5, pH 6.0, pH 6.1, pH 6.2, pH 6.3, pH 6.4, pH 6.5, pH 6.6, pH 6.7, pH 6.8, pH 6.9, pH 7.0, pH 7.1, pH 7.2, pH 7.3, pH 7.4, pH 7.5, pH 7.6, pH 7.7, pH 7.8, pH 7.9, pH 8.0, pH 8.1, pH 8.2, pH 8.3, pH 8.4, pH 8.5, pH 8.6, pH 8.7, pH 8.8, pH 8.9, pH 9.0, pH 9.1, pH 9.2, pH 9.3, pH 9.4, pH 9.5, pH 9.6, pH 9.7, pH 9.8, pH, 9.9, or pH 10.0. Some compositions of the invention include one or more salts (e.g., sodium chloride, sodium phosphate, calcium chloride, and the like), one or more buffers (e.g., HEPES, sodium citrate, sodium phosphate (e.g., Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n/Na\n3\nPO\n4\n), succinate, tartrate, fumarate, gluconate, oxalate, lactate, acetate, tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris), and the like), one, two three, four, five, or more saccharides or sugars (e.g., sucrose, mannose, maltose, trehalose, dextrose, and the like), and/or one, two, three, four or more polyalcohols or sugar alcohols (e.g., mannitol, sorbitol, glycol, glycerol, arabitol, erythritol, xylitol, ribitol, lactitol, and the like). One, two three, four, five, or more monosaccharides, disaccharides and/or polysaccharides can be included in the composition. The composition of the invention may comprise any concentration of such molecule or component effective to suppress an immune response when administered to the subject. For example, in some such methods (including, e.g., methods in which immunosuppression is desirable, such as, but not limited, to, e.g., treatment of rheumatoid arthritis or similar immune disorders, or for inhibiting rejection of a tissue, cell, graft, or organ transplant from a donor by a recipient subject), a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, excipient, or diluent and a fusion protein dimer of the invention is administered to the subject (e.g., parentally, subcutaneously, intravenously, intramuscularly, etc.), wherein the pharmaceutical composition comprises a fusion protein dimer of the invention at a concentration of from about 0.001 mg/ml to about 200 mg/ml, about 0.001 mg/ml to about 300 mg/ml, about 0.01 mg/ml to about 200 mg/ml, about 0.01 mg/ml to about 250 mg/ml, about 0.1 mg/ml to about 200 mg/ml, about 0.001 mg/ml to about 100 mg/ml, about 0.001 mg/ml to about 90 mg/ml, about 0.01 mg/ml to about 90 mg/ml, about 0.01 mg/ml to about 75 mg/ml, about 0.1 to about 80 mg/ml, about 0.1 to about 75 mg/ml, about 0.1 to about 60 mg/ml, about 0.1 to about 50 mg/ml, about 0.1 to about 40 mg/ml, about 0.1 to about 30 mg/ml, about 1 to about 90 mg/ml, about 1 to about 80 mg/ml, about 1 to about 75 mg/ml, about 1 to about 60 mg/ml, about 1 to about 50 mg/ml, about 1 to about 40 mg/ml, about 1 to about 30 mg/ml, about 1 to about 20 mg/ml, about 1 to about 10 mg/ml, about 1 to about 5 mg/ml, about 5 to about 90 mg/ml, about 5 to about 80 mg/ml, about 5 to about 75 mg/ml, about 5 to about 60 mg/ml, about 5 to about 50 mg/ml, about 5 to about 40 mg/ml, about 5 to about 30 mg/ml, about 5 to about 20 mg/ml, about 5 to about 10 mg/ml, about 1 to about 5 mg/ml, about 10 to about 75 mg/ml, about 25 mg/ml to about 75 mg/ml, about 30 mg/ml to about 60 mg/ml, about 25 to about 50 mg/ml, about 50 mg/ml to about 100 mg/ml, including, e.g., about 1 mg/ml, 5 mg/ml, 10 mg/ml, about 15 mg/ml, about 25 mg/ml, about 30 mg/ml, about 40 mg/ml, about 50 mg/ml, about 60 mg/ml, about 70 mg/ml, about 80 mg/ml, about 90 mg/ml, or 100 mg/ml. Other concentrations are contemplated. In some methods of the invention described herein, including some therapeutic or prophylactic methods, a volume of any such composition (e.g., pharmaceutical composition) comprising a fusion protein of the invention in a range of about 0.01 milliliter (ml) to about 10 ml, about 0.01 ml to about 5 ml, about 0.1 ml to about 5 ml, about 0.5 ml to about 2 ml, about 1 ml to about 2 ml, including, e.g., a volume of 0.01 ml, 0.025 ml, 0.05 ml, 0.1 ml, 0.2 ml, 0.3 ml, 0.4 ml, 0.5 ml, 0.75 ml, 1 ml, 2 ml, 3 ml, 4 ml, 5 ml, 10 ml, 20 ml, 25 ml, 50 ml, 75 ml, 100 ml, 200 ml, 250 ml, 300 ml, 500 ml, 1000 ml, etc. is administered to a subject via a single i.v., s.c., i.m., or i.p. injection. Further details of exemplary compositions of the invention are discussed elsewhere herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effective amount or dose of a molecule of the invention that is administered to a particular subject may vary depending upon, e.g., the disease, disorder, or condition being treated, the potency of the particular mutant CTLA-4 molecule of the invention (i.e., its efficacy) (e.g., a mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein dimer of the invention) to be administered, the mode of administration of the molecule, and the subject's individual ability to tolerate a specific amount of the particular molecule. For example, in a method for suppressing an immune response in a subject having rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or a method for treating RA, the effective amount or dose of a mutant CTLA-4-Ig dimer of the invention (e.g., D3-29-IGg2, D3-54-IgG2, D3-56-IgG2, D3-69-IgG2, D3-75-IgG2, etc.) to be administered to the subject can be determined based on a variety of factors, including the potency of the mutant CTLA-4-Ig dimer, the mode of administration of the dimer, and/or the severity of the subject's symptoms or signs of rheumatoid arthritis. In one aspect, an effective amount or dose of a particular mutant CTLA-4-Ig dimer of the invention can be determined by comparing the potency of such mutant CTLA-4-Ig dimer with that of the Orencia® dimer. Doses of the Orencia® dimer effective for treating rheumatoid arthritis and related disorders are known in the art. For example, the Orencia® dimer is typically administered intravenously to a human suffering from rheumatoid arthritis in a dose of about 10 mg Orencia® per kilogram (kg) body weight of the human. A mutant CTLA-4-Ig dimer of the invention that is about “X” times more potent than Orencia® can be administered (e.g., intravenously, subcutaneously, or in another manner described herein) to a human suffering from rheumatoid arthritis in a dose that is about “X” times less than the Orencia® dimer dose to achieve a therapeutic effect (e.g., suppressing an immune response) that is approximately equivalent to that of the Orencia® dimer. If a greater therapeutic effect is desired, a proportionally increased amount or dose of the mutant CTLA-4-Ig dimer can be readily determined and administered to the human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn any of the methods described herein, the molecule or component of the invention (e.g., a polypeptide (including, e.g., dimeric or monomeric fusion protein or polypeptide multimer), conjugate, nucleic acid, vector, composition, and/or cell of the invention) can be administered parentally, subcutaneously, or intravenously, or as described elsewhere herein. The molecule or component of the invention may be administered in a therapeutically effective amount one, two, three or four times per month, two times per week, biweekly (every two weeks), or bimonthly (every two months). Administration may last for a period of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12 months or longer (e.g., one, two, three, four or more years, including for the life of the subject).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny of the methods described herein may further comprise administering to the subject an effective amount of at least one additional therapeutic or immunosuppressive agent or compound. Thus, for example, the invention provides a method of suppressing an immune response comprising administering to a subject in need thereof (1) an effective amount of at least one first immunosuppressive agent, wherein each such first immunosuppressive agent is a polypeptide, nucleic acid, vector, composition, and/or cell of the invention, and (2) an effective amount of at least one second immunosuppressive agent, wherein an immune response in the subject is suppressed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of additional therapeutic or immunosuppressive agents (that are not molecules of the invention) may be used or administered in conjunction with a molecule of the invention (e.g., polypeptide, nucleic acid, vector, composition, and/or cell of the invention). Such agents include, e.g., a disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) (such as, e.g., methotrexate (MTX), cytokine antagonist (e.g., IL-2 or IL-6 antagonist), steroidal compound (e.g., corticosteroid, glucocosteroid, e.g., prednisone or methylprednisone), non-steroidal compound, sodium or magnesium salicylate, ibuprofen, acetylsalicylic acid, acetaminophen, antibody, biological agent that blocks synthesis of an production anti-inflammatory cytokine, Raptiva® efalizumab, anti-inflammatory agent or compound, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Such additional therapeutic or immunosuppressive agent can be administered to the subject in a pharmaceutical composition comprising the additional agent and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier. The effective amount or dose of the agent to be administered will depend upon the specific agent. Some such agents are currently used in immunosuppressive therapies and appropriate dosages can be determined by based upon the disease, disorder or condition being treated and the subject's ability to tolerate specific amounts or doses, and the agent's immunosuppressive effectiveness. Exemplary doses for immunosuppressive agents described above which are not molecules of the invention are known. The additional immunosuppressive agent that is not a molecule of the invention can be administered simultaneously with or before or after administration of the molecule of the invention (e.g., mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA treatment regimen, including, e.g., dose, schedule of administration, method of administration (e.g., intravenous injection, subcutaneous injection, etc.) and pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one such molecule or component of the invention may vary depending upon the disease, disorder or condition to be treated. One or more such molecules or components of the invention may be administered to a subject; each such molecule or component need not be administered in the same pharmaceutical formulation, by the same administration methods, in the same amount, or by the same dosing frequency schedule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some such methods, for example, about 1 ml of a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, carrier, or diluent and a concentration of a fusion protein dimer of the invention of about 50 mg/ml is administered subcutaneously to a subject (e.g., adult human) in need of immunosuppression (e.g., a subject suffering from rheumatoid arthritis). Such initial dose is 50 mg of fusion protein dimer. For a subject having a body weight of 100 kg, this initial dose corresponds to 0.5 mg fusion protein dimer per kg body weight of the subject. A second of the same amount is administered subcutaneously at one or two weeks after the first dose. Further doses are administered subcutaneously every week, biweekly, or once per month, or more or less frequently as necessary. Such compositions and administration formats are believed useful, for example, for treating a human suffering from rheumatoid arthritis or another immune disorder in which immunosuppression is desirable or for inhibiting rejection of a tissue, cell, graft, or organ transplant from a human donor by a human recipient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods of Treating Rheumatoid Arthritis\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRheumatoid arthritis is one of the most common systemic inflammatory autoimmune diseases and is estimated to affect 1-2% of the adult population. See, e.g., Dipiro, J. T., \nRheumatoid arthritis, in \nP\nHARMACOTHERAPY\n: A \nPATHOPHYSIOLOGIC \nA\nPPROACH, \n1671-1682 (Talbert, R. T. et al. eds., McGraw-Hill, New York, 6\nth \ned. 2005). The disease is characterized by synovial membrane hyperplasia and infiltration of inflammatory cells, including activated T cells. Activated T cells play a pivotal role in the progression of rheumatoid arthritis by stimulating a variety of cell types to produce proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-alpha, autoantibodies, and matrix metalloproteinases (Hoffman, R. W., Front. Biosci. 6:1369-1378 (2001); Choy, E. K. et al., N. Engl. J. Med 344:907-916 (2001)). The strong contribution of T cells to the progression of rheumatoid arthritis makes T cell activation a rational target for therapeutic intervention. Such inflammatory molecules are believed to cause the inflammatory response, tissue damage (e.g., joint damage), and pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCo-stimulation of T cells mediated by interactions between CD28 receptor and CD80 and/or CD86 ligand(s) is essential for the activation of most T cells (Riley, J. L. et al., Blood 105:13-21 (2005)). Therapeutic or prophylactic agents that antagonize the CD80/CD86-CD28 co-stimulation pathway, such as the Orencia® (Abatacept) fusion protein, which is a soluble dimeric hCTLA-4-Ig fusion protein, have been shown to be clinically effective in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (Kremer, J. M. et al., Ann. Intern. Med. 144:865-876 (2006); Genovese, M. C. et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 353:1114-1123 (2005)). Abatacept is believed to exert immunosuppressive function by binding to CD80 and/or CD86 ligands on antigen-presenting cells when administered to a subject (e.g., adult human) in vivo in a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount, thus preventing the interaction of either or both of these ligands with the CD28 receptor on T cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAbatacept is presently approved to treat adult human patients with moderately to severely active RA who have had an inadequate response to one or more DMARDs, such as methotrexate or TNF antagonists. Abatacept is administered to an adult RA patient at a dose of 10 mg/kg body weight of the subject by intravenous infusion. Following the first dose, second and third doses of 10 mg/kg of the fusion protein are administered to the subject at two and four weeks, respectively, after the first dose. Subsequent doses are administered every four weeks (i.e., once per month). Intravenous infusion of Abatacept is believed necessary to deliver the high dose level required to obtain desirable efficacy in rheumatoid arthritis therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther current therapies for rheumatoid arthritis include the administration of non-specific immunosuppressive agents, such as methotrexate, and steroidal and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Additionally, biologic agents are approved that target specific pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α (e.g., Remicade® infliximab, Enbrel® entaercept, Humira® adalimumab) and IL-1 (e.g., Kineret® anakinra). However, many of these therapies have significant side effects—some of which are toxic—particularly when administered over a long time period.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDespite the availability of various therapies, significant unmet need exists for the treatment of RA. For example, 60% of human RA patients who have failed previous DMARD treatment and 80% of human RA patients who have failed previous anti-TNF therapy did not achieve an ACR50 scores after treatment with Orencia for 6 months (Kremer J. M. et al., Ann. Intern. Med. 144:865-876 (2006); Genovese, M. C. et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 353:1114-11 (2005)). Dose response studies using Abatacept and Belatacept (LEA29Y-Ig) fusion protein in the treatment of RA in adults indicated that efficacy was dose-dependent and was not saturated at the highest dose levels tested (Kremer, J. M. et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 349:1907-1915 (2003); Moreland, L. W. et al., Arthrit. Rheum. 46:1470-1479 (2002)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA soluble dimeric mutant CTLA-4-Ig of the invention having a higher binding avidity to hCD80 and/or hCD86 than Abatacept is expected to be able to exert more potent immunosuppressive effects than Abatacept when administered to a subject with RA. Such a mutant CTLA-4-Ig binds a similar number of CD80 and/or CD86 ligands at a lower concentration than Abatacept.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA mutant CTLA-4-Ig with a higher binding avidity to CD80 or CD86 and slower dissociation rate from CD80 or CD86, respectively, has a longer residence time on such ligand. This longer residence time is expected to be associated with higher efficacy in vivo. It is believed that such a mutant CTLA-4-Ig may be effective in therapeutically or prophylactically treating a subject with RA at a dose that is lower than the Abatacept. That is, it is believed that such a mutant CTLA-4-Ig may achieve a degree of efficacy equivalent to that of Abatacept when administered to the RA subject at a dose that is less than that of the Abatacept dose of 10 mg/kg body weight of the subject. The invention provides soluble dimeric mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins of varied binding avidities to hCD80 and/or hCD86. Soluble dimeric mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins that have substantially higher binding avidities to hCD86 than Abatacept may a degree of efficacy equivalent to that of Abatacept when administered to the RA subject at a dose that is substantially less than that of Abatacept. Administration of a lower dose of such a mutant CTLA-4-Ig may allow a more convenient method of administration (e.g., subcutaneous injection) to be used than is currently used for administration of Abatacept (intravenous injection).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also believed that a soluble mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein of the invention with a higher immunosuppressive potency than Abatacept or Belatacept fusion protein would enable a higher level of efficacy to be obtained in the treatment of RA patients. A more immunosuppressive mutant CTLA-4-Ig is expected to be able to alleviate symptoms associated with RA and inhibit progressive of the deleterious physical effects of RA more effectively than Abatacept. Such a mutant CTLA-4-Ig can be formulated in a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, excipient, or carrier (e.g., PBS) at a concentration ranging from of 0.1-200 mg/ml. Treatment of a subject with RA can be accomplished by administering to the subject a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount (dose) of the mutant CTLA-4-Ig by subcutaneous injection or intravenous infusion at an appropriately determined dosing frequency (e.g., initial dose following by one \ndose\n 2 to 4 times per month, one dose per month, or one dose every two months). The dose would depend upon the severity of the subject's disease or symptoms. For example, an amount or dose of a mutant CTLA-4-Ig of no more than about 10 mg/kg (including e.g., about 1 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, 0.25 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, 4 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, 6 mg/kg, 7 mg/kg, 8 mg/kg, or 9 mg/kg) body weight of the subject may be administered. A more immunosuppressive mutant CTLA-4-Ig may allow for a less frequent dosing schedule (e.g., once very two months) than the dosing schedule typically used with Abatacept. Alternatively, an amount or dose of a mutant CTLA-4-Ig greater than about 10 mg/kg weight of the subject (e.g., from about 10 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg, from about 10 mg/kg to about 25 mg/kg, about 10 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg, about 10 mg/kg to about 75 mg/kg, etc., including, e.g., about 15 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg, 60 g/kg, 70 mg/kg, 75 mg/kg, 80 mg/kg, 90 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg) may be administered to a subject with RA if the subject's disease condition and/or symptoms warrants such amount or dose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effective amount or dose of a mutant CTLA-4-Ig dimer of the invention for treating RA in a human suffering therefrom can be determined based on various factors, such as the potency of the mutant CTLA-4-Ig dimer, the mode of administration of the dimer, and/or the severity of the subject's symptoms or signs of rheumatoid arthritis. For example, an effective amount or dose of a mutant CTLA-4-Ig dimer of the invention can be ascertained by comparing the potency of such dimer to that of the Orencia® dimer and determining the amount or dose of the mutant CTLA-4-Ig dimer that would yield the desired immunosuppressive effect compared to Orencia® (e.g., an improved or approximately equivalent effect) based on amount or dose of Orencia® that would typically be administered to a human subject exhibiting similar symptoms or signs of RA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, for example, the invention provides a method of treating rheumatoid arthritis in a subject in need of such treatment, the method comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of a soluble dimeric mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein of the invention by, e.g., intravenous or subcutaneous injection. The effective amount or dose may comprise from about 0.001 milligrams (mg) to about 10 milligrams per kilogram (kg) body weight of the subject, including, but not limited to, e.g., from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg weight of the subject, from about 0.05 mg/kg, 0.1 mg/kg, 0.2 mg/kg, 0.25 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, 6 mg/kg, 7 mg/kg, 8 mg/kg, 9 mg/kg, or 10 mg/kg body weight of the adult human patient is administered to the subject. In some instances, the effective amount or dose is from about 2 to 10 mg/kg, about 3 to 10 mg/kg, about 3 to 5 mg/kg, about 5 to 10 mg/kg, 0.1 to 5 mg/kg weight, about 0.05 to 1.0 mg/kg, about 0.05 to 3 mg/kg weight, about 0.05 to 2.0 mg/kg, about 0.05 to 1.0 mg/kg, about 0.05 to 2.0 mg/kg, about 0.1 to 2.0 mg/kg, about 0.1 to 3.0 mg/kg, about 0.1 to 0.5 mg/kg, about 0.1 to 0.8 mg/kg, about 0.1 to 0.6 mg/kg, about 0.2 to 1 mg/kg, about 0.2 to 0.6 mg/kg, about 0.2 to 0.5 mg/kg about 0.3 to 1 mg/kg, about 0.3 to 0.6 mg/kg, about 0.3 to 0.5 mg/kg weight of a subject. In some instances, the effective amount or dose is less than about 500 mg for a subject weighing less than 60 kg (e.g., less than about 100 mg, 75 mg, 50 mg, 25 mg, or 12.5 mg), less than about 750 mg for a subject weighing between 60-100 kg (e.g., less than about 150 mg, 100 mg, 75 mg, 37.5 mg, or 20 mg), or less than about 1000 mg for a subject weighing more than 100 kg (e.g., less than about 500 mg, 100 mg, 50 mg, 25 mg, or 10 mg). Following the first dose, subsequent equivalent doses are administered at intervals of 1, 2, 4, 8, 10, 12, 14, or 16 weeks. Subsequent dosing frequency can be determined as needed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch a mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion may be formulated with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, carrier, or diluent to produce a pharmaceutical composition suitable for administration to a subject (e.g., mammal, including a human). The concentration of the fusion protein in the composition may range from about 0.01 mg/ml to about 300 mg/ml or from about 0.01 mg/ml to about 200 mg/ml, including, but not limited to, e.g., from about 0.1 mg/ml to about 300 mg/ml, from about 0.1 mg/ml to about 200 mg/ml, about 0.1 mg/ml to about 100 mg/ml, about 0.5 mg/ml to about 100 mg/ml, about 0.5 mg/ml to about 50 mg/ml, about 1 to about 100 mg/ml, about 1 to about 75 mg/ml, about 5 to about 75 mg/ml, about 10 to about 75 mg/ml, about 10 to about 60 mg/ml, about 25 to about 60 mg/ml, about 30 to about 60 mg/ml, about 25 to about 50 mg/ml, about 40 to about 50 mg/ml, about 25 mg/ml, or about 50 mg/ml. Other compositions, including those discussed above and below, are also contemplated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch treatment is expected to reduce one or more signs and/or symptoms associated with rheumatoid arthritis, such as, e.g., inflammation, joint tenderness, joint swelling, pain, and stiffness, in the subject. Such treatment may reduce the further progression of the disease in the patient. For example, such treatment may reduce the progression of structural damage in the patient. Such treatment may improve physical functioning of the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods of Inhibiting Tissue, Cell, Graft, or Organ Transplantation Rejection\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides a method of inhibiting rejection of, or suppressing an immune response associated with, a tissue, cell, skin graft, or organ transplant from a donor by a recipient subject, the method comprising administering to the recipient subject a therapeutically effective amount of one or more of the following: (1) a polypeptide of the invention (e.g., mutant CTLA-4-ECD polypeptide or dimeric or monomeric mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein); (2) a multimer comprising one of more polypeptides of the invention (e.g., a dimer comprising any two such polypeptides or a tetramer comprising any four such polypeptides); (3) a conjugate comprising at least one polypeptide of the invention; (4) a nucleic acid of the invention (e.g., a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide of the invention); (5) a vector comprising a nucleic acid of the invention or encoding a polypeptide of the invention; (6) a cell or population of cells comprising a polypeptide, nucleic acid, conjugate, and/or vector of the invention; and/or (7) a composition of the invention, thereby inhibiting rejection of the tissue, cell, skin graft, or organ transplant by the recipient subject. The donor and recipient may be the same species or different species. The donor or recipient may be a mammal, such as a human, non-human primate (e.g., monkey, gorilla), sheep, cat, dog, pig, cow, horse, etc. In some such methods, the polypeptide, conjugate, vector, and/or cell of the invention is administered to the recipient subject prior to, simultaneously with, or after tissue, cell, skin graft, or organ transplantation. The effective amount typically comprises from about 0.001 mg/kg weight of the subject to about 200 mg/kg body weight of the subject. In some such methods, for example, the effective amount comprises from about 0.001 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) weight of the subject to at least about 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 225, 250, or 300 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) body weight of the subject. In some such methods, the effective amount comprises from about 0.001 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) weight of the subject to at least about 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 25, 50, or 75 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) body weight of the subject. The polypeptide, conjugate, nucleic acid, vector, and/or cell of the invention may be administered to the recipient subject during, prior to, or immediately after the transplantation. Alternatively or additionally, such molecule of the invention may be administered one or more hours after transplantation, on the day following transplantation, and/or daily thereafter, or at least once per week, at least once every two weeks, or at least one per month after transplantation, as necessary, for up to 12, 24, or 36 or more months or longer as needed. The organ transplant may involve any organ, such as, e.g., a kidney, liver, heart, or lung.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effective amount or dose of a mutant CTLA-4 molecule of the invention (e.g., mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein dimer) to be administered to an organ, tissue, or cell transplant recipient subject so as to inhibit transplant rejection (or suppress an immune response associated with such transplant) is typically determined based on the potency of such molecule, mode of administration, the type of transplantation (e.g., cell, tissue, organ), the subject's history, and/or the severity of the transplant recipient subject's symptoms or signs of an immune response(s) suggestive of transplant rejection. For example, an effective amount or dose of a mutant CTLA-4-Ig dimer of the invention (e.g., D3-29-IGg2, D3-54-IgG2, D3-56-IgG2, D3-69-IgG2, D3-75-IgG2 dimer, etc.) can be determined by comparing the potency of such dimer with that of the Belatacept dimer. Effective doses of Belatacept useful for preventing or suppressing an immune response associated with kidney/renal transplantation are known. For example, Belatacept is administered by intravenous infusion to a human following kidney transplantation in the human from a kidney donor in an amount or dose of about 5 mg or 10 mg per kilogram body weight of the human per month. A mutant CTLA-4-Ig dimer of the invention that is about “X” times more potent than Belatacept can be administered (e.g., intravenously, subcutaneously, or in another manner described herein) to a human who has had kidney transplant in an amount or dose that is about “X” times less than the Belatacept dose to achieve a therapeutic effect (e.g., suppressing an immune response) approximately equivalent to that of Belatacept. If a greater therapeutic effect is desired, a proportionally increased amount or dose of the CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein dimer of the invention can be determined and administered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides a method of treating tissue, cell, or organ transplant rejection (e.g., solid organ transplant rejection (e.g., kidney, liver, lung, heart, etc.)) in a subject who receives such tissue, cell, or organ from a donor, the method comprising administering to the recipient a therapeutically effective amount of at least one polypeptide, conjugate, nucleic acid, vector, and/or cell of the invention, thereby inhibiting rejection of the donor tissue, cell, or organ transplant by the recipient subject. The polypeptide, conjugate, nucleic acid, vector, and/or cell of the invention can be administered to the subject prior to, simultaneously with, or after cell, tissue or organ transplantation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention provides a method of inhibiting rejection of islet cell transplantation from a donor in a recipient subject in need thereof, the method comprising administering to the subject an effective amount or dose of a mutant CTLA-4 molecule of the invention (e.g., mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein) prior to, simultaneously with, or after transplantation of islet cell(s) from the pancreas of a donor into the subject. The subject (e.g., human) typically suffers from diabetes (e.g., IDDM) and such method is useful in treating a subject diagnosed with or suffering from diabetes. Islet transplantation procedures are known in the art. Typically, islets are removed from the pancreas of a deceased organ donor, purified and processed, and implanted into a recipient subject suffering from diabetes. After transplantation, the beta cells in the islets begin to make and release insulin, thereby reducing the recipient subject's need for insulin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn such methods of inhibiting transplant rejection, the mutant CTLA-4 molecule of the invention (e.g., mutant CTLA-4-Ig) can be formulated with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, carrier, or diluent to produce a pharmaceutical composition suitable for administration to a subject (e.g., mammal, including a human). Some such methods comprise administration of a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, carrier, or diluent and a mutant CTLA-4-Ig dimer of the invention having a concentration of from about 0.01 mg/ml to about 300 mg/ml or about 0.01 mg/ml to about 200 mg/ml, including, but not limited to, e.g., from about 0.1 mg/ml to about 300 mg/ml, from about 0.1 mg/ml to about 200 mg/ml, about 0.1 mg/ml to about 100 mg/ml, about 0.5 mg/ml to about 100 mg/ml, about 0.5 mg/ml to about 50 mg/ml, about 1 to about 100 mg/ml, about 1 to about 75 mg/ml, about 5 to about 75 mg/ml, about 10 to about 75 mg/ml, about 10 to about 60 mg/ml, about 25 to about 60 mg/ml, about 30 to about 60 mg/ml, about 25 to about 50 mg/ml, about 40 to about 50 mg/ml, about 25 mg/ml, or about 50 mg/ml. Other compositions, including those discussed above and below, are also contemplated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods of Inhibiting an Immune Response\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention includes the use of a polypeptide (including, e.g., a dimeric or monomeric fusion protein or multimeric polypeptide), conjugate, nucleic acid, vector, or cell of the invention for the manufacture of a medicament for inhibiting or suppressing an immune response in a mammal (e.g., human or non-human primate). Immune responses that may be suppressed include, e.g., T cell activation or proliferation, cytokine synthesis or production, induction of activation markers, synthesis or production of inflammatory molecules, inflammation, anti-collagen Ab production, T cell-dependent Ab response.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also includes the use of a polypeptide (including, e.g., a dimeric or monomeric fusion protein or multimeric polypeptide), conjugate, nucleic acid, vector, or cell of the invention for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of an immune system disease or disorder. The immune system disease or disorder may be one that is mediated by interaction of T cells with CD80-positive cells and/or CD86-positive cells in a mammal. The immune system disease or disorder may be an immune system disease or disease, such as a rheumatic disease or disorder or an autoimmune disease or autoimmune disorder. Such immune system disease or disorder may be or involve, e.g., but is not limited to, Addison's Disease, Allergy, Alopecia Areata, Alzheimer's, Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA)-associated vasculitis, Ankylosing Spondylitis, Antiphospholipid Syndrome (Hughes Syndrome), arthritis, Asthma, Atherosclerosis, Atherosclerotic plaque, autoimmune disease (e.g., lupus, RA, MS, Graves' disease, etc.), Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia, Autoimmune Hepatitis, Autoimmune inner ear disease, Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative syndrome, Autoimmune Myocarditis, Autoimmune Oophoritis, Autoimmune Orchitis, Azoospermia, Behcet's Disease, Behcet's syndrome, Berger's Disease, Bullous Pemphigoid, Cardiomyopathy, Cardiovascular disease, Celiac Sprue/Coeliac disease, Chronic Fatigue Immune Dysfunction Syndrome (CFIDS), Chronic idiopathic polyneuritis, Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating, Polyradicalneuropathy (CIPD), Chronic relapsing polyneuropathy (Guillain-Barré syndrome), Churg-Strauss Syndrome (CSS), Cicatricial Pemphigoid, Cold Agglutinin Disease (CAD), COPD, CREST syndrome, Crohn's Disease, Dermatitis, Herpetiformus, Dermatomyositis, diabetes, Discoid Lupus, Eczema, Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, Essential Mixed Cryoglobulinemia, Evan's Syndrome, Exopthalmos, Fibromyalgia, Goodpasture's Syndrome, graft-related disease or disorder, Graves' Disease, GVHD, Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis, Idiopathic Thrombocytopenia Purpura (ITP), IgA Nephropathy, immunoproliferative disease or disorder (e.g., psoriasis), Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (IDDM), Interstitial lung disease, juvenile diabetes, Juvenile Arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), Kawasaki's Disease, Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome, Lichen Planus, lupus, Lupus Nephritis, Lymphoscytic Lypophisitis, Ménière's Disease, Miller Fish Syndrome/acute disseminated encephalomyeloradiculopathy, Mixed Connective Tissue Disease, Multiple Sclerosis (MS), muscular rheumatism, Myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), Myasthenia Gravis, Ocular Inflammation, Pemphigus Foliaceus, Pemphigus Vulgaris, Pernicious Anaemia, Polyarteritis Nodosa, Polychondritis, Polyglandular Syndromes (Whitaker's syndrome), Polymyalgia Rheumatica, Polymyositis, Primary Agammaglobulinemia, Primary Biliary Cirrhosis/Autoimmune cholangiopathy, Psoriasis, Psoriatic arthritis, Raynaud's Phenomenon, Reiter's Syndrome/Reactive arthritis, Restenosis, Rheumatic Fever, rheumatic disease, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Sarcoidosis, Schmidt's syndrome, Scleroderma, Sjörgen's Syndrome, Solid-organ transplant rejection (kidney, heart, liver, lung, etc.), Stiff-Man Syndrome, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), systemic scleroderma, Takayasu Arteritis, Temporal Arteritis/Giant Cell Arteritis, Thyroiditis, Type 1 diabetes, Type 2 diabetes, Ulcerative colitis, Uveitis, Vasculitis, Vitiligo, Wegener's Granulomatosis, and preventing or suppressing an immune response associated with rejection of a donor tissue, cell, graft, or organ transplant by a recipient subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides for the use of a polypeptide, conjugate, nucleic acid, vector, or cell of the invention for the manufacture of a medicament for inhibiting interaction of CD80-positive cells and/or CD86-positive cells with CD28-positive and/or CTLA-4-positive T cells.

Proliferation of purified T cells can be measured in a mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) assay; such assays are well-known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nELISpot assays measure the number of T-cells secreting a specific cytokine, such as IFN-γ or TNF-α, which serves as a marker of T-cell effectors. Cytokine-specific ELISA kits are commercially available (e.g., an IFN-γ-specific ELISPot is available through R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional methods for assessing and measuring the ability of molecules of the invention (e.g., polypeptides of the invention, including, e.g., soluble mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins of the invention) to suppress or inhibit T cell activation and/or T cell proliferation are described in Examples 5-8 in the Examples section below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods of Administration\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn any of the methods described herein, an injectable pharmaceutical composition comprising a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier (e.g., PBS) and an effective amount of a molecule of the invention, such as a polypeptide (e.g., mutant CTLA-4 ECD or monomeric, dimeric, or multimeric mutant CTLA-4-Ig) or conjugate of the invention, can be administered parenterally, intramuscularly, intraperitoneally, intravenously, subdermally, transdermally, subcutaneously, or intradermally to a host. Alternatively, biolistic protein delivery techniques (vaccine gun delivery) can be used (examples of which are discussed elsewhere herein). Any other suitable technique also can be used. Polypeptide administration can be facilitated via liposomes. Any such delivery technique can be used to deliver a polypeptide or conjugate of the invention in conjunction with any therapeutic or prophylactic method described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile the following discussion is primarily directed to nucleic acids, it will be understood that it applies equally to nucleic acid vectors of the invention. A nucleic acid of the invention or composition thereof can be administered to a host by any suitable administration route. In some aspects of the invention, administration of the nucleic acid is parenteral (e.g., subcutaneous (s.c.), intramuscular (i.m.), or intradermal (i.d.)), topical, or transdermal. The nucleic acid can be introduced directly into a tissue, such as muscle, by injection using a needle or other similar device. See, e.g., Nabel et al. (1990), supra; Wolff et al.

Nos. 5,580,859 and 5,589,466. Other methods such as “biolistic” or particle-mediated transformation (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,945,050 and 5,036,006, Sanford et al., J. Particulate Sci. Tech. 5:27-37 (1987), Yang et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87:9568-72 (1990), and Williams et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:2726-30 (1991)). These methods are useful not only for in vivo introduction of DNA into a subject, such as a mammal, but also for ex vivo modification of cells for reintroduction into a mammal (which is discussed further elsewhere herein).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor standard gene gun administration, the vector or nucleic acid of interest is precipitated onto the surface of microscopic metal beads. The microprojectiles are accelerated with a shock wave or expanding helium gas, and penetrate tissues to a depth of several cell layers. For example, the Accel™ Gene Delivery Device manufactured by Agacetus, Inc. Middleton Wis. is suitable for use in this embodiment. The nucleic acid or vector can be administered by such techniques, e.g., intramuscularly, intradermally, subdermally, subcutaneously, and/or intraperitoneally.

Nos. 5,525,510, 5,630,796, 5,865,796, and 6,010,478.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nucleic acid can be administered in association with a transfection-facilitating agent, examples of which were discussed above. The nucleic acid can be administered topically and/or by liquid particle delivery (in contrast to solid particle biolistic delivery). Examples of such nucleic acid delivery techniques, compositions, and additional constructs that can be suitable as delivery vehicles for the nucleic acids of the invention are provided in, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,591,601, 5,593,972, 5,679,647, 5,697,901, 5,698,436, 5,739,118, 5,770,580, 5,792,751, 5,804,566, 5,811,406, 5,817,637, 5,830,876, 5,830,877, 5,846,949, 5,849,719, 5,880,103, 5,922,687, 5,981,505, 6,087,341, 6,107,095, 6,110,898, and Int'l Pat. Appn. Publ. Nos. WO 98/06863, WO 98/55495, and WO 99/57275.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the nucleic acid can be administered to the host by way of liposome-based gene delivery. Exemplary techniques and principles related to liposome-based gene delivery is provided in, e.g., Debs and Zhu (1993) WO 93/24640; Mannino and Gould-Fogerite (1988) BioTechniques 6(7):682-691; Rose U.S. Pat. No. 5,279,833; Brigham (1991) WO 91/06309; Brigham et al. (1989) Am. J. Med. Sci. 298:278-281; Nabel et al. (1990) Science 249:1285-1288; Hazinski et al. (1991) Am. J. Resp. Cell Molec. Biol. 4:206-209; and Wang and Huang (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84:7851-7855), and Felgner et al. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84:7413-7414). Suitable liposome pharmaceutically acceptable compositions that can be used to deliver the nucleic acid are further described elsewhere herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny amount of nucleic acid of the invention can be used in the methods of the invention. For example, sufficient nucleic acid may be formulated in a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier and administered to a subject such that the encoded polypeptide or conjugate is produced in the subject in an amount believed effective to, for example, suppress immune response in the subject, inhibit interaction between endogenous B7-positive cells and CD28-positive cells in the subject, or inhibit rejection of a tissue, cell, organ, or graft transplant. In one format, where the nucleic acid is administered by injection, about 50 micrograms (μg) to 100 mg nucleic acid is administered. In one exemplary application, to suppress an immune response, a pharmaceutical composition comprising PBS and an amount of a DNA vector that encodes an effective amount of a mutant CTLA-4 polypeptide is administered by injection or electroporation or other suitable delivery method (e.g., gene gun, impressing through the skin, and lipofection) to a subject in need of treatment (e.g., a subject suffering from an immune system disease or disorder in which immunosuppressive treatment is desirable). An exemplary vector is shown in \nFIG. 1\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of DNA plasmid for use in the methods of the invention where administration is via a gene gun, e.g., is often from about 100 to about 1000 times less than the amount used for direct injection (e.g., via standard needle injection). Despite such sensitivity, at least about 1 μg of the nucleic acid may be used in such biolistic delivery techniques.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRNA or DNA viral vector systems can be useful for delivery nucleic acids encoding polypeptides of the invention. Viral vectors can be administered directly to a subject in vivo or they can be used to treat cells in vitro and the modified cells are administered to the subject in an ex vivo format. Useful viral vectors include those discussed above, such as adeno-associated, adenoviral, retroviral, lentivirus, and herpes simplex virus vectors. With such viral vectors, a nucleic acid of the invention can be readily transferred into target cells and tissues of the subject. Additionally, with the retrovirus, lentivirus, and adeno-associated virus gene transfer methods, a nucleic acid of the invention can be integrated into the host genome may be possible, thereby resulting in continuing expression of the inserted nucleic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDelivery of a viral vector of the invention comprising at least one nucleic acid of the invention to a subject is believed capable of suppressing an immune response in the subject to whom the vector is administered. Optionally, some prophylactic and/or therapeutic methods of the invention are practiced with a dosage of a suitable viral vector sufficient to inhibit a detectable immune response. Any suitable viral vector comprising a nucleic acid of the invention, in any suitable concentration, can be used to suppress the immune response. For example, to the subject host can be administered a population of retroviral vectors (examples of which are described in, e.g., Buchscher et al. (1992) J. Virol. 66(5) 2731-2739, Johann et al. (1992) J. Virol. 66 (5):1635-1640 (1992), Sommerfelt et al., (1990) Virol. 176:58-59, Wilson et al. (1989) J. Virol. 63:2374-2378, Miller et al., J.

No. WO 93/24641), or an adenoviral vector (as described in, e.g., Berns et al. (1995) Ann. NY Acad. Sci. 772:95-104; Ali et al. (1994) Gene Ther. 1:367-384; and Haddada et al. (1995) Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 199 (Pt 3):297-306), such that immunosuppressive levels of expression of the nucleic acid included in the vector result, thereby resulting in the desired immunosuppressive response. Other suitable types of viral vectors are described elsewhere herein (including alternative examples of suitable retroviral, AAV, and adenoviral vectors).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable infection conditions for these and other types of viral vector particles are described in, e.g., Bachrach et al., J. Virol., 74(18), 8480-6 (2000), Mackay et al., J. Virol., 19(2), 620-36 (1976), and F\nIELDS \nV\nIROLOGY\n, supra. Additional techniques useful in the production and application of viral vectors are provided in, e.g., “Practical Molecular Virology: Viral Vectors for Gene Expression” in M\nETHODS IN \nM\nOLECULAR \nB\nIOLOGY\n, vol. 8, Collins, M.

(Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1988).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of vectors or viruses that include one or more molecules of the invention are determined using standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals. One can determine the MLD\n50 \n(the minimum dose lethal to 50% of the population) and/or the ED\n50 \n(the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population) using procedures presented herein and those otherwise known in the art. See also S. Plotkin and W. Orenstein, V\nACCINES \n(W. B. Saunders Co. 1999 3d ed.) for suggested doses for known viral vaccines. Nucleic acids, polypeptides, proteins, fusion proteins, transduced cells and other formulations of the present invention can be administered in an amount determined, e.g., by the MLD\n50 \nof the formulation, and the side-effects thereof at various concentrations, as applied to the mass and overall health of the patient. Thus, for example, the invention provides a method of inducing an immune response by administering a dose equal or greater to the ED\n50 \nof a pharmaceutically acceptable composition comprising a population of virus-like particles or viruses (e.g., attenuated or replication-deficient virus) that comprises a polypeptide or nucleic acid of the invention. Administration can be accomplished via single dose or divided doses (either by co-administration, serial administration, or combinations thereof). Administration techniques and protocols are described in, e.g., Plotkin (V\nACCINES\n) supra and other references cited herein. In a related sense, techniques for assessing dosage of the nucleic acid, polypeptide, vector, and cell compositions effective for inducing immunity are described in, e.g., European Patent Appn No. 1 156 333 and references cited therein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe viral vector can be targeted to particular tissues, cells, and/or organs of a subject, e.g., mammal. Examples of such vectors are described above. For example, the viral vector or nucleic acid vector can be used to selectively deliver the nucleic acid sequence of the invention to monocytes, dendritic cells, cells associated with dendritic cells (e.g., keratinocytes associated with Langerhans cells), T-cells, and/or B-cells. The viral vector can be a replication-deficient viral vector. The viral vector particle also can be modified to reduce host immune response to the viral vector, thereby achieving persistent gene expression. Such “stealth” vectors are described in, e.g., Martin, Exp. Mol. Pathol. 66(1):3-7 (1999), Croyle et al., J. Virol. 75(10):4792-801 (2001), Rollins et al., Hum. Gene Ther. 7(5):619-26 (1996), Ikeda et al., J. Virol. 74(10):4765-75 (2000), Halbert et al., J. Virol. 74(3):1524-32 (2000), and Int'l Patent Appn Publ. No. WO 98/40509. Alternatively or additionally, the viral vector particles can be administered by a strategy selected to reduce host immune response to the vector particles. Strategies for reducing immune response to the viral vector particle upon administration to a host are provided in, e.g., Maione et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 98(11):5986-91 (2001), Morral et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 96(22):2816-21 (1999), Pastore et al., Hum. Gene Ther. 10(11):1773-81 (1999), Morsy et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

No. 2001-0066947A1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe skin and muscle are generally preferred targets for administration of the polypeptides, conjugates, nucleic acids, and vectors of the invention, by any suitable technique. Thus, the delivery of a polypeptide, conjugate, nucleic acid, or vector of the invention into or through the skin of a subject (e.g., mammal), is a feature of the invention. Such molecules of the invention can be administered in a pharmaceutically acceptable injectable solution into or through the skin, e.g., intramuscularly, or intraperitoneally. Administration can also be accomplished by transdermal devices, or, more typically, biolistic delivery of the polypeptide, conjugate, nucleic acid, and/or vector to, into, or through the skin of the subject or into exposed muscle of the subject. Transdermal devices provided by the invention, described elsewhere herein, for example, can be applied to the skin of a host for a suitable period such that sufficient transfer of a polynucleotide and/or vector to the subject occurs, thereby suppressing an immune response in the subject or inhibiting rejection of a graft, cell, or tissue transplant. Muscular administration is more typically facilitated by injection of a liquid solution comprising a polypeptide, polynucleotide, or vector of the invention. Particular cells that can be targeted include dendritic cells, other APCs, B cells, monocytes, T cells (including T helper cells), and cells associated with such immune system cells (e.g., keratinocytes or other skin cells associated with Langerhans cells). Targeting of vectors and nucleic acids of the invention is described elsewhere herein. Such targeted administration can be performed with nucleic acids or vectors comprising nucleic acids operably linked to cell and/or tissue-specific promoters, examples of which are known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe polynucleotide of the invention can be administered by any suitable delivery system, such that expression of a recombinant polypeptide occurs in the host resulting in an suppression of an immune response, inhibition of interaction between B7-positive cells and CD28-positive, or inhibition of tissue, cell, organ, or graft transplant rejection. For example, an effective amount of a population of bacterial cells comprising a nucleic acid of the invention can be administered to a subject, resulting in expression of a recombinant mutant CTLA-4 polypeptide of the invention, and suppression of an immune response in the subject. Bacterial cells developed for mammalian gene delivery are known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdministration of a polynucleotide or vector of the invention to a subject is facilitated by application of electroporation to an effective number of cells or an effective tissue target, such that the nucleic acid and/or vector is taken up by the cells, and expressed therein, resulting in production of a recombinant polypeptide of the invention therein and subsequent suppression of an immune response in the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProduction and Purification Methods\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention further provides methods of making and purifying the polypeptides, nucleic acids, vectors, and cells of the invention. In one aspect, the invention provides a method of making a recombinant polypeptide of the invention by introducing a nucleic acid of the invention into a population of cells in a culture medium, culturing the cells in the medium (for a time and under conditions suitable for desired level of gene expression) to produce the polypeptide, and isolating the polypeptide from the cells, culture medium, or both. The nucleic acid is typically operatively linked to a regulatory sequence effective to express the polypeptide encoded by the nucleic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe polypeptide can be isolated from cell lysates, cell supernatants, and/or cell culture medium a variety of suitable techniques known in the art, including, e.g., various chromatography of cell lysates and/or cell supernatants. For example, the polypeptide can be isolated from cell lysates and/or cell culture medium by first concentrating the culture medium using centrifugal filters (Amicon), alternatively, by precipitating the polypeptides with ammonium sulfate or polyethylene glycol and then resuspending the polypeptides in PBS or other suitable buffers. The polypeptide can then be purified using either size-exclusion chromatography on Sephacryl S-400 column (Amersham Biosciences) as described in, e.g., Hjorth, R. and J. Moreno-Lopez, J. Virol. Methods 5:151-158 (1982), or another affinity chromatography, or by centrifugation through 20-60% sucrose gradients as described in, e.g., Konish et al., Virology 188:714-720 (1992). Fractions containing the desired polypeptides can be identified by ELISA or SDS-PAGE followed by protein silver stain and immunoblotting. The desired fractions are pooled and further concentrated. Sucrose in gradient centrifugation fractions can be removed using PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences) gel filtration. Additional purification techniques include those described in the Examples below and hydrophobic interaction chromatography (Diogo, M. M, et al., J. Gene Med. 3:577-584 (2001)), and any other suitable technique known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny suitable purification technique that is known in the art can also be used. Polypeptide purification methods known in the art include those set forth in, e.g., Sandana (1997) B\nIOSEPARATION OF \nP\nROTEINS\n, Academic Press, Inc., Bollag et al.

Cells suitable for polypeptide production are known in the art and are discussed elsewhere herein (e.g., Vero cells, 293 cells, BHK, CHO (e.g., CHO-K1), and COS cells can be suitable). Cells can be lysed by any suitable technique including, e.g., sonication, microfluidization, physical shear, French press lysis, or detergent-based lysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention provides a method of purifying a polypeptide of the invention, which comprises transforming a suitable host cell with a nucleic acid of the invention (e.g., a recombinant nucleic acid that encodes a recombinant polypeptide comprising the polypeptide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1) in the host cell (e.g., a CHO cell or 293 cell), lysing the cell by a suitable lysis technique (e.g., sonication, detergent lysis, or other appropriate technique), and subjecting the lysate to affinity purification with a chromatography column comprising a resin that includes at least one novel antibody of the invention (usually a monoclonal antibody of the invention) or antigen-binding fragment thereof, such that the lysate is enriched for the desired polypeptide (e.g., a polypeptide comprising the polypeptide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides a method of purifying such target polypeptides, which method differs from the above-described method in that a nucleic acid comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a fusion protein that comprises a polypeptide of the invention (e.g., SEQ ID NO:1) and a suitable tag (e.g., an e-epitope/his tag), and purifying the polypeptide by immunoaffinity, lentil-lectin affinity column chromatography, immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC), or metal-chelating affinity chromatography (MCAC) enrichment techniques. Additional purification methods are disclosed elsewhere herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides a method of producing a polypeptide of the invention, which method comprises introducing into a population of cells a recombinant expression vector comprising a nucleic acid of the invention, culturing the cells in a culture medium under appropriately sufficient conditions for expression of the nucleic acid from the vector and production of the polypeptide encoded by the nucleic acid, and isolating the polypeptide from the cells, culture medium, or both. The cells chosen are based on the desired processing of the polypeptide and based on the appropriate vector (e.g., \nE. coli \ncells are preferred for bacterial plasmids, whereas 293 cells are preferred for mammalian shuttle plasmids and/or adenoviruses, particularly E1-deficient adenoviruses).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another aspect, the invention includes a method of producing a polypeptide, the method comprising: (a) introducing into a population of cells a recombinant expression vector comprising at least one nucleic acid of the invention the encodes a polypeptide of the invention; (b) administering the expression vector into a mammal; and (c) isolating the polypeptide from the mammal or from a byproduct of the mammal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA polypeptide of the invention can also be produced by culturing a cell or population of cells of the invention (which, e.g., have been transformed with a nucleic acid of the invention that encodes such polypeptide) under conditions sufficient for expression of the polypeptide and recovering the polypeptide expressed in or by the cell using standard techniques known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides a method of producing a polypeptide of the invention, which comprises (a) introducing into a population of cells a nucleic acid of the invention, wherein the nucleic acid is operatively linked to a regulatory sequence effective to produce the polypeptide encoded by the nucleic acid; (b) culturing the cells in a culture medium to produce the polypeptide; and (c) isolating the polypeptide from the cells or culture medium. Also included is a cultured cell into which has been introduced a vector of the invention (e.g., an expression vector of the invention).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso included is a method of producing a polypeptide of the invention which comprises introducing a nucleic acid encoding said polypeptide into a population of cells in a medium, which cells are permissive for expression of the nucleic acid, maintaining the cells under conditions in which the nucleic acid is expressed, and thereafter isolating the polypeptide from the medium.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides a method of making a fusion protein. The method comprises: (1) culturing a host cell transformed with a nucleic acid in a culture medium, wherein the nucleic acid comprises: (i) a first nucleotide sequence that encodes a polypeptide having at least 95% identity to a polypeptide sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS:1-73, which polypeptide binds CD86 and/or CD80, and/or an extracellular domain of either CD86 or CD80, and (ii) a second nucleotide sequence encoding an Ig Fc polypeptide comprising a hinge region, CH2 domain, and CH3 domain, whereby the nucleic acid is expressed and a fusion protein is produced; and (2) recovering the fusion protein. Any Ig Fc polypeptide may be any employed, including e.g., an IgG1 Fc, IgG2 Fc, IgG4 Fc, or mutant Ig Fc polypeptide. In some such methods, the nucleic acid further comprises a third nucleotide sequence that encodes a secretory or signal peptide operably linked to the fusion protein, and the fusion protein is secreted from the host cell as a disulfide-bonded fusion protein dimer comprising identical first and second fusion proteins, and the disulfide-bonded fusion protein dimer is recovered from the culture medium. In some such methods, the disulfide-bonded fusion protein dimer is formed via a covalent disulfide bond between a cysteine residue of the first fusion protein and a cysteine residue of the second fusion protein. In some such methods, the fusion protein is recovered from the culture medium, host cell, or host cell periplasm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides an isolated or recombinant nucleic acid molecule comprising a nucleotide sequence which encodes (i) a first polypeptide comprising a polypeptide sequence having at least 95% sequence identity to at least one polypeptide sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS:1-73, wherein the first polypeptide binds CD80 and/or CD86 and/or an extracellular domain of either or both, and (ii) a second polypeptide comprising a comprising a hinge region, CH2 domain, and CH3 domain of an IgG polypeptide. The second polypeptide may comprise any suitable Ig polypeptide discussed elsewhere herein, including, e.g., that comprising the polypeptide sequence of SEQ ID NO:184 or SEQ ID NO:218.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides a method of making a soluble fusion protein dimer. The method comprises culturing a host cell transformed with an expression vector comprising a nucleotide sequence that encodes a soluble fusion protein dimer of the invention. Exemplary fusion proteins include those comprising the polypeptide sequence of any of SEQ ID NOS:74-79, 197-200, 205-214, and 219-222. The vector includes a nucleotide sequence that facilitates expression of the fusion protein (e.g., a nucleotide sequence encoding a signal peptide). The fusion protein is secreted from the host cell as a disulfide-bonded fusion protein dimer comprising two identical fusion proteins, and the disulfide-bonded fusion protein dimer is recovered from the culture medium. In some such methods, the disulfide-bonded fusion protein dimer is formed via a covalent disulfide bond between a cysteine residue on each fusion protein. The fusion protein dimer is typically recovered from the culture medium, host cell, or host cell periplasm. Example 12 provides an exemplary procedure for creating a stably transfected cell line expressing a mutant CTLA4-Ig fusion protein of the invention, producing the mutant CTLA4-Ig fusion protein, and the purifying the mutant fusion protein from culture.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to recombinant production, the polypeptides of the invention may be produced by direct peptide synthesis using solid-phase techniques (see, e.g., Stewart et al. (1969) S\nOLID\n-P\nHASE \nP\nEPTIDE \nS\nYNTHESIS\n, W.H. Freeman Co, San Francisco and Merrifield J. (1963) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 85:2149-2154). Peptide synthesis may be performed using manual techniques or by automation. Automated synthesis may be achieved, for example, using Applied Biosystems 431A Peptide Synthesizer (Perkin Elmer, Foster City, Calif.) in accordance with the instructions provided by the manufacturer. For example, subsequences may be chemically synthesized separately and combined using chemical methods to produce a polypeptide of the invention or fragments thereof. Alternatively, synthesized polypeptides may be ordered from any number of companies that specialize in production of polypeptides. Most commonly, polypeptides of the invention are produced by expressing coding nucleic acids and recovering polypeptides, e.g., as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention includes a method of producing a polypeptide of the invention comprising introducing a nucleic acid of the invention, a vector of the invention, or a combination thereof, into an animal, such as a mammal (including, e.g., rat, nonhuman primate, bat, marmoset, pig, or chicken), such that a polypeptide of the invention is expressed in the animal, and the polypeptide is isolated from the animal or from a byproduct of the animal. Isolation of the polypeptide from the animal or animal byproduct can be by any suitable technique, depending on the animal and desired recovery strategy. For example, the polypeptide can be recovered from sera of mice, monkeys, or pigs expressing the polypeptide of the invention. Transgenic animals (including the aforementioned mammals) comprising at least one nucleic acid of the invention are provided by the invention. The transgenic animal can have the nucleic acid integrated into its host genome (e.g., by an AAV vector, lentiviral vector, biolistic techniques performed with integration-promoting sequences, etc.) or can have the nucleic acid in maintained epichromosomally (e.g., in a non-integrating plasmid vector or by insertion in a non-integrating viral vector). Epichromosomal vectors can be engineered for more transient gene expression than integrating vectors. RNA-based vectors offer particular advantages in this respect.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention further provides novel and useful compositions comprising at least one component of the invention, such as, e.g., at least one polypeptide (including, e.g., fusion proteins and multimeric polypeptides), conjugate, nucleic acid, vector, virus, virus-like particle (VLP), and/or cell of the invention, or any combination thereof and a carrier, excipient, or diluent. The carrier, excipient or diluent may be a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, excipient, or diluent.

Some such pharmaceutical compositions comprise sodium citrate buffer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one exemplary aspect, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising from about 1 mg/ml to about 300 mg/ml of a CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein of the invention (e.g., D3-54-IgG2) (e.g., about 1 mg/ml to about 100 mg/ml, e.g., about 50 mg/ml or about 100 mg/ml) which is typically expressed as a dimeric fusion protein, in 20 mM HEPES buffer in water, 100 mM NaCl, 2% by weight sucrose based on the composition, pH 7.4, optionally including a non-ionic detergent (e.g., Tween®-20, Tween®-40, Tween®-60, Tween®-80, or pluronic F-68) at a concentration of about 0.01 mg/ml to about 0.5 mg/ml, e.g., about 0.01 mg/ml to about 0.1 mg/ml, and optionally including a polyethylene glycol (PEG), such as a PEG molecule having a molecular weight of from about 200 Daltons (Da) to about 8000 Da (e.g., about 200, 300, 400, 600, 900, 1000, 1450, 3350, 4500, or 8000 Da, available from Dow Chemical). In another exemplary aspect, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising from about 1 mg/ml to about 300 mg/ml of a CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein of the invention (e.g., D3-69-IgG2), which is typically expressed as a dimeric fusion protein, in 20 mM sodium citrate buffer in water, 100 mM NaCl, 2% by weight sucrose based on the composition, pH 6.5, optionally including a non-ionic detergent (e.g., Tween®-20, Tween®-40, Tween®-60, Tween®-80, or pluronic F-68) at a concentration of about 0.01 mg/ml to about 0.5 mg/ml, e.g., about 0.01 mg/ml to about 0.1 mg/ml, and optionally including a PEG molecule, such as a PEG molecule having a molecular weight of from about 200 Da to about 8000 Da (e.g., about 200, 300, 400, 600, 900, 1000, 1450, 3350, 4500, or 8000 Da, available from Dow Chemical).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention includes receptacles for containing a composition of the invention comprising a molecule of the invention (e.g., mutant CTLA-4 molecule, such as a mutant CTLA-4-Ig) and an excipient, diluent, or carrier. The composition may be a pharmaceutical composition comprising a molecule of the invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, diluent or carrier. Receptacles include, but are not limited to, e.g., vials (e.g., glass vial, such as a Type I glass vial), autoinjectors, pen injectors (fixed dose or variable dose), and pre-filled syringes, or other suitable containers. If desired, a receptacle can contain one or more pre-determined doses of the molecule of the invention effective to suppress an immune response or treat an immune system disease or disorder as described elsewhere herein. Some such receptacles are useful for administration of the composition contained therein to a subject suffering from an immune disease or disorder (e.g., autoinjectors, pen injectors, pre-filled syringes, etc.). Some such receptacles allow for self-administration of the composition by the subject (e.g., pen injectors, autoinjectors, pre-filled syringes, etc.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso provided are stable compositions or formulations of a molecule (e.g., mutant CTLA-4 ECD or mutant CTLA-4-Ig) of the invention, including pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of a molecule of the invention with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In another aspect, the invention includes freeze-dried or lyophilized compositions or formulations. The term “freeze-dried” or “lyophilized” generally refers to the state of a substance which has been subjected to a drying procedure such as freeze-drying or lyophilization, where at least 50% of moisture has been removed. Pre-lyophilization and lyophilization procedures are well known in the art (see, e.g., L\nYOPHILIZATION OF \nB\nIOPHARMACEUTICALS\n, Vol. 2 of B\nIOTECHNOLOGY\n: P\nHARMACEUTICAL \nA\nSPECTS \n(Henry R. Costantino et al. eds., 2004), U.S. Pat. No. 6,436,897, WO 06/104852), and would be readily understood by a skilled artisan. Any suitable lyophilization procedure can be employed or modified as appropriate by one skilled on the art in preparing the lyophilized composition of the invention. A freeze-dried, air-dried, spray-dried, or lyophilized composition is usually prepared from a liquid, such as a solution, suspension, emulsion, etc. The liquid to be freeze-dried, air-dried, spray-dried, or lyophilized typically includes all of the components (except the liquid, e.g., water) that are to be in the final reconstituted liquid composition. In this way, the freeze-dried, air-dried, spray-dried, or lyophilized composition will have the desired liquid composition (e.g., pharmaceutical composition) when reconstituted. Exemplary compositions of the invention, including pharmaceutical compositions, comprising a molecule of the invention (e.g., mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein of the invention, such as, e.g., SEQ ID NO:197, 199, 211, or 213), which are described throughout this application, can be freeze-dried, air-dried, spray-dried, or lyophilized to produce a stable freeze-dried, air-dried, spray-dried, or lyophilized composition, respectively, by using standard procedures known in the art. See e.g., exemplary procedures described in L\nYOPHILIZATION OF \nB\nIOPHARMACEUTICALS\n, supra.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, a container (e.g., vial, such as a glass vial) containing a liquid composition a molecule of the invention (e.g., mutant CTLA-4-Ig, fusion protein of the invention, such as, e.g., SEQ ID NO:197, 199, 211, or 213) to be lyophilized can be lyophilized by using standard procedures known by those of ordinary skill in the art. See, e.g., L\nYOPHILIZATION OF \nB\nIOPHARMACEUTICALS\n, supra. The lyophilized molecule of the invention (e.g., mutant CTLA-4-Ig of the invention) can subsequently be reconstituted with a liquid to generate a reconstituted liquid composition. Lyophilized formulations are typically reconstituted by the addition of an aqueous solution to dissolve the lyophilized formulation. Any suitable aqueous liquid or solution can be used to reconstitute a lyophilized formulation. A lyophilized formulation is often reconstituted using sterile or distilled water, but solutions comprising carriers, excipients, diluents buffers, and/or other components, including those described throughout, can be used for reconstitution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition in lyophilized form, wherein the composition comprises from about 1 mg/ml to about 300 mg/ml of a CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein of the invention, which is typically expressed as a dimeric fusion protein, in appropriate buffer (e.g., HEPES, disodium citrate-trisodium citrate, etc.) in water at a concentration to maintain the desired pH (e.g., about pH 6.0 to about pH 7.5), salt (e.g., 50 mM NaCl), sugar (e.g., 4-6% by weight sucrose based on the composition), and optionally including a non-ionic detergent (Tween®-20, Tween®-40, Tween®-60, Tween®-80, or pluronic F-68) at a concentration of about 0.01 mg/ml to about 0.5 mg/ml, e.g., about 0.01 mg/ml to about 0.1 mg/ml (e.g., Tween®-20, Tween®-60, Tween®-80, or pluronic F-68). A lyphophilized form of a pharmaceutical typically includes a lower salt concentration and a higher sugar concentration compared to a non-lyophilized liquid composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one particular aspect, the invention provides a stable lyophilized composition for therapeutic administration upon reconstitution with sterile water which comprises a therapeutically effective amount of a molecule of the invention and optionally one or more of the following pharmaceutically acceptable components: (a) a sugar or saccharide, such a sucrose, mannose, dextrose, or trehalose in an amount of from about 1% by weight to about 10% by weight; (b) a detergent or emulsifier, such as Tween®-20, Tween®-40, Tween®-60, Tween®-80, or pluronic F-68; (c) an isotonic agent or salt, such as an inorganic salt (e.g., sodium chloride) in a concentration of from 0 mM to about 50 mM (including, e.g., the concentrations set forth above; (d) a suitable buffer to maintain the pH of the composition within a range which is conducive to the stability of the molecule; (e) dispersing agent (e.g., in an amount sufficient for long-term dispersion of the molecule of the invention, such as, e.g., from 0.001 w/v % to about 1.0 w/v %) (e.g., polysorbate, such as Tween®-20, Tween®-40, Tween®-60, or Tween®-80, or pluronic F-68); and (f) a stabilizer (e.g., saccharide, dextrans, low molecular weight (MW) PEG group, such as PEG having MW of from about 200 Da to about 8000 Da (e.g., 200, 300, 400, 600, 900, 1000, 1450, 3350, 4500, or 8000 Da) or preservative. In some such stable lyophilized compositions, the molecule of the invention is a recombinant or isolated fusion protein of the invention, such as a fusion protein comprising a polypeptide sequence having at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99%, or 100% sequence identity to at least one polypeptide sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS:74-79, 197-200, 205-214, and 219-222 (optionally, e.g., selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS:197, 199, 211, and 213), wherein the fusion protein binds CD80 and/or CD86 and/or an extracellular domain thereof and/or suppresses an immune response. Such fusion proteins may be in monomeric or dimeric form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary amounts of each such component in the lyophilized composition include those described above and herein. In one aspect, the buffer is selected so as to maintain the pH of the composition within a range of from about \npH\n 3 to about \npH\n 8, from about \npH\n 4 to about pH 7.5. A lyophilized composition of the invention comprising a recombinant mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein of the invention is typically stable at −80° to +40° C. and/or substantially maintains its biological activity for at least one week, one or more months (e.g., six months), one year, two years, three years, four years, or more when stored at ambient temperatures (e.g., about 22° C. to about 30° C.). Upon reconstitution with a liquid (e.g., sterile water for injection (WFI)), the lyophilized composition is suitable for administration (e.g., i.v., s.c., parenteral, i.m., i.d., i.p., etc.) to a subject (e.g., human).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides a kit comprising a lyophilized or freeze-dried composition comprising a lyophilized or freeze-dried molecule of the invention (e.g., mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein, such as, e.g., SEQ ID NO:197, 199, 211, or 213) in a first container (e.g., vial, such as a glass vial) and instructions for reconstituting the freeze-dried or lyophilized composition using a liquid (e.g., sterile water, WFI, or buffer). Optionally, the kit further comprises a second container (e.g., vial, such as a glass vial) containing a sufficient amount of liquid (e.g., sterile water, WFI or buffer) for reconstitution of the lyophilized or freeze-dried composition into a liquid composition. In this instance, reconstitution is achieved by using a syringe to remove a desired volume of water from the second container and to introduce the water into the first container. The first container is then rocked gently to put the molecule of the invention (e.g., fusion protein) into solution. The kit may include a device(s) for reconstituting the lyophilized or freeze-dried composition and/or administering the reconstituted liquid composition. Exemplary devices include, but are not limited to, e.g., a two-component mixing syringe, dual-chambered syringe, and dual-chambered autoinjector. One component or chamber contains the lyophilized composition and the second component or chamber contains the liquid for reconstitution. With such devices, reconstitution is typically carried out just prior to administration, and the reconstituted composition is usually administered parenterally (e.g., s.c., i.v., i.m., i.d. injection).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe composition or pharmaceutical composition of the invention can comprise or be in the form of a liposome. Suitable lipids for liposomal formulation include, without limitation, monoglycerides, diglycerides, sulfatides, lysolecithin, phospholipids, saponin, bile acids, and the like. Preparation of such liposomal formulations is described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,837,028 and 4,737,323.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe form of the compositions or pharmaceutical composition can be dictated, at least in part, by the route of administration of the polypeptide, conjugate, nucleic acid, vector, virus, VLP, or cell of interest. Because numerous routes of administration are possible, the form of the pharmaceutical composition and its components can vary. For example, in transmucosal or transdermal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated can be included in the composition. Such penetrants are generally known in the art, and include, for example, for transmucosal administration, detergents, bile salts, and fusidic acid derivatives. In contrast, in transmucosal administration can be facilitated through the use of nasal sprays or suppositories.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA common administration form for compositions of the invention, including pharmaceutical compositions, is by injection. Injectable pharmaceutically acceptable compositions typically comprise one or more suitable liquid carriers such as water, petroleum, physiological saline, bacteriostatic water, Cremophor ELTM (BASF, Parsippany, N.J.), PBS, or oils. Liquid pharmaceutical compositions can further include physiological saline solution, dextrose (or other saccharide solution), alcohols (e.g., ethanol), polyols (polyalcohols, such as mannitol, sorbitol, etc.), or glycols, such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, PEG molecules, coating agents which promote proper fluidity, such as lecithin, isotonic agents, such as mannitol or sorbitol, organic esters such as ethyoleate, and absorption-delaying agents, such as aluminum monostearate and gelatins. The injectable composition can be in the form of a pyrogen-free, stable, aqueous solution. An injectable aqueous solution may comprise an isotonic vehicle such as sodium chloride, Ringer's injection solution, dextrose, lactated Ringer's injection solution, or an equivalent delivery vehicle (e.g., sodium chloride/dextrose injection solution). Formulations suitable for injection by intraarticular, intravenous, intramuscular, intradermal, subdermal, intraperitoneal, and subcutaneous routes, include aqueous and non-aqueous, isotonic sterile injection solutions, which can include solvents, co-solvents, antioxidants, reducing agents, chelating agents, buffers, bacteriostats, antimicrobial preservatives, and solutes that render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient (e.g., PBS and/or saline solutions, such as 0.1 M NaCl), and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions that can include suspending agents, solubilizers, thickening agents, emulsifying agents, stabilizers, and preservatives.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe administration of a polypeptide, conjugate, nucleic acid, vector, virus, pseudovirus, VLP or cell of the invention (or a composition comprising any such component) can be facilitated by a delivery device formed of any suitable material. Examples of suitable matrix materials for producing non-biodegradable administration devices include hydroxapatite, bioglass, aluminates, or other ceramics. In some applications, a sequestering agent, such as carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), methylcellulose, or hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), can be used to bind the particular component to the device for localized delivery.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA nucleic acid or vector of the invention can be formulated with one or more poloxamers, polyoxyethylene/polyoxypropylene block copolymers, or other surfactants or soap-like lipophilic substances for delivery of the nucleic acid or vector to a population of cells or tissue or skin of a subject. See e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,149,922, 6,086,899, and 5,990,241.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acids and vectors of the invention can be associated with one or more transfection-enhancing agents. In some embodiments, a nucleic acid and/or nucleic acid vector of the invention typically is associated with one or more stability-promoting salts, carriers (e.g., PEG), and/or formulations that aid in transfection (e.g., sodium phosphate salts, dextran carriers, iron oxide carriers, or biolistic delivery (“gene gun”) carriers, such as gold bead or powder carriers). See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,945,050. Additional transfection-enhancing agents include viral particles to which the nucleic acid or nucleic acid vector can be conjugated, a calcium phosphate precipitating agent, a protease, a lipase, a bipuvicaine solution, a saponin, a lipid (e.g., a charged lipid), a liposome (e.g., a cationic liposome), a transfection facilitating peptide or protein-complex (e.g., a poly(ethylenimine), polylysine, or viral protein-nucleic acid complex), a virosome, or a modified cell or cell-like structure (e.g., a fusion cell).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acids and vectors of the invention can also be delivered by in vivo or ex vivo electroporation methods, including, e.g., those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,110,161 and 6,261,281, and Widera et al., J. of Immunol. 164:4635-4640 (2000).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTransdermal administration of a component of the invention (e.g., polypeptide, conjugate, nucleic acid, vector, virus, VLP, and/or cell of the invention) can be facilitated by a transdermal patch comprising such component in any suitable composition in any suitable form. Such transdermal patch devices are provided by the invention. For example, such component can be contained in a liquid reservoir in a drug reservoir patch device, or, alternatively, the component can be dispersed throughout a material suitable for incorporation in a simple monolithic transdermal patch device. Typically, the patch comprises an immunosuppressive amount of at least one such component—such as an amount effective to suppress an immune response in a subject contacted with the patch. Examples of such patch devices are known in the art. The patch device can be either a passive device or a device capable of iontophoretic delivery of at least one such component to the skin or tissue of the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA composition, particularly a pharmaceutical composition, may comprise any suitable dose of at least one such component of the invention (e.g., polypeptide, conjugate, nucleic acid, vector, virus, VLP, and/or cell) sufficient to achieve the desired immunosuppressive response in a subject following administration. Proper dosage can be determined by any suitable technique and considerations for determining the proper are known in the art. In a simple dosage testing regimen, low doses of the composition are administered to a test subject or system (e.g., an animal model, cell-free system, or whole-cell assay system). Dosage is commonly determined by the efficacy of the particular component to be administered, the condition of the subject, the body weight of the subject, and/or target area of the subject to be treated. The size of the dose is also determined by the existence, nature, and extent of any adverse side-effects that accompany the administration of any such particular component in a particular subject. Principles related to dosage of therapeutic and prophylactic agents are provided in, e.g., Platt, Clin. Lab Med. 7:289-99 (1987), “Drug Dosage,” J. Kans. Med. Soc. 70(1):30-32 (1969), and other references described herein (e.g., Remington's, supra).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy way of example, a therapeutically effective amount of a polypeptide of the invention for an initial dosage for treating an autoimmune disease may comprise from about 0.001 mg/kg body weight of the subject to about 100 mg/kg body weight of the subject, such as, e.g., from about 0.001 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) body weight of the subject to about 100 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) weight of the subject, or, e.g., from about 0.001 mg/kg weight of the subject to at least about 0.005, 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 75, 80, 90, or 100 mg/kg body weight of the subject. Such dosage can be by any suitable protocol, e.g., such as administered daily, weekly, or biweekly, or any combination thereof (e.g., at about 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 days, weekly thereafter, or at about 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6 weeks), followed by 1-, 2-, 3-month intervals, and by any suitable delivery method, such as, e.g., by electroporation or a subcutaneous (s.c.), intramuscular (i.m.), intravenous (i.v.), or intraperitoneal (i.p.), subdermal, transdermal, parenteral, or intradermal (i.d.) injection. In some instances, a polypeptide of the invention is typically administered as a soluble polypeptide, such as, e.g., a fusion protein comprising a mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide of the invention covalently linked to an Ig Fc polypeptide. For example, a pharmaceutical composition comprising a mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein of the invention in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent, or excipient may be administered by any appropriate route (e.g., intradermally, intravenously, or subcutaneously) in an effective amount depending upon the autoimmune disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis) or condition to be treated (e.g., to inhibit rejection of a tissue, cell, graft, or solid organ transplant from a donor by the recipient subject).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one exemplary aspect, the invention provides a method of suppressing an immune response in a subject in need thereof, comprising administering to the subject a pharmaceutical composition comprising, e.g., from about 1 mg/ml to about 300 mg/ml, including from about 25 mg/ml to about 150 mg/ml (e.g., 50 or 100 mg/ml) of D3-54-IgG2 fusion protein in 20 mM HEPES buffer in water, 100 mM NaCl, 2% by weight sucrose, pH 7.4, wherein the subject suffers from an autoimmune disorder (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis). In another exemplary aspect, the invention provides method of inhibiting rejection of a tissue, cell, graft or solid organ transplant from a donor in a recipient subject, comprising administering to the recipient subject a pharmaceutical composition comprising from about 25 mg/ml to about 100 mg/ml (e.g., 50 or 100 mg/ml) of D3-69-IgG2 fusion protein in 20 mM sodium citrate buffer in water, 100 mM NaCl, 2% by weight sucrose, pH 6.5.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso provided is a viral vector composition, which comprises a carrier or excipient and a viral vector of the invention. Pharmaceutical compositions comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient and a viral vector are also provided. The amount or dosage of viral vector particles or viral vector particle-encoding nucleic acid depends on: (1) the type of viral vector particle with respect to origin of vector, including, but not limited to, e.g., whether the vector is an alphaviral vector, Semliki-Forest viral vector, adenoviral vector, adeno-associated (AAV) viral vector, flaviviral vector, papillomaviral vector, and/or herpes simplex viral (HSV) vector, (2) whether the vector is a transgene expressing or recombinant peptide displaying vector, (3) the host, and (4) other considerations discussed above. Generally, with respect to gene transfer vectors, the pharmaceutically acceptable composition comprises at least about 1×10\n2 \nviral vector particles in a volume of about 1 ml (e.g., at least about 1×10\n2 \nto 1×10\n8 \nparticles in about 1 ml). Higher dosages also can be suitable (e.g., at least about 1×10\n6\n, about 1×10\n8\n, about 1×10\n9\n, about 1×10\n10 \nparticles/ml).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides a composition (including a pharmaceutical composition) comprising an aggregate of two or more polypeptides or conjugates of the invention. Moreover, the invention provides a composition (including a pharmaceutical composition) comprising a population of one or more multimeric polypeptides or multimeric conjugates of the invention. As noted above, pharmaceutical compositions include a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, diluent, or carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nKits\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides kits including one, two, three, or more of the polypeptides (e.g., mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptides, mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins, including dimeric fusion proteins), conjugates, nucleic acids, vectors, cells, and/or compositions of the invention. Kits of the invention optionally comprise: (1) at least one polypeptide (e.g., mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein), conjugate, nucleic acid, vector, VLP, cell, and/or composition of the invention; (2) optionally at least one second immunosuppressive agent (e.g., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent, methotrexate, steroid, TNFα antagonist, etc.); (3) instructions for practicing any method described herein, including a therapeutic or prophylactic method and instructions for using any component identified in (1) or (2); (4) a container for holding the at least one such component identified in (1) or (2); and/or (5) packaging materials. One or more of the polypeptides (e.g., mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein), conjugates, nucleic acids, vectors, VLPs, cells, and/or compositions of the invention, optionally with one or more second immunosuppressive agents, can be packaged in packs, dispenser devices, and kits for administration to a subject, such as a mammal, including a human. An effective amount of each such polypeptide (e.g., mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein), conjugate, nucleic acid, vector, VLP, cell, and/or composition of the invention or optional second immunosuppressive agent (e.g., dose) for the indicated therapeutic or prophylactic method is indicated and one or more such doses is provided. The one or more polypeptides (e.g., mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein), conjugates, nucleic acids, vectors, and/or cells compositions, and, if desired, the optional second immunosuppressive agent, may be provided in powder (e.g., lyophilized) or liquid form, and may be formulated with an excipient or carrier (including, e.g., a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier), thereby forming a composition (including, e.g., pharmaceutical composition). Packs or dispenser devices that comprise one or more unit dosage forms are provided. Typically, instructions for administration of such components are provided with the packaging, along with a suitable indication on the label that the compound is suitable for treatment of an indicated condition.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following examples further illustrate the invention, but should not be construed as limiting its scope in any way.\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\n \n \n \nThis example provides a description of the methods for creating a LEA29Y-Ig fusion protein, which was used as a control and for comparative purposes in Biacore™ binding and cell-based activity assays.\n\n\n \nCreation of DNA Plasmid Vector Encoding LEA29Y-Ig Fusion Protein.\n\n\n \n \n \nThis example describes the making of a DNA plasmid vector that encodes the LEA29Y-Ig fusion protein. LEA29Y-Ig comprises a specific known mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide, termed “LEA29Y” (or “LEA” or “L104EA29Y” or “A29YL104E”), which is covalently linked at its C-terminus to the N-terminus of a specific mutant human IgG1 Fc polypeptide. The LEA29Y polypeptide is a mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide comprising a polypeptide sequence that differs from the polypeptide sequence of the human CTLA-4 extracellular domain by two mutations—an A29Y substitution and a L104E substitution—where positions 29 and 104 are numbered by reference to the polypeptide sequence of the human CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide, with the first amino acid residue of human CTLA-4 designated as amino \nacid residue position\n 1. See U.S. Pat. No. 7,094,874. The plasmid vector pcDNA3.1-LEA, which includes a nucleotide sequence that encodes LEA29Y-Ig, was created to produce this fusion protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDNA encoding LEA29Y-Ig is created by PCR assembly using overlapping oligonucleotides designed based on sequence homology to the nucleotide sequence encoding LEA29Y-Ig shown in SEQ ID NO:167. The oligonucleotides are designed, made, and assembled using standard procedures well known by those of ordinary skill in the art and can include stop and start codons and restriction sites as necessary. The PCR amplification procedures employed are also well known in the art. See, e.g., Berger, Ausubel, and Sambrook, all supra.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe oligonucleotides are assembled in a 100 μl PCR reaction with 1 μM oligonucleotides, 1×Taq buffer (Qiagen; #201225) and 200 μM dNTPs for 30 amplification cycles (94° C., 30 s; 60° C., 30 s; 72° C., 60 s). Amplified DNA is purified by QiaQuick PCR Spin Columns (Qiagen, Cat. #28104) and digested with restriction enzymes NheI and SacII. The fragments were separated by agarose-gel electrophoresis, purified using Qiaquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, #28704) as per manufacturer's recommendation, and ligated into similarly digested plasmid pcDNA 3.1 (+) (Invitrogen, Cat. #V790-20). Ligations are transformed into TOP10 \nE. coli \ncells (Qiagen, Cat. #C4040-10) as per manufacturer's recommendations. The resulting cells are incubated overnight at 37° C. in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml carbenicillin with shaking at 250 rpm and then used to make a maxiprep (Qiagen; #12362) stock of plasmid DNA (referred to hereinafter as plasmid vector pcDNA3.1-LEA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe plasmid vector pcDNA3.1-LEA is identical to the plasmid vector pcDNA mutant CTLA-4-IgG2 vector shown in \nFIG. 1\n except that the nucleic acid sequence encoding the mutant CTLA-4-IgG2 polypeptide has been replaced by a nucleic acid sequence encoding the LEA29Y-Ig fusion protein. A nucleic acid encoding the human CTLA-4 signal peptide was included as the signal peptide-encoding nucleotide sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA nucleic acid sequence encoding the predicted LEA29Y-Ig fusion protein is shown in SEQ ID NO:167. SEQ ID NO:167 includes the nucleotide sequence encoding the signal peptide (e.g., amino acid residues 1-37 of SEQ ID NO:165). The polypeptide sequences of the predicted LEA29Y-Ig and mature LEA29Y-Ig fusion protein (without the signal peptide) are shown in SEQ ID NOS:165 and 166, respectively. As indicated in \nFIG. 2C\n, the predicted amino acid sequence of LEA29Y-Ig includes the following segments: the predicted signal peptide (amino acid residues 1-37), the LEA29Y ECD polypeptide (amino acid residues 38-161), linker (amino acid residue 162), and a mutant (modified) Fc domain of a human IgG1 polypeptide (amino acid residues 163-394). The amino acid residues at the junctions between these various segments are also shown in \nFIG. 2C\n. Specifically, the last four amino acid residues of the signal peptide, the first five and last five amino acid residues of the LEA29Y ECD, the single linker amino acid residue (Q), and the first five and last five amino acid residues of the mutant IgG1 Fc polypeptide are shown.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe signal peptide is typically cleaved during processing and thus the secreted fusion protein (i.e., mature fusion protein) of LEA29Y-Ig does not usually contain the signal peptide sequence. The mature/secreted form of LEA29Y-Ig, which has a total of 357 amino acids, comprises amino acid residues 38-394 (the full-length sequence without the signal peptide) of the predicted sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:165, and begins with the amino acid sequence: methionine-histidine-valine-alanine. SEQ ID NO:165 includes the signal peptide (e.g., residues 1-37) at its N-terminus; the signal peptide is typically cleaved to form the mature protein shown in SEQ ID NO:166. If desired, the amino acids of the mature form can be numbered beginning with the Met of the Met-His-Val-Ala sequence, designating Met as the first residue (e.g., the ECD comprises amino acid residues numbered 1-124), as in the mature LEA29Y-Ig fusion protein having the sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:166. In one aspect, the sequence of SEQ ID NO:165 or 166 does not include the C-terminal lysine residue; this residue may cleaved during processing or prior to secretion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe protein sequence of the LEA29Y-Ig fusion protein is described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,094,874. Specifically, SEQ ID NO:4 of U.S. Pat. No. 7,094,874 shows a protein sequence encoding the non-mature form of monomeric LEA29Y-Ig. In U.S. Pat. No. 7,094,874, the LEA29Y-Ig fusion protein is termed “L104EA29YIg.” The mature LEA29Y-Ig fusion protein comprising the sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:166 set forth herein differs from the fusion protein sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:4 in U.S. Pat. No. 7,094,874 because SEQ ID NO:4 of U.S. Pat. No. 7,094,874 includes a signal peptide (i.e., residues 1-26 of SEQ ID NO:4). This signal peptide is typically cleaved during processing and thus the mature (secreted) form of the LEA29Y-Ig fusion protein does not usually include the signal peptide sequence. SEQ ID NO:3 of U.S. Pat. No. 7,094,874 presents a nucleic acid sequence that encodes the L104EA29YIg fusion protein (i.e., LEA29Y-Ig).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLEA29Y-Ig typically exists in solution as a dimeric fusion protein comprising two identical monomeric fusion proteins. In this instance, each monomeric mature LEA29Y-Ig fusion protein comprises a LEA29Y ECD (SEQ ID NO:168) polypeptide fused at its C-terminus to the N-terminus of a mutant IgG1 Fc (SEQ ID NO:186). The two LEA29Y-Ig monomers are covalently linked together by disulfide bonds formed between cysteine residues in each monomer, thereby forming the LEA29Y-Ig fusion protein dimer. The LEA29Y-Ig dimer is the form of the fusion protein molecule used in the assays described in these Examples, unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n\n\n \nCreation of Stable CHO-K1 Cell Line Expressing LEA29Y-Ig Fusion Protein.\n\n\n \n \n \nA stable cell line was created to generate multi-milligram quantities of the LEA29Y-Ig fusion protein discussed above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTransfection of CHO-K1 Cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCHO-K1 cells were seeded at a density of 1×10\n6 \nin T-175 flasks (BD Falcon, #353112) containing 40 ml Growth Medium (DMEM/F12 medium (Invitrogen, #10565-018) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone, #SV30014.03) and 1×PS (Penicillin+Streptomycin) (Invitrogen, #15140-122)). Cells were incubated for 24 hours (hrs) at 37° C. and then transfected with 10 μg Maxiprep plasmid DNA (e.g., plasmid vector encoding LEA29Y-Ig as described above) mixed with 60 μl Fugene 6 (Roche, #11814443001) as per the manufacturer's recommended conditions. Cells were incubated for 2 days (d) at 37° C. in Growth Medium and then for 10 d in Selection Medium (Growth Medium containing 300 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen, #10131-027), changing the media every 2 d. The medium was removed and cells were dispersed by addition of 3 ml 0.05% trypsin (Invitrogen, Cat. #25300-054) and incubation at 37° C. for 3 min. Dispersed cells were diluted into 10 ml Growth Medium and harvested by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 5 min at room temperature (RT) in a GH-3.8 rotor (Beckman Coulter, #360581). After discarding the supernatant, cells were suspended in 1 ml growth medium, filtered through 40 μm membranes (BD Falcon, #352340), and adjusted to a density of 1×10\n6 \ncells/ml.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeparation of Unique Clones.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsing a cell-sorter (Dako, MoFlo), live cells were individually dispersed into 96-well culture plates (Sigma-Aldrich, #CLS-3596) containing 200 μl/well Growth Medium containing 25% Conditioned Medium (Growth Medium previously harvested from untransfected (or naïve) cell cultures). After incubation at 37° C. for 10-14 d, cells were dispersed by trypsin hydrolysis and transferred to new culture plates containing 200 μl/well Growth Medium. Cells were cultured at 37° C. in Growth Medium until cell density reached 70% confluence (approximately 14 d, with medium changed every 7 d).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIdentification of Desired Clones.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nClones expressing high levels of recombinant LEA29Y-Ig fusion protein were identified by dot-blot and western analysis. For dot-blot analysis, 100 μl of medium was harvested from each well of the 96-well culture plates and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman, #10439388) as per the manufacturer's recommendations. Membranes were washed twice with 200 ml PBST (PBST is phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)+0.05% Tween®-20) for 10 min at room temperature (RT) and then incubated with PBST containing 5% nonfat dry milk (EMD, #1.15363.0500) for 1 hour (hr) at RT. Membranes were washed as described above and incubated for 1 hr at RT in 20 ml PBST containing horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-human Ig antibody (Vector Labs, #BA-3000) diluted to 1:4000. Membranes were washed as described above and incubated for 1 hr at RT with PBST containing streptavidin-HRP reagent (BD Biosciences, #554066) diluted 1:2000. Membranes were washed as described above and signals were detected using ECL Western Blot Detection Reagent (Amersham, Cat. #RPN2132) as per the manufacturer's recommended conditions. Positive clones identified by high signal intensity (i.e., expressing high levels of fusion protein) were dispersed by trypsin hydrolysis and transferred to 6-well culture plates (BD Falcon, Cat. #353046) containing 2 ml/well Growth Medium. After incubation at 37° C. for 3-4 d, cells were dispersed by trypsin hydrolysis and transferred to T-75 flasks (BD Falcon, Cat. #353136) containing 20 ml Growth Medium. After incubation at 37° C. for 2 d, 100 μl of medium was harvested and analyzed for protein expression levels by western analysis. For western analysis, equal amounts (15 μl) of medium from each cell culture was run through 4-12% Bis-Tris NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen, #NP0322BOX) in MES (MES is 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid, pH 7.3) running buffer (Invitrogen, #NP0002) as per the manufacturer's recommended conditions. Proteins were transferred from gels to nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen, Cat. #LC2001) by electro-transfer as per the manufacturer's recommended conditions. Membranes were processed as described above for dot-blotting and positive clones (expressing the fusion protein of interest) were identified by signal intensity and apparent molecular weight. Positive clones were dispersed by trypsin hydrolysis as described above and propagated in T-175 flasks containing 40 ml Growth Medium.\n\n\n \nProduction and Purification of LEA29Y-Ig Fusion Protein.\n\n\n \n \n \nPropagation of Roller Bottle Cultures.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA Stable CHO-K1 cell line that had been transfected as described above with nucleic acid encoding the fusion protein of interest was grown to confluence in T-175 flasks containing 40 ml Growth Medium (DMEM/F-12 medium (Invitrogen, #10565-018) supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone #SV30014.03) and 1×PS (Invitrogen, #15140-122)). Cells were harvested by incubation in 3 ml 0.05% trypsin (Invitrogen, Cat. #25300-054) for 3 min at 37° C., diluted into 12 ml Growth Medium and then transferred to roller bottles (Corning, Cat. #431191) containing 250 ml Growth Medium. After incubation of roller bottle cultures at 37° C. in a humidified rolling incubator for 2 d, the media was removed and replaced with 250 ml fresh Growth Medium. Cultures were incubated for 2 d at 37° C. and the medium was replaced with 250 ml UltraCHO Medium (UltraCHO medium (BioWhittaker, Cat. #12-724) supplemented with 1/1000 EX-CYTE (Serologicals Proteins, Cat. #81129N) and 1×PS). After incubation for 2 d at 37° C., the media was replaced with 250 ml fresh UltraCHO Medium. Cultures were incubated for 2 d at 37° C. and the medium was replaced with 250 ml Production Medium (DMEM/F-12 medium supplemented with 1/100×ITSA (Life Technologies #51300-044), 1/1000× EX-CYTE and 1×PS). During production, media was harvested and replaced with fresh Production Media every other day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProtein Purification.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProduction media from roller bottle cultures was clarified by centrifugation at 2500×g for 30 min at RT followed by filtration through 0.2 μM membranes (VWR, Cat. #73520-986). Media were concentrated 10-fold by tangential flow filtration using 10 kDa MWCO membranes (Millipore, Cat. #P3C010C00) and then used for Protein-A affinity chromatography using a BioCad vision HPLC system. Ig-fusion protein was bound to \nPoros\n 20 Protein-A resin (Applied Biosystems, Cat. #1-5029-01) in PBS buffer, washed with the same buffer, eluted with 80 mM citric acid buffer (pH 4.0) containing 160 mM sodium chloride and then neutralized by addition of 2M Tris base. The protein solution was finally dialyzed against 6 liters (l) PBS using 10 kDa MWCO membranes (Pierce, Cat. #PI66810).\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\n \n \n \nThis example describes exemplary methods used to create and screen libraries of CTLA-4 mutants for altered human CD80 and/or human CD86 binding activities by phage display.\n\n\n \nHuman CD80-Ig Fusion Protein.\n\n\n \n \n \nHuman CD80-Ig (“hCD80-Ig”) and human CD86-Ig (“hCD86-Ig”) fusion proteins were used as ligands in phage panning and phage ELISA experiments to identify mutant CTLA-4 molecules that bind human CD80 (“hCD80”) and/or human CD86 (“hCD86”) and/or an extracellular domain of either or both. Human CD80-Ig (also termed “hB7.1-Ig” or “hB7-1-Ig”) and human CD86-Ig (also termed “hB2.1-Ig” or “hB2-1-Ig”) fusion proteins are available from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, Minn.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA representative nucleic acid sequence encoding the predicted WT human CD80-IgG1 fusion protein, which comprises the human CD80 signal peptide, human CD80 ECD, and human IgG1 Fc, is shown in SEQ ID NO:172. The predicted and mature polypeptide sequences of the hCD80-IgG1 fusion protein are shown in SEQ ID NO:170 and SEQ ID NO:171, respectively. The predicted fusion protein shown in SEQ ID NO:170 comprises WT human CD80 ECD covalently fused at its C-terminus to the N-terminus of a human IgG1 Fc polypeptide and includes a signal peptide at its N-terminus. The signal peptide is typically cleaved to form the mature CD80-Ig fusion protein shown in SEQ ID NO:171.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHuman CD80-IgG1 is typically abbreviated herein as hCD80-Ig. As shown in \nFIG. 2A\n, the predicted amino acid sequence of the hCD80-Ig fusion protein (also designated “CD80-IgG1”) includes the following segments: the predicted signal peptide (amino acid residues 1-34), human CD80 ECD (amino acid residues 35-242), linker (amino acid residues 243-245), and human IgG1 Fc polypeptide (amino acid residues 246-476). The amino acid residues at the junctions between these various segments are shown in \nFIG. 2A\n. Specifically, the last four amino acid residues of the signal peptide, the first five and last five amino acid residues of the human CD80 ECD, the amino acid residues of the linker (GVT), and the first five and last five amino acid residues of the human IgG1 Fc polypeptide are shown. In the CD80-Ig fusion protein, three residues GVT are present as a cloning artifact (or linker) between the C-terminus of the CD80 ECD (which ends with the amino acid residues FPDN) and the N-terminus of the IgG1 Fc polypeptide (which begins with the amino acid residues PKSC). This GVT cloning artifact or linker is shown in the predicted and mature CD80-Ig polypeptide sequences shown in SEQ ID NO:170 and 171, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe signal peptide is typically cleaved during processing and thus the secreted fusion protein (i.e., mature fusion protein) of hCD80-Ig does not usually contain the signal peptide. The mature/secreted form of hCD80-Ig, which has a total of 442 amino acids, comprises amino acid residues 35-476 (the full-length sequence without the signal peptide) of SEQ ID NO:170, and begins with the amino acid residue sequence: valine-isoleucine-histidine-valine. If desired, the amino acids of the mature form can be numbered beginning with the valine (Val) of the Val-Ile-His-Val sequence, designating Val as the first residue (e.g., the ECD comprises amino acid residues numbered 1-208), as in the mature form of hCD80-Ig comprising the polypeptide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:171.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe hCD80-Ig fusion protein typically exists in solution as a dimeric fusion protein comprising two identical monomeric mature hCD80-Ig fusion proteins. In this instance, each monomeric mature hCD80-Ig fusion protein (SEQ ID NO:171) comprises a human CD80 ECD (SEQ ID NO:174) fused at its C-terminus to the N-terminus of a human IgG1 Fc (SEQ ID NO:185). The two hCD80-Ig monomers are covalently linked together by disulfide bonds formed between cysteine residues in each monomer, thereby forming the hCD80-Ig fusion protein dimer. The hCD80-Ig fusion protein dimer is the form of the fusion protein molecule used in the assays described in these Examples, unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA representative nucleic acid encoding the predicted full-length human CD80 polypeptide is shown in SEQ ID NO:196. The nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:196 encodes the human CD80 signal peptide, ECD, transmembrane domain, and cytoplasmic domain, and includes the TAA stop codon at the C-terminus.\n\n\n \nHuman CD86-Ig Fusion Protein.\n\n\n \n \n \nA representative nucleic acid sequence encoding the predicted amino acid sequence of human CD86-human IgG1 (typically abbreviated herein as “hCD86-Ig”) fusion protein is shown in SEQ ID NO:179. This nucleic acid sequence includes a nucleotide sequence encoding a signal peptide the mature human CD86-human IgG1 fusion protein. The predicted amino acid sequence of hCD86-Ig fusion protein is shown in SEQ ID NO:177, and an exemplary nucleic acid encoding the predicted hCD86-Ig fusion protein is shown in SEQ ID NO:179.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFIG. 2B\n, the predicted amino acid sequence of the hCD86-Ig fusion protein includes the following segments: the predicted signal peptide (amino acid residues 1-23), human CD86 extracellular domain (amino acid residues 24-243), linker sequence (amino acid residues 244-246), and human IgG1 Fc polypeptide (amino acid residues 247-477). The amino acid residues at the junctions between these various segments are also shown in \nFIG. 2B\n. Specifically, the last four amino acid residues of the signal peptide, the first five and last seven amino acid residues of the human CD86 ECD, the amino acid residues of the linker (GVT), and the first five and last five amino acid residues of the human IgG1 Fc polypeptide are shown.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe CD86 signal peptide is typically cleaved from the predicted hCD86-Ig polypeptide during processing and thus the secreted human CD86-Ig fusion protein (i.e., mature fusion protein) does not usually include the signal peptide. The mature/secreted form of hCD86-Ig, which has a total of 454 amino acids, comprises amino acid residues 24-477 (the full-length sequence without the signal peptide) of SEQ ID NO:177, and begins with the following amino acid residue sequence: alanine-proline-leucine. If desired, the amino acids of the mature fusion protein can be numbered beginning with the alanine residue (Ala) of the Ala-Pro-Leu sequence, designating Ala as the first residue (e.g., the ECD comprises amino acid residues numbered 1-218), as in the mature form of hCD86-Ig comprising the polypeptide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:178. The mature fusion protein (SEQ ID NO:178) comprises a WT hCD86 ECD protein covalently fused at its C-terminus to the N-terminus of a hIgG1 Fc polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe hCD86-Ig fusion protein typically exists in solution as a dimeric fusion protein comprising two identical monomeric mature hCD86-Ig fusion proteins. In this instance, each monomeric mature CD86-Ig fusion protein (SEQ ID NO:178) comprises a human CD86 ECD (SEQ ID NO:180) fused at its C-terminus to the N-terminus of a human IgG1 Fc (SEQ ID NO:185). The two hCD86-Ig monomers are covalently linked together by disulfide bonds formed between cysteine residues in each monomer, thereby forming the hCD86-Ig fusion protein dimer. The hCD86-Ig fusion protein dimer is the form of the fusion protein molecule used in the assays described in these Examples, unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the CD86-Ig fusion protein (e.g., predicted and mature forms), three residues GVT are present as a cloning artifact (or linker) between the C-terminus of the CD86 ECD and the N-terminus of the IgG1 Fc polypeptide. In another aspect, the WT human CD86 ECD protein comprises a polypeptide sequence comprising amino acid residues 1-218 of SEQ ID NO:180 (i.e., excluding the last two C-terminal amino acid residues at the (PP)).\n\n\n \nOrencia® Fusion Protein.\n\n\n \n \n \nAs an additional control and for comparative purposes, a commercially available fusion protein known as the Orencia® fusion protein (Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Princeton, N.J.) was purchased. The Orencia® fusion protein is composed of the WT human CTLA-4 extracellular domain covalently fused at its C-terminus to the N-terminus of a specific mutant IgG1 Fc polypeptide. The Orencia® protein is a dimeric fusion protein comprising two identical monomeric fusion proteins covalently linked together by disulfide bonds formed between cysteine residues present in each monomeric fusion protein. The polypeptide sequence of each mature Orencia® fusion protein monomer is shown in SEQ ID NO:164 and is composed of the following segments: a WT human CTLA-4 extracellular domain (amino acid residues 1-124), linker sequence (amino acid residue 125), and a mutant IgG1 Fc polypeptide (amino acid residues 126-357). Each Orencia® fusion protein monomer has a structure similar to that of the LEA29Y-Ig fusion protein monomer shown schematically in \nFIG. 2C\n, except that the LEA29Y ECD is replaced with WT human CTLA-4 ECD, and no signal peptide is present in either Orencia® fusion protein monomer, because each monomer is a secreted or mature fusion protein. The polypeptide sequence of the non-mature form of an Orencia® monomer (which includes a signal peptide) and a nucleic acid sequence encoding the non-mature form of an Orencia® fusion protein monomer are shown in SEQ ID NO:8 and SEQ ID NO:7, respectively, of U.S. Pat. No. 7,094,874. Methods of making and using the Orencia® fusion protein are also disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,094,874.\n\n\n \nCreation of DNA Sequences Encoding Mutant CTLA-4 Polypeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \nDirected evolution methods were used to generate libraries of recombinant non-naturally-occurring polynucleotides encoding recombinant mutant CTLA-4 extracellular domain polypeptides. The protein and nucleotide sequences of a number of naturally-occurring mammalian CTLA-4 homologues are known. See, e.g., National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Sequence diversity identified in a variety of naturally-occurring mammalian CTLA-4 extracellular domain homologues was used in directed evolution methods to generate libraries of recombinant polynucleotides encoding mutant CTLA-4 ECD domain polypeptides. Directed evolution procedures include, e.g., in vitro recombination and mutagenesis procedures as substantially described in Stemmer, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:10747-10751 (1994); Chang et al., Nature Biotech 17:793-797 (1999); Int'l Pat. Appn. Publ. No. WO 98/27230; and U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,117,679 and 6,537,776.\n\n\n \nCreation of Libraries of DNA Sequences Encoding Mutant CTLA-4 Polypeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \nMutant DNA sequences encoding recombinant mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptides were amplified from assembly reactions by PCR using forward and reverse primers designed based on sequence homology. The primers were designed, made, and assembled using standard procedures well known by those of ordinary skill in the art and included stop and start codons and restriction sites as necessary. The PCR amplification procedures employed are also well known in the art. See, e.g., Berger, Ausubel, and Sambrook, all supra. Exemplary forward and reverse primers include, but are not limited, to the following: forward primer (5′-CTATTGCTACGGCCGCTATGGCCMTKCACGTCGCTCAACCAGCCGTCGTACTC GCGTCC-3′) (SEQ ID NO:191) and reverse primer (5′-GTGATGGTGATGGTGTGCGGCCGCATCAGA-3′) (SEQ ID NO:192). 5 μl of assembly reaction was used as template in a 100 μl PCR reaction with 1 μM forward and reverse primers, Taq buffer (Qiagen; #201225) and 200 μM dNTPs for 15 amplification cycles (94° C. 30 s; 50° C. 30 s; 72° C. 40 s). Amplified DNA encoding mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptides was digested with restriction enzymes (SfiI and NotI) and the fragments were separated by agarose-gel electrophoresis, purified using the Qiaquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, #28704) as per manufacturer's recommendation, and ligated into similarly digested phage-display vector pSB0124 (procedure similar to that described in Chang et al., Nature Biotech 17:793-797 (1999)). The resulting library ligation was transformed by electroporation into TOP10 \nE. coli \ncells (Invitrogen, Inc; #C4040-50) following the manufacturer's recommend conditions. Transformed cells were incubated in LB (Luria broth media) containing 50 μg/ml carbenicillin at 250 rpm overnight at 37° C. and then used to make a maxiprep (Qiagen; #12362) stock of library DNA as per the manufacturer's recommended conditions.\n\n\n \n \nScreening of Phage Libraries Displaying Mutant CTLA-4 Polypeptides Having Improved Human CD80 and/or Human CD86 Binding Avidities\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGeneration of Phage Displaying Libraries of Mutant CTLA-4 Polypeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLibrary DNA (e.g., a library of DNA sequences encoding CTLA-4 ECD mutants) was transformed by electroporation into TG-1 \nE. coli \ncells (Stratagene; #200123) as per the manufacturer's recommended conditions. The culture was grown under phagemid-selection conditions (LB medium containing carbenicillin at 50 μg/ml) for 1-2 generations, infected with helper phage M13KO7 (at a multiplicity of infection level of 5-10), and incubated with shaking at 250 rpm overnight at 37° C. under dual selection for phagemid (carbenicillin at 50 μg/ml) and helper phage (kanamycin at 70 μg/ml). The cultures were clarified by centrifugation (6000 rpm, 15 min, 4° C. in a Sorvall 600TC rotor) and phage particles were precipitated by incubating 32 ml culture supernatant with 8 ml PEG/NaCl solution (20% PEG-8000; 2.5 M NaCl) on ice for 30 min followed by centrifugation (9500 rpm, 40 min, 4° C. in a Sorvall 600TC rotor). The phage pellet was suspended in 1 ml PBS containing 1% BSA (bovine serum albumin, Sigma; #A7906), transferred to a microfuge tube, and clarified by centrifugation (max speed, 5 min, RT in an Eppendorf table-top centrifuge).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPanning of CTLA-4 Mutant Phage Libraries.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPhage libraries were panned in up to five rounds against hCD80-Ig or hCD86-Ig fusion proteins using standard conditions. See, e.g., Lowman, et al., \nBiochemistry\n 12; 30(45):10832-10838 (1991); Smith, G. P. et al., Chem. Rev. 97:391-410 (1997). Each round of panning included: (a) binding of phage displaying mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptides to hCD80-Ig or hCD86-Ig ligands; (b) removal of unbound phage; (c) elution of bound phage; and (d) amplification of eluted phage for the next round of panning. An aliquot of phage from each round was transduced into \nE. coli \ncells to obtain individual transductant colonies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIdentification of CTLA-4 Mutants Having Improved Binding Avidities to Human CD80 and/or Human CD86 by Phage ELISA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIndividual colonies obtained from each round of panning were inoculated into 96-well culture plates (NUNC; #243656) containing 150 μl/well of 2×YT (yeast-tryptone) media containing 50 μg/ml carbenicillin and incubated at 250 rpm overnight at 37° C. The overnight cultures were used to inoculate deepwell blocks (Scienceware; #378600001) containing 600 μl/well of the same media. Cultures were incubated at 250 rpm for 2 hrs at 37° C., infected with M13K07 helper phage (multiplicity of infection (moi) 5-10) and then incubated at 250 rpm at overnight at 37° C. under dual selection for phagemid and helper phage markers (carbenicillin at 50 μg/ml and kanamycin at 70 μg/ml, respectively). Cultures were clarified by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 20 min at 4° C. in a Beckman GH 3.8 rotor. ELISA plates (NUNC; #449824) were coated by addition of 50 μl/well PBS containing 10 μg/ml hCD80-Ig or hCD86-Ig and incubated overnight at 4° C. Plates were washed three times with 200 μl/well PBST and blocked by addition of 200 μl/well PBS containing 3% non-fat dry milk and incubation at RT for 1 hour (hr). 25 μl/well of phage supernatants from the deepwell block was transferred to ELISA plates containing 25 μl/well 6% non-fat dry milk and plates were incubated for 1 hr at room temperature (RT). Plates were washed three times with 200 μl/well PBST and incubated with 50 μl/well HRP-conjugated anti-M13 monoclonal antibody (GE Healthcare, #27-9421-01) diluted 1:5000 in PBST containing 3% non-fat dry milk for 1 hr at RT. Plates were washed three times with 200 μl/well PBST and signal was detected using a TMB substrate kit (Pierce; #34021) according to manufacturer's recommended conditions. Mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptides exhibiting increased binding avidity to human CD80 and/or human CD86 (as measured by an increased avidity to hCD80-Ig and/or hCD86-Ig), compared to the binding avidity of human CTLA-4 to human CD80 and/or human CD86 (as measured by the binding avidity of human CTLA-4 ECD to hCD80-Ig and/or hCD86-Ig), were selected for further analysis.\n\n\n \nExample 3\n\n\nCreation of an IgG2 Fc Fusion Protein Vector\n\n\n \n \n \nA plasmid IgG2-Fc fusion protein expression vector was created to produce a fusion protein comprising a mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide of the invention and human IgG2 Fc polypeptide. DNA encoding the human IgG2 Fc polypeptide was generated by PCR amplification of human leukocyte cDNA (BD Biosciences, Cat. #HL4050AH) using forward primer (5′-AAGCTGTCACCGGTGGATCGATCCCGAACCCTGCCCTGAT TCTGATGAGCGCAAATGTTGTGTCGAGTGCCCACCGT-3′) (SEQ ID NO:189) and reverse primer (5′-CAGAATTCATTATTTACCCGGAGACAGGGAGAGGCT CTTCTG-3′) (SEQ ID NO:190). The primers were designed, made, and assembled using standard techniques well known by those of ordinary skill in the art and included stop and start codons and restriction sites as necessary. The PCR amplification procedures employed are also well known in the art. See, e.g., Berger, Ausubel, and Sambrook, all supra. 50-100 ng of cDNA was used as template in a 100 μl PCR reaction with 1 μM forward and reverse primers, Taq buffer (Stratagene; #200435) and 200 μM dNTPs for 25 amplification cycles (94° C., 30 s; 55° C., 30 s; 72° C., 60 s). The PCR product was purified by QiaQuick PCR Spin Columns (Qiagen #28106) as per the manufacturer's recommended conditions and digested with restriction enzymes AgeI and EcoRI. The PCR digestion fragment was separated by agarose-gel electrophoresis and purified using Qiaquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, #28704) as per the manufacturer's recommended conditions. A modified version of the pcDNA3.1-LEA vector (described above), which contains an AgeI restriction site in the CTLA-4 signal sequence (introduced as a silent mutation), may be digested with AgeI and EcoRI and ligated to the fragment mentioned above. The ligation is transformed into One-shot TOP10 \nE. coli \ncells (Invitrogen Cat. #C4040-03) as per the manufacturer's recommended conditions. Transformed cells are incubated in LB (Luria broth media) containing 50 μg/ml carbenicillin at 250 rpm overnight at 37° C. and then used to make a maxiprep (Qiagen; #12362) stock of plasmid DNA as per the manufacturer's recommended conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe resulting plasmid expression vector is designated as the pcDNA IgG2 Fc fusion protein expression vector. This vector is identical to the pcDNA mutant CTLA-4-IgG2 plasmid vector shown in \nFIG. 1\n except that the nucleic acid sequence encoding the mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide is removed. The nucleic acid sequence encoding the signal peptide in pcDNA IgG2 Fc fusion vector (which in \nFIG. 1\n can be any suitable signal peptide-encoding nucleotide sequence) is a nucleic acid encoding the human CTLA-4 signal peptide (SEQ ID NO:181 or SEQ ID NO:215). This IgG2 Fc fusion vector does not include any nucleic acid encoding a mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide of the invention or any other CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \nCloning of Nucleotide Sequences Encoding Mutant CTLA-4 Polypeptides into the IgG2 Fc Fusion Vector.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo produce mutant CTLA-4 polypeptides as soluble Fc fusion proteins, DNA sequences encoding mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptides identified as having improved binding avidities to human CD80 and/or human CD86 (as compared to the binding avidity of human CTLA-4-ECD to human CD80 and/or human CD86) from the phage library screening were each cloned into the IgG2 Fc fusion protein vector described above using, e.g., the following procedure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDNA sequences encoding mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptides exhibiting higher binding avidities to hCD80-Ig and/or hCD86-Ig were first recovered from the phage display vector by PCR amplification using forward and reverse primers designed based on sequence homology to a number of nucleotide residues (e.g., 30-60 nucleotides) at the N- and C-termini of the mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptides and standard procedures known in the art. See, e.g., procedures described in, e.g., Berger, Ausubel, and Sambrook, all supra. For example, in one exemplary aspect, DNA sequences encoding mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptides were recovered from the phage display vector by PCR amplification using forward primer (5′-GGAATACCGGTTTTTTGTAAAGCCATGCACGTCG CTCAACCAGCCGTCGTACTC-3′) (SEQ ID NO:191) and reverse primer (5′-GGCACTCAGATCTACGTCATCGATCCCGAA-3′) (SEQ ID NO:192). 10 nanograms (ng) of plasmid DNA (phage display vector containing a mutant CTLA-4 ECD-encoding nucleotide sequence) was used as template in a 100 μl PCR reaction with 1 μM forward and reverse primers described above, Taq buffer (Stratagene; #200435) and 200 μM dNTPs for 25 amplification cycles (94° C., 30 s; 55° C., 30 s; 72° C., 60 s). The PCR product was purified by QiaQuick PCR Spin Columns (Qiagen #28106) as per the manufacturer's recommended conditions and digested with restriction enzymes AgeI and ClaI. The fragments were separated by agarose-gel electrophoresis, purified using Qiaquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, #28704) as per the manufacturer's recommended conditions, and ligated into similarly digested plasmid IgG2 Fc Fusion vector. The ligation was transformed into One-shot TOP10 \nE. coli \ncells (Invitrogen Cat. #C4040-03) as per the manufacturer's recommended conditions. Transformed cells were incubated in LB (Luria broth media) containing 50 μg/ml carbenicillin at 250 rpm overnight at 37° C. and then used to make a maxiprep (Qiagen; #12362) stock of plasmid DNA as per the manufacturer's recommended conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe resulting plasmid expression vector, which comprises a nucleic acid encoding a mutant CTLA-4-IgG2 fusion protein of the invention, is designated as the pcDNA mutant CTLA-4 ECD IgG2 Fc plasmid expression vector. A schematic diagram of this vector is shown in \nFIG. 1\n. This vector includes a Bla promoter; ampicillin resistant gene; pUC origin; SV40 polyadenylation (poly A) signal sequence; f1 origin; SV40 promoter; neomycin resistance gene; CMV promoter to facilitate expression of a mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein of the invention (comprising, e.g., human CTLA-4 signal peptide, mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide, and human IgG2 Fc polypeptide); a nucleic acid sequence encoding a human CTLA-4 signal peptide (SEQ ID NO:181 or SEQ ID NO:215); a nucleic acid sequence encoding a mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide of the invention (including, but not limited to, e.g., a nucleotide sequence encoding any one of SEQ ID NOS:80-152); an exemplary nucleic acid sequence encoding a human IgG2 Fc polypeptide is shown in SEQ ID NO:183 or SEQ ID NO:217; and a bovine growth hormone (bGH) poly A termination signal sequence. The nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:183 encodes the hIgG2 Fc polypeptide with the C-terminal lysine (K) residue (SEQ ID NO:184); the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:217 encodes the hIgG2 Fc polypeptide without the C-terminal lysine residue (SEQ ID NO:218).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe plasmid IgG2 Fc fusion protein vector can also be used to produce a human CTLA-4-IgG2 (“hCTLA-4-Ig”) fusion protein. In this instance, a nucleic acid sequence encoding human CTLA-4 ECD (e.g., SEQ ID NO:193) is cloned into the plasmid IgG2 Fc fusion protein vector using standard cloning procedures similar to those described above in place of the nucleotide sequence encoding the mutant CTLA-4 ECD. The hCTLA-4-Ig fusion protein typically exists in solution as a dimeric fusion protein comprising two identical monomeric mature hCTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins. In this instance, each monomeric mature hCTLA-4-Ig fusion protein comprises a human CTLA-4 ECD (SEQ ID NO:159) fused at its C-terminus to the N-terminus of a human IgG2 Fc (SEQ ID NO:218 or SEQ ID NO:184). The two hCTLA-4-Ig monomers are covalently linked together by disulfide bonds formed between cysteine residues in each monomer, thereby forming the hCTLA-4-Ig fusion protein dimer. The mature hCTLA-4-Ig fusion protein dimer is the form of the fusion protein used in the assays described in these Examples, unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe have found experimentally that a human CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein or mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein made in CHO cells by transfecting an expression vector comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding the hCTLA-4-Ig or mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein and the hIgG2 Fc polypeptide shown in SEQ ID NO:184 does not typically include the predicted C-terminal lysine (K) residue, as determined by LCMS analysis; thus, the hIgG2 Fc polypeptide sequence of a hCTLA-4-IgG2 or a mutant CTLA-4-IgG2 is that shown in SEQ ID NO:218, which hIgG2 Fc polypeptide sequence does not typically include the C-terminal lysine residue as compared to the polypeptide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:184.\n\n\n \nTransient Transfection of COS Cells.\n\n\n \n \n \nCOS-7 cells were grown to 80-90% confluence in T-175 flasks containing 40 ml Growth Medium (DMEM/F12 medium (Invitrogen, Cat. #10565-018) supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone Cat. #SV30014.03) and 1×PSG (penicillin, streptomycin and glutamine) (Invitrogen, Cat. #10378-016)). Immediately prior to transfection of the cells with a plasmid expression vector, the medium was removed and replaced with 35 ml Expression Medium (OptiMem media (Gibco #51985) containing 1×PSG). Plasmid DNA (10 μg) (e.g., a pcDNA mutant CTLA-4 ECD IgG2 Fc expression vector encoding a mutant CTLA-4-IgG2 fusion protein of the invention) was mixed with FuGENE6 transfection reagent (Roche #11 815 075 001) in a 1:3 volume ratio and added to 1 ml of Growth Medium. This mixture was then added slowly to the T-175 flask and swirled gently to mix. After incubation at 37° C. for 3 days, the media was harvested, fresh Expression Medium was added, and the cultures were incubated for an additional 3 d.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA similar procedure can be used to make COS-7 cells transfected with a similar plasmid vector encoding human CTLA-4-IgG2 or a pcDNA3.1-LEA plasmid vector encoding LEA29Y-Ig.\n\n\n \nPurification of Proteins.\n\n\n \n \n \nSupernatants from transfection cultures (e.g., comprising cells transfected with a pcDNA mutant CTLA-4 ECD IgG2 Fc vector encoding mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein) were clarified by centrifugation at 1000×g for 10 min at RT and filtration through 0.2 μm membranes (Nalgene, VWR #73520-982). Proteins were purified by Protein-A affinity chromatography using an AKTA Explorer HPLC system (GE Healthcare). A mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein was bound to Hitrap Protein A FF columns (GE Healthcare, #17-5079-01) in PBS buffer, washed with the same buffer, eluted with 100 mM citric acid buffer (pH 4.0), and then neutralized by addition of 1/10 volume of 2M Tris base. The buffer in the protein solution was finally exchanged to PBS by dialysis using 10 kDa MWCO membranes (Pierce, Cat. #PI66810).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA similar procedure can be used to purify human CTLA-4-IgG2 or LEA29Y-Ig fusion proteins.\n\n\n \nEvaluation of Protein Quality.\n\n\n \n \n \nSDS/PAGE Analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe apparent molecular weight (MW) of a purified mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein of the invention was measured by SDS/PAGE analysis under non-reducing conditions. Under non-reducing conditions, a mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein of the invention typically exists as a dimeric fusion protein comprising two monomeric mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins. In one aspect, the dimer is a homodimer comprising two identical mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein monomers. In one aspect, each CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein monomer comprises a mature/secreted mutant CTLA-4 ECD fused at its C-terminus to the N-terminus of a human IgG2 Fc polypeptide. The two mutant CTLA-4-Ig monomers are covalently linked together by disulfide bonds formed between cysteine residues in each monomer. The homodimer is the form of the mutant fusion protein molecule of the invention typically described in these Examples, unless explicitly stated otherwise. The data shown in these Examples pertain to mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein homodimers, unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSDS/PAGE analyses were performed as follows. 2 μg of purified protein was added to 20 μl LDS Sample Buffer (Invitrogen #NP0007) and run through NuPAGE 4-12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen #NP0321BOX) in 1×MES sodium docecyl sulfate (SDS)/PAGE running buffer (Invitrogen #NP0002) following the manufacturer's recommended conditions. Gels were stained by incubation in 50 ml SimplyBlue SafeStain (Invitrogen #LC6060) for 1 hr with gentle agitation at RT. Gels were de-stained by two incubations with 200 ml water for 1 hr with gentle agitation at RT and processed in drying buffer (Bio RAD 161-0752) according to the manufacturer's recommended conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA representative SDS/PAGE gel of two exemplary mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein homodimers of the invention (designated as clones D3 and D4) and the Orencia® fusion protein, which serves as a comparative control, is presented in \nFIG. 3\n. The D3-Ig fusion protein dimer comprises two identical D3-Ig fusion protein monomers that are covalently linked by disulfide bonds formed between cysteine residues in each D3-Ig monomer. Each D3-Ig monomer comprises a mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide (named “D3”) comprising the polypeptide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:61 fused directly (i.e., with no “linker” amino acid residue(s)) at its C-terminus to the N-terminus of the hIgG2 Fc polypeptide shown in SEQ ID NO:218. The D4-Ig fusion protein dimer similarly comprises two identical D4-Ig monomers that are covalently linked by disulfide bonds formed between cysteine residues in each D3-Ig monomer. Each monomeric D4-IgG2 fusion protein comprises a mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide (named “D4”) comprising the polypeptide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:62 fused directly (i.e., with no “linker” amino acid residue(s)) at its C-terminus to the N-terminus of the hIgG2 Fc polypeptide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:218.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs explained above, we have found experimentally that a mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein made in CHO cells using a vector comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding the predicted hIgG2 Fc polypeptide shown in SEQ ID NO:184 does not typically include the predicted C-terminal lysine (K) residue, as determined by LCMS analysis; thus, the hIgG2 Fc polypeptide sequence of a mutant CTLA-4-IgG2 described herein is that shown in SEQ ID NO:218, which hIgG2 Fc polypeptide sequence does not typically include the C-terminal lysine residue, as compared to the polypeptide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:184.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSDS/PAGE analyses were performed on all protein preparations to verify protein quality in terms of apparent molecular weight, protein concentration, and purity. The results of the SDS/PAGE analyses were similar for all protein preparations. From the exemplary gel results shown in \nFIG. 3\n, purified D3-IgG2 and D4-IgG2 fusion protein dimers have an apparent MW of approximately 80 kDa, which is consistent with the predicted MW of the exemplary homodimeric mutant CTLA-4-IgG2 fusion protein structure depicted in \nFIG. 10\n (predicted MW=78-79 kDa). (Purified mutant CTLA-4-IgG2 protein monomers typically have apparent MWs of 39-40 kDa.) The protein bands in the gel shown in \nFIG. 3\n have been stained with equivalent intensities; this confirms the accuracy of measuring protein concentration for different samples. As for protein purity, a lower MW band can be observed in \nFIG. 3\n at an apparent MW of approximately 44 kDa, which is consistent with the predicted MW of a monomeric IgG2 fusion protein. The relative intensity of this lower MW band is consistently low and is estimated to be less than 5% of the total protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalogous SDS/PAGE analyses can be used to evaluate the purity of human CTLA-4-IgG2 or LEA29Y-Ig fusion proteins produced using methods similar to those describe above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEndotoxin Analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEndotoxin levels of mutant CTLA-4 fusion proteins were measured using a QCL-1000 limulus amoebocyte lysate assay kit (Cambrex #50-648U) following the manufacturers recommended conditions. The maximum endotoxin level for proteins used in cell-based assays was set at 10 endotoxin units (EU)/mg protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalogous analyses can be used to measure the endotoxin levels of human CTLA-4-IgG2 or LEA29Y-Ig protein preparations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSize Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) Analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProtein aggregation levels (including aggregation levels of mutant CTLA-4 polypeptides and control polypeptides) were measured by size exclusion chromatography using a Dionex BioLC system (Dionex). Protein (5 μg) was run through a Tosoh G3000Wx1 column (Tosoh Bioscience) in PBS running buffer using a 20 min isocratic run and detection by absorbance (A) at 214 nanometers (nm). The maximum level of aggregation for protein used in further assays was set at 10%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSEC analysis was performed on all protein preparations to verify protein quality in terms of protein aggregation levels. The results were similar for all protein preparations and a representative elution profile from an SEC analysis of a mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein dimer (D3-Ig) is shown in \nFIG. 4\n. The y-axis shows milliAbsorbance units (mAU); the x-axis shows elution time in minutes. The structure of the D3-Ig dimer is explained above in the “SDS/PAGE Analyses” section. This purified mutant CTLA-4-Ig dimer is largely homogeneous in size and does not contain high levels of aggregated species. Other mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins of the invention were similarly analyzed and showed similar results (data not shown). Purified mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins of the invention were found to be homogenous in size and did not contain high levels (>10%) of aggregated proteins. It is important to verify the aggregation states of the purified mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins of the invention because highly aggregated mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins may bind with higher avidity to human CD80 and/or human CD86 molecules and thus may exhibit higher biological activity.\n\n\n \nExample 4\n\n\nMeasuring Binding Avidities of Mutant CTLA-4-Ig Fusion Proteins to Human CD80-Murine Ig (hCD80-mIg) and Human CD86-Murine Ig (hCD86-mIg) Fusion Proteins Using Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)\n\n\nBiacore™ Analysis\n\n\n \n \n \nThis example describes a procedure for screening mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins for improved binding avidity to hCD80-mIg and/or hCD86-mIg ligands using a Biacore interaction analysis. In the nomenclature used to describe this type of analysis, the immobilized binding partner is referred to as the “ligand”, and the binding partner in the mobile phase is referred to as the “analyte”. Fusion proteins containing an Ig domain typically form dimeric structures in solution by virtue of strong association between two Ig domains. Unless indicated otherwise, such dimeric conformations are expected to exist for the fusion proteins described in this Example (i.e., mutant CTLA-4-Ig, Orencia® fusion protein, LEA29Y-Ig, hCD80-mIg, and hCD86-mIg). The term “avidity” typically relates to the strength of binding between dimeric analytes (e.g., mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins) and dimeric ligands (e.g., hCD80-mIg or hCD86-mIg fusion proteins). The increases in binding avidity described for mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins result from increases in binding affinity between each CTLA-4 ECD domain and its corresponding ligand. The strength of binding avidity is typically described in terms of the equilibrium dissociation constant (K\nD\n), which describes the molar concentration of analyte at which 50% of available ligand is bound at equilibrium.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn this screening method, Biacore sensor chips were derivatized with hCD80-mIg or hCD86-mIg ligands and mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins in buffer were allowed to flow over the ligand-coated sensor chips. The ability of a mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein molecule to bind to a specific binding partner (i.e., hCD80-mIg or hCD86-mIg) was evaluated. Control fusion proteins (i.e., human CTLA-4-IgG2 fusion protein, Orencia® fusion protein, and mutant LEA29Y-Ig fusion protein) were also allowed to flow over the ligand-coated sensor chips and the abilities of these molecules to bind to hCD80-mIg or hCD86-mIg were similarly evaluated for comparison. Using the Biacore system, the association (k\non\n) and dissociation (k\noff\n) rate constant of a protein of interest binding to hCD80-mIg or hCD86-mIg ligands can be evaluated and used to calculate the equilibrium dissociation constant, K\nD\n. The human CTLA-4-IgG2 fusion protein, which comprises the WT human CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide fused to the human IgG2 polypeptide, can serve as a wild-type human CTLA-4-Ig “control”. In addition or alternatively, because the Orencia® fusion protein is composed of the WT human CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide fused to a modified IgG1 Fc polypeptide, it also effectively serves as a wild-type human CTLA-4-Ig control for comparative purposes. Mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins having increased binding avidities for hCD80-mIg and/or hCD86-mIg, compared to human CTLA-4-IgG2, Orencia® fusion protein, and/or LEA29Y-Ig, were identified. As discussed in greater detail below, the increased binding avidity of a mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein of the invention for hCD80-mIg and/or hCD86-mIg, as compared to the binding avidity of Orencia® fusion protein (i.e., hCTLA-4-IgG1) and/or LEA29Y-Ig for hCD80-mIg and/or hCD86-mIg, was not due to differences between IgG2 present in the mutant CTLA-4-Ig molecules and the mutant IgG1 present in the Orencia® or LEA29Y-Ig molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll Biacore™ analyses were performed on a Biacore™ 2000 system (GE Healthcare) at room temperature (RT, 25° C.). HBS-EP buffer (10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20) was used as the flow buffer for all experiments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStandard Kinetic Assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe standard kinetic assay measures binding kinetics of dimeric ligand (e.g., hCD80-mIg fusion protein or hCD86-mIg fusion protein) coated to sensor chips and dimeric analytes (e.g., mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins of the invention) in the mobile phase. Rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody (GE Healthcare, #BR-1005-14) was immobilized on CM5 sensor chips (GE Healthcare, #BR-1000-14) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Antibody was diluted to 30 μg/ml in immobilization buffer (10 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.0 (BR-1003-51)). At a flow rate of 5 μl/minute, sensor chip CM5 was activated with a 35 μl injection of a mixture of 1-Ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) (made by mixing equal volumes of 11.5 mg/ml EDC and 75 mg/ml NHS) (GE Healthcare, #BR-1000-50), followed by a 35 μl injection of undiluted antibody. Un-reacted sites were quenched with 35 μl of 1M ethanolamine-HCL, pH 8.5 (GE Healthcare, #BR-1000-50). This procedure typically yielded 15,000 response units (RU) of coupled antibody. CTLA-4 ligands human CD80-murine Ig (hCD80-mIg) (Ancell, #510-820) or human CD86-murine Ig (hCD86-mIg) (Ancell, #509-820) were bound to antibody-coated sensor chips by injection of 10 μl or 16 μl, respectively, ligand solution (2 μg/ml protein in HBS-EP buffer [10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P-20, GE Healthcare, #BR-1001-88]) at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. Ligand capture levels were typically 135-170 RU. Mutant CTLA-4-Ig proteins (or were diluted in HBS-EP buffer and flowed over ligand-coated sensor chips for 2 min at 30 μl/min, followed by 5 min incubation with HBS-EP buffer containing no protein at the same flow rate. For mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins having very slow dissociation rates from hCD86-mIg, kinetic assays were also conducted using longer dissociation times (e.g., 20 min). Rmax signal levels for mutant CTLA-4-Ig proteins ranged from approximately 70-100 RU. Regeneration between cycles was performed by 3 min incubation with 10 mM glycine buffer (pH 1.7) at 50 μl/min. New chips were subjected to 4-5 cycles of capture/binding/regeneration prior to use in actual experiments. Data from a reference cell containing rabbit anti-mouse IgG capture antibody alone was subtracted from data obtained from flow cells containing captured hCD80-mIg or hCD86-mIg. Typically, 8 dilutions of mutant CTLA-4-Ig proteins ranging from 500 nM to 0.2 nM were analyzed against a blank reference (HBS-EP buffer alone).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSensorgram traces from a typical Biacore analysis are shown in \nFIG. 5\n. This figure shows the response (RU) over time (in seconds (s)) generated by the binding of the following three fusion proteins to the hCD86-mIg fusion protein: (1) Orencia® fusion protein (serving as a control and for comparison) (Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.; see, e.g., Larson C. P. et al., Am. J. Trans. 5:443-453 (2005)); (2) LEA29Y-Ig fusion protein (for comparison); and (3) an exemplary mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein of the invention designated “clone D3” (also termed D3-IgG2). The D3-IgG2 fusion protein comprises two identical monomeric fusion proteins that are covalently linked together by one or more disulfide bonds formed between cysteine residues in each monomer. See the discussion in the “SDS/PAGE Analyses” section above. Each monomeric fusion protein comprises a mature mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide shown in SEQ ID NO:159 covalently fused at its C-terminus to the N-terminus of the human IgG2 polypeptide shown in EQ ID NO:184 or 218. Other dimeric fusion proteins of the invention may comprise structures similar to that of the dimeric D3-IgG2 fusion protein—except that the D3 mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide of each monomeric fusion protein is replaced by a different mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe association phase reflects the binding between the analyte of interest and the ligand of interest. In \nFIG. 5\n, the association phase for each analyte is represented by the curve at times prior to the time marked by the arrow and is characterized by the binding of analyte (D3-IgG2, Orencia® fusion protein, or LEA29Y-Ig) to the hCD86-mIg ligand. The rate at which an analyte associates with the hCD86-mIg ligand is reflected in the curve—see, e.g., the sharp rate of increase in the response units beginning at about 510 seconds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dissociation phase of the analysis begins at the time marked by the arrow in \nFIG. 5\n. During the dissociation phase, the analyte and ligand dissociate from their bound conformation. In \nFIG. 5\n, the rate at which an analyte dissociates from the hCD86-mIg ligand is represented by the decrease in response units (rate of decrease of the response units over time). Based on these data, the relative dissociation rate constant (“off” rates, k\noff \nor k\nd\n) and association rate constants (“on” rates, k\non \nor k\na\n) can be determined. The total avidity of the interaction can be described by the K\nD\n, (k\noff\n)/(k\non\n). Increased binding avidities are often manifested in slower dissociation rates. If the slower dissociation rate is accompanied by an equal, higher, or marginally slower association rate, such that the calculated equilibrium dissociation constant K\nD \nis lower, the avidity will be greater. In this case, a mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein that has a binding avidity for the hCD86-mIg ligand that is greater than the binding avidity of the Orencia® fusion protein for the same ligand will also have a slower dissociation rate from the ligand than the Orencia® protein. A mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein that has a binding avidity for the hCD86-mIg ligand that is greater than the binding avidity of LEA29Y-Ig for the same ligand will also have a slower dissociation rate from the ligand than LEA29Y-Ig.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 5\n shows that the dissociation rate of LEA29Y-Ig from the hCD86-mIg ligand is significantly slower than the dissociation rate of the Orencia® protein from the same ligand. LEA29Y-Ig also has an association rate for binding to hCD86-mIg similar to that observed for the Orencia® fusion protein. Thus, LEA29Y-Ig has a higher avidity for hCD86-mIg than does the Orencia® protein. This finding is consistent with previous studies describing LEA29Y-Ig as having a higher binding avidity for the hCD86-mIg ligand than the Orencia® fusion protein (Larson C. P. et al., Am. J. Trans. 5:443-453 (2005)). \nFIG. 5\n also shows that the mutant D3-IgG2 fusion protein of the invention has a slower dissociation rate from the hCD86-mIg ligand than either the Orencia® or LEA29Y-Ig fusion protein. The D3-IgG2 fusion protein also has a similar (but somewhat faster) association rate for binding to hCD86-mIg ligand compared to the association rates of either the Orencia® or LEA29Y-Ig fusion proteins for hCD86-mIg ligand. Thus, the D3-IgG2 fusion protein exhibits a higher binding avidity for the hCD86-mIg ligand than either the Orencia® or LEA29Y-Ig fusion protein. Therefore, the D3-IgG2 fusion protein is expected to bind to native CD86, including, e.g., CD86 as expressed in vivo on APCs in mammals, such as humans, with higher binding avidity. This view is further supported by the functional cell-based assays discussed in the Examples below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBiacore analyses were performed using other mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins of the invention. In addition, Biacore analyses were performed using hCD80-mIg-coated sensor chips and mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins of the invention. The dissociation rates and binding avidities of these mutant molecules were determined and compared to the dissociation rates and binding avidities of the Orencia® and LEA29Y-Ig fusion proteins. Representative results are shown in Tables 3 and 4 and discussed in greater detail below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStandard Biacore Data Analyses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter deletion of the regeneration and capture portions of the sensorgrams, curves were zeroed to a 5 s average of all curves approximately 10 s prior to sample injection. A blank curve was subtracted from each test curve. Data were analyzed by BIAevaluation software (v4.1, available from GE Healthcare) using the “Fit kinetics, Simultaneous k\na\n/k\nd\n” function. The injection start time was defined as a time prior to the association phase where all curves were close to zero. Data selection for the association phase began approximately 10 s after the injection start time and ended approximately 10 s prior to the injection stop time. The injection stop time was defined as a time prior to the appearance of any signal spikes associated with the dissociation phase. The dissociation phase was selected to start 10 s after the injection stop time and included 280-295 s of the 5 min dissociation phase. The 1:1 Langmuir model describes the reaction A+B<=>AB. This model represents a single ligand binding to a single protein of interest (e.g., receptor). The 1:1 Langmuir model from the BIAevaluation software was used to determine the association rate constant (k\na\n) and the dissociation rate constant (k\nd\n) and to calculate the equilibrium dissociation constant, K\nD\n. K\nD\n=k\nd\n/k\na\n. K\nD\n=([A]·[B])/[AB]. The equilibrium dissociation constant, K\nD\n, is equal to the inverse of the equilibrium association constant, K\nA\n. K\nD\n=1/K\nA\n. The rate equations for the reaction (analyte A plus ligand B yielding complex AB), where A=analyte injected, B=free ligand, and t=time, are: d[B]/dt=−(k\na\n[A][B]−k\nd\n[AB]) and d[AB]/dt=k\na\n[A][B]−k\nd\n[AB]. Substituting R, Biacore response units (RU) at a given time, for [AB], Rmax−R for [B], and C (analyte concentration) for [A], the net rate expression in Biacore units is dR/dt=k\na\nC(Rmax−R)−k\nd\nR, where R at t0=0, B[0]=Rmax, and AB[0]=0 RU, with the total response=[AB]+RI. The bulk shift (RI) was set to zero, and Rmax, k\na \nand k\nd \nwere fit globally for all curves.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe standard kinetic assays and data analyses described above were performed on protein preparations of mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein of the invention, as well as LEA29Y-Ig and Orencia® fusion proteins. Tables 3 and 4 summarize the binding data for representative mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTable 3 presents binding avidities of representative mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins to hCD86-mIg, as measured by the standard Biacore assay described above. Specifically, Table 3 shows the name of each mutant CTLA-4Ig fusion protein; the sequence identification number (SEQ ID NO) corresponding to the polypeptide sequence of the monomeric mutant CTLA-4 ECD fusion protein; the equilibrium dissociation constant (K\nD \n(Molar (M)) determined based on the binding avidity of the mutant protein to the hCD86-mIg; and the binding avidity of each mutant CTLA-4-Ig to the hCD86-mIg relative to the binding avidity of the Orencia® fusion protein to the hCD86-mIg. This relative binding avidity (shown in the far-right column) is shown as a fold improvement in binding avidity of the mutant fusion protein to the hCD86-mIg compared to the binding avidity of the Orencia® fusion protein to the hCD86-mIg. Each mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein of the invention in Table 3 typically exists in solution as a dimeric fusion protein comprising two identical monomeric fusion proteins, wherein each monomeric protein comprises a mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide (e.g., named D1, D1T, D2, D3, D4, etc.) fused directly at its C-terminus to the N-terminus of an IgG2 Fc polypeptide comprising the sequence of SEQ ID NO:184 or 218. Each such dimeric mutant CTLA-4-Ig can be made by using standard techniques known in the art. Alternatively, each such dimeric mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein dimer can be made by using methods set forth in Example 3 above. Briefly, a nucleic acid sequence encoding a particular mutant CTLA-4 ECD identified in Table 3 (e.g., a nucleic acid sequence encoding a mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide sequence identified in Table 3) can be cloned into the IgG2 Fc fusion vector, mammalian cells can be transfected with the vector, and the resultant fusion protein can be expressed, purified, and evaluated as described in Example 3. An exemplary nucleic acid sequence for each mutant CTLA-4 ECD is presented in the Sequence Listing included herewith. The Orencia® fusion protein, which comprises two monomeric fusion proteins, each monomeric fusion protein comprising a wild-type human CTLA-4 ECD fused to a modified IgG1 Fc, serves as the reference, i.e., with the binding avidity to hCD86-mIg set to 1. The K\nD \nvalues for LEA29Y-Ig fusion protein and the human CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein are also shown. In addition, the fold improvement in hCD86-mIg binding avidity of the LEA29Y-Ig compared to the hCD86-mIg binding avidity of the Orencia® protein is also shown. The binding avidities of the CTLA-4-IgG2 and Orencia® fusion proteins for hCD86-mIg are approximately equal, confirming that the differences between the human IgG2 polypeptide present in human CTLA-4-IgG2 and the modified IgG1 present in the Orencia® protein contribute little, if at all, to the respective hCD86-mIg binding affinities of these molecules. As is discussed in greater detail in Example 5 below, we have confirmed that the differences in immunosuppressive functional activities between mutant CTLA-4-Ig polypeptides of the invention and the Orencia® protein (or LEA29Y-Ig) cannot be attributed to their respective Ig Fc regions comprising different IgG isotypes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in Table 3, representative mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins of the invention have hCD86-mIg binding avidities that are: (1) at least about equal to or greater than the binding avidity of human CTLA-4-IgG2 (“hCTLA-4-IgG2”) (which comprises two covalently linked monomeric fusion proteins, each such monomeric protein comprising the human CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide fused to an IgG2 Fc polypeptide); (2) at least about equal to or greater than the binding avidity of the Orencia® protein to the hCD86-mIg ligand; and/or (3) at least about equal to or greater than the binding avidity of the LEA29Y-Ig to the hCD86-mIg ligand. The fold improvement in binding avidity to the hCD86-mIg ligand relative to the binding avidity of the Orencia® protein to hCD86-mIg is indicated for each CTLA-4-Ig mutant (4\nth \ncolumn in Table 3).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA majority of mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins were found to have a rate of dissociation from hCD86-mIg fusion protein that is slower than the rate of dissociation of the Orencia® fusion protein from hCD86-mIg (data not shown). A number of the mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins were found to have a rate of association to hCD86-mIg greater than the rate of association of Orencia® fusion protein to the same ligand (data not shown).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll of the mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins shown in Table 3 had hCD86-mIg equilibrium dissociation constants (K\nD\n) that were lower than the hCD86-mIg equilibrium dissociation constant of human CTLA-4-IgG2 or Orencia® fusion protein. Furthermore, most of the mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins shown in Table 3 had hCD86-mIg equilibrium dissociation constants that were lower than hCD86-mIg equilibrium constant of LEA29Y-Ig.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll of the mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins shown in Table 3 had binding avidities for hCD86-mIg that are greater than the binding avidities of the human CTLA-4-IgG2 or Orencia® fusion protein for hCD86-mIg (the calculated fold improvement in hCD86-mIg binding avidity relative to the Orencia® fusion protein is shown the 4\nth \ncolumn of Table 3). Moreover, many of the mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins shown in Table 3 had binding avidities for hCD86-mIg that are greater than the binding avidity of LEA29Y-Ig for hCD86-mIg (4\nth \ncolumn of Table 3).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA mutant CTLA-4-Ig of the invention that has a higher binding avidity to the hCD86-mIg ligand than does the Orencia® or LEA29Y-Ig fusion protein will likely have an increased in vivo immunosuppressive potency compared to the hCTLA-4-IgG2, Orencia®, or LEA29Y-Ig fusion protein, respectively, such as in, e.g., therapeutic and/or prophylactic methods for suppressing an immune response in a subject (e.g., in the in vivo treatment of immune system diseases or disorders of mammals, such as e.g., humans, in which immunoinhibition or immunosuppression is desirable), methods for inhibiting rejection of a tissue or organ transplant from a donor by a recipient (e.g., by a mammal, such as, e.g., a human), and other methods described elsewhere herein.\n\n\n \n

Orencia ®, and LEA29Y-Ig fusion proteins are those of the polypeptide sequences of these Ig fusion proteins, respectively. The SEQ ID NO shown in Table 3 for each mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein identifies the polypeptide sequence of the mutant CTLA-4 ECD of the identified mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein. The data pertain to a mutant CTLA-4-Ig comprising a mutant CTLA-4 ECD (e.g., any of SEQ ID NOS: 1-48 and 58-73) fused at its N-terminus to the C-terminus of the IgG2 Fc polypeptide shown in SEQ ID NO: 184 or 218. Methods for making such fusion proteins are known in the art and are described herein. However, as noted above, we have found experimentally that a mutant CTLA-4-Ig made in CHO cells using a vector comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding the predicted hIgG2 Fc polypeptide shown in SEQ ID NO: 184 does not typically include the predicted C-terminal lysine (K) residue; thus, the hgG2 Fc polypeptide sequence of a mutant CTLA-4-IgG2 is that shown in SEQ ID NO: 218, which hIgG2 Fc polypeptide sequence does not include the C-terminal lysine residue as compared to the sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 184. Exemplary fusion protein sequences which do not include the C-terminal lysine residue are shown in SEQ ID NOS: 205-214, 219, and 221.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTable 4 presents binding avidities of mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins to hCD80-mIg, as measured by the standard Biacore assay. Specifically, Table 4 shows the clone name of a mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein; the sequence identification number (SEQ ID NO) corresponding to the polypeptide sequence of the monomeric mutant CTLA-4 ECD fusion protein; the equilibrium dissociation constant (K\nD \n(Molar (M)) for the hCD80-mIg ligand binding avidity assay; and the binding avidity of the mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein to the hCD80-mIg ligand relative to the binding avidity of the Orencia® fusion protein to the same ligand. For each mutant protein, the fold improvement in binding avidity to the hCD80-mIg ligand compared to the binding avidity of the Orencia® fusion protein to the hCD80-mIg ligand is shown (4\nth \ncolumn in Table 4). The Orencia® fusion protein serves as the reference, i.e., with the binding avidity to hCD80-mIg set to 1. The mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins typically exist as dimeric fusion proteins in solution. As shown in Table 4, dimeric mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins of the invention have binding avidities to the hCD80-mIg ligand that are: (1) at least about equal to or greater than the binding avidity of human CTLA-4-IgG2; (2) at least about equal to or greater than the binding avidity of the Orencia® fusion protein to the hCD80-mIg ligand; and/or (3) at least about equal to or greater than the binding avidity of the LEA29Y-Ig to the hCD80-mIg ligand. As discussed above, each dimeric mutant CTLA-4-Ig dimer can be made by using methods set forth in Example 3 above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA number of mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins were found to have a rate of dissociation from hCD80-mIg fusion protein that is about equal to or greater than the rate of dissociation of the Orencia® fusion protein from the same ligand (data not shown). Some mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins were found to have a rate of association to hCD80-mIg about equal to or greater than the rate of association of Orencia® fusion protein to the same ligand (data not shown).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMany mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins shown in Table 4 had hCD80-mIg equilibrium dissociation constants (K\nD\n) that were lower than the hCD80-mIg equilibrium dissociation constant of human CTLA-4-IgG2 or Orencia® fusion protein. Furthermore, several mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins shown in Table 4 had hCD80-mIg equilibrium dissociation constants that were at least about equal to the hCD80-mIg equilibrium constant of LEA29Y-Ig.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMany mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins shown in Table 4 had binding avidities for hCD80-mIg that are greater than the binding avidities of human CTLA-4-IgG2 or Orencia® fusion protein for the same ligand (fold improvement in hCD80-mIg binding avidity relative to the Orencia® fusion protein is shown the 4\nth \ncolumn). Additionally, several mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins shown in Table 4 had binding avidities for hCD80-mIg that are at least about equal to the binding avidity of LEA29Y-Ig for the same ligand.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA mutant CTLA-4-Ig of the invention that has a higher binding avidity to the hCD80-mIg than does the hCTLA-4-IgG1, Orencia®, or LEA29Y-Ig fusion protein will likely have an increased in vivo immunosuppressive potency compared to the hCTLA-4-IgG2, Orencia®, or LEA29Y-Ig fusion protein, respectively, such as in, e.g., therapeutic and/or prophylactic methods for suppressing an immune response in a subject (e.g., in the in vivo treatment of immune system diseases or disorders of mammals, such as e.g., humans, in which immunoinhibition or immunosuppression is desirable), methods for inhibiting rejection of a tissue or organ transplant from a donor by a recipient (e.g., by a mammal, such as, e.g., a human), and other methods described elsewhere herein.\n\n\n \n

SEQ ID NOS shown in Table 4 for human CTLA-4-IgG2, Orencia ®, and LEA29Y-Ig fusion proteins are those of the polypeptide sequences of these fusion proteins, respectively. The SEQ ID NO shown in Table 4 for each mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein identifies the polypeptide sequence of the mutant CTLA-4 ECD of the identified mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein. The data pertain to a mutant CTLA-4-Ig comprising a mutant CTLA-4 ECD (e.g., any of SEQ ID NOS: 1-48 and 58-73) fused at its N-terminus to the C-terminus of the IgG2 Fc polypeptide shown in SEQ ID NO: 184 or 218. However, we have found experimentally by LCMS analysis that a mutant CTLA-4-Ig made in CHO cells using a vector comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding the predicted hIgG2 Fc polypeptide shown in SEQ ID NO: 184 does not typically include the predicted C-terminal lysine (K) residue; thus, the hIgG2 Fc polypeptide sequence of a mutant CTLA-4-IgG2 is that shown in SEQ ID NO: 218, which hIgG2 Fc polypeptide sequence does not typically include the C-terminal lysine residue as compared to the sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 184. Exemplary fusion protein sequences that do not include the C-terminal lysine residue are shown in SEQ ID NOS: 205-214, 219, and 221.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMonomeric Kinetic Assays.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther confirmation of binding properties of mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins was obtained by monovalent kinetic binding assays. These assays measure the binding kinetics of a bivalent test protein (e.g., a dimeric mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein) coated to sensor chips and monovalent ligand (papain-digested hCD86-mIg) in the mobile phase. Goat anti-human IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, #109-005-098) was coupled to CM5 sensor chips according to the manufacturer's protocols, typically yielding 15,000 response units (RU). Ligand was captured by incubation of antibody-coated sensor chips with 10 μl of a 2 μg/ml solution of dimeric mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins in HBS-EP buffer at a flow rate of 10 μl/min, Ligand capture levels were typically 25-80 RU. Monomeric hCD86-mIg ligands (created by papain digestion and protein-A sepharose adsorption of hCD86-mIg, as described in Hermanson, G. T. B\nIOCONJUGATE \nT\nECHNIQUES\n, Academic Press, 1996) were diluted in HBS-EP buffer and flowed through test protein-coated sensor chips for 2 min at 30 μl/min, followed by 2 min incubation with HBS-EP buffer containing no protein at the same flow rate. Regeneration between cycles was performed by 3 min incubation with 10 mM glycine buffer (pH 1.7) at 30 μl/min. Typically, 8 dilutions of monomeric analyte proteins ranging from 3000 nM to 0.2 nM were analyzed against a blank reference (HBS-EP buffer alone) in duplicate. Rmax signal levels for binding to mutant CTLA-4-Ig proteins ranged from 10-60 RU.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor kinetic analysis, data from monomeric binding assays were selected as described above except that association data selection began and ended 5 s from the injection start and stop times, and dissociation data selection started 5 s after the injection stop time, and typically included 1-60 s of the dissociation period. Such data were also analyzed for steady state equilibrium affinities using the BIAevaluation software. Steady state binding levels for each concentration (Response\neq \n(“Req”) values) were averaged over 5-20 s range near the end of the sample injection using the BIAevaluation “General fit: average” function. Steady state affinity was determined from the Req vs. concentration plot using the BIAevaluation software according to the formula Req=K\nA\n×C×Rmax/(K\nA\n×C×n+1), where C is the analyte concentration and n, the steric interference factor, is 1, and K\nD\n=1/K\nA\n. In some cases, substantial non-specific binding, represented by a residual flat R-value trace after dissociation, was observed. Such data were corrected by subtracting the residual R-values from the Req values. The K\nD \nwas then calculated in GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, Inc.) using the “one site-specific binding” model.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis monomeric binding assay was performed on a subset of representative mutant CTLA-4-Ig proteins and the results are summarized in Table 5. Overall, the degree of improvement in hCD86 ECD binding to mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins relative to LEA29Y-Ig observed in the monomeric binding assays was similar to that observed for hCD86-mIg binding to mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins relative to LEA29Y-Ig in the standard kinetic assays. Such results support the conclusion that the observed improvements in binding kinetics for the mutant proteins are due to real improvements in binding affinities of the mutant proteins (e.g., compared to Orencia® and/or LEA29Y-Ig fusion proteins) and are not due to potential artifacts caused by higher valency of aggregated protein preparations.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nBinding Affinity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nfor Monomeric\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFusion\n\n\nSEQ ID NO*\n\n\nMonomeric\n\n\nhCD86 ECD\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtein\n\n\n(e.g., of mutant\n\n\nhCD86 ECD\n\n\n(Relative to\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(dimer)\n\n\nCTLA-4 ECD)\n\n\nK\nD \n(M)\n\n\nLEA29Y-Ig)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEA29Y-Ig\n\n\n166\n\n\n 1.68 × 10\n−6\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-\nIgG2\n \n\n\n61\n\n\n<3.36 × 10\n−7\n \n\n\n>5x\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-4-\nIgG2\n \n\n\n4\n\n\n<3.36 × 10\n−7\n \n\n\n>5x\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-11-\nIgG2\n \n\n\n10\n\n\n<3.36 × 10\n−7\n \n\n\n>5x\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-12-IgG2\n\n\n11\n\n\n<3.36 × 10\n−7\n \n\n\n>5x\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-14-\nIgG2\n \n\n\n12\n\n\n<3.36 × 10\n−7\n \n\n\n>5x\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-17-IgG2\n\n\n15\n\n\n<3.36 × 10\n−7\n \n\n\n>5x\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-20-IgG2\n\n\n17\n\n\n8.4 × 10\n−7\n-3.36 × 10\n−7\n \n\n\n2x-5x\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-27-\nIgG2\n \n\n\n24\n\n\n8.4 × 10\n−7\n-3.36 × 10\n−7\n \n\n\n2x-5x\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-29-IgG2\n\n\n26\n\n\n<3.36 × 10\n−7\n \n\n\n>5x\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-31-\nIgG2\n \n\n\n28\n\n\n<3.36 × 10\n−7\n \n\n\n>5x\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-53-IgG2\n\n\n35\n\n\n<3.36 × 10\n−7\n \n\n\n>5x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Note: The SEQ ID NO shown in Table 5 for LEA29Y-Ig is that of the polypeptide sequence of the LEA29Y-Ig fusion protein. The SEQ ID NO shown in Table 5 for each mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein identifies the polypeptide sequence of the mutant CTLA-4 ECD present in the identified mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein. The data pertain to a mutant CTLA-4-Ig comprising a mutant CTLA-4 ECD (e.g., any of SEQ ID NOS: 4, 10-12, 15, 17, 24, 26, 28, 35, and 61) fused at its N-terminus to the C-terminus of the IgG2 Fc polypeptide shown in SEQ ID NO: 184 or 218. However, we have found experimentally by LCMS analysis that a mutant CTLA-4-Ig made in CHO cells using a vector comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding the predicted hIgG2 Fc polypeptide shown in SEQ ID NO: 184 does not typically include the predicted C-terminal lysine (K) residue; thus, the hIgG2 Fc polypeptide sequence of a mutant CTLA-4-IgG2 is that shown in SEQ ID NO: 208, which hIgG2 Fc polypeptide sequence does not typically include the C-terminal lysine residue as compared to the sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 184. Exemplary fusion protein sequences that do not include the C-terminal lysine residue are shown in SEQ ID NOS: 205-214, 219, and 221. Exemplary fusion protein sequences that include the C-terminal lysine residue are shown in SEQ ID NOS: 74-79, 197-200, 220, and 222.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 5\n\n\nMeasuring Biological Activity of CTLA-4 Mutants using Human PBMC Proliferation Assays\n\n\nAnti-CD3 Antibody Stimulation\n\n\n \n \n \nCTLA-4-Ig and particular variants thereof have been shown to be potent inhibitors of T cell proliferation in vitro (see, e.g., Larson et al., Am. J. Transplant. 5, 443). To measure improved activity of mutant CTLA-4-Ig proteins in such assays, a peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) proliferation assay was developed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHuman blood (freshly collected from a donor program) was diluted with an equal volume of PBS and fractionated to isolate PBMCs using a Histopaque (Sigma, #10771) Ficoll gradient as per the manufacturer's recommended conditions. PBMCs were diluted in Growth Medium (DMEM/F12 medium (Invitrogen, #10565-018) supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone #SV30014.03) and 1×PSG (Invitrogen, #10378-016) and added to 96-well culture plates (BD Biosciences, #353077) at a density of 1×10\n5 \ncells/well. Test compounds were serially diluted in Growth Medium and added to wells in triplicate. Cell proliferation was initiated by addition of mouse anti-human CD3 antibody (BD Pharmingen: 555329) to a final concentration of 5 μg/ml. After incubation at 37° C. for 2 days (d), \n3\nH thymidine (GE Healthcare, #TRK758-5MCI) was added at 1 μCi/well and plates were incubated at 37° C. for an additional 16 hr. Cells were harvested with a cell harvester (FilterMate Omnifilter-96 Harvester) using the manufacturer's recommended conditions and measured for \n3\nH thymidine incorporation using a scintillation counter (Wallac Trilux, #1450-421). The degree of \n3\nH thymidine incorporation (\n3\nH thymidine uptake) is indicative of the degree of T cell proliferation. \n3\nH-thymidine incorporation is measured by standard techniques. Proliferation of T cells is expressed as the mean counts per minute (cpm) of triplicate wells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCell proliferation data was analyzed with \nGraphPad Prism\n 5 software using a non-linear regression curve fit model (sigmoidal dose-response, variable slope) and the least squares fit method. The IC50 (also shown as IC\n50\n) parameters and their associated 95% confidence intervals from the results are reported (Table 6). \nFIG. 6\n shows cell proliferation curves from a representative PBMC proliferation assay (using anti-CD3 antibody stimulation) involving a set of exemplary mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins of the invention—i.e., D3-04-IgG2, D3-11-IgG2, D3-12-IgG2, and D3-14-IgG2 fusion proteins. The graph is a plot of \n3\nH thymidine incorporation (counts per minute (cpm)) versus protein concentration (nanoMolar (nM)). \n3\nH thymidine incorporation (3H thymidine uptake), which is indicative of the degree of cell proliferation, is measured by standard techniques.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Orencia® and LEA29Y-Ig fusion proteins were included as controls for comparison. These results demonstrate that mutant CTLA-4-Ig Ig fusion proteins of the invention have significantly higher potency or greater ability than the Orencia® and/or LEA29Y-Ig fusion protein(s) in inhibiting or suppressing polyclonal T cell activation or T cell proliferation in vitro.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe PBMC proliferation assay was performed using other mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins of the invention. Table 6 provides a summary of the data for a representative set of mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins of the invention. Table 6 presents comparisons of mean IC50 values (nanomolar (nM)) for exemplary mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins versus controls (Orencia®, hCTLA-4-IgG2, and LEA29Y-Ig fusion proteins) in the PBMC proliferation assay (with anti-CD3 antibody stimulation). An IC50 value represents the concentration of a compound (e.g., mutant CTLA-4-Ig, hCTLA-4-IgG2, Orencia®, or LEA29Y-Ig fusion protein) that is required for 50% inhibition of T cell proliferation in vitro. IC50 values from individual experiments were averaged to provide mean IC50 values, which were used for statistical analyses. A one-way ANOVA with post hoc Dunnett or Bonferroni test was used to compare mutant CLTA-4-Ig fusion proteins and hCTLA-4-IgG2 to the Orencia® or LEA29Y-Ig fusion protein, respectively (C. W. Dunnett, New Tables for Multiple Comparisons with a Control, Biometrics 20(3):482-491 (September 1964); Abdi, Herve, “The Bonferroni and Sidak corrections for multiple comparisons”, in E\nNCYCLOPEDIA OF \nM\nEASUREMENT AND \nS\nTATISTICS \n(N.J. Salkind ed., Thousand Oaks, Calif. 2007); also available on the worldwide web at the web address utdallas.edu/˜herve/Abdi-Bonferroni2007-pretty.pdf.). Statistical analysis of Ig fusion protein composed of one of the following mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptides—clones D24, D3-07, D3-15 and D3-16—was not performed as n=1. The term “SD (mean log IC50)” represents the standard deviation in mean log IC50 values.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of Data From Exemplary PBMC Proliferation Assays\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing Anti-CD3 Antibody Stimulation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFusion Protein\n\n\n \n\n\nMean Log IC50\n\n\nSD (Mean Log\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(dimer)\n\n\nMean IC50 (nM)\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\nIC50) (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrencia ® fusion\n\n\n5.16\n\n\n0.71\n\n\n0.51\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprotein dimer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhCTLA-4-IgG2\n\n\n8.46\n\n\n0.93\n\n\n0.43\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEA29Y-Ig\n\n\n0.48\n1\n \n\n\n−0.32\n\n\n0.54\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-4-IgG2\n\n\n0.05\n1,2\n \n\n\n−1.27\n\n\n0.45\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-7-IgG2\n\n\n0.12\n\n\n−0.93\n\n\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-11-IgG2\n\n\n0.08\n1,2\n \n\n\n−1.07\n\n\n0.40\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-12-IgG2\n\n\n0.06\n1,2\n \n\n\n−1.27\n\n\n0.17\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-14-IgG2\n\n\n0.07\n1,2\n \n\n\n−1.17\n\n\n0.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-15-IgG2\n\n\n0.21\n\n\n−0.69\n\n\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-17-IgG2\n\n\n0.04\n1,2\n \n\n\n−1.36\n\n\n0.37\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-20-IgG2\n\n\n0.07\n1,2\n \n\n\n−1.19\n\n\n0.37\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-26-IgG2\n\n\n0.15\n1\n \n\n\n−0.83\n\n\n0.49\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-27-IgG2\n\n\n0.10\n1,2\n \n\n\n−1.00\n\n\n0.41\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-29-IgG2\n\n\n0.07\n1,2\n \n\n\n−1.13\n\n\n0.53\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-30-IgG2\n\n\n0.18\n1\n \n\n\n−0.74\n\n\n0.35\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-31-IgG2\n\n\n0.04\n1,2\n \n\n\n−1.42\n\n\n0.25\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-32-IgG2\n\n\n0.10\n1\n \n\n\n−1.00\n\n\n0.47\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-33-IgG2\n\n\n0.12\n1\n \n\n\n−0.94\n\n\n0.69\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-34-IgG2\n\n\n0.41\n1\n \n\n\n−0.39\n\n\n0.18\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-39-IgG2\n\n\n0.47\n1\n \n\n\n−0.33\n\n\n0.21\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-50-IgG2\n\n\n0.35\n1\n \n\n\n−0.46\n\n\n0.23\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-52-IgG2\n\n\n0.49\n1\n \n\n\n−0.31\n\n\n0.20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-53-IgG2\n\n\n0.02\n1,2\n \n\n\n−1.69\n\n\n0.24\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-54-IgG2\n\n\n0.17\n1\n \n\n\n−0.77\n\n\n0.22\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-56-IgG2\n\n\n0.08\n1\n \n\n\n−1.08\n\n\n0.20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-62-IgG2\n\n\n0.05\n1,2\n \n\n\n−1.29\n\n\n0.23\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-69-IgG2\n\n\n0.05\n1,2\n \n\n\n−1.34\n\n\n0.19\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-70-IgG2\n\n\n0.08\n1\n \n\n\n−1.10\n\n\n0.10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-71-IgG2\n\n\n0.05\n\n\n−1.32\n\n\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-72-IgG2\n\n\n0.03\n1,2\n \n\n\n−1.54\n\n\n0.19\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-73-IgG2\n\n\n0.23\n1\n \n\n\n−0.64\n\n\n0.25\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-75-IgG2\n\n\n0.08\n1\n \n\n\n−1.11\n\n\n0.33\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-76-IgG2\n\n\n0.13\n1\n \n\n\n−0.88\n\n\n0.36\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-IgG2\n\n\n0.14\n1\n \n\n\n−0.85\n\n\n0.13\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD24-IgG2\n\n\n0.12\n\n\n−0.93\n\n\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe superscripts shown in Table 6 are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n1\nStatistically different to Orencia with p < 0.05, as determined by 1 way ANOVA with post hoc Dunnett test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n2 \nStatistically different to LEA with p < 0.05, as determined by 1 way ANOVA post hoc Bonferroni test.

Those designated with the superscript (2) (see Table 6) were also statistically superior in potency to the LEA29Y-Ig fusion protein (p<0.05) (i.e., have a greater ability to suppress or inhibit T cell proliferation in in vitro PBMC assays than the LEA29Y-Ig fusion protein), as determined by one-way ANOVA with post hoc Dunnett and Bonferroni tests discussed supra. There was no statistical difference between human CTLA-4 fusion proteins comprising either the modified IgG1 Fc (as in Orencia®) or the wild-type IgG2 Fc (as in hCTLA4-IgG2). This finding implies that the differences in functional activities shown in Table 6 between the mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins of the invention (which each comprise a human IgG2 Fc) and either Orencia® or hCTLA4-IgG2 were as a direct consequence of amino acid changes (i.e., amino acid substitutions) made in the CTLA-4 ECD region. The differences in functional activities between these mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins of the invention and, for example, Orencia® (which comprises a modified IgG1 Fc) were not due to differences in their respective Ig Fc polypeptide sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is believed that given the increased abilities of mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins of the invention to suppress or inhibit T cell proliferation in in vitro assays as compared to Orencia®, LEA29Y-Ig, and/or hCTLA-4-IgG2 fusion proteins, such mutant proteins should also exhibit increased immunosuppressive potencies in in vivo therapeutic and/prophylactic methods as compared to Orencia®, LEA29Y-Ig, and/or hCTLA-4-IgG2 fusion proteins. Each such mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein of the invention is believed to have a greater ability to suppress or inhibit T cell proliferation in in vivo methods or applications relative to Orencia®, LEA29Y-Ig, and/or hCTLA-4-IgG2 fusion proteins, such as in, e.g., therapeutic and/or prophylactic methods for suppressing or inhibiting an immune response in a subject (e.g., in the in vivo treatment of immune system diseases or disorders in a mammal, such as e.g., a human), methods for suppressing or inhibiting rejection of a tissue or organ transplant from a donor by a recipient (e.g., by a mammal, such as e.g., a human), and/or other treatment or diagnostic methods described elsewhere herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nApplying the same statistical analyses, we found no statistical difference between the Orencia® fusion protein (comprising human CTLA-4 ECD-mutant IgG1) and human CTLA-4-IgG2. Thus, it is believed that the differences in the Ig domains of these molecules (i.e., the mutant IgG1 of the Orencia® fusion protein and the human IgG2 of hCTLA-4-IgG2) did not affect the functionality of these molecules. See \nFIG. 11\n. The inhibition of proliferation observed with increasing doses of the Orencia® fusion protein was not significantly different from that observed with CTLA-4-IgG2, indicating that their respective immunosuppressive activities are not biased according to their different IgG isotypes, but rather result from their hCTLA-4 ECD polypeptides. Thus, the different immunosuppressive activities between mutant CTLA-4-Ig polypeptides of the invention and Orencia® fusion protein (or LEA29Y-Ig, since it contains the same Ig as in the Orencia® protein) cannot be attributed to their respective Fc regions comprising different IgG isotypes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention includes monomeric mutant CTLA-4 ECD proteins that have an ability and, in some instances, a greater ability to suppress or inhibit T cell activation or proliferation than a monomeric human CTLA-4 protein or an extracellular domain thereof. Also provided are monomeric mutant CTLA-4 ECD fusion proteins that have an ability and, in some instances, a greater ability to suppress or inhibit T cell activation or proliferation than a monomeric hCTLA-4 Ig fusion protein or an extracellular domain thereof. Also included are mutant CTLA-4 ECD protein dimers that have an ability and, in some instances, a greater ability to suppress or inhibit T cell activation or proliferation than a dimer comprising two human CTLA-4 extracellular domains. Some mutant CTLA-4 ECD fusion protein dimers of the invention (e.g., mutant CTLA-4-ECD-Ig fusion protein dimers) have an ability and, in some instances, a greater ability to suppress or inhibit T cell activation or proliferation than a hCTLA-4-IgG2 fusion protein dimer, Orencia® fusion protein dimer, and/or LEA29YIg fusion protein dimer.\n\n\n \nExample 6\n\n\nMeasuring Biological Activity of Mutant CTLA-4-Ig Molecules Using Human CD4\n+\n T Cell Proliferation Assays\n\n\n \n \n \nHuman CTLA-4-Ig and particular variants thereof have been shown to inhibit T cell proliferation by blocking signaling of CD80 and CD86 though CD28 (Linsley P. S., Immunity 1:793-801 (1994); Larson C. P. et al., Am. J. Transplant. 5:443-453 (2005)). Because the mutant CTLA-4-Ig proteins of the invention are improved in binding avidity for the CD86-Ig ligand, a CD4\n+\n T cell proliferation assay was developed to measure activity of the mutant CTLA-4-Ig proteins in blocking signaling through CD86.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCreation of DNA Sequence Encoding a Full-length Human CD86 Protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPlasmid pcDNA3.1 hB7.2 FL was created to encode the full-length human CD86 protein for expression on the surface of transfected cells. DNA encoding human CD86 was generated by PCR amplification of cDNA derived from human leukocytes (BD Biosciences, Cat#HL4050AH) using forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers designed based on sequence homology to the CD86-encoding nucleotide sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:176. The primers were designed, made, and assembled using standard techniques well known by those of ordinary skill in the art and included stop and start codons and restriction sites as necessary. The PCR amplification procedures employed are also well known in the art. Such techniques are described in, e.g., Berger, Ausubel, and Sambrook, all supra. 50 nanogram (ng) cDNA was used as template in a 100 μl PCR reaction with 1 μM forward and reverse primers, Herculase Polymerase buffer (Stratagene; #600260) and 200 μM dNTPs for 30 amplification cycles (94° C., 30 s; 50° C., 30 s; 72° C., 60 s). The PCR product was purified by QiaQuick PCR Spin Columns (Qiagen #28106) and digested with restriction enzymes KpnI and NotI. Fragments were separated by agarose-gel electrophoresis, purified using Qiaquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, #28704) as per manufacturer's recommendation, and ligated into similarly digested plasmid pcDNA 3.1(+) (Invitrogen, Cat. #V790-20). Ligations were transformed into TOP10 \nE. coli \ncells (Qiagen, Cat. #C4040-10) as per manufacturer's recommendations. Transformed cells were incubated in LB (Luria broth media) containing 50 μg/ml carbenicillin at 250 rpm overnight at 37° C. and then used to make a maxiprep (Qiagen; #12362) stock of plasmid DNA as per the manufacturer's recommended conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe predicted amino acid sequence of the full-length human CD86 protein is shown in SEQ ID NO:175. In this sequence, amino acid residues 1-23 comprise the predicted signal sequence, amino acid residues 24-241 comprise the human CD86 extracellular domain, amino acid residues 242-270 comprise the transmembrane domain, and amino acid residues 271-329 comprise the cytoplasmic domain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCreation of Stable Cell Lines Expressing Human CD86 on the Cell Surface.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHEK293 cells were grown to 80-90% confluence in T-75 flasks containing 20 ml Growth Medium (DMEM/F12 medium (Invitrogen, Cat. #10565-018) supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone Cat. #SV30014.03) and 1×PSG (Invitrogen, Cat. #10378-016)). Cells were transfected with 10 μg plasmid DNA (pcDNA3.1 hB7.2 FL) mixed with 60 μl Fugene 6 (ROCHE, #11814443001) as per the manufacturer's recommended conditions. Cells were incubated for 2 days (d) at 37° C. in Growth Medium and further incubated for 10 d at 37° C. in Selection Medium (Growth Medium containing 300 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen, #10131-027), changing the media every 2 d. To enable FACS sorting, transfected cells were stained with FITC-labeled anti-CD86 antibody (BD Biosciences, #555) as per the manufacturer's recommend conditions. Using a cell-sorter (Dako, MoFlo) gated for FITC signal, CD86-positive cells were individually sorted into 96-well culture plates (Sigma-Aldrich, #CLS-3596) containing 200 μl/well Growth Medium containing 25% Conditioned Medium (Growth Medium previously harvested from untransfected (or naïve) cell cultures). After incubation at 37° C. for 13-19 d, cells were dispersed by trypsin hydrolysis and transferred to 24-well culture plates containing 0.5 ml/well of Growth Medium. After incubation at 37° C. for 7 d, cells were dispersed by trypsin hydrolysis and transferred to T-75 flasks containing 20 ml Growth Medium. Final cell lines were selected based upon high levels of cell-surface CD86 expression as measured by FACS analysis of FITC-labeled anti-CD86 antibody stained cells using FACS Caliber (BD Biosciences), as per the manufacturer's recommended conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCD4\n+\n T cell Proliferation Assays.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCD4\n+\n T cells were enriched to >96% from human Buffy coat preps (Stanford University Blood Center, Stanford, Calif.) using the EasySep Human CD4 Positive Selection Kit (StemCell Technologies, #18052R) with a magnetic cell separator (RoboSep, StemCell Technologies, #20000) following manufacturer's recommendations. Enriched CD4\n+\n T cells were adjusted to a density of 1×10\n6 \ncells/ml in Yssel's media (Gemini Bio-Products, #400-102) supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone SV30014.03) and added to 96 well tissue culture plates at 50 μl/well. HEK293 cells expressing membrane-bound human CD86 were irradiated at 6000 rads (Stanford Research Institute, Menlo Park, Calif.), adjusted to 1×10\n6 \ncells/ml in the same medium and added to the culture plates at 50 μl/well. Test compounds were serially diluted in the same medium and added to wells in triplicate. Cell proliferation was initiated by addition of mouse anti-human CD3 antibody (BD Pharmingen: 555329) to a final concentration of 5 μg/ml. After incubation at 37° C. for 3 d, \n3\nH thymidine (GE Healthcare, #TRK758-5MCI) was added at 1 μCi/well and plates were incubated at 37° C. for an additional 18 hr. Cells were harvested using a cell harvester (Perkin Elmer Filter Harvester D961962) and \n3\nH thymidine was measured using a liquid scintillation counter (Wallac Trilux 1450) as per the manufacturer's recommended conditions. Cell proliferation data were analyzed with \nGraphPad Prism\n 5 software using a variable slope equation (Y=Bottom+(Top−Bottom)/(1+10̂((LogIC50−X)(HillSlope))) to generate an IC50 for each test compound. The term “(LogIC50−X)(HillSlope)” is an exponent in the equation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 7\n shows cell proliferation curves from representative CD4\n+\n T cell proliferation assays involving an exemplary set of mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins of the invention—i.e., D3-04-IgG2, D3-11-IgG2, D3-12-IgG2, and D3-14-IgG2. Orencia® and LEA29Y-Ig fusion proteins were included as controls for comparison. The graph is a plot of \n3\nH thymidine incorporation (cpm) versus concentration (nM) of protein. \n3\nH thymidine incorporation is indicative of the degree of cell proliferation and is measured by standard techniques. These results demonstrate that mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins of the invention have significantly higher potency or greater ability than the Orencia® and/or LEA29Y-Ig fusion proteins in inhibiting or suppressing CD86 co-stimulation in vitro.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis CD4\n+\n T cell proliferation assay was performed on a number of other mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins of the invention. Table 7 provides a summary of the data for a set of exemplary mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins of the invention.

There was no statistical difference between human CTLA-4 fusion proteins comprising either the modified IgG1 Fc (as in Orencia®) or the wild-type IgG2 Fc (as in hCTLA4-IgG2). This finding implies that the differences in functional activities shown in Table 7 between the mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins of the invention (which each comprise a human IgG2 Fc) and either Orencia® or hCTLA4-IgG2 were as a direct consequence of amino acid changes (i.e., amino acid substitutions) made in the CTLA-4 ECD region. The differences in functional activities between these mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins of the invention and, for example, Orencia® (which comprises a modified IgG1 Fc) were not due to differences in their respective Ig Fc polypeptide sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is believed that given the increased abilities of mutant CTLA-4-Ig proteins of the invention to suppress or inhibit CD86-mediated co-stimulation of T cells (e.g., human T cells) in in vitro assays as compared to Orencia®, LEA29Y-Ig, and/or hCTLA-4-IgG2 fusion proteins, such mutant proteins should also exhibit increased immunosuppressive potencies in in vivo therapeutic and/prophylactic methods or applications as compared to Orencia®, LEA29Y-Ig, and/or human CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins (e.g., human CTLA-4-IgG2 (“hCTLA-4-IgG2”)), respectively. In one aspect, mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins of the invention are believed to have a greater ability to suppress or inhibit CD86-mediated co-stimulation of T cells (e.g., human T cells) in in vivo methods or applications compared to Orencia®, LEA29Y-Ig, and/or human CTLA-4-Ig (e.g., hCTLA-4-IgG2) fusion proteins, respectively, such as in, e.g., therapeutic and/or prophylactic methods for suppressing or inhibiting an immune response in a subject (e.g., in the in vivo treatment of immune system diseases or disorders in e.g., a mammal, such as, e.g., a human), methods for suppressing or inhibiting rejection of a tissue or organ transplant from a donor by a recipient (e.g., by a mammal, such as, e.g., a human), and/or other treatment or diagnostic methods described elsewhere herein.\n\n\n \nExample 7\n\n\nMeasuring Biological Activity of Mutant CTLA-4-Ig Molecules Using Human PBMC Proliferation Assays\n\n\nRecall Antigen Stimulation\n\n\n \n \n \nThe activation of memory T cells is an important aspect of autoimmunity (Rogers N. J., et al. Eur. J. Immunol. 35:2909-2919 (2005)). To measure immunosuppressive activity of mutant CTLA-4-Ig proteins in this respect, a peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) proliferation assay was developed using PPD antigen stimulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHuman blood (freshly collected from a donor program) was diluted with an equal volume of PBS and fractionated to isolate PBMCs using a Histopaque (Sigma, #10771) Ficoll gradient as per the manufacturer's recommended conditions.

Test compounds were serially diluted in the same medium and added to wells in quadruplicate. Cell proliferation was initiated by addition of PPD antigen (purified protein derivative from \nMycobacterium tuberculosis\n, Mycos, #P-1000-001) to a final concentration of 5 μg/ml.

Cells were harvested with a cell harvester (FilterMate Omnifilter-96 Harvester, Perkin Elmer) using the manufacturer's recommended conditions and measured for \n3\nH thymidine incorporation using a scintillation counter (Wallac Trilux, #1450-421). Cell proliferation data was analyzed with \nGraphPad Prism\n 5 software using a non-linear regression curve fit model (sigmoidal dose-response, variable slope) and the least squares fit method. The IC\n50 \n(or “IC50”) parameters and their associated 95% confidence intervals are reported.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 8\n shows cell proliferation curves from representative PBMC proliferation assays involving a set of exemplary mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins of the invention—i.e., D3-IgG2, D3-12-IgG2, D3-17-IgG2, and D3-29-IgG2 fusion proteins.

Cells were harvested with a cell harvester (FilterMate Omnifilter-96 Harvester, Perkin Elmer) using the manufacturer's recommended conditions and measured for \n3\nH thymidine incorporation using a scintillation counter (Wallac Trilux, #1450-421). Cell proliferation data was analyzed with \nGraphPad Prism\n 5 software using a non-linear regression curve fit model (sigmoidal dose-response, variable slope) and the least squares fit method. The IC50 parameters and their associated 95% confidence intervals are reported.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 9\n shows cell proliferation curves from representative MLR proliferation assays involving an exemplary mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein of the invention: D3-IgG2. Orencia® and LEA29Y-Ig fusion proteins were included as controls for comparison. The graph is a plot of \n3\nH thymidine incorporation (cpm) versus protein concentration (nM). \n3\nH thymidine incorporation, which is indicative of the degree of cell proliferation, is measured by standard techniques. These results demonstrate that D3-IgG2 has significantly higher potency than Orencia® and/or LEA29Y-Ig fusion proteins in inhibiting or suppressing primary allostimulation of T cells in vitro (e.g., D3-IgG2 has a greater ability to suppress or inhibit primary allostimulation of T cell proliferation in an in vitro MLR assay than Orencia® or LEA29Y-Ig fusion proteins).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis MLR assay was performed on a number of other mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins of the invention. Table 9 provides a summary of the data for a set of exemplary mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins of the invention. Table 9 presents comparisons of mean IC50 values (nanomolar (nM)) for exemplary mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins versus reference controls (Orencia® and LEA29Y-Ig fusion proteins) in the MLR assay. IC50 values from two separate experiments were averaged to provide mean IC50 values. The term “SD (mean log IC50)” represents the standard deviation in mean log IC50 values. The mean IC50 values for the mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins shown in Table 9 were lower than the respective mean IC50 values of Orencia® and LEA29Y-Ig fusion proteins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention provides mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins that are believed to be superior in potency to Orencia® and/or LEA29Y-Ig fusion proteins (e.g., the mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins are believed to have a greater ability to suppress or inhibit primary allostimulation of T cell proliferation in an in vitro MLR assay than Orencia® and/or LEA29Y-Ig fusion proteins).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is believed that based on the expected enhanced abilities of mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins of the invention to suppress or inhibit primary allostimulation of T cells (e.g., human T cells) in in vitro assays as compared to Orencia® and/or LEA29Y-Ig fusion proteins, such mutant proteins should also exhibit increased immunosuppressive potencies in in vivo therapeutic and/prophylactic methods or applications as compared to Orencia® and/or LEA29Y-Ig fusion proteins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins of the invention have significantly higher potency than Orencia®, LEA29Y-Ig, and/or human CTLA-4-Ig (e.g., human CTLA-4-IgG2) fusion proteins in inhibiting or suppressing primary allostimulation of T cells in vitro (e.g., mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins have a greater ability to suppress or inhibit primary allostimulation of T cell proliferation in an in vitro MLR assay than Orencia®, LEA29Y-Ig, and/or human CTLA-4-Ig) fusion proteins. In one aspect, a mutant CTLA-4-Ig of the invention is believed to have a greater ability to suppress or inhibit primary allostimulation of T cells (e.g., human T cells) in an in vivo method or application compared to Orencia®, LEA29Y-Ig, and/or human CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins, such as in, e.g., a therapeutic and/or prophylactic method of suppressing or inhibiting an immune response in a subject (e.g., in the in vivo treatment of immune system diseases or disorders in a mammal, such as e.g., a human), a method of suppressing or inhibiting rejection of a tissue or organ transplant from a donor by a recipient (e.g., by a mammal, such as e.g., a human), and/or other treatment or diagnostic methods described elsewhere herein.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of Data From Exemplary MLR Assays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFusion Protein\n\n\n \n\n\nMean Log IC50\n\n\nSD (Mean Log\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(dimer)\n\n\nMean IC50 (nM)\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\nIC50) (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrencia ® fusion\n\n\n12.53\n\n\n1.05\n\n\n0.23\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprotein dimer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEA29Y-Ig\n\n\n0.92\n\n\n−0.19\n\n\n0.48\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-IgG2\n\n\n0.06\n\n\n−1.26\n\n\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-12-IgG2\n\n\n0.09\n\n\n−1.11\n\n\n0.34\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-14-IgG2\n\n\n0.08\n\n\n−1.20\n\n\n0.43\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-17-IgG2\n\n\n0.09\n\n\n−1.15\n\n\n0.43\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-20-IgG2\n\n\n0.14\n\n\n−1.11\n\n\n0.64\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-27-IgG2\n\n\n0.13\n\n\n−1.29\n\n\n0.86\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-29-IgG2\n\n\n0.11\n\n\n−1.14\n\n\n0.54\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-34-IgG2\n\n\n0.10\n\n\n−1.09\n\n\n0.39\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-53-IgG2\n\n\n0.02\n\n\n−1.64\n\n\n0.11\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-54-IgG2\n\n\n0.07\n\n\n−1.13\n\n\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-56-IgG2\n\n\n0.06\n\n\n−1.23\n\n\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-69-IgG2\n\n\n0.04\n\n\n−1.41\n\n\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-71-IgG2\n\n\n0.05\n\n\n−1.32\n\n\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-75-IgG2\n\n\n0.08\n\n\n−1.11\n\n\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD3-76-IgG2\n\n\n0.08\n\n\n−1.11\n\n\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe term “NA” in Table 9 means “not available”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 9\n\n\n \n \n \nAn adult human patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis may be treated with a soluble mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein as follows. A pharmaceutical composition comprising a soluble mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein of the invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier (e.g., PBS) is prepared. An exemplary soluble mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein comprises two identical monomeric mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins linked together by one or more disulfide bonds, wherein each such monomeric fusion protein comprises a mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide of the invention comprising a polypeptide sequence selected from any of SEQ ID NOS:1-73 fused at its C-terminus to the N-terminus of a human IgG2 Fc polypeptide. Exemplary fusion proteins include those comprising polypeptide sequences set forth in any of SEQ ID NOS:74-79, 197-200, 205-214, and 219-222. Such fusion proteins are typically expressed in dimeric form. The concentration of the fusion protein in the pharmaceutical composition may be in a range of from about 0.05 mg/ml to about 200 mg/ml, from about 1 mg/ml to about 150 mg/ml, from about 25 mg/ml to about 120 mg/ml, from about 1 mg/ml to about 100 mg/ml, from about 25 mg/ml to about 100 mg/ml, from about 50 mg/ml to about 100 mg/ml, from about 50 mg/ml to about 75 mg/ml, from about 100 mg/ml to about 150 mg/ml, and the like. For example, the fusion protein concentration in the pharmaceutical composition may be about 1 mg/ml, 5 mg/ml, 10 mg/ml, 15 mg/ml, 25 mg/ml, 30 mg/ml, 40 mg/ml, 50 mg/ml, 60 mg/ml, 70 mg/ml, 80 mg/ml, 90 mg/ml, 100 mg/ml, 150 mg/ml, or 200 mg/ml. The pH of such pharmaceutical composition is about \npH\n 4 to about \npH\n 10, including about \npH\n 5 to about \npH\n 9, about pH 6.5 to about pH 8.5, preferably about pH 6.0 to pH 8.0, about 6.5 to pH 7.5, or about pH 7.0 to about pH 8.0.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTreatment of the patient's rheumatoid arthritis is carried out by administering a therapeutically effective amount of the mutant CTLA-4-Ig to the patient (e.g., effective dose) by intravenous or subcutaneous injection. The site of injection may be, e.g., the patient's arm, torso, or leg. The effective dose of the mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein administered is typically, but not limited to, e.g., from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg body weight of the adult human patient, such as, e.g., from about 0.01-5.0 mg/kg, about 0.01-3.0 mg/kg, about 0.05-2.5 mg/kg, about 0.1-2.0 mg/kg, about 0.1-1.0 mg/kg, about 0.01-0.05 mg/kg, about 0.5-1.5 mg/kg, about 1.0-4.0 mg/kg, about 1.0-3.0 mg/kg, about 1.0-2.0 mg/kg, including, but not limited to, about 0.01 mg/kg, 0.05 mg/kg, 0.075 mg/kg, 0.1 mg/kg, 0.15 mg/kg, 0.2 mg/kg, 0.25 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, 0.75 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 1.25 mg/ml, 1.5 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg, 2.5 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, 4 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, 25 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg, 75 mg/kg, or 100 mg/kg body weight of the patient is administered to the patient. Alternatively, an effective amount or dose or dose range described in the “Methods of the Invention” section above may be used. The dose of the fusion protein to be administered is determined based on the potency of the fusion protein and/or the severity of the patient's symptoms or signs of rheumatoid arthritis. The total amount of mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein administered to the patient may be, e.g., from about 0.01 mg to about 100 mg, typically from about 1 mg to 100 mg, from about 10 mg to 100 mg, from about 10 mg to about 75 mg, or from about 10 to about 50 mg. The volume of pharmaceutical composition administered to the patient is determined based upon the concentration of fusion protein in the composition and the dose of fusion protein to be administered. For subcutaneous injection, one to two milliliters of the pharmaceutical composition comprising the fusion protein is typically administered per injection. For intravenous injection, an appropriate volume of the pharmaceutical composition comprising the fusion protein can be administered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing injection of the initial dose, a second identical dose of the fusion protein may be administered to the patient subcutaneously (e.g., s.c. injection) or intravenously (e.g., i.v. injection) at, e.g., 1, 2, 3, or 4 weeks after the initial dose. The dosing schedule may be one dose every two weeks, one dose/month, one dose every two months, etc. depending, e.g., upon the patient's condition. Subsequent doses may be administered every four weeks or more or less frequently, as necessary. The frequency of dosing may vary depending upon the patient's condition and may depend upon the severity of the patient's symptoms or signs of rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an exemplary aspect, an amount of a pharmaceutical composition comprising a mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein dimer of the invention (such as D3-29-IgG2, D3-54-IgG2, D3-56-IgG2, D3-69-IgG2, etc.) and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient sufficient to provide a dose of the fusion protein dimer of about 0.5 mg/kg body weight is administered by subcutaneous injection to a human suffering from rheumatoid arthritis once per week or once per month, as needed, depending upon the patient's condition and response to the drug.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another exemplary aspect, an amount of a pharmaceutical composition comprising a CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein dimer of the invention (such as D3-29-IgG2, D3-54-IgG2, D3-56-IgG2, D3-69-IgG2, etc.) and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient sufficient to provide a dose of the fusion protein dimer of about 10 mg/kg is administered intravenously to a human suffering from rheumatoid arthritis once per week or once per month, as needed, depending upon the patient's condition and response to the drug. Standard i.v. procedures can be used for such administration. For example, the pharmaceutical composition can be infused into the human with another fluid, such as a sterile saline solution, dextrose solution, or other isotonic solution, using a standard continuous intravenous drip through a standard intravenous access device.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach above-described treatment method by s.c. or i.v. injection is expected to reduce or alleviate one or more signs, symptoms, or biological responses associated with rheumatoid arthritis, such as, e.g., inflammation, joint tenderness, joint swelling, pain, tissue atrophy, and stiffness, in the patient. Such treatment may reduce further progression of the disease in the patient, particularly in the connective, muscular, and skeletal tissues. For example, such treatment may reduce the progression of damage to or deterioration of connective tissue, atrophy muscular tissue, bone, joints, cartilage, and/or spinal column, and the like in the patient. Additional clinical symptoms of the disease, including damage caused to the skin, central nervous system or organs, may also be lessened or alleviated. Such treatment may also improve physical functioning of the patient.\n\n\n \nExample 10\n\n\n \n \n \nAn adult human patient undergoing maintenance therapy for prevention of organ transplant rejection may be treated with a soluble mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein as follows. A pharmaceutical composition comprising a soluble mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein of the invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier (e.g., PBS or the like) is prepared. An exemplary soluble mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein comprises two identical monomeric mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins linked together by one or more disulfide bonds, wherein each such monomeric fusion protein comprises a mutant CTLA-4 ECD polypeptide of the invention comprising a polypeptide sequence selected from any of SEQ ID NOS:1-73 fused at its C-terminus to the N-terminus of a human IgG2 Fc polypeptide.

For example, the fusion protein concentration in the pharmaceutical composition may be about 1 mg/ml, 5 mg/ml, 10 mg/ml, 15 mg/ml, 25 mg/ml, 30 mg/ml, 40 mg/ml, 50 mg/ml, 60 mg/ml, 70 mg/ml, 80 mg/ml, 90 mg/ml, 100 mg/ml, 150 mg/ml, or 200 mg/ml. The pH of such pharmaceutical composition is about \npH\n 4 to about \npH\n 10, including about \npH\n 5 to about \npH\n 9, about pH 6.5 to about pH 8.5, about pH 6.0 to pH 8.0, about 6.5 to pH 7.5, or about pH 7.0 to about pH 8.0.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMaintenance therapy for prevention or suppression of organ transplant rejection is carried out by administering a therapeutically effective amount of the mutant CTLA-4-Ig to the patient (e.g., effective dose) who has received an organ transplant (e.g., kidney transplant) by intravenous or subcutaneous injection. The site of injection may be, e.g., the patient's arm, torso, or leg. The effective dose of the mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein administered is typically, but not limited to, e.g., from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg body weight of the adult human patient, such as, e.g., from about 0.01-5.0 mg/kg, about 0.01-3.0 mg/kg, about 0.05-2.5 mg/kg, about 0.1-2.0 mg/kg, about 0.1-1.0 mg/kg, about 0.01-0.05 mg/kg, about 0.5-1.5 mg/kg, about 1.0-4.0 mg/kg, about 1.0-3.0 mg/kg, about 1.0-2.0 mg/kg, including, but not limited to, about 0.01 mg/kg, 0.05 mg/kg, 0.075 mg/kg, 0.1 mg/kg, 0.15 mg/kg, 0.2 mg/kg, 0.25 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, 0.75 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 1.25 mg/ml, 1.5 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg, 2.5 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, 4 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, 25 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg, 75 mg/kg, or 100 mg/kg body weight of the patient is administered to the patient. Alternatively, an effective amount or dose or dose range described in the “Methods of the Invention” section above may be used. The dose of the fusion protein to be administered is determined based on the potency of the fusion protein and/or the severity of the patient's symptoms or signs of organ transplant rejection. The total amount of mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein administered to the patient may be, e.g., from about 0.01 mg to about 100 mg, typically from about 1 mg to 100 mg, from about 10 mg to 100 mg, from about 10 mg to about 75 mg, or from about 10 to about 50 mg. The volume of pharmaceutical composition administered to the patient is determined based upon the concentration of fusion protein in the composition and the dose of fusion protein to be administered. The fusion protein can be administered on any day post-transplant, e.g., \n \n \n \nday\n \n \n \n 1, 4, 7, 14, 28, 56, 84, etc. post-transplant. For subcutaneous injection, one to two milliliters of the pharmaceutical composition is typically administered. For intravenous injection, an appropriate volume of the pharmaceutical composition comprising the fusion protein can be administered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing injection of the initial dose, a second identical dose of the fusion protein may be administered to the patient subcutaneously or intravenously at 1, 2, 3, or 4 weeks after the initial dose. The dosing schedule may be one dose every two weeks, one dose/month, one dose every two months, etc. depending, e.g., upon the patient's condition. Subsequent doses may be administered every four weeks or more or less frequently, as necessary, and continued, if desired, on a monthly basis. The frequency of dosing may vary depending upon the patient's condition and may depend upon the severity of the patient's symptoms or signs of organ transplant rejection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch treatment is expected to reduce or alleviate one or more signs, symptoms, or biological responses associated with organ transplant rejection, such as, e.g., acute rejection of the transplanted organ, chronic rejection of the transplanted organ, decrease in function of the transplanted organ, increase in serum creatinine levels in the patient, and/or increased infiltration of T cells into the transplanted organ. Such treatment may reduce the likelihood of rejection of the transplanted organ by the patient's immune system.\n\n\n \nExample 11\n\n\nPharmacokinetic Assessment of Mutant CTLA-4-IgG2 Fusion Proteins in Rats\n\n\n \n \n \nThe serum concentration of a therapeutic after external administration to a living organism greatly influences therapeutic efficacy, and is determined by pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation. In the following procedure, PK profiles were assessed in rats for representative mutant CTLA-4-IgG2 test articles D3-29-IgG2, D3-54-IgG2, D3-56-IgG2, D3-69-IgG2, and D3-75-IgG2 in comparison to both hCTLA-4-IgG2 and Orencia® fusion protein test articles. The study design, and data generation and interpretation are described forthwith.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn Life Study Design.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWeight-matched, male Hans Wistar rats were used after an acclimatization period of at least 5 days. Test article dosing volumes were calculated for individual animals based on their weight such that all received 1 mg/kg of test article. A typical 150 gram (g) rat therefore received 150 μl dosing volume since every test article was prepared at 1 mg/ml in PBS. A single administration of a mutant CTLA-4-IgG2 test article described above, hCTLA-4IgG2, or Orencia® fusion protein was delivered, either as an intravenous (i.v. or IV) bolus, or by the subcutaneous (abbreviated as “s.c.” or “SC”) route. The study size was sufficient for a minimum of four blood samplings of 300 μl per timepoint, while restricting the blood volume removed from any given rat to no more than 10% total blood volume. The blood sampling time course was either pre-dose, 5 minutes (min), 30 min, 2 hours (h), 4 h, 8 h, 1 day (d), 2 d, 3 d, 4 d, 6 d, 8 d, 10 d, 12 d, and 14 d post-dose, or 5 min, 30 min, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, 1 d, 2 d, 3d, 4 d, 6 d, 8d, 10 d, 11 d, 12 d, 13 d, 14 d and 15 d post-dose for i.v and s.c. administrations, respectively. Serum was prepared from individual blood samples, and tested by ELISA to quantify the presence of the administered test article.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPK ELISA Method.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe mutant CTLA-4-IgG2, hCTLA-4IgG2, or Orencia® fusion protein present in the serum samples were bound to human CD80-murine IgG (described above) pre-coated onto microtiter plates. Detection was achieved by addition of a Horse Radish Peroxidase (HRP) conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch #109-035-098). Quantification was through the use of a chromogenic HRP substrate, 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), plus hydrogen peroxide (Kem-En-Tec #4390A), whereby the reaction was stopped by addition of 0.2N sulphuric acid (H\n2\nSO\n4\n), and optical absorbance was measured at 450 nm by a spectrophotometer. Serum samples were pre-diluted 1/20 before addition to the ELISA plate such that matrix was normalized to 5% rat sera, and further diluted in 5% rat sera for a total of eight dilutions. The concentration of each diluted serum sample was quantified against a standard curve prepared using titrations of the same test article spiked into 5% rat sera. The standard curve ranged from 10 to 0.078 ng/ml, and the accuracy range was determined to be from twice background to 5 ng/ml in 5% rat sera. The quality of the standard curve was assessed by quality controls (QC) of the same test article prepared in 5% rat sera at high, middle and low concentrations of the standard curve accuracy range. The QC acceptance criterion was for the observed QC concentration to be within 20% of the expected QC concentration. The concentration of an individual unknown serum sample was generated by averaging the concentrations assigned to dilutions with optical densities (ODs) within the accuracy range of the standard curve. At least 4 individual serum samples were used to calculate the mean serum concentration at each nominal timepoint.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPK Parameters.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIGS. 15A and 15B\n show PK profiles for Orencia® fusion protein, hCTLA-4-IgG2, and the mutant CTLA-4-IgG2 fusion proteins administered at 1 mg/kg as a single (A) intravenous (IV) bolus or (B) subcutaneous (SC) injection in rats. The error bars represent standard deviation of the mean (SD). The dashed line represents the lower limit of quantification for the ELISA (˜3 ng/ml for test article in 100% sera). The mean serum concentration at each nominal timepoint after test article administration at time 0 h comprises the datapoints of the semi-log concentration-time profile in \nFIG. 15\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe mean serum concentrations were used to generate PK parameters using WinNonLin model 201 (i.v.—bolus input), or model 200 (extravascular input) for the i.v.

The terminal half-life value (T½) is the time taken in hours for the concentration of test article in the serum to decline by half during the termination phase of the concentration-time profile. The area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) is quantified from time zero to infinity using the trapezoidal rule. The clearance (Cl) was calculated using the equation dose/AUC, whilst the volume of distribution (Vz) of the terminal phase was calculated using the equation Cl/k.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe bioavailability factor (F) for each compound is presented in Table 11, and was determined by calculating the AUC by the subcutaneous route/AUC by the intravenous route.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBioavailability Comparison of Orencia ® Fusion Protein,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhCTLA-4-Ig2, D3-29-IgG2, D3-54-IgG2, D3-56-IgG2, D3-69-IgG2,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand D3-75-IgG2 Fusion Proteins\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound\n\n\nBioavailability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOrencia\n\n\n0.54\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCTLA-4IgG2\n\n\n0.34\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nD3-29\n\n\n0.71\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nD3-54\n\n\n0.51\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nD3-56\n\n\n0.58\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nD3-69\n\n\n0.45\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nD3-75\n\n\n0.52\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHuman CTLA-4IgG2 and Orencia® fusion protein displayed similar PK profiles despite their difference in IgG frameworks, implying that the human IgG2 and mutated human IgG1 Fc portions of these respective test articles have comparable PK activity when the functional domain is constant. By inference, any changes seen in PK profile for mutant CTLA-4-IgG2 fusion proteins as compared to Orencia® fusion protein should therefore be attributable to differences in the functional domain, and not the Fc portion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor each mutant CTLA-4-IgG2 fusion protein, elimination was slow as suggested by the long half-life values and large area under the curves. Half-lives ranged from 11.2 to 56.4 hr for SC dosing, and from 15.3 to 83.0 hours (h) for IV dosing in comparison to Orencia® fusion protein, which had a half-life of 70.0 or 42.3 hours when administered by SC or IV routes, respectively. AUC values for the mutant CTLA-4-IgG2 fusion proteins were on average superior to the Orencia® fusion protein. After SC dosing the mean was 879.5+/−281.6 h*kg*ng/L/mg as compared to 391 h*kg*ng/L/mg for SC Orencia® fusion protein, while an IV administration gave an average AUC of 1645.5+/−641.1 h*kg*ng/L/mg as compared to 728 h*kg*ng/L/mg for IV Orencia® fusion protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe volume of distribution was similar for both routes of administration in that mutant CTLA-4-IgG2 fusion proteins were distributed outside the serum but inside the extravascular fluid as suggested by the average value of 44.8 ml/kg, which is above the plasma reference volume of 30 ml/kg, and within the extracellular fluid reference limit of 300 ml/kg for a standard rat (Davies, B. et al., Pharm. Res. 10(7):1093-95 (1993)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBioavailability was also similar for the majority of the mutant CTLA-4-IgG2 fusion proteins, with an average of 0.6+/−0.1, which compared favorably to the 0.53 bioavailability of Orencia® fusion protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFinally, Cmax was generally higher for the mutant CTLA-4-IgG2 fusion proteins as compared to the Orencia® fusion protein. Cmax values ranged from 4.5 to 9.3 ug/L for dosing, and from 20.6 to 81.9 ug/L for IV dosing in comparison to the Orencia® fusion protein, which had a Cmax of 3.3 or 22.3 ug/L when administered by SC or IV routes, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOverall, the PK data showed that all assessed mutant CTLA-4-IgG2 fusion proteins typically had a non-inferior PK profile to the Orencia® fusion protein when administered to rats at 1 mg/kg via SC or IV routes, and that IgG1 or IgG2 Fc portions were comparable when the functional domain was constant.\n\n\n \nExample 12\n\n\n \n \n \nThis example describes a method for creating a stably transfected cell line for expressing mutant CTLA4-Ig fusion proteins of the invention, using the cell line for routine laboratory scale production of the mutant CTLA4-Ig fusion protein, and purifying the mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion proteins from cell expression media. Although this example specifically describes a method for creating a stably transfected CHO-K1 cell line for expressing the D3-54-IgG2 fusion protein, using such cell for laboratory scale production and purifying the protein from media, the methods described herein can be used with any mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein of the invention and/or any appropriate cell line disclosed above.\n\n\n \nCreation of Stably Transfected Cell Line.\n\n\n \n \n \nMaterials.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCHO-K1 naïve (untransfected) cells: CHO-K1 cells adapted to serum-free suspension growth in chemically-defined medium (Cell ID: M4-PeM-0436-112-01) were stored in liquid nitrogen vapor phase (Dewar MVE1536P). One vial of M4-PeM-0436-112-01 was thawed and cultured with CD OptiCHO™ medium (Invitrogen, #12681) in shake flasks. The cultures provided cells for transfection and conditioned medium for growth and cloning. All cultures were grown at 37° C., 5% CO\n2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPlasmid: DNA encoding the D3-54 mutant CTLA-4 ECD fused to a human IgG2a Fc region was inserted into the CET1019AS UCOE vector (Millipore) and the resulting plasmid CET1019AS-D3-54-IgG2 was used for all transfections.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCell culture medium: CD Opti-CHO (Invitrogen #12681) chemically-defined animal component-free medium, supplemented with 2% v/v 200 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen #25031), was used for all cultures.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConditioned medium: Conditioned medium was obtained by cultivating the parental CHO-K1 cell line in CD Opti-CHO medium. At cell counts≧5×10\n5 \ncells/ml, the cell culture was centrifuged and the conditioned medium supernatant was sterile-filtered. Conditioned medium was made fresh each day for use or stored at 2-8° C. for up to 7 days.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n50% conditioned medium: Conditioned medium (above) combined with an equal volume of fresh cell culture medium; made fresh each day it is used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalytical Methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCell count and viability determination were performed with a Cedex or Cedex HiRes cell counter (Innovatis).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInitial screening of clones expressing the mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein (D3-54-IgG2) for production was performed by ELISA. ELISA plates were coated with hCD80-murine Ig fusion protein overnight. The following day, samples to be analyzed were transferred to the ELISA plates at 50- and 200-fold dilutions in duplicate. After two hours incubation, anti-human IgG-HRP antibody was added and incubated for 30 minutes. The plates were developed with TMB and read at 450 nm. Raw optical densities (OD) were reported.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nQuantitative determination of the D3-54-IgG2 fusion protein concentration was performed by a Protein A HPLC method using a Poros A/20 column (ABI #1-5024-12). Two buffers were used: Buffer A: 50 mM phosphoric acid, 150 mM potassium chloride, pH 7.6±0.1 and Buffer B: 50 mM phosphoric acid, 150 mM potassium chloride, pH 2.5±0.1. Both buffers additionally had 5% isopropanol added. Equilibration and wash after sample injection was with 42% Buffer A and 58% Buffer B (pH 6.5). Elution was a linear gradient to 12% Buffer A and 88% Buffer B over 1 minute.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProcedure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe naïve adherent CHO-K1 cells used for the creation of stable cell lines used in GMP production of D3-54-IgG2 fusion protein were adapted to suspension growth in chemically defined CD OptiCHO™ medium. A vial of these naïve CHO-K1 cells was thawed and grown in 125 ml shake flasks containing CD OptiCHO™ medium to a density of 5×10\n5 \nviable cells/ml. 2×10\n6 \nviable cells were resuspended in 400 μl of 50% conditioned medium and combined with 20 μg plasmid DNA (D3-54-IgG2 in a CET1019AS UCEO vector) in a cuvette. Electroporation was performed with a Gene Xcell Pulser (BioRad) at 320 volts (V) with a square wave pulse length of 15 milliseconds (ms). Duplicate transfections were performed and then the cells were pooled. The pooled cells were transferred to a T-25 flask containing 5 ml of 50% conditioned medium and incubated for two days.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTransfected cells were either directly dispensed into 96-well plates for cloning or cultured with antibiotic selection until a stable pool was obtained, and then dispensed into 96-well plates. Two days after electroporation, the culture was diluted to 1250 cells/ml in conditioned medium containing 8 μg/ml of puromycin for selection pressure. The cells were dispensed into 96-well plates at 200 μl per well (250 cells/well). The plates were incubated for approximately 10 days to kill untransfected and transiently-transfected cells. After 10-12 days, every well in every plate was visually inspected to identify wells with single colonies. These wells were later re-inspected to verify they contained single, healthy colonies suitable for expansion into 24-well plates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo days after electroporation, the culture was centrifuged and resuspended in 50% conditioned medium containing 7 μg/ml of puromycin for selection pressure. A control flask was also inoculated with untransfected cells in the same medium. Based on on-going optimization studies, the puromycin concentration was increased to 8 μg/ml after 3 days. The stable pool was generated 10-12 days after selection, when all cells in the control flask died. Product expression in the stable pool was verified by protein A HPLC and culture viability was verified to be >95%. The cells were serially diluted in conditioned medium without puromycin to a final density of 3.8 cells/ml. The cells were seeded onto 96-well plates at 200 μl per well (75 cells/plate or 0.8 cells/well).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter one day every well in every plate was visually inspected to identify wells with single cells or colonies. The next day, wells with single colonies of 2-4 cells were selected. Any wells with more than two colonies were eliminated. A second operator verified the selections. The wells were later re-inspected to verify they contained single, healthy colonies suitable for expansion into 24-well plates\n\n\n \n \n \n \nClones from 96-well plates were expanded into 24-well plates containing 1 ml of conditioned medium per well with 8 μg/ml of puromycin. The entire contents of the selected wells from the 96-well plates with single colonies were transferred to individual wells in the 24-well plates. 200 μl was taken from each new well in the 24-well plate to wash the corresponding well in the 96-well plate and transferred back. For backup, 200 μl of conditioned medium containing 8 μg/ml of puromycin was added back to each well in the 96-well plates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter 1-3 days, each well in the 24-well plates was sampled and tested for D3-54-IgG2 expression by ELISA. Clones for further expansion were selected based on the raw ELISA OD values as well as demonstration of adequate growth.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe top 35-40 clones, based on ELISA and observable growth results were expanded into T-25 flasks containing 5 ml of conditioned medium with 8 μg/ml of puromycin. The entire contents of each of the selected wells from the 24-well plates were transferred to individual T-25 flasks. Residual cells in the wells were washed with the same medium and added to the corresponding T-25 flask. For backup, 1 ml of conditioned medium containing 8 μg/ml of puromycin was added back to each well in the 24-well plates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe number of clones was further reduced by selecting for clones with the highest productivity. Cells were resuspended in fresh medium at 1-2×10\n5 \nviable cells/ml and seeded into T25 flasks (5 ml culture) or 125 ml shake flasks (12 ml culture). The cultures were incubated for 22-24 hours and then a final cell density and viability determination was made and a sample was taken for product concentration determination by Protein A HPLC. Productivity was calculated by dividing the total amount of protein produced by the total number of viable cells in the flask and dividing by the culture duration. The units were converted to picograms per cell per day or “pcd”. Clones were ranked according to their pcd values, but clones that did not exhibit significant growth were omitted. The top clones were expanded to 125 ml shake flasks for cryopreservation and further evaluation of growth and productivity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nClones to be further evaluated were seeded into 250 ml shake flasks at 1×10\n5 \nviable cells/ml in 50 ml fresh medium. When the cell density reached 1×10\n6 \nviable cells/ml, the culture was passaged into a new shake flask, again at 1×10\n5 \nviable cells/ml in 50 ml fresh medium. The passaging was repeated once more. During this third passage, the culture was sampled daily for cell count, viability, and product concentration determination by Protein A HPLC.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe top clones expressing D3-54-IgG2 fusion protein based on the growth and specific production rates were selected for subcloning. Subcloning was performed by limiting dilution as described in the section above for stable pools, with the exception that puromycin was not used at any time. Expansion, screening, and evaluation of subclones were also performed as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSelected subclones were repeatedly passaged in shake flasks for approximately 90 days to evaluate production stability. At each passage, cells were seeded in 125 ml shake flasks at 1×10\n5 \nviable cells/ml in 25 ml fresh medium. The cultures were passaged every 3-4 days. Before each passage, the cell density and viability were measured and a sample was taken for product concentration determination by Protein A HPLC.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSelected clones and subclones were cryopreserved from the time of ranking by pcd values to various points in the stability evaluation. Freezing medium was freshly made with 90% growth medium and 10% DMSO (Sigma). Cells from shake flask cultures were centrifuged and resuspended in freezing medium at densities ranging from 2-10×10\n6 \ncells/ml. The cell suspension was dispensed in 1 ml aliquots into cryogenic vials. The cryogenic vials were placed in an isopropanol freezing containers and stored at −80° C. overnight. The frozen vials were transferred to liquid nitrogen vapor phase storage the following day.\n\n\n \nProduction of Mutant CTLA4-IgG2 Fusion Proteins.\n\n\n \n \n \nA cryovial containing 1 ml volume of CHO-K1 cells expressing D3-54-IgG2 fusion protein is thawed and grown in 125 ml shake flasks containing CD OptiCHO™ medium at 37° C. and 5% CO\n2 \nto a density of 5×10\n5 \nviable cells/ml. Several flasks are combined to inoculate a wave bag at 1-2×10\n5 \ncells/ml in a 5 or 10 L volume of CD OptiCHO™ medium with 4 mM glutamine. The wave bag culture is maintained in a 37° C. incubator supplemented with 5% CO\n2 \nat a rocking platform setting of 18-22 rpm and angle of 8 degrees for equipment purchased from Sartorius Stedim Biotech. The culture is sampled daily for cell count, viability, nutrient level, metabolite profile and expression level of the mutant CTLA-4-IgG2 (i.e., D3-54-IgG2) using a Protein A HPLC assay. The culture is harvested when the viability declines to ˜50% typically 9-11 days post inoculation. The cell culture material is clarified by filtration using a combination of depth filtration and sterile filtration and either used immediately for further processing or stored at 2-8° C.\n\n\n \nPurification of Mutant CTLA-4-IgG2 Fusion Proteins.\n\n\n \n \n \nMutant CTLA4-IgG2 fusion proteins (D3-54-IgG2) were purified by Protein-A affinity chromatography using an AKTA Explorer HPLC system (GE Healthcare). A mutant CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein (D3-54-IgG2) was bound to MabSelect Protein A FF columns (GE Healthcare, #17-5079-01) in PBS buffer (Invitrogen), loaded at ˜10 mg/ml of chromatography media, washed with the same buffer, eluted with 100 mM citric acid buffer (pH 4.0), and then neutralized by addition of 1/10 volume of 2M Tris base. The Protein A purified sample is further processed by diafiltration using a tangential flow filtration (TFF) system with a buffer exchange into 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe buffer exchanged protein sample is further purified by anion exchange chromatography on a Q-Sepharose column loaded at 10 mg/ml loading density. The bound protein is eluted using a 20 column volume (CV) linear NaCl gradient from 0-500 mM NaCl in 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5. Major peak fractions are pooled and the concentration is determined by measuring absorbance at 280 nm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe protein purity is confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis and the monomer content is determined using a size exclusion-HPLC method. Samples are stored in aliquots at 2-8° C. or at −20° C. for extended periods prior to use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile the foregoing invention has been described in some detail for purposes of clarity and understanding, it will be clear to one skilled in the art from a reading of this disclosure that various changes in form and detail can be made without departing from the true scope of the invention. It is understood that the materials, examples, and embodiments described herein are for illustrative purposes only and not intended to be limiting and that various modifications or changes in light thereof will be suggested to persons skilled in the art and are to be included within the spirit and purview of this application and scope of the appended claims.

Also provided are pharmaceutical compositions containing the combinations.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compound 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea free base and various salts thereof are disclosed in our earlier International patent application filed 30 Dec. 2005 claiming priority from U.S. Ser. No. 60/640,475 and GB0428552.4 as being inhibitors of Cyclin Dependent Kinases (CDK kinases), Aurora kinases and Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3 (GSK3).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProtein kinases constitute a large family of structurally related enzymes that are responsible for the control of a wide variety of signal transduction processes within the cell (Hardie, G. and Hanks, S. (1995) \nThe Protein Kinase Facts Book. I and II\n, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif.). The kinases may be categorized into families by the substrates they phosphorylate (e.g., protein-tyrosine, protein-serine/threonine, lipids, etc.). Sequence motifs have been identified that generally correspond to each of these kinase families (e.g., Hanks, S. K., Hunter, T., \nFASEB J., \n9:576-596 (1995); Knighton, et al., \nScience, \n253:407-414 (1991); Hiles, et al., \nCell, \n70:419-429 (1992); Kunz, et al., \nCell, \n73:585-596 (1993); Garcia-Bustos, et al., \nEMBO J., \n13:2352-2361 (1994)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProtein kinases may be characterized by their regulation mechanisms. These mechanisms include, for example, autophosphorylation, transphosphorylation by other kinases, protein-protein interactions, protein-lipid interactions, and protein-polynucleotide interactions. An individual protein kinase may be regulated by more than one mechanism.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nKinases regulate many different cell processes including, but not limited to, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, motility, transcription, translation and other signalling processes, by adding phosphate groups to target proteins. These phosphorylation events act as molecular on/off switches that can modulate or regulate the target protein biological function. Phosphorylation of target proteins occurs in response to a variety of extracellular signals (hormones, neurotransmitters, growth and differentiation factors, etc.), cell cycle events, environmental or nutritional stresses, etc. The appropriate protein kinase functions in signalling pathways to activate or inactivate (either directly or indirectly), for example, a metabolic enzyme, regulatory protein, receptor, cytoskeletal protein, ion channel or pump, or transcription factor. Uncontrolled signalling due to defective control of protein phosphorylation has been implicated in a number of diseases, including, for example, inflammation, cancer, allergy/asthma, diseases and conditions of the immune system, diseases and conditions of the central nervous system, and angiogenesis.\n\n\n \nCyclin Dependent Kinases\n\n\n \n \n \nThe process of eukaryotic cell division may be broadly divided into a series of sequential phases termed G1, S, G2 and M. Correct progression through the various phases of the cell cycle has been shown to be critically dependent upon the spatial and temporal regulation of a family of proteins known as cyclin dependent kinases (cdks) and a diverse set of their cognate protein partners termed cyclins. Cdks are cdc2 (also known as cdk1) homologous serine-threonine kinase proteins that are able to utilise ATP as a substrate in the phosphorylation of diverse polypeptides in a sequence dependent context. Cyclins are a family of proteins characterised by a homology region, containing approximately 100 amino acids, termed the “cyclin box” which is used in binding to, and defining selectivity for, specific cdk partner proteins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModulation of the expression levels, degradation rates, and activation levels of various cdks and cyclins throughout the cell cycle leads to the cyclical formation of a series of cdk/cyclin complexes, in which the cdks are enzymatically active. The formation of these complexes controls passage through discrete cell cycle checkpoints and thereby enables the process of cell division to continue. Failure to satisfy the pre-requisite biochemical criteria at a given cell cycle checkpoint, i.e. failure to form a required cdk/cyclin complex, can lead to cell cycle arrest and/or cellular apoptosis. Aberrant cellular proliferation, as manifested in cancer, can often be attributed to loss of correct cell cycle control. Inhibition of cdk enzymatic activity therefore provides a means by which abnormally dividing cells can have their division arrested and/or be killed. The diversity of cdks, and cdk complexes, and their critical roles in mediating the cell cycle, provides a broad spectrum of potential therapeutic targets selected on the basis of a defined biochemical rationale.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProgression from the G1 phase to the S phase of the cell cycle is primarily regulated by cdk2, cdk3, cdk4 and cdk6 via association with members of the D and E type cyclins. The D-type cyclins appear instrumental in enabling passage beyond the G1 restriction point, where as the cdk2/cyclin E complex is key to the transition from the G1 to S phase. Subsequent progression through S phase and entry into G2 is thought to require the cdk2/cyclin A complex. Both mitosis, and the G2 to M phase transition which triggers it, are regulated by complexes of cdk1 and the A and B type cyclins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDuring G1 phase Retinoblastoma protein (Rb), and related pocket proteins such as p130, are substrates for cdk(2, 4, & 6)/cyclin complexes. Progression through G1 is in part facilitated by hyperphosphorylation, and thus inactivation, of Rb and p130 by the cdk(4/6)/cyclin-D complexes. Hyperphosphorylation of Rb and p130 causes the release of transcription factors, such as E2F, and thus the expression of genes necessary for progression through G1 and for entry into S-phase, such as the gene for cyclin E. Expression of cyclin E facilitates formation of the cdk2/cyclin E complex which amplifies, or maintains, E2F levels via further phosphorylation of Rb. The cdk2/cyclin E complex also phosphorylates other proteins necessary for DNA replication, such as NPAT, which has been implicated in histone biosynthesis. G1 progression and the G1/S transition are also regulated via the mitogen stimulated Myc pathway, which feeds into the cdk2/cyclin E pathway. Cdk2 is also connected to the p53 mediated DNA damage response pathway via p53 regulation of p21 levels. p21 is a protein inhibitor of cdk2/cyclin E and is thus capable of blocking, or delaying, the G1/S transition. The cdk2/cyclin E complex may thus represent a point at which biochemical stimuli from the Rb, Myc and p53 pathways are to some degree integrated. Cdk2 and/or the cdk2/cyclin E complex therefore represent good targets for therapeutics designed at arresting, or recovering control of, the cell cycle in aberrantly dividing cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe exact role of cdk3 in the cell cycle is not clear. As yet no cognate cyclin partner has been identified, but a dominant negative form of cdk3 delayed cells in G1, thereby suggesting that cdk3 has a role in regulating the G1/S transition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough most cdks have been implicated in regulation of the cell cycle there is evidence that certain members of the cdk family are involved in other biochemical processes. This is exemplified by cdk5 which is necessary for correct neuronal development and which has also been implicated in the phosphorylation of several neuronal proteins such as Tau, NUDE-1, synapsin1, DARPP32 and the Munc18/Syntaxin1A complex. Neuronal cdk5 is conventionally activated by binding to the p35/p39 proteins. Cdk5 activity can, however, be deregulated by the binding of p25, a truncated version of p35. Conversion of p35 to p25, and subsequent deregulation of cdk5 activity, can be induced by ischemia, excitotoxicity, and β-amyloid peptide. Consequently p25 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, and is therefore of interest as a target for therapeutics directed against these diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCdk7 is a nuclear protein that has cdc2 CAK activity and binds to cyclin H. Cdk7 has been identified as component of the TFIIH transcriptional complex which has RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain (CTD) activity. This has been associated with the regulation of HIV-1 transcription via a Tat-mediated biochemical pathway. Cdk8 binds cyclin C and has been implicated in the phosphorylation of the CTD of RNA polymerase II. Similarly the cdk9/cyclin-T1 complex (P-TEFb complex) has been implicated in elongation control of RNA polymerase II. PTEF-b is also required for activation of transcription of the HIV-1 genome by the viral transactivator Tat through its interaction with cyclin T1. Cdk7, cdk8, cdk9 and the P-TEFb complex are therefore potential targets for anti-viral therapeutics.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt a molecular level mediation of cdk/cyclin complex activity requires a series of stimulatory and inhibitory phosphorylation, or dephosphorylation, events. Cdk phosphorylation is performed by a group of cdk activating kinases (CAKs) and/or kinases such as wee1, Myt1 and Mik1. Dephosphorylation is performed by phosphatases such as cdc25(a & c), pp2a, or KAP.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCdk/cyclin complex activity may be further regulated by two families of endogenous cellular proteinaceous inhibitors: the Kip/Cip family, or the INK family. The INK proteins specifically bind cdk4 and cdk6. p16\nink4 \n(also known as MTS1) is a potential tumour suppressor gene that is mutated, or deleted, in a large number of primary cancers. The Kip/Cip family contains proteins such as p21\nCip1,Waf1\n, p27\nKip1 \nand p57\nkip2\n. As discussed previously p21 is induced by p53 and is able to inactivate the cdk2/cyclin(E/A) and cdk4/cyclin(D1/D2/D3) complexes. Atypically low levels of p27 expression have been observed in breast, colon and prostate cancers. Conversely over expression of cyclin E in solid tumours has been shown to correlate with poor patient prognosis. Over expression of cyclin D1 has been associated with oesophageal, breast, squamous, and non-small cell lung carcinomas.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pivotal roles of cdks, and their associated proteins, in co-ordinating and driving the cell cycle in proliferating cells have been outlined above. Some of the biochemical pathways in which cdks play a key role have also been described. The development of monotherapies for the treatment of proliferative disorders, such as cancers, using therapeutics targeted generically at cdks, or at specific cdks, is therefore potentially highly desirable. Cdk inhibitors could conceivably also be used to treat other conditions such as viral infections, autoimmune diseases and neuro-degenerative diseases, amongst others. Cdk targeted therapeutics may also provide clinical benefits in the treatment of the previously described diseases when used in combination therapy with either existing, or new, therapeutic agents. Cdk targeted anticancer therapies could potentially have advantages over many current antitumour agents as they would not directly interact with DNA and should therefore reduce the risk of secondary tumour development.\n\n\n \nDiffuse Large B-Cell Lymphomas (DLBCL)\n\n\n \n \n \nCell cycle progression is regulated by the combined action of cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and CDK-inhibitors (CDKi), which are negative cell cycle regulators. p27KIP1 is a CDKi key in cell cycle regulation, whose degradation is required for G1/S transition. In spite of the absence of p27KIP1 expression in proliferating lymphocytes, some aggressive B-cell lymphomas have been reported to show an anomalous p27KIP1 staining. An abnormally high expression of p27KIP1 was found in lymphomas of this type. Analysis of the clinical relevance of these findings showed that a high level of p27KIP1 expression in this type of tumour is an adverse prognostic marker, in both univariate and multivariate analysis. These results show that there is abnormal p27KIP1 expression in Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphomas (DLBCL), with adverse clinical significance, suggesting that this anomalous p27KIP1 protein may be rendered non-functional through interaction with other cell cycle regulator proteins. (Br. J. Cancer. 1999 July; 80(9):1427-34. p27KIP1 is abnormally expressed in Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphomas and is associated with an adverse clinical outcome.

Department of Pathology, Virgen de la Salud Hospital, Toledo, Spain.)\n\n\n \nChronic Lymphocytic Leukemia\n\n\n \n \n \nB-Cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most common leukaemia in the Western hemisphere, with approximately 10,000 new cases diagnosed each year (Parker S L, Tong T, Bolden S, Wingo P A: Cancer statistics, 1997. Ca. Cancer. J. Clin. 47:5, (1997)). Relative to other forms of leukaemia, the overall prognosis of CLL is good, with even the most advanced stage patients having a median survival of 3 years.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe addition of fludarabine as initial therapy for symptomatic CLL patients has led to a higher rate of complete responses (27% v 3%) and duration of progression-free survival (33 v 17 months) as compared with previously used alkylator-based therapies. Although attaining a complete clinical response after therapy is the initial step toward improving survival in CLL, the majority of patients either do not attain complete remission or fail to respond to fludarabine. Furthermore, all patients with CLL treated with fludarabine eventually relapse, making its role as a single agent purely palliative (Ral K R, Peterson B, Elias L, Shepherd L, Hines J, Nelson D, Cheson B, Kolitz J, Schiffer C A: A randomized comparison of fludarabine and chlorambucil for patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia. A CALGB SWOG, CTG/NCI-C and ECOG Inter-Group Study. Blood 88:141a, 1996 (abstr 552, suppl 1). Therefore, identifying new agents with novel mechanisms of action that complement fludarabine's cytotoxicity and abrogate the resistance induced by intrinsic CLL drug-resistance factors will be necessary if further advances in the therapy of this disease are to be realized.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe most extensively studied, uniformly predictive factor for poor response to therapy and inferior survival in CLL patients is aberrant p53 function, as characterized by point mutations or chromosome 17p13 deletions. Indeed, virtually no responses to either alkylator or purine analog therapy have been documented in multiple single institution case series for those CLL patients with abnormal p53 function. Introduction of a therapeutic agent that has the ability to overcome the drug resistance associated with p53 mutation in CLL would potentially be a major advance for the treatment of the disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFlavopiridol and CYC 202, inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases induce in vitro apoptosis of malignant cells from B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFlavopiridol exposure results in the stimulation of caspase 3 activity and in caspase-dependent cleavage of p27(kip1), a negative regulator of the cell cycle, which is overexpressed in B-CLL (Blood. 1998 Nov. 15; 92(10):3804-16 Flavopiridol induces apoptosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells via activation of caspase-3 without evidence of bcl-2 modulation or dependence on functional p53.

Aurora kinases are located at the centrosomes of interphase cells, at the poles of the bipolar spindle and in the mid-body of the mitotic apparatus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThree members of the Aurora kinase family have been found in mammals so far (E. A. Nigg, \nNat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. \n2: 21-32, (2001)). These are:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAurora A (also referred to in the literature as Aurora 2);\n \nAurora B (also referred to in the literature as Aurora 1); and\n \nAurora C (also referred to in the literature as Aurora 3).\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe Aurora kinases have highly homologous catalytic domains but differ considerably in their N-terminal portions (Katayama H, Brinkley W R, Sen S.; The Aurora kinases: role in cell transformation and tumorigenesis; Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2003 December; 22(4):451-64).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe substrates of the Aurora kinases A and B have been identified as including a kinesin-like motor protein, spindle apparatus proteins, histone H3 protein, kinetochore protein and the tumour suppressor protein p53.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAurora A kinases are believed to be involved in spindle formation and become localised on the centrosome during the early G2 phase where they phosphorylate spindle-associated proteins (Prigent et al., \nCell, \n114: 531-535 (2003). Hirota et al, Cell, 114:585-598, (2003) found that cells depleted of Aurora A protein kinase were unable to enter mitosis. Furthermore, it has been found (Adams, 2001) that mutation or disruption of the Aurora A gene in various species leads to mitotic abnormalities, including centrosome separation and maturation defects, spindle aberrations and chromosome segregation defects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Aurora kinases are generally expressed at a low level in the majority of normal tissues, the exceptions being tissues with a high proportion of dividing cells such as the thymus and testis. However, elevated levels of Aurora kinases have been found in many human cancers (Giet et al., \nJ. Cell. Sci. \n112: 3591-361, (1999) and Katayama (2003). Furthermore, Aurora A kinase maps to the chromosome 20q13 region that has frequently been found to be amplified in many human cancers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, for example, significant Aurora A over-expression has been detected in human breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancers (see Zhou et al, \nNat. Genet. \n20: 189-193, (1998), Tanaka et al., \nCancer Res., \n59: 2041-2044, (1999) and Han at al., \ncancer Res., \n62: 2890-2896, (2002).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMoreover, Isola, \nAmerican Journal of Pathology \n147, 905-911 (1995) has reported that amplification of the Aurora A locus (20ql3) correlates with poor prognosis for patients with node-negative breast cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmplification and/or over-expression of Aurora-A is observed in human bladder cancers and amplification of Aurora-A is associated with aneuploidy and aggressive clinical behaviour, see Sen et al., \nJ. Natl. Cancer Inst, \n94: 1320-1329 (2002).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nElevated expression of Aurora-A has been detected in over 50% of colorectal cancers, (see Bischoff et al., \nEMBO J., \n17: 3052-3065, (1998) and Takahashi et al., \nJpn. J. Cancer Res., \n91: 1007-1014 (2000)) ovarian cancers (see Gritsko et al. \nClin. Cancer Res., \n9: 1420-1426 (2003), and gastric tumours Sakakura et al., \nBritish Journal of Cancer, \n84: 824-831 (2001).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTanaka et al. \nCancer Research, \n59: 2041-2044 (1999) found evidence of over-expression of Aurora A in 94% of invasive duct adenocarcinomas of the breast.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHigh levels of Aurora A kinase have also been found in renal, cervical, neuroblastoma, melanoma, lymphoma, pancreatic and prostate tumour cell lines Bischoff et al. (1998), EMBO J., 17: 3052-3065 (1998); Kimura et al. J. Biol. Chem., 274: 7334-7340 (1999); Zhou et al., Nature Genetics, 20: 189-193 (1998); Li et al., Clin Cancer Res. 9 (3): 991-7 (2003)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAurora-B is highly expressed in multiple human tumour cell lines, including leukemic cells [Katayama et al., Gene 244: 1-7)]. Levels of this enzyme increase as a function of Duke's stage in primary colorectal cancers [Katayama et al., J. Natl Cancer Inst., 91: 1160-1162 (1999)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHigh levels of Aurora-3 (Aurora-C) have been detected in several tumour cell lines, even though this kinase tends to be restricted to germ cells in normal tissues (see Kimura at al. \nJournal of Biological Chemistry, \n274: 7334-7340 (1999)). Over-expression of Aurora-3 in approximately 50% of colorectal cancers has also been reported in the article by Takahashi et al., \nJpn J. Cancer Res. \n91: 1007-1014 (2001)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther reports of the role of Aurora kinases in proliferative disorders may be found in Bischoff et al., \nTrends in Cell Biology \n9: 454-459 (1999); Giet et al. \nJournal of Cell Science, \n112: 3591-3601 (1999) and Dutertre, et al. \nOncogene, \n21: 6175-6183 (2002).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRoyce et al report that the expression of the \nAurora\n 2 gene (known as STK15 or BTAK) has been noted in approximately one-fourth of primary breast tumours. (Royce M E, Xia W, Sahin A A, Katayama H, Johnston D A, Hortobagyi G, Sen S, Hung M C; STK15/Aurora-A expression in primary breast tumours is correlated with nuclear grade but not with prognosis; \nCancer. \n2004 Jan. 1; 100(1):12-9).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEndometrial carcinoma (EC) comprises at least two types of cancer: endometrioid carcinomas (EECs) are estrogen-related tumours, which are frequently euploid and have a good prognosis. Nonendometrioid carcinomas (NEECs; serous and clear cell forms) are not estrogen related, are frequently aneuploid, and are clinically aggressive. It has also been found that Aurora was amplified in 55.5% of NEECs but not in any EECs (P< or =0.001) (Moreno-Bueno G, Sanchez-Estevez C, Cassia R, Rodriguez-Perales S, Diaz-Uriarte R, Dominguez O, Hardisson D, Andujar M, Prat J, Matias-Guiu X, Cigudosa J C, Palacios \nJ. Cancer Res. \n2003 Sep. 15; 63(18):5697-702).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReichardt et al (\nOncol Rep. \n2003 September-October; 10(5):1275-9) have reported that quantitative DNA analysis by PCR to search for Aurora amplification in gliomas revealed that five out of 16 tumours (31%) of different WHO grade (1× grade II, 1× grade III, 3× grade IV) showed DNA amplification of the \nAurora\n 2 gene. It was hypothesized that amplification of the \nAurora\n 2 gene may be a non-random genetic alteration in human gliomas playing a role in the genetic pathways of tumourigenesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults by Hamada et al (\nBr. J. Haematol. \n2003 May; 121(3):439-47) also suggest that \nAurora\n 2 is an effective candidate to indicate not only disease activity but also tumourigenesis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Retardation of tumour cell growth resulting from the restriction of this gene's functions could be a therapeutic approach for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a study by Gritsko et al (\nClin Cancer Res. \n2003 April; 9(4):1420-6)), the kinase activity and protein levels of Aurora A were examined in 92 patients with primary ovarian tumours. In vitro kinase analyses revealed elevated Aurora A kinase activity in 44 cases (48%). Increased Aurora A protein levels were detected in 52 (57%) specimens. High protein levels of Aurora A correlated well with elevated kinase activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults obtained by Li et al (\nClin. Cancer Res. \n2003 March; 9(3):991-7) showed that the Aurora A gene is overexpressed in pancreatic tumours and carcinoma cell lines and suggest that overexpression of Aurora A may play a role in pancreatic carcinogenesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilarly, it has been shown that Aurora A gene amplification and associated increased expression of the mitotic kinase it encodes are associated with aneuploidy and aggressive clinical behaviour in human bladder cancer. (\nJ. Natl. Cancer Inst. \n2002 Sep. 4; 94(17):1320-9).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInvestigation by several groups (Dutertre S, Prigent C., Aurora-A overexpression leads to override of the microtubule-kinetochore attachment checkpoint; \nMol. Interv. \n2003 May; 3(3):127-30 and Anand S, Penrhyn-Lowe S, Venkitaraman A R., Aurora-A amplification overrides the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint, inducing resistance to Taxol, \nCancer Cell. \n2003 January; 3(1):51-62) suggests that overexpression of Aurora kinase activity is associated with resistance to some current cancer therapies. For example overexpression of Aurora A in mouse embryo fibroblasts can reduce the sensitivity of these cells to the cytotoxic effects of taxane derivatives. Therefore Aurora kinase inhibitors may find particular use in patients who have developed resistance to existing therapies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOn the basis of work carried out to date, it is apparent that inhibition of Aurora kinases, particularly Aurora kinase A and Aurora kinase B, will prove an effective means of arresting tumour development.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHarrington et al (\nNat. Med. \n2004 March; 10(3):262-7) have demonstrated that an inhibitor of the Aurora kinases suppresses tumour growth and induces tumour regression in vivo. In the study, the Aurora kinase inhibitor blocked cancer cell proliferation, and also triggered cell death in a range of cancer cell lines including leukaemic, colorectal and breast cell lines. In addition, it has shown potential for the treatment of leukemia by inducing apoptosis in leukemia cells. VX-680 potently killed treatment-refractory primary Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) cells from patients (Andrews, \nOncogene, \n2005, 24, 5005-5015).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecent reports indicate that Aurora kinases A and B are overexpressed in human leukaemia cells and that a small molecule Aurora kinase inhibitor is active against the growth of primary acute myeloid cells in vitro (Harrington et al, 2004). Moreover it has recently been reported that the product of the PML gene that is disrupted in acute promyelocytic leukaemia by a t(15:17) translocation (PML3), interacts with Aurora A and suppresses its kinase activity. Further evidence is emerging that PML is a tumor suppressor and that its disruption is not limited to leukaemias but may also be common in lymphomas and some solid tumors (Xu et al, \nMolecular Cell \n17: 721-732, 2005).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCancers which may be particularly amenable to Aurora inhibitors include breast, bladder, colorectal, pancreatic, ovarian, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, gliomas and nonendometrioid endometrial carcinomas. Leukemias particularly amenable to Aurora inhibitors include Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML), chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML), B-cell lymphoma (Mantle cell), and Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). Further leukemias include acute promyelocytic leukaemia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOverexpression of Aurora kinase A has been identified as an independent predictor of poor prognosis in patients with medulloblastoma, a highly malignant primitive neuroectodermal tumor of the cerebellum (Neben et al., \nCancer Research, \n64: 3103-3111 (2004).\n\n\n \nGlycogen Synthase Kinase\n\n\n \n \n \nGlycogen Synthase Kinase-3 (GSK3) is a serine-threonine kinase that occurs as two ubiquitously expressed isoforms in humans (GSK3α & beta GSK3β). GSK3 has been implicated as having roles in embryonic development, protein synthesis, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, microtubule dynamics, cell motility and cellular apoptosis. As such GSK3 has been implicated in the progression of disease states such as diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, epilepsy, motor neuron disease and/or head trauma. Phylogenetically GSK3 is most closely related to the cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe consensus peptide substrate sequence recognised by GSK3 is (Ser/Thr)-X-X-X-(pSer/pThr), where X is any amino acid (at positions (n+1), (n+2), (n+3)) and pSer and pThr are phospho-serine and phospho-threonine respectively (n+4). GSK3 phosphorylates the first serine, or threonine, at position (n). Phospho-serine, or phospho-threonine, at the (n+4) position appear necessary for priming GSK3 to give maximal substrate turnover. Phosphorylation of GSK3α at Ser21, or GSK313 at Ser9, leads to inhibition of GSK3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMutagenesis and peptide competition studies have led to the model that the phosphorylated N-terminus of GSK3 is able to compete with phospho-peptide substrate (S/TXXXpS/pT) via an autoinhibitory mechanism. There are also data suggesting that GSK3α and GSK3 may be subtly regulated by phosphorylation of tyrosines 279 and 216 respectively. Mutation of these residues to a Phe caused a reduction in in vivo kinase activity. The X-ray crystallographic structure of GSK33 has helped to shed light on all aspects of GSK3 activation and regulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGSK3 forms part of the mammalian insulin response pathway and is able to phosphorylate, and thereby inactivate, glycogen synthase. Upregulation of glycogen synthase activity, and thereby glycogen synthesis, through inhibition of GSK3, has thus been considered a potential means of combating type II, or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM): a condition in which body tissues become resistant to insulin stimulation. The cellular insulin response in liver, adipose, or muscle tissues, is triggered by insulin binding to an extracellular insulin receptor. This causes the phosphorylation, and subsequent recruitment to the plasma membrane, of the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins. Further phosphorylation of the IRS proteins initiates recruitment of phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) to the plasma membrane where it is able to liberate the second messenger phosphatidylinosityl 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). This facilitates co-localisation of 3-phosphoinositide-dedependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) and protein kinase B (PKB or Akt) to the membrane, where PDK1 activates PKB. PKB is able to phosphorylate, and thereby inhibit, GSK3α and/or GSKβ through phosphorylation of Ser9, or ser21, respectively. The inhibition of GSK3 then triggers upregulation of glycogen synthase activity. Therapeutic agents able to inhibit GSK3 may thus be able to induce cellular responses akin to those seen on insulin stimulation. A further in vivo substrate of GSK3 is the eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation factor 2B (eIF2B). eIF2B is inactivated via phosphorylation and is thus able to suppress protein biosynthesis. Inhibition of GSK3, e.g. by inactivation of the “mammalian target of rapamycin” protein (mTOR), can thus upregulate protein biosynthesis. Finally there is some evidence for regulation of GSK3 activity via the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway through phosphorylation of GSK3 by kinases such as mitogen activated protein kinase activated protein kinase 1 (MAPKAP-K1 or RSK). These data suggest that GSK3 activity may be modulated by mitogenic, insulin and/or amino acid stimuli.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt has also been shown that GSK36 is a key component in the vertebrate Wnt signalling pathway. This biochemical pathway has been shown to be critical for normal embryonic development and regulates cell proliferation in normal tissues. GSK3 becomes inhibited in response to Wnt stimuli. This can lead to the de-phosphorylation of GSK3 substrates such as Axin, the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene product and β-catenin. Aberrant regulation of the Wnt pathway has been associated with many cancers. Mutations in APC, and/or β-catenin, are common in colorectal cancer and other tumours. β-catenin has also been shown to be of importance in cell adhesion. Thus GSK3 may also modulate cellular adhesion processes to some degree. Apart from the biochemical pathways already described there are also data implicating GSK3 in the regulation of cell division via phosphorylation of cyclin-D1, in the phosphorylation of transcription factors such as c-Jun, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (C/EBPα), c-Myc and/or other substrates such as Nuclear Factor of Activated T-cells (NFATc), Heat Shock Factor-1 (HSF-1) and the c-AMP response element binding protein (CREB). GSK3 also appears to play a role, albeit tissue specific, in regulating cellular apoptosis. The role of GSK3 in modulating cellular apoptosis, via a pro-apoptotic mechanism, may be of particular relevance to medical conditions in which neuronal apoptosis can occur. Examples of these are head trauma, stroke, epilepsy, Alzheimer's and motor neuron diseases, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, and Pick's disease. In vitro it has been shown that GSK3 is able to hyper-phosphorylate the microtubule associated protein Tau. Hyperphosphorylation of Tau disrupts its normal binding to microtubules and may also lead to the formation of intra-cellular Tau filaments. It is believed that the progressive accumulation of these filaments leads to eventual neuronal dysfunction and degeneration. Inhibition of Tau phosphorylation, through inhibition of GSK3, may thus provide a means of limiting and/or preventing neurodegenerative effects.\n\n\n \nC-Abl\n\n\n \n \n \nA chromosomal translocation event which fuses a BCR encoded sequence to a truncated c-abl gene greatly increases c-abl's tyrosine kinase activity and is the transforming agent in 95% of all Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia (CML) patients. This translocation occurs between chromosomes 9 and 22 resulting in an altered chromosome 22, the Philadelphia (Ph+) chromosome, which can be distinguished by cytogenetic methods. The fusion of BCR and Abl gene sequences results in the oligomerization of the Bcr-Abl gene product, increased trans-autophosphorylation and activation. An auto-inhibitory domain of the c-abl protein is also deleted as a result of the gene fusion. The sub-cellular localization of c-abl is also affected as a result of the gene fusion. The oncogenic effects of Bcr-Abl are complicated, but are believed to involve induction of G1 to S phase transition through activation of Ras, Erk and Jun pathways. Bcr-Abl also affects cell survival through the PI3K/Akt pathway. The oncogenic effects of Bcr-Abl have been demonstrated in animal models which indicate that the Bcr-Abl protein is able to establish CML symptoms in mice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCML is a fatal disease, which progresses through three stages: chronic phase, accelerated phase, and blast crisis. CML is characterized in early stages by the proliferation of terminally differentiated neutrophils. As the disease progresses an excessive number of myeloid or lymphoid progenitor cells are produced. This chronic phase of the disease may last for years before advancing to an acute blast stage, characterized by multiple additional genetic mutations. CML primarily affects adults who have a mean survival of 5 years after the disease is manifested. CML has been successfully treated in early phases by an ATP competitive inhibitor of c-abl, imatinib (Gleevec). A 95% remission rate was demonstrated for this drug in a phase I clinical trial. Durable responses to imatinib have been observed for CML patients in the chronic phase, however remissions in blast phase only last 2-6 months. Unfortunately the development of acquired resistance to imatinib in CML patients is estimated to be as high as 15%/year.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nKinase domain mutations in BCR-ABL represent the most common mechanism of acquired resistance to imatinib, occurring in 50%-90% of cases. The most common cause of imatinib resistance is through the development of point mutations in the c-abl kinase domain, which directly or indirectly affect imatinib binding. More than 25 distinct Abl kinase domain mutations have been identified in imatinib treated CML patients and are associated with clinical resistance to imatinib (Hematology Shah 2005 (1): 183). These mutations have varying degrees of sensitivity to imatinib. Imatinib has been shown to bind to the ABL kinase domain in the inactive, or closed, conformation and to induce a variety of conformational changes to the protein upon binding. While some resistance-associated mutations occur at amino acid positions implicated in directly contacting imatinib, the majority are felt to prevent the kinase domain from adopting the specific conformation to which imatinib binds. Studies have shown that some mutations confer only a moderate degree of resistance, and as a result, dose escalation is predicted to recapture responses in some cases. Co-administration of second generation BCR-ABL inhibitors (e.g. BMS354825, AMN-107) have been shown to effectively inhibit many imatinib resistant c-abl mutants. However there are no drugs in the clinic which have been shown to be efficacious against the most imatinib resistant c-abl mutation, T315I.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Philadelphia chromosome is also found in a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). It seems highly probable that this form of ALL is due to the same chromosomal and molecular mechanisms as CML.\n\n\n \nFMS-Like Tyrosine-Kinase 3 (FLT3)\n\n\n \n \n \nFLT3 (short for fms-like tyrosine-kinase 3) is a class III receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) structurally related to the receptors for platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF1), and KIT ligand (KL). FLT3 contains an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain split in two by a specific hydrophilic insertion termed a kinase insert.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFLT3 and its specific ligand FLT3-ligand (FL) plays a role in regulation of haematopoietic progenitor cells and is expressed on haematopoietic cells including CD34-positive bone marrow cells, corresponding to multipotential, myeloid and B-lymphoid progenitor cells, and on monocytic cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nActivating mutations of FLT3 are one of the most frequent mutations observed in acute myeloid leukaemia. The most frequent mutations are referred to as length mutations (LM) or internal tandem duplications (ITD) and consist of a duplicated sequence or insert belonging to exon 11 and sometimes involving intron 11 and exon 12.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInternal tandem duplications and/or insertions and, rarely, deletions in the FLT3-gene are implicated in 20-25% of all acute myeloid leukemias (AML) and 5-10% myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and some cases with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe mutation of the FLT3 protein causes constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinase activity due to disruption of a negative regulatory domain. This activation results in stimulation of several growth factor dependent pathways including the raf-MEK-ERK pathway and contributes to the growth and survival of the leukaemic cells. Thus inhibition of the kinase activity of FLT3 would be an effective treatment for diseases such as those described above which are dependent upon the FLT3 activity.\n\n\n \n3-Phosphoinositide-Dependent Protein Kinase-1 (PDK1)\n\n\n \n \n \nThe 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) plays a key role in regulating the activity of a number of kinases belonging to the AGC subfamily of protein kinases (Alessi, D. et al., Biochem. Soc. Trans, 29, p1-14, 2001). These include protein kinase B (PKB/AKT), p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K) (Avruch, J. et al., Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol., 2001, p115-154, 2001) and p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (Frodin, M. et al., EMBO J., 19, p2924-2934, 2000). Kinase activity of serum and glucocordicoid regulated kinase (SGK) can also be phosphorylated and activated by PDK-1. Other potential substrates include protein kinase C, cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), PRK1 and Protein kinase G.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPDK1 mediated signalling is activated in response to insulin and growth factors and as a consequence of attachment of the cell to the extracellular matrix (integrin signalling). Once activated these enzymes mediate many diverse cellular events by phosphorylating key regulatory proteins that play important roles controlling processes such as cell survival, growth, proliferation and glucose regulation (Lawlor, M. A. et al., J. Cell Sci., 114, p2903-2910, 2001), (Lawlor, M. A. et al., EMBO J., 21, p3728-3738, 2002). PDK-1 inhibitors therefore may provide novel therapeutic treatment for diseases such as diabetes and cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPDK1 is a 556 amino acid protein, with an N-terminal catalytic domain and a C-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which activates its substrates by phosphorylating these kinases at their activation loop (Belham, C. et al., Curr. Biol., 9, pR93-96, 1999). Many human cancers including prostate and NSCL have elevated PDK1 signalling pathway function resulting from a number of distinct genetic events such as PTEN mutations or over-expression of certain key regulatory proteins [(Graff, J. R., Expert Opin. Ther. Targets, 6, p103-13, 2002), (Brognard, J., et al., Cancer Res., 61 p3986-97, 2001)]. Inhibition of PDK1 as a potential mechanism to treat cancer was demonstrated by transfection of a PTEN negative human cancer cell line (IJ87MG) with antisense oligonucleotides directed against PDK1. The resulting decrease in PDK1 protein levels led to a reduction in cellular proliferation and survival (Flynn, P., et al., Curr. Biol., 10, p1439-42, 2000). Therefore inhibition of PDK-1 could offer an attractive target for cancer therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPDK-1-mediated phosphorylation of PKB/AKT, which is largely present in an inactive form in unstimulated cells, converts the enzyme to a catalytically active form. This occurs through the phosphorylation of the activation loop domain of AKT at threonine-309 in AKT2 and theonine-308 in AKT1. Although AKT displays low, basal levels of activation in normal, unstimulated cells, AKT often becomes constitutively activated in tumor cells. This occurs through the up-regulation of a variety of different signalling molecules or the presence of oncogenenic mutations commonly found in cancer cells that can promote the activation of AKT, such as PI-3 kinase, growth factor receptors (e.g., EGFR family members), Ras, Src, and BCR-ABL activation. Loss of the tumor suppressor PTEN is another means of greatly increasing AKT activity in cancer cells (Besson, A. et al., Eur. J. Biochem. (1999), Vol. 263, No. 3, pp. 605-611). PTEN mutation or down regulation of PTEN protein is found in a large number of tumors and cancer cell lines. PTEN is a phosphatase that removes the D-3 phosphate from the products of PI-3 kinase such as phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and phosphatidylinosito13,4-bisphosphate (Myers, M. P. et al., Proc. Natl. Mad. Sci. USA (1998), Vol. 95, No. 23, pp. 13513-13518; Stambolic, V. et al., Cell (1998), Vol. 95 p29-39). Loss of PTEN, therefore has the effect of increasing products of PI-3 kinase and promoting constitutive activation of AKT. Cancers with highly upregulated levels of AKT may be especially sensitive to the effects of PDK-1/AKT pathway inhibitors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore PDK1 is a critical mediator of the PI3K signalling pathway, which regulates a multitude of cellular function including growth, proliferation and survival. Consequently, inhibition of this pathway affects many defining requirements for cancer progression, so that a PDK1 inhibitor has an effect on the growth of a very wide range of human cancers.\n\n\n \nVascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGFR)\n\n\n \n \n \nChronic proliferative diseases are often accompanied by profound angiogenesis, which can contribute to or maintain an inflammatory and/or proliferative state, or which leads to tissue destruction through the invasive proliferation of blood vessels. (Folkman, EXS, 79, 1-81 (1997); Folkman, \nNature Medicine, \n1, 27-31 (1995); Folkman and Shing, \nJ. Biol. Chem., \n267, 10931 (1992)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAngiogenesis is generally used to describe the development of new or replacement blood vessels, or neovascularisation. It is a necessary and physiological normal process by which vasculature is established in the embryo. Angiogenesis does not occur, in general, in most normal adult tissues, exceptions being sites of ovulation, menses and wound healing. Many diseases, however, are characterized by persistent and unregulated angiogenesis. For instance, in arthritis, new capillary blood vessels invade the joint and destroy cartilage (Colville-Nash and Scott, \nAnn. Rhum. Dis., \n51, 919 (1992)). In diabetes (and in many different eye diseases), new vessels invade the macula or retina or other ocular structures, and may cause blindness (Brooks, et al., \nCell, \n79, 1157 (1994)). The process of atherosclerosis has been linked to angiogenesis (Kahlon, et al., \nCan. J. Cardiol, \n8, 60 (1992)). Tumor growth and metastasis have been found to be angiogenesis-dependent (Folkman, \nCancer Biol, \n3, 65 (1992); Denekamp, \nBr. J. Rad., \n66, 181 (1993); Fidler and Ellis, \nCell, \n79, 185 (1994)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe recognition of the involvement of angiogenesis in major diseases has been accompanied by research to identify and develop inhibitors of angiogenesis. These inhibitors are generally classified in response to discrete targets in the angiogenesis cascade, such as activation of endothelial cells by an angiogenic signal; synthesis and release of degradative enzymes; endothelial cell migration; proliferation of endothelial cells; and formation of capillary tubules. Therefore, angiogenesis occurs in many stages and attempts are underway to discover and develop compounds that work to block angiogenesis at these various stages.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are publications that teach that inhibitors of angiogenesis, working by diverse mechanisms, are beneficial in diseases such as cancer and metastasis (O'Reilly, et al, \nCell, \n79, 315 (1994); Ingber, et al., \nNature, \n348, 555 (1990)), ocular diseases (Friedlander, et al., \nScience, \n270, 1500 (1995)), arthritis (Peacock, et al., \nJ. Exp. Med., \n175, 1135 (1992); Peacock et al, \nCell. Immun., \n160, 178 (1995)) and hemangioma (Taraboletti, et al., \nJ. Natl. Cancer Inst., \n87, 293 (1995)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReceptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are important in the transmission of biochemical signals across the plasma membrane of cells. These transmembrane molecules characteristically consist of an extracellular ligand-binding domain connected through a segment in the plasma membrane to an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Binding of ligand to the receptor results in stimulation of the receptor-associated tyrosine kinase activity that leads to phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on both the receptor and other intracellular proteins, leading to a variety of cellular responses. To date, at least nineteen distinct RTK subfamilies, defined by amino acid sequence homology, have been identified.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a polypeptide, is mitogenic for endothelial cells in vitro and stimulates angiogenic responses in vivo. VEGF has also been linked to inappropriate angiogenesis (Pinedo, H. M., et al., \nThe Oncologist, \n5(90001), 1-2 (2000)). VEGFR(s) are protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs). PTKs catalyze the phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in proteins involved in cell function thus regulating cell growth, survival and differentiation. (Wilks, A. F., \nProgress in Growth Factor Research, \n2, 97-111 (1990); Courtneidge, S. A., \nDev. Suppl., \n57-64 (1993); Cooper, J. A., \nSemin. Cell Biol., \n5(6), 377-387 (1994); Paulson, R. F., \nSemin. Immunol, \n7(4), 267-277 (1995); Chan, A. C., \nCurr. Opin. Immunol, \n8(3), 394-401 (1996)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThree PTK receptors for VEGF have been identified: VEGFR-1 (Flt-1); VEGFR-2 (Flk-1 or KDR) and VEGFR-3 (Flt-4). These receptors are involved in angiogenesis and participate in signal transduction (Mustonen, T., et al., \nJ. Cell Biol., \n129, 895-898 (1995)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOf particular interest is VEGFR-2, which is a transmembrane receptor PTK expressed primarily in endothelial cells. Activation of VEGFR-2 by VEGF is a critical step in the signal transduction pathway that initiates tumour angiogenesis. VEGF expression may be constitutive to tumour cells and can also be upregulated in response to certain stimuli. One such stimuli is hypoxia, where VEGF expression is upregulated in both tumour and associated host tissues. The VEGF ligand activates VEGFR-2 by binding with its extracellular VEGF binding site. This leads to receptor dimerization of VEGFRs and autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues at the intracellular kinase domain of VEGFR-2. The kinase domain operates to transfer a phosphate from ATP to the tyrosine residues, thus providing binding sites for signalling proteins downstream of VEGFR-2 leading ultimately to initiation of angiogenesis (McMahon, G., \nThe Oncologist, \n5(90001), 3-10 (2000)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInhibition at the kinase domain binding site of VEGFR-2 would block phosphorylation of tyrosine residues and serve to disrupt initiation of angiogenesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAngiogenesis is a physiologic process of new blood vessel formation mediated by various cytokines called angiogenic factors. Although its potential pathophysiologic role in solid tumors has been extensively studied for more than 3 decades, enhancement of angiogenesis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and other malignant hematological disorders has been recognized more recently. An increased level of angiogenesis has been documented by various experimental methods both in bone marrow and lymph nodes of patients with CLL. Although the role of angiogenesis in the pathophysiology of this disease remains to be fully elucidated, experimental data suggest that several angiogenic factors play a role in the disease progression. Biologic markers of angiogenesis were also shown to be of prognostic relevance in CLL. This indicates that VEGFR inhibitors may also be of benefit for patients with leukemia's such as CLL.\n\n\n \nJanus Kinases (JAKs)\n\n\n \n \n \nThe Janus kinases (JAKs) consist of four known mammalian family members, JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2 and are intra cellular tyrosine kinases. The JAK-STAT pathway is activated through specific membrane bound receptors. Upon cytokine and growth factor binding, JAKs are recruited to the intracellular domains of the receptors and phosphorylate cytoplasmic proteins including the Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STATs). Specific cytokine receptors recruit and activate distinct pairs of JAK and STAT proteins. The STATs dimerize on phosphorylation and directly activate transcription after nuclear translocation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nJAK2 is the primary tyrosine kinase activated by erythropoietin (EPO) and is essential for definitive erythropoiesis (Parganas et al., Cell 1998; 93(3): 385-95).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConstitutive activation of the JAK-STAT pathway through mechanisms such as point mutations resulting in deregulation of JAK2 activity have been shown to result in ligand independent survival and hypersensitivity and have been observed in some leukaemic cell types (Levine et al., 2005; Jelinek., 2005; Staerk et al. 2005).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn activating mutation in the tyrosine kinase JAK2 has been observed in polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia and myeloid metaplasia with myelofibrosis (Levine et al., Cancer Cell 2005; 7, 387-97). JAK2 mutation 1849G>T is rare in acute leukaemias but can be found in CMML, Philadelphia chromosome-negative CML, and megakaryocytic leukaemia (Jelinek, Blood 2005; 106: 3370-3). Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemias (CMML) include two types: an adult type referred to as CMML and a form of childhood leukemia called Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia (JMML) or Juvenile Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (JCML). CMML leukemias have features that are characteristic of myelogenous leukemia. In the past, CMML was sometimes classified and referred to as a type of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). CMML is more rapidly progressive than “typical” chronic myelogenous leukemia and less rapidly progressive than a type of acute leukemia known as acute myelomonocytic leukemia. Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia differs in several ways from the adult CMML.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA high proportion (>50%) of patients with myeloproliferative disorders (MPD; (polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, idiopathic myelofibrosis) carry a dominant gain-of-function V617F mutation in the JH2 kinase-like domain of JAK2. The majority of Polycythemia Vera (PV) patients harbor a unique somatic mutation (V617F) in the pseudokinase domain of JAK2, which leads to constitutive signaling (Staerk et al, J. Biol. Chem., 10.1074/jbc.C500358200). This mutation leads to deregulation of the kinase activity, and thus to constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation activity. The incidence of the V617F mutation in different studies ranges from 65-97% in polycythemia vera, from 41-57% in patients with essential thrombocythemia, and from 23-95% in patients with idiopathic myelofibrosis. In MPD the mutation is heterozygous in most patients and homozygous only in a minor subset. Mitotic recombination probably causes both 9p LOH and the transition from heterozygosity to homozygosity. The same mutation was also found in roughly 20% of Ph-negative atypical CML, in more than 10% of CMML, in about 15% of patients with megakaryocytic AML (AML M7), and ⅕ patients with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). The V617F mutation seems to occur exclusively in hematopietic malignancies of the myeloid lineage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nJAK2 has been described in a novel somatic point mutation (a G-C to T-A transversion, at nucleotide 1849 of exon 12, resulting in the substitution of valine to phenylalanine at codon 617; JAK2V617F) in classic, BCR/ABL-negative MPD including polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (MMM) (Blood, 15 Nov. 2005, Vol. 106, No. 10, pp. 3335-3336). Following the initial wave of studies that reported a relatively high incidence of JAK2V617F in PV (65%-97%), ET (23%-57%), and MMM (35%-57%), subsequent studies disclosed the occurrence of the same mutation in a spectrum of atypical MPDs as well as in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), albeit at a much lower mutational frequency (3%-33%). In one of these latter studies, JAK2V617F and other oncogenic kinase mutations including BCR/ABL and FIP1 L1-PDGFRA were shown to be mutually exclusive events.\n\n\n \nCheckpoint Kinase 1 (Chk 1) and Checkpoint Kinase 2 (Chk2)\n\n\n \n \n \nCheckpoint kinase 1 (Chk 1) and Checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2) are unrelated serine/threonine kinases involved in the DNA damage checkpoint at the G2M boundary (M. J. O'Connell et al, EMBO J., 1997, 16, 545-554). Chk1 is an essential DNA damage and replication checkpoint kinase. It is phosphorylated by ataxia-telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related kinase (ATR) in response to formation of single-stranded DNA and other DNA lesions (and replication stress) which is induced during DNA damage processing. This phosphorylation correlates with its ability to arrest cells in G2 (Walworth and Bernards 1996). Chk1 phosphorylates Cdc25 phosphatase inhibiting the removal of two inactivating phosphates on cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) (Zeng et al, Nature, 1998, 395, 507-510) leading to cell cycle arrest. DNA damaging agents available in the clinic, which cause p53-dependent cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, may have reduced efficacy against p53 mutant tumour cells. If Chk1 activity is also inhibited in p53-negative cancers, all ability to arrest and repair DNA in response to DNA damage is removed, resulting in mitotic catastrophe and enhancing the effect of the DNA damaging agents (Koniaras et al., Oncogene 2001; 20(51):7453-63.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus combining the inhibition of CHK1/2 with DNA targeting agents such as topoisomerase inhibitors, alkylating agents, antimetabolites, DNA binders, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, irinotecan, fludarabine mitomycin C and radiotherapy, may be beneficial by overcoming some of the mechanisms used by cancer cell to evade current chemotherapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChk2 similarly plays a critical role in the DNA damage checkpoint via double-strand breaks and ataxia-telangiectasia mutated kinase (ATM). Chk2 inhibition therefore could also protect normal sensitive tissues from some chemotherapeutic agents. Targeting Chk1 and Chk2 may significantly increase the therapeutic window of DNA damaging agents available in the clinic.\n\n\n \nFGFR\n\n\n \n \n \nThe fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family of protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) receptors regulates a diverse array of physiologic functions including mitogenesis, wound healing, cell differentiation and angiogenesis, and development. Both normal and malignant cell growth as well as proliferation are affected by changes in local concentration of these extracellular signaling molecules, which act as autocrine as well as paracrine factors. Autocrine FGF signaling may be particularly important in the progression of steroid hormone-dependent cancers and to a hormone independent state (Powers, et al., Endocr. Relat. Cancer, 7, 165-197 (2000)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFGFs and their receptors are expressed at increased levels in several tissues and cell lines and overexpression is believed to contribute to the malignant phenotype. Furthermore, a number of oncogenes are homologues of genes encoding growth factor receptors, and there is a potential for aberrant activation of FGF-dependent signaling in human pancreatic cancer (Ozawa, et al., Teratog. Carcinog. Mutagen., 21, 27-44 (2001)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe two prototypic members are acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF or FGF1) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF or FGF2), and to date, at least twenty distinct FGF family members have been identified. The cellular response to FGFs is transmitted via four types of high affinity transmembrane protein tyrosine-kinase fibroblast growth factor receptors numbered 1 to 4 (FGFR1 to FGFR4). Upon ligand binding, the receptors dimerize and auto- or trans-phosphorylate specific cytoplasmic tyrosine residues to transmit an intracellular signal that ultimately regulates nuclear transcription factor effectors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDisruption of the FGFR1 pathway should affect tumor cell proliferation since this kinase is activated in many tumor types in addition to proliferating endothelial cells. The over-expression and activation of FGFR1 in tumor-associated vasculature has suggested a role for these molecules in tumor angiogenesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFibroblast \ngrowth factor receptor\n 2 has high affinity for the acidic and/or basic fibroblast growth factors, as well as the keratinocyte growth factor ligands. Fibroblast \ngrowth factor receptor\n 2 also propagates the potent osteogenic effects of FGFs during osteoblast growth and differentiation. Mutations in fibroblast \ngrowth factor receptor\n 2, leading to complex functional alterations, were shown to induce abnormal ossification of cranial sutures (craniosynostosis), implying a major role of FGFR signaling in intramembranous bone formation. For example, in Apert (AP) syndrome, characterized by premature cranial suture ossification, most cases are associated with point mutations engendering gain-of-function in fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (Lemonnier, et al., J. Bone Miner. Res., 16, 832-845 (2001)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral severe abnormalities in human skeletal development, including Apert, Crouzon, Jackson-Weiss, Beare-Stevenson cutis gyrata, and Pfeiffer syndromes are associated with the occurrence of mutations in fibroblast \ngrowth factor receptor\n 2. Most, if not all, cases of Pfeiffer Syndrome (PS) are also caused by de novo mutation of the fibroblast \ngrowth factor receptor\n 2 gene (Meyers, et al., Am. J. Hum. Genet., 58, 491-498 (1996); Plomp, et al., Am. J. Med. Genet., 75, 245-251 (1998)), and it was recently shown that mutations in fibroblast \ngrowth factor receptor\n 2 break one of the cardinal rules governing ligand specificity. Namely, two mutant splice forms of fibroblast growth factor receptor, FGFR2c and FGFR2b, have acquired the ability to bind to and be activated by atypical FGF ligands. This loss of ligand specificity leads to aberrant signaling and suggests that the severe phenotypes of these disease syndromes result from ectopic ligand-dependent activation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (Yu, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 97, 14536-14541 (2000)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenetic aberrations of the FGFR3 receptor tyrosine kinase such as chromosomal translocations or point mutations result in ectopically expressed or deregulated, constitutively active, FGFR3 receptors. Such abnormalities are linked to a subset of multiple myelomas and in bladder, hepatocellular, oral squamous cell carcinoma and cervical carcinomas (Powers, C. J., et al., Endocr. Rel. Cancer, 7, 165 (2000), Qiu, W., et. al., World Journal Gastroenterol, 11(34) 2005). Accordingly, FGFR3 inhibitors would be useful in the treatment of multiple myeloma, bladder and cervical carcinomas.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs such, the compounds are useful in providing a means of preventing the growth or inducing apoptosis of neoplasias and in tumours, particularly by inhibiting angiogenesis. The compounds are useful in treating or preventing proliferative disorders such as cancers. In particular tumours with activating mutants of receptor tyrosine kinases or upregulation of receptor tyrosine kinases may be particularly sensitive to the inhibitors. Patients with activating mutants of any of the isoforms of the specific RTKs discussed herein may also find treatment with RTK inhibitors particularly beneficial.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOver expression of FGFR4 has been linked to poor prognosis in both prostate and thyroid carcinomas (Ezzat, S., et al. The Journal of Clinical Investigation, 109, 1 (2002), Wang et al. Clinical Cancer Research, 10 (2004)). In addition a germline polymorphism (Gly388Arg) is associated with increased incidence of lung, breast, colon and prostate cancers (Wang et al. Clinical Cancer Research, 10 (2004)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA recent study has shown a link between FGFR1 expression and tumorigenicity in Classic Lobular Carcinomas (CLC). CLCs account for 10-15% of all breast cancers and, in general, lack p53 and Her2 expression whilst retaining expression of the oestrogen receptor. A gene amplification of 8p12-p11.2 was demonstrated in ˜50% of CLC cases and this was shown to be linked with an increased expression of FGFR1. Preliminary studies with siRNA directed against FGFR1, or a small molecule inhibitor of the receptor, showed cell lines harbouring this amplification to be particularly sensitive to inhibition of this signalling pathway (Reis-Filho et al. Clin Cancer Res. 2006 12(22): 6652-6662.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFibrotic conditions are a major medical problem resulting from abnormal or excessive deposition of fibrous tissue. This occurs in many diseases, including liver cirrhosis, glomerulonephritis, pulmonary fibrosis, systemic fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, as well as the natural process of wound healing. The mechanisms of pathological fibrosis are not fully understood but are thought to result from the actions of various cytokines (including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), fibroblast growth factors (FGF's), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor beta. (TGFβ) involved in the proliferation of fibroblasts and the deposition of extracellular matrix proteins (including collagen and fibronectin). This results in alteration of tissue structure and function and subsequent pathology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA number of preclinical studies have demonstrated the up-regulation of fibroblast growth factors in preclinical models of lung fibrosis (Inoue, et al., 1997 & 2002; Barrios, et al. 1997)). TGFβ1 and PDGF have been reported to be involved in the fibrogenic process (reviewed by Atamas & White, 2003) and further published work suggests the elevation of FGF's and consequent increase in fibroblast proliferation, may be in response to elevated TGFβ1 (Khalil, et al., 2005). The potential therapeutic relevance of this pathway in fibrotic conditions is suggested by the reported clinical effect of Pirfenidone (Arata, et al., 2005) in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIdiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (also referred to as Cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis) is a progressive condition involving scarring of the lung. Gradually, the air sacs of the lungs become replaced by fibrotic tissue, which becomes thicker, causing an irreversible loss of the tissue's ability to transfer oxygen into the bloodstream. The symptoms of the condition include shortness of breath, chronic dry coughing, fatigue, chest pain and loss of appetite resulting in rapid weight loss. The condition is extremely serious with approximately 50% mortality after 5 years.\n\n\n \nRet\n\n\n \n \n \nThe Ret proto-oncogene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase that is expressed during development in a variety of tissues, including the peripheral and central nervous systems and the kidney. The abnormalities present in ret null mice suggest that Ret is critical for the migration and innervation of enteric neurons to the hindgut, and for proliferation and branching of the ureteric bud epithelium during kidney development (Nature 367, 380-383, 1994).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMutations in the RET receptor tyrosine kinase provides a classic example of phenotypic heterogeneity in a variety of diseases. Gain-of-function mutations of RET are associated with human cancer and in particular cause inherited and non-inherited thyroid cancer. Gene rearrangements juxtaposing the tyrosine kinase domain of RET to heterologous gene partners have been found in sporadic papillary carcinomas of the thyroid (PTC). These rearrangements generate chimeric RET/PTC oncogenes. In germline cancers, point mutations of RET are responsible for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2A and 2B) and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC). Both \nMEN\n 2 mutations and PTC gene rearrangements potentiate the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of RET and, ultimately, activate targets downstream of RET.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus somatic gene rearrangements of RET have been found in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and germline point mutations in multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) types 2A and 2B and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC). Conversely, loss-of-function mutations are responsible for the development of Hirschsprung's disease, a congenital malformation of the enteric nervous system. (Naoya Asai et al, Pathology International, Volume 56 Page 164, April 2006)\n\n\n \nEph\n\n\n \n \n \nThe largest subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), the Eph family, and their ligands (ephrins), play important roles in physiologic and pathologic vascular processes. Both the Ephs (receptors) and ephrins (ligands) are divided into two groups, A and B subfamilies (Eph Nomenclature Committee, 1997). The binding of ephrin ligands to Eph receptors is dependent on cell-cell interactions. The interactions of ephrins and Ephs have recently been shown to function via bi-directional signalling. The ephrins binding to Eph receptors initiate phosphorylation at specific tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of the Eph receptors. In response to Eph receptor binding, the ephrin ligand also undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation, so-called ‘reverse’ signalling (Holland, S. J., et al., Nature, 383, 722-725 (1996); Bruckner et al, Science 275: 1640-1643 (1997)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEph RTKs and their ephrin ligands play important roles in embryonic vascular development. Disruption of specific Eph receptors and ligands (including ephrin-B2) leads to defective vessel remodelling, organisation, and sprouting resulting in embryonic death (Wang, H. U., et al., Cell, 93: 741-753 (1998); Adams, R. H., et al., Genes Dev, 13, 295-306 (1999); Gale and Yancopoulos, Genes Dev, 13, 1055-1066 (1999); Helbling, P. M., et al., Development, 127, 269-278 (2000)). Coordinated expression of the Eph/ephrin system determines the phenotype of embryonic vascular structures: ephrin-B2 is present on arterial endothelial cells (ECs), whereas EphB4 is present on venous ECs (Gale and Yancopoulos, Genes Dev, 13, 1055-1066 (1999); Shin, D., et al., Dev Biol, 230, 139-150 (2001)). Recently, specific Ephs and ephrins have been implicated in tumour growth and angiogenesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Ephs and ephrins have been found to be overexpressed in many human tumours. In particular, the role of EphB2 has been identified in small cell lung carcinoma (Tang, X. X., et al., Clin Cancer Res, 5, 455-460 (1999)), human neuroblastomas (Tang, X. X., et al., Clin Cancer Res, 5, 1491-1496 (1999)) and colorectal cancers (Liu, W., et al., Brit. J. Canc., 90, 1620-1626 (2004)), and higher expression levels of Ephs and ephrins, including EphB2, have been found to correlate with more aggressive and metastatic tumours (Nakamoto, M. and Bergemann, A. D., Microsc. Res Tech, 59, 58-67 (2002)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConsequently, inhibition of EphB2 will serve to disrupt angiogenesis, in particular in certain tumours where over-expression occurs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs discussed previously, there are also publications that teach that inhibitors of angiogenesis, working by diverse mechanisms, are beneficial in diseases such as cancer and metastasis (O'Reilly, et al., Cell, 79, 315 (1994); Ingber, et al., Nature, 348, 555 (1990)), ocular diseases (Friedlander, et al., Science, 270, 1500 (1995)), arthritis (Peacock, et al., J. Exp. Med., 175, 1135 (1992); Peacock et al., Cell. Immun., 160, 178 (1995)) and hemangioma (Taraboletti, et al., J. Natl. Cancer Inst., 87, 293 (1995)).\n\n\n \nSRC\n\n\n \n \n \nThe Src family kinases (SFK) comprises nine members of which three (Src, Fyn Yes) are ubiquitously expressed. Src itself is implicated in the pathogenesis of human malignancies. Activated mutants of c-Src can transform human cells in culture and Src protein expression and/or activity is increased in epithelial cancers. In colon cancer there is frequent elevation of Src activity compared to adjacent normal mucosa. Furthermore the Src activation is often elevated in metastases compared to the primary tumour implying a possible role for the protein in invasion and metastasis. Moreover Src expression is strongly correlated with disease progression. Similarly Src expression and activation are also elevated in breast, pancreatic, oesophageal, ovarian, lung, head and neck and gastric cancers compared to normal tissues.\n\n\n \nEGFR and PDGFR\n\n\n \n \n \nA malignant tumour is the product of uncontrolled cell proliferation. Cell growth is controlled by a delicate balance between growth-promoting and growth-inhibiting factors. In normal tissue the production and activity of these factors results in differentiated cells growing in a controlled and regulated manner that maintains the normal integrity and functioning of the organ. The malignant cell has evaded this control; the natural balance is disturbed (via a variety of mechanisms) and unregulated, aberrant cell growth occurs. One driver for growth is the epidermal growth factor (EGF), and the receptor for EGF (EGFR) has been implicated in the development and progression of a number of human solid tumours including those of the lung, breast, prostate, colon, ovary, head and neck. EGFR is a member of a family of four receptors, namely EGFR (HER1 or ErbB1), ErbB2 (HER2/neu), ErbB3 (HER3), and ErbB4 (HER4). These receptors are large proteins that reside in the cell membrane, each having a specific external ligand binding domain, a transmembrane domain and an internal domain which has tyrosine kinase enzyme activity. When EGF attaches to EGFR, it activates the tyrosine kinase, triggering reactions that cause the cells to grow and multiply. EGFR is found at abnormally high levels on the surface of many types of cancer cells, which may divide excessively in the presence of EGF. Inhibition of EGFR activity has therefore been a target for chemotherapeutic research in the treatment of cancer. Such inhibition can be effected by direct interference with the target EGFR on the cell surface, for example by the use of antibodies, or by inhibiting the subsequent tyrosine kinase activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of agents which target EGFR tyrosine kinase activity include the tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib. Gefitinib which has the chemical name 4-(3-chloro-4-fluoroanilino)-7-methoxy-6-(3-morpholinopropoxy)quinazoline, is used for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer, and is also under development for other solid tumours that over-express EGF receptors such as breast and colorectal cancer. Erlotinib, which has the chemical name N-(3-ethynyl-phenyl)-6,7-bis(2-methoxyethoxy)-4-quinazoline, has also been used for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer, and is being developed for the treatment of various other solid tumours such as pancreatic cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother growth factor of importance in tumour development is the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) that comprises a family of peptide growth factors that signal through cell surface tyrosine kinase receptors (PDGFR) and stimulate various cellular functions including growth, proliferation, and differentiation. PDGF expression has been demonstrated in a number of different solid tumours including glioblastomas and prostate carcinomas. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate, which has the chemical name 4-[(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)methyl]-N-[4-methyl-3-[[4-(3-pyridinyl)-2-ylpyridinyl]amino]-phenyl]benzamide methanesulfonate, blocks activity of the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein and the cell surface tyrosine kinase receptor c-Kit, and as such is approved for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumours. Imatinib mesylate is also a potent inhibitor of PDGFR kinase and is currently being evaluated for the treatment of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and glioblastoma multiforme, based upon evidence in these diseases of activating mutations in PDGFR. In addition, sorafenib (BAY 43-9006) which has the chemical name 4-(4-(3-(4-chloro-3 (trifluoromethyl)phenyl)ureido)phenoxy)-N-2-methylpyridine-2-carboxamide, targets both the Raf signalling pathway to inhibit cell proliferation and the VEGFR/PDGFR signalling cascades to inhibit tumour angiogenesis. Sorafenib is being investigated for the treatment of a number of cancers including liver and kidney cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are conditions which are dependent on activation of PDGFR such as hypereosinophilic syndrome. PDGFR activation is also associated with other malignancies, which include chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). In another disorder, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, an infiltrative skin tumor, a reciprocal translocation involving the gene encoding the PDGF-B ligand results in constitutive secretion of the chimeric ligand and receptor activation. Imatinib has which is a known inhibitor of PDGFR has activity against all three of these diseases.\n\n\n \nCompounds of Formula (I′)\n\n\n \n \n \nA wide variety of compounds of the formula (I′) find application in the combinations of the invention, as described in detail below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula (I′) for use in the combinations of the invention therefore include the compound classes (a) and (b) as described herein, so including the compounds of WO 2005/002552 and WO 2006/070195 corresponding to those of formula (I′) described therein and sub-groups, embodiments and examples thereof (as also therein defined).

Furthermore, and as explained below, any references to formula (I″) herein shall also be taken to refer to formulae (II″) to (VIII″) and any other sub-group of compounds within formula (I″) unless the context requires otherwise.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “modulation”, as applied to the activity of cyclin dependent kinase (CDK), Aurora kinases and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK, e.g. GSK-3) and/or any other kinase as described herein, is intended to define a change in the level of biological activity of the kinase(s). Thus, modulation encompasses physiological changes which effect an increase or decrease in the relevant kinase activity. In the latter case, the modulation may be described as “inhibition”. The modulation may arise directly or indirectly, and may be mediated by any mechanism and at any physiological level, including for example at the level of gene expression (including for example transcription, translation and/or post-translational modification), at the level of expression of genes encoding regulatory elements which act directly or indirectly on the levels of the kinase activity e.g. Aurora kinase, cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) and/or glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) activity and/or activity of any other kinase described herein, or at the level of enzyme (e.g. cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) and/or glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3)) activity and/or any other kinase described herein (for example by allosteric mechanisms, competitive inhibition, active-site inactivation, perturbation of feedback inhibitory pathways etc.). Thus, modulation may imply elevated/suppressed expression or over- or under-expression of the kinase (e.g. cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) and/or glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) or any other kinase described herein), including gene amplification (i.e. multiple gene copies) and/or increased or decreased expression by a transcriptional effect, as well as hyper- (or hypo-)activity and (de)activation of the protein kinase(s) (e.g. cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) and/or glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) and/or any other protein kinase described herein) (including (de)activation) by mutation(s). The terms “modulated”, “modulating” and “modulate” are to be interpreted accordingly.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “upregulation of Aurora kinase” as used herein is defined as including elevated expression or over-expression of Aurora kinase, including gene amplification (i.e. multiple gene copies) and increased expression by a transcriptional effect, and hyperactivity and activation of Aurora kinase, including activation by mutations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “mediated”, as used e.g. in conjunction with a kinase as described herein (e.g. cyclin dependent kinases (CDK) and/or glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) as described herein) (and applied for example to various physiological processes, diseases, states, conditions, therapies, treatments or interventions) is intended to operate imitatively so that the various processes, diseases, states, conditions, treatments and interventions to which the term is applied are those in which the kinase (e.g. cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) and/or glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3)) plays a biological role. In cases where the term is applied to a disease, state or condition, the biological role played by the kinase (e.g. cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) and/or glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3)) may be direct or indirect and may be necessary and/or sufficient for the manifestation of the symptoms of the disease, state or condition (or its aetiology or progression). Thus, kinase activity (e.g. cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) and/or glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) activity) (and in particular aberrant levels of cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) and/or glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) activity, e.g. cyclin dependent kinases (CDK) and/or glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) over-expression) need not necessarily be the proximal cause of the disease, state or condition: rather, it is contemplated that the kinase mediated diseases, states or conditions (e.g. CDK- and/or GSK- (e.g. GSK-3-) mediated diseases, states or conditions) include those having multifactorial aetiologies and complex progressions in which the kinase (e.g. CDK and/or GSK-3) is only partially involved. In cases where the term is applied to treatment, prophylaxis or intervention (e.g. in the “CDK-mediated treatments” and “GSK-3-mediated prophylaxis” of the invention), the role played by the kinase (e.g. CDK and/or GSK-3) may be direct or indirect and may be necessary and/or sufficient for the operation of the treatment, prophylaxis or outcome of the intervention. Thus, a disease state or condition mediated by the kinase (e.g. cyclin dependent kinases (CDK) and/or glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) and/or Aurora kinase and/or any other kinase as described herein) includes a disease state or condition which has arisen as a consequence of the development of resistance to any particular cancer drug or treatment (including in particular resistance to one or more of the ancillary compounds described herein).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “intervention” is a term of art used herein to define any agency which effects a physiological change at any level. Thus, the intervention may comprise the induction or repression of any physiological process, event, biochemical pathway or cellular/biochemical event. The interventions of the invention typically effect (or contribute to) the therapy, treatment or prophylaxis of a disease or condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe combinations of the invention may produce a therapeutically efficacious effect relative to the therapeutic effect of the individual compounds when administered separately.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term ‘efficacious’ includes advantageous effects such as additivity, synergism, reduced side effects, reduced toxicity, increased time to disease progression, increased time of survival, sensitization or resensitization of one agent to another, or improved response rate. Advantageously, an efficacious effect may allow for lower doses of each or either component to be administered to a patient, thereby decreasing the toxicity of chemotherapy, whilst producing and/or maintaining the same therapeutic effect.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “synergistic” effect in the present context refers to a therapeutic effect produced by the combination which is larger than the sum of the therapeutic effects of the components of the combination when presented individually.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “additive” effect in the present context refers to a therapeutic effect produced by the combination which is larger than the therapeutic effect of any of the components of the combination when presented individually.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “response rate” as used herein refers, in the case of a solid tumour, to the extent of reduction in the size of the tumour at a given time point, for example 12 weeks. Thus, for example, a 50% response rate means a reduction in tumour size of 50%. References herein to a “clinical response” refer to response rates of 50% or greater. A “partial response” is defined herein as being a response rate of less than 50%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “combination”, as applied to two or more compounds and/or agents (also referred to herein as the components), is intended tomay define material in which the two or more compounds/agents are associated. The terms “combined” and “combining” in this context are to be interpreted accordingly.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe association of the two or more compounds/agents in a combination may be physical or non-physical. Examples of physically associated combined compounds/agents include:\n\n \n \n \n \n \ncompositions (e.g. unitary formulations) comprising the two or more compounds/agents in admixture (for example within the same unit dose);\n \ncompositions comprising material in which the two or more compounds/agents are chemically/physicochemically linked (for example by crosslinking, molecular agglomeration or binding to a common vehicle moiety);\n \ncompositions comprising material in which the two or more compounds/agents are chemically/physicochemically co-packaged (for example, disposed on or within lipid vesicles, particles (e.g. micro- or nanoparticles) or emulsion droplets);\n \npharmaceutical kits, pharmaceutical packs or patient packs in which the two or more compounds/agents are co-packaged or co-presented (e.g. as part of an array of unit doses);\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nExamples of non-physically associated combined compounds/agents include:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nmaterial (e.g. a non-unitary formulation) comprising at least one of the two or more compounds/agents together with instructions for the extemporaneous association of the at least one compound to form a physical association of the two or more compounds/agents;\n \nmaterial (e.g. a non-unitary formulation) comprising at least one of the two or more compounds/agents together with instructions for combination therapy with the two or more compounds/agents;\n \nmaterial comprising at least one of the two or more compounds/agents together with instructions for administration to a patient population in which the other(s) of the two or more compounds/agents have been (or are being) administered;\n \nmaterial comprising at least one of the two or more compounds/agents in an amount or in a form which is specifically adapted for use in combination with the other(s) of the two or more compounds/agents.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “combination therapy” is intended to define therapies which comprise the use of a combination of two or more compounds/agents (as defined above). Thus, references to “combination therapy”, “combinations” and the use of compounds/agents “in combination” in this application may refer to compounds/agents that are administered as part of the same overall treatment regimen. As such, the posology of each of the two or more compounds/agents may differ: each may be administered at the same time or at different times. It will therefore be appreciated that the compounds/agents of the combination may be administered sequentially (e.g. before or after) or simultaneously, either in the same pharmaceutical formulation (i.e. together), or in different pharmaceutical formulations (i.e. separately). Simultaneously in the same formulation is as a unitary formulation whereas simultaneously in different pharmaceutical formulations is non-unitary. The posologies of each of the two or more compounds/agents in a combination therapy may also differ with respect to the route of administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “pharmaceutical kit” defines an array of one or more unit doses of a pharmaceutical composition together with dosing means (e.g. measuring device) and/or delivery means (e.g. inhaler or syringe), optionally all contained within common outer packaging. In pharmaceutical kits comprising a combination of two or more compounds/agents, the individual compounds/agents may unitary or non-unitary formulations. The unit dose(s) may be contained within a blister pack. The pharmaceutical kit may optionally further comprise instructions for use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “pharmaceutical pack” defines an array of one or more unit doses of a pharmaceutical composition, optionally contained within common outer packaging. In pharmaceutical packs comprising a combination of two or more compounds/agents, the individual compounds/agents may unitary or non-unitary formulations. The unit dose(s) may be contained within a blister pack. The pharmaceutical pack may optionally further comprise instructions for use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “patient pack” defines a package, prescribed to a patient, which contains pharmaceutical compositions for the whole course of treatment. Patient packs usually contain one or more blister pack(s). Patient packs have an advantage over traditional prescriptions, where a pharmacist divides a patient's supply of a pharmaceutical from a bulk supply, in that the patient always has access to the package insert contained in the patient pack, normally missing in patient prescriptions. The inclusion of a package insert has been shown to improve patient compliance with the physician's instructions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe combinations of the invention may produce a therapeutically efficacious effect relative to the therapeutic effect of the individual compounds/agents when administered separately.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “ancillary compound” as used herein may define a compound which yields an efficacious combination (as herein defined) when combined with a compound of the formula (I′) as defined herein. The ancillary compound may therefore act as an adjunct to the compound of the formula (I′) as defined herein, or may otherwise contribute to the efficacy of the combination (for example, by producing a synergistic or additive effect or improving the response rate, as herein defined).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “checkpoint targeting agent” is used herein to define a functional class of agents which act to initiate activation of a cell cycle checkpoint or agents that interfere with or modulate the normal action of the cell cycle checkpoint in replicating tumour cells. The term therefore covers various agents (including, for example, platinum compounds, nucleoside analogues, CDK inhibitors, taxanes, epothilones, \nvinca \nalkaloids, polo-like kinase inhibitors, CHK kinase inhibitors, inhibitors of the BUB kinase family and kinesin inhibitors) that target the cell cycle checkpoint. Particularly preferred checkpoint targeting agents are those that disrupt the mitotic checkpoint such as taxanes and \nvinca \nalkaloids. The targeting of the checkpoint may be mediated by any mechanism, including for example via stabilisation of spindle microtubules (so preventing spindle contraction, as mediated e.g. by various taxanes) or by prevention of spindle formation (as mediated e.g. by various \nvinca \nalkaloids) or by agents which cause damage to cellular components (e.g. DNA as caused by the platinum compounds or nucleoside analogues) thus causing activation of the checkpoint during cell proliferation. Thus, the checkpoint targeting agents typically cause chromosome mis-alignment or premature cytokinesis leading to death of the tumour cell. Checkpoint targeting agents may be identified by various techniques known to those skilled in the art for assessing cell cycle dynamics (e.g. for detecting multinucleation events), including for example flow cytometry, DNA staining, Western blot analysis for cell cycle markers (e.g. cylins) and direct visualization by various microscopic techniques (e.g. focal microscopy).\n\n\n \nCompounds of Formula (I′)\n\n\n \n \n \nA wide variety of compounds of the formula (I′) find application in the combinations of the invention, as described in detail below.

Pharm. Sci\n. (1997), 86, 1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the lactate (particularly the L-lactate) or citrate salts are substantially crystalline i.e. they may be from 50% to 100% crystalline, and more particularly they may be at least 50% crystalline, or at least 60% crystalline, or at least 70% crystalline, or at least 80% crystalline, or at least 90% crystalline, or at least 95% crystalline, or at least 98% crystalline, or at least 99% crystalline, or at least 99.5% crystalline, or at least 99.9% crystalline, for example 100% crystalline.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment, the lactate or citrate salts are selected from the group consisting of lactate (particularly the L-lactate) or citrate salts that are from 50% to 100% crystalline, for example at least 50% crystalline, at least 60% crystalline, at least 70% crystalline, at least 80% crystalline, at least 90% crystalline, at least 95% crystalline, at least 98% crystalline, at least 99% crystalline, at least 99.5% crystalline, and at least 99.9% crystalline, for example 100% crystalline.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore preferably the lactate (particularly the L-lactate) or citrate salts may be those (or may be selected from the group consisting of those) that are 95% to 100% crystalline, for example at least 98% crystalline, or at least 99% crystalline, or at least 99.5% crystalline, or at least 99.6% crystalline or at least 99.7% crystalline or at least 99.8% crystalline or at least 99.9% crystalline, for example 100% crystalline.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne example of a substantially crystalline salt is a crystalline salt formed with L-lactic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother example of a substantially crystalline salt is a crystalline salt formed with citric acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe salts for use in the combinations of the invention, in the solid state, can be solvated (e.g. hydrated) or non-solvated (e.g. anhydrous).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the salts are non-solvated (e.g. anhydrous).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA further example of a non-solvated salt is the crystalline salt formed with lactic acid (particularly L-lactic acid) as defined herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the crystalline form of the salt of Formula (I′) is selected from L-lactate salt and citrate salt, in particular the L-lactate salt.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “anhydrous” as used herein does not exclude the possibility of the presence of some water on or in the salt (e.g. a crystal of the salt). For example, there may be some water present on the surface of the salt (e.g. salt crystal), or minor amounts within the body of the salt (e.g. crystal). Typically, an anhydrous form contains fewer than 0.4 molecules of water per molecule of compound, and more preferably contains fewer than 0.1 molecules of water per molecule of compound, for example 0 molecules of water.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the lactate (particularly the L-lactate) or citrate salts are solvated. Where the salts are hydrated, they can contain, for example, up to three molecules of water of crystallisation, more usually up to two molecules of water, e.g. one molecule of water or two molecules of water. Non-stoichiometric hydrates may also be formed in which the number of molecules of water present is less than one or is otherwise a non-integer. For example, where there is less than one molecule of water present, there may be for example 0.4, or 0.5, or 0.6, or 0.7, or 0.8, or 0.9 molecules of water present per molecule of compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther solvates include alcoholates such as ethanolates and isopropanolates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the lactic acid salt (particularly the L-lactate) is solvated for example with water and/or ethanol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe lactate (particularly the L-lactate) or citrate salts for use in the combinations of the present invention can be synthesized from the parent compound 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea by conventional chemical methods such as methods described in \nPharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection, and Use\n, P. Heinrich Stahl (Editor), Camille G. Wermuth (Editor), ISBN: 3-90639-026-8, Hardcover, 388 pages, August 2002. Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting the parent compound 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea with the appropriate acid in water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two; generally, non-aqueous media such as ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile are used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe combinations may be prepared by a method which comprises preparing a lactate (particularly the L-lactate) or citrate salt of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea, which method comprises forming a solution of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea free base in a solvent (typically an organic solvent) or mixture of solvents, and treating the solution with an acid to form a precipitate of the salt.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe acid may be added as a solution in a solvent which is miscible with the solvent in which the free base is dissolved. The solvent in which the free base is initially dissolved may be one in which the salt thereof is insoluble. Alternatively, the solvent in which the free base is initially dissolved may be one in which the salt is at least partially soluble, a different solvent in which the salt is less soluble subsequently being added such that the salt precipitates out of solution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an alternative method of forming a salt, 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea is dissolved in a solvent comprising a volatile acid and optionally a co-solvent, thereby to form a solution of the salt with the volatile acid, and the resulting solution is then concentrated or evaporated to isolate the salt.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe combinations may be prepared by a method which comprises forming a lactate (particularly the L-lactate) or citrate salt of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea as defined herein, which method comprises treating a compound of the formula (I):\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwith an organic or inorganic acid as defined herein in an organic solvent, and optionally isolating the salt thus formed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe lactate (particularly the L-lactate) or citrate salt is typically precipitated from the organic solvent as it is formed and hence can be isolated by separation of the solid from the solution, e.g. by filtration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne salt form can be converted to the free base and optionally to another salt form by methods well known to the skilled person. For example, the free base can be formed by passing the salt solution through a column containing an amine stationary phase (e.g. a Strata-NH\n2 \ncolumn). Alternatively, a solution of the salt in water can be treated with sodium bicarbonate to decompose the salt and precipitate out the free base. The free base may then be combined with another acid by one of the methods described above or elsewhere herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe lactate (particularly the L-lactate) or citrate salts have a number of advantages over the corresponding free base. For example, the salts will enjoy one or more of the following advantages over the free base in that they:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nwill be more soluble in particular they will have improved solubility in aqueous solution and hence will be better for i.v. administration (e.g. by infusion)\n \nwill allow control of solution pH and therefore better for i.v. administration;\n \nwill have better stability for example thermal stabililty (e.g. improved shelf life);\n \nwill have advantages for production;\n \nwill have better physicochemical properties;\n \nmay have improved anti-cancer activity; and\n \nmay have an improved therapeutic index.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe crystalline lactate salt (particularly the L-lactate) for use in the combinations of the invention is particularly advantageous as it is:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nnon-hygroscopic\n \nanhydrous and does not form hydrates\n \nsingle polymorphic form\n \ncrystalline\n \nstable to storage\n \nhas sharp melting point and no form changes in DSC experiment.\n \nhas good solubility in water, and gives better solubility in buffer systems.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe term ‘stable’ or ‘stability’ as used herein includes chemical stability and solid state (physical) stability.

In the situation where there is more than one counter ions the aqueous solution of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea in protonated form will potentially contain a mixture of counter ions for example a mixture of L-lactate and citrate counter ions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention therefore provides a combination based on lyophilised formulation of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea in protonated form together with one or more counter ions selected from lactate, citrate and a mixture thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one preferred embodiment the lyophilised formulation defined above, the salt is a L-lactate and the buffer salt is citrate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the lactate and citrate ions are present in the lyophilised formulation in a lactate:citrate ratio of from 10:1 or less, for example 10:1 to 1:10, more preferably less then 8:1, or less than 7:1, or less than 6:1, or less than 5:1 or less than 4:1 or less than 3:1 or less than 2:1 or less than 1:1, more particularly from 1:1 to 1:10, for example 1:1 to 1:8, or 1:1 to 1:7 or 1:1 to 1:6 or 1:1 to 1:5, e.g. approximately 1:4.4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe lyophilised formulation of the salts may be buffered or unbuffered but in one embodiment are buffered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the context of the salt formed with lactic acid, a preferred buffer is a buffer formed from citric acid and corrected with NaOH or HCl to the correct pH, for example at a solution pH of approximately 4.5. At this pH and in the citrate buffer, the free base has a solubility of about 80 mg/ml respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe lyophilised formulation is then reconstituted into a sterile aqueous solution containing an IV excipient such as saline or dextrose, preferably dextrose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe salts for use in the combinations of the invention are typically pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are discussed in Berge et al., 1977, “Pharmaceutically Acceptable Salts,” \nJ. Pharm. Sci, Vol. \n66, pp. 1-19. However, salts that are not pharmaceutically acceptable may also be prepared as intermediate forms which may then be converted into pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Such non-pharmaceutically acceptable salts forms therefore also find utility according to the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea may also form N-oxides. N-Oxides can be formed by treatment of the corresponding amine with an oxidizing agent such as hydrogen peroxide or a per-acid (e.g. a peroxycarboxylic acid), see for example \nAdvanced Organic Chemistry\n, by Jerry March, 4\nth \nEdition, Wiley Interscience, pages. More particularly, N-oxides can be made by the procedure of L. W. Deady (\nSyn. Comm. \n1977, 7, 509-514) in which the amine compound is reacted with m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (MCPBA), for example, in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea, from which the lactate or citrate salts for use in the invention are derived, may exist in a number of different tautomeric forms and references in this application to the compound include all such forms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore particularly, in the lactate or citrate salts of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea for use in the combinations of the invention, the benzoimidazole group may take either of the following two tautomeric forms A and B. For simplicity, the general formula (I) illustrates forms A but the formula is to be taken as embracing all four tautomeric forms.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMoreover, in the context of the lactate or citrate salts of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(6-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea, references to the alternative tautomer, are clearly references to the lactate or citrate salts of the same compound as 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pyrazole ring may also exhibit tautomerism and can exist in the two tautomeric forms C and D below.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition cis and trans conformations of the urea are possible.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReferences to the lactate or citrate salts (e.g. the L-lactate salt) of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea and the salts for use in the combinations of the invention also include variants with one or more isotopic substitutions, and a reference to a particular element includes within its scope all isotopes of the element. For example, a reference to hydrogen includes within its scope \n1\nH, \n2\nH (D), and \n3\nH (T). Similarly, references to carbon and oxygen include within their scope respectively \n12\nC, \n13\nC and \n14\nC and \n16\nO and \n18\nO.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe isotopes may be radioactive or non-radioactive. In one case, the compounds contain no radioactive isotopes. Such compounds are preferred for therapeutic use. In another case, however, the compound may contain one or more radioisotopes. Compounds containing such radioisotopes may be useful in a diagnostic context.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso encompassed by references to 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea and the salts are any polymorphic forms, solvates (e.g. hydrates), complexes (e.g. inclusion complexes or clathrates with compounds such as cyclodextrins, or complexes with metals) thereof.\n\n\n \nCrystal Structures of 1-Cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea\n\n\n \n \n \nAs described above, the lactate or citrate salts of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea can be amorphous or substantially crystalline. In one particular embodiment, the lactate or citrate salts are substantially crystalline, the term “substantially crystalline” having the meaning defined above. In particular the lactate salt of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea is substantially crystalline.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere the lactate salt (particularly the L-lactate) of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea is substantially crystalline, one single crystalline form may predominate, although other crystalline forms may be present in minor and preferably negligible amounts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe crystalline forms of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea contain less than or equal to about 5% by weight other crystalline forms of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea, in particular containing less than or equal to about 1% by weight of other crystalline forms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment, the invention provides combinations based on a substantially crystalline salt (e.g. a lactate salt (particularly the L-lactate) as defined herein) of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea containing a single crystalline form of the salt and no more than 5% by weight of any other crystalline forms of the salt.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, the single crystalline form is accompanied by less than 4%, or less than 3%, or less than 2% of other crystalline forms, and in particular contains less than or equal to about 1% by weight of other crystalline forms. More preferably, the single crystalline form is accompanied by less than 0.9%, or less than 0.8%, or less than 0.7%, or less than 0.6%, or less than 0.5%, or less than 0.4%, or less than 0.3%, or less than 0.2%, or less than 0.1%, or less than 0.05%, or less than 0.01%, by weight of other crystalline forms, for example 0% by weight of other crystalline forms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe crystals and their crystal structures can be characterised using a number of techniques including single crystal X-ray crystallography, X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and infra red spectroscopy, e.g. Fourier Transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR). The behaviour of the crystals under conditions of varying humidity can be analysed by gravimetric vapour sorption studies and also by XRPD.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDetermination of the crystal structure of a compound can be performed by X-ray crystallography which can be carried out according to the conventional methods such as those described herein and in Fundamentals of Crystallography, C. Giacovazzo, H. L. Monaco, D. Viterbo, F. Scordari, G. Gilli, G. Zanotti and M. Catti, (International Union of Crystallography/Oxford University Press, 1992 ISBN 0-19-855578-4 (p/b), 0-19-85579-2 (h/b)). This technique involves the analysis and interpretation of the X-ray diffraction of single crystal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe crystal structure of the lactate salt and the dihydrate free base of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea has been determined by X-ray crystallography as described in WO 2006/070195.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTables 2 and 4 of WO 2006/070195 give coordinate data for crystals of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea in Crystallographic Information File (CIF) Format (see Hall, Allen and Brown, \nActa Cryst\n. (1991). A47, 655-685; http://www.iucr.ac.uk/iucr-top/cif/home.html). Alternative file formats such as a PDB file format (e.g. format consistent with that of the EBI Macromolecular Structure Database (Hinxton, UK)) may be used or preferred by others of skill in the art. However it will be apparent that the use of a different file format to present or manipulate the coordinates of the Tables of WO 2006/070195 (the content of which is incorporated herein by reference) is contemplated. The numbers in brackets in these Tables represent the deviation (s.u., standard uncertainty). The crystal structure of the lactate salt is illustrated in FIGS. 4 and 5 of WO 2006/070195.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the invention provides combinations based on a lactate salt (particularly the L-lactate) of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea which is crystalline and has a crystal structure as defined by the coordinates in Table 4 in Example 71 of WO 2006/070195 at page 205 (the content of which is incorporated herein by reference).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment the invention provides combinations based on a lactate salt (particularly the L-lactate) of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea which is crystalline and has a crystal structure as set out in FIGS. 4 and 5 of WO 2006/070195.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment the invention provides combinations based on a lactate salt (particularly the L-lactate) of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea which is crystalline and has a crystal structure that belongs belong to an orthorhombic \nspace group P2\n \n \n \n1\n2\n1\n2\n1 \n(# 19) and has crystal lattice parameters at 97(2) K a=9.94(10), b=15.03(10), c=16.18(10) Å, α=β=γ=\n90\n°.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment the invention provides combinations based on a lactate salt (particularly the L-lactate) of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea which is crystalline and has crystal lattice parameters at room temperature a=10.08(10), b=15.22(10), c=16.22(10) Å, α=β=γ=90°.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, in another embodiment, the invention provides combinations based on a lactate salt (particularly the L-lactate) of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea which is crystalline and:\n\n \n \n \n \n \n(a) has a crystal structure as set out in \nFIGS. 4 and 5\n; and/or\n \n(b) has a crystal structure as defined by the coordinates in Table 4 in Example 71 of WO 2006/070195 at page 205 to 209 (the content of which is incorporated herein by reference); and/or\n \n(c) has crystal lattice parameters at 97(2) K a=9.94(10), b=15.03(10), c=16.18(10) Å, α=β=γ=90°; and/or\n \n(d) has crystal lattice parameters at room temperature a=10.08(10), b=15.22(10), c=16.22(10) Å, α=β=γ=90°; and/or\n \n(e) has a crystal structure that belongs belong to an orthorhombic \nspace group P2\n \n \n \n1\n2\n1\n2\n1 \n(# 19).\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe substantially crystalline salts preferably are substantially free of residual organic solvent used, e.g. to recrystallise or otherwise purify the salt, or other solvent such as water.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the crystals of the lactate salt (particularly the L-lactate) of the compounds of Formula (I) in particular lactate salt of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea are crystals which contain less than 10% by weight of residual solvent (e.g. water or an organic solvent), for example less than 5% residual solvent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the crystalline salts (e.g. the lactate salts-particularly the L-lactate) are anhydrous, the term “anhydrous” having the meaning defined above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment the crystalline lactate salt of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea contains residual organic solvent e.g. ethanol in the range of about 0 to 5% by weight for example about 2% ethanol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the crystalline structure of a compound can be analysed by the solid state technique of X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD). XRPD can be carried out according to the conventional methods such as those described in WO 2006/070195 and in Introduction to X-ray Powder Diffraction, Ron Jenkins and Robert L. Snyder (John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1996). The presence of defined peaks (as opposed to random background noise) in an XRPD diffractogram indicates that the compound has a degree of crystallinity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA compound's X-ray powder pattern is characterised by the diffraction angle (20) and interplanar spacing (d) parameters of an X-ray diffraction spectrum. These are related by Bragg's equation, nλ=2d Sin θ, (where n=1; λ=wavelength of the cathode used; d=interplanar spacing; and θ=diffraction angle). Herein, interplanar spacings, diffraction angle and overall pattern are important for identification of crystal in the X-ray powder diffraction, due to the characteristics of the data. The relative intensity should not be strictly interpreted since it may be varied depending on the direction of crystal growth, particle sizes and measurement conditions. In addition, the diffraction angles usually mean ones which coincide in the range of 2θ35 0.2°. The peaks mean main peaks and include peaks not larger than medium at diffraction angles other than those stated above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBoth the lactate salt and free base forms of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea have been characterised by XRPD. In each case, the powder X-ray diffraction patterns are expressed in terms of the diffraction angle (28), inter planar spacing (d) and/or relative intensities. Tables 3, 5 and 6 of WO 2006/070195 (the content of which is incorporated herein by reference) show the interplanar spacing (d) values of the X-ray diffraction spectrum that correspond to the diffraction angle values of the free base, lactate salt and dihydrate free base forms of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea has X-ray powder diffraction patterns essentially as shown in FIG. 3, 6, 7 or 8 and/or Tables 3, 5 or 6 of WO 2006/070195 (the content of which is incorporated herein by reference).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention therefore provides combinations based on crystals of salts (e.g. lactate-particularly the L-lactate) of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea having an X-ray powder diffraction patterns which are substantially as in FIG. 3, 6, 7 or 8 of WO 2006/070195. Preferably the compound for use in the combinations of the invention is a compound which exhibits peaks at the same diffraction angles as those of the X-ray powder diffraction pattern shown in FIG. 3, 6, 7 or 8 of WO 2006/070195 and/or Table 3 in Example 70 of WO 2006/070195 at pages 204 to 205 (the content of which is incorporated herein by reference) and/or Table 5 in Example 72 of WO 2006/070195 at pages 209 to 210 (the content of which is incorporated herein by reference) and/or Table 6 in Example 72 of WO 2006/070195 at page 211 (the content of which is incorporated herein by reference) and optionally has same the relative intensity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention further provides combinations based on crystals of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea lactic acid salt (particularly the L-lactate) which has an X-ray powder diffraction pattern essentially as shown in FIG. 6 of WO 2006/070195. Accordingly, in another embodiment, the invention provides combinations based on a substantially crystalline lactate salt (particularly the L-lactate) of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea which exhibits peaks at the same diffraction angles as those of the X-ray powder diffraction pattern shown in \nFIG. 6\n. Preferably the peaks have the same relative intensity as the peaks in \nFIG. 6\n. Therefore the invention provides combinations based on a substantially crystalline lactic acid salt (particularly the L-lactate) of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea having an X-ray powder diffraction pattern substantially as shown in \nFIG. 6\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe X-ray powder diffraction pattern of the lactate salt may be characterised by the presence of peaks at the diffraction angles (2θ) and interplanar spacings (d), and preferably the intensities shown in Table 5 in Example 72 of WO 2006/070195 (the content of which is incorporated herein by reference).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore the invention provides combinations based on crystals of cyclopropyl-3-[3-(6-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea lactate (particularly the L-lactate), which shows an X-ray powder diffraction pattern having characteristic peaks at a diffraction angle (2θ±1.0 degree such as ±0.2 degree, in particular ±0.1 degree) of Table 5 in Example 72 of WO 2006/070195 (the content of which is incorporated herein by reference).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides combinations based on crystals of cyclopropyl-3-[3-(6-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea lactate salt (particularly the L-lactate) having an X-ray powder diffraction pattern showing major peaks of diffraction angles 26 of 17.50, 18.30, 19.30, 19.60, and 21.85±1.0 degree such as ±0.2 degree, in particular ±0.1 degree.\n\n\n \n \n

combinations based on crystals of cyclopropyl-3-[3-(6-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea lactate salt (particularly the L-lactate), which possess an X-ray powder

exhibits onset at 190° C. and a peak at 194-197° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, in another aspect, the invention provides combinations based on a lactate salt (particularly the L-lactate) of which is anhydrous and exhibits onset at 190° C. and/or an endothermic peak at 194-197° C. when subjected to DSC.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore a further aspect of the invention is a combination based on the

according to thermal analysis (DSC).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe behaviour of the salts for use in the combinations of the invention in conditions of high humidity can be analysed by standard gravimetric vapour sorption (GVS) methods, for example as described in Example 68 of WO 2006/070195.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe lactate salt can exist in a stable anhydrous crystalline form in conditions of high relative humidity does not undergo changes in crystal structure under such conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe salts for use in the combinations of the invention can be further characterised by infra-red

Accordingly, in a preferred case, the combinations of the invention are based on a L-lactate salt (particularly the L-lactate) of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea which is crystalline and is characterised by any one or more (in any combination) or all of the following parameters, namely that the salt:\n\n \n \n \n \n \n(a) has a crystal structure as set out in \nFIGS. 4 and 5\n; and/or\n \n(b) has a crystal structure as defined by the coordinates in Table 4 in Example 71 of WO 2006/070195 (the content of which is incorporated herein by reference); and/or\n \n(c) has crystal lattice parameters at 97(2) K a=9.94(10), b=15.03(10), c=16.18(10) Å, α=β=γ=\n90\n°; and/or\n \n(d) has crystal lattice parameters at room temperature a=10.08(10), b=15.22(10), c=16.22(10) Å, α=β=γ=90°; and/or\n \n(e) has a crystal structure that belongs belong to an orthorhombic \nspace group P2\n \n \n \n1\n2\n1\n2\n1 \n(# 19); and/or\n \n(f) has an X-ray powder diffraction pattern characterised by the presence of major peaks at the diffraction angles (2θ) of 17.50, 18.30, 19.30, 19.60, and 21.85 degrees, more particularly 12.40, 15.20, 15.60, 17.50, 18.30, 18.50, 19.30, 19.60, 21.85, and 27.30 degrees, and/or interplanar spacings (d) of 5.06, 4.85, 4.60, 4.53, and 4.07, more particularly 7.13, 5.83, 5.68, 5.06, 4.85, 4.79, 4.60, 4.53, 4.07, and 3.26 angstrom; and/or\n \n(g) exhibits peaks at the same diffraction angles as those of the X-ray powder diffraction pattern shown in FIG. 6 or Table 5 in Example 72 of WO 2006/070195 (the content of which is incorporated herein by reference) and optionally wherein the peaks have the same relative intensity as the peaks in \nFIG. 6\n; or Table 5 (as incorporated herein); and/or\n \n(h) has an X-ray powder diffraction pattern substantially as shown in \nFIG. 6\n; and/or\n \n(i) is anhydrous and exhibits onset at 190° C. and/or an endothermic peak at 194-197° C. when subjected to DSC; and/or\n \n(j) exhibits an infra-red spectrum, when analysed using the KBr disc method, that contains characteristic peaks at 3229, 2972 and 1660 cm\n−1\n.\n \n \n \n\n\nCrystal Structures of 1-Cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea Free Base\n\n\n \n \n \nThe free base of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea can also be amorphous or substantially crystalline. In one particular embodiment, the free base is substantially crystalline, the term “substantially crystalline” having the meaning defined above. In one embodiment, the free base of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea exists in a dihydrate crystalline form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe crystal structure of the free base dihydrate of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea has been determined by X-ray crystallography.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the invention provides combinations based on the dihydrate free base of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea which is crystalline and (i) has a crystal structure as defined by the coordinates in Table 2 in Example 69 of WO 2006/070195 at pages 203 to 204 (the content of which is incorporated herein by reference); and/or (ii) wherein the crystals belong to a monoclinic space group P2\n1\n/n (# 14) with crystal lattice parameters a=7.66(10), b=15.18(10), c=17.71(10) Å, β=\n98\n.\n53\n(2)°, α=γ=90°.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe free base forms of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea have been characterised by XRPD. Therefore free base forms of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea have X-ray powder diffraction patterns essentially as shown in FIG. 3, 6, 7 or 8 and/or Tables 3, 5 or 6 in Examples 70 and 72 of WO 2006/070195 (the content of which is incorporated herein by reference).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, in one embodiment, the invention provides combinations based on crystals of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea free base exhibiting X-ray powder diffraction patterns containing peaks at the same diffraction angles as those of the X-ray powder diffraction pattern shown in FIG. 3, 6, 7 or 8 and/or Table 3 and/or Table 5 and/or Table 6 in Example 69 of WO 2006/070195 (the content of which is incorporated herein by reference) and wherein the peaks optionally have the same relative intensity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides combinations based on a crystal of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea free base, which shows an X-ray powder diffraction pattern having characteristic peaks at a diffraction angle (2θ±1.0 degree such as ±0.2 degree, in particular ±0.1 degree) of Table 3 in Example 70 of WO 2006/070195 at pages 204 to 205 (the content of which is incorporated herein by reference).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment the invention provides combinations based on a crystal of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea free base, which possess an X-ray powder diffraction pattern whose characteristic peaks appear as the lattice spacing (d) of Table 3 in Example 70 of WO 2006/070195 at pages 204 to 205 (the content of which is incorporated herein by reference).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe free base of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea exhibits peaks at the same diffraction angles as those of the X-ray powder diffraction pattern shown in \nFIG. 3\n and/or Table 3 (as incorporated herein) and further exhibits an exothermic peak accompanying decomposition in the vicinity of 193° C. according to thermal analysis (DSC).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment the invention provides combinations based on crystals of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea free base, which possess an X-ray powder diffraction pattern whose characteristic peaks appear as the lattice spacing (d) of Table 3 in Example 70 of WO 2006/070195 at pages 204 to 205 (the content of which is incorporated herein by reference).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe free base of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea exhibits peaks at the same diffraction angles as those of the X-ray powder diffraction pattern shown in \nFIG. 3\n and/or Table 3 (as incorporated herein) and further exhibits an exothermic peak accompanying decomposition in the vicinity of 193° C. according to thermal analysis (DSC).\n\n\n \nBiological Activity of Compounds of Formula (I′)\n\n\n \n \n \nCompounds of formula (I′) for use in the combinations of the invention are inhibitors of Aurora kinase. For example they inhibit Aurora A and/or Aurora B.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds also have activity against cyclin dependent kinases. For example, they have activity against CDK2, CDK4, CDK5, CDK6 and CDK 9 kinases, and in particular CDK2. Compounds for use in the combinations of the invention also have activity against glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a consequence of their activity in modulating or inhibiting CDK and Aurora kinases and glycogen synthase kinase, they will be useful as components in combinations which provide a means of arresting, or recovering control of, the cell cycle in abnormally dividing cells. The compounds will prove useful as components of combinations for treating or preventing proliferative disorders such as cancers. The components in the combinations of the invention they will also be useful in treating conditions such as viral infections, type II or non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, autoimmune diseases, head trauma, stroke, epilepsy, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, motor neurone disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration and Pick's disease for example autoimmune diseases and neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSub-groups of disease states and conditions where that the compounds will be useful as components of the combinations of the invention include viral infections, autoimmune diseases and neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCDKs play a role in the regulation of the cell cycle, apoptosis, transcription, differentiation and CNS function. Therefore, CDK inhibitors could be useful in the treatment of diseases in which there is a disorder of proliferation, apoptosis or differentiation such as cancer. In particular RB+ve tumours may be particularly sensitive to CDK inhibitors. RB−ve tumours may also be sensitive to CDK inhibitors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of cancers which may be inhibited include, but are not limited to, a carcinoma, for example a carcinoma of the bladder, breast, colon (e.g. colorectal carcinomas such as colon adenocarcinoma and colon adenoma), kidney, epidermis, liver, lung, for example adenocarcinoma, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung carcinomas, oesophagus, gall bladder, ovary, pancreas e.g. exocrine pancreatic carcinoma, stomach, cervix, thyroid, prostate, or skin, for example squamous cell carcinoma; a hematopoietic tumour of lymphoid lineage, for example leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, B-cell lymphoma, T-cell lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, hairy cell lymphoma, or Burkett's lymphoma; a hematopoietic tumour of myeloid lineage, for example acute and chronic myelogenous leukemias, myelodysplastic syndrome, or promyelocytic leukemia; thyroid follicular cancer; a tumour of mesenchymal origin, for example fibrosarcoma or habdomyosarcoma; a tumour of the central or peripheral nervous system, for example astrocytoma, neuroblastoma, glioma or schwannoma; melanoma; seminoma; teratocarcinoma; osteosarcoma; xeroderma pigmentosum; keratoacanthoma; thyroid follicular cancer; or Kaposi's sarcoma. In addition hematopoietic tumours of lymphoid lineage can include small cell lymphocytic lymphoma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cancers may be cancers which are sensitive to inhibition of any one or more cyclin dependent kinases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhether or not a particular cancer is one which is sensitive to inhibition by a cyclin dependent kinase or an Aurora kinase may be determined by means of a cell growth assay as set out in the examples below or by a method as set out in the section headed “Methods of Diagnosis”.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCDKs are also known to play a role in apoptosis, proliferation, differentiation and transcription and therefore CDK inhibitors could also be useful as components of combinations for the treatment of the following diseases other than cancer; viral infections, for example herpes virus, pox virus, Epstein-Barr virus, Sindbis virus, adenovirus, HIV, HPV, HCV and HCMV; prevention of AIDS development in HIV-infected individuals; chronic inflammatory diseases, for example systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune mediated glomerulonephritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, and autoimmune diabetes mellitus; cardiovascular diseases for example cardiac hypertrophy, restenosis, atherosclerosis; neurodegenerative disorders, for example Alzheimer's disease, AIDS-related dementia, Parkinson's disease, amyotropic lateral sclerosis, retinitis pigmentosa, spinal muscular atropy and cerebellar degeneration; glomerulonephritis; myelodysplastic syndromes, ischemic injury associated myocardial infarctions, stroke and reperfusion injury, arrhythmia, atherosclerosis, toxin-induced or alcohol related liver diseases, haematological diseases, for example, chronic anemia and aplastic anemia; degenerative diseases of the musculoskeletal system, for example, osteoporosis and arthritis, aspirin-sensitive rhinosinusitis, cystic fibrosis, multiple sclerosis, kidney diseases and cancer pain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt has also been discovered that some cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors can be used in combination with other anticancer agents. For example, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor flavopiridol has been used with other anticancer agents in combination therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, in the pharmaceutical compositions, uses or methods of this invention for treating a disease or condition comprising abnormal cell growth, the disease or condition comprising abnormal cell growth in one embodiment is a cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne group of cancers includes human breast cancers (e.g. primary breast tumours, node-negative breast cancer, invasive duct adenocarcinomas of the breast, non-endometrioid breast cancers); and mantle cell lymphomas. In addition, other cancers are colorectal and endometrial cancers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother sub-set of cancers includes breast cancer, ovarian cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, oesophageal cancer, squamous cancer and non-small cell lung carcinomas.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs the compounds for use in the combinations of the invention have activity against Aurora kinase, particular examples of cancers where the Aurora kinase inhibiting compounds of the invention will be useful include: human breast cancers (e.g. primary breast tumours, node-negative breast cancer, invasive duct adenocarcinomas of the breast, non-endometrioid breast cancers); ovarian cancers (e.g. primary ovarian tumours); pancreatic cancers; human bladder cancers; colorectal cancers (e.g. primary colorectal cancers); gastric tumours; renal cancers; cervical cancers; neuroblastomas; melanomas; lymphomas; prostate cancers; leukemia; non-endometrioid endometrial carcinomas; gliomas; and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCancers which may be particularly amenable to Aurora inhibitors include breast, bladder, colorectal, pancreatic, ovarian, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, gliomas and nonendometrioid endometrial carcinomas.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA particular sub-set of cancers which may be particularly amenable to Aurora inhibitors consist of breast, ovarian, colon, liver, gastric and prostate cancers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother subset of cancers that Aurora inhibitors may be particularly amenable to treat are hematological cancers, in particular leukemia. Therefore, in a further embodiment the compounds are used as components in combinations used to treat hematological cancers, in particular leukemia. Particular leukemias are selected from Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML), chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML), B-cell lymphoma (Mantle cell), and Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL—also known as acute lymphocytic leukemia). In one embodiment the leukemias are selected from relapsed or refractory acute myelogenous leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, acute lymphocytic leukemia and chronic myelogenous leukemia. Further leukemias include acute promyelocytic leukaemia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne group of cancers includes human breast cancers (e.g. primary breast tumours, node-negative breast cancer, invasive duct adenocarcinomas of the breast, non-endometrioid breast cancers); and mantle cell lymphomas. In addition, other cancers are colorectal and endometrial cancers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother sub-set of cancers includes hematopoietic tumours of lymphoid lineage, for example leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, mantle cell lymphoma and B-cell lymphoma (such as diffuse large B cell lymphoma).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne particular cancer is chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother particular cancer is mantle cell lymphoma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother particular cancer is diffuse large B cell lymphoma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe combinations of the invention having Aurora kinase inhibitory activity, will be particularly useful in the treatment or prevention of cancers of a type associated with or characterised by the presence of elevated levels of Aurora kinases, for example the cancers referred to in this context in the introductory section of this application. Such cancers include medulloblastoma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds for use in the combinations of the invention are inhibitors of VEGFR activity. In addition they are inhibitors of EpH and FGFR activity. As such, they are useful in providing a means of preventing the growth or inducing apoptosis of neoplasias, particularly by inhibiting angiogenesis. The combinations of the invention are useful in treating or preventing proliferative disorders such as cancers. In particular tumours with activating mutants of VEGFR or upregulation of VEGFR and patients with elevated levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase may be particularly sensitive to the inhibitors. Patients with activating mutants of any of the isoforms of the specific VEGFR as discussed herein may also find treatment with VEGFR inhibitors particularly beneficial. For example, VEGFR overexpression in acute leukemia cells where the clonal progenitor may express VEGFR. Also particular tumours with activating mutants or upregulation or overexpression of any of the isoforms of FGFR such as FGFR2 or FGFR3 may be particularly sensitive to the combinations of the invention and thus patients as discussed herein with such particular tumours may also find treatment with the combinations of the invention particularly beneficial. It may be preferred that the treatment is related to or directed at a mutated form of a receptor tyrosine kinase, such as discussed above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds for use in the combinations of the invention having Flt3, JAK, C-abl, PDK1, Chk1, and Chk2 inhibitory activity, will be particularly useful as constituents of combinations in the treatment or prevention of the following diseases and leukemias: polycythemia vera; essential thrombocythemia; idiopathic myelofibrosis; juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML); Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemias (CMML); megakaryocytic AML (AML M7); megakaryocytic leukaemia; Philadelphia chromosome-negative CML; Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia (CML); imatinib resistant CML; acute myeloid leukemias (AML); myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS); and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore, in a further embodiment the combinations of the invention are used to treat polycythemia vera; essential thrombocythemia; idiopathic myelofibrosis; juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML); Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemias (CMML); megakaryocytic AML (AML M7); megakaryocytic leukaemia; Philadelphia chromosome-negative CML; or imatinib resistant CML.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment the combinations of the invention are used to treat myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) such as polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia and idiopathic myelofibrosis including myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (MMM).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition the combinations of the invention could be used in the treatment of diseases where malignancies are driven by BCR-abl in particular Philadelphia chromosome positive. In a further embodiment the lactate or citrate salts of compound of formula (I) are used to treat myeloproliferative syndrome, Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukamias such as Philadelphia chromosome positive CML and Philadelphia chromosome positive ALL. In particular the combination of the invention could be used to treat Philadelphia chromosome positive ALL.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe combination of the invention having VEGFR inhibitory activity, will be particularly useful in the treatment or prevention of ocular diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in particular wet form of age-related macular degeneration, ischemic proliferative retinopathies such as retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and diabetic retinopathy and hemangioma. Therefore, in a further embodiment combination of the invention are used to treat ocular diseases such as age-related macular degeneration in particular wet form of age-related macular degeneration, Ischemic proliferative retinopathies such as retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and diabetic retinopathy and hemangioma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt may be preferred that the treatment is related to or directed at a mutated form of a kinase, such as discussed herein. Diagnosis of tumours with such mutations could be performed using techniques known to a person skilled in the art and as described herein such as RTPCR and FISH.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe activity of the compounds for use in the combinations of the invention as inhibitors of cyclin dependent kinases, Aurora kinases, glycogen synthase kinase-3, VEGFR, Flt3, JAK, C-abl, PDK1, Chk1, and Chk2 can be measured using the assays set forth in the examples below and the level of activity exhibited by a given compound can be defined in terms of the IC\n50 \nvalue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds for use in the combinations of the invention having FGFR such as FGFR3, Ret, Eph such as EphB2 or EphB4, or cSrc inhibitory activity, will be particularly useful in the treatment or prevention of the following diseases: papillary thyroid carcinoma; multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) types 2A and 2B; familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC); Hirschsprung's disease; Apert (AP) syndrome; Crouzon syndrome; Jackson-Weiss syndrome; Beare-Stevenson cutis gyrata syndrome; Pfeiffer Syndrome (PS); and multiple myelomas. In addition they will be particularly useful in the treatment of head and neck cancers and epithelial cancers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore, in a further embodiment the combinations of the invention are used to treat multiple myelomas, epithelial cancers, head and neck cancers, abnormalities in human skeletal development such as Apert (AP) syndrome, Crouzon syndrome, Jackson-Weiss syndrome, Beare-Stevenson cutis gyrata syndrome and Pfeiffer Syndrome (PS), thyroid cancers such as papillary thyroid carcinoma, familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC), multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) types 2A and 2B and Hirschsprung's disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs the combinations of the invention have activity against FGFR particular cancers include multiple myeloma, bladder, hepatocellular, oral squamous cell carcinoma, cervical, prostate and thyroid carcinomas, lung, breast, and colon cancers. The combinations of the invention having FGFR such as FGFR1 inhibitory activity, will be particularly useful in the treatment or prevention of breast cancer in particular Classic Lobular Carcinomas (CLC). The combinations of the invention having FGFR such as FGFR2 or FGFR3 inhibitory activity will be particularly useful in the treatment or prevention of the skeletal diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, the combinations of the invention having FGFR such as FGFR1, FGFR2 or FGFR3 inhibitory activity, will be particularly useful in the treatment or prevention in pathologies in which progressive fibrosis is a symptom. Fibrotic conditions in which the compounds of the inventions may be useful in the treatment of in include diseases exhibiting abnormal or excessive deposition of fibrous tissue for example in liver cirrhosis, glomerulonephritis, pulmonary fibrosis, systemic fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, as well as the natural process of wound healing. In particular the combinations of the invention may also be useful in the treatment of lung fibrosis in particular in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSince combinations of the invention inhibit PDGFR they may also be useful in the treatment of a number of tumour and leukemia types including glioblastomas such as glioblastoma multiforme, prostate carcinomas, gastrointestinal stromal tumours, liver cancer, kidney cancer, chronic myeloid leukemia, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) as well as hypereosinophilic syndrome, a rare proliferative hematological disorder and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, an infiltrative skin tumour.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe activity of the compounds for use in the combinations of the invention as inhibitors of FGFR such as FGFR3, Ret, Eph such as EphB2 or EphB4, or cSrc can be measured using the assays set forth in the examples below and the level of activity exhibited by a given compound can be defined in terms of the IC\n50 \nvalue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn further aspects, the invention provides:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nA method for the prophylaxis or treatment of a disease state or condition mediated by VEGFR, Flt3, JAK, C-abl, PDK1, Chk1, or Chk2 which method comprises administering to a subject in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a combination of the invention.\n \nA combination of the invention for use in the prophylaxis or treatment of a disease state or condition mediated by VEGFR, Flt3, JAK, C-abl, PDK1, Chk1, or Chk2.\n \nThe use of a combination of the invention for the manufacture of a medicament for the prophylaxis or treatment of a disease state or condition mediated by VEGFR, Flt3, JAK, C-abl, PDK1, Chk1, or Chk2.\n \nA method for the prophylaxis or treatment of a disease state or condition mediated by FGFR such as FGFR3, Ret, Eph such as EphB2 or EphB4, or cSrc which method comprises administering to a subject in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a combination of the invention.\n \nA combination of the invention for use in the prophylaxis or treatment of a disease state or condition mediated by FGFR such as FGFR3, Ret, Eph such as EphB2 or EphB4, or cSrc.\n \nThe use of a combination of the invention for the manufacture of a medicament for the prophylaxis or treatment of a disease state or condition mediated by FGFR such as FGFR3, Ret, Eph such as EphB2 or EphB4, or cSrc.\n \n \n \n\n\nMutated Kinases\n\n\n \n \n \nDrug resistant kinase mutations that arise in patient populations treated with kinase inhibitors can occur, in part, in the regions of the protein that bind to or interact with the particular inhibitor used in therapy. Such mutations reduce the capacity of the inhibitor to bind to and inhibit the kinase in question. This can occur at any of the amino acid residues which interact with the inhibitor or are important for supporting the binding of said inhibitor to the target. Another inhibitor that binds to a target kinase without requiring the interaction with the mutated amino acid residue will likely be unaffected by the mutation and will remain an effective inhibitor of the enzyme (Carter et al, PNAS, 2005, 102, 31, 11011-110116).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne common site at which drug resistant mutations occur is the so-called gate keeper residue. This particular residue forms a key site of interaction for several kinase inhibitors and their respective targets. For example, imatinib (Gleevec) binds in part to threonine 315 the gate keeper residue in the abl kinase domain. T315I mutations are one of the major forms of drug resistance arising in imatinib treated CML patients and may also be seen in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Thus an inhibitor of BCR-abl which does not require an interaction with the T315 for effective target inhibition will still be an effective inhibitor of the T315I imatinib resistant mutation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImatinib inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the receptors c-kit and PDGF-R in addition to blocking abl activity. Thus the drug has found utility in gastrointestinal tumours and hypereosinophilic syndrome, conditions which are dependent on activation of c-kit and PDGFR respectively. PDGF-R activation is associated with other malignancies, which respond to imatinib under different molecular circumstances. These include chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). In another disorder, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, an infiltrative skin tumor, a reciprocal translocation involving the gene encoding the PDGF-B ligand results in constitutive secretion of the chimeric ligand and receptor activation. Gleevec has activity against all three of these diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the T315I resistant disease observed in CML, resistance due to similar gate-keeper mutations has been observed in both c-kit and PDGFr in imatinib-treated patients. Thus the T670I mutation in KIT and the T674I mutation in PDGFR are homologous to the T315I mutation in BCR-abl, and all three mutations confer resistance to clinical-stage ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors including BMS-354825 (dasatanib) and AMN-107 (nilotinib). The clinical importance of this mutation may grow considerably, as to date it appears to represent the primary mechanism of resistance to src/Abl inhibitors in patients. There are currently no effective kinase-targeted treatments for patients with threonine gate-keeper mutations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, the T790M mutation in EGFR is homologous to the T315I mutation in BCR-abl, and this mutation may also confer resistance to clinical-stage ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors. Other clinical-stage ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors therefore include the EGRF inhibitors Iressa (gefitinib), and Tarceva (erlotinib), and SU-11248 (Sunitinib maleate, Sutent), a PDGFr and c-Kit inhibitor and other PDGFR inhibitors such as sorafenib.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAurora kinase does not contain a threonine in the gate keeper region of the kinase active site. Thus many Aurora kinase inhibitors, including those of the current invention do not depend on this interaction to support the inhibition of the kinase activity. Accordingly, Aurora kinase inhibitors with a cross reactivity against abl, kit PDGFR or other kinases will be inhibitory to the drug resistant gate-keeper mutations, in particular threonine gate-keeper mutations, as well as the wild type variants and to be effective in resistant disease arising because of mutations in the gate-keeper region.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe combination of the invention would therefore find particular application in relation to cancers which express a mutated molecular target such as BCRabl, c-kit, PDGF, EGF receptor, ErbB2. Diagnosis of tumours with such mutations could be performed using techniques known to a person skilled in the art and as described herein such as RTPCR and FISH.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, since Aurora kinase does not represent a kinase harbouring a gatekeeper threonine, Aurora inhibitors may also be useful in the treatment of indications that are resistant to existing therapies by virtue of a mutation at that region of the protein. Such indications include gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), the hypereosinophilic syndrome, a rare proliferative hematological disorder and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, an infiltrative skin tumour.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne aspect of the present invention is the use of combination of the invention for the inhibition of a kinase containing a mutation in a region of the protein that binds to or interacts with other cancer agents but does not bind to or interact with the compounds of formula (I).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA further aspect of the present invention is the method of treating a disease mediated by a kinase containing a mutation in a region of the protein that binds to or interacts with other cancer agents but does not bind to or interact with the compounds of formula (I), or formula (I′) or formula (I\n0\n) or sub-groups or examples thereof, with a combination of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParticular kinases for inhibition include c-abl, c-kit, PDGFR including PDGFR-beta and PDGFR-alpha, and ErbB family members such as EGFR (ErbB1), HER2 (ErbB2), ErbB3, and ErbB4, in particular c-abl, c-kit, and PDGFR.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther kinases include those mentioned herein such as members of the Ephrin receptor family including EphA1, EphA2, EphA3, EphA4, EphA5, EphA8, EphA10, EphB1, EphB2, EphB3, EphB5, EphB6, c-Src and kinases of the JAK family such as TYK2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther cancer agents include ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors such as Gleevec, BMS-354825, AMN-107, SU-11248 (Sunitinib maleate, Sutent), sorafenib (BAY 43-9006), Iressa (gefitinib), Tarceva (erlotinib), in particular Gleevec, BMS-354825 (dasatinib), and AMN-107 (nilotinib).

Des. 2005 11:14 (1845-1863).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParticular regions to bind to or interact with other cancer agents include the kinase active site, the ATP binding site, and the gate keeper region in particular threonine gate keeper residue including T315 in abl, T670 in KIT, T674 in PDGFR, and T790 in EGFR. Particular regions of the kinase active site including the ATP binding pocket are discussed in Vulpetti A., Bosotti R.

The binding of the compound of Examples 24, 62, 63 and 64 to plasma proteins was comparably moderate across all species tested, ranging from 61% in rat to 82% in mouse plasma. This could confer the advantage of having more free drug available in the systemic circulation to reach the appropriate site of action to exert its therapeutic effect. Increased free fraction to exert pharmacological action in tumours potentially leads to improved efficacy which thereby allows reduced dosages to be administered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompound I for use in the combinations of the invention also demonstrates improved cell activity in proliferation and clonogenic assays (for example in the assay described in Examples 16 and 17), thereby indicating improved anti-cancer activity against a wide range of solid tumour and leukemic cell lines (Table D).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE D\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInhibitory effect on tumour cell colony formation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\np53\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOrigin\n\n\nOrigin\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\nStatus*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nColon\n\n\nHCT 116\n\n\n13\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nHCT 116 N7\n\n\n14\n\n\n−\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nHT-29\n\n\n11\n\n\n−\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSW620\n\n\n14\n\n\n−\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOvarian\n\n\nA2780\n\n\n7.7\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLung\n\n\nA549\n\n\n12\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nBreast\n \n \nMCF7\n \n \n\n\n20\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPancreatic\n\n\nMIA-Pa-Ca-2\n\n\n7.8\n\n\n−\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n*+ indicates expression of wild type p53; − indicates no expression of p53 or that p53 is non-functional.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound of formula (I) has a reduced toxicity and therefore a greater therapeutic window. In vitro studies with primary human mammary epithelial cells have demonstrated that following treatment of normal cells, cf. tumor cells, fewer become multinucleated or die after treatment, but instead undergo reversible G2/M arrest before re-entering the cell cycle once treatment is stopped. Data indicates that compound-treatment has different effects on tumor cells compared with normal cells. In checkpoint compromised tumor cells compound treatment leads to multinucleation, due to disruption of mitosis, inhibition of cytokinesis and bypass of the spindle checkpoint through Aurora kinase inhibition. It is this multinucleation that appears to lead to cell death. In contrast, in normal checkpoint competent cells treated with compound, fewer cells become multinucleated or die after 24 h compound treatment, instead the greater proportion undergo reversible G2/M arrest and then re-enter the cell cycle once the compound is removed. These differences in effects could reflect the fact that normal cells have checkpoints in place to halt the cell cycle if accurate chromosomal segregation does not take place, such as the post-mitotic p53-dependent checkpoint. In tumor cells these checkpoints are absent allowing mitosis to proceed and multinucleation to occur.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, salt forms of the compound of formula (I) demonstrate improved solubility in aqueous solution and better physicochemical properties, e.g. a lower log D.\n\n\n \nMethods for the Preparation of Compounds of the Formula (I′)\n\n\n \n \n \nCompounds of the formula (I′) can be prepared in accordance with synthetic methods well known to the skilled person.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese are as described in WO 2005/002552 and WO 2006/070195, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

Hormones, Hormone Agonists, Hormone Antagonists and Hormone Modulating Agents\n\n\n \n \n \nDefinition: The terms “corticosteroid”, “antiandrogen”, “antiestrogen”, “antiandrogen agent” and “antiestrogen agent” as used herein refers to those described herein and analogues thereof, including the ionic, salt, solvate, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, ester, prodrugs, isotopes and protected forms thereof (preferably the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof, and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof), as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBiological activity: The hormones, hormone agonists, hormone antagonists and hormone modulating agents (including the antiandrogens and antiestrogen agents) working via one or more pharmacological actions as described herein have been identified as suitable anti-cancer agents. The term ‘hormonal therapies’ is used to collectively to refer to hormones, hormone agonists, hormone antagonists and hormone modulating agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTechnical background: Hormonal therapy plays an important role in the treatment of certain types of cancer where tumours are formed in tissues that are sensitive to hormonal growth control such as the breast and prostate. Thus, for example, estrogen promotes growth of certain breast cancers and testosterone promotes growth of prostate cancers. Since the growth of such tumours is dependent on specific hormones, considerable research has been carried out to investigate whether it is possible to affect tumour growth by increasing or decreasing the levels of certain hormones in the body. Hormonal therapy attempts to control tumour growth in these hormone-sensitive tissues by manipulating the activity of the hormones.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCancers which are derived from either lymphocyte precursors or mature lymphocytes such as certain types of leukemia, Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma often retain the sensitivity to treatment with corticosteroids including prednisolone, predisone and dexamethasone exhibited by mature lymphophocytes. As a consequence treatment with one or more corticosteroids is often incorporated into the treatment of these diseases. Thus contemplated for use with the invention are corticosteroids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWith regard to breast cancer, tumour growth is stimulated by estrogen, and antiestrogen agents have therefore been proposed and widely used for the treatment of this type of cancer. One of the most widely used of such agents is tamoxifen which is a competitive inhibitor of estradiol binding to the estrogen receptor (ER). When bound to the ER, tamoxifen induces a change in the three-dimensional shape of the receptor, inhibiting its binding to the estrogen responsive element on DNA. Under normal physiological conditions, estrogen stimulation increases tumour cell production of transforming growth cell b (TGF-b), an autocrine inhibitor of tumour cell growth. By blocking these pathways, the net effect of tamoxifen treatment is to decrease the autocrine stimulation of breast cancer growth. In addition, tamoxifen decreases the local production of insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) by surrounding tissues: IGF-1 is a paracrine growth factor for the breast cancer cell (Jordan and Murphy, Endocr. Rev., 1990, 11; 578-610). An alternative approach to disease control is to reduce circulating levels of estradiol by inhibition of aromatase—an enzyme which is critical for its production. Both Tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors including anastrazole, letrozole and examestane are widely used in the treatment of post-menopausal women with breast cancer both in the adjuvant and metatsatic setting (e.g. metastatic breast cancer). Tamoxifen is also used in pre-menopausal women with ER-positive tumours. There are various potential side-effects of long-term tamoxifen treatment, for example the possibility of endometrial cancer and the occurrence of thrombo-embolic events. Although aromatase inhibitors are generally better tolerated than tamoxifen patients often experience musculo-skeletal pain and significant bone loss leading to osteoporosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther estrogen receptor antagonists (or selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs)) with broadly similar action to tamoxifen include toremifene and raloxifene. Toremifene is a non-steroidal SERM, which has the chemical name 2-(4-[(Z)-4-chloro-1,2-diphenyl-1-butenyl]-phenoxy)-N,N-dimethylethylamine, and is used for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, side-effects including hot flushes, nausea and dizziness. Raloxifene is a benzothiophene SERM, which has the chemical name [6-hydroxy-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)benzo[b]thien-3-yl]-[4-[2-(1-piperidinyl)ethoxy]-phenyl]-methanone hydrochloride, and is being investigated for the treatment of breast cancer, side-effects including hot flushes and leg cramps.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFulvestrant, which acts by reducing the expression of the ER in tumour tissue has the chemical name 7-α[9-(4,4,5,5,5-pentafluoropentylsulphinyl)-nonyl]estra-1,3,5-(10)-triene-3,17-beta-diol, is often used following treatment with tamoxifen and an aromatase inhibitor (e.g. as a second line treatment of advanced breast cancer). Treatment may be accompanied by hot flushes and endometrial stimulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProstate cancer cells almost invariably overexpress the androgen receptor, and thus antiandrogens are widely used in the treatment of the disease. Antiandrogens are androgen receptor antagonists which bind to the androgen receptor and prevent dihydrotestosterone from binding. Dihydrotestosterone stimulates new growth of prostate cells, including cancerous prostate cells. An example of an antiadrogen is bicalutamide, which has the chemical name (R,S)—N-(4-cyano-3-(4-fluorophenylsulfonyl)-2-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)propanamide, and has been approved for use in combination with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogs for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer, side effects including hot flushes, bone pain, hematuria and gastro-intestinal symptoms. An alternative means of reducing circulating levels of dihydrotestosterone is to directly inhibit its production from testosterone using flutamide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the hormonal therapies include fulvestrant, toremifene and raloxifene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA further type of hormonal cancer treatment comprises the use of progestin analogs. Progestin is the synthetic form of progesterone, a hormone secreted by the ovaries and endometrial lining of the uterus. Acting with estrogen, progesterone promotes breast development and growth of endometrial cells during the menstrual cycle. It is believed that progestins may act by suppressing the production of estrogen from the adrenal glands (an alternate source particularly in post-menopausal women), lowering estrogen receptor levels, or altering tumour hormone metabolism.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProgestin analogs are used in the management of uterine cancer (e.g. advanced uterine cancer) or renal cancer. They can also be used for treating advanced breast cancer, although this use is less common, due to the numerous anti-estrogen treatment options available. Occasionally, progestin analogs are used as hormonal therapy for prostate cancer. An example of a progestin analog is megestrol acetate (a.k.a. megestrel acetate), which has the chemical name 17α-acetyloxy-6-methylpregna-4,6-diene-3,20-dione, and is a putative inhibitor of pituitary gonadotrophin production with a resultant decrease in estrogen secretion, The drug is used for the palliative treatment of advanced carcinoma of the breast or endometrium (i.e., recurrent, inoperable, or metastatic disease), side-effects including oedema and thromoembolic episodes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferences and specific embodiments: A particularly preferred antiestrogen agent for use in accordance with the invention is tamoxifen. Tamoxifen is commercially available for example from AstraZeneca plc under the trade name Nolvadex, or may be prepared for example as described in U.K. patent specifications 1064629 and 1354939, or by processes analogous thereto.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nYet another preferred antiestrogen agent is droloxifene.

No. 2,891,079, or by processes analogous thereto.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, specific embodiments of these anti-cancer agents for use in the combinations of the invention include: tamoxifen; toremifene; raloxifene; medroxyprogesterone; megestrol/megestrel; aminoglutethimide; letrozole; anastrozole; exemestane; goserelin; leuprolide; abarelix; fluoxymestrone; diethylstilbestrol; ketoconazole; fulvestrant; flutamide; bicalutimide; nilutamide; cyproterone and buserelin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, contemplated for use in the combinations of the invention are antiandrogens and antiestrogens.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the hormone, hormone agonist, hormone antagonist or hormone modulating agent is fulvestrant, raloxifene, droloxifene, toremifene, megestrol/megestrel and flutamide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the hormone, hormone agonist, hormone antagonist or hormone modulating agent is fulvestrant, raloxifene, droloxifene, toremifene, megestrol/megestrel and bexarotene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the hormones, hormone agonists, hormone antagonists and hormone modulating agents include corticosteroids, antiandrogens, antiestrogens and GNRAs. In another embodiment the hormones, hormone agonists, hormone antagonists and hormone modulating agents include antiandrogens, antiestrogens and GNRAs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPosology: The antiandrogen or antiestrogen agent is advantageously administered in a dosage of about 1 to 100 mg daily depending on the particular agent and the condition being treated. Tamoxifen is advantageously administered orally in a dosage of 5 to 50 mg, preferably 10 to 20 mg twice a day (or 20 mg once a day), continuing the therapy for sufficient time to achieve and maintain a therapeutic effect.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWith regard to the other preferred antiestrogen agents: fulvestrant is advantageously administered in the form of a 250 mg monthly injection (though doses of 250-750 mg per month may also be employed); toremifene is advantageously administered orally in a dosage of about 60 mg once a day, continuing the therapy for sufficient time to achieve and maintain a therapeutic effect; droloxifene is advantageously administered orally in a dosage of about 20-100 mg once a day; and raloxifene is advantageously administered orally in a dosage of about 60 mg once a day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWith regard to the preferred antiandrogen bicalutamide, this is generally administered in an oral dosage of 50 mg daily.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWith regard to the preferred progestin analog megestrol/megestrel acetate, this is generally administered in an oral dosage of 40 mg four times daily.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dosages noted above may generally be administered for example once, twice or more per course of treatment, which may be repeated for example daily or every 7, 14, 21 or 28 days in particular every 7, 14, 21 or 28 days.\n\n\n \nAromatase Inhibitors\n\n\n \n \n \nOf the hormones, hormone agonists, hormone antagonists and hormone modulating agents for use in the combinations of the invention, preferred are aromatase inhibitors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn post-menopausal women, the principal source of circulating estrogen is from conversion of adrenal androgens (androstenedione and testosterone) to estrogens (estrone and estradiol) by the aromatase enzyme in peripheral tissues. Estrogen deprivation through aromatase inhibition or inactivation is an effective and selective treatment for some post-menopausal patients with hormone-dependent breast cancer. Examples of such hormone modulating agents include aromatase inhibitors or inactivators, such as exemestane, anastrozole, letrozole and aminoglutethimide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemestane, which has the chemical name 6-methylenandrosta-1,4-diene-3,17-dione, is used for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in post-menopausal women whose disease has progressed following tamoxifen therapy, side effects including hot flashes and nausea. Anastrozole, which has the chemical name, α,α,α′,α′-tetramethyl-5-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl)-1,3-benzenediacetonitrile, is used for adjuvant treatment of post-menopausal women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer, and also for the first-line treatment of post-menopausal women with hormone receptor-positive or hormone receptor-unknown locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, and for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in post-menopausal women with disease progression following tamoxifen therapy. Administration of anastrozole usually results in side-effects including gastrointestinal disturbances, musculoskeletal pain, rashes and headaches. Letrozole, which has the chemical name 4,4′-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethylene)-dibenzonitrile, is used for the adjuvant treatment of ER positive breast cancer, for first-line treatment of post-menopausal women with hormone receptor-positive or hormone receptor-unknown locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, and for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in post-menopausal women with disease progression following antiestrogen therapy, possible side-effects including occasional transient thrombocytopenia and elevation of liver transaminases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAminoglutethimide which has the chemical name 3-(4-aminophenyl)-3-ethyl-2,6-piperidinedione, is also used for treating breast cancer but suffers from the side-effects of skin rashes and less commonly thrombocytopenia and leukopenia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred aromatase inhibitors include letrozole, anastrozole, exemestane and aminoglutethimide. Letrozole is commercially available for example from Novartis A.G. under the trade name Femara, or may be prepared for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,978,672, or by processes analogous thereto. Anastrozole is commercially available for example from AstraZeneca plc under the trade name Arimidex, or may be prepared for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,935,437, or by processes analogous thereto. Exemestane is commercially available for example from Pharmacia Corporation under the trade name Aromasin, or may be prepared for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,978,672, or by processes analogous thereto. Aminoglutethimide is commercially available for example from Novartis A.G. under the trade name Cytadren, or may be prepared for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 2,848,455, or by processes analogous thereto. The aromatase inhibitor vorozole, which may be prepared for example as described in European patent specification No. 293978, or by processes analogous thereto, can also be used in accordance with the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWith regard to the preferred aromatase inhihibitors, these are generally administered in an oral daily dosage in the \nrange\n 1 to 1000 mg, for example letrozole in a dosage of about 2.5 mg once a day; anastrozole in a dosage of about 1 mg once a day; exemestane in a dosage of about 25 mg once a day; and aminoglutethimide in a dosage of 250 mg 2-4 times daily.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParticularly preferred are aromatase inhibitors selected from the agents described herein, for example, letrozole, anastrozole, exemestane and aminoglutethimide.\n\n\n \nGNRAs\n\n\n \n \n \nOf the hormones, hormone agonists, hormone antagonists and hormone modulating agents for use in the combinations of the invention, preferred are agents of the GNRA class.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDefinition: As used herein the term GNRA is intended to define gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists and antagonists (including those described below), together with the ionic, salt, solvate, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, ester, prodrugs, isotopes and protected forms thereof (preferably the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof, and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof), as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTechnical background: When released from the hypothalamus in the brain, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists stimulate the pituitary gland to produce gonadotropins. Gonadotropins are hormones that stimulate androgen synthesis in the testes and estrogen synthesis in the ovaries. When GnRH agonists are first administered, they can cause an increase in gonadotropin release, but with continued administration, GnRH will block gonadotropin release, and therefore decrease the synthesis of androgen and estrogen. GnRH analogs are used to treat metastatic prostate cancer. They have also been approved for treatment of metastatic breast cancer in pre-menopausal women. Examples of GnRH analogs include goserelin acetate and leuprolide acetate. In contrast GnRH antagonists such as aberelix cause no initial GnRH surge since they have no agonist effects. However, due to their narrow therapeutic index, their use is currently limited to advanced prostate cancer that is refractory to other hormonal treatment such as GnRH agonists and anti-androgens.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGoserelin acetate is a synthetic decapeptide analog of LHRH or GnRH, and has the chemical structure of pyro-Glu-His-Trp-Ser-Tyr-D-Ser(Bu)-Leu-Arg-Pro-Azgly-NH\n2 \nacetate, and is used for the treatment of breast and prostate cancers and also endometriosis, side effects include hot flashes, bronchitis, arrhythmias, hypertension, anxiety and headaches. Leuprolide acetate is a synthetic nonapeptide analog of GnRH or LHRH, and has the chemical name 5-oxo-L-prolyl-L-histidyl-L-tryptophyl-L-seryl-L-tyrosyl-D-leucyl-L-leucyl-L-arginyl-N-ethyl-L-prolinamide acetate. Leuprolide acetate is used for the treatment of prostate cancer, endometriosis, and also breast cancer, side effects being similar to those of goserelin acetate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAbarelix is a synthetic decapeptide Ala-Phe-Ala-Ser-Tyr-Asn-Leu-Lys-Pro-Ala, and has the chemical name N-Acetyl-3-(2-naphthalenyl)-D-alanyl-4-chloro-D-phenylalanyl-3-(3-pyridinyl)-D-alanyl-L-seryl-N-methyl-L-tyrosyl-D-asparaginyl-L-leucyl-N-6-(1-methylethyl)-L-lysyl-L-prolyl-D-alaninamide. Abarelix can be prepared according to R. W. Roeske, WO9640757 (1996 to Indiana Univ. Found.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferences and specific embodiments: Preferred GnRH agonists and antagonists for use in accordance with the invention include any of the GNRAs described herein, including in particular goserelin, leuprolide/leuporelin, triptorelin, buserelin, abarelix, goserelin acetate and leuprolide acetate. Particularly preferred are goserelin and leuprolide. Goserelin acetate is commercially available for example from AstraZeneca plc under the trade name Zoladex, or may be prepared for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,510,460, or by processes analogous thereto. Leuprolide acetate is commercially available for example from TAP Pharmaceuticals Inc. under the trade name Lupron, or may be prepared for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,914,412, or by processes analogous thereto. Goserelin is commercially available from AstraZeneca under the trade name Zoladex and may be prepared for example as described in ICI patent publication U.S. Pat. No. 4,100,274 or Hoechst patent publication EP475184 or by processes analagous thereto. Leuprolide is commercially available in the USA from TAP Pharmaceuticals Inc. under the trade name Lupron and in Europe from Wyeth under the trade name Prostap and may be prepared for example as described in Abbott patent publication U.S. Pat. No. 4,005,063 or by processes analogous thereto. Triptorelin is commercially available from Watson Pharma under the trade name Trelstar and may be prepared for example as described in Tulane patent publication U.S. Pat. No. 5,003,011 or by processes analagous thereto. Buserelin is commercially available under the trade name Suprefact and may be prepared for example as described in Hoechst patent publication U.S. Pat. No. 4,024,248 or by processes analogous thereto. Abarelix is commercially available from Praecis Pharmaceuticals under the trade name Plenaxis and may be prepared for example as described by Jiang et al., J Med Chem (2001), 44(3), 453-467 or Polypeptide Laboratories patent publication WO2003055900 or by processes analogous thereto.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther GnRH agonists and antagonists for use in accordance with the invention include, but are not limited to, Histrelin from Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp, Nafarelin acetate from Roche, and Deslorelin from Shire Pharmaceuticals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPosology: The GnRH agonists and antagonists are advantageously administered in dosages of 1.8 mg to 100 mg, for example 3.6 mg monthly or 10.8 mg every three months for goserelin or 7.5 mg monthly, 22.5 mg every three months or 30 mg every four months for leuprolide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWith regard to the preferred GnRH analogs, these are generally administered in the following dosages, namely goserelin acetate as a 3.6 mg subcutaneous implant every 4 weeks, and leuprolide as a 7.5 mg intramuscular depot every month.\n\n\n \n2. Cytokines and Cytokine-Activating Agents\n\n\n \n \n \nDefinition: The term “cytokine” is a term of art, and references to cytokines herein is intended to cover the cytokine per se together with the ionic, salt, solvate, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, ester, prodrugs, isotopes and protected forms thereof (preferably the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof, and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof), as described above. The term “cytokine-activating agent” is intended to cover any agent which (directly or indirectly) induces, potentiates, stimulates, activates or promotes endogenous cytokine production or the activity thereof in vivo, together with the ionic, salt, solvate, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, ester, prodrugs, isotopes and protected forms thereof (preferably the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof, and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof), as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTechnical background: Cytokines are a class of proteins or polypeptides predominantly produced by cells of the immune system which have the capacity to control the function of a second cell. In relation to anticancer therapy cytokines are used to control the growth or kill the cancer cells directly and to modulate the immune system more effectively to control the growth of tumours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCytokines, such as interferon (IFN) alpha and Interleukin-2, induce growth arrest or tumour cell death. IFN-alpha is used the treatment of malignant melanoma, chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), hairy cell leukemia, and Kaposi's sarcoma. Interleukin-2 is used in the treatment of malignant melanoma and renal cell cancer either alone or in combination with IFN-alpha.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCytokines exhibit antitumour activity through a variety of different mechanisms including the stimulation of immune cells to fight tumors For example, the T cell growth factor, IL-2 promotes T-cell and natural killer (NK) cell activation. Other cytokines such as the interferons and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) act on antigen presenting cells to facilitate the activation of the key immune effector B cells and T cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferences and specific embodiments: Any of the cytokines and cytokine-modulating agents described herein may find application in the invention, including in particular interferons (such as interferon-γ and interferon α) and interleukins (e.g. interleukin 2). Interferon α-2b (recombinant) is available commercially under the trade name of INTRON® A from Schering Plough.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther preferred interferons include Interferon α-2a which is available under the trade name of ROFERON from Roche.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA particularly preferred interleukin is PROLEUKIN® IL-2 (aldesleukin) which is available from Chiron Corp.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPosology: The interferons are administered by injection in a schedule which is dependent on the particular indication. For IntronA treatment of malignant melanoma preferably in a schedule that includes induction treatment on 5 consecutive days per week for 4 weeks as an intravenous (IV) infusion at a dose of 20 million IU/m2, followed by maintenance treatment three times per week for 48 weeks as a subcutaneous (SC) injection, at a dose of 10 million IU/m2. For Intron A treatment of non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma preferably in a schedule of 5 million IU subcutaneously three times per week for up to 18 months in conjunction with an anthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe recommended initial dose of Roferon-A for CML is 9 MIU daily administered as a subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. Based on clinical experience short-term tolerance may be improved by gradually increasing the dose of Roferon-A over the first week of administration from 3 MIU daily for 3 days to 6 MIU daily for 3 days to the target dose of 9 MIU daily for the duration of the treatment period. The induction dose of Roferon-A for Hairy cell leukaemia is 3 MIU daily for 16 to 24 weeks, administered as a subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. Subcutaneous administration is particularly suggested for, but not limited to, thrombocytopenic patients (platelet count<50,000) or for patients at risk for bleeding. The recommended maintenance dose is 3 MIU, three times a week (tiw).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor PROLEUKIN the following schedule has been used to treat adult patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (metastatic RCC) or metastatic melanoma (each course of treatment consists of two 5-day treatment cycles separated by a rest period): 600,000 IU/kg (0.037 mg/kg) dose administered every 8 hours by a 15-minute IV infusion for a maximum of 14 doses. Following 9 days of rest, the schedule is repeated for another 14 doses, for a maximum of 28 doses per course, as tolerated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCytokine-activating agents: Preferred cytokine-activating agents include: (a) Picibanil from Chugai Pharmaceuticals, an IFN-gamma-inducing molecule for carcinoma treatment; (b) Romurtide from Daiichi which activates the cytokine network by stimulation of colony stimulating factor release; (c) Sizofuran from Kaken Pharmaceutical, a beta1-3, beta1-6 D-glucan isolated from suehirotake mushroom, which stimulates production of IFN-gamma and IL-2 by mitogen-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and is useful in uterine cervix tumour and lung tumour treatment; (d) Virulizin from Lorus Therapeutics Inc, a NK agonist and cytokine release modulator which stimulates IL-17 synthesis and IL-12 release for the treatment of sarcoma, melanoma, pancreas tumours, breast tumours, lung tumours, and Kaposis sarcoma (e) \nThymosin alpha\n 1, a synthetic 28-amino acid peptide with multiple biological activities primarily directed towards immune response enhancement for increased production of Th1 cytokines, which is useful in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, melanoma, carcinoma, and lung brain and renal tumours.\n\n\n \n3. Retinoids and Rexinoids\n\n\n \n \n \nDefinition: The term “retinoid” is a term of art used herein in a broad sense to include not only the specific retinoids disclosed herein, but also the ionic, salt, solvate, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, ester, prodrugs, isotopes and protected forms thereof (preferably the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof, and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof), as described above. The term ‘rexinoids’ refers to synthetic agents that bind specifically to retinoid X receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTechnical background: Tretinoin is an endogenous metabolite of retinol. It induces terminal differentiation in several hemopoietic precursor cell lines, including human myeloid cell lines. Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL) is associated with a specific translocation between \nchromosomes\n 15 and 17; the retinoic acid receptor—α is located on chromosome 17. The translocation appears to inhibit differentiation and lead to carcinogenesis; tretinoin may overcome this when used in high doses. Tretinoin induces remissions in 64-100% of APL patients, with time to remission usually between 8 and 119 days of therapy. Acquired resistance during therapy is common especially with prolonged dosing (4-6 months).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlitretinoin is a 9-cis-retinoic acid derivative which appears to be selective for the RXR subfamily of retinoid receptors. This selectivity may preserve therapeutic antineoplastic effects while reducing significant side effects of retinoid therapy including birth defects at fetal exposure, irritation of skin and mucosal surfaces or skeletal abnormalities. Topical alitretinoin is approved in the US for the treatment of Kaposi's Sarcoma. Oral and gel (topical) formulations of bexarotene (Targretin; LGD-1069), a retinoid X receptor (RXR)-selective antitumor retinoid, are available for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nU.S. Pat. No. 6,127,382, WO 01/70668, WO 00/68191, WO 97/48672, WO 97/19052 and WO 97/19062 (all to Allergan) each describe compounds having retinoid-like activity for use in the treatment of various hyperproliferative diseases including cancers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferences and specific embodiments: Preferred retinoids for use in accordance with the invention include any of the retinoids disclosed herein, including in particular tretinoin (all-trans retinoic acid), alitretinoin and bexarotene. Tretinoin (Retacnyl, Aknoten, Tretin M) is commercially available from Roche under the trade name Vesanoid and may be prepared for example as described in D. A. van Dorp, J. R. Arens, Rec. Tray. Chim. 65, 338 (1946); C. D. Robeson et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 77, 4111 (1955); R. Marbet, D E 2061507; U.S. Pat. No. 3,746,730 (1971, 1973 both to Hoffmann-La Roche), or by processes analogous thereto. Alitretinoin (9-cis-Tretinoin, Panrexin) is commercially available from Ligand Pharmaceuticals under the trade name Panretin and may be prepared for example as described in C. D. Robeson et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 77, 4111 (1955); M. Matsui et al., J. Vitaminol. 4, 178 (1958); M. F. Boehm et al., J. Med. Chem. 37, 408 (1994), or by processes analogous thereto. Bexarotene (Targrexin, Targret) is commercially available from Eisai Inc under the trade name Targretin and may be prepared for example as described in M. F. Boehm et al., WO 9321146 (1993 to Ligand Pharm.); M. L. Dawson et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,466,861 (1995 to SRI Int.; La Jolla Cancer Res. Found.), or by processes analogous thereto.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPosology: Tretinoin is advantageously administered in dosages of 25 mg/m\n2\n/day to 45 mg/m\n2\n/day by mouth in two divided doses for 30 days after complete remission or up to a maximum of 90 days. Alitretinoin gel 0.1% is advantageously administered initially by application two (2) times a day to cutaneous KS lesions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBexarotene is advantageously administered initially as a single daily oral dose of 300 mg/m\n2\n/day. The dose may be adjusted to 200 mg/m\n2\n/day then to 100 mg/m\n2\n/day, or temporarily suspended, if necessitated by toxicity. If there is no tumor response after eight weeks of treatment and if the initial dose of 300 mg/m2/day is well tolerated, the dose may be escalated to 400 mg/m\n2\n/day with careful monitoring. Bexarotene gel is advantageously applied initially once every other day for the first week. The application frequency may be increased at weekly intervals to once daily, then twice daily, then three times daily and finally four times daily according to individual lesion tolerance.\n\n\n \n4. Monoclonal Antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \nAny monoclonal antibody e.g. including but not limited to one or more cell surface antigen(s) may be used in the combinations of the invention. Antibody specificity may be assayed or determined using any of a wide variety of techniques well-known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDefinition: The term “monoclonal antibody” used herein refers to antibodies from any source, and so includes those that are fully human and also those which contain structural or specificity determining elements derived from other species (and which can be referred to as, for example, chimeric or humanized antibodies).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTechnical background: The use of monoclonal antibodies is now widely accepted in anticancer chemotherapy as they are highly specific and can therefore bind and affect disease specific targets, thereby sparing normal cells and causing fewer side-effects than traditional chemotherapies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne group of cells which have been investigated as targets for antibody chemotherapy for the treatment of various cancers are those bearing the cell-surface antigens comprising the cluster designation (CD) molecules which are over-expressed or aberrantly expressed in tumour cells, for example CD20, CD22, CD33 and CD52 which are over-expressed on the tumour cell surface, most notably in tumours of hematopoietic origin. Antibodies to these CD targets (anti-CD antibodies) include the monoclonal antibodies rituximab (a.k.a. rituxamab), tositumomab and gemtuzumab ozogamicin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRituximab/rituxamab is a mouse/human chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody which has been used extensively for the treatment of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma including relapsed, refractory low-grade or follicular lymphoma. The product is also being developed for various other indications including chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and rheumatoid arthritis. Side effects of rituximab/rituxamab may include hypoxia, pulmonary infiltrates, acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation or cardiogenic shock. Tositumomab is a cell-specific anti-CD20 antibody labelled with iodine-131, for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and lymphocytic leukaemia. Possible side-effects of tositumomab include thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin is a cytotoxic drug (calicheamicin) linked to a human monoclonal antibody specific for CD33. Calicheamicin is a very potent antitumour agent, over 1,000 times more potent than adriamycin. Once released inside the cell, calicheamicin binds in a sequence-specific manner to the minor groove of DNA, undergoes rearrangement, and exposes free radicals, leading to breakage of double-stranded DNA, and resulting in cell apoptosis (programmed cell death). Gemtuzumab ozogamicin is used as a second-line treatment for acute myeloid leukaemia, possible side-effects including severe hypersensitivity reactions such as anaphylaxis, and also hepatotoxicity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlemtuzumab (Millennium Pharmaceuticals, also known as Campath) is a humanized monoclonal antibody against CD52 useful for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and Non-Hodgkin lymphoma which induces the secretion of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma and IL-6.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferences: Preferred monoclonal antibodies for use according to the invention include anti-CD antibodies, including alemtuzumab, CD20, CD22 and CD33. Particularly preferred are monoclonal antibody to cell surface antigens, including anti-CD antibodies (for example, CD20, CD22, CD33) as described above. Other preferred monoclonal antibodies include those which target interleukin 6 (IL-6).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecific embodiments: In one embodiment, the monoclonal antibody is an antibody to the cluster designation CD molecules, for example, CD20, CD22, CD33 and CD52. In another embodiment, the monoclonal antibody to cell surface antigen is selected from rituximab/rituxamab, tositumomab and gemtuzumab ozogamicin. Other monoclonal antibodies that may be used according to the invention include bevacizumab.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary formulations: Monoclonal antibodies to cell surface antigen(s) for use according to the invention include CD52 antibodies (e.g. alemtuzumab) and other anti-CD antibodies (for example, CD20, CD22 and CD33), as described herein. Preferred are therapeutic combinations comprising a monoclonal antibody to cell surface antigen(s), for example anti-CD antibodies (e.g. CD20, CD22 and CD33) which exhibit an advantageous efficacious effect, for example, against tumour cell growth, in comparison with the respective effects shown by the individual components of the combination.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCD52 selectivity has also been achieved through the combination of a specific ligand with diphtheria toxin which is released intracellularly (denileukin difitox; Ontak). This approach has been licensed for use in the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and is under investigation for the treatment of other types of non-hodgkin's lymphoma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition targeting structures other than tumour cells themselves have also been shown to be efficacious in cancer therapy. This approach has been most effective in inhibiting new blood vessel formation using bevacuzimab, a monoclonal antibody directed against circulating Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor. This approach may be useful in the treatment of a wide range of malignancies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred examples of monoclonal antibodies to cell surface antigens (anti-CD antibodies) include rituximab/rituxamab, tositumomab and gemtuzumab ozogamicin. Rituximab/rituxamab is commercially available from F Hoffman-La Roche Ltd under the trade name Mabthera, or may be obtained as described in PCT patent specification No. WO 94/11026. Tositumomab is commercially available from GlaxoSmithKline plc under the trade name Bexxar, or may be obtained as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,595,721. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin is commercially available from Wyeth Research under the trade name Mylotarg, or may be obtained as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,877,296.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBiological activity: Monoclonal antibodies (e.g. monoclonal antibodies to one or more cell surface antigen(s)) have been identified as suitable anti-cancer agents. Antibodies are effective through a variety of mechanisms. They can block essential cellular growth factors or receptors, directly induce apoptosis, bind to target cells or deliver cytotoxic payloads such as radioisotopes and toxins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPosology: The anti-CD antibodies may be administered for example in dosages of 5 to 400 mg per square meter (mg/m\n2\n) of body surface; in particular gemtuzumab ozogamicin may be administered for example in a dosage of about 9 mg/m\n2 \nof body surface; rituximab/rituxamab may be administered for example in a dosage of about 375 mg/m\n2 \nas an IV infusion once a week for four doses; the dosage for tositumomab must be individually quantified for each patient according to the usual clinical parameters such as age, weight, sex and condition of the patient to ensure appropriate delivery of the radioisotope.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese dosages may be administered for example once, twice or more per course of treatment, which may be repeated for example every 7, 14, 21 or 28 days.\n\n\n \n5. Camptothecin Compounds\n\n\n \n \n \nDefinition: The term “camptothecin compound” as used herein refers to camptothecin per se or analogues of camptothecin as described herein, including the ionic, salt, solvate, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, ester, prodrugs, isotopes and protected forms thereof (preferably the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof, and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof), as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTechnical background: Camptothecin compounds are compounds related to or derived from the parent compound camptothecin which is a water-insoluble alkaloid derived from the Chinese tree \nCamptothecin acuminate \nand the Indian tree \nNothapodytes foetida\n. Camptothecin has a potent inhibitory activity against DNA biosynthesis and has shown high activity against tumour cell growth in various experimental systems. Its clinical use in anti-cancer therapy is, however, limited significantly by its high toxicity, and various analogues have been developed in attempts to reduce the toxicity of camptothecin while retaining the potency of its anti-tumour effect. Examples of such analogues include irinotecan and topotecan.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese compounds have been found to be specific inhibitors of DNA topoisomerase I. Topoisomerases are enzymes that are capable of altering DNA topology in eukaryotic cells. They are critical for important cellular functions and cell proliferation. There are two classes of topoisomerases in eukaryotic cells, namely type I and type II. Topoisomerase I is a monomeric enzyme having a molecular weight of approximately 100,000. The enzyme binds to DNA and introduces a transient single-strand break, unwinds the double helix (or allows it to unwind) and subsequently reseals the break before dissociating from the DNA strand.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIrinotecan, namely 7-ethyl-10-(4-(1-piperidino)-1-piperidino)carbonyloxy-(20S)-camptothecin, and its hydrochloride, also known as CPT 11, have been found to have improved potency and reduced toxicity, and superior water-solubility. Irinotecan has been found to have clinical efficacy in the treatment of various cancers especially colorectal cancer. Another important camptothecin compound is topotecan, namely (S)-9-dimethylaminomethyl-10-hydroxy-camptothecin which, in clinical trials, has shown efficacy against several solid tumours, particularly ovarian and cervical cancer and small cell lung cancer or alternatively ovarian cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary formulations: A parenteral pharmaceutical formulation for administration by injection and containing a camptothecin compound can be prepared by dissolving 100 mg of a water soluble salt of the camptothecin compound (for example a compound as described in EP 0321122 and in particular the examples therein) in 10 ml of sterile 0.9% saline and then sterilising the solution and filling the solution into a suitable container.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBiological activity: The camptothecin compounds of the combinations of the invention are specific inhibitors of DNA topoisomerase I are described above and have activity against various cancers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrior art references: WO 01/64194 (Janssen) discloses combinations of farnesyl transferase inhibitors and camptothecin compounds. EP 137145 (Rhone Poulenc Rorer) discloses camptothecin compounds including irinotecan. EP 321122 (SmithKline Beecham) discloses camptothecin compounds including topotecan.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProblems: Although camptothecin compounds are widely used as chemotherapeutic agents in humans, they are not therapeutically effective in all patients or against all types of tumours. There is therefore a need to increase the inhibitory efficacy of camptothecin compounds against tumour growth and also to provide a means for the use of lower dosages of camptothecin compounds to reduce the potential for adverse toxic side effects to the patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferences: Preferred camptothecin compounds for use in accordance with the invention include irinotecan and topotecan referred to above. Irinotecan is commercially available for example from Rhone-Poulenc Rorer under the trade name “Campto” and may be prepared for example as described in European patent specification No. 137145 or by processes analogous thereto. Topotecan is commercially available for example from SmithKline Beecham under the trade name “Hycamtin” and may be prepared for example as described in European patent number 321122 or by processes analogous thereto. Other camptothecin compounds may be prepared in conventional manner for example by processes analogous to those described above for irinotecan and topotecan.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecific embodiments: In one embodiment, the camptothecin compound is irinotecan. In another embodiment, the camptothecin compound is a camptothecin compound other than irinotecan, for example a camptothecin compound such as topotecan.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPosology: The camptothecin compound is advantageously administered in a dosage of 0.1 to 400 mg per square metre (mg/m\n2\n) of body surface area, for example 1 to 300 mg/m\n2\n, particularly for irinotecan in a dosage of about 100 to 350 mg/m\n2 \nand for topotecan in about 1 to 2 mg/m\n2 \nper course of treatment. These dosages may be administered for example once, twice or more per course of treatment, which may be repeated daily or every 7, 14, 21 or 28 days in particular every 7, 14, 21 or 28 days.\n\n\n \n6. Antimetabolites\n\n\n \n \n \nDefinition: The terms “antimetabolic compound” and “antimetabolite” are used as synonyms and define antimetabolic compounds or analogues of antimetabolic compounds as described herein, including the ionic, salt, solvate, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, ester, prodrugs, isotopes and protected forms thereof (preferably the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof, and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof), as described above. Thus, the antimetabolic compounds, otherwise known as antimetabolites, referred to herein constitute a large group of anticancer drugs that interfere with metabolic processes vital to the physiology and proliferation of cancer cells. Such compounds include nucleoside derivatives, either pyrimidine or purine nucleoside analogs, that inhibit DNA synthesis, and inhibitors of thymidylate synthase and/or dihydrofolate reductase enzymes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTechnical background: Antimetabolites (or antimetabolic compounds), constitute a large group of anticancer drugs that interfere with metabolic processes vital to the physiology and proliferation of cancer cells. Such compounds include nucleoside derivatives, either pyrimidine or purine nucleoside analogues, that inhibit DNA synthesis, and inhibitors of thymidylate synthase and/or dihydrofolate reductase enzymes. Anti-tumour nucleoside derivatives have been used for many years for the treatment of various cancers. Among the oldest and most widely used of these derivatives is 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) which has been used to treat a number of cancers such as colorectal, breast, hepatic and head and neck tumours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to enhance the cytotoxic effect of 5-FU, leucovorin has been used to stabilise the resulting thymidylate synthase/5-FU complex thus further increasing its inhibition. However, various factors limit the use of 5-FU, for example tumour resistance, toxicities, including gastrointestinal and haematological effects, and the need for intravenous administration. Various approaches have been taken to overcome these disadvantages including proposals to overcome the poor bioavailability of 5-FU and also to increase the therapeutic index of 5-FU, either by reducing systemic toxicity or by increasing the amount of active drug reaching the tumour.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne such compound which provides an improved therapeutic advantage over 5-FU is capecitabine, which has the chemical name [1-(5-deoxy-(3-D-ribofuranosyl)-5-fluoro-1,2-dihydro-2-oxo-4-pyrimidinyl]-carbamic acid pentyl ester. Capecitabine is a pro-drug of 5-FU which is well absorbed after oral dosing and delivers pharmacologically-active concentrations of 5-FU to tumours. As well as offering potentially superior activity to 5-FU, it can also be used for oral therapy with prolonged administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGemcitabine is a nucleoside analogue which has the \nchemical name\n 2′-deoxy-2′,2′-difluoro-cytidine, and which has been used in the treatment of various cancers including non-small cell lung cancer, breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancer in particular non-small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer. Further anti-tumour nucleosides include cytarabine and fludarabine. Cytarabine, also known as ara-C, which has the chemical name 1-β-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine, has been found useful in the treatment of acute leukemia, chronic myelocytic leukemia and erythroleukemia. Cytarabine, also known as ara-C, which has the chemical name 1-β-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine, has been found useful in the treatment of acute myelocytic leukemia, chronic myelocytic leukemia (blast phase), acute lymphocytic leukemia and erythroleukemia. Fludarabine is a DNA synthesis inhibitor, which has the chemical name 9-β-D-arabinofuranosyl-2-fluoro-adenine, and is used for the treatment of refractory B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Other anti-folate antimetabolites used in anticancer chemotherapy include the enzyme inhibitors raltitrexed, pemetrexed, and methotrexate. Raltitrexed is a folate-based thymidylate synthase inhibitor, which has the chemical name N-[5-[N-[(3,4-dihydro-2-methyl-4-oxo-6-quinazolinyl)-methyl-N-methylamino]-2-thenoyl]-L-glutamic acid, and is used in the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer. Pemetrexed is a thymidylate synthase and transferase inhibitor, which has the chemical name N-[4-[2-(2-amino-4,7-dihydro-4-oxo-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-5-yl)ethyl]benzoyl]-L-glutamic acid, disodium salt, and is used for the treatment of mesothelioma and locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) in previously treated patients. Methotrexate is an antimetabolite which interrupts cell division by inhibiting DNA replication through dihydrofolate reductase inhibition, resulting in cell death, and has the chemical name is N-[4-[[(2,4-diamino-6-pteridinyl)methyl]-ethylamino]benzoyl]-L-glutamic acid, and is used for the treatment of acute lymphocytic leukemia, and also in the treatment of breast cancer, epidermoid cancers of the head and neck, and lung cancer, particularly squamous cell and small cell types, and advanced stage non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, in particular in the treatment of breast cancer, epidermoid cancers of the head and neck, and advanced stage non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBiological activity: The antimetabolic compounds of the combinations of the invention interfere with metabolic processes vital to the physiology and proliferation of cancer cells as described above and have activity against various cancers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProblems: These anticancer agents have a number of side-effects especially myelosuppression and in some cases nausea and diarrhea. There is therefore a need to provide a means for the use of lower dosages to reduce the potential of adverse toxic side effects to the patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferences: Preferred antimetabolic compounds for use in accordance with the invention include anti-tumour nucleosides such as 5-fluorouracil, gemcitabine, capecitabine, cytarabine and fludarabine and enzyme inhibitors such as ralitrexed, pemetrexed and methotrexate referred to herein. Thus, preferred antimetabolic compounds for use in accordance with the invention are anti-tumour nucleoside derivatives including 5-fluorouracil, gemcitabine, capecitabine, cytarabine and fludarabine referred to herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther preferred antimetabolic compounds for use in accordance with the invention are enzyme inhibitors including ralitrexed, pemetrexed and methotrexate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n5-Fluorouracil is widely available commercially, or may be prepared for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 2,802,005. Gemcitabine is commercially available for example from Eli Lilly and Company under the trade name Gemzar, or may be prepared for example as described in European patent specification No. 122707, or by processes analogous thereto. Capecitabine is commercially available for example from Hoffman-La Roche Inc under the trade name Xeloda, or may be prepared for example as described in European patent specification No. 698611, or by processes analogous thereto. Cytarabine is commercially available for example from Pharmacia and Upjohn Co under the trade name Cytosar, or may be prepared for example as described in U.S. patent specification No. 3116282, or by processes analogous thereto. Fludarabine is commercially available for example from Schering AG under the trade name Fludara, or may be prepared for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,357,324, or by processes analogous thereto.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRalitrexed is commercially available for example from AstraZeneca plc under the trade name Tomudex, or may be prepared for example as described in European patent specification No. 239632, or by processes analogous thereto. Pemetrexed is commercially available for example from Eli Lilly and Company under the trade name Alimta, or may be prepared for example as described in European patent specification No. 432677, or by processes analogous thereto. Methotrexate is commercially available for example from Lederle Laboraories under the trade name Methotrexate-Lederle, or may be prepared for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 2,512,572, or by processes analogous thereto. Other antimetabolites for use in the combinations of the invention include 6-mercaptopurine, 6-thioguanine, cladribine, 2′-deoxycoformycin and hydroxyurea.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecific embodiments: In one embodiment, the antimetabolic compound is gemcitabine. In another embodiment, the antimetabolic compound is a antimetabolic compound other than 5-fluorouracil or fludarabine, for example an antimetabolic compound such as gemcitabine, capecitabine, cytarabine, ralitrexed, pemetrexed or methotrexate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPosology: The antimetabolite compound will be administered in a dosage that will depend on the factors noted above. Examples of dosages for particular preferred antimetabolites are given below by way of example. With regard to anti-tumour nucleosides, these are advantageously administered in a daily dosage of 10 to 2500 mg per square meter (mg/m2) of body surface area, for example 700 to 1500 mg/m\n2\n, particularly for 5-FU in a dosage of 200 to 500 mg/m\n2\n, for gemcitabine in a dosage of 800 to 1200 mg/m\n2\n, for capecitabine in a dosage of 1000 to 1200 mg/m\n2\n, for cytarabine in a dosage of 100-200 mg/m\n2 \nand for fludarabine in a dosage of 10 to 50 mg/m\n2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the following enzyme inhibitors, examples are given of possible doses. Thus, raltitrexed can be administered in a dosage of about 3 mg/m\n2\n, pemetrexed in a dosage of 500 mg/m\n2 \nand methotrexate in a dosage of 30-40 mg/m\n2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dosages noted above may generally be administered for example once, twice or more per course of treatment, which may be repeated for example every 7, 14, 21 or 28 days.\n\n\n \n7\n. Vinca \nAlkaloids\n\n\n \n \n \nDefinition: The term “\nvinca \nalkaloid” as used herein refers to \nvinca \nalkaloid compounds or analogues of \nvinca \nalkaloid compounds as described herein, including the ionic, salt, solvate, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, ester, prodrugs, isotopes and protected forms thereof (preferably the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof, and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof), as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTechnical background: The \nvinca \nalkaloids for use in the combinations of the invention are anti-tumour \nvinca \nalkaloids related to or derived from extracts of the periwinkle plant (\nVinca rosea\n). Among these compounds, vinblastine and vincristine are important clinical agents for the treatment of leukaemias, lymphomas and testicular cancer, and vinorelbine has activity against lung cancer and breast cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBiological activity: The \nvinca \nalkaloid compounds of the combinations of the invention are tubulin targeting agents and have activity against various cancers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProblems: Treatment with \nVinca \nalkaloids is accompanied by significant toxicities. For example, vinblastine causes leukopenia which reaches a nadir in 7 to 10 days following drug administration, after which recovery ensues within 7 days, while vincristine demonstrates some neurological toxicity for example numbness and trembling of the extremities, loss of deep tendon reflexes and weakness of distal limb musculature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVinorelbine has some toxicity in the form of granulocytopenia but with only modest thrombocytopenia and less neurotoxicity than other \nvinca \nalkaloids. There is therefore a need to increase the inhibitory efficacy of anti-tumour \nvinca \nalkaloids against tumour growth and also to provide a means for the use of lower dosages of anti-tumour \nvinca \nalkaloids to reduce the potential of adverse toxic side effects to the patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferences: Preferred anti-tumour \nvinca \nalkaloids for use in accordance with the invention include vindesine, vinvesir, vinblastine, vincristine and vinorelbine. Particularly preferred anti-tumour \nvinca \nalkaloids for use in accordance with the invention include vinblastine, vincristine and vinorelbine referred to above. Vinblastine is commercially available for example as the sulphate salt for injection from Eli Lilly and Co under the trade name Velban, and may be prepared for example as described in German patent specification No. 2124023 or by processes analogous thereto. Vincristine is commercially available for example as the sulphate salt for injection from Eli Lilly and Co under the trade name Oncovin and may be prepared for example as described in the above German patent specification No. 2124023 or by processes analogous thereto. Vincristine is also available as a liposomal formulation under the name Onco-TCS™. Vinorelbine is commercially available for example as the tartrate salt for injection from Glaxo Wellcome under the trade name Navelbine and may be prepared for example as described in U.S. patent specification No. 4307100, or by processes analogous thereto. Other anti-tumour \nvinca \nalkaloids may be prepared in conventional manner for example by processes analogous to those described above for vinoblastine, vincristine and vinorelbine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother preferred \nvinca \nalkaloid is vindesine. Vindesine is a synthetic derivative of the dimeric catharanthus alkaloid vinblastine, is available from Lilly under the tradename Eldisine and from Shionogi under the tradename Fildesin. Details of the synthesis of Vindesine are described in Lilly patent DE2415980 (1974) and by C. J. Burnett et al., J. Med. Chem. 21, 88 (1978).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecific embodiments: In one embodiment, the \nvinca \nalkaloid compound is selected from vinoblastine, vincristine and vinorelbine. In another embodiment, the \nvinca \nalkaloid compound is vinoblastine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPosology: The anti-tumour \nvinca \nalkaloid is advantageously administered in a dosage of 2 to 30 mg per square meter (mg/m\n2\n) of body surface area, particularly for vinblastine in a dosage of about 3 to 12 mg/m\n2\n, for vincristine in a dosage of about 1 to 2 mg/m\n2\n, and for vinorelbine in dosage of about 10 to 30 mg/m\n2 \nper course of treatment. These dosages may be administered for example once, twice or more per course of treatment, which may be repeated for example every 1, 14, 21 or 28 days.\n\n\n \n8. Taxanes (Taxoids)\n\n\n \n \n \nDefinition: The term “taxane compound” as used herein refers to taxane compounds or analogues of taxane compounds as described herein, including the ionic, salt, solvate, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, ester, prodrugs, isotopes and protected forms thereof (preferably the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof, and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof), as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTechnical background: The taxanes are a class of compounds having the taxane ring system and related to or derived from extracts from certain species of yew (\nTaxus\n) trees. These compounds have been found to have activity against tumour cell growth and certain compounds in this class have been used in the clinic for the treatment of various cancers. Thus, for example, paclitaxel is a diterpene isolated from the bark of the yew tree, \nTaxus brevifolia\n, and can be produced by partial synthesis from 10-acetylbacctin, a precursor obtained from yew needles and twigs or by total synthesis, see Holton et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 116; 1597-1601 (1994) and Nicholau et al, Nature 367:630 (1994). Paclitaxel has shown anti-neoplastic activity and more recently it has been established that its antitumour activity is due to the promotion of microtubule polymerisation, Kumar N. J., Biol. Chem. 256: 1035-1041 (1981); Rowinsky et al, J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 82: 1247-1259 (1990); and Schiff et al, Nature 277: 655-667 (1979). Paclitaxel has now demonstrated efficacy in several human tumours in clinical trials, McGuire et al, Ann. Int. Med., 111:273-279 (1989); Holmes et al, J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 83: 1797-1805 (1991); Kohn et al, J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 86: 18-24 (1994); and Kohn et al, American Society for Clinical Oncology, 12 (1993). Paclitaxel is used for the treatment of ovarian, breast and lung cancer, in particular has for example been used for the treatment of ovarian cancer and also breast cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore recently a nanomolar formulation of paclitaxel complexed with albumin has been shown to be at least as efficacious and less myelosuppressive than paclitaxel alone. (APP; Abraxane). Paclitaxel m conjugates with glutamic acid are also in development.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother taxane compound which has been used in the clinic is docetaxel which has been shown to have particular efficacy in the treatment of advanced breast cancer. Docetaxel has shown a better solubility in excipient systems than paclitaxel, therefore increasing the ease with which it can be handled and used in pharmaceutical compositions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBiological activity: The taxane compounds of the combinations of the invention are tubulin targeting agents and have activity against various cancers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProblems: Clinical use of taxanes has demonstrated a narrow therapeutic index with many patients unable to tolerate the side effects associated with its use. There is therefore a need to increase the inhibitory efficacy of taxane compounds against tumour growth and also to provide a means for the use of lower dosages of taxane compounds to reduce the potential of adverse toxic side effects to the patient. The development of taxanes with increased solubility in aqueous solutions would also be desirable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferences: Preferred taxane compounds for use in accordance with the invention include paclitaxel Abraxane or docetaxel referred to herein. Paclitaxel is available commercially for example under the trade name Taxol from Bristol Myers Squibb and docetaxel is available commercially under the trade name Taxotere from Sanofi-Aventis (previously Rhone-Poulenc Rorer). Both compounds and other taxane compounds may be prepared in conventional manner for example as described in EP 253738, EP 253739 and WO 92/09589 or by processes analogous thereto.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecific embodiments: In one embodiment, the taxane compound is paclitaxel. In another embodiment, the taxane compound is docetaxel.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPosology: The taxane compound is advantageously administered in a dosage of 50 to 400 mg per square metere (mg/m\n2\n) of body surface area, for example 75 to 250 mg/m\n2\n, particularly for paclitaxel in a dosage of about 175 to 250 mg/m\n2 \nand for docetaxel in about 75 to 150 mg/m\n2 \nper course of treatment. These dosages may be administered for example once, twice or more per course of treatment, which may be repeated for example every 7, 14, 21 or 28 days.\n\n\n \n9. Epothilones\n\n\n \n \n \nDefinition: As used herein, the term “epothilone” is used to define a class of cytotoxic macrolides with a similar mechanism of action to paclitaxel but with the potential advantage of activity in taxane-resistant settings in preclinical models. The epothilones ixabepilone, patupilone, BMS-310705, KOS-862 and ZK-EPO are in early clinical trials for cancer treatment. Phase I studies have shown that dose-limiting toxicities of epothilones are generally neurotoxicity and neutropenia although initial studies with patupilone indicated that diarrhoea was dose limiting. Neuropathy induced by ixabepilone may be schedule dependent. Response rates in taxane-refractory metastatic breast cancer are relatively modest, but ixabepilone and patupilone have shown promising efficacy in hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer and in taxane-refractory ovarian cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTechnical Background; Epothilones A and B were originally isolated as anti-fungal fermentation products of the myxobacteria Sorangium cellulosum. Shortly thereafter these agents were demonstrated to stabilize microtubules and induce mitotic arrest. Though their cytotoxic activity relies on the same mechanism as that of the taxanes, the epothilones have a couple of key advantages. Firstly they are not substrates for the multi-drug resistance pump P-gylycoprotein. Secondly they are easier both to produce (because of their bacterial origin) and to manipulate. Chemical syntheses, either total or partial, of these molecules and their analogs allows for modification to enhance their efficacy Mani et al. Anticancer Drugs 2004; 15(6):553-8). Several epothilones or epothilone-derivatives have been shown effective against cell lines and tumor xenografts and are now in clinical trials (Goodin et al. J Clin Oncol 2004; 22(10): 2015-25). An unexpected source for the identification of microtubule stabilizing agents has been marine organisms. Laulimalide and isolaulimalide are natural products of the marine sponge \nCacospongia mycofijiensis \nwith strong paclitaxel-like activity, even against P-gp expressing cell lines. Eluetherobin, similar in both respects, is a product of the \nEleutherobia \nspecies of soft coral.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBiological Activity; Formation of microtubules involves polymerization of heterodimeric α/β-tubulin subunits with multiple isoforms of both α- and β-tubulin present in human cells. Intact microtubule function is required for formation and functioning of the mitotic spindle, and cells treated with agents that bind either tubulin subunits or polymerized microtubules exhibit alterations in spindle formation, as well as arrest at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, which is associated with induction of apoptosis. Compounds that target microtubules are potent cytotoxic agents, exemplified by the convergent evolution of microtubule-targeting compounds by a variety of plant and marine species. Published studies of three epothilones in current clinical development, epothilone B, aza-epothilone B, and desoxyepothilone B, indicate that these compounds exhibit broad spectrum antitumor activity in cell culture models and in xenografts. Furthermore, epothilones are generally more cytotoxic than paclitaxel in cell culture studies, with IC\n50 \nvalues in the sub- or low nanomolar range in a variety of tumor cell lines (Bollag et al., Cancer Res 55:2325-2333, 1995; Lee et al. Clin Cancer Res 7:1429-1437, 2001; Chou et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 95:9642-9647, 1998; Newman et al. Cancer Chemother Pharmacol 48:319-326, 2001). Preclinical studies also demonstrated important differences with regard to drug resistance mechanisms between epothilones and taxanes. In particular, overexpression of P-glycoprotein minimally affects the cytotoxicity of epothilone B, aza-epothilone B, and desoxyepothilones in cell culture models. Comparison of the cytotoxic effects of epothilone B, aza-epothilone B, and desoxyepothilone B among P-glycoprotein-overexpressing cell lines suggests that desoxyepothilone B is least affected, whereas aza-epothilone B is most affected by P-glycoprotein expression. However, it should be noted that differences among the IC\n50\ns of these compounds in P-glycoprotein-overexpressing cell lines are small compared with the differences between these values and IC\n50\ns for paclitaxel in these cell lines. Although the significance of P-glycoprotein expression in clinical resistance to taxanes remains uncertain, these results suggest that epothilones may be more active than taxanes in patients with malignancies characterized by high levels of P-glycoprotein expression. In vivo studies indicate that epothilones are active in paclitaxel-sensitive and -resistant tumor models using a variety of schedules. When administered intravenously to mice using intermittent daily or weekly schedules, aza-epothilone B is highly active in ovarian, colon, and breast xenografts and induces cures in an ovarian xenograft model (Pat-7) that is resistant to paclitaxel. Notably, unlike paclitaxel, aza-epothilone B is effective when administered orally in preclinical models. This phenomenon likely relates to the expression of P-glycoprotein in intestinal mucosa, resulting in poor absorption of paclitaxel but not epothilones.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProblems; Sensory neuropathy and myelosuppression has been documented with epothilones\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferences; Existing structure-activity data provide some insight into the interaction between epothilones and microtubules. Results from several groups indicate that modifications at or near the C12-13 epoxide can affect microtubule-stabilizing activity (Wartmann and Altmann, Curr Med Chem Anti-Canc Agents 2:123-148, 2002). For example, addition of a methyl group to epothilone A at position C12 yields epothilone B, which is approximately twice as potent as epothilone A or paclitaxel in inducing tubulin polymerization in vitro (Kowalski et al., J Biol Chem 272: 2534-2541, 1997; Nicolaou et al. Nature 387:268-272, 1997, abstr 428). In addition, it is clear that an epoxide at C12-13 is not required for microtubule-binding, because desoxyepothilone B (also known as epothilone D or KOS-862) lacks the C12-13 epoxide and is a more potent microtubule stabilizer in vitro than epothilone A or B. Less data are available regarding the effects of modifying other regions of epothilone. Despite attempts to improve microtubule binding by altering the C9-C12 region (on the basis of molecular modeling), alterations in this area resulted in loss of cytotoxic activity. By contrast, replacement of the lactone oxygen of epothilone B with a lactam (aza-epothilone B, also known as BMS-247550) does not impair microtubule-polymerizing activity or cytotoxicity. Although a variety of other epothilone analogs have been synthesized, it should be noted that increasing microtubule-stabilizing activity does not always result in increased cytotoxicity, presumably because of the importance of other variables such as cellular accumulation and metabolic stability (Wartmann and Altmann, Curr Med Chem Anti-Canc Agents 2:123-148, 2002). Indeed, replacement of the methyl group at C12 position of desoxyepothilone B with a propanol group results in a compound that is as effective as desoxyepothilone B against the leukemic cell line CCRF-CEM but is significantly less active against a P-glycoprotein-overexpressing subline (IC\n50 \nof 17 nmol/L for desoxyepothilone B v 167 mmol/L for the propanol derivative) (Chou et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 95:9642-9647, 1998). Additional modifications of naturally occurring epothilones have been made in an effort to improve solubility, such as BMS-310705, which is a C-21-substituted derivative of epothilone B (Lee et al., Proc Am Assoc Cancer Res 43:a3928, 2002).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecific embodiments: In one embodiment, the epothilone compound is BMS-247550. In another embodiment, the epothilone compound is Desoxyeopthilone and in another embodiment the epothilone compound is BMS-310705\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPosology: BMS-247550 is dosed either 40 mg/m\n2 \nover 3 hours every 21 days or 6 mg/m\n2 \nadministered over 1 hour \ndaily times\n 5 days every 3 weeks. Because of the frequency of mucositis and neutropenia in the first 18 patients on the single-dose every-3-week schedule, the dose was reduced to 32 mg/m\n2\n. EP0906 is dosed either at 2.5 mg/m\n2 \nweekly for 3 weeks followed by 1 week of rest in one trial, and 6 mg/m\n2 \nonce every 3 weeks. KOS-862 is scheduled at either a single dose every 3 weeks, a daily dose times 3 every 3 weeks, a fixed rate dose every 3 weeks, and a weekly dose for 3 weeks with 1 week rest.\n\n\n \n10. Platinum Compounds\n\n\n \n \n \nDefinition: The term “platinum compounds” as used herein refers to any tumour cell growth inhibiting platinum compound including platinum coordination compounds, compounds which provide platinum in the form of an ion and analogues of platinum compounds as described herein, including the ionic, salt, solvate, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, ester, prodrugs, isotopes and protected forms thereof (preferably the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof, and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof), as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTechnical background: In the chemotherapeutic treatment of cancers, cisplatin (cis-diaminodichloroplatinum (II)) has been used successfully for many years in the treatment of various human solid malignant tumours for example testicular cancer, ovarian cancer and cancers of the head and neck, bladder, oesophagus and lung.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore recently, other diamino-platinum complexes, for example carboplatin (diamino(1,1-cyclobutane-dicarboxylato)platinum (II)), have also shown efficacy as chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of various human solid malignant tumours, carboplatin being approved for the treatment of ovarian and small cell lung cancer in particular in the treatment of ovarian cancer. A further antitumour platinum compound is oxaliplatin (L-OHP), a third generation diamino-cyclohexane platinum-based cytotoxic drug, which has the chemical name (1,2-diaminocyclohexane)oxalato-platinum (II). Oxaliplatin is used, for example, for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, based on its lack of renal toxicity and higher efficacy in preclinical models of cancer in comparison to cisplatin. Oxaliplatin is used in combination with 5-FU, for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer and is under investigation in the treatment of upper gastrointestinal cancer. An oral platinum derivative is under investigation for the treatment of prostate cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBiological activity: The platinum compounds of the combinations of the invention have activity against various cancers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProblems: Although cisplatin and other platinum compounds have been widely used as chemotherapeutic agents in humans, they are not therapeutically effective in all patients or against all types of tumours. Moreover, such compounds need to be administered at relatively high dosage levels which can lead to toxicity problems such as kidney damage, myelosuppression and neuropathy. Also, and especially with cisplatin, the compounds cause nausea and vomiting in patients to a varying extent, as well as leucopenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia. There is therefore a need to increase efficacy and also to provide a means for the use of lower dosages to reduce the potential of adverse toxic side effects to the patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferences: Preferred platinum compounds for use in accordance with the invention include cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin. Other platinum compounds include chloro(diethylenediamino)-platinum (II) chloride; dichloro(ethylenediamino)-platinum (II); spiroplatin; iproplatin; diamino(2-ethylmalonato)platinum (II); (1,2-diaminocyclohexane)malonatoplatinum (II); (4-carboxyphthalo)-(1,2-diaminocyclohexane)platinum (II); (1,2-diaminocyclohexane)-(isocitrato)platinum (II); (1,2-diaminocyclohexane)-cis-(pyruvato)platinum (II); onnaplatin; and tetraplatin. Cisplatin is commercially available for example under the trade name Platinol from Bristol-Myers Squibb Corporation as a powder for constitution with water, sterile saline or other suitable vehicle. Cisplatin may also be prepared for example as described by G. B. Kauffman and D. O. Cowan, Inorg. Synth. 7, 239 (1963), or by processes analogous thereto. Carboplatin is commercially available for example from Bristol-Myers Squibb Corporation under the trade name Paraplatin, or may be prepared for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,140,707, or by processes analogous thereto. Oxaliplatin is commercially available for example from Sanofi-Synthelabo Inc under the trade name Eloxatin, or may be prepared for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,169,846, or by processes analogous thereto. Other platinum compounds and their pharmaceutical compositions are commercially available and/or can be prepared by conventional techniques.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecific embodiments: In one embodiment, the platinum compound is selected from chloro(diethylenediamino)-platinum (II) chloride; dichloro(ethylenediamino)-platinum (II); spiroplatin; iproplatin; diamino(2-ethylmalonato)platinum (II); (1,2-diaminocyclohexane)malonatoplatinum (II); (4-carboxyphthalo)-(1,2-diaminocyclohexane)platinum (II); (1,2-diaminocyclohexane)-(isocitrato)platinum (II); (1,2-diaminocyclohexane)-cis-(pyruvato)platinum (II); onnaplatin; tetraplatin, cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin. In another embodiment, the platinum compound is a platinum compound other than cisplatin, for example a platinum compound such as chloro(diethylenediamino)-platinum (II) chloride; dichloro(ethylenediamino)-platinum (II); spiroplatin; iproplatin; diamino(2-ethylmalonato)platinum (II); (1,2-diaminocyclohexane)malonatoplatinum (II); (4-carboxyphthalo)-(1,2-diaminocyclohexane)platinum (II); (1,2-diaminocyclohexane)-(isocitrato)platinum (II); (1,2-diaminocyclohexane)-cis-(pyruvato)platinum (II); onnaplatin; tetraplatin, carboplatin or oxaliplatin, preferably selected from carboplatin and oxaliplatin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPosology: The platinum coordination compound is advantageously administered in a dosage of 1 to 500 mg per square meter (mg/m\n2\n) of body surface area, for example 50 to 400 mg/m\n2 \nor 500 mg/m\n2 \n(e.g. 50 to 400 mg/m\n2\n) particularly for cisplatin in a dosage of about 75 mg/m\n2\n, for carboplatin in about 300-500 mg/m\n2 \ne.g. 300 mg/m\n2\n, and for oxaliplatin in about 50-100 mg/m\n2\n. These dosages may be administered for example once, twice or more per course of treatment, which may be repeated for example every 7, 14, 21 or 28 days.\n\n\n \n11. \nTopoisomerase\n 2 Inhibitors\n\n\n \n \n \nDefinition: The term “\ntopoisomerase\n 2 inhibitor” as used herein refers to \ntopoisomerase\n 2 inhibitor or analogues of \ntopoisomerase\n 2 inhibitor as described above, including the ionic, salt, solvate, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, ester, prodrugs, isotopes and protected forms thereof (preferably the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof, and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof), as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTechnical background: An important class of anticancer drugs are the inhibitors of the \nenzyme topoisomerase\n 2 which causes double-strand breaks to release stress build-up during DNA transcription and translation. Compounds that inhibit the function of this enzyme are therefore cytotoxic and useful as anti-cancer agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmong the \ntopoisomerase\n 2 inhibitors which have been developed and used in cancer chemotherapy are the podophyllotoxins. These drugs act by a mechanism of action which involves the induction of DNA strand breaks by an interaction with \nDNA topoisomerase\n 2 or the formation of free radicals. Podophyllotoxin, which is extracted from the mandrake plant, is the parent compound from which two glycosides have been developed which show significant therapeutic activity in several human neoplasms, including pediatric leukemia, small cell carcinomas of the lung, testicular tumours, Hodgkin's disease, and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Podophyllotoxin has activity in pediatric leukemia, small cell carcinomas of the lung, testicular tumours, Hodgkin's, disease, and large cell lymphomas. These derivatives are etoposide (VP-16), which has the chemical name 4′-demethylepipodophyllotoxin 9-[4,6-O—(R)-ethylidene-β-D-glucopyranoside], and teniposide (VM-26), which has the chemical name 4′-demethylepipodophyllotoxin 9-[4,6-O—(R)-2-thenylidene-β-D-glucopyranoside].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBoth etoposide and teniposide, however, suffer from certain toxic side-effects especially myelosuppression. Another important class of \ntopoisomerase\n 2 inhibitors are the anthracycline derivatives which are important anti-tumour agents and comprise antibiotics obtained from the fungus \nStreptomyces peuticus \nvar. \ncaesius \nand their derivatives, characterized by having a tetracycline ring structure with an unusual sugar, daunosamine, attached by a glycosidic linkage. Among these compounds, the most widely used include daunorubicin, which has the chemical name 7-(3-amino-2,3,6-trideoxy-L-lyxohexosyloxy)-9-acetyl-7,8,9,10-tetrahydro-6,9,11-trihydroxy-4-methoxy-5,12-naphthacenequinone, doxorubicin, which has the chemical name 10-[(3-amino-2,3,6-trideoxy-α-L-lyxohexopyranosyl)oxy]-7,8,9,10-tetrahydro-6,8,11-trihydroxy-8-(hydroxylacetyl)-1-methoxy-5,12-naphthacenedione, and idarubicin (Zavedos™), which has the chemical name 9-acetyl-[(3-amino-2,3,6-trideoxy-α-L-lyxohexopyranosyl)oxy]-7,8,9,10-tetrahydro-6,9,11-trihydroxy-5,12-naphthacenedione.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDaunorubicin and idarubicin have been used primarily for the treatment of acute leukaemias whereas doxorubicin has been more widely tested against solid tumours particularly breast cancer. Another anthracycline derivative which is useful in cancer chemotherapy is epirubicin. Epirubicin, which has the chemical name (8S-cis)-10-[(3-amino-2,3,6-trideoxy-α-L-arabino-hexopyranosyl)oxy]-7,8,9,10-tetrahydro-6,8,11-trihydroxy-8-(hydroxyacetyl)-1-methoxy-5,12-naphthacenedione, is a doxorubicin analog having a catabolic pathway that involves glucuronidation, by uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyl transferase in the liver (unlike that for doxorubicin), which is believed to account for its shorter half-life and reduced cardiotoxicity. The compound has been used for the treatment of various cancers including cervical cancer, endometrial cancer, advanced breast cancer and carcinoma of the bladder but suffers from the side-effects of myelosuppression and cardiotoxicity. The latter side-effect is typical of anthracycline derivatives which generally display a serious cardiomyopathy at higher cumulative doses. A further type of \ntopoisomerase\n 2 inhibitor is represented by mitoxantrone, which has the \nchemical name\n 1,4-dihydroxy-5,8-bis[[2-[(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]ethyl]amino]-9,10-anthracenedione, and is used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, acute myelogenous leukaemia, and breast, prostate and liver tumours. Others include losoxantrone and actinomycin D (the latter agent also known as Dactinomycin and Cosmegen Lyovac®).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSide-effects from administration of mitoxantrone include myelosuppression, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis and alopecia\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBiological activity: The \ntopoisomerase\n 2 inhibitors of the combinations of the invention have activity against various cancers as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProblems: This class of cytotoxic compound is associated with side effects, as mentioned above. Thus, there is a need to provide a means for the use of lower dosages to reduce the potential of adverse toxic side effects to the patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferences: \nPreferred topoisomerase\n 2 inhibitor compounds for use in accordance with the invention include anthracycline derivatives, mitoxantrone and podophyllotoxin derivatives as defined to herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred anti-tumour anthracycline derivatives for use in accordance with the invention include daunorubicin, doxorubicin, idarubicin and epirubicin referred to above. Daunorubicin is commercially available for example as the hydrochloride salt from Bedford Laboratories under the trade name Cerubidine, or may be prepared for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,020,270, or by processes analogous thereto. The therapeutic index of daunorubicin in acute myeloid leukemia may be improved by encapsulating the molecule in a liposome (Daunoxome; Gilead/Diatos). Doxorubicin is commercially available for example from Pharmacia and Upjohn Co under the trade name Adriamycin, or may be prepared for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,803,124, or by processes analogous thereto. Doxorubicin derivatives include pegylated doxorubicin hydrochloride and liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin citrate. Pegylated doxorubicin hydrochloride is commercially available from Schering-Plough Pharmaceuticals under the trade name Caeylx; non-pegylated liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin citrate is commercially available for example from Cephalon Europe under the trade name Myocet. Idarubicin is commercially available for example as the hydrochloride salt from Pharmacia & Upjohn under the trade name Idamycin, or may be prepared for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,046,878, or by processes analogous thereto. Epirubicin is commercially available for example from Pharmacia and Upjohn Co under the trade name Pharmorubicin, or may be prepared for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,058,519, or by processes analogous thereto. Mitoxantrone is commercially available for example from OSI Pharmaceuticals, under the trade name Novantrone, or may be prepared for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,197,249, or by processes analogous thereto.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther anti-tumour anthracycline derivatives may be prepared in conventional manner for example by processes analogous to those described above for the specific anthracycline derivatives.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred anti-tumour podophyllotoxin derivatives for use in accordance with the invention include etoposide and teniposide referred to above. Etoposide is commercially available for example from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co under the trade name VePesid, or may be prepared for example as described in European patent specification No. 111058, or by processes analogous thereto. Teniposide is commercially available for example from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co under the trade name Vumon, or may be prepared for example as described in PCT patent specification No. WO 93/02094, or by processes analogous thereto. Other anti-tumour podophyllotoxin derivatives may be prepared in conventional manner for example by processes analogous to those described above for etoposide and teniposide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecific embodiments: In one embodiment, the \ntopoisomerase\n 2 inhibitor is an anthracycline derivative, mitoxantrone or a podophyllotoxin derivative. In another embodiment, the \ntopoisomerase\n 2 inhibitor is selected from daunorubicin, doxorubicin, idarubicin and epirubicin. In a further embodiment, the \ntopoisomerase\n 2 inhibitor is selected from etoposide and teniposide. Thus, in a preferred embodiment, the \ntopoisomerase\n 2 inhibitor is etoposide. In another embodiment, the \ntopoisomerase\n 2 inhibitor is an anthracycline derivative other than doxorubicin, for example a \ntopoisomerase\n 2 inhibitor such as daunorubicin, idarubicin and epirubicin.\n\n\n \n \nPosology: The anti-tumour anthracycline derivative is advantageously administered in a dosage of 10 to 150 mg per square meter (mg/m\n2\n) of body surface area, for example 15 to 60 mg/m\n2\n, particularly for doxorubicin in a dosage of about 40 to 75 mg/m\n2\n, for daunorubicin in a dosage of about 25 to 45 mg/m\n2\n, for idarubicin in a dosage of about 10 to 15 mg/m\n2 \nand for epirubicin in a dosage of about 100-120 mg/m\n2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMitoxantrone is advantageously administered in a dosage of about 12 to 14 mg/m\n2 \nas a short intravenous infusion about every 21 days.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-tumour podophyllotoxin derivative is advantageously administered in a dosage of 30 to 300 mg/m\n2 \nof body surface area, for example 50 to 250 mg/m particularly for etoposide in a dosage of about 35 to 100 mg/m, and for teniposide in about 50 to 250 mg/m\n2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dosages noted above may generally be administered for example once, twice or more per course of treatment, which may be repeated for example every 7, 14, 21 or 28 days.\n\n\n \n12. Alkylating Agents\n\n\n \n \n \nDefinition: The term “alkylating agent” or “alkylating agents” as used herein refers to alkylating agents or analogues of alkylating agents as described herein, including the ionic, salt, solvate, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, ester, prodrugs, isotopes and protected forms thereof (preferably the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof, and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof), as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTechnical background: Alkylating agents used in cancer chemotherapy encompass a diverse group of chemicals that have the common feature that they have the capacity to contribute, under physiological conditions, alkyl groups to biologically vital macromolecules such as DNA. With most of the more important agents such as the nitrogen mustards and the nitrosoureas, the active alkylating moieties are generated in vivo after complex degradative reactions, some of which are enzymatic. The most important pharmacological actions of the alkylating agents are those that disturb the fundamental mechanisms concerned with cell proliferation, in particular DNA synthesis and cell division. The capacity of alkylating agents to interfere with DNA function and integrity in rapidly proliferating tissues provides the basis for their therapeutic applications and for many of their toxic properties. Alkylating agents as a class have therefore been investigated for their anti-tumour activity and certain of these compounds have been widely used in anti-cancer therapy although they tend to have in common a propensity to cause dose-limiting toxicity to bone marrow elements and to a lesser extent the intestinal mucosa.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmong the alkylating agents, the nitrogen mustards represent an important group of anti-tumour compounds which are characterised by the presence of a bis-(2-chloroethyl) grouping and include cyclophosphamide, which has the chemical name 2-[bis(2-chloroethyl)amino]tetrahydro-2H-1,3,2-oxazaphospholine oxide, and chlorambucil, which has the chemical name 4-[bis(2-chloroethyl)amino]-benzenebutoic acid. Cyclophosphamide has a broad spectrum of clinical activity and is used as a component of many effective drug combinations for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, Burkitt's lymphoma and breast cancer. Cyclophosphamide has also been used as a component of combinations for malignant lymphomas.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIfosfamide (a.k.a. ifosphamide) is a structural analogue of cyclophosphamide and its mechanism of action is presumed to be identical. It has the chemical name 3-(2-chloroethyl)-2-[(2-chloroethyl)amino]tetrahydro-2H-1,3,2-oxazaphosphorin-2-oxide, and is used for the treatment of cervical cancer, sarcoma, and testicular cancer but may have severe urotoxic effects. Chlorambucil has been used for treating chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Chlorambucil has also been used for treating CLL and malignant lymphomas including lymphosarcoma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother important class of alkylating agents are the nitrosoureas which are characterised by the capacity to undergo spontaneous non-enzymatic degradation with the formation of the 2-chloroethyl carbonium ion. Examples of such nitrosourea compounds include carmustine (BiCNU® or BCNU) which has the \nchemical name\n 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea, and lomustine (CCNU) which has the chemical name 1-(2-chloroethyl)cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea. Carmustine and lomustine each have an important therapeutic role in the treatment of brain tumours and gastrointestinal neoplasms although these compounds cause profound, cumulative myelosuppression that restricts their therapeutic value.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother class of alkylating agent is represented by the bifunctional alkylating agents having a bis-alkanesulfonate group and represented by the compound busulfan which has the \nchemical name\n 1,4-butanediol dimethanesulfonate, and is used for the treatment of chronic myelogenous (myeloid, myelocytic or granulocytic) leukaemia. However, it can induce severe bone marrow failure resulting in severe pancytopenia. This property has led to its widespread usage as a conditioning agent prior to hematological stem cell transplantation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother class of alkylating agent are the aziridine compounds containing a three-membered nitrogen-containing ring which act as anti-tumour agents by binding to DNA, leading to cross-linking and inhibition of DNA synthesis and function. An example of such an agent is mitomycin, an antibiotic isolated from \nStreptomyces caespitosus\n, and having the chemical name 7-amino-9α-methoxymitosane.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMitomycin is used to treat adenocarcinoma of stomach, pancreas, colon and breast, small cell and non-small cell lung cancer, and, in combination with radiation, head and neck cancer, side-effects including myelosuppression, nephrotoxicity, interstitial pneumonitis, nausea and vomiting.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBiological activity: One of the most important pharmacological actions of the alkylating agent in combination with the invention is its ability to disturb the fundamental mechanisms concerned with cell proliferation as herein before defined.

Signalling Inhibitors for Use According to the Invention\n\n\n \n \n \nDefinition: The term “signalling inhibitor” (or “signal transduction inhibitor”) as used herein refers to signalling inhibitors or analogues of signalling inhibitors as described herein, including the ionic, salt, solvate, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, ester, prodrugs, isotopes and protected forms thereof (preferably the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof, and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof), as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTechnical background: A malignant tumour is the product of uncontrolled cell proliferation. Cell growth is controlled by a delicate balance between growth-promoting and growth-inhibiting factors. In normal tissue the production and activity of these factors results in differentiated cells growing in a controlled and regulated manner that maintains the normal integrity and functioning of the organ. The malignant cell has evaded this control; the natural balance is disturbed (via a variety of mechanisms) and unregulated, aberrant cell growth occurs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne driver for growth is the epidermal growth factor (EGF), and the receptor for EGF (EGFR) has been implicated in the development and progression of a number of human solid tumours including those of the lung, breast, prostate, colon, ovary, head and neck. EGFR is a member of a family of four receptors, namely EGFR (HER1 or ErbB1), ErbB2 (HER2/neu), ErbB3 (HER3), and ErbB4 (HER4). These receptors are large proteins that reside in the cell membrane, each having a specific external ligand binding domain, a transmembrane domain and an internal domain which has tyrosine kinase enzyme activity. When EGF attaches to EGFR, it activates the tyrosine kinase, triggering reactions that cause the cells to grow and multiply. EGFR is found at abnormally high levels on the surface of many types of cancer cells, which may divide excessively in the presence of EGF. Inhibition of EGFR activity has therefore been a target for chemotherapeutic research in the treatment of cancer. Such inhibition can be effected by direct interference with the target EGFR on the cell surface, for example by the use of antibodies, or by inhibiting the subsequent tyrosine kinase activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of antibodies which target EGFR are the monoclonal antibodies trastuzumab and cetuximab. Amplification of the human epidermal \ngrowth factor receptor\n 2 protein (HER 2) in primary breast carcinomas has been shown to correlate with a poor clinical prognosis for certain patients. Trastuzumab is a highly purified recombinant DNA-derived humanized monoclonal IgG1 kappa antibody that binds with high affinity and specificity to the extracellular domain of the HER2 receptor. In vitro and in vivo preclinical studies have shown that administration of trastuzumab alone or in combination with paclitaxel or carboplatin significantly inhibits the growth of breast tumour-derived cell lines that over-express the HER2 gene product. In clinical studies trastuzumab has been shown to have clinical activity in the treatment of breast cancer. The most common adverse effects of trastuzumab are fever and chills, pain, asthenia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, dyspnea, rhinitis, and insomnia. Particularly troublesome is the onset of cardiomyopathy which may be reversible in the majority of patients. Trastuzumab has been approved for the treatment of early and metastatic breast cancer, in particular metastic breast cancer, exhibiting over-expression of the HER2 protein\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCetuximab has been used for the treatment of irotecan-refractory colorectal cancer (CRC) and in combination with radiotherapy in the treatment of head and neck cancer. It is also being evaluated both as a single agent and in combination with other agents for use in the treatment of a variety of other cancers including metastatic pancreatic carcinoma, and non-small-cell lung cancer. The administration of cetuximab can cause serious side effects, which may include difficulty in breathing and low blood pressure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother suitable monoclonal antibody for use in the combinations of the invention is panitumumab. Amgen Inc (formerly Immunex and Abgenix Inc) is developing panitumumab (ABX-EGF), a fully human monoclonal antibody against the EGF receptor, for the potential treatment of cancer, such as monotherapy for renal cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer, and CRC in combination with standard chemotherapy as first-line treatment, as third-line monotherapy in advanced CRC, in particular to treat metastatic colorectal cancer (MCC) and in patients who failed standard chemotherapy. Thus ABX-EGF can be administered as a monotherapy or in association with chemotherapy and radiotherapy in order to complement independent approaches for the treatment of cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nABX-EGF is a fully humanized IgG2 monoclonal antibody against the human EGFR. Fully humanized monoclonal antibodies such as ABX-EGF have several advantages over chimeric antibodies, which contain significant amounts of mouse protein. They do not generate human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA); the risk of inducing hypersensitivity reactions in patients is therefore reduced and the antibodies should demonstrate an increased in vivo lifetime. Such considerations may be important for long-term administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt can be prepared as described in WO98/50433 and process analogous thereto.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPanitumumab may be dosed ranging from 0.01 to 5.0 mg/kg once per week, 6.0 mg/kg once every two weeks or 9.0 mg/kg once every three weeks administered by intravenous infusion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a Phase 3 pivotal study examining panitumumab as third-line monotherapy in colorectal cancer patients, patients received panitumumab every two weeks.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe farnesyltransferase inhibitor tipifarnib prevents signaling thru ras-mediated pathways and is under investigation for the treatment of myeloid leukemias.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of agents which target EGFR tyrosine kinase activity include the tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib. Gefitinib which has the chemical name 4-(3-chloro-4-fluoroanilino)-7-methoxy-6-(3-morpholinopropoxy)quinazoline, is used for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer. It has also been studied for other solid tumours that over-express EGF receptors such as breast and colorectal cancer. It has been found that patients receiving gefitinib may develop interstitial lung disease and eye irritation Erlotinib, which has the chemical name N-(3-ethynyl-phenyl)-6,7-bis(2-methoxyethoxy)-4-quinazoline, has also been used for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer, and is being developed for the treatment of various other solid tumours such as pancreatic cancer, the most common side effects being rash, loss of appetite and fatigue; a more serious side effect which has been reported is interstitial lung disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother growth factor which has received attention as a target for anticancer research is the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF is a key regulator of vasculogenesis during angiogenic processes including wound healing, retinopathy, psoriasis, inflammatory disorders, tumour growth and metastasis. Studies have shown that over-expression of VEGF is strongly associated with invasion and metastasis in human malignant disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn example of an antibody that targets the VEGF antigen on the surface of a cell is the monoclonal antibody bevacizumab which is a recombinant humanised monoclonal IgG1 antibody that binds to and inhibits VEGF. Bevacizumab has been used for the treatment of colorectal cancer, for example in combination with chemotherapy e.g. 5-fluorouracil. Bevacizumab also being developed as a potential treatment for other solid tumours such as metastatic breast cancer, metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma. The most serious adverse events associated with bevacizumab include gastrointestinal perforations, hypertensive crises, nephrotic syndrome and congestive heart failure. Other therapeutic agents in development which target the action of VEGF at alternate points in the signal transduction cascade intiated by this growth factor include sunitinib which is marketed under the trade name Sutent by Sugen/Pfizer and inhibits the kinase activity of the VEGF receptor. Sutent has demonstrated efficacy in Phase III trials in gastrointestinal stromal tumours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother growth factor of importance in tumour development is the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) that comprises a family of peptide growth factors that signal through cell surface tyrosine kinase receptors (PDGFR) and stimulate various cellular functions including growth, proliferation, and differentiation. PDGF expression has been demonstrated in a number of different solid tumours including glioblastomas and prostate carcinomas. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate, which has the chemical name 4-[(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)methyl]-N-[4-methyl-3-[[4-(3-pyridinyl)-2-ylpyridinyl]amino]-phenyl]benzamide methanesulfonate, blocks activity of the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein and the cell surface tyrosine kinase receptor c-Kit, and as such is approved for the treatment on chronic myeloid leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumours. Imatinib mesylate is also a potent inhibitor of PDGFR kinase and is currently being evaluated for the treatment of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and glioblastoma multiforme, based upon evidence in these diseases of activating mutations in PDGFR. The most frequently reported drug-related adverse events were edema, nausea, vomiting, cramps and musculosketetal pain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA further growth factor target for cancer chemotherapy is inhibition of Raf which is a key enzyme in the chain reaction of the body's chemistry that triggers cell growth. Abnormal activation of this pathway is a common factor in the development of most cancers, including two-thirds of melanomas. By blocking the action of Raf kinase, it may be possible to reverse the progression of these tumours. One such inhibitor is sorafenib (a.k.a. BAY 43-9006 and Nexavar) which has the chemical name 4-(4-(3-(4-chloro-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)ureido)phenoxy)-N2-methylpyridine-2-carboxamide. Sorafenib targets both the Raf signalling pathway to inhibit cell proliferation and the VEGFR/PDGFR signalling cascades to inhibit tumour angiogenesis. Raf kinase is a specific enzyme in the Ras pathway. Mutations in the Ras gene occur in approximately 20 percent of all human cancers, including 90 percent of pancreatic cancers, 50 percent of colon cancers and 30 percent of non-small cell lung cancers. Sorafenib is being investigated for the treatment of a number of cancers including liver and kidney cancer. The most common side effects of sorafenib are pain, swelling, redness of the hands and/or feet, and also rash, fatigue and diarrhea.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBiological activity: The signalling inhibitors of the combinations of the invention are specific inhibitors of cell signalling proteins as described above and have activity against various cancers. Combinations of compounds of formula I with signalling inhibitors may be beneficial in the treatment and diagnosis of many types of cancer. Combination with a molecularly targeted agent such as a signalling inhibitor (e.g. Iressa, Avastin, herceptin, or Gleevec™) would find particular application in relation to cancers which express or have activated the relevant molecular target such as EGF receptor, VEGF receptor, ErbB2, BCRabl, c-kit, PDGF. Diagnosis of such tumours could be performed using techniques known to a person skilled in the art and as described herein such as RTPCR and FISH.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProblems: There is a need to increase the inhibitory efficacy of signalling inhibitors against tumour growth and also to provide a means for the use of lower dosages of signaling inhibitors to reduce the potential for adverse toxic side effects to the patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferences: Preferred signalling inhibitors for use in accordance with the invention include antibodies targeting EGFR such as monoclonal antibodies trastuzumab and cetuximab, EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as gefitinib and erlotinib, VEGF targeting antibody is bevacizumab, PDGFR inhibitor such as imatinib mesylate and Raf inhibitor such as sorafenib referred to herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred antibodies targeting EGFR include the monoclonal antibodies trastuzumab and cetuximab. Trastuzumab is commercially available from Genentech Inc under the trade name Herceptin, or may be obtained as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,821,337. Cetuximab is commercially available from Bristol-Myers Squibb Corporation under the trade name Erbitux, or may be obtained as described in PCT patent specification No. WO 96/40210.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors include gefitinib and erlotinib. Gefitinib is commercially available from AstraZeneca plc under the trade name Iressa, or may be obtained as described in PCT patent specification No. WO 96/33980. Erlotinib is commercially available from Genentech/Roche under the trade name Tarceva, or may be obtained as described in PCT patent specification No. WO 96/30347.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA preferred antibody targeting VEGF is bevacizumab which is commercially available from Genentech Inc under the trade name Avastin, or may be obtained as described in PCT patent specification No. WO 94/10202.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA preferred PDGFR inhibitor is imatinib mesylate which is commercially available from Novartis AG under the trade name Gleevec™ (a.k.a. Glivec®), or may be obtained as described in European patent specification No 564409.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA preferred Raf inhibitor is sorafenib which is available from Bayer AG, or may be obtained as described in PCT patent specification No. WO 00/42012.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecific embodiments: In one embodiment, the signalling inhibitor is gefitinib (Iressa). In other embodiments the signalling inhibitor is selected from trastuzumab, cetuximab, gefitinib, erlotinib, bevacizumab, imatinib mesylate and sorafenib.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther combinations of the invention include the following signalling inhibitors: dasatinib, lapatinib, nilotinib, vandetanib, vatalinib and CHIR-258, in particular dasatinib, lapatinib, nilotinib, vandetanib and vatalinib.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBMS is developing dasatinib (Sprycel or BMS-354825) an oral multitargeted kinase inhibitor, for the potential twice-daily treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and solid tumors. The drug is also under investigation for multiple myeloma (MM) and other hematologic malignancies. Dasatanib has proved effective in Ph+ CML and AML in clinical trials given twice daily at 50-90 mg and also in imatinib resistant patients. Thrombocytopenia and neutropenia were amongst the side effects observed during clinical evaluation of dasatinib.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe structure of dasatinib, a Src/Abl kinase inhibitor is below:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDasatinib can be prepared by processes described in or analogous to WO 00/062778, WO 2005/076990 and WO 2005/077945.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNovartis is developing nilotinib (AMN-107), an orally available signal transduction inhibitor that targets BCR-ABL, c-kit and PDGF, for the potential treatment of leukemias. The compound is being investigated for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), systemic mastocytosis or chronic eosinophilic leukemia (hypereosinophilic syndrome), refractory gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). Adverse events included hematological adverse events, headache, fatigue, muscle spasms, and nausea and vomiting. In early clinical studies doses of the order of 400 mg given twice daily have proved effective in treating CML, AML and ALL\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe structure of nilotinib is shown below. It can be prepared as described in or analogous to as described in WO 2004/005281 and WO 2005/049032.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nVatalanib (PTK787/ZK222584) is a VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase angiogenesis inhibitor, under development by Novartis AG (formerly Ciba-Geigy) and Schering AG, for the potential treatment of colorectal cancer. The compound entered trials for colorectal cancer, the first- and second-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (untreated and pretreated metastatic colorectal patients). Schering and Novartis are also investigating vatalanib in other solid tumors e.g. non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as a second-line monotherapy in patients with stage IIIb/IV disease who had relapsed or were refractory to first-line therapy, renal cell cancer and glioblastoma, and potentially prostate, ovarian, breast, pancreas and small cell lung cancers. In addition vatalanib is also investigated for wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Vatalanib has been evaluated at doses up to 1,250 mg daily in clinical studies. Adverse events include nausea/vomiting, fatigue, ataxia, lethargy, hypertension, headache, dizziness, diarrhoea, hypertension as well as syncope and neurotoxicity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVatalinib (structure shown below) can be prepared as described in or analogues to as described in WO 98/35958\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLapatinib ditosylate (Tykerb or GW2016/572016), an ErbB2 and EGFR dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is being developed by GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK) for the potential treatment of solid tumors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is under investigation for various tumors including breast, lung, stomach, bladder and head and neck cancers, in particular for the treatment of patients with refractory advanced or metastatic breast cancer whose tumours express HER-2 and who have failed previous therapies both as a single agent and in combination with other therapies including capecitabine and paclitaxel. The compound had also entered trials for renal cell cancer, advanced and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and in the treatment of brain metastases associated with breast cancer. In early clinical evaluation Lapatinib has been evaluated on a twice daily and once daily schedule at doses over the range 500-1500 mg and at doses of 750-1250 mg given twice daily. Side effects include gastrointestinal gaseous symptoms, rash, headache and abnormal liver function tests.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nQuinazoline compounds, and ditosylate salts, anhydrate or hydrate forms such as of the structure shown below (lapatinib) can be synthesised using the process described in WO 00/202552 and WO 99/35146 or process analogues thereto.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVandetanib (ZD-6474; Zactima; formerly AZD-6474) is under development by AstraZeneca for the potential once-daily oral treatment of solid and haematological tumors including thyroid, lung, breast, head and neck, brain (i.e. glioma) and multiple myeloma. It is one of a series of inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor tyrosine kinase) that also has activity against the EGF and RET receptor tyrosine kinases. Clinical studies have investigated doses of vandetanib in the region of 100-300 mg daily as monotherapy and in combinations.

CHIR-258 (GFKI-258; structure shown), is a potent VEGF, FGF and PDGF receptor kinase inhibitor, for the potential oral treatment of various types of cancer. Novartis (formerly Chiron), had initiated a study in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients and multiple myeloma (MM).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCHIR-258 can be prepared as described in WO 02/22598 and WO 2005/046590 and processes analogous therein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother suitable signalling inhibitor for use in the combinations of the invention is axitinib (AG-013736). Pfizer is developing axitinib (AG-13736, AG-013736), an oral inhibitor of the VEGF, PDGF and CSF-1 receptor tyrosine kinases which was discovered by Pfizer's wholly-owned subsidiary Agouron Pharmaceuticals, as an anti-angiogenic agent for the potential treatment of cancer. It is being studied for breast cancer, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), melanoma, and carcinomas. The compound has also being investigated for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt can be prepared as described in WO 2004/087152, WO 2006/048746 and WO 2006/048745 and process analogous thereto. Axitinib may be dosed at 5 mg PO BID.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPosology: With regard to the EGFR antibodies, these are generally administered in a dosage of 1 to 500 mg per square meter (mg/m\n2\n) of body surface area, trastuzumab being advantageously administered in a dosage of 1 to 5 mg/m\n2 \nof body surface area, particularly 2 to 4 mg/m\n2\n; cetuxumab is advantageously administered in a dosage of about 200 to 400 mg/m\n2\n, preferably about 250 mg/m\n2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWith regard to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, these are generally administered in a daily oral dosage of 100 to 500 mg, for example gefitinib in a dosage of about 250 mg and erlotinib in a dosage of about 150 mg.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWith regard to the VEGF monoclonal antibody bevacizumab, this is generally administered in a dosage of about 1 to 10 mg/kg for example about 5 mg/kg.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWith regard to the PDGF inhibitor imatinib, this is generally administered in a dosage of about 400 to 800 mg per day preferably about 400 mg per day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWith regard to the Raf inhibitor sorafenib, this is administered at a dose of 800 mg daily.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese dosages may be administered for example once, twice or more per course of treatment, which may be repeated for example every 7, 14, 21 or 28 days.\n\n\n \nPKA/B Inhibitors and PKB Pathway Inhibitors\n\n\n \n \n \nAnother preferred class of signaling inhibitor for use in the combinations of the invention are PKA/B inhibitors and PKB pathway inhibitors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPKB pathway inhibitors are those that inhibit the activation of PKB, the activity of the kinase itself or modulate downstream targets, blocking the proliferative and cell survival effects of the pathway. Target enzymes in the pathway include phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase (PI3K), PKB itself, mammalian target of rapamycin (MTOR), PDK-1 and p70 S6 kinase and forkhead translocation factor. Several components of the PI 3-kinase/PKB/PTEN pathway are implicated in oncogenesis. In addition to growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases, integrin-dependent cell adhesion and G-protein coupled receptors activate PI 3-kinase both directly and indirectly through adaptor molecules. Functional loss of PTEN (the most commonly mutated tumour-suppressor gene in cancer after p53), oncogenic mutations in PI 3-kinase, amplification of PI 3-kinase and overexpression of PKB have been established in many malignancies. In addition, persistent signaling through the PI 3-kinase/PKB pathway by stimulation of the insulin-like growth factor receptor is a mechanism of resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe discovery of non-random, somatic mutations in the gene encoding p110α in a range of human tumours suggests an oncogenic role for the mutated PI 3-kinase enzyme (Samuels, et al., Science, 304 554, April 2004). Mutations in p110α have since been detected in the following human tumours: colon (32%), hepatocellular (36%) and endometroid and clear cell cancer (20%). p110α is now the most commonly mutated gene in breast tumours (25-40%). Forkhead family translocations often occur in acute leukemia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe PI 3-kinase/PKB/PTEN pathway is thus an attractive target for cancer drug development since such agents would be expected to inhibit proliferation and surmount resistance to cytotoxic agents in cancer cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of PKB pathway inhibitors include PI3K Inhibitors such as Semaphore, SF1126 and MTOR inhibitors such as Rapamycin Analogues. RAD 001 (everolimus) from Novartis is an orally available derivative of the compound rapamycin. The compound is a novel macrolide, which is being developed as an antiproliferative drug with applications as an immunosuppressant and anticancer agent. RAD001 exerts its activity on growth-factor dependent proliferation of cells through its high affinity for an intracellular receptor protein, FKBP-12. The resulting FKBP-12/RAD001 complex then binds with mTOR to inhibit downstream signaling events. The compound is currently in clinical development for a wide variety of oncology indications. CCI 779 (temsirolemus) from Wyeth Pharmaceuticals and AP23573 from Ariad Pharmaceuticals are also rapamycin analogues. AP23841 and AP23573 from Ariad Pharmaceutical also target mTOR. Calmodulin inhibitors from Harvard are forkhead translocation inhibitors. (Nature Reviews drug discovery, Exploiting the PI3K/AKT Pathway for Cancer Drug Discovery; Bryan T. Hennessy, Debra L.

Mills; December 2005, Volume 4; pages 988-1004).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDefinitions: The term “PKA/B inhibitor” is used herein to define a compound which has protein kinase B (PKB) and/or protein kinase A (PKA) inhibiting or modulating activity, including the ionic, salt, solvate, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, ester, prodrugs, isotopes and protected forms thereof (preferably the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof, and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof), as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “PKB pathway inhibitor” is used herein to define a compound which inhibits the activation of PKB, the activity of the kinase itself or modulate downstream targets, blocking the proliferative and cell survival effects of the pathway (including one or more of the target enzymes in the pathway as described herein, including phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase (PI3K), PKB itself, mammalian target of rapamycin (MTOR), PDK-1 and p70 S6 kinase and forkhead translocation).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTechnical background: KRX-0401 (Perifosine/NSC 639966) is a synthetic substituted heterocyclic alkylphosphocholine that acts primarily at the cell membrane targeting signal transduction pathways, including inhibition of PKB phosphorylation. KRX-0401 has been evaluated in \nphase\n 1 studies as a potential oral anticancer drug. Dose limiting toxicities included nausea, vomiting and fatigue. Gastrointestinal toxicities increased at higher doses. A phase II trial in refractory sarcoma is planned.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAPI-2/TCN is a small molecule inhibitor of PKB signaling pathway in tumour cells. Phase I and II clinical trials of API-2/TCN have been conducted on advanced tumours. API-2/TCN exhibited some side effects, which include hepatotoxicity, hypertriglyceridemia, thrombocytopenia, and hyperglycemia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRX-0201 is being developed as an AKT protein kinase inhibitor for the treatment of solid tumours. In July 2004, a phase I trial was initiated in patients with advanced malignancies. Data from this showed RX-0201 inhibited overexpression of Akt and suppressed cancer growth in brain, breast, cervix, liver, lung, ovary, prostate and stomach tumours, and was well tolerated. By March 2005, US Orphan Drug status had been granted to RX-0201 for several solid tumour types.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnzastaurin HCl (LY317615) suppresses angiogenesis and was advanced for clinical development based upon anti-angiogenic activity. It is described as a selective PKCβ inhibitor. It also has a direct anti-tumour effect, and suppresses GSKβ phosphorylation. It is currently being investigated for the treatment of glioma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSR-13668 is claimed to be an orally active specific AKT inhibitor that significantly inhibits phospho-AKT in breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. In vivo assessment in mice showed no adverse effects at \ndoses\n 10 times more than were needed for antitumour activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPX-316 is a D-3-deoxy-phosphatidyl-myo-inositol that binds to the PH domain of PKB, trapping it in the cytoplasm and thus preventing PKB activation. Anti-tumour activity was seen in early xenografts and was well tolerated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAllosteric, selective inhibitors of PKB based on a 2,3-diphenylquinoxaline core or a 5,6-diphenylpyrazin-2(1H)-one core have been developed (Merck).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nKRX-0401: In a Phase I weekly dosing study conducted in Europe, the recommended Phase II dose was 600/mg/week. Subsequent studies conducted in the U.S. have shown that much higher doses are well tolerated when the doses are divided and administered at 4 to 6 hour intervals. In addition, it has been shown that KRX-0401 has a very long half-life in the range of 100 hours. This makes the possibility of a relative non-toxic, intermittent dosing schedule very plausible.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA phase I trial of API-2 was conducted using a 5-day continuous infusion schedule. Dose levels ranged from 10 mg/sq m/day×5 days to 40 mg/sq m/day×5 days. Initially, courses were repeated every 3 to 4 weeks. As cumulative toxicity became manifested, the interval between courses was changed to every 6 weeks. Recommended schedule for Phase II studies is 20 mg/sq m/day for 5 days every 6 weeks. A Phase II trial of TCN-P was conducted in metastatic or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix using a 5-day continuous infusion schedule. The starting dose was 35 mg/m\n2\n×5 days and courses were repeated every 6 weeks.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther PKB inhibitors include Perifosine from Keryx Biopharmaceuticals. Perifosine is an oral Akt inhibitor which exerts a marked cytotoxic effect on human tumour cell lines, and is currently being tested in several phase II trials for treatment of major human cancers.

COX-2 Inhibitors\n\n\n \n \n \nDefinition: The term “COX-2 inhibitor” is used herein to define compounds which inhibit or modulate the activity of the cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme, including the ionic, salt, solvate, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, ester, prodrugs, isotopes and protected forms thereof (preferably the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof, and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof), as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBiological activity: The COX-2 inhibitors working via one or more pharmacological actions as described herein have been identified as suitable anti-cancer agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTechnical background: Recently, research in cancer chemotherapy has focused on the role of the cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme in the aetiology of cancer. Epidemiological studies have shown that people who regularly take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), for example aspirin and ibuprofen to treat conditions such as arthritis, have lower rates of colorectal polyps, colorectal cancer, and death due to colorectal cancer. NSAIDs block cyclooxygenase enzymes, which are produced by the body in inflammatory processes, and which are also produced by pre-cancerous tissues. For example in colon cancers, a dramatic increase of COX-2 levels is observed. One of the key factors for tumour growth is the supply of blood to support its increased size. Many tumours can harness chemical pathways that prompt the body to create a web of new blood vessels around the cancer, a process called angiogenesis. COX-2 is believed to have a role in this process. It has therefore been concluded that inhibition of COX-2 may be effective for treating cancer, and COX-2 inhibitors have been developed for this purpose. For example celecoxib, which has the chemical name 4-[5-(4-methylphenyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl]benzenesulfonamide, is a selective COX-2 inhibitor that is being investigated for the treatment of various cancers including bladder and esophageal cancer, renal cell carcinoma, cervical cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and non-small cell lung cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPosology: The COX-2 inhibitor (for example celecoxib) can be administered in a dosage such as 100 to 200 mg e.g. daily.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese dosages may also be administered for example once, twice or more per course of treatment, which may be repeated for example every 7, 14, 21 or 28 days.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProblems: The most common adverse effects are headache, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, diarrhea, nausea, flatulence and insomnia. There is a need to provide a means for the use of lower dosages of COX-2 inhibitors to reduce the potential for adverse toxic side effects to the patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferences and specific embodiments: In one embodiment the COX-2 inhibitor is celecoxib. Celecoxib is commercially available for example from Pfizer Inc under the trade name Celebrex, or may be prepared for example as described in PCT patent specification No. WO 95/15316, or by processes analogous thereto.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo other commercially available COX-2 inhibitors are Arcoxia (etoricoxib from Merck) and Novartis Cox-2 inhibitor lumiracoxib (Prexige).\n\n\n \n16. HDAC Inhibitors\n\n\n \n \n \nDefinition: The term “HDAC inhibitor” is used herein to define compounds which inhibit or modulate the activity of histone deacetylases (HDAC), including the ionic, salt, solvate, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, ester, prodrugs, isotopes and protected forms thereof (preferably the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof, and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof), as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBiological activity: The HDAC inhibitors working via one or more pharmacological actions as described herein have been identified as suitable anti-cancer agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTechnical background: Reversible acetylation of histones is a major regulator of gene expression that acts by altering accessibility of transcription factors to DNA. In normal cells, histone deacetylase (HDAC) and histone acetyltrasferase (HDA) together control the level of acetylation of histones to maintain a balance. Inhibition of HDA results in the accumulation of hyperacetylated histones, which results in a variety of cellular responses. Inhibitors of HDA (HDAI) have been studied for their therapeutic effects on cancer cells. Recent developments in the field of HDAI research have provided active compounds, that are suitable for treating tumours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccruing evidence suggests that HDAI are more efficacious when used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. There are both synergistic and additive advantages, both for efficacy and safety. Therapeutic effects of combinations of chemotherapeutic agents with HDAI can result in lower safe dosage ranges of each component in the combination.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe study of inhibitors of histone deacetylases (HDAC) indicate that these enzymes play an important role in cell proliferation and differentiation. The inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA) causes cell cycle arrest at both G1 and G2 phases, reverts the transformed phenotype of different cell lines, and induces differentiation of Friend leukaemia cells and others. TSA (and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid SAHA) have been reported to inhibit cell growth, induce terminal differentiation, and prevent the formation of tumours in mice (Finnin et al., Nature, 401:188-193, 1999).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTrichostatin A has also been reported to be useful in the treatment of fibrosis, e.g. liver fibrosis and liver chirrhosis. (Geerts et al., European Patent Application EPO 827 742, published 11 Mar. 1998).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferences and specific embodiments: Preferred HDAC inhibitors for use in accordance with the invention are selected from TSA, SAHA, JNJ-16241199, LAQ-824, MGCD-0103 and PXD-101 (referred to above).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, synthetic inhibitors of histone deacetylases (HDAC) which are suitable for use in the present invention include JNJ-16241199 from Johnson and Johnson Inc, LAQ-824 from Novartis, MGCD-0103 from MethylGene, and PXD-101 from Prolifix.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nJNJ-16241199 has the following structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMGCD-0103 has the structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLAQ-824 has the structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther inhibitors of histone deacetylases (HDAC) which are suitable for use in the present invention include, but are not limited to, the peptide chlamydocin, and A-173, also from Abbott Laboratories.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA-173 is a succinimide macrocyclic compound with the following structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPosology: In general, for HDAC inhibitors it is contemplated that a therapeutically effective amount would be from 0.005 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg body weight, and in particular from 0.005 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg body weight. It may be appropriate to administer the required dose as two, three, four or more sub-doses at appropriate intervals throughout the day. Said sub-doses may be formulated as unit dosage forms, for example, containing 0.5 to 500 mg, and in particular 10 mg to 500 mg of active ingredient per unit dosage form.\n\n\n \n17. Selective Immunoresponse Modulators\n\n\n \n \n \nSelective immunoresponse modulators include Lenalidomide and Thalidomide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLenalidomide (Revlimid) is an oral thalidomide derivative developed by Celgene which is a potent inhibitor of TNF-alpha and interleukin-1 beta which is being developed for the treatment of 5q-myelodysplastic syndrome multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia gliomas, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and epithelial ovarian cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLenalidomide (3-(4-amino-1-oxoisoindolin-2-yl)piperidine-2,6-dione) has the following structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThalidomide is a sedative and anti-emetic that became widely recognized as a result of reports of its teratogenic effects, most notably limb deformities in up to 12,000 children born to women who had received thalidomide in Europe and Canada during the 1960s. Celgene has developed and launched thalidomide as an oral TNF-alpha inhibitor (Sold to Pharmion). Extensive clinical evidence has accumulated with regard to the potential antitumor activity of thalidomide in several types of neoplasias, with notable activity in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). There is also evidence of biological activity in acute myeloid leukemia, myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia, renal cell carcinoma, malignant gliomas, prostate cancer, Kaposi's sarcoma and colorectal carcinoma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThalidomide (1,3-dioxo-2-(2,6-dioxopiperidin-3-yl)isoindoline) has the following structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPosology: Thalidomide may be advantageously administered in dosages of 100 to 800 mg/day continuously as tolerated. Lenalidomide may be advantageously administered in 5- to 40-mg doses continuously as tolerated.\n\n\n \n18. DNA Methylase Inhibitors\n\n\n \n \n \nDefinition: The term “DNA methylase inhibitor” or “DNA methyltransferase inhibitor” as used herein refers to a compound which directly or indirectly perturbs, disrupts, blocks, modulates or inhibits the methylation of DNA, including the ionic, salt, solvate, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, ester, prodrugs, isotopes and protected forms thereof (preferably the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof, and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof), as described above. They are also referred to as “hypomethylating agents”.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBiological activity: The DNA methylase inhibitors working via one or more pharmacological actions as described herein have been identified as suitable anti-cancer agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTechnical background: One target for cancer chemotherapy is DNA synthesis, which may depend on appropriate methylation of tumour DNA. Compounds which directly or indirectly perturb, disrupt, block, modulate or inhibit the methylation of DNA may therefore be useful anticancer drugs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe DNA methylase inhibitor temozolomide is used for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme, and first-line treatment of patients with advanced metastatic malignant melanoma (such as first-line treatment of patients with advanced metastatic malignant melanoma) and has also being investigated and used for the treatment of malignant glioma at first relapse. This compound undergoes rapid chemical conversion at physiological pH to the active compound, monomethyl triazeno imidazole carboxamide (MTIC) which is responsible for the methylation of DNA at the O\n6 \nposition of guanine residues (which appears to lead to a suppression in expression of DNA methyltransferase and so produce hypomethylation).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProblems: The most common side effects associated with temozolomide therapy are nausea, vomiting, headache, fatigue, thrombocytopenia and constipation. There is a need to increase the inhibitory efficacy of DNA\\methylase inhibitors and to provide a means for the use of lower dosages of signaling inhibitors to reduce the potential for adverse toxic side effects to the patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferences and specific embodiments: In one embodiment, the DNA methylase inhibitor is temozolomide (3,4-dihydro-3-methyl-4-oxoimidazo[5,1-d]-as-tetrazine-8-carboxamide). Temozolomide is commercially available for example from Schering Corporation under the trade name Temodar, or may be prepared for example as described in German patent specification No. 3231255, or by processes analogous thereto.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA further DNA methyltransferase inhibitor for use in the combinations of the invention is Decitabine (a.k.a. Dacogen) having the structure shown below:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuperGen Inc and MGI Pharma Inc have developed decitabine (Dacogen), an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase, preventing methylation of cytosine residues on DNA and leading to hypomethylation of gene promoters, thereby reactivating silenced genes. Decitabine/Dacogen is cytotoxic to a broad range of malignant cells in vitro. It shows significant activity against acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Decitabine/Dacogen is indicated for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and secondary MDS (including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, refractory anemia, refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts, refractory anemia with excess blasts and refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDecitabine/Dacogen is an analog of deoxycytidine (beta-D-anomer of 2′-deoxy-5-azacytidine). It differs from deoxycytidine by substitution at \nposition\n 5 of the pyrimidine ring with nitrogen. Decitabine contains deoxyribose, in contrast to the related analog, Pharmion Corp's 5-azacytidine (Vidaza), which contains a ribose sugar. Decitabine is, therefore, a deoxynucleoside and is incorporated into DNA, but not RNA, in contrast to 5-azacytidine which is incorporated into RNA. Decitabine and 5-azacytidine differ from other pyrimidine analogs, such as cytosine arabinoside and gemcitabine, by modification at \nposition\n 5 of the pyrimidine ring. This distinctive feature, which is not present in these latter drugs, is responsible for inhibition of DNA methyltransferase. Pseudoisocytidine and 5-fluoro-2′-deoxycytidine, further analogs with modifications of the 5 position of the pyrimidine ring, also inhibit demethylation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDecitabine/Dacogen is dosed at 15 mg/m2 over a three hour period every 8 hours for 3 days every 6 weeks as a cycle of therapy or on a daily dosing schedule with a one hour infusion usually delivered at 20 mg/m2 per day either for one week or two weeks every 6 weeks as a cycle\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt toxic doses decitabine/Dacogen produces leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and weight loss. The major toxicity of decitabine is myelosuppression, which is proportional to dose and duration of therapy. The effects are pronounced at high doses (>200 mg/m2/day), and myelosuppression is enhanced by concomitant administration of other cytotoxic drugs. Neutropenic infection and other complications of myelosuppression have proved fatal. Non-hematological side effects include nausea, vomiting, mucositis and alopecia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDecitabine/Dacogen and other analogues thereof can be made as outlined in U.S. Pat. No. 0,343,2549 and further discussed on WO 006/017278 and WO 2006/037024 to SuperGen Inc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA further DNA methyltransferase inhibitor for use in the combinations of the invention is azacytidine (a.k.a. 5-azacitidine, 5-azacytidine or Vidaza) a sc administered hypomethylating agent and DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. It is indicated for the treatment of all myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) subtypes, including refractory anemia (RA) or RA with ringed sideroblasts, RA with excess blasts, RA with excess blasts in transformation and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n5-azacitidine (Vidaza) can be administered twice-daily subcutaneously or via the iv route administration for MDS treatment.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt can be prepared as described in DE 1922702, GB 1227691 and FR 2008048 from Ceskoslovenska Akademie Ved and WO 2004082618, WO 2004082619 and WO 2004082822 from Pharmion and process analogous thereto.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPosology: The DNA methylating agent (for example temozolomide) can be administered in a dosage such as 0.5 to 2.5 mg per square meter (mg/m\n2\n) of body surface area, particularly about 1.3 mg/m\n2\n. These dosages may be administered for example once, twice or more per course of treatment, which may be repeated for example every 7, 14, 21 or 28 days.\n\n\n \n19. Proteasome Inhibitors\n\n\n \n \n \nDefinition: The term “proteasome inhibitor” as used herein refers to compounds which directly or indirectly perturb, disrupt, block, modulate or inhibit the half-life of many short-lived biological processes, such as those involved in the cell cycle. The term therefore embraces compounds which block the action of proteasomes (large protein complexes that are involved in the turnover of other cellular proteins). The term also embraces the ionic, salt, solvate, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, ester, prodrugs, isotopes and protected forms thereof (preferably the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof, and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof), as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBiological activity: The proteasome inhibitors working via one or more pharmacological actions as described herein have been identified as suitable anti-cancer agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTechnical background: Another class of anticancer agents are the proteasome inhibitors. Proteasomes control the half-life of many short-lived biological processes, such as those involved in the cell cycle. Therefore, proteasome malfunction can lead to abnormal regulation of the cell cycle and uncontrolled cell growth.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cell cycle is controlled by both positive and negative signals. In a normal cell, proteasomes break down proteins that inhibit the cell cycle, such as cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. Inhibition of proteasome function causes cell cycle arrest and cell death. Tumour cells are more susceptible to these effects than normal cells, in part because they divide more rapidly and in part because many of their normal regulatory pathways are disrupted. The mechanism for the differential response of normal and cancer cells to proteasome inhibition is not fully understood. Overall, cancer cells are more susceptible to proteasome inhibitors and, as a result, these inhibitors may be an effective treatment for certain cancers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne such proteasome inhibitor is bortezimib, which has the chemical name [(1R)-3-methyl-1-[[(2S)-1-oxo-3-phenyl-2-[(pyrazinylcarbonyl)amino]propyl]amino]butyl]-boronic acid. Bortezimib specifically interacts with a key amino acid, namely threonine, within the catalytic site of the proteasome. Bortezimib is being used for the treatment of multiple myeloma and also for a number of other cancers, including leukemia and lymphoma, and prostate, pancreatic and colorectal carcinoma. In addition Velcade is useful for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProblems: The most common side effects with bortezimib are nausea, tiredness, diarrhea, constipation, decreased platelet blood count, fever, vomiting, and decreased appetite. Bortezimib can also cause peripheral neuropathy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, there is a need to provide a means for the use of lower dosages to reduce the potential of adverse toxic side effects to the patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferences and specific embodiments: Preferred proteasome inhibitors for use in accordance with the invention include bortezimib. Bortezimib is commercially available for example from Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc under the trade name Velcade, or may be prepared for example as described in PCT patent specification No. WO 96/13266, or by processes analogous thereto.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPosology: The proteasome inhibitor (such as bortezimib) can be administered in a dosage such as 100 to 200 mg/m\n2\n. These dosages may be administered for example once, twice or more per course of treatment, which may be repeated for example every 7, 14, 21 or 28 days.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibiotic bleomycin may also be used as a cytotoxic agent as an anti-cancer agent according to the invention.\n\n\n \n20. Aurora Inhibitors\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the invention, the auxiliary compound is an inhibitor of Aurora kinase(s). Preferred Aurora inhibitors for use as auxiliary agents in the combinations of the invention are compounds of formula (I′) as defined herein. However, Aurora inhibitors for use in the combinations of the invention also include the auxiliary Aurora inhibitors described in more detail below. Thus, the combinations of the present invention may comprise (or consist essentially of) two or more compounds of formula (I′) as defined herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the Aurora inhibitors of formula (I′) as defined herein, the combinations of the present invention may include one or more auxiliary Aurora inhibitors or modulators. Such auxiliary Aurora inhibitors or modulators may be selected from the various Aurora inhibitors described herein and preferred auxiliary Aurora inhibitors are discussed in more detail below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDefinition: The term “Aurora kinase inhibitor” (or simply “Aurora inhibitor”) as used herein refers to compounds that inhibit or modulate the activity of any of the Aurora kinase isoforms A, B and/or C as described herein, including the ionic, salt, solvate, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, ester, prodrugs, isotopes and protected forms thereof (preferably the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof, and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof), as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “auxiliary Aurora inhibitor” as used herein refers to compounds that inhibit or modulate the activity of any of the Aurora kinase isoforms A, B and/or C and which do not conform to the structure of formula (I′) as defined herein, including the ionic, salt, solvate, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, ester, prodrugs, isotopes and protected forms thereof (preferably the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof, and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof), as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTechnical Background: Aurora kinases play a role in regulating the cell cycle and in particular in the process of cellular mitosis (they have an important role in the mitotic phase of the cell cycle). Therefore, Aurora kinase inhibitors may find application in the treatment of diseases in which there is a disorder of proliferation, cell division, differentiation such as cancer. In particular tumours with mitotic and or spindle defects may be particularly sensitive to CDK inhibitors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInhibition of the Aurora kinases has been shown to substantially disrupt the mitotic process leading to early mitotic effects from inhibition of Aurora A and late abnormalities of cytokinesis by inhibition of Aurora B. Combining Aurora kinase inhibitors with agents that activate, interfere with or modulate the mitotic or cell cycle checkpoint sensitises cells to the cytotoxic effects and a beneficial combination effect is observed (Anand S, Penrhyn-Lowe S, Venkitaraman A R. Cancer Cell. 2003 January; 3(1):51-62). In this context a combination of Aurora kinase inhibitors with the taxanes, epothilones or \nvinca \nalkaloids are beneficial. Particular taxanes, epothilones and \nvinca \nalkaloids are described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of auxiliary Aurora kinase inhibitors include AZD1152, MK0457 (VX680), PHA-739358, MLN-8054, MP-235 in particular MK0457 (VX680), PHA-739358, MLN-8054, MP-235. AZD1152 is undergoing clinical evaluation. AZD1152 is a pro-drug which is converted rapidly to the active moiety AZD1152-HQPA in the plasma (AZD-1152 hydroxy-QPA, structure shown below). In early studies in patients with advanced solid malignancies, AZD1152 given in a 2 hr infusion weekly, induces p53 independent cellular multinucleation and polyploidy, resulting in apoptosis. These early studies indicate neutropenia is the dose-limiting toxicology (ASCO 2006).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAZD1152 and AZD1152-HQPA can be synthesized as described in WO 02/00649 or by processes analogous thereto.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMK0457 (VX-680) is undergoing clinical evaluation. MK0457 has been given to patients with refractory malignancies in a continuous 5 day infusion every 28 days. These early studies indicate neutropenia is the dose-limiting toxicology (ASCO 2006).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMK0457 can be synthesised as described in Harrington et al, \nNat.

MP-235 can be synthesised as described in WO 2005/037825 and by processes analogous thereto\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther Aurora compounds include those described herein, including an additional compound of formula (I′), a further compound of the formula (I″) and also includes those described in Formula (I) of WO2005/002552 (PCT/GB2004/002824). WO 2005/002552 is incorporated herein by reference and relates to compounds of Formula (I) as laid out therein.\n\n\n \n21. Hsp90 Inhibitors\n\n\n \n \n \nDefinition: The term Hsp90 inhibitor as used herein refers to compounds that inhibit or modulate the activity of \nHeat Shock Protein\n 90 as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTechnical Background: In response to cellular stresses including heat, toxins, radiation, infection, inflammation, and oxidants, all cells produce a common set of heat shock proteins (Hsps) (Macario & de Macario 2000). Most heat shock proteins act as molecular chaperones. Chaperones bind and stabilize proteins at intermediate stages of folding and allow proteins to fold to their functional states. Hsp90 is the most abundant cytosolic Hsp under normal conditions. There are two human isoforms of Hsp90, a major form Hsp90α and minor form Hsp9013. Hsp90 binds proteins at a late stage of folding and is distinguished from other Hsps in that most of its protein substrates are involved in signal transduction. It has been shown that ATP bound at the N-terminal pocket of Hsp90 is hydrolysed. This ATPase activity results in a conformational change in Hsp90 that is required to enable conformational changes in the client protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nActivation of Hsp90 is further regulated through interactions with a variety of other chaperone proteins and can be isolated in complex with other chaperones including Hsp70, Hip, Hop, p23, and p50cdc37. Many other co-chaperone proteins have also been demonstrated to bind Hsp90. There is some evidence that Hsp90 is found primarily within “activated” multichaperone complexes in the tumour cells as opposed to “latent” complexes in normal cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIncreased genetic instability associated with the cancer phenotype leads to an increase in the production of non-native or mutant proteins. The ubiquitin pathway also serves to protect the cell from non-native or misfolded proteins, by targeting these proteins for proteasomal degradation. Mutant proteins are by their nature not native and therefore have the potential to show structural instability and an increased requirement for the chaperone system. (Giannini et al., Mol Cell Biol. 2004; 24(13):5667-76).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe number of reported Hsp90 client proteins now exceeds 100. Since many of its client proteins are involved in cell signalling proliferation and survival, Hsp90 has received major interest as an oncology target. Hsp90 protein kinase client proteins implicated in cell proliferation and survival include the following; Cellular Src (c-Src), ErbB2 (Her2/neu), Polo-like kinases (Plks), Akt (PKB), c-Raf, B-RAF, Mek, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), c-met, Cdk1, Cdk2, Cdk4, and Cdk6, Wee-1, Mutant p53, Hypoxia inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of Hsp90 inhibitors include herbimycin, geldanamycin (GA), 17-AAG e.g. Kos-953 and CNF-1010, 17-DMAG (Kos-1022), CNF-2024 (an oral purine), and IPI-504, in particular 17-AAG e.g. Kos-953 and CNF-1010, 17-DMAG (Kos-1022), CNF-2024, and IPI-504. Preferred compounds are geldanamycin analogs such as 17-AAG e.g. Kos-953 and CNF-1010, 17-DMAG (Kos-1022), and IPI-504.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnsamycin antibiotics herbimycin, geldanamycin (GA) and 17-allylamino-17-desmethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) are ATP binding site inhibitors that block the binding of ATP and prevent conversion to the mature complex (Grenert et. al., 1997. J Biol. Chem., 272:23834-23850). Despite Hsp90 being ubiquitously expressed, GA and its analogues have a higher binding affinity for Hsp90 derived from tumour vs. normal cell lines (Kamal et. al., Nature 2003; 425: 407-410). GA also shows more potent cytotoxic activity in tumour cells and is sequestered at higher concentrations within tumours in xenograft mouse models (Brazidec \nJ. Med. Chem. \n2004, 47, 3865-3873). Furthermore the ATP-ase activity of Hsp90 is elevated in cancer cells and is an indication of the increased level of stress in these cells. Hsp90 gene amplification has also been reported to occur in the later stages of cancer (Jolly and Morimoto JNCI Vol. 92, No. 19, 1564-1572, 2000).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n17-MG (NSC-330507, 17-allylaminogeldanamycin) is an injectable semisynthetic derivative of geldanamycin and a polyketide inhibitor of Hsp90 identified at the University of Maryland under development by Kosan Biosciences, in collaboration with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the UK Institute of Cancer Research, for the potential treatment of cancer. Studies of 17-AAG have been initiated in melanoma, multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) and as a combination therapy with imatinib (qv) for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe structure of 17-AAG is outlined below. It can be prepared as described in WO 02/36574 and processes analogous those described therein.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nKOS-953 is a 17-MG formulation developed by Kosan that replaces the DMSO-egg lecithin vehicle used in the original formulation, with the aim of improving patient tolerability and providing greater stability. This can be prepared as described in WO 2005/110398 and processes analogous those described therein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConforma is developing CNF-1010, an organic solvent-free lipid-based formulation of 17-AAG (qv) for the potential iv treatment of cancer. This can be prepared as described in WO 03/026571, WO 02/069900 and WO 2006/050333 and processes analogous those described therein.

It is a water-soluble geldanamycin derivative and it is being investigated for advanced solid tumors. Kosan, under license from the National Cancer Institute (NCI), is developing an iv formulation of KOS-1022 (17-DMAG), for the potential treatment of solid tumors. Kosan is also developing an oral formulation of KOS-1022 (qv) for the same indication.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt can be prepared as described in WO 03/013430 and processes analogous to those described therein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInfinity is developing the Hsp90 inhibitor IPI-504, a further analog of 17-AAG (qv) that is soluble in aqueous formulations for iv administration, for the potential treatment of cancer.

Checkpoint Targeting Agents\n\n\n \n \n \nThe cell proliferation cycle is a complex process during which the cell first replicates its chromosomes and then undergoes cell division or cytokinesis. At various stages of the cycle, mechanisms exist to prevent further progression through the cycle until all appropriate events have occurred. This ensures the integrity of the DNA of the cell as it progresses through the cycle in the required sequential manner. One such checkpoint is known to occur in mitosis. This is variously referred to as the mitotic or spindle checkpoint. Cells are held at this checkpoint until all chromosomes are appropriately attached to the mitotic spindle via their centrosomes. Defects in this checkpoint lead to either aneuploid phenotypes, typical of cancer cells or an imbalance of chromosomes in daughter cells. Some cancer therapies are known to act by disruption of this checkpoint causing chromosome mis-alignment or premature cytokinesis leading to activation of a checkpoint that results in preferential death of the tumour cell. For example the taxanes and epothilones are classes of agents which cause stabilisation of spindle microtubules preventing the normal spindle contraction process. The \nvinca \nalkaloids are another class of agents which act to prevent spindle formation via an action on tubulin the principal protein in the microtubules. Agents which cause DNA damage or disrupt DNA replication including platinum compounds and nucleoside analogues such as 5-FU lead to cell arrest at checkpoints and subsequent cell death. They thus require a functional checkpoint for their therapeutic action.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Aurora kinases have an important role in the mitotic phase of the cell cycle. Inhibition of the Aurora kinases has been shown to substantially disrupt the mitotic process leading to early mitotic effects from inhibition of Aurora A and late abnormalities of cytokinesis by inhibition of Aurora B. It is believed that combining Aurora kinase inhibitors with agents that activate, interfere with or modulate the mitotic or cell cycle checkpoint could sensitise cells to the cytotoxic effects and a beneficial combination effect could be observed (Anand S, Penrhyn-Lowe S, Venkitaraman A R. Cancer Cell. 2003 January; 3(1):51-62). In this context a combination of Aurora kinase inhibitors with the taxanes, epothilones or \nvinca \nalkaloids would be expected to be beneficial. Particular taxanes, epothilones and \nvinca \nalkaloids are described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther checkpoint targeting agents are those that cause DNA damage or disrupt DNA replication including platinum compounds such as cisplatin and nucleoside analogues such as 5-FU leading to cell arrest at checkpoints and subsequent cell death. In this context a combination of Aurora kinase inhibitors with the platinum compounds and nucleoside analogues would be expected to be beneficial as they could sensitise cells to the cytotoxic effects. Particular platinum compounds and nucleoside analogues are described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther checkpoint targeting agents that activate, interfere with or modulate the cell cycle checkpoints which would also be expected to be particularly beneficial for use in combination with the Aurora inhibitors of the invention include polo-like kinase inhibitors (Plks), CHK kinase inhibitors, inhibitors of the BUB kinase family and kinesin inhibitors. Polo-like kinases are important regulators of cell cycle progression during M-phase. Plks are involved in the assembly of the mitotic spindle apparatus and in the activation of CDK/cyclin complexes. Plk1 regulates tyrosine dephosphorylation of CDKs through phosphorylation and activation of Cdc25C. CDK1 activation in turn leads to spindle formation and entry into M phase. The importance of Checkpoint kinases such as Chk1 and Chk2 is described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus other agents in development which act to disrupt the mitotic checkpoint and therefore could be combined beneficially with the compounds of the invention include polo-like kinase inhibitors (e.g. BI-2536), CHK kinase inhibitors (e.g. Irofulven (a CHK2 inhibitor), 7-hydroxystaurosporine (UCN-01, an inhibitor of both CHK1 and PKC) and PD-321852), inhibitors of the BUB kinase family, and kinesin inhibitors (also known as mitotic kinesin spindle protein (KSP) inhibitors) such as CK0106023, CK-0060339 and SB-743921 (structures shown below).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCK0106023, CK-0060339 and SB-743921 can be prepared and used as described in WO 01/30768 and WO 01/98278 and processes analogous thereto.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCHK kinase inhibitors include irofulven, UCN-01 and PD-321852.

DNA Repair Inhibitors\n\n\n \n \n \nDNA repair inhibitors include PARP inhibitors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDefinition: The term “PARP inhibitor” is used herein to define compounds which inhibit or modulate the activity of the family of Poly adenosine diphosphate ribose (poly(ADP-Ribose)) nuclear enzymes, including the ionic, salt, solvate, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, ester, prodrugs, isotopes and protected forms thereof (preferably the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof, and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof), as described above. They may also be referred to as “DNA repair inhibitors”.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBiological activity: PARP inhibitors have a role as chemosensitizing agents (for example by preventing DNA repair after anticancer therapy) and may have a role in enhancing overall patient response to anti-cancer treatments. PARP inhibitors may also act in isolation as anti cancer agents in patients whose tumours have intrinsic deficiencies in DNA repair.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTechnical background: The PARP enzyme synthesizes poly(ADP-ribose), a branched polymer that can consists of over 200 ADP-ribose units. The protein acceptors of poly(ADP-ribose) are directly or indirectly involved in maintaining DNA integrity. They include histones, topoisomerases, DNA and RNA polymerases, DNA ligases, and \nCa\n 2′- and \nMg\n 2, -dependent endonucleases. PARP protein is expressed at a high level in many tissues, most notably in the immune system, heart, brain and germ-line cells. Under normal physiological conditions, there is minimal PARP activity. However, DNA damage causes an immediate activation of PARP by up to 500-fold.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPARP is activated by damaged DNA fragments and, once activated, catalyzes the attachment of up to 100 ADP-ribose units to a variety of nuclear proteins, including histones and PARP itself. It is also known that PARP inhibitors, such as 3-amino benzamide, affect overall DNA repair in response, for example, to hydrogen peroxide or ionizing radiation. The pivotal role of PARP in the repair of DNA strand breaks is well established, especially when caused directly by ionizing radiation or, indirectly after enzymatic repair of DNA lesions induced by methylating agents, especially temozolamide, topoisomerases I inhibitors and other chemotherapeutic agents as cisplatin and bleomycin. A variety of studies using knockout mice, trans-dominant inhibition models (over-expression of the DNA-binding domain), antisense and small molecular weight inhibitors have demonstrated the role of PARP in repair and cell survival after induction of DNA damage. The inhibition of PARP enzymatic activity should lead to an enhanced sensitivity of tumor cells towards DNA damaging treatments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPARP inhibitors have been reported to be effective in radiosensitizing (hypoxic) tumor cells and effective in preventing tumor cells from recovering from potentially lethal and sublethal damage of DNA after radiation therapy, presumably by their ability to prevent DNA strand break rejoining and by affecting several DNA damage signaling pathways. PARP inhibitors have been used to treat cancer. A recent comprehensive review of the state of the art has been published by Li and Zhang in IDrugs 2001, 4(7): 804.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferences and specific embodiments: Preferred PARP inhibitors for use in accordance with the invention are selected from Bendamustine (5-[Bis(2-chloroethyl)amino]-1-methyl-2-benzimidazolebutyric acid or α-[1-Methyl-5-[bis(beta.-chloroethyl)amino]-2-benzimidazolyl]butyric acid), available from Bayer, INO-1001 (Pardex) from Inotek Pharmaceuticals, BSI-201 from BiPar Sciences, AG-014699 from Pfizer, and ONO-2231 (N-[3-(3,4-dihydro-4-oxo-1-phthalazinyl)phenyl]-4-morpholinebutanamide methanesulfonate) from Ono Pharmaceutical.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPosology: The PARP inhibitors are advantageously administered in daily dosages of 20-100 mg, for example 80-120 mg/m2 iv over a 30 to 60 min infusion over a 21 day cycle for Bendamustine.

Particular examples of such agents include anti-emetic agents and agents that prevent or decrease the duration of chemotherapy-associated neutropenia and prevent complications that arise from reduced levels of red blood cells or white blood cells, for example erythropoietin (EPO), granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, the present invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions, as defined above, and methods of making a pharmaceutical composition comprising admixing at a compound of the formula (I) or (I′) or 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea or all salts thereof such as the lactate or citrate salt, as defined above, together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, buffers, adjuvants, stabilizers, or other materials, as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable” as used herein pertains to compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of a subject (e.g. human) without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. Each carrier, excipient, etc. must also be “acceptable” in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, in a further aspect, the invention provides combinations comprising the lactate or citrate salt or mixtures thereof of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea as defined herein in the form of pharmaceutical compositions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions can be in any form suitable for oral, parenteral, topical, intranasal, ophthalmic, otic, rectal, intra-vaginal, or transdermal administration. Where the compositions are intended for parenteral administration, they can be formulated for intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous administration or for direct delivery into a target organ or tissue by injection, infusion or other means of delivery. The delivery can be by bolus injection, short term infusion or longer term infusion and can be via passive delivery or through the utilisation of a suitable infusion pump.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical formulations adapted for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. Examples of these are described in R. G. Strickly, Solubilizing Excipients in oral and injectable formulations, Pharmaceutical Research, Vol 21(2) 2004, p 201-230. In addition, they may contain co-solvents, organic solvent mixtures, cyclodextrin complexation agents, emulsifying agents (for forming and stabilizing emulsion formulations), liposome components for forming liposomes, gellable polymers for forming polymeric gels, lyophilisation protectants and combinations of agents for, inter alia, stabilising the active ingredient in a soluble form and rendering the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient. The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injections, immediately prior to use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA drug molecule that is ionizable can be solubilized to the desired concentration by pH adjustment if the drug's pKa is sufficiently away from the formulation pH value. The acceptable range is pH 2-12 for intravenous and intramuscular administration, but subcutaneously the range is pH 2.7-9.0. The solution pH is controlled by either the salt form of the drug, strong acids/bases such as hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide, or by solutions of buffers which include but are not limited to buffering solutions formed from glycine, citrate, acetate, maleate, succinate, histidine, phosphate, tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (IRIS), or carbonate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe combination of an aqueous solution and a water-soluble organic solvent/surfactant (i.e., a cosolvent) is often used in injectable formulations. The water-soluble organic solvents and surfactants used in injectable formulations include but are not limited to propylene glycol, ethanol, \npolyethylene glycol\n 300, polyethylene glycol 400, glycerin, dimethylacetamide (DMA), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP; Pharmasolve), dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO), Solutol HS15, Cremophor EL, \nCremophor RH\n 60, and \npolysorbate\n 80. Such formulations can usually be, but are not always, diluted prior to injection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPropylene glycol, \nPEG\n 300, ethanol, Cremophor EL, \nCremophor RH\n 60, and \npolysorbate\n 80 are the entirely organic water-miscible solvents and surfactants used in commercially available injectable formulations and can be used in combinations with each other. The resulting organic formulations are usually diluted at least 2-fold prior to IV bolus or IV infusion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively increased water solubility can be achieved through molecular complexation with cyclodextrins\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiposomes are closed spherical vesicles composed of outer lipid bilayer membranes and an inner aqueous core and with an overall diameter of <100 μm. Depending on the level of hydrophobicity, moderately hydrophobic drugs can be solubilized by liposomes if the drug becomes encapsulated or intercalated within the liposome. Hydrophobic drugs can also be solubilized by liposomes if the drug molecule becomes an integral part of the lipid bilayer membrane, and in this case, the hydrophobic drug is dissolved in the lipid portion of the lipid bilayer. A typical liposome formulation contains water with phospholipid at 5-20 mg/ml, an isotonicifiers, a pH 5-8 buffer, and optionally cholesterol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilised) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injections, immediately prior to use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical formulation can be prepared by lyophilising a compound of the formula (I) or 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea or all salts thereof such as the lactate or citrate salt thereof as defined herein. Lyophilisation refers to the procedure of freeze-drying a composition. Freeze-drying and lyophilisation are therefore used herein as synonyms. A typical process is to solubilise the compound and the resulting formulation is clarified, sterile filtered and aseptically transferred to containers appropriate for lyophilisation (e.g. vials). In the case of vials, they are partially stoppered with lyo-stoppers. The formulation can be cooled to freezing and subjected to lyophilisation under standard conditions and then hermetically capped forming a stable, dry lyophile formulation. The composition will typically have a low residual water content, e.g. less than 5% e.g. less than 1% by weight based on weight of the lyophile.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe lyophilisation formulation may contain other excipients for example, thickening agents, dispersing agents, buffers, antioxidants, preservatives, and tonicity adjusters. Typical buffers include phosphate, acetate, citrate and glycine. Examples of antioxidants include ascorbic acid, sodium bisulphite, sodium metabisulphite, monothioglycerol, thiourea, butylated hydroxytoluene, butylated hydroxyl anisole, and ethylenediamietetraacetic acid salts. Preservatives may include benzoic acid and its salts, sorbic acid and its salts, alkyl esters of para-hydroxybenzoic acid, phenol, chlorobutanol, benzyl alcohol, thimerosal, benzalkonium chloride and cetylpyridinium chloride. The buffers mentioned previously, as well as dextrose and sodium chloride, can be used for tonicity adjustment if necessary.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBulking agents are generally used in lyophilisation technology for facilitating the process and/or providing bulk and/or mechanical integrity to the lyophilized cake. Bulking agent means a freely water soluble, solid particulate diluent that when co-lyophilised with the compound or salt thereof, provides a physically stable lyophilized cake, a more optimal freeze-drying process and rapid and complete reconstitution. The bulking agent may also be utilised to make the solution isotonic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe water-soluble bulking agent can be any of the pharmaceutically acceptable inert solid materials typically used for lyophilisation. Such bulking agents include, for example, sugars such as glucose, maltose, sucrose, and lactose; polyalcohols such as sorbitol or mannitol; amino acids such as glycine; polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidine; and polysaccharides such as dextran.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ratio of the weight of the bulking agent to the weight of active compound is typically within the range from about 1 to about 5, for example of about 1 to about 3, e.g. in the range of about 1 to 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively they can be provided in a solution form which may be concentrated and sealed in a suitable vial. Sterilisation of dosage forms may be via filtration or by autoclaving of the vials and their contents at appropriate stages of the formulation process. The supplied formulation may require further dilution or preparation before delivery for example dilution into suitable sterile infusion packs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExtemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions of the present invention for parenteral injection can also comprise pharmaceutically acceptable sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions as well as sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use. Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers, diluents, solvents or vehicles include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), carboxymethylcellulose and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils (such as olive oil), and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions of the present invention may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms may be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf a compound not stable in aqueous media or has low solubility in aqueous media it can be formulated as a concentrate in organic solvents. The concentrate can then be diluted to a lower concentration in an aqueous system, and can be sufficiently stable for the short period of time during dosing. Therefore in another aspect, there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising a non aqueous solution composed entirely of one or more organic solvents, which can be dosed as is or more commonly diluted with a suitable IV excipient (saline, dextrose; buffered or not buffered) before administration (Solubilizing excipients in oral and injectable formulations, Pharmaceutical Research, 21(2), 2004, p201-230). Examples of solvents and surfactants are propylene glycol, PEG300, PEG400, ethanol, dimethylacetamide (DMA), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP, Pharmasolve), Glycerin, Cremophor EL, \nCremophor RH\n 60 and polysorbate. Particular non aqueous solutions are composed of 70-80% propylene glycol, and 20-30% ethanol. One particular non aqueous solution is composed of 70% propylene glycol, and 30% ethanol. Another is 80% propylene glycol and 20% ethanol. Normally these solvents are used in combination and usually diluted at least 2-fold before IV bolus or IV infusion. The typical amounts for bolus IV formulations are ˜50% for Glycerin, propylene glycol, PEG300, PEG400, and ˜20% for ethanol. The typical amounts for IV infusion formulations are ˜15% for Glycerin, 3% for DMA, and ˜10% for propylene glycol, PEG300, PEG400 and ethanol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one preferred embodiment of the invention, the pharmaceutical composition is in a form suitable for i.v. administration, for example by injection or infusion. For intravenous administration, the solution can be dosed as is, or can be injected into an infusion bag (containing a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, such as 0.9% saline or 5% dextrose), before administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another preferred embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition is in a form suitable for sub-cutaneous (s.c.) administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical dosage forms suitable for oral administration include tablets, capsules, caplets, pills, lozenges, syrups, solutions, powders, granules, elixirs and suspensions, sublingual tablets, wafers or patches and buccal patches.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions containing a compound of the formula (I) or 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea or all salts thereof such as the lactate or citrate salt can be formulated in accordance with known techniques, see for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., USA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, tablet compositions can contain a unit dosage of active compound together with an inert diluent or carrier such as a sugar or sugar alcohol, eg; lactose, sucrose, sorbitol or mannitol; and/or a non-sugar derived diluent such as sodium carbonate, calcium phosphate, calcium carbonate, or a cellulose or derivative thereof such as methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, and starches such as corn starch. Tablets may also contain such standard ingredients as binding and granulating agents such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, disintegrants (e.g. swellable crosslinked polymers such as crosslinked carboxymethylcellulose), lubricating agents (e.g. stearates), preservatives (e.g. parabens), antioxidants (e.g. BHT), buffering agents (for example phosphate or citrate buffers), and effervescent agents such as citrate/bicarbonate mixtures. Such excipients are well known and do not need to be discussed in detail here.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCapsule formulations may be of the hard gelatin or soft gelatin variety and can contain the active component in solid, semi-solid, or liquid form. Gelatin capsules can be formed from animal gelatin or synthetic or plant derived equivalents thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe solid dosage forms (e.g.; tablets, capsules etc.) can be coated or un-coated, but typically have a coating, for example a protective film coating (e.g. a wax or varnish) or a release controlling coating. The coating (e.g. a Eudragit™ type polymer) can be designed to release the active component at a desired location within the gastro-intestinal tract. Thus, the coating can be selected so as to degrade under certain pH conditions within the gastrointestinal tract, thereby selectively release the compound in the stomach or in the ileum or duodenum.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInstead of, or in addition to, a coating, the drug can be presented in a solid matrix comprising a release controlling agent, for example a release delaying agent which may be adapted to selectively release the compound under conditions of varying acidity or alkalinity in the gastrointestinal tract. Alternatively, the matrix material or release retarding coating can take the form of an erodible polymer (e.g. a maleic anhydride polymer) which is substantially continuously eroded as the dosage form passes through the gastrointestinal tract. As a further alternative, the active compound can be formulated in a delivery system that provides osmotic control of the release of the compound. Osmotic release and other delayed release or sustained release formulations may be prepared in accordance with methods well known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions comprise from approximately 1% to approximately 95%, preferably from approximately 20% to approximately 90%, active ingredient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions according to the invention may be, for example, in unit dose form, such as in the form of ampoules, vials, suppositories, dragées, tablets or capsules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions for oral administration can be obtained by combining the active ingredient with solid carriers, if desired granulating a resulting mixture, and processing the mixture, if desired or necessary, after the addition of appropriate excipients, into tablets, dragee cores or capsules. It is also possible for them to be incorporated into plastics carriers that allow the active ingredients to diffuse or be released in measured amounts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions for topical use include ointments, creams, sprays, patches, gels, liquid drops and inserts (for example intraocular inserts). Such compositions can be formulated in accordance with known methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions for parenteral administration are typically presented as sterile aqueous or oily solutions or fine suspensions, or may be provided in finely divided sterile powder form for making up extemporaneously with sterile water for injection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of formulations for rectal or intra-vaginal administration include pessaries and suppositories which may be, for example, formed from a shaped moldable or waxy material containing the active compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions for administration by inhalation may take the form of inhalable powder compositions or liquid or powder sprays, and can be administrated in standard form using powder inhaler devices or aerosol dispensing devices. Such devices are well known. For administration by inhalation, the powdered formulations typically comprise the active compound together with an inert solid powdered diluent such as lactose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical formulations may be presented to a patient in “patient packs” containing an entire course of treatment in a single package, usually a blister pack. Patient packs have an advantage over traditional prescriptions, where a pharmacist divides a patient's supply of a pharmaceutical from a bulk supply, in that the patient always has access to the package insert contained in the patient pack, normally missing in patient prescriptions. The inclusion of a package insert has been shown to improve patient compliance with the physician's instructions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe combination or its constituent components (e.g. the compound of the formula (I′″) or 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea or all salts thereof such as the lactate or citrate salt) will generally be presented in unit dosage form and, as such, will typically contain sufficient compound to provide a desired level of biological activity. For example, a formulation intended for oral administration may contain from 0.1 milligrams to 2 grams of active ingredient, or 1 nanogram to 2 milligrams of active ingredient. Within this range, particular sub-ranges of compound are 0.1 milligrams to 2 grams of active ingredient (more usually from 10 milligrams to 1 gram, for example, 50 milligrams to 500 milligrams or 1 microgram to 20 milligrams (for example 1 microgram to 10 milligrams, e.g. 0.1 milligrams to 2 milligrams of active ingredient).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor oral compositions, a unit dosage form may contain from 1 milligram to 2 grams, more typically 10 milligrams to 1 gram, for example 50 milligrams to 1 gram, e.g. 100 milligrams to 1 gram, of active compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe active compound will be administered to a patient in need thereof (for example a human or animal patient) in an amount sufficient to achieve the desired therapeutic effect.\n\n\n \nMethods of Treatment\n\n\n \n \n \nThe combinations of the invention will be useful in the prophylaxis or treatment of a range of disease states or conditions mediated by cyclin dependent kinases, glycogen synthase kinase-3 and Aurora kinases. Examples of such disease states and conditions are set out above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe combination is generally administered to a subject in need of such administration, for example a human or animal patient, preferably a human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe combination will typically be administered in amounts that are therapeutically or prophylactically useful and which generally are non-toxic. However, in certain situations (for example in the case of life threatening diseases), the benefits of administering a combination of the invention may outweigh the disadvantages of any toxic effects or side effects, in which case it may be considered desirable to administer the combination in amounts that are associated with a degree of toxicity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe constituent compounds of the combinations of the invention may be administered over a prolonged term to maintain beneficial therapeutic effects or may be administered for a short period only. Alternatively they may be administered in a pulsatile or continuous manner.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA typical daily dose of the compound of formula (I) or (I′) present in the combination can be in the range from 100 picograms to 100 milligrams per kilogram of body weight, more typically 5 nanograms to 25 milligrams per kilogram of bodyweight, and more usually 10 nanograms to 15 milligrams per kilogram (e.g. 10 nanograms to 10 milligrams, and more typically 1 microgram per kilogram to 20 milligrams per kilogram, such as 1 micrograms to 10 milligrams) per kilogram of bodyweight although higher or lower doses may be administered where required. The compound can be administered on a daily basis or on a repeat basis every 2, or 3, or 4, or 5, or 6, or 7, or 10 or 14, or 21, or 28 days for example.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe constituent compounds of the combinations of the invention may be administered orally in a range of doses, for example 1 to 1500 mg, 2 to 800 mg, or 5 to 500 mg, e.g. 2 to 200 mg or 10 to 1000 mg, particular examples of doses including 10, 20, 50 and 80 mg.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds may be administered once or more than once each day. The compounds can be administered continuously (i.e. taken every day without a break for the duration of the treatment regimen). Alternatively, the compounds can be administered intermittently, i.e. taken continuously for a given period such as a week, then discontinued for a period such as a week and then taken continuously for another period such as a week and so on throughout the duration of the treatment regimen. Examples of treatment regimens involving intermittent administration include regimens wherein administration is in cycles of one week on, one week off; or two weeks on, one week off; or three weeks on, one week off; or two weeks on, two weeks off; or four weeks on two weeks off; or one week on three weeks off—for one or more cycles, e.g. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 or more cycles.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn example of a daily dose of the compound comprises administering a compound of the formula (I) or (I′) as defined herein, for example the lactate salt of compound I at a starting dosage of 1 mg/m\n2\n/day-100 mg/m\n2\n/day, in particular 1 mg/m\n2\n/day-10 mg/m\n2\n/day more particularly 3-6 mg/m\n2\n/day (equivalent to 2.5-5 mg free base/m\n2\n/day) or at an efficacious dose of the lactate salt of compound I of 2.5 mg/m\n2\n/day-1.5 g/m\n2\n/day, in particular 25 mg/m\n2\n/day-600 mg/m\n2\n/day, more particularly 200-500 mg/m\n2\n/day such as 250 mg/m\n2\n/day or 45-200 mg/m\n2\n/day such as 45-150 mg/m\n2\n/day or 56-185 mg/m\n2\n/day (equivalent to 45-150 mg free base/m\n2\n/day) although higher or lower doses may be administered where required.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one particular dosing schedule, a patient will be given a continuous IV infusion of the compound or a salt thereof, for example the compound of formula (I), for periods of 2 hour to 120 hour, for example 2 to 96 hour in particular for 24 to 72 hour and the treatment repeated at a desired interval such as every one to three weeks.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore particularly, a patient may be given a continuous IV infusion of the compound or a salt thereof for periods of 24 hour daily for 5 days and the treatment repeated every week, or for periods of 24 hour and the treatment repeated every week, or for periods of 48 hour and the treatment repeated every two weeks or for periods of 72 hour and the treatment repeated every three weeks.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another particular dosing schedule, a patient is given an infusion of the compound as an IV bolus over 2 hour once a day for a week every 1, 2, or 3 weeks or over 2 hour once every 1, 2, or 3 weeks.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHigher doses such as 1.5 g/m\n2\n/day could be administered using a dosing regimen with frequent off-treatment periods such as 24 to 48 hour continuous IV fusion every one to two weeks. Lower dosages such could be administered using a dosing regimens with more sustained dosing (but still cyclical on/off) such as 48 to 72 hour continuous IV fusion every two to three weeks.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular, compounds of the formula (I′) or 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea or all salts thereof such as the lactate or citrate salt in particular the lactate salt could be administered to a patient at 250 mg/m\n2\n/day for 72 hours by continuous IV infusion every 3 weeks.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, compounds of the formula (I′) or 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea or all salts thereof such as the lactate or citrate salt in particular the lactate salt could be administered to a patient over a five day treatment cycle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUltimately, the quantity of compound administered, dosing regimen and type of composition used will be commensurate with the nature of the disease or physiological condition being treated and will be at the discretion of the physician.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, a person skilled in the art would know through their common general knowledge the dosing regimes and combination therapies to use. It will be appreciated that the preferred method and order of administration and the respective dosage amounts and regimes for each component of the combination will depend on the particular compounds of formula (I′) and two or more further anti-cancer agents being administered, their route of administration, the particular tumour being treated and the particular host being treated. The optimum method and order of administration and dosage amounts and regime can be readily determined by those skilled in the art using conventional methods and in view of the information set out herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe combinations of the invention as defined herein can be further combined and/or administered with one of more other compounds for treatment of a particular disease state, for example a neoplastic disease such as a cancer as hereinbefore defined. Examples of other therapeutic agents or treatments that may be administered together (whether concurrently or at different time intervals) with the combinations of the invention include but are not limited to:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nTopoisomerase I inhibitors\n \nAntimetabolites\n \nTubulin targeting agents\n \nDNA binder and topoisomerase II inhibitors\n \nAlkylating Agents\n \nMonoclonal Antibodies.\n \nAnti-Hormones\n \nSignal Transduction Inhibitors\n \nProteasome Inhibitors\n \nDNA methyl transferases\n \nCytokines and retinoids\n \nChromatin targeted therapies\n \nRadiotherapy, and,\n \nOther therapeutic or prophylactic agents; for example agents that reduce or alleviate some of the side effects associated with chemotherapy. Particular examples of such agents include anti-emetic agents and agents that prevent or decrease the duration of chemotherapy-associated neutropenia and prevent complications that arise from reduced levels of red blood cells or white blood cells, for example erythropoietin (EPO), granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). Also included are agents that inhibit bone resorption such as bisphosphonate agents e.g. zoledronate, pamidronate and ibandronate, agents that suppress inflammatory responses (such as dexamethazone, prednisone, and prednisolone) and agents used to reduce blood levels of growth hormone and IGF-I in acromegaly patients such as synthetic forms of the brain hormone somatostatin, which includes octreotide acetate which is a long-acting octapeptide with pharmacologic properties mimicking those of the natural hormone somatostatin. Further included are agents such as leucovorin, which is used as an antidote to drugs that decrease levels of folic acid, or folinic acid it self and agents such as megestrol acetate which can be used for the treatment of side-effects including oedema and thromoembolic episodes.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nEach of the compounds present in the combinations of the invention may be given in individually varying dose schedules and via different routes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound of the formula (I) and ancillary compound may be simultaneously or sequentially. When administered sequentially, they can be administered at closely spaced intervals (for example over a period of 5-10 minutes) or at longer intervals (for example 1, 2, 3, 4 or more hours apart, or even longer periods apart where required), the precise dosage regimen being commensurate with the properties of the therapeutic agent(s).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe combinations of the invention may also be administered in conjunction with non-chemotherapeutic treatments such as radiotherapy, photodynamic therapy, gene therapy; surgery and controlled diets.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor use in combination therapy with an ancillary compound, the compound of the formula (I) and one, two, three, four or more ancillary compounds can be, for example, formulated together in a dosage form containing two, three, four or more ancillary compounds. In an alternative, the constituent compounds of the combination of the invention may be formulated separately and presented together in the form of a kit, optionally with instructions for their use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA person skilled in the art would know through his or her common general knowledge the dosing regimes and combination therapies to use.\n\n\n \nMethods of Diagnosis\n\n\n \n \n \nPrior to administration of the combination of the invention, a patient may be screened to determine whether a disease or condition from which the patient is or may be suffering is one which would be susceptible to treatment with a compound having activity against Aurora and/or cyclin dependent kinases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, a biological sample taken from a patient may be analysed to determine whether a condition or disease, such as cancer, that the patient is or may be suffering from is one which is characterised by a genetic abnormality or abnormal protein expression which leads to over-activation of CDKs or to sensitisation of a pathway to normal CDK activity. Examples of such abnormalities that result in activation or sensitisation of the CDK2 signal include up-regulation of cyclin E, (Harwell R M, Mull B B, Porter D C, Keyomarsi K.; J Biol. Chem. 2004 Mar. 26; 279(13):12695-705) or loss of p21 or p27, or presence of CDC4 variants (Rajagopalan H, Jallepalli P V, Rago C, Velculescu V E, Kinzler K W, Vogelstein B, Lengauer C.; Nature. 2004 Mar. 4; 428(6978):77-81). Tumours with mutants of CDC4 or up-regulation, in particular over-expression, of cyclin E or loss of p21 or p27 may be particularly sensitive to CDK inhibitors. Alternatively or in addition, a biological sample taken from a patient may be analysed to determine whether a condition or disease, such as cancer, that the patient is or may be suffering from is one which is characterised by upregulation of Aurora kinase and thus may be particularly sensitive to Aurora inhibitors. The term up-regulation includes elevated expression or over-expression, including gene amplification (i.e. multiple gene copies) and increased expression by a transcriptional effect, and hyperactivity and activation, including activation by mutations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, the patient may be subjected to a diagnostic test to detect a marker characteristic of over-expression, up-regulation or activation of Aurora kinase or the patient may be subjected to a diagnostic test to detect a marker characteristic of up-regulation of cyclin E, or loss of p21 or p27, or presence of CDC4 variants. The term diagnosis includes screening. By marker we include genetic markers including, for example, the measurement of DNA composition to identify mutations of Aurora or CDC4. The term marker also includes markers which are characteristic of up regulation of Aurora or cyclin E, including enzyme activity, enzyme levels, enzyme state (e.g. phosphorylated or not) and mRNA levels of the aforementioned proteins. Tumours with upregulation of cyclin E, or loss of p21 or p27 may be particularly sensitive to CDK inhibitors. Tumours may preferentially be screened for upregulation of cyclin E, or loss of p21 or p27 prior to treatment. Thus, the patient may be subjected to a diagnostic test to detect a marker characteristic of up-regulation of cyclin E, or loss of p21 or p27.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe diagnostic tests are typically conducted on a biological sample selected from tumour biopsy samples, blood samples (isolation and enrichment of shed tumour cells), stool biopsies, sputum, chromosome analysis, pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, or urine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt has been found, see Ewart-Toland et al., (Nat. Genet. 2003 August; 34(4):403-12), that individuals forming part of the sub-population possessing the Ile31 variant of the STK gene (the gene for Aurora kinase A) may have an increased susceptibility to certain forms of cancer. Therefore, such individuals suffering from cancer will benefit from the administration of compounds having Aurora kinase inhibiting activity. A patient suffering from, or suspected of suffering from, a cancer may therefore be screened to determine whether he or she forms part of the Ile31 variant sub-population. In addition, it has been found, Rajagopalan et al (Nature. 2004 Mar. 4; 428(6978):77-81), that there were mutations present in CDC4 (also known as Fbw7 or Archipelago) in human colorectal cancers and endometrial cancers (Spruck et al, Cancer Res. 2002 Aug. 15; 62(16):4535-9). Identification of individual carrying a mutation in CDC4 may mean that the patient would be particularly suitable for treatment with a CDK inhibitor. Tumours may preferentially be screened for presence of a CDC4 variant prior to treatment. The screening process will typically involve direct sequencing, oligonucleotide microarray analysis, or a mutant specific antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTumours with activating mutants of Aurora or up-regulation of Aurora including any of the isoforms thereof, may be particularly sensitive to Aurora inhibitors. Tumours may preferentially be screened for up-regulation of Aurora or for Aurora possessing the Ile31 variant prior to treatment (Ewart-Toland et al., Nat. Genet. 2003 August; 34(4):403-12). Ewart-Toland et al identified a common genetic variant in STK15 (resulting in the amino acid substitution F31I) that is preferentially amplified and associated with the degree of aneuploidy in human colon tumors. These results are consistent with an important role for the Ile31 variant of STK15 in human cancer susceptibility. In particular, this polymorphism in Aurora A has been suggested to be a genetic modifier for developing breast carcinoma (Sun et al, Carcinogenesis, 2004, 25(11), 2225-2230).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Aurora A gene maps to the chromosome 20q13 region that is frequently amplified in many cancers e.g. breast, bladder, colon, ovarian, pancreatic. Patients with a tumour that has this gene amplification might be particularly sensitive to treatments targeting Aurora kinase inhibition\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods of identification and analysis of mutations and up-regulation of protein e.g. Aurora isoforms and chromosome 20q13 amplification are known to a person skilled in the art. Screening methods could include, but are not limited to, standard methods such as reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or in-situ hybridisation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn screening by RT-PCR, the level of mRNA in the tumour is assessed by creating a cDNA copy of the mRNA followed by amplification of the cDNA by PCR. Methods of PCR amplification, the selection of primers, and conditions for amplification, are known to a person skilled in the art. Nucleic acid manipulations and PCR are carried out by standard methods, as described for example in Ausubel, F. M. et al., eds. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, 2004, John Wiley & Sons Inc., or Innis, M. A. et-al., eds. PCR Protocols: a guide to methods and applications, 1990, Academic Press, San Diego. Reactions and manipulations involving nucleic acid techniques are also described in Sambrook et al., 2001, 3\nrd \nEd, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. Alternatively a commercially available kit for RT-PCR (for example Roche Molecular Biochemicals) may be used, or methodology as set forth in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,666,828; 4,683,202; 4,801,531; 5,192,659, 5,272,057, 5,882,864, and 6,218,529 and incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn example of an in-situ hybridisation technique for assessing mRNA expression would be fluorescence in-situ hybridisation (FISH) (see Angerer, 1987 Meth. Enzymol., 152: 649).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, in situ hybridization comprises the following major steps: (1) fixation of tissue to be analyzed; (2) prehybridization treatment of the sample to increase accessibility of target nucleic acid, and to reduce nonspecific binding; (3) hybridization of the mixture of nucleic acids to the nucleic acid in the biological structure or tissue; (4) post-hybridization washes to remove nucleic acid fragments not bound in the hybridization, and (5) detection of the hybridized nucleic acid fragments. The probes used in such applications are typically labeled, for example, with radioisotopes or fluorescent reporters. Preferred probes are sufficiently long, for example, from about 50, 100, or 200 nucleotides to about 1000 or more nucleotides, to enable specific hybridization with the target nucleic acid(s) under stringent conditions. Standard methods for carrying out FISH are described in Ausubel, F. M. et al., eds. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, 2004, John Wiley & Sons Inc and Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization: Technical Overview by John M. S. Bartlett in Molecular Diagnosis of Cancer, Methods and Protocols, 2nd ed.; ISBN: 1-59259-760-2; March 2004, pps. 077-088; Series: Methods in Molecular Medicine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the protein products expressed from the mRNAs may be assayed by immunohistochemistry of tumour samples, solid phase immunoassay with microtiter plates, Western blotting, 2-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, ELISA, flow cytometry and other methods known in the art for detection of specific proteins. Detection methods would include the use of site specific antibodies. The skilled person will recognize that all such well-known techniques for detection of upregulation of cyclin E, or loss of p21 or p27, or detection of CDC4 variants, Aurora up-regulation and mutants of Aurora could be applicable in the present case.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore, all of these techniques could also be used to identify tumours particularly suitable for treatment with the compounds of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTumours with mutants of CDC4 or up-regulation, in particular over-expression, of cyclin E or loss of p21 or p27 may be particularly sensitive to CDK inhibitors as a component of the combination of the invention. Tumours may preferentially be screened for up-regulation, in particular over-expression, of cyclin E (Harwell R M, Mull B B, Porter D C, Keyomarsi K.; J Biol. Chem. 2004 Mar. 26; 279(13):12695-705) or loss of p21 or p27 or for CDC4 variants prior to treatment (Rajagopalan H, Jallepalli P V, Rago C, Velculescu V E, Kinzler K W, Vogelstein B, Lengauer C.; Nature. 2004 Mar. 4; 428(6978):77-81).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPatients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) could be selected for treatment with a compound of the invention using diagnostic tests outlined herein. MCL is a distinct clinicopathologic entity of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, characterized by proliferation of small to medium-sized lymphocytes with co-expression of CD5 and CD20, an aggressive and incurable clinical course, and frequent t(11; 14)(q13; q32) translocation. Over-expression of cyclin D1 mRNA, found in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), is a critical diagnostic marker. Yatabe et at (Blood. 2000 Apr. 1; 95(7):2253-61) proposed that cyclin D1-positively should be included as one of the standard criteria for MCL, and that innovative therapies for this incurable disease should be explored on the basis of the new criteria. Jones et al (J Mol Diagn. 2004 May; 6(2):84-9) developed a real-time, quantitative, reverse transcription PCR assay for cyclin D1 (CCND1) expression to aid in the diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Howe et al (Clin Chem. 2004 January; 50(1):80-7) used real-time quantitative RT-PCR to evaluate cyclin D1 mRNA expression and found that quantitative RT-PCR for cyclin D1 mRNA normalized to CD19 mRNA can be used in the diagnosis of MCL in blood, marrow, and tissue. Alternatively, patients with breast cancer could be selected for treatment with a combination of the invention using diagnostic tests outline above. Tumour cells commonly overexpress cyclin E and it has been shown that cyclin E is over-expressed in breast cancer (Harwell et al, Cancer Res, 2000, 60, 481-489). Therefore breast cancer may in particular be treated with a CDK inhibitor as provided herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrior to administration of the combination of the invention, a patient may be screened to determine whether a disease or condition from which the patient is or may be suffering is:\n\n \n \n \nA. a disease state or condition mediated by a kinase which is BCR-abl, VEGFR, PDGFR, EGFR, Flt3, JAK (e.g. JAK2 or JAK3), C-abl, PDK1, Chk (e.g. Chk1 or Chk2), FGFR (e.g. FGFR3), Ret, Eph (e.g. EphB2 or EphB4), or Src (e.g. cSrc); or\n \nB. a cancer in which the cancer cells thereof contain a drug resistant kinase mutation which is:\n    \n \n(a) a threonine gatekeeper mutation; or\n \n(b) a drug-resistant gatekeeper mutation; or\n \n(c) an imatinib resistant mutation; or\n \n(d) a nilotinib resistant mutation; or\n \n(e) a dasatinib resistant mutation; or\n \n(f) a T670I mutation in KIT; or\n \n(g) a T674I mutation in PDGFR; or\n \n(h) T790M mutation in EGFR; or\n \n(i) a T315I mutation in abl; or\n \n\n\n \nC. a cancer which expresses a mutated molecular target which is a mutated form of BCRabl, c-kit, PDGF, EGF receptor or ErbB2; or\n \nD. a disease mediated by a kinase containing a mutation in a region of the protein that binds to or interacts with other cancer agents but does not bind to or interact with the compounds of formula (I) or (I′), for example a mutated kinase selected from c-abl, c-kit, PDGFR including PDGFR-beta and PDGFR-alpha, and ErbB family members such as EGFR (ErbB1), HER2 (ErbB2), ErbB3, and ErbB4, members of the Ephrin receptor family including EphA1, EphA2, EphA3, EphA4, EphA5, EphA8, EphA10, EphB1, EphB2, EphB3, EphB5, EphB6, c-Src and kinases of the JAK family such as TYK2;\n\n\nand is a disease state or condition which would be susceptible to treatment with a combination of the invention.\n\n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn a particular embodiment, prior to administration of a combination of the invention, a patient may be screened to determine whether a disease or condition from which the patient is or may be suffering is one which would be susceptible to treatment with a combination of the invention having activity against BCR-abl, VEGFR, PDGFR, EGFR, Flt3, JAK (e.g. JAK2 or JAK3), C-abl, PDK1, Chk (e.g. Chk1 or Chk2), FGFR (e.g. FGFR3), Ret, Eph (e.g. EphB2 or EphB4), or Src (e.g. cSrc) or a mutated form thereof as defined herein, and in particular C-abl and JAK kinases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA biological sample taken from a patient may be analysed to determine whether a condition or disease, such as cancer, that the patient is or may be suffering from is one which is characterised by a genetic abnormality (e.g. contains a mutated form of a kinase as described above) or abnormal protein expression which leads to over-activation of a kinase or to sensitisation of a pathway to normal kinase activity. Alternatively or in addition, a biological sample taken from a patient may be analysed to determine whether a condition or disease, such as cancer, that the patient is or may be suffering from is one which is characterised by upregulation of a particular kinase and thus may be particularly sensitive to an inhibitor of that kinase. The term up-regulation includes elevated expression or over-expression, including gene amplification (i.e. multiple gene copies) and increased expression by a transcriptional effect, and hyperactivity and activation, including activation by mutations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the case of the kinases BCR-abl, VEGFR, PDGFR, EGFR, Flt3, JAK (e.g. JAK2 or JAK3), C-abl, PDK1, Chk (e.g. Chk1 or Chk2), FGFR (e.g. FGFR3), Ret, Eph (e.g. EphB2 or EphB4), or Src (e.g. cSrc) or a mutated form thereof as defined herein, a biological sample taken from a patient may be analysed to determine whether a condition or disease, such as cancer, that the patient is or may be suffering from is one which is characterised by a genetic abnormality or abnormal protein expression which leads to up-regulation of the levels or activity of the kinase or to sensitisation of a pathway to normal kinase activity, or to upregulation of the kinase signalling pathways such as kinase ligand levels or kinase ligand activity or to upregulation of a biochemical pathway downstream of kinase activation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of such abnormalities that result in activation or sensitisation of the kinase signal include loss of, or inhibition of apoptotic pathways, up-regulation of the receptors or ligands, or presence of mutant variants of the receptors or ligands e.g PTK variants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTumours with mutants of FGFR1, FGFR2 or FGFR3 or up-regulation, in particular over-expression of FGFR1, or gain-of-function mutants of FGFR2 or FGFR3 may be particularly sensitive to FGFR inhibitors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, point mutations engendering gain-of-function in FGFR2 have been identified in a number of conditions (Lemonnier, et al., J. Bone Miner. Res., 16, 832-845 (2001)). In addition, genetic aberrations of the FGFR3 receptor tyrosine kinase such as chromosomal translocations or point mutations resulting in ectopically expressed or deregulated, constitutively active, FGFR3 receptors have been identified and are linked to a subset of multiple myelomas, bladder and cervical carcinomas (Powers, C. J., et al., Endocr. Rel. Cancer, 7, 165 (2000)). A particular mutation T674I of the PDGF receptor has been identified in imatinib-treated patients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, a gene amplification of 8p12-p11.2 was demonstrated in ˜50% of lobular breast cancer (CLC) cases and this was shown to be linked with an increased expression of FGFR1. Preliminary studies with siRNA directed against FGFR1, or a small molecule inhibitor of the receptor, showed cell lines harbouring this amplification to be particularly sensitive to inhibition of this signalling pathway (Reis-Filho et al. Clin Cancer Res. 2006 12(22): 6652-6662.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, a biological sample taken from a patient may be analysed for loss of a negative regulator or suppressor of a particular kinase (e.g. BCR-abl, VEGFR, PDGFR, EGFR, Flt3, JAK (e.g. JAK2 or JAK3), C-abl, PDK1, Chk (e.g. Chk1 or Chk2), FGFR (e.g. FGFR3), Ret, Eph (e.g. EphB2 or EphB4), or Src (e.g. cSrc) or a mutated form thereof as defined herein, and in particular C-abl and JAK kinases). In the present context, the term “loss” embraces the deletion of a gene encoding the regulator or suppressor, the truncation of the gene (for example by mutation), the truncation of the transcribed product of the gene, or the inactivation of the transcribed product (e.g. by point mutation) or sequestration by another gene product.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, the patient may be subjected to a diagnostic test to detect a marker characteristic of over-expression, up-regulation or activation of a kinase. The term diagnosis includes screening. By marker we include genetic markers including, for example, the measurement of DNA composition to identify mutations of a particular kinase. The term marker also includes markers which are characteristic of up regulation of the activity of a kinase, including enzyme activity, enzyme levels, enzyme state (e.g. phosphorylated or not) and mRNA levels of the aforementioned proteins. The term up-regulation includes elevated expression or over-expression, including gene amplification (i.e. multiple gene copies) and increased expression by a transcriptional effect, and hyperactivity and activation, including activation by mutations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe diagnostic tests are typically conducted on a biological sample selected from tumour biopsy samples, blood samples (isolation and enrichment of shed tumour cells), stool biopsies, sputum, chromosome analysis, pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, buccal spears, biopsy or urine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore specifically, the patient may be subjected to a diagnostic test to detect a marker characteristic of up-regulation of BCR-abl, VEGFR, PDGFR, EGFR, Flt3, JAK (e.g. JAK2 or JAK3), C-abl, PDK1, Chk (e.g. Chk1 or Chk2), FGFR (e.g. FGFR3), Ret, Eph (e.g. EphB2 or EphB4), or Src (e.g. cSrc) or a mutated form thereof as defined herein, and in particular C-abl and JAK kinases. The term diagnosis includes screening. By marker we include genetic markers including, for example, the measurement of DNA composition to identify mutations of the kinases. The term marker also includes markers which are characteristic of up regulation of the kinases including enzyme activity, enzyme levels, enzyme state (e.g. phosphorylated or not) and mRNA levels of the aforementioned proteins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods of identification and analysis of mutations and up-regulation of proteins are known to a person skilled in the art. Screening methods could include, but are not limited to, standard methods such as reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or in-situ hybridization such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIdentification of an individual carrying a mutation in a kinase such as BCR-abl, VEGFR, PDGFR, EGFR, Flt3, JAK (e.g. JAK2 or JAK3), C-abl, PDK1, Chk (e.g. Chk1 or Chk2), FGFR (e.g. FGFR3), Ret, Eph (e.g. EphB2 or EphB4), or Src (e.g. cSrc) or a mutated form thereof as defined herein, and in particular C-abl and JAK kinases may mean that the patient would be particularly suitable for treatment with an inhibitor of the kinase in question. Tumours may preferentially be screened for presence of a kinase variant prior to treatment. The screening process will typically involve direct sequencing, oligonucleotide microarray analysis, or a mutant specific antibody or by using the RT-PCR and FISH techniques described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, mutant forms of, for example a kinase such as BCR-abl, VEGFR, PDGFR, EGFR, Flt3, JAK (e.g. JAK2 or JAK3), C-abl, PDK1, Chk (e.g. Chk1 or Chk2), FGFR (e.g. FGFR3), Ret, Eph (e.g. EphB2 or EphB4), or Src (e.g. cSrc) or a mutated form thereof as defined herein, and in particular C-abl and JAK kinases, can be identified by direct sequencing of, for example, tumour biopsies using PCR and methods to sequence PCR products directly as hereinbefore described. The skilled person will recognize that all such well-known techniques for detection of the over expression, activation or mutations of the aforementioned proteins could be applicable in the present case.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular, prior to administration of a combination of the invention, a patient may be screened to determine whether a disease or condition from which the patient is or may be suffering is one which would be susceptible to treatment with a compound having activity against Flt3, JAK, C-abl, PDK1, Chk1, and Chk2. These techniques may also be used for screening for diseases or conditions caused by the up-regulation or mutants of Flt3, JAK, C-abl, PDK1, Chk1, and Chk2 kinases. These techniques may also be used for screening for diseases or conditions caused by the up-regulation or mutants of VEGFR kinases, include, but are not limited to, standard methods such as reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or in-situ hybridisation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment of the invention, prior to administration of a combination of the invention, a patient may be screened to determine whether a disease or condition from which the patient is or may be suffering is one which would be susceptible to treatment with a combination of the invention having activity against FGFR, ret, Eph, cSRC, VEGFR, PDGFR kinases. These techniques may also be used for screening for diseases or conditions caused by the up-regulation or mutants of GFR, ret, Eph, cSRC, VEGFR, PDGFR kinases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, mutant forms of, for example, VEGFR2 can be identified by direct sequencing of, for example, tumour biopsies using PCR and methods to sequence PCR products directly as hereinbefore described. The skilled artisan will recognize that all such well-known techniques for detection of the over expression, activation or mutations of the aforementioned proteins could be applicable in the present case.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAbnormal levels of proteins such as VEGFR can be measured using standard enzyme assays, for example, those assays described herein. Activation or overexpression could also be detected in a tissue sample, for example, a tumour tissue, by measuring the tyrosine kinase activity with an assay such as that available from Chemicon International. The tyrosine kinase of interest would be immunoprecipitated from the sample lysate and its activity measured.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternative methods for the measurement of the over expression or activation of VEGFR including the isoforms thereof, include the measurement of microvessel density. This can for example be measured using methods described by Orre and Rogers (Int J Cancer 1999 84(2) 101-8). Assay methods also include the use of markers, for example, in the case of VEGFR these include CD31, CD34 and CD105 (Mineo et al. J Clin Pathol. 2004 57(6) 591-7).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nActivating mutations of FLT3 are frequently observed in acute myeloid leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and some cases with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Cancer patients with activating mutants of FLT3 can be screened for presence of the length mutations or internal tandem duplication mutations as an indication of those most sensitive to inhibitors of FLT3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nActivating mutations in the tyrosine kinase JAK2 has been observed in polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia and myeloid metaplasia with myelofibrosis. The methods described herein could be used to identify patients harbouring these mutations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPatients with tumours harbouring cells expressing the resistance mutants of BCR-abl e.g. T315I can be identified using the methods described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore in addition the methods described herein could be used to diagnose mutations of JAK2 e.g. V617F, activating mutations of FLT3, mutants of C-Abl e.g. T315I.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment the combination of the invention could be used to treat patients and/or tumours and/or leukemias which are Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+). This is a translocation which occurs between chromosomes 9 and 22 resulting in an altered chromosome 22. The translocation, often referred to as the BCR-abl translocation, can be distinguished by cytogenetic methods such as those known to the skilled person including those described herein, in particular FISH, and used to identify patients suitable for treatment with the combination of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs the combination of the invention, contain inhibitors of aurora kinase which is directly related to mitotic checkpoint defects, the combination of the invention may be particularly suitable for treating patients suffering from a leukaemia exhibiting polyploidy as a manifestation of loss of chromosomal integrity, mitotic spindle defects or disease progression.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenetic instability is a common feature in many leukemias resulting in aneuploidy. Centrosome aberrations have recently been described in several different hematological malignancies including acute myeloid leukemias, myelodysplastic syndromes, Hodgkin's as well as non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, chronic lymphocytic leukemias and multiple myelomas. Analagous to many solid tumors a correlation between centrosome abnormalities on the one hand and karyotype aberrations as well as clinical aggressiveness on the other hand seems to exist in myeloid malignancies, chronic lymphocytic leukemias and at least some types of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nComplex chromosomal aberrations are present in up to 30% of patients with primary myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and are associated with a poor prognosis. Specific alterations in complex karyotypes are difficult to define by conventional cytogenetics alone. A more comprehensive view of the recurrent aberrations can be obtained when spectral karyotyping (SKY) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with selected probes on bone marrow samples are used (Cancer Genet. Cytogenet., 2006, 165(1), 51-63, Trost D et al). A detailed analysis of specific breakpoints and deletions can reveal recurrent involvement of specific chromosomal bands harboring known tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes. Analysis of a large number of MDS and AML cases in a similar detailed manner with SKY and FISH will reveal whether new subgroups can be identified according to their genetic alterations. Correlation with clinical parameters may reveal the prognostic significance of these genetic subgroups. In MDS for example, the International Prognostic Scoring System combines blast percentage, karyotype, and number of cytopenias to generate a scoring system that reliably estimates survival and risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia for patients with MDS. This universally accepted scoring system is often combined with FAB or World Health Organization morphologic criteria to provide a more complete clinical picture and the most accurate prognostic assessment possible (Semin Oncol. 2005 August; 32(4 Suppl 5):S3-10, Bennett).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenetic instability is a common feature of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Blood, 2003, 101(1), 289-91, Neben et al) and centrosome aberrations have been described as a possible cause of aneuploidy in many human tumors. To investigate whether centrosome aberrations correlate with cytogenetic findings in AML, a set of AML samples were examined using a centrosome-specific antibody to pericentrin. The AML samples analyzed displayed numerical and structural centrosome aberrations as compared with peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In comparison to AML samples with normal chromosome count, the extent of numerical and structural centrosome aberrations was higher in samples with numerical chromosome changes. When the frequency of centrosome aberrations was analyzed within cytogenetically defined risk groups, a correlation was found between the extent of centrosome abnormalities in all 3 risk groups. These results indicate that centrosome defects may contribute to the acquisition of chromosome aberrations and thereby to the prognosis in AML.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus a number of techniques known to the skilled person could be used to determine whether a tumour or leukaemia was associated with chromosomal aberrations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore an aspect of the invention is a method of detecting whether a patient is suffering from a disease, in particular cancer, exhibiting chromosomal aberrations and treating them with a combination of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention further provides a method of diagnosing whether a patient as suffering from a leukaemia exhibiting a chromosomal aberration and then administering a combination of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA further aspect of the invention is a method for the prophylaxis or treatment of (or alleviating or reducing the incidence of) cancer in a patient suffering from or suspected of suffering from cancer; which method comprises (i) subjecting a patient to a diagnostic test to determine whether the patient possesses chromosomal aberrations; and (ii) where the patient does possess the said chromosomal aberrations, thereafter administering to the patient a combination of the invention as defined herein having aurora kinase inhibiting activity.\n\n\n \nAntifungal Use\n\n\n \n \n \nIn a further aspect, the invention provides the use of the combinations comprising (or consisting essentially of) an ancillary compound and a compound of the formula (I) or (I′) and sub-groups thereof as defined herein as antifungal agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe combinations of the invention may be used in animal medicine (for example in the treatment of mammals such as humans), or in the treatment of plants (e.g. in agriculture and horticulture), or as general antifungal agents, for example as preservatives and disinfectants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the invention provides a combination as defined herein for use in the prophylaxis or treatment of a fungal infection in a mammal such as a human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso provided is the use of a combination as defined herein for the manufacture of a medicament for use in the prophylaxis or treatment of a fungal infection in a mammal such as a human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, combination of the invention may be administered to human patients suffering from, or at risk of infection by, topical fungal infections caused by among other organisms, species of \nCandida, Trichophyton, Microsporum \nor \nEpidermophyton\n, or in mucosal infections caused by \nCandida albicans \n(e.g. thrush and vaginal candidiasis). The combinations of the invention can also be administered for the treatment or prophylaxis of systemic fungal infections caused by, for example, \nCandida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Coccidiodies, Paracoccidioides, Histoplasma \nor \nBlastomyces. \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides an antifungal composition for agricultural (including horticultural) use, comprising a compound of the formula (I) or (I′) and sub-groups thereof as defined herein together with an ancillary agent and an agriculturally acceptable diluent or carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention further provides a method of treating an animal (including a mammal such as a human), plant or seed having a fungal infection, which comprises treating said animal, plant or seed, or the locus of said plant or seed, with an effective amount of a combination as defined herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides a method of treating a fungal infection in a plant or seed which comprises treating the plant or seed with an antifungally effective amount of a fungicidal composition containing a combination as defined herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDifferential screening assays may be used to select for those compounds with specificity for non-human CDK enzymes. Compounds which act specifically on the CDK enzymes of eukaryotic pathogens can be used as anti-fungal or anti-parasitic agents. Inhibitors of the \nCandida \nCDK kinase, CKSI, can be used in the treatment of candidiasis. Antifungal agents can be used against infections of the type hereinbefore defined, or opportunistic infections that commonly occur in debilitated and immunosuppressed patients such as patients with leukemias and lymphomas, people who are receiving immunosuppressive therapy, and patients with predisposing conditions such as diabetes mellitus or AIDS, as well as for non-immunosuppressed patients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAssays described in the art can be used to screen for agents which may be useful for inhibiting at least one fungus implicated in mycosis such as candidiasis, aspergillosis, mucormycosis, blastomycosis, geotrichosis, cryptococcosis, chromoblastomycosis, coccidiodomycosis, conidiosporosis, histoplasmosis, maduromycosis, rhinosporidosis, nocardiosis, para-actinomycosis, penicilliosis, monoliasis, or sporotrichosis. The differential screening assays can be used to identify anti-fungal agents which may have therapeutic value in the treatment of aspergillosis by making use of the CDK genes cloned from yeast such as \nAspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus nidulans\n, or \nAspergillus terreus\n, or where the mycotic infection is mucon-nycosis, the CDK assay can be derived from yeast such as \nRhizopus arrhizus, Rhizopus oryzae, Absidia corymbifera, Absidia ramosa\n, or \nMucor pusillus\n. Sources of other CDK enzymes include the pathogen \nPneumocystis carinii. \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy way of example, in vitro evaluation of the antifungal activity of the compounds can be performed by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (M.I.C.) which is the concentration of the test compounds, in a suitable medium, at which growth of the particular microorganism fails to occur. In practice, a series of agar plates, each having the test compound incorporated at a particular concentration is inoculated with a standard culture of, for example, \nCandida albicans \nand each plate is then incubated for an appropriate period at 37° C. The plates are then examined for the presence or absence of growth of the fungus and the appropriate M.I.C. value is noted. Alternatively, a turbidity assay in liquid cultures can be performed and a protocol outlining an example of this assay can be found in the Examples below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe in vivo evaluation of the compounds can be carried out at a series of dose levels by intraperitoneal or intravenous injection or by oral administration, to mice that have been inoculated with a fungus, e.g., a strain of \nCandida albicans \nor \nAspergillus flavus\n. The activity of the compounds can be assessed by monitoring the growth of the fungal infection in groups of treated and untreated mice (by histology or by retrieving fungi from the infection). The activity may be measured in terms of the dose level at which the compound provides 50% protection against the lethal effect of the infection (PD\n50\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor human antifungal use, the combinations as defined herein can be administered alone or in admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier selected in accordance with the intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. Thus, for example, they may be administered orally, parenterally, intravenously, intramuscularly or subcutaneously by means of the formulations described above in the section headed “Pharmaceutical Formulations”.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor oral and parenteral administration to human patients, the daily dosage level can be from 0.01 to 10 mg/kg (in divided doses), depending on inter alia the potency of the combination when administered by either the oral or parenteral route. Tablets or capsules of the combination or its constituent compounds may contain, for example, from 5 mg to 0.5 g of active compound for administration singly or two or more at a time as appropriate. The physician in any event will determine the actual dosage (effective amount) which will be most suitable for an individual patient and it will vary with the age, weight and response of the particular patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the antifungal combinations can be administered in the form of a suppository or pessary, or they may be applied topically in the form of a lotion, solution, cream, ointment or dusting powder. For example, they can be incorporated into a cream consisting of an aqueous emulsion of polyethylene glycols or liquid paraffin; or they can be incorporated, at a concentration between 1 and 10%, into an ointment consisting of a white wax or white soft paraffin base together with such stabilizers and preservatives as may be required.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the therapeutic uses described above, anti-fungal agents developed with such differential screening assays can be used, for example, as preservatives in foodstuff, feed supplement for promoting weight gain in livestock, or in disinfectant formulations for treatment of non-living matter, e.g., for decontaminating hospital equipment and rooms. In similar fashion, side by side comparison of inhibition of a mammalian CDK and an insect CDK, such as the \nDrosophilia \nCDK5 gene (Hellmich et al. (1994) FEBS Lett 356:317-21), will permit selection amongst the compounds herein of inhibitors which discriminate between the human/mammalian and insect enzymes. Accordingly, the present invention expressly contemplates the use and formulation of the combinations of the invention in insecticides, such as for use in management of insects like the fruit fly.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment, certain of the subject CDK inhibitors can be selected for use in the combinations of the invention on the basis of inhibitory specificity for plant CDK's relative to the mammalian enzyme. For example, a plant CDK can be disposed in a differential screen with one or more of the human enzymes to select those compounds of greatest selectivity for inhibiting the plant enzyme. Thus, the present invention specifically contemplates formulations of the subject CDK inhibitors for agricultural applications, such as in the form of a defoliant or the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor agricultural and horticultural purposes the combinations of the invention may be used in the form of a composition formulated as appropriate to the particular use and intended purpose. Thus the compounds may be applied in the form of dusting powders, or granules, seed dressings, aqueous solutions, dispersions or emulsions, dips, sprays, aerosols or smokes. Compositions may also be supplied in the form of dispersible powders, granules or grains, or concentrates for dilution prior to use. Such compositions may contain such conventional carriers, diluents or adjuvants as are known and acceptable in agriculture and horticulture and they can be manufactured in accordance with conventional procedures. The compositions may also incorporate other active ingredients, for example, compounds having herbicidal or insecticidal activity or a further fungicide. The compounds and compositions can be applied in a number of ways, for example they can be applied directly to the plant foliage, stems, branches, seeds or roots or to the soil or other growing medium, and they may be used not only to eradicate disease, but also prophylactically to protect the plants or seeds from attack. By way of example, the compositions may contain from 0.01 to 1 wt. % of the active ingredient. For field use, likely application rates of the active ingredient may be from 50 to 5000 g/hectare.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also contemplates the use of the combinations of the invention in the control of wood decaying fungi and in the treatment of soil where plants grow, paddy fields for seedlings, or water for perfusion. Also contemplated by the invention is the use of the combinations as defined herein to protect stored grain and other non-plant loci from fungal infestation.\n\n\n \n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFIG. 1\n is a thermal ellipsoid plot of the free base dihydrate of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea as described in Example 69 of WO 2006/070195 (the content of which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 2\n shows a packing diagram of the free base dihydrate of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea as described in Example 69 of WO 2006/070195 (the content of which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 3\n shows the XRPD pattern of the free base of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea as described in Example 70 of WO 2006/070195 (the content of which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 4\n shows a thermal ellipsoid plot of the L-lactate salt of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea as described in Example 71 of WO 2006/070195 at pages 205 to 209 (the content of which is incorporated herein by reference).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 5\n shows a packing diagram of the L-lactate salt of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea as described in Example 71 of WO 2006/070195 at pages 205 to 209 (the content of which is incorporated herein by reference).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 6\n shows the XRPD patterns of starting and stability tested samples of the L-lactate salt of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea as described in Example 72 of WO 2006/070195 at pages 209 to 211 (the content of which is incorporated herein by reference).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 7\n shows the XRPD patterns of starting and stability tested samples of the free base (FB1) of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea as described in Example 72 of WO 2006/070195 at pages 209 to 211 (the content of which is incorporated herein by reference).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 8\n shows the XRPD patterns of starting and stability tested samples of the free base dihydrate (FB2) of 1-cyclopropyl-3-[3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-urea as described in Example 72 of WO 2006/070195 at pages 209 to 211 (the content of which is incorporated herein by reference).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 9\n shows the results of a combination Screen assay performed in HCT 116 cells for 3 concentrations of Taxol in the presence and absence of 0.01 μM Compound I as described in the example herein.

Treatment with a dosing schedule which alternates between administration of the compound of formula (I) and for example paclitaxel causes inhibition of tumour growth in such xenografts. The combination of the compound with paclitaxel at doses which individually are sub-optimal, achieved an improved inhibition of tumour growth and extended the time to tumour re-growth once treatment stopped. The tolerability of the two agents combined was not decreased compared with their individual effects. This indicates that the combination therapy with the compound has the potential to increase the anti-tumoural activity at lower doses thus improving the therapeutic index. One example of an effective combination schedule was weekly dosing of paclitaxel on \nday\n 1 each week combined with a 4× weekly dosing cycle for the compound given on days 2-5 each week.\n\n\n \nSet B: Examples Relating to Compounds of the Formula (0)\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention will now be illustrated, but not limited, by reference to the specific embodiments described in the following examples.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the examples, the compounds prepared were characterised by liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy (LC-MS) using the system and operating conditions set out in WO2005/012256 at pages 116 et seq.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe starting materials for each of the Examples are commercially available unless otherwise specified.\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\nGeneral Procedure A: Preparation of Amide from Amino-Pyrazole\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo a stirred solution of the appropriate 4-amino-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid amide (0.23 mmol), EDAC (52 mg; 0.27 mmol) and HOBt (37 mg; 0.27 mmol) in 5 ml of N,N-dimethylformamide was added the corresponding carboxylic acid (0.25 mmol), and the mixture was then left at room temperature overnight.

The filter-cake was charged to a 20 L rotary evaporator flask and drying completed azeotropically with toluene (2×4.50 L) to afford 4-(2,6-dichlorobenzoylamino)-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid as a yellow solid (1.044 Kg, approx. 99.5%).\n\n\n \nStage 5: Preparation of 4-{[4-(2,6-dichlorobenzoylamino)-1H-pyrazole-3-carbonyl]amino}piperidine-1-carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStage 4 product (1.0 wt) and toluene (10.0 vol) were charged to a suitably sized flange flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, dropping funnel and thermometer. The contents were stirred under nitrogen at 16 to 25° C. and thionyl chloride (0.3 vol) was added slowly. The contents were then heated to 80 to 100° C. and stirred at this temperature until the reaction was judged complete by \n1\nH NMR. Further toluene (up to 10 vol) could be added at this stage if the contents were to become too thick to stir. Once complete, the mixture was cooled to between 40 and 50° C. and then concentrated under vacuum at 45 to 50° C. to dryness. The residue was then azeo-dried with toluene (3×2.0 vol).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe isolated solid was transferred to a suitably sized flask and tetrahydrofuran (5.0 vol) was charged. The contents were stirred under nitrogen at 16 to 25° C. and triethylamine (0.512 vol) was added. To a separate flask was charged 4-amino-piperidine-1-carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester (0.704 wt) and tetrahydrofuran (5.0 vol). The contents were agitated until complete dissolution was achieved and the solution was then charged to the reaction flask, maintaining the temperature between 16 and 30° C. The reaction mixture was then heated to between 45 and 50° C. and the contents stirred until judged complete by \n1\nH NMR. The contents were then cooled to between 16 and 25° C. and water (5.0 vol) was charged. Mixed heptanes (0.5 vol) were added, the contents were stirred for up to 10 minutes and the layers were separated. The aqueous phase was then extracted with tetrahydrofuran:mixed heptanes [(9:1), 3×5.0 vol]. The organic phases were combined, washed with water (2.5 vol) and then concentrated under vacuum at 40 to 45° C. The residue was azeotroped with toluene (3×5.0 vol) and concentrated to dryness to yield the \ncrude Stage\n 5 product.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe solid was then transferred to a suitably sized flask, methanol: toluene [(2.5:97.5), 5.0 vol] was added and the slurry was stirred under nitrogen for 3 to 18 hours. The contents were filtered, the filter-cake was washed with toluene (2×0.7 vol) and the solid was then dried under vacuum at 40 to 50° C. to yield 4-{[4-(2,6-dichlorobenzoylamino)-1H-pyrazole-3-carbonyl]amino}piperidine-1-carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester as an off-white solid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo batches of Stage 4 product (0.831 kg per batch) were processed in this way to give a total of 2.366 kg (88.6% yield) of 4-{[4-(2,6-dichlorobenzoylamino)-1H-pyrazole-3-carbonyl]amino}piperidine-1-carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester.\n\n\n \nStage 6: Preparation of 4-(2,6-dichlorobenzoylamino)-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid piperidin-4-ylamide methanesulphonate\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nStage\n 5 product (1.0 wt) and 1,4-dioxane (30.0 vol) were charged to a suitably sized flange flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, dropping funnel and thermometer.

Methanesulphonic acid (0.54 vol) was added over 30 to 60 minutes and the contents were then heated to 95 to 105° C. and stirred in this temperature range until the reaction was judged complete by 1H NMR. Once complete, the contents were cooled to between 20 and 30° C. and the resultant precipitate collected by filtration. The filter-cake was washed with 2-propanol (2×2.0 vol) and pulled dry on the filter for 3 to 24 hours to give crude 4-(2,6-dichlorobenzoylamino)-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid piperidin-4-ylamide methanesulphonate as a free-flowing off-white solid (80.0 to 120.0% w/w, uncorrected for impurities or solutes).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral batches of \nStage\n 5 product were processed in this way and the details of the quantities of starting material and product for each batch are set out in Table 1 below.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nYields from the deprotection step - Stage 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nInput (g) of (4-{[4-(2,6-\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDichloro-benzoylamino)-\n\n\nOutput (g) of [4-(2,6-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1H-pyrazole-3-\n\n\nDichlorobenzoyl-amino)-\n\n\nChemical\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ncarbonyl]amino}-\n\n\n1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic\n\n\npurity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\npiperidine-1-carboxylic\n\n\nacid piperidin-4-ylamide\n\n\n(HPLC %\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBatch\n\n\nacid tert-butyl ester)\n\n\nmethanesulphonate]\n\n\narea)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n590.0\n\n\n579.6\n\n\n97.88\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n99.1% th, 98.2% w/\nw\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n521.0\n\n\n532.7\n\n\n98.09\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n103.1% th, 102.2% w/w\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n523.8\n\n\n511.7\n\n\n98.17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n98.5% th, 97.7% w/w\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n518.4\n\n\n596.3\n\n\n98.24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n116.0% th, 115.0% w/\nw\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n563.2\n\n\n600.1\n\n\n98.16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n107.4% th, 106.6% w/w\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n563.1\n\n\n565.2\n\n\n98.49\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n101.2% th, 100.4% w/w\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n560.4\n\n\n553.9\n\n\n98.70\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n99.7% th, 98.8% w/w\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n569.7\n\n\n560.6\n\n\n98.41\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n99.2% th, 98.4% w/w\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nStage 6a: Recrystallisation of 4-(2,6-dichlorobenzoylamino)-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid piperidin-4-ylamide methanesulphonate\n\n\n \n \n \nThe product of Stage 6 was recrystallised to ensure that any residual levels of Boc-protected product of \nStage\n 5 were no greater than 0.25%. Four batches of Stage 6 product were recrystallised using the following protocol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCrude Stage 6 product and 2-propanol (10.0 vol) were charged to a suitably sized flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, dropping funnel and thermometer. The contents were stirred under nitrogen and heated to between 75 and 85° C. Water (up to 2.5 vol) was then charged to the contents until a clear solution was obtained. The contents were then cooled to between 40 and 60° C. and concentrated under vacuum at 40 to 50° C. until the reaction volume was reduced by approximately 50%. 2-Propanol (3.0 vol) was charged to the flask and the contents were concentrated at 40 to 50° C. until approximately 3.0 vol of solvent was removed. This process was then repeated twice more with 2-propanol (2×3.0 vol) and the water content was checked. The resultant slurry was then cooled to between 0 and 5° C. and stirred at this temperature for 1 to 2 hours. The contents were filtered, the filter-cake was washed with 2-propanol (2×1.0 vol) and then pulled dry on the filter for up to 24 hours. The solid was transferred to drying trays and dried under vacuum at 45 to 50° C. to constant weight to give 4-(2,6-dichlorobenzoylamino)-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid piperidin-4-ylamide methanesulphonate as an off-white solid (60.0 to 100.0% w/w).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe recrystallisation yields for the four batches ranged between 85.6% and 90.4% and the purities of the recrystallised product ranged from 99.29% to 99.39%. A second recrystallisation increased the purity still further.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe 4-(2,6-dichlorobenzoylamino)-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid piperidin-4-ylamide methanesulphonate produced by this route had a melting point (by DSC) of 379.8° C.\n\n\n \nRemoval of Residual Boc-Protected Product of \nStage\n 5\n\n\n \n \n \nIn some cases, when the methanesulphonate salt was dissolved in acetate buffer, a fine precipitate consisting of residual traces of the Boc-protected free base was observed. Several techniques may be used for removing or preventing the formation of the precipitate, as set out below.\n\n\n \n(a) Filtration\n\n\n \n \n \nA mixture of the methanesulphonate salt in 200 mM acetate buffer was drawn from a vial into a 20 mL single-use syringe using a sterile needle, and a clinical grade 0.2 μm filter (a Sartorius Minisart sterile single use filter unit) was then attached to the syringe. The plunger of the syringe was slowly depressed and the filtrate collected in a clean, clear glass vial. The content of the vial was a clear, colourless solution of the methanesulphonate salt free of particulate matter.\n\n\n \n(b) Heating in Aqueous Acid\n\n\n \n \n \nA mixture of the methanesulphonate salt and methanesulphonic acid (0.4 eq.) in water (10 vol) was heated at 100° C. for 4 hours, and then cooled to 60° C. Analysis by TLC indicates that the methanesulphonate salt was present as a single component. 2-Propanol (10 vol) was added and the mixture cooled to 40° C. The mixture was reduced in vacuo to approximately 10 volumes, then a further portion of 2-propanol added (10 vol) and the mixture again reduced to 10 volumes. This cycle was repeated a further three times. The mixture was cooled in an ice-bath and the solid formed collected by filtration, washed with 2-propanol (5 vol) and dried in vacuo to give the methanesulphonate salt as a white to off-white solid.\n\n\n \n(c) Organic-Aqueous Extractions\n\n\n \n \n \nA mixture of the methanesulphonate salt and methanesulphonic acid (0.4 eq.) in water (10 vol) was heated at 100° C. for 3 hours, and then cooled to ambient temperature. To this mixture was added THF-heptane (9:1, 10 vol) and the resultant mixture stirred vigorously to give a solution. The layers were separated and the aqueous phase washed with THF-heptane (9:1, 2×10 vol) then ethyl acetate (2×10 vol). To the aqueous phase was added 2-propanol (10 vol) and the solution was reduced in vacuo to approximately 5 volumes, then a further portion of 2-propanol added (10 vol) and the mixture again reduced to 5 volumes. This cycle was repeated a further three times. The solid formed was collected by filtration, washed with 2-propanol (5 vol) and dried in vacuo to give the methanesulphonate salt as a white to off-white solid.\n\n\n \n(d) Chromatography\n\n\n \n \n \nThe use of chromatographic techniques may provide a route for removing non-polar impurities from the methanesulphonate salt. The use of reverse-phase methods will be particularly useful.\n\n\n \nBiological Activity\n\n\n \n \n \nThe biological activities of the compounds of (0), (I\n0\n), (I), (Ia), (Ib), (II), (III), (IV), (IVa), (Va), (Vb), (VIa), (VIb), (VII) or (VIII) and sub-groups thereof as defined in WO 2005/012256 (PCT/GB2004/003179) (and therefore herein also by dint of the incorporation of the relevant subject matter of WO 2005/012256 (PCT/GB2004/003179) by reference, see infra) as inhibitors of CDK kinases, GSK-3 kinase and as inhibitors of cell growth are demonstrated by the examples set out below.\n\n\n \nExample 5\n\n\nMeasurement of CDK2 Kinase Inhibitory Activity (IC\n50\n)\n\n\n \n \n \nSee Example 246 of WO 2005/012256 at pages 213-214 (which is incorporated herein by reference).\n\n\n \nExample 6\n\n\nCDK Selectivity Assays\n\n\n \n \n \nSee Example 247 of WO 2005/012256 at pages 214-215 (which is incorporated herein by reference).\n\n\n \nExample 7A\n\n\nMeasurement of Activated CDK2/CyclinA Kinase Inhibitory Activity Assay (IC\n50\n)\n\n\n \n \n \nSee Example 12 of WO 2006/077426 at pages 98-99 (which is incorporated herein by reference).\n\n\n \n7B.

The methods for the liquid chromatography (LC) and mass spectrometry (MS) can be varied to provide better separation of the crude materials and improved detection of the samples by MS. Optimisation of the preparative gradient LC method will involve varying columns, volatile eluents and modifiers, and gradients. Methods are well known in the art for optimising preparative LC-MS methods and then using them to purify compounds. Such methods are described in Rosentreter U, Huber U.; Optimal fraction collecting in preparative LC/MS; J \nComb Chem.; \n2004; 6(2), 159-64 and Leister W, Strauss K, Wisnoski D, Zhao Z, Lindsley C., Development of a custom high-throughput preparative liquid chromatography/mass spectrometer platform for the preparative purification and analytical analysis of compound libraries; \nJ Comb Chem.; \n2003; 5(3); 322-9.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne such system for purifying compounds via preparative LC-MS is described below although a person skilled in the art will appreciate that alternative systems and methods to those described could be used. In particular, normal phase preparative LC based methods might be used in place of the reverse phase methods described here. Most preparative LC-MS systems utilise reverse phase LC and volatile acidic modifiers, since the approach is very effective for the purification of small molecules and because the eluents are compatible with positive ion electrospray mass spectrometry. Employing other chromatographic solutions e.g. normal phase LC, alternatively buffered mobile phase, basic modifiers etc as outlined in the analytical methods described above could alternatively be used to purify the compounds.\n\n\n \nPreparative LC-MS Systems:\n\n\nWaters Fractionlynx System:\n\n\n \n \n \nHardware:\n\n\n \n2767 Dual Loop Autosampler/Fraction Collector\n\n\n \n \n \n2525 preparative pump\n\n\nCFO (column fluidic organiser) for column selection\n\n\nRMA (Waters reagent manager) as make up pump\n\n\n\n \nWaters ZQ Mass Spectrometer\n\n\n \n \n \nWaters 2996 Photo Diode Array detector\n\n\n \nWaters ZQ Mass Spectrometer\n\n\n \n \n \nSoftware:\n\n\n \nMasslynx 4.0\n\n\n \n \n \nWaters MS Running Conditions:\n\n\n \n \nCapillary voltage: 3.5 kV (3.2 kV on ES Negative)\n\n\nCone voltage: 25 V\n\n\n\n \nSource Temperature: 120° C.\n\n\nMultiplier: 500 V\n\n\nScan Range: 125-800 amu\n\n\nIonisation Mode:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nElectroSpray Positive or\n\n\nElectroSpray Negative\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgilent 1100 LC-MS Preparative System:\n\n\n \n \n \nHardware:\n\n\n \n \nAutosampler: 1100 series “prepALS”\n\n\nPump: 1100 series “PrepPump” for preparative flow gradient and 1100 series “QuatPump” for pumping modifier in prep flow\n\n\nUV detector: 1100 series “MWD” Multi Wavelength Detector\n\n\nMS detector: 1100 series “LC-MSD VL”\n\n\n\n \nFraction Collector: 2×“Prep-FC”\n\n\n \n \n \nMake Up pump: “Waters RMA”\n\n\n \nAgilent Active Splitter\n\n\n \n \n \nSoftware:\n\n\n \nChemstation: Chem32\n\n\n \n \n \nAgilent MS Running Conditions:\n\n\n \n \nCapillary voltage: 4000 V (3500 V on ES Negative)\n\n\n \nFragmentor/Gain:150/1\n\n\n \n \n \nDrying gas flow: 13.0 L/min\n\n\n \nGas Temperature: 350° C.\n\n\n \n \n \nNebuliser Pressure: 50 psig\n\n\n \nScan Range: 125-800 amu\n\n\nIonisation Mode:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nElectroSpray Positive or\n\n\nElectroSpray Negative\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChromatographic Conditions:\n\n\n \n \n \nColumns:\n\n\n \n \n1.

It was found that the crystals belong to a monoclinic space group C2/c (# 15) with crystal lattice parameters a=9.15, b=31.32, c=7.93 Å, β=113.3°, α=γ=90°. One short room temperature scan was taken to check crystal lattice parameters and symmetry. It was found that symmetry is the same as at 104 K and crystal lattice parameters are similar (room temperature a=9.19, b=31.31, c=8.09 Åβ=115.2°. The unit cell dimensions a, b & c have a deviation (s.u., standard uncertainty) of 5%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe crystal structure was solved using direct methods implemented in SHELXS-97. Intensity data for a total of 2682 unique reflections in a resolution range from 15.67-0.84 Å (2.82<θ<66.54) were used in the refinement of 263 crystallographic parameters by SHELXL-97. Final statistical parameters were: wR2=0.1749 (all data), R\nF\n=0.0663 (data with 1>2σ(I)) and goodness of fit S=1.035.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOnly one molecule of free base was found in the asymmetric unit. The elemental composition of the asymmetric unit was C\n17\nH\n19\nCl\n2\nN\n5\nO\n4\nS and the calculated density of the crystals is 1.47 Mg/m\n3\n. Hydrogen atoms were generated on geometrical grounds while the location of heteroatom bound hydrogen atoms was confirmed by inspection of Fo-Fc difference maps. The positional and thermal parameters of hydrogen atoms were constricted to ride on corresponding non-hydrogen atoms. The thermal motion of non-hydrogen atoms was modelled by anisotropic thermal factors (see \nFIG. 13\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe crystal structure contains one intramolecular (N-6-H . . . O14 2.812 Å) and one intermolecular hydrogen bond (see \nFIG. 14\n). The molecules are linked together into chains by intermolecular H-bond N1-H . . . O22 2.845 Å.

recrystallisation method described in Example 5 Step 8.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe crystal samples for X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) data collection were gently ground by marble mortar and loaded into a crystallographic capillary (from Hampton Research, Quartz or \nGlass Type\n 10, 0.4 or 0.7 mm diameter). Diffraction patterns were collected at room temperature using CuKα radiation (λ=1.5418 Å) from a Rigaku rotating anode RU3HR, Osmic blue confocal optics, ¼ χ goniometer and a Rigaku HTC image plate detector. 2D Images were collected while spinning φ axis with a detector to crystal distance of 250 mm. Data collection was controlled by CrystalClear software and 2D images were converted to 1D plot (2θ vs. Intensity) by Datasqueeze (intensity averaged over the \nazimuthal angle\n 0<X<360° for 2θ range 3-30° in 0.01° or 0.02° steps).

The sample was then placed into a Pyris Diamond DSC (Perkin-Elmer) equipped with a liquid nitrogen cooling unit and allowed to equilibrate at 25° C. until a stable heat flow response was seen. A dry helium purge gas at a flow rate of 20 ml/min was used to produce an inert atmosphere and prevent oxidation of the sample during heating. The sample was then scanned from 25-400° C. at a scan rate of 200° C./min and the resulting heat flow response (mW) measured against temperature. Prior to experimental analysis the instrument was temperature and heat-flow calibrated using an indium reference standard.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA DSC scan of the compound is shown in \nFIG. 16\n.\n\n\n \nThermogravimetric Analysis\n\n\n \n \n \nApproximately 5 mg of sample (accurately weighed) was placed into a platinum TGA pan and loaded into a TGA 7 gravimetric analyser. The sample under study was then heated at a rate of 10° C./min (from ambient to 300° C.) and the resulting change in weight monitored. A dry nitrogen purge gas at a flow rate of 20 ml/min was used to produce an inert atmosphere and prevent oxidation of the sample during heating. Prior to analysis the instrument was weight calibrated using a 100 mg reference standard and temperature calibrated using an Alumel reference standard (using the Curie point transition temperature).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe weight loss profile of the compound is shown in \nFIG. 17\n.\n\n\n \nResults and Conclusions\n\n\n \n \n \nFrom the resulting DSC thermograms obtained, a single defined and co-operative endothermic transition was seen onset ca. 294.5-295° C., indicative of the thermally induced melting of the crystalline lattice. No significant transitions were apparent prior to the main melting endotherm, indicating little/no loss of chemisorbed (bound) volatiles from the sample (as a result of dehydration/desolvation) as well as no detectable presence of amorphous content. This lack of a hydrated or solvated state was confirmed using TGA (\nFIG. 17\n) which showed a mass loss of approximately 0.2% up to 150° C. This suggests the existence of this drug form in the solely anhydrous crystalline state with no detectable polymorphic impurities or polymorphic transformations occurring.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe TGA plot (\nFIG. 17\n), shows a significant event at about 288° C. which occurred with an onset prior to the main melt transition, suggesting a small degree of thermally induced partial degradation of the sample prior to and during the melt. This degradation process was accelerated at temperatures greater than 300° C.\n\n\n \nExample 10\n\n\nVapour Sorption/Desorption Analysis of 4-(2,6-dichlorobenzoylamino)-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid (1-methanesulphonyl-piperidin-4-yl)-amide\n\n\n \n \n \nCrystals of 4-(2,6-dichlorobenzoylamino)-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid (1-methanesulphonyl-piperidin-4-yl)-amide prepared by the recrystallisation method of Example 5 Step 8 were subjected to vapour sorption/desorption analysis in order to test for the propensity of this sample to form a hydrated state.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nApproximately 20 mg of sample was placed into a wire-mesh vapour sorption balance pan and loaded into an ‘IgaSorp’ vapour sorption balance (Hiden Analytical Instruments) held at 25+/−0.1° C. The sample was then dried by maintaining a 0% humidity environment (using mass flow control apparatus) until no further weight change was recorded. Subsequently, the sample was then subjected to a ramping profile from 0-90% relative humidity (% RH) at 10% RH increments, maintaining the sample at each step until equilibration had been attained (99.5% step completion).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUpon reaching equilibration, the % RH within the apparatus was ramped to the next step and the equilibration procedure repeated. After completion of the sorption cycle, the sample was then dried using the same procedure. The weight change during the sorption/desorption cycles was then monitored, allowing for the hygroscopic nature of the sample to be determined.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA vapour sorption/desorption profile of the compound is shown in \nFIG. 18\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDuring initial drying of the sample (at 0% RH), a weight loss of approximately 0.01% was seen, corresponding to the removal of loosely bound physi-sorbed or unbound surface adsorbed water present on the particles prior to analysis. Subsequently, increasing the relative humidity stepwise to 90% RH resulted in corresponding small incremental weight increases, totalling 0.24% upon equilibration at 90% RH. These small degrees of mass uptake seen upon storage at the varying humidities was the result of simple surface adsorption of a monolayer of water onto the particle surfaces with no true crystalline hydrate formation evident.

An aliquot of the granule mass (9.0 g) was mixed with a further aliquot of Ac-Di-Sol (1.0 g). The quantity of the granule mass that could be filled into \nsize\n 0 capsules was determined (both flush-filled and tightly packed).

The capsule formulation described was therefore subjected to disintegration testing using a standard tablet/capsule disintegration apparatus (European Pharmacopoeia, 4\nth \nEdition). Distilled water was used as the disintegration medium. The volume of the disintegration medium was 800 mL and the temperature was maintained at 37° C. (+/−1° C.). The assessment of dispersion/dissolution behaviour of the formulation was made by observation alone. The disintegration times are set out in Table below.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nQuantity of Compound of\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nformula (I) per capsule\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(mg)\n\n\nDisintegration time (min)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24.8\n\n\n(flush-filled)\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n37.9\n\n\n(tightly packed)\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDissolution Testing\n\n\n \n \n \nThe rate of dissolution of the capsule formulation was compared with the rate of dissolution of (1) the non-encapsulated solid dispersion of PVP and the compound of formula (I) containing no further excipients and (2) the solid dispersion (1) packed tightly into a \nsize\n 0 capsule, and (3) the formulated sample.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dissolution testing was conducted using the paddle apparatus as described in the European Pharmacopoeia, 4\nth \nEdition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results of the dissolution studies are shown in \nFIG. 19\n. \nFIG. 19\n is a graph of solubility against time for several formulations containing a solid dispersion of 4-(2,6-dichloro-benzoylamino)-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid (1-methanesulphonyl-piperidin-4-yl)-amide and PVP, where (1) indicates the non-encapsulated solid dispersion of PVP and the compound of formula (I) containing no further excipients; (2) indicates the solid dispersion (1) packed tightly into a \nsize\n 0 capsule and (3) indicates the formulated sample.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results show that dissolution of the non-encapsulated solid dispersion was quicker than the dissolution of the capsule sample. In the tightly packed encapsulated sample, the PVP is probably binding the particles together, thus retarding the release of the compound of formula (I). Interestingly, the formulated sample exhibited a much more rapid compound release profile compared with the non-formulated, encapsulated sample, which indicates that the high proportion of disintegrant in the formulation is effective in countering the binding capacity of the PVP.\n\n\n \nExample 20\n\n\nDetermination of Antifungal Activity\n\n\n \n \n \nSee Example 13 of WO 2006/077416 at pages 79-80 (which is incorporated herein by reference).
