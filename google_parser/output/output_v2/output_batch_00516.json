The pharmaceutical composition according to \nclaim 28\n wherein the medicament comprises a spermicidal compound. Description\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention concerns the microbicidal activity of certain pyrimidine or triazine containing non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), in particular, the present invention concerns the use of pyrimidine or triazine derivatives in the manufacture of a medicament for the prevention of HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) transmission or infection in humans, in particular sexual transmission. It also concerns pharmaceutical compositions adapted to be applied at the site where sexual intercourse or related intimate contact takes place.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWorldwide, the heterosexual route is the prevalent mode of transmission of AIDS. Therefore, demands have been raised for measures that block sexual spreading of the HIV infection. As there is no effective treatment or vaccine against AIDS, preventive measures are the only tools that can presently reduce transmission of Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The consistent and correct use of condoms represents an effective barrier to prevent HIV transmission. However, the reduction of acquiring infection can only be significantly reduced if condoms are used for almost all sexual intercourses; a result that can not be achieved despite intensive prevention programs to increase condom use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDevelopment of microbicides for topical use may represent an efficacious alternative to condoms. A microbicide is any agent that kills or deactivates disease-causing microbes. According to the International Association of Physicians in AIDS CARE (IAPAC), the definition of microbicides also includes interventions that can block or prevent infection, as well as amplification of the body's natural defenses to prevent infection through sexual acts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIdeally, microbicides should have little or no side effects at an effective microbicidal concentration. One aspect in this respect is that the drug used as microbicide should have little or no immunosuppressive activity at an effective microbicidal concentration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, the ideal microbicide should sufficiently withstand varying temperatures and acceptably function within varied pH ranges (ranges of alkaline and acidic levels in the vagina). Further, it should not eliminate the natural beneficial lactobacilli that reside in the vagina and regulate vaginal health.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStudies have demonstrated that HIV transmission through direct, biological mechanisms are facilitated in a person already infected with a sexually transmitted disease (STD) (Fleming et al. Sexually Transmitted Infections (1999 February), 75(1), 3-17). Sores, lesions and inflammations caused by STDs compromise certain physical barriers to disease. For these reasons, taking measures to prevent STD transmission is a valuable strategy in the fight against HIV infection. Several microbicides in human clinical trials contain detergent-type ingredients, which may cause lesions at vaginal and cervical epithelia. Spermicidal products containing biodetergents can inactivate HIV in vitro. However, it has been shown that such biodetergents may exacerbate genital ulcers and facilitate HIV transmission when tested in vivo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBesides surfactants, which directly act on the virus particle, drugs that block the early steps of HIV multiplication such as antiretroviral drugs are undergoing preclinical assessment. Various antiretrovirals including non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) have been tested in vitro with varying results. To date, no evidence has been published on the in vivo effectiveness of NNRTIs as microbicidal agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt has now been found that the pyrimidine and triazine compounds of the present invention exhibit microbicidal activity in that these compounds have the ability to prevent the infection by HIV.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, the pyrimidine and triazine compounds of the present invention also have shown microbicidal activity against STD pathogens such as \nHaemophilus ducreyi\n, while maintaining their compatibility with lactobacilli and normal vagina flora. The derived healing effect of the present compounds on the chancroids caused by \nHaemophilus ducreyi\n, significantly contributes to the prevention of systemic HIV infection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEP 1002795, WO 99/50250, WO 99/50256 and WO 00/27828 disclose compounds inhibiting the replication of the HIV virus in the human T-4 cells via an interaction with the HIV reverse transcriptase enzyme.\n\n\n \nDESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention concerns the use of compounds having the formula (I), (II) and (III) wherein a compound of formula (I) corresponds to\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \na N-oxide, a pharmaceutically acceptable addition salt or a stereochemically isomeric form thereof, wherein\n\n \n \n \nY is CR\n5 \nor N;\n \nA is CH, CR\n4 \nor N;\n \nn is 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4;\n \nQ is —NR\n1\nR\n2 \nor when Y is CR\n5 \nthen Q may also be hydrogen;\n \nR\n1 \nand R\n2 \nare each independently selected from hydrogen, hydroxy, C\n1-12\nalkyl, C\n1-12\nalkyloxy, C\n1-12\nalkylcarbonyl, C\n1-12\nalkyloxycarbonyl, aryl, amino, mono- or di(C\n1-12\nalkyl)amino, mono- or di(C\n1-12\nalkyl)aminocarbonyl wherein each of the aforementioned C\n1-12\nalkyl groups may optionally and each individually be substituted with one or two substituents each independently selected from hydroxy, C\n1-6\nalkyloxy, hydroxyC\n1-6\nalkyloxy, carboxyl, C\n1-6\nalkyloxycarbonyl, cyano, amino, imino, aminocarbonyl, aminocarbonylamino, mono- or di(C\n1-6\nalkyl)amino, aryl and Het; or\n \nR\n1 \nand R\n2 \ntaken together may form pyrrolidinyl, piperidinyl, morpholinyl, azido or mono- or di(C\n1-12\nalkyl)aminoC\n1-4\nalkylidene;\n \nR\n3 \nis hydrogen, aryl, C\n1-6\nalkylcarbonyl, C\n1-6\nalkyl, C\n1-6\nalkyloxycarbonyl, C\n1-6\nalkyl substituted with C\n1-6\nalkyloxycarbonyl; and\n \neach R\n4 \nindependently is hydroxy, halo, C\n1-6\nalkyl, C\n1-6\nalkyloxy, cyano, amino-carbonyl, nitro, amino, trihalomethyl, trihalomethyloxy, or when Y is CR\n5 \nthen R\n4 \nmay also represent C\n1-6\nalkyl substituted with cyano or aminocarbonyl;\n \nR\n5 \nis hydrogen or C\n1-4\nalkyl;\n \nL is —X\n1\n—R\n6 \nor —X\n2\n-Alk-R\n7 \nwherein\n    \n \nR\n6 \nand R\n7 \neach independently are phenyl or phenyl substituted with one, two, three, four or five substituents each independently selected from halo, hydroxy, C\n1-6\nalkyl, C\n1-6\nalkyloxy, C\n1-6\nalkylcarbonyl, C\n1-6\nalkyloxycarbonyl, formyl, cyano, nitro, amino, and trifluoromethyl; or when Y is CR\n5 \nthen R\n6 \nand R\n7 \nmay also be selected from phenyl substituted with one, two, three, four or five substituents each independently selected from aminocarbonyl, trihalomethyloxy and trihalomethyl; or when Y is N then R\n6 \nand R\n7 \nmay also be selected from indanyl or indolyl, each of said indanyl or indolyl may be substituted with one, two, three, four or five substituents each independently selected from halo, hydroxy, C\n1-6\nalkyl, C\n1-6\nalkyl-oxy, C\n1-6\nalkylcarbonyl, C\n1-6\nalkyloxycarbonyl, formyl, cyano, nitro, amino, and trifluoromethyl; when R\n6 \nis optionally substituted indanyl or indolyl, it is preferably attached to the remainder of the molecule via the fused phenyl ring.

All salts, whether pharmaceutically acceptable or not are included within the ambit of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts as mentioned hereinabove are meant to comprise the microbicidal active non-toxic addition salt forms which the compounds of the present invention are able to form. The latter can conveniently be obtained by treating the base form with such appropriate acids as inorganic acids, for example, hydrohalic acids, e.g. hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid and the like; sulfuric acid; nitric acid; phosphoric acid and the like; or organic acids, for example, acetic, propanoic, hydroxyacetic, lactic, pyruvic, oxalic, malonic, succinic, maleic, fumaric, malic, tartaric, citric, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, p-toluene-sulfonic, cyclamic, salicylic, p-aminosalicylic, pamoic and the like acids. Conversely the salt form can be converted by treatment with alkali into the free base form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts as mentioned hereinabove are also meant to comprise the microbicidal active non-toxic base forms, in particular, metal or amine addition salt forms which the compounds of the present invention are able to form. Said salts can conveniently be obtained by treating the compounds of the present invention containing acidic hydrogen atoms with appropriate organic and inorganic bases such as, for example, the ammonium salts, the alkali and earth alkaline metal salts, e.g. the lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium salts and the like, salts with organic bases, e.g. primary, secondary and tertiary aliphatic and aromatic amines such as methylamine, ethylamine, propylamine, isopropylamine, the four butylamine isomers, dimethylamine, diethylamine, diethanolamine, dipropylamine, diisopropylamine, di-n-butylamine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, morpholine, trimethylamine, triethylamine, tripropylamine, quinuclidine, pyridine, quinoline and isoquinoline, the benzathine, N-methyl-D-glucamine, 2-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol, hydrabamine salts, and salts with amino acids such as, for example, arginine, lysine and the like. Conversely said salt forms can be converted by treatment with acid into the free acid form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term addition salts comprises as well the hydrates and the solvent addition forms which the compounds of the present invention are able to form. Examples of such forms are e.g. hydrates, alcoholates and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “quaternary amine” as used hereinbefore defines the quaternary ammonium salts which the compounds are able to form by reaction between a basic nitrogen of a compound and an appropriate quaternizing agent, such as, for example, an optionally substituted alkylhalide, arylhalide or arylalkylhalide, e.g. methyliodide or benzyliodide. Other reactants with good leaving groups may also be used, such as alkyl trifluoromethanesulfonates, alkyl methanesulfonates, and alkyl p-toluenesulfonates. A quaternary amine has a positively charged nitrogen. Pharmaceutically acceptable counterions include chloro, bromo, iodo, trifluoroacetate and acetate. The counterion of choice can be introduced using ion exchange resins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe N-oxide forms of the present compounds are meant to comprise the compounds wherein one or several tertiary nitrogen atoms are oxidized to the so-called N-oxide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of the present invention, their N-oxides, addition salts, quaternary amines, as used hereinbefore, defines all possible compounds made up of the same atoms bonded by the same sequence of bonds but having different three-dimensional structures which are not interchangeable, which the compounds of the present invention may possess. Unless otherwise mentioned or indicated, the chemical designation of a compound encompasses the mixture of all possible stereochemically isomeric forms that said compound may possess. Said mixture may contain all diastereomers and/or enantiomers of the basic molecular structure of said compound. All stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds both in pure form or in admixture with each other are intended to be embraced within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular, stereogenic centers may have the R- or S-configuration; substituents on bivalent cyclic (partially) saturated radicals may have either the cis- or trans-configuration. Compounds encompassing double bonds can have an E (entgegen) or Z (zusammen)-stereochemistry at said double bond. The terms cis, trans, R, S, E and Z are well known to a person skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome of the present compounds may also exist in their tautomeric forms. Such forms although not explicitly indicated in the above formula are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhenever used hereinafter, the term “compounds”, the term “compounds of the present invention” is meant to to include any subgroup thereof, also the N-oxide forms, the pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts, the quaternary amines and all stereochemically isomeric forms. Of special interest are those compounds which are stereochemically pure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhenever substituents can be selected each independently from a list of numerous definitions, such as for example for R\n6 \nand R\n7\n, all possible combinations are intended which are chemically possible and which lead to chemically stable molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable compounds of formula (I)

In particular, they can prevent sexual or vaginal transmission of HIV by preventing either the production of infectious viral particles or infection of uninfected cells. If infected cells in sperm can reach the mucosa, the compounds of the present invention can prevent HIV infection of host cells, such as macrophages, lymphocytes, Langerhans and M cells. Thus, the present compounds prevent systemic HIV infection of a human being, exhibiting a prophylactic action against HIV. Evidence for this microbicidal activity is given in the experimental part and is based on in vivo activity of compound B in a human SCID (Severe Combined Immune Deficiency) animal model (Di Fabio et al., AIDS 2001, 15, 2231-2238) and on in vitro activity of Compound B in a model based on immature monocyte derived dendritic cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, it has been found that the compounds of this invention have a killing effect on the \nHaemophilus ducreyi \nbacteria. As such, the compounds of this invention may be used in the prevention and treatment of chancroids, the venereal disease caused by this bacteria. These additional effects will even improve the effectiveness of the present compounds in preventing infection with HIV.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention may be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions that can be used to apply microbicides to effectively prevent transmission of pathogens through mucosae and/or skin, more particularly to prevent the sexual or vaginal transmission of HIV. Thus, the compositions are in forms adapted to be applied to the site where sexual intercourse or related intimate contact takes place, such as the genitals, vagina, vulva, cervix, rectum, mouth, hands, lower abdomen, upper thighs, especially the vagina, vulva, cervix, and ano-rectal mucosae.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention may be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions designed for immediate release or sustained or slow release.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs appropriate topical compositions there may be cited for example gels, jellies, creams, pastes, emulsions, dispersions, ointments, films, sponges, foams, aerosols, powders, intravaginal rings or other intravaginal drug delivery systems, cervical caps, implants, patches, suppositories or pessaries for rectal, or vaginal application, vaginal or rectal or buccal tablets, mouthwashes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, an effective amount of the particular compound, optionally in addition salt form, as the active ingredient may be combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of administration. For example, in preparing the compositions for topical oral administration, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like, which are suitable for oral liquid preparations such as mouthwashes in the form of suspensions, emulsions and solutions. Solid carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin, diluents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like will be adequate in the case of tablets. Also included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations. In the compositions suitable for topical cutaneous administration, the carrier optionally comprises a suitable wetting agent, optionally combined with suitable additives of any nature in minor proportions, which additives do not introduce a significant deleterious effect on the skin. Said additives may facilitate the administration to the skin and/or may be helpful for preparing the desired compositions. These compositions may be administered in various ways, e.g., as a cream or gel.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe active ingredient may be present in the pharmaceutical formulations as a free agent or alternatively, encapsulated into drug carriers like liposomes, nanoparticles or cyclodextrins, which encapsulation results in an increased concentration of the compounds within the microbe target site. The active ingredient may also be present as nanoparticles.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiposomes may be present in the formulation which include, amongst others, distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC), distearoylphosphatidylglycerol (DSPG), distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine-polyethylene-glycol (DSPE-PEG), dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), dicetylphosphate (DP), cholesterol (CHOL), dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol (DPPG), and combinations thereof, such as distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC): distearoylphosphatidylglycerol (DSPG); within which the active ingredient is entrapped.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAppropriate cyclodextrins are α-, γ-, γ-cyclodextrins or ethers and mixed ethers thereof wherein one or more of the hydroxy groups of the anhydroglucose units of the cyclodextrin are substituted with C\n1-6\nalkyl, particularly methyl, ethyl or isopropyl, e.g. randomly methylated γ-CD; hydroxyC\n1-6\nalkyl, particularly hydroxyethyl, hydroxy-propyl or hydroxybutyl; carboxy C\n1-6\nalkyl, particularly carboxymethyl or carboxy-ethyl; C\n1-6\nalkylcarbonyl, particularly acetyl. Especially noteworthy as complexants and/or solubilizers are β-CD, randomly methylated β-CD, 2,6-dimethyl-β-CD, 2-hydroxyethyl-β-CD, 2-hydroxyethyl-β-CD, 2-hydroxypropyl-β-CD and (2-carboxymethoxy)propyl-β-CD, and in particular 2-hydroxypropyl-β-CD (2-HP-β-CD). Cyclodextrins are additionally useful in enhancing the solubility of the compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term mixed ether denotes cyclodextrin derivatives wherein at least two cyclodextrin hydroxy groups are etherified with different groups such as, for example, hydroxy-propyl and hydroxyethyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParticularly, the present compounds may be formulated as a gel formulation comprising:\n\n \n \n \n \n \na topically effective amount of a compound of the present invention;\n \na gel-forming compound;\n \na buffer;\n \na pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, preferably water;\n \noptionally a humectant; and\n \noptionally a preservative.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nTypical gel formulations can be prepared using natural or synthetic polymers as gelifying agents, and hydrophobic or hydrophilic liquids. Examples of gel-forming compounds commonly employed in gel formulations include polysaccharides which include cellulose derivatives, glycosaminoglycans, gums, starch (a-amylose or amylopectin), and chitosan; carboxyvinylic derivates, vinyl polymers such as polyethylenes, polyehtyelene glycols, e.g. polyethylene glycol 4500, Plastibase® (Plasticized Hydrocarbon Gel), polyacrylic acid, (Carbopols® family, e.g. Carbopol® 940), polymethacrylic acid, polyvinyl pyrrolidone and polyvinyl alcohol; polyacrylamide or polymethacrylamide polymers including clays such as bentonite, Veegum® (R.T Vanderbilt) and Laponite® (Laporte Industries); polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene or polyethylene oxides copolymers such as poloxamers, e.g. poloxamer 407, poloxamines; proteins, colloidal silica, soaps, silicones such as dimethylpolysiloxanes or dimeticone, hydrocarbonated bases (mixtures of parafine and vaselines).\n\n\n \n \n**Useful cellulose derivates include methyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUseful glycosaminoglycans include hyaluronic acid, chondroitin, chondroitin-4-sulfate, heparan sulfate and heparin. Useful gums include natural and artificial gums, tragacanth, carrageenan, pectin, agar, alginic acid, dextrans. The glycosaminoglycans may be used to enhance wound healing in combination with any other gel-forming polymer such as, for example, collagen, gelatin, fibronectin. A preferred gelifying agent is hydroxyethyl cellulose, which has additionally bioadhesive properties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConcentrations of the gel-forming compounds may be varied upon conditions such as the liquid/gel transition temperature, the physical properties sought for the gel and the pH used in the making of the formulations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGel forming compounds employed in the present invention are typically water-soluble polymers capable of forming a viscous aqueous solution, or non-water soluble, water-swellable polymers (e.g., collagen) that can also form a viscous solution and that gel upon contact with skin. Gelling agents suitable for use in the present invention should be stable over a wide pH range, especially over the normal acidic pH values found in the vagina.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBuffering agents are used in the gel formulation of this invention to maintain the pH of the vagina within its healthy acidic range (i.e., a pH of less than about 5 and more preferably in the range of about 3.2 to about 4.5) even in the presence of normal amounts of ejaculate. A normal acidic range in the vaginal milieu and environment assists in diminishing the activity of certain STD-causing microbes, including the HIV virus. Maintaining the normal vaginal milieu also assists in maintaining the body's natural defenses against certain STD-causing microorganisms. Examples of buffering agents include, without being limited to, lactic acid, phosphoric acid, sodium citrate, sodium hydroxide, sodium phosphate, sodium phosphate dibasic anhydrous, tartaric acid, triethanolamine, citric acid, potassium acid tartrate, benzoic acid, alginic acid, sorbic acid, fumaric acid, ascorbic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, edetic acid, ethylenediaminetetracetic acid, acetic acid, malic acid, and the like, preferably sodium hydroxide and lactic acid, the latter being additionally a preservative and having certain antimicrobial activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe acids may be added as free acids, hydrates, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Free acids can be converted to the corresponding salts in situ (i.e., within the vagina). It is generally preferred that several buffering agents are included in the gel of this invention to provide increased buffering capacity. Even more preferably, buffering agents comprise a combination of acid and hydrogen-accepting substance that occur naturally in the human female body that, when applied to the surface of the vagina, maintains the pH level thereon at approximately the pH level of a healthy vagina. Said acid(s) may be selected from the froup consisting of acetic acid, lactic acid, phosphoric acid and sulfuric acid, and combinations thereof. One of the characteristics common to each of said member in said group, is that each acid occurs naturally in the female body. Another common characteristic is each readily contributes to the formation of a buffering system, by temporarily donating hydrogen ion and accepting a cation to form a salt.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSaid hydrogen-accepting substance may be selected from the group consisting of potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate and calcium carbonate, and combinations thereof. One of the characteristics common to each of said member in said group, is that each substances is found naturally in the female body. Another common characteristic is each readily contributes to the formation of a buffering system, by temporarily accepting hydrogen ion and donating a cation to form a salt. Such salts may be selected from the group consisting of acetate, lactate, phosphate and sulfate, in combination with said cation from said hydrogen-accepting substance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe gels of this invention may also include, and preferably do include, humectants. Suitable humectants include, for example, glycerol, polyethylene glycols, propylene glycols, sorbitol, triacetin, and the like. Glycerol, which is the preferred humectant, is a buffer activating component due to its capability of water absortion, or other fluid, from the vaginal environment into the gel. It is believed that such fluid intake prevents the formation of a dry film on the gel when placed within the vagina, providing additional solvent to enhance the application of the gel formulation, or to otherwise enhance its functioning.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe gels of this invention may also include, and preferably do include, a preservative, which amongst other properties, extends the shelf life of the gel formulations. Suitable preservatives include, for example, benzoic acid, sodium benzoate, methyl paraben, ethyl paraben, butyl paraben, propyl paraben, benzylalkonium chloride, phenylmercuric nitrate, chlorhexidine, benzyl alcohol, phenethyl alcohol, propylene glycol, and the like. The preferred preservatives are methyl paraben, and propyl paraben, which both also contribute to the antimicrobial capacity of the gel.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe gels of this invention are prepared using conventional gel preparation techniques. It is desirable, however, to ensure that the buffering agents are solubilized in the final product and that the entrapment of air in the gel is avoided or at least kept to a minimum. To reduce the entrapment of air in the gel, it is generally preferred that the less hydrophilic agents are added in small increments. Alternatively, the gels of this invention can also be prepared in readily dispersable solid forms (e.g., powders, tablets, and the like) which can be converted to the desired gel consistency by action of aqueous based fluids external to or within the vagina when desired. As those skilled in the art will realize, the methods for preparing the gels of this invention can be modified for batch, semi continuous, or continuous operation so long as the resulting gels have the desired and beneficial properties described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe gel formulations can be combined with other active ingredients such as microbicides, antimicrobials, chemotherapeutic agents, antiinflammatory agents, spermicides or other appropriate drugs. Furthermore, microbicides or spermicides or both can be combined with liposomes (or other drug carriers) to prevent any disease of mucosae and/or skin. In addition, gel or liposome or other drug carriers formulations can also be used as carriers of vaccines against infections caused by pathogens or any disease. If desired, flavorants, scents, fragrances, and colorants can be incorporated into the gel so long as they do not interfere with the protection afforded by the gel. Indeed, incorporation of such flavorants, scents, fragrances, and colorants into the compositions of this invention may provide further protection by increasing the probability that the gel will be used during sexual activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the gel formulation is composed of compound B, hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), glycerol, methyl paraben, propyl paraben, lactic acid, sodium hydroxide (for reaching a pH around 4.5), and water.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the gel formulation comprises compound B, HEC with a concentration from about 0.5 to about 5% (w/w), glycerol with a concentration from about 1 to about 15% (w/w), methyl paraben with a concentration from about 0.02 to about 0.5% (w/w), propyl paraben with a concentration from about 0.005 to about 0.2% (w/w), lactic acid with a concentration from about 0.005 to about 0.5% (w/w), sodium hydroxide in sufficient quantity to achieve a pH of 4.5, and water.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the gel formulation comprises compound B, HEC with a concentration from about 1 to about 3% (w/w), glycerol with a concentration from about 3 to about 7% (w/w), methyl paraben with a concentration from about 0.1 to about 0.3% (w/w), propyl paraben with a concentration from about 0.01 to about 0.03% (w/w), lactic acid with a concentration from about 0.03 to about 0.07% (w/w), sodium hydroxide in sufficient quantity to achieve a pH of 4.5, and water.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, any of the above gel formulations comprise compound A as a microbicide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present topical formulations such as the gel formulations described herein are to be used for coating different types of mucosae such as vulvar, vaginal, cervical, ano-rectal, mouth, or skin to prevent the penetration of pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites, ectoparasites and mycoplasmas.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present topical formulations such as the gel formulations described herein could, for example, be applied into the vagina by hand, suppositories, or conventional tampon or syringe techniques. The method of administering or delivering the gel into the vagina is not critical so long as an effective amount of the gel is delivered into the vagina. The present topical formulations such as the gel formulations described herein may also be used for protection during anal intercourse and can be applied using similar techniques.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor vaginal heterosexual intercourse, the present topical formulations such as the gel formulations described herein may be applied into the vagina prior to intercourse. For anal intercourse (heterosexual or homosexual), the present topical formulations such as the gel formulations described herein may be inserted into the rectum prior to intercourse. For either vaginal or anal intercourse, the present topical formulations such as the gel formulations described herein may also act as a lubricant. For added protection it is generally preferred that the present topical formulations such as the gel formulations described herein be applied before intercourse or other sexual activity and that, if appropriate, a condom be used. For even further protection, the present topical formulations such as the gel formulations described herein can be applied as soon as possible after completion of the sexual activity. Although application only after the sexual activity is less recommended, it would still be desirable afterwards if the application was not performed prior to the sexual activity for any reason (e.g., in cases of rape).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present topical formulations such as the gel formulations described herein are highly suited for the protection of women (as well as their partners) with or without requiring the partner's knowledge of the application of these gels. In addition, reliance on the partner's claim of being STD-free, concretely HIV-free, would not be necessary, neither the agreement to use condoms or other barrier devices for protection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe gel formulations of the present invention are additionally advantageous because they do not significantly affect or inhibit the growth characteristics of the normal vaginal flora or otherwise significantly irritate the vaginal tissue when used at inhibitory, noncytotoxic, or clinical concentrations. Significant inhibition or modifications of the vaginal flora or other irritations can lead to increased risks of infections (both STD and non-STD types) frequently mediated by ulcerations in the vagina, unusual discharges, general discomforts, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntravaginal rings (IVR) are as well suitable drug delivery systems for the vaginal administration of the compounds of the present invention. IVRs comprise the compound(s) dispersed throughout a biocompatible elastomeric system that forms the delivery device, which preferentially takes the form of a ring. These elastomers preferably include hydrophobic material, such as silicones (organo polysiloxanes including dimethylpolysiloxanes), polyethylene-co-poly (vinyl acetate), styrene-butadiene-styrene block copolymers, polyphosphazenes, poly(isoprene), poly (isobutylene), polybutadienes, polyurethanes, nitrile rubbers, neoprene rubbers or mixtures thereof. Said IVRs can be formulated as sustained-released microbicides, resulting in an extended and stable contact time between the compound and target pathogens and cells. IVR formulations have already been described in the literature, WO02076426 all of which is herein incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to increase the residence time of the topical pharmaceutical composition at the site of administration, it may be advantageous to include a bioadhesive in the different drug delivery systems, in particular a bioadhesive polymer. A bioadhesive may be defined as a material that adheres to a living biological surface such as for example a mucus membrane or skin tissue. The term bioadhesive is well-known to the person skilled in the art. Thus, the present invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and as active ingredient a microbicidal effective amount of a compound of the invention characterized in that the pharmaceutical composition is bioadhesive to the site of application. Preferably, the site of application is the vagina, vulva, cervix, rectum, mouth or skin, most preferred is the vagina and the vulva.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of bioadhesives which may be used in the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise polyacrylic acid derivatives, such as for example carbopol or polycarbophil, e.g. carbopol 934P, carbopol 940, polycarbophil AA1; cellulose ether derivatives such as for example hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, chitosan; natural polymers such as for example alginates, tragacanth, inulin; pregelatinized starch; polysaccharide gums such as xanthan gum, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, formulations of the present invention may be in the form of implants, patches, pads, injections or other preparations for achieving a percutaneous and subcutaneous delivery of the compounds to the cervical, vaginal and rectal tissues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs already indicated within the gel specifications, the present compounds may be used in all the suitable formulations, alone or in combination with other active ingredients, such as antivirals, antibiotics, immunomodulators or vaccines. They may also be used alone or in combination with other prophylactic agents for the prevention of viral infections. The present compounds may be used in vaccines and methods for protecting individuals against viral infections over an extended period of time. The compounds may be employed in such vaccines either alone or together with other compounds of this invention or together with other anti-viral agents in a manner consistent with the conventional utilization of reverse transcriptase inhibitors in vaccines. Thus, the present compounds may be combined with pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvants conventionally employed in vaccines and administered in prophylactically effective amounts to protect individuals over an extended period of time against HIV infection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntiviral compounds which may be used in combination with the compounds of the invention may be known antiretroviral compounds such as suramine, pentamidine, thymopentin, castanospermine, dextran (dextran sulfate), foscarnet-sodium (trisodium phosphono formate); nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, e.g. zidovudine (3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine, AZT), didanosine (2′,3′-dideoxyinosine; ddI), zalcitabine (dideoxycytidine, ddC) or lamivudine (2′-3′-dideoxy-3′-thiacytidine, 3TC), stavudine (2′,3′-didehydro-3′-deoxythymidine, d4T), abacavir and the like; non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors such as nevirapine (11-cyclopropyl-5,11-dihydro-4-methyl-6H-dipyrido-[3,2-b:2′,3′-e][1,4]diazepin-6-one), efavirenz, delavirdine, and the like; phosphonate reverse transcriptase inhibitors, e.g. tenofovir and the like; compounds of the TIBO (tetrahydro-imidazo[4,5,1-jk][1,4]-benzodiazepine-2(1H)-one and thione)-type e.g. (S)-8-chloro-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-5-methyl-6-(3-methyl-2-butenyl)imidazo-[4,5,1-jk][1,4]benzo-diazepine-2(1H)-thione; compounds of the α-APA (α-anilino phenyl acetamide) type e.g. α-[(2-nitrophenyl)amino]-2,6-dichlorobenzene-acetamide and the like; inhibitors of trans-activating proteins, such as TAT-inhibitors, e.g. RO-5-3335, or REV inhibitors, and the like; protease inhibitors e.g. indinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, lopinavir (ABT-378), nelfinavir, amprenavir, TMC-126, BMS-232632, VX-175 and the like; fusion inhibitors, e.g. T-20, T-1249 and the like; CXCR4 receptor antagonists, e.g. AMD-3100 and the like; inhibitors of the viral integrase; ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors, e.g. hydroxyurea and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCombinations may as well exert a synergistic effect in inhibiting HIV replication when components of the combination act on different or same sites of HIV replication, preferably on different sites. The use of such combinations may reduce the dosage of a given conventional antiretroviral agent which would be required for a desired prophylactic effect as compared to when that agent is administered as a single active ingredient. These combinations reduce potential of resistance to single agent, while minimizing any associated toxicity. These combinations may also increase the efficacy of the conventional agent without increasing the associated toxicity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, the compounds of the present invention may also be administered in combination with art-known microbicides, consequently potentiating the prophylactic effect. They can block the infection by creating a barrier between the pathogen, in this case the Human Immunodeficiency Virus, and the site at which transmission will take place, e.g. vulva, vagina; they can kill or immobilize the pathogen; they can prevent a virus from replicating once it has infected the cells lining the site of transmission, e.g. the cells that line the vaginal wall. Examples of microbicides are:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAntibiotic peptides: small protein molecules that form part of the body's first line of defense against infection. These peptides line every surface of the body—eyes, skin, lungs, tongue and intestinal tract—and kill bacteria within minutes of contact. Thus, if applied at the site of potential infection of HIV, peptides may kill pathogens before they cause infection.\n \nAntibodies: isolated antibodies that counteract HIV are available in the literature. They may be appropriately combined with the compounds of the present invention to prevent HIV infection.\n \npH regulators, especially for the vagina. A natural vaginal environment is too acidic for HIV to survive, but semen decreases its acidity, allowing HIV to survive. pH regulators regulate the natural acidity of the vagina making it inhospitable for the HIV. Said regulators encompass the use of Lactobacillus bacteria that produce hydrogen peroxide and thereby help to keep the vaginal environment healthy and acidic. The acidic polymer BufferGel (ReProtect, LLC) is another example of a pH regulator which has in addition spermicidal activity.\n \nDetergents and surfactants: these compounds are able to disrupt the outer shell of viruses and therefore are useful as microbicide and they can be combined with the compounds to prevent HIV infection. Examples of such detergents and surfactants are nonoxynol-9 and octoxynol-9, but all detergents and surfactants that are commonly used in shampoos, toothpastes and cleaning solutions, contact lens solutions may be equally suitable.\n \nCoatings for the pathogen, such as Pro-2000 Gel which contains a synthetic polymer that binds to HIV, disrupting the binding of the virus to target cells.\n \nCoatings for the site of transmission, such as for example gels. These products may prevent HIV from entering the cells by covering the site of transmission, e.g. the vaginal and vulvar epithelium. Examples, including the gel preparations described above, encompass sulphated and sulphonated polymers such as PC-515 (carrageenan), dextrin 2 sulphate, secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI), which binds to the target cells so that they are not accessible to the virus, cyanovirin-N which also binds to the cell, prohibiting cell fusion with HIV.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn the compositions of the present invention, one or more or all of the above-listed microbicides may be combined with a compound of the invention. Thus, the present invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the present invention and further comprising one or more components wherein the components are selected from antibiotic peptides, antibodies, pH regulators, detergents or surfactants, coatings for the pathogen, coatings for the site of administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne particular example of the combination of microbicides is the combination of compounds of the invention with cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP) and/or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate (HPMCP). CAP and its derivates are excipients which exhibit an additional microbicide effect. CAP formulations have already been described in the literature, EP1030547, U.S. Pat. No. 6,165,493, by Neurath et al., all of which are herein incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention relates also to a pharmaceutical composition as outlined hereinabove further comprising a spermicidal compound. Said compositions are able to prevent at the same time conception and HIV infection. Suitable spermicides are for example nonoxynol-9, octoxynol-9, menfegol, benzalkonium chloride, N-docasanol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThose of skill in the prophylaxis of HIV-infection could determine the microbicidal effective amount from the test results presented here and may range from about 1 ng to about 10 mg, in particular from about 10 ng to about 1 mg, more in particular from about 100 ng to about 100 μg and preferably from about 500 ng to about 50 μg of active ingredient per application or unit dose, in particular an application or unit dose of an immediate release formulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt may be appropriate to apply the required dose as unit dosage forms. The volume of a unit dose, in particular the unit dose of an immediate release formulation, whether or not in a unit dosage form, may range in the case of a topical formulation from about 10 μl up to about 25 ml of topical formulation and in particular from about 1 ml up to about 10 ml of topical formulation. In the case of a gel or a cream for instance, a convenient unit dose could range between about 1 ml and about 5 ml.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor instance in the case of topical formulations, in particular topical formulations for immediate release, as mentioned herein, e.g. a gel, a cream and the like, the active ingredient may be present in a concentration ranging from about 1 nM up to about 10 mM, in particular from about 10 nM up to about 1 mM, more in particular from about 100 nM up to about 100 μM and preferably from about 1 μM to about 100 μM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is evident that said effective amount may be lowered or increased depending on the particular compound being used, on the response of the treated subject and/or depending on the evaluation of the physician prescribing the compounds of the instant invention.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following examples are intended to illustrate the present invention.\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\nIn Vitro Evaluation of the Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors Compound B as HIV Microbicide\n\n\nCell-Free and Cell-Associated HIV Strains\n\n\n \n \n \nFor experiments with CEM T cells, we used the lymphotropic SI/X4 HIV strain HTLV-III\nB\n, originally obtained from R. C. Gallo and M. Popovic (NIH, Bethesda, Md.). For experiments with monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MO-DC), the monotropic NSI/R5 HIV strain Ba-L, kindly provided by the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program (Rockville, Md.) was used. Ba-L stocks were grown and tittered on PHA/IL-2-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in complete medium, containing RPMI-1640 (Bio-Whittaker, Verviers, Belgium) and 10% bovine calf serum (Hyclone, Utah, US) (Peden K. Virological and Molecular Genetic Techniques for Studies of Established HIV Isolates. 1995, 21-45). The supernatant of these cultures were directly used as cell-free virus to infect MO-DC. To prepare cell-associated HIV Ba-L, non-stimulated PBMC (2×10\n6 \ncells/ml) were incubated overnight with 10\n−2 \nMOI (=multiplicity of infection) of HIV Ba-L in complete medium. Afterwards, cells were extensively washed, frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed on the day of infection.\n\n\n \n \nHIV Antigen Detection after Primary Culture and Calculation of EC50 Value\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHIV antigen was detected using an in-house developed ELISA assay, of which the characteristics have been described (Beirnaert E, Willems B, Peeters M, Bouckaert A, Heyndrickx L, Zhong P et al. Design and Evaluation of an in-House HIV-1 (Group M and O), SIVmnd and SIVcpz Antigen Capture Assay. J Virol Methods 1998, 73: 65-70). The lower detection limit is about 200 pg/ml and the upper limit is about 25,000 pg/ml, as determined using a standard curve of Ba-L stock dilutions with known p24 content. The 50% Effective Concentration (EC50) was calculated by plotting HIV Ag concentration against drug concentration, followed by regression analysis on the linear part of the curve.\n\n\n \nMeasuring 50% Effective and 50% Cytotoxic Concentrations in CEM T Cells\n\n\n \n \n \nAs a reference system, CEM T cells (obtained from the American Type culture Collection in Rockville, Md.) were used under previously standardized conditions (Balzarini J, et al. AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses 10 Apr. 2000, 16: 517-528). Briefly, cells were suspended at 250,000 cells/ml in RPMI-1640, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM L-glutamine and 0.075% NaHCO\n3 \nand infected with HTLV-III\nB \nat ˜20 TCID\n50\n. 100 μl of a 5-fold dilution series of the drugs were immediately added to 100 μl of the infected cells in 200-μl well plates. After 4 to 5 days of incubation at 37° C., the cultures were examined for syncytium formation. The EC\n50 \nis the concentration required to inhibit syncytium formation by 50%. Cytotoxicity was evaluated and given as CC50 values, which is the concentration at which the viability of the CEM cells is decreased by 50%.\n\n\n \nGeneration of Monocyte-Derived Interstitial-Type Dendritic Cells (MO-DC) and T Cells\n\n\n \n \n \nMonocytes and lymphocytes were separated from buffy coat PBMC by counter-flow elutriation, as previously described (Van Herrewege et al. AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses 10 Oct. 2002, 18: 1091-1102). Monocytes were further differentiated to MO-DC by culture at 37° C. and 5% CO2 during 7 days in complete medium, supplemented with 20 ng/ml GM-CSF and IL-4 (Immunosource, Zoersel, Belgium) (Sallusto et al. J Exp Med 1 Apr. 1994, 179: 1109-1118. Romani et al. J Exp Med 1 Jul. 1994, 180: 83-93. Geissmann F, et al. Exp Med 16 Mar. 1998, 187: 961-966). The lymphocyte fraction was frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed on the day of infection. CD4(+) T cells were purified by positive selection, using a CD4(+) isolation kit (Dynal, Oslo, Norway), as described (Vanham et al. AIDS 20 Oct. 2000, 14: 2299-2311. Vanham et al. AIDS 18 Aug. 2000, 14: 1874-1876).\n\n\n \n \nPre-Treatment of HIV with Drugs, with or without Continued Treatment of MO-DC/CD4(+) T Cell Co-Cultures after Infection\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCell-free HIV Ba-L was pre-incubated with a serial dilution of drug, ranging from 10,000 to 0.1 nM (final concentration), for 1 hour at 37° C. MO-DC were infected with drug-treated HIV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10\n−3\n. After 2 hours (at 37° C.), MO-DC were washed (6×) and suspended at 4×10\n5 \ncells/ml. 50 μl of MO-DC were dispensed in a 96-well cup, together with 50 μl of autologous CD4(+) T cells (2×10\n6 \ncells/ml) and 100 μl of complete medium or 100 μl of drug (at the same concentration as for the pre-incubation). Half of the culture medium was refreshed twice weekly with complete medium, with or without drug. After 2 weeks of primary culture, supernatants were analysed by ELISA and cells were used for secondary cultures to check viral rescue. For experiments with cell-associated HIV, a similar set-up was used except that pre-incubated, cell-associated virus was washed before addition of MO-DC/CD4(+) T cells and remained present during the MO-DC/CD4(+) T cell co-culture.\n\n\n \n24 Hours Drug Treatment of MO-DC/CD4(+) T Cell Co-Cultures During HIV Infection\n\n\n \n \n \nTo evaluate the effect of a 24-hours treatment, MO-DC and autologous CD4(+) T cells were suspended in complete medium at 4×10\n5\n, resp. 2×10\n6 \ncells/ml. Fifty μl of MO-DC and 50 μl of CD4(+) T cells were dispensed in a 96-well cup, together with 50 μl of cell-associated or cell-free virus (10\n−3 \nMOI) and 50 μl of complete medium or 50 μl of a serial dilution of drug. After 24-hours (37° C., 5% CO\n2\n), cells were washed (3×) and incubated for 2 weeks. Half of the culture medium was refreshed twice weekly with complete medium (without drug). After 2 weeks of primary culture, supernatants were analysed by ELISA and cells were used for secondary cultures to check viral rescue.\n\n\n \nDetection of Viral Rescue: Secondary Culture and PCR Analysis\n\n\n \n \n \nPBMC were isolated from donor buffy coats and cultured for 2 days in complete medium supplemented with 5 ng/ml IL-2 (Immunosource, Zoersel, Belgium) and 0.5 μg/ml PHA (Murex, Dartford, England). After 2 weeks of primary culture, MO-DC/CD4(+) T cell co-cultures were washed (3×) and secondary cultures were set-up by adding 1×10\n5 \nPHA/IL-2 activated PBMC per cup. Half of the culture medium was replaced every 3-4 days with IL-2 containing medium (without drug) and supernatants as well as cells were harvested after 2 additional weeks. Supernatants were tested for HIV-Ag in ELISA. Cells were processed for HIV DNA measurement, using a PCR-based HIV proviral DNA quantitation kit, developed from Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor™ Test, version 1.5 (Roche Molecular Systems, Branchburg, USA), the modifications of which have been described (Christopherson et al. J Clin Microbiol 2000, 38: 630-634). A lower threshold of 10 HIV copies per 10\n6 \ncells was confirmed by using 8E5/LAV cells, containing 1 copy of proviral DNA per cell (kindly provided by the Centralized Facility for AIDS Reagents, Potters Bar, UK)\n\n\n \nEvaluation of the Immune Suppressive Activity and Cellular Toxicity of Compound B in MO-DC/CD4(+) T Cell Co-Cultures\n\n\n \n \n \nThe immune suppressive activity of compound B was measured in mixed leukocyte cultures (MLC), with MO-DC as stimulators and allogenic CD4(+) T cells as responders. Cultures of 3×10\n3 \nMO-DC and 100×10\n3 \nT cells were set-up in 6-fold in a 96-well plate, in the presence or absence of a dilution series of compound B. In a first part of experiments, compound B was removed after 24 hours by washing and cells were cultured for an additional 4 days. In a second part of experiments, compound B remained present during the 5-day culture period. In both set-ups, 1 μCi of [methyl-\n3\nH]thymidine (TRA.120 from Amersham Pharmacia, Buckinghamshire, U.K.) was added to each well at the fifth day of culture. Plates were harvested 7 hours later and [methyl-\n3\nH]thymidine incorporation was measured in a scintillation counter (Top Count™, Can berra-Packard, Zellik, Belgium) and expressed as counts per minute (CPM). The Immune Suppressive Concentration (ISC\n50\n) is defined as the drug concentration inhibiting 50% of the lymphocyte proliferation. Cellular toxicity was evaluated microscopically by eosine staining of co-cultures of MO-DC and allogeneic CD4(+) T cells, cultured for 5 days in the presence of a dilution series of drug. Part of the harvested cells was also used for flowcytometric analysis of lymphocyte blast formation and apopoptosis, based on forward and side scatter.\n\n\n \nReference Data on Antiviral Activity and Cellular Toxicity of Compound B\n\n\n \n \n \nThe CEM T cell line was used as a reference to determine the antiviral activity of compound B. As shown in Table 1, compound B was active in the nanomolar range and showed a low toxicity. Next to antiviral activity in CEM T cells, inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transriptase activity was measured in a cell-free assay, in which the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of said compound is indicated (FIG. 1). The CEM system, using a lab T cell-line and the SI/X4 labstrain HTLV-IIIb, was not directly relevant to sexual transmission, where primary T cells, dendritic cells and NSI/R5 viruses are involved. Therefore, we focussed on prevention of NSI/R5 HIV infection in MO-DC/CD4(+) T cell co-cultures.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntiviral activity, cytotoxicity and HIV-1 RT inhibitory\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncapacity of compound B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nCC50\n\n\nIC50\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrug\n\n\nTreatment\n\n\nHIV\n\n\nEC50 (nM)\na\n \n\n\n(nM)\nb\n \n\n\n(nM)\nc\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\ncompound B\n\n\nContinuous\n\n\nHTLV-IIIb\n\n\n1\n\n\n1.367\n\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \na\nEC50: 50% Effective Concentration, concentration required to inhibit syncytium formation of HTLV-IIIb infected CEM T cells by 50%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nb\nCC50: 50% Cytotoxic Concentration, concentration at which the viability of CEM T cells is decreased by 50%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nc\nIC50: 50% Inhibitory Concentration, concentration that inhibits HIV-1 reverse transcriptase activity by 50%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDrug Treatment of MO-DC/CD4(+) T Cell Co-Cultures Prevented HIV Integration\n\n\n \n \n \nIn preliminary experiments the HIV Ba-L virus was pretreated for 1 hour with up to 10,000 nM of compound B. The drug remained present during the 2 hours incubation of the virus with the MO-DC, but it was thoroughly washed away before addition of autologous CD4(+) T cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to study the maximal effect of the drug, pre-treatment of the virus and treatment of the cells during infection was combined with further treatment during the entire primary culture period of 2 weeks. An example of the inhibitory effects of compound B on infection with cell-associated virus is shown in Table 2. Compound B blocked infection in the primary cultures already at 10 nM, but addition of PHA/IL-2 blasts revealed that 100 nM was needed to completely block infection and prevent proviral integration. When cell-free virus was used for infection, continuous treatment with 10 nM of compound B sufficed to completely block HIV infection, also during secondary culture (Table 3).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNext, it was investigated whether drug treatment during the first 24 hours of the primary culture could suffice to prevent viral infection and integration, as measured by ELISA and PCR respectively. As compared to continuous treatment, compound B showed to block infection at 1 log higher concentrations as used for the continuous treatment (Table 3).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInhibition of infection of MO-DC/CD4(+) T Cell co-cultures with\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncell-associated HIV Ba-L\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHIV Antigen (number\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nof positive wells)\nc\n \n\n\nHIV proviral DNA\nd\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrug\n\n\nConc (nM)\n\n\n1° Cult.\na\n \n\n\n2° Cult.\nb\n \n\n\n(2° Cult.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncompound B\n\n\n10,000\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\nNeg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1,000\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\nNeg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n100\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\nNeg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n10\n\n\n0\n\n\n3\n\n\n4.74\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo drug\n\n\n0\n\n\n6\n\n\n6\n\n\n4.85\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \na\nCell-associated HIV Ba-L was pre-incubated with drug, washed, and added to co-cultures of MO-DC and autologous CD4+ T cells.

Drug concentrations that prevent replicative HIV infection, as measured by ELISA of culture supernatants and PCR of cells after 2° culture, are shown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nb\nThe concentration of 10,000 nM was not used in this part of the experiment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCompound B had a Low Cellular Toxicity in CEM T Cells and a Favourable Therapeutic Index in MO-DC/CD4(+) T Cell Co-cultures\n\n\n \n \n \nCellular toxicity (CC50 value) in reference CEM T cells was at 1,367 nM for compound B (Table 1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe immune suppressive activity of compound B was evaluated in mixed leukocyte cultures with MO-DC as stimulators and allogenic CD4(+) T cells as responders. If drug was present during the whole culture period, the 50% Immune Suppressive Concentration (ISC50) was about 1,500 nM. If the drug was only present during the first 24 hours, the ISC50 increased to almost 25,000 nM (Table 4). Thus, the immune suppressive activity of compound B was clearly less suppressive in the 24 hours treatment as compared to continuous treatment. In order to fully evaluate the relation of anti-viral and immune suppressive activity, the 50% antiviral activity (or EC50) values were calculated on primary drug-treated cultures of HIV-infected autologous MO-DC/CD4(+) T cell co-cultures and the therapeutic indices (TI) were determined. The data of Table 4 shows that compound B has a favourable TI as measured in this model of primary target cells of sexual transmission.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview of the Antiviral and Immune Suppressive Activity of\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncompound B in co-cultures of MO-DC/CD4(+) T cells\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nEC50\n\n\nISC50\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrug\n\n\nTreatment\n\n\nHIV\n\n\n(nM)\na\n \n\n\n(nM)\nb\n \n\n\nTI\nc\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComp.

Fifty percent inhibition of blast formation was observed at 3,916 nM. The 50% death rate of T cells was calculated at 54,222 nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn conclusion, prevention of HIV infection was possible against both cell-free and cell-associated NSI/R5 virus and a 24 hours treatment was sufficient. Compound B showed a high therapeutic index, based on its relative weak immune suppressive and potent anti-viral activity. These results confirmed the use of compound B as microbicide.\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\nHuman SCID Animal Model\n\n\n \n \n \nIn order to mimic the in vivo transmission that occurs in humans, a hu-SCID animal model of vaginal transmission of HIV for the evaluation of vaginal microbicides was used (Di Fabio et al., AIDS 2001, 15, 2231-2238). Gels made up of carbopol 940 or hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), two water soluble polymers, were prepared containing Compound B in different concentrations (0.225 mM; 0.0225 mM or 0.00225 mM). Animals received a single intravaginal application of 25 μl of gel containing Compound B, 15-20 minutes prior to a non invasive vaginal challenge with 2×10\n6 \nhuman peripheral blood lymphocytes PBL (hu-PBL) previously infected in vitro with non-syncitium (NSI) strains of HIV-1 (SF162 and 1/BX08). Cell to cell transmission was assessed by p24 production and by quantitative PCR. As a result of this study with Compound B, systemic infection was successfully inhibited.\n\n\n \nExample 3\n\n\nIn Vitro Model Based on T-Cell Derived Jurkat-tat Cells (PM-1)\n\n\n \n \n \nDirect antiviral activity was demonstrated in a model using Jurkat-tat cells. HIV-1\nRF \n(10\n3\nTCID\n50\n) immobilised into 96-well coated plates were treated with test compound B for 1 hour at 37° C., compound was subsequently removed by washing with 4 volumes of PBS before co-culture with indicator cells for 8 days. Protection of infection was provided at the 100 nM concentration. Additionally, protection of infection was demonstrated at 10 nM in a parallel setup were virus was pretreated prior to addition of cells and without removal of the compound.\n\n\n \nExample 4\n\n\nCervical Explant Model\n\n\n \n \n \nCompound B, at a concentration of 10 nM, was able to block infection of the tissue and at a concentration of 100 nM the compound could prevent transfer of infectious virus from migratory dendritic cells to co-cultured T-cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompound demonstrated good efficacy against primary HIV strains (X4, CCR5 and X4/R5) in relevant cell lines for a vaginal/rectal microbicide indication:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn cervical epithelial cells (ME180) exposed to the compound during either 1 hr, 24 hrs or 5 days after which drug was removed by washing, viability of the cells was assessed with an MTT assay. Data showed no toxicity at the 50 μM concentration and some reduction of viability at 100 μM.\n\n\n \nExample 5\n\n\nBiochemical Characterization of the Interaction Between Compound B and HIV-1 Reverse Transcriptase\n\n\n \n \n \nIn order to investigate the nature of the interaction between compound B and HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (HIV-1 RT), the inhibition of the RNA-dependent DNA polymerization reaction was investigated under steady state conditions. In a first experiment, the reaction velocity was determined in the presence of different concentrations of compound B and different concentrations of dGTP while the concentration of the p(rC)p(dG) complex was constant. The result showed that the binding of compound B to HIV-1 RT is non-competitive against dGTP with a Km value of 2.51 μM and a Ki of 0.033 μM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a second experimental the reaction velocity was determined in the presence of different concentrations of compound B and different concentrations of p(rC)p(dG) while the concentration of the substrate was constant. The result showed that the binding of compound B to HIV-1 RT is also non-competitive against p(rC)p(dG) with a Km value of 10.3 μM and a Ki of 0.028 μM. Taken together this means that the binding of compound B on HIV-1 RT is independent from the binding of nucleotide and independent from the binding of primer/template.\n\n\n \nExample 6\n\n\nCompatibility with Lactobacilli and Normal Vaginal Flora\n\n\n \n \n \nCompatibility with lactobacilli and normal vaginal flora is an important requirement for a vaginal microbicide. Activity on pathogens of sexual transmitted diseases is an additional advantage. In in vitro tests for antibacterial activity of compound B, the following susceptibilities were found:\n\n \n \n \n \n \n33 different Lactobacillus species isolated from recto-vaginal cultures of pregnant women were studied. Results showed a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC\n50\n) of >32 mg/L\n \n \nHemophilus ducreyi \nwas inhibited by the compound with a MIC\n50 \nof 1 mg/L and a MIC\n90 \nof 2 mg/L\n \nSome \nNeisseria gonorrhoea \nstrains were inhibited at clinical relevant concentrations.\n \n \n \n\n\nExample 7\n\n\nRabbit Vaginal Irritation test\n\n\n \n \n \nSeveral formulations of the compound were used to exclude any irritation in a Rabbit Vaginal Irritation test. 24 hours after the application of 1 ml of gel/cream at different concentrations (0.1M, 0.9 mM, 0.45 mM and 0.225 mM), vaginal epithelium was carefully examined macroscopically and microscopically. Microscopic slides of parafinized samples of different parts of the cervico-vagina were stained and analysed histologically. Macroscopic and microscopic scores obtained indicated that the formulations tested were well tolerated.\n\n\n \nExample 8\n\n\nWhite Rabbit Vaginal Irritation and Toxicity Study\n\n\n \n \n \nGel formulations of the compound B at different concentrations were used to study the exclusion of any irritation in a Rabbit Vaginal Irritation test. 10 days after the application of the gel formulations onto 6 different rabbit groups, vaginal and cervical epithelium were carefully examined by a pathologist macroscopically and histollogically.

The American Diabetes Association estimates approximately 7% of the United States population suffers from this disease and that 1 out of every 10 dollars spent on healthcare in the U.S. is spent on diabetes and its complications. Type 1 diabetes generally results from the body's failure to produce insulin. Type 2 diabetes is the more prevalent type of diabetes and generally results from insulin resistance combined with a relative insulin deficiency. Additionally, there are millions of Americans who can be said to have prediabetes, that is, higher than normal blood glucose levels but not yet high enough to be diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nType 2 diabetes is characterized by fasting and postprandial hyperglycemia and by relative insulin insufficiency. Hyperglycemia may cause long-term microvascular and macrovascular complications, such as nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy, and peripheral vascular disease. In addition, Type 2 diabetes is a comorbid disease that frequently compounds hyperlipidemia, atherosclerosis and hypertension. Hyperlipidemia is a primary risk factor for cardiovascular disease due to atherosclerosis. Obesity is a well known common risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis, stroke, hypertension and Type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes causes significant morbidity and mortality at considerable expense to patients, their families and society. Furthermore, the incidence of Type 2 diabetes worldwide is increasing such that Type 2 diabetes is now considered to be a worldwide epidemic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA number of therapies for the treatment of Type II diabetes are in use. A change in diet along with an increase in exercise and weight loss is considered a first line of treatment. However, this may not result in sufficient control of blood glucose levels resulting in the use of medications to help control glucose levels. These medications include insulin, sulfonylureas, meglitinides, biguanides, thiazolidinediones, DPP-4 inhibitors, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, amylin analogs and incretin mimetics. These medications may be used singly or in combination and may result in reduced glucose levels. However, these medications still may not cause a drop in glucose levels to what would be considered normal or the effect may wear off over time. Some medications may lower glucose levels too much, resulting in a dangerous hypoglycemic episode. Insulin, amylin and incretin mimetics need to be injected, often numerous times a day. Other side effects include weight gain, nausea, and diarrhea.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGPR119 is a class 1 G-protein-coupled receptor which has received attention due to evidence that modulation of the GRP119 receptor may produce favorable effects on glucose homeostasis, food intake, body weight gain and β-cell preservation, any or all of which effects may be useful in the treatment of both diabetes and obesity (\nBr. J. Pharm. \n2007 1-6).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe GPR119 receptor and isoforms have been identified in mammalian species including human, rat, mouse, hamster, chimpanzee, rhesus monkey, cattle and dog. The pancreas has been identified as the major site of mRNA expression in the human, with some expression also seen in the gastrointestinal tract. The expression of GPR119 in the pancreas and particularly in the pancreatic β-cells led to the hypothesis that the GPR119 receptor could have effects upon insulin secretion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe discovery of two endogenous ligands, lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and oleoylethanolamide (OEA) as well as more potent GPR119 agonists have led to the characterization of GPR119 as both an insulin and incretin (GLP-1 and GIP) secretagogue receptor capable of lowering plasma glucose and thereby facilitating glycemic control without the risk of hypoglycemia (Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm 2005 744-751, Cell Metabolism 2006 167-175, Endocrinolgy 2007, 2601-9, Endocrinology, 2008, Epub ahead of print). GPR119 knockout animals have shown that both insulin and incretin secretion induced by GPR119 agonists are dependent upon GPR119 receptor. In addition, it has been shown that GPR119 agonists decrease food intake resulting in weight loss in Sprague Dawley rats. Taken together, GPR119 is a novel mechanism by which glycemic control may be facilitated with the added benefit of weight loss.\n\n\n \nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIn brief, this invention is generally directed to new compounds, as well as to methods for their preparation and use, and to pharmaceutical compositions containing the same.

In general, the compounds of structure (I) above may be made by the following reaction schemes, wherein all substituents are as defined above unless indicated otherwise.\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds are prepared by N-arylation of a cyclic amino alcohol (typically by displacement of a haloaromatic by nucleophilic aromatic substitution), followed by oxidation of the alcohol to the ketone with an oxidant such as TPAP and NMO. Reaction with hydroxylamine then leads to the oxime, which can then be reacted with a halo cyclic amine to give the final product.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds can also be prepared by coupling a cyclic amino alcohol with 2-hydroxy-isoindole-1,3-dione under Mitsunobu conditions followed by the deprotection of the phthalimide with hydrazine. The hydroxylamine is then reacted with the Boc-protected cyclic amino ketone and the amine is deprotected in acidic conditions to generate the free secondary amine. Compound (I) may be generated in a number of ways including displacement of a haloaromatic by nucleophilic aromatic substitution, Buckwald coupling with a haloaromatic or by coupling with an aryl boronic acid.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the hydroxylamine obtained can be reacted with the cyclic amino aryl ketone (prepared as shown previously) in ethanol at reflux.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe hydroxylamine can be reacted with the free amino cyclo ketone to give the oxime. The amine can then be arylated as described previously and the N-Boc can be deprotected to allow derivatization by, for instance, displacement of a haloaromatic by nucleophilic aromatic substitution or, reaction with an electrophilic alkylating agent, reductive amination with an aldehyde or Buckwald coupling with a haloaromatic\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the phthalimide and boc protected intermediate can be sequentially deprotected, first the N-Boc then the N-phthalimide to give the amino hydroxylamine which can be reacted with the Boc amino cyclic ketone. The free amine can be derivatized as described previously, then the N-boc can be deprotected and the free amine arylated as described previously.\n\n\n \nTERMS AND DEFINITIONS\n\n\n \n \n \nTerms not specifically defined herein should be given the meanings that would be given to them by one of skill in the art in light of the disclosure and the context. As used in the specification, however, unless specified to the contrary, the following terms have the meaning indicated and the following conventions are adhered to.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “compound(s) according to this invention”, “compound(s) of formula (I)”, “compound(s) of the invention”, “GPR199 receptor agonist(s) according to the invention” and the like denote the compounds of the formula (I) according to the present invention including their tautomers, stereoisomers and mixtures thereof and the salts thereof, in particular the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and the solvates and hydrates of such compounds, including the solvates of such tautomers, stereoisomers and salts thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “treatment” and “treating” embrace both preventative, i.e. prophylactic, or therapeutic, i.e. curative and/or palliative, treatment. Thus the terms “treatment” and “treating” comprise therapeutic treatment of patients having already developed said condition, in particular in manifest form. Therapeutic treatment may be symptomatic treatment in order to relieve the symptoms of the specific indication or causal treatment in order to reverse or partially reverse the conditions of the indication or to stop or slow down progression of the disease. Thus the compositions and methods of the present invention may be used for instance as therapeutic treatment over a period of time as well as for chronic therapy. In addition the terms “treatment” and “treating” comprise prophylactic treatment, i.e. a treatment of patients at risk to develop a condition mentioned hereinbefore, thus reducing said risk.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen this invention refers to patients requiring treatment, it relates primarily to treatment in mammals, in particular humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “therapeutically effective amount” means an amount of a compound of the present invention that (i) treats or prevents the particular disease or condition, (ii) attenuates, ameliorates, or eliminates one or more symptoms of the particular disease or condition, or (iii) prevents or delays the onset of one or more symptoms of the particular disease or condition described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “modulated” or “modulating”, or “modulate(s)”, as used herein, unless otherwise indicated, refers to the modulation of the activity of the GPR119 enzyme(s) with one or more compounds of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “mediated” or “mediating” or “mediate”, as used herein, unless otherwise indicated, refers to the (i) treatment, including prevention the particular disease or condition, (ii) attenuation, amelioration, or elimination of one or more symptoms of the particular disease or condition, or (iii) prevention or delay of the onset of one or more symptoms of the particular disease or condition described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “substituted” as used herein, means that any one or more hydrogens on the designated atom, radical or moiety is replaced with a selection from the indicated group, provided that the atom's normal valence is not exceeded, and that the substitution results in an acceptably stable compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a definition of a group the term “wherein each X, Y and Z group is optionally substituted with” and the like denotes that each group X, each group Y and each group Z either each as a separate group or each as part of a composed group may be substituted as defined. For example a definition “R\nex \ndenotes H, C\n1-3\n-alkyl, C\n3-6\n-cycloalkyl, C\n3-6\n-cycloalkyl-C\n1-3\n-alkyl or C\n1-3\n-alkyl-O—, wherein each alkyl group is optionally substituted with one or more L\nex\n.” or the like means that in each of the beforementioned groups which comprise the term alkyl, i.e. in each of the groups C\n1-3\n-alkyl, C\n3-6\n-cycloalkyl-C\n1-3\n-alkyl and C\n1-3\n-alkyl-O—, the alkyl moiety may be substituted with L\nex \nas defined.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the groups, radicals, or moieties defined below, the number of carbon atoms is often specified preceding the group, for example, C\n1-6\n-alkyl means an alkyl group or radical having 1 to 6 carbon atoms. In general, for groups comprising two or more subgroups, the last named subgroup is the radical attachment point, for example, the substituent “aryl-C\n1-3\n-alkyl-” means an aryl group which is bound to a C\n1-3\n-alkyl-group, the latter of which is bound to the core or to the group to which the substituent is attached.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn case a compound of the present invention is depicted in form of a chemical name and as a formula in case of any discrepancy the formula shall prevail.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn asterisk or the sign \n is used in sub-formulas to indicate the bond which is connected to the core molecule as defined.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe numeration of the atoms of a substituent starts with the atom which is closest to the core or to the group to which the substituent is attached.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, the term “3-carboxypropyl-group” represents the following substituent:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein the carboxy group is attached to the third carbon atom of the propyl group. The terms “1-methylpropyl-”, “2,2-dimethylpropyl-” or “cyclopropylmethyl-” group represent the following groups:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a definition of a group or substituent the term “oxo” denotes an O-atom which replaces two H-atoms and which is linked to the respective atom via a double bond. A group comprising a —CH\n2\n-group may be substituted with an oxo substituent such that the —CH\n2\n-group is replaced a —C(═O)— group.\n\n\n \nStereochemistry/Solvates/Hydrates:\n\n\n \n \n \nUnless specifically indicated, throughout the specification and the appended claims, a given chemical formula or name shall encompass tautomers and all stereo, optical and geometrical isomers (e.g. enantiomers, diastereomers, E/Z isomers etc. . . . ) and racemates thereof as well as mixtures in different proportions of the separate enantiomers, mixtures of diastereomers, or mixtures of any of the foregoing forms where such isomers and enantiomers exist, as well as salts, including pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and solvates thereof such as for instance hydrates including solvates of the free compounds or solvates of a salt of the compound.\n\n\n \nSalts:\n\n\n \n \n \nThe phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable” is employed herein to refer to those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, and commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” refer to derivatives of the disclosed compounds wherein the parent compound is modified by making acid or base salts thereof. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, mineral or organic acid salts of basic residues such as amines; alkali or organic salts of acidic residues such as carboxylic acids; and the like. For example, such salts include acetates, ascorbates, benzenesulfonates, benzoates, besylates, bicarbonates, bitartrates, bromides/hydrobromides, Ca-edetates/edetates, camsylates, carbonates, chlorides/hydrochlorides, citrates, edisylates, ethane disulfonates, estolates esylates, fumarates, gluceptates, gluconates, glutamates, glycolates, glycollylarsnilates, hexylresorcinates, hydrabamines, hydroxymaleates, hydroxynaphthoates, iodides, isothionates, lactates, lactobionates, malates, maleates, mandelates, methanesulfonates, mesylates, methylbromides, methylnitrates, methylsulfates, mucates, napsylates, nitrates, oxalates, pamoates, pantothenates, phenylacetates, phosphates/diphosphates, polygalacturonates, propionates, salicylates, stearates subacetates, succinates, sulfamides, sulfates, tannates, tartrates, teoclates, toluenesulfonates, triethiodides, ammonium, benzathines, chloroprocaines, cholines, diethanolamines, ethylenediamines, meglumines and procaines. Further pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be formed with cations from metals like aluminium, calcium, lithium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, zinc and the like. (also see Pharmaceutical salts, Birge, S. M. et al., J. Pharm.

At time zero, blood was collected using the tail-nick method and glucose was measured with a glucometer (Bayer HealthCare) Animals then immediately received either vehicle (80% Labrasol, Gattefossé, France) or 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg GPR119 agonist (p.o., volume 2 mL/kg). Thirty minutes later blood glucose was again measured preceding the administration of a glucose bolus (p.o. 2 g/kg, volume 6 mL/kg). Blood glucose was then determined at 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 minutes post glucose bolus or 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120 minutes past glucose bolus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNine week old male ZDF rats were dosed with either 30 mg/kg of Compound 2-35 or 30 mg/kg of Compound 8-1 30 minutes prior to administration of the glucose bolus. Glucose excursion was greatly reduced by both compounds when compared to vehicle controls. Compound 2-35 resulted in a 75% reduction of glucose excursion compared to vehicle in the 2 hrs post glucose bolus (measuring every 20 minutes and comparing glucose area under the curve) while compound 8-1 resulted in a 70% reduction.\n\n\n \nExample 79\n\n\ncAMP Assay Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nQuantitative detection of cAMP accumulation from cells expressing human GPR119 receptor was achieved using Perkin Elmer's LANCE cAMP-384 Kit (Cat#AD0264) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, HEK293 cells stably expressing a mutant form of the human GPR119 receptor (Methionine 1 replaced with the amino acid sequence MKTIIALSYIFCLVFADYKDDDDA, and T327 & S329 changed to alanines) were grown to 50-70% confluency in cell culture media (DMEM, 10% heat inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum, 50 I.U./mL penicillin, 50 μg/mL streptomycin, 10 mM HEPES, 20 μg/mL G418 Sulfate). On the day of the assay, GPR119 stable HEK293 cells were lifted from the tissue culture plate and 1000 cells/well were incubated along with various concentrations of test compounds for 20 mM at 37° C. Detection Buffer (50 mM HEPES, 10 mM calcium chloride, 0.35% Triton X-100, 1 mg/mL BSA) containing cAMP-specific antibody was then added to all wells and allowed to equilibrate in the dark for 10 minutes at room temperature. Upon equilibration, Detection Buffer containing europium-labeled cAMP tracer complex was added to all wells and allowed to react for 1 hour at room temperature. After 1 hour, bound europium-labeled cAMP tracer was measured using a Perkin Elmer ViewLux. The quantity of cAMP generated in each well was derived from a standard curve. EC50 was determined using nonlinear regression analysis of the cAMP values over a range of agonist concentration (12 points spanning the range from 30 μM to 100 μM).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor some compounds for which no EC50 value could be determined, the efficacy is provided at a single concentration (10 μM) yielding % stimulation values.\n\n\n \nExample 80\n\n\nInsulin Secretion Assay in Isolated Rat Pancreatic Islets\n\n\n \n \n \nRat pancretic islets are isolated and allowed to recover overnight in RPMI cell culture media (10% FBS, 50 I.U./mL penicillin, 50 μg/mL streptomycin, 10 mM HEPES) containing 11 mM Glucose. After incubating overnight at 37° C. and 5% CO\n2\n/95% air, the islets were thoroughly washed 5× in 1× Krebes Ringes HEPES buffer (118 mM NaCl, 4.8 mM KCl, 2.5 mM CaCl\n2\n, 1.2 mM MgSO\n4\n, 20 mM HEPES, 0.1% BSA, adjusted to a pH of 7.4 with NaOH) with 5 mM Glucose. Islets were allowed to preincubate for 30 minutes in 1×KRH with 5 mM Glucose at 37° C. before assay initiation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTest compounds are diluted in 1×KRH containing an appropriate concentration of glucose so that at the initiation of the islet assay the final glucose concentration was 8.3 mM. At time zero, compound solutions were added to islets in wells to give a final volume of 2.4 mL of 1xKRH with 8.3 mM glucose and allowed to incubate at 37° C. Aliquots of supernatant were removed at various times points and were assayed for insulin using a commercially available insulin RIA kit (Linco Research Labs).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmediately following the assay, the islets are removed from the 24 well plates into separate 1.5 mL epindorf tubes containing 1 mL of 1×KRH with no glucose and then placed on ice. Islets are allowed to settle for 5 mM before the supernatant is removed and 300 μL of acid/ethanol is added to each tubes. Following brief sonication tubes are stored at −20° C. for at least 24 hours before assayed for total insulin content by radioimmunoassay (Linco Research). For quantification purposes, the amount of stimulated insulin secretion is expressed as a fraction of total insulin in the assay well.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be appreciated that, although specific embodiments of the invention have been described herein for purposes of illustration, various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.

No. 61/153,966, filed 19 Feb. 2009, to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/208,089, filed 18 Feb. 2009, to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/192,672, filed 19 Sep. 2009, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nAmong other things, the present invention relates to conjugates comprising a therapeutic peptide moiety covalently attached to one or more water-soluble polymers.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIn many ways, the chemical and biological properties of peptides make them very attractive candidates for use as therapeutic agents. Peptides are naturally occurring molecules made up of amino acid building blocks, and are involved in countless physiological processes. With 20 naturally occurring amino acids, and any number of non-naturally occurring amino acids, a nearly endless variety of peptides may be generated. Additionally, peptides display a high degree of selectivity and potency, and may not suffer from potential adverse drug-drug interactions or other negative side effects. Moreover, recent advances in peptide synthesis techniques have made the synthesis of peptides practical and economically viable. Thus peptides hold great promise as a highly diverse, highly potent, and highly selective class of therapeutic molecules with low toxicity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA number of peptides have been identified as therapeutically promising; however in vitro results have often not proven to bear out in vivo. Significantly, peptides suffer from a short in vivo half life, sometimes mere minutes, making them generally impractical, in their native form, for therapeutic administration. Thus there exists a need in the art for modified therapeutic peptides having an enhanced half-life and/or reduced clearance as well as additional therapeutic advantages as compared to the therapeutic peptides in their unmodified form.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nAccordingly, the present invention provides conjugates comprising a therapeutic peptide moiety covalently attached to one or more water-soluble polymers. The water-soluble polymer may be stably bound to the therapeutic peptide moiety, or it may be releasably attached to the therapeutic peptide moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention further provides methods of synthesizing such therapeutic peptide polymer conjugates and compositions comprising such conjugates. The invention further provides methods of treating, preventing, or ameliorating a disease, disorder or condition in a mammal comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a therapeutic peptide polymer conjugate of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional embodiments of the present conjugates, compositions, methods, and the like will be apparent from the following description, examples, and claims. As can be appreciated from the foregoing and following description, each and every feature described herein, and each and every combination of two or more of such features, is included within the scope of the present disclosure provided that the features included in such a combination are not mutually inconsistent. In addition, any feature or combination of features may be specifically excluded from any embodiment of the present invention. Additional aspects and advantages of the present invention are set forth in the following description and claims, particularly when considered in conjunction with the accompanying examples and drawings.\n\n\n \n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS\n\n\n \n \n \nFIG.

Thus, for example, reference to “a polymer” includes a single polymer as well as two or more of the same or different polymers; reference to “an optional excipient” or to “a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient” refers to a single optional excipient as well as two or more of the same or different optional excipients, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn describing and claiming one or more embodiments of the present invention, the following terminology will be used in accordance with the definitions described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the terms “therapeutic peptide” and “therapeutic peptides” mean one or more peptides having demonstrated or potential use in treating, preventing, or ameliorating one or more diseases, disorders, or conditions in a subject in need thereof, as well as related peptides. These terms may be used to refer to therapeutic peptides prior to conjugation to a water-soluble polymer as well as following the conjugation. Therapeutic peptides include, but are not limited to, those disclosed herein, including in Table 1. Therapeutic peptides include peptides found to have use in treating, preventing, or ameliorating one or more diseases, disorders, or conditions after the time of filing of this application. Related peptides include fragments of therapeutic peptides, therapeutic peptide variants, and therapeutic peptide derivatives that retain some or all of the therapeutic activities of the therapeutic peptide. As will be known to one of skill in the art, as a general principle, modifications may be made to peptides that do not alter, or only partially abrogate, the properties and activities of those peptides. In some instances, modifications may be made that result in an increase in therapeutic activities. Thus, in the spirit of the invention, the terms “therapeutic peptide” or “therapeutic peptides” are meant to encompass modifications to the therapeutic peptides defined and/or disclosed herein that do not alter, only partially abrogate, or increase the therapeutic activities of the parent peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “therapeutic activity” as used herein refers to a demonstrated or potential biological activity whose effect is consistent with a desirable therapeutic outcome in humans, or to desired effects in non-human mammals or in other species or organisms. A given therapeutic peptide may have one or more therapeutic activities, however the term “therapeutic activities” as used herein may refer to a single therapeutic activity or multiple therapeutic activites. “Therapeutic activity” includes the ability to induce a response in vitro, and may be measured in vivo or in vitro. For example, a desirable effect may be assayed in cell culture, or by clinical evaluation, EC\n50 \nassays, IC\n50 \nassays, or dose response curves. In vitro or cell culture assays, for example, are commonly available and known to one of skill in the art for many therapeutic peptides as defined and/or disclosed herein. Therapeutic activity includes treatment, which may be prophylactic or ameliorative, or prevention of a disease, disorder, or condition. Treatment of a disease, disorder or condition can include improvement of a disease, disorder or condition by any amount, including elimination of a disease, disorder or condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the terms “peptide,” “polypeptide,” and “protein,” refer to polymers comprised of amino acid monomers linked by amide bonds. Peptides may include the standard 20 α-amino acids that are used in protein synthesis by cells (i.e. natural amino acids), as well as non-natural amino acids (non-natural amino acids may be found in nature, but not used in protein synthesis by cells, e.g., ornithine, citrulline, and sarcosine, or may be chemically synthesized), amino acid analogs, and peptidomimetics. Spatola, (1983) in Chemistry and Biochemistry of Amino Acids, Peptides, and Proteins, Weinstein, ed., Marcel Dekker, New York, p. 267. The amino acids may be D- or L-optical isomers. Peptides may be formed by a condensation or coupling reaction between the α-carbon carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of another amino acid. The terminal amino acid at one end of the chain (amino terminal) therefore has a free amino group, while the terminal amino acid at the other end of the chain (carboxy terminal) has a free carboxyl group. Alternatively, the peptides may be non-linear, branched peptides or cyclic peptides. Moreover, the peptides may optionally be modified or protected with a variety of functional groups or protecting groups, including on the amino and/or carboxy terminus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmino acid residues in peptides are abbreviated as follows: Phenylalanine is Phe or F; Leucine is Leu or L; Isoleucine is Ile or I; Methionine is Met or M; Valine is Val or V; Serine is Ser or S; Proline is Pro or P; Threonine is Thr or T; Alanine is Ala or A; Tyrosine is Tyr or Y; Histidine is His or H; Glutamine is Gln or Q; Asparagine is Asn or N; Lysine is Lys or K; Aspartic Acid is Asp or D; Glutamic Acid is Glu or E; Cysteine is Cys or C; Tryptophan is Trp or W; Arginine is Arg or R; and Glycine is Gly or G.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “therapeutic peptide fragment” or “fragments of therapeutic peptides” refer to a polypeptide that comprises a truncation at the amino-terminus and/or a truncation at the carboxyl-terminus of a therapeutic peptide as defined herein. The terms “therapeutic peptide fragment” or “fragments of therapeutic peptides” also encompasses amino-terminal and/or carboxyl-terminal truncations of therapeutic peptide variants and therapeutic peptide derivatives. Therapeutic peptide fragments may be produced by synthetic techniques known in the art or may arise from in vivo protease activity on longer peptide sequences. It will be understood that therapeutic peptide fragments retain some or all of the therapeutic activities of the therapeutic peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the terms “therapeutic peptide variants” or “variants of therapeutic peptides” refer to therapeutic peptides having one or more amino acid substitutions, including conservative substitutions and non-conservative substitutions, amino acid deletions (either internal deletions and/or C- and/or N-terminal truncations), amino acid additions (either internal additions and/or C- and/or N-terminal additions, e.g., fusion peptides), or any combination thereof. Variants may be naturally occurring (e.g. homologs or orthologs), or non-natural in origin. The term “therapeutic peptide variants” may also be used to refer to therapeutic peptides incorporating one or more non-natural amino acids, amino acid analogs, and peptidomimetics. It will be understood that, in accordance with the invention, therapeutic peptide fragments retain some or all of the therapeutic activities of the therapeutic peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “therapeutic peptide derivatives” or “derivatives of therapeutic peptides” as used herein refer to therapeutic peptides, therapeutic peptide fragments, and therapeutic peptide variants that have been chemically altered other than through covalent attachment of a water-soluble polymer. It will be understood that, in accordance with the invention, therapeutic peptide derivatives retain some or all of the therapeutic activities of the therapeutic peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the terms “amino terminus protecting group” or “N-terminal protecting group,” “carboxy terminus protecting group” or “C-terminal protecting group;” or “side chain protecting group” refer to any chemical moiety capable of addition to and optionally removal from a functional group on a peptide (e.g., the N-terminus, the C-terminus, or a functional group associated with the side chain of an amino acid located within the peptide) to allow for chemical manipulation of the peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“PEG,” “polyethylene glycol” and “poly(ethylene glycol)” as used herein, are interchangeable and encompass any nonpeptidic water-soluble poly(ethylene oxide). Typically, PEGs for use in accordance with the invention comprise the following structure “—(OCH\n2\nCH\n2\n)\nn\n—” where (n) is 2 to 4000. As used herein, PEG also includes “—CH\n2\nCH\n2\n—O(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)\nn\n—CH\n2\nCH\n2\n—” and “—(OCH\n2\nCH\n2\n)\nn\nO—,” depending upon whether or not the terminal oxygens have been displaced. Throughout the specification and claims, it should be remembered that the term “PEG” includes structures having various terminal or “end capping” groups and so forth. The term “PEG” also means a polymer that contains a majority, that is to say, greater than 50%, of —OCH\n2\nCH\n2\n— repeating subunits. With respect to specific forms, the PEG can take any number of a variety of molecular weights, as well as structures or geometries such as “branched,” “linear,” “forked,” “multifunctional,” and the like, to be described in greater detail below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “end-capped” and “terminally capped” are interchangeably used herein to refer to a terminal or endpoint of a polymer having an end-capping moiety. Typically, although not necessarily, the end-capping moiety comprises a hydroxy or C\n1-20 \nalkoxy group, more preferably a C\n1-10 \nalkoxy group, and still more preferably a C\n1-5 \nalkoxy group. Thus, examples of end-capping moieties include alkoxy (e.g., methoxy, ethoxy and benzyloxy), as well as aryl, heteroaryl, cyclo, heterocyclo, and the like. It must be remembered that the end-capping moiety may include one or more atoms of the terminal monomer in the polymer [e.g., the end-capping moiety “methoxy” in CH\n3\n—O—(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)\nn\n— and CH\n3\n(OCH\n2\nCH\n2\n)\nn\n—]. In addition, saturated, unsaturated, substituted and unsubstituted forms of each of the foregoing are envisioned. Moreover, the end-capping group can also be a silane. The end-capping group can also advantageously comprise a detectable label. When the polymer has an end-capping group comprising a detectable label, the amount or location of the polymer and/or the moiety (e.g., active agent) to which the polymer is coupled can be determined by using a suitable detector. Such labels include, without limitation, fluorescers, chemiluminescers, moieties used in enzyme labeling, colorimetric (e.g., dyes), metal ions, radioactive moieties, gold particles, quantum dots, and the like. Suitable detectors include photometers, films, spectrometers, and the like. The end-capping group can also advantageously comprise a phospholipid. When the polymer has an end-capping group comprising a phospholipid, unique properties are imparted to the polymer and the resulting conjugate. Exemplary phospholipids include, without limitation, those selected from the class of phospholipids called phosphatidylcholines. Specific phospholipids include, without limitation, those selected from the group consisting of dilauroylphosphatidylcholine, dioleylphosphatidylcholine, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, disteroylphosphatidylcholine, behenoylphosphatidylcholine, arachidoylphosphatidylcholine, and lecithin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “targeting moiety” is used herein to refer to a molecular structure that helps the conjugates of the invention to localize to a targeting area, e.g., help enter a cell, or bind a receptor. Preferably, the targeting moiety comprises of vitamin, antibody, antigen, receptor, DNA, RNA, sialyl Lewis X antigen, hyaluronic acid, sugars, cell specific lectins, steroid or steroid derivative, RGD peptide, ligand for a cell surface receptor, serum component, or combinatorial molecule directed against various intra- or extracellular receptors. The targeting moiety may also comprise a lipid or a phospholipid. Exemplary phospholipids include, without limitation, phosphatidylcholines, phospatidylserine, phospatidylinositol, phospatidylglycerol, and phospatidylethanolamine. These lipids may be in the form of micelles or liposomes and the like. The targeting moiety may further comprise a detectable label or alternately a detectable label may serve as a targeting moiety. When the conjugate has a targeting group comprising a detectable label, the amount and/or distribution/location of the polymer and/or the moiety (e.g., active agent) to which the polymer is coupled can be determined by using a suitable detector. Such labels include, without limitation, fluorescers, chemiluminescers, moieties used in enzyme labeling, colorimetric (e.g., dyes), metal ions, radioactive moieties, gold particles, quantum dots, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Non-naturally occurring” with respect to a polymer as described herein, means a polymer that in its entirety is not found in nature. A non-naturally occurring polymer of the invention may, however, contain one or more monomers or segments of monomers that are naturally occurring, so long as the overall polymer structure is not found in nature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “water soluble” as in a “water-soluble polymer” is any polymer that is soluble in water at room temperature. Typically, a water-soluble polymer will transmit at least about 75%, more preferably at least about 95%, of light transmitted by the same solution after filtering. On a weight basis, a water-soluble polymer will preferably be at least about 35% (by weight) soluble in water, more preferably at least about 50% (by weight) soluble in water, still more preferably about 70% (by weight) soluble in water, and still more preferably about 85% (by weight) soluble in water. It is most preferred, however, that the water-soluble polymer is about 95% (by weight) soluble in water or completely soluble in water.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Hydrophilic,” e.g, in reference to a “hydrophilic polymer,” refers to a polymer that is characterized by its solubility in and compatibility with water. In non-cross linked form, a hydrophilic polymer is able to dissolve in, or be dispersed in water. Typically, a hydrophilic polymer possesses a polymer backbone composed of carbon and hydrogen, and generally possesses a high percentage of oxygen in either the main polymer backbone or in pendent groups substituted along the polymer backbone, thereby leading to its “water-loving” nature. The water-soluble polymers of the present invention are typically hydrophilic, e.g., non-naturally occurring hydrophilic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMolecular weight in the context of a water-soluble polymer, such as PEG, can be expressed as either a number average molecular weight or a weight average molecular weight. Unless otherwise indicated, all references to molecular weight herein refer to the weight average molecular weight. Both molecular weight determinations, number average and weight average, can be measured using gel permeation chromatography or other liquid chromatography techniques. Other methods for measuring molecular weight values can also be used, such as the use of end-group analysis or the measurement of colligative properties (e.g., freezing-point depression, boiling-point elevation, and osmotic pressure) to determine number average molecular weight, or the use of light scattering techniques, ultracentrifugation or viscometry to determine weight average molecular weight. The polymers of the invention are typically polydisperse (i.e., number average molecular weight and weight average molecular weight of the polymers are not equal), possessing low polydispersity values of preferably less than about 1.2, more preferably less than about 1.15, still more preferably less than about 1.10, yet still more preferably less than about 1.05, and most preferably less than about 1.03.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “active” or “activated” when used in conjunction with a particular functional group refers to a reactive functional group that reacts readily with an electrophile or a nucleophile on another molecule. This is in contrast to those groups that require strong catalysts or highly impractical reaction conditions in order to react (i.e., a “non-reactive” or “inert” group).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “functional group” or any synonym thereof is meant to encompass protected forms thereof as well as unprotected forms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “spacer moiety,” “linkage” and “linker” are used herein to refer to an atom or a collection of atoms optionally used to link interconnecting moieties such as a terminus of a polymer segment and a therapeutic peptide or an electrophile or nucleophile of a therapeutic peptide. The spacer moiety may be hydrolytically stable or may include a physiologically hydrolyzable or enzymatically degradable linkage. Unless the context clearly dictates otherwise, a spacer moiety optionally exists between any two elements of a compound (e.g., the provided conjugates comprising a residue of a therapeutic peptide and a water-soluble polymer that can be attached directly or indirectly through a spacer moiety).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “monomer” or “mono-conjugate,” in reference to a polymer conjugate of a therapeutic peptide, refers to a therapeutic peptide having only one water-soluble polymer molecule covalently attached thereto, whereas a therapeutic peptide “dimer” or “di-conjugate” is a polymer conjugate of a therapeutic peptide having two water-soluble polymer molecules covalently attached thereto, and so forth.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Alkyl” refers to a hydrocarbon, typically ranging from about 1 to 15 atoms in length. Such hydrocarbons are preferably but not necessarily saturated and may be branched or straight chain, although typically straight chain is preferred. Exemplary alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, 2-methylbutyl, 2-ethylpropyl, 3-methylpentyl, and the like. As used herein, “alkyl” includes cycloalkyl as well as cycloalkylene-containing alkyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Lower alkyl” refers to an alkyl group containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and may be straight chain or branched, as exemplified by methyl, ethyl, n-butyl, i-butyl, and t-butyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Cycloalkyl” refers to a saturated or unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbon chain, including bridged, fused, or spiro cyclic compounds, preferably made up of 3 to about 12 carbon atoms, more preferably 3 to about 8 carbon atoms. “Cycloalkylene” refers to a cycloalkyl group that is inserted into an alkyl chain by bonding of the chain at any two carbons in the cyclic ring system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Alkoxy” refers to an —O—R group, wherein R is alkyl or substituted alkyl, preferably C\n1-6 \nalkyl (e.g., methoxy, ethoxy, propyloxy, and so forth).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “substituted” as in, for example, “substituted alkyl,” refers to a moiety (e.g., an alkyl group) substituted with one or more noninterfering substituents, such as, but not limited to: alkyl; C\n3-8 \ncycloalkyl, e.g., cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, and the like; halo, e.g., fluoro, chloro, bromo, and iodo; cyano; alkoxy, lower phenyl; substituted phenyl; and the like. “Substituted awl” is aryl having one or more noninterfering groups as a substituent. For substitutions on a phenyl ring, the substituents may be in any orientation (i.e., ortho, meta, or para).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Noninterfering substituents” are those groups that, when present in a molecule, are typically nonreactive with other functional groups contained within the molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Aryl” means one or more aromatic rings, each of 5 or 6 core carbon atoms. Aryl includes multiple aryl rings that may be fused, as in naphthyl or unfused, as in biphenyl. Aryl rings may also be fused or unfused with one or more cyclic hydrocarbon, heteroaryl, or heterocyclic rings. As used herein, “aryl” includes heteroaryl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Heteroaryl” is an aryl group containing from one to four heteroatoms, preferably sulfur, oxygen, or nitrogen, or a combination thereof. Heteroaryl rings may also be fused with one or more cyclic hydrocarbon, heterocyclic, aryl, or heteroaryl rings.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Heterocycle” or “heterocyclic” means one or more rings of 5-12 atoms, preferably 5-7 atoms, with or without unsaturation or aromatic character and having at least one ring atom that is not a carbon. Preferred heteroatoms include sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Substituted heteroaryl” is heteroaryl having one or more noninterfering groups as substituents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Substituted heterocycle” is a heterocycle having one or more side chains formed from noninterfering substituents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “organic radical” as used herein shall include alkyl, substituted alkyl, alkenyl, substituted alkenyl, alkynyl, substituted alkynyl, aryl, and substituted aryl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Electrophile” and “electrophilic group” refer to an ion or atom or collection of atoms, that may be ionic, having an electrophilic center, i.e., a center that is electron seeking, capable of reacting with a nucleophile.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Nucleophile” and “nucleophilic group” refers to an ion or atom or collection of atoms that may be ionic having a nucleophilic center, i.e., a center that is seeking an electrophilic center or with an electrophile.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “physiologically cleavable” or “hydrolyzable” or “degradable” bond is a bond that reacts with water (i.e., is hydrolyzed) under physiological conditions. The tendency of a bond to hydrolyze in water will depend not only on the general type of linkage connecting two central atoms but also on the substituents attached to these central atoms. Appropriate hydrolytically unstable or weak linkages include but are not limited to carboxylate ester, phosphate ester, anhydrides, acetals, ketals, acyloxyalkyl ether, imines, orthoesters, peptides and oligonucleotides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Releasably attached,” e.g., in reference to a therapeutic peptide releasably attached to a water-soluble polymer, refers to a therapeutic peptide that is covalently attached via a linker that includes a degradable linkage as disclosed herein, wherein upon degradation (e.g., hydrolysis), the therapeutic peptide is released. The therapeutic peptide thus released will typically correspond to the unmodified parent or native therapeutic peptide, or may be slightly altered, e.g., possessing a short organic tag. Preferably, the unmodified parent therapeutic peptide is released.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “enzymatically degradable linkage” means a linkage that is subject to degradation by one or more enzymes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “hydrolytically stable” linkage or bond refers to a chemical bond, typically a covalent bond, that is substantially stable in water, that is to say, does not undergo hydrolysis under physiological conditions to any appreciable extent over an extended period of time. Examples of hydrolytically stable linkages include, but are not limited to, the following: carbon-carbon bonds (e.g., in aliphatic chains), ethers, amides, urethanes, and the like. Generally, a hydrolytically stable linkage is one that exhibits a rate of hydrolysis of less than about 1-2% per day under physiological conditions. Hydrolysis rates of representative chemical bonds can be found in most standard chemistry textbooks. It must be pointed out that some linkages can be hydrolytically stable or hydrolyzable, depending upon (for example) adjacent and neighboring atoms and ambient conditions. One of ordinary skill in the art can determine whether a given linkage or bond is hydrolytically stable or hydrolyzable in a given context by, for example, placing a linkage-containing molecule of interest under conditions of interest and testing for evidence of hydrolysis (e.g., the presence and amount of two molecules resulting from the cleavage of a single molecule). Other approaches known to those of ordinary skill in the art for determining whether a given linkage or bond is hydrolytically stable or hydrolyzable can also be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “pharmaceutically acceptable excipient” and “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” refer to an excipient that may optionally be included in the compositions of the invention and that causes no significant adverse toxicological effects to the patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Pharmacologically effective amount,” “physiologically effective amount,” and “therapeutically effective amount” are used interchangeably herein to mean the amount of a polymer-(therapeutic peptide) conjugate that is needed to provide a desired level of the conjugate (or corresponding unconjugated therapeutic peptide) in the bloodstream or in the target tissue. The precise amount will depend upon numerous factors, e.g., the particular therapeutic peptide, the components and physical characteristics of the therapeutic composition, intended patient population, individual patient considerations, and the like, and can readily be determined by one skilled in the art, based upon the information provided herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Multi-functional” means a polymer having three or more functional groups contained therein, where the functional groups may be the same or different. Multi-functional polymeric reagents of the invention will typically contain from about 3-100 functional groups, or from 3-50 functional groups, or from 3-25 functional groups, or from 3-15 functional groups, or from 3 to 10 functional groups, or will contain 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 functional groups within the polymer backbone. A “difunctional” polymer means a polymer having two functional groups contained therein, either the same (i.e., homodifunctional) or different (i.e., heterodifunctional).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “subject,” “individual,” or “patient” are used interchangeably herein and refer to a vertebrate, preferably a mammal. Mammals include, but are not limited to, murines, rodents, simians, humans, farm animals, sport animals, and pets.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Optional” or “optionally” means that the subsequently described circumstance may or may not occur, so that the description includes instances where the circumstance occurs and instances where it does not.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Substantially” (unless specifically defined for a particular context elsewhere or the context clearly dictates otherwise) means nearly totally or completely, for instance, satisfying one or more of the following: greater than 50%, 51% or greater, 75% or greater, 80% or greater, 90% or greater, and 95% or greater of the condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnless the context clearly dictates otherwise, when the term “about” precedes a numerical value, the numerical value is understood to mean the stated numerical value and also ±10% of the stated numerical value.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTurning now to one or more aspects of the invention, conjugates are provided, the conjugates comprising a therapeutic peptide covalently attached (either directly or through a spacer moiety or linker) to a water-soluble polymer. The conjugates generally have the following formula:\n\n\n \n \n \nPEP-[-X-POLY]\nk \n \n\n\n \n \nwherein PEP is a therapeutic peptide as defined herein, X is a covalent bond or is a spacer moiety or linker, POLY is a water soluble polymer, and k in an integer ranging from 1-10, preferably 1-5, and more preferably 1-3.\n\n\n \nTherapeutic Peptides\n\n\n \n \n \nAs previously stated, the conjugates of the invention comprise a therapeutic peptide as disclosed and/or defined herein. Therapeutic peptides include those currently known to have demonstrated or potential use in treating, preventing, or ameliorating one or more diseases, disorders, or conditions in a subject in need thereof as well as those discovered after the filing of this application. Therapeutic peptides also include related peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments of the invention, PEP is a therapeutic peptide selected from the group consisting of carperitide; alpha-neoendorphin;

analogs, and peptidomimetics, in any combination. The peptides may be composed of D-amino acids or L-amino acids, or a combination of both in any proportion. In addition to natural amino acids, the therapeutic peptides may contain, or may be modified to include, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, or more non-natural amino acids. Exemplary non-natural amino acids and amino acid analogs that can be use with the invention include, but are not limited to, 2-aminobutyric acid, 2-aminoisobutyric acid, 3-(1-naphthyl)alanine, 3-(2-naphthyl)alanine, 3-methylhistidine, 3-pyridylalanine, 4-chlorophenylalanine, 4-fluorophenylalanine, 4-hydroxyproline, 5-hydroxylysine, alloisoleucine, citrulline, dehydroalanine, homoarginine, homocysteine, homoserine, hydroxyproline, N-acetylserine, N-formylmethionine, N-methylglycine, N-methylisoleucine, norleucine, N-α-methylarginine, O-phosphoserine, ornithine, phenylglycine, pipecolinic acid, piperazic acid, pyroglutamine, sarcosine, valanine, β-alanine, and β-cyclohexylalanine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe therapeutic peptides may be, or may be modified to be, linear, branched, or cyclic, with our without branching.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, the therapeutic peptides may optionally be modified or protected with a variety of functional groups or protecting groups, including amino terminus protecting groups and/or carboxy terminus protecting groups. Protecting groups, and the manner in which they are introduced and removed are described, for example, in “Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry,” Plenum Press, London, N.Y. 1973; and Greene et al., “P\nROTECTIVE \nG\nROUPS IN \nO\nRGANIC \nS\nYNTHESIS\n” 3\nrd \nEdition, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York, 1999. Numerous protecting groups are known in the art. An illustrative, non-limiting list of protecting groups includes methyl, formyl, ethyl, acetyl, t-butyl, anisyl, benzyl, trifluoroacetyl, N-hydroxysuccinimide, t-butoxycarbonyl, benzoyl, 4-methylbenzyl, thioanizyl, thiocresyl, benzyloxymethyl, 4-nitrophenyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, 2-nitrobenzoyl, 2-nitrophenylsulphenyl, 4-toluenesulphonyl, pentafluorophenyl, diphenylmethyl, 2-chlorobenzyloxycarbonyl, 2,4,5-trichlorophenyl, 2-bromobenzyloxycarbonyl, 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl, triphenylmethyl, and 2,2,5,7,8-pentamethyl-chroman-6-sulphonyl. For discussions of various different types of amino- and carboxy-protecting groups, see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,221,736 (issued Jun. 22, 1993); U.S. Pat. No. 5,256,549 (issued Oct. 26, 1993); U.S. Pat. No. 5,049,656 (issued Sep. 17, 1991); and U.S. Pat. No. 5,521,184 (issued May 28, 1996).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe therapeutic peptides contain, or may be modified to contain, functional groups to which a water-soluble polymer may be attached, either directly or through a spacer moiety or linker. Functional groups include, but are not limited to, the N-terminus of the therapeutic peptide, the C-terminus of the therapeutic peptide, and any functional groups on the side chain of an amino acid, e.g. lysine, cysteine, histidine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, tyrosine, arginine, serine, methionine, and threonine, present in the therapeutic peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe therapeutic peptides can be prepared by any means known in the art, including non-recombinant and recombinant methods, or they may, in some instances, be commercially available. Chemical or non-recombinant methods include, but are not limited to, solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS), solution phase peptide synthesis, native chemical ligation, intein-mediated protein ligation, and chemical ligation, or a combination thereof. In a preferred embodiment, the therapeutic peptides are synthesized using standard SPPS, either manually or by using commercially available automated SPPS synthesizers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSPPS has been known in the art since the early 1960's (Merrifield, R. B., \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc., \n85:2149-2154 (1963)), and is widely employed. (See also, Bodanszky, Principles of Peptide Synthesis, Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg (1984)). There are several known variations on the general approach. (See, for example, “Peptide Synthesis, Structures, and Applications” © 1995 by Academic Press, \nChapter\n 3 and White (2003) \nFmoc Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis, A practical Approach\n, Oxford University Press, Oxford). Very briefly, in solid phase peptide synthesis, the desired C-terminal amino acid residue is coupled to a solid support. The subsequent amino acid to be added to the peptide chain is protected on its amino terminus with Boc, Fmoc, or other suitable protecting group, and its carboxy terminus is activated with a standard coupling reagent. The free amino terminus of the support-bound amino acid is allowed to react with the carboxy-terminus of the subsequent amino acid, coupling the two amino acids. The amino terminus of the growing peptide chain is deprotected, and the process is repeated until the desired polypeptide is completed. Side chain protecting groups may be utilized as needed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the therapeutic peptides may be prepared recombinantly. Exemplary recombinant methods used to prepare therapeutic peptides include the following, among others, as will be apparent to one skilled in the art. Typically, a therapeutic peptide as defined and/or described herein is prepared by constructing the nucleic acid encoding the desired peptide or fragment, cloning the nucleic acid into an expression vector, transforming a host cell (e.g., plant, bacteria such as \nEscherichia coli\n, yeast such as \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae\n, or mammalian cell such as Chinese hamster ovary cell or baby hamster kidney cell), and expressing the nucleic acid to produce the desired peptide or fragment. The expression can occur via exogenous expression or via endogenous expression (when the host cell naturally contains the desired genetic coding). Methods for producing and expressing recombinant polypeptides in vitro and in prokaryotic and eukaryotic host cells are known to those of ordinary skill in the art. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,868,122, and Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning—A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press (1989).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo facilitate identification and purification of the recombinant peptide, nucleic acid sequences that encode an epitope tag or other affinity binding sequence can be inserted or added in-frame with the coding sequence, thereby producing a fusion peptide comprised of the desired therapeutic peptide and a peptide suited for binding. Fusion peptides can be identified and purified by first running a mixture containing the fusion peptide through an affinity column bearing binding moieties (e.g., antibodies) directed against the epitope tag or other binding sequence in the fusion peptide, thereby binding the fusion peptide within the column. Thereafter, the fusion peptide can be recovered by washing the column with the appropriate solution (e.g., acid) to release the bound fusion peptide. Optionally, the tag may subsequently be removed by techniques known in the art. The recombinant peptide can also be identified and purified by lysing the host cells, separating the peptide, e.g., by size exclusion chromatography, and collecting the peptide. These and other methods for identifying and purifying recombinant peptides are known to those of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\n \nRelated Peptides\n\n\n \n \n \nIt will be appreciated and understood by one of skill in the art that certain modifications can be made to the therapeutic peptides defined and/or disclosed herein that do not alter, or only partially abrogate, the properties and activities of these therapeutic peptides. In some instances, modifications may be made that result in an increase in therapeutic activities. Additionally, modifications may be made that increase certain biological and chemical properties of the therapeutic peptides in a beneficial way, e.g. increased in vivo half life, increased stability, decreased susceptibility to proteolytic cleavage, etc. Thus, in the spirit and scope of the invention, the term “therapeutic peptide” is used herein in a manner to include not only the therapeutic peptides defined and/or disclosed herein, but also related peptides, i.e. peptides that contain one or more modifications relative to the therapeutic peptides defined and/or disclosed herein, wherein the modification(s) do not alter, only partially abrogate, or increase the therapeutic activities as compared to the parent peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRelated peptides include, but are not limited to, fragments of therapeutic peptides, therapeutic peptide variants, and therapeutic peptide derivatives. Related peptides also include any and all combinations of these modifications. In a non-limiting example, a related peptide may be a fragment of a therapeutic peptide as disclosed herein having one or more amino acid substitutions. Thus it will be understood that any reference to a particular type of related peptide is not limited to a therapeutic peptide having only that particular modification, but rather encompasses a therapeutic peptide having that particular modification and optionally any other modification.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRelated peptides may be prepared by action on a parent peptide or a parent protein (e.g. proteolytic digestion to generate fragments) or through de novo preparation (e.g. solid phase synthesis of a peptide having a conservative amino acid substitution relative to the parent peptide). Related peptides may arise by natural processes (e.g. processing and other post-translational modifications) or may be made by chemical modification techniques. Such modifications are well-known to those of skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA related peptide may have a single alteration or multiple alterations relative to the parent peptide. Where multiple alterations are present, the alterations may be of the same type or a given related peptide may contain different types of modifications. Furthermore, modifications can occur anywhere in a polypeptide, including the peptide backbone, the amino acid side-chains, and the N- or C-termini.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs previously noted, related peptides include fragments of the therapeutic peptides defined and/or disclosed herein, wherein the fragment retains some of or all of at least one therapeutic activity of the parent peptide. The fragment may also exhibit an increase in at least one therapeutic activity of the parent peptide. In certain embodiments of the invention, therapeutic peptides include related peptides having at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, or 100 contiguous amino acid residues, or more than 125 contiguous amino acid residues, of any of the therapeutic peptides disclosed, herein, including in Table 1. In other embodiments of the invention, therapeutic peptides include related peptides having 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, or 50 amino acid residues deleted from the N-terminus and/or having 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, or 50 amino acid residues deleted from the C-terminus of any of the therapeutic peptides disclosed herein, including in Table 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRelated peptides also include variants of the therapeutic peptides defined and/or disclosed herein, wherein the variant retains some of or all of at least one therapeutic activity of the parent peptide. The variant may also exhibit an increase in at least one therapeutic activity of the parent peptide. In certain embodiments of the invention, therapeutic peptides include variants having 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, or 50 conservative and/or non-conservative amino acid substitutions relative to the therapeutic peptides disclosed herein, including in Table 1. Desired amino acid substitutions, whether conservative or non-conservative, can be determined by those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments of the invention, therapeutic peptides include variants having conservative amino substitutions; these substitutions will produce a therapeutic peptide having functional and chemical characteristics similar to those of the parent peptide. In other embodiments, therapeutic peptides include variants having non-conservative amino substitutions; these substitutions will produce a therapeutic peptide having functional and chemical characteristics that may differ substantially from those of the parent peptide. In certain embodiments of the invention, therapeutic peptide variants have both conservative and non-conservative amino acid substitutions. In other embodiments, each amino acid residue may be substituted with alanine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNatural amino acids may be divided into classes based on common side chain properties: nonpolar (Gly, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, Met); polar neutral (Cys, Ser, Thr, Pro, Asn, Gln); acidic (Asp, Glu); basic (His, Lys, Arg); and aromatic (Tip, Tyr, Phe). By way of example, non-conservative amino acid substitutions may involve the substitution of an amino acid of one class for that of another, and may be introduced in regions of the peptide not critical for therapeutic activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, amino acid substitutions are conservative. Conservative amino acid substitutions may involve the substitution of an amino acid of one class for that of the same class. Conservative amino acid substitutions may also encompass non-natural amino acid residues, including peptidomimetics and other atypical forms of amino acid moieties, and may be incorporated through chemical peptide synthesis,\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmino acid substitutions may be made with consideration to the hydropathic index of amino acids. The importance of the hydropathic amino acid index in conferring interactive biological function on a protein is generally understood in the art (Kyte et al., 1982\n, J. Mol. Biol. \n157:105-31). Each amino acid has been assigned a hydropathic index on the basis of its hydrophobicity and charge characteristics. The hydropathic indices are: isoleucine (+4.5); valine (+4.2); leucine (+3.8); phenylalanine (+2.8); cysteine/cystine (+2.5); methionine (+1.9); alanine (+1.8); glycine (−0.4); threonine (−0.7); serine (−0.8); tryptophan (−0.9); tyrosine (−1.3); proline (−1.6); histidine (−3.2); glutamate (−3.5); glutamine (−3.5); aspartate (−3.5); asparagine (−3.5); lysine (−3.9); and arginine (−4.5).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is known that certain amino acids may be substituted for other amino acids having a similar hydropathic index or score and still retain a similar biological activity. In making changes based upon the hydropathic index, the substitution of amino acids whose hydropathic indices are within ±2 is preferred, those which are within ±1 are particularly preferred, and those within ±0.5 are even more particularly preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also understood in the art that the substitution of like amino acids can be made effectively on the basis of hydrophilicity. The greatest local average hydrophilicity of a protein, as governed by the hydrophilicity of its adjacent amino acids, correlates with its biological properties. According to U.S. Pat. No. 4,554,101, incorporated herein by reference, the following hydrophilicity values have been assigned to these amino acid residues: arginine (+3.0); lysine (+3.0); aspartate (+3.0±1); glutamate (+3.0±1); serine (+0.3); asparagine (+0.2); glutamine (+0.2); glycine (0); threonine (−0.4); proline (−0.5±1); alanine (−0.5); histidine (−0.5); cysteine (−1.0); methionine (−1.3); valine (−1.5); leucine (−1.8); isoleucine (−1.8); tyrosine (−2.3); phenylalanine (−2.5); and tryptophan (−3.4). In making changes based upon similar hydrophilicity values, the substitution of amino acids whose hydrophilicity values are within ±2 is preferred, those which are within ±1 are particularly preferred, and those within ±0.5 are even more particularly preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments of the invention, therapeutic peptides include variants having 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, or 50 amino acid deletions relative to the therapeutic peptides disclosed herein, including in Table 1. The deleted amino acid(s) may be at the N- or C-terminus of the peptide, at both termini, at an internal location or locations within the peptide, or both internally and at one or both termini. Where the variant has more than one amino acid deletion, the deletions may be of contiguous amino acids or of amino acids at different locations within the primary amino acid sequence of the parent peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments of the invention, therapeutic peptides include variants having 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, or 50 amino acid additions relative to the therapeutic peptides disclosed herein, including in Table 1. The added amino acid(s) may be at the N- or C-terminus of the peptide, at both termini, at an internal location or locations within the peptide, or both internally and at one or both termini. Where the variant has more than one amino acid addition, the amino acids may be added contiguously, or the amino acids may be added at different locations within the primary amino acid sequence of the parent peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAddition variants also include fusion peptides. Fusions can be made either at the N-terminus or at the C-terminus of the therapeutic peptides disclosed herein, including in Table 1. In certain embodiments, the fusion peptides have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, or 50 amino acid additions relative to the therapeutic peptides disclosed herein, including in Table 1. Fusions may be attached directly to the therapeutic peptide with no connector molecule or may be through a connector molecule. As used in this context, a connector molecule may be an atom or a collection of atoms optionally used to link a therapeutic peptide to another peptide. Alternatively, the connector may be an amino acid sequence designed for cleavage by a protease to allow for the separation of the fused peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe therapeutic peptides of the invention may be fused to peptides designed to improve certain qualities of the therapeutic peptide, such as therapeutic activity, circulation time, or reduced aggregation. Therapeutic peptides may be fused to an immunologically active domain, e.g. an antibody epitope, to facilitate purification of the peptide, or to increase the in vivo half life of the peptide. Additionally, therapeutic peptides may be fused to known functional domains, cellular localization sequences, or peptide permeant motifs known to improve membrane transfer properties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments of the invention, therapeutic peptides also include variants incorporating one or more non-natural amino acids, amino acid analogs, and peptidomimetics. Thus the present invention encompasses compounds structurally similar to the therapeutic peptides defined and/or disclosed herein, which are formulated to mimic the key portions of the therapeutic peptides of the present invention. Such compounds may be used in the same manner as the therapeutic peptides of the invention. Certain mimetics that mimic elements of protein secondary and tertiary structure have been previously described. Johnson et al., Biotechnology and Pharmacy, Pezzuto et al. (Eds.), Chapman and Hall, NY, 1993. The underlying rationale behind the use of peptide mimetics is that the peptide backbone of proteins exists chiefly to orient amino acid side chains in such a way as to facilitate molecular interactions. A peptide mimetic is thus designed to permit molecular interactions similar to the parent peptide. Mimetics can be constructed to achieve a similar spatial orientation of the essential elements of the amino acid side chains. Methods for generating specific structures have been disclosed in the art. For example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,446,128, 5,710,245, 5,840,833, 5,859,184, 5,440,013; 5,618,914, 5,670,155, 5,475,085, 5,929,237, 5,672,681 and 5,674,976, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference, all disclose peptidomimetics structures that may have improved properties over the parent peptide, for example they may be conformationally restricted, be more thermally stable, exhibit increased resistance to degredation, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, related peptides comprise or consist of a peptide sequence that is at least 70% identical to any of the therapeutic peptides disclosed herein, including in Table 1. In additional embodiments, related peptides are at least 75% identical, at least 80% identical, at least 85% identical, 90% identical, at least 91% identical, at least 92% identical, 93% identical, at least 94% identical, at least 95% identical, 96% identical, at least 97% identical, at least 98% identical, or at least 99% identical to any of the therapeutic peptides disclosed herein, including in Table 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSequence identity (also known as % homology) of related polypeptides can be readily calculated by known methods. Such methods include, but are not limited to those described in \nComputational Molecular Biology \n(A. M. Lesk, ed., Oxford University Press 1988); \nBiocomputing: Informatics and Genome Projects \n(D. W. Smith, ed., Academic Press 1993); \nComputer Analysis of Sequence Data \n(\nPart\n 1, A. M. Griffin and H. G. Griffin, eds., Humana Press 1994); G. von Heinle, \nSequence Analysis in Molecular Biology \n(Academic Press 1987); \nSequence Analysis Primer \n(M. Gribskov and J. Devereux, eds., M. Stockton Press 1991); and Carillo et al., 1988\n, SIAM J. Applied Math., \n48:1073.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred methods to determine sequence identity and/or similarity are designed to give the largest match between the sequences tested. Methods to determine sequence identity are described in publicly available computer programs. Preferred computer program methods to determine identity and similarity between two sequences include, but are not limited to, the GCG program package, including GAP (Devereux et al., 1984\n, Nucleic Acids Res. \n12:387; Genetics Computer Group, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wis.), BLASTP, BLASTN, and FASTA (Altschul et al., 1990\n, J. Mol. Biol. \n215:403-10). The BLASTX program is publicly available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and other sources (Altschul et al., \nBLAST Manual \n(NCB NLM NIH, Bethesda, Md.); Altschul et al., 1990, supra). The well-known Smith Waterman algorithm may also be used to determine identity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, using the computer algorithm GAP (Genetics Computer Group, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wis.), two polypeptides for which the percent sequence identity is to be determined are aligned for optimal matching of their respective amino acids (the “matched span,” as determined by the algorithm). A gap opening penalty (which is calculated as 3× the average diagonal; the “average diagonal” is the average of the diagonal of the comparison matrix being used; the “diagonal” is the score or number assigned to each perfect amino acid match by the particular comparison matrix) and a gap extension penalty (which is usually 0.1× the gap opening penalty), as well as a comparison matrix such as \nPAM\n 250 or BLOSUM 62 are used in conjunction with the algorithm. A standard comparison matrix is also used by the algorithm (see Dayhoff et al., 5 \nAtlas of Protein Sequence and Structure \n(Supp. 3 1978)(PAM250 comparison matrix); Henikoff et al., 1992\n, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n89:10915-19 (BLOSUM 62 comparison matrix)). The particular choices to be made with regard to algorithms, gap opening penalties, gap extension penalties, comparison matrices, and thresholds of similarity will be readily apparent to those of skill in the art and will depend on the specific comparison to be made.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRelated peptides also include derivatives of the therapeutic peptides defined and/or disclosed herein, wherein the variant retains some of or all of at least one therapeutic activity of the parent peptide. The derivative may also exhibit an increase in at least one therapeutic activity of the parent peptide. Chemical alterations of therapeutic peptide derivatives include, but are not limited to, acetylation, acylation, ADP-ribosylation, amidation, biotinylation, covalent attachment of flavin, covalent attachment of a heme moiety, covalent attachment of a nucleotide or nucleotide derivative, covalent attachment of a lipid or lipid derivative, covalent attachment of phosphotidylinositol, cross-linking, cyclization, disulfide bond formation, demethylation, formation of covalent cross-links, formation of cysteine, formation of pyroglutamate, formylation, gamma-carboxylation, glycosylation, GPI anchor formation, hydroxylation, iodination, methylation, myristoylation, oxidation, proteolytic processing, phosphorylation, prenylation, racemization, selenoylation, sulfation, transfer-RNA mediated addition of amino acids to proteins such as arginylation, and ubiquitination. (See, for instance, T. E. Creighton, Proteins, Structure and Molecular Properties, 2nd ed., W.H. Freeman and Company, New York (1993); Posttranslational Covalent Modification of Proteins, B. C. Johnson, ed., Academic Press, New York, pgs. 1-12 (1983); Seifter et al., Meth. Enzymol 182:626-46 (1990); Rattan et al., Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 663:48-62, 1992).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherapeutic peptide derivatives also include molecules formed by the deletion of one or more chemical groups from the parent peptide. Methods for preparing chemically modified derivatives of the therapeutic peptides defined and/or disclosed herein are known to one of skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments of the invention, the therapeutic peptides may be modified with one or more methyl or other lower alkyl groups at one or more positions of the therapeutic peptide sequence. Examples of such groups include methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, pentyl, etc. In certain preferred embodiments, arginine, lysine, and histidine residues of the therapeutic peptides are modified with methyl or other lower alkyl groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments of the invention, the therapeutic peptides may be modified with one or more glycoside moieties relative to the parent peptide. Although any glycoside can be used, in certain preferred embodiments the therapeutic peptide is modified by introduction of a monosaccharide, a disaccharide, or a trisaccharide or it may contain a glycosylation sequence found in natural peptides or proteins in any mammal. The saccharide may be introduced at any position, and more than one glycoside may be introduced. Glycosylation may occur on a naturally occurring amino acid residue in the therapeutic peptide, or alternatively, an amino acid may be substituted with another for modification with the saccharide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlycosylated therapeutic peptides may be prepared using conventional Fmoc chemistry and solid phase peptide synthesis techniques, e.g., on resin, where the desired protected glycoamino acids are prepared prior to peptide synthesis and then introduced into the peptide chain at the desired position during peptide synthesis. Thus, the therapeutic peptide polymer conjugates may be conjugated in vitro. The glycosylation may occur before deprotection. Preparation of aminoacid glycosides is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,767,254, WO 2005/097158, and Doores, K., et al., \nChem. Commun., \n1401-1403, 2006, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. For example, alpha and beta selective glycosylations of serine and threonine residues are carried out using the Koenigs-Knorr reaction and Lemieux's in situ anomerization methodology with Schiff base intermediates. Deprotection of the Schiff base glycoside is then carried out using mildly acidic conditions or hydrogenolysis. A composition, comprising a glycosylated therapeutic peptide conjugate made by stepwise solid phase peptide synthesis involving contacting a growing peptide chain with protected amino acids in a stepwise manner, wherein at least one of the protected amino acids is glycosylated, followed by water-soluble polymer conjugation, may have a purity of at least 95%, such as at least 97%, or at least 98%, of a single species of the glycosylated and conjugated therapeutic peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMonosaccharides that may by used for introduction at one or more amino acid residues of the therapeutic peptides defined and/or disclosed herein include glucose (dextrose), fructose, galactose, and ribose. Additional monosaccharides suitable for use include glyceraldehydes, dihydroxyacetone, erythrose, threose, erythrulose, arabinose, lyxose, xylose, ribulose, xylulose, allose, altrose, mannose, N-Acetylneuraminic acid, fucose, N-Acetylgalactosamine, and N-Acetylglucosamine, as well as others. Glycosides, such as mono-, di-, and trisaccharides for use in modifying a therapeutic peptide, may be naturally occurring or may be synthetic. Disaccharides that may by used for introduction at one or more amino acid residues of the therapeutic peptides defined and/or disclosed herein include sucrose, lactose, maltose, trehalose, melibiose, and cellobiose, among others. Trisaccharides include acarbose, raffinose, and melezitose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn further embodiments of the invention, the therapeutic peptides defined and/or disclosed herein may be chemically coupled to biotin. The biotin/therapeutic peptide molecules can then to bind to avidin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs previously noted, modifications may be made to the therapeutic peptides defined and/or disclosed herein that do not alter, or only partially abrogate, the properties and activities of these therapeutic peptides. In some instances, modifications may be made that result in an increase in therapeutic activity. Thus, included in the scope of the invention are modifications to the therapeutic peptides disclosed herein, including in Table 1, that retain at least 1%, at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 55%, at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 81%, at least 82%, at least 83%, at least 84%, at least 85%, at least 86%, at least 87%, at least 88%, at least 89%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, or at least 99%, and any range derivable therein, such as, for example, at least 70% to at least 80%, and more preferably at least 81% to at least 90%; or even more preferably, between at least 91% and at least 99% of the therapeutic activity relative to the unmodified therapeutic peptide. Also included in the scope of the invention are modification to the therapeutic peptides disclosed herein, including in Table 1, that have greater than 100%, greater than 110%, greater than 125%, greater than 150%, greater than 200%, or greater than 300%, or greater than 10-fold or greater than 100-fold, and any range derivable therein, of the therapeutic activity relative to the unmodified therapeutic peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe level of therapeutic activity of a given therapeutic peptide, or a modified therapeutic peptide, may be determined by any suitable in vivo or in vitro assay. For example, therapeutic activity may be assayed in cell culture, or by clinical evaluation, EC\n50 \nassays, IC\n50 \nassays, or dose response curves. In vitro or cell culture assays, for example, are commonly available and known to one of skill in the art for many therapeutic peptides as disclosed herein, including in Table 1. It will be understood by one of skill in the art that the percent activity of a modified therapeutic peptide relative to its unmodified parent can be readily ascertained through a comparison of the activity of each as determined through the assays disclosed herein or as known to one of skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne of skill in the art will be able to determine appropriate modifications to the therapeutic peptides defined and/or disclosed herein, including those disclosed herein, including in Table 1. For identifying suitable areas of the therapeutic peptides that may be changed without abrogating their therapeutic activities, one of skill in the art may target areas not believed to be essential for activity. For example, when similar peptides with comparable activities exist from the same species or across other species, one of skill in the art may compare those amino acid sequences to identify residues that are conserved among similar peptides. It will be understood that changes in areas of a therapeutic peptide that are not conserved relative to similar peptides would be less likely to adversely affect the thereapeutic activity. One skilled in the art would also know that, even in relatively conserved regions, one may substitute chemically similar amino acids while retaining therapeutic activity. Therefore, even areas that may be important for biological activity and/or for structure may be subject to amino acid substitutions without destroying the therapeutic activity or without adversely affecting the peptide structure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, as appropriate, one of skill in the art can review structure-function studies identifying residues in similar peptides that are important for activity or structure. In view of such a comparison, one can predict the importance of an amino acid residue in a therapeutic peptide that corresponds to an amino acid residue that is important for activity or structure in similar peptides. One of skill in the art may opt for amino acid substitutions within the same class of amino acids for such predicted important amino acid residues of the therapeutic peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, as appropriate, one of skill in the art can also analyze the three-dimensional structure and amino acid sequence in relation to that structure in similar peptides. In view of such information, one of skill in the art may predict the alignment of amino acid residues of a therapeutic peptide with respect to its three dimensional structure. One of skill in the art may choose not to make significant changes to amino acid residues predicted to be on the surface of the peptide, since such residues may be involved in important interactions with other molecules. Moreover, one of skill in the art may generate variants containing a single amino acid substitution at each amino acid residue for test purposes. The variants could be screened using therapeutic activity assays known to those with skill in the art. Such variants could be used to gather information about suitable modifications. For example, where a change to a particular amino acid residue resulted in abrogated, undesirably reduced, or unsuitable activity, variants with such a modification would be avoided. In other words, based on information gathered from routine experimentation, one of skill in the art can readily determine the amino acids where further modifications should be avoided either alone or in combination with other modifications.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne of skill in the art may also select suitable modifications based on secondary structure predication. A number of scientific publications have been devoted to the prediction of secondary structure. See Moult, 1996\n, Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. \n7:422-27; Chou et al., 1974\n, Biochemistry \n13:222-45; Chou et al., 1974\n, Biochemistry \n113:211-22; Chou et al., 1978\n, Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. \n47:45-48; Chou et al., 1978\n, Ann. Rev. Biochem. \n47:251-276; and Chou et al., 1979\n, Biophys. J. \n26:367-84. Moreover, computer programs are currently available to assist with predicting secondary structure. One method of predicting secondary structure is based upon homology modeling. For example, two peptides or proteins which have a sequence identity of greater than 30%, or similarity greater than 40%, often have similar structural topologies. Recent growth of the protein structural database (PDB, http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do) has provided enhanced predictability of secondary, tertiary, and quarternary structure, including the potential number of folds within the structure of a peptide or protein. See Holm et al., 1999\n, Nucleic Acids Res. \n27:244-47. It has been suggested that there are a limited number of folds in a given peptide or protein and that once a critical number of structures have been resolved, structural prediction will become dramatically more accurate (Brenner et al., 1997\n, Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. \n7:369-76).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional methods of predicting secondary structure include “threading” (Jones, 1997\n, Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. \n7:377-87; Sippl et al., 1996\n, Structure \n4:15-19), “profile analysis” (Bowie et al., 1991\n, Science, \n253:164-70; Gribskov et al., 1990\n, Methods Enzymol. \n183:146-59; Gribskov et al., 1987\n, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. \n84:4355-58), and “evolutionary linkage” (See Holm et al., supra, and Brenner et al., supra).\n\n\n \nTherapeutic Peptide Conjugates\n\n\n \n \n \nAs described above, a conjugate of the invention comprises a water-soluble polymer covalently attached (either directly or through a spacer moiety or linker) to a therapeutic peptide. Typically, for any given conjugate, there will be about one to five water-soluble polymers covalently attached to a therapeutic peptide (wherein for each water-soluble polymer, the water-soluble polymer can be attached either directly to the therapeutic peptide or through a spacer moiety).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo elaborate, a therapeutic peptide conjugate of the invention typically has about 1, 2, 3, or 4 water-soluble polymers individually attached to a therapeutic peptide. That is to say, in certain embodiments, a conjugate of the invention will possess about 4 water-soluble polymers individually attached to a therapeutic peptide, or about 3 water-soluble polymers individually attached to a therapeutic peptide, or about 2 water-soluble polymers individually attached to a therapeutic peptide, or about 1 water-soluble polymer attached to a therapeutic peptide. The structure of each of the water-soluble polymers attached to the therapeutic peptide may be the same or different. One therapeutic peptide conjugate in accordance with the invention is one having a water-soluble polymer releasably attached to the therapeutic peptide, particularly at the N-terminus of the therapeutic peptide. Another therapeutic peptide conjugate in accordance with the invention is one having a water-soluble polymer stably attached to the therapeutic peptide, particularly at the N-terminus of the therapeutic peptide. Another therapeutic peptide conjugate is one having a water-soluble polymer releasably attached to the therapeutic peptide, particularly at the C-terminus of the therapeutic peptide. Another therapeutic peptide conjugate in accordance with the invention is one having a water-soluble polymer stably attached to the therapeutic peptide, particularly at the C-terminus of the therapeutic peptide. Other therapeutic peptide conjugates in accordance with the invention are those having a water-soluble polymer releasably or stably attached to an amino acid within the therapeutic peptide. Additional water-soluble polymers may be releasably or stably attached to other sites on the therapeutic peptide, e.g., such as one or more additional sites. For example, a therapeutic peptide conjugate having a water-soluble polymer releasably attached to the N-terminus may additionally possess a water-soluble polymer stably attached to a lysine residue. In one embodiment, one or more amino acids may be inserted, at the N- or C-terminus, or within the peptide to releasably or stably attach a water soluble polymer. One preferred embodiment of the present invention is a mono-therapeutic peptide polymer conjugate, i.e., a therapeutic peptide having one water-soluble polymer covalently attached thereto. In an even more preferred embodiment, the water-soluble polymer is one that is attached to the therapeutic peptide at its N-terminus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, a therapeutic peptide polymer conjugate of the invention is absent a metal ion, i.e., the therapeutic peptide is not chelated to a metal ion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the therapeutic peptide polymer conjugates described herein, the therapeutic peptide may optionally possess one or more N-methyl substituents. Alternatively, for the therapeutic peptide polymer conjugates described herein, the therapeutic peptide may be glycosylated, e.g., having a mono- or disaccharide, or naturally-occurring amino acid glycosylation covalently attached to one or more sites thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs discussed herein, the compounds of the present invention may be made by various methods and techniques known and available to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \nThe Water-Soluble Polymer\n\n\n \n \n \nA conjugate of the invention comprises a therapeutic peptide attached, stably or releasably, to a water-soluble polymer. The water-soluble polymer is typically hydrophilic, nonpeptidic, and biocompatible. A substance is considered biocompatible if the beneficial effects associated with use of the substance alone or with another substance (e.g., an active agent such a therapeutic peptide) in connection with living tissues (e.g., administration to a patient) outweighs any deleterious effects as evaluated by a clinician, e.g., a physician. A substance is considered nonimmunogenic if the intended use of the substance in vivo does not produce an undesired immune response (e.g., the formation of antibodies) or, if an immune response is produced, that such a response is not deemed clinically significant or important as evaluated by a clinician. Typically, the water-soluble polymer is hydrophilic, biocompatible and nonimmunogenic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther the water-soluble polymer is typically characterized as having from 2 to about 300 termini, preferably from 2 to 100 termini, and more preferably from about 2 to 50 termini. Examples of such polymers include, but are not limited to, poly(alkylene glycols) such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), poly(propylene glycol) (“PPG”), copolymers of ethylene glycol and propylene glycol and the like, poly(oxyethylated polyol), poly(olefinic alcohol), poly(vinylpyrrolidone), poly(hydroxyalkylmethacrylamide), poly(hydroxyalkylmethacrylate), poly(saccharides), poly(α-hydroxy acid), poly(vinyl alcohol), polyphosphazene, polyoxazoline, poly(N-acryloylmorpholine), and combinations of any of the foregoing, including copolymers and terpolymers thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe water-soluble polymer is not limited to a particular structure and may possess a linear architecture (e.g., alkoxy PEG or bifunctional PEG), or a non-linear architecture, such as branched, forked, multi-armed (e.g., PEGs attached to a polyol core), or dendritic (i.e. having a densely branched structure with numerous end groups). Moreover, the polymer subunits can be organized in any number of different patterns and can be selected, e.g., from homopolymer, alternating copolymer, random copolymer, block copolymer, alternating tripolymer, random tripolymer, and block tripolymer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne particularly preferred type of water-soluble polymer is a polyalkylene oxide, and in particular, polyethylene glycol (or PEG). Generally, a PEG used to prepare a therapeutic peptide polymer conjugate of the invention is “activated” or reactive. That is to say, the activated PEG (and other activated water-soluble polymers collectively referred to herein as “polymeric reagents”) used to form a therapeutic peptide conjugate comprises an activated functional group suitable for coupling to a desired site or sites on the therapeutic peptide. Thus, a polymeric reagent for use in preparing a therapeutic peptide conjugate includes a functional group for reaction with the therapeutic peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRepresentative polymeric reagents and methods for conjugating such polymers to an active moiety are known in the art, and are, e.g., described in Harris, J. M. and Zalipsky, S., eds, \nPoly\n(\nethylene glycol\n), \nChemistry and Biological Applications\n, ACS, Washington, 1997; Veronese, F., and J. M Harris, eds., \nPeptide and Protein PEGylation\n, Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews, 54(4); 453-609 (2002); Zalipsky, S., et al., “\nUse of Functionalized Poly\n(\nEthylene Glycols\n) \nfor Modification of Polypeptides\n” in \nPolyethylene Glycol Chemistry: Biotechnical and Biomedical Applications\n, J. M. Harris, ed., Plenus Press, New York (1992); Zalipsky (1995) \nAdvanced Drug Reviews \n16:157-182, and in Roberts, et al., \nAdv. Drug Delivery Reviews, \n54, 459-476 (2002).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional PEG reagents suitable for use in forming a conjugate of the invention, and methods of conjugation are described in the Pasut. G., et al., \nExpert Opin. Ther. Patents (\n2004), 14(5). PEG reagents suitable for use in the present invention also include those available from NOF Corporation, as described generally on the NOF website (http://nofamerica.net/store/). Products listed therein and their chemical structures are expressly incorporated herein by reference. Additional PEGs for use in forming a therapeutic peptide conjugate of the invention include those available from Polypure (Norway) and from QuantaBioDesign LTD (Ohio), where the contents of their online catalogs (2006) with respect to available PEG reagents are expressly incorporated herein by reference. In addition, water soluble polymer reagents useful for preparing peptide conjugates of the invention can be prepared synthetically. Descriptions of the water soluble polymer reagent synthesis can be found in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,252,714, 5,650,234, 5,739,208, 5,932,462, 5,629,384, 5,672,662, 5,990,237, 6,448,369, 6,362,254, 6,495,659, 6,413,507, 6,376,604, 6,348,558, 6,602,498, and 7,026,440.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypically, the weight-average molecular weight of the water-soluble polymer in the conjugate is from about 100 Daltons to about 150,000 Daltons. Exemplary ranges include weight-average molecular weights in the range of from about 250 Daltons to about 80,000 Daltons, from 500 Daltons to about 80,000 Daltons, from about 500 Daltons to about 65,000 Daltons, from about 500 Daltons to about 40,000 Daltons, from about 750 Daltons to about 40,000 Daltons, from about 1000 Daltons to about 30,000 Daltons. In a preferred embodiment, the weight average molecular weight of the water-soluble polymer in the conjugate ranges from about 1000 Daltons to about 10,000 Daltons. In certain other preferred embodiments, the range is from about 1000 Daltons to about 5000 Daltons, from about 5000 Daltons to about 10,000 Daltons, from about 2500 Daltons to about 7500 Daltons, from about 1000 Daltons to about 3000 Daltons, from about 3000 Daltons to about 7000 Daltons, or from about 7000 Daltons to about 10,000 Daltons. In a further preferred embodiment, the weight average molecular weight of the water-soluble polymer in the conjugate ranges from about 20,000 Daltons to about 40,000 Daltons. In other preferred embodiments, the range is from about 20,000 Daltons to about 30,000 Daltons, from about 30,000 Daltons to about 40,000 Daltons, from about 25,000 Daltons to about 35,000 Daltons, from about 20,000 Daltons to about 26,000 Daltons, from about 26,000 Daltons to about 34,000 Daltons, or from about 34,000 Daltons to about 40,000 Daltons.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor any given water-soluble polymer, a molecular weight in one or more of these ranges is typical. Generally, a therapeutic peptide conjugate in accordance with the invention, when intended for subcutaneous or intravenous administration, will comprise a PEG or other suitable water-soluble polymer having a weight average molecular weight of about 20,000 Daltons or greater, while a therapeutic peptide conjugate intended for pulmonary administration will generally, although not necessarily, comprise a PEG polymer having a weight average molecular weight of about 20,000 Daltons or less.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary weight-average molecular weights for the water-soluble polymer include about 100 Daltons, about 200 Daltons, about 300 Daltons, about 400 Daltons, about 500 Daltons, about 600 Daltons, about 700 Daltons, about 750 Daltons, about 800 Daltons, about 900 Daltons, about 1,000 Daltons, about 1,500 Daltons, about 2,000 Daltons, about 2,200 Daltons, about 2,500 Daltons, about 3,000 Daltons, about 4,000 Daltons, about 4,400 Daltons, about 4,500 Daltons, about 5,000 Daltons, about 5,500 Daltons, about 6,000 Daltons, about 7,000 Daltons, about 7,500 Daltons, about 8,000 Daltons, about 9,000 Daltons, about 10,000 Daltons, about 11,000 Daltons, about 12,000 Daltons, about 13,000 Daltons, about 14,000 Daltons, about 15,000 Daltons, about 20,000 Daltons, about 22,500 Daltons, about 25,000 Daltons, about 30,000 Daltons, about 35,000 Daltons, about 40,000 Daltons, about 45,000 Daltons, about 50,000 Daltons, about 55,000 Daltons, about 60,000 Daltons, about 65,000 Daltons, about 70,000 Daltons, and about 75,000 Daltons.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBranched versions of the water-soluble polymer (e.g., a branched 40,000 Dalton water-soluble polymer comprised of two 20,000 Dalton polymers or the like) having a total molecular weight of any of the foregoing can also be used. In one or more particular embodiments, depending upon the other features of the subject therapeutic peptide polymer conjugate, the conjugate is one that does not have one or more attached PEG moieties having a weight-average molecular weight of less than about 6,000 Daltons.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn instances in which the water-soluble polymer is a PEG, the PEG will typically comprise a number of (OCH\n2\nCH\n2\n) monomers. As used herein, the number of repeat units is typically identified by the subscript “n” in, for example, “(OCH\n2\nCH\n2\n)\nn\n.” Thus, the value of (n) typically falls within one or more of the following ranges: from 2 to about 3400, from about 100 to about 2300, from about 100 to about 2270, from about 136 to about 2050, from about 225 to about 1930, from about 450 to about 1930, from about 1200 to about 1930, from about 568 to about 2727, from about 660 to about 2730, from about 795 to about 2730, from about 795 to about 2730, from about 909 to about 2730, and from about 1,200 to about 1,900. Preferred ranges of n include from about 10 to about 700, and from about 10 to about 1800. For any given polymer in which the molecular weight is known, it is possible to determine the number of repeating units (i.e., “n”) by dividing the total weight-average molecular weight of the polymer by the molecular weight of the repeating monomer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWith regard to the molecular weight of the water-soluble polymer, in one or more embodiments of the invention, depending upon the other features of the particular therapeutic peptide conjugate, the conjugate comprises a therapeutic peptide covalently attached to a water-soluble polymer having a molecular weight greater than about 2,000 Daltons.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA polymer for use in the invention may be end-capped, that is, a polymer having at least one terminus capped with a relatively inert group, such as a lower alkoxy group (i.e., a C\n1-6 \nalkoxy group) or a hydroxyl group. One frequently employed end-capped polymer is methoxy-PEG (commonly referred to as mPEG), wherein one terminus of the polymer is a methoxy (—OCH\n3\n) group. The -PEG- symbol used in the foregoing generally represents the following structural unit: —CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO—(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)\nn\n—CH\n2\nCH\n2\n—, where (n) generally ranges from about zero to about 4,000.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMulti-armed or branched PEG molecules, such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,932,462, are also suitable for use in the present invention. For example, the PEG may be described generally according to the structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwhere poly\na \nand poly\nb \nare PEG backbones (either the same or different), such as methoxy poly(ethylene glycol); R″ is a non-reactive moiety, such as H, methyl or a PEG backbone; and P and Q are non-reactive linkages. In one embodiment, the branched PEG molecule is one that includes a lysine residue, such as the following reactive PEG suitable for use in forming a therapeutic peptide conjugate. Although the branched PEG below is shown with a reactive succinimidyl group, this represents only one of a myriad of reactive functional groups suitable for reacting with a therapeutic peptide.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some instances, the polymeric reagent (as well as the corresponding conjugate prepared from the polymeric reagent) may lack a lysine residue in which the polymeric portions are connected to amine groups of the lysine via a “—OCH\n2\nCONHCH\n2\nCO—” group. In still other instances, the polymeric reagent (as well as the corresponding conjugate prepared from the polymeric reagent) may lack a branched water-soluble polymer that includes a lysine residue (wherein the lysine residue is used to effect branching).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional branched-PEGs for use in forming a therapeutic peptide conjugate of the present invention include those described in co-owned U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2005/0009988. Representative branched polymers described therein include those having the following generalized structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwhere POLY\n1 \nis a water-soluble polymer; POLY\n2 \nis a water-soluble polymer; (a) is 0, 1, 2 or 3; (b) is 0, 1, 2 or 3; (e) is 0, 1, 2 or 3; (f′) is 0, 1, 2 or 3; (g′) is 0, 1, 2 or 3; (h) is 0, 1, 2 or 3; (j) is 0 to 20; each R\n1 \nis independently H or an organic radical selected from alkyl, substituted alkyl, alkenyl, substituted alkenyl, alkynyl, substituted alkynyl, aryl and substituted aryl; X\n1\n, when present, is a spacer moiety; X\n2\n, when present, is a spacer moiety; X\n5\n, when present, is a spacer moiety; X\n6\n, when present, is a spacer moiety; X\n7\n, when present, is a spacer moiety; X\n8\n, when present, is a spacer moiety; R\n5 \nis a branching moiety; and Z is a reactive group for coupling to a therapeutic peptide, optionally via an intervening spacer. POLY\n1 \nand POLY\n2 \nin the preceding branched polymer structure may be different or identical, i.e., are of the same polymer type (structure) and molecular weight.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA preferred branched polymer falling into the above classification suitable for use in the present invention is:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwhere (m) is 2 to 4000, and (f) is 0 to 6 and (n) is 0 to 20.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBranched polymers suitable for preparing a conjugate of the invention also include those represented more generally by the formula R(POLY)\ny\n, where R is a central or core molecule from which extends 2 or more POLY arms such as PEG. The variable y represents the number of POLY arms, where each of the polymer arms can independently be end-capped or alternatively, possess a reactive functional group at its terminus. A more explicit structure in accordance with this embodiment of the invention possesses the structure, R(POLY-Z)\ny\n, where each Z is independently an end-capping group or a reactive group, e.g., suitable for reaction with a therapeutic peptide. In yet a further embodiment when Z is a reactive group, upon reaction with a therapeutic peptide, the resulting linkage can be hydrolytically stable, or alternatively, may be degradable, i.e., hydrolyzable. Typically, at least one polymer arm possesses a terminal functional group suitable for reaction with, e.g., a therapeutic peptide. Branched PEGs such as those represented generally by the formula, R(PEG)\ny \nabove possess 2 polymer arms to about 300 polymer arms (i.e., n ranges from 2 to about 300). Preferably, such branched PEGs typically possess from 2 to about 25 polymer arms, such as from 2 to about 20 polymer arms, from 2 to about 15 polymer arms, or from 3 to about 15 polymer arms. Multi-armed polymers include those having 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 arms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCore molecules in branched PEGs as described above include polyols, which are then further functionalized. Such polyols include aliphatic polyols having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms and from 1 to 10 hydroxyl groups, including ethylene glycol, alkane diols, alkyl glycols, alkylidene alkyl diols, alkyl cycloalkane diols, 1,5-decalindiol, 4,8-bis(hydroxymethyl)tricyclodecane, cycloalkylidene diols, dihydroxyalkanes, trihydroxyalkanes, and the like. Cycloaliphatic polyols may also be employed, including straight chained or closed-ring sugars and sugar alcohols, such as mannitol, sorbitol, inositol, xylitol, quebrachitol, threitol, arabitol, erythritol, adonitol, ducitol, facose, ribose, arabinose, xylose, lyxose, rhamnose, galactose, glucose, fructose, sorbose, mannose, pyranose, altrose, talose, tagitose, pyranosides, sucrose, lactose, maltose, and the like. Additional aliphatic polyols include derivatives of glyceraldehyde, glucose, ribose, mannose, galactose, and related stereoisomers. Other core polyols that may be used include crown ether, cyclodextrins, dextrins and other carbohydrates such as starches and amylose. Typical polyols include glycerol, pentaerythritol, sorbitol, and trimethylolpropane.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs will be described in more detail in the linker section below, although any of a number of linkages can be used to covalently attach a polymer to a therapeutic peptide, in certain instances, the linkage is degradable, designated herein as L\nD\n, that is to say, contains at least one bond or moiety that hydrolyzes under physiological conditions, e.g., an ester, hydrolyzable carbamate, carbonate, or other such group. In other instances, the linkage is hydrolytically stable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIllustrative multi-armed PEGs having 3 arms, 4 arms, and 8 arms are known and are available commercially and/or can be prepared following techniques known to those skilled in the art. Multi-armed activated polymers for use in the method of the invention include those corresponding to the following structure, where E represents a reactive group suitable for reaction with a reactive group on the therapeutic peptide. In one or more embodiments, E is an —OH (for reaction with a therapeutic peptide carboxy group or equivalent), a carboxylic acid or equivalent (such as an active ester), a carbonic acid (for reaction with therapeutic peptide —OH groups), or an amino group.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the structure above, PEG is —(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)\nn\nCH\n2\nCH\n2\n—, and m is selected from 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. In certain embodiments, typical linkages are ester, carboxyl and hydrolyzable carbamate, such that the polymer-portion of the conjugate is hydrolyzed in vivo to release the therapeutic peptide from the intact polymer conjugate. In such instances, the linker L is designated as L\nD\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the polymer may possess an overall forked structure as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,362,254. This type of polymer segment is useful for reaction with two therapeutic peptide moieties, where the two therapeutic peptide moieties are positioned a precise or predetermined distance apart.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn any of the representative structures provided herein, one or more degradable linkages may additionally be contained in the polymer segment, POLY, to allow generation in vivo of a conjugate having a smaller PEG chain than in the initially administered conjugate. Appropriate physiologically cleavable (i.e., releasable) linkages include but are not limited to ester, carbonate ester, carbamate, sulfate, phosphate, acyloxyalkyl ether, acetal, and ketal. Such linkages when contained in a given polymer segment will often be stable upon storage and upon initial administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe PEG polymer used to prepare a therapeutic peptide polymer conjugate may comprise a pendant PEG molecule having reactive groups, such as carboxyl or amino, covalently attached along the length of the PEG rather than at the end of the PEG chain(s). The pendant reactive groups can be attached to the PEG directly or through a spacer moiety, such as an alkylene group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, a therapeutic peptide polymer conjugate according to one aspect of the invention is one comprising a therapeutic peptide releasably attached, preferably at its N-terminus, to a water-soluble polymer. Hydrolytically degradable linkages, useful not only as a degradable linkage within a polymer backbone, but also, in the case of certain embodiments of the invention, for covalently attaching a water-soluble polymer to a therapeutic peptide, include: carbonate; imine resulting, for example, from reaction of an amine and an aldehyde (see, e.g., Ouchi et al. (1997) \nPolymer Preprints \n38(1):582-3); phosphate ester, formed, for example, by reacting an alcohol with a phosphate group; hydrazone, e.g., formed by reaction of a hydrazide and an aldehyde; acetal, e.g., formed by reaction of an aldehyde and an alcohol; orthoester, formed, for example, by reaction between a formate and an alcohol; and esters, and certain urethane (carbamate) linkages.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIllustrative PEG reagents for use in preparing a releasable therapeutic peptide conjugate in accordance with the invention are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,348,558, 5,612,460, 5,840,900, 5,880,131, and 6,376,470.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional PEG reagents for use in the invention include hydrolyzable and/or releasable PEGs and linkers such as those described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2006-0293499. In the resulting conjugate, the therapeutic peptide and the polymer are each covalently attached to different positions of the aromatic scaffold, e.g., Fmoc or FMS, structure, and are releasable under physiological conditions. Generalized structures corresponding to the polymers described therein are provided below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, one such polymeric reagent comprises the following structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwhere POLY\n1 \nis a first water-soluble polymer; POLY\n2 \nis a second water-soluble polymer; X\n1 \nis a first spacer moiety; X\n2 \nis a second spacer moiety;\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nis an aromatic-containing moiety bearing an ionizable hydrogen atom, H\nα\n; R\n1 \nis H or an organic radical; R\n2 \nis H or an organic radical; and (FG) is a functional group capable of reacting with an amino group of an active agent to form a releasable linkage, such as a carbamate linkage (such as N-succinimidyloxy, 1-benzotriazolyloxy, oxycarbonylimidazole, —O—C(O)—Cl, O—C(O)—Br, unsubstituted aromatic carbonate radicals and substituted aromatic carbonate radicals). The polymeric reagent can include one, two, three, four or more electron altering groups attached to the aromatic-containing moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred aromatic-containing moieties are bicyclic and tricyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Fused bicyclic and tricyclic aromatics include pentalene, indene, naphthalene, azulene, heptalene, biphenylene, as-indacene, s-indacene, acenaphthylene, fluorene, phenalene, phenanthrene, anthracene, and fluoranthene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA preferred polymer reagent possesses the following structure,\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwhere mPEG corresponds to CH\n3\nO—(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)\nn\nCH\n2\nCH\n2\n—, X\n1 \nand X\n2 \nare each independently a spacer moiety having an atom length of from about 1 to about 18 atoms, n ranges from 10 to 1800, p is an integer ranging from 1 to 8, R\n1 \nis H or lower alkyl, R\n2 \nis H or lower alkyl, and Ar is an aromatic hydrodrocarbon, preferably a bicyclic or tricyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. FG is as defined above. Preferably, FG corresponds to an activated carbonate ester suitable for reaction with an amino group on therapeutic peptide. Preferred spacer moieties, X\n1 \nand X\n2\n, include —NH—C(O)—CH\n2\n—O—, —NH—C(O)—(CH\n2\n)\nq\n—O—, —NH—C(O)—(CH\n2\n)\nq\n—C(O)—NH—, —NH—C(O)—(CH\n2\n)\nq\n—, and —C(O)—NH—, where q is selected from 2, 3, 4, and 5. Preferably, although not necessarily, the nitrogen in the preceding spacers is proximal to the PEG rather than to the aromatic moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother such branched (2-armed) polymeric reagent comprised of two electron altering groups comprises the following structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein each of POLY\n1\n, POLY\n2\n, X\n1\n, X\n2\n, R\n1\n, R\n2\n,\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nand (FG) is as defined immediately above, and R\ne1 \nis a first electron altering group; and R\ne2 \nis a second electron altering group. An electron altering group is a group that is either electron donating (and therefore referred to as an “electron donating group”), or electron withdrawing (and therefore referred to as an “electron withdrawing group”). When attached to the aromatic-containing moiety bearing an ionizable hydrogen atom, an electron donating group is a group having the ability to position electrons away from itself and closer to or within the aromatic-containing moiety. When attached to the aromatic-containing moiety bearing an ionizable hydrogen atom, an electron withdrawing group is a group having the ability to position electrons toward itself and away from the aromatic-containing moiety. Hydrogen is used as the standard for comparison in the determination of whether a given group positions electrons away or toward itself. Preferred electron altering groups include, but are not limited to, —CF\n3\n, —CH\n2\nCF\n3\n, —CH\n2\nC\n6\nF\n5\n, —CN, —NO\n2\n, —S(O)R, —S(O)Aryl, —S(O\n2\n)R, —S(O\n2\n)Aryl, —S(O\n2\n)OR, —S(O\n2\n)OAryl, —S(O\n2\n)NHR, —S(O\n2\n)NHAryl, —C(O)R, —C(O)Aryl, —C(O)OR, —C(O)NHR, and the like, wherein R is H or an organic radical.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn additional branched polymeric reagent suitable for use in the present invention comprises the following structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwhere POLY\n1 \nis a first water-soluble polymer; POLY\n2 \nis a second water-soluble polymer; X\n1 \nis a first spacer moiety; X\n2 \nis a second spacer moiety; Ar\n1 \nis a first aromatic moiety; Ar\n2 \nis a second aromatic moiety; H\nα \nis an ionizable hydrogen atom; R\n1 \nis H or an organic radical; R\n2 \nis H or an organic radical; and (FG) is a functional group capable of reacting with an amino group of therapeutic peptide to form a releasable linkage, such as carbamate linkage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother exemplary polymeric reagent comprises the following structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein each of POLY\n1\n, POLY\n2\n, X\n1\n, X\n2\n, Ar\n1\n, Ar\n2\n, H\nα\n, R\n1\n, R\n2\n, and (FG) is as previously defined, and R\ne1 \nis a first electron altering group.

Branched reagents suitable for preparing a releasable therapeutic peptide conjugate include N-{di(mPEG(20,000)oxymethylcarbonylamino)fluoren-9-ylmethoxycarbonyloxy} succinimide, N-[2,7di(4mPEG(10,000)aminocarbonylbutyrylamino)fluoren-9 ylmethoxycarbonyloxy]-succinimide (“G2PEG2Fmoc\n20k\n-NHS”), and PEG2-CAC-Fmoc\n4k\n-BTC. Of course, PEGs of any molecular weight as set forth herein may be employed in the above structures, and the particular activating groups described above are not meant to be limiting in any respect, and may be substituted by any other suitable activating group suitable for reaction with a reactive group present on the therapeutic peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThose of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the foregoing discussion describing water-soluble polymers for use in forming a therapeutic peptide conjugate is by no means exhaustive and is merely illustrative, and that all polymeric materials having the qualities described above are contemplated. As used herein, the term “polymeric reagent” generally refers to an entire molecule, which can comprise a water-soluble polymer segment, as well as additional spacers and functional groups.\n\n\n \nThe Linkage\n\n\n \n \n \nThe particular linkage between the therapeutic peptide and the water-soluble polymer depends on a number of factors. Such factors include, for example, the particular linkage chemistry employed, the particular spacer moieties utilized, if any, the particular therapeutic peptide, the available functional groups within the therapeutic peptide (either for attachment to a polymer or conversion to a suitable attachment site), and the possible presence of additional reactive functional groups or absence of functional groups within the therapeutic peptide due to modifications made to the peptide such as methylation and/or glycosylation, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one or more embodiments of the invention, the linkage between the therapeutic peptide and the water-soluble polymer is a releasable linkage. That is, the water-soluble polymer is cleaved (either through hydrolysis, an enzymatic processes, or otherwise), thereby resulting in an unconjugated therapeutic peptide. Preferably, the releasable linkage is a hydrolytically degradable linkage, where upon hydrolysis, the therapeutic peptide, or a slightly modified version thereof, is released. The releasable linkage may result in the water-soluble polymer (and any spacer moiety) detaching from the therapeutic peptide in vivo (and in vitro) without leaving any fragment of the water-soluble polymer (and/or any spacer moiety or linker) attached to the therapeutic peptide. Exemplary releasable linkages include carbonate, carboxylate ester, phosphate ester, thiolester, anhydrides, acetals, ketals, acyloxyalkyl ether, imines, carbamates, and orthoesters. Such linkages can be readily formed by reaction of the therapeutic peptide and/or the polymeric reagent using coupling methods commonly employed in the art. Hydrolyzable linkages are often readily formed by reaction of a suitably activated polymer with a non-modified functional group contained within the therapeutic peptide. Preferred positions for covalent attachment of a water-soluble polymer induce the N-terminal, the C-terminal, as well as the internal lysines. Preferred releasable linkages include carbamate and ester.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally speaking, a preferred therapeutic peptide conjugate of the invention will possess the following generalized structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwhere POLY is a water-soluble polymer such as any of the illustrative polymeric reagents provided in Tables 2-4 herein, X is a linker, and in some embodiments a hydrolyzable linkage (L\nD\n), and k is an integer selected from 1, 2, and 3, and in some \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninstances\n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10. In the generalized structure above, where X is L\nD\n, L\nD \nrefers to the hydrolyzable linkage per se (e.g., a carbamate or an ester linkage), while “POLY” is meant to include the polymer repeat units, e.g., CH\n3\n(OCH\n2\nCH\n2\n)\nn\n,—. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, at least one of the water-soluble polymer molecules is covalently attached to the N-terminus of therapeutic peptide. In one embodiment of the invention, k equals 1 and X is —O—C(O)—NH—, where the —NH— is part of the therapeutic peptide residue and represents an amino group thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough releasable linkages are exemplary, the linkage between the therapeutic peptide and the water-soluble polymer (or the linker moiety that is attached to the polymer) may be a hydrolytically stable linkage, such as an amide, a urethane (also known as carbamate), amine, thioether (also known as sulfide), or urea (also known as carbamide). One such embodiment of the invention comprises a therapeutic peptide having a water-soluble polymer such as PEG covalently attached at the N-terminus of therapeutic peptide. In such instances, alkylation of the N-terminal residue permits retention of the charge on the N-terminal nitrogen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWith regard to linkages, in one or more embodiments of the invention, a conjugate is provided that comprises a therapeutic peptide covalently attached at an amino acid residue, either directly or through a linker comprised of one or more atoms, to a water-soluble polymer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe conjugates (as opposed to an unconjugated therapeutic peptide) may or may not possess a measurable degree of therapeutic peptide activity. That is to say, a conjugate in accordance with the invention will typically possess anywhere from about 0% to about 100% or more of the therapeutic activity of the unmodified parent therapeutic peptide. Typically, compounds possessing little or no therapeutic activity contain a releasable linkage connecting the polymer to the therapeutic peptide, so that regardless of the lack of therapeutic activity in the conjugate, the active parent molecule (or a derivative thereof having therapeutic activity) is released by cleavage of the linkage (e.g., hydrolysis upon aqueous-induced cleavage of the linkage). Such activity may be determined using a suitable in vivo or in vitro model, depending upon the known activity of the particular moiety having therapeutic peptide activity employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOptimally, cleavage of a linkage is facilitated through the use of hydrolytically cleavable and/or enzymatically cleavable linkages such as urethane, amide, certain carbamate, carbonate or ester-containing linkages. In this way, clearance of the conjugate via cleavage of individual water-soluble polymer(s) can be modulated by selecting the polymer molecular size and the type of functional group for providing the desired clearance properties. In certain instances, a mixture of polymer conjugates is employed where the polymers possess structural or other differences effective to alter the release (e.g., hydrolysis rate) of the therapeutic peptide, such that one can achieve a desired sustained delivery profile.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne of ordinary skill in the art can determine the proper molecular size of the polymer as well as the cleavable functional group, depending upon several factors including the mode of administration. For example, one of ordinary skill in the art, using routine experimentation, can determine a proper molecular size and cleavable functional group by first preparing a variety of polymer-(therapeutic peptide) conjugates with different weight-average molecular weights, degradable functional groups, and chemical structures, and then obtaining the clearance profile for each conjugate by administering the conjugate to a patient and taking periodic blood and/or urine samples. Once a series of clearance profiles has been obtained for each tested conjugate, a conjugate or mixture of conjugates having the desired clearance profile(s) can be determined.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor conjugates possessing a hydrolytically stable linkage that couples the therapeutic peptide to the water-soluble polymer, the conjugate will typically possess a measurable degree of therapeutic activity. For instance, such conjugates are typically characterized as having a therapeutic activity satisfying one or more of the following percentages relative to that of the unconjugated therapeutic peptide: at least 2%, at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 15%, at least 25%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 97%, at least 100%, more than 105%, more than 10-fold, or more than 100-fold (when measured in a suitable model, such as those presented here and/or known in the art). Often, conjugates having a hydrolytically stable linkage (e.g., an amide linkage) will possess at least some degree of the therapeutic activity of the unmodified parent therapeutic peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary conjugates in accordance with the invention will now be described. Amino groups on a therapeutic peptide provide a point of attachment between the therapeutic peptide and the water-soluble polymer. For example, a therapeutic peptide may comprise one or more lysine residues, each lysine residue containing an s-amino group that may be available for conjugation, as well as one amino terminus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are a number of examples of suitable water-soluble polymeric reagents useful for forming covalent linkages with available amines of a therapeutic peptide. Certain specific examples, along with the corresponding conjugates, are provided in Table 2 below. In the table, the variable (n) represents the number of repeating monomeric units and “PEP” represents a therapeutic peptide following conjugation to the water-soluble polymer. While each polymeric portion [e.g., (OCH\n2\nCH\n2\n)\nn \nor (CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)\nn\n] presented in Table 2 terminates in a “CH\n3\n” group, other groups (such as H and benzyl) can be substituted therefore.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs will be clearly understood by one skilled in the art, for conjugates such as those set forth below resulting from reaction with a therapeutic peptide amino group, the amino group extending from the therapeutic peptide designation “˜\nNH\n-PEP” represents the residue of the therapeutic peptide itself in which the ˜NH— is an amino group of the therapeutic peptide. One preferred site of attachment for the polymeric reagents shown below is the N-terminus. Further, although the conjugates in Tables 2-4 herein illustrate a single water-soluble polymer covalently attached to a therapeutic peptide, it will be understood that the conjugate structures on the

techniques. In one approach, a therapeutic peptide is conjugated to a polymeric reagent functionalized with an active ester such as a succinimidyl derivative (e.g., an N-hydroxysuccinimide ester). In this approach, the polymeric reagent bearing the reactive ester is reacted with the therapeutic peptide in aqueous media under appropriate pH conditions, e.g., from pHs ranging from about 3 to about 8, about 3 to about 7, or about 4 to about 6.5. Most polymer active esters can couple to a target peptide such as therapeutic peptide at physiological pH, e.g., at 7.0. However, less reactive derivatives may require a different pH. Typically, activated PEGs can be attached to a peptide such as therapeutic peptide at pHs from about 7.0 to about 10.0 for covalent attachment to an internal lysine. Typically, lower pHs are used, e.g., 4 to about 5.75, for preferential covalent attachment to the N-terminus. Thus, different reaction conditions (e.g., different pHs or different temperatures) can result in the attachment of a water-soluble polymer such as PEG to different locations on the therapeutic peptide (e.g., internal lysines versus the N-terminus). Coupling reactions can often be carried out at room temperature, although lower temperatures may be required for particularly labile therapeutic peptide moieties. Reaction times are typically on the order of minutes, e.g., 30 minutes, to hours, e.g., from about 1 to about 36 hours), depending upon the pH and temperature of the reaction. N-terminal PEGylation, e.g., with a PEG reagent bearing an aldehyde group, is typically conducted under mild conditions, pHs from about 5-10, for about 6 to 36 hours. Varying ratios of polymeric reagent to therapeutic peptide may be employed, e.g., from an equimolar ratio up to a 10-fold molar excess of polymer reagent. Typically, up to a 5-fold molar excess of polymer reagent will suffice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain instances, it may be preferable to protect certain amino acids from reaction with a particular polymeric reagent if site specific or site selective covalent attachment is desired using commonly employed protection/deprotection methodologies such as those well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an alternative approach to direct coupling reactions, the PEG reagent may be incorporated at a desired position of the therapeutic peptide during peptide synthesis. In this way, site-selective introduction of one or more PEGs can be achieved. See, e.g., International Patent Publication No. WO 95/00162, which describes the site selective synthesis of conjugated peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary conjugates that can be prepared using, for example, polymeric reagents containing a reactive ester for coupling to an amino group of therapeutic peptide, comprise the following alpha-branched structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwhere POLY is a water-soluble polymer, (a) is either zero or one; X\n1\n, when present, is a spacer moiety comprised of one or more atoms; R\n1 \nis hydrogen an organic radical; and “˜\nNH\n-PEP” represents a residue of a therapeutic peptide, where the underlined amino group represents an amino group of the therapeutic peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWith respect to the structure corresponding to that referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph, any of the water-soluble polymers provided herein can be defined as POLY, any of the spacer moieties provided herein can be defined as X\n1 \n(when present), any of the organic radicals provided herein can be defined as R\n1 \n(in instances where R\n1 \nis not hydrogen), and any of the therapeutic peptides provided herein can be employed. In one or more embodiments corresponding to the structure referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph, POLY is a poly(ethylene glycol) such as H\n3\nCO(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)\nn\n—, wherein (n) is an integer having a value of from 3 to 4000, more preferably from 10 to about 1800; (a) is one; X\n1 \nis a C\n1-6 \nalkylene, such as one selected from methylene (i.e., —CH\n2\n—), ethylene (i.e., —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—) and propylene (i.e., —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—); R\n1 \nis H or lower alkyl such as methyl or ethyl; and PEP corresponds to any therapeutic peptide disclosed herein, including in Table 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypical of another approach for conjugating a therapeutic peptide to a polymeric reagent is reductive amination. Typically, reductive amination is employed to conjugate a primary amine of a therapeutic peptide with a polymeric reagent functionalized with a ketone, aldehyde or a hydrated form thereof (e.g., ketone hydrate and aldehyde hydrate). In this approach, the primary amine from the therapeutic peptide (e.g., the N-terminus) reacts with the carbonyl group of the aldehyde or ketone (or the corresponding hydroxy-containing group of a hydrated aldehyde or ketone), thereby forming a Schiff base. The Schiff base, in turn, is then reductively converted to a stable conjugate through use of a reducing agent such as sodium borohydride or any other suitable reducing agent. Selective reactions (e.g., at the N-terminus) are possible, particularly with a polymer functionalized with a ketone or an alpha-methyl branched aldehyde and/or under specific reaction conditions (e.g., reduced pH).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary conjugates that can be prepared using, for example, polymeric reagents containing an aldehyde (or aldehyde hydrate) or ketone or (ketone hydrate) possess the following structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwhere POLY is a water-soluble polymer; (d) is either zero or one; X\n2\n, when present, is a spacer moiety comprised of one or more atoms; (b) is an integer having a value of one through ten; (c) is an integer having a value of one through ten; R\n2\n, in each occurrence, is independently H or an organic radical; R\n3\n, in each occurrence, is independently H or an organic radical; and “˜\nNH\n-PEP” represents a residue of a therapeutic peptide, where the underlined amino group represents an amino group of the therapeutic peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nYet another illustrative conjugate of the invention possesses the structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwhere k ranges from 1 to 3, and n ranges from 10 to about 1800.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWith respect to the structure corresponding to that referred to in immediately preceding paragraph, any of the water-soluble polymers provided herein can be defined as POLY, any of the spacer moieties provided herein can be defined as X\n2 \n(when present), any of the organic radicals provided herein can be independently defined as R\n2 \nand R\n3 \n(in instances where R\n2 \nand R\n3 \nare independently not hydrogen), and any of the PEP moieties provided herein can be defined as a therapeutic peptide. In one or more embodiments of the structure referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph, POLY is a poly(ethylene glycol) such as H\n3\nCO(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)\nn\n—, wherein (n) is an integer having a value of from 3 to 4000, more preferably from 10 to about 1800; (d) is one; X\n1 \nis amide [e.g., —C(O)NH—]; (b) is 2 through 6, such as 4; (c) is 2 through 6, such as 4; each of R\n2 \nand R\n3 \nare independently H or lower alkyl, such as methyl when lower alkyl; and PEP is therapeutic peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother example of a therapeutic peptide conjugate in accordance with the invention has the following structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein each (n) is independently an integer having a value of from 3 to 4000, preferably from 10 to 1800; X\n2 \nis as previously defined; (b) is 2 through 6; (c) is 2 through 6; R\n2\n, in each occurrence, is independently H or lower alkyl; and “˜\nNH\n-PEP” represents a residue of a therapeutic peptide, where the underlined amino group represents an amino group of the therapeutic peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional therapeutic peptide polymer conjugates resulting from reaction of a water-soluble polymer with an amino group of therapeutic peptide are provided below.

The value of k indicates the number of water-soluble polymer molecules attached to different sites on the therapeutic peptide. In a preferred embodiment, R\n1 \nand R\n2 \nare both H. The spacer moieties, X\n1 \nand X\n2\n, preferably each contain one amide bond. In a preferred embodiment, X\n1 \nand X\n2 \nare the same. Preferred spacers, i.e., X\n1 \nand X\n2\n, include —NH—C(O)—CH\n2\n—O—, —NH—C(O)—(CH\n2\n)\nq\n—O—, —NH—C(O)—(CH\n2\n)\nq\n—C(O)—NH—, —NH—C(O)—(CH\n2\n)\nq\n—, and —C(O)—NH—, where q is selected from 2, 3, 4, and 5. Although the spacers can be in either orientation, preferably, the nitrogen is proximal to the PEG rather than to the aromatic moiety.

The polymers generally possess the following structure, PEG-W—CO\n2\n—NHS or an equivalent activated ester, where\n\n\n \n \n \nW═—O\n2\nC—(CH\n2\n)\nb\n—O— \nb=\n1-5\n\n\n\n \n \n \n—O—(CH\n2\n)\nb\nCO\n2\n—(CH\n2\n)\nc\n \n— b=\n1-5\n, c=\n2-5\n\n\n\n \n \n \n—O—(CH\n2\n)\nb\n—CO\n2\n—(CH\n2\n)\nc\n—O— \nb=\n1-5\n, c=\n2-5\n\n\n\n \n \nand NHS is N-hydroxysuccinimidyl. Upon hydrolysis, the resulting released active agent, e.g., therapeutic peptide, will possess a short tag resulting from hydrolysis of the ester functionality of the polymer reagent. Illustrative releasable conjugates of this type include: mPEG-O—(CH\n2\n)\nb\n—COOCH\n2\nC(O)—NH-therapeutic peptide, and mPEG-O—(CH\n2\n)\nb\n—COO—CH(CH\n3\n)—CH\n2\n—C(O)—NH-therapeutic peptide, where the number of water-soluble polymers attached to therapeutic peptide can be anywhere from 1 to 4, or more preferably, from 1 to 3.\n\n\n \nCarboxyl Coupling and Resulting Conjugates\n\n\n \n \n \nCarboxyl groups represent another functional group that can serve as a point of attachment to the therapeutic peptide. The conjugate will have the following structure:\n\n\n \n \n \nPEP-\nC(O)\n—X-POLY\n\n\n\n \n \nwhere PEP-C(O)˜corresponds to a residue of a therapeutic peptide where the carbonyl is a carbonyl (derived from the carboxy group) of the therapeutic peptide, X is a spacer moiety, such as a heteroatom selected from O, N(H), and S, and POLY is a water-soluble polymer such as PEG, optionally terminating in an end-capping moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe C(O)—X linkage results from the reaction between a polymeric derivative bearing a terminal functional group and a carboxyl-containing therapeutic peptide. As discussed above, the specific linkage will depend on the type of functional group utilized. If the polymer is end-functionalized or “activated” with a hydroxyl group, the resulting linkage will be a carboxylic acid ester and X will be O. If the polymer backbone is functionalized with a thiol group, the resulting linkage will be a thioester and X will be S. When certain multi-arm, branched or forked polymers are employed, the C(O)X moiety, and in particular the X moiety, may be relatively more complex and may include a longer linker structure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolymeric reagents containing a hydrazide moiety are also suitable for conjugation at a carbonyl. To the extent that the therapeutic peptide does not contain a carbonyl moiety, a carbonyl moiety can be introduced by reducing any carboxylic acid functionality (e.g., the C-terminal carboxylic acid). Specific examples of polymeric reagents comprising a hydrazide moiety, along with the corresponding conjugates, are provided in Table 3, below. In addition, any polymeric reagent comprising an activated ester (e.g., a succinimidyl group) can be converted to contain a hydrazide moiety by reacting the polymer activated ester with hydrazine (NH\n2\n—NH\n2\n) or tert-butyl carbamate [NH\n2\nNHCO\n2\nC(CH\n3\n)\n3\n]. In the table, the variable (n) represents the number of repeating monomeric units and “═\nC\n-(PEP)” represents a residue of a therapeutic peptide following conjugation to the polymeric reagent were the underlined C is part of the therapeutic peptide. Optionally, the hydrazone linkage can be reduced using a suitable reducing agent.

Under certain conditions (e.g., a pH of about 7-9 and in the presence of water), the maleimide ring will “open” to form the corresponding maleamic acid. The maleamic acid, in turn, can react with an amine or thiol group of a therapeutic peptide. Exemplary maleamic acid-based reactions are schematically shown below. POLY represents the water-soluble polymer, and ˜S-PEP represents a residue of a therapeutic peptide, where the S is derived from a thiol group of the therapeutic peptide.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThiol PEGylation is specific for free thiol groups on the therapeutic peptide. Typically, a polymer maleimide is conjugated to a sulfhydryl-containing therapeutic peptide at pHs ranging from about 6-9 (e.g., at 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, or 9), more preferably at pHs from about 7-9, and even more preferably at pHs from about 7 to 8. Generally, a slight molar excess of polymer maleimide is employed, for example, a 1.5 to 15-fold molar excess, preferably a 2-fold to 10 fold molar excess. Reaction times generally range from about 15 minutes to several hours, e.g., 8 or more hours, at room temperature. For sterically hindered sulfhydryl groups, required reaction times may be significantly longer. Thiol-selective conjugation is preferably conducted at pHs around 7. Temperatures for conjugation reactions are typically, although not necessarily, in the range of from about 0° C. to about 40° C.; conjugation is often carried out at room temperature or less. Conjugation reactions are often carried out in a buffer such as a phosphate or acetate buffer or similar system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWith respect to reagent concentration, an excess of the polymeric reagent is typically combined with the therapeutic peptide. The conjugation reaction is allowed to proceed until substantially no further conjugation occurs, which can generally be determined by monitoring the progress of the reaction over time.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProgress of the reaction can be monitored by withdrawing aliquots from the reaction mixture at various time points and analyzing the reaction mixture by SDS-PAGE or MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry or any other suitable analytical method. Once a plateau is reached with respect to the amount of conjugate formed or the amount of unconjugated polymer remaining, the reaction is assumed to be complete. Typically, the conjugation reaction takes anywhere from minutes to several hours (e.g., from 5 minutes to 24 hours or more). The resulting product mixture is preferably, but not necessarily purified, to separate out excess reagents, unconjugated reactants (e.g., therapeutic peptide) undesired multi-conjugated species, and free or unreacted polymer. The resulting conjugates can then be further characterized using analytical methods such as MALDI, capillary electrophoresis, gel electrophoresis, and/or chromatography.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn illustrative therapeutic peptide conjugate formed by reaction with one or more therapeutic peptide thiol groups may possess the following structure:\n\n\n \n \n \nPOLY-X\n0,1\n—C(O)Z—Y—S—S-(PEP)\n\n\n\n \n \nwhere POLY is a water-soluble polymer, X is an optional linker, Z is a heteroatom selected from the group consisting of O, NH, and S, and Y is selected from the group consisting of C\n2-10 \nalkyl, C\n2-10 \nsubstituted alkyl, aryl, and substituted aryl, and —S-PEP is a residue of a therapeutic peptide, where the S represents the residue of a therapeutic peptide thiol group. Such polymeric reagents suitable for reaction with a therapeutic peptide to result in this type of conjugate are described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2005/0014903, which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWith respect to polymeric reagents suitable for reacting with a therapeutic peptide thiol group, those described here and elsewhere can be obtained from commercial sources. In addition, methods for preparing polymeric reagents are described in the literature.\n\n\n \nAdditional Conjugates and Features Thereof\n\n\n \n \n \nAs is the case for any therapeutic peptide polymer conjugate of the invention, the attachment between the therapeutic peptide and water-soluble polymer can be direct, wherein no intervening atoms are located between the therapeutic peptide and the polymer, or indirect, wherein one or more atoms are located between the therapeutic peptide and polymer. With respect to the indirect attachment, a “spacer moiety or linker” serves as a link between the therapeutic peptide and the water-soluble polymer. The one or more atoms making up the spacer moiety can include one or more of carbon atoms, nitrogen atoms, sulfur atoms, oxygen atoms, and combinations thereof. The spacer moiety can comprise an amide, secondary amine, carbamate, thioether, and/or disulfide group. Nonlimiting examples of specific spacer moieties (including “X”, X\n1\n, X\n2\n, and X\n3\n) include those selected from the group consisting of —O—, —S—, —S—S—, —C(O)—, —C(O)O—, —OC(O)—, —CH\n2\n—C(O)O—, —CH\n2\n—OC(O)—, —C(O)O—CH\n2\n—, —OC(O)—CH\n2\n—, —C(O)—NH—, —NH—C(O)—NH—, —O—C(O)—NH—, —C(S)—, —CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —O—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—O—, —O—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—O—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—O—, —O—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—O—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—O—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—O—, —O—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—O—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—O—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—O—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—O—, —C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—, —C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—C(O)—NH—, —C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—C(O)—NH—, —C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—C(O)—NH—, —C(O)—O—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—C(O)—O—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—C(O)—O—CH\n2\n—, —C(O)—O—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —NH—C(O)—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—NH—C(O)—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—NH—C(O)—CH\n2\n—, —NH—C(O)—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—NH—C(O)—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—NH—C(O)—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—, —C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —O—C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—, —O—C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —NH—CH\n2\n—, —NH—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—NH—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—NH—CH\n2\n—, —C(O)—CH\n2\n—, —C(O)—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—C(O)—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—C(O)—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—C(O)—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—C(O)—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—NH—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—NH—C(O)—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—NH—C(O)—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—NH—C(O)—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —O—C(O)—NH—[CH\n2\n]\nh\n—(OCH2CH2)\nj\n-, bivalent cycloalkyl group, —O—, —S—, an amino acid, —N(R\n6\n)—, and combinations of two or more of any of the foregoing, wherein R\n6 \nis H or an organic radical selected from the group consisting of alkyl, substituted alkyl, alkenyl, substituted alkenyl, alkynyl, substituted alkynyl, aryl and substituted aryl, (h) is zero to six, and (j) is zero to 20. Other specific spacer moieties have the following structures: —C(O)—NH—(CH\n2\n)\n1-6\n—NH—C(O)—, —NH—C(O)—NH—(CH\n2\n)\n1-6\n—NH—C(O)—, and —O—C(O)—NH—(CH\n2\n)\n1-6\n—NH—C(O)—, wherein the subscript values following each methylene indicate the number of methylenes contained in the structure, e.g., (CH\n2\n)\n1-6 \nmeans that the structure can contain 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 methylenes. Additionally, any of the above spacer moieties may further include an ethylene oxide oligomer chain comprising 1 to 20 ethylene oxide monomer units [i.e., —(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)\n1-20\n]. That is, the ethylene oxide oligomer chain can occur before or after the spacer moiety, and optionally in between any two atoms of a spacer moiety comprised of two or more atoms. Also, the oligomer chain would not be considered part of the spacer moiety if the oligomer is adjacent to a polymer segment and merely represent an extension of the polymer segment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs indicated above, in some instances the water-soluble polymer-(PEP) conjugate will include a non-linear water-soluble polymer. Such a non-linear water-soluble polymer encompasses a branched water-soluble polymer (although other non linear water-soluble polymers are also contemplated). Thus, in one or more embodiments of the invention, the conjugate comprises a therapeutic peptide covalently attached, either directly or through a spacer moiety comprised of one or more atoms, to a branched water-soluble polymer, at in a non-limiting example, an internal or N-terminal amine. As used herein, an internal amine is an amine that is not part of the N-terminal amino acid (meaning not only the N-terminal amine, but any amine on the side chain of the N-terminal amino acid).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough such conjugates include a branched water-soluble polymer attached (either directly or through a spacer moiety) to a therapeutic peptide at an internal amino acid of the therapeutic peptide, additional branched water-soluble polymers can also be attached to the same therapeutic peptide at other locations as well. Thus, for example, a conjugate including a branched water-soluble polymer attached (either directly or through a spacer moiety) to a therapeutic peptide at an internal amino acid of the therapeutic peptide, can further include an additional branched water-soluble polymer covalently attached, either directly or through a spacer moiety comprised of one or more atoms, to the N-terminal amino acid residue, such as at the N-terminal amine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne preferred branched water-soluble polymer comprises the following structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein each (n) is independently an integer having a value of from 3 to 4000, or more preferably, from about 10 to 1800.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso forming part of the invention are multi-armed polymer conjugates comprising a polymer scaffold having 3 or more polymer arms each suitable for capable of covalent attachment of a therapeutic peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary conjugates in accordance with this embodiment of the invention will generally comprise the following structure:\n\n\n \n \n \nRPOLY-X-PEP)\ny \n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein R is a core molecule as previously described, POLY is a water-soluble polymer, X is a cleavable, e.g., hydrolyzable linkage, and y ranges from about 3 to 15.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore particularly, such a conjugate may comprise the structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwhere m is selected from 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet a related embodiment, the therapeutic peptide conjugate may correspond to the structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwhere R is a core molecule as previously described, X is —NH—P—Z—C(O)P is a spacer, Z is —O—, —NH—, or —CH\n2\n—, —O-PEP is a hydroxyl residue of a therapeutic peptide, and y is 3 to 15. Preferably, X is a residue of an amino acid.\n\n\n \nPurification\n\n\n \n \n \nThe therapeutic peptide polymer conjugates described herein can be purified to obtain/isolate different conjugate species. Specifically, a product mixture can be purified to obtain an average of anywhere from one, two, or three or even more PEGs per therapeutic peptide. In one embodiment of the invention, preferred therapeutic peptide conjugates are mono-conjugates. The strategy for purification of the final conjugate reaction mixture will depend upon a number of factors, including, for example, the molecular weight of the polymeric reagent employed, the therapeutic peptide, and the desired characteristics of the product—e.g., monomer, dimer, particular positional isomers, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf desired, conjugates having different molecular weights can be isolated using gel filtration chromatography and/or ion exchange chromatography. Gel filtration chromatography may be used to fractionate different therapeutic peptide conjugates (e.g., 1-mer, 2-mer, 3-mer, and so forth, wherein “1-mer” indicates one polymer molecule per therapeutic peptide, “2-mer” indicates two polymers attached to therapeutic peptide, and so on) on the basis of their differing molecular weights (where the difference corresponds essentially to the average molecular weight of the water-soluble polymer). While this approach can be used to separate PEG and other therapeutic peptide polymer conjugates having different molecular weights, this approach is generally ineffective for separating positional isomers having different polymer attachment sites within the therapeutic peptide. For example, gel filtration chromatography can be used to separate from each other mixtures of PEG 1-mers, 2-mers, 3-mers, and so forth, although each of the recovered PEG-mer compositions may contain PEGs attached to different reactive amino groups (e.g., lysine residues) or other functional groups of the therapeutic peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGel filtration columns suitable for carrying out this type of separation include Superdex™ and Sephadex™ columns available from Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, N.J.). Selection of a particular column will depend upon the desired fractionation range desired. Elution is generally carried out using a suitable buffer, such as phosphate, acetate, or the like. The collected fractions may be analyzed by a number of different methods, for example, (i) optical density (OD) at 280 nm for protein content, (ii) bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein analysis, (iii) iodine testing for PEG content (Sims et al. (1980) \nAnal. Biochem, \n107:60-63), and (iv) sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS PAGE), followed by staining with barium iodide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeparation of positional isomers is typically carried out by reverse phase chromatography using a reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) C18 column (Amersham Biosciences or Vydac) or by ion exchange chromatography using an ion exchange column, e.g., a DEAE- or CM-Sepharose™ ion exchange column available from Amersham Biosciences. Either approach can be used to separate polymer-therapeutic peptide isomers having the same molecular weight (positional isomers).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe resulting purified compositions are preferably substantially free of the non-conjugated therapeutic peptide. In addition, the compositions preferably are substantially free of all other non-covalently attached water-soluble polymers.\n\n\n \nCompositions\n\n\nCompositions of Conjugate Isomers\n\n\n \n \n \nAlso provided herein are compositions comprising any one or more of the therapeutic peptide polymer conjugates described herein. In certain instances, the composition will comprise a plurality of therapeutic peptide polymer conjugates. For instance, such a composition may comprise a mixture of therapeutic peptide polymer conjugates having one, two, three and/or even four water-soluble polymer molecules covalently attached to sites on the therapeutic peptide. That is to say, a composition of the invention may comprise a mixture of monomer, dimer, and possibly even trimer or 4-mer. Alternatively, the composition may possess only mono-conjugates, or only di-conjugates, etc. A mono-conjugate therapeutic peptide composition will typically comprise therapeutic peptide moieties having only a single polymer covalently attached thereto, e.g., preferably releasably attached. A mono-conjugate composition may comprise only a single positional isomer, or may comprise a mixture of different positional isomers having polymer covalently attached to different sites within the therapeutic peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment, a therapeutic peptide conjugate may possess multiple therapeutic peptides covalently attached to a single multi-armed polymer having 3 or more polymer arms. Typically, the therapeutic peptide moieties are each attached at the same therapeutic peptide amino acid site, e.g., the N-terminus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWith respect to the conjugates in the composition, the composition will typically satisfy one or more of the following characteristics: at least about 85% of the conjugates in the composition will have from one to four polymers attached to the therapeutic peptide; at least about 85% of the conjugates in the composition will have from one to three polymers attached to the therapeutic peptide; at least about 85% of the conjugates in the composition will have from one to two polymers attached to the therapeutic peptide; or at least about 85% of the conjugates in the composition will have one polymer attached to the therapeutic peptide (e.g., be monoPEGylated); at least about 95% of the conjugates in the composition will have from one to four polymers attached to the therapeutic peptide; at least about 95% of the conjugates in the composition will have from one to three polymers attached to the therapeutic peptide; at least about 95% of the conjugates in the composition will have from one to two polymers attached to the therapeutic peptide; at least about 95% of the conjugates in the composition will have one polymers attached to the therapeutic peptide; at least about 99% of the conjugates in the composition will have from one to four polymers attached to the therapeutic peptide; at least about 99% of the conjugates in the composition will have from one to three polymers attached to the therapeutic peptide; at least about 99% of the conjugates in the composition will have from one to two polymers attached to the therapeutic peptide; and at least about 99% of the conjugates in the composition will have one polymer attached to the therapeutic peptide (e.g., be monoPEGylated).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one or more embodiments, the conjugate-containing composition is free or substantially free of albumin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one or more embodiments of the invention, a pharmaceutical composition is provided comprising a conjugate comprising a therapeutic peptide covalently attached, e.g., releasably, to a water-soluble polymer, wherein the water-soluble polymer has a weight-average molecular weight of greater than about 2,000 Daltons; and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nControl of the desired number of polymers for covalent attachment to therapeutic peptide is achieved by selecting the proper polymeric reagent, the ratio of polymeric reagent to the Therapeutic peptide, temperature, pH conditions, and other aspects of the conjugation reaction. In addition, reduction or elimination of the undesired conjugates (e.g., those conjugates having four or more attached polymers) can be achieved through purification mean as previously described.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, the water-soluble polymer-(therapeutic peptide) conjugates can be purified to obtain/isolate different conjugated species. Specifically, the product mixture can be purified to obtain an average of anywhere from one, two, three, or four PEGs per therapeutic peptide, typically one, two or three PEGs per therapeutic peptide. In one or more embodiments, the product comprises one PEG per therapeutic peptide, where PEG is releasably (via hydrolysis) attached to PEG polymer, e.g., a branched or straight chain PEG polymer.\n\n\n \nPharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\n \n \n \nOptionally, a therapeutic peptide conjugate composition of the invention will comprise, in addition to the therapeutic peptide conjugate, a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. More specifically, the composition may further comprise excipients, solvents, stabilizers, membrane penetration enhancers, etc., depending upon the particular mode of administration and dosage form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions of the invention encompass all types of formulations and in particular those that are suited for injection, e.g., powders or lyophilates that can be reconstituted as well as liquids, as well as for inhalation.

Preferred, in particular for formulations intended for inhalation, are non-reducing sugars, sugars that can form a substantially dry amorphous or glassy phase when combined with the composition of the present invention, and sugars possessing relatively high glass transition temperatures, or Tgs (e.g., Tgs greater than 40° C., or greater than 50° C., or greater than 60° C., or greater than 70° C., or having Tgs of 80° C. and above). Such excipients may be considered glass-forming excipients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional excipients include amino acids, peptides and particularly oligomers comprising 2-9 amino acids, or 2-5 mers, and polypeptides, all of which may be homo or hetero species.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary protein excipients include albumins such as human serum albumin (HSA), recombinant human albumin (rHA), gelatin, casein, hemoglobin, and the like. The compositions may also include a buffer or a pH-adjusting agent, typically but not necessarily a salt prepared from an organic acid or base. Representative buffers include organic acid salts of citric acid, ascorbic acid, gluconic acid, carbonic acid, tartaric acid, succinic acid, acetic acid, or phthalic acid. Other suitable buffers include Tris, tromethamine hydrochloride, borate, glycerol phosphate, and phosphate. Amino acids such as glycine are also suitable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions of the present invention may also include one or more additional polymeric excipients/additives, e.g., polyvinylpyrrolidones, derivatized celluloses such as hydroxymethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, FICOLLs (a polymeric sugar), hydroxyethylstarch (HES), dextrates (e.g., cyclodextrins, such as 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin and sulfobutylether-β-cyclodextrin), polyethylene glycols, and pectin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions may further include flavoring agents, taste-masking agents, inorganic salts (e.g., sodium chloride), antimicrobial agents (e.g., benzalkonium chloride), sweeteners, antioxidants, antistatic agents, surfactants (e.g., polysorbates such as “\nTWEEN\n 20” and “\nTWEEN\n 80,” and pluronics such as F68 and F88, available from BASF), sorbitan esters, lipids (e.g., phospholipids such as lecithin and other phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, although preferably not in liposomal form), fatty acids and fatty esters, steroids (e.g., cholesterol), and chelating agents (e.g., zinc and other such suitable cations). The use of certain di-substituted phosphatidylcholines for producing perforated microstructures (i.e., hollow, porous microspheres) may also be employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther pharmaceutical excipients and/or additives suitable for use in the compositions according to the present invention are listed in “Remington: The Science & Practice of Pharmacy,” 21\nst \ned., Williams & Williams, (2005), and in the “Physician's Desk Reference,” 60th ed., Medical Economics, Montvale, N.J. (2006).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of the therapeutic peptide conjugate (i.e., the conjugate formed between the active agent and the polymeric reagent) in the composition will vary depending on a number of factors, but will optimally be a therapeutically effective amount when the composition is stored in a unit dose container (e.g., a vial). In addition, a pharmaceutical preparation, if in solution form, can be housed in a syringe. A therapeutically effective amount can be determined experimentally by repeated administration of increasing amounts of the conjugate in order to determine which amount produces a clinically desired endpoint.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of any individual excipient in the composition will vary depending on the activity of the excipient and particular needs of the composition. Typically, the optimal amount of any individual excipient is determined through routine experimentation, i.e., by preparing compositions containing varying amounts of the excipient (ranging from low to high), examining the stability and other parameters, and then determining the range at which optimal performance is attained with no significant adverse effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, however, the excipient or excipients will be present in the composition in an amount of about 1% to about 99% by weight, from about 5% to about 98% by weight, from about 15 to about 95% by weight of the excipient, or with concentrations less than 30% by weight. In general, a high concentration of the therapeutic peptide is desired in the final pharmaceutical formulation.\n\n\n \nCombination of Actives\n\n\n \n \n \nA composition of the invention may also comprise a mixture of water-soluble polymer-(therapeutic peptide) conjugates and unconjugated therapeutic peptide, to thereby provide a mixture of fast-acting and long-acting therapeutic peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional pharmaceutical compositions in accordance with the invention include those comprising, in addition to an extended-action therapeutic peptide water-soluble polymer conjugate as described herein, a rapid acting therapeutic peptide polymer conjugate where the water-soluble polymer is releasably attached to a suitable location on the therapeutic peptide.\n\n\n \nAdministration\n\n\n \n \n \nThe therapeutic peptide conjugates of the invention can be administered by any of a number of routes including without limitation, oral, rectal, nasal, topical (including transdermal, aerosol, buccal and sublingual), vaginal, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous and intradermal), intrathecal, and pulmonary. Preferred forms of administration include parenteral and pulmonary. Suitable formulation types for parenteral administration include ready-for-injection solutions, dry powders for combination with a solvent prior to use, suspensions ready for injection, dry insoluble compositions for combination with a vehicle prior to use, and emulsions and liquid concentrates for dilution prior to administration, among others.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments of the invention, the compositions comprising the peptide-polymer conjugates may further be incorporated into a suitable delivery vehicle. Such delivery vehicles may provide controlled and/or continuous release of the conjugates and may also serve as a targeting moiety. Non-limiting examples of delivery vehicles include, adjuvants, synthetic adjuvants, microcapsules, microparticles, liposomes, and yeast cell wall particles. Yeast cells walls may be variously processed to selectively remove protein component, glucan, or mannan layers, and are referred to as whole glucan particles (WGP), yeast beta-glucan mannan particles (YGMP), yeast glucan particles (YGP), \\\nRhodotorula \nyeast cell particles (YCP). Yeast cells such as \nS. cerevisiae \nand \nRhodotorula \nsp. are preferred; however, any yeast cell may be used. These yeast cells exhibit different properties in terms of hydrodynamic volume and also differ in the target organ where they may release their contents.

For purposes of the present invention, a water-soluble polymer reagent is a water-soluble polymer-containing compound having at least one functional group that can react with a functional group on a peptide (e.g., the N-terminus, the C-terminus, a functional group associated with the side chain of an amino acid located within the peptide) to create a covalent bond. Taking into account the known reactivity of the functional group(s) associated with the water-soluble polymer reagent, it is possible for one of ordinary skill in the art to determine whether a given water-soluble polymer reagent will form a covalent bond with the functional group(s) of a peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRepresentative polymeric reagents and methods for conjugating such polymers to an active moiety are known in the art, and are, e.g., described in Harris, J. M. and Zalipsky, S., eds, \nPoly\n(\nethylene glycol\n), \nChemistry and Biological Applications\n, ACS, Washington, 1997; Veronese, F., and J.

The mPEG-SPC reagent is weighed into a glass vial containing a magnetic stirrer bar. A solution of Peptide G prepared in phosphate buffered saline, PBS, pH 7.4 is added and the mixture is stirred using a magnetic stirrer until the mPEG-SPC is fully dissolved. The stirring speed is reduced and the reaction is allowed to proceed to formation of conjugate product. The reaction is optionally quenched to terminate the reaction. The pH of the conjugate solution at the end of the reaction is measured and further acidified by addition of 0.1 M HCl, if necessary, to bring the pH of the final solution to about 5.5. The conjugate solution is then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and RP-HPLC (C18) to determine the extent of mPEG-N\nter\n-Peptide G conjugate formation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsing this same approach, other conjugates are prepared using mPEG derivatives having other weight-average molecular weights that also bear an N-hydroxysuccinimide moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nb) Peptide G-C\nter\n-mPEG\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn illustrative polymeric reagent, mPEG-NH\n2 \nreagent is covalently attached to the C-terminus of Peptide G, to provide a C\nter\n-conjugate form of the peptide.

A solution of Prot-Peptide G is prepared in N,N-dimethylformamide is added and the mixture is stirred using a magnetic stirrer until the mPEG-NH\n2 \nis fully dissolved. The stirring speed is reduced and the reaction is allowed to proceed to formation of conjugate product. The conjugate solution is then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and RP-HPLC (C18) to determine the extent of Prot-Peptide G-C\nter\n-mPEG conjugate formation. The remaining protecting groups are removed under standard deprotection conditions to yield the Peptide G-C\nter\n-mPEG conjugate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsing this same approach, other conjugates are prepared using mPEG derivatives having other weight-average molecular weights that also bear an amino moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nc) Peptide G-Cys(S-mPEG)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nmPEG-Maleimide is obtained having a molecular weight of 5 kDa and having the basic structure shown below:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nmPEG-MAL, 5 kDa\n\n\n \n \n \nPeptide G, which has a thiol-containing cysteine residue, is dissolved in buffer.

The 10% reagent solution is quickly added to the aliquot of a stock Peptide G solution and mixed well. After the addition of the mPEG-SMB, the pH of the reaction mixture is determined and adjusted to 6.7 to 6.8 using conventional techniques. To allow for coupling of the mPEG-SMB to the peptide via an amide linkage, the reaction solution is stirred for several hours (e.g., 5 hours) at room temperature in the dark or stirred overnight at 3-8° C. in a cold room, thereby resulting in a conjugate solution.

The stirring speed is reduced and the reaction is allowed to proceed to formation of conjugate product. The conjugate solution is then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and RP-HPLC (C18) to determine the extent of Prot-Gastrin-C\nter\n-if/PEG conjugate formation.

A five-fold excess (relative to the amount of the peptide) of the warmed mPEG-SMB is dissolved in buffer to form a 10% reagent solution. The 10% reagent solution is quickly added to the aliquot of a stock Gastrin solution and mixed well. After the addition of the mPEG-SMB, the pH of the reaction mixture is determined and adjusted to 6.7 to 6.8 using conventional techniques. To allow for coupling of the mPEG-SMB to the peptide via an amide linkage, the reaction solution is stirred for several hours (e.g., 5 hours) at room temperature in the dark or stirred overnight at 3-8° C. in a cold room, thereby resulting in a conjugate solution. The reaction is quenched with a 20-fold molar excess (with respect to the peptide) of Tris buffer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsing this same approach, other conjugates are prepared using mPEG derivatives having other weight-average molecular weights that also bear an N-hydroxysuccinimide moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nd) Gastrin-Glu(O-mPEG)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn illustrative polymeric reagent, mPEG-NH\n2 \nreagent is covalently attached to the Glu residue of Gastrin, to provide a Glu-conjugate form of the peptide.

PEG solution (three mol equivalents to the amount of peptide) was freshly prepared by dissolving 880 mg of linear mPEG-ButyrALD-30K PEG in 8.8 \nmL\n 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.0. After vigorous vortexing and 0.22 μm filtration, 8.292 mL of PEG solution was added drop-wise within 30 seconds to the peptide solution while stirring. After 15 minutes, a freshly prepared solution of sodium cyanoborohydride (0.347 mL of 50 mg/mL sodium cyanoborohydride in Milli-Q H\n2\nO) was added (ten mol equivalents to PEG). The reaction mixture was allowed to gently stir at room temperature for 17 hours. The reaction was diluted 1:5 with 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.0, and purified by cation exchange chromatography (HiTrap SP SEPHAROSE HP; 2×5 mL columns connected in series). Multiple loadings were necessary for purification as the resin had a low binding capacity for the PEGylated peptide. A linear gradient (FIG.

Purification buffers were as follows: A: 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.0, and B: 10 mM sodium acetate, 1.0 M sodium chloride, pH 4.0. The diluted reaction mixture was loaded at 1 mL/min with a two column volume wash after the load. The linear gradient consisted of 0 to 60% B over ten column volumes at an elution flow rate of 1 mL/min. The purified mono-conjugate was determined to be 100% pure by reversed phase HPLC (FIG.

The reaction is performed at room temperature. About 5-fold molar excess of mPEG-\nSPC\n 20 kDa reagent is used based upon absolute peptide content. The mPEG-SPC reagent is weighed into a glass vial containing a magnetic stirrer bar. A solution of biphalin prepared in phosphate buffered saline, PBS, pH 7.4 is added and the mixture is stirred using a magnetic stirrer until the mPEG-SPC is fully dissolved. The stirring speed is reduced and the reaction is allowed to proceed to formation of conjugate product. The reaction is optionally quenched to terminate the reaction. The pH of the conjugate solution at the end of the reaction is measured and further acidified by addition of 0.1M HCl, if necessary, to bring the pH of the final solution to about 5.5.

A five-fold excess (relative to the amount of the peptide) of the warmed mPEG-SMB is dissolved in buffer to form a 10% reagent solution. The 10% reagent solution is quickly added to the aliquot of a stock biphalin solution and mixed well. After the addition of the mPEG-SMB, the pH of the reaction mixture is determined and adjusted to 6.7 to 6.8 using conventional techniques. To allow for coupling of the mPEG-SMB to the peptide via an amide linkage, the reaction solution is stirred for several hours (e.g., 5 hours) at room temperature in the dark or stirred overnight at 3-8° C. in a cold room, thereby resulting in a conjugate solution.

The reaction mixture was first diluted 5 fold with solvent A [0.1% TFA in water] to reduce sample viscosity. The diluted sample mixture was loaded onto the CG-71S column at 10 mL/min. After sample loading, the column was first washed with 1 CV solvent A. This was followed by a 30% solvent B [0.1% TFA in acetonitrile] wash until the UV\n280nm \nabsorbance remained constant with time. Two peaks, I and II, were eluted during this step. The column was further washed with 45% solvent B until UV\n280nm \nbecame constant with time. Peak III was eluted in this step. The column was finally washed with 80% solvent B. The flow rate was constant at 10.25 ml/min throughout the purification process. The chromatogram of the loading and elution is shown in FIG. BIP\n4\n.\n1\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe CG-71S column fractions in peaks I, II and III were analyzed by the analytical RP-HPLC method (Table 1). Unexpectedly, peak I comprised highly pure (CAC-20K)\n2\n-biphalin. Most of the free PEG and (CAC-20K)\n1\n-biphalin was washed off in peak II. Although the (CAC-20K)\n2\n-biphalin was the major component in peak III, there was a significant amount of contamination by free PEG and (CAC-20K)\nI\n-biphalin. The average (CAC-20K)-2-biphalin purity in the fractions comprising peak III was estimated at ˜80% by RP-HPLC. To achieve a higher (CAC-20K)\n2\n-biphalin purity, the peak III fractions were reloaded onto the CG-71S column and a linear gradient elution was used for a better separation. The peak III fractions (28 to 31) were pooled and diluted 5 fold with solvent A. The diluted sample mixture was loaded onto the CG-71S column at 10 mL/min. After sample loading, the column was first washed with 1 CV solvent A. A gradient elution of 30 to 45% solvent B was next applied within 15 CV. The flow rate was constant at 10.25 ml/min throughout the purification process. The chromatogram of the loading and elution is shown in FIG.

The purified (CAC-20K)\n2\n-biphalin pool was lyophilized to remove acetonitrile. The lyophilized pellet was reconstituted into 4 \nmL\n 20 mM acetate buffer, pH 4.0. The biphalin concentration in the reconstituted (CAC-20K)\n2\n-biphalin was measured to be 0.93 mg/mL by BCA. The purity was determined at 96.8% by RP-HPLC (FIG. BIP\n4\n.\n3\n). The number-average molecular weight was calculated to be 40952.9 Da by MALDI-TOF (FIG. BIP\n4\n.\n4\n). A final yield of 3.1 mg purified (CAC-20K)\n2\n-biphalin was obtained.\n\n\n \n \nFIG.

BIP\n5\n.\n2\n. The formation of (SBC-30K)\n2\n-biphalin was also confirmed by SDS-PAGE: SDS-PAGE analysis of SBC-30K and biphalin conjugation reaction mixture. The purification of (SBC-30K)\n2\n-biphalin from the reaction mixture was not successful due to the instability of the conjugate, even at acidic pH values.\n\n\n\n \nE BIP6\n\n\nRadioligand Binding Assay for Biphalin Series at Delta, Mu, and Kappa Opioid Receptors\n\n\n \n \n \nThe binding affinities of biphalin (control) and PEG-biphalin releasable and stable conjugates were evaluated using radioligand binding assays in membranes prepared from cells expressing recombinant human μ or δ opioid receptors.\n\n\n \n \nCompetition binding experiments were conducted by incubating membrane protein to equilibrium in triplicate in the presence of a fixed concentration of radioligand and increasing concentrations (0.1 nM to 10 μM) of test compound in 100 μL final volume. The radioligands used were specific for each receptor type, and the assay conditions are described in Table BIP6.3. Following incubations, the membranes were rapidly filtered through GF/B filter plate (presoaked with 0.5% polyethyleneimine), washed four times with cold 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and the bound radioactivity was then measured. Non-specific binding was measured in the presence of excess naloxone (100 μM); this value was subtracted from the total binding to yield the specific binding at each test concentration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor all releasable PEG-biphalin conjugates, except di-mPEG-SBC-30K-biphalin, the receptor-binding activity of both released biphalin and PEG-biphalin (unrelased) conjugates were tested. The test compounds were stored under acidic condition to stabilize the PEG conjugation. To test the activity of PEG-biphalin conjugates, the sample was diluted on the day of the assay. To test the activity of released biphalin, the sample was diluted 10-fold in assay buffer prior to the assay and pre-incubated under physiological-like conditions for a period until ˜50% of biphalin was estimated to be released, based on pre-determined release rates (refer to T BIP6.4).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIC\n50 \n(concentration of test compound required to inhibit 50% of specific binding) values were obtained from non-linear regression analysis of dose-response curves, using GraphPad's Prism 5.01 software, and were calculated for those compounds that showed >50% inhibition of specific binding at the highest concentration tested. K\ni \n(affinity of test compound) was obtained using the Cheng Prusoff correction using experimental K\nd \n(affinity of radioligand) values that were previously determined under these assay conditions. The binding affinities of biphalin and PEG-biphalin conjugates are shown in Tables BIP6.1 and BIP6.2. Biphalin displayed similar, high affinity (3.1-6.5 nM) for human μ and δ opioid receptors, and results were comparable to data published in literature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSince the releasable conjugates were pre-incubated in assay buffer, pH 7.5 at 37° C., biphalin was also pre-incubated for the maximum time to test the activity of the peptide during treatment under physiological-like conditions. Biphalin remained stable following 72 hour incubation as shown in \nFIG. 1\n. Pre-incubated biphalin displayed similar, high affinity for μ and δ opioid receptors when compared to the control prepared on the day of the assay (Table BIP6.1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing pre-incubation of di-CAC-PEG2-20K-biphalin for 72 hours and di-C2-PEG2-20K-biphalin for 20 hours, affinity for μ and δ opioid receptors was increased (compared to PEG-biphalin conjugates prepared on the day of the assay) and regained (FIG. BIP\n6\n.\n1\n and BIP\n6\n.\n2\n); biphalin released from these conjugates retained receptor binding activity as shown by only <4-fold loss in affinity relative to biphalin. Because di-mPEG-SBC-30K-biphalin was known to dissociate rapidly, only the sample pre-incubated for 20 hours was tested. Biphalin released from the SBC linker displayed a 16-fold loss in affinity for μ opioid receptor relative to biphalin; this reduction in affinity may be attributed to the “tag” contained at the PEG conjugation site of biphalin following its release. Affinity was not obtained for the δ opioid receptor as >50% inhibition of specific binding was not achieved at the highest test concentration (1 μM).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe di-CAC-PEG2-20K-biphalin conjugate displayed much lower affinity for both receptors; reduction in affinity was 324 to 649-folds less relative to biphalin. The di-C2-PEG2-20K-biphalin conjugate displayed a 5-fold reduction in affinity at the μ opioid receptor and 41-fold reduction at the δ opioid receptor; this moderate reduction in affinity suggests that the di-C2-PEG2-20K linker may have been unstable in the assay buffer and resulted in faster release of biphalin. Furthermore, the di-C2-PEG2-20K-biphalin conjugate seemed to be more selective for μ opioid receptor compared to δ opioid receptor. The receptor selectivity may have been due to the rate at which each C2-PEG2-20K linker was being released. One hypothesis is that the C2-PEG2-20K conjugated on \nresidue\n 8 was released faster (creating the mono-PEG species conjugated on residue 1) thereby exposing biphalin's structure to specifically interact with the μ opioid receptor site.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs for the stable di-mPEG-SPA-2K conjugate, the loss in affinity for μ and δ opioid receptors was significantly greater as shown in FIG. BIP\n6\n.\n2\nA and BIP\n6\n.\n2\nB. Binding affinity could not be determined because no measurable inhibition of specific binding was detected at the highest test concentration (10 μM).\n\n\n \n \nFIG. BIP\n6\n.\n1\n.

A typical PEGylation reaction was carried out as follows: Peptide stock solution (3 mL) was transferred to an appropriate tube containing a magnetic stir-bar and 5.208 mL of the same buffer was added. While stirring, 3.672 mL of a 100 mg/mL solution of mPEG-Butyr-\nALD\n 40K was added dropwise within 1 minute.

BNP-32 is composed of 32 amino acids with a single disulfide bond. The peptide contains 3 lysine residues and an N-terminus containing a free amine group. Previous PEGylation studies with BNP-32 indicate that all four amine groups are sterically accessible for reaction with PEG reagents. (Miller et al., Bioconjugate Chemistry 2006 March-April; 17(2):267-74). In the current study, the pKa difference between the N-terminal amine and the epsilon amines of the lysine residues was used to specifically acetylate the N-terminus, leaving the lysine amines available for PEGylation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne milligram of BNP-32 was combined with 2 mol equivalents of acetic acid-NHS (previously dissolved in 2 mM HCl) in a total volume of 1 mL in 20 mM MES buffer at pH 6.0 and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. At this pH, one predominant acetylated product was formed based on RP-HPLC analysis. Based on accepted chemical principles known to those skilled in the art, at pH 6.0 the N-terminal amine group is more reactive than the epsilon amines and acetylation would occur predominantly at this position. Also, at lower pH, all amines are less reactive while at higher pH all amines are more reactive. The reaction above was also performed at other pH levels: At pH 4.5 (20 mM citrate buffer) there was significantly lower acetylation for all amine groups, while at pH 7.5 (20 mM HEPES buffer) and pH 9.0 (20 mM boric acid buffer), all amine groups were more reactive and significant acetylation occurred at all four sites as assed by RP-HPLC. Site specificity of the purified reaction products may also be confirmed using methods known to the art such as peptide mapping.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe predominant acetylated product from the reaction performed at pH 6.0 can be purified by standard chromatographic methods. The acetylated peptide can then be PEGylated using any of the reagents that are specific for amine reactive groups and standard methods known to the art, again followed by standard chromatographic methods to purify the conjugate of interest.\n\n\n \nE BNP4\n\n\nPEGylation of BNP-32 with [mPEG-Butyr-ALD-10K]\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA BNP-32 stock solution of 4 mg/mL peptide content was made in 20 mM sodium-citrate buffer pH 4.5 in a sterile low-endotoxin polypropylene tube.

Immediately before a PEGylation reaction was performed, a 100 mg/mL stock solution of [mPEG-Butyr-ALD-10K] was made in the same buffer used to dissolve the peptide. A 50 mg/mL solution of sodium-cyanoborohydride (Na—CNHBr) reducing reagent in Milli-Q water was also made immediately before use. A typical PEGylation reaction was carried out as follows: Peptide stock solution (3 mL, 12 mg) was transferred to an appropriate tube containing a magnetic stir-bar and 8.11 mL of 20 mM sodium-citrate buffer pH 4.5 was added. While stirring, 0.77 mL of a 100 mg/mL solution of mPEG-Butyr-\nALD\n 10K was added drop wise within 1 minute. The reaction was allowed to stir for 15 min after which 0.12 mL of a 50 mg/mL Na—CNHBr solution was added, and the reaction mixture allowed to stir overnight (16-18 h) at room temperature. The resultant reaction mixture contained 1 mg/mL peptide, 2.0 mol equivalents of PEG (with respect to peptide) and 10 mol equivalents of NaCNBr (with respect to PEG). The reaction yields were determined by reversed phase HPLC to be 76% mono-PEG conjugate (N-terminus directed), 10.6% di- and tri-PEG conjugate and 13.4% non-conjugated peptide.

This solution could be stored aseptically for at least 1 week at 4° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmediately before a PEGylation reaction was performed, a 100 mg/mL stock solution of [mPEG2-C2-fmoc-NHS-40K] PEG reagent was made in the same buffer used to dissolve the peptide. A typical PEGylation reaction was carried out as follows: Peptide stock solution (6 mL, 24 mg) was transferred to an appropriate tube containing a magnetic stir-bar and 10.16 mL of 20 mM MES buffer pH 5.8 was added. While stirring, 7.84 mL of a 100 mg/mL PEG reagent solution was added. The resultant reaction mixture contained 1 mg/mL peptide and 2 mol equivalents of PEG. The reaction was allowed to stir for 90 min at room temperature after which a 1/9 volume of 0.2 M glycine solution (in 20 mM MES buffer pH 5.8) was added and the reaction mixture stirred for another 60 min to quench the reaction. These reaction conditions yielded approximately 60% mono-PEGylated peptide. This PEG reagent forms hydrolysable bonds with amine groups and upon hydrolysis, an unmodified peptide is generated. The reaction mixture was stored at 4° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe mono-PEGylated conjugate was purified from the reaction mixture by cation exchange chromatography using Hi Trap SP Sepharose HP media (GE Healthcare). The linear flow rate of the column was 150 cm/h and the sample loading was 1.0 mg/mL of column bed volume (CV) with a column bed height of 11 cm. The buffers used for purification were: Buffer A: 10 sodium-citrate, pH 4.0 and Buffer B: Buffer A+0.8 M NaCl. The PEGylation reaction mixture was diluted with 4 volumes of buffer A. The column was equilibrated in buffer A. The diluted reaction mixture was loaded onto the column and unbound substances washed off the column with 3 column volumes of buffer A. The conjugated peptides were eluted from the column using the following elution steps: (a) linear gradient of 0-4% B over 1 CV followed by a hold at 4% B for 4 CV; (b) linear gradient of 4-50% B over 5 CV followed by a hold at 50% B for 1 CV; (c) step gradient to 80% B followed by a hold at 80% B for 2 CV. The pooled mono-PEGylated fraction was diluted with 4 volumes of buffer A and the purification step repeated. The detection wavelength for preparative and analytical chromatography was 225 nm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFractions collected during cation exchange chromatography were analyzed using reversed-phase HPLC.

The weight range of the animals was 315-358 grams. All animals were food fasted overnight. Prior to dosing, the rats were weighed, the tails and cage cards were labeled for identification and the doses were calculated. Anesthesia was induced and maintained with 3.0-5.0% isoflurane. The JVC and CAC were externalized and flushed with HEP/saline (10 IU/mL HEP/mL saline). The predose sample was collected from the JVC and the catheters were plugged, and labeled to identify the jugular vein and carotid artery. When all of the animals had recovered from anesthesia and the predose samples were processed, the animals were dosed, intravenously (IV) via the JVC using a 1 mL syringe containing the appropriate test article and the dead volume of the catheter was flushed with 0.9% saline to ensure the animals received the correct dose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing a single IV dose, blood samples were collected from groups 1A, 2A, 3A and 4A, at 0 (pre-dose collected as described above), 0.03, 0.33, 2.0, 6.0, 12.0 and 72.0 hours and from Groups 1B, 2B, 3B and 4B at 0 (pre-dose collected as described above), 0.17, 1.0, 4.0, 8.0, 24.0 and 48.0 hours via the carotid artery catheter and processed as stated in the protocol.

Half-life value for released BNP is 1.25 h following C2-FMOC-PEG2-40K-BNP IV bolus administration. Peak concentrations of 1300 ng/mL, a half-life of 15.0 hr and with plasma C2-FMOC-PEG2-40K-BNP concentrations remained above 100 ng/mL up to 24 h supported the prolonged release of BNP in plasma. The observed release of BNP from releasable-PEG C2-FMOC-PEG2-40K-BNP is consistent with the appearance of free PEG-metabolite (PEG-fulvene) which was also released from the conjugate. Binding to cell surface clearance receptors with internalization and degradation, proteolytic cleavage and renal filtration are the possible route of elimination for releasable C2-FMOC-PEG2-40K-BNP.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the non-releasable PEG-constructs, ButyrALD-40K-BNP was observed to have longer half-life, lower clearance and higher exposure than ButyrALD-10K-BNP, probably due to increased PEG-length of the conjugate. No BNP was measurable in plasma following parent BNP administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDue to staggered sample collection, two very distinct concentration-time profiles were observed for two subgroups received ButyrALD-40K-BNP treatment. Therefore, the PK parameters estimated from the pooled data from the two subgroups to be interpreted with caution. ButyrALD-40K-BNP showed higher peak plasma concentration, approximately higher exposure and longer half-life than ButyrALD-10K-BNP when compared using pooled data.\n\n\n \nE PRO1\n\n\nProtegrin-mPEG Conjugates\n\n\n \n \n \na) mPEG-N\nter\n-Protegrin Via mPEG-SPC\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProtegrin is prepared and purified according to standard automated peptide synthesis or recombinant techniques known to those skilled in the art.

PG1-ButyrALD-5K-PG1 appeared to have little hemolytic activity. However, its hemolytic activity was significantly less than PG1. PG1 released from CAC-40K-PG1 exhibited hemolytic activity, however, hemolytic effects from CAC-40K-PG1 that had been preincubated for 96 hr (=5 times of its release t\n1/2\n, ˜19.6 hr) was 60-70% of that from PG1. This loss of activity appears to be mostly due to the degradation of PG1 during preincubation period since PG1 preincubated for 96 hr retained about 60% hemolytic activity compared to that from PG1 preincubated for 0 hr.

The weight range of the animals was 311-346 grams. All animals were food fasted overnight. Prior to dosing the rats were weighed, the tails and cage cards were labeled for identification and the doses were calculated. Anesthesia was induced and maintained with 3.0-5.0% isoflurane. The JVC and CAC were externalized, flushed with HEP/saline (10 IU/mL HEP/mL saline), plugged, and labeled to identify the jugular vein and carotid artery. The predose sample was collected from the JVC. When all of the animals had recovered from anesthesia and the predose samples were processed, the animals were dosed, intravenously (IV) via the JVC using a 1 mL syringe containing the appropriate test article, the dead volume of the catheter was flushed with 0.9% saline to ensure the animals received the correct dose.\n\n\n \n \nFollowing a single IV dose, blood samples were collected into EDTA microtainers containing 75 μL of protease inhibitor cocktail at 0 (pre-dose collected as described above), 2, 10, 30 minutes and at 1, 2, 4, 8, 24 hrs via the carotid artery catheter and processed as stated in the protocol.

The radioligands used were specific for each receptor type, and the assay conditions are described in T OGF7.2. Following incubations, the membranes were rapidly filtered through GF/B filter plate (presoaked with 0.5% polyethyleneimine), washed four times with cold 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and the bound radioactivity was then measured. Non-specific binding was measured in the presence of excess naloxone (100 μM); this value was subtracted from the total binding to yield the specific binding at each test concentration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the releasable PEG-OGF conjugates, the receptor-binding activity of both released OGF and PEG-OGF (unreleased) conjugates was tested. The test compounds were stored under acidic condition to stabilize the PEG conjugation. To test the activity of PEG-OGF conjugates, the sample was diluted on the day of the assay. To test the activity of released OGF, two samples were prepared prior to the assay based on pre-determined release rates (refer to T OGF7.3); one sample was diluted 10-fold in assay buffer (pre-incubated under physiological-like conditions for a period until ˜50% of OGF was estimated to be released) and the other sample was diluted 5-fold in 800 mM lysine solution, pH 10.0 (pre-incubated under forced release conditions for less than 24 hours until ˜95% of OGF was estimated to be released).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIC\n50 \n(concentration of test compound required to inhibit 50% of specific binding) values were obtained from non-linear regression analysis of dose-response curves, using GraphPad's Prism 5.01 software, and were calculated for those compounds that showed >50% inhibition of specific binding at the highest concentration tested. K\ni \n(affinity of test compound) was obtained using the Cheng Prusoff correction using experimental K\nd \n(affinity of radioligand) values that were previously determined under these assay conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe binding affinities of OGF and PEG-OGF conjugates are shown in Table OGF7.1. Opioid growth factor displayed similar, high affinity (1.3-2.0 nM) for human μ and δ opioid receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSince the releasable conjugates were pre-incubated, OGF was also pre-incubated for the maximum period to test the activity of the peptide itself under the pre-incubation treatment conditions. As shown in FIG. OGF\n7\n.\n1\n, OGF remained stable following pre-incubation under physiological-like (160 hours at 37° C., pH 7.5) and forced release conditions (16 hours at 37° C., pH 10.0). Pre-incubated OGF displayed similar, high affinity for μ and δ opioid receptors when compared to the control prepared on the day of the assay (T OGF7.1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing pre-incubation of mono-mPEG2-CAC-40K-OGF for 160 hours and mono-mPEG2-C2-40K-OGF for 68 hours under physiological-like conditions, affinity for μ and δ opioid receptors was increased (compared to PEG-OGF conjugates prepared on the day of the assay) and regained (FIG. OGF\n7\n.\n2\n); OGF released from these conjugates retained receptor binding activity as shown by <9-fold loss in affinity relative to OGF. Similarly, both PEG-OGF conjugates treated under forced release conditions displayed release of active OGF and high affinity binding to μ and δ opioid receptors as shown by <4-fold loss in affinity relative to OGF.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe mono-mPEG2-CAC-40K-OGF conjugate displayed much lower affinity for both receptors; reduction in affinity was 135 to 150-folds less relative to OGF. The mono-mPEG2-C2-40K-OGF conjugate displayed a 2-fold reduction in affinity at the μ opioid and δ opioid receptor; this slight loss in affinity suggests that the mono-mPEG2-C2-40K linker may have been unstable and resulted in faster release of OGF under the assay conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the free PEGs (CAC-40K-fulvene and C2-40K-fulvene), affinity for μ and δ opioid receptors was not seen as expected. As shown in FIG. OGF\n7\n.\n3\n, binding affinity could not be determined for the free PEGs since >50% inhibition of specific binding was not achieved up to the highest test concentration (10 μM).\n\n\n \n \nFIG.

Reactions of insulin with dextran-butyrALD-40K therefore produce a mixture of mono-, di- and tri-conjugated peptides. The relative yields of the mono-, di- and tri-conjugated peptides depend primarily on the molar ratios of insulin and the dextran reagent used in the reactions and the reaction conditions (e.g., reaction time and temperature). The relative yield of the mono-conjugated peptide was determined to be very low unless reaction conditions were selected in which the majority of the insulin remained unreacted. In order to increase the relative and absolute yields of mono-conjugated insulin, a fraction of the amine groups on the peptide were blocked by acetylation prior to reacting the peptide and the dextran reagent. This example will describe the conjugation of both partially acetylated and non-acetylated insulin.\n\n\n \n \nConjugation of Partially Acetylated Insulin with Dextran-butyrALD-40K\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStock solutions of 2.5 mg/mL (430 μM) insulin, 2.24 mg/mL (8.62 mM) sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)-acetate, and 138 mg/mL (3.45 mM) dextran-butyrALD-40K were prepared in DMSO/TEA (95%:5%, v/v), DMSO, and DMSO/TEA (99.35%:0.65%, v/v), respectively. To initiate an acetylation reaction of insulin, in which a fraction of the amine groups on the peptide are acetylated, the insulin and sulfo-NHS-acetate stock solutions were brought to ambient temperature and mixed at a 4:1 ratio (v/v). After 30 min acetylation reaction with stirring, conjugation of the peptide with dextran-butyrALD-40K was initiated by the drop-wise addition of an equal volume of dextran stock solution to the acetylation reaction mixture under vigorous stirring. Tween-20 was then added to a final concentration of 0.05% (v/v) and the reaction mixture was brought to 37° C. with stirring. 20 min after Tween-20 addition, 1 M sodium cyanoborohydride was added to a final concentration of 17 mM and the reaction was allowed to proceed with continued stirring for an additional 20 hours at 37° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDextran-butyrALD-40K-insulin was purified from the reaction mixture by anion-exchange chromatography using Q Sepharose FF (GE Healthcare). Upon completion of the conjugation reaction, the reaction mixture was diluted 1:3 with 20 mM HEPES (pH 7) and the mixture was loaded onto a column packed with Q Sepharose FF resin. Purification buffers were as follows: Buffer A: 20 mM HEPES (pH 7), and Buffer B: 20 mM HEPES, 1.0 M sodium chloride (pH 7). The resin was washed with Buffer B and equilibrated with Buffer A prior to sample loading. After loading, the resin was washed with 10 column volumes Buffer A. Conjugated and nonconjugated peptides were eluted using a two-step gradient consisting of 0 to 25% Buffer B over 25 column volumes and 25% to 75% Buffer B over 5 column volumes at a flow rate of 90 cm/h (FIG.

The nonconjugated insulin can be removed by selective precipitation of the conjugate from a water/DMSO solution (50/50, v/v) through the addition of an organic solvent (for example, acetonitrile). Dextran-butyrALD-40K-insulin is less soluble than nonconjugated insulin in organic solvents and precipitates upon addition of an organic solvent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLyophilized dextran-butyrALD-40K-insulin was dissolved in water to a peptide concentration of 2 mg/mL. An equal volume of DMSO was added to the solution and after thorough mixing acetonitrile was added drop-wise until the composition of the mixture was 25% water, 25% DMSO, and 50% acetonitrile (v/v/v). Precipitated conjugated insulin was collected by centrifugation and re-dissolved in water.

The blue line represents absorbance at 280 nm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFractions containing dextran-butyraldehyde-40K-insulin were pooled, dialyzed against water, lyophilized and stored at −80° C. Removal of nonconjugated insulin from the conjugate sample can be performed by selective conjugate precipitation with an organic solvent as described in the previous section describing the conjugation of partially acetylated insulin with dextran-butyrALD-40K.\n\n\n \nE INS2\n\n\n \n \n \nReceptor binding: In vitro binding of the Insulin-dextran conjugate. The in vitro affinity of the insulin-dextran conjugate for the insulin receptor was evaluated using radioligand binding assays in CHO cells that stably express the recombinant human insulin receptor (CHO-hIR). The CHO-hIR cell line was previously generated and characterized. CHO-hIR cells were plated in 24 well plates and washed with assay buffer containing 120 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgSO\n4\n,9 mM Glucose, 10 mM HEPES, 0.5% BSA, pH 8.0. Competition binding assays were conducted by incubating CHO-hIR cells with increasing concentrations of insulin, dextran insulin and glycine dextran and a fixed concentration (100 μM) of \n125\nI-labelled recombinant human insulin for 4 hours at 4° C. Cells were washed to remove unbound ligands, solubilized with 0.2 N NaOH and bound radioactivity was counted using a gamma counter. Non-specific binding was measured in the presence of excess cold insulin and subtraction of this value from the total binding yielded the specific binding at each test compound concentration. IC\n50 \nvalues were obtained from non-linear regression analysis of specific binding versus concentration curves.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults: The results of the in vitro competition binding assay are shown in FIG. INS\n2\n.\n1\n. Insulin and the Dextran-TEG-butyrlaldehyde-40K acetyl insulin conjugate bound to the insulin receptor with IC\n50 \nvalues of 4.3 nM and 174.9 nM respectively. Dextran conjugation thus resulted in a 40-fold reduction in the binding affinity of insulin. The dextran itself did not display specific binding to the insulin receptor at concentrations up to 1 μM. The insulin-dextran conjugate was 98% pure and contained upto 2% of free and acetylated insulin. It is possible that the specific binding observed with the insulin-dextran conjugate could be result of the free insulin in the sample.\n\n\n \nE INS3\n\n\nEffect of Dextran Conjugated Insulin on the Blood Glucose Levels in the db/db Diabetic Mice\n\n\n \n \n \nDextran conjugated \ninsulin\n 250 ug/mouse was administered by i.p. injection into diabetic mouse that had elevated blood glucose levels. At different time points after dosing blood glucose levels were measured.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPBS saline solution and Dextran equivalent dose were administrated as negative controls. \nInsulin\n 50 ug/mouse was injected as positive control. \nInsulin\n 5 ug/mouse was also given to a group of db/db mice (to test if the 2% free insulin in the 250 ug Dextran-insulin prep; ˜5 ug; would have any effect).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPBS and Dextran injections did not decrease db/db mice glucose levels throughout the whole study.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDextran-Insulin injections dramatically decreased db/db mice glucose levels by ˜40-60% at 1 hr and 2 hr after administrations. However this effect could be due to the free insulin that was in the conjugate preparation. Dextran-Insulin group did show slightly prolonged effect compared to 5 ug/mouse insulin injections.

Glucagon is a 29-amino acid peptide that corresponds to amino acids 33 through 61 of pre-proglucagon, while GLP-1 is produced as a 37-amino acid peptide that corresponds to amino acids 72 through 108 of pre-proglucagon.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen blood glucose begins to fall, glucagon, a hormone produced by the pancreas, signals the liver to break down glycogen and release glucose, causing blood glucose levels to rise toward a normal level. GLP-1 has different biological activities compared to glucagon. Its actions include stimulation of insulin synthesis and secretion, inhibition of glucagon secretion, and inhibition of food intake. GLP-1 has been shown to reduce hyperglycemia (elevated glucose levels) in diabetics. Exendin-4, a peptide from lizard venom that shares about 50% amino acid identity with GLP-1, activates the GLP-1 receptor and likewise has been shown to reduce hyperglycemia in diabetics.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) is a 42-amino acid gastrointestinal regulatory peptide that stimulates insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells in the presence of glucose. It is derived by proteolytic processing from a 133-amino acid precursor, preproGIP.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY\n\n\n \n \n \nAs disclosed herein, glucagon peptides are provided that are analogs of native glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 1) and that exhibit GIP activity. The invention also provides methods of using such peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNative glucagon does not activate the GIP receptor, and normally has about 1% of the activity of native-GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor. Modifications to the native glucagon sequence described herein produce glucagon peptides that can exhibit potent glucagon activity equivalent to or better than the activity of native glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 1), potent GIP activity equivalent to or better than the activity of native GIP (SEQ ID NO: 4), and/or potent GLP-1 activity equivalent to or better than the activity of native GLP-1. GLP-1(7-36) amide (SEQ ID NO: 3) or GLP-1(7-37) (acid) (SEQ ID NO: 2) are biologically potent forms of GLP-1, that demonstrate essentially equivalent activity at the GLP-1 receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe data described herein show that peptides having both GIP activity and GLP-1 activity are particularly advantageous for inducing weight loss or preventing weight gain, as well as for treating hyperglycemia, including diabetes. In vivo data disclosed herein demonstrate that the combination of GIP agonist activity with GLP-1 agonist activity produces a greater effect on weight reduction than GLP-1 alone. This activity is particularly unexpected in view of teachings in the art that antagonizing GIP is desirable for reducing daily food intake and body weight, and increasing insulin sensitivity and energy expenditure. (Irwin et al., Diabetologia 50: 1532-1540 (2007); and Althage et al., J Biol Chem, e-publication on Apr. 17, 2008).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, in one aspect, the invention provides methods for inducing weight loss or preventing weight gain, which involve administering to a patient in need thereof an effective amount of a compound, e.g. a glucagon peptide, that exhibits activity at both the GIP receptor and the GLP-1 receptor, and that optionally also exhibits activity at the glucagon receptor. Such compounds include the GIP/GLP-1 co-agonists and glucagon/GIP/GLP-1 tri-agonists described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIncreased activity at the GIP receptor is provided by an amino acid modification at \nposition\n 1. For example, His at \nposition\n 1 is substituted with a large, aromatic amino acid, optionally Tyr, Phe, Trp, amino-Phe, nitro-Phe, chloro-Phe, sulfo-Phe, 4-pyridyl-Ala, methyl-Tyr, or 3-amino Tyr.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIncreased activity at the GIP receptor is provided by modifications that stabilize the alpha helix structure of the C-terminal portion (amino acids 12-29) of the glucagon peptide or analog thereof. For example, an intramolecular bridge can be formed by a covalent bond between the side chains of two amino acids at positions i and i+4 or between positions j and j+3, or between positions k and k+7. In exemplary embodiments, the bridge is between \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n 12 and 16, 16 and 20, 20 and 24, 24 and 28, or 17 and 20. In other embodiments, non-covalent interactions such as salt bridges can be formed between positively and negatively charged amino acids at these positions. Alternatively, for example, stabilization of the alpha helix structure in the C-terminal portion of the glucagon peptide (around amino acids 12-29) is achieved through purposeful introduction of one or more α,α-disubstituted amino acids at positions that retain the desired activity. In some embodiments, one, two, three, four or more of \npositions\n 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24 or 29 of a glucagon peptide or analog thereof is substituted with an α,α-disubstituted amino acid. For example, substitution of position 16 of a glucagon peptide or analog thereof with amino iso-butyric acid (AIB) provides a stabilized alpha helix in the absence of a salt bridge or lactam. Such peptides are considered herein as a peptide lacking an intramolecular bridge. In specific aspects, stabilization of the alpha-helix is accomplished by introducing one or more α,α-disubstituted amino acids without introduction of a covalent intramolecular bridge, e.g., a lactam bridge, a disulfide bridge. Such peptides are considered herein as a peptide lacking a covalent intramolecular bridge. In some embodiments, one, two, three or more of \npositions\n 16, 20, 21 or 24 are substituted with AIB.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIncreased activity at the GIP receptor is provided by amino acid modifications at positions 27 and/or 28, and optionally at position 29. For example, the Met at position 27 is substituted with a large aliphatic amino acid, optionally Leu, the Asn at position 28 is substituted with a small aliphatic amino acid, optionally Ala, and the Thr at position 29 is substituted with a small aliphatic amino acid, optionally Gly.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIncreased activity at the GIP receptor is also provided by an amino acid modification at \nposition\n 12. For example, \nposition\n 12 is substituted with a large, aliphatic, nonpolar amino acid, optionally Ile.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIncreased activity at the GIP receptor is also provided by an amino acid modification at positions 17 and/or 18. For example, position 17 is substituted with a polar residue, optionally Gln, and position 18 is substituted with a small aliphatic amino acid, optionally Ala.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIncreased activity at the glucagon receptor is provided by an amino acid modification at position 16 of native glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 1) as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReduced, maintained, or increased activity at the glucagon receptor is provided, e.g., by an amino acid modification at \nposition\n 3 as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRestoration of glucagon activity which has been reduced by amino acid modifications at \npositions\n 1 and/or 2 is provided by modifications that stabilize the alpha helix structure of the C-terminal portion (amino acids 12-29) of the glucagon peptide or analog thereof. For example, an intramolecular bridge can be formed by a covalent bond between the side chains of two amino acids at positions i and i+4 or between positions j and j+3, or between positions k and k+7. In other embodiments, non-covalent interactions such as salt bridges can be formed between positively and negatively charged amino acids at these positions. In yet other embodiments, one or more α,α-disubstituted amino acids are inserted or substituted into this C-terminal portion (amino acids 12-29) at positions that retain the desired activity. For example, one, two, three or all of \npositions\n 16, 20, 21 or 24 are substituted with an α,α-disubstituted amino acid, e.g., AIB.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIncreased activity at the GLP-1 receptor is provided by replacing the carboxylic acid of the C-terminal amino acid with a charge-neutral group, such as an amide or ester.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIncreased activity at the GLP-1 receptor is provided by modifications that stabilize alpha-helix structure in the C-terminal portion (around amino acids 12-29) of the glucagon peptide or analog thereof. In some embodiments, an intramolecular bridge can be formed by a covalent bond between the side chains of two amino acids at positions i and i+4 or between positions j and j+3, or between positions k and k+7. In other embodiments, non-covalent interactions such as salt bridges can be formed between positively and negatively charged amino acids at these positions. In yet other embodiments, one or more α,α-disubstituted amino acids are inserted or substituted into this C-terminal portion (amino acids 12-29) at positions that retain the desired activity. For example, one, two, three or all of \npositions\n 16, 20, 21 or 24 are substituted with an α,α-disubstituted amino acid, e.g., AIB.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIncreased activity at the GLP-1 receptor is provided by an amino acid modification at \nposition\n 20 as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIncreased activity at the GLP-1 receptor is provided by adding a C-terminal extension peptide such as GPSSGAPPPS (SEQ ID NO: 95) or XGPSSGAPPPS (SEQ ID NO: 96) to the C-terminus. GLP-1 activity in such analogs can be further increased by modifying the amino acid at position 18, 28 or 29, or at position 18 and 29, as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA further modest increase in GLP-1 potency is provided by modifying the amino acid at \nposition\n 10 to be a large, aromatic amino acid residue, optionally Trp.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReduced activity at the GLP-1 receptor is provided, e.g., by an amino acid modification at \nposition\n 7, a deletion of the amino acid(s) C-terminal to the amino acid at position 27 or 28, yielding a 27- or 28-amino acid peptide, or a combination thereof, as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreservation of activity after pegylation is provided by the addition of GPSSGAPPPS (SEQ ID NO: 95) to the C-terminus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs demonstrated herein, maintained or increased activity at each of the glucagon receptor, GLP-1 receptor, and GIP receptor (in comparison to a lactam-containing, GIP-active, glucagon-based analog) is provided by (i) an amino acid substitution of Ser at position 16 with an amino acid of Formula IV:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein n is 1 to 16, or 1 to 10, or 1 to 7, or 1 to 6, or 2 to 6, or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5, each of R\n1 \nand R\n2 \nis independently selected from the group consisting of H, C\n1\n-C\n18 \nalkyl, (C\n1\n-C\n18 \nalkyl)OH, (C\n1\n-C\n18 \nalkyl)NH\n2\n, (C\n1\n-C\n18 \nalkyl)SH, (C\n0\n-C\n4 \nalkyl)(C\n3\n-C\n6\n)cycloalkyl, (C\n0\n-C\n4 \nalkyl)(C\n2\n-C\n5 \nheterocyclic), (C\n0\n-C\n4 \nalkyl)(C\n6\n-C\n10 \naryl)R\n7\n, and (C\n1\n-C\n4 \nalkyl)(C\n3\n-C\n9 \nheteroaryl), wherein R\n7 \nis H or OH, and the side chain of the amino acid of Formula IV comprises a free amino group, and (ii) an amino acid substitution of the Gln at \nposition\n 20 with an alpha, alpha-disubstituted amino acid, e.g., AIB. In some embodiments, the amino acid at position 16 is Lys and the amino acid at \nposition\n 20 is AIB.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe activity at each of the glucagon receptor, GLP-1 receptor, and GIP receptor of the analog comprising an amino acid of Formula IV at position 16 and an alpha, alpha di-substituted amino acid at \nposition\n 20 can be further enhanced by extending the length of the peptide, e.g. by fusion to a C-terminal extension peptide, e.g. of about 1-21, about 9 to 21, about 6-18, about 9-12, or about 10 or 11 amino acids in length. In some embodiments, the C-terminus is extended by fusion to GPSSGAPPPS (SEQ ID NO: 95) or XGPSSGAPPPS (SEQ ID NO: 96), wherein X is Gly or a small, aliphatic or non-polar or slightly polar amino acid. In alternative embodiments, the C-terminus is extended by fusion to GPSSGAPPPS (SEQ ID NO: 95) and 1-11 amino acids (e.g., 1-5, or 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 amino acids) are fused to the C-terminus of GPSSGAPPPS (SEQ ID NO: 95). The 1-11 amino acids at the C-terminus of GPSSGAPPPS (SEQ ID NO: 95) can comprise, for example, one or more small aliphatic amino acids, such as Ala or Gly. In this regard, the C-terminal extension can be, for example, GPSSGAPPPSX\nm\n, wherein m is 1 to 11 (e.g., 1 to 5) and X is Ala or Gly. Alternatively, the 1 to 11 (e.g., 1 to 5) amino acids fused to the C-terminus of SEQ ID NO: 95 may be a combination of different small aliphatic amino acids. For example, the 1 to 11 (e.g., 1 to 5) amino acids may be a combination of Ala and Gly residues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnhancement of activity at each of the glucagon, GLP-1, and GIP receptors of a GIP-active, glucagon-based analog, including an analog comprising an amino acid of Formula IV at position 16 and an alpha, alpha disubstituted amino acid at \nposition\n 20, can furthermore be achieved upon acylation or alkylation of an amino acid located within a C-terminal extension or at the C-terminal amino acid (e.g., an amino acid which is added to the C-terminus of the C-terminal extension). The acylation or alkylation can be of an amino acid located at, for example, any of \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, and 50. In some embodiments, the amino acid which is acylated or alkylated is located at \nposition\n 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, or 43. In some embodiments, the acylated or alkylated amino acid is a Lys which is attached to an acyl or alkyl group, e.g. C10-C22. In certain embodiments, the Lys is located C-terminal to a C-terminal extension consisting of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 95, such that the Lys is located at \nposition\n 40 of the analog. Optionally, acylated, C-terminally extended peptides are also pegylated, e.g. at position 24.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnhancement of the activity at each of the glucagon, GLP-1, and GIP receptors of a GIP-active, glucagon-based analog can moreover be achieved by acylation or alkylation of an amino acid via a spacer (e.g., an amino acid, dipeptide, tripeptide, hydrophilic bifunctional spacer, hydrophobic bifunctional spacer). In some embodiments, the GIP-active, glucagon-based analog comprises an acyl or alkyl group via a spacer, which spacer is attached to the side chain of the amino acid at \nposition\n 10 or \nposition\n 40 of the analog. In other embodiments, the analog comprises a C-terminal extension of 1 to 21 amino acids C-terminal to the amino acid at position 29 and the spacer, which is covalently attached to an acyl or alkyl group, is attached to an amino acid of the extension at a position corresponding to one of positions 37-43 relative to SEQ ID NO: 1. In certain embodiments, the spacer is 3 to 10 atoms in length. In specific aspects, the total length of the spacer and acyl or alkyl group is about 14 to about 28 atoms in length. Suitable spacers for purposes of increasing activity at one or more of the glucagon, GLP-1, and GIP receptors are further described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny of the modifications described above which increase or decrease GIP activity, which increase or decrease glucagon receptor activity, and which increase or decrease GLP-1 receptor activity can be applied individually or in combination. Any of the modifications described above can also be combined with other modifications that confer other desirable properties, such as increased solubility and/or stability and/or duration of action. Alternatively, any of the modifications described above can be combined with other modifications that do not substantially affect solubility or stability or activity. Exemplary modifications include but are not limited to:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(A) Improving solubility, for example, by introducing one, two, three or more charged amino acid(s) to the C-terminal portion of native glucagon, preferably at a position C-terminal to position 27. Such a charged amino acid can be introduced by substituting a native amino acid with a charged amino acid, e.g. at positions 28 or 29, or alternatively by adding a charged amino acid, e.g. after position 27, 28 or 29. In exemplary embodiments, one, two, three or all of the charged amino acids are negatively charged. In other embodiments, one, two, three or all of the charged amino acids are positively charged. Such modifications increase solubility, e.g. provide at least 2-fold, 5-fold, 10-fold, 15-fold, 25-fold, 30-fold or greater solubility relative to native glucagon at a given pH between about 5.5 and 8, e.g., \npH\n 7, when measured after 24 hours at 25° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(B) Increasing solubility and duration of action or half-life in circulation by addition of a hydrophilic moiety such as a polyethylene glycol chain, as described herein, e.g. at \nposition\n 16, 17, 20, 21, 24 or 29, within a C-terminal extension, or at the C-terminal amino acid of the peptide,\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(C) Increasing solubility and/or duration of action or half-life in circulation and/or delaying the onset of action by acylation or alkylation of the glucagon peptide, as described herein;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(D) Increasing duration of action or half-life in circulation through introducing resistance to dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) cleavage by modification of the amino acid at \n \nposition\n \n 1 or 2 as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(E) Increasing stability by modification of the Asp at \nposition\n 15, for example, by deletion or substitution with glutamic acid, homoglutamic acid, cysteic acid or homocysteic acid. Such modifications can reduce degradation or cleavage at a pH within the range of 5.5 to 8, for example, retaining at least 75%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99%, up to 100% of the original peptide after 24 hours at 25° C. Such modifications reduce cleavage of the peptide bond between Asp15-Ser16.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(F) Increasing stability by modification of the Ser at position 16, for example by substitution with Thr or AIB. Such modifications also reduce cleavage of the peptide bond between Asp15-Ser16.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(G) Increasing stability by modification of the methionine at position 27, for example, by substitution with leucine or norleucine. Such modifications can reduce oxidative degradation. Stability can also be increased by modification of the Gln at \nposition\n 20 or 24, e.g. by substitution with Ala, Ser, Thr, or AIB. Such modifications can reduce degradation that occurs through deamidation of Gln. Stability can be increased by modification of Asp at position 21, e.g. by substitution with Glu. Such modifications can reduce degradation that occurs through dehydration of Asp to form a cyclic succinimide intermediate followed by isomerization to iso-aspartate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(H) Non-conservative or conservative substitutions, additions or deletions that do not substantially affect activity, for example, conservative substitutions at one or more of \n \n \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n \n \n 2, 5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 27, 28 or 29; substitution of one or more of these positions with Ala; deletion of amino acids at one or more of positions 27, 28 or 29; or deletion of amino acid 29 optionally combined with a C-terminal amide or ester in place of the C-terminal carboxylic acid group; substitution of Lys at \nposition\n 12 with Arg; substitution of Tyr at \nposition\n 10 with Val or Phe;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the glucagon peptides described herein exhibit an EC50 for GIP receptor activation activity of about 100 nM or less, or about 75, 50, 25, 10, 8, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1 nM or less. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptides described herein exhibit an EC50 at the GIP receptor that is about 0.001 nM, 0.01 nM, or 0.1 nM. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptides described herein exhibit an EC50 at the GIP receptor that is no more than about 1 nM, 2 nM, 3 nM, 4 nM, 5 nM, 6 nM, 8 nM, 10 nM, 15 nM, 20 nM, 25 nM, 30 nM, 40 nM, 50 nM, 75 nM, or 100 nM. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptides exhibit an EC50 for glucagon receptor activation of about 100 nM or less, or about 75, 50, 25, 10, 8, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1 nM or less.

In some embodiments, the EC50 at the glucagon receptor is no more than about 1 nM, 2 nM, 3 nM, 4 nM, 5 nM, 6 nM, 8 nM, 10 nM, 15 nM, 20 nM, 25 nM, 30 nM, 40 nM, 50 nM, 75 nM, or 100 nM. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptides exhibit an EC50 for GLP-1 receptor activation of about 100 nM or less, or about 75, 50, 25, 10, 8, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1 nM or less. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptides described herein exhibit an EC50 at the GLP-1 receptor that is about 0.001 nM, 0.01 nM, or 0.1 nM. In some embodiments, the EC50 at the GLP-1 receptor is no more than about 1 nM, 2 nM, 3 nM, 4 nM, 5 nM, 6 nM, 8 nM, 10 nM, 15 nM, 20 nM, 25 nM, 30 nM, 40 nM, 50 nM, 75 nM, or 100 nM. Receptor activation can be measured by in vitro assays measuring cAMP induction in HEK293 cells over-expressing the receptor, e.g. assaying HEK293 cells co-transfected with DNA encoding the receptor and a luciferase gene linked to cAMP responsive element as described in Example 16.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, glucagon peptides exhibit at least about 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.4%, 0.5%, 0.6%, 0.7%, 0.8%, 0.9%, 1%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 75%, 100%, 125%, 150%, 175% or 200% or higher activity at the GIP receptor relative to native GIP (GIP potency). In some embodiments, the glucagon peptides described herein exhibit no more than 1000%, 10,000%, 100,000%, or 1,000,000% activity at the GIP receptor relative to native GIP. In some embodiments, glucagon peptides exhibit at least about 1%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 75%, 100%, 125%, 150%, 175%, 200%, 250%, 300%, 350%, 400%, 450%, or 500% or higher activity at the glucagon receptor relative to native glucagon (glucagon potency). In some embodiments, the glucagon peptides described herein exhibit no more than 1000%, 10,000%, 100,000%, or 1,000,000% activity at the glucagon receptor relative to native glucagon. In some embodiments, glucagon peptides exhibit at least about 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.4%, 0.5%, 0.6%, 0.7%, 0.8%, 0.9%, 1%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 75%, 100%, 125%, 150%, 175% or 200% or higher activity at the GLP-1 receptor relative to native GLP-1 (GLP-1 potency). In some embodiments, the glucagon peptides described herein exhibit no more than 1000%, 10,000%, 100,000%, or 1,000,000% activity at the GLP-1 receptor relative to native GLP-1. A glucagon peptide's activity at a receptor relative to a native ligand of the receptor is calculated as the inverse ratio of EC50s for the glucagon peptide vs. the native ligand.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, one aspect of the invention provides glucagon peptides that exhibit activity at both the glucagon receptor and the GIP receptor (“glucagon/GIP co-agonists”). These glucagon peptides have lost native glucagon's selectivity for glucagon receptor compared to GIP receptor. In some embodiments, the EC50 of the glucagon peptide at the GIP receptor is less than about 50-fold, 40-fold, 30-fold or 20-fold different (higher or lower) from its EC50 at the glucagon receptor. In some embodiments, the GIP potency of the glucagon peptide is less than about 500-, 450-, 400-, 350-, 300-, 250-, 200-, 150-, 100-, 75-, 50-, 25-, 20-, 15-, 10-, or 5-fold different (higher or lower) from its glucagon potency. In some embodiments, the ratio of the EC50 of the glucagon peptide at the GIP receptor divided by the EC50 of the glucagon peptide at the glucagon receptor is less than about 100, 75, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, 15, 10, or 5. In some embodiments, the ratio of the EC50 at the GIP receptor divided by the EC50 at the glucagon receptor is about 1 or less than about 1 (e.g., about 0.01, 0.013, 0.0167, 0.02, 0.025, 0.03, 0.05, 0.067, 0.1, 0.2). In some embodiments, the ratio of the GIP potency of the glucagon peptide compared to the glucagon potency of the glucagon peptide is less than about 500, 450, 400, 350, 300, 250, 200, 150, 100, 75, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, 15, 10, or 5. In some embodiments, the ratio of the potency at the GIP receptor divided by the potency at the glucagon receptor is about 1 or less than about 1 (e.g., about 0.01, 0.013, 0.0167, 0.02, 0.025, 0.03, 0.05, 0.067, 0.1, 0.2). In some embodiments, GLP-1 activity has been significantly reduced or destroyed, e.g., by an amino acid modification at \nposition\n 7, a deletion of the amino acid(s) C-terminal to the amino acid at position 27 or 28, yielding a 27- or 28-amino acid peptide, or a combination thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention provides glucagon peptides that exhibit activity at the glucagon, GIP and GLP-1 receptors (“glucagon/GIP/GLP-1 tri-agonists”). These glucagon peptides have lost native glucagon's selectivity for the glucagon receptor compared to both the GLP-1 and GIP receptors.

In other embodiments, the unpegylated analog has less than about 10%, 5% or 1% of the activity of native GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the glucagon peptide is covalently linked to a hydrophilic moiety at any of amino acid positions 16, 17, 20, 21, 24, or 29, after position 29 at an added amino acid (e.g., position 30) within a C-terminal extension, or at the C-terminal amino acid. In exemplary embodiments, this hydrophilic moiety is covalently linked to a Lys, Cys, Orn, homocysteine, or acetyl-phenylalanine residue at any of these positions. Exemplary hydrophilic moieties include polyethylene glycol (PEG), for example, of a molecular weight of about 1,000 Daltons to about 40,000 Daltons, or about 20,000 Daltons to about 40,000 Daltons.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn such embodiments where the analogs are linked to hydrophilic moieties such as PEG, the relative EC50s at one or more receptors may be higher, e.g., about 10-fold higher, in comparison to the analog lacking the hydrophilic moiety. For example, the EC50 of a pegylated analog for GIP receptor activation is about 10 nM or less, or the analog has at least about 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.4%, or 0.5% of the activity of native GIP at the GIP receptor. In related embodiments, the EC50 of a pegylated analog for GLP-1 receptor activation is about 10 nM or less or has at least about 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.4% or 0.5% of the activity of native GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor.

In other embodiments, the analog has less than about 10%, 5% or 1% of the activity of native GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe glucagon peptide may be part of a dimer, trimer or higher order multimer comprising at least two, three, or more peptides bound via a linker, wherein at least one or both peptides is a glucagon peptide. The dimer may be a homodimer or heterodimer. In some embodiments, the linker is selected from the group consisting of a bifunctional thiol crosslinker and a bi-functional amine crosslinker. In certain embodiments, the linker is PEG, e.g., a 5 kDa PEG, 20 kDa PEG. In some embodiments, the linker is a disulfide bond. For example, each monomer of the dimer may comprise a Cys residue (e.g., a terminal or internally positioned Cys) and the sulfur atom of each Cys residue participates in the formation of the disulfide bond. In some aspects of the invention, the monomers are connected via terminal amino acids (e.g., N-terminal or C-terminal), via internal amino acids, or via a terminal amino acid of at least one monomer and an internal amino acid of at least one other monomer. In specific aspects, the monomers are not connected via an N-terminal amino acid. In some aspects, the monomers of the multimer are attached together in a “tail-to-tail” orientation in which the C-terminal amino acids of each monomer are attached together. A conjugate moiety may be covalently linked to any of the glucagon peptides described herein, including a dimer, trimer or higher order multimer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny of the modifications described herein which increase glucagon receptor activity, retain partial glucagon receptor activity, improve solubility, increase stability, or reduce degradation can be applied to glucagon peptides individually or in combination. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptides are soluble at a concentration of at least 1 mg/mL at a pH between 6 and 8, or between 6 and 9, or between 7 and 9 (e.g. pH 7), and optionally retain at least 95% of the original peptide (e.g. 5% or less of the original peptide is degraded or cleaved) after 24 hours at 25° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSterile pharmaceutical compositions comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent and kits comprising devices are provided. Methods of reducing weight gain or inducing weight loss, comprising administering to a patient in need thereof such pharmaceutical compositions in an amount effective to reduce weight gain or induce weight loss are provided. Methods of treating diabetes, comprising administering to a patient in need thereof such pharmaceutical compositions in an amount effective to lower blood glucose levels are provided.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll therapeutic methods, pharmaceutical compositions, kits and other similar embodiments described herein contemplate that the use of the terms peptides, agonists, co-agonists, tri-agonists, or analogs includes all pharmaceutically acceptable salts or esters thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe foregoing summary is not intended to define every aspect of the invention, and additional embodiments are described in other sections, such as the Detailed Description.

Each value or range of values preceded by the term “about” is also intended to encompass the embodiment of the stated absolute value or range of values.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” includes any of the standard pharmaceutical carriers, such as a phosphate buffered saline solution, water, emulsions such as an oil/water or water/oil emulsion, and various types of wetting agents. The term also encompasses any of the agents approved by a regulatory agency of the US Federal government or listed in the US Pharmacopeia for use in animals, including humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein the term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” refers to salts of compounds that retain the biological activity of the parent compound, and which are not biologically or otherwise undesirable. Many of the compounds disclosed herein are capable of forming acid and/or base salts by virtue of the presence of amino and/or carboxyl groups or groups similar thereto.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts can be prepared from inorganic and organic bases. Salts derived from inorganic bases, include by way of example only, sodium, potassium, lithium, ammonium, calcium and magnesium salts. Salts derived from organic bases include, but are not limited to, salts of primary, secondary and tertiary amines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts may be prepared from inorganic and organic acids. Salts derived from inorganic acids include hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like. Salts derived from organic acids include acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, malic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluene-sulfonic acid, salicylic acid, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “treating” includes prophylaxis of the specific disorder or condition, or alleviation of the symptoms associated with a specific disorder or condition and/or preventing or eliminating said symptoms. For example, as used herein the term “treating diabetes” will refer in general to altering glucose blood levels in the direction of normal levels and may include increasing or decreasing blood glucose levels depending on a given situation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein an “effective” amount or a “therapeutically effective amount” of a glucagon peptide refers to a nontoxic but sufficient amount of the peptide to provide the desired effect. For example one desired effect would be the prevention or treatment of hypoglycemia, as measured, for example, by an increase in blood glucose level. An alternative desired effect for the glucagon peptides of the present disclosure would include treating hyperglycemia, e.g., as measured by a change in blood glucose level closer to normal, or inducing weight loss/preventing weight gain, e.g., as measured by reduction in body weight, or preventing or reducing an increase in body weight, or normalizing body fat distribution. The amount that is “effective” will vary from subject to subject, depending on the age and general condition of the individual, mode of administration, and the like. Thus, it is not always possible to specify an exact “effective amount.” However, an appropriate “effective” amount in any individual case may be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using routine experimentation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term, “parenteral” means not through the alimentary canal but by some other route such as subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraspinal, or intravenous.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “purified” and like terms relate to the isolation of a molecule or compound in a form that is substantially free of contaminants normally associated with the molecule or compound in a native or natural environment. As used herein, the term “purified” does not require absolute purity; rather, it is intended as a relative definition. The term “purified polypeptide” is used herein to describe a polypeptide which has been separated from other compounds including, but not limited to nucleic acid molecules, lipids and carbohydrates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “isolated” requires that the referenced material be removed from its original environment (e.g., the natural environment if it is naturally occurring). For example, a naturally-occurring polynucleotide present in a living animal is not isolated, but the same polynucleotide, separated from some or all of the coexisting materials in the natural system, is isolated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “peptide” encompasses a sequence of 3 or more amino acids and typically less than 50 amino acids, wherein the amino acids are naturally occurring or non-naturally occurring amino acids. Non-naturally occurring amino acids refer to amino acids that do not naturally occur in vivo but which, nevertheless, can be incorporated into the peptide structures described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the terms “polypeptide” and “protein” are terms that are used interchangeably to refer to a polymer of amino acids, without regard to the length of the polymer. Typically, polypeptides and proteins have a polymer length that is greater than that of “peptides.”\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “glucagon peptide” as used herein includes any peptide comprising, either the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, or any analog of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, including amino acid substitutions, additions, deletions or post translational modifications (e.g., methylation, acylation, alkylation, ubiquitination, intramolecular covalent bonding such as lactam bridge formation, PEGylation, and the like) of the peptide, wherein the analog stimulates glucagon or GLP-1 or GIP receptor activity, e.g., as measured by cAMP production using the assay described in Example 16.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “glucagon agonist” refers to a complex comprising a glucagon peptide that stimulates glucagon receptor activity, e.g., as measured by cAMP production using the assay described in Example 16.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein an amino acid “modification” refers to a substitution, addition or deletion of an amino acid, and includes substitution with or addition of any of the 20 amino acids commonly found in human proteins, as well as atypical or non-naturally occurring amino acids. Throughout the application, all references to a particular amino acid position by number (e.g. position 28) refer to the amino acid at that position in native glucagon (SEQ ID NO:1) or the corresponding amino acid position in any analogs thereof. For example, a reference herein to “position 28” would mean the corresponding position 27 for a glucagon analog in which the first amino acid of SEQ ID NO: 1 has been deleted. Similarly, a reference herein to “position 28” would mean the corresponding position 29 for a glucagon analog in which one amino acid has been added before the N-terminus of SEQ ID NO: 1. Commercial sources of atypical amino acids include Sigma-Aldrich (Milwaukee, Wis.), ChemPep Inc. (Miami, Fla.), and Genzyme Pharmaceuticals (Cambridge, Mass.). Atypical amino acids may be purchased from commercial suppliers, synthesized de novo, or chemically modified or derivatized from other amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein the term “native glucagon” refers to a peptide consisting of the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, the term “native GIP” refers to a peptide consisting of the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4, and the term “native GLP-1” is a generic term that designates GLP-1(7-36) amide (consisting of the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3), GLP-1(7-37) acid (consisting of the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2) or a mixture of those two compounds. As used herein, a general reference to “glucagon” or “GIP” or “GLP-1” in the absence of any further designation is intended to mean native glucagon or native GIP or native GLP-1, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein an amino acid “substitution” refers to the replacement of one amino acid residue by a different amino acid residue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “conservative amino acid substitution” is defined herein as exchanges within one of the following five groups:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nI. Small aliphatic, nonpolar or slightly polar residues:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAla, Ser, Thr, Pro, Gly;\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nII. Polar, negatively charged residues and their amides and esters:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAsp, Asn, Glu, Gln, cysteic acid and homocysteic acid;\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nIII. Polar, positively charged residues:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nHis, Arg, Lys; Ornithine (Orn)\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nIV. Large, aliphatic, nonpolar residues:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nMet, Leu, Ile, Val, Cys, Norleucine (Nle), homocysteine\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nV. Large, aromatic residues:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nPhe, Tyr, Trp, acetyl phenylalanine\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nAs used herein the general term “polyethylene glycol chain” or “PEG chain”, refers to mixtures of condensation polymers of ethylene oxide and water, in a branched or straight chain, represented by the general formula H(OCH\n2\nCH\n2\n)\nn\nOH, wherein n is at least 9. Absent any further characterization, the term is intended to include polymers of ethylene glycol with an average total molecular weight selected from the range of 500 to 40,000 Daltons. “polyethylene glycol chain” or “PEG chain” is used in combination with a numeric suffix to indicate the approximate average molecular weight thereof. For example, PEG-5,000 refers to polyethylene glycol chain having a total molecular weight average of about 5,000.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein the term “pegylated” and like terms refers to a compound that has been modified from its native state by linking a polyethylene glycol chain to the compound. A “pegylated glucagon peptide” is a glucagon peptide that has a PEG chain covalently bound to the glucagon peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein a general reference to a peptide is intended to encompass peptides that have modified amino and carboxy termini. For example, an amino acid chain comprising an amide group in place of the terminal carboxylic acid is intended to be encompassed by an amino acid sequence designating the standard amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein a “linker” is a bond, molecule or group of molecules that binds two separate entities to one another. Linkers may provide for optimal spacing of the two edifies or may further supply a labile linkage that allows the two entities to be separated from each other. Labile linkages include photocleavable groups, acid-labile moieties, base-labile moieties and enzyme-cleavable groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein a “dimer” is a complex comprising two subunits covalently bound to one another via a linker. The term dimer, when used absent any qualifying language, encompasses both homodimers and heterodimers. A homodimer comprises two identical subunits, whereas a heterodimer comprises two subunits that differ, although the two subunits are substantially similar to one another.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein the term “charged amino acid” refers to an amino acid that comprises a side chain that is negatively charged (i.e., de-protonated) or positively charged (i.e., protonated) in aqueous solution at physiological pH. For example negatively charged amino acids include aspartic acid, glutamic acid, cysteic acid, homocysteic acid, and homoglutamic acid, whereas positively charged amino acids include arginine, lysine and histidine. Charged amino acids include the charged amino acids among the 20 amino acids commonly found in human proteins, as well as atypical or non-naturally occurring amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein the term “acidic amino acid” refers to an amino acid that comprises a second acidic moiety, including for example, a carboxylic acid or sulfonic acid group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “selectivity” of a molecule for a first receptor relative to a second receptor refers to the following ratio: EC50 of the molecule at the second receptor divided by the EC50 of the molecule at the first receptor. For example, a molecule that has an EC50 of 1 nM at a first receptor and an EC50 of 100 nM at a second receptor has 100-fold selectivity for the first receptor relative to the second receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “glucagon potency” of a molecule refers to the ratio of the EC50 of the molecule at glucagon receptor divided by the EC50 of native glucagon at glucagon receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “GIP potency” of a molecule refers to the ratio of the EC50 of the molecule at GIP receptor divided by the EC50 of native GIP at GIP receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “GLP-1 potency” of a molecule refers to the ratio of the EC50 of the molecule at GLP-1 receptor divided by the EC50 of native GLP-1 at GLP-1 receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “alkyl” refers to a linear or branched hydrocarbon containing the indicated number of carbon atoms. Exemplary alkyls include methyl, ethyl, and linear propyl groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “heteroalkyl” refers to a linear or branched hydrocarbon containing the indicated number of carbon atoms and at least one heteroatom in the backbone of the structure. Suitable heteroatoms for purposes herein include but are not limited to N, S, and O.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “cycloalkyl” refers to a cyclic hydrocarbon group containing the indicated number of carbon atoms, e.g., cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclohexyl, and cyclopentyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “heterocyclic” refers to a cyclic hydrocarbon group containing the indicated number of carbon atoms and one to three heteroatoms independently selected from the group consisting of oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNonlimiting examples of heterocycloalkyl groups include piperidine, tetrahydrofuran, tetrahydropyran, dihydrofuran, morpholine, thiophene, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “aryl” refers to a monocyclic or polycyclic aromatic group, preferably a monocyclic or bicyclic aromatic group, e.g., phenyl or naphthyl, containing the indicated number of carbon atoms. Unless otherwise indicated, an aryl group can be unsubstituted or substituted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “heteroaryl” refers to a monocyclic or polycyclic aromatic group containing the indicated number of carbon atoms and at least one heteroatom selected from the group consisting of oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur. Unless otherwise indicated, an aryl group can be unsubstituted or substituted.\n\n\n \nEMBODIMENTS\n\n\n \n \n \nThe modifications disclosed herein permit the manipulation of glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 1) to create glucagon peptides that exhibit increased GIP activity, glucagon activity, and/or GLP-1 activity. Other modifications disclosed herein prolong the half-life, increase solubility, or increase stability of the resulting peptide. Yet other modifications disclosed herein have no effect on activity, or can be made without destroying the desired activity or activities. Any of the combinations that serve the same purpose (e.g. increasing GIP activity) can be applied individually or in combination. Any of the single or sets of combinations that confer enhanced properties can be applied individually or in combination, e.g. increased GIP and/or GLP-1 activity can be combined with increased half-life.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn exemplary embodiments, the glucagon peptide may comprise a total of 1, up to 2, up to 3, up to 4, up to 5, up to 6, up to 7, up to 8, up to 9, or up to 10 amino acid modifications relative to the native glucagon sequence. In some embodiments, such glucagon peptides retain at least 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 or 28 of the naturally occurring amino acids at the corresponding positions in native glucagon (e.g. have 1-7, 1-5 or 1-3 modifications relative to naturally occurring glucagon). In related embodiments, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or more of the amino acid modifications may be non-conservative substitutions, additions or deletions. In some embodiments, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or more of the amino acid modifications may be conservative substitutions. In some \n \n \n \n \nembodiments\n \n \n \n \n 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 non-conservative substitutions are carried out at any of \n \n \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n \n \n 2, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 27, 28 or 29 and up to 5 further conservative substitutions are carried out at any of these positions. In some \n \n \nembodiments\n \n \n 1, 2, or 3 amino acid modifications are carried out within amino acids at positions 1-16, and 1, 2 or 3 amino acid modifications are carried out within amino acids at positions 17-26.\n\n\n \n \nModifications that Affect GIP Activity\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnhanced activity at the GIP receptor is provided by an amino acid modification at \nposition\n 1. For example, His at \nposition\n 1 is substituted with a large, aromatic amino acid, optionally Tyr, Phe, Trp, amino-Phe, nitro-Phe, chloro-Phe, sulfo-Phe, 4-pyridyl-Ala, methyl-Tyr, or 3-amino Tyr. Unexpectedly, the combination of Tyr at \nposition\n 1 with stabilization of the alpha helix within the region corresponding to amino acids 12-29 provided a glucagon peptide that activates GIP receptor as well as GLP-1 receptor and glucagon receptor. The alpha helix structure can be stabilized by, e.g., formation of a covalent or non-covalent intramolecular bridge, or substitution and/or insertion of amino acids around positions 12-29 with an alpha helix-stabilizing amino acid (e.g., an α,α-disubstituted amino acid).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnhanced activity at the GIP receptor is also provided by amino acid modifications at positions 27 and/or 28, and optionally at position 29. For example, the Met at position 27 is substituted with a large aliphatic amino acid, optionally Leu, the Asn at position 28 is substituted with a small aliphatic amino acid, optionally Ala, and the Thr at position 29 is substituted with a small aliphatic amino acid, optionally Gly. Substitution with LAG at positions 27-29 provides increased GIP activity relative to the native MNT sequence at those positions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnhanced activity at the GIP receptor is also provided by an amino acid modification at \nposition\n 12. For example, \nposition\n 12 is substituted with a large, aliphatic, nonpolar amino acid, optionally Ile.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnhanced activity at the GIP receptor is also provided by an amino acid modification at positions 17 and/or 18. For example, position 17 is substituted with a polar residue, optionally Gln, and position 18 is substituted with a small aliphatic amino acid, optionally Ala. A substitution with QA at positions 17 and 18 provides increased GIP activity relative to the native RR sequence at those positions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny of the modifications described above which increase GIP receptor activity can be applied individually or in combination. Combinations of the modifications that increase GIP receptor activity generally provide higher GIP activity than any of such modifications taken alone.\n\n\n \n \nModifications that Affect Glucagon Activity\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, analogs of glucagon are provided that have enhanced potency and optionally improved solubility and stability. In one embodiment, enhanced glucagon potency is provided by an amino acid modification at position 16 of native glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 1). By way of nonlimiting example, such enhanced potency can be provided by substituting the naturally occurring serine at position 16 with glutamic acid or with another negatively charged amino acid having a side chain with a length of 4 atoms, or alternatively with any one of glutamine, homoglutamic acid, or homocysteic acid, or a charged amino acid having a side chain containing at least one heteroatom, (e.g. N, O, S, P) and with a side chain length of about 4 (or 3-5) atoms. In some embodiments the glucagon peptide retains its original selectivity for the glucagon receptor relative to the GLP-1 receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlucagon receptor activity can be reduced by an amino acid modification at \nposition\n 3, e.g. substitution of the naturally occurring glutamine at \nposition\n 3, with an acidic, basic, or a hydrophobic amino acid. For example substitution at \nposition\n 3 with glutamic acid, ornithine, or norleucine substantially reduces or destroys glucagon receptor activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMaintained or enhanced activity at the glucagon receptor may be achieved by modifying the Gln at \nposition\n 3 with a glutamine analog. For example, a glucagon peptide comprising a glutamine analog at \nposition\n 3 may exhibit about 5%, about 10%, about 20%, about 50%, or about 85% or greater the activity of native glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 1) at the glucagon receptor. In some embodiments a glucagon peptide comprising a glutamine analog at \nposition\n 3 may exhibit about 20%, about 50%, about 75%, about 100%, about 200% or about 500% or greater the activity of a corresponding glucagon peptide having the same amino acid sequence as the peptide comprising the glutamine analog, except for the modified amino acid at position 3 (e.g. SEQ ID NO: 250 or SEQ ID NO: 251) at the glucagon receptor. In some embodiments, a glucagon peptide comprising a glutamine analog at \nposition\n 3 exhibits enhanced activity at the glucagon receptor, but the enhanced activity is no more than 1000%, 10,000%, 100,000%, or 1,000,000% of the activity of native glucagon or of a corresponding glucagon peptide having the same amino acid sequence as the peptide comprising the glutamine analog, except for the modified amino acid at \nposition\n 3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the glutamine analog is a naturally occurring or a non-naturally occurring amino acid comprising a side chain of Structure I, II or III:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwherein R\n1 \nis C\n0-3 \nalkyl or C\n0-3 \nheteroalkyl; R\n2 \nis NHR\n4 \nor C\n1-3 \nalkyl; R\n3 \nis C\n1-3 \nalkyl; R\n4 \nis H or C\n1-3 \nalkyl; X is NH, O, or S; and Y is NHR\n4\n, SR\n3\n, or OR\n3\n.

In exemplary embodiments, an amino acid comprising a side chain of Structure I is provided where, R\n1 \nis CH\n2\n—S, X is NH, and R\n2 \nis CH\n3 \n(acetamidomethyl-cysteine, C(Acm)); R\n1 \nis CH\n2\n, X is NH, and R\n2 \nis CH\n3 \n(acetyldiaminobutanoic acid, Dab(Ac)); R\n1 \nis C\n0 \nalkyl, X is NH, R\n2 \nis NHR\n4\n, and R\n4 \nis H (carbamoyldiaminopropanoic acid, Dap(urea)); or R\n1 \nis CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n, X is NH, and R\n2 \nis CH\n3 \n(acetylornithine, Orn(Ac)). In exemplary embodiments, an amino acid comprising a side chain of Structure II is provided where, R\n1 \nis CH\n2\n, Y is NHR\n4\n, and R\n4 \nis CH\n3 \n(methylglutamine, Q(Me)); In exemplary embodiments, an amino acid comprising a side chain of Structure III is provided where, R\n1 \nis CH\n2 \nand R\n4 \nis H (methionine-sulfoxide, M(O)); In specific embodiments, the amino acid at \nposition\n 3 is substituted with Dab(Ac). For example, glucagon agonists can comprise the amino acid sequence of any of SEQ ID NOs: 243-248, 250, 251, and 253-256.\n\n\n \n \nModifications that Affect GLP-1 Activity\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnhanced activity at the GLP-1 receptor is provided by replacing the carboxylic acid of the C-terminal amino acid with a charge-neutral group, such as an amide or ester.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnhanced activity at the GLP-1 receptor is also provided by stabilizing the alpha-helix structure in the C-terminal portion of glucagon (around amino acids 12-29), e.g., through formation of an intramolecular bridge between the side chains of two amino acids, or substitution and/or insertion of amino acids around positions 12-29 with an alpha helix-stabilizing amino acid (e.g., an α,α-disubstituted amino acid). The side chains of these amino acids can be linked to one another through hydrogen-bonding or ionic interactions, such as the formation of salt bridges, or by covalent bonds. In some embodiments, the bridge is formed between amino acids that are separated by three intervening amino acids, i.e. an amino acid at position “i” and an amino acid at position “i+4”, wherein i is any integer from 12 to 25 (e.g., 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 or 25). In exemplary embodiments, the side chains of the amino acid pairs 12 and 16, 13 and 17, 16 and 20, 17 and 21, 20 and 24 or 24 and 28 (amino acid pairs in which i=12, 16, 20, or 24) are linked to one another and thus stabilize the glucagon alpha helix.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the bridge is formed between amino acids that are separated by two intervening amino acids, i.e. an amino acid at position “j” and an amino acid at position “j+3”, wherein j is any integer from 12 to 26 (e.g., 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 or 26). In exemplary embodiments, j is 17. In further embodiments, the bridge is formed between amino acids that are separated by six intervening amino acids, i.e. an amino acid at position “k” and an amino acid at position “k+7”, wherein k is any integer from 12 to 22 (e.g., 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 or 22). In one embodiment, k is 17.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the bridge or linker is about 8 (or about 7-9) atoms in length, particularly when the bridge is between positions i and i+4. In some embodiments, the bridge or linker is about 6 (or about 5-7) atoms in length, particularly when the bridge is between positions j and j+3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, intramolecular bridges are formed by (a) substituting the naturally occurring serine at position 16 with glutamic acid or with another negatively charged amino acid having a side chain with a length of 4 atoms, or alternatively with any one of glutamine, homoglutamic acid, or homocysteic acid, or a charged amino acid having a side chain containing at least one heteroatom, (e.g. N, O, S, P) and with a side chain length of about 4 (or 3-5) atoms, and (b) substituting the naturally occurring glutamine at \nposition\n 20 with another hydrophilic amino acid having a side chain that is either charged or has an ability to hydrogen-bond, and is at least about 5 (or about 4-6) atoms in length, for example, lysine, citrulline, arginine, or ornithine. The side chains of such amino acids at \npositions\n 16 and 20 can form a salt bridge or can be covalently linked.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the two amino acids are bound to one another to form a lactam ring. The size of the lactam ring can vary depending on the length of the amino acid side chains, and in one embodiment the lactam is formed by linking the side chains of a lysine amino acid to a glutamic acid side chain. The order of the amide bond in the lactam ring can be reversed (e.g., a lactam ring can be formed between the side chains of a Lys12 and a Glu 16 or alternatively between a \nGlu\n 12 and a Lys16)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, stabilization of the alpha helix structure in the C-terminal portion of the glucagon peptide is achieved through the formation of an intramolecular bridge other than a lactam bridge. For example, suitable covalent bonding methods include any one or more of olefin metathesis, lanthionine-based cyclization, disulfide bridge or modified sulfur-containing bridge formation, the use of α,ω-diaminoalkane tethers, the formation of metal-atom bridges, and other means of peptide cyclization are used to stabilize the alpha helix.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPotency at the GLP-1 receptor can be further enhanced by an alanine substitution for the native arginine at position 18.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny of the modifications described above which increase GLP-1 receptor activity can be applied individually or in combination. Combinations of the modifications that increase GLP-1 receptor activity generally provide higher GLP-1 activity than any of such modifications taken alone. For example, the invention provides glucagon peptides that comprise modifications at position 16, at \nposition\n 20, and at the C-terminal carboxylic acid group, optionally with a covalent bond between the amino acids at \npositions\n 16 and 20; glucagon peptides that comprise modifications at position 16 and at the C-terminal carboxylic acid group; glucagon peptides that comprise modifications at \npositions\n 16 and 20, optionally with a covalent bond between the amino acids at \npositions\n 16 and 20; and glucagon peptides that comprise modifications at \nposition\n 20 and at the C-terminal carboxylic acid group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGLP-1 activity may be reduced by comprising (i) a C-terminal alpha carboxylate group, (ii) a substitution of the Thr at \nposition\n 7 with an amino acid lacking a hydroxyl group, e.g., Abu or Ile, (iii) a deletion of the amino acid(s) C-terminal to the amino acid at position 27 or 28 (e.g., deletion of the amino acid at position 28, deletion of the amino acid at positions 28 and 29) to yield a peptide 27 or 28 amino acids in length, or (iv) a combination thereof.\n\n\n \n \nModifications that Affect Activity at Each of the Glucagon, GLP-1, and GIP Receptors\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnhanced activity at each of the glucagon receptor, GLP-1 receptor, and GIP receptor is provided by (i) an amino acid substitution of Ser at position 16 with an amino acid of Formula IV:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein n is 1 to 16, or 1 to 10, or 1 to 7, or 1 to 6, or 2 to 6, or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5, each of R\n1 \nand R\n2 \nis independently selected from the group consisting of H, C\n1\n-C\n18 \nalkyl, (C\n1\n-C\n18 \nalkyl)OH, (C\n1\n-C\n18 \nalkyl)NH\n2\n, (C\n1\n-C\n18 \nalkyl)SH, (C\n0\n-C\n4 \nalkyl)(C\n3\n-C\n6\n)cycloalkyl, (C\n0\n-C\n4 \nalkyl)(C\n2\n-C\n5 \nheterocyclic), (C\n0\n-C\n4 \nalkyl)(C\n6\n-C\n10 \naryl)R\n7\n, and (C\n1\n-C\n4 \nalkyl)(C\n3\n-C\n9 \nheteroaryl), wherein R\n7 \nis H or OH, and the side chain of the amino acid of Formula IV comprises a free amino group, and (ii) an amino acid substitution of the Gln at \nposition\n 20 with an alpha, alpha-disubstituted amino acid, e.g., AIB. In some embodiments, the amino acid at position 16 is Orn, Dab, Lys, or homoLys, and the amino acid at \nposition\n 20 is AIB. In specific embodiments, the amino acid at position 16 is Lys and the amino acid at \nposition\n 20 is AIB.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe activity at each of the glucagon receptor, GLP-1 receptor, and glucagon receptor of the analog comprising an amino acid of Formula IV at position 16 and an alpha, alpha di-substituted amino acid at \nposition\n 20 can be further enhanced by extending the length of the peptide, e.g. by fusion to a C-terminal extension peptide, e.g. of about 1-21, about 9 to 21, about 6-18, about 9-12, or about 10 or 11 amino acids in length. In some embodiments, the C-terminus is extended by fusion to GPSSGAPPPS (SEQ ID NO: 95) or XGPSSGAPPPS (SEQ ID NO: 96), wherein X is Gly or a small, aliphatic or non-polar or slightly polar amino acid. In alternative embodiments, the C-terminus is extended by fusion to GPSSGAPPPS (SEQ ID NO: 95) and 1-11 amino acids are fused to the C-terminus of GPSSGAPPPS (SEQ ID NO: 95). For example, the C-terminal extension of the analog can comprise GPSSGAPPPS (SEQ ID NO: 95) followed by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 11 additional amino acids at the C-terminus of SEQ ID NO: 95. The 1-11 additional amino acids can be, for example, a small aliphatic amino acid, such as Ala. In this regard, the C-terminal extension can, for example, comprise the amino acid sequence of GPSSGAPPPSA\nm\n, wherein m is 1 to 11.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnhancement of activity at each of the glucagon, GLP-1, and GIP receptors of a GIP-active, glucagon-based analog, including an analog comprising an amino acid of Formula IV at position 16 and an alpha, alpha disubstituted amino acid at \nposition\n 20, can furthermore be achieved upon acylation or alkylation of an amino acid located within a C-terminal extension or at the C-terminal amino acid (e.g., an amino acid which is added to the C-terminus of the C-terminal extension). The acylation or alkylation can be of an amino acid located, for example, at any of \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, and 50 of the C-terminally extended analog. In some embodiments, the amino acid which is acylated or alkylated is located at \nposition\n 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, or 43 of the C-terminally extended analog. In some embodiments, the acylated or alkylated amino acid is an amino acid of Formula I, II, or III, e.g., Lys, which is attached to an acyl or alkyl group, e.g. C10-C22. In certain embodiments, the Lys is located C-terminal to a C-terminal extension consisting of SEQ ID NO: 95, such that the Lys, Dab, Orn, or homoLys is located at \nposition\n 40 of the analog. Optionally, C-terminally extended peptides are also pegylated, e.g. at any of the positions described herein (e.g., position 24).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnhancement of the activity at each of the glucagon, GLP-1, and GIP receptors of a GIP-active, glucagon-based analog can moreover be achieved by acylation or alkylation of an amino acid via a spacer (e.g., an amino acid, dipeptide, tripeptide, hydrophilic bifunctional spacer, hydrophobic bifunctional spacer). In some embodiments, the GIP-active, glucagon-based analog comprises an acyl or alkyl group via a spacer, which spacer is attached to the side chain of the amino acid at \nposition\n 10 of the analog. In other embodiments, the analog comprises a C-terminal extension of 1 to 21 amino acids (e.g., an extension comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 95 or 96) C-terminal to the amino acid at position 29 and the spacer, which is covalently attached to an acyl or alkyl group, is attached to an amino acid of the extension at a position corresponding to one of positions 37-43 relative to SEQ ID NO: 1. In specific embodiments, the spacer is attached to the amino acid at \nposition\n 40 relative to SEQ ID NO: 1. In certain embodiments, the spacer is 3 to 10 atoms in length. In specific aspects, the total length of the spacer and acyl or alkyl group is about 14 to about 28 atoms in length. For example, the spacer can be an amino acid, including, but not limited to, any of those described herein. Also, for example, the spacer may be a dipeptide or tripeptide comprising amino acids described herein. The spacer in specific aspects is one of the following dipeptides: Ala-Ala, βAla-βAla, or γGlu-γGlu. Additional suitable spacers for purposes of increasing activity at one or more of the glucagon, GLP-1, and GIP receptors are further described herein.\n\n\n \n \nModifications that Improve DPP-IV Resistance\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModifications at \nposition\n 1 and/or 2 can increase the peptide's resistance to dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) cleavage. For example, the amino acid at \nposition\n 2 may be substituted with D-serine, D-alanine, valine, glycine, N-methyl serine, N-methyl alanine, or amino isobutyric acid. In some embodiments, the amino acid at \nposition\n 1 may be substituted with D-histidine, desaminohistidine, hydroxyl-histidine, acetyl-histidine, homo-histidine, N-methyl histidine, alpha-methyl histidine, imidazole acetic acid, or alpha, alpha-dimethyl imidiazole acetic acid (DMIA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt was observed that modifications at position 2 (e.g. AIB at position 2) and in some cases modifications at position 1 (e.g., DMIA at position 1) may reduce glucagon activity, sometimes significantly; surprisingly, this reduction in glucagon activity can be restored by stabilizing the alpha-helix structure in the C-terminal portion of glucagon (around amino acids 12-29), e.g., through formation of a covalent bond between the side chains of two amino acids, as described herein. In some embodiments, the covalent bond is between amino acids at positions “i” and “i+4”, or positions “j” and “j+3”, e.g., between \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n 12 and 16, 16 and 20, 20 and 24, 24 and 28, or 17 and 20. In exemplary embodiments, this covalent bond is a lactam bridge between a glutamic acid at position 16 and a lysine at \nposition\n 20. In some embodiments, this covalent bond is an intramolecular bridge other than a lactam bridge. For example, suitable covalent bonding methods (i.e., means of forming a covalent intramolecular bridge) include any one or more of olefin metathesis, lanthionine-based cyclization, disulfide bridge or modified sulfur-containing bridge formation, the use of α,ω-diaminoalkane tethers, the formation of metal-atom bridges, and other means of peptide cyclization.\n\n\n \n \nModifications that Reduce Degradation\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet further exemplary embodiments, any of the glucagon peptides can be further modified to improve stability by modifying the amino acid at \nposition\n 15 and/or 16 of SEQ ID NO: 1 to reduce degradation of the peptide over time, especially in acidic or alkaline buffers. Such modifications reduce cleavage of the Asp15-Ser16 peptide bond. In exemplary embodiments, the amino acid modification at \nposition\n 15 is a deletion or substitution of Asp with glutamic acid, homoglutamic acid, cysteic acid or homocysteic acid. In other exemplary embodiments, the amino acid modification at position 16 is a deletion or substitution of Ser with Thr or AIB. In other exemplary embodiments, Ser at position 16 is substituted with glutamic acid or with another negatively charged amino acid having a side chain with a length of 4 atoms, or alternatively with any one of glutamine, homoglutamic acid, or homocysteic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments the methionine residue present at position 27 of the native peptide is modified, e.g. by deletion or substitution. Such modifications may prevent oxidative degradation of the peptide. In some embodiments, the Met at position 27 is substituted with leucine, isoleucine or norleucine. In some specific embodiments, Met at position 27 is substituted with leucine or norleucine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the Gln at \nposition\n 20 and/or 24 is modified, e.g. by deletion or substitution. Such modifications can reduce degradation that occurs through deamidation of Gln. In some embodiments, the Gln at \nposition\n 20 and/or 24 is substituted with Ala or AIB. In some embodiments the Gln at \nposition\n 20 and/or 24 is substituted with Lys, Arg, Orn, or Citrulline.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the Asp at position 21 is modified, e.g. by deletion or substitution. Such modifications can reduce degradation that occurs through dehydration of Asp to form a cyclic succinimide intermediate followed by isomerization to iso-aspartate. In some embodiments, position 21 is substituted with Glu, homoglutamic acid or homocysteic acid. In some specific embodiments, position 21 is substituted with Glu.\n\n\n \nOther Modifications\n\n\n \n \n \nSome positions of the native glucagon peptide can be modified while retaining at least some of the activities of the parent peptide. Accordingly, applicants anticipate that one or more of the amino acids located at positions at \n \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n \n 2, 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 27, 28 or 29 can be substituted with an amino acid different from that present in the native glucagon peptide, and still retain activity at the glucagon receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, position 18 is substituted with an amino acid selected from the group consisting of Ala, Ser, or Thr. In some embodiments the amino acid at \nposition\n 20 is substituted with Ser, Thr, Lys, Arg, Orn, Citrulline or AIB. In some embodiments, position 21 is substituted with Glu, homoglutamic acid or homocysteic acid. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptide comprises 1 to 10 amino acid modifications selected from \npositions\n 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 23, 24, 27, 28 and 29. In exemplary embodiments, the modifications are one or more amino acid substitutions selected from the group consisting of Gln17, Ala18, Glu21, Ile23, Ala24, Val27 and Gly29. In some embodiments, 1 to 2 amino acids selected from positions 17-26 differ from the parent peptide. In other embodiments, 1 to 2 amino acids selected from positions 17-22 differ from the parent peptide. In yet other embodiments, the modifications are Gln17, Ala18, Glu21, Ile23 and Ala24.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, one or more amino acids is added to the carboxy terminus of the glucagon peptide. The amino acid is typically selected from one of the 20 common amino acids, and in some embodiments the amino acid has an amide group in place of the carboxylic acid of the native amino acid. In exemplary embodiments the added amino acid is selected from the group consisting of glutamic acid and aspartic acid and glycine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther modifications that do not destroy activity include W10 or R20.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the glucagon peptides disclosed herein are modified by truncation of the C-terminus by one or two amino acid residues yet retain similar activity and potency at the glucagon, GLP-1 and/or GIP receptors. In this regard, the amino acid at position 29 and/or 28 can be deleted.\n\n\n \nStabilization of the Alpha Helix Structure\n\n\n \n \n \nStabilization of the alpha-helix structure in the C-terminal portion of the glucagon peptide (around amino acids 12-29) provides enhanced GLP-1 and/or GIP activity and restores glucagon activity which has been reduced by amino acid modifications at \npositions\n 1 and/or 2. The alpha helix structure can be stabilized by, e.g., formation of a covalent or non-covalent intramolecular bridge, or substitution and/or insertion of amino acids around positions 12-29 with an alpha helix-stabilizing amino acid (e.g., an α,α-disubstituted amino acid).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, an intramolecular bridge is formed between two amino acid side chains to stabilize the three dimensional structure of the carboxy terminal portion (e.g., amino acids 12-29) of the glucagon peptide. The two amino acid side chains can be linked to one another through non-covalent bonds, e.g., hydrogen-bonding, ionic interactions, such as the formation of salt bridges, or by covalent bonds. When the two amino acid side chains are linked to one another through one or more covalent bonds, the peptide may be considered herein as comprising a covalent intramolecular bridge. When the two amino acid side chains are linked to one another through non-covalent bonds, e.g., hydrogen bonds, ionic interactions, the peptide may be considered herein as comprising a non-covalent intramolecular bridge.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the intramolecular bridge is formed between two amino acids that are 3 amino acids apart, e.g., amino acids at positions i and i+4, wherein i is any integer between 12 and 25 (e.g., 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25). More particularly, the side chains of the amino acid pairs 12 and 16, 16 and 20, 20 and 24 or 24 and 28 (amino acid pairs in which i=12, 16, 20, or 24) are linked to one another and thus stabilize the glucagon alpha helix. Alternatively, i can be 17.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some specific embodiments, wherein the amino acids at positions i and i+4 are joined by an intramolecular bridge, the size of the linker is about 8 atoms, or about 7-9 atoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the intramolecular bridge is formed between two amino acids that are two amino acids apart, e.g., amino acids at positions j and j+3, wherein j is any integer between 12 and 26 (e.g., 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, and 26). In some specific embodiments, j is 17.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some specific embodiments, wherein amino acids at positions j and j+3 are joined by an intramolecular bridge, the size of the linker is about 6 atoms, or about 5 to 7 atoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet other embodiments, the intramolecular bridge is formed between two amino acids that are 6 amino acids apart, e.g., amino acids at positions k and k+7, wherein k is any integer between 12 and 22 (e.g., 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 22). In some specific embodiments, k is 12, 13, or 17. In an exemplary embodiment, k is 17.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of amino acid pairings that are capable of covalently bonding to form a six-atom linking bridge include Orn and Asp, Glu and an amino acid of Formula I, wherein n is 2, and homoglutamic acid and an amino acid of Formula I, wherein n is 1, wherein Formula I is:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of amino acid pairing that are capable of covalently bonding to form a seven-atom linking bridge include Orn-Glu (lactam ring); Lys-Asp (lactam); or Homoser-Homoglu (lactone). Examples of amino acid pairings that may form an eight-atom linker include Lys-Glu (lactam); Homolys-Asp (lactam); Orn-Homoglu (lactam); 4-aminoPhe-Asp (lactam); or Tyr-Asp (lactone). Examples of amino acid pairings that may form a nine-atom linker include Homolys-Glu (lactam); Lys-Homoglu (lactam); 4-aminoPhe-Glu (lactam); or Tyr-Glu (lactone). Any of the side chains on these amino acids may additionally be substituted with additional chemical groups, so long as the three-dimensional structure of the alpha-helix is not disrupted. One of ordinary skill in the art can envision alternative pairings or alternative amino acid analogs, including chemically modified derivatives, that would create a stabilizing structure of similar size and desired effect. For example, a homocysteine-homocysteine disulfide bridge is 6 atoms in length and may be further modified to provide the desired effect. Even without covalent linkage, the amino acid pairings described above or similar pairings that one of ordinary skill in the art can envision may also provide added stability to the alpha-helix through non-covalent bonds, for example, through formation of salt bridges or hydrogen-bonding interactions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe size of a lactam ring can vary depending on the length of the amino acid side chains, and in one embodiment the lactam is formed by linking the side chains of a lysine amino acid to a glutamic acid side chain. Further exemplary embodiments include the following pairings, optionally with a lactam bridge: Glu at \nposition\n 12 with Lys at position 16; native Lys at \nposition\n 12 with Glu at position 16; Glu at position 16 with Lys at \nposition\n 20; Lys at position 16 with Glu at \nposition\n 20; Glu at \nposition\n 20 with Lys at position 24; Lys at \nposition\n 20 with Glu at position 24; Glu at position 24 with Lys at position 28; Lys at position 24 with Glu at position 28. Alternatively, the order of the amide bond in the lactam ring can be reversed (e.g., a lactam ring can be formed between the side chains of a \nLys\n 12 and a Glu 16 or alternatively between a \nGlu\n 12 and a Lys 16).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntramolecular bridges other than a lactam bridge can be used to stabilize the alpha helix of the glucagon analog peptides. In one embodiment, the intramolecular bridge is a hydrophobic bridge. In this instance, the intramolecular bridge optionally is between the side chains of two amino acids that are part of the hydrophobic face of the alpha helix of the glucagon analog peptide. For example, one of the amino acids joined by the hydrophobic bridge can be the amino acid at \nposition\n 10, 14, and 18.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one specific aspect, olefin metathesis is used to cross-link one or two turns of the alpha helix of the glucagon peptide using an all-hydrocarbon cross-linking system. The glucagon peptide in this instance can comprise α-methylated amino acids bearing olefinic side chains of varying length and configured with either R or S stereochemistry at the i and i+4 or i+7 positions. For example, the olefinic side can comprise (CH\n2\n)\nn\n, wherein n is any integer between 1 to 6. In one embodiment, n is 3 for a cross-link length of 8 atoms. Suitable methods of forming such intramolecular bridges are described in the art. See, for example, Schafmeister et al., \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n122: 5891-5892 (2000) and Walensky et al., \nScience \n305: 1466-1470 (2004). Alternatively, the glucagon peptide can comprise O-allyl Ser residues located on adjacent helical turns, which are bridged together via ruthenium-catalyzed ring closing metathesis. Such procedures of cross-linking are described in, for example, Blackwell et al., \nAngew, Chem., Int. Ed. \n37: 3281-3284 (1998).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another specific aspect, use of the unnatural thio-dialanine amino acid, lanthionine, which has been widely adopted as a peptidomimetic of cystine, is used to cross-link one turn of the alpha helix. Suitable methods of lanthionine-based cyclization are known in the art. See, for instance, Matteucci et al., Tetrahedron Letters 45: 1399-1401 (2004); Mayer et al., \nJ. Peptide Res. \n51: 432-436 (1998); Polinsky et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n35: 4185-4194 (1992); Osapay et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n40: 2241-2251 (1997); Fukase et al., \nBull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. \n65: 2227-2240 (1992); Harpp et al., \nJ. Org. Chem. \n36: 73-80 (1971); Goodman and Shao, \nPure Appl. Chem. \n68: 1303-1308 (1996); and Osapay and Goodman, \nJ. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. \n1599-1600 (1993).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, α, ω-diaminoalkane tethers, e.g., 1,4-diaminopropane and 1,5-diaminopentane) between two Glu residues at positions i and i+7 are used to stabilize the alpha helix of the glucagon peptide. Such tethers lead to the formation of a bridge 9-atoms or more in length, depending on the length of the diaminoalkane tether. Suitable methods of producing peptides cross-linked with such tethers are described in the art. See, for example, Phelan et al., \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n119: 455-460 (1997).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment of the invention, a disulfide bridge is used to cross-link one or two turns of the alpha helix of the glucagon peptide. Alternatively, a modified disulfide bridge in which one or both sulfur atoms are replaced by a methylene group resulting in an isosteric macrocyclization is used to stabilize the alpha helix of the glucagon peptide. Suitable methods of modifying peptides with disulfide bridges or sulfur-based cyclization are described in, for example, Jackson et al., \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n113: 9391-9392 (1991) and Rudinger and Jost, \nExperientia \n20: 570-571 (1964).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment, the alpha helix of the glucagon peptide is stabilized via the binding of metal atom by two His residues or a His and Cys pair positioned at i and i+4. The metal atom can be, for example, Ru(III), Cu(II), Zn(II), or Cd(II). Such methods of metal binding-based alpha helix stabilization are known in the art. See, for example, Andrews and Tabor, \nTetrahedron \n55: 11711-11743 (1999); Ghadiri et al., \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n112: 1630-1632 (1990); and Ghadiri et al., \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n119: 9063-9064 (1997).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe alpha helix of the glucagon peptide can alternatively be stabilized through other means of peptide cyclizing, which means are reviewed in Davies, \nJ. Peptide. Sci. \n9: 471-501 (2003). The alpha helix can be stabilized via the formation of an amide bridge, thioether bridge, thioester bridge, urea bridge, carbamate bridge, sulfonamide bridge, and the like. For example, a thioester bridge can be formed between the C-terminus and the side chain of a Cys residue. Alternatively, a thioester can be formed via side chains of amino acids having a thiol (Cys) and a carboxylic acid (e.g., Asp, Glu). In another method, a cross-linking agent, such as a dicarboxylic acid, e.g. suberic acid (octanedioic acid), etc. can introduce a link between two functional groups of an amino acid side chain, such as a free amino, hydroxyl, thiol group, and combinations thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with one embodiment, the alpha helix of the glucagon peptide is stabilized through the incorporation of hydrophobic amino acids at positions i and i+4. For instance, i can be Tyr and i+4 can be either Val or Leu; i can be Phe and i+4 can be Cys or Met; I can be Cys and i+4 can be Met; or i can be Phe and i+4 can be Ile. It should be understood that, for purposes herein, the above amino acid pairings can be reversed, such that the indicated amino acid at position i could alternatively be located at i+4, while the i+4 amino acid can be located at the i position.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with other embodiments of the invention, the alpha helix is stabilized through incorporation (either by amino acid substitution or insertion) of one or more alpha helix-stabilizing amino acids at the C-terminal portion of the glucagon peptide (around amino acids 12-29). In a specific embodiment, the alpha helix-stabilizing amino acid is an α,α-disubstituted amino acid, including, but not limited to any of amino iso-butyric acid (AIB), an amino acid disubstituted with the same or a different group selected from methyl, ethyl, propyl, and n-butyl, or with a cyclooctane or cycloheptane (e.g., 1-aminocyclooctane-1-carboxylic acid). In some embodiments, one, two, three, four or more of \npositions\n 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24 or 29 of the glucagon peptide is substituted with an α,α-disubstituted amino acid. In a specific embodiment, one, two, three or all of \npositions\n 16, 20, 21, and 24 are substituted with an α,α-disubstituted amino acid, e.g., AIB. For example, the glucagon peptide can comprise a substitution of position 16 with AIB in the absence of an intramolecular bridge, e.g., a non-covalent intramolecular bridge (e.g., a salt bridge) or a covalent intramolecular bridge (e.g., a lactam). Such peptides lacking an intramolecular bridge are advantageously easy to prepare.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with some embodiments, the glucagon peptide lacking an intramolecular bridge comprises one or more substitutions within amino acid positions 12-29 with an α,α-disubstituted amino acid and an acyl or alkyl group covalently attached to the side chain of an amino acid of the glucagon peptide, e.g., the amino acid at \n \npositions\n \n 10 or 40 of the glucagon peptide. In specific embodiments, the acyl or alkyl group is non-native to a naturally occurring amino acid. In certain aspects, the acyl or alkyl group is non-native to the amino acid at \nposition\n 10. Such acylated or alkylated glucagon peptides lacking an intramolecular bridge exhibit enhanced activity at the GLP-1 and glucagon receptors as compared to the non-acylated counterpart peptides. Further enhancement in activity at the GLP-1 and glucagon receptors can be achieved by the acylated glucagon peptides lacking an intramolecular bridge by incorporating a spacer between the acyl or alkyl group and the side chain of the amino acid at \n \npositions\n \n 10 or 40 of the peptide. Acylation and alkylation, with or without incorporating spacers, are further described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn specific embodiments, the acylated or alkylated glucagon peptide, or analog thereof, further comprises a modification which selectively reduces activity at the GLP-1 receptor. For example, the acylated or alkylated glucagon peptide, or analog thereof, comprises one or a combination of: a C-terminal alpha carboxylate, a deletion of the amino acids C-terminal to the amino acid at position 27 or 28 (e.g., deletion of the amino acid at position 29, deletion of the amino acids at positions 28 and 29), a substitution of the Thr at \nposition\n 7 with a large, aliphatic, non-polar amino acid, e.g., Ile. In some embodiments, position 16 or \nposition\n 20 is substituted with an α,α-disubstituted amino acid, e.g., AIB. In some embodiments, \nposition\n 20 is substituted with an α,α-disubstituted amino acid, e.g., AIB. In certain embodiments, \nposition\n 20 is substituted with an α,α-disubstituted amino acid, e.g., AIB, and position 16 is substituted with an amino acid of Formula IV\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein n is 1 to 16, or 1 to 10, or 1 to 7, or 1 to 6, or 2 to 6, or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5, each of R\n1 \nand R\n2 \nis independently selected from the group consisting of H, C\n1\n-C\n18 \nalkyl, (C\n1\n-C\n18 \nalkyl)OH, (C\n1\n-C\n18 \nalkyl)NH\n2\n, (C\n1\n-C\n18 \nalkyl)SH, (C\n0\n-C\n4 \nalkyl)(C\n3\n-C\n6\n)cycloalkyl, (C\n0\n-C\n4 \nalkyl)(C\n2\n-C\n5 \nheterocyclic), (C\n0\n-C\n4 \nalkyl)(C\n6\n-C\n10 \naryl)R\n7\n, and (C\n1\n-C\n4 \nalkyl)(C\n3\n-C\n9 \nheteroaryl), wherein R\n7 \nis H or OH, and the side chain of the amino acid of Formula IV comprises a free amino group. In particular embodiments, the amino acid of Formula IV is 2,3 diamino propionic acid (DAP), 2,4-diaminobutyric acid (DAB), Orn, Lys or homoLys. The combination of an amino acid of Formula IV at position 16 and an alpha, alpha disubstituted amino acid advantageously provides improved activity at each of the glucagon, GLP-1, and GIP receptors.\n\n\n \nLinkage of Hydrophilic Moieties\n\n\n \n \n \nIn another embodiment the solubility of the glucagon peptides disclosed herein are enhanced by the covalent linkage of a hydrophilic moiety to the peptide. Hydrophilic moieties can be attached to the glucagon peptides under any suitable conditions used to react a protein with an activated polymer molecule. Any means known in the art can be used, including via acylation, reductive alkylation, Michael addition, thiol alkylation or other chemoselective conjugation/ligation methods through a reactive group on the PEG moiety (e.g., an aldehyde, amino, ester, thiol, α-haloacetyl, maleimido or hydrazino group) to a reactive group on the target compound (e.g., an aldehyde, amino, ester, thiol, α-haloacetyl, maleimido or hydrazino group). Activating groups which can be used to link the water soluble polymer to one or more proteins include without limitation sulfone, maleimide, sulfhydryl, thiol, triflate, tresylate, azidirine, oxirane, 5-pyridyl, and alpha-halogenated acyl group (e.g., alpha-iodo acetic acid, alpha-bromoacetic acid, alpha-chloroacetic acid). If attached to the peptide by reductive alkylation, the polymer selected should have a single reactive aldehyde so that the degree of polymerization is controlled. See, for example, Kinstler et al., \nAdv. Drug. Delivery Rev. \n54: 477-485 (2002); Roberts et al., \nAdv. Drug Delivery Rev. \n54: 459-476 (2002); and Zalipsky et al., \nAdv. Drug Delivery Rev. \n16: 157-182 (1995).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a specific aspect of the invention, an amino acid residue on the glucagon peptide having a thiol is modified with a hydrophilic moiety such as PEG. In some embodiments, the thiol is modified with maleimide-activated PEG in a Michael addition reaction to result in a PEGylated peptide comprising the thioether linkage shown below:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the thiol is modified with a haloacetyl-activated PEG in a nucleophilic substitution reaction to result in a PEGylated peptide comprising the thioether linkage shown below:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable hydrophilic moieties include polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylene glycol, polyoxyethylated polyols (e.g., POG), polyoxyethylated sorbitol, polyoxyethylated glucose, polyoxyethylated glycerol (POG), polyoxyalkylenes, polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde, copolymers of ethylene glycol/propylene glycol, monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol, mono-(C\n1\n-C\n10\n) alkoxy- or aryloxy-polyethylene glycol, carboxymethylcellulose, polyacetals, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyvinyl pyrrolidone, poly-1,3-dioxolane, poly-1,3,6-trioxane, ethylene/maleic anhydride copolymer, poly (.beta.-amino acids) (either homopolymers or random copolymers), poly(n-vinyl pyrrolidone)polyethylene glycol, propropylene glycol homopolymers (PPG) and other polyakylene oxides, polypropylene oxide/ethylene oxide copolymers, colonic acids or other polysaccharide polymers, Ficoll or dextran and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe hydrophilic moiety, e.g., polyethylene glycol chain in accordance with some embodiments has a molecular weight selected from the range of about 500 to about 40,000 Daltons. In one embodiment the hydrophilic moiety, e.g. PEG, has a molecular weight selected from the range of about 500 to about 5,000 Daltons, or about 1,000 to about 5,000 Daltons. In another embodiment the hydrophilic moiety, e.g., PEG, has a molecular weight of about 10,000 to about 20,000 Daltons. In yet other exemplary embodiments the hydrophilic moiety, e.g., PEG, has a molecular weight of about 20,000 to about 40,000 Daltons.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment dextrans are used as the hydrophilic moiety. Dextrans are polysaccharide polymers of glucose subunits, predominantly linked by α1-6 linkages. Dextran is available in many molecular weight ranges, e.g., about 1 kD to about 100 kD, or from about 5, 10, 15 or 20 kD to about 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 or 90 kD.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLinear or branched polymers are contemplated. Resulting preparations of conjugates may be essentially monodisperse or polydisperse, and may have about 0.5, 0.7, 1, 1.2, 1.5 or 2 polymer moieties per peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the hydrophilic moiety is a polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain, optionally linked to the peptide at one or more of positions 16, 17, 21, 24, 29, a position within a C-terminal extension, e.g., 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, or at the C-terminal amino acid (e.g., 40). In some embodiments, the native amino acid at that position is substituted with an amino acid having a side chain suitable for crosslinking with hydrophilic moieties, to facilitate linkage of the hydrophilic moiety to the peptide. In exemplary embodiments, the native amino acid at that position is substituted with Lys, Cys, Orn, homocysteine, or acetyl-phenylalanine residue. In other embodiments, an amino acid modified to comprise a hydrophilic group is added to the peptide at the C-terminus.\n\n\n \n \nOther Modifications that Enhance Solubility\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment the solubility of any of the glucagon peptides can be improved by amino acid substitutions and/or additions that introduce a charged amino acid into the C-terminal portion of the peptide, preferably at a position C-terminal to position 27 of SEQ ID NO: 1. Optionally, one, two or three charged amino acids may be introduced within the C-terminal portion, preferably C-terminal to position 27. In some embodiments the native amino acid(s) at positions 28 and/or 29 are substituted with one or two charged amino acids, and/or in a further embodiment one to three charged amino acids are also added to the C-terminus of the peptide. In exemplary embodiments, one, two or all of the charged amino acids are negatively charged. In some embodiments, the negatively charged (acidic amino acid) is aspartic acid or glutamic acid. Additional modifications, e.g. conservative substitutions, may be made to the glucagon peptide that still allow it to retain GIP activity (and optionally GLP-1 activity and/or glucagon activity).\n\n\n \nConjugates and Fusions\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present disclosure also encompasses other conjugates in which glucagon peptides of the invention are linked, optionally via covalent bonding and optionally via a linker, to a conjugate moiety. Linkage can be accomplished by covalent chemical bonds, physical forces such electrostatic, hydrogen, ionic, van der Waals, or hydrophobic or hydrophilic interactions. A variety of non-covalent coupling systems may be used, including biotin-avidin, ligand/receptor, enzyme/substrate, nucleic acid/nucleic acid binding protein, lipid/lipid binding protein, cellular adhesion molecule partners; or any binding partners or fragments thereof which have affinity for each other.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptide can be linked to conjugate moieties via direct covalent linkage by reacting targeted amino acid residues of the peptide with an organic derivatizing agent that is capable of reacting with selected side chains or the N- or C-terminal residues of these targeted amino acids. Reactive groups on the peptide or conjugate include, e.g., an aldehyde, amino, ester, thiol, α-haloacetyl, maleimido or hydrazino group. Derivatizing agents include, for example, maleimidobenzoyl sulfosuccinimide ester (conjugation through cysteine residues), N-hydroxysuccinimide (through lysine residues), glutaraldehyde, succinic anhydride or other agents known in the art. Alternatively, the conjugate moieties can be linked to the peptide indirectly through intermediate carriers, such as polysaccharide or polypeptide carriers. Examples of polysaccharide carriers include aminodextran. Examples of suitable polypeptide carriers include polylysine, polyglutamic acid, polyaspartic acid, co-polymers thereof, and mixed polymers of these amino acids and others, e.g., serines, to confer desirable solubility properties on the resultant loaded carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCysteinyl residues are most commonly are reacted with α-haloacetates (and corresponding amines), such as chloroacetic acid, chloroacetamide to give carboxymethyl or carboxyamidomethyl derivatives. Cysteinyl residues also are derivatized by reaction with bromotrifluoroacetone, alpha-bromo-β-(5-imidozoyl)propionic acid, chloroacetyl phosphate, N-alkylmaleimides, 3-nitro-2-pyridyl disulfide, methyl 2-pyridyl disulfide, p-chloromercuribenzoate, 2-chloromercuri-4-nitrophenol, or chloro-7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHistidyl residues are derivatized by reaction with diethylpyrocarbonate at pH 5.5-7.0 because this agent is relatively specific for the histidyl side chain. Para-bromophenacyl bromide also is useful; the reaction is preferably performed in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate at pH 6.0.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLysinyl and amino-terminal residues are reacted with succinic or other carboxylic acid anhydrides. Derivatization with these agents has the effect of reversing the charge of the lysinyl residues. Other suitable reagents for derivatizing alpha-amino-containing residues include imidoesters such as methyl picolinimidate, pyridoxal phosphate, pyridoxal, chloroborohydride, trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid, O-methylisourea, 2,4-pentanedione, and transaminase-catalyzed reaction with glyoxylate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nArginyl residues are modified by reaction with one or several conventional reagents, among them phenylglyoxal, 2,3-butanedione, 1,2-cyclohexanedione, and ninhydrin. Derivatization of arginine residues requires that the reaction be performed in alkaline conditions because of the high pK\na \nof the guanidine functional group. Furthermore, these reagents may react with the groups of lysine as well as the arginine epsilon-amino group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe specific modification of tyrosyl residues may be made, with particular interest in introducing spectral labels into tyrosyl residues by reaction with aromatic diazonium compounds or tetranitromethane. Most commonly, N-acetylimidizole and tetranitromethane are used to form O-acetyl tyrosyl species and 3-nitro derivatives, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCarboxyl side groups (aspartyl or glutamyl) are selectively modified by reaction with carbodiimides (R—N.dbd.C.dbd.N—R′), where R and R\n1 \nare different alkyl groups, such as 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinyl-4-ethyl)carbodiimide or 1-ethyl-3-(4-azonia-4,4-dimethylpentyl)carbodiimide. Furthermore, aspartyl and glutamyl residues are converted to asparaginyl and glutaminyl residues by reaction with ammonium ions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther modifications include hydroxylation of proline and lysine, phosphorylation of hydroxyl groups of seryl or threonyl residues, methylation of the alpha-amino groups of lysine, arginine, and histidine side chains (T. E. Creighton, Proteins: Structure and Molecular Properties, W.H. Freeman & Co., San Francisco, pp. 79-86 (1983)), deamidation of asparagines or glutamine, acetylation of the N-terminal amine, and/or amidation or esterification of the C-terminal carboxylic acid group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother type of covalent modification involves chemically or enzymatically coupling glycosides to the peptide. Sugar(s) may be attached to (a) arginine and histidine, (b) free carboxyl groups, (c) free sulfhydryl groups such as those of cysteine, (d) free hydroxyl groups such as those of serine, threonine, or hydroxyproline, (e) aromatic residues such as those of tyrosine, or tryptophan, or (f) the amide group of glutamine. These methods are described in WO87/05330 published 11 Sep. 1987, and in Aplin and Wriston, CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem., pp. 259-306 (1981).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary conjugate moieties that can be linked to any of the glucagon peptides described herein include but are not limited to a heterologous peptide or polypeptide (including for example, a plasma protein), a targeting agent, an immunoglobulin or portion thereof (e.g. variable region, CDR, or Fc region), a diagnostic label such as a radioisotope, fluorophore or enzymatic label, a polymer including water soluble polymers, or other therapeutic or diagnostic agents. In one embodiment a conjugate is provided comprising a glucagon peptide of the present invention and a plasma protein, wherein the plasma protein is selected form the group consisting of albumin, transferin, fibrinogen and globulins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the linker comprises a chain of atoms from 1 to about 60, or 1 to 30 atoms or longer, 2 to 5 atoms, 2 to 10 atoms, 5 to 10 atoms, or 10 to 20 atoms long. In some embodiments, the chain atoms are all carbon atoms. In some embodiments, the chain atoms in the backbone of the linker are selected from the group consisting of C, O, N, and S. Chain atoms and linkers may be selected according to their expected solubility (hydrophilicity) so as to provide a more soluble conjugate. In some embodiments, the linker provides a functional group that is subject to cleavage by an enzyme or other catalyst or hydrolytic conditions found in the target tissue or organ or cell. In some embodiments, the length of the linker is long enough to reduce the potential for steric hindrance. If the linker is a covalent bond or a peptidyl bond and the conjugate is a polypeptide, the entire conjugate can be a fusion protein. Such peptidyl linkers may be any length. Exemplary linkers are from about 1 to 50 amino acids in length, 5 to 50, 3 to 5, 5 to 10, 5 to 15, or 10 to 30 amino acids in length. Such fusion proteins may alternatively be produced by recombinant genetic engineering methods known to one of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs noted above, in some embodiments, the glucagon peptides are conjugated, e.g., fused to an immunoglobulin or portion thereof (e.g. variable region, CDR, or Fc region). Known types of immunoglobulins (Ig) include IgG, IgA, IgE, IgD or IgM. The Fc region is a C-terminal region of an Ig heavy chain, which is responsible for binding to Fc receptors that carry out activities such as recycling (which results in prolonged half-life), antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), and complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, according to some definitions the human IgG heavy chain Fc region stretches from Cys226 to the C-terminus of the heavy chain. The “hinge region” generally extends from Glu216 to Pro230 of human IgG1 (hinge regions of other IgG isotypes may be aligned with the IgG1 sequence by aligning the cysteines involved in cysteine bonding). The Fc region of an IgG includes two constant domains, CH2 and CH3. The CH2 domain of a human IgG Fc region usually extends from amino acids 231 to amino acid 341. The CH3 domain of a human IgG Fc region usually extends from amino acids 342 to 447. References made to amino acid numbering of immunoglobulins or immunoglobulin fragments, or regions, are all based on Kabat et al. 1991, Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, U.S. Department of Public Health, Bethesda, Md. In a related embodiments, the Fc region may comprise one or more native or modified constant regions from an immunoglobulin heavy chain, other than CHI, for example, the CH2 and CH3 regions of IgG and IgA, or the CH3 and CH4 regions of IgE.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable conjugate moieties include portions of immunoglobulin sequence that include the FcRn binding site. FcRn, a salvage receptor, is responsible for recycling immunoglobulins and returning them to circulation in blood. The region of the Fc portion of IgG that binds to the FcRn receptor has been described based on X-ray crystallography (Burmeister et al. 1994, Nature 372:379). The major contact area of the Fc with the FcRn is near the junction of the CH2 and CH3 domains. Fc-FcRn contacts are all within a single Ig heavy chain. The major contact sites include amino acid residues 248, 250-257, 272, 285, 288, 290-291, 308-311, and 314 of the CH2 domain and amino acid residues 385-387, 428, and 433-436 of the CH3 domain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome conjugate moieties may or may not include FcγR binding site(s). FcγR are responsible for ADCC and CDC. Examples of positions within the Fc region that make a direct contact with FcγR are amino acids 234-239 (lower hinge region), amino acids 265-269 (B/C loop), amino acids 297-299 (C′/E loop), and amino acids 327-332 (F/G) loop (Sondermann et al., Nature 406: 267-273, 2000). The lower hinge region of IgE has also been implicated in the FcRI binding (Henry, et al., Biochemistry 36, 15568-15578, 1997). Residues involved in IgA receptor binding are described in Lewis et al., (J. Immunol. 175:6694-701, 2005). Amino acid residues involved in IgE receptor binding are described in Sayers et al. (J Biol. Chem. 279(34):35320-5, 2004).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmino acid modifications may be made to the Fc region of an immunoglobulin. Such variant Fc regions comprise at least one amino acid modification in the CH3 domain of the Fc region (residues 342-447) and/or at least one amino acid modification in the CH2 domain of the Fc region (residues 231-341). Mutations believed to impart an increased affinity for FcRn include T256A, T307A, E380A, and N434A (Shields et al. 2001, J. Biol. Chem. 276:6591). Other mutations may reduce binding of the Fc region to FcγRI, FcγRIIA, FcγRIIB, and/or FcγRIIIA without significantly reducing affinity for FcRn. For example, substitution of the Asn at position 297 of the Fc region with Ala or another amino acid removes a highly conserved N-glycosylation site and may result in reduced immunogenicity with concomitant prolonged half-life of the Fc region, as well as reduced binding to FcγRs (Routledge et al. 1995, Transplantation 60:847; Friend et al. 1999, Transplantation 68:1632; Shields et al. 1995, J. Biol. Chem. 276:6591). Amino acid modifications at positions 233-236 of IgG1 have been made that reduce binding to FcγRs (Ward and Ghetie 1995, Therapeutic Immunology 2:77 and Armour et al. 1999, Eur. J. Immunol. 29:2613). Some exemplary amino acid substitutions are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,355,008 and 7,381,408, each incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present disclosure also encompasses glucagon fusion peptides or proteins wherein a second peptide or polypeptide has been fused to a terminus, e.g., the carboxy terminus of the glucagon peptide. In some embodiments the second peptide added to the carboxy terminus of the glucagon peptide is SEQ ID NO: 95 (GPSSGAPPPS), SEQ ID NO: 97 (KRNRNNIA) or SEQ ID NO: 98 (KRNR) linked to amino acid 29 of the glucagon peptide. In other embodiments, the second peptide is XGPSSGAPPPS (SEQ ID NO: 96), wherein X is selected from one of the 20 common amino acids, e.g., glutamic acid, aspartic acid or glycine. In one embodiment X represents an amino acid, for example Cys, that further comprises a hydrophilic moiety covalently linked to the side chain of that amino acid. Such C-terminal extensions improve solubility and also can improve GIP or GLP-1 activity. In some embodiments wherein the glucagon peptide further comprises a carboxy terminal extension, the carboxy terminal amino acid of the extension ends in an amide group or an ester group rather than a carboxylic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, e.g., in glucagon peptides which comprise the C-terminal extension, the threonine at position 29 of the native glucagon peptide is replaced with a glycine. For example, a glucagon peptide having a glycine substitution for threonine at position 29 and comprising the C-terminal extension of GPSSGAPPPS (SEQ ID NO: 95) is four times as potent at the GLP-1 receptor as native glucagon modified to comprise the same C-terminal extension. This T29G substitution can be used in conjunction with other modifications disclosed herein to enhance the affinity of the glucagon peptides for the GLP-1 receptor. For example, the T29G substitution can be combined with the S16E and N20K amino acid substitutions, optionally with a lactam bridge between \namino acids\n 16 and 20, and optionally with addition of a PEG chain as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments an amino acid is added to the C-terminus, and the additional amino acid is selected from the group consisting of glutamic acid, aspartic acid and glycine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present disclosure also encompasses multimers of the modified glucagon peptides disclosed herein. Two or more of the modified glucagon peptides can be linked together using standard linking agents and procedures known to those skilled in the art. For example, dimers can be formed between two modified glucagon peptides through the use of bifunctional thiol crosslinkers and bi-functional amine crosslinkers, particularly for the glucagon peptides that have been substituted with cysteine, lysine ornithine, homocysteine or acetyl phenylalanine residues.\n\n\n \nAcylation and Alkylation\n\n\n \n \n \nIn accordance with some embodiments, the glucagon peptides disclosed herein are modified to comprise an acyl group or an alkyl group, e.g., an acyl or alkyl group which is non-native to a naturally-occurring amino acid. Acylation or alkylation can increase the half-life of the glucagon peptides in circulation. Acylation or alkylation can advantageously delay the onset of action and/or extend the duration of action at the glucagon and/or GLP-1 receptors and/or improve resistance to proteases such as DPP-IV and/or improve solubility. Activity at the glucagon and/or GLP-1 and/or GIP receptors of the glucagon peptide may be maintained after acylation. In some embodiments, the potency of the acylated glucagon peptides is comparable to the unacylated versions of the glucagon peptides. In alternative embodiments, the potency of the acylated glucagon peptides is increased as compared to that of the unacylated version of the glucagon peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the invention provides a glucagon peptide modified to comprise an acyl group or alkyl group covalently linked to the amino acid at \nposition\n 10 of the glucagon peptide. The glucagon peptide may further comprise a spacer between the amino acid at \nposition\n 10 of the glucagon peptide and the acyl group or alkyl group. In some embodiments, the acyl group is a fatty acid or bile acid, or salt thereof, e.g. a C4 to C30 fatty acid, a C8 to C24 fatty acid, cholic acid, a C\n4 \nto C\n30 \nalkyl, a C\n8 \nto C\n24 \nalkyl, or an alkyl comprising a steroid moiety of a bile acid. The spacer is any moiety with suitable reactive groups for attaching acyl or alkyl groups. In exemplary embodiments, the spacer comprises an amino acid, a dipeptide, a tripeptide, a hydrophilic bifunctional, or a hydrophobic bifunctional spacer. In some embodiments, the spacer is selected from the group consisting of: Trp, Glu, Asp, Cys and a spacer comprising NH\n2\n(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)\nn\n(CH\n2\n)\nm\nCOOH, wherein m is any integer from 1 to 6 and n is any integer from 2 to 12. Such acylated or alkylated glucagon peptides may also further comprise a hydrophilic moiety, optionally a polyethylene glycol. Any of the foregoing glucagon peptides may comprise two acyl groups or two alkyl groups, or a combination thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAcylation can be carried out at any position within the glucagon peptide, including any of positions 1-29, a position within a C-terminal extension, or the N- or C-terminal amino acid, provided that GIP activity (and optionally GLP-1 and/or glucagon activity) is retained, if not enhanced. Acylation may occur, for example, at any amino acid which is added to the glucagon sequence (SEQ ID NO: 1), e.g., at the N- or C-terminus. Nonlimiting examples include \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1, 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, or 50 of the glucagon peptide. The acyl group can be covalently linked directly to an amino acid of the glucagon peptide, or indirectly to an amino acid of the glucagon peptide via a spacer, wherein the spacer is positioned between the amino acid of the glucagon peptide and the acyl group. Glucagon peptides may be acylated at the same amino acid position where a hydrophilic moiety is linked, or at a different amino acid position. Nonlimiting examples include acylation at \nposition\n 10 or \nposition\n 40 and pegylation at one or more positions in the C-terminal portion of the glucagon peptide, e.g., position 24, 28 or 29, within a C-terminal extension, or at the C-terminus (e.g., through adding a C-terminal Cys).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the glucagon peptide is modified to comprise an extension of about 1 to about 21 amino acids C-terminal to the glucagon peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 or an analog thereof and at least one of the amino acids of the extension is acylated or alkylated. For example, the modified glucagon peptide may comprise an extension of about 1 to about 21 amino acids C-terminal to the amino acid at position 29 of the glucagon peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 or analog thereof. Alternatively, if the glucagon peptide or analog thereof is truncated by one or two amino acids, the extension of about 1 to about 21 amino acids may be C-terminal to the amino acid at position 27 or 28 of the glucagon peptide or analog thereof. Accordingly, the acylated or alkylated amino acid within the C-terminal extension can be, for example, any of the amino acids at \n \n \n \nposition\n \n \n \n 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, or 50 of the C-terminally extended glucagon peptide. The C-terminal extension in some embodiments comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 95 or 96. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptide comprises a C-terminal extension comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 95 and 1 to 11 additional amino acids at the C-terminus of SEQ ID NO: 95, which additional amino acid(s) is/are acylated or alkylated, as described herein. In specific embodiments, the acylated or alkylated amino acid is a Dab, Om, Lys, or homoLys residue and is located at \nposition\n 40 of the C-terminally extended glucagon peptide or analog thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with one embodiment, the glucagon peptide is modified to comprise an acyl group which is attached to the glucagon peptide via an ester, thioester, or amide linkage for purposes of prolonging half-life in circulation and/or delaying the onset of and/or extending the duration of action and/or improving resistance to proteases such as DPP-IV.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a specific aspect of the invention, the glucagon peptide is modified to comprise an acyl group by direct acylation of an amine, hydroxyl, or thiol of a side chain of an amino acid of the glucagon peptide. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptide is directly acylated through the side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol of an amino acid. In some embodiments, acylation is at \n \n \nposition\n \n \n 10, 20, 24, 29, or 40. In this regard, the acylated glucagon peptide can comprise the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, or a modified amino acid sequence thereof comprising one or more of the amino acid modifications described herein, with at least one of the amino acids at \n \n \npositions\n \n \n 10, 20, 24, 29, and 40 modified to any amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol. In some specific embodiments of the invention, the direct acylation of the glucagon peptide occurs through the side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol of the amino acid at \n \nposition\n \n 10 or 40.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the amino acid comprising a side chain amine is an amino acid of Formula I:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nIn some exemplary embodiments, the amino acid of Formula I, is the amino acid wherein n is 4 (Lys) or n is 3 (Om).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the amino acid comprising a side chain hydroxyl is an amino acid of Formula II:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nIn some exemplary embodiments, the amino acid of Formula II is the amino acid wherein n is 1 (Ser).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet other embodiments, the amino acid comprising a side chain thiol is an amino acid of Formula III:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nIn some exemplary embodiments, the amino acid of Formula II is the amino acid wherein n is 1 (Cys).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet other embodiments, the amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol is a disubstituted amino acid comprising the same structure of Formula I, Formula II, or Formula III, except that the hydrogen bonded to the alpha carbon of the amino acid of Formula I, Formula II, or Formula III is replaced with a second side chain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the invention, the acylated glucagon peptide comprises a spacer between the peptide and the acyl group. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptide is covalently bound to the spacer, which is covalently bound to the acyl group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino acid to which the spacer is attached can be any amino acid (e.g., a singly or doubly α-substituted amino acid) comprising a moiety which permits linkage to the spacer. For example, an amino acid comprising a side chain NH\n2\n, —OH, or —COOH (e.g., Lys, Orn, Ser, Asp, or Glu) is suitable. In this respect, the acylated glucagon peptide can comprise the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, or a modified amino acid sequence thereof comprising one or more of the amino acid modifications described herein, with at least one of the amino acids at \n \n \npositions\n \n \n 10, 20, 24, 29, and 40 modified to any amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or carboxylate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the spacer is an amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol, or a dipeptide or tripeptide comprising an amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen acylation occurs through an amine group of a spacer the acylation can occur through the alpha amine of the amino acid or a side chain amine. In the instance in which the alpha amine is acylated, the spacer amino acid can be any amino acid. For example, the spacer amino acid can be a hydrophobic amino acid, e.g., Gly, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, Trp, Met, Phe, Tyr, 6-amino hexanoic acid, 5-aminovaleric acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, and 8-aminooctanoic acid. Alternatively, the spacer amino acid can be an acidic residue, e.g., Asp and Glu.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the instance in which the side chain amine of the spacer amino acid is acylated, the spacer amino acid is an amino acid comprising a side chain amine, e.g., an amino acid of Formula I (e.g., Lys or Orn). In this instance, it is possible for both the alpha amine and the side chain amine of the spacer amino acid to be acylated, such that the glucagon peptide is diacylated. Embodiments of the invention include such diacylated molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen acylation occurs through a hydroxyl group of a spacer, the amino acid or one of the amino acids of the dipeptide or tripeptide can be an amino acid of Formula II. In a specific exemplary embodiment, the amino acid is Ser.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen acylation occurs through a thiol group of a spacer, the amino acid or one of the amino acids of the dipeptide or tripeptide can be an amino acid of Formula III. In a specific exemplary embodiment, the amino acid is Cys.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the spacer is a hydrophilic bifunctional spacer. In certain embodiments, the hydrophilic bifunctional spacer comprises two or more reactive groups, e.g., an amine, a hydroxyl, a thiol, and a carboxyl group or any combinations thereof. In certain embodiments, the hydrophilic bifunctional spacer comprises a hydroxyl group and a carboxylate. In other embodiments, the hydrophilic bifunctional spacer comprises an amine group and a carboxylate. In other embodiments, the hydrophilic bifunctional spacer comprises a thiol group and a carboxylate. In specific embodiments, the spacer comprises an amino poly(alkyloxy)carboxylate. In this regard, the spacer can comprise, for example, NH\n2\n(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)\nn\n(CH\n2\n)\nm\nCOOH, wherein m is any integer from 1 to 6 and n is any integer from 2 to 12, such as, e.g., 8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoic acid, which is commercially available from Peptides International, Inc. (Louisville, Ky.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the spacer is a hydrophobic bifunctional spacer. Hydrophobic bifunctional spacers are known in the art.

Hermanson (Academic Press, San Diego, Calif., 1996), which is incorporated by reference in its entirety In certain embodiments, the hydrophobic bifunctional spacer comprises two or more reactive groups, e.g., an amine, a hydroxyl, a thiol, and a carboxyl group or any combinations thereof. In certain embodiments, the hydrophobic bifunctional spacer comprises a hydroxyl group and a carboxylate.

In other embodiments, the hydropholic bifunctional spacer comprises a thiol group and a carboxylate. Suitable hydrophobic bifunctional spacers comprising a carboxylate, and a hydroxyl group or a thiol group are known in the art and include, for example, 8-hydroxyoctanoic acid and 8-mercaptooctanoic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the bifunctional spacer is not a dicarboxylic acid comprising an unbranched, methylene of 1-7 carbon atoms between the carboxylate groups. In some embodiments, the bifunctional spacer is a dicarboxylic acid comprising an unbranched, methylene of 1-7 carbon atoms between the carboxylate groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe spacer (e.g., amino acid, dipeptide, tripeptide, hydrophilic bifunctional, or hydrophobic bifunctional spacer) in specific embodiments is 3 to 10 atoms (e.g., 6 to 10 atoms, (e.g., 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 atoms) in length. In more specific embodiments, the spacer is about 3 to 10 atoms (e.g., 6 to 10 atoms) in length and the acyl group is a C12 to C18 fatty acyl group, e.g., C14 fatty acyl group, C16 fatty acyl group, such that the total length of the spacer and acyl group is 14 to 28 atoms, e.g., about 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, or 28 atoms. In some embodiments, the length of the spacer and acyl group is 17 to 28 (e.g., 19 to 26, 19 to 21) atoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with certain foregoing embodiments, the bifunctional spacer can be a synthetic or naturally occurring amino acid (including, but not limited to, any of those described herein) comprising an amino acid backbone that is 3 to 10 atoms in length (e.g., 6-amino hexanoic acid, 5-aminovaleric acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, and 8-aminooctanoic acid).

The glucagon peptide, for example, can be a peptide comprising one or more alpha, alpha-disubstituted amino acids, e.g., AIB, for stabilizing the alpha helix of the peptide. As shown herein, such peptides comprising an acylated spacer covalently attached to the side chain of the amino acid at \nposition\n 40 exhibit enhanced potency at the GIP, GLP-1, and glucagon receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable methods of peptide acylation via amines, hydroxyls, and thiols are known in the art. See, for example, Example 19 (for methods of acylating through an amine), Miller, Biochem Biophys Res Commun 218: 377-382 (1996); Shimohigashi and Stammer, \nInt J Pept Protein Res \n19: 54-62 (1982); and Previero et al., \nBiochim Biophys Acta \n263: 7-13 (1972) (for methods of acylating through a hydroxyl); and San and Silvius, \nPept Res \n66: 169-180 (2005) (for methods of acylating through a thiol); \nBioconjugate Chem\n. “Chemical Modifications of Proteins: History and Applications” pages 1, 2-12 (1990); Hashimoto et al., \nPharmacuetical Res\n. “Synthesis of Palmitoyl Derivatives of Insulin and their Biological Activity” Vol. 6, No: 2 pp. 171-176 (1989).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe acyl group of the acylated glucagon peptide can be of any size, e.g., any length carbon chain, and can be linear or branched.

In specific aspects, the long chain alkane comprises an amine, hydroxyl, or thiol group (e.g. octadecylamine, tetradecanol, and hexadecanethiol) which reacts with a carboxyl group, or activated form thereof, of the glucagon peptide. The carboxyl group, or activated form thereof, of the glucagon peptide can be part of a side chain of an amino acid (e.g., glutamic acid, aspartic acid) of the glucagon peptide or can be part of the peptide backbone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the glucagon peptide is modified to comprise an acyl group by acylation of the long chain alkane by a spacer which is attached to the glucagon peptide.

For example, activated forms of a carboxyl groups may include, but are not limited to, acyl chlorides, anhydrides, and esters. In some embodiments, the activated carboxyl group is an ester with a N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (NHS) leaving group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWith regard to these aspects of the invention, in which a long chain alkane is acylated by the glucagon peptide or the spacer, the long chain alkane may be of any size and can comprise any length of carbon chain. The long chain alkane can be linear or branched. In certain aspects, the long chain alkane is a C\n4 \nto C\n30 \nalkane.

In some embodiments, the long chain alkane comprises a C8 to C20 alkane, e.g., a C14 alkane, C16 alkane, or a C18 alkane.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, in some embodiments, an amine, hydroxyl, or thiol group of the glucagon peptide is acylated with a cholesterol acid. In specific embodiments, the glucagon peptide is linked to the cholesterol acid through a modified Cys spacer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe acylated glucagon peptides described herein can be further modified to comprise a hydrophilic moiety. In some specific embodiments the hydrophilic moiety can comprise a polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain. The incorporation of a hydrophilic moiety can be accomplished through any suitable means, such as any of the methods described herein. In this regard, the acylated glucagon peptide can comprise SEQ ID NO: 1, including any of the modifications described herein, in which at least one of the amino acids at \n \n \nposition\n \n \n 10, 20, 24, 29, and 40 comprise an acyl group and at least one of the amino acids at \nposition\n 16, 17, 21, 24, 29, or 40, a position within a C-terminal extension, or the C-terminal amino acid are modified to a Cys, Lys, Orn, homo-Cys, or Ac-Phe, and the side chain of the amino acid is covalently bonded to a hydrophilic moiety (e.g., PEG). In some embodiments, the acyl group is attached to position 10 or 40, optionally via a spacer comprising Cys, Lys, Orn, homo-Cys, or Ac-Phe, and the hydrophilic moiety is incorporated at a Cys residue at position 24.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the acylated glucagon peptide can comprise a spacer, wherein the spacer is both acylated and modified to comprise the hydrophilic moiety. Nonlimiting examples of suitable spacers include a spacer comprising one or more amino acids selected from the group consisting of Cys, Ac-Cys, Lys, Orn, homo-Cys, and Ac-Phe.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a specific aspect of the invention, the acylated glucagon peptide comprises the amino acid sequence of any of SEQ ID NOs:101-106, 113-115, 117-119, 123-125, 128-130, 132-134, 136-138, 141-145, 148, 151, 152, 154, 156, 158, 160, 162, 163, 165, 166, 231, 234-239, 257, and 258.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with some embodiments, the glucagon peptide is modified to comprise an alkyl group, e.g., an alkyl group which is not naturally-occurring on an amino acid (e.g., an alkyl group which is non-native to a naturally-occurring amino acid). Without being held to any particular theory, it is believed that alkylation of glucagon peptides will achieve similar, if not the same, effects as acylation of the glucagon peptides, e.g., a prolonged half-life in circulation, a delayed onset of action, an extended duration of action, an improved resistance to proteases, such as DPP-IV, and increased potency at the GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlkylation can be carried out at any positions within the glucagon peptide, including any of positions 1-29, a position within a C-terminal extension, or the N- or C-terminal amino acid, provided that the GIP activity (and optionally GIP and/or glucagon activity) is retained, if not enhanced. Alkylation may occur, for example, at any amino acid which is added to the glucagon sequence (SEQ ID NO: 1), e.g., at the N- or C-terminus. Nonlimiting examples include \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1, 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, or 50. The alkyl group can be covalently linked directly to an amino acid of the glucagon peptide, or indirectly to an amino acid of the glucagon peptide via a spacer, wherein the spacer is positioned between the amino acid of the glucagon peptide and the alkyl group. Glucagon peptides may be alkylated at the same amino acid position where a hydrophilic moiety is linked, or at a different amino acid position. Nonlimiting examples include alkylation at \n \nposition\n \n 10 or 40 and pegylation at one or more positions in the C-terminal portion of the glucagon peptide, e.g., position 24, 28 29, or 40, within a C-terminal extension, or at the C-terminus (e.g., through adding a C-terminal Cys).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a specific aspect of the invention, the glucagon peptide is modified to comprise an alkyl group by direct alkylation of an amine, hydroxyl, or thiol of a side chain of an amino acid of the glucagon peptide. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptide is directly alkylated through the side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol of an amino acid. In some embodiments, alkylation is at \n \n \nposition\n \n \n 10, 20, 24, 29, or 40. In this regard, the alkylated glucagon peptide can comprise the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, or a modified amino acid sequence thereof comprising one or more of the amino acid modifications described herein, with at least one of the amino acids at \n \n \npositions\n \n \n 10, 20, 24, 29, and 40 modified to any amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol. In some specific embodiments of the invention, the direct alkylation of the glucagon peptide occurs through the side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol of the amino acid at \nposition\n 10.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the amino acid comprising a side chain amine is an amino acid of Formula I. In some exemplary embodiments, the amino acid of Formula I, is the amino acid wherein n is 4 (Lys) or n is 3 (Orn).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the amino acid comprising a side chain hydroxyl is an amino acid of Formula II. In some exemplary embodiments, the amino acid of Formula II is the amino acid wherein n is 1 (Ser).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet other embodiments, the amino acid comprising a side chain thiol is an amino acid of Formula III. In some exemplary embodiments, the amino acid of Formula III is the amino acid wherein n is 1 (Cys).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet other embodiments, the amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol is a disubstituted amino acid comprising the same structure of Formula I, Formula II, or Formula III, except that the hydrogen bonded to the alpha carbon of the amino acid of Formula I, Formula II, or Formula III is replaced with a second side chain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the invention, the alkylated glucagon peptide comprises a spacer between the peptide and the alkyl group. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptide is covalently bound to the spacer, which is covalently bound to the alkyl group. In some exemplary embodiments, the glucagon peptide is modified to comprise an alkyl group by alkylation of an amine, hydroxyl, or thiol of a spacer, which spacer is attached to a side chain of an amino acid at \n \n \nposition\n \n \n 10, 20, 24, 29, or 40 of the glucagon peptide. The amino acid to which the spacer is attached can be any amino acid (e.g., a singly α-substituted amino acid or an α,α-disubstituted amino acid) comprising a moiety which permits linkage to the spacer. For example, an amino acid comprising a side chain NH\n2\n, —OH, or —COOH (e.g., Lys, Orn, Ser, Asp, or Glu) is suitable. In this respect, the alkylated glucagon peptide can comprise the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, or a modified amino acid sequence thereof comprising one or more of the amino acid modifications described herein, with at least one of the amino acids at \n \n \npositions\n \n \n 10, 20, 24, 29, and 40 modified to any amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or carboxylate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the spacer is an amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol or a dipeptide or tripeptide comprising an amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen alkylation occurs through an amine group of a spacer the alkylation can occur through the alpha amine of the amino acid or a side chain amine. In the instance in which the alpha amine is alkylated, the spacer amino acid can be any amino acid. For example, the spacer amino acid can be a hydrophobic amino acid, e.g., Gly, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, Trp, Met, Phe, Tyr, 6-amino hexanoic acid, 5-aminovaleric acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, and 8-aminooctanoic acid. Alternatively, the spacer amino acid can be an acidic residue, e.g., Asp and Glu, provided that the alkylation occurs on the alpha amine of the acidic residue. In the instance in which the side chain amine of the spacer amino acid is alkylated, the spacer amino acid is an amino acid comprising a side chain amine, e.g., an amino acid of Formula I (e.g., Lys or Urn). In this instance, it is possible for both the alpha amine and the side chain amine of the spacer amino acid to be alkylated, such that the glucagon peptide is dialkylated. Embodiments of the invention include such dialkylated molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen alkylation occurs through a hydroxyl group of a spacer, the amino acid or one of the amino acids of the dipeptide or tripeptide can be an amino acid of Formula II. In a specific exemplary embodiment, the amino acid is Ser.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen acylation occurs through a thiol group of spacer, the amino acid or one of the amino acids of the dipeptide or tripeptide can be an amino acid of Formula III. In a specific exemplary embodiment, the amino acid is Cys.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the spacer is a hydrophilic bifunctional spacer. In certain embodiments, the hydrophilic bifunctional spacer comprises two or more reactive groups, e.g., an amine, a hydroxyl, a thiol, and a carboxyl group or any combinations thereof. In certain embodiments, the hydrophilic bifunctional spacer comprises a hydroxyl group and a carboxylate. In other embodiments, the hydrophilic bifunctional spacer comprises an amine group and a carboxylate. In other embodiments, the hydrophilic bifunctional spacer comprises a thiol group and a carboxylate. In a specific embodiment, the spacer comprises an amino poly(alkyloxy)carboxylate. In this regard, the spacer can comprise, for example, NH\n2\n(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)\nn\n(CH\n2\n)\nm\nCOOH, wherein m is any integer from 1 to 6 and n is any integer from 2 to 12, such as, e.g., 8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoic acid, which is commercially available from Peptides International, Inc. (Louisville, Ky.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the spacer is a hydrophobic bifunctional spacer. In certain embodiments, the hydrophobic bifunctional spacer comprises two or more reactive groups, e.g., an amine, a hydroxyl, a thiol, and a carboxyl group or any combinations thereof. In certain embodiments, the hydrophobic bifunctional spacer comprises a hydroxyl group and a carboxylate. In other embodiments, the hydropholic bifunctional spacer comprises an amine group and a carboxylate. In other embodiments, the hydropholic bifunctional spacer comprises a thiol group and a carboxylate. Suitable hydrophobic bifunctional spacers comprising a carboxylate, and a hydroxyl group or a thiol group are known in the art and include, for example, 8-hydroxyoctanoic acid and 8-mercaptooctanoic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe spacer (e.g., amino acid, dipeptide, tripeptide, hydrophilic bifunctional, or hydrophobic bifunctional spacer) in specific embodiments is 3 to 10 atoms (e.g., 6 to 10 atoms, (e.g., 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 atoms)) in length. In more specific embodiments, the spacer is about 3 to 10 atoms (e.g., 6 to 10 atoms) in length and the alkyl is a C\n12 \nto C\n18 \nalkyl group, e.g., C14 alkyl group, C16 alkyl group, such that the total length of the spacer and alkyl group is 14 to 28 atoms, e.g., about 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, or 28 atoms. In some embodiments, the length of the spacer and alkyl is 17 to 28 (e.g., 19 to 26, 19 to 21) atoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with certain foregoing embodiments, the bifunctional spacer can be a synthetic or non-naturally occurring amino acid comprising an amino acid backbone that is 3 to 10 atoms in length (e.g., 6-amino hexanoic acid, 5-aminovaleric acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, and 8-aminooctanoic acid). Alternatively, the spacer can be a dipeptide or tripeptide spacer having a peptide backbone that is 3 to 10 atoms (e.g., 6 to 10 atoms) in length. The dipeptide or tripeptide spacer can be composed of naturally-occurring and/or non-naturally occurring amino acids, including, for example, any of the amino acids taught herein. In some embodiments, the spacer comprises an overall negative charge, e.g., comprises one or two negatively charged amino acids. In some embodiments, the dipeptide spacer is selected from the group consisting of: Ala-Ala, β-Ala-n-Ala, Leu-Leu, Pro-Pro, γ-aminobutyric acid-γ-aminobutyric acid, and γ-Glu-γ-Glu.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable methods of peptide alkylation via amines, hydroxyls, and thiols are known in the art. For example, a Williamson ether synthesis can be used to form an ether linkage between a hydroxyl group of the glucagon peptide and the alkyl group. Also, a nucleophilic substitution reaction of the peptide with an alkyl halide can result in any of an ether, thioether, or amino linkage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe alkyl group of the alkylated glucagon peptide can be of any size, e.g., any length carbon chain, and can be linear or branched. In some embodiments of the invention, the alkyl group is a C\n4 \nto C\n30 \nalkyl.

The leaving group of the glucagon peptide can be part of a side chain of an amino acid or can be part of the peptide backbone. Suitable leaving groups include, for example, N-hydroxysuccinimide, halogens, and sulfonate esters.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the glucagon peptide is modified to comprise an alkyl group by reacting the nucleophilic, long chain alkane with a spacer which is attached to the glucagon peptide, wherein the spacer comprises the leaving group.

The Lys, Cys, Orn, homocysteine, or acetyl-phenylalanine may be an amino acid that is native to the glucagon sequence (SEQ ID NO: 1) or it may be an amino acid which is replacing a native amino acid of SEQ ID NO: 1. In, some embodiments, wherein the hydrophilic moiety is attached to a Cys, the linkage to the hydrophilic moiety can comprise the structure\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWith regard to the analogs comprising a hydrophilic moiety, the hydrophilic moiety may be any of those described herein. See, e.g., the teachings under the section “Linkage of hydrophilic moieties.” In some embodiments, the hydrophilic moiety is a polyethylene glycol (PEG). The PEG in certain embodiments has a molecular weight of about 1,000 Daltons to about 40,000 Daltons, e.g., about 20,000 Daltons to about 40,000 Daltons.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the exemplary embodiments, wherein the analog comprises an acyl or alkyl group, which is attached to the analog via a spacer, the spacer can be any spacer as described herein. The spacer, for example, may be 3 to 10 atoms in length and may be, for instance, an amino acid (e.g., 6-amino hexanoic acid, any amino acid described herein), a dipeptide (e.g., Ala-Ala, βAla-βAla, Leu-Leu, Pro-Pro, γGlu-γGlu), a tripeptide, or a hydrophilic or hydrophobic bifunctional spacer. In certain aspects, the total length of the spacer and the acyl or alkyl group is about 14 to about 28 atoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe acyl or alkyl group is any acyl or alkyl group as described herein, such as an acyl or alkyl group which is non-native to a naturally occurring amino acid. The acyl or alkyl group in some embodiments is a C4 to C30 fatty acyl group, such as, for example, a C10 fatty acyl or alkyl group, a C12 fatty acyl or alkyl group, a C14 fatty acyl or alkyl group, a C16 fatty acyl or alkyl group, a C18 fatty acyl or alkyl group, a C20 acyl or alkyl group, or a C22 acyl or alkyl group, or a C\n4 \nto C\n30 \nalkyl group. In specific embodiments, the acyl group is a C12 to C18 fatty acyl group (e.g., a C14 or C16 fatty acyl group).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the extension of about 1 to about 21 amino acids C-terminal to the amino acid at position 29 of the analog comprises the amino acid sequence of GPSSGAPPPS (SEQ ID NO: 95) or XGPSSGAPPPS (SEQ ID NO: 96), wherein X is any amino acid, or GPSSGAPPPK (SEQ ID NO: 170) or XGPSSGAPPPK (SEQ ID NO: 171) or XGPSSGAPPPSK (SEQ ID NO: 172), wherein X is Gly or a small, aliphatic or non-polar or slightly polar amino acid. In some embodiments, the about 1 to about 21 amino acids may comprise sequences containing one or more conservative substitutions relative to SEQ ID NO: 95, 96, 170, 171 or 172. In some embodiments, the acylated or alkylated amino acid is located at \nposition\n 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, or 43 of the C-terminally-extended analog. In certain embodiments, the acylated or alkylated amino acid is located at \nposition\n 40 of the C-terminally extended analog.\n\n\n \nPharmaceutical Compositions and Treatment Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nIn some aspects, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising any of the novel glucagon peptides disclosed herein, preferably sterile and preferably at a purity level of at least 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99%, and a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, carrier or excipient.

Martin (Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1980), which is incorporated by reference in its entirety, discloses various components used in formulating pharmaceutically acceptable compositions and known techniques for the preparation thereof. Except insofar as any conventional agent is incompatible with the pharmaceutical compositions, its use in pharmaceutical compositions is contemplated. Supplementary active ingredients also can be incorporated into the compositions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical formulations disclosed herein may be designed to be short-acting, fast-releasing, long-acting, or sustained-releasing as described below. The pharmaceutical formulations may also be formulated for immediate release, controlled release or for slow release.

The disclosed pharmaceutical formulations may be administered according to any regime including, for example, daily (1 time per day, 2 times per day, 3 times per day, 4 times per day, 5 times per day, 6 times per day), every two days, every three days, every four days, every five days, every six days, weekly, bi-weekly, every three weeks, monthly, or bi-monthly.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the foregoing component(s) may be present in the pharmaceutical composition at any concentration, such as, for example, at least A, wherein A is 0.0001% w/v, 0.001% w/v, 0.01% w/v, 0.1% w/v, 1% w/v, 2% w/v, 5% w/v, 10% w/v, 20% w/v, 30% w/v, 40% w/v, 50% w/v, 60% w/v, 70% w/v, 80% w/v, or 90% w/v. In some embodiments, the foregoing component(s) may be present in the pharmaceutical composition at any concentration, such as, for example, at most B, wherein B is 90% w/v, 80% w/v, 70% w/v, 60% w/v, 50% w/v, 40% w/v, 30% w/v, 20% w/v, 10% w/v, 5% w/v, 2% w/v, 1% w/v, 0.1% w/v, 0.001% w/v, or 0.0001%. In other embodiments, the foregoing component(s) may be present in the pharmaceutical composition at any concentration range, such as, for example from about A to about B. In some embodiments, A is 0.0001% and B is 90%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated to achieve a physiologically compatible pH. In some embodiments, the pH of the pharmaceutical composition may be at least 5, at least 5.5, at least 6, at least 6.5, at least 7, at least 7.5, at least 8, at least 8.5, at least 9, at least 9.5, at least 10, or at least 10.5 up to and including pH 11, depending on the formulation and route of administration. In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions may comprise buffering agents to achieve a physiological compatible pH. The buffering agents may include any compounds capable of buffering at the desired pH such as, for example, phosphate buffers (e.g. PBS), triethanolamine, Tris, bicine, TAPS, tricine, HEPES, TES, MOPS, PIPES, cacodylate, MES, and others. In certain embodiments, the strength of the buffer is at least 0.5 mM, at least 1 mM, at least 5 mM, at least 10 mM, at least 20 mM, at least 30 mM, at least 40 mM, at least 50 mM, at least 60 mM, at least 70 mM, at least 80 mM, at least 90 mM, at least 100 mM, at least 120 mM, at least 150 mM, or at least 200 mM.

For example, glucagon activity can increase glucose levels, for insulin buffering, or to decrease gut motility during radiological examination. GLP-1 activity can lower glucose levels, an activity useful for treating hyperglycemia, e.g. diabetes. GLP-1 activity can also induce weight loss or prevent weight gain, e.g. through decreasing appetite. GIP activity can also lower glucose levels, an activity useful for treating hyperglycemia, e.g. diabetes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGIP/GLP-1 co-agonists and glucagon/GIP/GLP-1 tri-agonists are particularly advantageous for inducing weight loss or preventing weight gain, as well as for treating hyperglycemia, including diabetes. In vivo data disclosed herein demonstrates that the combination of GIP agonist activity with GLP-1 agonist activity produces a greater effect on weight reduction than GLP-1 alone. This activity is particularly unexpected in view of teachings in the art that antagonizing GIP is desirable for reducing daily food intake and body weight, and increasing insulin sensitivity and energy expenditure. (Irwin et al., Diabetologia 50: 1532-1540 (2007); and Althage et al., J Biol Chem, e-publication on Apr. 17, 2008).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn vivo data disclosed herein also demonstrates that the combination of GIP agonist activity with GLP-1 agonist activity reduces glucose levels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, the glucagon peptides described herein are expected to be used to reduce or maintain body weight, or to treat hyperglycemia, or to reduce blood glucose level, or to normalize and/or stabilize blood glucose level.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a method of treating hyperglycemia, or a method of reducing weight gain or inducing weight loss is provided, which involves administering an effective amount of an aqueous solution comprising a glucagon peptide of the invention. In further embodiments, methods of treating diabetes involving co-administering a conventional dose or a reduced dose of insulin and a glucagon peptide of the invention are provided. Methods of treating diabetes with a glucagon peptide of the invention, without co-administering insulin are also provided.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch methods for treating hyperglycemia are expected to be useful for a variety of types of hyperglycemia, including diabetes, diabetes mellitus type I, diabetes mellitus type II, or gestational diabetes, either insulin-dependent or non-insulin-dependent, and reducing complications of diabetes including nephropathy, retinopathy and vascular disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for reducing appetite or promoting loss of body weight are expected to be useful in reducing body weight, preventing weight gain, or treating obesity of various causes, including drug-induced obesity, and reducing complications associated with obesity including vascular disease (coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, ischemia reperfusion, etc.), hypertension, onset of diabetes type II, hyperlipidemia and musculoskeletal diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMetabolic Syndrome, also known as metabolic syndrome X, insulin resistance syndrome or Reaven's syndrome, is a disorder that affects over 50 million Americans. Metabolic Syndrome is typically characterized by a clustering of at least three or more of the following risk factors: (1) abdominal obesity (excessive fat tissue in and around the abdomen), (2) atherogenic dyslipidemia (blood fat disorders including high triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol and high LDL cholesterol that enhance the accumulation of plaque in the artery walls), (3) elevated blood pressure, (4) insulin resistance or glucose intolerance, (5) prothrombotic state (e.g. high fibrinogen or plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 in blood), and (6) pro-inflammatory state (e.g. elevated C-reactive protein in blood). Other risk factors may include aging, hormonal imbalance and genetic predisposition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMetabolic Syndrome is associated with an increased the risk of coronary heart disease and other disorders related to the accumulation of vascular plaque, such as stroke and peripheral vascular disease, referred to as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Patients with Metabolic Syndrome may progress from an insulin resistant state in its early stages to full blown type II diabetes with further increasing risk of ASCVD. Without intending to be bound by any particular theory, the relationship between insulin resistance, Metabolic Syndrome and vascular disease may involve one or more concurrent pathogenic mechanisms including impaired insulin-stimulated vasodilation, insulin resistance-associated reduction in NO availability due to enhanced oxidative stress, and abnormalities in adipocyte-derived hormones such as adiponectin (Lteif and Mather, Can. J. Cardiol. 20 (suppl. B):66B-76B (2004)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to the 2001 National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel (ATP III), any three of the following traits in the same individual meet the criteria for Metabolic Syndrome: (a) abdominal obesity (a waist circumference over 102 cm in men and over 88 cm in women); (b) serum triglycerides (150 mg/dl or above); (c) HDL cholesterol (40 mg/dl or lower in men and 50 mg/dl or lower in women); (d) blood pressure (130/85 or more); and (e) fasting blood glucose (110 mg/dl or above). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an individual having high insulin levels (an elevated fasting blood glucose or an elevated post meal glucose alone) with at least two of the following criteria meets the criteria for Metabolic Syndrome: (a) abdominal obesity (waist to hip ratio of greater than 0.9, a body mass index of at least 30 kg/m\n2\n, or a waist measurement over 37 inches); (b) cholesterol panel showing a triglyceride level of at least 150 mg/dl or an HDL cholesterol lower than 35 mg/dl; (c) blood pressure of 140/90 or more, or on treatment for high blood pressure). (Mathur, Ruchi, “Metabolic Syndrome,” ed. Shiel, Jr., William C., MedicineNet.com, May 11, 2009).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor purposes herein, if an individual meets the criteria of either or both of the criteria set forth by the 2001 National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel or the WHO, that individual is considered as afflicted with Metabolic Syndrome.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWithout being bound to any particular theory, glucagon peptides described herein are useful for treating Metabolic Syndrome. Accordingly, the invention provides a method of preventing or treating Metabolic Syndrome, or reducing one, two, three or more risk factors thereof, in a subject, comprising administering to the subject a glucagon peptide described herein in an amount effective to prevent or treat Metabolic Syndrome, or the risk factor thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) refers to a wide spectrum of liver disease ranging from simple fatty liver (steatosis), to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), to cirrhosis (irreversible, advanced scarring of the liver). All of the stages of NAFLD have in common the accumulation of fat (fatty infiltration) in the liver cells (hepatocytes). Simple fatty liver is the abnormal accumulation of a certain type of fat, triglyceride, in the liver cells with no inflammation or scarring. In NASH, the fat accumulation is associated with varying degrees of inflammation (hepatitis) and scarring (fibrosis) of the liver. The inflammatory cells can destroy the liver cells (hepatocellular necrosis). In the terms “steatohepatitis” and “steatonecrosis”, steato refers to fatty infiltration, hepatitis refers to inflammation in the liver, and necrosis refers to destroyed liver cells. NASH can ultimately lead to scarring of the liver (fibrosis) and then irreversible, advanced scarring (cirrhosis). Cirrhosis that is caused by NASH is the last and most severe stage in the NAFLD spectrum. (Mendler, Michel, “Fatty Liver: Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH),” ed. Schoenfield, Leslie J., MedicineNet.com, Aug. 29, 2005).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlcoholic Liver Disease, or Alcohol-Induced Liver Disease, encompasses three pathologically distinct liver diseases related to or caused by the excessive consumption of alcohol: fatty liver (steatosis), chronic or acute hepatitis, and cirrhosis. Alcoholic hepatitis can range from a mild hepatitis, with abnormal laboratory tests being the only indication of disease, to severe liver dysfunction with complications such as jaundice (yellow skin caused by bilirubin retention), hepatic encephalopathy (neurological dysfunction caused by liver failure), ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdomen), bleeding esophageal varices (varicose veins in the esophagus), abnormal blood clotting and coma. Histologically, alcoholic hepatitis has a characteristic appearance with ballooning degeneration of hepatocytes, inflammation with neutrophils and sometimes Mallory bodies (abnormal aggregations of cellular intermediate filament proteins). Cirrhosis is characterized anatomically by widespread nodules in the liver combined with fibrosis. (Worman, Howard J., “Alcoholic Liver Disease”, Columbia University Medical Center website).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWithout being bound to any particular theory, glucagon peptides described herein are useful for the treatment of Alcoholic Liver Disease, NAFLD, or any stage thereof, including, for example, steatosis, steatohepatitis, hepatitis, hepatic inflammation, NASH, cirrhosis, or complications thereof. Accordingly, the invention provides a method of preventing or treating Alcoholic Liver Disease, NAFLD, or any stage thereof, in a subject comprising administering to a subject a glucagon peptide described herein in an amount effective to prevent or treat Alcoholic Liver Disease, NAFLD, or the stage thereof. Such treatment methods include reduction in one, two, three or more of the following: liver fat content, incidence or progression of cirrhosis, incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma, signs of inflammation, e.g. abnormal hepatic enzyme levels (e.g., aspartate aminotransferase AST and/or alanine aminotransferase ALT, or LDH), elevated serum ferritin, elevated serum bilirubin, and/or signs of fibrosis, e.g. elevated TGF-beta levels. In preferred embodiments, the glucagon peptides are used treat patients who have progressed beyond simple fatty liver (steatosis) and exhibit signs of inflammation or hepatitis. Such methods may result, for example, in reduction of AST and/or ALT levels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe glucagon peptides of the invention may be administered alone or in combination with other anti-diabetic or anti-obesity agents. Anti-diabetic agents known in the art or under investigation include insulin, sulfonylureas, such as tolbutamide (Orinase), acetohexamide (Dymelor), tolazamide (Tolinase), chlorpropamide (Diabinese), glipizide (Glucotrol), glyburide (Diabeta, Micronase, Glynase), glimepiride (Amaryl), or gliclazide (Diamicron); meglitinides, such as repaglinide (Prandin) or nateglinide (Starlix); biguanides such as metformin (Glucophage) or phenformin; thiazolidinediones such as rosiglitazone (Avandia), pioglitazone (Actos), or troglitazone (Rezulin), or other PPARγ inhibitors; alpha glucosidase inhibitors that inhibit carbohydrate digestion, such as miglitol (Glyset), acarbose (Precose/Glucobay); exenatide (Byetta) or pramlintide; Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors such as vildagliptin or sitagliptin; SGLT (sodium-dependent glucose transporter 1) inhibitors; glucokinase activators (GKA); glucagon receptor antagonists (GRA); or FBPase (\nfructose\n 1,6-bisphosphatase) inhibitors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-obesity agents known in the art or under investigation include, Leptin and Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 (FGF-21), appetite suppressants, such as phenethylamine type stimulants, phentermine (optionally with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine), diethylpropion (Tenuate®), phendimetrazine (Prelu-2®, Bontril®), benzphetamine (Didrex®), sibutramine (Meridia®, Reductil®); rimonabant (Acomplia®), other cannabinoid receptor antagonists; oxyntomodulin; fluoxetine hydrochloride (Prozac); Qnexa (topiramate and phentermine), Excalia (bupropion and zonisamide) or Contrave (bupropion and naltrexone); or lipase inhibitors, similar to xenical (Orlistat) or Cetilistat (also known as ATL-962), or GT 389-255.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlucagon peptides of the invention that retain the glucose-raising effects of glucagon in hypoglycemic patients may be used to treat hypoglycemia, e.g., preventing or treating acute, periodic or nocturnal hypoglycemia. Such glucagon peptides can also be administered in conjunction with insulin to buffer the actions of insulin and help to maintain stable blood glucose levels in diabetics. In such embodiments an improved method of regulating blood glucose levels in insulin dependent patients is provided. The glucagon peptides of the present disclosure can be co-administered with insulin as a single composition, simultaneously administered as separate solutions, or alternatively, the insulin and the glucagon peptide can be administered at different time relative to one another. In some embodiments, the method comprises the steps of administering insulin in an amount therapeutically effective for the control of diabetes and administering a novel modified glucagon peptide of the present disclosure in an amount therapeutically effective for the prevention of hypoglycemia, wherein said administering steps are conducted within twelve hours of each other. The exact ratio of the modified glucagon peptide relative to the administered insulin will be dependent in part on determining the glucose levels of the patient and other clinical parameters. “Normalizing” blood level means that the blood glucose level is returned to normal (e.g., lowering blood glucose level if it is higher than normal, or raising blood glucose level if it is lower than normal). “Stabilizing” blood glucose level means reducing the maximal variation in blood glucose level over a period of time, e.g., 8 hours, 16 hours, 24 hours, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days or 1 week. For example, administration of glucagon peptide causes the blood glucose level over time to be maintained closer to the normal range of glucose values than it would be in the absence of administration of glucagon peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlucagon peptides of the invention that retain the desired activity can be used to induce temporary paralysis of the gut for radiological uses, or treat other metabolic diseases that result from low blood levels of glucagon. In such embodiments a method is provided for inducing the temporary paralysis of the intestinal tract. The method comprises the step of administering one or more of the glucagon peptides disclosed herein to a patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a different aspect, the invention provides a method of reducing weight gain or inducing weight loss, or treating hyperglycemia, comprising co-administering to a patient in need thereof a GIP receptor agonist molecule and a GLP-1 receptor agonist molecule in amounts effective to reduce weight gain or induce weight loss or decrease appetite. The two molecules can be together in the same composition. Alternatively, a molecule that activates both GIP and GLP-1 receptors can be administered in such methods. The combination of various receptor agonist, i.e., activation, properties provides an unexpected additive or synergistic effect, or other unexpected clinical benefit(s). Administration with a conventional dose of insulin, a reduced dose of insulin, or without insulin is contemplated according to such methods. Exemplary GIP receptor agonist molecules include GIP or GIP analogs, e.g., that retain at least 50%, 60%, 70%, or 80% sequence identity upon visual inspection after alignment to maximize matches. Exemplary GLP-1 receptor agonists molecules include GLP-1, GLP-1 analogs, e.g., that retain at least 50%, 60%, 70%, or 80% sequence identity upon visual inspection after alignment to maximize matches, exendin-4 analogs, e.g., that retain at least 50%, 60%, 70%, or 80% sequence identity upon visual inspection after alignment to maximize matches or derivatives thereof. Exemplary molecules that exhibit both activities include glucagon peptides of the invention, GLP-1 analogs that activate both GLP-1 and GIP receptors, fusions of GIP and GLP-1, or fusions of GIP analogs and GLP-1 analogs, or chemically modified derivatives thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe treatment methods in accordance with the present invention including but not limited to treatment of hypoglycemia, may comprise the steps of administering the presently disclosed glucagon peptides to a patient using any standard route of administration, including parenterally, such as intravenously, intraperitoneally, subcutaneously or intramuscularly, intrathecally, transdermally, rectally, orally, nasally or by inhalation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with some embodiments, excluded from such methods, on a disease-by-disease basis, are any glucagon analogs or GLP-1 analogs in the prior art disclosed to be useful for treating that particular disease. In another embodiment peptides described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,864,069 as acting as both a GLP-1 agonist and a glucagon antagonist for treating diabetes may also be excluded. In another embodiment, the invention may exclude the use of glucagon antagonists to treat diabetes, such as the antagonists described in Unson et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem., \n264:789-794 (1989), Ahn et al., \nJ. Med. Chem., \n44:3109-3116 (2001), and Sapse et al., \nMol. Med., \n8(5):251-262 (2002). In some embodiments, oxyntomodulin or a glucagon peptide that contains the 8 C-terminal amino acids of oxyntomodulin (SEQ ID NO: 97) may be excluded.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOxyntomodulin, a naturally occurring digestive hormone found in the small intestine, induces weight loss (see Diabetes 2005; 54:2390-2395). Oxyntomodulin is a 37 amino acid peptide that contains the 29 amino acid sequence of glucagon (i.e. SEQ ID NO: 1) followed by an 8 amino acid carboxy terminal extension of SEQ ID NO: 97 (KRNRNNIA). While the present invention contemplates that glucagon peptides described herein may optionally be joined to this 8 amino acid carboxy terminal extension (SEQ ID NO: 97), the invention in some embodiments also specifically contemplates glucagon peptides lacking the 8 contiguous carboxy amino acids of SEQ ID NO: 97.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny one of the following peptides is excluded from the compounds of the invention, although further modifications thereto exhibiting the desired co-agonist pr tri-agonist activity, pharmaceutical compositions, kits, and treatment methods using such compounds may be included in the invention: The peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 with an [Arg12] substitution and with a C-terminal amide; The peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 with [Arg12, Lys20] substitutions and with a C-terminal amide; The peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 with [Arg12, Lys24] substitutions and with a C-terminal amide; The peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 with [Arg12, Lys29] substitutions and with a C-terminal amide; The peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 with a [Glu9] substitution; The peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 missing His1, with [Glu9, Glu16, Lys29] substitutions and C-terminal amide; The peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 with [Glu9, Glu16, Lys29] substitutions and with a C-terminal amide; The peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 with [Lys13, Glu17] substitutions linked via lactam bridge and with a C-terminal amide; The peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 with [Lys17, Glu21] substitutions linked via lactam bridge and with a C-terminal amide; the peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 missing His1, with [Glu20, Lys24] substitutions linked via lactam bridge; the peptides disclosed in PCT/US2008/053857, filed Feb. 13, 2008, PCT/US2006/017494, filed May 5, 2006; PCT/US2007/018415, filed Aug. 17, 2007; PCT/GB2005/000710, filed Feb. 25, 2005; PCT/GB00/01089, filed Mar. 29, 2000; PCT/US2006/005020, filed Feb. 10, 2006; each of which are incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention may be prepared by standard synthetic methods, recombinant DNA techniques, or any other methods of preparing peptides and fusion proteins. Although certain non-natural amino acids cannot be expressed by standard recombinant DNA techniques, techniques for their preparation are known in the art. Compounds of the invention that encompass non-peptide portions may be synthesized by standard organic chemistry reactions, in addition to standard peptide chemistry reactions when applicable. Additional data on glucagon and GLP-1 activity of glucagon peptides is also disclosed in PCT/US2008/053857, filed Feb. 13, 2008, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\nGeneral Synthesis Protocol\n\n\n \n \n \nGlucagon analogs were synthesized using HBTU-activated “Fast Boc” single coupling starting from 0.2 mmole of Boc Thr(OBzl)Pam resin on a modified Applied Biosystem 430 A peptide synthesizer. Boc amino acids and HBTU were obtained from Midwest Biotech (Fishers, Ind.). Side chain protecting groups used were: Arg(Tos), Asn(Xan), Asp(OcHex), Cys(pMeBzl), His(Bom), Lys(2Cl—Z), Ser(OBzl), Thr(OBzl), Tyr(2Br—Z), and Trp(CHO). The side-chain protecting group on the N-terminal His was Boc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach completed peptidyl resin was treated with a solution of 20% piperidine in dimethylformamide to remove the formyl group from the tryptophan. Liquid hydrogen fluoride cleavages were performed in the presence of p-cresol and dimethyl sulfide. The cleavage was run for 1 hour in an ice bath using an HF apparatus (Penninsula Labs). After evaporation of the HF, the residue was suspended in diethyl ether and the solid materials were filtered. Each peptide was extracted into 30-70 ml aqueous acetic acid and a diluted aliquot was analyzed by HPLC [Beckman System Gold, 0.46×5 cm Zorbax C8, 1 ml/min, 45 C, 214 nm, A buffer=0.1% TFA, B=0.1% TFA/90% acetonitrile, gradient of 10% to 80% B over 10 min].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPurification was done on a FPLC over a 2.2×25 cm Kromasil C18 column while monitoring the UV at 214 nm and collecting 5 minute fractions.

Excess (2-fold) maleimido methoxyPEG reagent (Nektar) is added and the reaction stirred at room temp while monitoring reaction progress by HPLC. After 8-24 hrs, the reaction mixture, is acidified and loaded onto a preparative reverse phase column for purification using 0.1% TFA/acetonitrile gradient.

The completed peptidyl resin was treated with 20% piperidine/dimethylformamide to remove the Trp formyl protection then transferred to an HF reaction vessel and dried in vacuo. 1.0 ml p-cresol and 0.5 ml dimethyl sulfide were added along with a magnetic stir bar. The vessel was attached to the HF apparatus (Pennisula Labs), cooled in a dry ice/methanol bath, evacuated, and aprox. 10 ml liquid hydrogen fluoride was condensed in. The reaction was stirred in an ice bath for 1 hr then the HF was removed in vacuo. The residue was suspended in ethyl ether; the solids were filtered, washed with ether, and the peptide extracted into 50 ml aqueous acetic acid. An analytical HPLC was run [0.46×5 cm Zorbax C8, 1 ml/min, 45 C, 214 nm, A buffer of 0.1% TFA, B buffer of 0.1% TFA/90% ACN, gradient=10% B to 80% B over 10 min.] with a small sample of the cleavage extract. The remaining extract was loaded onto a 2.2×25 cm Kromasil C18 preparative reverse phase column and an acetonitrile gradient was run using a Pharmacia FPLC system. 5 min fractions were collected while monitoring the UV at 214 nm (2.0 A).

Analytical HPLC showed a purity of 90% and MALDI mass spectral analysis shows a component in the 9500-11,000 range which is consistent with the desired dimer.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 13\n\n\nSynthesis of Glucagon Lactams\n\n\n \n \n \n285 mg (0.2 mmole) methoxybenzhydrylamine resin (Midwest Biotech) was added to a 60 mL reaction vessels and the following sequence was assembled on a modified Applied Biosystems 430A peptide synthesizer using Boc DEPBT-activated single couplings.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHSQGTFTSDYSKYLDERRAQDFVQWLMNT-NH2 (12-16 Lactam)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following side chain protecting groups were used: Arg(Tos), Asp(OcHx), Asn(Xan), Glu(OFm), His(BOM), Lys(Fmoc), Ser(Bzl), Thr(Bzl), Trp(CHO), Tyr(Br—Z). Lys(Cl—Z) was used at \nposition\n 12 if lactams were constructed from 16-20, 20-24, or 24-28. The completed peptidyl resin was treated with 20% piperidine/dimethylformamide for one hour with rotation to remove the Trp formyl group as well as the Fmoc and OFm protection from Lys12 and Glu16. Upon confirmation of removal by a positive ninhydrin test, the resin was washed with dimethylformamide, followed by dichloromethane and than again with dimethylformamide. The resin was treated with 520 mg (1 mmole) Benzotriazole-1-yl-oxy-tris-pyrrolidino-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBOP) in dimethylformamide and diisopropylethylamine (DIEA). The reaction proceeded for 8-10 hours and the cyclization was confirmed by a negative ninhydrin reaction. The resin was washed with dimethylformamide, followed by dichloromethane and subsequently treated with trifluoroacetic acid for 10 minutes. The removal of the Boc group was confirmed by a positive ninhydrin reaction. The resin was washed with dimethylformamide and dichloromethane and dried before being transferred to a hydrofluoric acid (HF) reaction vessel. 500 μL p-cresol was added along with a magnetic stir bar. The vessel was attached to the HF apparatus (Peninsula Labs), cooled in a dry ice/methanol bath, evacuated, and approximately 10 mL of liquid hydrofluoric acid was condensed into the vessel. The reaction was stirred for 1 hour in an ice bath and the HF was subsequently removed in vacuo. The residue was suspended in ethyl ether; the solids were filtered, washed with ether, and the peptide was solubilized with 150 \nmL\n 20% acetonitrile/1% acetic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn analytical HPLC analysis of the crude solubilized peptide was conducted under the following conditions [4.6×30 mm Xterra C8, 1.50 mL/min, 220 nm, A buffer 0.1% TFA/10% ACN, B buffer 0.1% TFA/100% ACN, gradient 5-95% B over 15 minutes]. The extract was diluted twofold with water and loaded onto a 2.2×25 cm Vydac C4 preparative reverse phase column and eluted using an acetonitrile gradient on a Waters HPLC system (A buffer of 0.1% TFA/10% ACN, B buffer of 0.1% TFA/10% CAN and a gradient of 0-100% B over 120 minutes at a flow of 15.00 ml/min. HPLC analysis of the purified peptide demonstrated greater than 95% purity and electrospray ionization mass spectral analysis confirmed a mass of 3506 Da for the 12-16 lactam. Lactams from 16-20, 20-24, and 24-28 were prepared similarly.\n\n\n \nExample 14\n\n\nGlucagon Solubility Assays\n\n\n \n \n \nA solution (1 mg/ml or 3 mg/ml) of glucagon (or an analog) is prepared in 0.01N HCl. 100 ul of stock solution is diluted to 1 ml with 0.01N HCl and the UV absorbance (276 nm) is determined. The pH of the remaining stock solution is adjusted to pH7 using 200-250 ul 0.1M Na\n2\nHPO\n4 \n(pH 9.2).

Serial 3-fold dilutions of the peptides made in scintillation proximity assay buffer (0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.1% w/v bovine serum albumin) were mixed in 96 well white/clear bottom plate (Corning Inc., Acton, Mass.) with 0.05 nM (3-[\n125\nI]-iodotyrosyl) Tyr10 glucagon (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, N.J.), 1-6 micrograms per well, plasma membrane fragments prepared from cells over-expressing human glucagon receptor, and 1 mg/well polyethyleneimine-treated wheat germ agglutinin type A scintillation proximity assay beads (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, N.J.). Upon 5 min shaking at 800 rpm on a rotary shaker, the plate was incubated 12 h at room temperature and then read on MicroBeta1450 liquid scintillation counter (Perkin-Elmer, Wellesley, Mass.). Non-specifically bound (NSB) radioactivity was measured in the wells with 4 times greater concentration of “cold” native ligand than the highest concentration in test samples and total bound radioactivity was detected in the wells with no competitor. Percent specific binding was calculated as following: % Specific Binding=((Bound-NSB)/(Total bound-NSB))×100. IC\n50 \nvalues were determined by using Origin software (OriginLab, Northampton, Mass.).\n\n\n \nExample 16\n\n\nFunctional Assay\n\n\ncAMP Synthesis\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ability of glucagon analogs to induce cAMP was measured in a firefly luciferase-based reporter assay. HEK293 cells co-transfected with a receptor (glucagon receptor, GLP-1 receptor or GIP receptor) and luciferase gene linked to cAMP responsive element were serum deprived by culturing 16 h in DMEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) supplemented with 0.25% Bovine Growth Serum (HyClone, Logan, Utah) and then incubated with serial dilutions of either glucagon, GLP-1, GIP or novel glucagon analogs for 5 h at 37° C., 5% CO\n2 \nin 96 well poly-D-Lysine-coated “Biocoat” plates (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif.). At the end of the \nincubation\n 100 microliters of LucLite luminescence substrate reagent (Perkin-Elmer, Wellesley, Mass.) were added to each well. The plate was shaken briefly, incubated 10 min in the dark and light output was measured on MicroBeta-1450 liquid scintillation counter (Perkin-Elmer, Wellesley, Mass.). Effective 50% concentrations were calculated by using Origin software (OriginLab, Northampton, Mass.\n\n\n \nExample 17\n\n\nStability Assay for glucagon Cys-maleimido PEG analogs\n\n\n \n \n \nEach glucagon analog was dissolved in water or PBS and an initial HPLC analysis was conducted. After adjusting the pH (4, 5, 6, 7), the samples were incubated over a specified time period at 37° C. and re-analyzed by HPLC to determine the integrity of the peptide. The concentration of the specific peptide of interest was determined and the percent remaining intact was calculated relative to the initial analysis.\n\n\n \nExample 18\n\n\nPreparation of Acylated and/or Pegylated Peptides\n\n\n \n \n \nAcylated and/or PEGylated peptides are prepared as follows. Peptides are synthesized on a solid support resin using either a CS Bio 4886 Peptide Synthesizer or Applied Biosystems 430A Peptide Synthesizer. In situ neutralization chemistry is used as described by Schnolzer et al., \nInt. J. Peptide Protein Res. \n40: 180-193 (1992). For acylated peptides, the target amino acid residue to be acylated (e.g., position ten) is substituted with an N ε-FMOC lysine residue. Treatment of the completed N-terminally BOC protected peptide with 20% piperidine in DMF for 30 minutes removes FMOC/formyl groups. Coupling to the free ε-amino Lys residue is achieved by coupling a ten-fold molar excess of either an FMOC-protected spacer amino acid (ex. FMOC-(N-BOC)-Tryptophan-OH) or acyl chain (ex. C17-COON) and PyBOP or DEPBT coupling reagent in DMF/DIEA. Subsequent removal of the spacer amino acid's FMOC group is followed by repetition of coupling with an acyl chain. Final treatment with 100% TFA results in removal of any side chain protecting groups and the N-terminal BOC group. Peptide resins are neutralized with 5% DIEA/DMF, are dried, and then are cleaved from the support using HF/p-cresol, 95:5, at 0° C. for one hour. Following ether extraction, a 5% HOAc solution is used to solvate the crude peptide. A sample of the solution is then verified to contain the correct molecular weight peptide by ESI-MS. Correct peptides are purified by RP-HPLC using a linear gradient of 10% CH3CN/0.1% TFA to 0.1% TFA in 100% CH3CN. A Vydac C18 22 mm×250 mm protein column is used for the purification. Acylated peptide analogs generally complete elution by a buffer ratio of 20:80. Portions are pooled together and checked for purity on an analytical RP-HPLC. Pure fractions are lyophilized yielding white, solid peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf a peptide comprises a lactam bridge and target residues to be acylated, acylation is carried out as described above upon addition of that amino acid to the peptide backbone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor peptide pegylation, 40 kDa methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) maleimido-propionamide (Chirotech Technology Ltd.) is reacted with a molar equivalent of peptide in 7M Urea, 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer using the minimal amount of solvent needed to dissolve both peptide and PEG into a clear solution (generally less than 2 mL for a reaction using 2-3 mg peptide). Vigorous stirring at room temperature commences for 4-6 hours and the reaction is analyzed by analytical RP-HPLC. PEGylated products appear distinctly from the starting material with decreased retention times. Purification is performed on a Vydac C4 column with conditions similar to those used for the initial peptide purification. Elution typically occurs around buffer ratios of 50:50. Fractions of pure PEGylated peptide are collected and lyophilized.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptides are assayed for biological activity as described above in Example 16. Acylated peptides may exhibit increased potency at the GLP-1 receptor. Inclusion of a tryptophan spacer may provide better potency at the glucagon receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile acylation can extend the half-life of a peptide to hours or more, PEGylation with repeats in tens of kDa ranges can do even more. Peptides comprising both types of modifications are prepared. These peptides are expected to exhibit extended half-life in circulation, as well as resistance to DPP-IV and other proteases.\n\n\n \nExample 20\n\n\nEffect In Vivo on Weight Gain, Appetite and Blood Glucose Levels\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following peptides were synthesized as essentially described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(A) A pegylated glucagon/GLP-1 co-agonist peptide (\nChimera\n 2 \nAIB2 C24\n 40K PEG, which is a \nChimera\n 2 peptide (see Example 21) further modified with an AIB at \nposition\n 2, a Cys at 24 which is attached to a 40K PEG group);\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(B) A pegylated GIP antagonist (Pro3 C24 GIP NH2 (1-42) 40K PEG, which is amino acids 1-42 of GIP (the sequence of native GIP is SEQ ID NO: 4) modified with a Pro at \nposition\n 3, a Cys at position 24, which is attached to a 40K PEG group, and an amide in place of the C-terminal carboxylate);\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(C) A GIP agonist (AIB2 C24 GIP (1-42) 40K PEG, which is amino acids 1-42 of GIP (the sequence of native GIP is SEQ ID NO: 4) modified with AIB at \nposition\n 2 and a Cys at position 24, which is attached to a 40K PEG group); and\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptides were tested in vivo by subcutaneously injecting diet-induced obese (D10) mice with various peptides, or vehicle alone, QW (70 or 210 nmol/kg/week). Each group contained 8 mice, each with an initial average body weight of 50 g. Body weight, body composition, food intake, and blood glucose levels were determined periodically.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFIGS. 1 to 3\n, neither the GIP antagonist nor the GIP agonist peptide were effective at reducing body weight, cumulative food intake, and blood glucose levels in the mice, in comparison to the pegylated glucagon/GLP-1 co-agonist.\n\n\n \nExample 21\n\n\nGIP, GLP-1 and Glucagon Activity of Peptides\n\n\n \n \n \nPeptides of SEQ ID NOs: 5-94 (each of which comprised an amide in place of the C-terminal carboxylate) were synthesized as essentially described above and tested in vitro for activity at the GIP receptor, GLP-1 receptor, and glucagon receptors by Example 16.

mt-147, mt-151, mt-152, mt-158, mt-164, mt-165, mt-166, mt-169, mt-170, mt-172, mt-175, and mt-179 were exemplary GLP-1/GIP/glucagon triagonist peptides, while Peptides mt-148, mt-149, mt-162, mt-174, mt-178, mt-201, and mt-204 were exemplary GLP-1/GIP co-agonist peptides, and Peptides mt-116, mt-176, mt-177, and mt-182 were exemplary GIP/glucagon co-agonist peptides.\n\n\n \nExample 22\n\n\n \n \n \nA GLP-1/GIP/glucagon triagonist peptide (mt-170), GLP-1/GIP co-agonist peptide (mt-178), and two GIP/glucagon co-agonist peptides (mt-182 and mt-179) of Example 21 were tested in vivo by subcutaneously injecting diet-induced obese (DIO) mice with these peptides, a glucagon/GLP-1 co-agonist peptide (\nChimera\n 2 AIB2 (native glucagon amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO: 1) comprising the following modifications: Gln at position 17, Ala at position 18, Lys at \nposition\n 20, Glu at position 21, Ile at position 23, and Ala at position 24, and a C-terminal amide (“\nChimera\n 2”) with a further modification of AIB at position 2) or \nChimera\n 2 AIB2 lactam (same as \nChimera\n 2 AIB2 with further modifications of Glu at position 16 and Lys at \nposition\n 20, wherein a lactam bridges the side chains of Glu16 and Lys20), or vehicle alone, QW (70 or 210 nmol/kg/week). Each group contained 8 mice, each with an initial average body weight of 50 g. Body weight was determined periodically.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFIG. 4\n, the triagonist and GLP-1/GIP co-agonist were a little more effective at reducing body weight in the mice as \nChimera\n 2 AIB2, but not as effective as \nChimera\n 2 AIB2 lactam, which demonstrated the best ability to reduce body weight. In contrast, both of the GIP/glucagon co-agonists, and especially mt-182, were less effective at reducing body weight.\n\n\n \nExample 23\n\n\n \n \n \nA GLP-1/GIP/glucagon triagonist peptide (mt-170) and GLP-1/GIP co-agonist peptide (mt-178) were tested in vivo by subcutaneously injecting diet-induced obese (DIO) mice with these peptides, a GLP agonist (comprising SEQ ID NO: 3 with a Glu at position 16), or vehicle alone, QW (10 nmol/kg/week for 4 weeks or 35 nmol/kg/week for 2 weeks). Each group contained 8 mice, each mouse with an initial average body weight of 49 g. Body weight and blood glucose levels were determined periodically. As shown in \nFIGS. 5 and 6\n, both the GLP-1/GIP co-agonist and triagonist were more effective at reducing body weight and blood glucose levels than the GLP-1 agonist.\n\n\n \nExample 24\n\n\n \n \n \nThe effect of stabilizing the alpha helix of glucagon-based analogs with an alpha, alpha-disubstitited amino acid in lieu of a lactam was investigated by replacing the lactam of mt-165 (SEQ ID NO: 64) and of mt-170 (SEQ ID NO: 69) with an AIB at position 16. The peptide comprising the sequence of mt-165 with an AIB at position 16 in lieu of the lactam was termed “mt-241” and had the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 167, while the peptide comprising the sequence of mt-170 with an AIB at position 16 in lieu of the lactam was termed “mt-248” and had the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 173.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional linear peptides lacking a lactam bridge and comprising AIB at position 16 and/or 20 were also made as essentially described above.

More specifically, mt-242, mt-248, mt-249, mt-250, mt-252, mt-255, mt-258, and mt-259 exhibited activities of glucagon/GLP-1/GIP triagonists, whereas mt-251 exhibited activity of a GLP-1/GIP co-agonist. Peptide mt-252, which had a Lys at position 16 and an AIB at \nposition\n 20, exhibited potency at the glucagon and GLP-1 receptors and exhibited an enhanced activity at the GIP receptor.\n\n\n \nExample 25\n\n\n \n \n \nLinear peptides lacking a lactam ring and comprising a Lys or similar residue at position 16 and AIB at \nposition\n 20 were made as essentially described above. The peptides had the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NOs: 99-141, 144-164, and 166. The peptides were tested in vitro for biological activity at the glucagon, GLP-1, and GIP receptors as essentially described in Example 16.

More specifically, all of mt-252, mt-255, mt-257, mt-260, mt-261, mt-262, mt-265, mt-266, mt-267, mt-275, mt-276, mt-277, mt-278, mt-279, mt-280, mt-286, mt-287, mt-288, mt-289, mt-290, mt-291, mt-292, mt-293, mt-295, mt-296, mt-297, mt-299, mt-306, mt-307, mt-310, mt-323, mt-324, and mt-345 exhibited activity at the GIP, GLP-1, and glucagon receptors, while the other peptides of Table 3 exhibited activity at the GIP and GLP-1 receptors (except for mt-285, which exhibited activity at only the GIP receptor, and mt-325, which exhibited activity at the glucagon and GIP receptors, but not at the GLP-1 receptor).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen comparing the data for mt-252, which comprised a C-terminal extension, to the data of mt-257, mt-258, and mt-259, which peptides did not comprise a C-terminal extension, it was apparent that the C-terminal extension enhanced the activities at all of the glucagon, GLP-1, and GIP receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen comparing the data for mt-252, which comprised a Lys at position 16, to the data of mt-275 and mt-276, which peptides comprised an Orn and a Dab residue at position 16, respectively, it was apparent that the Lys could be replaced with a Lys-like residue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, when comparing the data of mt-252, which comprises a Gln at \nposition\n 3, to the data of mt-256 and mt-274, which peptides comprise a Glu at \nposition\n 3, it becomes apparent that the substitution of Gln at \nposition\n 3 with a Glu residue achieved selectivity for the GLP-1 and GIP receptors over the glucagon receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effect of acylation with C14, C16, and C18 fatty acids was evident from the data of mt-260 to mt-263 and mt-265 to mt-272. From these data, it was apparent that acylation with C16 and C18 fatty acids provided increased activity at the GLP-1 and GIP receptors. The acylation of these peptides even allowed for increased activity at the glucagon receptor even though the peptides comprised a Gln3Glu substitution. The increased activity at the glucagon receptor could also be seen from the data of the triagonists mt-277 to mt-280.\n\n\n \nExample 26\n\n\n \n \n \nThe in vivo activities of a pegylated, cyclic, lactam-containing peptide, mt-178 (SEQ ID NO: 75), and a pegylated, linear peptide lacking a lactam, mt-274 (SEQ ID NO: 99), were tested in DIO mice, and compared to the in vivo activity of a pure GLP-1 agonist control having a GLP-1-based structure of SEQ ID NO: 179. Peptides or a vehicle control were intraperitoneally injected into the mice on \nDay\n 0 at 1, 3, or 10 nmol/kg/week.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA 1-hour glucose tolerance test (GTT) was performed on the mice by intraperitoneally injecting a 25% (w/v) glucose saline solution into the mice one hour after injection with one of the peptides or vehicle control. The glucose saline solution was administered to the mice at a dose of 1.5 g per kg of mouse body weight. Blood glucose levels were measured at the time of injection of peptide or vehicle control (−60 min), at the time of glucose saline solution injection (0 min), or at 15, 30, 60, or 120 min post injection with the glucose saline solution. The results of the 1-hour GTT are shown in \nFIG. 7\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA 24-hour GTT also was performed on the mice in the same manner as the 1-hour GTT, except that the glucose saline solution was administered to the mice 24 hours after injection with the peptide or vehicle control. The results of the 24-hour GTT are showri in \nFIG. 8\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe total blood glucose levels of each mouse were measured 0 and 7 days after injection with peptide or vehicle control and are shown in \nFIG. 9\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, the body weight of each mouse was measured at 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 days after injection with peptide or vehicle control. The % change in body weight of the mice are shown in \nFIG. 10\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFIG. 10\n, mice injected with mt-178 and mt-274 at either the 3 or 10 nmol/kg/week dose lost weight to the same or greater extent of mice injected with the GLP-agonist control peptide (at a 10 nmol/kg/week dose).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFIGS. 7 and 8\n, mice injected with mt-178, mt-274, or the GLP-1 agonist control exhibited decreased levels of blood glucose, as compared to mice injected with the vehicle control. The potency of mt-178 and mt-274 appeared to be greater than that of the GLP-1 agonist control peptide, as mt-178 and mt-274 at 3 nmol/kg/week achieved the same effect of the GLP-1 agonist control peptide at the 10 nmol/kg/week dose. mt-274 appeared to have the highest potency as this peptide at a 1 nmol/kg/week dose achieved similar results as the GLP-1 agonist control peptide at 10 nmol/kg/week.\n\n\n \nExample 27\n\n\n \n \n \nThe same peptides described in Example 26 were tested again in mice, except that higher doses (either 10 or 35 nmol/kg/week) of the peptides were subcutaneously injected into the mice. Two additional peptides were also tested at these doses: one peptide having the same structure as mt-178 but comprising a PEG group attached to the Cys at \nposition\n 40 via a more stable thioether linkage (—SCH2CO—) formed by nucleophilic substitution as opposed to a traditional thioether linkage formed by malenimide PEG via Michael addition as found in mt-178) and a second peptide having the same structure as mt-274 but comprising a PEG group attached to the Cys at \nposition\n 40 via the thioether linkage (—SCH2CO—) formed by nucleophilic substitution. These peptides are referred to herein as mt-178(TE) and mt-274(TE), respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe total blood glucose levels of the mice were measured 0 and 7 days after injection with peptide or vehicle control and are shown in \nFIG. 11\n. The total changes in blood glucose of the mice was measured 7 days after injection with peptide or vehicle control and are shown in \nFIG. 12\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe body weight of each mouse was measured at 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 days after injection with peptide or vehicle control. The % changes in body weight of the mice as a function of time are shown in \nFIG. 13\n, while the total changes in body weight of the mice as measured 7 days after injection with peptide or vehicle control are shown in \nFIG. 14\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFIG. 12\n, the total change in blood glucose decreased in all mice injected with any of the tested peptides, as compared to the mice injected with vehicle control. The most dramatic changes in blood glucose were seen in mice injected with 35 nmol/kg/week of mt-274 or mt-178(TE).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFIG. 14\n, the total change in body weight decreased in all mice injected with any of the tested peptides, as compared to the mice injected with vehicle control. Like the total change in blood glucose, the most dramatic changes in body weight were observed in mice injected with 35 nmol/kg/week of mt-274 or mt-178(TE).\n\n\n \nExample 28\n\n\n \n \n \nThe in vivo activities of the peptides described in Example 26 were compared to the in vivo activities of acylated versions of the linear mt-274 peptide. More specifically, three acylated versions of mt-274 in which the C-terminal amino acid (a Lys residue) was covalently attached to a C16 fatty acyl group, a C14 fatty acyl group, or a C18 fatty acyl group were made and tested. These peptides are referred to herein as mt-298, mt-309, and mt-310, respectively. Like the parent peptide, mt-274, the acylated peptides also comprised a 40 kDa PEG group. However, the PEG group of the acylated peptides was covalently attached to the side chain of a Cys residue at position 24 of the peptides. The amino acid sequences of the acylated peptides mt-298, mt-309, and mt-310 are provided herein as SEQ ID NOs: 101-103, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA non-acylated version of mt-298, mt-209, and mt-310 (hereinafter referred to as mt-311) was made and tested. Peptide mt-311 differed from mt-274 in that mt-311 was covalently attached to a PEG group through the side chain of a Cys residue at position 24 (as opposed to a Cys residue at the C-terminus as found in mt-274) and the C-terminal residue of mt-311 was a Lys residue, not a Cys residue, as found in mt-274.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptides or a vehicle control were subcutaneously injected into DIO mice on \nDay\n 0 at 10 nmol/kg for one week.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe blood glucose levels of the mice were measured 0 and 7 days after injection with peptide or vehicle control and are shown in \nFIG. 15\n. The body weight of each mouse was measured at 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 days after injection with peptide or vehicle control. The % changes in body weight of the mice as a function of time are shown in \nFIG. 16\n, while the total changes in body weight of the mice as measured 7 days after injection with peptide or vehicle control are shown in \nFIG. 17\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFIG. 17\n, mice injected with any of the peptides exhibited a decrease in body weight as compared to mice injected with vehicle control. Mice injected with the pegylated, cyclic, lactam-containing peptide (mt-178) demonstrated the greatest loss of \nbody weight\n 7 days after injection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFIG. 15\n, the blood glucose levels of mice injected with mt-178, mt-274, mt-311, or C14 or C16 acylated versions thereof decreased. Acylation with a C18 fatty acyl group did not appear to cause a decrease in blood glucose levels, suggesting that the size of the acyl group may be important for glucose lowering effects of the peptides.\n\n\n \nExample 29\n\n\n \n \n \nLinear glucagon-based peptides lacking a lactam that were acylated but not pegylated were made as essentially described above. Specifically, mt-260 comprising a C14 fatty acyl group on the C-terminal amino acid (SEQ ID NO: 104), mt-261 comprising a C16 fatty acyl group on the C-terminal amino acid (SEQ ID NO: 105) and mt-262 comprising a C18 fatty acyl group on the C-terminal amino acid (SEQ ID NO: 106) were made. The structures of each of these peptides were similar to those of mt-298, mt-309, and mt-310, but differed in that mt-260, mt-261, and mt-262 comprised an Asn residue in place of a pegylated Cys residue at position 24.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptides, mt-260, mt-261, or mt-262, a control peptide (Liraglutide, an acylated GLP-1 analog), or a vehicle control were injected QD into mice at a dose of 25 or 125 nmol/kg for 7 days.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe blood glucose levels of the mice were measured 0 and 7 days after injection with peptide or vehicle control and are shown in \nFIG. 18\n. The body weight of each mouse was measured at 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 days after injection with peptide or vehicle control. The % changes in body weight of the mice as a function of time are shown in \nFIG. 19\n, while the total changes in body weight of the mice as measured 7 days after injection with peptide or vehicle control are shown in \nFIG. 20\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFIG. 18\n, the effects that the acylated, unpegylated, linear peptides (mt-260, mt-261, and mt-262) had on blood glucose levels were dramatic. At 25 nmol/kg, these peptides caused about a 50% decrease in blood glucose levels, and at the higher dose, the peptides caused a decrease in blood glucose levels that was greater than 50%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFIG. 19\n, each of the acylated, unpegylated, linear peptides (at either the low or high dose) caused a decrease in body weight which was more potent than the decrease in body weight achieved by Liraglutide at the low dose. Body weight continued to decrease over the course of the 7 days of the assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese results suggest that acylated, unpegylated linear glucagon-based peptides that are active at the GIP and GLP-1 receptors are able to dramatically decrease blood glucose levels and body weight, thereby indicating that these peptides can be used to treat metabolic disorders, including diabetes, and for treatment of obesity.\n\n\n \nExample 30\n\n\n \n \n \nThe linear glucagon-based peptide mt-261 (SEQ ID NO: 105) was tested at different doses in DIO mice (N=8 per group; average initial body weight=48 g). Mice were subcutaneously injected QD for one week with vehicle only, liraglutide (30 nmol/kg of body weight) or mt-261 (0.3, 1, 3, 10 or 30 nmol/kg of body weight).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe body weight of the mice was measured 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 days after the first injection. As shown in \nFIG. 21\n, injection with mt-261 or liraglutide caused weight loss in the mice. Peptide mt-261 exhibited a higher potency than liraglutide, as 3 nmol/kg mt-261 achieved essentially the same effect as 30 nmol/kg liraglutide (\nFIG. 21\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe fat mass of the mice were measured 7 days after the first injection by nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. As shown in \nFIG. 22\n, increasing doses of mt-261 generally correlated with decreasing fat mass. The fat mass of mice injected with 3 nmol/kg mt-261 was about the same as the fat mass of mice injected with 30 nmol/kg liraglutide, demonstrating the high potency of mt-261 in comparison to liraglutide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBlood glucose levels of the mice were measured 0 and 7 days after the first injection. As shown in \nFIG. 23\n, doses as low as 3 nmol/kg of mt-261 caused a significant decrease in blood glucose levels. Consistent with the results of the fat mass and body weight assays, the decrease in blood glucose levels of mice injected with 3 nmol/kg mt-261 was similar to the decrease of blood glucose levels of mice injected with 30 nmol/kg liraglutide, demonstrating the higher potency of mt-261 as compared to liraglutide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a separate experiment, the unacylated version of mt-261, namely, mt-263 (SEQ ID NO: 111) was tested in nine groups of C57BI/6 mice (8 mice per group) for its in vivo effects on body weight, food intake, blood glucose levels, and fat mass. The mice were 11 months old and had been on a diabetogenic diet for 9 months at the time of the study. The average body weight of the mice were 57 g. The mice were subcutaneously injected daily with 3, 10, or 30 nmol/kg mt-263 for one week. The control groups received either a vehicle control or Exendin-4 at 10 or 30 nmol/kg/day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo assess the in vivo effects on body weight, the body weight of the mice were measured on \n \n \n \n \nDay\n \n \n \n \n 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7, wherein \nDay\n 0 is the first day of injection. As shown in \nFIG. 24\n, injection of mt-263 at any of the three doses caused a steady decrease in body weight over the 7 day test period. The effect on body weight also appeared to be dose-dependent as the total change in body weight (shown in \nFIG. 25\n) increased upon increasing dose of mt-263 peptide. Further, as shown in \nFIG. 25\n, the total changes in body weight achieved by any of the three doses of mt-263 was substantially more than the total change in body weight achieved by injection with Exendin-4 (at either dose).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe in vivo effects on food intake, fat mass, and blood glucose were also determined. The total food intake and fat mass as measured on \nDay\n 7 of mice injected. with mt-263 were reduced as compared to vehicle control and Exendin-4. Further, the total changes in blood glucose levels (as measured on \nDay\n 7 compared to levels measured on Day 0) of mice injected with mt-263 were significantly reduced in comparison to mice injected with either vehicle control or Exendin-4 (\nFIG. 26\n). The peptide at a 10 nmol/kg dose appeared to be the optimal dose, achieving the greatest decrease in blood glucose levels (almost −80 mg/dL).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe in vivo effects on body weight, food intake, and blood glucose levels of peptide mt-263 also were compared to those of peptides mt-349 (SEQ ID NO: 262), mt-280, mt-356, and mt-357, and of a vehicle control. Mice were given 30 nmol/kg/day of one of the peptides for 1 week. All peptides were effective at reducing body weight in mice as compared to vehicle control.\n\n\n \nExample 31\n\n\n \n \n \nThe in vivo effects of the linear, acylated glucagon-based peptides mt-277, mt-278, and mt-279 were tested and compared to those of liraglutide. DIO mice (8 mice per group; average initial body weight=51.4 g) were subcutaneously injected daily for 1 week with a vehicle control or 10 nmol/kg of liraglutide, mt-277, mt-278, or mt-279.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe body weight of the mice was measured 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 days after the first injection. As shown in \nFIG. 27\n, injection with mt-277, mt-278, or mt-279 caused significant weight loss in the mice. All of these peptides further demonstrated a higher potency than liraglutide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBlood glucose levels of the mice were measured 0 and 7 days after the first injection. As shown in \nFIG. 28\n, each of mt-277, mt-278, and mt-279 caused a significant decrease in blood glucose levels, which decrease was much greater than that seen in mice injected with liraglutide.\n\n\n \nExample 32\n\n\n \n \n \nA GLP-1 receptor-active, glucagon-based analog was modified to comprise a C-terminal extension of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 95 and further modified to comprise a Lys at the C-terminus of SEQ ID NO: 95. The Lys residue which was located at \nposition\n 40 of the analog was acylated with a C14 fatty acyl group. This acylated analog was tested for in vitro activity at the glucagon, GLP-1, and GIP receptors as essentially described in Example 16. The in vitro activity was compared to that of the parent GLP-1 receptor-active, glucagon-based analog lacking the C-terminal extension and acylation at \nposition\n 40. The C-terminally extended, acylated analog demonstrated an approximate 15% increase of activity at the GIP receptor and an approximate 52% increase at the glucagon receptor. Activity at the GLP-1 receptor actually decreased when stimulated by the C-terminally extended, acylated analog. However, the activity was still greater than 100% of the activity achieved by native GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor.\n\n\n \nExample 33\n\n\n \n \n \nAcylated glucagon analog peptides (each of which comprised an amide in place of the C-terminal carboxylate) were synthesized as essentially described above. Peptides mt-358, mt-367, mt-368, and mt-369 were acylated monomers, whereas mt-354, mt-376, and mt-377 were acylated dimers, wherein each dimer comprised two monomers linked via C-terminal Cys residues. Peptides mt-367, mt-368, and mt-369 comprised a γGlu-γGlu dipeptide spacer for purposes of attaching the acyl group, whereas mt-358 was acylated in the absence of a spacer. Peptides mt-225, mt-227, and mt-294 were pegylated monomers that comprised a lactam bridge between the glutamic acid at position 16 and the lysine at \nposition\n 20. Peptides mt-225 and mt-227 comprised a dipeptide spacer for purposes of attaching the PEG, whereas mt-294 was acylated via a thioether made by a reaction with a haloacetyl.

Also, the activity at the GLP-1 receptor exhibited by mt-368 was dramatically enhanced as compared to that demonstrated by mt-358, and the activity at the GIP receptor of mt-368 was essentially maintained in comparison to mt-358, suggesting that acylation of a glucagon peptide via a spacer can increase the activity at the GLP-1 receptor, while maintaining robust activity at the GIP receptor. Acylation via a spacer at \nposition\n 10 of the glucagon analog appeared to be as good a position as \nposition\n 40 of the glucagon analog, since the relative activities at the GLP-1 and GIP receptors were about the same for mt-367 and mt-369.\n\n\n \nExample 34\n\n\n \n \n \nTwo acylated glucagon analog peptides having the same amino acid sequence but differing in the pegylation linker were made as essentially described herein: mt-331 (SEQ ID NO: 153) comprised a linkage to PEG of structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwhile mt-311 (SEQ ID NO: 100) comprised a linkage to PEG of structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe two peptides or a vehicle control were administered via subcutaneous injection QW for one week to multiple groups of DIO mice (6 mice per group; average body weight=64.6 g). The peptides were administered at a dose of either 10 or 35 nmol/kg.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe body weights of the mice were measured 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 days after administration of the peptides or the vehicle control. The body weight of the mice injected with the higher dose of either mt-311 or mt-331 steadily decreased over the course of the week. The total change in body weight (%) is shown in \nFIG. 29\n. As shown in this figure, the total change in body weight was greatest for the mice injected with mt-311.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe total food intake by each group of mice was also measured 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 days after administration of the peptides or the vehicle control. As shown in \nFIG. 30\n, the total food intake by the groups of mice injected with either dose of mt-311 or mt-331 was decreased, as compared to the mice injected with a vehicle control.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe blood glucose levels of each group of mice were measured 0 and 7 days after administration of the peptides or the vehicle control. The blood glucose levels of the mice decreased upon administration of the higher dose of either mt-311 or mt-331. As shown in \nFIG. 31\n, the decrease in blood glucose levels was greater in mice injected with 35 nmol/kg mt-331.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe fat mass of each group of mice were measured. Administration of the peptides did not appear to have an effect on the fat mass, however.\n\n\n \nExample 35\n\n\n \n \n \nThe in vivo effects of two peptides of the same amino acid sequence but differing by the absence of an acyl group attached to the Lys at position 40 (mt-331 (SEQ ID NO: 153)) or presence of a C14 fatty acyl group (mt-353 (SEQ ID NO: 166)) on body weight, food intake, blood glucose levels and fat mass were tested in 7 month old C57BI/6 mice. The mice were on a diabetogenic diet for 5 months and the average initial body weight was 53 g. The peptides or a vehicle control were administered to the mice by subcutaneous injection for one week at a dose of 0.1, 0.3, 3, or 10 nmol/kg.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBody weight was measured 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 days after administration of the peptide or vehicle control.

As shown in \nFIG. 33\n, the total food intake by the mice injected with 3 or 10 nmol/kg of either mt-331 or mt-353 was decreased in comparison to mice administered the vehicle control.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBlood glucose levels of the mice also were monitored. As shown in \nFIG. 34\n, mt-331 caused a decrease in blood glucose levels in a dose-dependent manner. The two doses of mt-353 additionally caused blood glucose levels to decrease. The fat mass levels were not significantly impacted by the administration of either peptide.\n\n\n \nExample 36\n\n\n \n \n \nThe in vivo effects of three acylated triagonist peptides, mt-277, mt-278, and mt-279, having the structure of SEQ ID NOs: 123, 124, and 125, respectively, on body weight, blood glucose levels, and food intake were tested in 8 groups of DIO mice (8 mice per group). The peptides had the same amino acid sequence but differed in the size of the fatty acyl group to which it was attached. Liraglutide at a concentration of 10 nM/kg was used as a control. The peptides or a vehicle control were administered by subcutaneous injection daily for one week.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe in vitro activities at the glucagon, GLP-1, and GIP receptors were tested and the % activity of each peptide relative to the native hormone is shown below in Table 5.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n% activity at the\n\n\n% activity at the\n\n\n% activity at the\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeptide\n\n\nGLP-1 receptor\n\n\nglucagon receptor\n\n\nGIP receptor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiraglutide\n\n\n138\n\n\n0.04\n\n\nn/a\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMt-277\n\n\n224\n\n\n235\n\n\n446\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMt-278\n\n\n460\n\n\n588\n\n\n846\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMt-279\n\n\n420\n\n\n733\n\n\n527\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe body weight of the mice was measured 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 days after administration of the peptides or the vehicle control. Over the course of the week, the body weight of the mice that were injected with one of the acylated triagonist peptides dramatically decreased, as compared to the vehicle control. As shown in \nFIG. 35\n, the total change in body weight (%) of the mice injected with one of the acylated triagonist peptides was approximately −15%, whereas Liraglutide achieved less than a 5% decrease in body weight.\n\n\n \nExample 37\n\n\n \n \n \nThe effect of dosing frequency on efficacy of a pegylated, acylated peptide (mt-309; SEQ ID NO: 102) and a non-pegylated, acylated peptide (mt-261; SEQ ID NO: 105) was tested in 7 groups of DIO mice (8 mice per group) having an average body weight of 58 g. The peptides were subcutaneously injected into the mice QD at a dose of 5 nmol/kg, every 2\nnd \nday at a dose of 10 nmol/kg, or QW at a dose of 30 nmol/kg. The study lasted for 6 days, such that each group of mice received 30 nmol/kg by the end of the study period. Body weight and blood glucose levels were measured 0 and 6 days after the first administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFIG. 36\n, the total change in body weight (%) of mice injected QW with mt-309 was approximately the same as the total change in body weight for mice injected QD with the same peptide. Also, as shown in \nFIG. 36\n, the total change in body weight of mice injected QD with mt-261 was about the same as the total change in body weight of mice injected every 2\nnd \nday with this peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe same trends in body weight could also be observed with blood glucose levels (\nFIG. 37\n): a QW injection of mt-309 achieved the same decrease in blood glucose levels as a QD injection of this peptide, and a QD injection of mt-261 achieved the same decrease in blood glucose levels as an every 2\nnd \nday injection of this peptide.\n\n\n \nExample 38\n\n\n \n \n \nThe effect on dosing frequency on efficacy was tested for an acylated glucagon agonist peptide, mt-261 (SEQ ID NO: 105) by subcutaneously injecting 8 groups of DIO mice (8 mice per group) having an initial body weight of 56 g with 5 nmol/kg daily, 10 nmol/kg every 2\nnd \nday, 15 nmol/kg every 3\nrd \nday, or 30 nmol/kg for one day, such that each group received a total dose of 30 nmol/kg per week. The mice were 8 months old and had been on a diabetogenic diet for 6 months. Body weight, food intake, blood glucose levels and fat mass of each group were measured. As shown in \nFIG. 38\n, the mice injected with the peptide every three days exhibited the greatest decrease in body weight. Interestingly, mice injected with the peptide daily and mice injected with the peptide every two days exhibited nearly the same decrease in body weight.\n\n\n \nExample 39\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following glucagon analog peptides having appreciable agonist activity at only the glucagon receptor and not the GIP receptor and comprising a backbone of Peptide J\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 240)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHS-X-GTFTSDYSKYLDTRRAAEFVAWL(Nle)DE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nor Peptide K\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(SEQ ID NO: 241)\n \n \n \n \n \nHS-X-GTFTSDYSKYLD(Aib)RRAADFVAWLMDE\n \n \n \n \n \n\nwith additional modification at \nposition\n 3 were made by solid-phase peptide synthesis as essentially described herein.

The average initial body weight of the mice was 57.6 g. The mice were approximately 10 months old and had been on a high fat diet for about 8 months.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe total change in body weight was measured on \nDay\n 7. All mice injected with a peptide of Table 8 demonstrated a decrease in body weight as compared to vehicle control. Mice that were injected with mt-369 demonstrated the greatest amount of weight loss (˜25% decrease), followed by mice that were injected with mt-368 (˜22% decrease) and mice that were injected with mt-384 (˜21% decrease). Mice that were injected with mt-367 or mt-385 exhibited a lower but still significant weight loss (mt-367: ˜18% decrease and mt-385: ˜15% decrease).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll references, including publications, patent applications, and patents, cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each reference were individually and specifically indicated to be incorporated by reference and were set forth in its entirety herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe use of the terms “a” and “an” and “the” and similar referents in the context of describing the invention (especially in the context of the following claims) are to be construed to cover both the singular and the plural, unless otherwise indicated herein or clearly contradicted by context.
