Also provided are methods of their use for the treatment of an HCV infection in a host in need thereof. \n\n\nBACKGROUND \n\n\n[0003] Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is known to cause at least 80% of posttransfusion hepatitis and a substantial proportion of sporadic acute hepatitis (Kuo et al, Science 1989, 244, 362-364; Thomas, Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2000, 25-41). Preliminary evidence also implicates HCV in many cases of \"idiopathic\" chronic hepatitis, \"cryptogenic\" cirrhosis, and probably hepatocellular carcinoma unrelated to other hepatitis viruses, such as hepatitis B virus (Di Besceglie et al, Scientific American, 1999, October, 80-85; Boyer et al., J. Hepatol. 2000, 52, 98-112). \n\n\n[0004] HCV is an enveloped virus containing a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 9.4 kb (Kato et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1990, 87, 9524- 9528; Kato, Acta Medica Okayama, 2001, 55, 133-159). The viral genome consists of a 5' untranslated region (UTR), a long open reading frame encoding a polyprotein precursor of approximately 3011 amino acids, and a short 3' UTR. The 5' UTR is the most highly conserved part of the HCV genome and is important for the initiation and control of \n\n\n polyprotein translation. Translation of the HCV genome is initiated by a cap-independent mechanism known as an internal ribosome entry. This mechanism involves the binding of ribosomes to an RNA sequence known as the internal ribosome entry site (IRES). An RNA pseudoknot structure has recently been determined to be an essential structural element of the HCV IRES. Viral structural proteins include a nucleocapsid core protein (C) and two \n\n envelope glycoproteins, El and E2. HCV also encodes two proteinases, a zinc-dependent metalloproteinase encoded by the NS2-NS3 region and a serine proteinase encoded in the NS3 region. These proteinases are required for cleavage of specific regions of the precursor polyprotein into mature peptides. The carboxyl half of nonstructural protein 5, NS5B, contains the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The function of the remaining nonstructural proteins, NS4A and NS4B, and that of NS5A (the amino-terminal half of nonstructural protein 5) remain unknown. \n\n\n[0005] Presently, the most effective HCV therapy employs a combination of alpha- interferon and ribavirin, leading to sustained efficacy in about 40% of patients (Poynard et al., Lancet 1998, 352, 1426-1432). Recent clinical results demonstrate that pegylated alpha- interferon is superior to unmodified alpha-interferon as monotherapy. However, even with experimental therapeutic regimens involving combinations of pegylated alpha-interferon and ribavirin, a substantial fraction of patients do not have a sustained reduction in viral load (Manns et al, Lancet 2001, 358, 958-965; Fried et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 2002, 347, 975-982; Hadziyannis et al., Ann. Intern. Med. 2004, 140, 346-355). Thus, there is a clear and unmet need to develop effective therapeutics for treatment of HCV infection. \n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE \n\n\n[0006] Provided herein are macrocyclic serine protease inhibitor compounds, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds, and processes of preparation thereof.

This precursor polyprotein is then processed into a range of structural proteins, including core protein, C, and envelope glycoproteins, El and E2; and non-structural proteins, including NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5 A, and NS5B, by host signal peptidases and two viral proteases, NS2-3 and NS3. The NS3 protein contains a trypsin- like serine protease domain at its N-terminus, while its C-terminal domain has helicase activity. Because of its vital role in viral replication, HCV NS3 serine protease has been actively pursued as a drug target for developing a new anti-HCV therapy. \n\n\n[0049] Inhibitors of HCV NS3 protease that have been reported include linear and cyclic peptides and peptide mimetics, and non-peptide molecules (Llinas-Brunet et al. , Bioorg.

Where the compound provided herein contains an alkenyl or alkenylene group, the compound may exist as one or a mixture of geometric cisl trans (or Z/E) isomers. Where structural isomers are \n\n\ninterconvertible, the compound may exist as a single tautomer or a mixture of tautomers. This can take the form of proton tautomerism in the compound that contains, for example, an imino, keto, or oxime group; or so-called valence tautomerism in the compound that contain an aromatic moiety. It follows that a single compound may exhibit more than one type of isomerism. \n\n\n[00203] For example, the heterocyclic moiety that is fused with the macrocyclic ring in the compounds provided herein, including the compounds of Formulae Ia, Ib, Ha, lib, Ilia, \n\n\n- 76 -\n\n\nSDI-18153v2 \n\n IHb, IVa, IVb, Va, Vb, Via, VIb, Vila, VIIb, Villa, VIIIb, IXa, IXb, Xa, Xb, XIa, XIb, XIIa, XIIb, XIIIa, XIIIb, XIVa, XIVb, XVa, XVb, XVIa, XVIb, XIIa, XIIb, XIIIa, XIIIb, XIVa, and XIVb, contain three chiral centers as indicated by star symbols. As result, the heterocyclic moiety may exist in eight different stereoisomeric forms as shown below. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00204] The heterocyclic moiety of a particular configuration can readily be introduced by selecting a chiral starting material that will yield the desired chirality. \n\n\n[00205] The compounds provided herein may be enantiomerically pure, such as a single enantiomer or a single diastereomer, or be stereoisomeric mixtures, such as a mixture of enantiomers, e.g., a racemic mixture of two enantiomers; or a mixture of two or more diastereomers. As such, one of skill in the art will recognize that administration of a compound in its (R) form is equivalent, for compounds that undergo epimerization in vivo, to administration of the compound in its (S) form. Conventional techniques for the \n\n\npreparation/isolation of individual enantiomers include synthesis from a suitable optically pure precursor, asymmetric synthesis from achiral starting materials, or resolution of an enantiomeric mixture, for example, chiral chromatography, recrystallization, resolution, diastereomeric salt formation, or derivatization into diastereomeric adducts followed by separation. \n\n\n[00206] When the compound provided herein contains an acidic or basic moiety, it may also be provided as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt.

For an example, a compound of Formula I can be prepared as shown in Scheme 1. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ih \n\n\n[00211] A variety of R -L groups can be introduced at the hydroxyl position compound\n\n\nIa using various chemistries, such as coupling reactions to form ester, carbonate, or \n\n\n- 80 -\n\n\nSDI-18153v2 \n\n carbamate with the hydroxyl group, or nucleophilic substitution reactions to form ether, amine, or thioether. A nucleophilic substitution reaction to form an ether linkage is illustrated in Scheme 1. Compound Ia with a desired stereochemistry reacts with R\n6\n -L-V, where V is hydrogen or a metal ion or complex, with inversion of the stereochemistry at the position of the hydroxyl group to produce compound Ib. In the case of L is heteroatom, the reaction may be run under the Mitsunobu condition where V is hydrogen. Where L is a carbon atom moiety, the hydroxyl in compound Ia may be derivatized as a leaving group and reacted with R\n6\n-L-V, where V is a metal ion or complex. The carboxyl protecting group P\n1\n is then selectively removed to produce a free acid Ic, which is coupled with compound Id in the presence of a coupling reagent to form compound Ie. The carboxyl protecting group P\n2\n is removed to form a free acid If, which is coupled with compound Ig in the presence of a coupling reagent to compound Ih. Compound Ih is cyclized in the presence of a metathesis catalyst to form macrocyclic compound 1. Suitable examples of metathesis catalysts can also be found, e.g., in U.S. Pat. Provisional Pat. Appl. Serial Nos: 61/149,662, filed February 3, 2009; and 61/231,408, filed August 5, 2009; the disclosure of each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. \n\n\n[00212] The starting materials used in the synthesis of the compounds provided herein are either commercially available or can be readily prepared. Suitable examples of R\n6\n groups can be found, e.g., in International Pat. Appl. Publ. Nos. WO 2009/014730 and WO \n\n\n2009/082697; U.S. Pat. Appl. Serial No. 12/365,127, filed February 3, 2009; and U.S. \n\n\nProvisional Pat. Appl. Serial Nos. 61/167,847, filed April 8, 2009, and 61/231,600, filed August 5, 2009; the disclosure of each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. \n\n\nPharmaceutical Compositions \n\n\n[00213] Provided herein are pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound provided herein, e.g., a compound of Formula Ia or Ib, as an active ingredient, including an enantiomer, a mixture of enantiomers, a mixture of two or more diastereomers, a tautomer, a mixture of two or more tautomers, or an isotopic variant thereof; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, hydrate, or prodrug; in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle, carrier, diluent, or excipient, or a mixture thereof. \n\n\n[00214] Suitable excipients are well known to those skilled in the art, and non- limiting \n\n\n- 81 -\n\n\nSDI-18153v2 \n\n examples of suitable excipients are provided herein. Whether a particular excipient is suitable for incorporation into a pharmaceutical composition or dosage form depends on a variety of factors well known in the art, including, but not limited to, the method of administration. For example, oral dosage forms such as tablets may contain excipients not suited for use in parenteral dosage forms. The suitability of a particular excipient may also depend on the specific active ingredients in the dosage form. For example, the \n\n\ndecomposition of some active ingredients may be accelerated by some excipients such as lactose, or when exposed to water. Active ingredients that comprise primary or secondary amines are particularly susceptible to such accelerated decomposition. Consequently, provided herein are pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms that contain little, if any, lactose other mono- or di-saccharides. As used herein, the term \"lactose-free\" means that the amount of lactose present, if any, is insufficient to substantially increase the degradation rate of an active ingredient. In one embodiment, lactose-free compositions comprise an active ingredient provided herein, a binder/filler, and a lubricant. In another embodiment, lactose- free dosage forms comprise an active ingredient, microcrystalline cellulose, pre-gelatinized starch, and magnesium stearate. \n\n\n[00215] The compound provided herein may be administered alone, or in combination with one or more other compounds provided herein. The pharmaceutical compositions that comprise a compound provided herein, e.g., a compound of Formula Ia or Ib, can be formulated in various dosage forms for oral, parenteral, and topical administration. The pharmaceutical compositions can also be formulated as modified release dosage forms, including delayed-, extended-, prolonged-, sustained-, pulsatile-, controlled-, accelerated-, fast-, targeted-, programmed-release, and gastric retention dosage forms. These dosage forms can be prepared according to conventional methods and techniques known to those skilled in the art (see, Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, supra; Modified-Release Drug Delivery Technology, 2nd ed.; Rathbone et al, Eds.; Marcel Dekker, Inc.: New York, NY, 2008). \n\n\n[00216] In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions are provided in a dosage form for oral administration, which comprise a compound provided herein, e.g., a compound of Formula Ia or Ib, including an enantiomer, a mixture of enantiomers, a mixture of two or more diastereomers, a tautomer, a mixture of two or more tautomers, or an isotopic variant thereof; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, hydrate, or prodrug thereof; and one or \n\n\n- 82 -\n\n\nSDI-18153v2 \n\n more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients or carriers. \n\n\n[00217] In another embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions are provided in a dosage form for parenteral administration, which comprise a compound provided herein, e.g., a compound of Formula Ia or Ib, including an enantiomer, a mixture of enantiomers, a mixture of two or more diastereomers, a tautomer, a mixture of two or more tautomers, or an isotopic variant thereof; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, hydrate, or prodrug thereof; and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients or carriers. \n\n\n[00218] In yet another embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions are provided in a dosage form for topical administration, which comprise a compound provided herein, e.g., a compound of Formula Ia or Ib, including an enantiomer, a mixture of enantiomers, a mixture of two or more diastereomers, a tautomer, a mixture of two or more tautomers, or an isotopic variant thereof; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, hydrate, or prodrug thereof; and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients or carriers. \n\n\n[00219] The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein can be provided in a unit- dosage form or multiple-dosage form. A unit-dosage form, as used herein, refers to physically discrete a unit suitable for administration to a human and animal subject, and packaged individually as is known in the art. Each unit-dose contains a predetermined quantity of an active ingredient(s) sufficient to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with the required pharmaceutical carriers or excipients. Examples of a unit- dosage form include an ampoule, syringe, and individually packaged tablet and capsule. For example, a 100 mg unit dose contains about 100 mg of an active ingredient in a packaged tablet or capsule. A unit-dosage form may be administered in fractions or multiples thereof. A multiple-dosage form is a plurality of identical unit-dosage forms packaged in a single container to be administered in segregated unit-dosage form. Examples of a multiple-dosage form include a vial, bottle of tablets or capsules, or bottle of pints or gallons. \n\n\n[00220] The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein can be administered at once, or multiple times at intervals of time. It is understood that the precise dosage and duration of treatment may vary with the age, weight, and condition of the patient being treated, and may be determined empirically using known testing protocols or by extrapolation from in vivo or in vitro test or diagnostic data. It is further understood that for any particular individual, specific dosage regimens should be adjusted over time according to the individual \n\n\n- 83 -\n\n\nSDI-18153v2 \n\n need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the formulations. \n\n\nA.

The soft elastic capsule (SEC) is a soft, globular shell, such as a gelatin shell, which is plasticized by the addition of glycerin, sorbitol, or a similar polyol. The soft gelatin shells may contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms. Suitable preservatives are those as described herein, including methyl- and propyl-parabens, and sorbic acid. The liquid, semisolid, and solid dosage forms provided herein may be encapsulated in a capsule. Suitable liquid and semisolid dosage forms include solutions and suspensions in propylene carbonate, vegetable oils, or triglycerides. Capsules containing such solutions can be prepared as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,328,245; 4,409,239; and 4,410,545. The capsules may also be coated as known by those of skill in the art in order to modify or sustain dissolution of the active ingredient. \n\n\n[00231] The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein for oral administration can be provided in liquid and semisolid dosage forms, including emulsions, solutions, suspensions, elixirs, and syrups. An emulsion is a two-phase system, in which one liquid is dispersed in the form of small globules throughout another liquid, which can be oil-in- water or water-in-oil. Emulsions may include a pharmaceutically acceptable non-aqueous liquid or \n\n\n- 87 -\n\n\nSDI-18153v2 \n\n solvent, emulsifying agent, and preservative. Suspensions may include a pharmaceutically acceptable suspending agent and preservative.

Matrix Controlled Release Devices \n\n\n[00265] The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein in a modified release dosage form can be fabricated using a matrix controlled release device known to those skilled in the art. See, Takada et al. in Encyclopedia of Controlled Drug Delivery; Mathiowitz Ed.; Wiley: 1999; VoI 2. \n\n\n[00266] In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein in a modified release dosage form is formulated using an erodible matrix device, which is water- swellable, erodible, or soluble polymers, including, but not limited to, synthetic polymers, and naturally occurring polymers and derivatives, such as polysaccharides and proteins. \n\n\n[00267] Materials useful in forming an erodible matrix include, but are not limited to, chitin, chitosan, dextran, and pullulan; gum agar, gum arabic, gum karaya, locust bean gum, gum tragacanth, carrageenans, gum ghatti, guar gum, xanthan gum, and scleroglucan; \n\n\nstarches, such as dextrin and maltodextrin; hydrophilic colloids, such as pectin; phosphatides, such as lecithin; alginates; propylene glycol alginate; gelatin; collagen; cellulosics, such as ethyl cellulose (EC), methylethyl cellulose (MEC), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), CMEC, hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), cellulose acetate (CA), cellulose propionate (CP), cellulose butyrate (CB), cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB), CAP, CAT, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), HPMCP, HPMCAS, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose acetate trimellitate (HPMCAT), and ethyl hydroxyethyl cellulose (EHEC); \n\n\npolyvinyl pyrrolidone; polyvinyl alcohol; polyvinyl acetate; glycerol fatty acid esters; \n\n\npolyacrylamide; polyacrylic acid; copolymers of ethacrylic acid or methacrylic acid \n\n\n(EUDRAGIT\n®\n, Rohm America, Inc., Piscataway, NJ); poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate); polylactides; copolymers of L-glutamic acid and ethyl-L-glutamate; degradable lactic acid- glycolic acid copolymers; poly-D-(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid; and other acrylic acid derivatives, such as homopolymers and copolymers of butylmethacrylate, methyl \n\n\nmethacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, ethylacrylate, (2-dimethylaminoethyl)methacrylate, and (trimethylaminoethyl)methacrylate chloride . \n\n\n[00268] In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein are \n\n\n- 96 -\n\n\nSDI-18153v2 \n\n formulated with a non-erodible matrix device. The active ingredient(s) is dissolved or dispersed in an inert matrix and is released primarily by diffusion through the inert matrix once administered. Materials suitable for use as a non-erodible matrix device include, but are not limited to, insoluble plastics, such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyisoprene, polyisobutylene, polybutadiene, polymethylmethacrylate, polybutylmethacrylate, chlorinated polyethylene, polyvinylchloride, methyl acrylate -methyl methacrylate copolymers, ethylene- vinyl acetate copolymers, ethylene/propylene copolymers, ethylene/ethyl acrylate \n\n\ncopolymers, vinyl chloride copolymers with vinyl acetate, vinylidene chloride, ethylene and propylene, ionomer polyethylene terephthalate, butyl rubbers, epichlorohydrin rubbers, ethylene/vinyl alcohol copolymer, ethylene/vinyl acetate/vinyl alcohol terpolymer, ethylene/vinyloxyethanol copolymer, polyvinyl chloride, plasticized nylon, plasticized polyethylene terephthalate, natural rubber, silicone rubbers, polydimethylsiloxanes, and silicone carbonate copolymers; hydrophilic polymers, such as ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, crospovidone, and cross-linked partially hydrolyzed polyvinyl acetate; and fatty compounds, such as carnauba wax, microcrystalline wax, and triglycerides. \n\n\n[00269] In a matrix controlled release system, the desired release kinetics can be controlled, for example, via the polymer type employed, the polymer viscosity, the particle sizes of the polymer and/or the active ingredient(s), the ratio of the active ingredient(s) versus the polymer, and other excipients or carriers in the compositions. \n\n\n[00270] The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein in a modified release dosage form can be prepared by methods known to those skilled in the art, including direct compression, dry or wet granulation followed by compression, and melt-granulation followed by compression. \n\n\n2. Osmotic Controlled Release Devices \n\n\n[00271] The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein in a modified release dosage form can be fabricated using an osmotic controlled release device, including, but not limited to, one-chamber system, two-chamber system, asymmetric membrane technology (AMT), and extruding core system (ECS). In general, such devices have at least two components: (a) a core which contains an active ingredient; and (b) a semipermeable membrane with at least one delivery port, which encapsulates the core. The semipermeable membrane controls the influx of water to the core from an aqueous environment of use so as \n\n\n- 97 -\n\n\nSDI-18153v2 \n\n to cause drug release by extrusion through the delivery port(s). \n\n\n[00272] In addition to the active ingredient(s), the core of the osmotic device optionally includes an osmotic agent, which creates a driving force for transport of water from the environment of use into the core of the device. One class of osmotic agents is water-swellable hydrophilic polymers, which are also referred to as \"osmopolymers\" and \"hydrogels.\" Suitable water-swellable hydrophilic polymers as osmotic agents include, but are not limited to, hydrophilic vinyl and acrylic polymers, polysaccharides such as calcium alginate, polyethylene oxide (PEO), polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylene glycol (PPG), poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate), poly(acrylic) acid, poly(methacrylic) acid, \n\n\npolyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), crosslinked PVP, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), PVA/PVP copolymers, PVA/PVP copolymers with hydrophobic monomers such as methyl methacrylate and vinyl acetate, hydrophilic polyurethanes containing large PEO blocks, sodium \n\n\ncroscarmellose, carrageenan, hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and carboxyethyl, cellulose (CEC), sodium alginate, polycarbophil, gelatin, xanthan gum, and sodium starch glycolate. \n\n\n[00273] The other class of osmotic agents is osmogens, which are capable of imbibing water to affect an osmotic pressure gradient across the barrier of the surrounding coating. Suitable osmogens include, but are not limited to, inorganic salts, such as magnesium sulfate, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, sodium chloride, lithium chloride, potassium sulfate, potassium phosphates, sodium carbonate, sodium sulfite, lithium sulfate, potassium chloride, and sodium sulfate; sugars, such as dextrose, fructose, glucose, inositol, lactose, maltose, mannitol, raffϊnose, sorbitol, sucrose, trehalose, and xylitol; organic acids, such as ascorbic acid, benzoic acid, fumaric acid, citric acid, maleic acid, sebacic acid, sorbic acid, adipic acid, edetic acid, glutamic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, succinic acid, and tartaric acid; urea; and mixtures thereof. \n\n\n[00274] Osmotic agents of different dissolution rates can be employed to influence how rapidly the active ingredient(s) is initially delivered from the dosage form. For example, amorphous sugars, such as MANNOGEM EZ (SPI Pharma, Lewes, DE) can be used to provide faster delivery during the first couple of hours to promptly produce the desired therapeutic effect, and gradually and continually release of the remaining amount to maintain the desired level of therapeutic or prophylactic effect over an extended period of time. In this \n\n\n- 98 -\n\n\nSDI-18153v2 \n\n case, the active ingredient(s) is released at such a rate to replace the amount of the active ingredient metabolized and excreted. \n\n\n[00275] The core can also include a wide variety of other excipients and carriers as described herein to enhance the performance of the dosage form or to promote stability or processing. \n\n\n[00276] Materials useful in forming the semipermeable membrane include various grades of acrylics, vinyls, ethers, polyamides, polyesters, and cellulosic derivatives that are water-permeable and water-insoluble at physiologically relevant pHs, or are susceptible to being rendered water-insoluble by chemical alteration, such as crosslinking. Examples of suitable polymers useful in forming the coating, include plasticized, unplasticized, and reinforced cellulose acetate (CA), cellulose diacetate, cellulose triacetate, CA propionate, cellulose nitrate, cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB), CA ethyl carbamate, CAP, CA methyl carbamate, CA succinate, cellulose acetate trimellitate (CAT), CA dimethylaminoacetate, CA ethyl carbonate, CA chloroacetate, CA ethyl oxalate, CA methyl sulfonate, CA butyl sulfonate, CA p-toluene sulfonate, agar acetate, amylose triacetate, beta glucan acetate, beta glucan triacetate, acetaldehyde dimethyl acetate, triacetate of locust bean gum, hydroxylated ethylene-vinylacetate, EC, PEG, PPG, PEG/PPG copolymers, PVP, HEC, HPC, CMC, CMEC, HPMC, HPMCP, HPMCAS, HPMCAT, poly(acrylic) acids and esters and poly- (methacrylic) acids and esters and copolymers thereof, starch, dextran, dextrin, chitosan, collagen, gelatin, polyalkenes, polyethers, polysulfones, polyethersulfones, polystyrenes, polyvinyl halides, polyvinyl esters and ethers, natural waxes, and synthetic waxes. \n\n\n[00277] Semipermeable membrane can also be a hydrophobic microporous membrane, wherein the pores are substantially filled with a gas and are not wetted by the aqueous medium but are permeable to water vapor, as disclosed in U.S. Pat.

The dose or sub-doses can be administered in the form of dosage units containing from about 0.1 to about 1,000 milligram, from about 0.1 to about 500 milligrams, or from 0.5 about to about 100 milligram active ingredient(s) per dosage unit, and if the condition of the patient requires, the dose can, by way of alternative, be administered as a continuous infusion. \n\n\n[00306] In certain embodiments, an appropriate dosage level is about 0.01 to about 100 mg per kg patient body weight per day (mg/kg per day), about 0.01 to about 50 mg/kg per day, about 0.01 to about 25 mg/kg per day, or about 0.05 to about 10 mg/kg per day, which may be administered in single or multiple doses. A suitable dosage level may be about 0.01 to about 100 mg/kg per day, about 0.05 to about 50 mg/kg per day, or about 0.1 to about 10 mg/kg per day. Within this range the dosage may be about 0.01 to about 0.1, about 0.1 to about 1.0, about 1.0 to about 10, or about 10 to about 50 mg/kg per day. \n\n\nCombination Therapy \n\n\n[00307] The compounds provided herein may also be combined or used in \n\n\ncombination with other therapeutic agents useful in the treatment and/or prevention of an HCV infection. \n\n\n[00308] As used herein, the term \"in combination\" includes the use of more than one therapy (e.g., one or more prophylactic and/or therapeutic agents). However, the use of the \n\n\n- 106 -\n\n\nSDI-18153v2 \n\n term \"in combination\" does not restrict the order in which therapies (e.g., prophylactic and/or therapeutic agents) are administered to a subject with a disease or disorder. A first therapy (e.g. , a prophylactic or therapeutic agent such as a compound provided herein) can be administered prior to (e.g., 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 96 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 5 weeks, 6 weeks, 8 weeks, or 12 weeks before), concomitantly with, or subsequent to (e.g., 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 96 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 5 weeks, 6 weeks, 8 weeks, or 12 weeks after) the administration of a second therapy (e.g., a \n\n\nprophylactic or therapeutic agent) to the subject. Triple therapy is also contemplated herein. \n\n\n[00309] As used herein, the term \"synergistic\" includes a combination of a compound provided herein and another therapy (e.g. , a prophylactic or therapeutic agent) which has been or is currently being used to prevent, treat, or manage a condition, disorder, or disease, which is more effective than the additive effects of the therapies. A synergistic effect of a combination of therapies (e.g., a combination of prophylactic or therapeutic agents) permits the use of lower dosages of one or more of the therapies and/or less frequent administration of said therapies to a subject with a condition, disorder, or disease. The ability to utilize lower dosages of a therapy (e.g., a prophylactic or therapeutic agent) and/or to administer said therapy less frequently reduces the toxicity associated with the administration of said therapy to a subject without reducing the efficacy of said therapy in the prevention, treatment, or management of a condition, disorder, or disease). In addition, a synergistic effect can result in improved efficacy of agents in the prevention, treatment, or management of a condition, disorder, or disease. Finally, a synergistic effect of a combination of therapies (e.g., a combination of prophylactic or therapeutic agents) may avoid or reduce adverse or unwanted side effects associated with the use of either therapy alone. \n\n\n[00310] The compound provided herein can be administered in combination or alternation with another therapeutic agent, such as an anti-HCV agent. In combination therapy, effective dosages of two or more agents are administered together, whereas in alternation or sequential-step therapy, an effective dosage of each agent is administered serially or sequentially. The dosages given will depend on absorption, inactivation, and excretion rates of the drug as well as other factors known to those of skill in the art. It is to be noted that dosage values will also vary with the severity of the condition to be alleviated. \n\n\n- 107 -\n\n\nSDI-18153v2 \n\n It is to be further understood that for any particular subject, specific dosage regimens and schedules should be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the compositions. \n\n\n[00311] It has been recognized that drug-resistant variants of HCV can emerge after prolonged treatment with an antiviral agent. Drug resistance most typically occurs due to the mutation of a gene that encodes for an enzyme used in viral replication. The efficacy of a drug against the viral infection can be prolonged, augmented, or restored by administering the compound in combination or alternation with a second, and perhaps third, antiviral compound that induces a different mutation from that caused by the principle drug. Alternatively, the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, or other parameters of the drug can be altered by such combination or alternation therapy. In general, combination therapy is typically preferred over alternation therapy because it induces multiple simultaneous stresses on the virus. \n\n\n[00312] In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein further comprise a second antiviral agent as described herein. In certain embodiments, the compound provided herein is combined with one or more agents selected from the group consisting of an interferon, ribavirin, amantadine, an interleukin, a NS3 protease inhibitor, a cysteine protease inhibitor, a phenanthrenequinone, a thiazolidine, a benzanilide, a helicase inhibitor, a polymerase inhibitor, a nucleotide analogue, a gliotoxin, a cerulenin, an antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide, an inhibitor of IRES-dependent translation, and a ribozyme. In one embodiment, the second antiviral agent is an interferon. In another embodiment, the interferon is selected from the group consisting of pegylated interferon alpha 2a, interferon alfacon-1, natural interferon, ALBUFERON\n®\n, interferon beta- Ia, omega interferon, interferon alpha, interferon gamma, interferon tau, interferon delta, and interferon gamma- Ib. \n\n\n[00313] In certain embodiments, the compound provided herein is combined with a\n\n\nHCV protease inhibitor, including, but not limited to, Medivir HCV protease inhibitor (Medivir/Tibotec); ITMN-191 (InterMune); SCH 503034 (Schering); VX950 (Vertex); \n\n\nsubstrate-based NS3 protease inhibitors as disclosed in DE 19914474, WO 98/17679, WO 98/22496, WO 99/07734, and Attwood et al, Antiviral Chemistry and Chemotherapy 1999, 10, 259-273; non-substrate -based NS3 protease inhibitors, including 2,4,6-trihydroxy-3-nitro- benzamide derivatives (Sudo et al, Biochem.

(San Jose, CA) under conditions described by the supplier using 1.2 nM HCV NS3-NS4A protease, which was obtained according to Taremi et al. {Protein Science, 1998, 7, 2143-2149). The compounds were tested at a variety of concentrations in assay buffer containing a final DMSO concentration of 5%. Reactions were allowed to proceed for 60 min at room temperature and fluorescence measurements were recorded with a Tecan Infinity Spectrofluorimeter. The IC50 values were determined from the percent inhibition versus concentration data using a sigmoidal non-linear regression analysis based on four parameters with Tecan Magellan software. \n\n\nHCV Replicon Assay \n\n\n[00343] General procedure: Huh-7 cells containing HCV Conl subgenomic replicon\n\n\n(GS4.1 cells) were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 110 mg/L sodium pyruvate, IX nonessential amino acids, 100 U/mL penicillin- streptomycin, and 0.5 mg/mL G418 (Invitrogen). For dose-response testing, the cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 7.5 x 10\n3\n cells/well in a \n\n\n- 116 -\n\n\nSDI-18153v2 \n\n volume of 50 μL, and incubated at 37 °C/5% CO\n2\n. Three hours after plating, 50 μL often 2- fold serial dilutions of compounds (highest concentration, 75 μM) were added, and cell cultures were incubated at 37 °C/5% CO\n2\n in the presence of 0.5% DMSO. Alternatively, compounds were tested at a single concentration of 15 μM. In all cases, Huh-7 cells lacking the HCV replicon served as negative control. The cells were incubated in the presence of compounds for 72 hr after which they were monitored for expression of the NS4A protein by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). For this, the plates were then fixed for 1 min with acetone/methanol (1 :1, v/v), washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 0.1% Tween 20, blocked for 1 hr at room temperature with TNE buffer containing 10% FBS and then incubated for 2 hr at 37 \n0\nC with the anti-NS4A mouse monoclonal antibody A-236 (ViroGen) diluted in the same buffer. After washing three times with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, the cells were incubated 1 hr at 37 \n0\nC with anti-mouse immunoglobulin G- peroxidase conjugate in TNE, 10% FBS. After washing as described above, the reaction was developed with O-phenylenediamine (Zymed). The reaction was stopped after 30 min with 2 N H\n2\nSO\n4\n, and absorbance was read at 492 nm using Sunrise Tecan spectrophotometer. EC50 values were determined from the % inhibition versus concentration data using a sigmoidal nonlinear regression analysis based on four parameters with Tecan Magellan software. When screening at a single concentration, the results were expressed as % inhibition at 15 μM. \n\n\n[00344] For cytotoxicity evaluation, GS4.1 cells were treated with compounds as described above and cellular viability was monitored using the Cell Titer 96 AQ\nueO\nus One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega). CC\n50\n values were determined from the % cytotoxicity versus concentration data with Tecan Magellan software as described above. \n\n\n[00345] The biological results are summarized in Table 1, wherein A represents a value smaller than 1 μM, and B represents a value between 1 μM to 10 μM, C represents a value between 10 μM to 75 μM and D represents a value greater than 75 μM. \n\n\n- 117 -\n\n\nSDI-18153v2 \n\n TABLE 1 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Example 2 \n\n\n HCV Protease Assay \n\n\n [00346] General procedure: Measurement of the inhibitory effect of compounds on\n\n\nHCV protease activity was performed using the HiLyte Fluor™ TR/QXL™ 610 FRET peptide from AnaSpec, Inc. (San Jose, CA) under conditions developed in-house using 2-3 nM HCV NS3-NS4A protease, which was produced according to the method of Taremi et al. {Protein Science, 1998, 7, 2143-2149). The compounds were tested at a variety of concentrations in assay buffer containing a final DMSO concentration of 5%. Reactions were allowed to proceed for 60 min at 30° C and fluorescence measurements were recorded with a PerkinElmer Victor\n3\n V 1420 Multilabel Counter. The IC50 values were determined from the percent inhibition versus concentration data using a sigmoidal non-linear regression analysis based on four parameters with XLfit 4.1 software. \n\n\nLuciferase replicon assay \n\n\n [00347] General procedure: The HCV luciferase replicon assay measures the ability of a test compound to inhibit HCV replication in cell culture after 3 days of treatment in a human hepatoma cell line (Huh-7) bearing a HCV replicon containing a luciferase-neomycin phosphotransferase fusion gene. The inhibition of HCV replication was measured by quantification of luciferase protein expression. Briefly, Huh-7 cells containing either the HCV genotype Ia H77 strain or genotype Ib Conl strain subgenomic luciferase replicon (Hla-luc or Zluc, respectively) were grown in DMEM containing glucose, L-glutamine and sodium pyruvate, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 IU/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, 2 mM GlutaMAX, non-essential amino acids and 0.25 (Hla-luc) or 0.5 (Zluc) mg/mL G418. GlutaMAX was obtained from Invitrogen, Corp.; all other media reagents were obtained from Mediatech, Inc. For dose-response testing, the cells were seeded in 96- well plates at 1 x 10\n4\n (Hla-luc) or 7.5 x 10\n3\n (Zluc) cells/well in a volume of 50 μL, and incubated at 37 °C/5% CO\n2\n. Three hours after plating, 50 μL of ten 5-fold serial dilutions of compound were added, and cell cultures were incubated at 37 °C/5% CO\n2\n for 72 hours. In all \n\n\n- 118 -\n\n\nSDI-18153v2 \n\n cases, Huh-7 cells lacking the HCV replicon served as negative control. To assess luciferase expression, the media/compound was removed from the plates and ONE-glo Luciferase assay reagent (Promega) was added to each well. The assay plates were shaken for 3 minutes at room temperature and luciferase activity for each well was measured with a 1 sec read time on the Victor\n3\nV multilabel counter using a 700 nm cut-off filter (Perkin Elmer). EC50 values were calculated from dose response curves from the resulting best-fit equations determined by Microsoft Excel and XL fit 4.1 software. \n\n\n [00348] For cytotoxicity evaluation, Hla-luc or Zluc cells were treated with compounds as described above and cellular viability was monitored using the Cell Titer 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega). Plates were then read at 490 nm in a Victor\n3\n V 1420 multilabel counter (Perkin Elmer) and CC50 concentrations were determined using Microsoft Excel and XLfit 4.1 software. \n\n\n [00349] The table below presents data for compounds 51 and 52 A represents a value smaller than 1 μM, and B represents a value between 1 μM to 10 μM, C represents a value between 10 μM to 75 μM and D represents a value greater than 75 μM. \n\n\nTable 2 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 3 \n\n\n Genotype 2a infectious virus assay \n\n\n [00350] General procedure: The genotype 2a infectious virus assay measures the ability of a test compound to inhibit HCV replication in cell culture after 5 days of treatment at the time of HCV genotype 2a virus infection of a permissive human hepatoma cell line (HPC cells). The inhibition of HCV replication was measured by quantification of HCV core protein expression by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Briefly, HPC cells were grown in DMEM containing glucose, L-glutamine and sodium pyruvate, 10% FBS, 100 ILVmL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, 2 mM GlutaMAX, and non-essential amino acids. GlutaMAX was obtained from Invitrogen, Corp.; all other media reagents were \n\n\n- 119 -\n\n\nSDI-18153v2 \n\n obtained from Mediatech, Inc. For dose-response testing, ninety-six-well plates were seeded with HPC cells at a density of 2.5 x 10 cells/well in a volume of 50 μL, and incubated at 37 °C/5% CO\n2\n. Three hours after plating, 50 μL of ten 5-fold serial dilutions of compound and 100 μL of genotype 2a virus were added, and cell cultures were incubated at 37 °C/5% CO\n2\n. In all cases, mock infected HPC cells served as negative control. At 16 hours post treatment and infection, the virus inoculum was removed by aspiration. The cultures were treated at the same final concentrations of drug diluted in media and incubated for 4 additional days at 37°C/5% CO\n2\n. Subsequently, the core ELISA was performed as follows. The plates were fixed for 90 seconds with acetone/methanol (1 :1, v/v), washed three times with KPL wash solution (KPL, Inc.), blocked for 1 hr at room temperature with TNE buffer containing 10% FBS and then incubated for 2 hr at 37 \n0\nC with the anti-HCV core mouse monoclonal antibody (Thermo Scientific) diluted in the same buffer. After washing three times with KPL wash solution, the cells were incubated for 1 hr at 37 \n0\nC with an anti-mouse immunoglobulin G- peroxidase conjugate in TNE/10% FBS. After washing as described above, the reaction was developed with O-phenylenediamine (Invitrogen). The reaction was stopped after 30 min with 2 N H\n2\nSO\n4\n, and absorbance was read at 490 nm in a Victor\n3\nV 1420 multilabel counter (Perkin Elmer) and EC50 concentrations were determined using Microsoft Excel and XLfit 4.1 software. \n\n\n [00351] For cytotoxicity evaluation, HPC cells were treated with compounds as described above in the absence of the genotype 2a virus and cellular viability was monitored using the Cell Titer 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega). Plates were then read at 490 nm in a Victor\n3\n V 1420 multilabel counter (Perkin Elmer) and CC50 concentrations were determined using Microsoft Excel and XLfit 4.1 software. \n\n\n Example 4 \n\n\n In vitro CYP450 Inhibition Screen for Compound 51 and Compound 52 [00352] CYP 1A2 (BD Bioscience Cat#459500), CYP2B6 (BD Bioscience cat#459220), and CYP3A4 (BD Bioscience Cat#459100) inhibition fluorogenic assays were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Test articles were prepared as 10 mM stock solutions in DMSO. \n\n\n [00353] CYP2C8, 2C9, 2Cl 9 and 2D6 (BD Bioscience) inhibition luminogenic assay was performed as per the protocol provided by Promega (P450-Glo™ Assay Technical Bulletin #TB325, P450-Glo™ Screening Systems Technical Bulletin#TB340). Test articles were prepared as 10 mM stock solutions in DMSO. \n\n\n[00354] Data represent the average of two independent experiments. A represents \n\n\n- 120 -\n\n\nSDI-18153v\n2\n \n\n inhibition of 5 to 10%. B represents inhibition of >10% to 20%. C represents inhibition of >20% to 30%. D represents inhibition of >30% to 40 %.

The mutant replicons bear a specific single-site mutation in NS3 that is known to confer resistance to protease inhibitors currently in development. The inhibition of HCV replication was measured by quantification of luciferase protein expression. This assay has been validated using a panel of replicons bearing known protease inhibitor resistance mutations and their respective reference compounds. Briefly, subconfluent cured GS4.1 cells in OptiBuffer (ThermoElectron Corp.) were electroporated with 40 μg of wild-type or mutant luciferase-bearing HCV replicon RNA. The cells were then seeded in 96-well opaque white plates at 2.4xlO\n4\n cells/well in 150 μL/well and incubated for 4 hours at 37°C/5% CO\n2\n. Ten 1 :5 dilutions of each compound were made in Huh-7 media (DMEM containing glucose, L- glutamine and sodium pyruvate, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 ILVmL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, 2 mM GlutaMAX, and IX MEM non-essential amino acids [Mediatech, Inc. and Invitrogen Corp.]) at concentrations that were 4X higher than the final concentrations to be tested and 50 μL/well was added to the transfected cells. Untreated, mock-transfected \n\n\n- 121 -\n\n\nSDI-18153v2 \n\n cells served as a negative control of luciferase expression. The plates were incubated at 37°C/5% CO\n2\n for 4 days whereupon the media was removed and 50 μL of ONE-glo luciferase substrate (Promega) was added to each well. The plates were agitated on a rotating platform at room temperature for 3 minutes and read in a Victor\n3\nV microplate reader (Perkin- Elmer) using a 700 nm cut-off filter with a 1 second read time. EC50 values were calculated from dose response curves from the resulting best-fit equations determined by Microsoft Excel and XLfit 4.1 software. \n\n\n [00356] The table belw presents data for compound 51. A represents an EC50 (nM) of\n\n\n0.1 to 0.35. B represents an EC50 (nM) of >0.35 to 1.1. C represents an EC50 (nM) of 1.1> to 5. D represents an EC50 (nM) of >5 to 15. E represents an EC50 (nM) of >15 to 25. F represents an EC50 (nM) of >25 to 40. G represents an EC50 (nM) of >40 to 2000. H represents an EC50 (nM) of >2000 to 2750. \n\n\n Table 4 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 6 \n\n\n Generation of Recombinant JFH-I Virus Stocks \n\n\n[00357] The recombinant JFH-I HCV virus used in the HCV in vitro infection assay was generated by transfection of HPC cells with JFH-I RNA produced by in vitro \n\n\n transcription. The JFH-I DNA template was derived synthetically using sequence information derived from NCBI Accession # AB047639 (Wakita, et al, Nat. Med. 2005, 11 :791-796). Source: DNA2.0, Menlo Park, CA. \n\n\n[00358] The cDNA for the JFH-I HCV clone was synthesized by DNA2.0 and contains a T7 promoter to drive the transcription of the JFH-I genomic RNA. This plasmid was amplified using the Hi-Speed Plasmid Midi kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. \n\n\n[00359] Thirty micrograms of purified DNA was digested overnight at 37 \n0\nC with 300 \n\n\n- 122 -\n\n\nSDI-18153v2 \n\n U Xbal. The digested DNA served as a template for the in vitro transcription of the JFH-I genomic RNA using the MEGAScript T7 kit (Ambion) as instructed by the manufacturer. The JFH-I RNA product was resuspended to 1 μg/μL in RNA storage solution (Ambion). The quality of the JFH-I RNA was verified by agarose gel electrophoresis (1.2% E-gel) prior to electroporation. \n\n\n[00360] Complete growth media for Huh-7 and HPC cells (Huh-7 media) was prepared as follows: DMEM (containing glucose, L-glutamine and sodium pyruvate), 10% FBS, 100 IU/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, 2 mM GlutaMAX, 1% MEM non-essential amino acids. Subconfluent HPC cells were treated with trypsin-EDTA, collected with Huh-7 media, and centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 5 min at 4 \n0\nC in an Allegra 6R centrifuge (Beckman Coulter) in a 50 mL conical tube. The cells were then rinsed twice by resuspending the cells in 50 mL of PBS and centrifuging at 1,500 rpm for 5 min at 4 \n0\nC. \n\n\n[00361] JFH-I RNA was electroporated into HPC cells using a Thermo Scientific\n\n\nHybaid OptiBuffer kit (containing buffer A, solution B and compounds C and D). After washing, the HPC cells were resuspended in OptiBuffer buffer A at 1x10\n7\n cells/mL, and 400 μL (4x10\n6\n cells) was transferred to a 1.5 mL RNase-free micro fuge tube and gently centrifuged at 2,000 rpm in a Microfuge 18 (Beckman Coulter) centrifuge at room \n\n\ntemperature for 5 minutes. During this centrifugation step, the electroporation medium was prepared by mixing 2.5 mL of OptiBuffer solution B with 1 vial of OptiBuffer compound C (5.5 mg of ATP), 1 vial of OptiBuffer compound D (7.7 mg of glutathione) and 2.5 mL of autoclaved water. After aspirating the supernatant, the cell pellet was resuspended in 400 μL of electroporation medium. JFH-I RNA (8 μg) was added to the resuspended cells, whereupon they were transferred to a 0.4 cm cuvette and electroporated in a Bio-Rad GenePulser XCeIl electroporation module with a single pulse at 960 μf, 270 V and maximum resistance. A mock transfection, without RNA, was electroporated as a negative control. Growth media (600 μL) was immediately added to the cuvette. Cells were then transferred into a 15 mL conical tube containing 3.4 mL of Huh-7 media. Approximately 1.2x10\n5\n cells were seeded into each well of a Corning Costar 6-well plate and incubated at 37 \n0\nC with 5% CO\n2\n. \n\n\n[00362] When confluent, the trans fected HPC cells were trypsinized and split 1 :5 into new 6-well plates. At day 5 and 14 post transfection, conditioned media was collected from the cultures, cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 2,000 rpm for 10 min in a tab Ie -top \n\n\n- 123 -\n\n\nSDI-18153v2 \n\n centrifuge (Beckman Coulter Allegra 6R with GH3.8 rotor) and media was filtered through a 0.2 μm syringe-top filter. The transfected cells were also fixed for immunohistochemistry and lysed for immunob lotting analysis. \n\n\n[00363] The recombinant JFH-I HCV virus was amplified in a manner described by\n\n\n(Zhong, et al, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005, 102:9294-9299). HPC cells were split to 10% confluency in 225 cm\n2\n flasks and infected with 1 mL of the transfected cell culture media (described above) at 5 hrs post seeding. At 5 days post infection (pi.), the cultures were split 1 :2 into new 225 cm\n2\n flasks. One half the initial culture media was carried over into the split cultures to facilitate virus amplification. At 10 day p.i., conditioned media was collected from the 225 cm\n2\n flasks, centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 10 min in a table-top centrifuge and filtered through a MF75 sterilization filter (0.45 μm) bottle-top unit. Two milliliter aliquots of this virus stock were stored at -80 \n0\nC for future use. \n\n\nExample 7 \n\n\n HCV in vitro Infection Core ELISA Assay \n\n\n[00364] The HCV in vitro infection core ELISA assay measures the ability of a test compound to inhibit replication of an infectious HCV (strain JFH-I; genotype 2a) in cell culture. Recently, an in vitro infection model identified by Wakita et al. (Nat. Med. 2005, 11 :791-796) was found to replicate in retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-deficient or cluster of differentiation (CD)-81 -positive Huh-7 hepatoma cell lines. We have developed this model for determining the efficacy of antiviral compounds against an infectious virus in vitro using HCV producing cells (HPC), a proprietary Huh-7-derived cell sublineage capable of propagating the JFH-I HCV virus. The readout of the assay is quantification of HCV core protein by ELISA 5 days post infection with JFH-I virus and treatment with a test compound. \n\n\n[00365] Ninety- six-well Corning Costar plates were seeded with HPC cells at a density of 3.OxIO\n3\n cells per well in 50 μL of Huh-7 media. Compound stock solutions were made up freshly in Huh-7 media (DMEM (containing glucose, L-glutamine and sodium pyruvate), 10% FBS, 100 ILVmL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, 2 mM GlutaMAX, 1% MEM nonessential amino acids) as 2X stock. Seven additional 3-fold drug dilutions were prepared from the 2X stocks in Huh-7 media. At least 4 hours after HPC cells were seeded, the media in the 96-well culture plates was aspirated and 50 μL of each drug dilution and 50 μL of JFH- 1 HCV was added to each well. \n\n\n- 124 -\n\n\nSDI-18153v2 \n\n [00366] At 16 hrs post treatment and infection, the virus inoculum was removed by aspiration. The cultures were treated at the same final concentrations of drug diluted to IX in Huh-7 media to a final volume of 200 μL. Cells were incubated in the presence of drug for 4 additional days at 37°C/5% CO\n2\n. \n\n\n[00367] Media was removed from the plates by aspiration. Cells were fixed with 250 μL 1 : 1 acetone methanol for 90 seconds, washed once in PBS and then three times with IX KPL wash solution. The assay plates were then blocked with 150 μL/well 10% FBS-TNE (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5; Sigma), 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA with 10% FBS) for 1 hr at room temperature. Cells were washed three times with IX KPL wash solution and incubated with 100 μL/well anti-hepatitis C core mAb (1 mg/mL stock diluted 1 :500 in 10% FBS-TNE) for 2 hours at 37 \n0\nC. Cells were washed three times with IX KPL wash solution and incubated with 100 μL/well HRP-goat anti-mouse antibody (diluted 1 :2,500 in 10% FBS- TNE) for 1 hr at 37 \n0\nC. \n\n\n[00368] OPD solution was prepared using 1 OPD tablet + 12 mL citrate/phosphate buffer (16 mM citric acid, 27 mM Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n) plus 5 μL 30% H\n2\nO\n2\n per plate. Cells were washed three times with IX KPL wash solution and developed with 100 μL/well OPD solution for 30 minutes in the dark at room temperature. The reaction was stopped with 100 μL/well of 2N H\n2\nSO\n4\n, and absorbance measured at A490 nm in a Victor V 1420 multilabel counter (Perkin Elmer). The EC50 values for each compound were calculated from dose response curves from the resulting best- fit equations determined by Microsoft Excel and XLfit 4.1 software. The negative control for inhibition of virus replication was untreated HPC cells infected with the JFH-I HCV virus strain. The negative ELISA control was untreated, uninfected HPC cells. The positive ELISA control was untreated HPC cells infected the JFH-I HCV virus strain. \n\n\nExample 8 \n\n\n MTS Cytotoxicity Assay \n\n\n[00369] The cytotoxicity assay measures the viability of cells after treatment with a test compound for 5 days. The assay readout is the bioreduction of the yellow MTS tetrazolium compound to a purple formazan product. This conversion is mediated by NADPH or NADH and is directly proportional to the number of live cells in a culture. \n\n\n[00370] Ninety- six-well Corning Costar plates were seeded with HPC cells at a density \n\n\n- 125 -\n\n\nSDI-18153v\n2\n \n\n of 3.0x10 cells per well in 50 μL of Huh- 7 media. Compound stock solutions were made up freshly in Huh-7 media as 2X stocks. Seven additional 3-fold drug dilutions were prepared from the 2X stocks in Huh-7 media for a total of 8 dilutions. \n\n\n[00371] At least 4 hours after HPC cells were seeded, 50 μL of each drug dilution was added to the cultures. At 16 hrs post treatment, the existing media was removed by aspiration. Cultures were treated at the same final concentrations of drug diluted to IX in Huh-7 medium to a final volume of 100 μL. Cells were incubated for 4 additional days at 37°C/5% CO\n2\n in the presence of drug. \n\n\n[00372] After 5 days of treatment, the CellTiter 96\n®\n Aqueous One Solution cell proliferation assay was performed by adding 20 μL of MTS solution to each well. The plates were then incubated at 37°C/5% CO\n2\n for 3 hours. Plates were read at A490 nm in a Victor\n3\n V 1420 multilabel counter (Perkin Elmer) and CC\n50\n concentrations were determined using Microsoft Excel and XLfit 4.1 software. The positive control for cell death: culture wells containing only Huh-7 medium. The negative control for cell death: culture wells containing untreated, uninfected HPC cells. \n\n\nExample 9 \n\n\n HCV in vitro Infection Western Blotting Assay \n\n\n[00373] This assay measures the ability of a test compound to inhibit replication of the\n\n\nJFH-I HCV strain in cell culture. The readout of the assay is the quantification of HCV NS3 or core protein by western blotting 5 days post infection with JFH-I virus and drug treatment. Negative controls: untreated, uninfected HPC cells. Positive controls: untreated HPC cells infected the JFH-I HCV virus strain. \n\n\n[00374] Twenty-four-well Corning Costar plates were seeded with HPC cells at a density of 1.5xlO\n4\n cells per well in 0.8 mL of Huh-7 media (DMEM (containing glucose, L- glutamine and sodium pyruvate), 10% FBS, 100 ILVmL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, 2 mM GlutaMAX, 1% MEM non-essential amino acids). Compound stock solutions were made up freshly in Huh-7 media as 1OX stocks. Four additional 5-fold drug dilutions were prepared from the 1OX stocks in Huh-7 media for a total of 5 dilutions. \n\n\n[00375] At least 3 hrs after HPC cells were seeded, 100 μL of each drug dilution and\n\n\n100 μL of JFH-I HCV was added to each well. At 16 hrs post treatment and infection, the \n\n\n- 126 -\n\n\nSDI-18153v2 \n\n virus inoculum was removed by aspiration. The cultures were treated at the same final concentrations of drug diluted to IX in Huh-7 media to a final volume of 1 mL. Cells were incubated in the presence of drug for 4 additional days at 37°C/5% CO\n2\n. \n\n\n[00376] Media was removed from the plates by aspiration and the cells washed with 1 mL of PBS. After removing the PBS, 100 μL/well of SDS sample buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.5, 2% ultrapure SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromophenol blue, 0.1 M DTT) was added. The samples were collected into RNase-free microfuge tubes, incubated at 95 \n0\nC for 5-10 minutes and centrifuged at maximum speed for 2 min in an Eppendorf 5415D centrifuge. \n\n\n[00377] To prepare the Western Blot, fifteen microliters of each sample was loaded into each lane of a 4-20% Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gel in an XCeIl II Blot Module (Invitrogen); 6 μL of the SeeBluePlus2 prestained protein standard was also loaded into one lane. Each gel was run at 125 V for 1.5 hrs in Novex SDS (IX Tris/glycine/SDS) running buffer (Invitrogen). Each gel was transferred onto an iBlot nitrocellulose membrane using the iBlot apparatus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The membrane was rinsed in PBST (Sigma) and then blocked with 6 mL of blocking buffer (5% (w/v) nonfat milk in PBST solution) at room temperature for 1 hour with rocking. Each blot was incubated in 6 mL of blocking buffer containing HCV NS3 murine mAb (1 :500; ViroGen Corp.) and anti-GAPDH murine IgG Ab (1 :1,000,000; Calbiotech) or anti-core mAb (1 :500; Affinity BioReagents) overnight at 4°C with rocking. After 3 ten minute washes in PBST at room temperature with rocking each blot was incubated with 6 mL of blocking buffer (5% (w/v) nonfat milk in PBST solution) containing HRP conjugated donkey anti-mouse Ab (1 :5,000) for 1 hour at room temperature with rocking. Each blot was washed as described above and then exposed to 5 mL of substrate from the SuperSignal West Dura substrate kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The blots were then exposed using the Florochem 5,500 imager (Alpha Innotech). \n\n\n[00378] Virus replication was quantified by determining the band densities of NS3 and core proteins using ImageQuant 5.2 software. Background (the density determined within the NS3 or core region with mock-transfected cells) was subtracted from NS3, core, and GAPDH band densities. Each corrected NS3 or core value was then normalized to the corresponding corrected GAPDH value for the same sample. The EC50 value, which is the concentration of a test compound that reduced NS3 or core protein production by 50%, was determined for each compound using Microsoft Excel and XLfit 4.1 software. Each EC50 value \n\n\n- 127 -\n\n\nSDI-18153v2 \n\n determination was performed in duplicate. \n\n\nExample 10 \n\n\n Preparation of JV-methyl-ω-alkenyl-1 -amine tosylate salts 31\n\n\n H\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 31a: n = l \n\n\n 31b: n = 2 \n\n\n 31c: n = 3 \n\n\n[00379] The syntheses of JV-methyl-ω-alkenyl-1 -amine tosylate salts 31 are shown in Scheme 2. \n\n\n[00380] Step A: Preparation of 2,2,2-trifluoro-N-(hex-5-enyl)-N-methylacetamide\n\n\n31A. Sodium hydride (60% dispersion in mineral oil, 31.5 g, 1.28 eq.) was slowly added under nitrogen atmosphere to a solution of Λ/-methyl-2,2,2-trifluoroacetamide (100 g, 1.28 eq.) in DMF (500 mL) at 0 \n0\nC. The reaction mixture was stirred for 90 min at 0 \n0\nC, and then 6-bromo-l-hexene (100 g, 1 eq.) was added dropwise over 45 min.
