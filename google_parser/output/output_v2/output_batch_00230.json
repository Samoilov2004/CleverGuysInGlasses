Its ability to bind a wide range of therapeutic compounds used in psychiatry, coupled with its intriguing distribution in the brain has stimulated significant interest in new compounds which are capable of interacting with or affecting said receptor. At present, there are no known fully selective agonists. Significant efforts are being made to understand the possible role of the 5-HT6 receptor in psychiatry, cognitive dysfunction, motor function and control, memory, mood and the like. To that end, compounds which demonstrate a binding affinity for the 5-HT6 receptor are earnestly sought both as an aid in the study of the 5-HT6 receptor and as potential therapeutic agents in the treatment of central nervous system disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSurprisingly, it has now been found that 1-alkyl- or 1-arylsulfonyl-heterocyclylbenzazoles of formula I demonstrate 5-HT6 affinity along with significant sub-type selectivity. Advantageously, said formula I benzazoles are effective therapeutic agents for the treatment of central nervous system disorders associated with or affected by the 5-HT6 receptor. Accordingly, the present invention provides 1-alkyl- or 1-arylsulfonyl-heterocyclylbenzazole compounds of formula I\n\n \n \n\nwherein\n\nA is C, CR\n10\n or N;\n\nX is CR\n11\n or N;\n\nY is CR\n7\n or N with the proviso that when X is N, then Y must be CR\n7\n;\n\nR\n1\n is H, C\n1\n-C\n6\nalkylcarbonyl, C\n1\n-C\n6\nalkoxycarbonyl or a C\n1\n-C\n6\nalkyl, C\n2\n-C\n6\nalkenyl, C\n2\n-C\n6\nalkynyl or cycloheteroalkyl group each optionally substituted;\n\nR\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, R\n5\n and R\n6\n are each independently H, halogen, OH or an optionally substituted C\n1\n-C\n6\nalkyl group;\n\nR\n7\n and R\n11\n are each independently H, halogen or an C\n1\n-C\n6\nalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl or alkoxy group each optionally substituted;\n\nR\n8\n is an C\n1\n-C\n6\nalkyl, aryl or heteroaryl group each optionally substituted;\n\nR\n9\n is H, halogen or an C\n1\n-C\n6\nalkyl, C\n1\n-C\n6\nalkoxy, C\n2\n-C\n6\nalkenyl, aryl or heteroaryl group each optionally substituted;\n\nR\n10\n is H, OH or an optionally substituted alkoxy group;\n\nm is an integer of 1, 2 or 3;\n\nn is O or an integer of 1, 2 or 3; and\n\n\n----\n represents a single bond or a double bond; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used in the specification and claims, the term halogen designates Br, Cl, I or F; the term aryl designates phenyl or naphthyl.

Reaction of said formula Ia compound with a reagent R\n1\n-Hal, wherein R\n1\n is defined hereinabove for formula I and Hal is Cl, Br or I in the presence of a base gives compounds of formula Ib wherein R\n1\n is other than H. The reaction sequence is shown in flow diagram II.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nCorresponding compounds of the invention wherein A is CR\n10\n may be obtained, for example, by lithiating a protected 4-bromoindole of formula VI wherein G is benzyl, and displacing the lithium group with a cyclic ketone such as an N-protected-4-piperidone to give the hydroxy intermediate of formula VII, which may then be dehydrated and sulfonylated in the manner described hereinabove to give the protected compound of formula VIII. Catalytic hydrogenation and simultaneous deprotection of said formula VIII compound gives the desired compounds of formula I wherein \n----\n represents a single bond (formula Id).

Cultured Hela cells expressing human cloned 5-HT6 receptors are harvested and centrifuged at low .speed (1,000 x g) for 10.0 min to remove the culture media. The harvested cells are suspended in half volume of fresh physiological phosphate buffered saline solution and recentrifuged at the same speed. This operation is repeated. The collected cells are then homogenized in ten volumes of 50 mM Tris.HCl (pH 7.4) and 0.5 mM EDTA. The homogenate is centrifuged at 40,000 x g for 30.0 min and the precipitate is collected. The obtained pellet is resuspended in 10 volumes of Tris.HCl buffer and recentrifuged at the same speed. The final pellet is suspended in a small volume of Tris.HCl buffer and the tissue protein content is determined in aliquots of 10-25 µl volumes. Bovine Serum Albumin is used as the standard in the protein determination according to the method described in \nLowry et al., J. Biol. Chem., 193:265 (1951\n). The volume of the suspended cell membranes is adjusted to give a tissue protein concentration of 1.0 mg/ml of suspension. The prepared membrane suspension (10 times concentrated) is aliquoted in 1.0 ml volumes and stored at -70° C until used in subsequent binding experiments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBinding experiments are performed in a 96 well microtiter plate format, in a total volume of 200 µl. To each well is added the following mixture: 80.0 µl of incubation buffer made in 50 mM Tris.HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10.0 mM MgCl\n2\n and 0.5 mM EDTA and 20 µl of [\n3\nH]-LSD (S.A., 86.0 Ci/mmol, available from Amersham Life Science), 3.0 nM. The dissociation constant, K\nD\n of the [\n3\nH]LSD at the human serotonin 5-HT6 receptor is 2.9 nM, as determined by saturation binding with increasing concentrations of [\n3\nH]LSD. The reaction is initiated by the final addition of 100.0 µl of tissue suspension. Nonspecific binding is measured in the presence of 10.0 µM methiothepin. The test compounds are added in 20.0 µl volume.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe reaction is allowed to proceed in the dark for 120 min at room temperature, at which time, the bound ligand-receptor complex is filtered off on a 96 well unifilter with a Packard Filtermate\n®\n 196 Harvester. The bound complex caught on the filter disk is allowed to air dry and the radioactivity is measured in a Packard TopCount \n®\n equipped with six photomultiplier detectors, after the addition of 40.Oµl Microscint\n®\n-20 scintillant to each shallow well. The unifilter plate is heat-sealed and counted in a PackardTopCount\n®\n with a tritium efficiency of 31.0%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecific binding to the 5-HT6 receptor is defined as the total radioactivity bound less the amount bound in the presence of 10.0µM unlabeled methiothepin. Binding in the presence of varying concentrations of test compound is expressed as a percentage of specific binding in the absence of test compound. The results are plotted as log % bound versus log concentration of test compound. Nonlinear regression analysis of data points with a computer assisted program Prism\n®\n yielded both the IC\n50\n and the Ki values of test compounds with 95% confidence limits. A linear regression line of data points is plotted, from which the IC\n50\n value is determined and the K\ni\n value is determined based upon the following equation: \n \n \n \nK\n \ni\n \n \n=\n \n \nIC\n \n50\n \n \n/\n \n \n1\n \n+\n \nL\n \n/\n \n \nK\n \nD\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwhere L is the concentration of the radioactive ligand used and K\nD\n is the dissociation constant of the ligand for the receptor, both expressed in nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsing this assay, the following Ki values are determined and compared to those values obtained by representative compounds known to demonstrate binding to the 5-HT6 receptor.

Although two of the comparison compounds (clozapine and methiothepin) have similar 5-HT6 receptor affinity, they do not have the selectivity of the compounds of the present invention. The examples disclosed above demonstrate up to 50-fold selectivity for the 5-HT6 receptor when compared to their affinity at the 5-HT7 receptor."
