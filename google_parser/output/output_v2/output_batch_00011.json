The present invention also relates to the use of the compound or composition in therapy applications.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nEvidence suggests that oestrogens are the major mitogens involved in promoting the growth of tumours in endocrine-dependent tissues, such as the breast and endometrium. Although plasma oestrogen concentrations are similar in women with or without breast cancer, breast tumour oestrone and oestradiol levels are significantly higher than in normal breast tissue or blood. In situ synthesis of oestrogen is thought to make an important contribution to the high levels of oestrogens in tumours and therefore inhibitors, in particular specific inhibitors, of oestrogen biosynthesis are of potential value for the treatment of endocrine-dependent tumours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOver the past two decades, there has been considerable interest in the development of inhibitors of the aromatase pathway—which converts the androgen precursor androstenedione to oestrone. However, there is now evidence that the oestrone sulphatase (E1-STS) pathway, i.e. the hydrolysis of oestrone sulphate to oestrone (E1S to E1), and aromatase (i.e. conversion of androstenedione to oestrone) account for the production of oestrogens in breast tumours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIGS. 1 and 2\n are schematic diagrams showing some of the enzymes involved in the in situ synthesis of oestrone from oestrone sulphate, oestradiol and androstenedione.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn \nFIG. 2\n, which schematically shows the origin of oestrogenic steroids in postmenopausal women, “ER” denotes Oestrogen Receptor, “DHEA-S” denotes Dehydroepiandrosterone-Sulphate, “Adiol” denotes Androstenediol, “E1-STS” denotes Oestrone Sulphatase, “DHEA-STS” denotes DHEA-sulphatase, “Adiol-STS” denotes Adiol Sulphatase, and “17B-HSD” denotes \nOestradiol\n 17B-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs can be seen, the main two enzymes that are involved in the peripheral synthesis of oestrogens are the aromatase enzyme and the enzyme oestrone sulphatase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn short, the aromatase enzyme converts androstenedione, which is secreted in large amounts by the adrenal cortex, to oestrone. Recent reports have suggested that some flavones could inhibit aromatase activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMuch of the oestrone so formed, however, is converted to oestrone sulphate (EIS) and there is now a considerable body of evidence showing that E1S in plasma and tissue acts as a reservoir for the formation of oestrone by the action of oestrone sulphatase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn this regard, it is now believed that the oestrone sulphatase (E1-STS) pathway—i.e. the hydrolysis of oestrone sulphate to oestrone (E1S to E1) is a major source of oestrogen in breast tumours. This theory is supported by a modest reduction of plasma oestrogen concentration in postmenopausal women with breast cancer treated by aromatase inhibitors, such as aminoglutethimide and 4-hydroxyandrostenedione and also by the fact that plasma E1S concentration in these aromatase inhibitor-treated patients remains relatively high. The long half-life of E1S in blood (10-12 h) compared with the unconjugated oestrogens (20 min) and high levels of steroid sulphatase activity in liver and, normal and malignant breast tissues, also lend support to this theory.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, oestrogen formation in malignant breast and endometrial tissues via the sulphatase pathway makes a major contribution to the high concentration of oestrogens which are present in these tumours. However, inhibition of both the aromatase and sulphatase pathways could offer considerable therapeutic benefit.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPCT/GB92/01587 teaches novel steroid sulphatase inhibitors and pharmaceutical compositions containing them for use in the treatment of oestrone dependent tumours, especially breast cancer. These steroid sulphatase inhibitors are sulphamate esters, such as N,N-dimethyl oestrone-3-sulphamate and, preferably, oestrone-3-sulphamate (otherwise known as “EMATE”). EMATE has the following structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is known that EMATE is a potent E1-STS inhibitor as it displays more than 99% inhibition of E1-STS activity in intact MCF-7 cells at 0.1 nM. EMATE also inhibits the E1-STS enzyme in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, indicating that it acts as an active site-directed inactivator. Although EMATE was originally designed for the inhibition of E1-STS, it also inhibits dehydroepiandrosterone sulphatase (DHEA-STS), which is an enzyme that is believed to have a pivotal role in regulating the biosynthesis of the oestrogenic steroid androstenediol. Also, there is now evidence to suggest that androstenediol may be of even greater importance as a promoter of breast tumour growth. EMATE is also active in vivo as almost complete inhibition of rat liver E1-STS (99%) and DHEA-STS (99%) activities resulted when it is administered either orally or subcutaneously. In addition, EMATE has been shown to have a memory enhancing effect in rats. Studies in mice have suggested an association between DHEA-STS activity and the regulation of part of the immune response. It is thought that this may also occur in humans. The bridging O-atom of the sulphamate moiety in EMATE is important for inhibitory activity. Thus, when the 3-O-atom is replaced by other heteroatoms as in oestrone-3-N-sulphamate and oestrone-3-S-sulphamate, these analogues are weaker non-time-dependent inactivators.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to oestrone, the other major steroid with oestrogenic properties which is produced by postmenopausal women is androstenediol (see \nFIG. 2\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAndrostenediol, although an androgen, can bind to the oestrogen receptor (ER) and can stimulate the growth of ER positive breast cancer cells and the growth of carcinogen-induced mammary tumours in the rat. Importantly, in postmenopausal women 90% of the androstenediol produced originates from the androgen dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEA-S) which is secreted in large amounts by the adrenal cortex. DHEA-S is converted to DHEA by DHEA sulphatase, which may be the same as, or different from, the enzyme, oestrone sulphatase, which is responsible for the hydrolysis of E1S.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDuring the last 10-15 years considerable research has also been carried out to develop potent aromatase inhibitors, some of which are now marketed. However, in three recent reports of postmenopausal women with breast cancer who received aromatase inhibitor therapy, plasma E1S concentrations remained between 400-1000 pg/ml.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn summation therefore in situ synthesis of oestrogen is thought to make an important contribution to the high levels of oestrogens in tumours and therefore specific inhibitors of oestrogen biosynthesis are of potential value for the treatment of endocrine-dependent tumours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMoreover, even though oestrogen formation in malignant breast and endometrial tissues via the sulphatase pathway makes a major contribution to the high concentration of oestrogens, there are still other enzymatic pathways that contribute to in vivo synthesis of oestrogen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOur earlier application WO03/045925 teaches compounds which may act as inhibitors of both aromatase and sulphatase. Many of the compounds of the disclosure are found to be extremely potent inhibitors of both of these enzymes. However, there is a desire to provide alternative compounds or improved compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention seeks to provide novel compounds suitable for the inhibition of steroid sulphatase activity and aromatase activity.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY ASPECTS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention is based on the surprising finding that certain polycyclic compounds could be used as effective steroid sulphatase inhibitors and/or aromatase inhibitors and/or as agents that can influence cell cycling and/or as agents that can influence apoptosis.\n\n\n \nDETAILED ASPECTS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nAccording to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a compound of Formula I\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein X, Y and Z are each independently of each other an optional linker group; R\n1 \nis a ring system; R\n2 \nis selected from hydrocarbyl groups, oxyhydrocarbyl groups, cyano (—CN), nitro (—NO\n2\n) and halogens; R\n3 \nand R\n4 \nare independently selected from H and hydrocarbyl; and ring A and B are independently optionally further substituted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “hydrocarbyl group” as used herein means a group comprising at least C and H and may optionally comprise one or more other suitable substituents. Examples of such substituents may include halo, alkoxy, nitro, an alkyl group, a cyclic group etc. In addition to the possibility of the substituents being a cyclic group, a combination of substituents may form a cyclic group. If the hydrocarbyl group comprises more than one C then those carbons need not necessarily be linked to each other. For example, at least two of the carbons may be linked via a suitable element or group. Thus, the hydrocarbyl group may contain hetero atoms. Suitable hetero atoms will be apparent to those skilled in the art and include, for instance, sulphur, nitrogen and oxygen.

For example, the present invention covers novel alcohol precursors for the compounds. By way of further example, the present invention covers bis protected precursors for the compounds. Examples of each of these precursors are presented herein. The present invention also encompasses a process comprising each or both of those precursors for the synthesis of the compounds of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSteroid Sulphatase\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSteroid sulphatase—which is sometimes referred to as steroid sulphatase or steryl sulphatase or “STS” for short—hydrolyses several sulphated steroids, such as oestrone sulphate, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate and cholesterol sulphate. STS has been allocated the enzyme number EC 3.1.6.2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSTS has been cloned and expressed. For example see Stein et al (J. Biol. Chem. 264:13865-13872 (1989)) and Yen et al (Cell 49:443-454 (1987)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSTS is an enzyme that has been implicated in a number of disease conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy way of example, workers have found that a total deficiency in STS produces ichthyosis. According to some workers, STS deficiency is fairly prevalent in Japan. The same workers (Sakura et al, J Inherit Metab Dis 1997 November; 20(6):807-10) have also reported that allergic diseases—such as bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis, or atopic dermatitis—may be associated with a steroid sulphatase deficiency.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to disease states being brought on through a total lack of STS activity, an increased level of STS activity may also bring about disease conditions. By way of example, and as indicated above, there is strong evidence to support a role of STS in breast cancer growth and metastasis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSTS has also been implicated in other disease conditions. By way of example, Le Roy et al (Behav Genet 1999 March; 29(2):131-6) have determined that there may be a genetic correlation between steroid sulphatase concentration and initiation of attack behaviour in mice. The authors conclude that sulphatation of steroids may be the prime mover of a complex network, including genes shown to be implicated in aggression by mutagenesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSTS Inhibition\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is believed that some disease conditions associated with STS activity are due to conversion of a nonactive, sulphated oestrone to an active, nonsulphated oestrone. In disease conditions associated with STS activity, it would be desirable to inhibit STS activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHere, the term “inhibit” includes reduce and/or eliminate and/or mask and/or prevent the detrimental action of STS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSTS Inhibitor\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with the present invention, the compound of the present invention is capable of acting as an STS inhibitor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHere, the term “inhibitor” as used herein with respect to the compound of the present invention means a compound that can inhibit STS activity—such as reduce and/or eliminate and/or mask and/or prevent the detrimental action of STS. The STS inhibitor may act as an antagonist.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ability of compounds to inhibit oestrone sulphatase activity can be assessed using either intact JEG3 choriocarcinoma cells or placental microsomes. In addition, an animal model may be used. Details on suitable Assay Protocols are presented in following sections. It is to be noted that other assays could be used to determine STS activity and thus STS inhibition. For example, reference may also be made to the teachings of WO-A-99/50453.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, for some applications, the compound is further characterised by the feature that if the sulphamate group were to be substituted by a sulphate group to form a sulphate derivative, then the sulphate derivative would be hydrolysable by an enzyme having steroid sulphatase (E.C. 3.1.6.2) activity—i.e. when incubated with steroid sulphatase EC 3.1.6.2 at pH 7.4 and 37° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one preferred embodiment, if the sulphamate group of the compound were to be replaced with a sulphate group to form a sulphate compound then that sulphate compound would be hydrolysable by an enzyme having steroid sulphatase (E.C. 3.1.6.2) activity and would yield a Km value of less than 200 mmolar, preferably less than 150 mmolar, preferably less than 100 mmolar, preferably less than 75 mmolar, preferably less than 50 mmolar, when incubated with steroid sulphatase EC 3.1.6.2 at pH 7.4 and 37° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor some applications, preferably the compound of the present invention has at least about a 100 fold selectivity to a desired target (e.g. STS and/or aromatase), preferably at least about a 150 fold selectivity to the desired target, preferably at least about a 200 fold selectivity to the desired target, preferably at least about a 250 fold selectivity to the desired target, preferably at least about a 300 fold selectivity to the desired target, preferably at least about a 350 fold selectivity to the desired target.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is to be noted that the compound of the present invention may have other beneficial properties in addition to or in the alternative to its ability to inhibit STS and/or aromatase activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSulphamate Group\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “sulphamate” as used herein includes an ester of sulphamic acid, or an ester of an N-substituted derivative of sulphamic acid, or a salt thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf R\n3 \nis a sulphamate group then the compound of the present invention is referred to as a sulphamate compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypically, the sulphamate group has the formula:\n\n\n \n \n \n(R\n3\n)(R\n4\n)N—S(O)(O)—O—\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein preferably R\n3 \nand R\n4 \nare independently selected from H, alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, acyl and aryl, or combinations thereof, or together represent alkylene, wherein the or each alkyl or cycloalkyl or alkenyl or optionally contain one or more hetero atoms or groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen substituted, the N-substituted compounds of this invention may contain one or two N-alkyl, N-alkenyl, N-cycloalkyl or N-aryl substituents, preferably containing or each containing a maximum of 10 carbon atoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen R\n3 \nand/or R\n4 \nis hydrocarbyl, the preferred values are those where R\n3 \nand R\n4 \nare each independently selected C\n1\n-C\n10 \nhydrocarbyl, C\n1\n-C\n5 \nhydrocarbyl, C\n1\n-C\n3 \nhydrocarbyl, C\n1\n-C\n10 \nhydrocarbon, C\n1\n-C\n5 \nhydrocarbon, C\n1\n-C\n3 \nhydrocarbon, C\n1\n-C\n10 \nalkyl, C\n1\n-C\n5 \nalkyl and C\n1\n-C\n3 \nalkyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen R\n3 \nand/or R\n4 \nis alkyl, the preferred values are those where R\n3 \nand R\n4 \nare each independently selected from lower alkyl groups containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, that is to say methyl, ethyl, propyl etc. R\n3 \nand R\n4 \nmay both be methyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen R\n3 \nand/or R\n4 \nis aryl, typical values are phenyl and tolyl (PhCH\n3\n; o).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere R\n3 \nand/or R\n4 \nrepresent cycloalkyl, typical values are cyclopropyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen joined together R\n3 \nand R\n4 \ntypically represent an alkylene group providing a chain of 4 to 6 carbon atoms, optionally interrupted by one or more hetero atoms or groups, e.g. to provide a 5 membered heterocycle, e.g. morpholino, pyrrolidino or piperidino.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWithin the values alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, acyl and aryl substituted groups are included containing as substituents therein one or more groups which do not interfere with the sulphatase inhibitory activity of the compound in question.

This cell line may be used to study the control of human breast cancer cell growth. It possesses significant steroid sulphatase activity (Boivin et al., J. Med. Chem., 2000, 43: 4465-4478) and is available in from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCells are maintained in Minimal Essential Medium (MEM) (Flow Laboratories, Irvine, Scotland) containing 20 mM HEPES, 5% foetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, non-essential amino acids and 0.075% sodium bicarbonate. Up to 30 replicate 25 cm2 tissue culture flasks are seeded with approximately 1×10\n5 \ncells/flask using the above medium. Cells are grown to 80% confluency and the medium is changed every third day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntact monolayers of JEG3 cells in triplicate 25 cm\n2 \ntissue culture flasks are washed with Earle's Balanced Salt Solution (EBSS from ICN Flow, High Wycombe, U.K.) and incubated for 3-4 hours at 37° C. with 5 pmol (7×10\n5 \ndpm) [6, 7-3H]oestrone-3-sulphate (specific activity 60 Ci/mmol from New England Nuclear, Boston, Mass., U.S.A.) in serum-free MEM (2.5 ml) together with oestrone-3-sulphamate (11 concentrations: 0; 1 fM; 0.01 pM; 0.1 pM; 1 pM; 0.01 nM; 0.1 nM; 1 nM; 0.01 mM; 0.1 mM; 1 mM). After incubation each flask is cooled and the medium (1 ml) is pipetted into separate tubes containing [14C]oestrone (7×103 dpm) (specific activity 97 Ci/mmol from Amersham International Radiochemical Centre, Amersham, U.K.). The mixture is shaken thoroughly for 30 seconds with toluene (5 ml). Experiments have shown that >90% [14C] oestrone and <0.1% [3H]oestrone-3-sulphate is removed from the aqueous phase by this treatment. A portion (2 ml) of the organic phase is removed, evaporated and the 3H and 14C content of the residue determined by scintillation spectrometry. The mass of oestrone-3-sulphate hydrolysed was calculated from the 3H counts obtained (corrected for the volumes of the medium and organic phase used, and for recovery of [14C] oestrone added) and the specific activity of the substrate. Each batch of experiments includes incubations of microsomes prepared from a sulphatase-positive human placenta (positive control) and flasks without cells (to assess apparent non-enzymatic hydrolysis of the substrate). The number of cell nuclei per flask is determined using a Coulter Counter after treating the cell monolayers with Zaponin. One flask in each batch is used to assess cell membrane status and viability using the Trypan Blue exclusion method (Phillips, H. J. (1973) In: Tissue culture and applications, [eds: Kruse, D. F. & Patterson, M. K.]; pp. 406-408; Academic Press, New York).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults for steroid sulphatase activity are expressed as the mean±1 S.D. of the total product (oestrone+oestradiol) formed during the incubation period (3-4 hours) calculated for 106 cells and, for values showing statistical significance, as a percentage reduction (inhibition) over incubations containing no oestrone-3-sulphamate. Unpaired Student's t-test was used to test the statistical significance of results.\n\n\n \nAssay for Determining STS Activity Using Placental Microsomes\n\n\nProtocol 2\n\n\n \n \n \nInhibition of Steroid Sulphatase Activity in Placental Microsomes\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSulphatase-positive human placenta from normal term pregnancies are thoroughly minced with scissors and washed once with cold phosphate buffer (pH 7.4, 50 mM) then re-suspended in cold phosphate buffer (5 ml/g tissue). Homogenisation is accomplished with an Ultra-Turrax homogeniser, using three 10 second bursts separated by 2 minute cooling periods in ice. Nuclei and cell debris are removed by centrifuging (4° C.) at 2000 g for 30 minutes and portions (2 ml) of the supernatant are stored at 20° C. The protein concentration of the supernatants is determined by the method of Bradford (Anal. Biochem., 72, 248-254 (1976)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIncubations (1 ml) are carried out using a protein concentration of 100 mg/ml, substrate concentration of 20 mM [6,7-3H]oestrone-3-sulphate (specific activity 60 Ci/mmol from New England Nuclear, Boston, Mass., U.S.A.) and an incubation time of 20 minutes at 37° C. If necessary eight concentrations of compounds are employed: 0 (i.e. control); 0.05 mM; 0.1 mM; 0.2 mM; 0.4 mM; 0.6 mM; 0.8 mM; 1.0 mM. After incubation each sample is cooled and the medium (1 ml) was pipetted into separate tubes containing [14C]oestrone (7×103 dpm) (specific activity 97 Ci/mmol from Amersham International Radiochemical Centre, Amersham, U.K.). The mixture is shaken thoroughly for 30 seconds with toluene (5 ml). Experiments have shown that >90% [14C]oestrone and <0.1% [3H]oestrone-3-sulphate is removed from the aqueous phase by this treatment. A portion (2 ml) of the organic phase was removed, evaporated and the 3H and 14C content of the residue determined by scintillation spectrometry. The mass of oestrone-3-sulphate hydrolysed is calculated from the 3H counts obtained (corrected for the volumes of the medium and organic phase used, and for recovery of [14C]oestrone added) and the specific activity of the substrate.\n\n\n \nAnimal Assay Model for Determining STS Activity\n\n\nProtocol 3\n\n\n \n \n \nInhibition of Oestrone Sulphatase Activity In Vivo\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention may be studied using an animal model, in particular in ovariectomised rats. In this model compounds which are oestrogenic stimulate uterine growth.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound (0.1 mg/Kg/day for five days) is administered orally to rats with another group of animals receiving vehicle only (propylene glycol). At the end of the study samples of liver tissue were obtained and oestrone sulphatase activity assayed using 3H oestrone sulphate as the substrate as previously described (see PCT/GB95/02638).\n\n\n \nAnimal Assay Model for Determining Oestrogenic Activity\n\n\nProtocol 4\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention may be studied using an animal model, in particular in ovariectomised rats. In this model, compounds which are oestrogenic stimulate uterine growth.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound (0.1 mg/Kg/day for five days) was administered orally to rats with another group of animals receiving vehicle only (propylene glycol). At the end of the study uteri were obtained and weighed with the results being expressed as uterine weight/whole body weight×100.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds having no significant effect on uterine growth are not oestrogenic.\n\n\n \nBiotechnological Assays for Determining STS Activity\n\n\nProtocol 5\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ability of compounds to inhibit oestrone sulphatase activity can also be assessed using amino acid sequences or nucleotide sequences encoding STS, or active fragments, derivatives, homologues or variants thereof in, for example, high-through put screens. Such assays and methods for their pratice are taught in WO 03/045925 which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one preferred aspect, the present invention relates to a method of identifying agents that selectively modulate STS, which compounds have the formula (I).\n\n\n \nAssay for Determining Aromatase Activity Using JEG3 Cells\n\n\nProtocol 6\n\n\n \n \n \nAromatase activity is measured in JEG3 choriocarcinoma cells, obtained from the ATCC. This cell line possesses significant aromatase activity and is widely used to study the control of human aromatase activity (Bhatnager et al., J. Steroid Biochem. Molec. Biol. 2001, 76: 199-202). Cells are maintained in Minimal Essential Medium (MEM, Flow Laboratories, Irvine, Scotland) containing 20 mM HEPES, 10% foetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, non-essential amino acids and 0.075% sodium bicarbonate. Intact monolayers of JEG3 cells (2.5×10\n6 \ncells) in triplicate 25 cm\n2 \ntissue culture flasks are washed with Earle's Balanced salt solution (EBSS, from ICN Flow, High Wycombe, UK) and incubated with [1β-\n3\nH] androstenedione (2-5 nM, 26 Ci/mmol, New England Nuclear, Boston, Mass., USA) for 30 min with inhibitors over the range of 10 pm-10 μM. During the aromatase reaction, \n3\nH\n2\nO is liberated which can be quantified using a liquid scintillation spectrometer (Beckman-Coulter, High Wycombe, Bucks. UK). This \n3\nH\n2\nO-release method has been widely used to measure aromatase activity (Newton et al., J. Steroid Biochem. 1986, 24: 1033-1039). The number of cell nuclei per flask is determined using a Coulter Counter after treating the cell monolayers with Z aponin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults for aromatase activity are expressed as the mean±1 S.D. of the product formed during the incubation period (30 min) calculated for 10\n6 \ncells and, for values showing a statistical significance, as a percentage reduction (inhibition) over incubations containing no aromatase inhibitor. Unpaired Student's t test was used to test the statistical significance of results. IC\n50 \nvalues were calculated as the concentration of inhibitor required to obtain a 50% inhibition of aromatase activity.\n\n\n \nAnimal Assays for Determining Aromatase Activity\n\n\nProtocol 7\n\n\n \n \n \n(i) Inhibition of PMSG-Induced Oestrogen Synthesis\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ability of compounds to inhibit aromatase activity in vivo was tested using a pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin (PMSG)-induced oestrogen synthesis assay. For this, female rats (250 g) were injected with PMSG (200 IU, s.c.). After 72 h rats were administered vehicle (propylene glycol) or various doses of test compounds orally. At 2 h after dosing blood samples were obtained by cardiac puncture (under anaesthesia). Plasma oestradiol levels were measured in control groups and groups receiving drugs. The efficacy of aromatase inhibition was determined by measurement of plasma oestradiol concentrations by radioimmunoassay. This method has been widely used to determine the effectiveness of aromatase inhibitors in vivo (Wouters et al., J. Steroid Biochem., 1989, 32: 781-788).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(ii) Inhibition of Androstenedione Stimulated Uterine Growth in Ovariectomised Rats\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFemale rats (250 g) were ovariectomised and used to determine the effectiveness of aromatase inhibition on androstenedione stimulated uterine growth. Administration of androstenedione (30 mg/kg/d) for a 2-week period results in a significant increase in uterine growth in ovariectomised animals. This increase in uterine growth is stimulated by oestrogen which is derived from the administered androstenedione as a result of the action of the aromatase enzyme. By co-administration of compounds with androstenedione the extent of aromatase inhibition can be determined by measurements of uterine weights in treated and untreated animals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherapy\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention may be used as therapeutic agents—i.e. in therapy applications.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “therapy” includes curative effects, alleviation effects, and prophylactic effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe therapy may be on humans or animals, preferably female animals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition, which comprises a compound according to the present invention and optionally a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient (including combinations thereof).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions may be for human or animal usage in human and veterinary medicine and will typically comprise any one or more of a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, carrier, or excipient. Acceptable carriers or diluents for therapeutic use are well known in the pharmaceutical art, and are described, for example, in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co. (A. R. Gennaro edit. 1985). The choice of pharmaceutical carrier, excipient or diluent can be selected with regard to the intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. The pharmaceutical compositions may comprise as—or in addition to—the carrier, excipient or diluent any suitable binder(s), lubricant(s), suspending agent(s), coating agent(s), solubilising agent(s).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreservatives, stabilisers, dyes and even flavouring agents may be provided in the pharmaceutical composition. Examples of preservatives include sodium benzoate, sorbic acid and esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid. Antioxidants and suspending agents may be also used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere may be different composition/formulation requirements dependent on the different delivery systems. By way of example, the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may be formulated to be delivered using a mini-pump or by a mucosal route, for example, as a nasal spray or aerosol for inhalation or ingestable solution, or parenterally in which the composition is formulated by an injectable form, for delivery, by, for example, an intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous route. Alternatively, the formulation may be designed to be delivered by both routes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere the agent is to be delivered mucosally through the gastrointestinal mucosa, it should be able to remain stable during transit though the gastrointestinal tract; for example, it should be resistant to proteolytic degradation, stable at acid pH and resistant to the detergent effects of bile.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere appropriate, the pharmaceutical compositions can be administered by inhalation, in the form of a suppository or pessary, topically in the form of a lotion, solution, cream, ointment or dusting powder, by use of a skin patch, orally in the form of tablets containing excipients such as starch or lactose, or in capsules or ovules either alone or in admixture with excipients, or in the form of elixirs, solutions or suspensions containing flavouring or colouring agents, or they can be injected parenterally, for example intravenously, intramuscularly or subcutaneously. For parenteral administration, the compositions may be best used in the form of a sterile aqueous solution which may contain other substances, for example enough salts or monosaccharides to make the solution isotonic with blood. For buccal or sublingual administration the compositions may be administered in the form of tablets or lozenges which can be formulated in a conventional manner.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCombination Pharmaceutical\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound of the present invention may be used in combination with one or more other active agents, such as one or more other pharmaceutically active agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy way of example, the compounds of the present invention may be used in combination with other STS inhibitors and/or other inhibitors such as an aromatase inhibitor (such as for example, 4-hydroxyandrostenedione (4-OHA)) and/or steroids—such as the naturally occurring neurosteroids dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and pregnenolone sulfate (PS) and/or other structurally similar organic compounds. Examples of other STS inhibitors may be found in the above references. By way of example, STS inhibitors for use in the present invention include EMATE, and either or both of the 2-ethyl and 2-methoxy 17-deoxy compounds that are analogous to compound 5 presented herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, or in the alternative, the compound of the present invention may be used in combination with a biological response modifier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term biological response modifier (“BRM”) includes cytokines, immune modulators, growth factors, haematopoiesis regulating factors, colony stimulating factors, chemotactic, haemolytic and thrombolytic factors, cell surface receptors, ligands, leukocyte adhesion molecules, monoclonal antibodies, preventative and therapeutic vaccines, hormones, extracellular matrix components, fibronectin, etc. For some applications, preferably, the biological response modifier is a cytokine. Examples of cytokines include: interleukins (IL)—such as IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-11, IL-12, IL-19; Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF)— such as TNF-α; Interferon alpha, beta and gamma; TGF-β. For some applications, preferably the cytokine is tumour necrosis factor (TNF). For some applications, the TNF may be any type of TNF—such as TNF-α, TNF-β, including derivatives or mixtures thereof. More preferably the cytokine is TNF-α. Teachings on TNF may be found in the art—such as WO-A-98/08870 and WO-A-98/13348.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdministration\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypically, a physician will determine the actual dosage which will be most suitable for an individual subject and it will vary with the age, weight and response of the particular patient. The dosages below are exemplary of the average case. There can, of course, be individual instances where higher or lower dosage ranges are merited.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions of the present invention may be administered by direct injection. The composition may be formulated for parenteral, mucosal, intramuscular, intravenous, subcutaneous, intraocular or transdermal administration. Depending upon the need, the agent may be administered at a dose of from 0.01 to 30 mg/kg body weight, such as from 0.1 to 10 mg/kg, more preferably from 0.1 to 1 mg/kg body weight.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy way of further example, the agents of the present invention may be administered in accordance with a regimen of 1 to 4 times per day, preferably once or twice per day. The specific dose level and frequency of dosage for any particular patient may be varied and will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the metabolic stability and length of action of that compound, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, mode and time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity of the particular condition, and the host undergoing therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAside from the typical modes of delivery—indicated above—the term “administered” also includes delivery by techniques such as lipid mediated transfection, liposomes, immunoliposomes, lipofectin, cationic facial amphiphiles (CFAs) and combinations thereof. The routes for such delivery mechanisms include but are not limited to mucosal, nasal, oral, parenteral, gastrointestinal, topical, or sublingual routes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “administered” includes but is not limited to delivery by a mucosal route, for example, as a nasal spray or aerosol for inhalation or as an ingestable solution; a parenteral route where delivery is by an injectable form, such as, for example, an intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous route.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, for pharmaceutical administration, the STS inhibitors of the present invention can be formulated in any suitable manner utilising conventional pharmaceutical formulating techniques and pharmaceutical carriers, adjuvants, excipients, diluents etc. and usually for parenteral administration. Approximate effective dose rates may be in the range from 1 to 1000 mg/day, such as from 10 to 900 mg/day or even from 100 to 800 mg/day depending on the individual activities of the compounds in question and for a patient of average (70 Kg) bodyweight. More usual dosage rates for the preferred and more active compounds will be in the range 200 to 800 mg/day, more preferably, 200 to 500 mg/day, most preferably from 200 to 250 mg/day. They may be given in single dose regimes, split dose regimes and/or in multiple dose regimes lasting over several days. For oral administration they may be formulated in tablets, capsules, solution or suspension containing from 100 to 500 mg of compound per unit dose. Alternatively and preferably the compounds will be formulated for parenteral administration in a suitable parenterally administrable carrier and providing single daily dosage rates in the range 200 to 800 mg, preferably 200 to 500, more preferably 200 to 250 mg. Such effective daily doses will, however, vary depending on inherent activity of the active ingredient and on the bodyweight of the patient, such variations being within the skill and judgement of the physician.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCell Cycling\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention may be useful in the method of treatment of a cell cycling disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs discussed in “Molecular Cell Biology” 3rd Ed. Lodish et al. pages 177-181 different eukaryotic cells can grow and divide at quite different rates. Yeast cells, for example, can divide every 120 min., and the first divisions of fertilised eggs in the embryonic cells of sea urchins and insects take only 1530 min. because one large pre-existing cell is subdivided. However, most growing plant and animal cells take 10-20 hours to double in number, and some duplicate at a much slower rate. Many cells in adults, such as nerve cells and striated muscle cells, do not divide at all; others, like the fibroblasts that assist in healing wounds, grow on demand but are otherwise quiescent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStill, every eukaryotic cell that divides must be ready to donate equal genetic material to two daughter cells. DNA synthesis in eukaryotes does not occur throughout the cell division cycle but is restricted to a part of it before cell division.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe relationship between eukaryotic DNA synthesis and cell division has been thoroughly analysed in cultures of mammalian cells that were all capable of growth and division. In contrast to bacteria, it was found, eukaryotic cells spend only a part of their time in DNA synthesis, and it is completed hours before cell division (mitosis). Thus a gap of time occurs after DNA synthesis and before cell division; another gap was found to occur after division and before the next round of DNA synthesis. This analysis led to the conclusion that the eukaryotic cell cycle consists of an M (mitotic) phase, a G\n1 \nphase (the first gap), the S (DNA synthesis) phase, a G\n2 \nphase (the second gap), and back to M. The phases between mitoses (G\n1\n, S, and G\n2\n) are known collectively as the interphase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMany nondividing cells in tissues (for example, all quiescent fibroblasts) suspend the cycle after mitosis and just prior to DNA synthesis; such “resting” cells are said to have exited from the cell cycle and to be in the G\n0 \nstate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is possible to identify cells when they are in one of the three interphase stages of the cell cycle, by using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) to measure their relative DNA content: a cell that is in G\n1 \n(before DNA synthesis) has a defined amount x of DNA; during S (DNA replication), it has between x and 2x; and when in G\n2 \n(or M), it has 2x of DNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe stages of mitosis and cytokinesis in an animal cell are as follows\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(a) Interphase. The G\n2 \nstage of interphase immediately precedes the beginning of mitosis. Chromosomal DNA has been replicated and bound to protein during the S phase, but chromosomes are not yet seen as distinct structures. The nucleolus is the only nuclear substructure that is visible under light microscope. In a diploid cell before DNA replication there are two morphologic chromosomes of each type, and the cell is said to be 2n. In G\n2\n, after DNA replication, the cell is 4n. There are four copies of each chromosomal DNA. Since the sister chromosomes have not yet separated from each other, they are called sister chromatids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nb) Early prophase. Centrioles, each with a newly formed daughter centriole, begin moving toward opposite poles of the cell; the chromosomes can be seen as long threads. The nuclear membrane begins to disaggregate into small vesicles.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(c) Middle and late prophase. Chromosome condensation is completed; each visible chromosome structure is composed of two chromatids held together at their centromeres. Each chromatid contains one of the two newly replicated daughter DNA molecules. The microtubular spindle begins to radiate from the regions just adjacent to the centrioles, which are moving closer to their poles. Some spindle fibres reach from pole to pole; most go to chromatids and attach at kinetochores.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(d) Metaphase. The chromosomes move toward the equator of the cell, where they become aligned in the equatorial plane. The sister chromatids have not yet separated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(e) Anaphase. The two sister chromatids separate into independent chromosomes. Each contains a centromere that is linked by a spindle fibre to one pole, to which it moves. Thus one copy of each chromosome is donated to each daughter cell. Simultaneously, the cell elongates, as do the pole-to-pole spindles. Cytokinesis begins as the cleavage furrow starts to form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(f) Telophase. New membranes form around the daughter nuclei; the chromosomes uncoil and become less distinct, the nucleolus becomes visible again, and the nuclear membrane forms around each daughter nucleus. Cytokinesis is nearly complete, and the spindle disappears as the microtubules and other fibres depolymerise. Throughout mitosis the “daughter” centriole at each pole grows until it is full-length. At telophase the duplication of each of the original centrioles is completed, and new daughter centrioles will be generated during the next interphase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(g) Interphase. Upon the completion of cytokinesis, the cell enters the G\n1 \nphase of the cell cycle and proceeds again around the cycle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be appreciated that cell cycling is an extremely important cell process. Deviations from normal cell cycling can result in a number of medical disorders. Increased and/or unrestricted cell cycling may result in cancer. Reduced cell cycling may result in degenerative conditions. Use of the compound of the present invention may provide a means to treat such disorders and conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, the compound of the present invention may be suitable for use in the treatment of cell cycling disorders such as cancers, including hormone dependent and hormone independent cancers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, the compound of the present invention may be suitable for the treatment of cancers such as breast cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, sarcomas, melanomas, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer etc. and other solid tumours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor some applications, cell cycling is inhibited and/or prevented and/or arrested, preferably wherein cell cycling is prevented and/or arrested. In one aspect cell cycling may be inhibited and/or prevented and/or arrested in the G\n2\n/M phase. In one aspect cell cycling may be irreversibly prevented and/or inhibited and/or arrested, preferably wherein cell cycling is irreversibly prevented and/or arrested.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy the term “irreversibly prevented and/or inhibited and/or arrested” it is meant after application of a compound of the present invention, on removal of the compound the effects of the compound, namely prevention and/or inhibition and/or arrest of cell cycling, are still observable. More particularly by the term “irreversibly prevented and/or inhibited and/or arrested” it is meant that when assayed in accordance with the cell cycling assay protocol presented herein, cells treated with a compound of interest show less growth after Stage 2 of the protocol I than control cells. Details on this protocol are presented below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, the present invention provides compounds which: cause inhibition of growth of oestrogen receptor positive (ER+) and ER negative (ER−) breast cancer cells in vitro by preventing and/or inhibiting and/or arresting cell cycling; and/or cause regression of nitroso-methyl urea (NMU)-induced mammary tumours in intact animals (i.e. not ovariectomised), and/or prevent and/or inhibit and/or arrest cell cycling in cancer cells; and/or act in vivo by preventing and/or inhibiting and/or arresting cell cycling and/or act as a cell cycling agonist.\n\n\n \nCell Cycling Assay\n\n\nProtocol 7\n\n\n \n \n \nProcedure\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStage 1\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMCF-7 breast cancer cells are seeded into multi-well culture plates at a density of 105 cells/well. Cells were allowed to attach and grown until about 30% confluent when they are treated as follows:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nControl—no treatment\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompound of Interest (COI) 20 μM\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCells are grown for 6 days in growth medium containing the COI with changes of medium/COI every 3 days. At the end of this period cell numbers were counted using a Coulter cell counter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStage 2\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter treatment of cells for a 6-day period with the COI cells are re-seeded at a density of 10\n4 \ncells/well. No further treatments are added. Cells are allowed to continue to grow for a further 6 days in the presence of growth medium. At the end of this period cell numbers are again counted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCancer\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs indicated, the compounds of the present invention may be useful in the treatment of a cell cycling disorder. A particular cell cycling disorder is cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCancer remains a major cause of mortality in most Western countries. Cancer therapies developed so far have included blocking the action or synthesis of hormones to inhibit the growth of hormone-dependent tumours. However, more aggressive chemotherapy is currently employed for the treatment of hormone-independent tumours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHence, the development of a pharmaceutical for anti-cancer treatment of hormone dependent and/or hormone independent tumours, yet lacking some or all of the side-effects associated with chemotherapy, would represent a major therapeutic advance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is known that oestrogens undergo a number of hydroxylation and conjugation reactions after their synthesis. Until recently it was thought that such reactions were part of a metabolic process that ultimately rendered oestrogens water soluble and enhanced their elimination from the body. It is now evident that some hydroxy metabolites (e.g. 2-hydroxy and 16alpha-hydroxy) and conjugates (e.g. oestrone sulphate, E1S) are important in determining some of the complex actions that oestrogens have in the body.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWorkers have investigated the formation of 2- and 16-hydroxylated oestrogens in relation to conditions that alter the risk of breast cancer. There is now evidence that factors which increase 2-hydroxylase activity are associated with a reduced cancer risk, while those increasing 16alpha-hydroxylation may enhance the risk of breast cancer. Further interest in the biological role of estrogen metabolites has been stimulated by the growing body of evidence that 2-methoxyoestradiol is an endogenous metabolite with anti-mitotic properties. 2-MeOE2 is formed from 2-hydroxy estradiol (2-OHE2) by catechol estrogen methyl transferase, an enzyme that is widely distributed throughout the body.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWorkers have shown that in vivo 2-MeOE2 inhibits the growth of tumours arising from the subcutaneous injection of Meth A sarcoma, B16 melanoma or MDA-MB-435 estrogen receptor negative (ER−) breast cancer cells. It also inhibits endothelial cell proliferation and migration, and in vitro angiogenesis. It was suggested that the ability of 2-MeOE2 to inhibit tumour growth in vivo may be due to its ability to inhibit tumour-induced angiogenesis rather than direct inhibition of the proliferation of tumour cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe mechanism by which 2-MeOE2 exerts its potent anti-mitogenic and anti-angiogenic effects is still being elucidated. There is evidence that at high concentrations it can inhibit microtubule polymerisation and act as a weak inhibitor of colchicine binding to tubulin. Recently, however, at concentrations that block mitosis, tubulin filaments in cells were not found to be depolymerised but to have an identical morphology to that seen after taxol treatment. It is possible, therefore, that like taxol, a drug that is used for breast and ovarian breast cancer therapy, 2-MeOE2 acts by stabilising microtubule dynamics.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile the identification of 2-MeOE2 as a new therapy for cancer represents an important advance, the bioavailability of orally administered oestrogens is poor. Furthermore, they can undergo extensive metabolism during their first pass through the liver. As part of a research programme to develop a steroid sulphatase inhibitor for breast cancer therapy, oestrone-3-O-sulphamate (EMATE) was identified as a potent active site-directed inhibitor. Unexpectedly, EMATE proved to possess potent oestrogenic properties with its oral uterotrophic activity in rats being a 100-times higher than that of estradiol. Its enhanced oestrogenicity is thought to result from its absorption by red blood cells (rbcs) which protects it from inactivation during its passage through the liver and which act as a reservoir for its slow release for a prolonged period of time. A number of A-ring modified analogues were synthesised and tested, including 2-methoxyoestrone-3-O-sulphamate. While this compound was equipotent with EMATE as a steroid sulphatase inhibitor, it was devoid of oestrogenicity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe believe that the compound of the present invention provides a means for the treatment of cancers and, especially, breast cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition or in the alternative the compound of the present invention may be useful in the blocking the growth of cancers including leukaemias and solid tumours such as breast, endometrium, prostate, ovary and pancreatic tumours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherapy Concerning Oestrogen\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe believe that some of the compounds of the present invention may be useful in the control of oestrogen levels in the body—in particular in females. Thus, some of the compounds may be useful as providing a means of fertility control—such as an oral contraceptive tablet, pill, solution or lozenge. Alternatively, the compound could be in the form of an implant or as a patch.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, the compounds of the present invention may be useful in treating hormonal conditions associated with oestrogen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition or in the alternative the compound of the present invention may be useful in treating hormonal conditions in addition to those associated with oestrogen. Hence, the compound of the present invention may also be capable of affecting hormonal activity and may also be capable of affecting an immune response.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNeurodegenerative Diseases\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe believe that some of the compounds of the present invention may be useful in the treatment of neurodenerative diseases, and similar conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy way of example, it is believed that STS inhibitors may be useful in the enhancing the memory function of patients suffering from illnesses such as amnesia, head injuries, Alzheimer's disease, epileptic dementia, presenile dementia, post traumatic dementia, senile dementia, vascular dementia and post-stroke dementia or individuals otherwise seeking memory enhancement.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTH1\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe believe that some of the compounds of the present invention may be useful in TH1 implications.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy way of example, it is believed that the presence of STS inhibitors within the macrophage or other antigen presenting cells may lead to a decreased ability of sensitised T cells to mount a TH1 (high IL-2, IFNγ low IL-4) response.

(canceled) Description\n\n\n\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present application is a 371 application of PCT/US2009/036934 filed Mar. 12, 2009, which claims the priority benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/036,127, filed Mar. 13, 2008 and the priority benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/145,203, filed Jan. 16, 2009, all of which are expressly incorporated fully herein by reference.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates generally to novel pyridazine derivatives and analogues thereof, which inhibit factor XIa and/or plasma kallikrein, compositions containing them, and methods of using them, for example, for the treatment or prophylaxis of thromboembolic disorders.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThromboembolic diseases remain the leading cause of death in developed countries despite the availability of anticoagulants such as warfarin (COUMADIN®), heparin, low molecular weight heparins (LMWH), and synthetic pentasaccharides and antiplatelet agents such as aspirin and clopidogrel (PLAVIX®). The oral anticoagulant warfarin, inhibits the post-translational maturation of coagulation factors VII, IX, X and prothrombin, and has proven effective in both venous and arterial thrombosis. However, its usage is limited due to its narrow therapeutic index, slow onset of therapeutic effect, numerous dietary and drug interactions, and a need for monitoring and dose adjustment. Thus discovering and developing safe and efficacious oral anticoagulants for the prevention and treatment of a wide range of thromboembolic disorders has become increasingly important.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne approach is to inhibit thrombin generation by targeting the inhibition of coagulation factor XIa (FXIa). Factor XIa is a plasma serine protease involved in the regulation of blood coagulation, which is initiated in vivo by the binding of tissue factor (TF) to factor VII (FVII) to generate factor VIIa (FVIIa). The resulting TF:FVIIa complex activates factor IX (FIX) and factor X (FX) that leads to the production of factor Xa (FXa). The generated FXa catalyzes the transformation of prothrombin into small amounts of thrombin before this pathway is shut down by tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI). The process of coagulation is then further propagated via the feedback activation of Factors V, VIII and XI by catalytic amounts of thrombin. (Walsh, P. N., \nThromb. Haemostasis \n1999, 82:234-242.) The resulting burst of thrombin converts fibrinogen to fibrin that polymerizes to form the structural framework of a blood clot, and activates platelets, which are a key cellular component of coagulation (Hoffman, M., \nBlood Reviews \n2003, 17:S1-S5). Therefore, factor XIa plays a key role in propagating this amplification loop and is thus an attractive target for anti-thrombotic therapy.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides novel pyridazine derivatives and analogues thereof, which are useful as selective inhibitors of serine protease enzymes, especially factor XIa and/or plasma kallikrein, or stereoisomers, tautomers, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, or prodrugs thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides processes and intermediates for making the compounds of the present invention or stereoisomers, tautomers, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, or prodrugs thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and at least one of the compounds of the present invention or stereoisomers, tautomers, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, or prodrugs thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides a method for the treatment or prophylaxis of thromboembolic disorders comprising administering to a patient in need of such treatment or prophylaxis a therapeutically effective amount of at least one of the compounds of the present invention or stereoisomers, tautomers, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, or prodrugs thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides the compounds of the present invention or stereoisomers, tautomers, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, or prodrugs thereof, for use in therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides the use of the compounds of the present invention or stereoisomers, tautomers, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, or prodrugs thereof, for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or prophylaxis of a thromboembolic disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese and other features of the invention will be set forth in expanded form as the disclosure continues.\n\n\n \nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nI.

Chemistry\n\n\n \n \n \nThroughout the specification and the appended claims, a given chemical formula or name shall encompass all stereo and optical isomers and racemates thereof where such isomers exist. Unless otherwise indicated, all chiral (enantiomeric and diastereomeric) and racemic forms are within the scope of the invention. Many geometric isomers of C═C double bonds, C═N double bonds, ring systems, and the like can also be present in the compounds, and all such stable isomers are contemplated in the present invention. Cis- and trans- (or E- and Z-) geometric isomers of the compounds of the present invention are described and may be isolated as a mixture of isomers or as separated isomeric forms. The present compounds can be isolated in optically active or racemic forms. Optically active forms may be prepared by resolution of racemic forms or by synthesis from optically active starting materials. All processes used to prepare compounds of the present invention and intermediates made therein are considered to be part of the present invention. When enantiomeric or diastereomeric products are prepared, they may be separated by conventional methods, for example, by chromatography or fractional crystallization. Depending on the process conditions the end products of the present invention are obtained either in free (neutral) or salt form. Both the free form and the salts of these end products are within the scope of the invention. If so desired, one form of a compound may be converted into another form. A free base or acid may be converted into a salt; a salt may be converted into the free compound or another salt; a mixture of isomeric compounds of the present invention may be separated into the individual isomers. Compounds of the present invention, free form and salts thereof, may exist in multiple tautomeric forms, in which hydrogen atoms are transposed to other parts of the molecules and the chemical bonds between the atoms of the molecules are consequently rearranged. It should be understood that all tautomeric forms, insofar as they may exist, are included within the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe molecular weight of compounds of the present invention is preferably less than about 800 grams per mole.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “alkyl” or “alkylene” is intended to include both branched and straight-chain saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon groups having the specified number of carbon atoms.

A bridged ring occurs when one or more carbon atoms link two non-adjacent carbon atoms. Preferred bridges are one or two carbon atoms. It is noted that a bridge always converts a monocyclic ring into a tricyclic ring. When a ring is bridged, the substituents recited for the ring may also be present on the bridge.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “bicyclic carbocycle” or “bicyclic carbocyclic group” is intended to mean a stable 9 or 10-membered carbocyclic ring system that contains two fused rings and consists of carbon atoms. Of the two fused rings, one ring is a benzo ring fused to a second ring; and the second ring is a 5 or 6 membered carbon ring which is saturated, partially unsaturated, or unsaturated. The bicyclic carbocyclic group may be attached to its pendant group at any carbon atom which results in a stable structure. The bicyclic carbocyclic group described herein may be substituted on any carbon if the resulting compound is stable. Examples of a bicyclic carbocyclic group are, but not limited to, naphthyl, 1,2-dihydronaphthyl, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthyl, and indanyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Aryl” groups refer to monocyclic or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, including, for example, phenyl, naphthyl, and phenanthranyl. Aryl moieties are well known and described, for example, in \nHawley's Condensed Chemical Dictionary \n(13th ed.), R. J. Lewis, ed., J. Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1997. “C\n6-10 \naryl” refers to phenyl and naphthyl. Unless otherwise specified, “aryl”, “C\n6-10 \naryl” or “aromatic residue” may be unsubstituted or substituted with 1 to 3 groups selected from OH, OCH\n3\n, Cl, F, Br, I, CN, NO\n2\n, NH\n2\n, N(CH\n3\n)H, N(CH\n3\n)\n2\n, CF\n3\n, OCF\n3\n, C(═O)CH\n3\n, SCH\n3\n, S(═O)CH\n3\n, S(═O)\n2\nCH\n3\n, CH\n3\n, CH\n2\nCH\n3\n, CO\n2\nH, and CO\n2\nCH\n3\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “heterocycle” or “heterocyclic group” is intended to mean a stable 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, or 7-membered monocyclic or bicyclic or 7-, 8-, 9-, 10-, 11-, 12-, 13-, or 14-membered polycyclic heterocyclic ring that is saturated, partially unsaturated, or fully unsaturated, and that contains carbon atoms and 1, 2, 3 or 4 heteroatoms independently selected from the group consisting of N, O and S; and including any polycyclic group in which any of the above-defined heterocyclic rings is fused to a benzene ring. The nitrogen and sulfur heteroatoms may optionally be oxidized (i.e., N→O and S(O)\np\n, wherein p is 0, 1 or 2). The nitrogen atom may be substituted or unsubstituted (i.e., N or NR wherein R is H or another substituent, if defined). The heterocyclic ring may be attached to its pendant group at any heteroatom or carbon atom that results in a stable structure. The heterocyclic rings described herein may be substituted on carbon or on a nitrogen atom if the resulting compound is stable. A nitrogen in the heterocycle may optionally be quaternized. It is preferred that when the total number of S and O atoms in the heterocycle exceeds 1, then these heteroatoms are not adjacent to one another. It is preferred that the total number of S and O atoms in the heterocycle is not more than 1. When the term “heterocycle” is used, it is intended to include heteroaryl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of heterocycles include, but are not limited to, acridinyl, azetidinyl, azocinyl, benzimidazolyl, benzofuranyl, benzothiofuranyl, benzothiophenyl, benzoxazolyl, benzoxazolinyl, benzthiazolyl, benztriazolyl, benztetrazolyl, benzisoxazolyl, benzisothiazolyl, benzimidazolinyl, carbazolyl, 4aH-carbazolyl, carbolinyl, chromanyl, chromenyl, cinnolinyl, decahydroquinolinyl, 2H,6H-1,5,2-dithiazinyl, dihydrofuro[2,3-b]tetrahydrofuran, furanyl, furazanyl, imidazolidinyl, imidazolinyl, imidazolyl, 1H-indazolyl, imidazolopyridinyl, indolenyl, indolinyl, indolizinyl, indolyl, 3H-indolyl, isatinoyl, isobenzofuranyl, isochromanyl, isoindazolyl, isoindolinyl, isoindolyl, isoquinolinyl, isothiazolyl, isothiazolopyridinyl, isoxazolyl, isoxazolopyridinyl, methylenedioxyphenyl, morpholinyl, naphthyridinyl, octahydroisoquinolinyl, oxadiazolyl, 1,2,3-oxadiazolyl, 1,2,4-oxadiazolyl, 1,2,5-oxadiazolyl, 1,3,4-oxadiazolyl, oxazolidinyl, oxazolyl, oxazolopyridinyl, oxazolidinylperimidinyl, oxindolyl, pyrimidinyl, phenanthridinyl, phenanthrolinyl, phenazinyl, phenothiazinyl, phenoxathiinyl, phenoxazinyl, phthalazinyl, piperazinyl, piperidinyl, piperidonyl, 4-piperidonyl, piperonyl, pteridinyl, purinyl, pyranyl, pyrazinyl, pyrazolidinyl, pyrazolinyl, pyrazolopyridinyl, pyrazolyl, pyridazinyl, pyridooxazolyl, pyridoimidazolyl, pyridothiazolyl, pyridinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrrolidinyl, pyrrolinyl, 2-pyrrolidonyl, 2H-pyrrolyl, pyrrolyl, quinazolinyl, quinolinyl, 4H-quinolizinyl, quinoxalinyl, quinuclidinyl, tetrazolyl, tetrahydrofuranyl, tetrahydroisoquinolinyl, tetrahydroquinolinyl, 6H-1,2,5-thiadiazinyl, 1,2,3-thiadiazolyl, 1,2,4-thiadiazolyl, 1,2,5-thiadiazolyl, 1,3,4-thiadiazolyl, thianthrenyl, thiazolyl, thienyl, thiazolopyridinyl, thienothiazolyl, thienooxazolyl, thienoimidazolyl, thiophenyl, triazinyl, 1,2,3-triazolyl, 1,2,4-triazolyl, 1,2,5-triazolyl, 1,3,4-triazolyl, and xanthenyl. Also included are fused ring and spiro compounds containing, for example, the above heterocycles.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of 5- to 10-membered heterocycles include, but are not limited to, pyridinyl, furanyl, thienyl, pyrrolyl, pyrazolyl, pyrazinyl, piperazinyl, piperidinyl, imidazolyl, imidazolidinyl, indolyl, tetrazolyl, isoxazolyl, morpholinyl, oxazolyl, oxadiazolyl, oxazolidinyl, tetrahydrofuranyl, thiadiazinyl, thiadiazolyl, thiazolyl, triazinyl, triazolyl, benzimidazolyl, 1H-indazolyl, benzofuranyl, benzothiofuranyl, benztetrazolyl, benzotriazolyl, benzisoxazolyl, benzoxazolyl, oxindolyl, benzoxazolinyl, benzthiazolyl, benzisothiazolyl, isatinoyl, isoquinolinyl, octahydroisoquinolinyl, tetrahydroisoquinolinyl, tetrahydroquinolinyl, isoxazolopyridinyl, quinazolinyl, quinolinyl, isothiazolopyridinyl, thiazolopyridinyl, oxazolopyridinyl, imidazolopyridinyl, and pyrazolopyridinyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of 5- to 6-membered heterocycles include, but are not limited to, pyridinyl, furanyl, thienyl, pyrrolyl, pyrazolyl, pyrazinyl, piperazinyl, piperidinyl, imidazolyl, imidazolidinyl, indolyl, tetrazolyl, isoxazolyl, morpholinyl, oxazolyl, oxadiazolyl, oxazolidinyl, tetrahydrofuranyl, thiadiazinyl, thiadiazolyl, thiazolyl, triazinyl, and triazolyl. Also included are fused ring and spiro compounds containing, for example, the above heterocycles.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “bicyclic heterocycle” or “bicyclic heterocyclic group” is intended to mean a stable 9 or 10-membered heterocyclic ring system which contains two fused rings and consists of carbon atoms and 1, 2, 3, or 4 heteroatoms independently selected from the group consisting of N, O and S. Of the two fused rings, one ring is a 5 or 6-membered monocyclic aromatic ring comprising a 5 membered heteroaryl ring, a 6-membered heteroaryl ring or a benzo ring, each fused to a second ring. The second ring is a 5 or 6 membered monocyclic ring which is saturated, partially unsaturated, or unsaturated, and comprises a 5 membered heterocycle, a 6 membered heterocycle or a carbocycle (provided the first ring is not benzo when the second ring is a carbocycle).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe bicyclic heterocyclic group may be attached to its pendant group at any heteroatom or carbon atom which results in a stable structure. The bicyclic heterocyclic group described herein may be substituted on carbon or on a nitrogen atom if the resulting compound is stable. It is preferred that when the total number of S and O atoms in the heterocycle exceeds 1, then these heteroatoms are not adjacent to one another. It is preferred that the total number of S and O atoms in the heterocycle is not more than 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of a bicyclic heterocyclic group are, but not limited to, quinolinyl, isoquinolinyl, phthalazinyl, quinazolinyl, indolyl, isoindolyl, indolinyl, 1H-indazolyl, benzimidazolyl, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolinyl, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolinyl, 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-quinolinyl, 2,3-dihydro-benzofuranyl, chromanyl, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-quinoxalinyl, and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-quinazolinyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “aromatic heterocyclic group” or “heteroaryl” is intended to mean stable monocyclic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that include at least one heteroatom ring member such as sulfur, oxygen, or nitrogen. Heteroaryl groups include, without limitation, pyridyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrazinyl, pyridazinyl, triazinyl, furyl, quinolyl, isoquinolyl, thienyl, imidazolyl, thiazolyl, indolyl, pyrroyl, oxazolyl, benzofuryl, benzothienyl, benzthiazolyl, isoxazolyl, pyrazolyl, triazolyl, tetrazolyl, indazolyl, 1,2,4-thiadiazolyl, isothiazolyl, purinyl, carbazolyl, benzimidazolyl, indolinyl, benzodioxolanyl, and benzodioxane. Heteroaryl groups are substituted or unsubstituted. The nitrogen atom is substituted or unsubstituted (i.e., N or NR wherein R is H or another substituent, if defined). The nitrogen and sulfur heteroatoms may optionally be oxidized (i.e., N→O and S(O)\np\n, wherein p is 0, 1 or 2).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBridged rings are also included in the definition of heterocycle. A bridged ring occurs when one or more atoms (i.e., C, O, N, or S) link two non-adjacent carbon or nitrogen atoms. Examples of bridged rings include, but are not limited to, one carbon atom, two carbon atoms, one nitrogen atom, two nitrogen atoms, and a carbon-nitrogen group. It is noted that a bridge always converts a monocyclic ring into a tricyclic ring. When a ring is bridged, the substituents recited for the ring may also be present on the bridge.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “counterion” is used to represent a negatively charged species such as chloride, bromide, hydroxide, acetate, and sulfate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen a dotted ring is used within a ring structure, this indicates that the ring structure may be saturated, partially saturated or unsaturated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs referred to herein, the term “substituted” means that at least one hydrogen atom is replaced with a non-hydrogen group, provided that normal valencies are maintained and that the substitution results in a stable compound. When a substituent is keto (i.e., ═O), then 2 hydrogens on the atom are replaced. Keto substituents are not present on aromatic moieties. When a ring system (e.g., carbocyclic or heterocyclic) is said to be substituted with a carbonyl group or a double bond, it is intended that the carbonyl group or double bond be part (i.e., within) of the ring. Ring double bonds, as used herein, are double bonds that are formed between two adjacent ring atoms (e.g., C═C, C═N, or N═N).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn cases wherein there are nitrogen atoms (e.g., amines) on compounds of the present invention, these may be converted to N-oxides by treatment with an oxidizing agent (e.g., mCPBA and/or hydrogen peroxides) to afford other compounds of this invention. Thus, shown and claimed nitrogen atoms are considered to cover both the shown nitrogen and its N-oxide (N→O) derivative. In cases in which there are quarternary carbon atoms in compounds of the present invention, these can be replaced by silicon atoms, provided they do not form Si—N or Si—O bond.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen any variable occurs more than one time in any constituent or formula for a compound, its definition at each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence. Thus, for example, if a group is shown to be substituted with 0-3 R\n3a\n, then said group may optionally be substituted with up to three R\n3a \ngroups, and at each occurrence R\n3a \nis selected independently from the definition of R\n3a\n. Also, combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen a bond to a substituent is shown to cross a bond connecting two atoms in a ring, then such substituent may be bonded to any atom on the ring. When a substituent is listed without indicating the atom in which such substituent is bonded to the rest of the compound of a given formula, then such substituent may be bonded via any atom in such substituent. Combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable” is employed herein to refer to those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms that are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and/or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” refer to derivatives of the disclosed compounds wherein the parent compound is modified by making acid or base salts thereof. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, mineral or organic acid salts of basic groups such as amines; and alkali or organic salts of acidic groups such as carboxylic acids. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the conventional non-toxic salts or the quaternary ammonium salts of the parent compound formed, for example, from non-toxic inorganic or organic acids. For example, such conventional non-toxic salts include those derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfamic, phosphoric, and nitric; and the salts prepared from organic acids such as acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, stearic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, pamoic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, phenylacetic, glutamic, benzoic, salicylic, sulfanilic, 2-acetoxybenzoic, fumaric, toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, ethane disulfonic, oxalic, and isethionic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present invention can be synthesized from the parent compound that contains a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods. Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting the free acid or base forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base or acid in water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two; generally, nonaqueous media like ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile are preferred. Lists of suitable salts are found in \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, \n18th Edition, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., 1990, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, compounds of formula I may have prodrug forms. Any compound that will be converted in vivo to provide the bioactive agent (i.e., a compound of formula I) is a prodrug within the scope and spirit of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious forms of prodrugs are well known in the art.

Such prodrugs are preferably administered orally since hydrolysis in many instances occurs principally under the influence of the digestive enzymes. Parenteral administration may be used where the ester per se is active, or in those instances where hydrolysis occurs in the blood. Examples of physiologically hydrolyzable esters of compounds of formula I include C\n1-6\nalkyl, C\n1-6\nalkylbenzyl, 4-methoxybenzyl, indanyl, phthalyl, methoxymethyl, C\n1-6 \nalkanoyloxy-C\n1-6\nalkyl (e.g., acetoxymethyl, pivaloyloxymethyl or propionyloxymethyl), C\n1-6\nalkoxycarbonyloxy-C\n1-6\nalkyl (e.g. methoxycarbonyl-oxymethyl or ethoxycarbonyloxymethyl, glycyloxymethyl, phenylglycyloxymethyl, (5-methyl-2-oxo-1,3-dioxolen-4-yl)-methyl), and other well known physiologically hydrolyzable esters used, for example, in the penicillin and cephalosporin arts. Such esters may be prepared by conventional techniques known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreparation of Prodrugs is Well Known in the Art and Described in, for example, \nMedicinal Chemistry: Principles and Practice\n, ed.

Wermuth, ed., Academic Press, San Diego, Calif., 1999.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention is intended to include all isotopes of atoms occurring in the present compounds. Isotopes include those atoms having the same atomic number but different mass numbers. By way of general example and without limitation, isotopes of hydrogen include deuterium and tritium. Isotopes of carbon include \n13\nC and \n14\nC. Isotopically-labeled compounds of the invention can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described herein, using an appropriate isotopically-labeled reagent in place of the non-labeled reagent otherwise employed. Such compounds have a variety of potential uses, e.g., as standards and reagents in determining the ability of a potential pharmaceutical compound to bind to target proteins or receptors, or for imaging compounds of this invention bound to biological receptors in vivo or in vitro.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the present invention are, subsequent to their preparation, preferably isolated and purified to obtain a composition containing an amount by weight equal to or greater than 98%, preferably 99%, compound of the present invention (“substantially pure”), which is then used or formulated as described herein. Such “substantially pure” compounds are also contemplated herein as part of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Stable compound” and “stable structure” are meant to indicate a compound that is sufficiently robust to survive isolation to a useful degree of purity from a reaction mixture, and formulation into an efficacious therapeutic agent. It is preferred that compounds of the present invention do not contain a N-halo, S(O)\n2\nH, or S(O)H group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “solvate” means a physical association of a compound of this invention with one or more solvent molecules, whether organic or inorganic. This physical association includes hydrogen bonding. In certain instances the solvate will be capable of isolation, for example when one or more solvent molecules are incorporated in the crystal lattice of the crystalline solid. The solvent molecules in the solvate may be present in a regular arrangement and/or a non-ordered arrangement. The solvate may comprise either a stoichiometric or nonstoichiometric amount of the solvent molecules. “Solvate” encompasses both solution-phase and isolable solvates. Exemplary solvates include, but are not limited to, hydrates, ethanolates, methanolates, and isopropanolates. Methods of solvation are generally known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAbbreviations as used herein, are defined as follows: “1×” for once, “2×” for twice, “3×” for thrice, “° C.” for degrees Celsius, “eq” for equivalent or equivalents, “g” for gram or grams, “mg” for milligram or milligrams, “L” for liter or liters, “mL” for milliliter or milliliters, “μL” for microliter or microliters, “N” for normal, “M” for molar, “mmol” for millimole or millimoles, “min” for minute or minutes, “h” for hour or hours, “rt” for room temperature, “RT” for retention time, “atm” for atmosphere, “psi” for pounds per square inch, “conc.” for concentrate, “sat” or “sat'd” for saturated, “MW” for molecular weight, “mp” for melting point, “ee” for enantiomeric excess, “MS” or “Mass Spec” for mass spectrometry, “ESI” for electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy, “HR” for high resolution, “HRMS” for high resolution mass spectrometry, “LCMS” for liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, “HPLC” for high pressure liquid chromatography, “RP HPLC” for reverse phase HPLC, “TLC” or “tic” for thin layer chromatography, “NMR” for nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, “\n1\nH” for proton, “6” for delta, “s” for singlet, “d” for doublet, “t” for triplet, “q” for quartet, “m” for multiplet, “br” for broad, “Hz” for hertz, and “α”, “β”, “R”, “S”, “E”, and “Z” are stereochemical designations familiar to one skilled in the art.\n\n \n \n \nMe methyl\n \nEt ethyl\n \nPr propyl\n \ni-Pr isopropyl\n \nBu butyl\n \ni-Bu isobutyl\n \nt-Bu tert-butyl\n \nPh phenyl\n \nBn benzyl\n \nAcOH acetic acid\n \nMeOH methanol\n \nEtOH ethanol\n \nEtOAc ethyl acetate\n \nEt\n2\nO diethyl ether\n \ni-PrOH or IPA isopropanol\n \nHOAc acetic acid\n \nBOP reagent benzotriazol-1-yloxytris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate\n \nBBr\n3 \nboron tribromide\n \nBoc tert-butyloxycarbonyl\n \n2MeS-ADP 2 methylthio adenosine diphosphate\n \ncDNA complimentary DNA\n \nCH\n2\nCl\n2 \ndichloromethane\n \nCH\n3\nCN acetonitrile\n \nCs\n2\nCO\n3 \ncesium carbonate\n \nACN acetonitrile\n \nCDI 1,1′-carbonyldiimidazole\n \nDCE 1,2 dichloroethane\n \nDCM dichloromethane\n \nDCC dicyclohexylcarbodiimide\n \nDIC or DIPCDI diisopropylcarbodiimide\n \nDIEA or DIPEA N,N,-diisopropylethylamine\n \nDME 1,2-dimethoxyethane\n \nDMF dimethyl formamide\n \nDMSO dimethyl sulfoxide\n \nEDC (or EDC.HCl) or EDCI (or EDCI.HCl) or EDAC\n    \n \n3-ethyl-3′-(dimethylamino)propyl-carbodiimide hydrochloride (or 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride)\n \n\n\n \nEDTA ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid\n \nHCl hydrochloric acid\n \nHEPES 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperaxine-1-ethanesulfonic acid\n \nHex hexane\n \nHOBt or HOBT 1-hydroxybenzotriazole monohydrate\n \nHunig's base N,N-diisopropylethyl amine\n \nLAH lithium aluminum hydride\n \nLDA Lithium diisopropylamide\n \nLiHMDS Lithium bis(trimethylsilyl) amide\n \nmCPBA or m-CPBA meta-chloroperbenzoic acid\n \nNBS N-bromosuccinimide\n \nNCS N-chlorosuccinimide\n \nD-PBS Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline\n \nPd/C palladium on carbon\n \nPS polystyrene\n \nTEA triethylamine\n \nTFA trifluoroacetic acid\n \nTHF tetrahydrofuran\n \nTRIS tris (hydroxymethyl)aminomethane\n \nKOAc potassium acetate\n \nK\n3\nPO\n4 \npotassium phosphate\n \nMgSO\n4 \nmagnesium sulfate\n \nNaCl sodium chloride\n \nNaH sodium hydride\n \nNaHCO\n3 \nsodium bicarbonate\n \nNaOH sodium hydroxide\n \nNa\n2\nSO\n3 \nsodium sulfite\n \nNa\n2\nSO\n4 \nsodium sulfate\n \nNH\n3 \nammonia\n \nNH\n4\nCl ammonium chloride\n \nNH\n4\nOH ammonium hydroxide\n \nOTf tirflate or trifluoromethanesulfonate\n \nOTs tosylate, para-toluenesulfonate\n \nPBr\n3 \nphosphorous tribromide\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention can be prepared in a number of ways known to one skilled in the art of organic synthesis. The compounds of the present invention can be synthesized using the methods described below, together with synthetic methods known in the art of synthetic organic chemistry, or by variations thereon as appreciated by those skilled in the art. Preferred methods include, but are not limited to, those described below. The reactions are performed in a solvent or solvent mixture appropriate to the reagents and materials employed and suitable for the transformations being effected. It will be understood by those skilled in the art of organic synthesis that the functionality present on the molecule should be consistent with the transformations proposed. This will sometimes require a judgment to modify the order of the synthetic steps or to select one particular process scheme over another in order to obtain a desired compound of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will also be recognized that another major consideration in the planning of any synthetic route in this field is the judicious choice of the protecting group used for protection of the reactive functional groups present in the compounds described in this invention. An authoritative account describing the many alternatives to the trained practitioner is Greene and Wuts (\nProtective Groups In Organic Synthesis\n, Wiley-Interscience, 3rd Edition, 1999).\n\n\n \nSynthesis\n\n\n \n \n \nAll references cited herein are hereby incorporated in their entirety herein by reference. Methods for synthesis of a large variety of substituted pyridazines and compounds useful as starting materials for the preparation of compounds of the present invention are well known in the art. (For examples of methods useful for the preparation of pyridazine starting materials see: \nPyridazines in The Chemistry of Heterocyclic Compounds\n, Castle, R. N., Ed.; John Wiley and Sons: New York, 1973, Vol. 28\n.; The Pyridazines in The Chemistry of Heterocyclic Compounds\n, Brown, D. J., Ed.; John Wiley and Sons: New York, 2000; Vol. 57, Supplement 1\n; Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry II\n, Vol. 6, Boulton, A. J., Ed., Elsevier Science Inc., New York, 1996, pp. 1-93).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRepresentative pyridazine compounds of this invention can be prepared as shown in Scheme 1. Using a modification of the Minisci reaction described by Cowden (\nOrg. Lett. \n2003, 5:4497-4499), a Cbz-protected amino acid 1a and 3,6-dichloropyridazine 1b can be coupled at elevated temperature in the presence of silver nitrate, ammonium persulfate, and an acid, such as trifluoroacetic acid, in a solvent, such as water or a water/dimethylformamide mixture, to give 1c. Pyridazinone 1d can also be formed under the reaction conditions as a side product. Suzuki coupling of either 1c or 1d with a suitably substituted aryl or heteroaryl boronic acid or ester 1e in the presence of a base such as potassium phosphate, in a solvent such as dioxane, using a precatalyst system such as bis(dibenzylideneacetone)palladium(0) and tri-t-butylphosphine provides either 1f or 1g. Deprotection of the Cbz group under a hydrogen atmosphere in the presence of a palladium catalyst such as palladium on carbon in a solvent such as methanol can be used to generate either amine 1 h or 1m. Amide coupling between either 1 h or l1 and an appropriately substituted carboxylic acid 1j, employing suitable coupling reagents, such as EDCI, HOBt, and base generates either 1n or 1o (for alternative coupling reagents see: Han, S—Y; Kim, Y-A. \nTetrahedron \n2004, 60:2447). Alternately, amines 1 h or 1m can be coupled with an activated carboxylic ester 1k in the presence of a base such as Hunig's base and in a solvent such as dimethylformamide to give 1n or 1o. Further manipulation of functional groups on R\n3 \nusing methods known to one skilled in the art of organic synthesis will give additional compounds of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt should be noted that other suitably protected amino acids can be employed in the Minisci reaction as described in Scheme 1.

Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction of 4b and a suitably substituted α-ketoester 4c, which is either commercially available or prepared using a modified procedure described by Domagala (\nTetrahedron Lett. \n21:4997-5000), in the presence of base such as potassium carbonate in a solvent such as ethanol or tetrahydrofuran gives α,β-unsaturated ketone derivative which can then be condensed with a suitably substituted hydrazine derivative, to give pyridazinone 4d.

Alternatively, ureas of formula 11c of this invention can be prepared by condensation of an amine 11a with carbonyldiimidazole in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or dimethylformamide followed by treatment in situ with a suitably substituted amine 11d. Urea linked compounds of this invention of formula 11c can also be prepared by condensation of amine intermediate 11a with p-nitrophenylchloroformate in the presence of a suitable base such as triethylamine, followed by treatment of the resulting p-nitrophenylcarbamate with an appropriately substituted amine 11d.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIsocyanates of formula 11b used in Scheme 11 are either commercially available or can be readily prepared from the corresponding amines 11d by treatment with phosgene or by various other methods known in the art (see for example, H. Eckert and B. Forster, \nAngew. Chem. Int. Ed. \n1987, 26:894; H. Knolker and T. Braxmeier, \nSynlett \n1997, 925; S. Porwanski et al. \nTetrahedron Lett. \n2004, 45:5027). Amines of formula 11d are also available commercially or can be prepared by those knowledgeable in the art from a variety of easily accessible starting materials such as nitriles, aldehydes, alcohols, halides, acids and esters by methods including, but not limited to those outlined in Scheme 12.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChiral amino acids useful for the synthesis of pyridazine and pyridazinone compounds of this invention are either commercially available or can be prepared by any of a number of methods known in the art. For example, as shown in Scheme 13, didehydroamino acid derivatives of formula 13c may be reduced to provide protected (S)-amino acids of formula 13d by hydrogenation in the presence of a chiral catalyst such as (S,S)-EtDuPhosRh(I) using a modified procedure of Burk (\nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n1991, 113:8518). Didehydroamino acid derivatives of formula 13c can be prepared via several methods, such as for example, a Heck coupling between an aryl iodide, bromide, or tosylate of formula 13a and Boc didehydroalanine benzyl ester, using a modified procedure of Carlström et al. (\nSynthesis \n1989, 414). Alternatively, protected didehydroaminoacids of formula 13c may be prepared by Horner-Emmons type condensation of an aldehyde of formula 13b with Boc-methyl-2-(dimethylphosphono)glycinate, using modifications of literature procedures (Wang et al., \nTetrahedron \n2002, 58:3101). Protected amino acids of formula 13d may also be prepared by alkylation of methyl 2-(diphenylmethyleneamino)acetate with an appropriately substituted benzyl bromide in the presence of a chiral cinchonidinium catalyst in a suitable solvent, such as methylene chloride, using a procedure similar to that described by O'Donnell et al. (\nTetrahedron \n1999, 55:6347), followed by mild acidic workup and reprotection of the amino functionality with a Boc group according to methods known to one skilled in the art. Substitution of heteroaryl bromides or iodides for 13a, heteroaryl, heterocyclic, or alkyl aldehydes for 13b, and heteroarylalkyl or alkylbromides for 13e in Scheme 13 would lead to additional chiral amino acids useful for the synthesis of pyridazine and pyridazinone compounds of this invention. For example, optionally substituted pyrazole carbaldehydes may be used in place of benzaldehydes 13b to give compounds of this invention wherein R\n11 \nis an optionally substituted pyrazolylmethyl group.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn cases where suitably substituted boronic acids are not commercially available, a modification to this approach may be adopted wherein an aryl halide is subjected to a palladium mediated coupling with a diboron species such as bis(pinacolato) diboron to provide the corresponding 4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-[1,3,2]dioxaborolane intermediate using the method of Ishiyama, T. et al. (\nJ. Org. Chem. \n1995, 60(23):7508-7510). Alternately, this same intermediate can be prepared by reaction of the intermediate halide with the corresponding dialkoxyhydroborane as described by Murata et al. (\nJ. Org. Chem. \n1997, 62(19):6458-6459). The boron pinacolate intermediates can be used in place of boronic acids for coupling to the aryl/heteroaryl halides or triflates or the boron pinacolate intermediate can be converted to the boronic acids. Alternately, the corresponding boronic acids can be prepared by metal-halogen exchange of the aryl/heteroaryl halide, quenching with a trialkoxyborate reagent, and aqueous workup to provide the boronic acids (Miyaura, N.; Suzuki, A. \nChem. Review \n1995, 95:2457).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, Scheme 14 describes the synthesis of a specific example of R\n3\n—B(OR)\n2 \n(1e) when R\n3 \nis a 4-hydroxy quinolinone moiety. Intramolecular Friedel-Craft acylation of 14a in the presence of an acid, such as polyphosphoric acid (PPA), at elevated temperature provides the 4-hydroxy quinolinone derivative 14b. Aryl bromide 14b is then subjected to a palladium mediated coupling with a diboron species such as bis(neopentyl glycolato)diboron to provide the corresponding boronate 14c using the method of Ishiyama, T. et al. (\nJ. Org. Chem. \n1995, 60(23):7508-7510). The boronate can be used in place of boronic acids for coupling to the aryl/heteroaryl halides or triflates or the boronate can be converted to the boronic acid.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also realized that the scope of intermediate synthesis can be further extended outside the use of Suzuki methodology since the precursor aryl halides described above are also precursors for Stille, Negishi, Hiyama, and Kumada-type cross coupling methodologies (Tsuji, J., \nTransition Metal Reagents and Catalysts: Innovations in Organic Synthesis\n, John Wiley & Sons, 2000; Tsuji, J., \nPalladium Reagents and Catalysts: Innovations in Organic Synthesis\n, John Wiley & Sons, 1996).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRepresentative examples of manipulation of functional groups on R\n3 \nusing methods known to one skilled in the art of organic synthesis are shown in Scheme 15.

Reacting 15a with acetohydroxamic acid and potassium tert-butoxide in DMF according to a modified procedure described by Palermo (\nTetrahedron Letters \n1996, 37(17):2885) provides 3-aminobenzisoxazole 15c. Alternately, heating 15a with formamidine acetate in DMA, according to a modified procedure described by Lam (\nJ. Med.

Biology\n\n\n \n \n \nWhile blood coagulation is essential to the regulation of an organism's hemostasis, it is also involved in many pathological conditions. In thrombosis, a blood clot, or thrombus, may form and obstruct circulation locally, causing ischemia and organ damage. Alternatively, in a process known as embolism, the clot may dislodge and subsequently become trapped in a distal vessel, where it again causes ischemia and organ damage. Diseases arising from pathological thrombus formation are collectively referred to as thromboembolic disorders and include acute coronary syndrome, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, thrombosis in the cavity of the heart, ischemic stroke, deep vein thrombosis, peripheral occlusive arterial disease, transient ischemic attack, and pulmonary embolism. In addition, thrombosis occurs on artificial surfaces in contact with blood, including catheters, stents, and artificial heart valves.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome conditions contribute to the risk of developing thrombosis. For example, alterations of the vessel wall, changes in the flow of blood, and alterations in the composition of the vascular compartment. These risk factors are collectively known as Virchow's triad. (\nHemostasis and Thrombosis, Basic Principles and Clinical Practice, \n5th Edition, p. 853, 2006, edited by Colman, R. W. et al. published by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntithrombotic agents are frequently given to patients at risk of developing thromboembolic disease because of the presence of one or more predisposing risk factors from Virchow's triad to prevent formation of an occlusive thrombus (primary prevention). For example, in an orthopedic surgery setting (e.g., hip and knee replacement), an antithrombotic agent is frequently administered prior to a surgical procedure. The antithrombotic agent counterbalances the prothrombotic stimulus exerted by vascular flow alterations (stasis), potential surgical vessel wall injury, as well as changes in the composition of the blood due to the acute phase response related to surgery. Another example of the use of an antithrombotic agent for primary prevention is dosing with aspirin, a platelet activation inhibitor, in patients at risk for developing thrombotic cardiovascular disease. Well recognized risk factors in this setting include age, male gender, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, lipid alterations, and obesity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntithrombotic agents are also indicated for secondary prevention, following an initial thrombotic episode. For example, patients with mutations in factor V (also known as factor V Leiden) and additional risk factors (e.g., pregnancy), are dosed with anticoagulants to prevent the reoccurrence of venous thrombosis. Another example entails secondary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with a history of acute myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome. In a clinical setting, a combination of aspirin and clopidogrel (or other thienopyridines) may be used to prevent a second thrombotic event.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntithrombotic agents are also given to treat the disease state (i.e., by arresting its development) after it has already started. For example, patients presenting with deep vein thrombosis are treated with anticoagulants (i.e., heparin, warfarin, or LMWH) to prevent further growth of the venous occlusion. Over time, these agents also cause a regression of the disease state because the balance between prothrombotic factors and anticoagulant/profibrinolytic pathways is changed in favor of the latter. Examples on the arterial vascular bed include the treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome with aspirin and clopidogrel to prevent further growth of vascular occlusions and eventually leading to a regression of thrombotic occlusions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, antithrombotic agents are used widely for primary and secondary prevention (i.e., prophylaxis or risk reduction) of thromboembolic disorders, as well as treatment of an already existing thrombotic process. Drugs that inhibit blood coagulation, or anticoagulants, are “pivotal agents for prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disorders” (Hirsh, J. et al., \nBlood \n2005, 105:453-463).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn alternative way of initiation of coagulation is operative when blood is exposed to artificial surfaces (e.g., during hemodialysis, ‘on-pump’ cardiovascular surgery, vessel grafts, bacterial sepsis), on cell surfaces, cellular receptors, cell debris, DNA, RNA, and extracellular matrices. This process is also termed contact activation. Surface absorption of factor XII leads to a conformational change in the factor XII molecule, thereby facilitating activation to proteolytic active factor XII molecules (factor XIIa and factor XIIf). Factor XIIa (or XIIf) has a number of target proteins, including plasma prekallikrein and factor XI. Active plasma kallikrein further activates factor XII, leading to an amplification of contact activation. Alternatively, the serine protease prolylcarboxylpeptidase can activate plasma kallikrein complexed with high molecular weight kininogen in a multiprotein complex formed on the surface of cells and matrices (Shariat-Madar et al., \nBlood \n2006, 108:192-199). Contact activation is a surface mediated process responsible in part for the regulation of thrombosis and inflammation, and is mediated, at least in part, by fibrinolytic-, complement-, kininogen/kinin-, and other humoral and cellular pathways (for review, Coleman, R., \nContact Activation Pathway\n, pp. 103-122 in \nHemostasis and Thrombosis\n, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2001; Schmaier A.H., \nContact Activation\n, pp. 105-128 in \nThrombosis and Hemorrhage, \n1998). The biological relevance of the contact activation system for thromboembolic diseases is supported by the phenotype of factor XII deficient mice. More specifically, factor XII deficient mice were protected from thrombotic vascular occlusion in several thrombosis models as well as stroke models and the phenotype of the XII deficient mice was identical to XI deficient mice (Renne et al., \nJ. Exp. Medicine \n2005, 202:271-281; Kleinschmitz et al., \nJ. Exp. Med. \n2006, 203:513-518). The fact that factor XI is down-stream from factor XIIa, combined with the identical phenotype of the XII and XI deficient mice suggest that the contact activation system could play a major role in factor XI activation in vivo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFactor XI is a zymogen of a trypsin-like serine protease and is present in plasma at a relatively low concentration. Proteolytic activation at an internal R369-I370 bond yields a heavy chain (369 amino acids) and a light chain (238 amino acids). The latter contains a typical trypsin-like catalytic triad (H413, D464, and S557). Activation of factor XI by thrombin is believed to occur on negatively charged surfaces, most likely on the surface of activated platelets. Platelets contain high affinity (0.8 nM) specific sites (130-500/platelet) for activated factor XI. After activation, factor XIa remains surface bound and recognizes factor IX as its normal macromolecular substrate. (Galiani, D., \nTrends Cardiovasc. Med. \n2000, 10:198-204.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the feedback activation mechanisms described above, thrombin activates thrombin activated fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI), a plasma carboxypeptidase that cleaves C-terminal lysine and arginine residues on fibrin, reducing the ability of fibrin to enhance tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) dependent plasminogen activation. In the presence of antibodies to FXIa, clot lysis can occur more rapidly independent of plasma TAFI concentration. (Bouma, B. N. et al., \nThromb. Res. \n2001, 101:329-354.) Thus, inhibitors of factor XIa are expected to be anticoagulant and profibrinolytic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther evidence for the anti-thromboembolic effects of targeting factor XI is derived from mice deficient in factor XI. It has been demonstrated that complete fXI deficiency protected mice from ferric chloride (FeCl\n3\n)-induced carotid artery thrombosis (Rosen et al., \nThromb. Haemost. \n2002, 87:774-777; Wang et al., \nJ. Thromb. Haemost. \n2005, 3:695-702). Also, factor XI deficiency rescues the perinatal lethal phenotype of complete protein C deficiency (Chan et al., \nAmer. J. Pathology \n2001, 158:469-479). Furthermore, baboon cross-reactive, function blocking antibodies to human factor XI protect against baboon arterial—venous shunt thrombosis (Gruber et al., \nBlood \n2003, 102:953-955). Evidence for an antithrombotic effect of small molecule inhibitors of factor XIa is also disclosed in published U.S. Patent Application No. US 2004/0180855A1. Taken together, these studies suggest that targeting factor XI will reduce the propensity for thrombotic and thromboembolic diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenetic evidence indicates that factor XI is not required for normal homeostasis, implying a superior safety profile of the factor XI mechanism compared to competing antithrombotic mechanisms. In contrast to hemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency) or hemophilia B (factor IX deficiency), mutations of the factor XI gene causing factor XI deficiency (hemophilia C) result in only a mild to moderate bleeding diathesis characterized primarily by postoperative or posttraumatic, but rarely spontaneous hemorrhage. Postoperative bleeding occurs mostly in tissue with high concentrations of endogenous fibrinolytic activity (e.g., oral cavity, and urogenital system). The majority of the cases are fortuitously identified by preoperative prolongation of aPTT (intrinsic system) without any prior bleeding history.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe increased safety of inhibition of XIa as an anticoagulation therapy is further supported by the fact that Factor XI knock-out mice, which have no detectable factor XI protein, undergo normal development, and have a normal life span. No evidence for spontaneous bleeding has been noted. The aPTT (intrinsic system) is prolonged in a gene dose-dependent fashion. Interestingly, even after severe stimulation of the coagulation system (tail transection), the bleeding time is not significantly prolonged compared to wild-type and heterozygous litter mates. (Gailani, D., \nFrontiers in Bioscience \n2001, 6:201-207; Gailani, D. et al., \nBlood Coagulation and Fibrinolysis \n1997, 8:134-144.) Taken together, these observations suggest that high levels of inhibition of factor XIa should be well tolerated. This is in contrast to gene targeting experiments with other coagulation factors, excluding factor XII.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn vivo activation of factor XI can be determined by complex formation with either Cl inhibitor or alpha 1 antitrypsin. In a study of 50 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), approximately 25% of the patients had values above the upper normal range of the complex ELISA. This study can be viewed as evidence that at least in a subpopulation of patients with AMI, factor XI activation contributes to thrombin formation (Minnema, M. C. et al., \nArterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. \n2000, 20:2489-2493). A second study establishes a positive correlation between the extent of coronary arteriosclerosis and factor XIa in complex with alpha 1 antitrypsin (Murakami, T. et al., \nArterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. \n1995, 15:1107-1113.). In another study, Factor XI levels above the 90th percentile in patients were associated with a 2.2-fold increased risk for venous thrombosis (Meijers, J. C. M. et al., \nN. Engl. J. Med. \n2000, 342:696-701.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPlasma kallikrein is a zymogen of a trypsin-like serine protease and is present in plasma at 35 to 50 μg/mL. The gene structure is similar to that of factor XI. Overall, the amino acid sequence of plasma kallikrein has 58% homology to factor XI. Proteolytic activation by factor XIIa at an internal I 389-R390 bond yields a heavy chain (371 amino acids) and a light chain (248 amino acids). The active site of plasma kallikrein is contained in the light chain. The light chain of plasma kallikrein reacts with protease inhibitors, including alpha 2 macroglobulin and C1-inhibitor. Interestingly, heparin significantly accelerates the inhibition of plasma kallikrein by antithrombin III in the presence of high molecular weight kininogen (HMWK). In blood, the majority of plasma kallikrein circulates in complex with HMWK. Plasma kallikrein cleaves HMWK to liberate bradykinin. Bradykinin release results in increase of vascular permeability and vasodilation (for review, Coleman, R., \nContact Activation Pathway\n, pp. 103-122 in \nHemostasis and Thrombosis\n, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2001; Schmaier A. H., \nContact Activation\n, pp. 105-128 in \nThrombosis and Hemorrhage, \n1998).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, it is preferred to find new compounds with improved activity in in vitro clotting assays, compared with known serine protease inhibitors, such as the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) or prothrombin time (PT) assay. (for a description of the aPTT and PT assays see, Goodnight, S. H., Hathaway, W. E., \nScreening Tests of Hemostasis in Disorders of Thrombosis and Hemostasis: A Clinical Guide, \n2nd Edition, McGraw-Hill: New York, 2001, pp. 41-51).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also desirable and preferable to find compounds with advantageous and improved characteristics compared with known serine protease inhibitors, in one or more of the following categories that are given as examples, and are not intended to be limiting: (a) pharmacokinetic properties, including oral bioavailability, half life, and clearance; (b) pharmaceutical properties; (c) dosage requirements; (d) factors that decrease blood concentration peak-to-trough characteristics; (e) factors that increase the concentration of active drug at the receptor; (f) factors that decrease the liability for clinical drug-drug interactions; (g) factors that decrease the potential for adverse side-effects, including selectivity versus other biological targets; and (h) factors that improve manufacturing costs or feasibility.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPre-clinical studies demonstrated significant antithrombotic effects of small molecule factor XIa inhibitors in rabbit and rat model of arterial thrombosis, at doses that preserved hemostasis. (Wong P. C. et al., \nAmerican Heart Association Scientific Sessions\n, Nov. 12-15, 2006, Abstract No. 6118; Schumacher, W. et al., \nJournal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis \n2005, Vol. 3, Supplement 1: P1228; Schumacher, W. A. et al., \nEuropean Journal of Pharmacology\n, in press). Furthermore, it was observed that in vitro prolongation of the aPTT by specific XIa inhibitors is a good predictor of efficacy in our thrombosis models. Thus, the in vitro aPTT test can be used as a surrogate for efficacy in vivo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “patient” encompasses all mammalian species.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “treating” or “treatment” cover the treatment of a disease-state in a mammal, particularly in a human, and include: (a) inhibiting the disease-state, i.e., arresting it development; and/or (b) relieving the disease-state, i.e., causing regression of the disease state.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “prophylaxis” or ‘prevention’ cover the preventive treatment of a subclinical disease-state in a mammal, particularly in a human, aimed at reducing the probability of the occurrence of a clinical disease-state. Patients are selected for preventative therapy based on factors that are known to increase risk of suffering a clinical disease state compared to the general population. “Prophylaxis” therapies can be divided into (a) primary prevention and (b) secondary prevention. Primary prevention is defined as treatment in a subject that has not yet presented with a clinical disease state, whereas secondary prevention is defined as preventing a second occurrence of the same or similar clinical disease state.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “risk reduction” covers therapies that lower the incidence of development of a clinical disease state. As such, primary and secondary prevention therapies are examples of risk reduction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Therapeutically effective amount” is intended to include an amount of a compound of the present invention that is effective when administered alone or in combination to inhibit factor XIa and/or plasma kallikrein and/or to prevent or treat the disorders listed herein. When applied to a combination, the term refers to combined amounts of the active ingredients that result in the preventive or therapeutic effect, whether administered in combination, serially, or simultaneously.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “thrombosis”, as used herein, refers to formation or presence of a thrombus (pl. thrombi); clotting within a blood vessel that may cause ischemia or infarction of tissues supplied by the vessel. The term “embolism”, as used herein, refers to sudden blocking of an artery by a clot or foreign material that has been brought to its site of lodgment by the blood current. The term “thromboembolism”, as used herein, refers to obstruction of a blood vessel with thrombotic material carried by the blood stream from the site of origin to plug another vessel. The term “thromboembolic disorders” entails both “thrombotic” and “embolic” disorders (defined above).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “thromboembolic disorders” as used herein includes arterial cardiovascular thromboembolic disorders, venous cardiovascular or cerebrovascular thromboembolic disorders, and thromboembolic disorders in the chambers of the heart or in the peripheral circulation. The term “thromboembolic disorders” as used herein also includes specific disorders selected from, but not limited to, unstable angina or other acute coronary syndromes, atrial fibrillation, first or recurrent myocardial infarction, ischemic sudden death, transient ischemic attack, stroke, atherosclerosis, peripheral occlusive arterial disease, venous thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, arterial embolism, coronary arterial thrombosis, cerebral arterial thrombosis, cerebral embolism, kidney embolism, pulmonary embolism, and thrombosis resulting from medical implants, devices, or procedures in which blood is exposed to an artificial surface that promotes thrombosis. The medical implants or devices include, but are not limited to: prosthetic valves, artificial valves, indwelling catheters, stents, blood oxygenators, shunts, vascular access ports, ventricular assist devices and artificial hearts or heart chambers, and vessel grafts. The procedures include, but are not limited to: cardiopulmonary bypass, percutaneous coronary intervention, and hemodialysis. In another embodiment, the term “thromboembolic disorders” includes acute coronary syndrome, stroke, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for the treatment of a thromboembolic disorder, wherein the thromboembolic disorder is selected from unstable angina, an acute coronary syndrome, atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack, stroke, atherosclerosis, peripheral occlusive arterial disease, venous thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, arterial embolism, coronary arterial thrombosis, cerebral arterial thrombosis, cerebral embolism, kidney embolism, pulmonary embolism, and thrombosis resulting from medical implants, devices, or procedures in which blood is exposed to an artificial surface that promotes thrombosis. In another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for the treatment of a thromboembolic disorder, wherein the thromboembolic disorder is selected from acute coronary syndrome, stroke, venous thrombosis, atrial fibrillation, and thrombosis resulting from medical implants and devices.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for the primary prophylaxis of a thromboembolic disorder, wherein the thromboembolic disorder is selected from unstable angina, an acute coronary syndrome, atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, ischemic sudden death, transient ischemic attack, stroke, atherosclerosis, peripheral occlusive arterial disease, venous thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, arterial embolism, coronary arterial thrombosis, cerebral arterial thrombosis, cerebral embolism, kidney embolism, pulmonary embolism, and thrombosis resulting from medical implants, devices, or procedures in which blood is exposed to an artificial surface that promotes thrombosis. In another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for the primary prophylaxis of a thromboembolic disorder, wherein the thromboembolic disorder is selected from acute coronary syndrome, stroke, venous thrombosis, and thrombosis resulting from medical implants and devices.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for the secondary prophylaxis of a thromboembolic disorder, wherein the thromboembolic disorder is selected from unstable angina, an acute coronary syndrome, atrial fibrillation, recurrent myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack, stroke, atherosclerosis, peripheral occlusive arterial disease, venous thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, arterial embolism, coronary arterial thrombosis, cerebral arterial thrombosis, cerebral embolism, kidney embolism, pulmonary embolism, and thrombosis resulting from medical implants, devices, or procedures in which blood is exposed to an artificial surface that promotes thrombosis. In another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for the secondary prophylaxis of a thromboembolic disorder, wherein the thromboembolic disorder is selected from acute coronary syndrome, stroke, atrial fibrillation and venous thrombosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “stroke”, as used herein, refers to embolic stroke or atherothrombotic stroke arising from occlusive thrombosis in the carotid communis, carotid interna, or intracerebral arteries.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is noted that thrombosis includes vessel occlusion (e.g., after a bypass) and reocclusion (e.g., during or after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty). The thromboembolic disorders may result from conditions including but not limited to atherosclerosis, surgery or surgical complications, prolonged immobilization, arterial fibrillation, congenital thrombophilia, cancer, diabetes, effects of medications or hormones, and complications of pregnancy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThromboembolic disorders are frequently associated with patients with atherosclerosis. Risk factors for atherosclerosis include but are not limited to male gender, age, hypertension, lipid disorders, and diabetes mellitus. Risk factors for atherosclerosis are at the same time risk factors for complications of atherosclerosis, i.e., thromboembolic disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilarly, arterial fibrillation is frequently associated with thromboembolic disorders. Risk factors for arterial fibrillation and subsequent thromboembolic disorders include cardiovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease, nonrheumatic mitral valve disease, hypertensive cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, and a variety of miscellaneous cardiac abnormalities as well as thyrotoxicosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiabetes mellitus is frequently associated with atherosclerosis and thromboembolic disorders. Risk factors for the more common type 2 include but are not limited to are family history, obesity, physical inactivity, race/ethnicity, previously impaired fasting glucose or glucose tolerance test, history of gestational diabetes mellitus or delivery of a ‘big baby’, hypertension, low HDL cholesterol, and polycystic ovary syndrome.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRisk factor for congenital thrombophilia include gain of function mutations in coagulation factors or loss of function mutations in the anticoagulant- or fibrinolytic pathways.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThrombosis has been associated with a variety of tumor types, e.g., pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, brain tumors, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, gastrointestinal malignancies, and Hodgkins or non-Hodgkins lymphoma. Recent studies suggest that the frequency of cancer in patients with thrombosis reflects the frequency of a particular cancer type in the general population (Levitan, N. et al., \nMedicine \n(Baltimore) 1999, 78(5):285-291; Levine M. et al., \nN Engl. J. Med. \n1996, 334(11):677-681; Blom, J. W. et al., \nJAMA \n2005, 293(6):715-722). Hence, the most common cancers associated with thrombosis in men are prostate, colorectal, brain, and lung cancer, and in women are breast, ovary, and lung cancer. The observed rate of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in cancer patients is significant. The varying rates of VTE between different tumor types are most likely related to the selection of the patient population. Cancer patients at risk for thrombosis may possess any or all of the following risk factors: (i) the stage of the cancer (i.e., presence of metastases), (ii) the presence of central vein catheters, (iii) surgery and anticancer therapies including chemotherapy, and (iv) hormones and antiangiogenic drugs. Thus, it is common clinical practice to dose patients having advanced tumors with heparin or low molecular heparin to prevent thromboembolic disorders. A number of low molecular heparin preparations have been approved by the FDA for these indications.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are three main clinical situations when considering the prevention of VTE in a medical cancer patient: (i) the patient is bedridden for prolonged periods of time; (ii) the ambulatory patient is receiving chemotherapy or radiation; and (iii) the patient is with indwelling central vein catheters. Unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) are effective antithrombotic agents in cancer patients undergoing surgery. (Mismetti, P. et al., \nBritish Journal of Surgery \n2001, 88:913-930.)\n\n\n \nA. In Vitro Assays\n\n\n \n \n \nThe effectiveness of compounds of the present invention as inhibitors of the coagulation factors XIa, VIIa, IXa, Xa, XIIa, plasma kallikrein or thrombin, can be determined using a relevant purified serine protease, respectively, and an appropriate synthetic substrate. The rate of hydrolysis of the chromogenic or fluorogenic substrate by the relevant serine protease was measured both in the absence and presence of compounds of the present invention. Hydrolysis of the substrate resulted in the release of pNA (para nitroaniline), which was monitored spectrophotometrically by measuring the increase in absorbance at 405 nm, or the release of AMC (amino methylcoumarin), which was monitored spectrofluorometrically by measuring the increase in emission at 460 nm with excitation at 380 nm. A decrease in the rate of absorbance or fluorescence change in the presence of inhibitor is indicative of enzyme inhibition. Such methods are known to one skilled in the art. The results of this assay are expressed as the inhibitory constant, K\ni\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFactor XIa determinations were made in 50 mM HEPES buffer at pH 7.4 containing 145 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, and 0.1% PEG 8000 (polyethylene glycol; JT Baker or Fisher Scientific). Determinations were made using purified human Factor XIa at a final concentration of 75-200 pM (Haematologic Technologies) and the synthetic substrate S-2366 (pyroGlu-Pro-Arg-pNA; Chromogenix or AnaSpec) at a concentration of 0.0002-0.001 M.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFactor VIIa determinations were made in 0.005 M calcium chloride, 0.15 M sodium chloride, 0.05 M HEPES buffer containing 0.1% PEG 8000 at a pH of 7.5. Determinations were made using purified human Factor VIIa (Haematologic Technologies) or recombinant human Factor VIIa (Novo Nordisk) at a final assay concentration of 1-5 nM, recombinant soluble tissue factor at a concentration of 10-40 nM and the synthetic substrate H-D-Ile-Pro-Arg-pNA (S-2288; Chromogenix or BMPM-2; AnaSpec) at a concentration of 0.001-0.0075 M.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFactor IXa determinations were made in 0.005 M calcium chloride, 0.1 M sodium chloride, 0.0001 M Refludan (Berlex), 0.05 M TRIS base and 0.5% PEG 8000 at a pH of 7.4. Refludan was added to inhibit small amounts of thrombin in the commercial preparations of human Factor IXa. Determinations were made using purified human Factor IXa (Haematologic Technologies) at a final assay concentration of 20-100 nM and the synthetic substrate PCIXA2100-B (CenterChem) or Pefafluor IXa 3688 (H-D-Leu-Ph'Gly-Arg-AMC; CenterChem) at a concentration of 0.0004-0.0005 M.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFactor Xa determinations were made in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer at a pH of 7.5 containing 0.2 M sodium chloride and 0.5% PEG 8000. Determinations were made using purified human Factor Xa (Haematologic Technologies) at a final assay concentration of 150-1000 pM and the synthetic substrate S-2222 (Bz-Ile-Glu (gamma-OMe, 50%)-Gly-Arg-pNA; Chromogenix) at a concentration of 0.0002-0.00035 M.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFactor XIIa determinations were made in 50 mM HEPES buffer at pH 7.4 containing 145 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, and 0.1% PEG 8000. Determinations were made using purified human Factor XIIa at a final concentration of 4 nM (American Diagnostica) and the synthetic substrate Spectrozyme #312 (pyroGlu-Pro-Arg-pNA; American Diagnostica) at a concentration of 0.00015 M.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPlasma kallikrein determinations were made in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer at a pH of 7.5 containing 0.1-0.2 M sodium chloride and 0.5% PEG 8000. Determinations were made using purified human kallikrein (Enzyme Research Laboratories) at a final assay concentration of 200 pM and the synthetic substrate S-2302 (H-(D)-Pro-Phe-Arg-pNA; Chromogenix) at a concentration of 0.00008-0.0004 M. The Km value used for calculation of Ki was 0.00005 to 0.00007 M.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThrombin determinations were made in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer at a pH of 7.5 containing 0.2 M sodium chloride and 0.5% PEG 8000. Determinations were made using purified human alpha thrombin (Haematologic Technologies or Enzyme Research Laboratories) at a final assay concentration of 200-250 pM and the synthetic substrate S-2366 (pyroGlu-Pro-Arg-pNA; Chromogenix) at a concentration of 0.0002-0.00026 M.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Michaelis constant, K\nm\n, for substrate hydrolysis by each protease, was determined at 25° C. using the method of Lineweaver and Burk. Values of K\ni \nwere determined by allowing the protease to react with the substrate in the presence of the inhibitor. Reactions were allowed to go for periods of 20-180 minutes (depending on the protease) and the velocities (rate of absorbance or fluorescence change versus time) were measured. The following relationships were used to calculate K\ni \nvalues:\n\n\n \n \n \n(\nv\n \no\n \n−v\n \ns\n)/\nv\n \ns\n \n=I\n/(\nK\n \ni\n(1+\nS/K\n \nm\n)) for a competitive inhibitor with one binding site;\n\n\n \n \n \nor\n\n\n \n \n \n \nv\n \ns\n \n/v\n \no\n \n=A\n+((\nB−A\n)/1+((\nIC\n \n50\n/(\nI\n)\nn\n))); and\n\n\n \n \n \n \nK\n \ni\n \n=IC\n \n50\n/(1+\nS/K\n \nm\n) for a competitive inhibitor\n\n\n \n \nwhere:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nv\no \nis the velocity of the control in the absence of inhibitor;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nv\ns \nis the velocity in the presence of inhibitor;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nI is the concentration of inhibitor;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA is the minimum activity remaining (usually locked at zero);\n\n\n \n \n \n \nB is the maximum activity remaining (usually locked at 1.0);\n\n\n \n \n \n \nn is the Hill coefficient, a measure of the number and cooperativity of potential inhibitor binding sites;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIC\n50 \nis the concentration of inhibitor that produces 50% inhibition under the assay conditions;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nK\ni \nis the dissociation constant of the enzyme:inhibitor complex;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nS is the concentration of substrate; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \nK\nm \nis the Michaelis constant for the substrate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe selectivity of a compound may be evaluated by taking the ratio of the K\ni \nvalue for a given protease with the K\ni \nvalue for the protease of interest (i.e., selectivity for FXIa versus protease P=K\ni \nfor protease P/K\ni \nfor FXIa). Compounds with selectivity ratios >20 are considered selective. Compounds with selectivity ratios >100 are preferred, and compounds with selectivity ratios >500 are more preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effectiveness of compounds of the present invention as inhibitors of coagulation can be determined using a standard or modified clotting assay. An increase in the plasma clotting time in the presence of inhibitor is indicative of anticoagulation. Relative clotting time is the clotting time in the presence of an inhibitor divided by the clotting time in the absence of an inhibitor. The results of this assay may be expressed as IC1.5x or IC2x, the inhibitor concentration required to increase the clotting time by 50 or 100 percent, respectively. The IC1.5x or IC2x is found by linear interpolation from relative clotting time versus inhibitor concentration plots using inhibitor concentration that spans the IC1.5x or IC2x.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nClotting times are determined using citrated normal human plasma as well as plasma obtained from a number of laboratory animal species (e.g., rat, or rabbit). A compound is diluted into plasma beginning with a 10 mM DMSO stock solution. The final concentration of DMSO is less than 2%. Plasma clotting assays are performed in an automated coagulation analyzer (Sysmex, Dade-Behring, Ill.). Similarly, clotting times can be determined from laboratory animal species or humans dosed with compounds of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nActivated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) is determined using Alexin (Trinity Biotech, Ireland) following the directions in the package insert. Plasma (0.05 mL) is warmed to 37° C. for 1 minute. Alexin (0.05 mL) is added to the plasma and incubated for an additional 2 to 5 minutes. Calcium chloride (25 mM, 0.05 mL) is added to the reaction to initiate coagulation. The clotting time is the time in seconds from the moment calcium chloride is added until a clot is detected.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProthrombin Time (PT) is determined using thromboplastin (Thromboplastin C Plus, Dade-Behring, Ill.) following the directions in the package insert. Plasma (0.05 mL) is warmed to 37° C. for 1 minute. Thromboplastin (0.1 mL) is added to the plasma to initiate coagulation. The clotting time is the time in seconds from the moment thromboplastin is added until a clot is detected.\n\n\n \nB. In Vivo Assays\n\n\n \n \n \nThe effectiveness of compounds of the present invention as antithrombotic agents can be determined using relevant in vivo thrombosis models, including In Vivo Electrically-induced Carotid Artery Thrombosis Models and In Vivo Rabbit Arterio-venous Shunt Thrombosis Models.\n\n\n \n \na. In Vivo Electrically-induced Carotid Artery Thrombosis (ECAT) Model\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe rabbit ECAT model, described by Wong et al. (\nJ. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. \n2000, 295:212-218), can be used in this study. Male New Zealand White rabbits are anesthetized with ketamine (50 mg/kg+50 mg/kg/h IM) and xylazine (10 mg/kg+10 mg/kg/h IM). These anesthetics are supplemented as needed. An electromagnetic flow probe is placed on a segment of an isolated carotid artery to monitor blood flow. Test agents or vehicle will be given (i.v., i.p., s.c., or orally) prior to or after the initiation of thrombosis. Drug treatment prior to initiation of thrombosis is used to model the ability of test agents to prevent and reduce the risk of thrombus formation, whereas dosing after initiation is used to model the ability to treat existing thrombotic disease. Thrombus formation is induced by electrical stimulation of the carotid artery for 3 min at 4 mA using an external stainless-steel bipolar electrode. Carotid blood flow is measured continuously over a 90-min period to monitor thrombus-induced occlusion. Total carotid blood flow over 90 min is calculated by the trapezoidal rule. Average carotid flow over 90 min is then determined by converting total carotid blood flow over 90 min to percent of total control carotid blood flow, which would result if control blood flow had been maintained continuously for 90 min. The ED\n50 \n(dose that increased average carotid blood flow over 90 min to 50% of the control) of compounds are estimated by a nonlinear least square regression program using the Hill sigmoid E\nmax \nequation (DeltaGraph; SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill.).\n\n\n \n \nb. In Vivo Rabbit Arterio-venous (AV) Shunt Thrombosis Model\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe rabbit AV shunt model, described by Wong et al. (Wong, P. C. et al., \nJ. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. \n2000, 292:351-357), can be used in this study. Male New Zealand White rabbits are anesthetized with ketamine (50 mg/kg+50 mg/kg/h IM) and xylazine (10 mg/kg+10 mg/kg/h IM). These anesthetics are supplemented as needed. The femoral artery, jugular vein and femoral vein are isolated and catheterized. A saline-filled AV shunt device is connected between the femoral arterial and the femoral venous cannulae. The AV shunt device consists of an outer piece of tygon tubing (length=8 cm; internal diameter=7.9 mm) and an inner piece of tubing (length=2.5 cm; internal diameter=4.8 mm) The AV shunt also contains an 8-cm-long 2-0 silk thread (Ethicon, Somerville, N.J.). Blood flows from the femoral artery via the AV-shunt into the femoral vein. The exposure of flowing blood to a silk thread induces the formation of a significant thrombus. Forty minutes later, the shunt is disconnected and the silk thread covered with thrombus is weighed. Test agents or vehicle will be given (i.v., i.p., s.c., or orally) prior to the opening of the AV shunt. The percentage inhibition of thrombus formation is determined for each treatment group. The ID\n50 \nvalues (dose that produces 50% inhibition of thrombus formation) are estimated by a nonlinear least square regression program using the Hill sigmoid E\nmax \nequation (DeltaGraph; SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-inflammatory effect of these compounds can be demonstrated in an Evans Blue dye extravasation assay using C1-esterase inhibitor deficient mice. In this model, mice are dosed with a compound of the present invention, Evans Blue dye is injected via the tail vein, and extravasation of the blue dye is determined by spectrophotometric means from tissue extracts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ability of the compounds of the current invention to reduce or prevent the systemic inflammatory response syndrome, for example, as observed during on-pump cardiovascular procedures, can be tested in in vitro perfusion systems, or by on-pump surgical procedures in larger mammals, including dogs and baboons. Read-outs to assess the benefit of the compounds of the present invention include for example reduced platelet loss, reduced platelet/white blood cell complexes, reduced neutrophil elastase levels in plasma, reduced activation of complement factors, and reduced activation and/or consumption of contact activation proteins (plasma kallikrein, factor XII, factor XI, high molecular weight kininogen, C1-esterase inhibitors).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention may also be useful as inhibitors of additional serine proteases, notably human thrombin, human plasma kallikrein and human plasmin. Because of their inhibitory action, these compounds are indicated for use in the prevention or treatment of physiological reactions, including blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, blood pressure regulation and inflammation, and wound healing catalyzed by the aforesaid class of enzymes. Specifically, the compounds have utility as drugs for the treatment of diseases arising from elevated thrombin activity of the aforementioned serine proteases, such as myocardial infarction, and as reagents used as anticoagulants in the processing of blood to plasma for diagnostic and other commercial purposes.\n\n\n \nV. Pharmaceutical Compositions, Formulations and Combinations\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds of this invention can be administered in such oral dosage forms as tablets, capsules (each of which includes sustained release or timed release formulations), pills, powders, granules, elixirs, tinctures, suspensions, syrups, and emulsions. They may also be administered in intravenous (bolus or infusion), intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, or intramuscular form, all using dosage forms well known to those of ordinary skill in the pharmaceutical arts. They can be administered alone, but generally will be administered with a pharmaceutical carrier selected on the basis of the chosen route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutical composition” means a composition comprising a compound of the invention in combination with at least one additional pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. A “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” refers to media generally accepted in the art for the delivery of biologically active agents to animals, in particular, mammals, including, i.e., adjuvant, excipient or vehicle, such as diluents, preserving agents, fillers, flow regulating agents, disintegrating agents, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, suspending agents, sweetening agents, flavoring agents, perfuming agents, antibacterial agents, antifungal agents, lubricating agents and dispensing agents, depending on the nature of the mode of administration and dosage forms. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are formulated according to a number of factors well within the purview of those of ordinary skill in the art. These include, without limitation: the type and nature of the active agent being formulated; the subject to which the agent-containing composition is to be administered; the intended route of administration of the composition; and the therapeutic indication being targeted. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include both aqueous and non-aqueous liquid media, as well as a variety of solid and semi-solid dosage forms. Such carriers can include a number of different ingredients and additives in addition to the active agent, such additional ingredients being included in the formulation for a variety of reasons, e.g., stabilization of the active agent, binders, etc., well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Descriptions of suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, and factors involved in their selection, are found in a variety of readily available sources such as, for example, \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, \n18th Edition, 1990.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dosage regimen for the compounds of the present invention will, of course, vary depending upon known factors, such as the pharmacodynamic characteristics of the particular agent and its mode and route of administration; the species, age, sex, health, medical condition, and weight of the recipient; the nature and extent of the symptoms; the kind of concurrent treatment; the frequency of treatment; the route of administration, the renal and hepatic function of the patient, and the effect desired. A physician or veterinarian can determine and prescribe the effective amount of the drug required to prevent, counter, or arrest the progress of the thromboembolic disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy way of general guidance, the daily oral dosage of each active ingredient, when used for the indicated effects, will range between about 0.001 to about 1000 mg/kg of body weight, preferably between about 0.01 to about 100 mg/kg of body weight per day, and most preferably between about 0.1 to about 20 mg/kg/day. Intravenously, the most preferred doses will range from about 0.001 to about 10 mg/kg/minute during a constant rate infusion. Compounds of this invention may be administered in a single daily dose, or the total daily dosage may be administered in divided doses of two, three, or four times daily.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of this invention can also be administered by parenteral administration (e.g., intra-venous, intra-arterial, intra-musculary, or sub-cutaneously. When administered intra-venous or intra-arterial, the dose can be given continuously or intermittent. Furthermore, formulation can be developed for intramusculary and subcutaneous delivery that ensure a gradual release of the active pharmaceutical ingredient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of this invention can be administered in intranasal form via topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles, or via transdermal routes, using transdermal skin patches. When administered in the form of a transdermal delivery system, the dosage administration will, of course, be continuous rather than intermittent throughout the dosage regimen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds are typically administered in admixture with suitable pharmaceutical diluents, excipients, or carriers (collectively referred to herein as pharmaceutical carriers) suitably selected with respect to the intended form of administration, e.g., oral tablets, capsules, elixirs, and syrups, and consistent with conventional pharmaceutical practices.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor instance, for oral administration in the form of a tablet or capsule, the active drug component can be combined with an oral, non-toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable, inert carrier such as lactose, starch, sucrose, glucose, methyl cellulose, magnesium stearate, dicalcium phosphate, calcium sulfate, mannitol, sorbitol and the like; for oral administration in liquid form, the oral drug components can be combined with any oral, non-toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable inert carrier such as ethanol, glycerol, water, and the like. Moreover, when desired or necessary, suitable binders, lubricants, disintegrating agents, and coloring agents can also be incorporated into the mixture. Suitable binders include starch, gelatin, natural sugars such as glucose or beta-lactose, corn sweeteners, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, tragacanth, or sodium alginate, carboxymethylcellulose, polyethylene glycol, waxes, and the like. Lubricants used in these dosage forms include sodium oleate, sodium stearate, magnesium stearate, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium chloride, and the like. Disintegrators include, without limitation, starch, methyl cellulose, agar, bentonite, xanthan gum, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention can also be administered in the form of liposome delivery systems, such as small unilamellar vesicles, large unilamellar vesicles, and multilamellar vesicles. Liposomes can be formed from a variety of phospholipids, such as cholesterol, stearylamine, or phosphatidylcholines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the present invention may also be coupled with soluble polymers as targetable drug carriers. Such polymers can include polyvinylpyrrolidone, pyran copolymer, polyhydroxypropylmethacrylamide-phenol, polyhydroxyethylaspartamidephenol, or polyethyleneoxide-polylysine substituted with palmitoyl residues. Furthermore, the compounds of the present invention may be coupled to a class of biodegradable polymers useful in achieving controlled release of a drug, for example, polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, copolymers of polylactic and polyglycolic acid, polyepsilon caprolactone, polyhydroxy butyric acid, polyorthoesters, polyacetals, polydihydropyrans, polycyanoacylates, and crosslinked or amphipathic block copolymers of hydrogels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDosage forms (pharmaceutical compositions) suitable for administration may contain from about 1 milligram to about 1000 milligrams of active ingredient per dosage unit. In these pharmaceutical compositions the active ingredient will ordinarily be present in an amount of about 0.1-95% by weight based on the total weight of the composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGelatin capsules may contain the active ingredient and powdered carriers, such as lactose, starch, cellulose derivatives, magnesium stearate, stearic acid, and the like. Similar diluents can be used to make compressed tablets. Both tablets and capsules can be manufactured as sustained release products to provide for continuous release of medication over a period of hours. Compressed tablets can be sugar coated or film coated to mask any unpleasant taste and protect the tablet from the atmosphere, or enteric coated for selective disintegration in the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiquid dosage forms for oral administration can contain coloring and flavoring to increase patient acceptance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, water, a suitable oil, saline, aqueous dextrose (glucose), and related sugar solutions and glycols such as propylene glycol or polyethylene glycols are suitable carriers for parenteral solutions. Solutions for parenteral administration preferably contain a water soluble salt of the active ingredient, suitable stabilizing agents, and if necessary, buffer substances. Antioxidizing agents such as sodium bisulfate, sodium sulfite, or ascorbic acid, either alone or combined, are suitable stabilizing agents. Also used are citric acid and its salts and sodium EDTA. In addition, parenteral solutions can contain preservatives, such as benzalkonium chloride, methyl-or propyl-paraben, and chlorobutanol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences\n, Mack Publishing Company, a standard reference text in this field.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere the compounds of this invention are combined with other anticoagulant agents, for example, a daily dosage may be about 0.1 to about 100 milligrams of the compound of the present invention and about 0.1 to about 100 milligrams per kilogram of patient body weight. For a tablet dosage form, the compounds of this invention generally may be present in an amount of about 5 to about 100 milligrams per dosage unit, and the second anti-coagulant in an amount of about 1 to about 50 milligrams per dosage unit.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere the compounds of the present invention are administered in combination with an anti-platelet agent, by way of general guidance, typically a daily dosage may be about 0.01 to about 25 milligrams of the compound of the present invention and about 50 to about 150 milligrams of the anti-platelet agent, preferably about 0.1 to about 1 milligrams of the compound of the present invention and about 1 to about 3 milligrams of antiplatelet agents, per kilogram of patient body weight.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere the compounds of the present invention are administered in combination with thrombolytic agent, typically a daily dosage may be about 0.1 to about 1 milligrams of the compound of the present invention, per kilogram of patient body weight and, in the case of the thrombolytic agents, the usual dosage of the thrombolyic agent when administered alone may be reduced by about 50-80% when administered with a compound of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParticularly when provided as a single dosage unit, the potential exists for a chemical interaction between the combined active ingredients. For this reason, when the compound of the present invention and a second therapeutic agent are combined in a single dosage unit they are formulated such that although the active ingredients are combined in a single dosage unit, the physical contact between the active ingredients is minimized (that is, reduced). For example, one active ingredient may be enteric coated. By enteric coating one of the active ingredients, it is possible not only to minimize the contact between the combined active ingredients, but also, it is possible to control the release of one of these components in the gastrointestinal tract such that one of these components is not released in the stomach but rather is released in the intestines. One of the active ingredients may also be coated with a material that affects a sustained-release throughout the gastrointestinal tract and also serves to minimize physical contact between the combined active ingredients. Furthermore, the sustained-released component can be additionally enteric coated such that the release of this component occurs only in the intestine. Still another approach would involve the formulation of a combination product in which the one component is coated with a sustained and/or enteric release polymer, and the other component is also coated with a polymer such as a low viscosity grade of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) or other appropriate materials as known in the art, in order to further separate the active components. The polymer coating serves to form an additional barrier to interaction with the other component.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese as well as other ways of minimizing contact between the components of combination products of the present invention, whether administered in a single dosage form or administered in separate forms but at the same time by the same manner, will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, once armed with the present disclosure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition further comprising additional therapeutic agent(s) selected from potassium channel openers, potassium channel blockers, calcium channel blockers, sodium hydrogen exchanger inhibitors, antiarrhythmic agents, antiatherosclerotic agents, anticoagulants, antithrombotic agents, prothrombolytic agents, fibrinogen antagonists, diuretics, antihypertensive agents, ATPase inhibitors, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, antidiabetic agents, anti-inflammatory agents, antioxidants, angiogenesis modulators, antiosteoporosis agents, hormone replacement therapies, hormone receptor modulators, oral contraceptives, antiobesity agents, antidepressants, antianxiety agents, antipsychotic agents, antiproliferative agents, antitumor agents, antiulcer and gastroesophageal reflux disease agents, growth hormone agents and/or growth hormone secretagogues, thyroid mimetics, anti-infective agents, antiviral agents, antibacterial agents, antifungal agents, cholesterol/lipid lowering agents and lipid profile therapies, and agents that mimic ischemic preconditioning and/or myocardial stunning, or a combination thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition further comprising additional therapeutic agent(s) selected from an anti-arrhythmic agent, an anti-hypertensive agent, an anti-coagulant agent, an anti-platelet agent, a thrombin inhibiting agent, a thrombolytic agent, a fibrinolytic agent, a calcium channel blocker, a potassium channel blocker, a cholesterol/lipid lowering agent, or a combination thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition further comprising additional therapeutic agent(s) selected from warfarin, unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin, synthetic pentasaccharide, hirudin, argatroban, aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, sulindac, indomethacin, mefenamate, dipyridamol, droxicam, diclofenac, sulfinpyrazone, piroxicam, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, tirofiban, eptifibatide, abciximab, melagatran, ximelagatran, disulfatohirudin, tissue plasminogen activator, modified tissue plasminogen activator, anistreplase, urokinase, and streptokinase, or a combination thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition wherein the additional therapeutic agent is an antihypertensive agent selected from ACE inhibitors, AT-1 receptor antagonists, beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists, ETA receptor antagonists, dual ETA/AT-1 receptor antagonists, renin inhibitors (alliskerin) and vasopepsidase inhibitors, an antiarrythmic agent selected from IKur inhibitors, an anticoagulant selected from thrombin inhibitors, antithrombin-III activators, heparin co-factor II activators, other factor XIa inhibitors, other kallikrein inhibitors, plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) antagonists, thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) inhibitors, factor VIIa inhibitors, factor IXa inhibitors, and factor Xa inhibitors, or an antiplatelet agent selected from GPIIb/IIIa blockers, GP Ib/IX blockers, protease activated receptor 1 (PAR-1) antagonists, protease activated receptor4 (PAR-4) antagonists, prostaglandin E2 receptor EP3 antagonists, collagen receptor antagonists, phosphodiesterase-III inhibitors, P2Y\n1 \nreceptor antagonists, P2Y\n12 \nantagonists, thromboxane receptor antagonists, cyclooxygense-1 inhibitors, and aspirin, or a combination thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides pharmaceutical composition, wherein the additional therapeutic agent(s) are an anti-platelet agent or a combination thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition, wherein the additional therapeutic agent is the anti-platelet agent clopidogrel.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention can be administered alone or in combination with one or more additional therapeutic agents. By “administered in combination” or “combination therapy” it is meant that the compound of the present invention and one or more additional therapeutic agents are administered concurrently to the mammal being treated. When administered in combination, each component may be administered at the same time or sequentially in any order at different points in time. Thus, each component may be administered separately but sufficiently closely in time so as to provide the desired therapeutic effect.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds that can be administered in combination with the compounds of the present invention include, but are not limited to, anticoagulants, anti-thrombin agents, anti-platelet agents, fibrinolytics, hypolipidemic agents, antihypertensive agents, and anti-ischemic agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther anticoagulant agents (or coagulation inhibitory agents) that may be used in combination with the compounds of this invention include warfarin, heparin (either unfractionated heparin or any commercially available low molecular weight heparin, for example LOVENOX®), synthetic pentasaccharide, direct acting thrombin inhibitors including hirudin and argatroban, as well as other factor VIIa inhibitors, factor IXa inhibitors, factor Xa inhibitors (e.g., ARIXTRA®, apixaban, rivaroxaban, LY-517717, DU-176b, DX-9065a, and those disclosed in WO 98/57951, WO 03/026652, WO 01/047919, and WO 00/076970), factor XIa inhibitors, and inhibitors of activated TAFI and PAI-1 known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term anti-platelet agents (or platelet inhibitory agents), as used herein, denotes agents that inhibit platelet function, for example, by inhibiting the aggregation, adhesion or granule-content secretion of platelets.

(E)-3-(5-chloro-2-tetrazol-1-yl-phenyl)-acrylic acid methyl ester: To a cooled (0° C.) suspension of NaH (0.262 g, 6.56 mmol) in THF (27.3 mL) was added dropwise methyl 2-(dimethoxyphosphoryl)-acetate (1.150 mL, 7.10 mmol). The resulting thick, white suspension was diluted with additional THF (15 mL) to facilitate mixing. The reaction was allowed to warm to rt and stir for 45 min. Next, a solution of 5-chloro-2-tetrazol-1-yl-benzaldehyde (1.14 g, 5.46 mmol), prepared according to a modification of the procedure described by Howard (\nJ. Med. Chem. \n2006, 49:1346), in THF (8 mL) was added. The resulting suspension was stirred vigorously. After 30 min, the reaction was poured into cold saturated ammonium chloride and extracted with EtOAc (2×). The combined organic layers were washed with brine, dried over Na\n2\nSO\n4\n, filtered, and concentrated to give a green/blue solid weighing 1.76 g.
