Description\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThis patent application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/579,362 filed Jun. 14, 2004.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis invention relates to compounds that are antagonists or inverse agonists of the glucagon receptor, and to pharmaceutical compositions thereof, and the uses of these compounds and compositions in the treatment of the human or animal body. The present compounds show a high affinity and selective binding for the glucagon receptor, and as such are useful in the treatment of disorders responsive to the modulation of glucagon receptors, such as diabetic and other glucagon related metabolic disorders, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlucagon is a key hormonal agent that, in cooperation with insulin, mediates homeostatic regulation of the amount of glucose in the blood. Glucagon primarily acts by stimulating certain cells (important among these are liver cells) to release glucose when blood glucose levels fall. The action of glucagon is opposite to that of insulin, which stimulates cells to take up and store glucose whenever blood glucose levels rise. Both glucagon and insulin are peptide hormones. Glucagon is produced in the alpha islet cells of the pancreas and insulin is produced in the beta islet cells. Glucagon exerts its action by binding to and activating its receptor, which is a member of the Glucagon-Secretin branch of the 7-transmembrane G-protein coupled receptor family. The receptor functions by activating the adenylyl cyclase second messenger system resulting in an increase in cAMP levels. The glucagon receptor, or naturally occurring variants of the receptor, may possess intrinsic constitutive activity, invitro, as well as in vivo (i.e. activity in the absence of an agonist). Compounds acting as inverse agonists can inhibit this activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiabetes mellitus is a common disorder of glucose metabolism. The disease is characterized by hyperglycemia and may be classified as type 1 diabetes, the insulin-dependent form, or type 2 diabetes, which is non-insulin-dependent in character. Subjects with type 1 diabetes are hyperglycemic and hypoinsulinemic, and the conventional treatment for this form of the disease is to provide insulin. However, in some patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, absolute or relative elevated glucagon levels have been shown to contribute to the hyperglycemic state. Both in healthy control animals as well as in animal models of type 1 and type 2 diabetes, removal of circulating glucagon with selective and specific antibodies has resulted in reduction of the glycemic level. Mice with a homozygous deletion of the glucagon receptor exhibit increased glucose tolerance. Also, inhibition of glucagon receptor expression using antisense oligonucleotides ameliorates diabetic syndrome in db/db mice. These studies suggest that glucagon suppression or an action that antagonizes glucagon could be a useful adjunct to conventional treatment of hyperglycemia in diabetic patients. The action of glucagon can be suppressed by providing an antagonist or an inverse agonist, i.e. substances that inhibit or prevent constitutive, or glucagon-induced, glucagon receptor mediated responses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral publications disclose peptides that are stated to act as glucagon antagonists. Peptide antagonists of peptide hormones are often potent; however they are generally known not to be orally available because of degradation by physiological enzymes and poor distribution in vivo. Therefore, orally available non-peptide antagonists of peptide hormones are generally preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA number of publications have appeared in recent years reporting non-peptide agents that act at the glucagon receptor. In spite of the number of treatments for diseases that involve glucagon, the current therapies suffer from one or more inadequacies, including poor or incomplete efficacy, unacceptable side effects, and contraindications for certain patient populations. Thus, there remains a need for an improved treatment using alternative or improved pharmaceutical agents that modulate glucagon receptor activity and treat the diseases that could benefit from glucagon receptor modulation.

the same atoms bonded by the same bonds but having different three-dimensional structures called configurations. As used herein, the term “enantiomer” refers to two stereoisomers whose molecules are nonsuperimposable mirror images of one another. The term “chiral center” refers to a carbon atom to which four different groups are attached. As used herein, the term “diastereomers” refers to stereoisomers which are not enantiomers. In addition, two diastereomers which have a different configuration at only one chiral center are referred to herein as “epimers.” The terms “racemate,” “racemic mixture” or “racemic modification” refer to a mixture of equal parts of enantiomers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention may be chiral, and it is intended that any enantiomers, whether pure, partially purified, or racemic mixtures, are included within the scope of the invention. Furthermore, when a double bond or a fully or partially saturated ring system or more than one center of asymmetry or a bond with restricted rotatability is present in the molecule diastereomers may be formed. It is intended that any diastereomers, as separated, pure or partially purified diastereomers or mixtures thereof are included within the scope of the invention. Furthermore, some of the compounds of the present invention may exist in different tautomeric forms and it is intended that any tautomeric forms, which the compounds are able to form, are included within the scope of the present invention. Thus, as one skilled in the art knows, certain aryls may exist in tautomeric forms. The invention also includes tautomers, enantiomers and other stereoisomers of the compounds of Formula I. Such variations are contemplated to be within the scope of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “R” and “S” are used herein as commonly used in organic chemistry to denote specific configuration of a chiral center. The term “R” (rectus) refers to that configuration of a chiral center with a clockwise relationship of group priorities (highest to second lowest) when viewed along the bond toward the lowest priority group. The term “S” (sinister) refers to that configuration of a chiral center with a counterclockwise relationship of group priorities (highest to second lowest) when viewed along the bond toward the lowest priority group. The priority of groups is based upon their atomic number (in order of decreasing atomic number). A partial list of priorities and a discussion of stereochemistry is contained in “Nomenclature of Organic Compounds: Principles and Practice”, (J. H. Fletcher, et al., eds., 1974) at pages 103-120.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe designation “\n” refers to a bond that protrudes forward out of the plane of the page. The designation “\n” refers to a bond that protrudes backward out of the plane of the page. The designation “\n” refers to a bond wherein the stereochemistry is not defined.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of Formula I, when existing as a diastereomeric mixture, may be separated into diastereomeric pairs of enantiomers by, for example, fractional crystallization from a suitable solvent, for example methanol or ethyl acetate or a mixture thereof. The pair of enantiomers thus obtained may be separated into individual stereoisomers by conventional means, for example by the use of an optically active acid as a resolving agent. Alternatively, any enantiomer of a compound of Formula I may be obtained by stereospecific synthesis using optically pure starting materials or reagents of known configuration or through enantioselective synthesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “enantiomeric enrichment” as used herein refers to the increase in the amount of one enantiomer as compared to the other. A convenient method of expressing the enantiomeric enrichment achieved is the concept of enantiomeric excess, or “ee,” which is found using the following equation:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nee\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\nE\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\nE\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n×\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwherein E\n1 \nis the amount of the first enantiomer and E\n2 \nis the amount of the second enantiomer. Thus, if the initial ratio of the two enantiomers is 50:50, such as is present in a racemic mixture, and an enantiomeric enrichment sufficient to produce a final ratio of 70:30 is achieved, the ee with respect to the first enantiomer is 40%. However, if the final ratio is 90:10, the ee with respect to the first enantiomer is 80%. An ee of greater than 90% is preferred, an ee of greater than 95% is most preferred and an ee of greater than 99% is most especially preferred. Enantiomeric enrichment is readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using standard techniques and procedures, such as gas or high performance liquid chromatography with a chiral column. Choice of the appropriate chiral column, eluent and conditions necessary to effect separation of the enantiomeric pair is well within the knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art. In addition, the specific stereoisomers and enantiomers of compounds of Formula I, can be prepared by one of ordinary skill in the art utilizing well known techniques and processes, such as those disclosed by J. Jacques, et al., “\nEnantiomers, Racemates, and Resolutions\n,” John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 1981, and E. L. Eliel and S. H. Wilen, “\nStereochemistry of Organic Compounds\n,” (Wiley-Interscience 1994), and European Patent Application No. EP-A-838448, published Apr. 29, 1998. Examples of resolutions include recrystallization techniques or chiral chromatography. Unless otherwise indicated, a compound indicated to be “isomer 1” will be the first isomer eluted from the chiral separation column and “isomer 2” will be the second.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, the term “pharmaceutical” when used as an adjective means substantially non-toxic to living organisms. For example, the term “pharmaceutical salt” as used herein, refers to salts of the compounds of Formula I, which are substantially non-toxic to living organisms. See, e.g., Berge, S. M, Bighley, L. D., and Monkhouse, D.C., “Pharmaceutical Salts,” \nJ. Pharm. Sci., \n66:1, 1977. The present invention also encompasses pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present compounds. Such salts include pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts, pharmaceutically acceptable metal salts, ammonium and alkylated ammonium salts. Also intended as pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts are any hydrates that the present compounds are able to form. Furthermore, the pharmaceutically acceptable salts comprise basic amino acid salts such as lysine, arginine and ornithine. Typical pharmaceutical salts include those salts prepared by reaction of the compounds of Formula I, with an inorganic or organic acid or base. Such salts are known as acid addition or base addition salts respectively. These pharmaceutical salts frequently have enhanced solubility characteristics compared to the compound from which they are derived, and thus are often more amenable to formulation as liquids or emulsions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “acid addition salt” refers to a salt of a compound of Formula I, prepared by reaction of a compound of Formula I, with a mineral or organic acid. For exemplification of pharmaceutical acid addition salts see, e.g., Berge, S. M, Bighley, L. D., and Monkhouse, D. C., \nJ. Pharm. Sci., \n66:1, 1977. Since compounds of this invention can be basic in nature, they accordingly react with any of a number of inorganic and organic acids to form pharmaceutical acid addition salts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe acid addition salts may be obtained as the direct products of compound synthesis. In the alternative, the free base may be dissolved in a suitable solvent containing the appropriate acid, and the salt isolated by evaporating the solvent or otherwise separating the salt and solvent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAcids commonly employed to form acid addition salts are inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like, and organic acids, such as p-toluenesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, oxalic acid, p-bromophenylsulfonic acid, carbonic acid, succinic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, benzoic acid, acetic acid and the like. Preferred pharmaceutical acid addition salts are those formed with mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, and sulfuric acid, and those formed with organic acids such as maleic acid, tartaric acid, and methanesulfonic acid. Examples of such pharmaceutically acceptable salts thus are the sulfate, pyrosulfate, bisulfate, sulfite, bisulfite, phosphate, monohydrogenphosphate, dihydrogenphosphate, metaphosphate, pyrophosphate, chloride, bromide, iodide, acetate, propionate, decanoate, caprylate, acrylate, formate, isobutyrate, caproate, heptanoate, propiolate, oxalate, malonate, succinate, suberate, sebacate, fumarate, maleate, butyne-1,4-dioate, hexyne-1,6-dioate, benzoate, chlorobenzoate, methylbenzoate, dinitrobenzoate, hydroxybenzoate, methoxybenzoate, phthalate, sulfonate, xylenesulfonate, phenylacetate, phenylpropionate, phenylbutyrate, citrate, lactate, β-hydroxybutyrate, glycollate, tartrate, methanesulfonate, propanesulfonate, naphthalene-1-sulfonate, naphthalene-2-sulfonate, mandelate and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe skilled artisan would appreciate that some compounds of Formula I, may be acidic in nature and accordingly react with any of a number of inorganic and organic bases to form pharmaceutical base addition salts. The term “base addition salt” refers to a salt of a compound of Formula I, prepared by reaction of a compound of Formula I, with a mineral or organic base. For exemplification of pharmaceutical base addition salts see, e.g., Berge, S. M, Bighley, L. D., and Monkhouse, D.C., \nJ. Pharm. Sci., \n66:1, 1977. Bases commonly employed to form pharmaceutical base addition salts are inorganic bases, such as ammonium or alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxides, carbonates, bicarbonates, and the like. Such bases useful in preparing the salts of this invention thus include sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium bicarbonate, calcium hydroxide, calcium carbonate, and the like. Examples of pharmaceutical base addition salts are the ammonium, lithium, potassium, sodium, calcium, magnesium, methylamino, diethylamino, ethylene diamino, cyclohexylamino, and ethanolamino salts, and the like of a compound of Formula I. The potassium and sodium salt forms are particularly preferred. The present invention also contemplates pharmaceutical base addition salts of compounds of Formula I.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical salts of the invention are typically formed by reacting a compound of Formula I, with an equimolar or excess amount of acid or base. The reactants are generally combined in a mutual solvent such as diethylether, tetrahydrofuran, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, benzene, and the like for acid addition salts, or water, an alcohol or a chlorinated solvent such as dichloromethane for base addition salts. The salts normally precipitate out of solution within about one hour to about ten days and can be isolated by filtration or other conventional methods. All pharmaceutically acceptable salts are contemplated in the present invention. The compound or salt of the present invention may form a solvate with low molecular weight solvents. Such solvates are also contemplated as being within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also encompasses prodrugs of the present compounds, which on administration undergo chemical conversion by metabolic processes before becoming pharmacologically active substances. In general, such prodrugs will be functional derivatives of present compounds, which are readily convertible in vivo into a compound of the present invention. Conventional procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable prodrug derivatives are described, for example in “Design of Prodrugs”, ed. H. Bundgaard, Elsevier, 1985.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further aspect of the invention the present compounds are administered in combination with one or more further active substances in any suitable ratios.

Therefore, yet another embodiment of the present invention is a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of Formula I and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents or excipients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present pharmaceutical compositions are prepared by known procedures using well-known and readily available ingredients. In making the formulations of the present invention, the active ingredient (Formula I compound) will usually be mixed with a carrier, or diluted by a carrier, or enclosed within a carrier which may be in the form of a capsule, sachet, paper or other container. When the carrier serves as a diluent, it may be a solid, semisolid or liquid material that acts as a vehicle, excipient, or medium for the active ingredient. Thus, the compositions can be in the form of tablets, pills, powders, lozenges, sachets, cachets, elixirs, suspensions, emulsions, solutions, syrups, aerosol (as a solid or in a liquid medium), soft and hard gelatin capsules, suppositories, sterile injectable solutions and sterile packaged powders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome examples of suitable carriers, excipients, and diluents include lactose, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, mannitol, starches, gum acacia, calcium phosphate, alginates, tragacanth, gelatin, calcium silicate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose, water syrup, methyl cellulose, methyl and propylhydroxybenzoates, talc, magnesium stearate and mineral oil. The formulations can additionally include lubricating agents, wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, preserving agents, sweetening agents or flavoring agents. The compositions of the invention may be formulated so as to provide quick, sustained or delayed release of the active ingredient after administration to the patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions of the present invention may be formulated in sustained release form to provide the rate controlled release of any one or more of the components or active ingredients to optimize the therapeutic effects, i.e., antihistaminic activity and the like. Suitable dosage forms for sustained release include layered tablets containing layers of varying disintegration rates or controlled release polymeric matrices impregnated with the active components and shaped in tablet form or capsules containing such impregnated or encapsulated porous polymeric matrices.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiquid form preparations include solutions, suspensions and emulsions. As an example may be mentioned water or water-propylene glycol solutions for parenteral injections or addition of sweeteners and opacifiers for oral solutions, suspensions and emulsions. Liquid form preparations may also include solutions for intranasal administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAerosol preparations suitable for inhalation may include solutions and solids in powder form, which may be in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier such as inert compressed gas, e.g. nitrogen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor preparing suppositories, a low melting wax such as a mixture of fatty acid glycerides such as cocoa butter is first melted, and the active ingredient is dispersed homogeneously therein by stirring or similar mixing. The molten homogeneous mixture is then poured into convenient sized molds, allowed to cool and thereby solidify.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations for either oral or parenteral administration, Such liquid forms include solutions, suspensions and emulsions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention may also be deliverable transdermally. The transdermal compositions may take the form of creams, lotions, aerosols and/or emulsions and can be included in a transdermal patch of the matrix or reservoir type as a re conventional in the art for this purpose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably the compound is administered orally.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, the pharmaceutical preparation is in a unit dosage form. In such form, the preparation is subdivided into suitably sized unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active components, e.g., an effective amount to achieve the desired purpose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe quantity of the inventive active composition in a unit dose of preparation may be generally varied or adjusted from about 0.01 milligrams to about 1,000 milligrams, preferably from about 0.01 to about 950 milligrams, more preferably from about 0.01 to about 500 milligrams, and typically from about 1 to about 250 milligrams, according to the particular application. The actual dosage employed may be varied depending upon the patient's age, sex, weight and severity of the condition being treated. Such techniques are well known to those skilled in the art. Generally, the human oral dosage form containing the active ingredients can be administered 1 or 2 times per day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere is increasing evidence that glucagon plays an important role in glucose homeostasis. Compounds of Formula I are effective as antagonists or inverse agonists of the glucagon receptor, and thus inhibit the activity of the glucagon receptor. More particularly, these compounds are selective antagonists or inverse agonists of the glucagon receptor. As selective antagonists or inverse agonists, the compounds of Formula I are useful in the treatment of diseases, disorders, or conditions responsive to the inactivation of the glucagon receptor, including but not limited to diabetic and other glucagon related disorder. It is postulated that selective antagonists or inverse agonists of the glucagon receptor will lower plasma glucose levels and thus prevent or treat diabetic and other glucagon related metabolic disorders.\n\n\n \nPharmacological Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nIn the following section binding assays as well as functional assays useful for evaluating the efficiency of the compounds of the invention are described.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBinding of compounds to the glucagon receptor may be determined in a competition binding assay using the cloned human glucagon receptor, and selectivity against the hGlp1 receptor. Antagonism may be determined as the ability of the compounds to inhibit the amount of cAMP formed in in the assay in the presence of 5 nM glucagon.\n\n\n \n \nGlucagon Receptor (hGlucR) Binding Assay\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe receptor binding assay used cloned human glucagon receptor (Lok S, Kuijper J L, Jelinek L J, Kramer J M, Whitmore T E, Sprecher C A, Mathewes S, Grant F J, Biggs S H, Rosenberg G B, et al. Gene 140 (2), 203-209 (1994)) isolated from 293HEK membranes. The hGlucR cDNA was subcloned into the expression plasmid phD (Trans-activated expression of fully gamma-carboxylated recombinant human protein C, an antithrombotic factor. Grinnell, B. W., Berg, D. T., Walls, J. and Yan, S. B. Bio/Technology 5: 1189-1192 (1987)). This plasmid DNA was transfected into 293 HEK cells and selected with 200 ug/mL Hygromycin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCrude plasma membranes are prepared using cells from suspension culture. The cells are lysed on ice in hypotonic buffer containing 25 mM Tris HCL, pH 7.5, 1 mM MgCl2, DNAse1, 20 u/mL, and Roche Complete Inhibitors-without EDTA. The cell suspension is homogenized with a glass dounce homogenizer using a Teflon pestle for 25 strokes. The homogenate is centrifuged at 4 degrees C. at 1800×g for 15 mins. The supernate is collected and the pellet is resuspended in hypotonic buffer and rehomogenized. The mixture is centrifuged at 1800×g for 15 mins. The second supernate is combined with the first supernate. The combined supernates are recentrifuged at 1800×g for 15 mins to clarify. The clarified supernate is transferred to high speed tubes and centrifuged at 25000×g for 30 minutes at 4 degrees C. The membrane pellet is resuspended in homogenization buffer and stored as frozen aliquots at −80 degree C. freezer until needed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlucagon is radioiodinated by I-125-lactoperoxidase procedure and purified by reversed phase HPLC at Perkin-Elmer/NEN (NEX207). The specific activity is 2200 Ci/mmol. Kd determination is performed by homologous competition instead of saturation binding due to high propanol content in the I-125 glucagon material. The Kd is estimated to be 3 nM and is used to calculate Ki values for all compounds tested.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe binding assays are carried out using a Scintillation Proximity Assay (Amersham) with WGA beads previously blocked with 1% fatty acid free BSA (ICN). The binding buffer contains 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1% fatty acid free BSA, (ICN), 0.003% tween-20, and Roche Complete Inhibitors without EDTA. Glucagon is dissolved in 0.01 N HCl at 1 mg/mL and immediately frozen at −80 degrees C. in 30 ul aliquots. The glucagon aliquot is diluted and used in binding assays within an hour. Test compounds are dissolved in DMSO and serially diluted in DMSO. 10 ul diluted compounds or DMSO is transferred into Corning 3632, opaque clear bottom assay plates containing 90 ul assay binding buffer or cold glucagon (NSB at 1 uM final). 50 ul of I-125 glucagon (0.15 nM final in reaction), 50 ul of membranes (300 ug/well), and 40 ul of WGA beads (150 ugs/well) are added, covered, and mixed end over end. Plates are read with a MicroBeta after 14 hours of settling time at room temp.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults are calculated as a percent of specific I-125-glucagon binding in the presence of compound. The absolute EC50 dose of compound is derived by non-linear regression of percent specific binding of I-125-glucagon vs. the dose of compound added. The EC50 dose is converted to Ki using the Cheng-Prusoff equation (Cheng Y., Prusoff W. H., Biochem. Pharmacol. 22, 3099-3108, 1973).\n\n\n \nGlucagon-Like-Peptide 1 (Glp1-R) Receptor Binding Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nThe receptor binding assay used cloned human glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (hGlp1-R). (Graziano M P, Hey P J, Borkowski D, Chicchi G G, Strader C D, Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1993 Oct. 15; 196(1):141-6) isolated from 293HEK membranes. The hGlp1-R cDNA was subcloned into the expression plasmid phD (Trans-activated expression of fully gamma-carboxylated recombinant human protein C, an antithrombotic factor. Grinnell, B. W., Berg, D. T., Walls, J. and Yan, S. B. Bio/Technology 5: 1189-1192 (1987)). This plasmid DNA was transfected into 293 HEK cells and selected with 200 ug/mL Hygromycin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCrude plasma membrane is prepared using cells from suspension culture. The cells are lysed on ice in hypotonic buffer containing 25 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM MgCl2, DNAse, 20 u/mL, and Roche Complete Inhibitors without EDTA. The cell suspension is homogenized with a glass dounce homogenizer using a Teflon pestle for 25 strokes. The homogenate is centrifuged at 4 degrees C. at 1800×g for 15 mins. The supernate is collected and the pellet is resuspended in hypotonic buffer and rehomogenized. The mixture is centrifuged at 1800×g for 15 mins. The second supernate is combined with the first supernate. The combined supernates are recentrifuged at 1800×g for 15 mins to clarify. The clarified supernate is transferred to high speed tubes and centrifuged at 25000×g for 30 minutes at 4 degrees C. The membrane pellet is resuspended in homogenization buffer and stored as frozen aliquots in −80 degree C. freezer until use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlucagaon-like peptide 1 (Glp-1) is radioiodinated by the I-125-lactoperoxidase procedure and purified by reversed phase HPLC at Perkin-Elmer/NEN (NEX308). The specific activity is 2200 Ci/mmol. Kd determination is performed by homologous competition instead of saturation binding due to high propanol content in the I-125 Glp-1 material. The Kd is estimated to be 3 nM and is used to calculate Ki values for all compounds tested.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe binding assays are carried out using a Scintillation Proximity Assay (Amersham) with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) beads previously blocked with 1% fatty acid free BSA (ICN). The binding buffer contains 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1% fatty acid free BSA, (ICN), 0.003% tween-20, and Roche Complete Inhibitors without EDTA. Glucagon-like peptide 1 is dissolved in PBS at 1 mg/mL and immediately frozen at −80 degrees C. in 30 ul aliquots. The glucagon-like peptide aliquot is diluted and used in binding assays within an hour. Test compounds are dissolved in DMSO and serially diluted in DMSO. 10 ul diluted compounds or DMSO is transferred into Corning 3632, opaque clear bottom assay plates containing 90 ul assay binding buffer or cold glucagon-like peptide 1 (NSB at 1 uM final). 50 ul of 1-125 glucagon-like peptide 1 (0.15 nM final in reaction), 50 ul of membranes (600 ug/well), and 40 ul of WGA beads (150 ugs/well) are added, covered, and mixed end over end. Plates are read with a MicroBeta after 14 hours of settling time at room temp.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults are calculated as a percent of specific I-125-glucagon-like peptide 1 binding in the presence of compound. The absolute EC50 dose of compound is derived by non-linear regression of percent specific binding of I-125-glucagon-like peptide 1 vs. the dose of compound added. The EC50 dose is converted to Ki using the Cheng-Prusoff equation (Cheng Y., Prusoff W. H., Biochem. Pharmacol. 22, 3099-3108, 1973).\n\n\n \n \nGlucagon-Stimulated cAMP Functional Antagonist Assay\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cAMP functional assay uses the same cloned human glucagon receptor cell line isolated for the hGlucR binding assay described above. Cells are stimulated with a mixture of an EC80 dose of glucagon in the presence of compound. The cAMP generated within the cell is quantitated using an Amplified Luminescent Proximity Homogeneous Assay, Alpha Screen, from Perkin Elmer (6760625R).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBriefly, cAMP within the cell competes for binding of biotinylated cAMP from the kit to a coated anti-cAMP antibody Acceptor bead and a strepavidin coated Donor bead. As the cAMP level within the cell increases, a disruption of the Acceptor bead-biotinlyated cAMP—Donor bead complex occurs and decreases the signal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlucagon is dissolved in 0.01 N HCl at 1 mg/mL and immediately frozen at −80 degrees C. in 30 ul aliquots. The glucagon aliquot is diluted and used in the functional assay within an hour. Cells are harvested from sub-confluent tissue culture dishes with Enzyme-Free Cell Dissociation Solution, (Specialty Media 5-004-B). The cells are pelleted at low speed and washed 3 times with assay buffer [25 mM Hepes in HBSS—with Mg and Ca (GIBCO, 14025-092) with 0.1% Fatty Acid Free BSA (ICN)] then diluted to a final concentration of 250,000 cells per mL. Compounds are serially diluted into DMSO then diluted into assay buffer with a 3× concentration of glucagon and 3% DMSO. The EC80 of glucagon is pre-determined from a full glucagon dose response and represents the dose at which glucagons produces an 80% of the maximal glucagon response. A mixture of biotinylated cAMP (1 unit/well final) from the Alpha Screen Kit and 3×IBMX (1500 uM) is prepared in Assay Buffer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe functional assay is performed in 96 well, low-volume, white, poylstyrene Costar Plates (3688). The biotinylated cAMP/IBMX mixture, 0.02 mLs, is placed into each well, followed by addition of 0.02 mLs of glucagon dose response, cAMP standard curve, or compound/glucagon mixtures. The reaction is started by addition of 0.02 mLs of cells (5000/well final). After 60 minutes at room temperature, the reaction is stopped by the addition of 0.03 mLs of Lysis Buffer [10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 1% NP40, and 0.01% fatty acid free BSA (ICN) containing 1 unit each/well of Acceptor and Donor beads from the Alpha Screen Kit]. Lysis Buffer addition is performed under a green light to prevent bleaching of the detection beads. The plates are wrapped in foil and left to equilibrate overnight at room temperature. The plates are read on a Packard Fusion™-□Instrument.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlpha screen units are converted to pmoles cAMP generated per well based upon the cAMP standard curve. The pmoles cAMP produced in the presence of compound are converted to % of a maximal response with the EC80 dose of glucagon alone. With each experiment, the dose of glucagon needed to produce a 50% response of pmoles cAMP is determined. This EC50 dose is used to normalize results to a Kb using a modified Cheng-Prusoff equation (Cheng Y., Prusoff W. H., Biochem. Pharmacol. 22, 3099-3108, 1973), where Kb=(EC50 compound)/[1+(pM glucagon used/EC50 in pM for glucagon dose response)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds according to the invention preferably have a Ki value of no greater than 50 μM as determined by the Glucagon Receptor (hGlucR) Binding Assay disclosed herein. More preferably, the compounds according to the invention have a Ki value of less than 5 μM, preferably of less than 500 nM and even more preferred of less than 100 nM as determined by the Glucagon Receptor (hGlucR) Binding Assay disclosed herein. Generally, the compounds according to the invention show a higher affinity for the glucagon receptor compared to the GLP-1 receptor, and preferably have a higher binding affinity to the glucagon receptor than to the GLP-1 receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results are given below for the indicated compound.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nKi (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n265\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n254\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFrom the above description, one skilled in the art can ascertain the essential characteristics of the present invention, and without departing from the spirit and scope thereof, can make various changes and modifications of the invention to adapt it to various usages and conditions.

No. 60/474,453 filed May 31, 2003 which priority is claimed.\n\n\n \nSTATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST\n\n\n \n \n \nThis invention was made with government support under grant number BES-01194889 (NSF). The federal government has certain rights in this invention.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \n1. Field of the Invention\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis invention relates generally to improved cyanine and indocyanine bioconjugates; and, particularly to improved site-specific is delivery for optical tomographic, endoscopic, photoacoustic, sonofluorescent, laser assisted guided surgery, and therapeutic purposes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n2. Background of the Prior Art\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral dyes, including derivatives of fluorescein and carbocyanine, that emit light in the visible and near-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum have in the past and are currently being used for various biomedical applications due to their bioconnpatibility, high molar absorptivity, or high fluorescence quantum yields. This high sensitivity parallels that of nuclear medicine and permits visualization of organs and tissues without the negative effect of ionizing radiation. Most dyes lack specificity for particular organs or tissues and, hence, these dyes must be attached to bioactive carriers such as proteins, peptides, carbohydrates, and the like to deliver the dyes to specific regions in the body. Several studies on the use of near infrared dyes and dye-biomolecule conjugates have been published (Patonay et al., 1991; Slavik, 1994 Brinkley, 1993; Lee and Woo, U.S. Pat. No. 5,453,505; Hohenschuh, WO 98/48846; Turner et al., WO 98/22146; Licha et al., WO 96/17628; and Snow et al., WO 98/48838). Of particular interest is the targeting of tumor cells with antibodies or other large protein carriers as delivery vehicles (Becker, et al., 1999). Such an approach has been widely used in nuclear medical applications, and the major advantage is the retention of a carrier's tissue specificity since the molecular volume of the dye is substantially smaller than the carrier. However, this approach does have some serious limitations in that the diffusion of high molecular weight bioconjugates to tumor cells is highly unfavorable, and is further complicated by the net positive pressure in solid tumors (Jain, 1994). Furthermore, many dyes in general, and cyanine dyes, in particular, tend to form aggregates in aqueous media that lead to fluorescence quenching.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore, to solve these problems, U.S. Pat. No. 6,217,848 disclosed dye-peptide conjugates, including several cyanine dyes with a variety of bis- and tetrakis (carboxylic acid) homologues. The small size of the compounds allowed more favorable delivery to tumor cells, as compared to larger molecular weight imaging agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA typical example of the cyanine compounds used to make these conjugates is indoacyanine green (ICG) which absorbs and emits light in the near infrared region (NIR) wavelengths.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, many drawbacks have been encountered in the use of these recently developed compounds. First, it is difficult to alter their spectral properties to coincide with a desired biological or chemical event, thereby limiting the scope of their functionality as imaging agents. For example, the fluorescence emission and fluorescence lifetime of ICG, in the tissue itself, do not significantly change in situ; and hence, the ICG derivatives cannot be used effectively as a reporter molecules to monitor the functional events such as enzyme activity, and gene expression, as they occur. To circumvent this problem, recent studies have used a “pro-drug” approach, where the fluorescence signal, from a pre-quenched carbocyanine compound, is detected in response to a diagnostic biological event, such as increased local acidity in solid tumors, or high expression of some proteases in metastatic tumors [Bremer C., et al., “Imaging of differential protease expression in breast cancers for detection of aggressive tumor phenotypes”, \nRadiology \n222, 814-818 (2002); Weissleder R., “A clearer vision for in vivo imaging”, \nNat. Biotechnol. \n19, 316-317 (2001)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnfortunately, this “pro-drug” approach relies on the stacking of dyes on a polymer backbone to achieve some level of decrease in fluorescence emission. In addition, the large size of the copolymer-probe conjugate used precludes rapid delivery of the probe to solid tumors. Moreover, the delivery method is nonspecific and the major photophysical feature of the dye that was affected was a reduction in the fluorescence emission of the polymeric material, rather than the tissue itself. Thus, availability of intramolecularly-quenched carbocyanine compounds, coupled with specific delivery to target tissue for functional imaging events such as enzyme activity and gene expression remain an unmet need.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother problem with the recent carbocyanine dye-bioconjugates, is in vivo instability. That is, the bioactive carrier molecule, such as a peptide, is attached to the dye via its N-terminus, where the peptide is susceptible to degradation by exopeptidases via the C-terminus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, the routine use of cyanine bioconjugate compounds in clinical settings as imaging agents is inhibited by the potential for hepatobilliary toxicity resulting from the rapid clearance of these dyes by the liver. This is associated with the tendency of carbocyanine compounds to form aggregates in solution, which could be taken up by Kupffer cells in the liver. Various attempts to obviate this problem have not been very successful. Typically, hydrophilic peptides, polyethyleneglycol or oligosaccharide conjugates have been used but these resulted in excessively long-circulating products that are eventually cleared by the liver.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt would be a welcomed advancement in the industry to overcome the aforesaid drawbacks of the prior art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe publications and other materials used herein to support the background of the invention or provide additional details respecting the practice, are incorporated by reference, and for convenience are respectively listed in the appended List of Reference.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one principal aspect of the present invention there is improved ease with which to alter the spectral properties of cyanine bioconjugates as a function of particular biological or chemical events.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another principal aspect of the invention there is an improvement in the delivery of the bioconjugates to targeted tumors or other biomasses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, an unexpected aspect of this invention is that the macrocyclic bioconjugates have improved stability, as far example, against degradation by exopeptidases, while retaining high receptor binding affinity of peptides, even though carboxyl, alcoholic or otherwise terminal substituents are not free.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, although not completely understood, it is believed that a further aspect of the invention may allow solvent-induced aggregation in solution to be disrupted, and allow a unique mechanism for the bioconjugates to more rapidly clear the liver.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese aspects of the invention and others which will become more apparent from the ensuing Summary, Detailed Description, Figures and Examples, are made possible by intramolecularly cross-linked carbocyanine, cyanine or indocyanine bioconjugates including cross-linked bioconjugates of fluorescein, porphyrin, squarine and their derivatives, useful as imaging agents, hereinafter referred to as macrocyclic bioconjugates having Formulas 1-18 below:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention comprises novel macrocyclic bioconjugate imaging agents, among which are those defined as Formula 1:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein a1 and b1 vary from 0 to 7;

That is, the compound is activated by light through cleavage of labile bonds or generation of free radicals that are cytotoxic to a target microenvironment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese macrocyclic bioconjugates have been found to exude a robust nature which enables them to have an improved delivery which is more specific to targeted tissue. The robust nature my stem from the rigid cross-links in the chromophore core, i.e. the intramolecular cyclization. The topology of the molecules makes it possible to alter the spectral properties of the compounds by a choice of the ring size. In addition, the linker group from one segment of the molecule to another can beneficially comprise a bioactive segment capable of directing the molecules to their targets.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds described in this invention are stable against exopeptidase degradation inspite of the head-to-tail macrocyclization formulations. Macrocyclization facilitates elucidation of the bioactive conformations of linear peptides, which is useful to optimize the affinity of the compounds for their targets. Compounds that can minimize peptide degradation by exopeptidase and also retain the affinity of the carrier to its receptor is highly unusual.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present carbocyanine macrocytic bioconjugates may be inherently excreted by organs other than the liver, such as urinal excretion through the kidneys. But this is not completely understood. The bioconjugates of this invention use hydrophilic units as an integral part of the cyclic chain which may disrupt solvent-induced aggregation in solution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHerein cyclization has been successfully used as a strategy to improve the binding affinities, selectivities, in vivo stability, and pharmacokinetics of bioactive molecules. The conformational restriction conferred by cyclization facilitates the conformational analysis and bioactive conformation elucidation. In the present invention, the chromophore is flanked by bioactive or chemically useful substituents to achieve the desired molecular or cellular event. Thus, we have disclosed molecular beacons that combine both cyclic and fluorescent features which offer enormous advantages over existing optical probes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe molecules disclosed can be used in a variety of applications, including detecting and imaging normal and pathophysiologic conditions; monitoring disease status, organ functions, and the efficacy of drugs; performing in vivo, ex-vivo, and in vitro biological and chemical measurements; detecting microorganisms and pathogens; and monitoring or detecting environment pollutants.\n\n\n \nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe novel bioconjugate compounds of the present invention comprise compounds of \nFormulas\n 1 to 18 and can be prepared from any conventional method. Preferably, one integrates peptide and other bioactive molecules into a fluorescent chromophore core.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe so called macrocyclization or intramolecular linking and cross-linking alters the ring size of molecules to modify the biological characteristics of the bioconjugates, such as changing these bioactive compounds from agonist to antagonist after binding to target a receptor. Thus, changing the ring size serves as an avenue to alter the agonist or antagonist properties of compounds without drastically changing its structural framework.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough it is not completely understood, it is believed that increasing the molecular volume transforms the excretion pathway from the size-dependent glomerular filtration mechanism of the kidneys to tubular filtration, which ensures more rapid elimination of the compound from blood plasma. Consequently, imaging can be performed more rapidly after injection of the imaging agent because the target tissue-to-blood ratio of the macrocyclic compounds can be highly concentrated within hours of post injection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMacrocyclic compounds also have enhanced affinity to different subtypes of target receptors. Optimizing the selectivity of such compounds to the target receptor will minimize the negative effects of the compounds on normal tissue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs previously stated, changing the macrocyclic ring size can alter the spectral properties of the macrocyclic compounds. This is particularly important for the simultaneous monitoring of two or more physiological processes simultaneously without using widely different compounds. The spatial distribution of the functional groups within the bioconjugate allows those groups to interact with each other, thereby making it possible to completely quench the fluorescence emission by incorporating in quenchers in shorter ring structures, such as the addition of metal chelates possessing d-orbital lone pair electrons. This characteristic makes these compounds ideally suited for in vivo and in vitro functional imaging. Particularly, cleavage of one or more amide bonds within the cyclic ring will transform the cyclic chain into a linear analogue that minimizes spatial interaction between the quencher and the chromophore, thereby facilitating the detection of fluorescence emission. The macrocyclic bioconjugate then becomes a highly sensitive probe for detecting the in vivo or in vitro expression of diagnostic enzymes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe macrocyclic compounds of the present invention, are characterized by a fluorescence lifetime altered by the macrocyclization, facilitating the use of the macrocyclic compounds as highly sensitive molecular probes in fluorescence lifetime imaging.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe macrocyclic compounds are useful in various biomedical applications including, but not limited to, tomographic imaging of organs; monitoring of organ functions; coronary angiography; fluorescence endoscopy; detection, imaging, and treatment of pathologic conditions; laser guided surgery, photoacoustic and sonofluorescence methods; and the like. Specific embodiments to accomplish some of the aforementioned biomedical applications are given below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, the compounds of the invention are useful in optical tomographic, endoscopic, photoacoustic and sonofluoresence detection and treatment of tumors and other pathologic conditions. They can be employed for localized therapy and imaging.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds when targeting tumors and other abnormalities, can be detected by monitoring the blood clearance profile of the compounds. Alternatively, the compounds serve during laser assisted guided surgery, to detect micrometastases of tumors upon laparoscopy.

S., Lewis, M. R., Srinivansan, A., Schmidt, M. A., Wang, J., and Anderson, C. J. (1999) Comparison of Four \n64\nCu-labeled Somatostatin Analogs in vitro and in a Tumor-bearing Rat Model: Evaluation of New Derivatives for PET Imaging and Targeted Radiotherapy. \nJ. Med. Chem. \n42, 1341-1347). The AR42J rat pancreatic carcinoma cell line is known to express SSTR2 both in vitro and in vivo ((Rosewicz, S., Vogt, D., Harth, N., Grund, C., Franke, W. W., Ruppert, S., Schweitzer, E., Riecken, E.-O., and Wiedenman, B. (1992) An Amphicrine Pancreatic Cell Line: AR42J Cells Combine Exocrine and Neuroendocrine Properties. \nEur. J. Cell Biol. \n59, 80-91; Christophe, J. (1994) Pancreatic Tumoral Cell Line AR42J: An Amphicrine Model. \nAm. J. Physiol\n.(\nGastrointest. Liver Physiol\n.) 266 (29), G963-G971). A preparation of cell membranes was made from AR42J cells by brief sonication in ice-cold 50 mM Tris buffer containing 1.0 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM PMSF 0.01 mg/ml, leupeptin, 0.2 mg/ml bacitracin, 0.01 mg/ml pepstatin. The suspension was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm and 4° C. for 10 min. and the pelleted membranes were re-suspended in ice-cold 50 mM Tris buffer. Assays were performed using Millipore FC96 plates and the Millipore Multiscreen system (Bedford, Mass.) (1). Triplicates of 50 μl membranes (60 μg/well) were incubated with 50 μl radioligand (30-40,000 cpm) and increasing concentration cold competitors in binding buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM MgCl\n2\n, 0.1 mg/ml BSA) in a total volume of 250 μl per well at 37° C. for 2 h. Following incubation, membranes were filtered on a vacuum manifold and washed twice with binding buffer. The filters containing membrane-bound radioactivity were removed from the assay plate and counted using a Beckman 8000 automated well-typed counter (Fullerton, Calif.). Specific binding was calculated by subtracting the non-specifically bound radioactivity from that of total binding. The best-fit IC\n50 \nvalues were calculated using PRISM™ (Graphpad, San Diego, Calif.). Radiolabeling of DTPA-octreotide with \n111\nIn was carried out in 0.1 M NaOAc (pH 6.5, room temperature, 30 min incubation) specific activity of and radiochemical purity was confirmed greater than 98% by radio TLC. The specific activity of \n111\nIn-DTPA-octreotide ranged from 1200 Ci/mmol to 1500 Ci/mmol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalysis of the receptor binding assay of a representative somatostatin-avid macrocyclic molecule (compound 18) shows that it has an IC\n50 \nvalue of 8.17 nM relative to \n111\nIn-DTPA-octreotide, demonstrating that the peptide's receptor binding affinity was retained in the nanomolar range.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExperimental\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompeting Ligand\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\n95% CI (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nCompound\n 18\n\n\n8.170\n\n\n4.94-13.52\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nContrast Agent-mediated Optical Imaging of Tumors (Part B)\n\n\n \n \n \nThe instrument consists of an excitation source and a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera for signal detection. To image compounds such as \ncompound\n 18 that absorb and emit radiation in the near infrared region, a nominal 780 nm collimated solid state laser source was used to excite the compounds. The nominal 50 mW of incident power from the laser was reduced to about 20 mW at the output of the fiber optic bundle. A CCD camera (12 bit, 1024×1024 pixel, back illuminated) was equipped with the appropriate interference filter to capture the emitted photons at 830 nm. Biodistribution of the dyes and receptor-specific optical contrast agent in mice were performed by injecting 0.5 mL of a 1 μM solution of the compound via the lateral tail vein of tumor (CA20948) bearing mice. The precursor compound to macrocyclization (compound 2) clears from the blood within 1 h postinjection and accumulates in the liver. In contrast, injection of somatostatin-avid optical probes in CA20948 tumor-bearing mice preferentially accumulates in the tumor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile the invention has been disclosed by reference to the details of preferred embodiments of the invention, it is to be understood that the disclosure is intended in an illustrative rather than in a limiting sense, as it is contemplated that modifications will readily occur to those skilled in the art, within the spirit of the invention and the scope of the appended claims.\n\n\n \n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFIG. 1\n depicts the (A) structure, (B) UV-Vis spectrum, and (C) emission spectrum of cypate2 (8).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 2\n depicts the (A) structure, (B) UV-Vis spectrum, and (C) emission spectrum of cypate3 (7).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 3\n depicts the (A) structure, (B) UV-Vis spectrum, and (C) emission spectrum of cypate4 (2).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 4\n depicts the (A) structure, (B) UV-Vis spectrum, and (C) emission spectrum of cyclo(cypate-octreotide) (18).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 5\n depicts the (A) structure, (B) UV-Vis spectrum, and (C) emission spectrum of ICG.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 6\n depicts the (A) structure, (B) UV-Vis spectrum, and (C) emission spectrum of cyclo(cypate2-DPhe-Lys)-Thr-OH.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 7\n depicts the (A) structure, (B) UV-Vis spectrum, and (C) emission spectrum of cyclo(cypate3-DPhe-Lys)-Thr-OH.\n\n\n \n\n\nLIST OF REFERENCES\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\nBecker A, Licha K, Kress M and Riefke B (1999). “Transferrin Mediated Tumor Delivery of Contrast Media for Optical Imaging and Magnetic Resonancelmaging”, Biomedical Optics meeting, Jan. 23-29, 1999, San Jose, Calif.\n\n\nBrinkley M (1993). “A Brief Survey of Methods for Preparing Protein Conjugates with Dyes, Haptens, and Cross-Linking Reagents”, Perspectives in Bioconjugate Chemistry (Ed.
