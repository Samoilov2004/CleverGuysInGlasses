Description\n\n\n\n\n IMIDAZO-PYRAZOLES AS GPR1 19 INHIBITORS \n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n The invention relates to a new class of imidazo-pyrazoles, pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds, and their use to modulate the activity of the G-protein-coupled receptor, GPR1 19. \n\n\nBACKGROUND \n\n\n Diabetes mellitus are disorders in which high levels of blood glucose occur as a consequence of abnormal glucose homeostasis. The most common forms of diabetes mellitus are Type I (also referred to as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus) and Type II diabetes (also referred to as non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus). Type II diabetes, accounting for roughly 90% of all diabetic cases, is a serious progressive disease that results in microvascular complications (including for example retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy) as well as macrovascular complications (including for example accelerated atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease and stroke). \n\n\n Currently, there is no cure for diabetes. Standard treatments for the disease are limited, and focus on controlling blood glucose levels to minimize or delay complications. Current treatments target either insulin resistance (metformin or thiazolidinediones) or insulin release from beta cells (sulphonylureas, exanatide). Sulphonylureas and other compounds that act via depolarization of the beta cell promote hypoglycemia as they stimulate insulin secretion independent of circulating glucose concentrations. One approved drug, exanatide, stimulates insulin secretion in the presence of high glucose, but must be injected due to a lack of oral bioavailablity. Sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor, is a drug that increases blood levels of incretin hormones, which can increase insulin secretion, reduce glucagon secretion and have other less well characterized effects. However, sitagliptin and other dipeptidyl peptidases IV inhibitors may also influence the tissue levels of other hormones and peptides, and the long-term consequences of this broader effect have not been fully investigated. \n\n\n In Type II diabetes, muscle, fat and liver cells fail to respond normally to insulin.\n\n\nThis condition (insulin resistance) may be due to reduced numbers of cellular insulin receptors, disruption of cellular signaling pathways, or both. At first, the beta cells compensate for insulin resistance by increasing insulin output. Eventually, however, the beta cells become unable to produce sufficient insulin to maintain normal glucose levels (euglycemia), indicating progression to Type II diabetes. \n\n In Type II diabetes, fasting hyperglycemia occurs due to insulin resistance combined with beta cell dysfunction. There are two aspects of beta cell defect dysfunction: 1 ) increased basal insulin release (occurring at low, non-stimulatory glucose concentrations). This is observed in obese, insulin-resistant pre-diabetic stages as well as in Type II diabetes, and 2) in response to a hyperglycemic challenge, a failure to increase insulin release above the already elevated basal level. This does not occur in pre-diabetic stages and may signal the transition from normo-glycemic insulin- resistant states to Type II diabetes. Current therapies to treat the latter aspect include inhibitors of the beta-cell ATP-sensitive potassium channel to trigger the release of endogenous insulin stores, and administration of exogenous insulin. Neither achieves accurate normalization of blood glucose levels, and both carry the risk of eliciting hypoglycemia. \n\n\n Thus, there has been great interest in the discovery of agents that function in a glucose-dependent manner. Physiological signaling pathways which function in this way are well known, including gut peptides GLP-1 and GIP. These hormones signal via cognate G-protein coupled receptors to stimulate production of cAMP in pancreatic beta-cells. Increased cAMP, apparently, does not result in stimulation of insulin release during the fasting or pre-prandial state. However, a number of biochemical targets of cAMP, including the ATP-sensitive potassium channel, voltage-sensitive potassium channels and the exocytotic machinery, are modulated such that insulin secretion due to postprandial glucose stimulation is significantly enhanced. Therefore, agonist modulators of novel, similarly functioning, beta-cell GPCRs, including GPR1 19, would also stimulate the release of endogenous insulin and promote normalization of glucose levels in Type II diabetes patients. It has also been shown that increased cAMP, for example as a result of GLP- 1 stimulation, promotes beta-cell proliferation, inhibits beta- cell death and, thus, improves islet mass. This positive effect on beta-cell mass should be beneficial in Type II diabetes where insufficient insulin is produced. \n\n\n It is well known that metabolic diseases have negative effects on other physiological systems and there is often co-occurrence of multiple disease states (e.g. Type I diabetes, Type II diabetes, inadequate glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, \n\n\ndyslipidemia, obesity or cardiovascular disease in \"Syndrome X\") or secondary diseases which occur secondary to diabetes such as kidney disease, and peripheral neuropathy. Thus, there exists a need for new treatments of the diabetic condition. \n\n SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n In accordance with the invention, a new class of GPR1 19 modulators has been discovered. These compounds may be represented by formula I, as shown below: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein: \n\n\n X is A or B \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n A B \n\n\n Y is O or a bond;\n\n\n \n\n R\n2\n is hydrogen, cyano, C1 -C6 alkyl, or C3-C6 cycloalkyl; \n\n\n R\n3\n is C1-C6 alkyl, C3-C6 cycloalkyl, or C3-C6 cycloalkyl substituted with C1-C6 alkyl, C1-C6 alkoxy, Ci-C6fluoroalkyl, halo, or hydroxy, with the proviso that the halo, C1-C6 alkoxy, or hydroxy groups are not attached at the carbon atom connected to O in R\n1\n; \n\n\n R\n4\n is C1-C6 haloalkyl, C1-C6 alkyl, halo, cyano, or C3-C6 cycloalkyl; \n\n\n R\n5\n is hydrogen, cyano, nitro, C1-C6 fluoroalkyl, C1-C6 alkyl, C1-C6 alkoxy, C1-C6 fluoroalkoxy, or C3-C6 cycloalkyl; \n\n\n R\n6\n is hydrogen, C C\n6\n alkyl, C\n3\n-C\n6\n cycloalkyl, -C(0)-NH\n2\n, or C C\n6\n alkyl substituted with hydroxy or C.,- C\n6\n alkoxy; \n\n\n R and R are each independently hydrogen, fluoro, or C1-C6 alkyl; and \n\n m is 1 or 2, wherein when m is 1 then R is hydrogen, d-Ce alkyl, -CH\n2\n-(Cr C\n5\n)haloalkyl, C3-C6 cycloalkyl, or Ci-C\n6\n alkyl substituted with hydroxy; and when m is 2 then each R\n8\n is independently d-Ca alkyl or -CH\n2\n-(CrC2)haloalkyl; \n\n\n or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. \n\n\n The compounds of formula I modulate the activity of the G-protein-coupled receptor.

Unless specified otherwise, it is intended that all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of the invention as well as mixtures thereof, including racemic mixtures, form part of the invention. In addition, the invention embraces all geometric and positional isomers. For example, if a compound of the invention incorporates a double bond or a fused ring, both the cis- and transforms, as well as mixtures, are embraced within the scope of the invention. \n\n\n Diastereomeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereoisomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods well known to those skilled in the art, such as by chromatography and/or fractional crystallization, distillation, sublimation. Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound (e.g. chiral auxiliary such as a chiral alcohol or Mosher's acid chloride), separating the diastereoisomers and converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereoisomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. Also, some of the compounds of the invention \n\n may be atropisomers (e.g., substituted biaryls) and are considered as part of this invention. Enantiomers can also be separated by use of a chiral HPLC (high pressure liquid chromatography) column. \n\n\n It is also possible that the intermediates and compounds of the invention may exist in different tautomeric forms, and all such forms are embraced within the scope of the invention. The term \"tautomer\" or \"tautomeric form\" refers to structural isomers of different energies which are interconvertible via a low energy barrier. For example, proton tautomers (also known as prototropic tautomers) include interconversions via migration of a proton, such as keto-enol and imine-enamine isomerizations. A specific example of a proton tautomer is the imidazole moiety where the proton may migrate between the two ring nitrogens. Valence tautomers include interconversions by reorganization of some of the bonding electrons. The equilibrium between closed and opened form of some intermediates (and/or mixtures of intermediates) is reminiscent of the process of mutarotation involving aldoses, known by those skilled in the art. \n\n\n In addition, the compounds of the invention can exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like. In general, the solvated forms are considered equivalent to the unsolvated forms for the purposes of the invention. The compounds may also exist in one or more crystalline states, i.e. polymorphs, or they may exist as amorphous solids. All such forms are encompassed by the claims. \n\n\n The invention also embraces isotopically-labeled compounds of the invention which are identical to those recited herein, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, fluorine, iodine, and chlorine, such as \n2\nH, \n3\nH, \n11\nC, \n13\nC, \n14\nC, \n13\nN, \n15\nN, \n15\n0, \n17\n0, \n18\n0, \n31\n P, \n32\nP, \n35\nS, \n18\nF, \n123\nl, \n125\nl and \n36\nCI, respectively. \n\n\n Certain isotopically-labeled compounds of the invention (e.g., those labeled with \n3\nH and \n14\nC) are useful in compound and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. \n\n\nTritiated (i.e., \n3\nH) and carbon-14 (i.e., \n14\nC) isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium (i.e., \n2\nH) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability (e.g., increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements) and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Positron emitting isotopes such as \n15\n0, \n13\nN, \n11\nC, and \n18\nF are useful for positron emission tomography (PET) studies to examine \n\n substrate occupancy. Isotopically-labeled compounds of the invention can generally be prepared by following procedures analogous to those disclosed in the Schemes and/or in the Examples herein below, by substituting an isotopically-labeled reagent for a non- isotopically-labeled reagent. \n\n\n Some of the compounds of formula I contain an 3-oxa-7-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane ring bonded to a pyrimidine ring via an ether linkage as depicted below. This \n\n\nazabicyclo-nonane will exist as a geometric isomer and may be present as either the syn or anti isomer depicted below. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n In one embodiment of a compound having formula I, X is A and R\n1\n is -C(0)-0-R\n3\n. In another embodiment of a compound having formula I, R\n6\n and R\n8\n are each hydrogen. \n\n\n In another embodiment of a compound having formula I, R\n3\n is C3-C6 cycloalkyl substituted with C1-C3 alkyl. \n\n\n In another embodiment of a compound having formula I, R\n7a\n and R\n7b\n are each independently hydrogen, fluoro, or C1-C3 alkyl. \n\n\n In a further embodiment of a compound having formula I, R\n2\n is hydrogen and R\n5\n is C1-C6 alkyl. \n\n\nSynthesis \n\n\nCompounds of the invention may be synthesized by synthetic routes that include processes analogous to those well-known in the chemical arts, particularly in light of the description contained herein. The starting materials are generally available from commercial sources such as Aldrich Chemicals (Milwaukee, Wl) or are readily prepared using methods known to those skilled in the art (e.g., prepared by methods generally described in Louis F. Fieser and Mary Fieser, Reagents for Organic Synthesis, v. 1-19, Wiley, New York (1967-1999 ed.), or Beilsteins Handbuch der organischen Chemie, 4, Aufl. ed. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, including supplements (also available via the Beilstein online database). \n\n For illustrative purposes, the reaction schemes depicted below provide potential routes for synthesizing the compounds of the invention as well as key intermediates. For a more detailed description of the individual reaction steps, see the Examples section below. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that other synthetic routes may be used to synthesize the inventive compounds. Although specific starting materials and reagents are depicted in the schemes and discussed below, other starting materials and reagents can be easily substituted to provide a variety of derivatives and/or reaction conditions. In addition, many of the compounds prepared by the methods described below can be further modified in light of this disclosure using conventional chemistry well known to those skilled in the art. \n\n\n The compounds of formula I can be prepared using methods analogously known in the art for the production of ethers. The reader's attention is directed to texts such as: 1 ) Hughes, D. L; Organic Reactions 1992, 42 335-656 Hoboken, NJ, United States; 2) Tikad, A.; Routier, S.; Akssira, M.; Leger, J.-M.l; Jarry, C; Guillaumet, G. Synlett 2006, 12, 1938-42; and 3) Loksha, Y. M.; Globisch, D.; Pedersen, E. B.; La Colla, P.; Collu, G.; Loddo, R.J. Het. Chem. 2008, 45, 1 161 -6 which describe such reactions in greater detail. \n\n\n Scheme I, immediately below, illustrates alternative methodologies for assembling the compounds of formula I. The central portion of the molecule is an optionally substituted pyrimidine ring. The compounds of formula I are produced by forming both an ether linkage and an amino linkage with the pyrimidine as depicted below. It is not critical in what order this reaction sequence is carried out except in cases where R\n5\n is cyano or nitro. In such cases, Steps l-B and l-C are used to assemble compounds of formula I. \n\n\n\n\nSCHEME I \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe starting material in reaction Scheme I, is the dihydroxy-pyrimidine of structure compound 1-1 in which R\n2\n and R\n5\n, are typically represented by the same substituents as is desired in the final product, as described herein. Methods for producing such pyrimidines are known in the art. \n\n\n The chlorination reaction of step l-A is carried out as is known in the art. A compound of structure 1-1 is allowed to react with a chlorinating reagent such as POCU (phosphorous oxychloride) (Matulenko, M. A. et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2007, 15, 1586-1605) used in excess or in solvents such as toluene, benzene or xylene with or without additives such as triethylamine, A/JV-dimethylaniline, or N,N- diisopropylethylamine . This reaction may be run at temperatures ranging from room temperature (about 23 degrees Celsius) to about 140 degrees Celsius, depending on the choice of conditions. Alternative chlorinating reagents may consist of PCI3, (phosphorous trichloride), POCI3/PCI5 (phosphorous pentachloride), thionyl chloride, \n\n oxalyl chloride or phosgene to give a dichloropyrimidine of structure 1-2. In some cases the dichloropyrimidine of structure 1-2 may be obtained from commercial sources. \n\n\nOptionally, the dichloropyrimidine of structure 1-2 may be isolated and recovered from the reaction and further purified as is known in the art. Alternatively the crude material may be used in Step l-B described below. \n\n\n In Step l-B of Scheme I, an amino linkage is formed between the imidazo- pyrazole of structure 1-3 and the dichloropyrimidine of structure 1-2. In the imidazo- pyrazole structure 1-3, R\n6\n and R\n8\n will typically be represented by the same substituent as is desired in the final product, as described herein. Such imidazo-pyrazole derivatives are known in the literature or may be conveniently prepared by a variety of methods familiar to those skilled in the art (US2989537; Anti-Cancer Drug Des. 1987, 2, 235). The amino linkage to for I-5 is formed by reacting equivalent amounts of the compounds of structure I-2 and I-3 in a solvent in the presence of a base. One set of conditions for this transformation involves reacting structures I-2 and I-3 in a polar protic solvent such as ethanol, propanol, isopropanol or butanol at temperatures ranging from about 0 to 120 degrees Celsius, depending on which solvent is used, for 0.5 to 24 hours. Typical conditions utilized for this reaction are the use of isopropanol as the solvent heated at 108 degrees Celsius for one hour. Alternatively, an amine base such as triethylamine or diethylisopropylamine or inorganic bases such as sodium \n\n\nbicarbonate, potassium carbonate or sodium carbonate may be added to this reaction. In the case of the use of one of the above amine or inorganic bases, the solvent may be changed to a polar aprotic solvent such as acetonitrile, /V,/V-dimethyl formamide (\"DMF\"), tetrahydrofuran (\"THF\") or 1 ,4-dioxane at about O to 100 degrees Celsius for 0.5 to 24 hours. Typical conditions utilized for this reaction include the use of diethylisopropylamine in acetonitrile at room temperature for three hours. Also, the use of hydrochloric acid in polar protic solvents such as water, methanol, ethanol or propanol alone or in combination may be used for this transformation at temperatures of about 0 to 1 10 degrees Celsius. Typical conditions are the use of water in ethanol at 78 degrees Celsius. A preferred method to form I-5 is by reacting structures I-2 and I-3 with sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide in tetrahydrofuran. The intermediate of structure I-5 may be isolated and recovered from the reaction and further purified as is known in the art. Alternatively the crude material may be used in Step l-C described below. \n\n\n In Step l-C of Scheme I, an ether linkage is formed between the intermediate of structure I-5 and the alcohol of structure I-4 to form the compound of formula I. In the alcohol of structure I-4, X will be A, B, or C and R\n7a\n and R\n7b\n will be represented by the \n\n same substituent as found in the desired final product. The substituents represented by R\n1\n may be manipulated after the core of formula I is produced. Such variations are well known to those skilled in the art and should be considered part of the invention. In Step l-C, equivalent amounts of the reactants are reacted in the presence of a base such as sodium hydride; sodium and potassium tert-butoxide; sodium, potassium, and lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide and sodium, potassium and lithium tert-amyloxide in solvents such as DMF, THF, 1 ,2-dimethoxyethane, 1 ,4-dioxane, A/,/V-dimethylacetamide, or dimethylsulfoxide (\"DMSO\"). Typical conditions for this transformation include the use of sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide in 1 ,4-dioxane at about 105 degrees Celsius for one hour. \n\n\n After the reaction is completed the desired compound of formula I may be recovered and isolated as known in the art. It may be recovered by evaporation, extraction, etc. as is known in the art. It may optionally be purified by chromatography, recrystallization, distillation, or other techniques known in the art. \n\n\n In the alternative synthesis depicted above in Reaction Scheme I, the dichloro- pyrimidine of structure 1-2 is initially reacted with the alcohol of structure 1-4 to form the intermediate depicted by structure 1-6. As with Step l-C, structure 1-4 will be an alcohol where X is A, B, or C dependent upon the desired final product. In these heterocyclic rings, R\n1\n and R\n4\n will typically be represented by the same substituent as is desired in the final product or R\n1\n may manipulated after the core of formula I is produced. \n\n\n Equivalent amounts of the compounds of structure I-2 and structure I-4 are allowed to react in the presences of a polar aprotic solvent and a base to form intermediates of structure I-6 as depicted in step l-D. Suitable systems include bases such as sodium hydride, sodium and potassium tert-butoxide, sodium, potassium, and lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide and sodium, potassium and lithium tert-amyloxide in solvents such as DMF, THF, 1 ,2-dimethoxyethane, 1 ,4-dioxane, N,N- dimethylacetamide, or DMSO at temperatures of 0 to 140 degrees Celsius. Typical conditions for this transformation include the use of potassium tert-butoxide in THF at about 0 degrees Celsius to room temperature for 14 hours. The intermediate of structure I-6 may be isolated and recovered from the reaction and further purified as is known in the art. Alternatively the crude material may be used in Step l-E, described below. \n\n\n The compounds of formula I may then be formed by reacting the intermediate of structure I-6 with the imidazo-pyrazole derivatives I-3, described above. Typically, equivalent amounts of the fused imidazo-pyrazole of structure I-3 are allowed to react \n\n with the chloro intermediate of formula 1-6 in the presence of a base. Suitable bases can be sodium hydride, sodium or potassium tert-butoxide, sodium or potassium or lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide and sodium or potassium or lithium tert-amyloxide in solvents such as DMF, THF, 1 ,2-dimethoxyethane, 1 ,4-dioxane, N,N- dimethylacetamide, or DMSO or mixtures thereof. These reactions may be carried out in temperature ranges of about -10 to 150 degrees Celsius depending on the solvent of use. Typically, the reaction will be allowed to proceed for a period of time ranging from about 15 minutes to 24 hours under an inert atmosphere. Suitable conditions include sodium bis(dimethylsilyl)amide in 1 ,4-dioxane at 105 degrees Celsius for one hour. \n\n\n Alternatively, this reaction may be carried out by heating the intermediate of structure 1-6 and imidazo-pyrazole derivatives of structure 1-3 in a polar protic solvent such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol or butanol for 0.5 to 24 hours. Typical conditions for this transformation are heating in isopropanol at 108 degrees Celsius for two hours. \n\n\n This reaction may also by carried out using transition metal catalysts to form the key substituted amine linkage found in the compounds of formula I. Transition metal catalysts may consist of but are not limited to triphenylphosphine) Palladium \n\n\n(Pd(PPh\n3\n)\n4\n), Palladium(ll) chloride (PdCI\n2\n), Palladium(ll) acetate (Pd(OAc)\n2\n), \n\n\n(tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(O) (Pd\n2\n(dba)\n3\n), Copper(l) iodide (Cul), Copper(ll) acetate (Cu(OAc)\n2\n) and Copper(ll) trifluoromethane (Cu(OTf)\n2\n). A base is typically utilized in these reactions. A suitable base for use with palladium catalysts may be sodium tert-butoxide, potassium terf-butoxide, potassium tert-amyloxide or K\n3\nP0\n4\n in an appropriate solvents such as 1 ,4-dioxane, THF, 1 ,2-dimethoxyethane or toluene. For the use of copper catalysts, a suitable base may consist of alkali bases such as sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, cesium carbonate in an appropriate solvent such as DMF, DMSO or dimethylacetamide. \n\n\n Typically ligands can be added to facilitate the amine formation reaction. Ligands for palladium catalyzed reactions may include but are not limited to 9,9-dimethyl-4,5- bis(diphenylphosphino)xanthene (Xantphos), 2,2'-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1 ,1 '- binaphthyl (BINAP), 1 , 1 '-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene (DPPF), 2,8,9-triisobutyl- 2,5,8,9-tetraaza-1 -phosphabicyclo[3.3.3]undecane (P[N(/-Bu)CH\n2\nCH\n3\n]\n3\nN), tri-te/t- butylphosphine (te/?-Bu\n3\nP), (biphenyl-2-yl)bis(te/?-butyl)phosphine (JohnPhos), Pd- PEPPSI™-SIPr: (1 ,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)-4,5-dihydroimidazol-2-ylidene) (3- chloropyridyl) palladium(ll) dichloride. Suitable ligands for copper catalyzed reactions may include but are not limited to /.-proline, /V-methylglycine, diethylsalicyclamide. \n\n Suitable conditions for formation of compounds of formula I are the use of Pd\n2\n(dba)3 with sodium tert-butoxide in toluene at 120 degrees Celsius for 12 hours. \n\n\n After the reaction is completed the desired compound of formula I may be recovered and isolated as known in the art. It may be recovered by evaporation, extraction, etc. as is known in the art. It may optionally be purified by chromatography, recrystallization, distillation, or other techniques known in the art prior. \n\n\n As is also readily apparent to one skilled in the art, many of the substituents represented by R\n1\n may be manipulated after the core of formula I is produced. Such variations are well known to those skilled in the art and should be considered part of the invention. \n\n\n Scheme II \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Scheme II describes a method for the production of alcohols of structure 11-14 and 11-15 which corresponds to X is B in formula I of the invention. R\n3\n, R\n6\n, R\n7a\n, and R\n7b\n are typically represented by the same substituent as is desired in the final product, as described herein. Syntheses of compounds of structure 11-8 from compounds of structure 11-7 are known in the art. These transformations (Step ll-A) are taught in the literature and are exemplified in: J. Org. Chem., 1981 , 46, 3196-3204, JP2009096744, WC035303, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008, 130, 5654-5655, and Org. Lett., 2006, 3, 430-436. In Step ll-B of Scheme II, the carbonyl group of the ketone is reduced using standards protocols known in the art such as the use of sodium borohydride in an alcoholic solvent \n\n like methanol at a temperature ranging from about 0 degrees Celsius to room \n\n\ntemperature. Step ll-D, the removal of the benzyl protecting group from structure 11-10 to provide 11-1 1 , can be accomplished via hydrogenolysis. Typical conditions for this reaction include utilizing hydrogen and a palladium catalyst including 5 to 20% palladium on carbon or 10 to 20% palladium hydroxide. A typical solvent for this reaction is ethanol, methanol, tetrahydrofuran or ethyl acetate. \n\n\n If a pyrimidine substituent is desired in the final product, then structure 11-14 may be formed via the addition of compound 11-1 1 to an appropriately substituted 2- chloropyrimidine as depicted by structure 11-12 in the presence of a base such as cesium carbonate or A/JV-diisopropylethylamine in a protic solvent such as ethanol or methanol, or a polar aprotic solvent such as 1 ,4-dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, N,N- dimethylformamide or dimethylsulfoxide. These reactions can be conducted at temperatures ranging from about room temperature to about 1 10 degrees Celsius. Alternatively, compounds of structure 11-1 1 and structure 11-12 can be heated together in the presence of base such as Ν,Ν-diisopropylethylamine without solvent, or where compound 11-1 1 is used in excess without base or solvent. \n\n\n If a carbamate substituent is desired in the final product then equivalent amounts of the alkyl haloformate of structure 11-13 is reacted with the compound of structure 11-1 1 in the presence of a base such as A/JV-diisopropylethylamine , triethylamine or pyridine in dichloromethane or chloroform. Alternatively, compounds of structure 11-15 can formed from compounds of structure 11-1 1 via the use of dialkyldicarbonates such as di- tert-butyl dicarbonate (BOC anhydride) or di-isopropyl dicarbonate in the presence of amine bases such as Ν,Ν-diisopropylethylamine , pyridine, 2,6-lutidine or triethylamine in solvents such as dichloromethane, chloroform or tetrahydrofuran. In addition, when R\n3\n = 1-methyl-cyclopropyl or 1 -difluoromethyl-cyclopropyl, the carbamate functionality can be introduced using carbonate 11-13' (see WO09105717 and WO09005677) in a solvent like dichloromethane, dichloroethane, dimethoxyethane, tetrahydrofuran in presence of a base like triethylamine, A/JV-diisopropylethylamine and the like at temperature ranging from about zero degrees Celsius to about ambient temperature. \n\n\n Final structure 11-14 or 11-15 may be isolated and purified as is known in the art. If desired, it may be subjected to a separation step to yield the desired syn- or anti- isomer. \n\n\n Alternatively, unsymmetrical structures of formula 11-10 where at least one of R\n7a\n and R\n7b\n is hydrogen, may be accessed via a double Mannich reaction between bis- aminol ether derivatives II-9 and ketone II-7, followed by reduction of the ketone \n\n carbonyl and functional group manipulation to provide structures of type 11-10. It is recognized that in certain instances R\n9a\n will preferably be an alpha-methyl-benzyl group rather than the benzyl group shown in structure 11-10. Suitable R\n9b\n groups include methyl or ethyl. The use of the double Mannich reaction to yield structures of formula II- 8 has been published in the chemistry literature (Tetrahedron 2005 61, 5876-5888; Org. Lett. 2006 8, 3399-3401 ) and can be attained by those skilled in the art. Similarly, structures of formula 11-10 where both R\n7a\n and R\n7b\n are fluoro, can be accessed starting from readily available starting material using protocols known in chemical literature for the formation of cis- or trans- difluoro-2,6 cyclohexanone {Tetrahedron 1970 26, 2447). \n\n\n Scheme III describes the preparation of compounds of formula 111-19 which correspond to X is A in formula I. \n\n\n Scheme III \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n As shown in Scheme III compounds of formula 111-19 where R is as described herein and at least one R\n7a\n and R\n7b\n are hydrogen, can be prepared starting with commercially available A/-tert-butoxycarbonyl-4-piperidone (Aldrich) or from 4- piperidone followed by carbamate formation. Compounds for the formula 111-19 are prepared by reduction of compounds of the formula 111-16 or 111-18 by reduction of the ketone carbonyl as indicated by Step lll-A. Suitable conditions for this include the use of sodium borohydride in a mixture of an alcoholic solvent, such as ethanol, and THF. Compounds of the formula 111-19 where at least one of R\n7a\n and R\n7b\n is fluoro can be prepared by enolization of the ketone, trapping as the silyl enol ether and reaction with the appropriate electrophilic fluoro source as described in J. Org. Chem. 2003 68, 3232 and J. Org. Chem. 2002 67, 8610. Compounds of formula 111-18 where at least one of\n\n\nR'\na\n and R is an alkyl group can be similarly prepared using the appropriate \n\n\nelectrophilic alkyl group such as alkyl halides or sulfonates. In addition, structures of \n\n\n 57b \n\n\nformula 111-19 where both R\n7a\n and R'\nD\n are halo, such as fluoro, can be accessed from \n\n readily available A/-te/?-butoxycarbonyl-4-piperidone using similar protocols known in the chemical literature {Tetrahedron, 1970, 26, 2447). It is also recognized that when X is A in formula I of the invention that such piperidine compounds are commercially available, are known in the literature or can be prepared from commercial (Aldrich) N-tert- butoxycarbonyl-4-piperidone or other suitably N-protected piperidones. \n\n\n It is recognized that the tert-butyloxycarbonyl group (R\n3\n is tert-butyl) can be removed at many stages in the synthesis using acid such as hydrochloric acid or trifluoroacetic acid and the resulting free amine can be converted to an alternative carbamate or pyrimidine using general conditions described in respectively step ll-E' and ll-E in scheme II. The preparation of compounds of formula 111-19 are also described in WO2009014910. \n\n\n Scheme IV describes the synthesis of compounds of formula IV-23. Compounds of formula IV-23, can be prepared, via route A in Scheme IV, according to examples in the chemical literature and by one skilled in the chemical art. In Route A, condensation of cyclocondensation of hydrazine derivatives IV-1 (such as 1-hydrazino-2-propanol (CAS# 18501-20-7), 2-hydroxyethylhydrazide (CAS#109-84-2), and 2-hydrazino-1 - propanol {J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1954, 76, 1283) and the appropriate alpha-cyano aldehyde IV-2, in alcoholic solvents such as ethanol, and isopropanol (step IV-3 results in the formation of aminopyrazole derivative IV-4. Compounds of formula IV-2 can be accessed by deprotanion of alkyl or arylnitriles, followed by quenching with ethylformate (see J. Med. Chem. 1982, 25, 235-242; WO2007099323). Treatment of intermediates of formula IV-4 with sulfuric acid (step IV-5), (US2989537; Anti-Cancer Drug Des. 1987, 2, 235), leads to compounds of formula IV-23 via dehydrative cyclization. Alternatively, intermediates of formula IV-23, can be derived from IV-4, by acylation or sulfonation of the amine, activation of the N-1 hydroxylethyl via sulfonyl formation, ring closure, and removal of the amine masking group {Anti-Cancer Drug Des. 1987, 2, 235; EP332156). Compounds of formula IV-23, where R\n6\n is hydrogen can be synthesized by first condensing hydrazinoalcohols of formula IV-1 with commercially available 2- ethoxymethylene malononitrile ( CAS# 123-06-8), IV-6, where R\n9\n= CN or from commercially available ethyl (ethoxymethylene)cyanoacetate ( CAS# 94-05-3), IV-6, where R\n9\n= C0\n2\nEt, to yield intermediate IV-8. Subjecting substrates of formula IV-8, where R\n9\n= CN, to the same conditions as in step IV-5 leads to imidazo-pyrazole of formula IV-23. For compounds of formula IV-8, where R\n9\n= C0\n2\nEt, the substrate can be hydrolyzed under basic conditions to the carboxylic acid, followed by step IV-5. \n\n\n Scheme IV \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Route C \n\n\n\n\n\n step IV-10 \n\n\n R\nb\n ^CN \n\n\n IV-9 \n\n\nAn alternative approach to imidiazo-pyrazoles of formula IV-23, where R is a C C6 substitiuted alkyl, aryl, and heteroaryl derivative, is shown above in route C. \n\n\nTreatment of acetylenic nitriles of the type of formula IV-9 with hydrazine (step IV-10) gives the enaminic nitrile derivative IV-11 which undergoes cyclization to give aminopyrazole derivative IV-12 (Tet. Lett. 2008, 49, 3104; J. Chem. Soc, Perkin Trans. 1, 1981 , 2997). Treatment of aminopyrazole derivative IV-12 with 1 ,2-dibromoethane, base, and heat in organic solvents (step IV-13), in a similar manner as in EP332156, leads to IV-23. \n\n\n As is readily apparent to one skilled in the art, protection of remote functionality (e.g., primary or secondary amine) of intermediates may be necessary. The need for such protection will vary depending on the nature of the remote functionality and the conditions of the preparation methods. Suitable amino-protecting groups (NH-Pg) include acetyl, trifluoroacetyl, /-butoxycarbonyl (BOC), benzyloxycarbonyl (CBZ) and 9- fluorenylmethyleneoxycarbonyl (Fmoc). Similarly, a \"hydroxy-protecting group\" refers to a substituent of a hydroxy group that blocks or protects the hydroxy functionality. \n\n\nSuitable hydroxyl-protecting groups (O-Pg) include for example, allyl, acetyl, silyl, benzyl, para-methoxybenzyl, trityl, and the like. The need for such protection is readily \n\n determined by one skilled in the art. For a general description of protecting groups and their use, see T. W. Greene, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1991 . \n\n\n As noted above, some of the compounds of this invention may form salts with pharmaceutically acceptable cations. Some of the compounds of this invention may form salts with pharmaceutically acceptable anions. All such salts are within the scope of this invention and they can be prepared by conventional methods such as combining the acidic and basic entities, usually in a stoichiometric ratio, in either an aqueous, nonaqueous or partially aqueous medium, as appropriate. The salts are recovered either by filtration, by precipitation with a non-solvent followed by filtration, by evaporation of the solvent, or, in the case of aqueous solutions, by lyophilization, as appropriate. The compounds are obtained in crystalline form according to procedures known in the art, such as by dissolution in an appropriate solvent(s) such as ethanol, hexanes or water/ethanol mixtures. \n\n\n The invention also embraces isotopically-labeled compounds of the invention which are identical to those recited herein, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, fluorine, iodine, and chlorine, such as \n2\nH, \n3\nH, \n11\nC, \n13\nC, \n14\nC, \n13\nN, \n15\nN, \n15\n0, \n17\n0, \n18\n0, \n31\n P, \n32\nP, \n35\nS, \n18\nF, \n123\nl, \n125\nl and \n36\nCI, respectively. \n\n\n Certain isotopically-labeled compounds of the invention (e.g., those labeled with \n3\nH and \n14\nC) are useful in compound and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Certain isotopically-labeled ligands including tritium, \n14\nC, \n35\nS and \n125\nl could be useful in radioligand binding assays. Tritiated (i.e., \n3\nH) and carbon-14 (i.e., \n14\nC) isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium (i.e., \n2\nH) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability (e.g., increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements) and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Positron emitting isotopes such as \n15\n0, \n13\nN, \n11\nC, and \n18\nF are useful for positron emission tomography (PET) studies to examine receptor occupancy. Isotopically- labeled compounds of the invention can generally be prepared by following procedures analogous to those disclosed in the Schemes and/or in the Examples herein below, by substituting an isotopically-labeled reagent for a non-isotopically-labeled reagent. \n\n Certain compounds of the invention may exist in more than one crystal form (generally referred to as \"polymorphs\"). Polymorphs may be prepared by crystallization under various conditions, for example, using different solvents or different solvent mixtures for recrystallization; crystallization at different temperatures; and/or various modes of cooling, ranging from very fast to very slow cooling during crystallization. Polymorphs may also be obtained by heating or melting the compound of the invention followed by gradual or fast cooling. The presence of polymorphs may be determined by solid probe NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, powder X-ray diffraction or such other techniques. Medical Uses \n\n\n Compounds of the invention modulate the activity of G-protein-coupled receptor GPR1 19.

The source of supply is provided in parenthesis. \n\n\nIn -Vitro Functional Assays \n\n\nβ-lactamase: \n\n\n The assay for GPR1 19 agonists utilizes a cell-based (hGPR1 19 HEK293-CRE beta-lactamase) reporter construct where agonist activation of human GPR1 19 is coupled to beta-lactamase production via a cyclic AMP response element \n\n\n(CRE). GPR1 19 activity is then measured utilizing a FRET-enabled beta-lactamase substrate, CCF4-AM (Live Blazer FRET-B/G Loading kit, Invitrogen cat # \n\n\nK1027). Specifically, hGPR1 19-HEK-CRE- beta-lactamase cells (Invitrogen 2.5 x 10\n7\n/mL) were removed from liquid nitrogen storage, and diluted in plating medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium high glucose (DMEM; Gibco Cat # 1 1995-065), 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (HIFBS; Sigma Cat # F4135), 1 X MEM Nonessential amino acids (Gibco Cat # 15630-080), 25 mM HEPES pH 7.0 (Gibco Cat # 15630-080), 200 nM potassium clavulanate (Sigma Cat # P3494). The cell \n\n concentration was adjusted using cell plating medium and 50 microL of this cell suspension (12.5 x 10\n4\n viable cells) was added into each well of a black, clear bottom, poly-d-lysine coated 384-well plate (Greiner Bio-One cat# 781946) and incubated at 37 degrees Celsius in a humidified environment containing 5% carbon dioxide. After 4 hours the plating medium was removed and replaced with 40 microL of assay medium (Assay medium is plating medium without potassium clavulanate and HIFBS). Varying concentrations of each compound to be tested was then added in a volume of 10 microL (final DMSO < 0.5%) and the cells were incubated for 16 hours at 37 degrees Celsius in a humidified environment containing 5% carbon dioxide. Plates were removed from the incubator and allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for approximately 15 minutes. 10 microL of 6 X CCF4/AM working dye solution (prepared according to instructions in the Live Blazer FRET-B/G Loading kit, Invitrogen cat # K1027) was added per well and incubated at room temperature for 2 hours in the dark. Fluorescence was measured on an EnVision fluorimetric plate reader, excitation 405 nm, emission 460 nm/535 nm. EC\n5\no determinations were made from agonist-response curves analyzed with a curve fitting program using a 4-parameter logistic dose-response equation. cAMP: \n\n\n GPR1 19 agonist activity was also determined with a cell-based assay utilizing an\n\n\nHTRF (Homogeneous Time-Resolved Fluorescence) cAMP detection kit (cAMP dynamic 2 Assay Kit; Cis Bio cat # 62AM4PEC) that measures cAMP levels in the cell. The method is a competitive immunoassay between native cAMP produced by the ceils and the cAMP labeled with the dye d2. The tracer binding is visualized by a Mab anti- cAMP labeled with Cryptate. The specific signal (i.e. energy transfer) is inversely proportional to the concentration of cAMP in either standard or sample. \n\n\n Specifically, hGPR1 19 HEK-CRE beta-lactamase cells (Invitrogen 2.5 x 10\n7\n/mL; the same cell line used in the beta-lactamase assay described above) are removed from cryopreservation and diluted in growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium high glucose (DMEM; Gibco Cat # 1 1995-065), 1 % charcoal dextran treated fetal bovine serum (CD serum; HyClone Cat # SH30068.03), 1x MEM Nonessential amino acids (Gibco Cat # 15630-080) and 25 mM HEPES pH 7.0 (Gibco Cat # 15630- 080)). The cell concentration was adjusted to 1 .5 x 10\n5\n cells/mL and 30 mLs of this suspension was added to a T-175 flask and incubated at 37 degrees Celsius in a humidified environment in 5% carbon dioxide. After 16 hours (overnight), the cells were \n\n removed from the T-175 flask (by rapping the side of the flask), centrifuged at 800 x g and then re-suspended in assay medium (1 x HBSS +CaCI\n2\n + MgCI\n2\n (Gibco Cat # 14025-092) and 25 mM HEPES pH 7.0 (Gibco Cat # 15630-080)). The cell concentration was adjusted to 6.25 x 10\n5\n cells/mL with assay medium and 8 μΙ of this cell suspension (5000 cells) was added to each well of a white Greiner 384-well, low- volume assay plate (VWR cat # 82051-458). \n\n\n Varying concentrations of each compound to be tested were diluted in assay buffer containing 3-isobutyl-1-methyixanthin (IBMX; Sigma cat # I5879) and added to the assay plate wells in a volume of 2 microL (final IBMX concentration was 400 rnicroM and final DMSO concentration was 0.58%). Following 30 minutes incubation at room temperature, 5 microL of labeled d2 cAMP and 5 microL of anti-cAMP antibody (both diluted 1 :20 in cell lysis buffer; as described in the manufacturers assay protocol) were added to each well of the assay plate. The plates were then incubated at room temperature and after 60 minutes, changes in the HTRF signal were read with an Envision 2104 multilabel plate reader using excitation of 330 nm and emissions of 615 and 665 nm. Raw data were converted to nM cAMP by interpolation from a cAMP standard curve (as described in the manufacturer's assay protocol) and EC50 determinations were made from an agonist-response curves analyzed with a curve fitting program using a 4-paramter logistic dose response equation. \n\n\n It is recognized that cAMP responses due to activation of GPR1 19 could be generated in cells other than the specific cell line used herein. β-Arrestin: \n\n\n GPR1 19 agonist activity was also determined with a cell-based assay utilizing DiscoverX PathHunter β-arrestin cell assay technology and their U20S hGPR1 19 β-arrestin cell line (DiscoverX Cat # 93-0356C3). In this assay, agonist activation is determined by measuring agonist-induced interaction of β-arrestin with activated GPR1 19. A small, 42 amino acid enzyme fragment, called ProLink was appended to the C-terminus of GPR1 19. Arrestin was fused to the larger enzyme fragment, termed EA (Enzyme Acceptor). Activation of GPR1 19 stimulates binding of arrestin and forces the complementation of the two enzyme fragments, resulting in formation of a functional β-galactosidase enzyme capable of hydrolyzing substrate and generating a \n\n\nchemiluminescent signal. \n\n\n Specifically, U20S hGPR1 19 β-arrestin cells (DiscoverX 1 x 10\n7\n/ml_) are removed from cryopreservation and diluted in growth medium (Minimum essential \n\n medium (MEM; Gibco Cat # 1 1095-080), 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (HIFBS; Sigma Cat # F4135-100), 100 mM sodium pyruvate (Sigma Cat # S8636), 500 microg/mL G418 (Sigma Cat # G8168) and 250 microg/mL Hygromycin B (Invitrogen Cat # 10687-010). The cell concentration was adjusted to 1.66 x 10\n5\n cells/mL and 30 mLs of this suspension was added to a T-175 flask and incubated at 37 degrees Celsius in a humidified environment in 5% carbon dioxide. After 48 hours, the cells were removed from the T-175 flask with enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer (Gibco cat # 13151 -014), centrifuged at 800 x g and then re-suspended in plating medium (Opti- MEM I (Invitrogen/BRL Cat # 31985-070) and 2 % charcoal dextran treated fetal bovine serum (CD serum; HyClone Cat # SH30068.03). The cell concentration was adjusted to 2.5 x 10\n5\n cells/mL with plating medium and 10 microL of this cell suspension (2500 cells) was added to each well of a white Greiner 384-well low volume assay plate (VWR cat # 82051 -458) and the plates were incubated at 37 degrees Celsius in a humidified environment in 5% carbon dioxide. \n\n\n After 16 hours (overnight) the assay plates were removed from the incubator and varying concentrations of each compound to be tested (diluted in assay buffer (1x HBSS +CaCI\n2\n + MgCI\n2\n (Gibco Cat # 14025-092), 20 mM HEPES pH 7.0 (Gibco Cat # 15630-080) and 0.1 % BSA (Sigma Cat # A9576)) were added to the assay plate wells in a volume of 2.5 microL (final DMSO concentration was 0.5 %). After a 90 minute incubation at 37 degrees Celsius in a humidified environment in 5% carbon dioxide, 7.5 microL of Galacton Star β-galactosidase substrate (PathHunter Detection Kit \n\n\n(DiscoveRx Cat # 93-0001 ); prepared as described in the manufacturers assay protocol) was added to each well of the assay plate. The plates were incubated at room temperature and after 60 minutes, changes in the luminescence were read with an Envision 2104 multilabel plate reader at 0.1 seconds per well. EC50 determinations were made from an agonist-response curves analyzed with a curve fitting program using a 4-parameter logistic dose response equation. \n\n\nExpression of GPR119 Using BacMam and GPR1 19 Binding Assay \n\n\nWild-type human GPR1 19 (Figure 1 ) was amplified via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Pfu Turbo Mater Mix, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using pIRES-puro- hGPR1 19 as a template and the following primers: \n\n\nhGPR1 19 BamH1 , Upper \n\n\n5'-TAAATTGGATCCACCATGGAATCATCTTTCTCATTTGGAG-3' \n\n (inserts a BamHI site at the 5' end) hGPR1 19 EcoRI, Lower \n\n\n 5'-TAAATTGAATTCTTATCAGCCATCAAACTCTGAGC-3' \n\n\n(inserts a EcoRI site at the 3' end) \n\n\nThe amplified product was purified (Qiaquick Kit, Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and digested with BamHI and EcoRI (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA) according to the manufacturer's protocols. The vector pFB-VSVG-CMV-poly (Figure 2) was digested with BamHI and EcoRI (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA). The digested DNA was separated by electrophoresis on a 1 % agarose gel; the fragments were excised from the gel and purified (Qiaquick Kit, Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The vector and gene fragments were ligated (Rapid Ligase Kit, Roche, Pleasanton, CA) and transformed into OneShot DH5alpha T1 R cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Eight ampicillin-resistant colonies (\"clones 1 -8\") were grown for miniprep (Qiagen Miniprep Kit, Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and sequenced to confirm identity and correct insert orientation. \n\n\n The pFB-VSVG-CMV-poly-hGPR1 19 construct (clone #1 ) was transformed into OneShot DHI OBac cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to manufacturers' protocols. Eight positive (i.e. white) colonies were re-streaked to confirm as \"positives\" and subsequently grown for bacmid isolation. The recombinant hGPR1 19 bacmid was isolated via a modified Alkaline Lysis procedure using the buffers from a Qiagen Miniprep Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Briefly, pelleted cells were lysed in buffer P1 , neutralized in buffer P2, and precipitated with buffer N3. Precipitate was pelleted via centrifugation (17,900xg for 10 minutes) and the supernatant was combined with isopropanol to precipitate the DNA. The DNA was pelleted via centrifugation (17,900xg for 30 minutes), washed once with 70% ethanol, and resuspended in 50 μ\\- buffer EB (Tris-HCL, pH 8.5). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with commercially available primers (M13F, M13R, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was used to confirm the presence of the hGPR1 19 insert in the Bacmid. \n\n\nGeneration of hGPR1 19 Recombinant Baculovirus \n\n\nCreation of P0 Virus Stock \n\n\n Suspension adapted Sf9 cells grown in Sf900ll medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were transfected with 10 microL hGPR1 19 bacmid DNA according to the manufacturer's protocol (Cellfectin, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). After five days of incubation, the \n\n conditioned medium (i.e. \"P0\" virus stock) was centrifuged and filtered through a 0.22 μΠΊ filter (Steriflip, Millipore, Billerica, MA). \n\n\nCreation of Frozen Virus (BIIC) Stocks \n\n\nFor long term virus storage and generation of working (i.e. \"P1 \") viral stocks, frozen BIIC (Baculovirus Infected Insect Cells) stocks were created as follows: suspension adapted Sf9 cells were grown in Sf900ll medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and infected with hGPR1 19 P0 virus stock. After 24 hours of growth, the infected cells were gently centrifuged (approximately 100 x g), resuspended in Freezing Medium (10% DMSO, 1 % Albumin in Sf900ll medium) to a final density of 1 x 10\n7\n cells/mL and frozen according to standard freezing protocols in 1 ml. aliquots. \n\n\nCreation of Working (\"Ρ1 Ί Virus Stock \n\n\n Suspension adapted Sf9 cells grown in Sf900ll medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were infected with a 1 :100 dilution of a thawed hGPR1 19 BIIC stock and incubated for several days (27 degrees Celsius with shaking).

Description\n\n\n\n\n BICYCLIC COMPOUNDS AS a fr NICOTINIC ACETYLCHOLINE RECEPTOR LIGANDS \n\n\nField of Invention \n\n\n The present invention relates to novel bicyclic compounds of the formula (I), and their derivatives, prodrugs, tautomers, stereoisomers, polymorphs, solvates, hydrates, metabolites, N-oxides, pharmaceutically acceptable salts and compositions containing them. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The present invention also relates to a process for the preparation of above said novel compounds, and their , derivatives, prodrugs, tautomers, stereoisomers, polymorphs, solvates, hydrates, metabolites, N-oxides, pharmaceutically acceptable salts and compositions containing them. \n\n\n These compounds are useful in the treatment and prevention of various disorders that are related to CLtJ^ nicotinic receptors. \n\n\nBackground of the Invention \n\n\n Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) or Neuronal nicotinic receptors (NNRs) mediate a very wide range of physiological effects and have been targeted for therapeutic treatment of various disorders. nAChRs belonging to the super family of ligand gated ion channels (LG1C), are widely distributed throughout the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The NNRs are understood to play an important role in regulating CNS function and the release of many neurotransmitters. Typically, NNRs are constructed from a pentameric assembly of subunit proteins. Seventeen subunits of nAChRs have been identified to date, which are identified as α2-α18, β1-β4, γ, δ, and ε. Of these subunits, eight neuronal a (a2 through a9) and three neuronal β (β2 through β4), prominently exist in the mammalian brain. (See for examples, Monteggia LM et al., Cloning and transient expression of genes encoding the human alpha4 and beta2 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits, Gene: 1995, 155:189-193; Graham A et al., Immunohistochemical localization of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits in human cerebellum, Neuroscience. 2002; 1 13:493-507). Multiple functionally distinct nAChR complexes \n\n also exist; as a homomeric functional pentamer or combinations of different subunits can complex together (see for examples, Hogg, R.C et al., Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors: from structure to brain function, Rev. Physiol, Biochem. Pharmacol, 2003, 147: 1-46). \n\n\n The identification of a family of genes coding for the nAChRs and increased knowledge of their expression and function in the central nervous system have lead to the increasing attention concerning their potential as drug targets. (See examples, Hogg R.C et al., Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors as Drug Targets, Curr. Drug Targets: CNS Neurol. Disord. 2004, 3: 123-130; Suto et al., Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors as drug targets, Expert Opin. Ther. Targets 2004, 8: 61 -64). \n\n\n There are many potential therapeutic uses for neuronal nicotinic 0462 receptor ligands in humans based on direct effects and on indications from available scientific studies. Neuronal nicotinic α\n4\nβ\n2\n receptors have been implicated in different therapies like cognitive disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, Schizophrenia and Tourette's syndrome (See examples, Newhouse et al., Effects of nicotinic stimulation on cognitive performance, Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2004, 4: 36-46; Levin E.D et al., Nicotinic Treatment for Cognitive Dysfunction, Curr. Drug Targets: CNS Neurol. Disord. 2002, 1 : 423-431 ; Graham A.J. et al., Human Brain Nicotinic Receptors, their Distribution and Participation in Neuropsychiatric Disorders, Curr. Drug Targets: CNS Neurol. Disord. 2002, 1 : 387- 397; McEvoy J.P et al., The Importance of Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors in Schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder and Tourette's Syndrome, Curr. Drug Targets: CNS Neurol. Disord. 2002, 1 : 433-442). \n\n\n Studies in a variety of rodent pain models have demonstrated that 0^2 receptor ligands have the potential for highly efficacious treatments in a variety of pain states and inflammation. (See examples, Vincler et al., Neuronal nicotinic receptors as targets for novel analgesics, Expert Opin. Invest. Drugs, 2005, 14: 1 191 -1 198; Decker MW et al., The therapeutic potential of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists for pain control, Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2001 Oct; 10(10): 1819-30; Miao et al., Central terminals of nociceptors are targets for nicotine suppression of inflammation, Neuroscience 2004, 123: 777-84). \n\n\n Significant efforts are being made to understand the hypercholinergic neurotransmission, which is associated with depressed mood states suggesting that it may be mediated through excessive neuronal nicotinic receptor activation and that the \n\n therapeutic actions of many antidepressants may be, in part, mediated through inhibition of these receptors. Thus the neuronal nicotinic 0462 receptor ligands may represent a novel class of therapeutic agents for treating depression and anxiety disorders (See examples, Shytle et al., Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors as targets for antidepressants, Mol. Psychiatry 2002, 7: 525-35; Shytle et al., Neuronal nicotinic receptor inhibition for treating mood disorders: preliminary controlled evidence with mecamylamine, Depress. Anxiety, 2002, 16: 89-92). Recent studies have also been reported that the nAChRs play a role in neurodegenerative disorders. The nicotine and subtype selective nAChR ligands can provide neuroprotection in in-vitro cell culture systems and in in-vivo studies in animal models of such disorders. (See examples, O'Neill et al., The role of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in acute and chronic neurodegeneration, Curr. Drug Targets: CNS Neurol. Disord. 2002, 1 : 399- 41 1). \n\n\n The α\n4\nβ\n2\n nAChR subtype has the highest affinity for nicotine and is the primary candidate for mediating nicotine's central effects. Chronic nicotine exposure (in humans, animals and cell culture systems) leads to an increase in the number of 0462 nAChR (upregulation), with functional implications for withdrawal. These studies suggested that the neuronal nicotinic α\n4\nβ\n2\n receptor ligands play a critical role in the treatment of addiction. (Dwoskin et al., A novel mechanism of action and potential use for lobeline as a treatment for psychostimulant abuse, Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002, 63: 89-98; Coe et al., 3,5-Bicyclic aryl piperidines: a novel class of ot4B\n2\n nAChR partial agonists for smoking cessation, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2005, 15: 4889-97). The d4B\n2\n receptor ligands are also expected to be of use in the treatment of obesity (Li et al., Nicotine, body weight and potential implications in the treatment of obesity, Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2003, 3: 899-919). \n\n\n Taken together, the above studies strongly suggest that compounds which are α\n4\nβ\n2\n receptor modulators, i.e. ligands, may be useful for therapeutic indications including, the treatment of diseases associated with a deficit in memory, cognition and learning such as Alzheimer's and attention deficit disorder; the treatment of personality disorders such as schizophrenia; the treatment of behavioral disorders, e.g. anxiety, depression and obsessive compulsive disorders; the treatment of pain and inflammation; the treatment of motion or motor disorders such as Parkinson's disease and epilepsy; the treatment of diseases associated with neurodegeneration such as \n\n stroke or head trauma or withdrawal from drug addiction including addiction to nicotine, alcohol and other substances of abuse and obesity. \n\n\n Patent publications WO2008057938 (Al), US20040192673 (Al) and EP296560 (Bl) disclose series of compounds as ligands of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and are claimed to be useful in the treatment of various CNS disorders. While some nicotinic acetylcholine receptor compounds have been disclosed, there continues to be a need for compounds that are useful for modulating nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. In our research in area of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, we found that bicyclic compounds of formula (I) demonstrate very high nicotinic acetylcholine receptor affinity. Therefore, it is an object of this invention to provide compounds, which are useful as therapeutic agents in the treatment/prevention of a variety of central nervous system disorders or disorders affected by the θ4β\n2\n nicotinic receptors. \n\n\nSummary of the Invention \n\n\n The present invention relates to novel bicyclic compounds of the formula (I), and their derivatives, prodrugs, tautomers, stereoisomers, polymorphs, solvates, hydrates, metabolites, N-oxides, pharmaceutically acceptable salts and compositions containing them. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein R represents aryl or heteroaryl; \n\n\n Ri represents hydrogen, alkyl or cycloalkyl; \n\n\n R\n2\n represents hydrogen, alkyl, alkoxy, cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, cycloalkoxy, aryl, heteroaryl, heterocyclyl or heterocyclylalkyl; \n\n\n R\n3\n represents hydrogen, hydroxy, halogen, oxo, thio, nitro, amide, amine, carboxylic, alkyl, alkoxy, cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, cycloalkoxy, haloalkyl, haloalkoxy, heterocyclyl or heterocyclylalkyl; \n\n\n \"X\" represents C, O, N, S; \n\n\n \"m\" represents 1 to 4; \n\n\n \"n\" represents 1 to 2; \n\n\n \"p\" represents 0 to 2; \n\n \"q\" represents 0 to 1. \n\n\nThe present invention relates to use of a therapeutically effective amount of compound of formula (I), to manufacture a medicament in the treatment and prevention of various disorders that are related to OA&Z nicotinic receptors. \n\n\n Specifically, the compounds of this invention are useful in the treatment of various disorders such as anxiety, alzheimer's disease, depression, convulsive disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorders, cognitive memory disorders, ADHD (Attention Deficient Disorder/Hyperactivity Syndrome), pain, inflammation, personality disorders, psychosis, paraphrenia, psychotic depression, parkinson's disease, mania, schizophrenia, panic disorders, sleep disorders, withdrawal from drug abuse syndrome, stroke, head trauma, mild cognitive impairment, neurodegenerative disorders and obesity. \n\n\n In another aspect, the invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing a therapeutically effective amount of at least one compound of formula (I), and their derivatives, prodrugs, tautomers, stereoisomers, polymorphs, solvates, hydrates, metabolites, N-oxides and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, in admixture with at least one suitable carrier, diluents, adjuvants or excipients. \n\n\n In another aspect, the invention also provides a radiolabeled compound of formula (I) for use in medical diagnosis or therapy, as well as the use of a radiolabeled compound of formula (I) to prepare a medicament useful in the treatment of various disorders that are related to a4¾ nicotinic receptors. \n\n\n In another aspect, the invention relates to the use of a compound according to the present invention in combination with at least one further active ingredient for manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or prevention of diseases and conditions. \n\n\n In still another aspect, the invention relates to compositions comprising and methods for using compounds of formula (I). \n\n\n In yet another aspect, the invention further relates to the process for preparing compounds of formula (I) and their derivatives, prodrugs, tautomers, stereoisomers, polymorphs, solvates, hydrates, metabolites, N-oxides and pharmaceutically acceptable salts. \n\n\n Representative compounds of the present invention include those specified below and their derivatives, prodrugs, tautomers, stereoisomers, polymorphs, solvates, \n\n hydrates, metabolites, N-oxides and pharmaceutically acceptable salts.

Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles and may contain formulating agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for reconstitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile pyrogen-free water, before use. \n\n\n The active compounds of the invention may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g., containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides. \n\n\n For intranasal administration or administration by inhalation, the active compounds of the invention are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray from a pressurized container or a nebulizer or from a capsule using an inhaler or insufflators. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, a suitable propellant, e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas and the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. The medicament for pressurized container or nebulizer may contain a solution or suspension of the active compound while for a capsule; it preferably should be in the form of powder. Capsules and cartridges (made, for example, from gelatin) for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a powder mix of a compound of the invention and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch. \n\n\n Aerosol formulations for treatment of the conditions referred to above (e.g., migraine) in the average adult human are preferably arranged so that each metered dose or \"puff' of aerosol contains 20 μg to 1000 μg of the compound of the invention. The overall daily dose with an aerosol will be within the range 100 μg to 10 mg.

Therefore, any reference herein to a pharmacologically effective amount of the compounds of general formula (I) refers to the aforementioned factors. A proposed dose of the active compounds of this invention, for either oral, parenteral, nasal or buccal administration, to an average adult human, for the treatment of the conditions referred to above, is 0.1 to 200 mg of the active ingredient per unit dose which could be administered, for example, 1 to 4 times per day. \n\n\nMethods of Preparation \n\n\n The compounds of formula (I) can be prepared by Scheme I as shown below. \n\n\n Scheme I \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The compound of formula (8) is allowed to react with hydroxy compound of formula (9) to form compound of formula (10). The compound of formula (10) is converted to deprotected compound of formula (11). The compound of formula (11) is converted to compound of formula (I). \n\n\n In the first step of the above preparation, the compound, of formula (8) is reacted with compound of formula (9) using Mitsunobu reaction conditions to obtain compound of formula (10). This reaction is preferably carried out in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, toluene, dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethyl ether and the like or a mixture thereof and preferably by using tetrahydrofuran. The reaction may be affected in the presence of reagents such as diethyl azodicarboxylate, diisopropyl azodicarboxylate, phosphino reagents, such as tricyclohexylphosiphine, triorthotolylphosphine, triphenyl phosphine or mixtures thereof and preferably by using triphenyl phosphine. The reaction temperature may range from -10 °C to 50 °C based on the choice of solvent and preferably at a temperature in the range from -5 °C to 50 °C. The duration of the reaction may range from 12 to 20 hours, preferably from a period of 14 to 18 hours. \n\n\n In the second step of the above preparation, the compound of formula (10) is converted to the compound of formula (11). This reaction is preferably carried out using hydrochloric acid or trifluoro acid in a solvent such as ethanol, tetrahydrofuran, toluene, acetic acid, ethyl acetate, isopropanol, diethyl ether, dichloromethane and the like or a mixture thereof and preferably by using isopropanol. The duration of the reaction may range from 1 to 4 hours, preferably from a period of 1 to 3 hours. \n\n\n In the third step of the above preparation, the compound of formula (11) is converted in to general formula (I). This reaction is preferably carried out in a solvent \n\n such as ethanol, tetrahydrofuran, toluene, water, dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide and the like or a mixture thereof. The reaction temperature may range from 40 °C to 120 °C based on the choice of solvent and preferably at a temperature in the range from 60 °C to 100 °C. The duration of the reaction may range from 1 to 5 hours, preferably from a period of 2 to 4 hours. \n\n\n The starting material of formula (8) is synthesized as described in step (vii) of preparation 1. This starting material may be commercially available or they may be prepared by conventional methods or by modifying the existing known processes. The starting material of formula (9) may be commercially available or they may be prepared by conventional methods or by modification, using known processes. \n\n\n Compounds obtained by the above method of preparation of the present invention can be transformed into another compound of this invention by further chemical modifications using well-known reactions such as oxidation, reduction, protection, deprotection, rearrangement reaction, halogenation, hydroxylation, alkylation, alkylthiolation, demethylation, O-alkylation, O-acylation, N-alkylation, N- alkenylation, N-acylation, N-cyanation, N-sulfonylation, coupling reaction using transition metals and the like. \n\n\n If necessary, any one or more than one of the following steps can be carried out, i) Converting a compound of the formula (I) into another compound of the formula (I) \n\n\nii) Removing any protecting groups; or \n\n\niii) Forming a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate or a prodrug thereof. \n\n\n Process (i) may be performed using conventional interconversion procedures such as epimerisation, oxidation, reduction, alkylation, and nucleophilic or electrophilic aromatic substitution and ester hydrolysis or amide bond formation. \n\n\n In process (ii) examples of protecting groups and the means for their removal can be found in T. W. Greene 'Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis' (J. Wiley and Sons, 1991). Suitable amine protecting groups include sulfonyl (e.g. tosyl), acyl (e.g. acetyl, 2',2',2'-trichloroethoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl or t-butoxycarbonyl) and arylalkyl (eg. benzyl), which may be removed by hydrolysis (e. g. using an acid such as hydrochloric or trifluoroacetic acid) or reductively (e.g. hydrogenolysis of a benzyl group or reductive removal of a 2',2\n,\n,2'-trichloroethoxycarbonyl group using zinc in acetic acid) as appropriate. Other suitable amine protecting groups include \n\n trifluoroacetyl, which may be removed by base catalyzed hydrolysis or a solid phase resin bound benzyl group, such as a Merrifield resin bound 2,6-dimethoxybenzyl group (Ellman linker), which may be removed by acid catalyzed hydrolysis, for example with trifluoroacetic acid. \n\n\n In process (iii) halogenation, hydroxyiation, alkylation and/or pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be prepared conventionally by reaction with the appropriate acid or acid derivative as described earlier in detail. \n\n\n Certain compounds of formula (I) are capable, of existing in stereoisomeric forms (e. g. diastereomers and enantiomers) and the invention extends to each of these stereoisomeric forms and to mixtures thereof including racemates. The different stereoisomeric forms may be separated from one another by the usual methods or any given isomer may be obtained by stereospecific or asymmetric synthesis. The invention also extends to tautomeric forms and mixtures thereof. \n\n\n The stereoisomers as a rule are generally obtained as racemates that can be separated into the optically active isomers in a manner known per se. In the case of the compounds of general formula (I) having an asymmetric carbon atom the present invention relates to the D-form, the L-form and D,L - mixtures and in the case of compound of general formula (I) containing a number of asymmetric carbon atoms, the diastereomeric forms and the invention extends to each of these stereo isomeric forms and to mixtures thereof including racemates. Those compounds of general formula (I) which have an asymmetric carbon and as a rule are obtained as racemates can be separated one from the other by the usual methods, or any given isomer may be obtained by stereo specific or asymmetric synthesis. However, it is also possible to employ an optically active compound from the start, a correspondingly optically active enantiomeric or diastereomeric compound then being obtained as the final compound. \n\n\n The stereoisomers of compounds of general formula (I) may be prepared by one or more ways presented below: \n\n\ni) One or more of the reagents may be used in their optically active form. \n\n\nii) Optically pure catalyst or chiral ligands along with metal catalyst may be employed in the reduction process. The metal catalyst may be Rhodium, Ruthenium, Indium and the like. The chiral ligands may preferably be chiral phosphines (Principles of Asymmetric synthesis, J. E. Baldwin Ed., Tetrahedron series, 14, 31 1-316). \n\n\niii) The mixture of stereoisomers may be resolved by conventional methods such as forming diastereomeric salts with chiral acids or chiral amines or chiral amino alcohols, \n\n chiral amino acids. The resulting mixture of diastereomers may then be separated by methods such as fractional crystallization, chromatography and the like, which is followed by an additional step of isolating the optically active product by hydrolyzing the derivative (Jacques et. al., \"Enantiomers, Racemates and Resolution\", Wiley Interscience, 1981). \n\n\niv) The mixture of stereoisomers may be resolved by conventional methods such as microbial resolution, resolving the diastereomeric salts formed with chiral acids or chiral bases. \n\n\n Chiral acids that can be employed may be tartaric acid, mandelic acid, lactic acid, camphorsulfonic acid, amino acids and the like. Chiral bases that can be employed may be cinchona alkaloids, brucine or a basic amino acid such as lysine, arginine and the like. In the case of the compounds of general formula (I) containing geometric isomerism the present invention relates to all of these geometric isomers. \n\n\n Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts will be apparent to those skilled in the art and include those described in J. Pharm. Sci., 1977, 66, 1-19, such as acid addition salts formed with inorganic acids e. g. hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, nitric or phosphoric acid and organic acids e. g. succinic, maleic, acetic, fumaric, citric, malic, tartaric, benzoic, p-toluic, p-toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic or naphthalenesulfonic acid. The present invention includes, within its scope, all possible stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric forms. \n\n\n The pharmaceutically acceptable salts forming a part of this invention may be prepared by treating the compound of formula (I) with 1 -6 equivalents of a base such as sodium hydride, sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium t- butoxide, calcium hydroxide, calcium acetate, calcium chloride, magnesium hydroxide, magnesium chloride and the like. Solvents such as water, acetone, ether, THF, methanol, ethanol, t-butanol, dioxane, isopropanol, isopropyl ether or mixtures thereof may be used. \n\n\n The compounds of formula (I) may be prepared in crystalline or non-crystalline form and if crystalline, may optionally be solvated, eg. as the hydrate. This invention includes within its scope stoichiometric solvates (eg. hydrates) as well as compounds containing variable amounts of solvent (eg. water). \n\n\n Various polymorphs of compound of general formula (I) forming part of this invention may be prepared by crystallization of compound of formula (I), under different conditions. For example, using different solvents commonly used or their \n\n mixtures for recrystallization, crystallizations at different temperatures; various modes of cooling ranging from very fast to very slow cooling during crystallizations. Polymorphs may also be obtained by gradual or fast cooling of compound after heating or melting. The presence of polymorphs may be determined by solid probe NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, powder X-ray diffraction or such other techniques. \n\n\n Pharmaceutically acceptable solvates of the compounds of formula (I) forming part of this invention may be prepared by conventional methods such as dissolving the compounds of formula (I) in solvents such as water, methanol, ethanol, mixture of solvents such as acetone-water, dioxane-water, Ν,Ν-dimethylformamide-water and the like, preferably water and recrystallizing by using different crystallization techniques. \n\n\n Prodrugs of the present application may be prepared from compound of formula (I) by using known process: Conventional procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable prodrug derivatives are described, for example, in Design of prodrugs (1985); Wihnan, Biochem Soc. Trans.1986, 14, 375-82; Stella et al., Prodrugs: A chemical approach to targeted drug delivery in directed drug delivery, 1985, 247-67, each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. \n\n\n Tautomers of compounds of formula (I) can be prepared by using known process. Procedures for preparation of suitable Tautomers are described, for example in Smith MB, March J (2001). Advanced Organic Chemistry (5th ed.)

New York: Academic Press. \n\n\n N-Oxides of compounds of formula (I) can be prepared by using known process. Procedures for preparation of suitable N-Oxides are described, March's Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure Michael B. Smith, Jerry March Wiley-Interscience, 5th edition, 2001. \n\n\n Hydrates of compounds of formula (I) can be prepared by using known process.\n\n\nIn the case of the compounds of general formula (I) containing geometric isomerism the present invention relates to all of these geometric isomers. \n\n\nExamples \n\n\n The novel compounds of the present invention were prepared according to the following procedures, using appropriate materials and are further exemplified by the following specific examples.

Chem. 2007, 50, 36-27. \n\n\n Example 51 : Determination of ICso and K\nb\n values for Nicotinic Acetylcholine 0462 receptor ligands \n\n\n A stable CHO cell line expressing recombinant human α\n4\nβ\n2\n nicotinic acetylcholine receptor transiently expressing aequorin protein was used for cell-based assay. The assay offers a non-radioactive based approach to determine binding of a compound to ligand gated ion channels. In this specific assay, the level of intracellular \n\n calcium which is modulated by activation or inhibition of the channel is measured. Both the channel and aequorin genes are expressed at high level under the control of powerful C V promoter. \n\n\n The above cells were grown in 96 well clear bottom white plates in Hams F12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Prior to the addition of compounds and / or agonist, cells were serum starved for six hours. Coelentarazine (a prosthetic group for aequorin protein) was added in the medium containing 0.1 % dialyzed serum and incubated overnight at 27 °C. Cells were washed with assay buffer and increasing concentration of the test compound or standard were added to the plate for antagonist mode. A fixed concentration of the agonist (eipbatidine) was injected into the plate and luminescence was measured for 10 seconds. For evaluation of the compound in agonist mode, increasing concentration of the standard or test compound was injected and the luminescence was measured. Luminescence units were plotted against the compound concentrations using Graphpad software. IC50 values of the compounds were defined as the concentration required in reducing the luminescent units by 50 %. The K\nb\n values were calculated by feeding the concentration of the agonist used in the assay and its EC50 value in the same software. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiterature References: Karadsheh M.

Example 52: Rodent Pharmacokinetic Study \n\n\n Male wistar rats (230 - 280 grams) obtained from NIN (National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, India) were used as an experimental animal. Three to five \n\n animals were housed in each cage. Animals were kept fasted over night and maintained on a 12 hours light dark cycle. Three rats were dosed NCE orally (15 mg Kg) and intravenously (5 mg/Kg) on day 0 and day 2. \n\n\n At each time point blood was collected by jugular vein. Plasma was stored 5 frozen at -20°C until analysis. The concentrations of the NCE compound in plasma were determined using LC-MS MS method. Schedule time points: Pre dose 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 24 hours after dosing (n=3). The NCE compounds were quantified in plasma by validated LC-MS/MS method using solid phase extraction technique. NCE compounds were quantified in the calibration range of 1 -2000 ng/mL 10 in plasma.

Three animals were housed in each cage. Animals were given water and food ad libitum throughout the experiment, and maintained on a 12 hours light/dark cycle. \n\n\n NCE compound was dissolved in water and administered orally. At T\nmax\n (0.5, \n\n\n1.0 and 2.0) animals were sacrificed to collect the plasma and brain tissue and was homogenized. Plasma and Brain was stored frozen at -20 °C until analysis. The \n\n concentrations of the NCE compound in plasma and Brain were determined using LC- MS MS method. \n\n\n The NCE compounds were quantified in plasma and brain homogenate by validated LC-MS/MS method using solid phase extraction technique. NCE compounds were quantified in the calibration range of 1 -500 ng/mL in plasma and brain homogenate. Study samples were analyzed using calibration samples in the batch and quality control samples spread across the batch. Extents of brain-blood ratio were calculated (C\nb\n/C\np\n). \n\n\n \n\n Example 54: Object Recognition Task Model \n\n\n The cognition-enhancing properties of compounds of this invention were estimated using a model of animal cognition: the object recognition task model. \n\n Male Wister rats (230 - 280 grams) obtained from N. 1. N. (National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, India) was used as experimental animals. Four animals were housed in each cage. Animals were kept on 20 % food deprivation before one day and given water ad libitum throughout the experiment and maintained on a 12 hours light/dark cycle. Also the rats were habituated to individual arenas for 1 hour in the absence of any objects. \n\n\n One group of 12 rats received vehicle (1 mL/Kg) orally and another set of animals received compound of the formula (I) either orally or i.p.. before one hour of the familiar (Tl ) and choice trial (T2). \n\n\n The experiment was carried out in a 50 x 50 x 50 cm open field made up of acrylic. In the familiarization phase, (Tl), the rats were placed individually in the open field for 3 minutes, in which two identical objects (plastic bottles, 12.5 cm height x 5.5 cm diameter) covered in yellow masking tape alone (al and a2) were positioned in two adjacent corners, 10 cm. from the walls. After 24 hours of the (Tl ) trial for long-term memory test, the same rats were placed in the same arena as they were placed in Tl trial. Choice phase (T2) rats were allowed to explore the open field for 3 minutes in presence of one familiar object (a3) and one novel object (b) (Amber color glass bottle, 12 cm high and 5 cm in diameter). Familiar objects presented similar textures, colors and sizes. During the Tl and T2 trial, explorations of each object (defined as sniffing, licking, chewing or having moving vibrissae whilst directing the nose towards the object at a distance of less than 1 cm) were recorded separately by stopwatch. Sitting on an object was not regarded as exploratory activity, however, it was rarely observed. Tl is the total time spent exploring the familiar objects (al+a2). \n\n\nT2 is the total time spent exploring the familiar object and novel object (a3+b). \n\n\nThe object recognition test was performed as described by Ennaceur, A., Delacour, J., 1988, A new one-trial test for neurobiological studies of memory in rats - Behavioural data, Behav. Brain Res., 31 , 47-59. \n\n\n Some representative compounds have shown positive effects indicating the increased novel object recognition viz: increased exploration time with novel object and higher discrimination index. \n\n\n \n\n 1. 0.1 mg/kg 7.75 ± 0.84 12.65 ± 1.96 Active\n\n\n7. 1 mg/kg 6.81 ± 1.49 16.70 ± 3.19 Active \n\n\nExample 55: Water Maze \n\n\n Water maze consisted of a 1.8 m diameter; 0.6 m high circular water maze tub filled with water. A platform was placed 1.0 cm below the water surface in the center of one of the four imaginary quadrants, which remained constant for all the rats. Rats were administered with vehicle or test compound before acquisition training and half hour after administration of vehicle or test compound; scopolamine was administered. Rats were lowered gently, feet first into water. A rat was allowed to swim for 60 seconds to find the platform. If the platform was found during this time the trial was stopped and rat was allowed to stay on platform for 30 seconds before being removed from the maze. If the platform was not found during 60 seconds trials, then the rat was manually placed on the platform. Each rat received 4 trials in a day. Retention of the task was assessed on 5th day in which each animal received a single 120 seconds probe trial in which platform removed from the pool. Time spent in target quadrant (ms) (quadrant in which platform is placed during acquisition training was calculated for probe trial. Latency to reach the platform (ms), swim speed (cm/s) and path length (cm) was measured in acquisition trials. \n\n\nExample 56: Mouse Forced Swim Assay \n\n\n The animals were administered with vehicle or test drug prior to testing. Then the animals were individually placed inside the plexiglass cylinder containing water for 6 min. The initial 2 minutes will be not be scored and remaining 4 minutes was observed for immobility behavior. Immobility behavior is defined as no movement of animal except little action to keep the head above the water level. The water was changed after every trial. \n\n\nExample 57: DRL-72s \n\n\n The antidepressant properties of compounds of this invention were evaluated using a model of animal depression: the DRL-72s model. Male Sprague Dawley rats were used as experimental animals. Rats are trained to lever press for a 4\" access to .025 mL of water for each correct response during daily 60 minute sessions. All testing takes place on weekdays only. At the beginning of each session, the house light is illuminated and remains lit until the session ends. No other stimuli are presented \n\n during testing. After successful lever press training, rats are then required to respond under a DRL-24 second schedule, where only lever presses that are separated by 24 seconds are reinforced. Upon stable responding on a DRL-24 second schedule (5-10 sessions), rats are trained on a DRL-72 second schedule until responding stabilizes at approximately 15% efficiency (approx 25-35 sessions). Specifically, rats receive a reinforcer for each response that is emitted at least 72 seconds after the previous response (IRT). Responses with IRT's less than 72 seconds do not receive a reinforcer, and the IRT requirement is reset to 72 seconds. Efficiency is recorded as number of reinforced responses ÷ total number of responses. After stable baseline responding is achieved, defined as responding for 4 consecutive sessions with no more than 10% variability, animals begin drug testing. Animals receive drug no more than Ix per week. \n\n\n \n\n Example 58: Reversal of Formalin Induced Nociception \n\n\n The anti-nociceptive properties of compounds of this invention were evaluated using a model of pain: the Formalin Induced Nociception model. Male Wister rats (230 - 280 grams) obtained from N. I. N. (National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, India) was used as experimental animals. \n\n\nRats were habituated for 20 , minutes in the arena before the experiment was started. Duration of licks, bites and flinches were noted from 0-10 minutes and 20-35 minutes after administration of formalin, subplantar into the right hind paw at concentrations of 5 % v/v. 50μΙ_. of water for injection was injected into the right hind paw of the rats of the sham group. Compounds of this invention were administered orally prior to formalin administration. \n\n\n \n\n Example 59: Acute Food Intake Study \n\n\n The appetite suppressing properties of compounds of this invention were studied using an animal model of hyperphagia. \n\n\n Male Wistar rats (200 - 210 grams) obtained from Raj Biotech, India were used as experimental animals. The experiment consisted of 6 days. The rats were adapted to the 18 hour fasting and 6 hour feeding pattern. The animals were housed in a group of three in the cages provided with the fasting grills and were fasted for 18 hours. After 18 hour fasting the rats were separated and placed individually in a cage. Weighed amount of feed was provided to rats for 6 hour and the feed intake at 1 , 2, 4 and 6 hours was recorded. Again the rats were regrouped and fasted for 18 hour. The above procedure was followed for 5 days. The average cumulative food intake by the rats on the last 3 days was calculated. Animals were randomised on the basis of their last three days food intake. \n\n\n One group of 8 rats received vehicle (2 mL/Kg) orally and another set of animals received compound of the formula (1) orally. Then the rats were given access to food and the food intake at 1 , 2, 4 and 6 hours was recorded. The food intake by the rats treated with test compound was compared with the vehicle treated group by using students't' test. \n\n\n Following compound shown positive effects indicating the suppression of food intake i.e. hypophagia like effects. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 60: Effect of test compounds on body weight gain in high fat fed rats. \n\n\n The body weight gain suppressing properties of compounds of this invention were studied using a animal model of obesity. \n\n\n Male Sprague Dawley rats (150 - 160 grams) obtained from Reliance Life Sciences, India were used as experimental animals. Rats were fed with control diet (normal pellet diet) and lard based high fat diet (45 % kcal diet) for 7-8 weeks. High fat diet fed animals was randomized according to their body weights. The animals were \n\n housed in a group of 3-4 per cage. One group of 10 rats received vehicle (2 mL Kg) orally and another set of animals received compound of the formula (I) orally for 14 days. Body weight of the animals was recorded for first three consecutive days then it was recorded twice weekly. Weighed amount of food was given to the animals and food intake was recorded every 24 hour for the entire study period. \n\n\n Following compound shown positive effects indicating the decrease in the body weight gain."
