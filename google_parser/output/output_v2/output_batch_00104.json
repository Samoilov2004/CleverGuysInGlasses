Nos. 60/417,232, filed Oct. 9, 2002; 60/447,611, filed Feb. 13, 2003; 60/464,754, filed Apr. 22, 2003; and 60/480,353, filed Jun. 20, 2003, which are incorporated in their entirety by reference.\n\n\n \nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates generally to detection and treatment of disease associated with expression of amyloid-beta peptide (Aβ), such as Alzheimer's disease and Down's syndrome. The invention is more specifically related to antibodies directed against Aβ and its precursor, βAPP. The invention thus provides immunotherapeutic compositions and methods useful in the detection and treatment of disease associated with over-expression (or accumulation) of Aβ and βAPP.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative brain disorder characterized clinically by progressive memory deficits, confusion, gradual physical deterioration and, ultimately, death. Approximately 15 million people worldwide are affected by Alzheimer's disease, and the number is expected to increase dramatically as lifespans increase. Histologically, the disease is characterized by neuritic plaques, found primarily in the association cortex, limbic system and basal ganglia. The major constituent of these plaques is amyloid beta peptide (Aβ), which is the cleavage product of beta amyloid precursor protein (βAPP or APP). APP is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that contains a large ectopic N-terminal domain, a transmembrane domain, and a small cytoplasmic C-terminal tail. Alternative splicing of the transcript of the single APP gene on chromosome 21 results in several isoforms that differ in the number of amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAβ appears to have a central role in the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease. Familial forms of the disease have been linked to mutations in APP and the presenilin genes (Tanzi et al., 1996, Neurobiol. Dis. 3:159-168; Hardy, 1996, Ann. Med. 28:255-258). Diseased-linked mutations in these genes result in increased production of the 42-amino acid form of Aβ, the predominant form found in amyloid plaques. Moreover, immunization of transgenic mice that overexpress a disease-linked mutant form of APP with human Aβ reduces plaque burden and associated pathologies (Schenk et al., 1999, Nature 400:173-177), and peripheral administration of antibodies directed against Aβ also reduces plaque burden in the brain (Bard et al., 2000, Nature Medicine 6(8):916-919).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody therapy therefore provides a promising approach to the treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease. There remains a need for antibodies and other immunotherapeutic agents directed against Aβ having improved efficacy, and which are suitable for use with human patients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThroughout this application various publications (including patents and patent applications) are referenced. The disclosures of these publications in their entireties are hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention provides isolated monoclonal antibodies that bind to Aβ peptide (SEQ ID NO:1) (Table 6).

The anti-Aβ antibodies disclosed herein bind with high affinity and without cross-reactivity with βAPP, making them particularly suitable for use in methods for detecting and treating Alzheimer's disease and other diseases associated with altered Aβ expression, such as Down's syndrome. In one embodiment, the invention provides antibodies directed against C terminal portions of Aβ peptide. In one embodiment, the C terminal portion of Aβ peptide to which the antibody is directed includes amino acids 28-40. In some embodiments, the antibody preferentially binds to an epitope that includes amino acid 39 and/or 40 of Aβ\n1-40\n. In some embodiments, the antibody preferentially binds to an epitope that includes amino acids 36-40 of Aβ\n1-40\n. In some embodiments, the antibody binds to the C terminal portion Aβ\n1-40 \nwith an affinity of about 200 nM or less, about 150 nM or less, about 100 nM or less, about 60 nM or less, about 30 nM or less, or about 3 nM or less, about 2 nM or less, about 1 nM or less. In some embodiments, antibody preferentially binds to an epitope that includes amino acid 39 and/or 40 of Aβ\n1-40 \nwith an affinity of about 200 nM or less, about 150 nM or less, about 100 nM or less, about 60 nM or less, about 30 nM or less, or about 3 nM or less, about 2 nM or less, about 1 nM or less. In some embodiments, antibody preferentially binds to an epitope that includes amino acids 36-40 of Aβ\n1-40 \nwith an affinity of about 200 nM or less, about 150 nM or less, about 100 nM or less, about 60 nM or less, about 30 nM or less, or about 3 nM or less, about 2 nM or less, about 1 nM or less. The therapeutic utility of antibodies directed against the C terminal portion of Aβ peptide is based on the surprising discovery that such antibodies are capable of removing Aβ deposits and thioflavine-S deposits (indicative of a toxic fibrillar form of deposits) in brain tissue of an animal model for Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe discovery that antibodies directed to amino acids 28-40 (in some embodiments, epitope that includes amino acid 39 and/or 40 of Aβ (SEQ ID NO:1), or amino acids 36-40 of Aβ (SEQ ID NO:1)) of Aβ are effective at removing fibrillar deposits in an animal model of Alzheimer's disease contrasts with the reports of others. As reviewed by Schenk (October 2002, Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 3(10):824-8), not all anti-Aβ antibodies can effectively reduce pathology in the brain, and those that can reduce pathology are limited to antibodies directed against the first 16 amino acids of Aβ (Bacskai et al., 2002, J. Neurosci. 22(18):7873-8; Bard et al., 2000, Nature Med. 6:916-919), or amino acids 16-28 (DeMattos et al., 2001, Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. 98(15):8850-55; DeMattos et al., 2002, Science 295(5563):2264-7; Dodart et al., 2002 Nat. Neuroscience 5(5):452-7). In contrast, antibodies directed to the carboxy terminal (e.g., amino acids 33-42) failed to reduce amyloid burden in the brain (Bacskai 2002, supra; Bard 2000, supra).\n\n\n \nDEFINITIONS\n\n\n \n \n \nAll scientific and technical terms used in this application have meanings commonly used in the art unless otherwise specified. As used in this application, the following words or phrases have the meanings specified.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “antibody” includes intact immunoglobulin or antibody molecules, polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies formed from at least two intact antibodies) and immunoglobulin fragments (such as Fab, F(ab′)\n2\n, or Fv), so long as they exhibit any of the desired specific binding properties described herein. Antibodies are typically proteins or polypeptides that exhibit binding specificity to a specific antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “monoclonal antibody” refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally-occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore, in contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations, which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. The modifier “monoclonal” indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by the hybridoma method first described by Kohler and Milstein, 1975, Nature, 256:495, or may be made by recombinant DNA methods such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567. The monoclonal antibodies may also be isolated from phage libraries generated using the techniques described in McCafferty et al., 1990, Nature, 348:552-554, for example.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “humanized” antibodies refers to forms of non-human (e.g. murine) antibodies that are specific chimeric immunoglobulins, immunoglobulin chains, or fragments thereof (such as Fv, Fab, Fab′, F(ab′)\n2 \nor other antigen-binding subsequences of antibodies) that contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. For the most part, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a complementary determining region (CDR) of the recipient are replaced by residues from a CDR of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, or rabbit having the desired specificity, affinity, and capacity. In some instances, Fv framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, the humanized antibody may comprise residues that are found neither in the recipient antibody nor in the imported CDR or framework sequences, but are included to further refine and optimize antibody performance. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. The humanized antibody optimally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region or domain (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. Preferred are antibodies having Fc regions modified as described in WO 99/58572. Other forms of humanized antibodies have one or more CDRs (one, two, three, four, five, six) which are altered with respect to the original antibody, which are also termed one or more CDRs “derived from” one or more CDRs from the original antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe variable regions of the heavy and light chain each consist of four framework regions (FR) connected by three complementarity determining regions (CDRs) also known as hypervariable regions. The CDRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FRs and, with the CDRs from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen-binding site of antibodies. There are at least two techniques for determining CDRs: (1) an approach based on cross-species sequence variability (i.e., Kabat et al. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, (5th ed., 1991, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda Md.)); and (2) an approach based on crystallographic studies of antigen-antibody complexes (Chothia et al. (1989) Nature 342:877). As used herein, a CDR may refer to CDRs defined by either approach or by a combination of both approaches.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “human antibody” means an antibody having an amino acid sequence corresponding to that of an antibody produced by a human and/or has been made using any of the techniques for making human antibodies known in the art or disclosed herein. This definition of a human antibody includes antibodies comprising at least one human heavy chain polypeptide or at least one human light chain polypeptide. One such example is an antibody comprising murine light chain and human heavy chain polypeptides. Human antibodies can be produced using various techniques known in the art. In one embodiment, the human antibody is selected from a phage library, where that phage library expresses human antibodies (Vaughan et al., 1996, Nature Biotechnology, 14:309-314; Sheets et al., 1998, PNAS, (USA) 95:6157-6162; Hoogenboom and Winter, 1991, J. Mol. Biol., 227:381; Marks et al., 1991, J. Mol. Biol., 222:581). Human antibodies can also be made by introducing human immunoglobulin loci into transgenic animals, e.g., mice in which the endogenous immunoglobulin genes have been partially or completely inactivated. This approach is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,545,807; 5,545,806; 5,569,825; 5,625,126; 5,633,425; and 5,661,016. Alternatively, the human antibody may be prepared by immortalizing human B lymphocytes that produce an antibody directed against a target antigen (such B lymphocytes may be recovered from an individual or may have been immunized in vitro). See, e.g., Cole et al., Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, Alan R. Liss, p. 77 (1985); Boerner et al., 1991, J. Immunol., 147 (1):86-95; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,750,373.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Chimeric antibodies” refers to those antibodies wherein one portion of each of the amino acid sequences of heavy and light chains is homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular class, while the remaining segment of the chains is homologous to corresponding sequences in another. Typically, in these chimeric antibodies, the variable region of both light and heavy chains mimics the variable regions of antibodies derived from one species of mammals, while the constant portions are homologous to the sequences in antibodies derived from another. One clear advantage to such chimeric forms: is that, for example, the variable regions can conveniently be derived from presently known sources using readily available hybridomas or B cells from non human host organisms in combination with constant regions derived from, for example, human cell preparations. While the variable region has the advantage of ease of preparation, and the specificity is not affected by its source, the constant region being human, is less likely to elicit an immune response from a human subject when the antibodies are injected than would the constant region from a non-human source. However, the definition is not limited to this particular example.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “functional Fc region” possesses at least one effector function of a native sequence Fc region. Exemplary “effector functions” include C1q binding; complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC); Fc receptor binding; antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC); phagocytosis; down-regulation of cell surface receptors (e.g. B cell receptor; BCR), etc. Such effector functions generally require the Fc region to be combined with a binding domain (e.g. an antibody variable domain) and can be assessed using various assays known in the art for evaluating such antibody effector functions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “native sequence Fc region” comprises an amino acid sequence identical to the amino acid sequence of an Fc region found in nature. A “variant Fc region” comprises an amino acid sequence which differs from that of a native sequence Fc region by virtue of at least one amino acid modification, yet retains at least one effector function of the native sequence Fc region. Preferably, the variant Fc region has at least one amino acid substitution compared to a native sequence Fc region or to the Fc region of a parent polypeptide, e.g. from about one to about ten amino acid substitutions, and preferably from about one to about five amino acid substitutions in a native sequence Fc region or in the Fc region of the parent polypeptide. The variant Fc region herein will preferably possess at least about 80% sequence identity with a native sequence Fc region and/or with an Fc region of a parent polypeptide, and most preferably at least about 90% sequence identity therewith, more preferably at least about 95% sequence identity therewith.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein “antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity” and “ADCC” refer to a cell-mediated reaction in which nonspecific cytotoxic cells that express Fc receptors (FcRs) (e.g. natural killer (NK) cells, neutrophils, and macrophages) recognize bound antibody on a target cell and subsequently cause lysis of the target cell. ADCC activity of a molecule of interest can be assessed using an in vitro ADCC assay, such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,500,362 or 5,821,337. Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and NK cells. Alternatively, or additionally, ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo, e.g., in a animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al., 1998, PNAS (USA), 95:652-656.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “human effector cells” means leukocytes that express one or more FcRs and perform effector functions. Preferably, the cells express at least FcγRIII and perform ADCC effector function. Examples of human leukocytes that mediate ADCC include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes, cytotoxic T cells and neutrophils; with PBMCs and NK cells being preferred. The effector cells may be isolated from a native source, e.g. from blood or PBMCs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “Fc receptor” and “FcR” describe a receptor that binds to the Fc region of an antibody. The preferred FcR is a native sequence human FcR. Moreover, a preferred FcR is one which binds an IgG antibody (a gamma receptor) and includes receptors of the FcγRI, FcγRII, and FcγRIII subclasses, including allelic variants and alternatively spliced forms of these receptors. FcγRII receptors include FcγRIIA (an “activating receptor”) and FcγRIIB (an “inhibiting receptor”), which have similar amino acid sequences that differ primarily in the cytoplasmic domains thereof. FcRs are reviewed in Ravetch and Kinet, 1991, Ann. Rev. Immunol., 9:457-92; Capel et al., 1994, Immunomethods, 4:25-34; and de Haas et al., 1995, J. Lab. Clin. Med., 126:330-41. “FcR” also includes the neonatal receptor, FcRn, which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus (Guyer et al., 1976, J. Immunol., 117:587; and Kim et al., 1994, J. Immunol., 24:249).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Complement dependent cytotoxicity” and “CDC” refer to the lysing of a target in the presence of complement. The complement activation pathway is initiated by the binding of the first component of the complement system (C1q) to a molecule (e.g. an antibody) complexed with a cognate antigen. To assess complement activation, a CDC assay, e.g. as described in Gazzano-Santoro et al., J. Immunol. Methods, 202:163 (1996), may be performed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “affinity matured” antibody means an antibody with one or more alterations in one or more CDRs thereof that result an improvement in the affinity of the antibody for antigen compared to a parent antibody that does not possess the alteration(s). Preferred affinity matured antibodies will have nanomolar or even picomolar affinities for the target antigen. Affinity matured antibodies are produced by procedures known in the art (Marks et al., 1992, Bio/Technology, 10:779-783; Barbas et al., 1994, Proc Nat. Acad. Sci, USA 91:3809-3813; Schier et al., 1995, Gene, 169:147-155; Yelton et al., 1995, J. Immunol., 155:1994-2004; Jackson et al., 1995, J. Immunol., 154(7):3310-9; Hawkins et al, 1992, J. Mol. Biol., 226:889-896).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “immunospecific” binding of antibodies refers to the antigen specific binding interaction that occurs between the antigen-combining site of an antibody and the specific antigen recognized by that antibody (i.e., the antibody reacts with the protein in an ELISA or other immunoassay, and does not react detectably with unrelated proteins).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn epitope that “specifically binds”, or “preferentially binds” (used interchangeably herein) to an antibody or a polypeptide is a term well understood in the art, and methods to determine such specific or preferential binding are also well known in the art. A molecule is said to exhibit “specific binding” or “preferential binding” if it reacts or associates more frequently, more rapidly, with greater duration and/or with greater affinity with a particular cell or substance than it does with alternative cells or substances. An antibody “specifically binds” or “preferentially binds” to a target if it binds with greater affinity, avidity, more readily, and/or with greater duration than it binds to other substances. For example, an antibody that specifically or preferentially binds to a Aβ\n1-40 \nepitope is an antibody that binds this epitope with greater affinity, avidity, more readily, and/or with greater duration than it binds to other Aβ\n1-40 \nepitopes or non-Aβ\n1-40 \nepitopes. It is also understood by reading this definition that, for example, an antibody (or moiety or epitope) that specifically or preferentially binds to a first target may or may not specifically or preferentially bind to a second target. As such, “specific binding” or “preferential binding” does not necessarily require (although it can include) exclusive binding. Generally, but not necessarily, reference to binding means preferential binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “polypeptide” includes proteins, fragments of proteins, and peptides, whether isolated from natural sources, produced by recombinant techniques or chemically synthesized. Polypeptides of the invention typically comprise at least about 6 amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “vector” means a construct, which is capable of delivering, and preferably expressing, one or more gene(s) or sequence(s) of interest in a host cell. Examples of vectors include, but are not limited to, viral vectors, naked DNA or RNA expression vectors, plasmid, cosmid or phage vectors, DNA or RNA expression vectors associated with cationic condensing agents, DNA or RNA expression vectors encapsulated in liposomes, and certain eukaryotic cells, such as producer cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “expression control sequence” means a nucleic acid sequence that directs transcription of a nucleic acid. An expression control sequence can be a promoter, such as a constitutive or an inducible promoter, or an enhancer. The expression control sequence is operably linked to the nucleic acid sequence to be transcribed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “nucleic acid” or “polynucleotide” refers to a deoxyribonucleotide or ribonucleotide polymer in either single- or double-stranded form, and unless otherwise limited, encompasses known analogs of natural nucleotides that hybridize to nucleic acids in a manner similar to naturally-occurring nucleotides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” includes any material which, when combined with an active ingredient, allows the ingredient to retain biological activity and is non-reactive with the subject's immune system. Examples include, but are not limited to, any of the standard pharmaceutical carriers such as a phosphate buffered saline solution, water, emulsions such as oil/water emulsion, and various types of wetting agents. Preferred diluents for aerosol or parenteral administration are phosphate buffered saline or normal (0.9%) saline.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions comprising such carriers are formulated by well known conventional methods (see, for example, \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, \n18th edition, A. Gennaro, ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1990; and \nRemington, The Science and Practice of Pharmacy \n20th Ed. Mack Publishing, 2000).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “adjuvant” includes those adjuvants commonly used in the art to facilitate an immune response. Examples of adjuvants include, but are not limited to, helper peptide; aluminum salts such as aluminum hydroxide gel (alum) or aluminum phosphate; Freund's Incomplete Adjuvant and Complete Adjuvant (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Mich.); Merck Adjuvant 65 (Merck and Company, Inc., Rahway, N.J.); AS-2 (Smith-Kline Beecham); QS-21 (Aquilla Biopharmaceuticals); MPL or 3d-MPL (Corixa Corporation, Hamilton, Mont.); LEIF; salts of calcium, iron or zinc; an insoluble suspension of acylated tyrosine; acylated sugars; cationically or anionically derivatized polysaccharides; polyphosphazenes; biodegradable microspheres; monophosphoryl lipid A and quil A; muramyl tripeptide phosphatidyl ethanolamine or an immunostimulating complex, including cytokines (e.g., GM-CSF or interleukin-2, -7 or -12) and immunostimulatory DNA sequences. In some embodiments, such as with the use of a polynucleotide vaccine, an adjuvant such as a helper peptide or cytokine can be provided via a polynucleotide encoding the adjuvant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, an “effective dosage” or “effective amount” drug, compound, or pharmaceutical composition is an amount sufficient to effect beneficial or desired results. For prophylactic use, beneficial or desired results includes results such as eliminating or reducing the risk, lessening the severity, or delaying the outset of the disease, including biochemical, histologic and/or behavioral symptoms of the disease, its complications and intermediate pathological phenotypes presenting during development of the disease. For therapeutic use, beneficial or desired results includes clinical results such as inhibiting or suppressing the formation of amyloid plaques, reducing, removing, or clearing amyloid plaques, improving cognition or reversing cognitive decline, sequestering soluble Aβ peptide circulating in biological fluids, decreasing one or more symptoms resulting from the disease (biochemical, histologic and/or behavioral), including its complications and intermediate pathological phenotypes presenting during development of the disease, increasing the quality of life of those suffering from the disease, decreasing the dose of other medications required to treat the disease, enhancing effect of another medication, delaying the progression of the disease, and/or prolonging survival of patients. An effective dosage can be administered in one or more administrations. For purposes of this invention, an effective dosage of drug, compound, or pharmaceutical composition is an amount sufficient to accomplish prophylactic or therapeutic treatment either directly or indirectly. As is understood in the clinical context, an effective dosage of a drug, compound, or pharmaceutical composition may or may not be achieved in conjunction with another drug, compound, or pharmaceutical composition. Thus, an “effective dosage” may be considered in the context of administering one or more therapeutic agents, and a single agent may be considered to be given in an effective amount if, in conjunction with one or more other agents, a desirable result may be or is achieved.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “treatment” or “treating” is an approach for obtaining beneficial or desired results including clinical results. For purposes of this invention, beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: inhibiting or suppressing the formation of amyloid plaques, reducing, removing, or clearing amyloid plaques, improving cognition or reversing cognitive decline, sequestering soluble Aβ peptide circulating in biological fluids, reducing Aβ peptide (including soluble and deposited) in a tissue (such as brain), inhibiting and/or reducing accumulation of Aβ peptide in the brain, inhibiting and/or reducing toxic effects of Aβ peptide in a tissue (such as brain), decreasing symptoms resulting from the disease, increasing the quality of life of those suffering from the disease, decreasing the dose of other medications required to treat the disease, delaying the progression of the disease, and/or prolonging survival of patients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “delaying” development of Alzheimer's disease means to defer, hinder, slow, retard, stabilize, and/or postpone development of the disease. This delay can be of varying lengths of time, depending on the history of the disease and/or individual being treated. As is evident to one skilled in the art, a sufficient or significant delay can, in effect, encompass prevention, in that the individual does not develop the disease. A method that “delays” development of Alzheimer's disease is a method that reduces probability of disease development in a given time frame and/or reduces extent of the disease in a given time frame, when compared to not using the method. Such comparisons are typically based on clinical studies, using a statistically significant number of subjects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Development” of Alzheimer's disease means the onset and/or progression of Alzheimer's disease within an individual. Alzheimer's disease development can be detectable using standard clinical techniques as described herein. However, development also refers to disease progression that may be initially undetectable. For purposes of this invention, progression refers to the biological course of the disease state, in this case, as determined by a standard neurological examination, or patient interview or may be determined by more specialized testing. A variety of these diagnostic tests include, but not limited to, neuroimaging, detecting alterations of levels of specific proteins in the serum or cerebrospinal fluid (e.g., amyloid peptides and Tau), computerized tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). “Development” includes occurrence, recurrence, and onset. As used herein “onset” or “occurrence” of Alzheimer's disease includes initial onset and/or recurrence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, a “at risk” individual is an individual who is at risk of development of Alzheimer's disease. An individual “at risk” may or may not have detectable disease, and may or may not have displayed detectable disease prior to the treatment methods described herein. “At risk” denotes that an individual has one or more so-called risk factors, which are measurable parameters that correlate with development of Alzheimer's disease. An individual having one or more of these risk factors has a higher probability of developing Alzheimer's disease than an individual without these risk factor(s). These risk factors include, but are not limited to, age, sex, race, diet, history of previous disease, presence of precursor disease, genetic (i.e., hereditary) considerations, and environmental exposure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “a” or “an” means at least one, unless clearly indicated otherwise.\n\n\n \nAntibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention provides isolated monoclonal antibodies (including human, humanized or chimeric antibodies of the invention) that bind to Aβ peptide (SEQ ID NO:1). More specifically, antibodies are provided that bind to amino acids 1-16, 16-28 or 28-40 of Aβ peptide. In some embodiment, the antibodies preferentially binds to an epitope that includes amino acid 39 and/or 40 of the Aβ peptide (SEQ ID NO:1). An antibody that binds to Aβ peptide containing amino acids 1-40 of SEQ ID NO:1, but does not bind (as is understood by one skilled in the art, does not significantly bind) to Aβ peptide containing amino acids 1-38 of SEQ ID NO:1, is an antibody that preferentially binds to an epitope that includes amino acid 39 and/or 40 of the Aβ peptide (SEQ ID NO:1). In some embodiments, the antibody binds to an epitope that includes amino acids 36-40 of Aβ peptide (SEQ ID NO:1). In some embodiments, the antibody binds to amino acids 28-40 of Aβ peptide (SEQ ID NO:1) with an affinity of about 200 nM or less, about 60 nM or less, about 30 nM or less, about 3 nM or less, or about 1 nM or less. In some embodiments, the antibody preferentially binds to an epitope that includes amino acid 39 and/or 40 of the Aβ peptide (SEQ ID NO:1) with an affinity of about 60 nM or less, about 30 nM or less, or about 3 nM or less. In some embodiments, the antibody preferentially binds to an epitope that includes amino acid 39 and/or 40 of the Aβ peptide (SEQ ID NO:1) with an affinity of about 3 nM or less. Preferably, the antibodies competitively inhibit binding of a monoclonal antibody having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 4, 6, 8, and/or 10, or the binding of the monoclonal antibody produced by the hybridoma designated 8A1.2A1, 3C6.1F9 or 10B10.2E6. In some embodiments, the monoclonal antibody binds the Aβ peptide with an affinity of about 60 nM or less, preferably about 30 nM or less, and more preferably, about 3 nM or less. In preferred embodiments, the antibody binds the same Aβ epitope to which a monoclonal antibody having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 4, 6, 8, and/or 10, or the monoclonal antibody produced by the hybridoma designated 8A1.2A1, 3C6.1F9, or 10B 10.2E6 binds. The monoclonal antibody can optionally be conjugated to a therapeutic agent and/or labeled with a detectable marker.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments and as described herein (and is known in the art), affinity is measured using the corresponding Fab fragment of the antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, the invention provides an isolated monoclonal antibody that binds to βAPP (SEQ ID NO:2) and that competitively inhibits binding of the monoclonal antibody produced by the hybridoma designated 25E12.1F9.1H8 (BP26), 24H4.2E10.1F5 (BP27), 1F10.8E6.2A2 (BP80), 13E12.105 (BP81), or 14D9.1G8 (BP82).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides a humanized antibody derived from a monoclonal antibody having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 4 and/or 6, or the monoclonal antibody produced by the hybridoma designated 8A1.2A1. A humanized form of the antibody may or may not have CDRs identical to the monoclonal antibody derived from. Determination of CDR regions is well within the skill of the art. In some embodiments, the invention provides an antibody which comprises at least one CDR that is substantially homologous to at least one CDR, at least two, at least three, at least four, at least 5 CDRs of the monoclonal antibody (or, in some embodiments substantially homologous to all 6 CDRs of the monoclonal antibody, or derived from the monoclonal antibody) derived from. Other embodiments include antibodies which have at least two, three, four, five, or six CDR(s) that are substantially homologous to at least two, three, four, five or six CDRs of the monoclonal antibody or derived from the monoclonal antibody. It is understood that, for purposes of this invention, binding specificity and/or overall activity (which may be in terms of clearing Aβ deposit) is generally retained, although the extent of activity may vary compared to the monoclonal antibody produced by the hybridoma designated 8A1.2A1. The invention also provides methods of making any of these antibodies. Methods of making antibodies are known in the art and are described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompetition assays can be used to determine whether two antibodies bind the same epitope by recognizing identical or sterically overlapping epitopes. Typically, antigen is immobilized on a multi-well plate and the ability of unlabeled antibodies to block the binding of labeled antibodies is measured. Common labels for such competition assays are radioactive labels or enzyme labels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne way of determining binding affinity of antibodies to Aβ peptide is by measuring affinity of monofunctional Fab fragments of the antibodies. To obtain monofunction Fab fragments, antibodies, for example, IgGs can be cleaved with papain or expressed recombinantly. Affinities of anti-Aβ Fab fragments of monoclonal antibodies can be determined by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) system (BIAcore 3000™, BIAcore, Inc., Piscaway, N.J.). SA chips (streptavidin) are used according to the supplier's instructions. Biotinylated Aβ peptide 1-40 (SEQ ID NO:1) can be diluted into HBS-EP (100 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% P20) and injected over the chip at a concentration of 0.005 mg/mL. Using variable flow time across the individual chip channels, two ranges of antigen density are achieved: 10-20 response units (RU) for detailed kinetic studies and 500-600 RU for concentration. Regeneration studies showed that a mixture of Pierce elution buffer and 4 M NaCl (2:1) effectively removed the bound Fab while keeping the activity of Aβ peptide on the chip for over 200 injections. FIBS-EP buffer can be used as running buffer for all the BIAcore assays. Serial dilutions (0.1-10× estimated KD) of purified Fab samples are injected for 2 min at 100 μL/min and dissociation times of up to 30 h min are allowed. The concentrations of the Fab proteins can be determined by ELISA and/or SDS-PAGE electrophoresis using a standard Fab of known concentration (determined by amino acid analysis). Kinetic association rates (kon) and dissociation rates (koff) are obtained simultaneously by fitting the data to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model (Lofas & Johnson, 1990) using the BIAevaluation program. Equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) values are calculated as koff/kon.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention provides antibodies in monomeric, dimeric and multivalent forms. For example, bispecific antibodies, monoclonal antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different antigens, can be prepared using the antibodies disclosed herein. Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art (see, e.g., Suresh et al., 1986, Methods in Enzymology 121:210). Traditionally, the recombinant production of bispecific antibodies was based on the coexpression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pairs, with the two heavy chains having different specificities (Millstein and Cuello, 1983, Nature 305, 537-539).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to one approach to making bispecific antibodies, antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities (antibody-antigen combining sites) are fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. The fusion preferably is with an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant domain, comprising at least part of the hinge, CH2 and CH3 regions. It is preferred to have the first heavy chain constant region (CH1), containing the site necessary for light chain binding, present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and, if desired, the immunoglobulin light chain, are inserted into separate expression vectors, and are cotransfected into a suitable host organism. This provides for great flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction provide the optimum yields. It is, however, possible to insert the coding sequences for two or all three polypeptide chains in one expression vector when the expression of at least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios are of no particular significance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one approach, the bispecific antibodies are composed of a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm, and a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pair (providing a second binding specificity) in the other arm. This asymmetric structure, with an immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of the bispecific molecule, facilitates the separation of the desired bispecific compound from unwanted immunoglobulin chain combinations. This approach is described in PCT Publication No. WO 94/04690, published Mar. 3, 1994.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHeteroconjugate antibodies, comprising two covalently joined antibodies, are also within the scope of the invention. Such antibodies have been used to target immune system cells to unwanted cells (U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980), and for treatment of HIV infection (PCT application publication Nos. WO 91/00360 and WO 92/200373; EP 03089). Heteroconjugate antibodies may be made using any convenient cross-linking methods. Suitable cross-linking agents and techniques are well known in the art, and are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the immunoreactive molecule is an antibody fragment. Various techniques have been developed for the production of antibody fragments. These fragments can be derived via proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies (see, e.g., Morimoto et al., 1992, J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods 24:107-117 and Brennan et al., 1985, Science 229:81), or produced directly by recombinant host cells. For example, Fab′-SH fragments can be directly recovered from \nE. coli \nand chemically coupled to form F(ab′)\n2 \nfragments (Carter et al., 1992, Bio/Technology 10:163-167). In another embodiment, the F(ab′)\n2 \nis formed using the leucine zipper GCN4 to promote assembly of the F(ab′)\n2 \nmolecule. According to another approach, Fv, Fab or F(ab′)\n2 \nfragments are isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe monoclonal antibody of the invention can be provided in the form of a pharmaceutical composition, optionally together with a carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibody also may be entrapped in microcapsules prepared, for example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization (for example, hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsules and poly(methylmethacylate) microcapsules, respectively), in colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules), or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, \n18th edition, A. Gennaro, ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1990; and \nRemington, The Science and Practice of Pharmacy \n20th Ed. Mack Publishing, 2000. To increase the serum half life of the antibody, one may incorporate a salvage receptor binding epitope into the antibody (especially an antibody fragment) as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,739,277, for example. As used herein, the term “salvage receptor binding epitope” refers to an epitope of the Fc region of an IgG molecule (e.g., IgG\n1\n, IgG\n2\n, IgG\n3\n, or IgG\n4\n) that is responsible for increasing the in vivo serum half-life of the IgG molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies disclosed herein may also be formulated as immunoliposomes. Liposomes containing the antibody are prepared by methods known in the art, such as described in Epstein et al., 1985, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:3688; Hwang et al., 1980, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77:4030; and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,485,045 and 4,544,545. Liposomes with enhanced circulation time are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,013,556. Particularly useful liposomes can be generated by the reverse phase evaporation method with a lipid composition comprising phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol and PEG-derivatized phosphatidylethanolamine (PEG-PE). Liposomes are extruded through filters of defined pore size to yield liposomes with the desired diameter. In addition, Fab′ fragments of the antibody of the present invention can be conjugated to the liposomes as described in Martin et al., 1982, J. Biol. Chem. 257:286-288, via a disulfide interchange reaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the antibodies of the invention are single chain (ScFv), mutants thereof, fusion proteins comprising an antibody portion, humanized antibodies, chimeric antibodies, diabodies linear antibodies, single chain antibodies, and any other modified configuration of the immunoglobulin molecule.\n\n\n \nProduction of Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nMonoclonal antibodies may be prepared using hybridoma methods, such as those described by Kohler and Milstein, 1975, Nature 256:495. In a hybridoma method, a mouse, hamster, or other appropriate host animal, is typically immunized with an immunizing agent to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the immunizing agent. Alternatively, the lymphocytes may be immunized in vitro.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe monoclonal antibodies may also be made by recombinant DNA methods, such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567. DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies is isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures, such as by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the monoclonal antibodies. Once isolated, the DNA may be placed into expression vectors, which are then transfected into host cells such as \nE. coli \ncells, simian COS cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein, to obtain the synthesis of monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe DNA can be modified, for example, by covalently joining to the immunoglobulin coding sequence all or part of the coding sequence for a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide. In that manner, “chimeric” or “hybrid” antibodies are prepared that have the binding specificity of a monoclonal antibody disclosed herein. Typically such non-immunoglobulin polypeptides are substituted for the constant domains of an antibody of the invention, or they are substituted for the variable domains of one antigen-combining site of an antibody of the invention to create a chimeric bivalent antibody comprising one antigen-combining site having specificity for one surface epitope of Aβ (or βAPP) and another antigen-combining site having specificity for a different antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also encompasses humanized antibodies. Therapeutic antibodies often elicit adverse effects, in part due to triggering of an immune response directed against the administered antibody. This can result in reduced drug efficacy, depletion of cells bearing the target antigen, and an undesirable inflammatory response. To circumvent the above, recombinant anti-Aβ humanized antibodies are generated. The polynucleotide sequence of an antibody, such as SEQ ID NO:3 and/or 5 may be used for genetic manipulation to generate a “humanized” antibody, or to improve the affinity, or other characteristics of the antibody. The general principle in humanizing an antibody involves retaining the basic sequence of the antigen-binding portion of the antibody, while swapping the non-human remainder of the antibody with human antibody sequences. There are four general steps to humanize a monoclonal antibody. These are: (1) determining the nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence of the starting antibody light and heavy variable domains (2) designing the humanized antibody, i.e., deciding which antibody framework region to use during the humanizing process (3) the actual humanizing methodologies/techniques and (4) the transfection and expression of the humanized antibody. For example, the constant region may be engineered to more resemble human constant regions to avoid immune response if the antibody is used in clinical trials and treatments in humans. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,997,867 and 5,866,692.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the recombinant humanized antibodies, the Fcγ portion can be modified to avoid interaction with Fcγ receptor and the complement immune system. This type of modification was designed by Dr. Mike Clark from the Department of Pathology at Cambridge University, and techniques for preparation of such antibodies are described in WO 99/58572, published Nov. 18, 1999.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA number of “humanized” antibody molecules comprising an antigen-binding site derived from a non-human immunoglobulin have been described, including chimeric antibodies having rodent V regions and their associated complementarity determining regions (CDRs) fused to human constant domains. See, for example, Winter et al. \nNature \n349:293-299 (1991); Lobuglio et al. \nProc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA \n86:4220-4224 (1989); Shaw et al. \nJ Immunol. \n138:4534-4538 (1987); and Brown et al. \nCancer Res. \n47:3577-3583 (1987). Other references describe rodent CDRs grafted into a human supporting framework region (FR) prior to fusion with an appropriate human antibody constant domain. See, for example, Riechmann et al. \nNature \n332:323-327 (1988); Verhoeyen et al. \nScience \n239:1534-1536 (1988); and Jones et al. \nNature \n321:522-525 (1986). Another reference describes rodent CDRs supported by recombinantly veneered rodent framework regions. See, for example, European Patent Publication No. 519,596. These “humanized” molecules are designed to minimize unwanted immunological response toward rodent antihuman antibody molecules which limits the duration and effectiveness of therapeutic applications of those moieties in human recipients. Other methods of humanizing antibodies that may also be utilized are disclosed by Daugherty et al., \nNucl. Acids Res., \n19:2471-2476 (1991) and in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,180,377; 6,054,297; 5,997,867; 5,866,692; 6,210,671; 6,350,861; and PCT WO 01/27160.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another alternative, fully human antibodies may be obtained by using commercially available mice which have been engineered to express specific human immunoglobulin proteins. Transgenic animals which are designed to produce a more desirable (e.g., fully human antibodies) or more robust immune response may also be used for generation of humanized or human antibodies. Examples of such technology are Xenomouse™ from Abgenix, Inc. (Fremont, Calif.) and HuMAb-Mouse® and TC Mouse™ from Medarex, Inc. (Princeton, N.J.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another alternative, antibodies may be made recombinantly by phage display technology. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,565,332; 5,580,717; 5,733,743 and 6,265,150; and Winter et al., \nAnnu. Rev. Immunol. \n12:433-455 (1994). Alternatively, the phage display technology (McCafferty et al., \nNature \n348:552-553 (1990)) can be used to produce human antibodies and antibody fragments in vitro, from immunoglobulin variable (V) domain gene repertoires from unimmunized donors. According to this technique, antibody V domain genes are cloned in-frame into either a major or minor coat protein gene of a filamentous bacteriophage, such as M13 or fd, and displayed as functional antibody fragments on the surface of the phage particle. Because the filamentous particle contains a single-stranded DNA copy of the phage genome, selections based on the functional properties of the antibody also result in selection of the gene encoding the antibody exhibiting those properties. Thus, the phage mimics some of the properties of the B cell. Phage display can be performed in a variety of formats; for review see, e.g., Johnson, Kevin S, and Chiswell, David J., \nCurrent Opinion in \nStructural Biology\n \n3, 564-571 (1993). Several sources of V-gene segments can be used for phage display. Clackson et al., \nNature \n352:624-628 (1991) isolated a diverse array of anti-oxazolone antibodies from a small random combinatorial library of V genes derived from the spleens of immunized mice. A repertoire of V genes from unimmunized human donors can be constructed and antibodies to a diverse array of antigens (including self-antigens) can be isolated essentially following the techniques described by Mark et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n222:581-597 (1991), or Griffith et al., \nEMBO J. \n12:725-734 (1993). In a natural immune response, antibody genes accumulate mutations at a high rate (somatic hypermutation). Some of the changes introduced will confer higher affinity, and B cells displaying high-affinity surface immunoglobulin are preferentially replicated and differentiated during subsequent antigen challenge. This natural process can be mimicked by employing the technique known as “chain shuffling.” Marks, et al., \nBio/Technol. \n10:779-783 (1992)). In this method, the affinity of “primary” human antibodies obtained by phage display can be improved by sequentially replacing the heavy and light chain V region genes with repertoires of naturally occurring variants (repertoires) of V domain genes obtained from unimmunized donors. This technique allows the production of antibodies and antibody fragments with affinities in the pM-nM range. A strategy for making very large phage antibody repertoires (also known as “the mother-of-all libraries”) has been described by Waterhouse et al., \nNucl. Acids Res. \n21:2265-2266 (1993). Gene shuffling can also be used to derive human antibodies from rodent antibodies, where the human antibody has similar affinities and specificities to the starting rodent antibody. According to this method, which is also referred to as “epitope imprinting”, the heavy or light chain V domain gene of rodent antibodies obtained by phage display technique is replaced with a repertoire of human V domain genes, creating rodent-human chimeras. Selection on antigen results in isolation of human variable regions capable of restoring a functional antigen-binding site, i.e., the epitope governs (imprints) the choice of partner. When the process is repeated in order to replace the remaining rodent V domain, a human antibody is obtained (see PCT patent application PCT WO 9306213, published Apr. 1, 1993). Unlike traditional humanization of rodent antibodies by CDR grafting, this technique provides completely human antibodies, which have no framework or CDR residues of rodent origin. It is apparent that although the above discussion pertains to humanized antibodies, the general principles discussed are applicable to customizing antibodies for use, for example, in dogs, cats, primates, equines and bovines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChimeric or hybrid antibodies also may be prepared in vitro using known methods of synthetic protein chemistry, including those involving cross-linking agents. For example, immunotoxins may be constructed using a disulfide exchange reaction or by forming a thioether bond. Examples of suitable reagents for this purpose include iminothiolate and methyl-4-mercaptobutyrimidate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSingle chain Fv fragments may also be produced, such as described in Iliades et al., 1997, FEBS Letters, 409:437-441. Coupling of such single chain fragments using various linkers is described in Kortt et al., 1997, Protein Engineering, 10:423-433. A variety of techniques for the recombinant production and manipulation of antibodies are well known in the art.\n\n\n \nVariant and Modified Immunoreactive Polypeptides and Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention also provides polypeptides comprising an amino acid sequence of the antibodies of the invention, such as a monoclonal antibody having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 4 and/or 6, or the monoclonal antibody produced by the hybridoma designated 8A1.2A1. Immunoreactive polypeptides described herein are useful for and can be used in any of the compositions, kits, and methods described herein. The polypeptides have one or more of the binding properties described herein, and in some embodiments, display any one or more additional functional properties described herein. In some embodiments, the polypeptide comprises one or more of the light chain and/or heavy chain variable regions of the monoclonal antibody. In some embodiments, the polypeptide comprises one or more (one, two, three, four, five, or six) of the light chain and/or heavy chain CDRs of the monoclonal antibody. In some embodiments, the polypeptide comprises three CDRs of the light chain and/or heavy chain of the monoclonal antibody. In some embodiments, the polypeptide comprises an amino acid sequence of the monoclonal antibody that has any of the following: at least 5 contiguous amino acids of a sequence of the monoclonal antibody, at least 8 contiguous amino acids, at least about 10 contiguous amino acids, at least about 15 contiguous amino acids, at least about 20 contiguous amino acids, at least about 25 contiguous amino acids, at least about 30 contiguous amino acids, wherein at least 3 of the amino acids are from a variable region of the monoclonal antibody. In one embodiment, the variable region is from a light chain of the monoclonal antibody. In another embodiment, the variable region is from a heavy chain of the monoclonal antibody. In another embodiment, the 5 (or more) contiguous amino acids are from a complementarity determining region (CDR) of the monoclonal antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA polypeptide “variant,” as used herein, is a polypeptide that differs from a native protein in one or more substitutions, deletions, additions and/or insertions, such that the immunoreactivity of the polypeptide is not substantially diminished. In other words, the ability of a variant to specifically bind antigen may be enhanced or unchanged, relative to the native protein, or may be diminished by less than 50%, and preferably less than 20%, relative to the native protein. Polypeptide variants preferably exhibit at least about 80%, more preferably at least about 90% and most preferably at least about 95% identity (determined as described herein) to the identified polypeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmino acid sequence variants of the antibodies are prepared by introducing appropriate nucleotide changes into the antibody DNA, or by peptide synthesis. Such variants include, for example, deletions from, and/or insertions into and/or substitutions of, residues within the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NO: 4, 6 or 8 described herein. Any combination of deletion, insertion, and substitution is made to arrive at the final construct, provided that the final construct possesses the desired characteristics. The amino acid changes also may alter post-translational processes of the antibody, such as changing the number or position of glycosylation sites.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA useful method for identification of certain residues or regions of the antibody that are preferred locations for mutagenesis is called “alanine scanning mutagenesis,” and is described by Cunningham and Wells, 1989, Science, 244:1081-1085. A residue or group of target residues is identified (e.g., charged residues such as arg, asp, his, lys, and glu) and replaced by a neutral or negatively charged amino acid (most preferably alanine or polyalanine) to affect the interaction of the amino acids with antigen. Those amino acid locations demonstrating functional sensitivity to the substitutions then are refined by introducing further or other variants at, or for, the sites of substitution. Thus, while the site for introducing an amino acid sequence variation is predetermined, the nature of the mutation per se need not be predetermined. For example, to analyze the performance of a mutation at a given site, ala scanning or random mutagenesis is conducted at the target codon or region and the expressed antibody variants are screened for the desired activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmino acid sequence insertions include amino- and/or carboxyl-terminal fusions ranging in length from one residue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more residues, as well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Examples of terminal insertions include an antibody with an N-terminal methionyl residue or the antibody fused to an epitope tag. Other insertional variants of the antibody molecule include the fusion to the N- or C-terminus of the antibody of an enzyme or a polypeptide which increases the serum half-life of the antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubstitution variants have at least one amino acid residue in the antibody molecule removed and a different residue inserted in its place. The sites of greatest interest for substitutional mutagenesis include the hypervariable regions, but FR alterations are also contemplated. Conservative substitutions are shown in Table 1 under the heading of “preferred substitutions”. If such substitutions result in a change in biological activity, then more substantial changes, denominated “exemplary substitutions” in Table 1, or as further described below in reference to amino acid classes, may be introduced and the products screened.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nConservative Substitutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOriginal\n\n\nPreferred\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nResidue\n\n\nSubstitutions\n\n\nExemplary Substitutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAla (A)\n\n\nVal\n\n\nVal; Leu; Ile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nArg (R)\n\n\nLys\n\n\nLys; Gln; Asn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAsn (N)\n\n\nGln\n\n\nGln; His; Asp, Lys; Arg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAsp (D)\n\n\nGlu\n\n\nGlu; Asn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCys (C)\n\n\nSer\n\n\nSer; Ala\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGln (Q)\n\n\nAsn\n\n\nAsn; Glu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGlu (E)\n\n\nAsp\n\n\nAsp; Gln\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGly (G)\n\n\nAla\n\n\nAla\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHis (H)\n\n\nArg\n\n\nAsn; Gln; Lys; Arg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIle (I)\n\n\nLeu\n\n\nLeu; Val; Met; Ala; Phe;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNorleucine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLeu (L)\n\n\nIle\n\n\nNorleucine; Ile; Val; Met;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAla; Phe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLys (K)\n\n\nArg\n\n\nArg; Gln; Asn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMet (M)\n\n\nLeu\n\n\nLeu; Phe; Ile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPhe (F)\n\n\nTyr\n\n\nLeu; Val; Ile; Ala; Tyr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPro (P)\n\n\nAla\n\n\nAla\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSer (S)\n\n\nThr\n\n\nThr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThr (T)\n\n\nSer\n\n\nSer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTrp (W)\n\n\nTyr\n\n\nTyr; Phe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTyr (Y)\n\n\nPhe\n\n\nTrp; Phe; Thr; Ser\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nVal (V)\n\n\nLeu\n\n\nIle; Leu; Met; Phe; Ala;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNorleucine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubstantial modifications in the biological properties of the antibody are accomplished by selecting substitutions that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining (a) the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitution, for example, as a sheet or helical conformation, (b) the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site, or (c) the bulk of the side chain. Naturally occurring residues are divided into groups based on common side-chain properties:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(1) Hydrophobic: Norleucine, Met, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(2) Neutral hydrophilic: Cys, Ser, Thr;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(3) Acidic: Asp, Glu;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(4) Basic: Asn, Gln, His, Lys, Arg;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(5) Residues that influence chain orientation: Gly, Pro; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(6) Aromatic: Trp, Tyr, Phe.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-conservative substitutions are made by exchanging a member of one of these classes for another class.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny cysteine residue not involved in maintaining the proper conformation of the antibody also may be substituted, generally with serine, to improve the oxidative stability of the molecule and prevent aberrant cross-linking. Conversely, cysteine bond(s) may be added to the antibody to improve its stability, particularly where the antibody is an antibody fragment such as an Fv fragment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA particularly preferred type of substitutional variant involves substituting one or more hypervariable region residues of a parent antibody. Generally, the resulting variant(s) selected for further development will have improved biological properties relative to the parent antibody from which it is generated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMost preferred are antibodies that have been modified as described in WO 99/58572, published Nov. 18, 1999. These antibodies comprise, in addition to a binding domain directed at the target molecule, an effector domain having an amino acid sequence substantially homologous to all or part of a constant domain of a human immunoglobulin heavy chain. These antibodies are capable of binding the target molecule without triggering significant complement dependent lysis, or cell-mediated destruction of the target. Preferably, the effector domain is capable of specifically binding FcRn and/or FcγRIIb. These are typically based on chimeric domains derived from two or more human immunoglobulin \nheavy chain C\n \n \n \nH\n2 domains. Antibodies modified in this manner are preferred for use in chronic antibody therapy, to avoid inflammatory and other adverse reactions to conventional antibody therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlycosylation variants of antibodies are variants in which the glycosylation pattern of an antibody is altered. “Altering” means deleting one or more carbohydrate moieties found in the antibody, adding one or more carbohydrate moieties to the antibody, changing the composition of glycosylation (glycosylation pattern), the extent of glycosylation, etc. Glycosylation variants may, for example, be prepared by removing, changing and/or adding one or more glycosylation sites in the nucleic acid sequence encoding the antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies are glycosylated at conserved positions in their constant regions (Jefferis and Lund, 1997, Chem. Immunol. 65:111-128; Wright and Morrison, 1997, TibTECH 15:26-32). The oligosaccharide side chains of the immunoglobulins affect the protein's function (Boyd et al., 1996, Mol. Immunol. 32:1311-1318; Wittwe and Howard, 1990, Biochem. 29:4175-4180) and the intramolecular interaction between portions of the glycoprotein, which can affect the conformation and presented three-dimensional surface of the glycoprotein (Hefferis and Lund, supra; Wyss and Wagner, 1996, Current Opin. Biotech. 7:409-416). Oligosaccharides may also serve to target a given glycoprotein to certain molecules based upon specific recognition structures. Glycosylation of antibodies has also been reported to affect antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In particular, CHO cells with tetracycline-regulated expression of β(1,4)-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnTIII), a glycosyltransferase catalyzing formation of bisecting GlcNAc, was reported to have improved ADCC activity (Umana et al., 1999, Mature Biotech. 17:176-180).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlycosylation of antibodies is typically either N-linked or O-linked. N-linked refers to the attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The tripeptide sequences asparagine-X-serine and asparagine-X-threonine, where X is any amino acid except proline, are the recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. Thus, the presence of either of these tripeptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site. O-linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of one of the sugars N-acetylgalactosamine, galactose, or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid, most commonly serine or threonine, although 5-hydroxyproline or 5-hydroxylysine may also be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAddition of glycosylation sites to the antibody is conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that it contains one or more of the above-described tripeptide sequences (for N-linked glycosylation sites). The alteration may also be made by the addition of, or substitution by, one or more serine or threonine residues to the sequence of the original antibody (for O-linked glycosylation sites).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acid molecules encoding amino acid sequence variants of the antibody can be prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include, but are not limited to, isolation from a natural source (in the case of naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants) or preparation by oligonucleotide-mediated (or site-directed) mutagenesis, PCR mutagenesis, and cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared variant or a non-variant version of the antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe glycosylation pattern of antibodies may also be altered without altering the underlying nucleotide sequence. Glycosylation largely depends on the host cell used to express the antibody. Since the cell type used for expression of recombinant glycoproteins, e.g. antibodies, as potential therapeutics is rarely the native cell, variations in the glycosylation pattern of the antibodies can be expected (see, e.g. Hse et al., 1997, J. Biol. Chem. 272:9062-9070).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the choice of host cells, factors that affect glycosylation during recombinant production of antibodies include growth mode, media formulation, culture density, oxygenation, pH, purification schemes and the like. Various methods have been proposed to alter the glycosylation pattern achieved in a particular host organism including introducing or overexpressing certain enzymes involved in oligosaccharide production (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,047,335; 5,510,261 and 5,278,299). Glycosylation, or certain types of glycosylation, can be enzymatically removed from the glycoprotein, for example using endoglycosidase H (Endo H). In addition, the recombinant host cell can be genetically engineered to be defective in processing certain types of polysaccharides. These and similar techniques are well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolypeptides may comprise a signal (or leader) sequence at the N-terminal end of the protein that co-translationally or post-translationally directs transfer of the protein. The polypeptide may also be conjugated to a linker or other sequence for ease of synthesis, purification or identification of the polypeptide (e.g., poly-FEs), or to enhance binding of the polypeptide to a solid support. For example, a polypeptide may be conjugated to an immunoglobulin Fc region.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPortions and other variants having fewer than about 100 amino acids, and generally fewer than about 50 amino acids, may also be generated by synthetic means, using techniques well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. For example, such polypeptides may be synthesized using any of the commercially available solid-phase techniques, such as the Merrifield solid-phase synthesis method, where amino acids are sequentially added to a growing amino acid chain. See Merrifield, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 85:2149-2146, 1963. Equipment for automated synthesis of polypeptides is commercially available from suppliers such as Perkin Elmer/Applied BioSystems Division (Foster City, Calif.), and may be operated according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolypeptides can be synthesized on a Perkin Elmer/Applied Biosystems Division 430A peptide synthesizer using FMOC chemistry with HPTU (O-BenzotriazoleN,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate) activation. A Gly-Cys-Gly sequence may be attached to the amino terminus of the peptide to provide a method of conjugation, binding to an immobilized surface, or labeling of the peptide. Cleavage of the peptides from the solid support may be carried out using the following cleavage mixture: trifluoroacetic acid:ethanedithiol:thioanisole:waterphenol (40:1:2:2:3). After cleaving for 2 hours, the peptides may be precipitated in cold methyl-t-butyl-ether. The peptide pellets may then be dissolved in water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and lyophilized prior to purification by C18 reverse phase HPLC. A gradient of 0%-60% acetonitrile (containing 0.1% TFA) in water may be used to elute the peptides. Following lyophilization of the pure fractions, the peptides may be characterized using electrospray or other types of mass spectrometry and by amino acid analysis.\n\n\n \nFusion Proteins\n\n\n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the polypeptide is a fusion protein that comprises multiple polypeptides as described herein, or that comprises at least one polypeptide as described herein and an unrelated sequence. Additional fusion partners can be added.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA fusion partner may, for example, serve as an immunological fusion partner by assisting in the provision of T helper epitopes, preferably T helper epitopes recognized by humans. As another example, a fusion partner may serve as an expression enhancer, assisting in expressing the protein at higher yields than the native recombinant protein. Certain preferred fusion partners are both immunological and expression enhancing fusion partners. Other fusion partners may be selected so as to increase the solubility of the protein or to enable the protein to be targeted to desired intracellular compartments. Still further fusion partners include affinity tags, which facilitate purification of the protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFusion proteins may generally be prepared using standard techniques, including chemical conjugation. Preferably, a fusion protein is expressed as a recombinant protein, allowing the production of increased levels, relative to a non-fused protein, in an expression system. Briefly, DNA sequences encoding the polypeptide components may be assembled separately, and ligated into an appropriate expression vector. The 3′ end of the DNA sequence encoding one polypeptide component is ligated, with or without a peptide linker, to the 5′ end of a DNA sequence encoding the second polypeptide component so that the reading frames of the sequences are in phase. This permits translation into a single fusion protein that retains the biological activity of both component polypeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA peptide linker sequence may be employed to separate the first and the second polypeptide components by a distance sufficient to ensure that each polypeptide folds into its secondary and tertiary structures. Such a peptide linker sequence is incorporated into the fusion protein using standard techniques well known in the art. Suitable peptide linker sequences may be chosen based on the following factors: (1) their ability to adopt a flexible extended conformation; (2) their inability to adopt a secondary structure that could interact with functional epitopes on the first and second polypeptides; and (3) the lack of hydrophobic or charged residues that might react with the polypeptide functional epitopes. Preferred peptide linker sequences contain Gly, Asn and Ser residues. Other near neutral amino acids, such as Thr and Ala may also be used in the linker sequence. Amino acid sequences which may be usefully employed as linkers include those disclosed in Maratea et al., Gene 40:39-46, 1985; Murphy et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83:8258-8262, 1986; U.S. Pat. No. 4,935,233 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,751,180. The linker sequence may generally be from 1 to about 50 amino acids in length. Linker sequences are not required when the first and second polypeptides have non-essential N-terminal amino acid regions that can be used to separate the functional domains and prevent steric interference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ligated DNA sequences are operably linked to suitable transcriptional or translational regulatory elements. The regulatory elements responsible for expression of DNA are located 5′ to the DNA sequence encoding the first polypeptide. Similarly, stop codons required to end translation and transcription termination signals are present 3′ to the DNA sequence encoding the second or final polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFusion proteins are also provided that comprise a polypeptide of the present invention together with an unrelated immunogenic protein. Preferably the immunogenic protein is capable of eliciting a memory response. Examples of such proteins include tetanus, tuberculosis and hepatitis proteins (see, for example, Stoute et al., 1997, New Engl. J. Med. 336:86-91).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWithin preferred embodiments, an immunological fusion partner is derived from protein D, a surface protein of the gram-negative bacterium \nHaemophilus influenza \nB (WO 91/18926). Preferably, a protein D derivative comprises approximately the first third of the protein (e.g., the first N-terminal 100-110 amino acids), and a protein D derivative may be lipidated. Within certain preferred embodiments, the first 109 residues of a Lipoprotein D fusion partner is included on the N-terminus to provide the polypeptide with additional exogenous T-cell epitopes and to increase the expression level in \nE. coli \n(thus functioning as an expression enhancer). The lipid tail ensures optimal presentation of antigen to antigen presenting cells. Other fusion partners include the non-structural protein from influenzae virus, NS I (hemaglutinin). Typically, the N-terminal 81 amino acids are used, although different fragments that include T-helper epitopes may be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the immunological fusion partner is the protein known as LYTA, or a portion thereof (preferably a C-terminal portion). LYTA is derived from \nStreptococcus pneumoniae\n, which synthesizes an N-acetyl-L-alanine amidase known as amidase LYTA (encoded by the LytA gene; Gene 43:265-292, 1986). LYTA is an autolysin that specifically degrades certain bonds in the peptidoglycan backbone. The C-terminal domain of the LYTA protein is responsible for the affinity to the choline or to some choline analogues such as DEAR This property has been exploited for the development of \nE. coli \nCLYTA expressing plasmids useful for expression of fusion proteins. Purification of hybrid proteins containing the C-LYTA fragment at the amino terminus has been described (see Biotechnology 10:795-798, 1992). Within a preferred embodiment, a repeat portion of LYTA may be incorporated into a fusion protein. A repeat portion is found in the C-terminal region starting at residue 178. A particularly preferred repeat portion incorporates residues 188-305.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, polypeptides (including fusion proteins) and polynucleotides as described herein are isolated. An “isolated” polypeptide or polynucleotide is one that is removed from its original environment. For example, a naturally occurring protein is isolated if it is separated from some or all of the coexisting materials in the natural system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, such polypeptides are at least about 90% pure, more preferably at least about 95% pure and most preferably at least about 99% pure. A polynucleotide is considered to be isolated if, for example, it is cloned into a vector that is not a part of the natural environment.\n\n\n \nPolynucleotides and Vectors\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention further provides isolated polynucleotides that encode a monoclonal antibody as described herein, as well as vectors comprising the polynucleotide and a host cell containing the vector. Such expression systems can be used in a method of producing an immunoreactive polypeptide, such as an antibody of the invention, wherein the host cell is cultured and the polypeptide produced by the cultured host cell is recovered. Polynucleotides encoding antibodies of the invention can also be delivered to a host subject for expression of the antibody by cells of the host subject. Examples of strategies for polynucleotide delivery to and expression of anti-senilin antibodies in the central nervous system of a host subject are described in PCT application No. WO98/44955, published Oct. 15, 1998.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolynucleotides complementary to any such sequences are also encompassed by the present invention. Polynucleotides may be single-stranded (coding or antisense) or double-stranded, and may be DNA (genomic, cDNA or synthetic) or RNA molecules. RNA molecules include HnRNA molecules, which contain introns and correspond to a DNA molecule in a one-to-one manner, and mRNA molecules, which do not contain introns. Additional coding or non-coding sequences may, but need not, be present within a polynucleotide of the present invention, and a polynucleotide may, but need not, be linked to other molecules and/or support materials.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolynucleotides may comprise a native sequence (i.e., an endogenous sequence that encodes an antibody or a portion thereof) or may comprise a variant of such a sequence. Polynucleotide variants contain one or more substitutions, additions, deletions and/or insertions such that the immunoreactivity of the encoded polypeptide is not diminished, relative to a native immunoreactive molecule. The effect on the immunoreactivity of the encoded polypeptide may generally be assessed as described herein. Variants preferably exhibit at least about 70% identity, more preferably at least about 80% identity and most preferably at least about 90% identity to a polynucleotide sequence that encodes a native antibody or a portion thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo polynucleotide or polypeptide sequences are said to be “identical” if the sequence of nucleotides or amino acids in the two sequences is the same when aligned for maximum correspondence as described below. Comparisons between two sequences are typically performed by comparing the sequences over a comparison window to identify and compare local regions of sequence similarity. A “comparison window” as used herein, refers to a segment of at least about 20 contiguous positions, usually 30 to about 75, 40 to about 50, in which a sequence may be compared to a reference sequence of the same number of contiguous positions after the two sequences are optimally aligned.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOptimal alignment of sequences for comparison may be conducted using the Megalign program in the Lasergene suite of bioinformatics software (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, Wis.), using default parameters. This program embodies several alignment schemes described in the following references: Dayhoff, M. O. (1978) A model of evolutionary change in proteins—Matrices for detecting distant relationships. In Dayhoff, M. O. (ed.) Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure, National Biomedical Research Foundation, Washington D.C. Vol. 5, Suppl. 3, pp. 345-358; Hein J., 1990, Unified Approach to Alignment and Phylogenes pp. 626-645 Methods in Enzymology vol. 183, Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, Calif.; Higgins, D. G. and Sharp, P. M., 1989, CABIOS 5:151-153; Myers, E. W. and Muller W., 1988, CABIOS 4:11-17; Robinson, E. D., 1971, Comb. Theor. 11:105; Santou, N., Nes, M., 1987, Mol. Biol. Evol. 4:406-425; Sneath, P. H. A. and Sokal, R. R., 1973, Numerical Taxonomy the Principles and Practice of Numerical Taxonomy, Freeman Press, San Francisco, Calif.; Wilbur, W. J. and Lipman, D. J., 1983, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 80:726-730.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, the “percentage of sequence identity” is determined by comparing two optimally aligned sequences over a window of comparison of at least 20 positions, wherein the portion of the polynucleotide or polypeptide sequence in the comparison window may comprise additions or deletions (i.e. gaps) of 20 percent or less, usually 5 to 15 percent, or 10 to 12 percent, as compared to the reference sequences (which does not comprise additions or deletions) for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The percentage is calculated by determining the number of positions at which the identical nucleic acid bases or amino acid residue occurs in both sequences to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the reference sequence (i.e. the window size) and multiplying the results by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVariants may also, or alternatively, be substantially homologous to a native gene, or a portion or complement thereof. Such polynucleotide variants are capable of hybridizing under moderately stringent conditions to a naturally occurring DNA sequence encoding a native antibody (or a complementary sequence).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable “moderately stringent conditions” include prewashing in a solution of 5×SSC, 0.5% SDS, 1.0 mM EDTA (pH 8.0); hybridizing at 50° C.-65° C., 5×SSC, overnight; followed by washing twice at 65° C. for 20 minutes with each of 2×, 0.5× and 0.2×SSC containing 0.1 SDS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “highly stringent conditions” or “high stringency conditions” are those that: (1) employ low ionic strength and high temperature for washing, for example 0.015 M sodium chloride/0.0015 M sodium citrate/0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 50° C.; (2) employ during hybridization a denaturing agent, such as formamide, for example, 50% (v/v) formamide with 0.1% bovine serum albumin/0.1% Ficoll/0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone/50 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 6.5 with 750 mM sodium chloride, 75 mM sodium citrate at 42° C.; or (3) employ 50% formamide, 5×SSC (0.75 M NaCl, 0.075 M sodium citrate), 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.8), 0.1% sodium pyrophosphate, 5×Denhardt's solution, sonicated salmon sperm DNA (50 μg/ml), 0.1% SDS, and 10% dextran sulfate at 42° C., with washes at 42° C. in 0.2×SSC (sodium chloride/sodium citrate) and 50% formamide at 55° C., followed by a high-stringency wash consisting of 0.1×SSC containing EDTA at 55° C. The skilled artisan will recognize how to adjust the temperature, ionic strength, etc. as necessary to accommodate factors such as probe length and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that, as a result of the degeneracy of the genetic code, there are many nucleotide sequences that encode a polypeptide as described herein. Some of these polynucleotides bear minimal homology to the nucleotide sequence of any native gene. Nonetheless, polynucleotides that vary due to differences in codon usage are specifically contemplated by the present invention. Further, alleles of the genes comprising the polynucleotide sequences provided herein are within the scope of the present invention. Alleles are endogenous genes that are altered as a result of one or more mutations, such as deletions, additions and/or substitutions of nucleotides. The resulting mRNA and protein may, but need not, have an altered structure or function. Alleles may be identified using standard techniques (such as hybridization, amplification and/or database sequence comparison).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolynucleotides may be prepared using any of a variety of techniques known in the art. DNA encoding an antibody may be obtained from a cDNA library prepared from tissue expressing antibody mRNA. The antibody-encoding gene may also be obtained from a genomic library or by oligonucleotide synthesis. Libraries can be screened with probes (such as binding partners or oligonucleotides of at least about 20-80 bases) designed to identify the gene of interest or the protein encoded by it. Illustrative libraries include human liver cDNA library (human liver 5′ stretch plus cDNA, Clontech Laboratories, Inc.) and mouse kidney cDNA library (mouse kidney 5′-stretch cDNA, Clontech laboratories, Inc.). Screening the cDNA or genomic library with the selected probe may be conducted using standard procedures, such as those described in Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, New York: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989. Alternatively, one can isolate the gene encoding antibody using PCR methodology (Sambrook et al., supra; Dieffenbach et al., PCR Primer: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1995).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe oligonucleotide sequences selected as probes should be sufficiently long and sufficiently unambiguous that false positives are minimized. The oligonucleotide is preferably labeled such that it can be detected upon hybridization to DNA in the library being screened. Methods of labeling are well known in the art, and include the use of radiolabels, such as \n32\nP-labeled ATP, biotinylation or enzyme labeling. Hybridization conditions, including moderate stringency and high stringency, are provided in Sambrook et al., supra.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSequences identified in such library screening methods can be compared and aligned to other known sequences deposited and available in public databases such as GenBank or other private sequence databases. Sequence identity (at either the amino acid or nucleotide level) within defined regions of the molecule or across the full-length sequence can be determined through sequence alignment using computer software programs, which employ various algorithms to measure homology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acid molecules having protein coding sequence may be obtained by screening selected cDNA or genomic libraries, and, if necessary, using conventional primer extension procedures as described in Sambrook et al., supra, to detect precursors and processing intermediates of mRNA that may not have been reverse-transcribed into cDNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolynucleotide variants may generally be prepared by any method known in the art, including chemical synthesis by, for example, solid phase phosphoramidite chemical synthesis. Modifications in a polynucleotide sequence may also be introduced using standard mutagenesis techniques, such as oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis (see Adelman et al., DNA 2:183, 1983). Alternatively, RNA molecules may be generated by in vitro or in vivo transcription of DNA sequences encoding an antibody, or portion thereof, provided that the DNA is incorporated into a vector with a suitable RNA polymerase promoter (such as T7 or SP6). Certain portions may be used to prepare an encoded polypeptide, as described herein. In addition, or alternatively, a portion may be administered to a patient such that the encoded polypeptide is generated in vivo (e.g., by transfecting antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells, with a cDNA construct encoding the polypeptide, and administering the transfected cells to the patient).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny polynucleotide may be further modified to increase stability in vivo. Possible modifications include, but are not limited to, the addition of flanking sequences at the 5′ and/or 3′ ends; the use of phosphorothioate or 2′ O-methyl rather than phosphodiesterase linkages in the backbone; and/or the inclusion of nontraditional bases such as inosine, queosine and wybutosine, as well as acetyl-, methyl-, thio- and other modified forms of adenine, cytidine, guanine, thymine and uridine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleotide sequences can be joined to a variety of other nucleotide sequences using established recombinant DNA techniques. For example, a polynucleotide may be cloned into any of a variety of cloning vectors, including plasmids, phagemids, lambda phage derivatives and cosmids. Vectors of particular interest include expression vectors, replication vectors, probe generation vectors and sequencing vectors. In general, a vector will contain an origin of replication functional in at least one organism, convenient restriction endonuclease sites and one or more selectable markers. Other elements will depend upon the desired use, and will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWithin certain embodiments, polynucleotides may be formulated so as to permit entry into a cell of a mammal, and to permit expression therein. Such formulations are particularly useful for therapeutic purposes, as described below. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that there are many ways to achieve expression of a polynucleotide in a target cell, and any suitable method may be employed. For example, a polynucleotide may be incorporated into a viral vector such as, but not limited to, adenovirus, adeno-associated virus, retrovirus, or vaccinia or other pox virus (e.g., avian pox virus). Techniques for incorporating DNA into such vectors are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. A retroviral vector may additionally transfer or incorporate a gene for a selectable marker (to aid in the identification or selection of transduced cells) and/or a targeting moiety, such as a gene that encodes a ligand for a receptor on a specific target cell, to render the vector target specific. Targeting may also be accomplished using an antibody, by methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther formulations for therapeutic purposes include colloidal dispersion systems, such as macromolecule complexes, nanocapsules, microspheres, beads, and lipid-based systems including oil-in-water emulsions, micelles, mixed micelles, and liposomes. A preferred colloidal system for use as a delivery vehicle in vitro and in vivo is a liposome (i.e., an artificial membrane vesicle). The preparation and use of such systems is well known in the art.\n\n\n \nPharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention provides antibodies, polypeptides, and/or polynucleotides that are incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition comprises an antibody that preferentially binds to amino acids 28-40 of Aβ peptide (SEQ ID NO:1). In some embodiments, the antibody is a monoclonal antibody. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition comprises a monoclonal antibody that preferentially binds to an epitope that includes amino acid 39 and/or 40 of the Aβ peptide (SEQ ID NO:1). In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition comprises a monoclonal antibody that preferentially binds to an epitope that includes amino acids 36-40 of the Aβ peptide (SEQ ID NO:1). In some embodiments, the antibody binds to amino acids 28-40 of Aβ peptide (SEQ ID NO:1) with an affinity of about 60 nM or less, about 30 nM or less, or about 3 nM or less. In some embodiments, antibody preferentially binds to an epitope that includes amino acid 39 and/or 40 of the Aβ peptide (SEQ ID NO:1) with an affinity of about 60 nM or less, about 30 nM or less, or about 3 nM or less. In some embodiments, antibody preferentially binds to an epitope that includes amino acids 36-40 of the Aβ peptide (SEQ ID NO:1) with an affinity of about 60 nM or less, about 30 nM or less, or about 3 nM or less. In some embodiments, the antibodies of described above do not show significant cross-reactivity with Aβ\n1-41 \nand/or Aβ\n1-42\n. In some embodiments, the antibody competitively inhibits binding of a monoclonal antibody comprising the amino acid sequences shown in SEQ ID NO:4 and/or 6, or the monoclonal antibody produced by the hybridoma designated 8A1.2A1. In some embodiments, the antibody binds to the same epitope on Aβ peptide (SEQ ID NO:1) as an antibody comprising amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:4 or 6, or the monoclonal antibody produced by the hybridoma designated 8A1.2A1 binds. In other embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition comprises a human antibody, a humanized or a chimeric antibody derived from any of the antibodies described herein. Pharmaceutical compositions comprise one or more such compounds and, optionally, a physiologically acceptable carrier. Pharmaceutical compositions within the scope of the present invention may also contain other compounds that may be biologically active or inactive. In a preferred embodiment, the composition comprises at least two antibodies, a first antibody directed against amino acids 16-28 of Aβ peptide and a second antibody directed against amino acids 28-40 of Aβ peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA pharmaceutical composition can contain DNA encoding one or more of the polypeptides as described above, such that the polypeptide is generated in situ. As noted above, the DNA may be present within any of a variety of delivery systems known to those of ordinary skill in the art, including nucleic acid expression systems, bacteria and viral expression systems. Numerous gene delivery techniques are well known in the art, such as those described by Rolland, 1998, Crit. Rev. Therap. Drug Carrier Systems 15:143-198, and references cited therein. Appropriate nucleic acid expression systems contain the necessary DNA sequences for expression in the patient (such as a suitable promoter and terminating signal).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment, the DNA may be introduced using a viral expression system (e.g., vaccinia or other pox virus, retrovirus, or adenovirus), which may involve the use of a non-pathogenic (defective), replication competent virus. Suitable systems are disclosed, for example, in Fisher-Hoch et al., 1989, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:317-321; Flexner et al., 1989, Ann. N.Y. Acad Sci 569:86-103; Flexner et al., 1990, Vaccine 8:17-21; U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,603,112, 4,769,330, and 5,017,487; WO 89/01973; U.S. Pat. No. 4,777,127; GB 2,200,651; EP 0,345,242; WO 91/02805; Berkner-Biotechniques 6:616-627, 1988; Rosenfeld et al., 1991, Science 252:431-434; Kolls et al., 1994, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:215-219; Kass-Eisler et al., 1993, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:11498-11502; Guzman et al., 1993, Circulation 88:2838-2848; and Guzman et al., 1993, Cir. Res. 73:1202-1207. Techniques for incorporating DNA into such expression systems are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. The DNA may also be “naked,” as described, for example, in Ulmer et al., 1993, Science 259:1745-1749, and reviewed by Cohen, 1993, Science 259:1691-1692. The uptake of naked DNA may be increased by coating the DNA onto biodegradable beads, which are efficiently transported into the cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile any suitable carrier known to those of ordinary skill in the art may be employed in the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, the type of carrier will vary depending on the mode of administration. Compositions of the present invention may be formulated for any appropriate manner of administration, including for example, topical, oral, nasal, intravenous, intracranial, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous or intramuscular administration. For parenteral administration, such as subcutaneous injection, the carrier preferably comprises water, saline, alcohol, a fat, a wax or a buffer. For oral administration, any of the above carriers or a solid carrier, such as mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharine, talcum, cellulose, glucose, sucrose, and magnesium carbonate, may be employed. Biodegradable microspheres (e.g., polylactate polyglycolate) may also be employed as carriers for the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention. Suitable biodegradable microspheres are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,897,268 and 5,075,109.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch compositions may also comprise buffers (e.g., neutral buffered saline or phosphate buffered saline), carbohydrates (e.g., glucose, mannose, sucrose or dextrans), mannitol, proteins, polypeptides or amino acids such as glycine, antioxidants, chelating agents such as EDTA or glutathione, adjuvants (e.g., aluminum hydroxide) and/or preservatives. Alternatively, compositions of the present invention may be formulated as a lyophilizate. Compounds may also be encapsulated within liposomes using well known technology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions described herein may be administered as part of a sustained release formulation (i.e., a formulation such as a capsule or sponge that effects a slow release of compound following administration). Such formulations may generally be prepared using well known technology and administered by, for example, oral, rectal or subcutaneous implantation, or by implantation at the desired target site. Sustained-release formulations may contain a polypeptide, polynucleotide or antibody dispersed in a carrier matrix and/or contained within a reservoir surrounded by a rate controlling membrane. Carriers for use within such formulations are biocompatible, and may also be biodegradable; preferably the formulation provides a relatively constant level of active component release. The amount of active compound contained within a sustained release formulation depends upon the site of implantation, the rate and expected duration of release and the nature of the condition to be treated or prevented.\n\n\n \nTherapeutic and Prophylactic Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nThe antibodies (including polypeptides), polynucleotides, and pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be used in methods for treating, preventing and inhibiting the development of Alzheimer's disease and other diseases associated with altered Aβ or βAPP expression, or accumulation of Aβ peptide, such as Down's syndrome, Parkinson's disease, and multi-infarct dementia. Such methods comprise administering the immunoreactive molecules, antibodies (including polypeptides), polynucleotides or pharmaceutical composition to the subject. In prophylactic applications, pharmaceutical compositions or medicaments are administered to a patient susceptible to, or otherwise at risk of, Alzheimer's disease in an amount sufficient to eliminate or reduce the risk, lessen the severity, or delay the outset of the disease, including biochemical, histologic and/or behavioral symptoms of the disease, its complications and intermediate pathological phenotypes presenting during development of the disease. In therapeutic applications, compositions or medicaments are administered to a patient suspected of, or already suffering from such a disease in amount sufficient to cure, or at least partially arrest, the symptoms of the disease (biochemical, histologic and/or behavioral), including its complications and intermediate pathological phenotypes in development of the disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides a method of delaying development of a symptom associated with Alzheimer's disease in a subject comprising administering an effective dosage of a pharmaceutical composition comprising an antibody (including polypeptides) or polynucleotide of the invention to the subject. Symptoms associated with Alzheimer disease includes, but not limited to, abnormalities of memory, problem solving, language, calculation, visuospatial perception, judgment, and behavior.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis invention also provides methods of inhibiting or suppressing the formation of amyloid plaques in a subject comprising administering an effective dose of a pharmaceutical composition of the invention to the subject. In some embodiments, the amyloid plaques are in the brain of the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis invention also provides methods of reducing amyloid plaques in a subject comprising administering an effective dose of a pharmaceutical composition of the invention to the subject. In some embodiments, the amyloid plaques are in the brain of the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis invention also provides methods of removing or clearing amyloid plaques in a subject comprising administering an effective dose of a pharmaceutical composition of the invention to the subject. In some embodiments, the amyloid plaques are in the brain of the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis invention also provides methods of reducing Aβ peptide in a tissue (such as brain), inhibiting and/or reducing accumulation of Aβ peptide in a tissue (such as brain), and inhibiting and/or reducing toxic effects of Aβ peptide in a tissue (such as brain) in a subject comprising administering an effective dose of a pharmaceutical composition of the invention to the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe methods described herein (including prophylaxis or therapy) can be accomplished by a single direct injection at a single time point or multiple time points to a single or multiple sites. Administration can also be nearly simultaneous to multiple sites. Frequency of administration may be determined and adjusted over the course of therapy, and is base on accomplishing desired results. In some cases, sustained continuous release formulations of antibodies (including polypeptides), polynucleotides, and pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be appropriate. Various formulations and devices for achieving sustained release are known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPatients, subjects, or individuals include mammals, such as human, bovine, equine, canine, feline, porcine, and ovine animals. The subject is preferably a human, and may or may not be afflicted with disease or presently show symptoms. In the case of Alzheimer's disease, virtually anyone is at risk of suffering from Alzheimer's disease if he or she lives long enough. Therefore, the present methods can be administered prophylactically to the general population without the need for any assessment of the risk of the subject patient. The present methods are useful for individuals who do have a known genetic risk of Alzheimer's disease. Such individuals include those having relatives who have experienced this disease, and those whose risk is determined by analysis of genetic or biochemical markers. Genetic markers of risk toward Alzheimer's disease include mutations in the APP gene, particularly mutations at position 717 and positions 670 and 671 referred to as the Hardy and Swedish mutations respectively (see Hardy (1997) Trends Neurosci. 20:154-9). Other markers of risk are mutations in the presenilin genes, PS1 and PS2, and ApoE4, family history of AD, hypercholesterolemia or atherosclerosis. Individuals presently suffering from Alzheimer's disease can be recognized from characteristic dementia, as well as the presence of risk factors described above. In addition, a number of diagnostic tests are available for identifying individuals who have AD. These include measurement of CSF tau and Aβ42 levels. Elevated tau and decreased Aβ42 levels signify the presence of AD. Individuals suffering from Alzheimer's disease can also be diagnosed by ADRDA (Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association) criteria. In asymptomatic patients, treatment can begin at any age (e.g., 10, 20, 30). Usually, however, it is not necessary to begin treatment until a patient reaches 40, 50, 60 or 70. Treatment typically entails multiple dosages over a period of time. Treatment can be monitored by various ways known in the art over time. In the case of potential Down's syndrome patients, treatment can begin antenatally by administering therapeutic agent to the mother or shortly after birth.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical composition that can be used in the above methods include, but is not limited to, antibodies that preferentially bind to amino acids 28-40 of Aβ peptide (SEQ ID NO:1), antibodies that preferentially bind to an epitope that includes amino acid 39 and/or 40 of Aβ peptide (SEQ ID NO:1), antibodies that bind to amino acids 28-40 of Aβ peptide (SEQ ID NO:1) with an affinity of about 60 nM or less, about 30 nM or less, or about 3 nM or less, antibodies that preferentially bind to an epitope that includes amino acid 39 and/or 40 of Aβ peptide (SEQ ID NO:1) with an affinity of about 60 nM or less, about 30 nM or less, or about 3 nM or less, and polynucleotides encoding any of the antibodies and polypeptides described herein. In other embodiments, the following antibodies can be used: the antibody that binds to an epitope that includes amino acid 39 and/or 40 of Aβ peptide (SEQ ID NO:1), but does not show significant cross-reactivity with Aβ\n1-42 \nand Aβ\n1-43 \npeptide; the Fab fragment of the antibody binds to Aβ\n1-40 \npeptide (SEQ ID NO:1) with an affinity of about 200 nM or less, or about 1 nM or less; the antibody competitively inhibits binding of a monoclonal antibody comprising amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4 and 6 to Aβ\n1-40 \npeptide (SEQ ID. NO:1); the antibody binds to the same epitope to which a monoclonal antibody comprising amino acid sequence of SEQ. ID. NO: 4 and 6 binds; and antibodies having any combination of the properties described above.\n\n\n \nAdministration and Dosage\n\n\n \n \n \nThe antibody is preferably administered to the mammal in a carrier; preferably a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier. Suitable carriers and their formulations are described in \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, \n18th edition, A. Gennaro, ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1990; and \nRemington, The Science and Practice of Pharmacy \n20th Ed. Mack Publishing, 2000. Typically, an appropriate amount of a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt is used in the formulation to render the formulation isotonic. Examples of the carrier include saline, Ringer's solution and dextrose solution. The pH of the solution is preferably from about 5 to about 8, and more preferably from about 7 to about 7.5. Further carriers include sustained release preparations such as semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the antibody, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, liposomes or microparticles. It will be apparent to those persons skilled in the art that certain carriers may be more preferable depending upon, for instance, the route of administration and concentration of antibody being administered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibody can be administered to the mammal by injection (e.g., systemic, intravenous, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraportal), or by other methods, such as infusion, which ensure its delivery to the bloodstream in an effective form. The antibody may also be administered by isolated perfusion techniques, such as isolated tissue perfusion, to exert local therapeutic effects. Intravenous injection is preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEffective dosages and schedules for administering the antibody may be determined empirically, and making such determinations is within the skill in the art. Those skilled in the art will understand that the dosage of antibody that must be administered will vary depending on, for example, the mammal that will receive the antibody, the route of administration, the particular type of antibody used and other drugs being administered to the mammal. Guidance in selecting appropriate doses for antibody is found in the literature on therapeutic uses of antibodies, e.g., \nHandbook of Monoclonal Antibodies\n, Ferrone et al., eds., Noges Publications, Park Ridge, N.J., 1985, ch. 22 and pp. 303-357; Smith et al., \nAntibodies in Human Diagnosis and Therapy\n, Haber et al., eds., Raven Press, New York, 1977, pp. 365-389. A typical daily dosage of the antibody used alone might range from about 1 μg/kg to up to 100 mg/kg of body weight or more per day, depending on the factors mentioned above. Generally, any of the following doses may be used: a dose of at least about 50 mg/kg body weight; at least about 10 mg/kg body weight; at least about 3 mg/kg body weight; at least about 1 mg/kg body weight; at least about 750 μg/kg body weight; at least about 500 μg/kg body weight; at least about 250 ug/kg body weight; at least about 100 μg/kg body weight; at least about 50 μg/kg body weight; at least about 10 ug/kg body weight; at least about 1 μg/kg body weight, or more, is administered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, more than one antibody may be present. Such compositions may contain at least one, at least two, at least three, at least four, at least five different antibodies (including polypeptides) of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibody may also be administered to the mammal in combination with effective amounts of one or more other therapeutic agents. The antibody may be administered sequentially or concurrently with the one or more other therapeutic agents. The amounts of antibody and therapeutic agent depend, for example, on what type of drugs are used, the pathological condition being treated, and the scheduling and routes of administration but would generally be less than if each were used individually.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing administration of antibody to the mammal, the mammal's physiological condition can be monitored in various ways well known to the skilled practitioner.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above principles of administration and dosage can be adapted for polypeptides described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA polynucleotide encoding an antibody (including a polypeptide) of the invention may also be used for delivery and expression of the antibody or the polypeptide in a desired cell. It is apparent that an expression vector can be used to direct expression of the antibody. The expression vector can be administered systemically, intraperitoneally, intravenously, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intrathecally, intraventricularly, orally, enterally, parenterally, intranasally, dermally, or by inhalation. For example, administration of expression vectors includes local or systemic administration, including injection, oral administration, particle gun or catheterized administration, and topical administration. One skilled in the art is familiar with administration of expression vectors to obtain expression of an exogenous protein in vivo. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,436,908; 6,413,942; and 6,376,471.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTargeted delivery of therapeutic compositions comprising a polynucleotide encoding an antibody of the invention can also be used. Receptor-mediated DNA delivery techniques are described in, for example, Findeis et al., \nTrends Biotechnol\n. (1993) 11:202; Chiou et al., \nGene Therapeutics: Methods And Applications Of Direct Gene Transfer \n(J. A. Wolff, ed.) (1994); Wu et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem\n. (1988) 263:621; Wu et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem\n. (1994) 269:542; Zenke et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci\n. (\nUSA\n) (1990) 87:3655; Wu et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem\n. (1991) 266:338. Therapeutic compositions containing a polynucleotide are administered in a range of about 100 ng to about 200 mg of DNA for local administration in a gene therapy protocol. Concentration ranges of about 500 ng to about 50 mg, about 1 μg to about 2 mg, about 5 μg to about 500 μg, and about 20 μg to about 100 μg of DNA can also be used during a gene therapy protocol. The therapeutic polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention can be delivered using gene delivery vehicles. The gene delivery vehicle can be of viral or non-viral origin (see generally, Jolly, \nCancer Gene Therapy \n(1994) 1:51; Kimura, \nHuman Gene Therapy \n(1994) 5:845; Connelly, \nHuman Gene Therapy \n(1995) 1:185; and Kaplitt, \nNature Genetics \n(1994) 6:148). Expression of such coding sequences can be induced using endogenous mammalian or heterologous promoters. Expression of the coding sequence can be either constitutive or regulated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nViral-based vectors for delivery of a desired polynucleotide and expression in a desired cell are well known in the art. Exemplary viral-based vehicles include, but are not limited to, recombinant retroviruses (see, e.g., PCT Publication Nos. WO 90/07936; WO 94/03622; WO 93/25698; WO 93/25234; WO 93/11230; WO 93/10218; WO 91/02805; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,219,740; 4,777,127; GB Patent No. 2,200,651; and \nEP\n 0 345 242), alphavirus-based vectors (e.g., Sindbis virus vectors, Semliki forest virus (ATCC VR-67; ATCC VR-1247), Ross River virus (ATCC VR-373; ATCC VR-1246) and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (ATCC VR-923; ATCC VR-1250; ATCC VR 1249; ATCC VR-532)), and adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors (see, e.g., PCT Publication Nos. WO 94/12649, WO 93/03769; WO 93/19191; WO. 94/28938; WO 95/11984 and WO 95/00655). Administration of DNA linked to killed adenovirus as described in Curiel, \nHum. Gene Ther\n. (1992) 3:147 can also be employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-viral delivery vehicles and methods can also be employed, including, but not limited to, polycationic condensed DNA linked or unlinked to killed adenovirus alone (see, e.g., Curiel, \nHum. Gene Ther\n. (1992) 3:147); ligand-linked DNA (see, e.g., Wu, \nJ. Biol. Chem\n. (1989) 264:16985); eukaryotic cell delivery vehicles cells (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,814,482; PCT Publication Nos. WO 95/07994; WO 96/17072; WO 95/30763; and WO 97/42338) and nucleic charge neutralization or fusion with cell membranes. Naked DNA can also be employed. Exemplary naked DNA introduction methods are described in PCT Publication No. WO 90/11092 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,580,859. Liposomes that can act as gene delivery vehicles are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,422,120; PCT Publication Nos. WO 95/13796; WO 94/23697; WO 91/14445; and \nEP\n 0 524 968. Additional approaches are described in Philip, \nMol. Cell. Biol\n. (1994) 14:2411, and in Woffendin, \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci\n. (1994) 91:1581.\n\n\n \nDiagnostic Uses of the Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nAntibodies of the invention can be used in the detection, diagnosis and monitoring of Alzheimer's disease and other diseases associated with altered Aβ or βAPP expression, such as Down's syndrome. The method comprises contacting a specimen of a patient suspected of having altered Aβ or βAPP expression with an antibody of the invention and determining whether the level of Aβ or βAPP differs from that of a control or comparison specimen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor diagnostic applications, the antibody typically will be labeled with a detectable moiety including but not limited to radioisotopes, flurescent labels, and various enzyme-substrate labels. Methods of conjugating labels to an antibody are known in the art. In other embodiment of the invention, antibodies of the invention need not be labeled, and the presence thereof can be detected using a labeled antibody which binds to the antibodies of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies of the present invention may be employed in any known assay method, such competitive binding assays, direct and indirect sandwich assays, and immunoprecipitation assays. Zola, Monoclonal Antibodies: A Manual of Techniques, pp. 147-158 (CRC Press, Inc. 1987).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies may also be used for in vivo diagnostic assays, such as in vivo imaging. Generally, the antibody is labeled with a radionuclide (such as \n111\nIn, \n99\nTc, \n14\nC, \n131\nI, \n125\nI, or \n3\nH) so that the cells or tissue of interest can be localized using immunoscintiography.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibody may also be used as staining reagent in pathology, following techniques well known in the art.\n\n\n \nKits\n\n\n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment, the invention provides articles of manufacture and kits containing materials useful for treating pathological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Down's syndrome, or other disease associated with altered Aβ or βAPP expression or detecting or purifying Aβ or βAPP. The article of manufacture comprises a container with a label. Suitable containers include, for example, bottles, vials, and test tubes. The containers may be formed from a variety of materials such as glass or plastic. The container holds a composition having an active agent which is effective for treating pathological conditions or for detecting or purifying Aβ or βAPP. The active agent in the composition is an antibody and preferably, comprises monoclonal antibodies specific for Aβ or βAPP. In some embodiments, the active agent is an antibody that binds to an epitope within amino acids 28-40 of Aβ peptide (SEQ ID NO:1). In some embodiments, the antibody preferentially binds to an epitope that spans amino acids 38-40 of Aβ peptide (SEQ ID NO:1). In some embodiments, the antibody preferentially binds to the amino acids 28-40 of Aβ peptide (SEQ ID NO:1) with an affinity of about 60 nM or less, about 30 nM or less, or about 3 nM or less. In some embodiments, antibody preferentially binds to an epitope that includes amino acid 39 and/or 40 of the Aβ peptide (SEQ ID NO:1) with an affinity of about 60 nM or less, about 30 nM or less, or about 3 nM or less. In some embodiments, the antibody competitively inhibits binding of a monoclonal antibody comprising the amino acid sequences shown in SEQ ID NO:4 and/or 6, or the monoclonal antibody produced by the hybridoma designated 8A1.2A1. In some embodiments, the antibody binds to the same epitope on Aβ peptide (SEQ ID NO:1) as an antibody comprising amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:4 and/or 6, or the monoclonal antibody produced by the hybridoma designated 8A1.2A1 binds. In some embodiments, the active agent comprises any of the humanized antibody, chimeric antibody or human antibody described herein. The label on the container indicates that the composition is used for treating pathological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease or detecting or purifying Aβ or βAPP, and may also indicate directions for either in vivo or in vitro use, such as those described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the kit of the invention comprises the container described above. In other embodiments, the kit of the invention comprises the container described above and a second container comprising a buffer. It may further include other materials desirable from a commercial and user standpoint, including other buffers, diluents, filters, needles, syringes, and package inserts with instructions for performing any methods described herein (such as methods for treating Alzheimer's disease, and methods for inhibiting or reducing accumulation of Aβ peptide in the brain). In kits to be used for detecting or purifying Aβ or βAPP, the antibody is typically labeled with a detectable marker, such as, for example, a radioisotope, fluorescent compound, bioluminescent compound, a chemiluminescent compound, metal chelator or enzyme.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following examples are presented to illustrate the present invention and to assist one of ordinary skill in making and using the same. The examples are not intended in any way to otherwise limit the scope of the invention.\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\nProduction and Characterization of Monoclonal Antibodies Directed Against Aβ\n\n\n \n \n \nThe data presented in this example show that high-affinity, specific antibodies directed against Aβ can be generated and provide useful therapeutic agents for targeting Aβ-associated disease. Mice were immunized with 50-100 μg of Aβ\n1-40 \npeptide in Ribi adjuvant (50 μl per footpad, 100 μl total per mouse) at 10 consecutive weekly intervals as described in Geerligs H J et al., 1989, J. Immunol. Methods 124:95-102; Kenney J S et al., 1989, J. Immunol. Methods 121:157-166; and Wicher K et al., 1989, Int. Arch. Allergy Appl. Immunol. 89:128-135.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSplenocytes were obtained from the immunized mouse and fused with NSO myeloma cells at a ratio of 10:1, with polyethylene glycol 1500. The hybrids were plated out into 96-well plates in DMEM containing 20% horse serum and 2-oxaloacetate/pyruvate/insulin (Sigma), and hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine selection was begun. On \n \nday\n \n 8, 100 μl of DMEM containing 20% horse serum was added to all the wells. Supernatants of the hybrids were screened by using antibody capture immunoassay. Determination of antibody class was done with class-specific second antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA panel of monoclonal antibody-producing cell lines was selected for characterization. These cell lines and information describing the corresponding antibodies are listed in Table 2.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonoclonal Antibody Characterization\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMonoclonal\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntigen\n\n\nProducing\n\n\n \n\n\nELISA\n\n\nAffinity\n\n\nCross\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAβ\n\n\nCell Line\n\n\nIsotype\n\n\nEpitope\n\n\nDirect\n\n\nCapture\n\n\nKd (nM)\n\n\n \nReactivity\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2286\n\n\n8A1.2A1\n\n\nIgG1\n\n\nAβ 28-40\n\n\nyes\n\n\nyes\n\n\n2.7\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2287\n\n\n11A4.1E5\n\n\nIgG2a\n\n\nAβ 16-28\n\n\nyes\n\n\nyes\n\n\n59\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2288\n\n\n23E9.1A1\n\n\nIgG2b\n\n\nAβ 1-16\n\n\nyes\n\n\nyes\n\n\n \nND\n \n \nNo\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2289\n\n\n3C6.1F9\n\n\nIgG2b\n\n\nAβ 16-28\n\n\nyes\n\n\nyes\n\n\n2.9\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2290\n\n\n14E10.1F3\n\n\nIgG2a\n\n\nAβ 16-28\n\n\nyes\n\n\nyes\n\n\n9.2\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2294\n\n\n13E11.1A12\n\n\nIgG2b\n\n\nAβ 28-40\n\n\nyes\n\n\nyes\n\n\n38\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2324\n\n\n10B10.2E6\n\n\nIgG2b\n\n\nAβ 1-16\n\n\nyes\n\n\nND\n\n\n0.9\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBinding to Aβ from various sources, and to β-APP and a control peptide were tested in a sandwich assay. The Aβ peptides tested were: β-amyloid peptide 1-42 and 1-40, both obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, Calif.), and β-amyloid peptide 1-43 obtained from Bachem (Torrance, Calif.). Peptide was immobilized onto plates, antibody added, and binding was detected using GAMIgG(Fc)HRP and reading absorbance at 490 nm. Cross-reactivity data, shown in \nFIG. 1\n, confirm that mAbs directed against Aβ do not cross-react with β-APP.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA capture assay was performed to confirm that the antibodies are capable of capturing soluble Aβ peptide. In this assay, Aβ peptide was immobilized onto assay plates, mAb was added either directly or following preincubation with 10 μg/ml Aβ, and binding was detected using GAMIgG(Fc)HRP and reading absorbance at 490 nm Controls were mouse anti-βAPP and 6E10, a monoclonal antibody that detects amino acid residues 1-17 of human β-amyloid peptide (Signet, Dedham, Mass.). Data demonstrating capture of soluble Aβ are shown in \nFIG. 2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCandidate therapeutic antibodies can be assayed ex vivo for their ability to effectively reduce plaque burden in the central nervous system in vivo as described in Bard et al., 2000, Nature Medicine 6(8):916-919.\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\nCharacterization of Epitope on Aβ Polypeptide that Antibodies Directed Against Aβ Bind\n\n\n \n \n \nTo determine the epitope on Aβ polypeptide that is recognized by the monoclonal antibodies, Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR, Biacore 3000) binding analysis was used. Aβ\n1-40 \npolypeptide (SEQ ID NO:1) coupled to biotin (Global Peptide Services, CO) was immobilized on a streptavidin-coated chip. The binding of Aβ antibodies (at 100 nM) to the immobilized Aβ\n1-40 \nin the absence or presence of different soluble fragments of the Aβ peptide (at 1000 nM, from American Peptide Company Inc., CA). The Aβ peptides which are requited to displace binding of \n \nmonoclonal antibodies\n \n 2324, 2289, and 2286 (more precisely antibodies as isolated from their respective hybridoma cell lines 10B10.2E6, 3C6.1F9, and 8A1.2A1) to Aβ\n1-40 \nwere Aβ\n1-16\n, Aβ\n1-28\n, and Aβ\n1-40\n, respectively (\nFIG. 3\n). Binding of all three antibodies to Aβ\n1-40 \nwas inhibited by soluble Aβ\n1-40\n. However, the Aβ\n1-38 \npeptide inhibited the binding of Aβ\n1-40 \nto \n \nMAbs\n \n 2324 and 2289, but not to \nMAb\n 2286, suggesting that the epitope that \nMAb\n 2286 binds includes amino acids 39 and/or 40 of the Aβ\n1-40 \npeptide (\nFIG. 3\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, Aβ\n1-42 \nand Aβ\n1-43 \npeptide did not inhibit binding of \nMAb\n 2286 to Aβ\n1-40 \nalthough they could readily inhibit Aβ\n1-40 \nbinding to both \nMAbs\n 2324 and 2289 (\nFIG. 3\n). These results show that \nMAb\n 2286 preferentially binds to Aβ\n1-40\n, but not to Aβ\n1-42 \nand Aβ\n1-43\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo further assess the involvement of discrete amino acid residues of the β-amyloid peptide in the binding of Mab 2286, different Aβ\n1-40 \nvariants, in which each of the last 5 amino acids (Aβ\n1-40 \namino acid residues 36-40) was individually replaced by an alanine (alanine scanning mutagenesis), were generated by site directed mutagenesis. These Aβ\n1-40 \nvariants (sequences shown in Table 6) were expressed in \nE. coli \nas Gluththione-S-Transferase (GST) fusion proteins (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, N.J. USA) followed by affinity purification on a Glutathione-Agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, Mo., USA). As control, Wild-type (WT) Aβ\n1-40 \n(SEQ ID NO:1) as well as Aβ\n1-41 \n(SEQ ID NO:13) were also expressed as GST fusion proteins. Aβ\n1-40\n, Aβ\n1-41 \nas well as the five different variants (SEQ ID NOS:14-18) were then immobilized (0.25 μg per well each) onto assay plates and incubated with either Mab 2286 or Mab 2324 (directed to an epitope of Aβ\n1-40 \nbetween amino acid 28-40 or 1-16, respectively; each antibody at 2 nM). After 10 consecutive washes, assay plates were incubated with a Biotin-conjugated Goat-anti-Mouse (H+L) antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burllingame Calif., USA) followed by an HRP-conjugated Streptavidin (Amersham Biosciences Corp., NJ, USA). The absorbance of the plate was read at 450 nm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFIG. 8\n, Mab 2324 which was directed to a N terminal epitope of Aβ, recognized all variants with the same intensity and served as internal positive control of protein concentration and protein integrity on the plate. \nMab\n 2286 did not recognize Aβ\n1-41 \n(or Aβ\n1-42 \nas shown in \nFIG. 3\n) while mutation to Ala of the C-terminal V40 did not affect binding, suggesting that the amino carboxy terminal moiety of the protein might be directly involved in \nMab\n 2286 epitope while the side chain of V40 might be less important. Aβ\n1-40 \nvariants V39A, G38A, G37A and V36A showed reduced binding to Mab 2286, demonstrating that \nMab\n 2286 epitope extended for at least 5 amino acids at the C terminal end of Aβ\n1-40\n. Mutations of V and G to A are very conservative and are not likely to produce important conformational changes in proteins, therefore, the large effect of these mutations to \nMab\n 2286 binding might be due to the ability of the antibody to differentiate between the mentioned amino acids in the context of Aβ and these data demonstrated a very high degree of specificity for this antibody.\n\n\n \nExample 3\n\n\nProduction and Characterization of Monoclonal Antibodies Directed Against βAPP\n\n\n \n \n \nMice were immunized with APP as described in Example 1.

Surprisingly, these data show that antibodies directed at the C terminus (i.e. aa 28-40) of Aβ were just as effective at clearing Aβ, thioflavine-S, and increasing MHC-II staining as antibodies directed at the N terminus (aa 1-16) in this mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Because antibodies targeting the N terminus of Aβ are likely advantageous due to increased ability to recognize the precursor and/or disrupt aggregation of amyloid deposits, these results provide a promising new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo evaluate the therapeutic effects of anti Aβ antibodies in vivo, \n \n \nmonoclonal antibodies\n \n \n 2324, 2286, and 2289, more precisely, antibodies as isolated from their respective hybridoma cell lines 10B10.2E6, 8A1.2A1, and 3C6.1F9, were injected to transgenic mice over-expressing the ‘Swedish’ mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP; Tg2576; K670N/M671L; Hsiao et al., 1996, Science 274:99-102). The Alzheimer's-like phenotype present in these mice has been well-characterized (Holcomb L A et al., 1998, Nat. Med. 4:97-100; Holcomb L A et al., 1999, Behav. Gen. 29:177-185; and McGowan E, 1999, Neurobiol. Dis. 6:231-244).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn terms of the experimental procedure followed, which is not necessary for describing or enabling the invention, antibodies were injected intracranially to Tg2576 transgenic mice of 16 months of age. Injected antibodies were monoclonal antibodies 2324 (at 1.2 μg in a volume of 2 μl), 2286 (at 2 μg in a volume of 2 μl) and 2289 (at 2 μg in a volume of 2 μl) and a control monoclonal antibody directed against a \nDrosophila \nprotein termed “Amnesiac” (at 2 μg in a volume of 2 μl), more precisely, antibodies as isolated from their respective hybridoma cell lines 10B10.2E6, 8A1.2A1, and 3C6.1F9, were injected intracranially. Histopathology of the mice frontal cortex and hippocampus were evaluated at 3 days after injection. Three-day time point was chosen from time course work with another antibody indicating that the amyloid clearance was complete by that interval and the microglial activation was maximal compared to 1 day or 7 days. Data were presented as the ratio of injected side to non-injected side for Aβ, thioflavine-S and MHC-II staining.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough the three antibodies used in the study are directed to different parts of the Aβ peptide (amino acids 1-16, 16-28, and 28-40 respectively), all removed both Aβ deposits and thioflavine-S deposits (the latter detects the toxic fibrillar form of Aβ deposits) in hippocampus and cortex by a considerable percentage (\nFIG. 4\n, by 40-80%) compared with control groups (anti-amnesiac antibody and vehicle injected groups). They also activated microglia, as evaluated by MHC-II staining (\nFIG. 4\n). There was no consistent difference between the three Aβ antibodies in their capacity to remove Aβ, thioflavine-S, or increase MHC-II staining in these mice. These results were unexpected given the previously published studies that indicated that N terminally (i.e. aa 1-16)- but not C terminally (i.e. aa 28-40)-directed antibodies were important for AB deposit clearance. (Solomon, B. et al., 1996, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:452-455; Solomon, B. et al., 1997, Proc. Nad. Acad. Sci. USA 94:4109-4112.)\n\n\n \nExample 6\n\n\nPotential Role of the Fc Domain of \nAntibody\n 2286 in Microglial Activation and Amyloid Clearance\n\n\n \n \n \nTo investigate the potential role of the Fc domain of \nanti-Aβ antibody\n 2286 in microglial activation and amyloid clearance, the effect of F\n(ab)2 \nfragments of \nantibody\n 2286, the intact antibody, and a control monoclonal antibody directed against the \ndrosophila \nprotein amnesiac in microglial activation and amyloid clearance were compared in an animal model described in Example 6, where antibody is administered intracranially.\n\n\n \nPreparation of F\n(ab′)2 \nFragments:\n\n\n \n \n \nF\n(ab′)2 \nfragments from anti-Aβ \nmonoclonal antibody\n 2286, and a control monoclonal antibody directed against the \ndrosophila \nprotein amnesiac were prepared using the Immunopure IgG1 F\nab \nand F\n(ab′)2 \npreparation kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, Ill.). The instructions provided with the kit were followed. Briefly, 0.5 ml of 1 mg/ml IgG was added to 0.5 ml mouse IgG1 mild elution buffer. This was applied to an equilibrated immobilized ficin column, allowed to enter the column and digested at 37° C. for 20 hours. A 4 ml elution was obtained and applied to an equilibrated immobilized protein A column for separation of the F\n(ab′)2 \nfrom Fc fragments and undigested IgG. Four 1 ml fractions of product were obtained. As determined by running a gel electrophoresis only the 2\nnd \nand 3\nnd \nelutions were found to contain F\n(ab′)2 \nfragments and appeared of similar intensities on the gel. The two elutions containing F\n(ab′)2 \nfragments were pooled and concentrated using Centricon centrifugal filter devices (Millipore Corp. Bedford, Mass.) to a volume of approximately 200 μl. Preliminary experiments found that injections of the F\n(ab′)2 \nfractions concentrated directly from the column caused seizures when injected into some mice. Thus the initial concentrate was diluted in 4 ml of fresh PBS and reconcentrated to dilute residual proprietary elution buffer components which may cause seizures. No seizures or neurotoxicity were found in the mice included here. The concentrated product was run on an SDS-polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). A Bradford assay was also performed to establish concentrations of the F\n(ab′)2 \nfragments using Bradford protein assay reagent concentrate (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nF\n(ab′)2 \nfragments prepared from anti-Aβ \nmonoclonal antibody\n 2286, and a control monoclonal antibody directed against the \ndrosophila \nprotein amnesiac were analyzed via SDS-polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis (PAGE). The gel showed very pure product with no contamination by undigested IgG or Fc fragments, with a single band at approximately 105 kDa, the molecular weight for F\n(ab′)2 \nfragments. The intact IgG molecule produced one intense band at approximately 150 kDa, the correct molecular weight for IgG molecules and a less intense band at approximately 110 kDa. Following confirmation of purity via SDS-PAGE we then performed a Bradford assay to assess the recovery of F\n(ab′)2 \nin the purified fraction. Because we dissolved the anti-Aβ F\n(ab′)2 \nfragments in a smaller volume than was used for the starting material the concentration of F\n(ab′)2 \nfragments injected intracranially was 1.2 μg/μl, while the holoantibody concentration was 1 μg/μl, resulting in an excess of anti-Aβ Fv domains in the F\n(ab′)2 \nsolutions.\n\n\n \nAntibody Fractions Study\n\n\n \n \n \nTwenty Tg2576 APP transgenic mice aged 19.5 months were assigned to one of four groups, all groups received intracranial injections into the frontal cortex and hippocampus. The first group received \nanti-Aβ antibody\n 2286 at a concentration of 2 μg/2 μl in each region. The second group received anti-Aβ F\n(ab′)2 \nfragments prepared from the \nanti-Aβ antibody\n 2286 at 2.2 μg/2 μl in each region. The third group received IgG directed against \ndrosophila \namnesiac protein as a control for nonspecific aspects of intact IgG injection. The final group received control F\n(ab′)2 \nfragments prepared from the IgG directed against \ndrosophila \namnesiac protein to control for nonspecific effects of F\n(ab′)2 \ninjection. All mice survived for 72 hours after surgery.\n\n\n \nSurgical Procedure:\n\n\n \n \n \nOn the day of surgery the mice were weighed, anesthetized with isoflurane and placed in a stereotaxic apparatus (51603 dual manipulator lab standard, Stoelting, Wood Dale, Ill.). A midsagittal incision was made to expose the cranium and two burr holes were drilled using a dental drill over the right frontal cortex and hippocampus to the following coordinates: Cortex: AP +1.5 mm, L −2.0 mm, hippocampus: AP −2.7 mm, L −2.5 mm, all taken from bregma. A 26 gauge needle attached to a 10 μl Hamilton (Reno, Nev.) syringe was lowered 3 mm ventral to bregma and a 2 μl injection was made over a 2 minute period. The incision was cleaned with saline and closed with surgical staples.\n\n\n \nTissue Preparation:\n\n\n \n \n \nOn the day of sacrifice mice were weighed, overdosed with 100 mg/kg pentobarbital (Nembutal sodium solution, Abbott laboratories, North Chicago Ill.) and intracardially perfused with 25 ml 0.9% sodium chloride followed by 50 ml freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde (pH=7.4). Brains were rapidly removed and immersion fixed for 24 hours in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde. The brains were then incubated for 24 hours in 10, 20 and 30% sucrose sequentially to cyroprotect them. Horizontal sections of 25 μm thickness were then collected using a sliding microtome and stored at 4° C. in DPBS buffer with sodium azide to prevent microbial growth.\n\n\n \nImmunohistochemical Methods:\n\n\n \n \n \nSix to eight sections approximately 100 μm apart were selected spanning the injection site and stained using free-floating immunohistochemistry methods for total Aβ (rabbit antiserum primarily reacting with the N-terminal of the Aβ peptide 1:10000) and CD45 (Serotec, Raleigh N.C., 1:3000) as previously described (Gordon et al., 2002). For immunostaining, some sections were omitted from the primary antibody to assess non-specific immunohistochemical reactions. Adjacent sections were mounted on slides and stained using 4% thioflavine-S (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis Mo.) for 10 minutes. It should be noted that there were a limited number of sections that include the injection volume. The procedure followed was to measure a few markers reliably rather than a larger number of markers with fewer sections each.\n\n\n \nData Analysis:\n\n\n \n \n \nThe immunohistochemical reaction product on all stained sections was measured using a videometric V150 image analysis system (Oncor, San Diego, Calif.) in the injected area of cortex and hippocampus and corresponding regions on the contralateral side of the brain. Data were presented as the ratio of injected side to non-injected side for Aβ, thioflavine-S and CD45. Normalizing each injection site to the corresponding contralateral site diminishes the influence of interanimal variability and permits reliable measurements of drug effects with a smaller number of mice. To assess possible treatment-related differences, the ratio values for each treatment group were analyzed by ANOVA using StatView software version 5.0.1 (SAS Institute Inc., NC) followed by Fischer's LSD means comparisons.\n\n\n \nResults:\n\n\n \n \n \nThe only antibody which activated microglia 72 hours following intracranial injection into frontal cortex and hippocampus was the intact \nanti-Aβ antibody\n 2286. The frontal cortex showed a greater degree of activation than the hippocampus, however, in both regions the activation was significantly greater than that in the groups receiving control anti-amnesiac protein IgG, F\n(ab′)2 \nor anti-Aβ 2286 F\n(ab′)2 \n(\nFIGS. 5A\n, C and D, \nFIG. 6A\n; P<0.01 or greater in all comparisons). The pattern of activation in the hippocampus following the \nanti-Aβ antibody\n 2286 injection resembled the pattern when using the anti-Aβ antibody 44-352, a monoclonal antibody that binds to beta-amyloid amino acids 1-16 (Biosource, Camarillo, Calif.). There was a very intense area of activation in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus, with a much more diffuse activation filling the remainder of the dentate gyrus (\nFIG. 5A\n). Interestingly, the anti-Aβ F\n(ab′)2 \nfragments produced no microglial activation in both the frontal cortex and hippocampus (\nFIG. 5B\n, \nFIG. 6A\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAβ immunohistochemistry in the two anti-amnesiac protein control groups showed the typical staining pattern observed in APP transgenic mice 19.5 months (\nFIGS. 5G\n and H). This pattern was qualitatively the same as observed at 16 months, although quantitatively greater as the mice were 3.5 months older. Both the anti-Aβ antibody and the anti-Aβ F\n(ab′)2 \ngroups significantly reduced total Aβ immunohistochemistry to a similar extent 72 hours following injection into frontal cortex and hippocampus. In the frontal cortex there was a reduction of approximately 60% (\nFIG. 6B\n). In the hippocampus the reduction was approximately 65% (\nFIGS. 5E\n and F, \nFIG. 6B\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThioflavine-S staining detects only compact fibrillar amyloid deposits. The mice receiving intracranial injections of either control anti-amnesiac protein IgG or control F\n(ab′)2 \nresembled the typical staining observed in the APP transgenic mouse at this age. In the hippocampus the majority of thioflavine-S positive plaques were located in the outer molecular layer of Ammon's horn and the dentate gyrus near the hippocampal fissure (\nFIGS. 5K\n and L). Anti-Aβ antibody IgG significantly reduced thioflavine-S positive compact plaque by approximately 90% in the frontal cortex and hippocampus (\nFIG. 6C\n). There were no, or very few, remaining thioflavine-S positive deposits in the hippocampus (\nFIG. 5I\n). In contrast, the anti-Aβ F\n(ab′)2 \nfragments did not remove compact amyloid plaques as effectively as the whole IgG molecule. In the frontal cortex there was no significant reduction in thioflavine-S staining when compared to either control antibody group (\nFIG. 6C\n). In the hippocampus there was a significant difference between the anti-Aβ F\n(ab′)2 \ngroup and the control groups (P<0.05), however, this reduction was also significantly less than the reduction observed with the whole IgG molecule (\nFIG. 5J\n, \nFIG. 6C\n; P<0.02 or greater).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs expected, when CD45 and thioflavine-S values for all groups receiving anti-Aβ IgG or anti-Aβ F\n(ab′)2\n, regardless of subsequent treatments, were compared in a single large regression analysis, there was a significant correlation between increasing levels of microglial activation as detected by CD45 immunohistochemistry and compact plaque removal as detected by thioflavine-S staining in the frontal cortex when log transformed CD45 values were used (P<0.001, R=0.57). This correlation was also observed in the hippocampus (P<0.02, R=0-427).\n\n\n \nExample 7\n\n\nIncreased Serum Aβ Concentration Following Peripheral Injection of \nAntibody\n 2286\n\n\n \n \n \nThis experiment was performed to test the efficacy of \nmonoclonal antibody\n 2286 following systemic passive immunization of a transgenic mouse model for Alzheimer's disease. Tg2576 transgenic mice (Hsiao et al., 1996, Science 274:99-102) that were 19 months of age were injected intraperitoneally (IP) with either \nmonoclonal antibody\n 2286 or an anti-amnesiac antibody (IgG1 control). Antibodies were injected once every week at a dose of 10 mg per Kg of body weight for periods of one, two or three months after which both Aβ serum concentrations as well as titers of anti-Aβ antibodies in the serum were measured.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSerum concentrations of Aβ were determined by using a capture assay, in which an anti-Aβ antibody (Clone 6E10, Signet Laboratories Inc., Dedham, Mass.) was immobilized onto assay plates and incubated with diluted serum samples derived from the treated mice. After 10 consecutive washes, assay plates were incubated with a second Biotin-conjugated anti-Aβ antibody (Clone 4G8, Signet Laboratories Inc., Dedham Mass., USA) followed by addition of an HRP-conjugated Streptavidin (Amersham Biosciences Corp., NJ, USA). The absorbance at 450 nm of the assay plates was determined and concentrations of Aβ in the serum samples were determined by normalizing with known concentrations of synthetic Aβ1-40 (American Peptide Company Inc., Sunnyvale Calif., USA) as standards. To measure 2286 antibody titers in the serum samples, antibody-Aβ complexes were dissociated by low pH and were incubated with assay plates that were pre-coated with synthetic Aβ\n1-40 \n(0.25 μg per well each). After 10 consecutive washes, assay plates were incubated with a Biotin-conjugated Goat-anti-Mouse (H+L) antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burllingame Calif., USA) followed by an HRP-conjugated Streptavidin (Amersham Biosciences Corp., NJ, USA), and absorbances at 450 nm were measured. Concentrations of anti-Aβ antibodies were calculated from a standard curve that was generated by performing the same assay with known concentration of affinity purified 2286.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFIG. 7\n, rapid increase in serum Aβ concentration was observed following peripheral administration of 2286 but not anti-amnesiac antibodies to Tg2576 mice. Titers of anti-Aβ antibody in serum samples showed significant positive correlation between antibody concentration in serum and serum Aβ concentration in treated transgenic mice (r\n2\n=0.5125, F=26.28, P<0.0001, data analyzed by INSTAT PRISM v. 4, GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, Calif.). These data suggest that monoclonal antibody. 2286 may have changed Aβ equilibrium between CNS and plasma, and administration of \nmonoclonal antibody\n 2286 may facilitate clearance of Aβ out of the CNS. To test this possibility, brain amyloid burden would be measured to determine whether an increase of Aβ concentration in serum correlates with a decrease of brain amyloid burden in treated mice.\n\n\n

Description\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present application is a continuation of Ser. No. 11/836,318, filed Aug. 9, 2007, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/837,197, filed Aug. 11, 2006, which is incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates generally to IL-17A specific binding compounds, such as antibodies, and uses thereof. More specifically, the invention relates to chimeric and humanized antibodies that recognize human IL-17A and modulate its activity, particularly in inflammatory, autoimmune and proliferative disorders.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe immune system functions to protect individuals from infective agents, e.g., bacteria, multi-cellular organisms, and viruses, as well as from cancers. This system includes several types of lymphoid and myeloid cells such as monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), eosinophils, T cells, B cells, and neutrophils. These lymphoid and myeloid cells often produce signaling proteins known as cytokines. The immune response includes inflammation, i.e., the accumulation of immune cells systemically or in a particular location of the body. In response to an infective agent or foreign substance, immune cells secrete cytokines which, in turn, modulate immune cell proliferation, development, differentiation, or migration. Immune response can produce pathological consequences, e.g., when it involves excessive inflammation, as in the autoimmune disorders (see, e.g., Abbas et al. (eds.) (2000) \nCellular and Molecular Immunology\n, W.B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, Pa.; Oppenheim and Feldmann (eds.) (2001) \nCytokine Reference, \nAcademic Press, San Diego, Calif.; von Andrian and Mackay (2000) \nNew Engl. J. Med. \n343:1020-1034; Davidson and Diamond (2001) \nNew Engl. J. Med. \n345:340-350).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInterleukin-17A (IL-17A; also known as Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-associated Antigen 8 (CTLA8), IL-17) is a homodimeric cytokine produced by memory T cells following antigen recognition. The development of such T cells is promoted by interleukin-23 (IL-23). McKenzie et al. (2006) \nTrends Immunol. \n27(1):17-23; Langrish et al. (2005) \nJ. Exp. Med. \n201(2):233-40. IL-17A acts through two receptors, IL-17RA and IL-17RC to induce the production of numerous molecules involved in neutrophil biology, inflammation, and organ destruction. This cytokine synergizes with tissue necrosis factor (TNF) and or interleukin 1β (IL-1β) to promote a greater pro-inflammatory environment. Antagonizing the activity of IL-17A with antibodies or antigen binding fragments of antibodies has been proposed for the treatment of a variety of inflammatory, immune and proliferative disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis osteoporosis, inflammatory fibrosis (e.g. scleroderma, lung fibrosis, and cirrhosis), gingivitis, periodontitis or other inflammatory periodontal diseases, inflammatory bowel disorders (e.g. Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and inflammatory bowel disease), asthma (including allergic asthma), allergies, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), multiple sclerosis, psoriasis and cancer. (See, e.g., US 2003/0166862, WO 2005/108616, WO 2005/051422, and WO 2006/013107).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe most significant limitation in using antibodies as a therapeutic agent in vivo is the immunogenicity of the antibodies. As most monoclonal antibodies are derived from rodents, repeated use in humans results in the generation of an immune response against the therapeutic antibody, e.g., human against mouse antibodies or HAMA. Such an immune response results in a loss of therapeutic efficacy at a minimum and a potential fatal anaphylactic response at a maximum. Initial efforts to reduce the immunogenicity of rodent antibodies involved the production of chimeric antibodies, in which mouse variable regions (Fv) were fused with human constant regions. Liu et al. (1987) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n84:3439-43. However, mice injected with hybrids of human variable regions and mouse constant regions develop a strong anti-antibody response directed against the human variable region, suggesting that the retention of the entire rodent Fv region in such chimeric antibodies may still result in unwanted immunogenicity in patients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is generally believed that complementarity determining region (CDR) loops of variable domains comprise the binding site of antibody molecules. Therefore, the grafting of rodent CDR loops onto human frameworks (i.e., humanization) has been attempted to further minimize rodent sequences. Jones et al. (1986) \nNature \n321:522; Verhoeyen et al. (1988) \nScience \n239:1534. However, CDR loop exchanges still do not uniformly result in an antibody with the same binding properties as the antibody of origin. Changes in framework residues (FR), residues involved in CDR loop support, in humanized antibodies also are often required to preserve antigen binding affinity. Kabat et al. (1991) \nJ. Immunol. \n147:1709. While the use of CDR grafting and framework residue preservation in a number of humanized antibody constructs has been reported, it is difficult to predict if a particular sequence will result in the antibody with the desired binding, and sometimes biological, properties. See, e.g., Queen et al. (1989) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n86:10029, Gorman et al. (1991) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n88:4181, and Hodgson (1991) \nBiotechnology \n(NY) 9:421-5. Moreover, most prior studies used different human sequences for animal light and heavy variable sequences, rendering the predictive nature of such studies questionable. Sequences of known antibodies have been used or, more typically, those of antibodies having known X-ray crystal structures, such as antibodies NEW and KOL. See, e.g., Jones et al., supra; Verhoeyen et al., supra; and Gorman et al., supra. Exact sequence information has been reported for a few humanized constructs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe need exists for antagonists of IL-17A, such as anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibodies, for use in treatment of human disorders, such as inflammatory, autoimmune, and proliferative disorders. Such antagonists will preferably exhibit low immunogenicity in human subjects, allowing for repeated administration without adverse immune responses.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to anti-human IL-17A antibodies having one or more desirable properties, including high binding affinities, neutralizing activities, good pharmacokinetics and low antigenicity in human subjects.

Definitions\n\n\n \n \n \nSo that the invention may be more readily understood, certain technical and scientific terms are specifically defined below. Unless specifically defined elsewhere in this document, all other technical and scientific terms used herein have the meaning commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, including the appended claims, the singular forms of words such as “a,” “an,” and “the,” include their corresponding plural references unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Activation,” “stimulation,” and “treatment,” as it applies to cells or to receptors, may have the same meaning, e.g., activation, stimulation, or treatment of a cell or receptor with a ligand, unless indicated otherwise by the context or explicitly. “Ligand” encompasses natural and synthetic ligands, e.g., cytokines, cytokine variants, analogues, muteins, and binding compounds derived from antibodies. “Ligand” also encompasses small molecules, e.g., peptide mimetics of cytokines and peptide mimetics of antibodies. “Activation” can refer to cell activation as regulated by internal mechanisms as well as by external or environmental factors. “Response,” e.g., of a cell, tissue, organ, or organism, encompasses a change in biochemical or physiological behavior, e.g., concentration, density, adhesion, or migration within a biological compartment, rate of gene expression, or state of differentiation, where the change is correlated with activation, stimulation, or treatment, or with internal mechanisms such as genetic programming.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Activity” of a molecule may describe or refer to the binding of the molecule to a ligand or to a receptor, to catalytic activity; to the ability to stimulate gene expression or cell signaling, differentiation, or maturation; to antigenic activity, to the modulation of activities of other molecules, and the like. “Activity” of a molecule may also refer to activity in modulating or maintaining cell-to-cell interactions, e.g., adhesion, or activity in maintaining a structure of a cell, e.g., cell membranes or cytoskeleton. “Activity” can also mean specific activity, e.g., [catalytic activity]/[mg protein], or [immunological activity]/[mg protein], concentration in a biological compartment, or the like. “Activity” may refer to modulation of components of the innate or the adaptive immune systems. “Proliferative activity” encompasses an activity that promotes, that is necessary for, or that is specifically associated with, e.g., normal cell division, as well as cancer, tumors, dysplasia, cell transformation, metastasis, and angiogenesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Administration” and “treatment,” as it applies to an animal, human, experimental subject, cell, tissue, organ, or biological fluid, refers to contact of an exogenous pharmaceutical, therapeutic, diagnostic agent, or composition to the animal, human, subject, cell, tissue, organ, or biological fluid. “Administration” and “treatment” can refer, e.g., to therapeutic, pharmacokinetic, diagnostic, research, and experimental methods. Treatment of a cell encompasses contact of a reagent to the cell, as well as contact of a reagent to a fluid, where the fluid is in contact with the cell. “Administration” and “treatment” also means in vitro and ex vivo treatments, e.g., of a cell, by a reagent, diagnostic, binding compound, or by another cell. “Treatment,” as it applies to a human, veterinary, or research subject, refers to therapeutic treatment, prophylactic or preventative measures, to research and diagnostic applications. “Treatment” as it applies to a human, veterinary, or research subject, or cell, tissue, or organ, encompasses contact of an IL-17A agonist or IL-17A antagonist to a human or animal subject, a cell, tissue, physiological compartment, or physiological fluid. “Treatment of a cell” also encompasses situations where the IL-17A agonist or IL-17A antagonist contacts IL-17A receptor, e.g., in the fluid phase or colloidal phase, but also situations where the agonist or antagonist does not contact the cell or the receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Treat” or “treating” means to administer a therapeutic agent, such as a composition containing any of the binding compounds of the present invention, internally or externally to a patient having one or more disease symptoms for which the agent has known therapeutic activity. Typically, the agent is administered in an amount effective to alleviate one or more disease symptoms in the treated patient or population, whether by inducing the regression of or inhibiting the progression of such symptom(s) by any clinically measurable degree. The amount of a therapeutic agent that is effective to alleviate any particular disease symptom (also referred to as the “therapeutically effective amount”) may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, and weight of the patient, and the ability of the drug to elicit a desired response in the patient. Whether a disease symptom has been alleviated can be assessed by any clinical measurement typically used by physicians or other skilled healthcare providers to assess the severity or progression status of that symptom. While an embodiment of the present invention (e.g., a treatment method or article of manufacture) may not be effective in alleviating the target disease symptom(s) in every patient, it should alleviate the target disease symptom(s) in a statistically significant number of patients as determined by any statistical test known in the art such as the Student's t-test, the chi\n2\n-test, the U-test according to Mann and Whitney, the Kruskal-Wallis test (H-test), Jonckheere-Terpstra-test and the Wilcoxon-test.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFour variants of human IL-17A protein are referred to herein. i) As used herein, the terms “human IL-17A” and “native human IL-17A” (“huIL-17A” and “humIL-17A”) refer to the mature forms (i.e. residues 24-155) of human IL-17A protein accession numbers NP\n—\n002181 and AAT22064, and naturally occurring variants and polymorphisms thereof. ii) As used herein, the term “rhIL-17A” refers to a recombinant derivative of native human IL-17A in which two additional amino acids (LE) are appended at the N-terminus of the mature form of native human IL-17A. This nomenclature is adopted for convenience in referring to various forms of IL-17A, and may not match usage in the literature. iii) As used herein, the term “FLAG-huIL-17A” refers to a variant of native human IL-17A having an N-terminal FLAG® peptide tag appended. In some experiments the FLAG-huIL-17A is biotinylated. iv) R&D Systems human IL-17A referred to herein is residues 20-155 of human IL-17A protein accession numbers NP\n—\n002181 and AAT22064, with an additional N-terminal methionine. Table 1 is a summary of the variant N-termini of the IL-17A molecules referenced herein.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariant Forms of Human IL-17A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIL-17A Variant\n\n\nSequence (N→C)\n\n\nSEQ ID NO.:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nhuIL-17A \n\n\n         GITIPRN . . . VHHVA\n\n\n40\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(native)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nrhIL-17A\n\n\n       \nLE\nGITIPRN . . . VHHVA\n\n\n41\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFLAG-huIL-17A\n\n\n \nDYKDDDDKL\nGITIPRN . . . VHHVA\n\n\n42\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nR & D IL-17A\n\n\n    \nMIVKA\nGITIPRN . . . VHHVA\n\n\n43\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnless otherwise noted, any IL-17A used in the experiments described herein that is produced using adenoviral vectors is rhIL-17A. The term “IL-17A” refers to generally to human IL-17A, native or recombinant, and non-human homologs of human IL-17A. Unless otherwise indicated, molar concentrations of IL-17A are calculated using the molecular weight of a homodimer of IL-17A (e.g., 30 kDa for human IL-17A).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “antibody” refers to any form of antibody that exhibits the desired biological activity. Thus, it is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers, but is not limited to, monoclonal antibodies (including full length monoclonal antibodies), polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies). As used herein, the terms “IL-17A binding fragment or “binding fragment” of an antibody (the “parental antibody”) encompass a fragment or a derivative of an antibody, typically including at least a portion of the antigen binding or variable regions (e.g. one or more CDRs) of the parental antibody, that retains at least some of the binding specificity of the parental antibody. Examples of antibody binding fragments include, but are not limited to, Fab, Fab′, F(ab′)\n2\n, and Fv fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies; single-chain antibody molecules, e.g., sc-Fv; and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. Typically, a binding fragment or derivative retains at least 10% of its IL-17A binding activity when that activity is expressed on a molar basis. Preferably, a binding fragment or derivative retains at least 20%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% or 100% or more of the IL-17A binding affinity as the parental antibody. It is also intended that an IL-17A binding fragment can include conservative amino acid substitutions (referred to as “conservative variants” of the antibody) that do not substantially alter its biologic activity. The term “binding compound” refers to both antibodies and binding fragments thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “Fab fragment” is comprised of one light chain and the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 and variable regions of one heavy chain. The heavy chain of a Fab molecule cannot form a disulfide bond with another heavy chain molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “Fc” region contains two heavy chain fragments comprising the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 and \nC\n \n \n \nH\n2 domains of an antibody. The two heavy chain fragments are held together by two or more disulfide bonds and by hydrophobic interactions of the CH3 domains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “Fab′ fragment” contains one light chain and a portion of one heavy chain that contains the V\nH \ndomain and the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 domain and also the region between the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 and \nC\n \n \n \nH\n2 domains, such that an interchain disulfide bond can be formed between the two heavy chains of two Fab′ fragments to form a F(ab′)\n2 \nmolecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “F(ab′)\n2 \nfragment” contains two light chains and two heavy chains containing a portion of the constant region between the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 and C\nH\n \n2 \ndomains, such that an interchain disulfide bond is formed between the two heavy chains. A F(ab′)\n2 \nfragment thus is composed of two Fab′ fragments that are held together by a disulfide bond between the two heavy chains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe “Fv region” comprises the variable regions from both the heavy and light chains, but lacks the constant regions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “single-chain Fv” or “scFv” antibody refers to antibody fragments comprising the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains of an antibody, wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. Generally, the Fv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains which enables the scFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of scFv, see Pluckthun (1994) T\nHE \nP\nHARMACOLOGY OF \nM\nONOCLONAL \nA\nNTIBODIES\n, vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds. Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315. See also, International Patent Application Publication No. WO 88/01649 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,946,778 and 5,260,203.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “domain antibody” is an immunologically functional immunoglobulin fragment containing only the variable region of a heavy chain or the variable region of a light chain. In some instances, two or more V\nH \nregions are covalently joined with a peptide linker to create a bivalent domain antibody. The two V\nH \nregions of a bivalent domain antibody may target the same or different antigens.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “bivalent antibody” comprises two antigen binding sites. In some instances, the two binding sites have the same antigen specificities. However, bivalent antibodies may be bispecific (see below).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, unless otherwise indicated, an “anti-IL-17A” antibody refers to an antibody that is raised against human IL-17A or a variant thereof, such as hull-17A, rhIL-17A, FLAG-huIL-17A and R&D IL-17A, or any antigenic fragment thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “monoclonal antibody”, as used herein, refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic epitope. In contrast, conventional (polyclonal) antibody preparations typically include a multitude of antibodies directed against (or specific for) different epitopes. The modifier “monoclonal” indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al. (1975) \nNature \n256: 495, or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567). The “monoclonal antibodies” may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al. (1991) \nNature \n352: 624-628 and Marks et al. (1991) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n222: 581-597, for example. See also Presta (2005) \nJ. Allergy Clin. Immunol. \n116:731.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include “chimeric” antibodies (immunoglobulins) in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and Morrison et al., (1984) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n81: 6851-6855).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, a “chimeric antibody” is an antibody having the variable domain from a first antibody and constant domain from a second antibody, where the first and second antibodies are from different species. Typically the variable domains are obtained from an antibody from an experimental animal (the “parental antibody”), such as a rodent, and the constant domain sequences are obtained from human antibodies, so that the resulting chimeric antibody will be less likely to elicit an adverse immune response in a human subject than the parental rodent antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe monoclonal antibodies herein also include camelized single domain antibodies. See, e.g., Muyldermans et al. (2001) \nTrends Biochem. Sci. \n26:230; Reichmann et al. (1999) \nJ. Immunol. Methods \n231:25; WO 94/04678; WO 94/25591; U.S. Pat. No. 6,005,079, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties). In one embodiment, the present invention provides single domain antibodies comprising two V\nH \ndomains with modifications such that single domain antibodies are formed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “diabodies” refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites, which fragments comprise a heavy chain variable domain (V\nH\n) connected to a light chain variable domain (V\nL\n) in the same polypeptide chain (V\nH\n-V\nL \nor V\nL\n-V\nH\n). By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain, the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen-binding sites. Diabodies are described more fully in, e.g., EP 404,097; WO 93/11161; and Holliger et al. (1993) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n90: 6444-6448. For a review of engineered antibody variants generally see Holliger and Hudson (2005) \nNat. Biotechnol. \n23:1126-1136.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “humanized antibody” refers to forms of antibodies that contain sequences from both human and non-human (e.g., murine, rat) antibodies. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin, and all or substantially all of the framework (FR) regions are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody may optionally comprise at least a portion of a human immunoglobulin constant region (Fc).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies of the present invention also include antibodies with modified (or blocked) Fc regions to provide altered effector functions. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,624,821; WO2003/086310; WO2005/120571; WO2006/0057702. Such modification can be used to enhance or suppress various reactions of the immune system, with possible beneficial effects in diagnosis and therapy. Alterations of the Fc region include amino acid changes (substitutions, deletions and insertions), glycosylation or deglycosylation, and adding multiple Fc. Changes to the Fc can also alter the half-life of antibodies in therapeutic antibodies, enabling less frequent dosing and thus increased convenience and decreased use of material. See Presta (2005) \nJ. Allergy Clin. Immunol. \n116:731 at 734-35.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “fully human antibody” refers to an antibody that comprises human immunoglobulin protein sequences only. A fully human antibody may contain murine carbohydrate chains if produced in a mouse, in a mouse cell, or in a hybridoma derived from a mouse cell. Similarly, “mouse antibody” refers to an antibody that comprises mouse immunoglobulin sequences only. Alternatively, a fully human antibody may contain rat carbohydrate chains if produced in a rat, in a rat cell, or in a hybridoma derived from a rat cell. Similarly, “rat antibody” refers to an antibody that comprises rat immunoglobulin sequences only.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “hypervariable region” refers to the amino acid residues of an antibody which are responsible for antigen-binding. The hypervariable region comprises amino acid residues from a “complementarity determining region” or “CDR” (i.e. residues 24-34 (CDRL1), 50-56 (CDRL2) and 89-97 (CDRL3) in the light chain variable domain and residues 31-35 (CDRH1), 50-65 (CDRH2) and 95-102 (CDRH3) in the heavy chain variable domain; Kabat et al. (1991) Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md.) and/or those residues from a “hypervariable loop” (i.e. residues 26-32 (CDRL1), 50-52 (CDRL2) and 91-96 (CDRL3) in the light chain variable domain and 26-32 (CDRH1), 53-55 (CDRH2) and 96-101 (CDRH3) in the heavy chain variable domain; Chothia and Lesk (1987) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n196: 901-917). As used herein, the term “framework” or “FR” residues refers to those variable domain residues other than the hypervariable region residues defined herein as CDR residues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Binding substance” refers to a molecule, small molecule, macromolecule, antibody, a fragment or analogue thereof, or soluble receptor, capable of binding to a target. “Binding substance” also may refer to a complex of molecules, e.g., a non-covalent complex, to an ionized molecule, and to a covalently or non-covalently modified molecule, e.g., modified by phosphorylation, acylation, cross-linking, cyclization, or limited cleavage, that is capable of binding to a target. “Binding substance” may also refer to a molecule capable of binding to a target in combination with a stabilizer, excipient, salt, buffer, solvent, or additive. “Binding” may be defined as an association of the binding substance with a target where the association results in reduction in the normal Brownian motion of the binding substance, in cases where the binding substance can be dissolved or suspended in solution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Conservatively modified variants” or “conservative substitution” refers to substitutions of amino acids in a protein with other amino acids having similar characteristics (e.g. charge, side-chain size, hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity, backbone conformation and rigidity, etc.), such that the changes can frequently be made without altering the biological activity of the protein. Those of skill in this art recognize that, in general, single amino acid substitutions in non-essential regions of a polypeptide do not substantially alter biological activity (see, e.g., Watson et al. (1987) \nMolecular Biology of the Gene\n, The Benjamin/Cummings Pub. Co., p. 224 (4th Ed.)). In addition, substitutions of structurally or functionally similar amino acids are less likely to disrupt biological activity. Various embodiments of the binding compounds of the present invention comprise polypeptide chains with sequences that include up to 0 (no changes), 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 20 or more conservative amino acid substitutions when compared with the specific amino acid sequences disclosed herein, e.g. SEQ ID NOs: 2, 4, 5, or 6. As used herein, the phrase “up to X” conservative amino acid substitutions includes 0 substitutions and any number of substitutions up to and including X substitutions. Such exemplary substitutions are preferably made in accordance with those set forth in Table 2 as follows:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExemplary Conservative Amino Acid Substitutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOriginal residue\n\n\nConservative substitution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAla (A)\n\n\nGly; Ser\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nArg (R)\n\n\nLys; His\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAsn (N)\n\n\nGln; His\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAsp (D)\n\n\nGlu; Asn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCys (C)\n\n\nSer; Ala\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGln (Q)\n\n\nAsn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGlu (E)\n\n\nAsp; Gln\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGly (G)\n\n\nAla\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHis (H)\n\n\nAsn; Gln\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIle (I)\n\n\nLeu; Val\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLeu (L)\n\n\nIle; Val\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLys (K)\n\n\nArg; His\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMet (M)\n\n\nLeu; Ile; Tyr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPhe (F)\n\n\nTyr; Met; Leu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPro (P)\n\n\nAla\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSer (S)\n\n\nThr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThr (T)\n\n\nSer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTrp (W)\n\n\nTyr; Phe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTyr (Y)\n\n\nTrp; Phe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nVal (V)\n\n\nIle; Leu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “consists essentially of,” or variations such as “consist essentially of” or “consisting essentially of,” as used throughout the specification and claims, indicate the inclusion of any recited elements or group of elements, and the optional inclusion of other elements, of similar or different nature than the recited elements, which do not materially change the basic or novel properties of the specified dosage regimen, method, or composition. As a nonlimiting example, a binding compound which consists essentially of a recited amino acid sequence may also include one or more amino acids that do not materially affect the properties of the binding compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Effective amount” encompasses an amount sufficient to ameliorate or prevent a symptom or sign of the medical condition. Effective amount also means an amount sufficient to allow or facilitate diagnosis. An effective amount for a particular patient or veterinary subject may vary depending on factors such as the condition being treated, the overall health of the patient, the method route and dose of administration and the severity of side affects (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,888,530 issued to Netti, et al.). An effective amount can be the maximal dose or dosing protocol that avoids significant side effects or toxic effects. The effect will result in an improvement of a diagnostic measure or parameter by at least 5%, usually by at least 10%, more usually at least 20%, most usually at least 30%, preferably at least 40%, more preferably at least 50%, most preferably at least 60%, ideally at least 70%, more ideally at least 80%, and most ideally at least 90%, where 100% is defined as the diagnostic parameter shown by a normal subject (see, e.g., Maynard, et al. (1996) \nA Handbook of SOPs for Good Clinical Practice\n, Interpharm Press, Boca Raton, Fla.; Dent (2001) \nGood Laboratory and Good Clinical Practice\n, Urch Publ., London, UK).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Exogenous” refers to substances that are produced outside an organism, cell, or human body, depending on the context. “Endogenous” refers to substances that are produced within a cell, organism, or human body, depending on the context.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Homology” refers to sequence similarity between two polynucleotide sequences or between two polypeptide sequences. When a position in both of the two compared sequences is occupied by the same base or amino acid monomer subunit, e.g., if a position in each of two DNA molecules is occupied by adenine, then the molecules are homologous at that position. The percent of homology between two sequences is a function of the number of matching or homologous positions shared by the two sequences divided by the number of positions compared ×100. For example, if 6 of 10 of the positions in two sequences are matched or homologous when the sequences are optimally aligned then the two sequences are 60% homologous. Generally, the comparison is made when two sequences are aligned to give maximum percent homology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Immune condition” or “immune disorder” encompasses, e.g., pathological inflammation, an inflammatory disorder, and an autoimmune disorder or disease. “Immune condition” also refers to infections, persistent infections, and proliferative conditions, such as cancer, tumors, and angiogenesis, including infections, tumors, and cancers that resist eradication by the immune system. “Cancerous condition” includes, e.g., cancer, cancer cells, tumors, angiogenesis, and precancerous conditions such as dysplasia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Inflammatory disorder” means a disorder or pathological condition where the pathology results, in whole or in part, from, e.g., a change in number, change in rate of migration, or change in activation, of cells of the immune system. Cells of the immune system include, e.g., T cells, B cells, monocytes or macrophages, antigen presenting cells (APCs), dendritic cells, microglia, NK cells, NKT cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, mast cells, or any other cell specifically associated with the immunology, for example, cytokine-producing endothelial or epithelial cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Isolated binding compound” refers to the purification status of a binding compound and in such context means the molecule is substantially free of other biological molecules such as nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, or other material such as cellular debris and growth media. Generally, the term “isolated” is not intended to refer to a complete absence of such material or to an absence of water, buffers, or salts, unless they are present in amounts that substantially interfere with experimental or therapeutic use of the binding compound as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Isolated nucleic acid molecule” means a DNA or RNA of genomic, mRNA, cDNA, or synthetic origin or some combination thereof which is not associated with all or a portion of a polynucleotide in which the isolated polynucleotide is found in nature, or is linked to a polynucleotide to which it is not linked in nature. For purposes of this disclosure, it should be understood that “a nucleic acid molecule comprising” a particular nucleotide sequence does not encompass intact chromosomes. Isolated nucleic acid molecules “comprising” specified nucleic acid sequences may include, in addition to the specified sequences, coding sequences for up to ten or even up to twenty or more other proteins or portions thereof, or may include operably linked regulatory sequences that control expression of the coding region of the recited nucleic acid sequences, and/or may include vector sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase “control sequences” refers to DNA sequences necessary for the expression of an operably linked coding sequence in a particular host organism. The control sequences that are suitable for prokaryotes, for example, include a promoter, optionally an operator sequence, and a ribosome binding site. Eukaryotic cells are known to use promoters, polyadenylation signals, and enhancers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA nucleic acid is “operably linked” when it is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For example, DNA for a presequence or secretory leader is operably linked to DNA for a polypeptide if it is expressed as a preprotein that participates in the secretion of the polypeptide; a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the sequence; or a ribosome binding site is operably linked to a coding sequence if it is positioned so as to facilitate translation. Generally, “operably linked” means that the DNA sequences being linked are contiguous, and, in the case of a secretory leader, contiguous and in reading phase. However, enhancers do not have to be contiguous. Linking is accomplished by ligation at convenient restriction sites. If such sites do not exist, the synthetic oligonucleotide adaptors or linkers are used in accordance with conventional practice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the expressions “cell,” “cell line,” and “cell culture” are used interchangeably and all such designations include progeny. Thus, the words “transformants” and “transformed cells” include the primary subject cell and cultures derived therefrom without regard for the number of transfers. It is also understood that all progeny may not be precisely identical in DNA content, due to deliberate or inadvertent mutations. Mutant progeny that have the same function or biological activity as screened for in the originally transformed cell are included. Where distinct designations are intended, it will be clear from the context.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “polymerase chain reaction” or “PCR” refers to a procedure or technique in which minute amounts of a specific piece of nucleic acid, RNA and/or DNA, are amplified as described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,683,195. Generally, sequence information from the ends of the region of interest or beyond needs to be available, such that oligonucleotide primers can be designed; these primers will be identical or similar in sequence to opposite strands of the template to be amplified. The 5′ terminal nucleotides of the two primers can coincide with the ends of the amplified material. PCR can be used to amplify specific RNA sequences, specific DNA sequences from total genomic DNA, and cDNA transcribed from total cellular RNA, bacteriophage or plasmid sequences, etc. See generally Mullis et al. (1987) \nCold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. \n51:263; Erlich, ed., (1989) PCR T\nECHNOLOGY \n(Stockton Press, N.Y.) As used herein, PCR is considered to be one, but not the only, example of a nucleic acid polymerase reaction method for amplifying a nucleic acid test sample comprising the use of a known nucleic acid as a primer and a nucleic acid polymerase to amplify or generate a specific piece of nucleic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “germline sequence” refers to a sequence of unrearranged immunoglobulin DNA sequences. Any suitable source of unrearranged immunoglobulin may be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Inhibitors” and “antagonists,” or “activators” and “agonists,” refer to inhibitory or activating molecules, respectively, e.g., for the activation of, e.g., a ligand, receptor, cofactor, a gene, cell, tissue, or organ. A modulator of, e.g., a gene, a receptor, a ligand, or a cell, is a molecule that alters an activity of the gene, receptor, ligand, or cell, where activity can be activated, inhibited, or altered in its regulatory properties. The modulator may act alone, or it may use a cofactor, e.g., a protein, metal ion, or small molecule. Inhibitors are compounds that decrease, block, prevent, delay activation, inactivate, desensitize, or down regulate, e.g., a gene, protein, ligand, receptor, or cell. Activators are compounds that increase, activate, facilitate, enhance activation, sensitize, or up regulate, e.g., a gene, protein, ligand, receptor, or cell. An inhibitor may also be defined as a compound that reduces, blocks, or inactivates a constitutive activity. An “agonist” is a compound that interacts with a target to cause or promote an increase in the activation of the target. An “antagonist” is a compound that opposes the actions of an agonist. An antagonist prevents, reduces, inhibits, or neutralizes the activity of an agonist. An antagonist can also prevent, inhibit, or reduce constitutive activity of a target, e.g., a target receptor, even where there is no identified agonist.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo examine the extent of inhibition, for example, samples or assays comprising a given, e.g., protein, gene, cell, or organism, are treated with a potential activator or inhibitor and are compared to control samples without the inhibitor. Control samples, i.e., samples not treated with antagonist, are assigned a relative activity value of 100%. Inhibition is achieved when the activity value relative to the control is about 90% or less, typically 85% or less, more typically 80% or less, most typically 75% or less, generally 70% or less, more generally 65% or less, most generally 60% or less, typically 55% or less, usually 50% or less, more usually 45% or less, most usually 40% or less, preferably 35% or less, more preferably 30% or less, still more preferably 25% or less, and most preferably less than 25%. Activation is achieved when the activity value relative to the control is about 110%, generally at least 120%, more generally at least 140%, more generally at least 160%, often at least 180%, more often at least 2-fold, most often at least 2.5-fold, usually at least 5-fold, more usually at least 10-fold, preferably at least 20-fold, more preferably at least 40-fold, and most preferably over 40-fold higher.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEndpoints in activation or inhibition can be monitored as follows. Activation, inhibition, and response to treatment, e.g., of a cell, physiological fluid, tissue, organ, and animal or human subject, can be monitored by an endpoint. The endpoint may comprise a predetermined quantity or percentage of, e.g., indicia of inflammation, oncogenicity, or cell degranulation or secretion, such as the release of a cytokine, toxic oxygen, or a protease. The endpoint may comprise, e.g., a predetermined quantity of ion flux or transport; cell migration; cell adhesion; cell proliferation; potential for metastasis; cell differentiation; and change in phenotype, e.g., change in expression of gene relating to inflammation, apoptosis, transformation, cell cycle, or metastasis (see, e.g., Knight (2000) \nAnn. Clin. Lab. Sci. \n30:145-158; Hood and Cheresh (2002) \nNature Rev. Cancer \n2:91-100; Timme, et al. (2003) \nCurr. Drug Targets \n4:251-261; Robbins and Itzkowitz (2002) \nMed. Clin. North Am. \n86:1467-1495; Grady and Markowitz (2002) \nAnnu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. \n3:101-128; Bauer, et al. (2001) \nGlia \n36:235-243; Stanimirovic and Satoh (2000) \nBrain Pathol. \n10:113-126).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn endpoint of inhibition is generally 75% of the control or less, preferably 50% of the control or less, more preferably 25% of the control or less, and most preferably 10% of the control or less. Generally, an endpoint of activation is at least 150% the control, preferably at least two times the control, more preferably at least four times the control, and most preferably at least ten times the control.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Ligand” refers, e.g., to a small molecule, peptide, polypeptide, and membrane associated or membrane-bound molecule, or complex thereof, that can act as an agonist or antagonist of a receptor. “Ligand” also encompasses an agent that is not an agonist or antagonist, but that can bind to the receptor. Moreover, “ligand” includes a membrane-bound ligand that has been changed, e.g., by chemical or recombinant methods, to a soluble version of the membrane-bound ligand. By convention, where a ligand is membrane-bound on a first cell, the receptor usually occurs on a second cell. The second cell may have the same or a different identity as the first cell. A ligand or receptor may be entirely intracellular, that is, it may reside in the cytosol, nucleus, or some other intracellular compartment. The ligand or receptor may change its location, e.g., from an intracellular compartment to the outer face of the plasma membrane. The complex of a ligand and receptor is termed a “ligand receptor complex.” Where a ligand and receptor are involved in a signaling pathway, the ligand occurs at an upstream position and the receptor occurs at a downstream position of the signaling pathway.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Small molecule” is defined as a molecule with a molecular weight that is less than 10 kDa, typically less than 2 kDa, preferably less than 1 kDa, and most preferably less than about 500 Da. Small molecules include, but are not limited to, inorganic molecules, organic molecules, organic molecules containing an inorganic component, molecules comprising a radioactive atom, synthetic molecules, peptide mimetics, and antibody mimetics. As a therapeutic, a small molecule may be more permeable to cells, less susceptible to degradation, and less apt to elicit an immune response than large molecules. Small molecules, such as peptide mimetics of antibodies and cytokines, as well as small molecule toxins, have been described (see, e.g., Casset, et al. (2003) \nBiochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. \n307:198-205; Muyldermans (2001) \nJ. Biotechnol. \n74:277-302; Li (2000) \nNat. Biotechnol. \n18:1251-1256; Apostolopoulos, et al. (2002) \nCurr. Med. Chem. \n9:411-420; Monfardini, et al. (2002) \nCurr. Pharm. Des. \n8:2185-2199; Domingues, et al. (1999) \nNat. Struct. Biol. \n6:652-656; Sato and Sone (2003) \nBiochem. J. \n371:603-608; U.S. Pat. No. 6,326,482 issued to Stewart, et al).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Specifically” or “selectively” binds, when referring to a ligand/receptor, antibody/antigen, or other binding pair, indicates a binding reaction that is determinative of the presence of the protein in a heterogeneous population of proteins and other biologics. Thus, under designated conditions, a specified ligand binds to a particular receptor and does not bind in a significant amount to other proteins present in the sample. The antibody, or binding compound derived from the antigen-binding site of an antibody, of the contemplated method binds to its antigen, or a variant or mutein thereof, with an affinity that is at least two fold greater, preferably at least ten times greater, more preferably at least 20-times greater, and most preferably at least 100-times greater than the affinity with any other antigen. In a preferred embodiment the antibody will have an affinity that is greater than about 10\n9 \nM\n−1\n, as determined, e.g., by Scatchard analysis (Munsen et al. (1980) \nAnalyt. Biochem. \n107:220-239).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “immunomodulatory agent” refers to natural or synthetic agents that suppress or modulate an immune response. The immune response can be a humoral or cellular response. Immunomodulatory agents encompass immunosuppressive or anti-inflammatory agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Immunosuppressive agents”, “immunosuppressive drugs”, or “immunosuppressants” as used herein are therapeutics that are used in immunosuppressive therapy to inhibit or prevent activity of the immune system. Clinically they are used to prevent the rejection of transplanted organs and tissues (e.g. bone marrow, heart, kidney, liver), and/or in the treatment of autoimmune diseases or diseases that are most likely of autoimmune origin (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, myasthenia gravis, systemic lupus erythematosus, ulcerative colitis, multiple sclerosis). Immunosuppressive drugs can be classified as: glucocorticoids; cytostatics; antibodies (biological response modifiers); drugs acting on immunophilins; other drugs, including known chemotherpeutic agents used in the treatment of proliferative disorders. For multiple sclerosis, in particular, the antibodies of the present invention can be administered in conjunction with a new class of myelin binding protein-like therapeutics, known as copaxones.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Anti-inflammatory agents” or “anti-inflammatory drugs” refer to both steroidal and non-steroidal therapeutics. Steroids, also known as corticosteroids, are drugs that closely resemble cortisol, a hormone produced naturally by adrenal glands. Steroids are used as the main treatment for certain inflammatory conditions, such as: systemic vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels); and myositis (inflammation of muscle). Steroids might also be used selectively to treat inflammatory conditions such as: rheumatoid arthritis (chronic inflammatory arthritis occurring in joints on both sides of the body); systemic lupus erythematosus (a generalized disease caused by abnormal immune system function); Sjögren's syndrome (chronic disorder that causes dry eyes and a dry mouth).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, usually abbreviated to NSAIDs, are drugs with analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effects—they reduce pain, fever and inflammation. The term “non-steroidal” is used to distinguish these drugs from steroids, which (amongst a broad range of other effects) have a similar eicosanoid-depressing, anti-inflammatory action. NSAIDs are generally indicated for the symptomatic relief of the following conditions: rheumatoid arthritis; osteoarthritis; inflammatory arthropathies (e.g. ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, Reiter's syndrome); acute gout; dysmenorrhoea; metastatic bone pain; headache and migraine; postoperative pain; mild-to-moderate pain due to inflammation and tissue injury; pyrexia; and renal colic. NSAIDs include salicylates, arlyalknoic acids, 2-arylpropionic acids (profens), N-arylanthranilic acids (fenamic acids), oxicams, coxibs, and sulphonanilides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDisease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) may be administered, often in combination with NSAIDs. Commonly prescribed DMARDs include hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, methotrexate, gold therapy, sulfasalazine, and azathioprine.\n\n\n \nII. Antibodies Specific for Human IL-17A\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides engineered anti-IL-17A antibodies and uses thereof to treat various inflammatory, immune and proliferative disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis osteoporosis, inflammatory fibrosis (e.g., scleroderma, lung fibrosis, and cirrhosis), inflammatory bowel disorders (e.g., Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and inflammatory bowel disease), asthma (including allergic asthma), allergies, COPD, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis and cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny suitable method for generating monoclonal antibodies may be used to generate the anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention. For example, a recipient animal may be immunized with a linked or unlinked (e.g. naturally occurring) form of the IL-17A homodimer, or a fragment thereof. Any suitable method of immunization can be used. Such methods can include adjuvants, other immunostimulants, repeated booster immunizations, and the use of one or more immunization routes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny suitable form of IL-17A can be used as the immunogen (antigen) for the generation of the non-human antibody specific for IL-17A, which antibody can be screened for biological activity. The eliciting immunogen may be full-length mature human IL-17A, including linked and naturally occurring homodimers, or peptides thereof encompassing single epitopes or multiple epitopes. The immunogen may be used alone or in combination with one or more immunogenicity enhancing agents known in the art. The immunogen may be purified from a natural source or produced in a genetically modified cell. DNA encoding the immunogen may be genomic or non-genomic (e.g., cDNA) in origin. Immunogen-encoding DNA may be expressed using suitable genetic vectors, including but not limited to adenoviral vectors, adenoassociated viral vectors, baculoviral vectors, plasmids, and non-viral vectors, such as cationic lipids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny suitable method can be used to elicit an antibody response with the desired biologic properties, e.g. to inhibit IL-17A binding to its receptor. In some embodiments, antibodies are raised in mammalian hosts such as mice, rodents, primates, humans, etc. Techniques for preparing monoclonal antibodies may be found in, e.g., Stites et al. (eds.) B\nASIC AND \nC\nLINICAL \nI\nMMUNOLOGY \n(4th ed.) Lange Medical Publications, Los Altos, Calif., and references cited therein; Harlow and Lane (1988) A\nNTIBODIES: A \nL\nABORATORY \nM\nANUAL \nCSH Press; Goding (1986) M\nONOCLONAL \nA\nNTIBODIES\n: P\nRINCIPLES AND \nP\nRACTICE \n(2d ed.) Academic Press, New York, N.Y. Thus, monoclonal antibodies may be obtained by a variety of techniques familiar to researchers skilled in the art. Typically, spleen cells from an animal immunized with a desired antigen are immortalized, commonly by fusion with a myeloma cell. See Kohler and Milstein (1976) \nEur. J. Immunol. \n6:511-519. Alternative methods of immortalization include transformation with Epstein Barr Virus, oncogenes, or retroviruses, or other methods known in the art. See, e.g., Doyle et al. (eds.) (1994 and periodic supplements) C\nELL AND \nT\nISSUE \nC\nULTURE\n: L\nABORATORY \nP\nROCEDURES\n, John Wiley and Sons, New York, N.Y. Colonies arising from single immortalized cells are screened for production of antibodies of the desired specificity and affinity for the antigen. The yield of monoclonal antibodies produced by such cells may be enhanced by various techniques, including injection into the peritoneal cavity of a vertebrate host.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther suitable techniques involve selection of libraries of antibodies in phage or similar vectors. See, e.g., Huse et al., \nScience \n246:1275-1281 (1989); and Ward et al., \nNature \n341:544-546 (1989). The antibodies of the present invention may be used without modification, e.g. as the parental rodent antibody, or with modifications to facilitate their use as therapeutic agents in human subjects, such as chimeric or humanized antibodies. In some embodiments, the antibodies will be labeled, covalently or non-covalently, with a substance that provides a detectable signal. A wide variety of labels and conjugation techniques are known and are reported extensively in both the scientific and patent literature. Suitable labels include radionuclides, enzymes, substrates, cofactors, inhibitors, fluorescent moieties, chemiluminescent moieties, magnetic particles, and the like. Patents teaching the use of such labels include U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,817,837; 3,850,752; 3,939,350; 3,996,345; 4,277,437; 4,275,149; and 4,366,241. Also, recombinant immunoglobulins may be produced, see Cabilly U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and Queen et al. (1989) \nProc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA \n86:10029-10033; or made in transgenic mice, see Mendez et al. (1997) \nNature Genetics \n15:146-156; also see Abgenix and Medarex technologies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies against predetermined fragments of IL-17A can be raised by immunization of animals with conjugates of the predetermined fragment of IL-17A with carrier proteins. Monoclonal antibodies are prepared from cells secreting the desired antibody. These antibodies can be screened for binding to normal or defective IL-17A. These monoclonal antibodies will usually bind with at least a K\nd \nof about 1 μM, more usually at least about 300, 30, 10, or 3 nM, preferably at least about 300, 100, 30, 10, 3, or 1 pM. Because of the inverse relationship of K\nd \nvalues and affinity, references to binding with a given K\nd \n“or less” refers to binding with an affinity that is at least as high as the recited numerical value, i.e. with a K\nd \nthat is at least as low as the cited value. Binding affinities may be determined by ELISA (see Examples 5-6, infra), or by Biacore® surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, KinExA or ECL methods (see Example 7, infra). Suitable non-human antibodies may also be identified using the biological assays described in Examples 8-11 and 16-17, infra.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn exemplary method of producing anti-human IL-17A antibodies of the present invention is described at Example 2.\n\n\n \nIII. Humanization of IL-17A Specific Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nAny suitable non-human antibody can be used as a source for the hypervariable region of an anti-IL-17A antibody of the present invention. Sources for non-human antibodies include, but are not limited to, rodents (e.g. mouse, rat), Lagomorphs (including rabbits), cows, and nonhuman primates. For the most part, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which hypervariable region residues of the recipient are replaced by hypervariable region residues from a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity and affinity. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody, such as modifications made to further refine antibody performance of the desired biological activity. For further details, see Jones et al. (1986) \nNature \n321: 522-525; Reichmann et al. (1988) \nNature \n332: 323-329; and Presta (1992) \nCurr. Op. Struct. Biol. \n2: 593-596.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for recombinantly engineering and producing antibodies have been described, e.g., by Boss et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,397), Cabilly et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567), Law et al. (European Patent Application Publication No. 438 310) and Winter (European Patent Application Publication No. 239 400).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmino acid sequence variants of humanized anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention may be prepared by introducing appropriate nucleotide changes into the humanized anti-IL-17A antibody DNA, or by peptide synthesis. Any combination of deletion, insertion, and substitution may be made to arrive at the final construct, provided that the final construct possesses the desired characteristics. The amino acid changes also may alter post-translational processing of the humanized anti-IL-17A antibody, such as changing the number or position of glycosylation sites.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne useful method for identifying residues or regions of a humanized anti-IL-17A antibody that are preferred locations for mutagenesis is called “alanine scanning mutagenesis.” Cunningham and Wells (1989) \nScience \n244: 1081-1085. A group of target residues is identified (e.g., charged residues such as Arg, Asp, His, Lys, and Glu) and replaced by a neutral or negatively charged amino acid (most preferably alanine or polyalanine) to alter the interaction of the amino acids with IL-17A. The residues showing functional sensitivity to alanine substitutions are then refined by introducing further amino acid substitutions. In one embodiment, the effect of mutations at a given target codon is determined by alanine scanning or random mutagenesis followed by activity and binding analysis of the resulting humanized anti-IL-17A antibody variants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmino acid sequence insertions include amino- and/or carboxyl-terminal fusions ranging in length from one residue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more residues, as well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Examples of terminal insertions include humanized anti-IL-17A antibody with an N-terminal methionyl residue or the antibody fused to an epitope tag. Other variants include the fusion of an enzyme or a polypeptide that increases the serum half-life of an antibody to the N- or C-terminus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother type of variant is an amino acid substitution variant. These variants have at least one amino acid residue in the humanized anti-IL-17A antibody molecule removed and a different residue inserted in its place. The sites of greatest interest for substitutional mutagenesis include the hypervariable loops, but FR alterations are also contemplated. Hypervariable region residues or FR residues involved in antigen binding are generally substituted in a relatively conservative manner.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther amino acid variants of the antibody alter the original glycosylation pattern of the antibody, e.g. by eliminating one or more carbohydrate moieties and/or adding one or more glycosylation sites. Glycosylation of antibodies is typically either N-linked or O-linked. N-linked refers to the attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The tripeptide sequences asparagine-X-serine and asparagine-X-threonine, where X is any amino acid except proline, are the recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. The presence of either of these tripeptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site. O-linked glycosylation involves attachment of N-acetylgalactosamine, galactose, or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid, most commonly serine or threonine, although 5-hydroxyproline or 5-hydroxylysine may also be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlycosylation sites can be added to the antibodies of the present invention by inserting one or more of the above-described tripeptide sequences (for N-linked glycosylation sites), or addition of one or more serine or threonine residues (for O-linked glycosylation sites).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acid molecules encoding amino acid sequence variants of humanized IL-17A-specific antibody are prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include, but are not limited to, isolation from a natural source (in the case of naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants), or by oligonucleotide-mediated (or site-directed) mutagenesis, PCR mutagenesis, or cassette mutagenesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOrdinarily, amino acid sequence variants of the humanized anti-IL-17A antibody will have an amino acid sequence having at least 50% amino acid sequence identity with the original humanized antibody amino acid sequences of either the heavy or the light chain, preferably at least 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, and most preferably at least 95%. Identity or homology with respect to this sequence is defined herein as the percentage of amino acid residues in the candidate sequence that are identical with the humanized anti-IL-17A residues when the sequences are optimally aligned (i.e. after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity), and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity. None of N-terminal, C-terminal, or internal extensions, deletions, or insertions into the antibody sequence is considered to affect sequence identity or homology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe humanized antibody can be selected from any class of immunoglobulins, including IgM, IgG, IgD, IgA, and IgE. In one embodiment, the antibody is an IgG antibody. Any isotype of IgG can be used, including IgG\n1\n, IgG\n2\n, IgG\n3\n, and IgG\n4\n. Variants of the IgG isotypes are also contemplated. The humanized antibody may comprise sequences from more than one class or isotype. Optimization of the necessary constant domain sequences to generate the desired biologic activity is readily achieved by screening the antibodies in the biological assays described below in the Examples.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLikewise, either class of light chain can be used in the compounds and methods herein. Specifically, kappa, lambda, or variants thereof are useful in the present compounds and methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny suitable portion of the CDR sequences from the non-human antibody can be used to create the humanized antibodies of the present invention. The CDR sequences may be mutagenized by substitution, insertion or deletion, although such mutations would be minimal because of the need to maintain IL-17A binding affinity and specificity. Typically, at least 75% of the humanized antibody CDR residues will correspond to those of the non-human CDR residues, more often 90%, and most preferably greater than 95%, and frequently 100%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny suitable portion of the FR sequences from the human antibody can be used. The FR sequences can be mutagenized by substitution, insertion or deletion of at least one residue such that the FR sequence is distinct from the human and non-human antibody sequence employed. It is contemplated that such mutations would be minimal. Typically, at least 75% of the humanized antibody residues will correspond to those of the human FR residues, more often 90%, and most preferably greater than 95%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso contemplated are chimeric antibodies or fragments thereof, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and Morrison et al. (1984) \nProc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA \n81: 6851-6855). As noted above, typical chimeric antibodies comprise constant domain sequences from antibodies from one species linked to the variable domain of an antigen-specific antibody obtained from a different species.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe binding compounds of the invention may comprise bispecific antibodies. As used herein, the term “bispecific antibody” refers to an antibody, typically a monoclonal antibody, having binding specificities for at least two different antigenic epitopes. In one embodiment, the epitopes are from the same antigen. In another embodiment, the epitopes are from two different antigens. Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. For example, bispecific antibodies can be produced recombinantly using the co-expression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain/light chain pairs. See, e.g., Milstein et al. (1983) \nNature \n305: 537-39. Alternatively, bispecific antibodies can be prepared using chemical linkage. See, e.g., Brennan, et al. (1985) \nScience \n229: 81. Bispecific antibodies include bispecific antibody fragments. See, e.g., Hollinger, et al. (1993) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. \n90: 6444-48, Gruber, et al., \nJ. Immunol. \n152: 5368 (1994).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn exemplary method of humanizing anti-human IL-17A antibodies of the present invention is described at Example 3.\n\n\n \nIV. Characterization of IL-17A Specific Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nThe methods described herein were used to generate monoclonal antibodies immunoreactive with human IL-17A, as described in greater detail in Examples 2 and 3. \nFIGS. 1A and 1B\n show sequence alignments of the variable regions of the light and heavy chains, respectively, of various anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention. CDR regions are indicated, and numbering is according to Kabat et al. (1991).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA plasmid containing the nucleic acid sequences encoding the humanized 16C10 light and heavy chains was deposited pursuant to the Budapest Treaty on Jul. 28, 2006, with American Type Culture Collection (ATCC—Manassas, Va., USA) under Accession Number PTA-7675.

Although they were obtained as independent clones, parental rat antibodies 16C10 and 4C3 are identical in the sequence of the V\nH \nregion and differ in the V\nL \nregion only by a framework substitution (isoleucine at position 15 in 16C10 is valine in 4C3). As a result, the CDRs are identical for these two parental rat antibodies, and thus for their humanized forms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSequences are provided for humanized V\nL \nregions of antibodies 16C10/4C3 and 30C10 at SEQ ID NOs: 5 and 22, respectively. Sequences are provided for humanized V\nH \nregions of antibodies 16C10/4C3 and 30C10 at SEQ ID NOs: 6 and 23, respectively. These humanized variable domains may be used to create full-length chimeric or humanized antibodies by adding the appropriate constant domain sequences. Other embodiments include various other alterations in the CDR amino acid residues in the 16C10 heavy chain, for example, as illustrated in Table 4. With reference to the residue numbering of \nFIG. 1B\n, the alterations described in Table 4 (and in SEQ ID NOs: 17 and 20) are N54A, N54Q, N60A, N60Q, M96L, M96A, M96K, M96F, M100hF, M100hL.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the present invention, chimeric light and heavy chains of antibody 16C10 are created by appending human constant domains (human kappa light chain and human IgG1 constant domain, respectively) to the C-terminus of the humanized V\nL \n(SEQ ID NO: 5) and V\nH \nregions (SEQ ID NO: 6). Sequences of chimeric 16C10 light and heavy chains are provided at SEQ ID NOs: 9 and 10. In other embodiments, chimeric forms of antibodies 30C10 and 4C3 are created by fusing the same constant domains from chimeric 16C10 to their respective humanized V\nL \nand V\nH \nregions (SEQ ID NOs: 22 and 23 for 30C10; SEQ ID NOs: 5 and 6 for 4C3). The chimeric form of humanized 4C3 would, of course, be identical to the chimeric form of humanized 16C10.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, full length humanized antibodies are created by substituting framework residues (i.e. those amino acid residues in the variable domain that are not part of a CDR) of the chimeric forms antibodies with human germline framework sequences, as described in more detail in Example 3. The resulting antibodies retain only the CDR sequences from the rat antibodies, with the constant domains and framework sequences replaced by human-derived sequences. Full-length light and heavy chains for humanized antibody 16C10, including signal sequences, are provided at SEQ ID NOs: 2 and 4, respectively. In other embodiments, humanized forms of antibodies 4C3 and 23E12 are created by analogy with the method described for 16C10, i.e. substituting the appropriate human framework sequences into the sequence of the chimeric versions of these antibodies (described supra). See Example 3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment, the full-length light and heavy chains of the humanized antibodies of the present invention are cloned to have a signal peptide at their N-terminus to facilitate secretion from cells when the antibody is produced. In one embodiment, a 19 amino acid signal sequence is added to both the light and heavy chains of the humanized 16C10 antibody (residues −19 to −1 of SEQ ID NOs: 2 and 4). DNA sequences of the full length light and heavy chains of humanized 16C10, with signal sequence added, are provided at SEQ ID NOs: 1 and 3. Such DNA sequences can be cloned and expressed in any suitable expression vector for production of the humanized antibodies of the present invention. In other embodiments, signal sequences may be added to the light and heavy chains of humanized antibodies 30C10 and 4C3, as described for antibody 16C10. In other embodiments, signal sequence peptides are added that are different than the specific signal sequence provided in SEQ ID NOs: 1-4, depending on the intended method of production of the antibodies. Such signal sequences may be obtained from the scientific literature, for example Choo et al. (2005) “SPdb—a signal peptide database,” \nBMC Bioinformatics \n6:249.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet other embodiments, different constant domains may be appended to the humanized V\nL \nand V\nH \nregions provided herein. For example, if a particular intended use of an antibody (or fragment) of the present invention were to call for altered effector functions, a heavy chain constant domain other than IgG1 may be used. Although IgG1 antibodies provide for long half-life and for effector functions, such as complement activation and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, such activities may not be desirable for all uses of the antibody. In such instances an IgG4 constant domain, for example, may be used.\n\n\n \nV. Affinity and Biological Activity of Humanized Anti-IL-17A\n\n\n \n \n \nAntibodies having the characteristics identified herein as being desirable in a humanized anti-IL-17A antibody can be screened for inhibitory biologic activity in vitro, in vivo, or by measuring binding affinity. To screen for antibodies that bind to the same epitope on human IL-17A bound by an antibody of interest (e.g., those which block binding of the cytokine to its receptor), a routine cross-blocking assay can be performed such as that described in A\nNTIBODIES, A \nL\nABORATORY \nM\nANUAL\n, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Ed Harlow and David Lane (1988). Alternatively, epitope mapping can be performed to determine whether the antibody binds an epitope of interest, e.g., as described in Champe et al. (1995) \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n270:1388-1394. Antibody affinities (e.g. for human IL-17A) may be determined using standard methods, including those described in Example 7. Preferred humanized antibodies are those which bind human IL-17A with a K\nd \nvalue of no more than about 100 nM (1×10\n−7 \nM); preferably no more than about 10 nM; more preferably no more than about 1 nM. Even more preferred are embodiments in which the antibodies have K\nd \nvalues of no more than about 200 pM (2×10\n−10 \nM), 100 pM, 50 pM, 20 pM, 10 pM, 5 pM or even 2 pM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies, and fragments thereof, useful in the present compounds and methods include, but are not limited to, biologically active antibodies and fragments. As used herein, the term “biologically active” refers to an antibody or antibody fragment that is capable of binding the desired the antigenic epitope and directly or indirectly exerting a biologic effect. Typically, these effects result from the failure of IL-17A to bind its receptor. As used herein, the term “specific” refers to the selective binding of the antibody to the target antigen epitope. Antibodies can be tested for specificity of binding by comparing binding to IL-17A to binding to irrelevant antigen or antigen mixture under a given set of conditions. An antibody is considered to be specific if it binds to IL-17A with an affinity at least 10-fold, and preferably 50-fold higher than its affinity for an irrelevant antigen or antigen mixture. An antibody that “specifically binds” to a protein comprising IL-17A (or a fragment thereof) does not bind to proteins that do not comprise the IL-17A-derived sequences, i.e. “specificity” as used herein relates to IL-17A specificity, and not any other sequences that may be present in the protein in question. For example, as used herein, an antibody that “specifically binds” to FLAG-hIL-17A, which is a fusion protein comprising IL-17A and a FLAG® peptide tag, does not bind to the FLAG® peptide tag alone or when it is fused to a protein other than IL-17A.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe data presented in the Examples below show (e.g. Example 7) that humanized antibody 16C10 (including the N54Q and M96A substitutions relative to the parental rat heavy chain CDRs) has a high affinity for binding to human IL-17A, with a K\nd \nin the 1-10 pM range as determined by KinExA analysis. In vitro activity assays, such as Ba/F3 hIL-17Rc-GCSFR cell proliferation assay (Example 11), normal human dermal fibroblast (NHDF) assay (Example 9), and human rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synoviocyte assay (Example 8) confirm that hu16C10 is a high affinity antibody since the observed IC50 values were typically less than or equal to 50% of the concentration of hIL-17A present in the assay (100 pM, 1000 pM, and 1000 pM in the three assays, respectively). The bivalent character of the antibodies used in the experiments, and the potential for IL-17A dimer formation, make it possible to achieve 50% inhibition of a given concentration of IL-17A with less than 0.5 molar equivalents of antibody. In vivo activity assays, such as administration to mice exhibiting collagen-induced arthritis (Example 16) and BAL neutrophil recruitment assay (Example 17) confirm the activity of several of the anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention in animals. The in vitro and in vivo activity assays also confirm that humanized antibody 16C10 is a neutralizing antibody, which was not known from the binding experiments alone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ability of several of the antibodies of the present invention to bind to cyno IL-17A as well as human IL-17A is advantageous because such a potential therapeutic antibody can be used directly in cynomolgus monkey for toxicology studies, rather than having to develop a separate cyno-specific antibody for such studies. The high affinity of several of the antibodies of the present invention is also advantageous in that may reduce the required dosage in human (and other) subjects, which reduces the likelihood of certain adverse reactions. In addition, the high affinity may reduce the volume that must be administered to a subject and reduce the cost of treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe serum half-life of hu16C10 was measured in mouse and in cynomolgus monkeys. In cyno, half-life after intravenous (iv) administration was evaluated in a dose ranging study with 0.4, 4.0 and 40 mg/kg dosing. Serum concentrations of drug were measured periodically for 42 days. The half-life for subcutaneous (sc) administration in cyno was determined at 4 mg/kg dosing, which was also followed for 42 days. The half-life in cynomolgus monkeys was 10-19 days iv and 28 days sc as measured by the terminal slope of the drug concentration versus time profile. Certain anomalous datapoints at higher dosings were excluded from the analysis. Similar experiments in mice showed that the hu16C10 antibody had a half-life of 13-25 days iv and 12-22 days sc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExample 19 describes methods used to determine the epitope bound by an exemplary anti-IL-17A antibody of the present invention (16C10), i.e. residues in the region of L74-Y85 of human IL-17A (SEQ ID NO.: 40). Since the biological assay data presented herein demonstrate that antibody 16C10 is a high affinity neutralizing antibody, other antibodies that bind to the same epitope may also be expected to be neutralizing antibodies, and perhaps also have high binding affinity. The epitope as determined herein is obtained by functional measurements, rather than structure determinations, and the epitope reported herein may differ in detail from the epitope determined by structural methods. The epitope reported herein includes at least some, but not necessarily all, of the amino acid residues that are important for antibody 16C10 binding. The epitope bound by antibodies of the present invention may also be determined by other methods, such as cross-blocking experiments (see Example 12), or by structural methods such as X-ray crystal structure determination. Additional antibodies binding to the same epitope as antibody 16C10 may be obtained, for example, by screening of antibodies raised against hIL-17A, or by immunization of an animal with a peptide comprising the epitope sequence.\n\n\n \nV. Antibody Production\n\n\n \n \n \nFor recombinant production of the antibody, the nucleic acid encoding it is isolated and inserted into a replicable vector for further cloning (amplification of the DNA) or for expression. DNA encoding the monoclonal antibody is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the antibody). Many vectors are available. The vector components generally include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: a signal sequence, an origin of replication, one or more marker genes, an enhancer element, a promoter, and a transcription termination sequence. In one embodiment, both the light and heavy chains of the humanized anti-IL-17A antibody of the present invention are expressed from the same vector, e.g. a plasmid or an adenoviral vector.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies of the present invention may be produced by any method known in the art. In one embodiment, antibodies are expressed in mammalian or insect cells in culture, such as chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, mouse myeloma NSO cells, baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, \nSpodoptera frugiperda \novarian (Sf9) cells. In one embodiment, antibodies secreted from CHO cells are recovered and purified by standard chromatographic methods, such as protein A, cation exchange, anion exchange, hydrophobic interaction, and hydroxyapatite chromatography. Resulting antibodies are concentrated and stored in 20 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the antibodies of the present invention are produced in yeast according to the methods described in WO2005/040395. Briefly, vectors encoding the individual light or heavy chains of an antibody of interest are introduced into different yeast haploid cells, e.g. different mating types of the yeast \nPichia pastoris\n, which yeast haploid cells are optionally complementary auxotrophs. The transformed haploid yeast cells can then be mated or fused to give a diploid yeast cell capable of producing both the heavy and the light chains. The diploid strain is then able to secret the fully assembled and biologically active antibody. The relative expression levels of the two chains can be optimized, for example, by using vectors with different copy number, using transcriptional promoters of different strengths, or inducing expression from inducible promoters driving transcription of the genes encoding one or both chains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the respective heavy and light chains of a plurality of different anti-IL-17A antibodies (the “original” antibodies) are introduced into yeast haploid cells to create a library of haploid yeast strains of one mating type expressing a plurality of light chains, and a library of haploid yeast strains of a different mating type expressing a plurality of heavy chains. These libraries of haploid strains can be mated (or fused as spheroplasts) to produce a series of diploid yeast cells expressing a combinatorial library of antibodies comprised of the various possible permutations of light and heavy chains. The combinatorial library of antibodies can then be screened to determine whether any of the antibodies has properties that are superior (e.g. higher affinity for IL-17A) to those of the original antibodies. See. e.g., WO2005/040395.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, antibodies of the present invention are human domain antibodies in which portions of an antibody variable domain are linked in a polypeptide of molecular weight approximately 13 kDa. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Publication No. 2004/0110941. Such single domain, low molecular weight agents provide numerous advantages in terms of ease of synthesis, stability, and route of administration.\n\n\n \nVI. Pharmaceutical Compositions and Administration\n\n\n \n \n \nTo prepare pharmaceutical or sterile compositions of the anti-huIL-17A antibodies of the present invention, the antibody is admixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. See, e.g., \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences and U.S. Pharmacopeia: National Formulary\n, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa. (1984).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations of therapeutic and diagnostic agents may be prepared by mixing with physiologically acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers in the form of, e.g., lyophilized powders, slurries, aqueous solutions or suspensions (see, e.g., Hardman, et al. (2001) \nGoodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics\n, McGraw-Hill, New York, N.Y.; Gennaro (2000) \nRemington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy\n, Lippincott, Williams, and Wilkins, New York, N.Y.; Avis, et al. (eds.) (1993) \nPharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Parenteral Medications\n, Marcel Dekker, NY; Lieberman, et al. (eds.) (1990) \nPharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Tablets\n, Marcel Dekker, NY; Lieberman, et al. (eds.) (1990) \nPharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Disperse Systems\n, Marcel Dekker, NY; Weiner and Kotkoskie (2000) \nExcipient Toxicity and Safety\n, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y.). In one embodiment, anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention are diluted to an appropriate concentration in a sodium acetate solution pH 5-6, and NaCl or sucrose is added for tonicity. Additional agents, such as \npolysorbate\n 20 or \npolysorbate\n 80, may be added to enhance stability.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nToxicity and therapeutic efficacy of the antibody compositions, administered alone or in combination with another agent, can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD\n50 \n(the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED\n50 \n(the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index (LD\n50\n/ED\n50\n). Antibodies exhibiting high therapeutic indices are preferred. The data obtained from these cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in human. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED\n50 \nwith little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe mode of administration is not particularly important. Suitable routes of administration include oral, rectal, transmucosal, or intestinal administration; parenteral delivery, including intramuscular, subcutaneous, intramedullary injections, as well as intrathecal, direct intraventricular, intravenous, intraperitoneal, intranasal, or intraocular injections. Administration can be carried out in a variety of conventional ways, such as oral ingestion, inhalation, insufflation, topical application or cutaneous, transdermal, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, parenteral, intra-arterial or intravenous injection. Intravenous administration to the patient is preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternately, one may administer the antibody in a local rather than systemic manner, for example, via injection of the antibody directly into an arthritic joint or pathogen-induced lesion characterized by immunopathology, often in a depot or sustained release formulation. Furthermore, one may administer the antibody in a targeted drug delivery system, for example, in a liposome coated with a tissue-specific antibody, targeting, for example, arthritic joint or pathogen-induced lesion characterized by immunopathology. The liposomes will be targeted to and taken up selectively by the afflicted tissue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe administration regimen depends on several factors, including the serum or tissue turnover rate of the therapeutic antibody, the level of symptoms, the immunogenicity of the therapeutic antibody, and the accessibility of the target cells in the biological matrix. Preferably, the administration regimen delivers sufficient therapeutic antibody to effect improvement in the target disease state, while simultaneously minimizing undesired side effects. Accordingly, the amount of biologic delivered depends in part on the particular therapeutic antibody and the severity of the condition being treated. Guidance in selecting appropriate doses of therapeutic antibodies is available (see, e.g., Wawrzynczak (1996) \nAntibody Therapy\n, Bios Scientific Pub. Ltd, Oxfordshire, UK; Kresina (ed.) (1991) \nMonoclonal Antibodies, Cytokines and Arthritis\n, Marcel Dekker, New York, N.Y.; Bach (ed.) (1993) \nMonoclonal Antibodies and Peptide Therapy in Autoimmune Diseases\n, Marcel Dekker, New York, N.Y.; Baert, et al. (2003) \nNew Engl. J. Med. \n348:601-608; Milgrom et al. (1999) \nNew Engl. J. Med. \n341:1966-1973; Slamon et al. (2001) \nNew Engl. J. Med. \n344:783-792; Beniaminovitz et al. (2000) \nNew Engl. J. Med. \n342:613-619; Ghosh et al. (2003) \nNew Engl. J. Med. \n348:24-32; Lipsky et al. (2000) \nNew Engl. J. Med. \n343:1594-1602).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDetermination of the appropriate dose is made by the clinician, e.g., using parameters or factors known or suspected in the art to affect treatment. Generally, the dose begins with an amount somewhat less than the optimum dose and it is increased by small increments thereafter until the desired or optimum effect is achieved relative to any negative side effects. Important diagnostic measures include those of symptoms of, e.g., the inflammation or level of inflammatory cytokines produced. Preferably, a biologic that will be used is derived from the same species as the animal targeted for treatment, thereby minimizing an inflammatory, autoimmune, or proliferative response to the reagent. In the case of human subjects, for example, chimeric, humanized and fully human antibodies are preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies, antibody fragments, and cytokines can be provided by continuous infusion, or by doses administered, e.g., daily, 1-7 times per week, weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, bimonthly etc. Doses may be provided intravenously, subcutaneously, topically, orally, nasally, rectally, intramuscular, intracerebrally, intraspinally, or by inhalation. A total weekly dose is generally at least 0.05 μg/kg body weight, more generally at least 0.2 μg/kg, 0.5 μg/kg, 1 μg/kg, 10 μg/kg, 100 μg/kg, 0.25 mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg, 2.0 mg/kg, 5.0 mg/ml, 10 mg/kg, 25 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg or more (see, e.g., Yang, et al. (2003) \nNew Engl. J. Med. \n349:427-434; Herold, et al. (2002) \nNew Engl. J. Med. \n346:1692-1698; Liu, et al. (1999) \nJ. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psych. \n67:451-456; Portielji, et al. (20003) \nCancer Immunol. Immunother. \n52:133-144). Doses may also be provided to achieve a pre-determined target concentration of anti-IL-17A antibody in the subject's serum, such as 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30, 100, 300 μg/ml or more. In other embodiments, a humanized anti-IL-17A antibody of the present invention is administered subcutaneously or intravenously, on a weekly, biweekly or “every 4 weeks” basis at 10, 20, 50, 80, 100, 200, 500, 1000 or 2500 mg/subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “inhibit” or “treat” or “treatment” includes a postponement of development of the symptoms associated with a disorder and/or a reduction in the severity of the symptoms of such disorder. The terms further include ameliorating existing uncontrolled or unwanted symptoms, preventing additional symptoms, and ameliorating or preventing the underlying causes of such symptoms. Thus, the terms denote that a beneficial result has been conferred on a vertebrate subject with a disorder, disease or symptom, or with the potential to develop such a disorder, disease or symptom.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the terms “therapeutically effective amount”, “therapeutically effective dose” and “effective amount” refer to an amount of an IL-17A binding compound of the invention that, when administered alone or in combination with an additional therapeutic agent to a cell, tissue, or subject, is effective to prevent or ameliorate one or more symptoms of a disease or condition or the progression of such disease or condition. A therapeutically effective dose further refers to that amount of the binding compound sufficient to result in amelioration of symptoms, e.g., treatment, healing, prevention or amelioration of the relevant medical condition, or an increase in rate of treatment, healing, prevention or amelioration of such conditions. When applied to an individual active ingredient administered alone, a therapeutically effective dose refers to that ingredient alone. When applied to a combination, a therapeutically effective dose refers to combined amounts of the active ingredients that result in the therapeutic effect, whether administered in combination, serially or simultaneously. An effective amount of a therapeutic will result in an improvement of a diagnostic measure or parameter by at least 10%; usually by at least 20%; preferably at least about 30%; more preferably at least 40%, and most preferably by at least 50%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for co-administration with a second therapeutic agent, e.g., cytokine, another therapeutic antibody, steroid, chemotherapeutic agent, or antibiotic are well known in the art, see, e.g., Hardman, et al. (eds.) (2001) \nGoodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, \n10\nth \ned., McGraw-Hill, New York, N.Y.; Poole and Peterson (eds.) (2001) \nPharmacotherapeutics for Advanced Practice: A Practical Approach\n, Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, Phila., PA; Chabner and Longo (eds.) (2001) \nCancer Chemotherapy and Biotherapy\n, Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, Phila., PA. The pharmaceutical composition of the invention may also contain immunosuppressive or immunomodulating agents. Any suitable immunosuppressive agent can be employed, including but not limited to anti-inflammatory agents, corticosteroids, cyclosporine, tacrolimus (i.e., FK-506), sirolimus, interferons, soluble cytokine receptors (e.g., sTNRF and sIL-1R), agents that neutralize cytokine activity (e.g., inflixmab, etanercept), mycophenolate mofetil, 15-deoxyspergualin, thalidomide, glatiramer, azathioprine, leflunomide, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and the like. The pharmaceutical composition can also be employed with other therapeutic modalities such as phototherapy and radiation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe IL-17A binding compounds of the present invention can also be used in combination with one or more antagonists of other cytokines (e.g. antibodies), including but not limited to, IL-23, IL-1β, IL-6 and TGF-β. See, e.g., Veldhoen (2006) \nImmunity \n24:179-189; Dong (2006) \nNat. Rev. Immunol. \n6(4):329-333. In various embodiments, an IL-17A binding compound of the invention is administered before, concurrently with, or after administration of the another antagonist or antagonists. In one embodiment, an IL-17A binding compound of the present invention is used in treatment of the acute early phase of an adverse immune response (e.g. MS, Crohn's Disease) alone or in combination with an IL-23 antagonist. In the latter case, the IL-17A binding compound may be gradually decreased and treatment with the antagonist of IL-23 alone is continued to maintain suppression of the adverse response. Alternatively, antagonists to IL-1β, IL-6 and/or TGF-β may be administered concurrently, before or after an IL-17A binding compound of the present invention. See Cua and Kastelein (2006) \nNat. Immunol. \n7:557-559; Tato and O'Shea (2006) \nNature \n441:166-168; Iwakura and Ishigame (2006) \nJ. Clin. Invest. \n116:1218-1222.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypical veterinary, experimental, or research subjects include monkeys, dogs, cats, rats, mice, rabbits, guinea pigs, horses, and humans.\n\n\n \nVII. Uses\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides methods for using engineered anti-IL-17A antibodies for the treatment and diagnosis of inflammatory disorders and conditions, as well as autoimmune and proliferative disorders. Methods are provided for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), multiple sclerosis (MS), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis (CF), psoriasis, systemic scleroderma, allograft rejection, autoimmune myocarditis and peritoneal adhesions (see, e.g., Chung et al. (2002) \nJ. Exp. Med. \n195:1471-78).\n\n\n \nPsoriasis\n\n\n \n \n \nThe skin serves as an important boundary between the internal milieu and the environment, preventing contact with potentially harmful antigens. In the case of antigen/pathogen penetration, an inflammatory response is induced to eliminate the antigen. This response leads to a dermal infiltrate that consists predominantly of T cells, polymorphonuclear cells, and macrophages (see, e.g., Williams and Kupper (1996) \nLife Sci., \n58:1485-1507.) Normally, this inflammatory response, triggered by the pathogen, is under tight control and will be halted upon elimination of the pathogen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain cases this inflammatory response occurs without external stimuli and without proper controls, leading to cutaneous inflammation. The present invention provides methods for treating and diagnosing cutaneous inflammation. Cutaneous inflammation, the result of the cellular infiltrate noted above as well as the secreted cytokines from these cells, encompasses several inflammatory disorders such as cicatricial pemphigoid, scleroderma, hidradenitis suppurativa, toxic epidermal necrolysis, acne, osteitis, graft vs. host disease (GvHD), pyroderma gangrenosum, and Behcet's Syndrome (see, e.g., Willams and Griffiths (2002) \nClin. Exp. Dermatol., \n27:585-590). The most common form of cutaneous inflammation is psoriasis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPsoriasis is characterized by T cell mediated hyperproliferation of keratinocytes coupled with an inflammatory infiltrate. The disease has certain distinct overlapping clinical phenotypes including chronic plaque lesions, skin eruptions, and pustular lesions (see, e.g., Gudjonsson et al. (2004) \nClin Exp. Immunol. \n135:1-8). Approximately 10% of psoriasis patients develop arthritis. The disease has a strong but complex genetic predisposition, with 60% concordance in monozygotic twins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe typical psoriatic lesion is a well defined erythematous plaque covered by thick, silvery scales. The inflammation and hyperproliferation of psoriatic tissue is associated with a different histological, antigenic, and cytokine profile than normal skin. Among the cytokines associated with psoriasis are: TNFα, IL-19, IL-18, IL-15, IL-12, IL-7, IFNγ, IL-17A and IL-23 (see Gudjonsson et al., supra). IL-17A has been detected in psoriatic skin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention, either alone or in combination with other agents, may be used in prevention, treatment, diagnosis and prediction of psoriasis flare-ups. Use of anti-IL-17A antibodies in prediction and treatment of psoriatic outbreaks is described in commonly assigned U.S. Patent Application Publication 2005/0287593 and PCT Patent Publication WO 2005/108616, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.\n\n\n \nRheumatoid Arthritis (RA)\n\n\n \n \n \nRA is a progressive, systemic disease characterized by inflammation of the synovial joints affecting about 0.5% of the world's population. Emery (2006) \nBMJ \n332:152-155. Joint inflammation can lead to deformity, pain, stiffness and swelling, and ultimately to irreversible deterioration of the joint. Affected joints include knees, elbows, neck and joints of the hands and feet. Conventional treatment involves use of NSAIDs to alleviate symptoms, followed by administration of disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as gold, penicillamine, sulfasalazine and methotrexate. Recent advances include treatment with TNF-a inhibitors, including monoclonal antibodies, such as infliximab, adalumimab and golimumab, and receptor fusion proteins, such as etanercept. Treatment with these TNF-a inhibitors dramatically reduces structural damage from the disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention may be used to treat RA in subjects in need of such treatment. Example 16 describes experiments involving the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model of RA, for which data are presented at \nFIGS. 3A-3D\n, and Table 15. The results show a reduction in the fraction of paws with high disease severity scores in animals treated with an anti-IL-17A antibody of the present invention as compared with diluent and isotype controls.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention may also be combined with other treatments for RA, e.g. methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, steroids, mycophenolate mofetil, NSAIDs, or TNF-α inhibitors (antibodies or receptor fragments).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention are used to treat human subjects who have not previously responded adequately to treatment with DMARDs alone. In another embodiment, treatment with the anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention is begun early in the course of disease, without requiring prior failure of DMARD therapy. Such early intervention may be appropriate, for example, once the safety of the antibody therapy has been firmly established.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nClinical improvement is measured by determining the ACR score, as described in more detail in Example 18. In various embodiments, ACR scores of 20, 50, and 70 are the desired endpoint, and these endpoints may be assessed at any appropriate point in the course of treatment, such as 5, 10, 15, 24, 40, 50 or more weeks.\n\n\n \nMultiple Sclerosis (MS)\n\n\n \n \n \nMS is thought to be an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) involving loss of myelin from nerve fibers, resulting in plaques or lesions. The most common form is relapsing/remitting MS in which well defined symptomatic flare-ups occur, followed by periods of partial or complete remission. Conventional treatment options include interferon-β-1a and -1b, mitoxantrone, the tetrapeptide glatiramer acetate, therapeutic alpha-4-integrin-specific antibodies (natalizumab), or small molecule antagonists of alpha-4-integrin (e.g. those disclosed at WO2003/084984).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention may be used to treat MS in subjects in need of such treatment. The anti-IL-17A antibodies may also be combined with other treatments for MS, e.g. interferon-β, interferon-α, steroids or alpha-4-integrin-specific antibodies.\n\n\n \nInflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)\n\n\n \n \n \nIBD is the name for a group of disorders (e.g. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) in which the intestines become inflamed, resulting in abdominal cramps and pain, diarrhea, weight loss and intestinal bleeding. IBD affects over 600,000 Americans. Conventional treatment options include sulfasalazine, corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone), immune system suppressors such as azathioprine and mercaptopurine, or an antibiotic (e.g. metronidazole) for Crohn's disease. Therapeutic monoclonal antibody treatments include etanercept, natalizumab and infliximab.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention may be used to treat IBD in subjects in need of such treatment. Yen et al. (2006) \nJ. Guth. Invest. \n116:1310-1316; Fujimo et al. (2003) \nGut \n52:65-70. The anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention may also be combined with other treatments for IBD, e.g. IL-10 (see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,368,854, 7,052,686), steroids and sulfasalazine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, antibodies of the present invention that do not block binding of IL-17A to its receptor (e.g. non-neutralizing antibody 12E6) are used therapeutically to stabilize IL-17A in subjects in need to prolonged IL-17A activity. Such subjects include patients suffering from infections or cancers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMany modifications and variations of this invention can be made without departing from its spirit and scope, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The invention is defined by the terms of the appended claims, along with the full scope of equivalents to which such claims are entitled. The specific embodiments described herein, including the following examples, are offered by way of example only, and do not by their details limit the scope of the invention.\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\nGeneral Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nStandard methods in molecular biology are described (Maniatis, et al. (1982) \nMolecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual\n, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.; Sambrook and Russell (2001) \nMolecular Cloning, \n3\nrd \n \ned., \nCold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.; Wu (1993) \nRecombinant DNA\n, Vol. 217, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif.).

Standard techniques for characterizing ligand/receptor interactions are available (see, e.g., Coligan, et al. (2001) \nCurrent Protcols in Immunology, Vol. \n4, John Wiley, Inc., New York).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMonoclonal, polyclonal, and humanized antibodies can be prepared (see, e.g., Sheperd and Dean (eds.)

Nos. 5,932,448, 5,532,210, and 6,129,914).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBispecific antibodies are also provided (see, e.g., Azzoni et al. (1998) \nJ. Immunol. \n161:3493; Kita et al. (1999) \nJ.

Immunol. \n165:2214; Long (1999) \nAnn. Rev. Immunol. \n17:875).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPurification of antigen is not necessary for the generation of antibodies. Animals can be immunized with cells bearing the antigen of interest. Splenocytes can then be isolated from the immunized animals, and the splenocytes can fused with a myeloma cell line to produce a hybridoma (see, e.g., Meyaard et al. (1997) \nImmunity \n7:283-290; Wright et al. (2000) \nImmunity \n13:233-242; Preston et al., supra; Kaithamana et al. (1999) \nJ.

(Suppl.) 9:3982s-3990s).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies can be conjugated, e.g., to small drug molecules, enzymes, liposomes, polyethylene glycol (PEG). Antibodies are useful for therapeutic, diagnostic, kit or other purposes, and include antibodies coupled, e.g., to dyes, radioisotopes, enzymes, or metals, e.g., colloidal gold (see, e.g., Le Doussal et al.

Eight week old female Lewis rats (Harlan Sprague Dawley, Indianapolis, Ind., USA) were given a series of injections of recombinant human IL-17A (rhIL-17A) that had been expressed from adenoviral vectors in HEK 293 cells. The injections were given at \ndays\n 0, 14, 32, 46, and 83.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe \nday\n 0 injection was a subcutaneous (sc) injection of 50 μg rhIL-17A, accompanied by intraperitoneal (ip) injection of Freund's Complete Adjuvant. Day 14, 32 and 46 sc injections of 25 μg rhIL-17A were accompanied by ip injection of Freund's Incomplete Adjuvant. The day 83 injection was a combination of an ip injection of 20 μg rhIL-17A in Freund's Incomplete Adjuvant and an intravenous (iv) tail vein injection of rhIL-17A in saline.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA test bleed was performed at day 53. Fusion of rat splenocytes was performed on day 87, using 1.6×10\n8 \nsplenocytes and 1.8×10\n8 \nmyeloma cells divided into in thirty 96-well plates, giving a total of 1.13×10\n5 \ntotal cells per well.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrimary screening of the resulting monoclonal antibodies (thousands) was performed by indirect rhIL-17A ELISA (see Example 5). Secondary screens on the resulting antibodies included neutralization of rhIL-17A-induced expression of murine IL-6 by ST2 (mouse stromal) cells and neutralization of rhIL-17A-induced proliferation of Ba/F3 hIL-17Rc:mGCSFR cells (see Example 11). Approximately eleven of the monoclonals were studied further after the first and second screens. Subsequent experiments were performed to confirm that the candidate antibodies were able to bind to native huIL-17A to ensure that they would be useful in various therapeutic, diagnostic and/or research purposes. Such screening may be done using binding assays (such as indirect ELISA or sandwich ELISA), by in vitro activity assay, or by in vivo activity assay, examples of which are provided herein.\n\n\n \nExample 3\n\n\nHumanization of Rat Anti Human IL-17A Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nThe humanization of rat anti human IL-17A monoclonal antibody 16C10 was performed essentially as described in WO 2005/047324 and WO 2005/047326, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties. Briefly, human constant domains were used to replace the parental (rat) constant domains, and human germline sequences homologous to the rat variable domain sequences were selected and used to provide a human framework for the rat CDRs, as described in more detail below.\n\n\n \nProcedure for Selection of Human Germline Framework Sequences\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following steps are used in selecting the appropriate germline framework sequences in humanizing the anti-human IL-17A antibodies of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n1) Clone and sequence non-human V\nL \nand V\nH \ndomains and determine amino acid sequence.\n\n\n \nHeavy Chain\n\n\n \n \n \n2) Compare the non-human V\nH \nsequence to a group of five human V\nH \ngermline amino acid sequences; one representative from subgroups IGHV1 and IGHV4 and three representatives from subgroup IGHV3. The V\nH \nsubgroups are listed in M.-P. Lefranc (2001) “Nomenclature of the Human Immunoglobulin Heavy (IGH) Genes”, \nExperimental and Clinical Immunogenetics, \n18:100-116. Comparison to the five germline sequences is performed as follows:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nA) Assign the non-human V\nH \nsequence residue numbers according to Kabat et al. (1991).\n \nB) Align the non-human V\nH \nsequence with each of the five human germline sequences. Since the V genes only comprise V\nH \nresidues 1-94, only these residues are considered in the alignment.\n \nC) Delineate the complementarity-determining (CDR) and framework (FR) regions in the sequence. CDR and FR are defined as a combination of the definitions provided in Kabat et al. (1991) (Id.) and Chothia and Lesk (1987) “Canonical Structures for the Hypervariable Regions of Immunoglobulins”, \nJournal of Molecular Biology, \n196:901-917.

This combination of the rat variable domains and human constant domains comprises a chimeric version of antibody 16C10. The sequences of the light and heavy chains of this chimeric 16C10 are provided at SEQ ID NOs: 9 and 10, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWith regard to modification of the framework regions of the variable domains, the amino acid sequence of the V\nH \ndomain of antibody 16C10 was compared to a group of five human V\nH \ngermline amino acid sequences; one representative from subgroups IGHV1 and IGHV4 and three representatives from subgroup IGHV3. The V\nH \nsubgroups are listed in M.-P. Lefranc, “Nomenclature of the Human Immunoglobulin Heavy (IGH) Genes,” \nExperimental and Clinical Immunogenetics, \n18:100-116, 2001.

Lefranc, “The Human Immunoglobulin Kappa Variable (IGKV) Genes and Joining (IGKJ) Segments”, \nExperimental and Clinical Immunogenetics, \n15:171-183, 1998 and M.-P. Lefranc, “Nomenclature of the Human Immunoglobulin Kappa (IGK) Genes”, \nExperimental and Clinical Immunogenetics, \n18:161-174, 2001. The four subgroups also correspond to the four subgroups listed in Kabat et al. (1991) at pp. 103-130. Antibody 16C10 scored highest against human light chain germline Z-A 19 in subgroup II.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOnce the desired germline framework sequences were determined, a plasmid encoding the full-length humanized variable heavy and light chains was generated. Substitution of human framework residues in place of the framework residues of the parental rat antibody 16C10 can be viewed equivalently as the grafting of the rat 16C10 CDRs onto the human framework sequences. The resulting antibody is referred to herein as “16C10wt”, with the “wt” designating the presence of the same CDRs as the parental rat 16C10, as distinguished from the optimized CDRs (having two single amino acid alterations) discussed below. Both the light and heavy chain variable domains were codon optimized, synthesized and inserted onto constant domains to provide for potentially optimal expression. Codon optimization, which may improve expression of cloned antibodies, is purely optional.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the substitution of human constant domain and framework sequences, the humanized 16C10 wt antibody was also modified at two CDR residues to provide for greater chemical stability of the final humanized antibody. The two changes are represented by bolded amino acid residues in the “hu16C10” V\nH \nsequence shown in \nFIG. 1B\n. With reference to the Kabat numbering used in \nFIG. 1B\n, residue 54 of CDR2 was changed from N (asparagine) in the rat antibody to Q (glutamine) in the humanized antibody to reduce the potential for formation of isoaspartate at the NG sequence at residues 54-55. Isoaspartate formation may debilitate or completely abrogate binding of an antibody to its target antigen. Presta (2005) \nJ. Allergy Clin. Immunol. \n116:731 at 734. In addition, residue 96 of CDR3 was changed from M (methionine) in the rat antibody to A (alanine) in the humanized antibody to reduce the possibility that the methionine sulfur would oxidize, which could reduce antigen binding affinity and also contribute to molecular heterogeneity in the final antibody preparation. Id. These single-residue modifications can be represented as N54Q and M96A. The final humanized 16C10 antibody disclosed herein comprises these two substitutions relative to the parental rat 16C10 CDRs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment of the present invention, the chimeric (not humanized) 16C10 antibody is altered to incorporate the two single-residue modifications described above for the humanized form, i.e. N54Q and M96A.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino acid sequences of the light and heavy chains of humanized antibody 16C10 (hu 16C10) are provided at \nFIGS. 2A and 2B\n respectively, and at SEQ ID NOs: 2 and 4 (which include signal sequences). One embodiment of nucleotide sequences encoding the light and heavy chains of hu 16C10 are shown in SEQ ID NOs:1 and 3. Another embodiment of nucleotide sequences encoding the light and heavy chains of hu 16C10 are shown in \nFIG. 5A\n (SEQ ID NO:62) and \nFIG. 5B\n (SEQ ID NO:63).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the interest of clarity with regard to nomenclature, it is important to recognize that the Kabat numbering system includes non-numerical amino acid residue designations (e.g. V\nH \nresidues 83a, 83b, 83c) to accommodate variations in the lengths of CDRs and framework regions among various antibodies. Although this numbering system is advantageous in allowing easy reference to corresponding amino acid residues among various antibodies with CDRs of different lengths, it can result in conflicting designations for specific amino acid residues when compared with strict sequential-numeric sequence numbering (e.g. sequence listings). Amino acid residue designations herein are made with reference to the relevant sequence listing unless otherwise noted, for example by reference to “Kabat numbering”.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs an additional point of clarification with regard to nomenclature, SEQ ID NOs: 2 and 4 (humanized 16C10) include the sequences of N-terminal signal peptides (the first 19 residues of each), which amino acids are removed in the mature form of the antibody. SEQ ID NOs: 1, 3, 62 and 63 include 57 nucleotides encoding the signal sequences. As used herein, a “mature” form of a protein refers to the protein without the signal sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHumanized antibody 4C3 is created by methods analogous to those described above for antibody 16C10. Because the parental rat 4C3 antibody differed only at a single amino acid residue in the framework region of the light chain, and such framework regions are replaced with human germline framework sequences during humanization, the ultimate humanized 4C3 antibody sequence is identical to the sequence of humanized 16C10 antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHumanized antibody 30C10 is also created by methods analogous to those described above for antibody 16C10. In determining the proper human framework sequences to be used, the parental rat 30C10 antibody scores highest against human heavy chain germline DP-46 in subgroup III and human light chain germline Z-A19 in subgroup II, so those framework sequences are substituted for the rat framework sequences. The humanized 30C10 V\nL \nand V\nH \nsequences are provided at SEQ ID NOs: 22 and 23, respectively. In other embodiments, one or more methionine residues in the CDRs of rat 30C10 are mutated to avoid the potential of oxidation of the methionine sulfur in the humanized 30C10 antibody. Specifically, heavy chain residue 34 (in CDRH1) and/or light chain residue 30f (Kabat numbering, see \nFIG. 1A\n) are changed from methionine to another amino acid, e.g. alanine. Such antibodies are subsequently screened to ensure that the methionine substitution does not decrease IL-17A binding affinity to unacceptable levels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChimeric, humanized, and signal sequence-containing versions of antibody 12E6 are created using the methods described herein, by analogy with preparation of such antibodies based on parental rat antibody 16C10. Light and heavy chain CDRs for parental rat antibody 12E6 are provided at SEQ ID NOs: 34-36 and 37-39. Human constant domain and variable domain framework sequences are introduced as described above. In one embodiment, heavy chain residue 34 (in CDRH1) is changed from a methionine to another amino acid, e.g. alanine, to avoid the potential of oxidation of the methionine sulfur in the humanized 12E6 antibody. The resulting antibodies are subsequently screened to ensure that the methionine substitution does not decrease IL-17A binding affinity to unacceptable levels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChimeric, humanized, and signal sequence-containing versions of antibody 23E12 are created using the methods described herein, by analogy with preparation of such antibodies based on parental rat antibody 16C10.

These transgenic mice, referred to herein as “HuMAb” mice, contain human immunoglobulin gene miniloci that encode unrearranged human heavy (μ and γ) and κ light chain immunoglobulin sequences, together with targeted mutations that inactivate the endogenous μ and κ chain loci (Lonberg et al. (1994) \nNature \n368(6474):856-859). Accordingly, the mice exhibit reduced expression of mouse IgM or κ, and in response to immunization, the introduced human heavy and light chain transgenes undergo class switching and somatic mutation to generate high affinity human IgG κ monoclonal antibodies (Lonberg et al. (1994), supra; reviewed in Lonberg (1994) \nHandbook of Experimental Pharmacology \n113:49-101; Lonberg et al. (1995) \nIntern. Rev. Immunol. \n13:65-93, and Harding et al. (1995) \nAnn. N Y. Acad. Sci. \n764:536-546). The preparation of HuMab mice is commonly known in the art and is described, for example, in Taylor et al. (1992) \nNucleic Acids Research \n20:6287-6295; Chen et al.

(1994); Fishwild et al. (1996) and WO 98/24884. Preferably, the mice are 6-16 weeks of age upon the first immunization. For example, a purified preparation of IL-17A can be used to immunize the HuMab mice intraperitoneally. The mice can also be immunized with whole HEK293 cells that are stably transformed or transfected with an IL-17A gene. An “antigenic IL-17A polypeptide” may refer to an IL-17A polypeptide of any fragment thereof, which elicits an anti-IL-17A immune response in HuMab mice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, HuMAb transgenic mice respond best when initially immunized intraperitoneally (IP) with antigen in complete Freund's adjuvant, followed by every other week IP immunizations (usually up to a total of 6) with antigen in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Mice are immunized first with cells expressing IL-17A (e.g., stably transformed HEK293 cells), then with a soluble fragment of IL-17A, followed by alternating immunizations with the two antigens. The immune response is monitored over the course of the immunization protocol with plasma samples being obtained by retroorbital bleeds. The plasma are screened for the presence of anti-IL-17A antibodies, for example by ELISA, and mice with sufficient titers of immunoglobulin are used for fusions. Mice are boosted intravenously with antigen three days before sacrifice and removal of the spleen. Two to three fusions for each antigen may be necessary. Several mice are immunized for each antigen. For example, a total of twelve HuMAb mice of the HCO7 and HCO12 strains can be immunized.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHybridoma cells producing the monoclonal, fully human anti-IL-17A antibodies are produced by methods commonly known in the art, such as the hybridoma technique originally developed by Kohler et al. (1975) (\nNature \n256:495-497); the trioma technique (Hering et al. (1988) \nBiomed. Biochim. Acta. \n47:211-216 and Hagiwara et al. (1993) \nHum. Antibod. Hybridomas \n4:15); the human B-cell hybridoma technique (Kozbor et al. (1983) \nImmunology Today \n4:72 and Cote et al. (1983) \nProc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. \n80:2026-2030); and the EBV-hybridoma technique (Cole et al. (1985) in \nMonoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy\n, Alan R. Liss, Inc., pp. 77-96). Preferably, mouse splenocytes are isolated and fused with PEG to a mouse myeloma cell line based on standard protocols. The resulting hybridomas may then be screened for the production of antigen-specific antibodies. In one embodiment, single cell suspensions of splenic lymphocytes from immunized mice are fused to one-sixth the number of P3X63-Ag8.653 nonsecreting mouse myeloma cells (ATCC, CRL 1580) with 50% PEG. Cells are plated at approximately 2×10\n5 \ncells/mL in a flat bottom microtiter plate, followed by a two week incubation in selective medium containing 20% fetal Clone Serum, 18% “653” conditioned media, 5% origen, 4 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 5 mM HEPES, 0.055 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 mg/ml streptomycin, 50 mg/ml gentamicin and 1×HAT (Sigma; the HAT is added 24 hours after the fusion). After two weeks are cultured in medium in which the HAT is replaced with HT. Individual wells are then screened by ELISA for human anti-IL-17A monoclonal IgG antibodies. Once extensive hybridoma growth occurs, medium is observed usually after 10-14 days. The antibody secreting hybridomas are replated, screened again, and if still positive for human IgG, anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibodies are subcloned at least twice by limiting dilution. The stable subclones are then cultured in vitro to generate small amounts of antibody in tissue culture medium for characterization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the anti-IL-17A antibody molecules of the present invention are produced recombinantly (e.g., in an \nE. coli\n/T7 expression system). In this embodiment, nucleic acids encoding the antibody molecules of the invention (e.g., V\nH \nor V\nL\n) are inserted into a pET-based plasmid and expressed in the \nE. coli\n/T7 system. There are several methods to produce recombinant antibodies known in the art, e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567 which is hereby incorporated by reference. The antibody molecules may also be produced recombinantly in CHO or NSO cells.\n\n\n \nExample 5\n\n\nIndirect ELISA of Anti-IL-17A Monoclonal Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nBinding of anti-human-IL-17A monoclonal antibodies to rhIL-17A is assessed using an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Briefly, a fixed concentration of rhIL-17A is bound directly to the wells of a microtiter plate. The monoclonal anti-IL-17A to be assayed is then is added to the rhIL-17A coated plate, where the antibody is captured and quantitated. A more detailed protocol follows.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA 96-well U-bottom MaxiSorp plate is coated with 50 μl/well of rhIL-17A (0.5 μg/ml) in carbonate coating buffer (the “assay plate”). Carbonate coating buffer is 2.9 g/L NaHCO\n3\n, 1.6 g/L Na\n2\nCO\n3\n, pH 9.4. Plates are incubated covered at 4° C. overnight. Monoclonal antibodies to be screened are serially diluted in duplicate across the rows of a V-bottom plate such that the final volume is 60 μl/well (the “serial dilution plate”). The assay plate is washed three times with PBS-Tween in a plate washer (SkanWasher, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif., USA) and blotted dry. PBS-Tween is obtained by adding 0.5 ml/\nL Tween\n 20 to 1×PBS. Fifty μl from each well of the serial dilution plate is transferred to the assay plate and incubated at 25° C. for one hour. Secondary antibodies are diluted 1/2000 in diluent (PBS-BSA-Tween, which is PBS-Tween with 1 g/L BSA). The secondary antibody for rat monoclonal antibodies is goat anti-rat IgG (H+L)—HRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, Pa., USA). The secondary antibody for chimeric and humanized monoclonal antibodies is F(ab′)\n2 \ngoat anti-human IgG Fcγ—HRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). The assay plate is washed as before. Diluted secondary antibodies (100 μl/well) are added to the appropriate wells in the assay plate, and the plate is incubated at 25° C. for 45 minutes. The assay plate is washed as before. ABTS (100 μl/well) (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, Md., USA) is added, and the plate is incubated at 25° C. for 5-10 minutes, after which absorbance is read at 405 nm on a plate reader (Versamax, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif., USA) with a 5 second shake before reading.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIndirect ELISA results for various forms of antibody 16C10 of the present invention are shown in Table 5. Binding is reported as an EC50 (the concentration of antibody necessary to obtain half-maximal signal). The results show that binding is detected with all forms of 16C10. Although such indirect ELISA assays are useful in quickly determining the presence or absence of anti-IL-17A antibodies, the EC50 numbers obtained may be assay-dependent and are typically not used to assess the absolute binding affinity for any given antibody.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndirect Anti-IL-17A Antibody ELISA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nmAb\n\n\nrhIL-17A (μg)\n\n\nEC50 (pM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 16C10\n\n\n0.025\n\n\n274\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nchimeric 16C10\n\n\n0.025\n\n\n157\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nhumanized 16C10 wt\n\n\n0.025\n\n\n212\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 6\n\n\nELISA of Anti-IL-17A Monoclonal Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nBinding of anti-human-IL-17A monoclonal antibodies to rhIL-17A is assessed using an ELISA as follows. Briefly, a capture antibody is bound to the wells of a microtiter plate, after which a fixed concentration of rhIL-17A is added. The monoclonal anti-IL-17A to be assayed is then titrated versus the bound rhIL-17A on the plate to determine the concentration of antibody needed to achieve half-maximal binding. A more detailed protocol follows.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA 96-well microtiter plate is coated with 100 μl/well of capture antibody (rat anti-hIL-17A 12E6, 0.5 μg/ml) in carbonate coating buffer pH 9.5 (the “assay plate”). Plates are incubated covered at 4° C. for 24 to 48 hours. The assay plate is washed three times in a plate washer (SkanWasher, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif., USA) and blotted dry. The plate is then blocked with 200 μl/well of ELISA assay buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 0.15 M NaCl, pH7.4, 0.5% BSA, 0.05% Tween-20, 2 mM EDTA) for one hour at 25° C. on an orbital shaker. The plate is washed, and 100 μl/well of either adenovirus-derived rhIL-17A or \nE. coli\n-derived human IL-17 (IL-17A) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn., USA) (0.1 μg/ml) is added in ELISA assay buffer and incubated for 2 hours at 25° C. on an orbital shaker. The plate is washed and the monoclonal antibodies to be screened are serially diluted across a row of seven wells in the range of 1000 ng/ml to 0.0813 ng/ml using 4-fold serial dilutions. Plates are incubated for 1.5 hours at 25° C. on an orbital shaker. Plates are washed and 100 μl/well secondary antibody (F(ab′)\n2 \ngoat anti-human kappa light chain—HRP, 1:20,000 dilution, BioSource, Carlsbad, Calif., USA) is added, except for assay blank wells. Plates are washed twice (i.e. two cycles of 3 washes per cycle) with plate rotation between cycles. TMB substrate (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, Md., USA) is added at 100 μl/well and incubated 3-5 minutes on an orbital shaker. Stop solution is added (100 μl/well) and the plate is read for absorbance at 450-570 nm on a plate reader (Versamax, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif., USA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nELISA results for various forms of antibody 16C10 of the present invention are shown in Table 6. Binding is reported as an EC50 (the concentration of antibody necessary to obtain half-maximal signal). The results show that binding is detected with all forms of 16C10.

(Gaithersburg, Md., USA), and was employed to measure the binding of rat anti-human IL-17A antibodies (and one chimeric antibody) to FLAG-huIL-17A. See the Elecsys® immunoassay system, Roche Diagnostics (Indianapolis, Ind., USA). Electrochemiluminescence technology uses a stable ruthenium metal chelate (Ori-TAG) which, in the presence of tripropylamine (TPA), generates electrochemiluminescence upon voltage application. Paramagnetic beads, microns in diameter, act as the solid phase and facilitate rapid assay kinetics. The bead/complex is channeled through a flow cell and captured at an electrode by magnetic application. Voltage is applied and resulting electrochemiluminescence is measured.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nECL assays were performed as follows. Three-fold serial dilutions of anti-human IL-17A mAbs in 50 μl of the assay buffer were made in a 96-well microtiter plate to give 1-3 μg/ml final concentration in the first well. Fifty μl of the assay buffer and 50 μl of biotinylated FLAG-huIL-17A at 50 ng/ml was added to each well, followed by the addition of either OriTag-labeled goat anti-rat IgG (H+L) pAb (50 μl at 450 ng/ml) or an anti-hIgG mAb (50 μl at 500 ng/ml). Finally 50 μl of Origen Streptavidin-Dynabeads at 0.1 mg/ml was added to each well. After 1 hr incubation at 25° C. the plate was processed by the Origen M-series M8/384 analyzer. GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, Calif., USA) was used to plot the data and calculate area under the curve, which is a rough measure of binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults are presented in Table 7 (which includes some duplicate determinations). The two rows showing binding of rat 16C10 to FLAG-huIL-17A represent duplicate determinations. All rat anti-human IL-17A antibodies in the table (1D10, 16C10, 30C10, 23E12) bound to FLAG-huIL-17A, as did the chimeric 16C10. All four antibodies also bound to cyno IL-17A. Antibodies 16C10 and 30C10 did not bind to mouse IL-17A under the conditions of this assay, whereas antibodies 1D10 and 23E12 did.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntibody Binding Determined by ECL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nArea Under\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nmAb\n\n\nAntigen\n\n\nPeak\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 1D10\n\n\nFLAG-hu-IL-17A\n\n\n477474\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 16C10\n\n\nFLAG-hu-IL-17A\n\n\n285792\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 16C10\n\n\nFLAG-hu-IL-17A\n\n\n374445\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 30C10\n\n\nFLAG-hu-IL-17A\n\n\n311752\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 23E12\n\n\nFLAG-hu-IL-17A\n\n\n285145\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nchimeric 16C10\n\n\nFLAG-hu-IL-17A\n\n\n345982\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 1D10\n\n\ncyno IL-17\n\n\n136497\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 16C10\n\n\ncyno IL-17\n\n\n151543\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 30C10\n\n\ncyno IL-17\n\n\n123916\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 23E12\n\n\ncyno IL-17\n\n\n111242\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 1D10\n\n\nmu IL-17\n\n\n252121\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 1D10\n\n\nmu IL-17\n\n\n384999\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 16C10\n\n\nmu IL-17\n\n\nno binding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 16C10\n\n\nmu IL-17\n\n\nno binding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 30C10\n\n\nmu IL-17\n\n\nno binding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 30C10\n\n\nmu IL-17\n\n\nno binding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 23E12\n\n\nmu IL-17\n\n\n143206\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 23E12\n\n\nmu IL-17\n\n\n289185\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDetermining the Equilibrium Dissociation Constant (K\nd\n) for Rat and Humanized Anti-Human IL-17A Antibodies Using KinExA Technology\n\n\n \n \n \nThe equilibrium dissociation constants (K\nd\n) for anti human IL-17A antibodies were determined using the KinExA 3000 instrument (Sapidyne Instruments Inc., Boise, Id., USA). KinExA uses the principle of the Kinetic Exclusion Assay method based on measuring the concentration of uncomplexed antibody in a mixture of antibody, antigen and antibody-antigen complex. See, e.g., Darling and Brault (2004) \nAssay Drug Dev. Technol. \n2(6):647-57. The concentration of free antibody is measured by exposing the mixture to a solid-phase immobilized antigen for a very brief period of time. In practice, this is accomplished by flowing the solution phase antigen-antibody mixture past antigen-coated particles trapped in a flow cell. Data generated by the instrument are analyzed using custom software. Equilibrium constants are calculated using a mathematical theory based on the following assumptions:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n1. The binding follows the reversible binding equation for equilibrium:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nk\n \non\n[Ab][Ag]=\nk\n \noff\n[AbAg], where \nK\n \nd\n \n=k\n \noff\n \n/k\n \non \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n2. Antibody (Ab) and antigen (Ag) bind 1:1 and total antibody equals antigen-antibody complex (AbAg) plus free antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n3. Instrument signal is linearly related to free antibody concentration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nKinExA analysis was performed on several rat anti-human IL-17A antibodies, humanized variants thereof, and sequence variants of these humanized antibodies. IL-17A was derived from either human (“hu”), cynomolgus monkey (“cyno”), or mouse (“mu”). IL-17A from the same species was used in both the immobilized and solution phases for each KinExA determination. Poly(methyl-methacrylate) (PMMA) particles (98 micron) were coated with human, cyno or mouse IL-17A according to Sapidyne “Protocol for coating PMMA particles with biotinylated ligands having short or nonexistent linker arms.” All experimental procedures were done according to the KinExA 3000 manual.

Molar concentrations for the KinexA analysis were calculated on the basis of a molecular weight of 75 kDa for antibodies and 15 kDa for IL-17A to account for the presence of two binding sites on the antibodies and the dimeric nature of IL-17A. For some antibodies, replicate experiments were performed with different batches of antibody and/or antigen, in which cases mean values are provided in Table 9 along with standard errors. Binding constants for the humanized 16C10 wt antibody and the parental rat 16C10 antibody were similar at approximately 5-10 pM, showing that humanization did not significantly reduce the high affinity of the parental rat 16C10 for human IL-17A. Humanized 16C10 incorporating various amino acid substitutions (N54Q, M96A, M100hF), including the final humanized 16C10 antibody (having N54Q and M96A substitutions compared to rat 16C10) were also assayed and found to have similar, high binding constants in the 1-10 pM range. The Fab fragment of hu 16C10 bound retained high affinity (16 pM) compared with the complete antibody. Other antibodies of the present invention (rat 1D10, rat 23E12, rat 30C10) also bound with high affinity to FLAG-huIL-17A, and to cyno IL-17A. Although rat 1D10 bound to mouse with 10 pM affinity, similar to its affinity for human and cyno IL-17A, rat 23E12 had 200-2000 lower affinity for mouse IL-17A (7000 pM). Antibodies 16C10 and 30C10 did not bind to mouse IL-17A (data not shown).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nK\nd \nValues Determined by KinExA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmAb\n\n\nAntigen\n\n\nKd(pM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrat 16C10\n\n\nrhIL-17A\n\n\n6.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrat 16C10\n\n\nFLAG-huIL-17A\n\n\n3.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu 16C10 wt\n\n\nrhIL-17A\n\n\n8.8 ± 3.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu 16C10 [= VH N54Q/M96A]\n\n\nrhIL-17A\n\n\n3.9 ± 2.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu 16C10 Fab\n\n\nrhIL-17A\n\n\n16.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu 16C10 VH N54A\n\n\nrhIL-17A\n\n\n10.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu 16C10 VH N54Q\n\n\nrhIL-17A\n\n\n7.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu 16C10 VH M96A\n\n\nrhIL-17A\n\n\n9.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu 16C10 VH N54Q/M96A/M100hF\n\n\nrhIL-17A\n\n\n10.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrat 1D10\n\n\nFLAG-huIL-17A\n\n\n1.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrat 23E12\n\n\nFLAG-huIL-17A\n\n\n2.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrat 30C10\n\n\nFLAG-huIL-17A\n\n\n11.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrat 1D10\n\n\ncyno IL-17A\n\n\n9.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrat 23E12\n\n\ncyno IL-17A\n\n\n28.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrat 30C10\n\n\ncyno IL-17A\n\n\n32.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrat 16C10\n\n\ncyno IL-17A\n\n\n1.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu 16C10\n\n\ncyno IL-17A\n\n\n16.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrat 1D10\n\n\nmu IL-17A\n\n\n10.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrat 23E12\n\n\nmu IL-17A\n\n\n7,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther methods known in the art, such as Biacore® surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy may be used to measure the affinity of antibodies of the present invention. Although Biacore® analysis was performed on several of the antibodies of the present invention, the binding affinity was generally too high to be measured accurately, specifically, the dissociation rate was too slow to be measured by this method. Such analysis may, however, be of use in the analysis of lower-affinity anti-IL-17A antibodies or anti-IL-17A antibodies having faster dissociation rate constants.\n\n\n \nExample 8\n\n\nSynoviocyte Assay for Anti-IL-17A Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ability of the anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention to block the biological activity of IL-17A (either rhIL-17A or native huIL-17A) is measured by monitoring IL-17A-induced expression of IL-6 and IL-8 in primary culture of human synoviocytes, as follows. Synoviocytes are isolated by collagenase digestion of a rheumatoid arthritis synovium obtained from a knee replacement patient. Synoviocytes are enriched by continuous passage in Growth Medium (DMEM, 10% BCS, 1× Pen-Strep (50 IU/ml penicillin, 55 μg/ml streptomycin), 1× beta-mercaptoethanol (50 μM), 1× glutamine (20 mM), 25 mM HEPES), frozen down at passage number three, and stored in liquid nitrogen. When ready for use in an assay, a vial of the cells is thawed, plated, and the cells are allowed to grow to near confluence. The cells are then passaged 1:2 into larger flasks using typsin/EDTA. When sufficient cells have expanded, an experiment is initiated by trypsinizing the cells, plating into 96 well or 48 well plates, and allowing them to grow to total confluence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIL-17A is diluted to 120 ng/ml, i.e. 4× the final concentration of 30 ng/ml (1 nM). IL-17A is either human (rhIL-17A and native huIL-17A) or from a non-human primate, in this case cynomolgus monkeys (cyno). 100 and 300 μl aliquots of the 4×IL-17A stocks are added to empty 96-well and 48-well plates, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-IL-17A antibodies to be assayed are diluted in Growth Medium to 4× the maximum concentration to be tested in an experiment. The 4× anti-IL-17A stock is serially diluted 1:2 to cover the dynamic inhibition range of the assay. Each of the serially diluted antibody samples (all are 4× their final concentration) are mixed 1:1 with the 4×IL-17A solutions in empty plates to generate mixtures with 2× concentrations of both IL-17A and anti-IL-17A antibodies. These mixtures are allowed to equilibrate at 37° C. in a tissue culture incubator for more than four hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMedium is removed from the adherent confluent synoviocytes and replaced with 100 μl (96-well plate) or 200 μl (48-well plate) of Growth Medium. An equal volume of the 2× ligand/2× antibody solution is added to synoviocytes to give 1×IL-17A (30 ng/ml final) and 1× antibody. Each well (data point) is run in duplicate. Synoviocytes are activated (i.e. exposed to the IL-17A/antibody mixture) for three days, at which point supernatants are transferred to 96 well plates, and optionally frozen, and stored at −80° C. until analyzed. Microtiter plates containing supernatants are thawed and each solution is diluted 1:10 using Growth Medium. Supernatants are analyzed for IL-6 and IL-8 using Luminex bead pairs (Upstate, Charlottesville, Va., USA) following manufacturer's instructions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults are provided at Tables 10 (IL-6) and 11 (IL-8). Values presented with error ranges represent the mean of multiple determinations with the standard deviation. Results for various forms of antibody 16C10 are shown, including a humanized form of 16C10 having the original rat CDRs (“hu16C10 (wt)”) as well as several variants having one, two or three changes in the heavy chain CDRs (generally “hu16C10 X##Z”, where X is the amino acid at residue ## in the heavy chain of hu16C10 (wt) and Z is the new amino acid). “NHP IL-17A” is non-human primate-derived IL-17A, in this case cynomolgus monkey IL-17A. “Native huIL-17A” refers to mature huIL-17A produced when the precursor protein is produced using the natural signal sequence, and differs from rhIL-17A by the absence of two N-terminal amino acids. Concentrations and IC50 values are expressed in ng/ml, but may be expressed in pM units as well. For example, 30 ng/ml rhIL-17A corresponds to 1000 pM (MW=30 kDa) and 70 ng/ml anti-IL-17A antibody corresponds to approximately 470 pM (MW=150 kDa).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIC50 (ng/ml) of Anti-IL-17A Measured\n\n\n\n\n\n\nby Synoviocyte IL-6 Production\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrhIL-17A\n\n\nNHP IL-17A\n\n\nNative huIL-17A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntibody\n\n\n(30 ng/ml)\n\n\n(30 ng/ml)\n\n\n(10 ng/ml)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nrat 1D10\n\n\n105 ± 28\n\n\n65 ± 15\n\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrat 16C10\n\n\n63 ± 7\n\n\n60 ± 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu16C10 (wt)\n\n\n 80 ± 10\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu16C10 (N54A)\n\n\n60\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu16C10 (N54Q)\n\n\n60\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu16C10 (M96A)\n\n\n60\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu16C10 (M96K)\n\n\n60\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu16C10 (M100hF)\n\n\n70\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu16C10\n\n\n70 ± 8\n\n\n70 ± 0 \n\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(N54Q/M96A)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nhu16C10\n \n\n\n70\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(N54Q/M96A/M100hF)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIC50 (ng/ml) of Anti-IL-17A Measured\n\n\n\n\n\n\nby Synoviocyte IL-8 Production\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrhIL-17A\n\n\nNHP IL-17A\n\n\nNative huIL-17A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntibody\n\n\n(30 ng/ml)\n\n\n(30 ng/ml)\n\n\n(10 ng/ml)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1D10\n\n\n59 ± 41\n\n\n38 ± 13\n\n\n40\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16C10\n\n\n38 ± 14\n\n\n33 ± 8 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu16C10 (wt)\n\n\n42 ± 16\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu16C10 (N54A)\n\n\n25\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu16C10 (N54Q)\n\n\n25\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu16C10 (M96A)\n\n\n25\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu16C10 (M96K)\n\n\n25\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu16C10 (M100hF)\n\n\n50\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu16C10\n\n\n38 ± 10\n\n\n38 ± 13\n\n\n50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(N54Q/M96A)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nhu16C10\n \n\n\n40\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(N54Q/M96A/M100hF)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 9\n\n\nNHDF Assay for Anti-IL-17A Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ability of the anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention to block the biological activity of IL-17A is measured by monitoring rhIL-17A-induced expression of IL-6 in a normal human (adult) dermal fibroblast (NHDF) primary cell line. Briefly, various concentrations of an anti-IL-17A antibody to be assayed are incubated with rhIL-17A, and the resulting mixture is then added to cultures of NHDF cells. IL-6 production is determined thereafter as a measure of the ability of the antibody in question to inhibit IL-17A activity. A more detailed protocol follows.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA series two-fold dilutions of anti-IL-17A antibodies of interest are prepared (in duplicate) starting with a stock solution at 40 μg/ml. A stock solution of rhIL-17A is prepared at 120 ng/ml. Seventy μl of the rhIL-17A stock solution is mixed with 70 μl of the anti-IL-17A antibody dilutions in wells of a microtiter plate and incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes. One hundred μl of each of these mixtures is then added to wells of a microtiter plate that had been seeded with 1×10\n4 \nNHDF cells/well (100 μl) the previous night and allowed to incubate at 37° C. NHDF cells (passage 4) were obtained from Cambrex Bio Science (Baltimore, Md., USA). The resulting final concentration of rhIL-17A is 30 ng/ml (1 nM), and the antibodies range downward in two-fold intervals from 10 μg/ml. Plates are incubated at 37° C. for 24 hours, followed by harvesting of the supernatant and removal of 50 μl for use in an IL-6 ELISA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ELISA for detection of human IL-6 is performed as follows. Reagents are generally from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, Minn., USA). An hIL-6 capture antibody (50 μl/well of a 4 μg/ml solution) is transferred to wells of a microtiter plate, which is sealed and incubated overnight at 4° C. The plate is washed three times, and then blocked with 100 μl/well of blocking buffer for 1 hour or more The plate is then washed again three times. Experimental samples (50 μl of the culture supernatant) and controls (serial dilutions of IL-6 protein) are added to the wells in 50 μl and incubated for two hours. Plates are washed three times, and 50 μl/well of a biotinylated anti-IL-6 detection antibody (300 ng/ml) is added. The plates are incubated at room temperature for two hours, washed three times, and 100 μl/well of streptavidin HRP is added and incubated for 20 minutes. The plate is washed again, ABTS (BioSource, Carlsbad, Calif., USA) is added (100 μl/well), and incubated for 20 minutes. Stop solution is added (100 μl/well) and the absorbance at 405 nm is measured.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe IC50 for an anti-IL-17A antibody of interest is the concentration of antibody required to reduce the level of rhIL-17A-induced IL-6 production to 50% of the level observed in the absence of any added anti-IL-17A antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults are provided at Table 12.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnti-IL-17A Antibody Inhibition of IL-6 Production in NHDF Cells\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nrhIL-17A\n\n\ncyno IL-17A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAntibody\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 4C3\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 16C10\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 30C10\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 6C3\n\n\n0.8\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nrat 1D10\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nrat 8G9\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nrat 12B12\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nrat 18H6\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n0.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n23E12\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n0.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n29G3\n\n\n1.5\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n29H1\n\n\n1.5\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n12E6\n\n\n>70\n\n\n>70\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 10\n\n\nForeskin Fibroblast Assay Anti-IL-17A Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ability of the anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention to block the biological activity of IL-17A is measured by monitoring rhIL-17A-induced expression of IL-6 in HS68 foreskin fibroblast cell line. Reduced production of IL-6 in response to rhIL-17A is used as a measure of blocking activity by anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalysis of the expression of IL-17RC (an IL-17A receptor) in a panel of fibroblast cell lines identified the human foreskin fibroblast cell line HS68 (ATCC CRL1635) as a potential IL-17A responsive cell line. This was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence staining with polyclonal goat anti-human IL-17R antibody (R&D Systems, Gaithersburg, Md., USA) followed by phycoerythrin (PE)-F(ab′)\n2 \ndonkey anti-goat IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch, Inc., West Grove, Pa., USA), and analyzing the PE immunofluorescence signal on a flow cytometer (FACScan, Becton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, N.J., USA). As further validation of the model, IL-17A (both adenovirus-derived rhIL-17A and commercially available \nE. coli\n-derived IL-17A, R&D Systems) induced a dose-responsive induction of IL-6 in the HS68 cells with an EC50 of 5-10 ng/ml, which induction was blocked by pre-incubation with commercial polyclonal and monoclonal anti-IL-17A antibodies (R&D Systems).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe IL-17A inhibition assay is performed as follows. A confluent T-75 flask of HS68 cells (approximately 2×10\n6 \ncells) is washed with Dulbecco's PBS without Ca++ and Mg++ and then incubated with 5 ml of cell dissociation medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo., USA) for 2-5 minutes at 37° C. in an incubator at 5% CO\n2\n. Cells are then harvested with 5 ml of tissue culture (TC) medium and centrifuged for 5 minutes at 1000 rpm. TC medium is Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (with glutamine), 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 10 mM Hepes, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, penicillin, and streptomycin. Cells are resuspended in 2 ml TC medium, diluted 1:1 with trypan blue and counted. Cell concentrations are adjusted to 1×10\n5 \ncells/ml in TC medium, and 0.1 ml/well is aliquoted into the wells of a flat-bottom plate containing 0.1 ml TC medium. Cells are grown overnight and the supernatant is aspirated and cells are washed with 0.2 ml of fresh TC medium.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-IL-17A antibodies to be assayed are serially diluted in two-fold or 3-fold steps to give a series of stock solutions that can be used to create final antibody concentrations of 1 to 0.001 μg/ml in the IL-17A inhibition assay. A rat IgG control is used in each assay, as well as media-only samples, as controls to measure spontaneous IL-6 production in HS68 cells. The TC medium is aspirated from the wells of the plate containing the HS68 cells. Aliquots of the various concentrations of anti-IL-17A antibody (0.1 ml of each) are pre-incubated in the wells with the HS68 cells 37° C. for 5 minutes prior to addition of 0.1 ml of 20 ng/ml rhIL-17A, to give a final concentration of rhIL-17A of 10 ng/ml (approximately 330 pM of IL-17A dimer). Cells are incubated 24 hours at 37° C., and supernatants (50-100 μl) are harvested and assayed for IL-6, for example using a human IL-6 ELISA kit from Pharmingen (OptEIA—BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, N.J., USA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults for several rat anti-human IL-17A antibodies of the present invention in the foreskin fibroblast IL-17A inhibition assay are provided at Table 13.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nForeskin Fibroblast Assay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nanti-IL-17A antibody\n\n\nIC50 (pM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 16C10\n\n\n67\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 1D10\n\n\n65\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 8G9\n\n\n29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 29H1\n\n\n247\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 29G3\n\n\n63\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 23E12\n\n\n126\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 6C3\n\n\n192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 4C2\n\n\n107\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat IgG1\n\n\nno binding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 11\n\n\nBa/F3-hIL-17Rc-mGCSFR Proliferation Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ability of the anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention to block the biological activity of IL-17A is measured by monitoring rhIL-17A-induced proliferation of a cell line engineered to proliferate in response to IL-17A stimulation. Specifically, the Ba/F3 cell line (IL-3 dependent murine pro-B cells) was modified to express a fusion protein comprising the extracellular domain of a human IL-17A receptor (hIL-17RC) fused to the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic region of mouse granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (GCSFR). The resulting cell line is referred to herein as Ba/F3 hIL-17Rc-mGCSFR. Binding of homodimeric IL-17A to the extracellular IL-17RC domains causes dimerization of the hIL-17Rc-mGCFR fusion protein receptor, which signals proliferation of the Ba/F3 cells via their mGCSFR cytoplasmic domains. Such cells proliferate in response to IL-17A, providing a convenient assay for IL-17A inhibitors, such as anti-IL-17A antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe sensitivity of the Ba/F3-hIL-17Rc-mGCSFR proliferation assay to IL-17A stimulation makes it possible to perform experiments at relatively low concentrations of rhIL-17A (e.g. 3 ng/ml, 100 pM) compared with other assays, while still maintaining a robust and readily measurable proliferative response. This means that lower concentrations of anti-IL-17A antibodies are required to achieve a molar excess over rhIL-17A in the assay. Experiments performed at lower antibody concentrations make it possible to discriminate between high affinity antibodies that might otherwise be indistinguishable (i.e. experiments can be performed closer to the linear range in the antibody-IL-17A binding curve, rather than in the plateau).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies and IL-17A were filtered through 0.22 μm filters after dilution to working stock concentrations but prior to addition to experimental samples. Four sets of samples were prepared, in duplicate, across rows of a 96-well flat bottom tissue culture plates. As used in this Example, Growth Medium is RPMI 1640 w/Glutamax (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif., USA), 55 μM 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% formula fed Bovine Calf Serum (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, Calif., USA), 50 μg/mL gentamicin, 2 μg/mL puromycin, and 10 ng/mL mIL-3 BioAssay Medium is the same as Growth Medium but without puromycin and mIL-3. All serial dilutions in this Example were made into BioAssay Medium.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following experimental samples (75 μl) were prepared: 1) a serial dilution of Growth Medium (including 10 ng/ml mIL-3); 2) a serial dilution of rhIL-17A; 3) a serial dilution of anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention mixed with 3 ng/ml IL-17A (final concentration after cells were added), including a “no antibody” control; and 4) a “cells only” control with no added antibodies, IL-17A or mIL-3. Ba/F3 hIL-17Rc-mGCSFR cells (7500 cells/well) were then added to bring the total volume to 100 μl/well, and the plates were incubated at 37° C./5% CO\n2 \nfor approximately 40 hours. AlamarBlue® indicator dye (11 μl/well) was added and the plates were incubated at 37° C./5% CO\n2 \nfor 6-8 hours. Plates were then read for the difference in absorbance at 570 nm and 600 nm. IC50 values were determined using nonlinear fit/sigmoidal dose-response/variable slope.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results of the Ba/F3 hIL-17Rc-mGCSFR proliferation assay are provided at Table 14.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBa/F3 hIL-17Rc-mGCSFR Proliferation Assay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmAb\n\n\nIL-17A\n\n\n[rhIL-17A](pM)\n\n\nIC50(pM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrat 16C10\n\n\nhuman\n\n\n100\n\n\n20 ± 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrat 16C10\n\n\nhuman\n\n\n276\n\n\n162\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrat 16C10\n\n\n \ncyno\n \n\n\n100\n\n\n27\n\n\n\n\n\n\nchimeric 16C10\n\n\nhuman\n\n\n100\n\n\n29\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu 16C10\n\n\nhuman\n\n\n100\n\n\n15 ± 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu 16C10\n\n\nhuman\n\n\n100\n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVH N54Q/M96A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu 16C10\n\n\nhuman\n\n\n100\n\n\n27\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu 16C10\n\n\nhuman\n\n\n276\n\n\n149\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu 16C10\n\n\ncyno\n\n\n100\n\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu 16C10 N54Q/M96A/M100hF\n\n\nhuman\n\n\n100\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrat 1D10\n\n\nhuman\n\n\n276\n\n\n223\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nrat 1D10\n \n \ncyno\n \n \n\n\n100\n\n\n19\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrat 29H1\n\n\nhuman\n\n\n28\n\n\n≧30\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrat 4H12\n\n\nhuman\n\n\n28\n\n\n≧400\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrat 29G3\n\n\nhuman\n\n\n28\n\n\n≧400\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 12\n\n\nCross-Blocking of Anti-IL-17A Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nDifferent anti-IL-17A antibodies of the invention may bind to the same epitope, epitopes that overlap, or epitopes that do not overlap, including epitopes that are sufficiently distinct that two or more antibodies can bind to one IL-17A monomer simultaneously. Antibodies that bind to portions of IL-17A critical to receptor binding will block the receptor-mediated biological activity of IL-17A. Such antibodies are referred to herein as “neutralizing antibodies.” Antibodies that bind but do not block receptor binding are referred to as non-neutralizing antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen performing experiments on IL-17A and anti-IL-17A antibodies it is useful to be able to determine the level of IL-17A (or anti-IL-17A) in a sample, such as by a sandwich ELISA. See, e.g., Example 6. In one format, an IL-17A ELISA involves coating the wells of a microtiter plate with a capture antibody, addition of an experimental sample possibly containing IL-17A, and binding of a detection antibody. The capture antibody and the detection antibody must be able to bind IL-17A at the same time.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA similar assay may be used to determine the level of an anti-IL-17A antibody, wherein a standard solution of IL-17A is bound to the wells coated with capture antibody, followed by addition of a an experimental sample possibly containing an anti-IL-17A antibody, and binding of a secondary detection antibody (e.g. an anti-human IgG antibody in the case of IgG humanized antibodies of the present invention). As in the IL-17A sandwich ELISA, the capture antibody cannot interfere with binding of the antibody to be assayed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred pairs of antibodies for use in the ELISA experiments outlined in this Example can be determined by performing cross-blocking experiments. In cross blocking experiments, a first antibody is coated onto the wells of a microtiter plate. A biotinylated second antibody is then mixed with IL-17A and allowed to bind, after which the mixture is added to the coated well and incubated. The biotinylated second antibody may be added at various concentrations (i.e. titrated) to ensure that in at least some samples the antibody is present at a two-fold (or greater) molar excess over homodimeric IL-17A. The plate is then washed and the presence or absence of the biotinylated second antibody bound in the well is determined by standard methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf the two antibodies cross-block there will be a reduction of signal (IL-17A binding) to the plate in the presence of the second anti-IL-17A antibody compared with control samples containing no second anti-IL-17A antibody (or containing an isotype control). Pairs of antibodies that do not cross-block can be used together in assays, such as sandwich ELISAs. Although the dimeric nature of IL-17A makes it possible to use pairs of cross-blocking antibodies in ELISAs in certain formats (e.g. where IL-17A is bound to the capture antibody on the plate prior to addition of the detection antibody), non-cross-blocking pairs of antibodies are generally preferable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention (clones 4C3, 6C3, 8G9, 12E6, 16C10, 18H6, 23E12, 29H1, 30C10, 1D10, 21B12, 29G3) were tested pairwise for cross-blocking. All pairs cross-blocked with the exception of 29G3/1D10 and 29G3/21B12, which pairs of antibodies could therefore be used in ELISAs. In addition to identifying pairs of anti-IL-17A antibodies that can be used in an ELISA, these results show that the epitope bound by antibody 29G3 is functionally or physically distinct from the epitope or epitopes bound by antibodies 1D10 and 21B12. These data also demonstrated that the epitopes for 1D10 and 21B12 overlap with, but are not identical to, the epitope for 16C10.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch pairs of anti-IL-17A antibodies that bind to functionally distinct epitopes are useful, e.g., in validating anti-IL-17A immunohistochemistry (IHC). For example, if a tissue sample exhibits the same pattern of IL-17A expression in IHC performed with two different anti-IL-17A antibodies that bind to functionally distinct epitopes then it is even more likely that the assay is detecting IL-17A, rather than some other spurious cross-reacting protein in the tissue sample.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch pairs of non-cross-blocking antibodies are also useful in designing ELISAs for detection of IL-17A in the presence of therapeutic anti-IL-17A antibodies, e.g. in samples from patients undergoing anti-IL-17A antibody therapy, in which the presence of an excess of the therapeutic anti-IL-17A antibody would block detection by anti-IL-17A ELISA unless the ELISA antibodies were non-cross-blocking with the therapeutic antibody.\n\n\n \nExample 13\n\n\nGene Therapy with Anti-IL-17A Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nThe anti-IL-17A antibodies of the invention may also be administered to a subject by gene therapy. In a gene therapy approach, the cells of a subject are transformed with nucleic acids that encode the antibodies of the invention. Subjects comprising the nucleic acids will then produce the antibody molecules (intrabodies) endogenously. For example, Alvarez et al. introduced single-chain anti-ErbB2 antibodies to subjects using a gene therapy approach. Alvarez et al. (2000) \nClinical Cancer Research \n6:3081-3087. The methods disclosed by Alvarez et al. may be easily adapted for the introduction of nucleic acids encoding an anti-IL-17A antibody molecule of the present invention to a subject. In one embodiment, the antibody molecule introduced by gene therapy is a fully human, single-chain antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe gene therapy approach described herein has the potential advantage that treatment need only be carried out once, or at most a limited number of times, provided that long-term gene expression is achieved. This is contrasted with antibody administration, which must be repeated periodically to maintain proper therapeutic levels in the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nucleic acids may be introduced to the cells of a subject by any means known in the art. In some embodiments, the nucleic acids are introduced as part of a viral vector. Examples of viruses from which the vectors may be derived include lentiviruses, herpes viruses, adenoviruses, adeno-associated viruses (AAV), vaccinia virus, baculovirus, alphavirus, influenza virus, and other recombinant viruses with desirable cellular tropism. Various companies produce viral vectors commercially, for example Avigen, Inc. (Alameda, Calif.; AAV vectors); Cell Genesys (Foster City, Calif.; retroviral, adenoviral, AAV vectors, and lentiviral vectors); Clontech (retroviral and baculoviral vectors); Genovo, Inc. (Sharon Hill, Pa.; adenoviral and AAV vectors); Genvec (adenoviral vectors); IntroGene (Leiden, Netherlands; adenoviral vectors); Molecular Medicine (retroviral, adenoviral, AAV, and herpes viral vectors); Norgen (adenoviral vectors); Oxford BioMedica (Oxford, United Kingdom; lentiviral vectors); and Transgene (Strasbourg, France; adenoviral, vaccinia, retroviral, and lentiviral vectors).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods of constructing and using viral vectors are known in the art (see, e.g., Miller et al. (1992) \nBioTechniques \n7:980-990). Preferably, the viral vectors are replication defective (unable to replicate autonomously) and thus not infectious in the target cell. Preferably, the replication defective virus is a minimal virus retaining only the sequences of its genome that are necessary for encapsidating the genome to produce viral particles. Defective viruses that entirely or almost entirely lack viral genes are most preferred. Use of defective viral vectors allows for administration to cells in a specific localized area without concern that the vector can infect other cells, enabling tissue-specific targeting. See, e.g., Kanno et al. (1999) \nCancer Gen. Ther. \n6:147-154; Kaplitt et al. (1997) \nJ. Neurosci. Meth. \n71:125-132; and Kaplitt et cd. (1994) \nJ. Neuro\n-\nOne. \n19:137-142.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdenoviruses are eukaryotic DNA viruses that can be modified to efficiently deliver a nucleic acid of the invention to a variety of cell types. Attenuated adenovirus vectors, such as the vector described by Stratford-Perricaudet et al. (1992) (\nJ. Clin. Invest. \n90:626-630) are desirable in some instances. Various replication defective adenovirus and minimal adenovirus vectors have been described (PCT Publication Nos. WO94/26914, WO94/28938, WO94/28152, WO94/12649, WO95/02697 and WO96/22378). The replication defective recombinant adenoviruses of the present invention can be prepared by any technique known to a person skilled in the art (see Levrero et al. (1991) \nGene \n101:195; EP 185573; Graham (1984) \nEMBO J. \n3:2917; Graham et al. (1977) \nJ. Gen. Virol. \n36:59).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdeno-associated viruses (AAV) are DNA viruses of relatively small size that can integrate, in a stable and site-specific manner, into the genome of the cells that they infect. They are able to infect a wide spectrum of cells without inducing any effects on cellular growth, morphology or differentiation, and they do not appear to be involved in human pathologies. The use of AAV-derived vectors for transferring genes in vitro and in vivo has been described (see Donsante et al. (2001) \nGene Ther. \n8:1343-1346; Larson et al. (2001) \nAdv. Exp. Med. Bio. \n489:45-57; PCT Publication Nos. WO91/18088 and WO93/09239; U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,797,368 and 5,139,941; and EP 488528B1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the gene can be introduced in a retroviral vector, e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,399,346, 4,650,764, 4,980,289, and 5,124,263; Mann et al. (1983) \nCell \n33:153; Markowitz et al. (1988) \nJ. Virol. \n62:1120; EP 453242 and EP178220. Retroviruses are integrating viruses that infect dividing cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLentiviral vectors can be used as agents for the direct delivery and sustained expression of nucleic acids encoding an antibody molecule of the invention in several tissue types, including brain, retina, muscle, liver and blood. The vectors can efficiently transduce dividing and nondividing cells in these tissues, and maintain long-term expression of the antibody molecule. For a review, see Zufferey et al. (1998) \nJ. Virol. \n72:9873-80 and Kafri et al. (2001) \nCurr. Opin. Mol. Ther. \n3:316-326. Lentiviral packaging cell lines are available and known generally in the art, facilitating the production of high-titer lentivirus vectors for gene therapy. An example is a tetracycline-inducible VSV-G pseudotyped lentivirus packaging cell line which can generate virus particles at titers greater than 10\n6 \nIU/ml for at least 3 to 4 days; see Kafri et al. (1999) \nJ. Virol. \n73: 576-584. The vector produced by the inducible cell line can be concentrated as needed for efficiently transducing nondividing cells in vitro and in vivo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSindbis virus is a member of the alphavirus genus that has been studied extensively since its discovery in various parts of the world beginning in 1953. Gene transduction based on alphavirus, particularly Sindbis virus, has been well-studied in vitro (see Straus et al. (1994) \nMicrobiol. Rev. \n58:491-562; Bredenbeek et al. (1993) J. Virol. 67; 6439-6446; Iijima et al. (1999) \nInt. J. Cancer \n80:110-118; and Sawai et al. (1998) \nBiochim. Biophys. Res. Comm. \n248:315-323). Many properties of alphavirus vectors make them a desirable alternative to other virus-derived vector systems being developed, including rapid engineering of expression constructs, production of high-titered stocks of infectious particles, infection of nondividing cells, and high levels of expression (Strauss et al. (1994) \nMicrobiol. Rev. \n58:491-562). Use of Sindbis virus for gene therapy has been described. (Wahlfors et al. (2000) \nGene. Ther. \n7:472-480 and Lundstrom (1999) \nJ. Recep. Sig. Transduct. Res. \n19(1-4):673-686).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, a vector can be introduced to cells by lipofection or with other transfection facilitating agents (peptides, polymers, etc.). Synthetic cationic lipids can be used to prepare liposomes for in vivo and in vitro transfection of a gene encoding a marker (Feigner et al. (1987) \nProc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA \n84:7413-7417 and Wang et al. (1987) \nProc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA \n84:7851-7855). Useful lipid compounds and compositions for transfer of nucleic acids are described in PCT Publication Nos. WO 95/18863 and WO96/17823, and in U.S. Pat. No. 5,459,127.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also possible to introduce the vector in vivo as a naked DNA plasmid. Naked DNA vectors for gene therapy can be introduced into the desired host cells by methods known in the art, e.g., electroporation, microinjection, cell fusion, DEAE dextran, calcium phosphate precipitation, use of a gene gun, or use of a DNA vector transporter (see, e.g., Wilson et al. (1992) \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n267:963-967; Williams et al. (1991) \nProc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA \n88:2726-2730). Receptor-mediated DNA delivery approaches can also be used (Wu et al. (1988) \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n263:14621-14624). U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,580,859 and 5,589,466 disclose delivery of exogenous DNA sequences, free of transfection facilitating agents, in a mammal. A relatively low voltage, high efficiency in vivo DNA transfer technique, termed electrotransfer, has also been described (Vilquin et al. (2001) \nGene Ther. \n8:1097; Payen et al. (2001) \nExp. Hematol. \n29:295-300; Mir (2001) \nBioelectrochemistry \n53:1-10; PCT Publication Nos. WO99/01157, WO99/01158 and WO99/01175).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe gene therapy methods outlined herein may be carried out in vivo, or they may be performed ex vivo, in which cells are obtained from a subject, transformed with a gene therapy method in vitro, and subsequently reintroduced into the subject. See, e.g., Worgall (2005) \nPediatr. Nephrol. \n20(2):118-24.\n\n\n \nExample 14\n\n\nCassette Mutagenesis of CDRs of Parental Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nOptimization of the CDR sequences of anti-human IL-17A antibodies of the present invention (e.g. 16C10) is performed using shotgun scanning mutagenesis. Alanine scanning mutagenesis is used to determine which residues within the CDRs are most critical to IL-17A binding (see Example 19). The codon for one or more residues within one or more CDRs is replaced with an alanine codon, or an alanine codon is replace with a glycine codon, and the resulting antibody is tested for a relevant activity (e.g. IL-17A binding affinity, IC50 for receptor blocking in a competition assay, bioassay, as provided in various other Examples herein). Codon substitution may be performed by any method known in the art, including but not limited to site-directed mutagenesis (e.g. Kunkel, \nProc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA \n(1985) 82:488) and PCR mutagenesis. Residues crucial to IL-17A binding may also be determined by inspection of the structure of an IL-17A-antibody complex, e.g. an X-ray crystal structure. Antibody CDR residues within contact distance of IL-17A, or which are substantially buried in formation of the IL-17A-antibody complex, are candidates for further optimization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThose residues with the greatest sensitivity to mutation are then studied further, for example by homolog scanning mutagenesis. In this embodiment, conservative amino acid substitutions with homologous amino acids are performed at the target residues to search for antibodies with superior qualities. Non-conservative mutations are also possible, albeit at the risk of disrupting IL-17A binding altogether.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, improved antibody sequences may be generated using affinity maturation, in which selected residues in a CDR are mutated to generate all possible amino acid substitutions at that position. In another embodiment, fewer than all 20 possible natural amino acids are used as substitutions to reduce the number of potential sequences to more manageable levels, while still providing for chemical diversity at each position using a limited number of amino acids selected to be optimally diverse (e.g. representative hydrophobic, polar-uncharged, basic and acidic amino acids), as in WO2005/044853. Such affinity maturation can be performed by substitution with any number of amino acids at a position of interest, including 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, or even more if non-standard or modified amino acids are included.\n\n\n \nExample 15\n\n\nCross-Reactivity with Human Tissue\n\n\n \n \n \nThe propensity of humanized anti-human IL-17A antibody hu16C10 to cross-reactivity with non-target tissues in human subjects was assessed as follows. hu16C10 was preincubated with a biotinylated secondary antibody to form a pre-complex prior to exposure to tissue samples. Antibody complexes (with 20 μg/ml of antibody) were then mixed with a tissue or other sample and incubated to allow binding. Bound secondary antibodies were then detected using ABC immunoperoxidase detection (Vector Labs, Burlingame, Calif., USA). Tuson et al. (1990) \nJ. Histochem Cytochem. \n38(7):923-6. A sample with an unrelated human IgG1 antibody was included as a negative control.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmunohistochemical (IHC) staining was performed with hu16C10 against several positive control target tissues including rhIL-17A protein spots on UV-resin slides (Adhesive Coated Slides, Instrumedics, Inc., St. Louis, Mo., USA), mouse liver cells infected with an adenovirus-encoding IL-17A, and human rheumatoid arthritis tissue. IHC revealed binding (+++) in all three positive controls.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIHC was then performed against a panel of human tissues (32 in all) to assess cross-reactivity. All these human tissue samples were mounted on UV-resin slides. Samples were obtained from three donors for each tissue. The human tissues screened were adrenal gland, bladder, cerebellum, cerebral cortex, colon, fallopian tube, cardiac muscle, kidney, liver, lung, lymph node, mammary gland, ovary, pancreas, parathyroid, pituitary gland, placenta, prostate, retina, skeletal muscle, skin, small intestine, spinal cord, spleen, stomach, testis, thymus, thyroid gland, ureter, uterus, and cervix (uterus). IHC was negative in all 32 tissues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis lack of cross-reactivity has several potential benefits in therapeutic uses of the anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention, such as reducing the loss of antibody due to non-specific binding to other tissues (with consequent reduction in therapeutic effect), and reducing the likelihood of adverse effects associated with binding to undesired tissues.\n\n\n \nExample 16\n\n\nTreatment of Collagen-Induced Arthritis Using Anti-IL-17A Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nCollagen-induced arthritis (CIA) is a widely accepted mouse model for rheumatoid arthritis in humans. Anti-IL-17A antibody 1D10 of the present invention (the parental rat antibody, rather than a humanized forms thereof) is administered to mice expressing CIA to assess the ability of anti-IL-17A therapy to treat rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe procedure was as follows. On \nDay\n 0 male B10.RIII mice were immunized intradermally at the tail base with bovine type II collagen emulsified in Complete Freund's Adjuvant. On Day 21 mice were challenged intradermally with bovine type II collagen emulsified in Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant delivered at the tail base. When the first sign of severe arthritis in the immunized group occurred (post-Day 21), all remaining immunized mice were randomized to the various treatment groups. Animals were treated with either 800 μg, 200 μg, or 50 μg of anti-IL-17A antibody 1D10; 200 μg isotype control antibody; or diluent. Treatments were given subcutaneously on the first day of disease onset in the immunized mice, and then weekly four more times. Mice were sacrificed at day 35 and paws were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin for tissue processing and sectioning. Paws were analyzed by a pathologist for the following histopathology parameters: reactive synovium, inflammation, pannus formation, cartilage destruction, bone erosion, and bone formation. Each parameter was graded using the following disease scale: 0=no disease; 1=minimal, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe. In addition paws were assessed using visual disease severity score (DSS), which measures swelling and redness on a scale of 0 to 3, with 0 being a normal paw, 1 being inflammation of one finger on the paw, 2 being inflammation of two fingers or the palm of that paw, and 3 being inflammation of the palm and finger(s) of the paw. Scores of 2 and 3 are referred to herein as severely or highly inflamed paws.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults are presented at \nFIGS. 3A-3C\n. Each data point represents one paw, rather than an average for all four paws for an animal or an average over all animals. Reduction in the number of paws showing high pathology scores was statistically significant by three measures of pathology (visual DSS—paw swelling and redness, cartilage damage and bone erosion) with higher anti-IL-17A 1D10 concentrations tested (28 and 7 mg/kg). Results with the lowest concentration (2 mg/kg) were statistically significant for bone erosion and reduced for visual DSS and cartilage damage. Similar benefits were observed in reduction of production of cartilage degradative enzymes within inflamed paws (matrix metalloproteases MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-13).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVisual evaluation of paw inflammation, however, may underestimate the therapeutic benefit of anti-IL-17A treatment of CIA mice, e.g. decreased bone erosion. In other experiments, highly inflamed paws (DSS scores of 2 or 3) from CIA mice were analyzed for bone erosion using histopathology or micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). This study was possible because even though anti-IL-17A-treated animals had drastically reduced percentages of highly inflamed paws (see, e.g., \nFIG. 3A\n), there remained a number of highly inflamed paws, and it was possible to compare highly inflamed paws (DSS=2 or 3) from all treatment groups, including the no-antibody controls. \nFIG. 3D\n shows a plot of bone erosion for highly inflamed paws from diluent treated, isotype control (rIgG1) treated, and anti-IL-17A antibody treated animals. Bone erosion, as measured by histopathology, was significantly reduced in paws from animals treated with anti-IL-17A when compared with no-antibody controls, despite their similar DSS scores. The results suggest that sparing of bone erosion may be achieved with anti-IL-17A treatment even in paws where there is no apparent improvement in inflammation as measured by DSS score.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilar results were obtained when micro-CT was used to measure bone mineral density (BMD) for joints in highly inflamed paws in CIA mice. Table 15 provides BMD for paws with disease severity scores of 0 or 3 from CIA animals treated with either an anti-IL-17A antibody of the present invention (1D10) or an isotype control (25D2). Even for joints with the same visual disease severity, 1D10 antibody treated had only approximately half the decrease in bone mineral density observed with isotype control treated animals.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBone Density for Joints in CIA Mice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTreatment\n\n\nDSS\n\n\nBMD (mg/cc)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n25D2\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n95\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n25D2\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n108\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n1D10\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n288\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n1D10\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n299\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n1D10\n \n\n\n0\n\n\n502\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n1D10\n \n\n\n0\n\n\n480\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs with bone erosion, cartilage destruction and pannus formation (proliferation of the synovial lining forming excessive folds of inflamed tissue) were also reduced in anti-hIL-17A (1D10)-treated CIA mice. Histopathology showed that anti-IL-17A antibody treatment not only reduced the number of paws showing severe pathology, but also reduced pathology in paws that appeared equally inflamed based on visual inspection (DSS scores of 2 and 3) when compared with diluent or isotype treated controls.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe observation that treatment with anti-IL-17A antibodies significantly reduced bone erosion in the CIA model of joint inflammation suggests that such therapy may be useful in preventing one of the most debilitating and irreversible effects of RA in humans. In addition, the observation that bone erosion is reduced even in highly inflamed paws suggests that simple visual assessment of joint inflammation may not accurately measure therapeutic efficacy in the lab, or ultimately in the clinic. Measurement of bone erosion may be necessary to track the effects of therapeutic treatments. Such methods include, but are not limited to, standard 2-D X-ray detection, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound (US), and scintigraphy. See, e.g., Guermazi et al. (2004) \nSemin. Musculoskelet. Radiol. \n8(4):269-285.\n\n\n \nExample 17\n\n\nBAL Neutrophil Recruitment Assay of Anti-IL-17A Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ability of anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention to block the activity of IL-17A in vivo was assessed in a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) neutrophil recruitment assay. Briefly, at day −4, five week old female BALB/cAnN mice (Taconic Farms, Germantown, N.Y., USA) were treated with anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention, or an isotype control, by subcutaneous injection of 0, 10, 30, 40, 60, or 100 μg of antibody per mouse. At day −1 the mice were stimulated by nasal administration of 1 μg of rhTL-17A in 50 μl of PBS (or a PBS only control) under light isoflurane anesthesia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt \nday\n 0 the level of neutrophils present in BAL fluid was determined as follows. Mice were euthanized with CO\n2 \nand blood samples were collected, from which the concentration of anti-IL-17A antibody was determined. A needle was inserted into the upper cervical trachea through a tracheotomy and BAL fluid was collected by introduction and removal of 0.3 ml of PBS three times. The BAL fluid was centrifuged (400×g for 10 minutes at 4° C.) and the cell pellet was resuspended in PBS. Total cell counts were determined in a hemocytometer using trypan blue solution. Differential cell counts were performed on cytospin preparations by Wright-Giemsa staining (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo., USA), according to standard morphologic criteria with use of oil immersion microscopy (original magnification×1000). Cell counts were carried out on 200 or 300 cells (lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils) to determine the percent BAL neutrophil.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults are provided at \nFIG. 4\n. Data are provided for three anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention (1D10, 16C10 and 4C3), as well as controls. The percentage of neutrophils in BAL fluid as a percentage of all leukocytes for individual experimental animals is plotted as a function of serum antibody concentration, with the left segment of the abscissa (“0” to “1”) representing controls, as indicated in the legend. The controls show that rhIL-17A stimulus induces significant neutrophil recruitment that is not reduced by administration of an isotype control antibody (dosed at the same levels as the anti-IL-17A antibodies). In contrast, the anti-IL-17A data show a dose-dependent reduction in rhIL-17A-induced neutrophil recruitment, with neutrophil recruitment essentially blocked at serum antibody concentrations above 40-60 μg/ml.\n\n\n \nExample 18\n\n\nTreatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) Using Anti-IL-17A Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nHuman subjects diagnosed with RA who have had an inadequate response to one or more DMARDs are selected for treatment with a humanized anti-IL-17A antibody of the present invention. Subjects are maintained on methotrexate (10 mg/week), and are optionally treated with prednisone for two weeks. Subjects are also dosed monthly with 50 or 100 mg of anti-IL-17A antibody, administered subcutaneously. Doses are adjusted for specific subjects according to standard clinical criteria and on the basis of clinical response.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResponse to treatment is assessed by determining the ACR score, which is based on criteria developed by the American College of Rheumatology. The ACR score is a composite score that integrates multiple clinical parameters and radiographic scores, such as reduction in the number of swollen and tender joints, patient global assessment, physician global assessment, pain scale, self-assessed disability, and acute phase reactants (erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein). See Felson et al. (1995) \nArthritis \n& \nRheumatology \n38; 727-735. A subject is considered to have improved if he or she exhibits a score of ACR20 or higher at week 24 or treatment. In addition, the proportion of subjects achieving various ACR scores (e.g. ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70) can be used to compare treatment and placebo groups in clinical trials to assess the clinical efficacy of the humanized anti-IL-17A antibody of the present invention\n\n\n \nExample 19\n\n\nEpitope Determination\n\n\n \n \n \nAmino acid residues critical to binding of the antibodies of the present invention, e.g. rat 16C10, were determined a follows.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA first set of experiments was based on the observation that rat antibody 16C10 was able to bind human IL-17A (hIL-17A) but was unable to bind mouse IL-17A (mIL-17A) or related cytokine human IL-17F. Each of these three proteins was linked to an N-terminal FLAG® peptide tag (see \nresidues\n 1 to 9 of SEQ ID NO.: 42). In order to identify amino acid residues critical for 16C10 binding, various peptide subsequences of FLAG-tagged hIL-17A, mIL-17A and IL-17F were combined by mixing restriction fragments of the relevant genes to form hybrid polypeptides. Binding of these hybrid polypeptides to antibody 16C10 was determined in an Amplified Luminescent Proximity Homogeneous Assay (AlphaScreen, Packard BioScience, Wellesley, Mass., USA) to determine which segments of hIL-17A were critical to binding. Biotinylated antibody 16C10 was bound to streptavidin donor beads, and hybrid polypeptides were bound to acceptor beads having anti-FLAG® antibodies (Packard BioScience). Donor and acceptor beads were mixed, illuminated at 680 nm, and emission was measured at 520-620 nm. Binding was measured as enhanced fluorescence in samples containing hybrid polypeptides that bound to antibody 16C10 because acceptor beads were held in close proximity to donor beads and emitted light when singlet oxygen from the exited donor bead diffused to the acceptor bead.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results showed that antibody 16C10 binds to hybrid polypeptides comprising amino acid residues 50-132, 63-132, 1-87, 1-112 and 63-87 from hIL-17A, demonstrating that residues critical to 16C10 binding are present in residues 63-87 of hIL-17A (PSVIWEAKCR HLGCINADG NVDYHM). All residue numbering in this example is with reference to the sequence of hIL-17A (SEQ ID NO.: 40). For example, mIL-17A and IL-17F polypeptides substituted with residues 63-87 of hIL-17A were able to bind antibody 16C10, whereas the intact mIL-17A and IL-17F were not.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPoint mutations were also introduced into hIL-17A to determine which amino acid residues were critical to antibody 16C10 binding. In one experiment, alanine-scanning mutagenesis was performed in which an alanine codon was introduced in place of the native amino acid at several residues (45, 46, 51, 52, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 60, 61, 62, 67, 68, 70, 72, 73, 78, 80, 82, 84, 85, 86, 88, 93, 94, 95, 100, 101, 102, 105, 108, 110, 111, 113, 114). Mammalian expression plasmids with genes encoding the mutant forms of hIL-17A were transiently transfected into human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells. The supernatants were analyzed for FLAG® peptide tag quantification and for antibody 16C10 binding by AlphaScreen, as described supra. None of the single amino acid alanine substitutions significantly reduced binding of antibody 16C10. Other point mutations were made in which human IL-17F or mouse IL-17A residues were substituted at various positions within the 63-87 fragment, i.e. L74Q, G75R, V83E, Y85H. Although none of these individual point mutations inhibited antibody 16C10 binding, an hIL-17A. having all four changes exhibited substantially decreased binding, confirming that residues in the 63-87 fragment of hIL-17A, and more specifically residues in the 74-85 fragment (LGCINADGNVDY), are important for 16C10 binding.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSequence Identifiers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEQ ID NO:\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nhu 16C10 light chain DNA with signal sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nhu 16C10 light chain amino acid with signal sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nhu 16C10 heavy chain DNA with signal sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nhu 16C10 heavy chain amino acid with signal sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nhu 16C10/4C3 light chain variable domain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nhu 16C10/4C3 heavy chain variable domain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nrat 16C10 light chain variable domain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nrat 16C10/4C3 heavy chain variable domain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nchimeric 16C10 light chain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nchimeric 16C10 heavy chain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\nrat/hu 16C10/4C3 CDRL1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\nrat/hu 16C10/4C3 CDRL2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\nrat/hu 16C10/4C3 CDRL3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\nrat/hu 16C10/4C3 CDRH1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15\n\n\nrat 16C10/4C3 CDRH2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16\n\n\nhu 16C10/4C3 CDRH2 (N54Q)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17\n\n\nrat 16C10 CDRH2 (N54N/Q/A)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\nrat 16C10/4C3 CDRH3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19\n\n\nhu 16C10/4C3 CDRH3 (M96A)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\nrat 16C10 CDRH3 (M96M/A/K, M100hM/F)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21\n\n\nrat 4C3 light chain variable domain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22\n\n\nhu 30C10 light chain variable domain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n23\n\n\nhu 30C10 heavy chain variable domain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24\n\n\nrat 30C10 light chain variable domain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25\n\n\nrat 30C10 heavy chain variable domain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26\n\n\nrat/hu 30C10 CDRL1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27\n\n\nrat/hu 30C10 CDRL2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n28\n\n\nrat/hu 30C10 CDRL3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n29\n\n\nrat/hu 30C10 CDRH1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30\n\n\nrat/hu 30C10 CDRH2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n31\n\n\nrat/hu 30C10 CDRH3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n32\n\n\nrat 12E6 light chain variable domain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n33\n\n\nrat 12E6 heavy chain variable domain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34\n\n\nrat/hu 12E6 CDRL1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n35\n\n\nrat/hu 12E6 CDRL2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n36\n\n\nrat/hu 12E6 CDRL3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n37\n\n\nrat/hu 12E6 CDRH1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n38\n\n\nrat/hu 12E6 CDRH2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n39\n\n\nrat/hu 12E6 CDRH3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n40\n\n\nhuIL-17A (native)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n41\n\n\nrhIL-17A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n42\n\n\nFLAG-IL-17A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n43\n\n\nR&D IL-17A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n44\n\n\nrat 23E12 light chain variable domain DNA with signal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nsequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n45\n\n\nrat 23E12 light chain variable domain amino acid with\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nsignal sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n46\n\n\nrat 23E12 heavy chain variable domain DNA with\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nsignal sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n47\n\n\nrat 23E12 heavy chain variable domain amino acid with\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nsignal sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n48\n\n\nrat/hu 23E12 CDRL1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n49\n\n\nrat/hu 23E12 CDRL2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50\n\n\nrat/hu 23E12 CDRL3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n51\n\n\nrat/hu 23E12 CDRH1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n52\n\n\nrat/hu 23E12 CDRH2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n53\n\n\nrat/hu 23E12 CDRH3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n54\n\n\nrat 1D10 light chain variable domain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n55\n\n\nrat 1D10 heavy chain variable domain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n56\n\n\nrat 1D10 CDRL1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n57\n\n\nrat 1D10 CDRL2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n58\n\n\nrat 1D10 CDRL3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n59\n\n\nrat 1D10 CDRH1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n60\n\n\nrat 1D10 CDRH2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n61\n\n\nrat 1D10 CDRH3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n62\n\n\nhu 16C10 light chain DNA with signal sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n63\n\n\nhu 16C10 heavy chain DNA with signal sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCitation of the above publications or documents is not intended as an admission that any of the foregoing is pertinent prior art, nor does it constitute any admission as to the contents or date of these publications or documents.

Description\n\n\n\n\n BIARYL COMPOUNDS AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF \n\n\nRELATED APPLICATIONS \n\n\n [0001] This application claims priority to U.S. provisional application no.\n\n\n61/235,316, filed August 19, 2009. The disclosure of the above referenced application is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. \n\n\nFIELD \n\n\n [0002] Provided herein are biaryl compounds. In certain embodiments, the compounds are modulators of type III receptor tyrosine kinase family. In other embodiments, the compounds are modulators of FLT3 and/or CSF-IR kinases. Also provided are compositions comprising the compounds and methods of use thereof. The compounds provided are useful in the treatment, prevention, or amelioration of diseases or disorders related to FLT3 and/or CSF-IR kinase activity or one or more symptoms associated with such diseases or disorders. \n\n\nBACKGROUND \n\n\n [0003] Protein kinases (PKs) are enzymes that catalyze the phosphorylation of hydroxy groups on tyrosine, serine and threonine residues of proteins. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK's) are a sub-family of protein kinases that play a critical role in cell signalling and are involved in a variety of cancer related processes including cell proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis. A class of RTK known as the type III receptor tyrosine kinase family, which includes the receptors \n\n\nPDGFR a, PDGFR β, FLT3, Kit, VEGFR and CSF1R, has been implicated in various proliferative and inflammatory diseases. \n\n\n [0004] CSF-IR (also known as macrophage colony stimulating factor receptor\n\n\n(M-CSFR) or fms) is a receptor for the macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF or CSF-1). Binding of the CSF-1 ligand to its receptor results in dimerization and auto-phosphorylation of the receptor and leads to activation of downstream signal transduction pathways including the PI3K/Akt and the mitogen activating protein kinase MAPK pathways. Activation of CSF-IR leads to the proliferation, survival, motility and differentiation of cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage and hence plays a role in normal tissue development and immune defense. Activation of CSF- IR also leads to the proliferation and differentiation of osteoclast precursors and impacts the process of bone resorption. \n\n [0005] Aberrant expression and activation of CSF-IR and/or its ligand have been found in human myeloid leukaemia, prostate, breast, ovarian, endometrial and a variety of other cancers. A number of studies have demonstrated that the \n\n\noverexpression of CSF-IR is associated with poor prognosis in several of these cancers. In addition, the CSF-l/CSF-lR signaling plays a key role in the regulation of tumour-associated macrophage, which have been postulated to play a significant role in tumour angiogenesis, invasion and progression (E. Sapi, Exp Biol Med, 2004, 229: 1-1 1). \n\n\n [0006] Another member of the PDGFR family, Flt3 (also called Flk2), plays an important role in the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells and activating mutation or overexpression of this receptor is found in AML (See, Heinrich Mini-Reviews in Medicinal Chemistry (2004) 4(3):255-271 , Kiyoi et al. Int J Hematol (2005) 82:85-92). More than a dozen known Flt3 inhibitors are being developed and some have shown promising clinical effects against AML (See Levis et al. Int J Hematol. (2005) 82: 100-107). The Flt3 receptor is also expressed in a large portion of dendritic cell progenitors and stimulation of the receptor causes the proliferation and differentiation of these progenitors into dendritic cells (DC). Since dendritic cells are the main initiators of the T-cell mediated immune response, including the autoreactive immune response, Flt3 inhibition is a mechanism for downregulating DC-mediated inflammatory and autoimmune responses. One study shows the Flt3 inhibtor CEP-701 to be effective in reducing myelin loss in \n\n\nexperimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model for multiple sclerosis (See Whartenby et al. PNAS (2005) 102: 16741-16746). A high level of the Flt3 ligand is found in the serum of patients with Langerhans cell histiocytosis and systemic lupus erythematosus, which further implicates Flt3 signaling in the disregulation of dendritic cell progenitors in those autoimmune diseases (See Rolland et al. J Immunol. (2005) 174:3067-3071). \n\n\n [0007] There continues to be a need for identification of small molecules that inhibit CSF-IR and/or FLT-3 kinases, particularly compounds useful for the treatment of CSF-IR and/or FLT-3 mediated diseases. \n\n\nSUMMARY \n\n\n [0008] Provided herein are compounds of formula (I) or pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, hydrates or clathrates thereof.

Methods for purification of the compounds to produce substantially chemically pure compounds are known to those of skill in the art. A substantially chemically pure compound may, however, be a mixture of stereoisomers. In such instances, further purification might increase the specific activity of the compound. \n\n\n [0047] Unless stated otherwise specifically described in the specification, it is understood that the substitution can occur on any atom of the alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, heterocyclyl, aryl or heteroaryl group. \n\n\n [0048] Unless specifically stated otherwise, where a compound may assume alternative tautomeric, regioisomeric and/or stereoisomeric forms, all alternative isomers are intended to be encompassed within the scope of the claimed subject matter.

Such chiral centers may be of either the (R) or (S) configuration, or may be a mixture thereof. It is to be understood that the chiral centers of the compounds provided herein may undergo epimerization in vivo. As such, one of skill in the art will recognize that administration of a compound in its (R) form is equivalent, for compounds that undergo epimerization in vivo, to administration of the compound in its (S) form. \n\n\n [0051] Optically active (+) and (-), (R)- and (S)-, or (D)- and (L)-isomers may be prepared using chiral synthons or chiral reagents, or resolved using conventional techniques, such as reverse phase HPLC. \n\n\n [0052] As used herein, \"isotopic composition\" refers to the amount of each isotope present for a given atom, and \"natural isotopic composition\" refers to the naturally occurring isotopic composition or abundance for a given atom. Atoms containing their natural isotopic composition may also be referred to herein as \"non- enriched\" atoms. Unless otherwise designated, the atoms of the compounds recited herein are meant to represent any stable isotope of that atom. For example, unless otherwise stated, when a position is designated specifically as \"H\" or \"hydrogen\", the position is understood to have hydrogen at its natural isotopic composition. \n\n\n[0053] As used herein, \"isotopically enriched\" refers to an atom having an isotopic composition other than the natural isotopic composition of that atom. \n\n\n\"Isotopically enriched\" may also refer to a compound containing at least one atom having an isotopic composition other than the natural isotopic composition of that atom. \n\n\n [0054] As used herein, \"isotopic enrichment\" refers to the percentage of incorporation of an amount of a specific isotope at a given atom in a molecule in the place of that atom's natural isotopic abundance. For example, deuterium enrichment of 1% at a given position means that 1% of the molecules in a given sample contain deuterium at the specified position. Because the naturally occurring distribution of deuterium is about 0.0156%, deuterium enrichment at any position in a compound synthesized using non-enriched starting materials is about 0.0156%. The isotopic enrichment of the compounds provided herein can be determined using conventional \n\n analytical methods known to one of ordinary skill in the art, including mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. \n\n\n [0055] Where the number of any given substituent is not specified (e.g. , haloalkyl), there may be one or more substituents present. For example, \"haloalkyl\" may include one or more of the same or different halogens. \n\n\n [0056] In the description herein, if there is any discrepancy between a chemical name and chemical structure, the structure preferably controls. \n\n\n [0057] \"Anti-cancer agents\" refers to anti-metabolites (e.g., 5-fluoro-uracil, methotrexate, fludarabine), antimicrotubule agents (e.g., vinca alkaloids such as vincristine, vinblastine; taxanes such as paclitaxel, docetaxel), alkylating agents (e.g., cyclophosphamide, melphalan, carmustine, nitrosoureas such as \n\n\nbischloroethylnitrosurea and hydroxyurea), platinum agents (e.g. cisplatin, carboplatin, oxaliplatin, JM-216 or satraplatin, CI-973), anthracyclines (e.g., doxrubicin, daunorubicin), antitumor antibiotics (e.g., mitomycin, idarubicin, adriamycin, daunomycin), topoisomerase inhibitors (e.g., etoposide, camptothecins), anti-angiogenesis agents (e.g. Sutent® and Bevacizumab) or any other cytotoxic agents, (estramustine phosphate, prednimustine), hormones or hormone agonists, antagonists, partial agonists or partial antagonists, kinase inhibitors, and radiation treatment. \n\n\n [0058] \"Anti-inflammatory agents\" refers to matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors, inhibitors of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., anti-TNF molecules, TNF soluble receptors, and ILl) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as prostaglandin synthase inhibitors (e.g., choline magnesium salicylate, salicylsalicyclic acid), COX-1 or COX-2 inhibitors), or glucocorticoid receptor agonists such as corticosteroids, methylprednisone, prednisone, or cortisone. \n\n\n[0059] As used herein, the abbreviations for any protective groups, amino acids and other compounds, are, unless indicated otherwise, in accord with their common usage, recognized abbreviations, or the IUPAC-IUB Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature (see, Biochem. 1972, 77:942-944). \n\n\n B.

Isotopic enrichment (for example, deuteration) of pharmaceuticals to improve pharmacokinetics (\"PK\"), pharmacodynamics (\"PD\"), and toxicity profiles, has been demonstrated previously with some classes of drugs. See, for example, Lijinsky et. al, Food Cosmet. Toxicol, 20: 393 (1982); Lijinsky et. al, J. Nat. Cancer Inst., 69: 1127 (1982); Mangold et. al, Mutation Res. 308: 33 (1994); Gordon et. al, Drug Metab. Dispos., 15: 589 (1987); Zello et. al, \n\n\nMetabolism, 43: 487 (1994); Gately et. al, J. Nucl. Med., 27: 388 (1986); Wade D, Chem. Biol. Interact. I ll: 191 (1999). \n\n\n [00131] Isotopic enrichment of a drug can be used, for example, to (1) reduce or eliminate unwanted metabolites, (2) increase the half-life of the parent drug, (3) decrease the number of doses needed to achieve a desired effect, (4) decrease the amount of a dose necessary to achieve a desired effect, (5) increase the formation of active metabolites, if any are formed, and/or (6) decrease the production of deleterious metabolites in specific tissues and/or create a more effective drug and/or a safer drug for combination therapy, whether the combination therapy is intentional or not. \n\n\n[00132] Replacement of an atom for one of its isotopes often will result in a change in the reaction rate of a chemical reaction. This phenomenon is known as the Kinetic Isotope Effect (\"KIE\"). For example, if a C-H bond is broken during a rate- determining step in a chemical reaction (i.e. the step with the highest transition state \n\n energy), substitution of a deuterium for that hydrogen will cause a decrease in the reaction rate and the process will slow down. This phenomenon is known as the Deuterium Kinetic Isotope Effect (\"DKIE\"). {See, e.g, Foster et al, Adv. Drug Res., vol. 14, pp. 1-36 (1985); Kushner et al, Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol., vol. 77, pp. 79- 88 (1999)). \n\n\n [00133] Tritium (\"T\") is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, used in research, fusion reactors, neutron generators and radiopharmaceuticals. Tritium is a hydrogen atom that has 2 neutrons in the nucleus and has an atomic weight close to 3. It occurs naturally in the environment in very low concentrations, most commonly found as\n\n\nT\n2\n0. Tritium decays slowly (half-life = 12.3 years) and emits a low energy beta particle that cannot penetrate the outer layer of human skin. Internal exposure is the main hazard associated with this isotope, yet it must be ingested in large amounts to pose a significant health risk. As compared with deuterium, a lesser amount of tritium must be consumed before it reaches a hazardous level. Substitution of tritium (\"T\") for hydrogen results in yet a stronger bond than deuterium and gives numerically larger isotope effects. Similarly, substitution of isotopes for other elements, including, but not limited to, \n13\nC or \n14\nC for carbon, \n33\nS, \n34\nS, or \n36\nS for sulfur, \n15\nN for nitrogen, and \n17\n0 or \n18\n0 for oxygen, will provide a similar kinetic isotope effects. \n\n\n [00134] In another embodiment, provided herein are methods of using the disclosed compounds and compositions, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, or hydrates thereof, for the local or systemic treatment or prophylaxis of human and veterinary diseases, disorders and conditions modulated or otherwise affected mediated via CSF-IR and/or FLT3 kinase activity. \n\n\n C. FORMULATION OF PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS \n\n\n [00135] The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein contain \n\n\ntherapeutically effective amounts of one or more of compounds provided herein that are useful in the prevention, treatment, or amelioration of CSF-IR and/or FLT3 kinase mediated diseases or one or more of the symptoms thereof. \n\n\n [00136] The compositions contain one or more compounds provided herein.\n\n\nThe compounds can be formulated into suitable pharmaceutical preparations such as solutions, suspensions, tablets, dispersible tablets, pills, capsules, powders, sustained release formulations or elixirs, for oral administration or in sterile solutions or suspensions for parenteral administration, as well as transdermal patch preparation \n\n and dry powder inhalers. Typically the compounds described above are formulated into pharmaceutical compositions using techniques and procedures well known in the art. \n\n\n [00137] In the compositions, effective concentrations of one or more compounds or pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, hydrate or prodrug is (are) mixed with a suitable pharmaceutical carrier or vehicle. The concentrations of the compounds in the compositions are effective for delivery of an amount, upon administration, that treats, prevents, or ameliorates one or more of the symptoms of CSF-1R and/or FLT3 kinase mediated diseases. \n\n\n [00138] Typically, the compositions are formulated for single dosage administration. To formulate a composition, the weight fraction of compound is dissolved, suspended, dispersed or otherwise mixed in a selected vehicle at an effective concentration such that the treated condition is relieved or ameliorated. Pharmaceutical carriers or vehicles suitable for administration of the compounds provided herein include any such carriers known to those skilled in the art to be suitable for the particular mode of administration. \n\n\n [00139] In addition, the compounds may be formulated as the sole \n\n\npharmaceutically active ingredient in the composition or may be combined with other active ingredients. Liposomal suspensions, including tissue-targeted liposomes, such as tumor-targeted liposomes, may also be suitable as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These may be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art. For example, liposome formulations may be prepared as known in the art. \n\n\nBriefly, liposomes such as multilamellar vesicles (MLV's) may be formed by drying down egg phosphatidyl choline and brain phosphatidyl serine (7:3 molar ratio) on the inside of a flask. A solution of a compound provided herein in phosphate buffered saline lacking divalent cations (PBS) is added and the flask shaken until the lipid film is dispersed. The resulting vesicles are washed to remove unencapsulated compound, pelleted by centrifugation, and then resuspended in PBS. \n\n\n [00140] The active compound is included in the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in an amount sufficient to exert a therapeutically useful effect in the absence of undesirable side effects on the patient treated. The therapeutically effective concentration may be determined empirically by testing the compounds in in vitro and in vivo systems described herein and then extrapolated therefrom for dosages for humans. \n\n [00141] The concentration of active compound in the pharmaceutical composition will depend on absorption, inactivation and excretion rates of the active compound, the physicochemical characteristics of the compound, the dosage schedule, and amount administered as well as other factors known to those of skill in the art. For example, the amount that is delivered is sufficient to ameliorate one or more of the symptoms of CSF-1R and/or FLT3 kinase mediated diseases. \n\n\n[00142] Typically a therapeutically effective dosage should produce a serum concentration of active ingredient of from about 1 ng/ml to about 50-100 μg/ml. The pharmaceutical compositions typically should provide a dosage of from about 10 mg to about 4000 mg of compound per kilogram of body weight per day. Pharmaceutical dosage unit forms are prepared to provide from about 10 mg to about 1000 mg and in certain embodiments, from about 10 mg to about 500 mg, from about 20 mg to about 250 mg or from about 25 mg to about 100 mg of the essential active ingredient or a combination of essential ingredients per dosage unit form. In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical dosage unit forms are prepared to provide about 10 mg, 20 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 250 mg, 500 mg, 1000 mg or 2000 mg of the essential active ingredient. \n\n\n [00143] The active ingredient may be administered at once, or may be divided into a number of smaller doses to be administered at intervals of time. It is understood that the precise dosage and duration of treatment is a function of the disease being treated and may be determined empirically using known testing protocols or by extrapolation from in vivo or in vitro test data. It is to be noted that concentrations and dosage values may also vary with the severity of the condition to be alleviated. It is to be further understood that for any particular subject, specific dosage regimens should be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the \n\n\nadministration of the compositions, and that the concentration ranges set forth herein are exemplary only and are not intended to limit the scope or practice of the claimed compositions. \n\n\n [00144] Pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives include acids, bases, enol ethers and esters, salts, esters, hydrates, solvates and prodrug forms. The derivative is selected such that its pharmacokinetic properties are superior to the corresponding neutral compound. \n\n [00145] Thus, effective concentrations or amounts of one or more of the compounds described herein or pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof are mixed with a suitable pharmaceutical carrier or vehicle for systemic, topical or local administration to form pharmaceutical compositions. Compounds are included in an amount effective for ameliorating one or more symptoms of, or for treating or preventing CSF-1R and/or FLT3 kinase mediated diseases. The concentration of active compound in the composition will depend on absorption, inactivation, excretion rates of the active compound, the dosage schedule, amount administered, particular formulation as well as other factors known to those of skill in the art. \n\n\n[00146] The compositions are intended to be administered by a suitable route, including, but not limited to, orally, parenterally, rectally, topically and locally. For oral administration, capsules and tablets can be formulated. The compositions are in liquid, semi-liquid or solid form and are formulated in a manner suitable for each route of administration. \n\n\n [00147] Solutions or suspensions used for parenteral, intradermal, \n\n\nsubcutaneous, or topical application can include any of the following components: a sterile diluent, such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oil, polyethylene glycol, glycerine, propylene glycol, dimethyl acetamide or other synthetic solvent; antimicrobial agents, such as benzyl alcohol and methyl parabens; antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid and sodium bisulfite; chelating agents, such as \n\n\nethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA); buffers, such as acetates, citrates and phosphates; and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. Parenteral preparations can be enclosed in ampules, disposable syringes or single or multiple dose vials made of glass, plastic or other suitable material. \n\n\n[00148] In instances in which the compounds exhibit insufficient solubility, methods for solubilizing compounds may be used. Such methods are known to those of skill in this art, and include, but are not limited to, using cosolvents, such as dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), using surfactants, such as TWEEN®, or dissolution in aqueous sodium bicarbonate. \n\n\n [00149] Upon mixing or addition of the compound(s), the resulting mixture may be a solution, suspension, emulsion or the like. The form of the resulting mixture depends upon a number of factors, including the intended mode of administration and the solubility of the compound in the selected carrier or vehicle. In one embodiment, \n\n the effective concentration is sufficient for ameliorating the symptoms of the disease, disorder or condition treated and may be empirically determined. \n\n\n[00150] The pharmaceutical compositions are provided for administration to humans and animals in unit dosage forms, such as tablets, capsules, pills, powders, granules, sterile parenteral solutions or suspensions, and oral solutions or suspensions, and oil-water emulsions containing suitable quantities of the compounds or pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof. The pharmaceutically \n\n\ntherapeutically active compounds and derivatives thereof are typically formulated and administered in unit-dosage forms or multiple-dosage forms. Unit-dose forms as used herein refer to physically discrete units suitable for human and animal subjects and packaged individually as is known in the art. Each unit-dose contains a \n\n\npredetermined quantity of the therapeutically active compound sufficient to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier, vehicle or diluent. Examples of unit-dose forms include ampules and syringes and individually packaged tablets or capsules. Unit-dose forms may be administered in fractions or multiples thereof. A multiple-dose form is a plurality of identical unit-dosage forms packaged in a single container to be administered in segregated unit-dose form. Examples of multiple-dose forms include vials, bottles of tablets or capsules or bottles of pints or gallons. Hence, multiple dose form is a multiple of unit-doses which are not segregated in packaging. \n\n\n [00151] Sustained-release preparations can also be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the compound provided herein, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, or microcapsule. Examples of sustained- release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl- methacrylate), or poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides, copolymers of L-glutamic acid and ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid- glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT™ (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and poly-D- (-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid. While polymers such as ethylene-vinyl acetate and lactic acid-glycolic acid enable release of molecules for over 100 days, certain hydrogels release proteins for shorter time periods. When encapsulated compound remain in the body for a long time, they may denature or aggregate as a result of exposure to moisture at 37 °C, resulting in a loss of biological activity and possible changes in \n\n their structure. Rational strategies can be devised for stabilization depending on the mechanism of action involved. For example, if the aggregation mechanism is discovered to be intermolecular S--S bond formation through thio-disulfide interchange, stabilization may be achieved by modifying sulfhydryl residues, lyophilizing from acidic solutions, controlling moisture content, using appropriate additives, and developing specific polymer matrix compositions \n\n\n[00152] Dosage forms or compositions containing active ingredient in the range of 0.005% to 100% with the balance made up from non-toxic carrier may be prepared. For oral administration, a pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic composition is formed by the incorporation of any of the normally employed excipients, such as, for example pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, talcum, cellulose derivatives, sodium crosscarmellose, glucose, sucrose, magnesium carbonate or sodium saccharin. Such compositions include solutions, suspensions, tablets, capsules, powders and sustained release formulations, such as, but not limited to, implants and microencapsulated delivery systems, and biodegradable, biocompatible polymers, such as collagen, ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, polyorthoesters, polylactic acid and others. \n\n\nMethods for preparation of these compositions are known to those skilled in the art. The contemplated compositions may contain about 0.001%- 100% active ingredient, in certain embodiments, about 0.1-85%), typically about 75-95%). \n\n\n[00153] The active compounds or pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives may be prepared with carriers that protect the compound against rapid elimination from the body, such as time release formulations or coatings. \n\n\n [00154] The compositions may include other active compounds to obtain desired combinations of properties. The compounds provided herein, or \n\n\npharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof as described herein, may also be advantageously administered for therapeutic or prophylactic purposes together with another pharmacological agent known in the general art to be of value in treating one or more of the diseases or medical conditions referred to hereinabove, such as CSF- 1R and/or FLT3 kinase mediated diseases. It is to be understood that such \n\n\ncombination therapy constitutes a further aspect of the compositions and methods of treatment provided herein. \n\n\n 1. Compositions for oral administration \n\n [00155] Oral pharmaceutical dosage forms are either solid, gel or liquid. The solid dosage forms are tablets, capsules, granules, and bulk powders. Types of oral tablets include compressed, chewable lozenges and tablets which may be \n\n\nenteric-coated, sugar-coated or film-coated. Capsules may be hard or soft gelatin capsules, while granules and powders may be provided in non-effervescent or effervescent form with the combination of other ingredients known to those skilled in the art. \n\n\n [00156] In certain embodiments, the formulations are solid dosage forms, such as capsules or tablets.

For example, the composition can be formulated in an enteric coating that maintains its \n\n integrity in the stomach and releases the active compound in the intestine. The composition may also be formulated in combination with an antacid or other such ingredient. \n\n\n [00159] When the dosage unit form is a capsule, it can contain, in addition to material of the above type, a liquid carrier such as a fatty oil. In addition, dosage unit forms can contain various other materials which modify the physical form of the dosage unit, for example, coatings of sugar and other enteric agents. The compounds can also be administered as a component of an elixir, suspension, syrup, wafer, sprinkle, chewing gum or the like. A syrup may contain, in addition to the active compounds, sucrose as a sweetening agent and certain preservatives, dyes and colorings and flavors. \n\n\n [00160] The active materials can also be mixed with other active materials which do not impair the desired action, or with materials that supplement the desired action, such as antacids, H2 blockers, and diuretics. The active ingredient is a compound or pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof as described herein. Higher concentrations, up to about 98% by weight of the active ingredient may be included. \n\n\n [00161] Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers included in tablets are binders, lubricants, diluents, disintegrating agents, coloring agents, flavoring agents, and wetting agents. Enteric-coated tablets, because of the enteric-coating, resist the action of stomach acid and dissolve or disintegrate in the neutral or alkaline intestines. Sugar-coated tablets are compressed tablets to which different layers of \n\n\npharmaceutically acceptable substances are applied. Film-coated tablets are compressed tablets which have been coated with a polymer or other suitable coating. Multiple compressed tablets are compressed tablets made by more than one compression cycle utilizing the pharmaceutically acceptable substances previously mentioned. Coloring agents may also be used in the above dosage forms. Flavoring and sweetening agents are used in compressed tablets, sugar-coated, multiple compressed and chewable tablets. Flavoring and sweetening agents are especially useful in the formation of chewable tablets and lozenges. \n\n\n[00162] Liquid oral dosage forms include aqueous solutions, emulsions, suspensions, solutions and/or suspensions reconstituted from non-effervescent granules and effervescent preparations reconstituted from effervescent granules. \n\n Aqueous solutions include, for example, elixirs and syrups. Emulsions are either oil-in-water or water-in-oil. \n\n\n [00163] Elixirs are clear, sweetened, hydroalcoholic preparations. \n\n\n Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers used in elixirs include solvents. Syrups are concentrated aqueous solutions of a sugar, for example, sucrose, and may contain a preservative. An emulsion is a two-phase system in which one liquid is dispersed in the form of small globules throughout another liquid. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers used in emulsions are non-aqueous liquids, emulsifying agents and preservatives. Suspensions use pharmaceutically acceptable suspending agents and preservatives. Pharmaceutically acceptable substances used in non-effervescent granules, to be reconstituted into a liquid oral dosage form, include diluents, sweeteners and wetting agents. Pharmaceutically acceptable substances used in effervescent granules, to be reconstituted into a liquid oral dosage form, include organic acids and a source of carbon dioxide. Coloring and flavoring agents are used in all of the above dosage forms. \n\n\n [00164] Solvents include glycerin, sorbitol, ethyl alcohol and syrup. Examples of preservatives include glycerin, methyl and propylparaben, benzoic add, sodium benzoate and alcohol. Examples of non-aqueous liquids utilized in emulsions include mineral oil and cottonseed oil. Examples of emulsifying agents include gelatin, acacia, tragacanth, bentonite, and surfactants such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. Suspending agents include sodium carboxymethylcellulose, pectin, tragacanth, Veegum and acacia. Diluents include lactose and sucrose. Sweetening agents include sucrose, syrups, glycerin and artificial sweetening agents such as saccharin. Wetting agents include propylene glycol monostearate, sorbitan monooleate, diethylene glycol monolaurate and polyoxyethylene lauryl ether. \n\n\nOrganic adds include citric and tartaric acid. Sources of carbon dioxide include sodium bicarbonate and sodium carbonate. Coloring agents include any of the approved certified water soluble FD and C dyes, and mixtures thereof. Flavoring agents include natural flavors extracted from plants such fruits, and synthetic blends of compounds which produce a pleasant taste sensation. \n\n\n [00165] For a solid dosage form, the solution or suspension, in for example propylene carbonate, vegetable oils or triglycerides, is encapsulated in a gelatin capsule. For a liquid dosage form, the solution, e.g., for example, in a polyethylene \n\n glycol, may be diluted with a sufficient quantity of a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid carrier, e.g., water, to be easily measured for administration. \n\n\n[00166] Alternatively, liquid or semi-solid oral formulations may be prepared by dissolving or dispersing the active compound or salt in vegetable oils, glycols, triglycerides, propylene glycol esters (e.g., propylene carbonate) and other such carriers, and encapsulating these solutions or suspensions in hard or soft gelatin capsule shells. Other useful formulations include, but are not limited to, those containing a compound provided herein, a dialkylated mono- or poly-alkylene glycol, including, but not limited to, 1 ,2-dimethoxymethane, diglyme, triglyme, tetraglyme, polyethylene glycol-350-dimethyl ether, polyethylene glycol-550-dimethyl ether, polyethylene glycol-750-dimethyl ether wherein 350, 550 and 750 refer to the approximate average molecular weight of the polyethylene glycol, and one or more antioxidants, such as butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), propyl gallate, vitamin E, hydroquinone, hydroxycoumarins, ethanolamine, lecithin, cephalin, ascorbic acid, malic acid, sorbitol, phosphoric acid, thiodipropionic acid and its esters, and dithiocarbamates. \n\n\n [00167] Other formulations include, but are not limited to, aqueous alcoholic solutions including a pharmaceutically acceptable acetal. Alcohols used in these formulations are any pharmaceutically acceptable water-miscible solvents having one or more hydroxyl groups, including, but not limited to, propylene glycol and ethanol.

Thus, for example, they may be coated with a conventional enterically digestible coating, such as phenylsalicylate, waxes and cellulose acetate phthalate. \n\n\n 2. Injectables, solutions and emulsions \n\n\n[00169] Parenteral administration, generally characterized by injection, either subcutaneously, intramuscularly or intravenously is also contemplated herein. \n\n\nInjectables can be prepared in conventional forms, either as liquid solutions or suspensions, solid forms suitable for solution or suspension in liquid prior to injection, or as emulsions. Suitable excipients are, for example, water, saline, dextrose, glycerol or ethanol. In addition, if desired, the pharmaceutical compositions to be \n\n administered may also contain minor amounts of non-toxic auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents, stabilizers, solubility enhancers, and other such agents, such as for example, sodium acetate, sorbitan monolaurate, triethanolamine oleate and cyclodextrins. In one embodiment, the composition is administered as an aqueous solution with hydroxypropyl-beta- cyclodextrin (HPBCD) as an excipient. In one embodiment, the aqueous solution contains about 1% to about 50% HPBCD. In one embodiment, the aqueous solution contains about 1%, 3%, 5%, 10% or about 20% HPBCD. \n\n\n [00170] Implantation of a slow-release or sustained-release system, such that a constant level of dosage is maintained is also contemplated herein. Briefly, a compound provided herein is dispersed in a solid inner matrix, e.g., \n\n\npolymethylmethacrylate, polybutylmethacrylate, plasticized or unplasticized polyvinylchloride, plasticized nylon, plasticized polyethyleneterephthalate, natural rubber, polyisoprene, polyisobutylene, polybutadiene, polyethylene, ethylene- vinylacetate copolymers, silicone rubbers, polydimethylsiloxanes, silicone carbonate copolymers, hydrophilic polymers such as hydrogels of esters of acrylic and methacrylic acid, collagen, cross-linked polyvinylalcohol and cross-linked partially hydrolyzed polyvinyl acetate, that is surrounded by an outer polymeric membrane, e.g., polyethylene, polypropylene, ethylene/propylene copolymers, ethylene/ethyl acrylate copolymers, ethylene/vinylacetate copolymers, silicone rubbers, \n\n\npolydimethyl siloxanes, neoprene rubber, chlorinated polyethylene, polyvinylchloride, vinylchloride copolymers with vinyl acetate, vinylidene chloride, ethylene and propylene, ionomer polyethylene terephthalate, butyl rubber epichlorohydrin rubbers, ethylene/vinyl alcohol copolymer, ethylene/vinyl acetate/vinyl alcohol terpolymer, and ethylene/vinyloxyethanol copolymer, that is insoluble in body fluids. The compound diffuses through the outer polymeric membrane in a release rate controlling step. The percentage of active compound contained in such parenteral compositions is highly dependent on the specific nature thereof, as well as the activity of the compound and the needs of the subject. \n\n\n [00171] Parenteral administration of the compositions includes intravenous, subcutaneous and intramuscular administrations. Preparations for parenteral administration include sterile solutions ready for injection, sterile dry soluble products, such as lyophilized powders, ready to be combined with a solvent just prior to use, including hypodermic tablets, sterile suspensions ready for injection, sterile \n\n dry insoluble products ready to be combined with a vehicle just prior to use and sterile emulsions. The solutions may be either aqueous or nonaqueous. \n\n\n[00172] If administered intravenously, suitable carriers include physiological saline or phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and solutions containing thickening and solubilizing agents, such as glucose, polyethylene glycol, and polypropylene glycol and mixtures thereof. \n\n\n [00173] Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers used in parenteral preparations include aqueous vehicles, nonaqueous vehicles, antimicrobial agents, isotonic agents, buffers, antioxidants, local anesthetics, suspending and dispersing agents, emulsifying agents, sequestering or chelating agents and other pharmaceutically acceptable substances. \n\n\n [00174] Examples of aqueous vehicles include Sodium Chloride Injection,\n\n\nRingers Injection, Isotonic Dextrose Injection, Sterile Water Injection, Dextrose and Lactated Ringers Injection. Nonaqueous parenteral vehicles include fixed oils of vegetable origin, cottonseed oil, corn oil, sesame oil and peanut oil. Antimicrobial agents in bacteriostatic or fungistatic concentrations must be added to parenteral preparations packaged in multiple-dose containers which include phenols or cresols, mercurials, benzyl alcohol, chlorobutanol, methyl and propyl p-hydroxybenzoic acid esters, thimerosal, benzalkonium chloride and benzethonium chloride.

A sequestering or chelating agent of metal ions include EDTA. Pharmaceutical carriers also include ethyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol and propylene glycol for water miscible vehicles and sodium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid, citric acid or lactic acid for pH adjustment. \n\n\n[00175] The concentration of the pharmaceutically active compound is adjusted so that an injection provides an effective amount to produce the desired \n\n\npharmacological effect. The exact dose depends on the age, weight and condition of the patient or animal as is known in the art. \n\n\n [00176] The unit-dose parenteral preparations are packaged in an ampule, a vial or a syringe with a needle. All preparations for parenteral administration must be sterile, as is known and practiced in the art. \n\n [00177] Illustratively, intravenous or intraarterial infusion of a sterile aqueous solution containing an active compound is an effective mode of administration. \n\n\nAnother embodiment is a sterile aqueous or oily solution or suspension containing an active material injected as necessary to produce the desired pharmacological effect. \n\n\n[00178] Injectables are designed for local and systemic administration. \n\n\n Typically a therapeutically effective dosage is formulated to contain a concentration of at least about 0.1% w/w up to about 90%> w/w or more, such as more than 1% w/w of the active compound to the treated tissue(s). The active ingredient may be administered at once, or may be divided into a number of smaller doses to be administered at intervals of time. It is understood that the precise dosage and duration of treatment is a function of the tissue being treated and may be determined empirically using known testing protocols or by extrapolation from in vivo or in vitro test data. It is to be noted that concentrations and dosage values may also vary with the age of the individual treated. It is to be further understood that for any particular subject, specific dosage regimens should be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the formulations, and that the concentration ranges set forth herein are exemplary only and are not intended to limit the scope or practice of the claimed formulations. \n\n\n [00179] The compound may be suspended in micronized or other suitable form or may be derivatized to produce a more soluble active product or to produce a prodrug. The form of the resulting mixture depends upon a number of factors, including the intended mode of administration and the solubility of the compound in the selected carrier or vehicle. The effective concentration is sufficient for ameliorating the symptoms of the condition and may be empirically determined. \n\n\n 3. Lyophilized powders \n\n\n[00180] Of interest herein are also lyophilized powders, which can be reconstituted for administration as solutions, emulsions and other mixtures. They may also be reconstituted and formulated as solids or gels. \n\n\n [00181] The sterile, lyophilized powder is prepared by dissolving a compound provided herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, in a suitable solvent. The solvent may contain an excipient which improves the stability or other pharmacological component of the powder or reconstituted solution, prepared from the powder. Excipients that may be used include, but are not limited to, dextrose, \n\n sorbital, fructose, corn syrup, xylitol, glycerin, glucose, sucrose, hydroxypropyl-beta- cyclodextrin (HPBCD) or other suitable agent. The solvent may also contain a buffer, such as citrate, sodium or potassium phosphate or other such buffer known to those of skill in the art at, typically, about neutral pH. Subsequent sterile filtration of the solution followed by lyophilization under standard conditions known to those of skill in the art provides the desired formulation. Generally, the resulting solution will be apportioned into vials for lyophilization. Each vial will contain a single dosage (10- 1000 mg, 100-500 mg, 10-500 mg, 50-250 mg or 25-100 mg) or multiple dosages of the compound. The lyophilized powder can be stored under appropriate conditions, such as at about 4°C to room temperature. \n\n\n [00182] Reconstitution of this lyophilized powder with water for injection provides a formulation for use in parenteral administration. For reconstitution, about 1-50 mg, about 5-35 mg, or about 9-30 mg of lyophilized powder, is added per mL of sterile water or other suitable carrier. The precise amount depends upon the selected compound. Such amount can be empirically determined. \n\n\n 4. Topical administration \n\n\n[00183] Topical mixtures are prepared as described for the local and systemic administration. The resulting mixture may be a solution, suspension, emulsions or the like and are formulated as creams, gels, ointments, emulsions, solutions, elixirs, lotions, suspensions, tinctures, pastes, foams, aerosols, irrigations, sprays, \n\n\nsuppositories, bandages, dermal patches or any other formulations suitable for topical administration. \n\n\n [00184] The compounds or pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof may be formulated as aerosols for topical application, such as by inhalation. These formulations for administration to the respiratory tract can be in the form of an aerosol or solution for a nebulizer, or as a microfine powder for insufflation, alone or in combination with an inert carrier such as lactose. In such a case, the particles of the formulation will typically have diameters of less than 50 microns or less than 10 microns. \n\n\n [00185] The compounds may be formulated for local or topical application, such as for topical application to the skin and mucous membranes, such as in the eye, in the form of gels, creams, and lotions and for application to the eye or for intracisternal or intraspinal application. Topical administration is contemplated for \n\n transdermal delivery and also for administration to the eyes or mucosa, or for inhalation therapies. Nasal solutions of the active compound alone or in combination with other pharmaceutically acceptable excipients can also be administered. \n\n\n[00186] These solutions, particularly those intended for ophthalmic use, may be formulated as 0.01% - 10% isotonic solutions, pH about 5-7, with appropriate salts. \n\n\n 5. Compositions for other routes of administration \n\n\n[00187] Other routes of administration, such as topical application, transdermal patches, and rectal administration are also contemplated herein. \n\n\n [00188] For example, pharmaceutical dosage forms for rectal administration are rectal suppositories, capsules and tablets for systemic effect. Rectal suppositories are used herein mean solid bodies for insertion into the rectum which melt or soften at body temperature releasing one or more pharmacologically or therapeutically active ingredients. Pharmaceutically acceptable substances utilized in rectal suppositories are bases or vehicles and agents to raise the melting point. Examples of bases include cocoa butter (theobroma oil), glycerin-gelatin, carbowax (polyoxyethylene glycol) and appropriate mixtures of mono-, di- and triglycerides of fatty acids. Combinations of the various bases may be used. Agents to raise the melting point of suppositories include spermaceti and wax. Rectal suppositories may be prepared either by the compressed method or by molding. The typical weight of a rectal suppository is about 2 to 3 gm. \n\n\n [00189] Tablets and capsules for rectal administration are manufactured using the same pharmaceutically acceptable substance and by the same methods as for formulations for oral administration. \n\n\n 6. Sustained Release Compositions \n\n\n [00190] Active ingredients provided herein can be administered by controlled release means or by delivery devices that are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Examples include, but are not limited to, those described in U.S. Patent Nos.: 3,845,770; 3,916,899; 3,536,809; 3,598,123; and 4,008,719, 5,674,533, 5,059,595, 5,591,767, 5,120,548, 5,073,543, 5,639,476, 5,354,556, 5,639,480, 5,733,566, 5,739,108, 5,891,474, 5,922,356, 5,972,891, 5,980,945, 5,993,855, 6,045,830, 6,087,324, 6,113,943, 6,197,350, 6,248,363, 6,264,970, 6,267,981, \n\n\n6,376,461,6,419,961, 6,589,548, 6,613,358, 6,699,500 and 6,740,634, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Such dosage forms can be used to provide slow or controlled-release of one or more active ingredients using, for example, \n\n hydropropylmethyl cellulose, other polymer matrices, gels, permeable membranes, osmotic systems, multilayer coatings, microparticles, liposomes, microspheres, or a combination thereof to provide the desired release profile in varying proportions. Suitable controlled-release formulations known to those of ordinary skill in the art, including those described herein, can be readily selected for use with the active ingredients provided herein. \n\n\n [00191] All controlled-release pharmaceutical products have a common goal of improving drug therapy over that achieved by their non-controlled counterparts. Ideally, the use of an optimally designed controlled-release preparation in medical treatment is characterized by a minimum of drug substance being employed to cure or control the condition in a minimum amount of time. Advantages of controlled-release formulations include extended activity of the drug, reduced dosage frequency, and increased patient compliance. In addition, controlled-release formulations can be used to affect the time of onset of action or other characteristics, such as blood levels of the drug, and can thus affect the occurrence of side (e.g., adverse) effects. \n\n\n[00192] Most controlled-release formulations are designed to initially release an amount of drug (active ingredient) that promptly produces the desired therapeutic effect, and gradually and continually release of other amounts of drug to maintain this level of therapeutic or prophylactic effect over an extended period of time. In order to maintain this constant level of drug in the body, the drug must be released from the dosage form at a rate that will replace the amount of drug being metabolized and excreted from the body. Controlled-release of an active ingredient can be stimulated by various conditions including, but not limited to, pH, temperature, enzymes, water, or other physiological conditions or compounds. \n\n\n [00193] In certain embodiments, the agent may be administered using intravenous infusion, an implantable osmotic pump, a transdermal patch, liposomes, or other modes of administration. In one embodiment, a pump may be used. In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used. In yet another embodiment, a controlled release system can be placed in proximity of the therapeutic target, i.e., thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose. In some embodiments, a controlled release device is introduced into a subject in proximity of the site of inappropriate immune activation or a tumor. The active ingredient can be dispersed in a solid inner matrix, e.g., polymethylmethacrylate, polybutylmethacrylate, plasticized or unplasticized polyvinylchloride, plasticized nylon, plasticized \n\n polyethyleneterephthalate, natural rubber, polyisoprene, polyisobutylene, polybutadiene, polyethylene, ethylene-vinylacetate copolymers, silicone rubbers, polydimethylsiloxanes, silicone carbonate copolymers, hydrophilic polymers such as hydrogels of esters of acrylic and methacrylic acid, collagen, cross-linked \n\n\npolyvinylalcohol and cross-linked partially hydrolyzed polyvinyl acetate, that is surrounded by an outer polymeric membrane, e.g., polyethylene, polypropylene, ethylene/propylene copolymers, ethylene/ethyl acrylate copolymers, \n\n\nethylene/vinylacetate copolymers, silicone rubbers, polydimethyl siloxanes, neoprene rubber, chlorinated polyethylene, polyvinylchloride, vinylchloride copolymers with vinyl acetate, vinylidene chloride, ethylene and propylene, ionomer polyethylene terephthalate, butyl rubber epichlorohydrin rubbers, ethylene/vinyl alcohol copolymer, ethylene/vinyl acetate/vinyl alcohol terpolymer, and \n\n\nethylene/vinyloxyethanol copolymer, that is insoluble in body fluids. The active ingredient then diffuses through the outer polymeric membrane in a release rate controlling step. The percentage of active ingredient contained in such parenteral compositions is highly dependent on the specific nature thereof, as well as the needs of the subject. \n\n\n 7. Targeted Formulations \n\n\n[00194] The compounds provided herein, or pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof, may also be formulated to be targeted to a particular tissue, receptor, or other area of the body of the subject to be treated. Many such targeting methods are well known to those of skill in the art. All such targeting methods are contemplated herein for use in the instant compositions. For non-limiting examples of targeting methods, see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 6,316,652, 6,274,552, 6,271,359, 6,253,872, 6,139,865, 6,131,570, 6,120,751, 6,071,495, 6,060,082, 6,048,736, 6,039,975, 6,004,534, 5,985,307, 5,972,366, 5,900,252, 5,840,674, 5,759,542 and 5,709,874. \n\n\n [00195] In one embodiment, liposomal suspensions, including tissue-targeted liposomes, such as tumor-targeted liposomes, may also be suitable as \n\n\npharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These may be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art. Briefly, liposomes such as multilamellar vesicles (MLV's) may be formed by drying down egg phosphatidyl choline and brain phosphatidyl serine (7:3 molar ratio) on the inside of a flask. A solution of a compound provided herein in phosphate buffered saline lacking divalent cations \n\n (PBS) is added and the flask shaken until the lipid film is dispersed. The resulting vesicles are washed to remove unencapsulated compound, pelleted by centrifugation, and then resuspended in PBS. \n\n\n D. EVALUATION OF THE ACTIVITY OF THE COMPOUNDS \n\n\n[00196] Standard physiological, pharmacological and biochemical procedures are available for testing the compounds to identify those that possess biological activities that modulate the activity of FLT3 and/or CSF-IR kinases. \n\n\n [00197] Such assays include, for example, biochemical assays such as binding assays, radioactivity incorporation assays, as well as a variety of cell based assays. \n\n\n[00198] In certain embodiments, the compounds disclosed herein are tested in an M-NFS-60 cell proliferation assay to determine their cellular potency against CSF- IR. M-NFS-60s are mouse monocytic cells that depend on the binding of the ligand M-CSF to its receptor, CSF-IR, to proliferate. Inhibition of CSF-IR kinase activity will cause reduced growth and/or cell death. This assay assesses the potency of compounds as CSF-IR inhibitors by measuring the reduction of Alamar Blue reagent by viable cells. An exemplary assay is described in the Examples section. \n\n\n[00199] In certain embodiments, competition binding assays were performed as described in Fabian et al, Nature Biotechnology 2005, 23,329-336. \n\n\n E.

It is to be understood that for any particular subject, specific dosage regimens should be adjusted over time to meet individual needs, and will vary depending upon absorption, inactivation and excretion rates of the drug. The concentrations set forth here are exemplary only and are not intended to limit the scope or practice of the claimed composition. The active ingredient may be administered all at once, or may be divided into a number of smaller doses to be administered at varying intervals of time. \n\n\n[00229] The subject matter has been described in an illustrative manner, and it is to be understood that the terminology used is intended to be in the nature of description rather than of limitation.

PREPARATION OF COMPOUNDS \n\n\n[00237] Starting materials in the synthesis examples provided herein are either available from commercial sources or via literature procedures either as cited or as found, for example in March Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure, (1992) 4th Ed.; Wiley Interscience, New York. All commercially available compounds were used without further purification unless otherwise indicated. Proton (1H) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 300 MHz NMR spectrometer. Significant peaks are tabulated and typically include: number of protons, and multiplicity (s, singlet; d, double; t, triplet; q, quartet; m, multiplet; br s, broad singlet). Chemical shifts are reported as parts per million (δ) downfield relative to tetramethylsilane. Low resolution mass spectra (MS) were obtained as electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectra, which were recorded on a Shimadzu HPLC/MS instrument using reverse-phase conditions (acetonitrile/water, 0.05% acetic acid). Preparative HPLC was performed using Varian HPLC systems and Phenomenex columns. \n\n\n [00238] It is understood that in the following description, combinations of substituents and/or variables of the depicted formulae are permissible only if such contributions result in stable compounds under standard conditions. \n\n\n[00239] It will also be appreciated by those skilled in the art that in the process described below, the functional groups of intermediate compounds may need to be protected by suitable protecting groups. Such functional groups include hydroxy, \n\n amino, mercapto and carboxylic acid. Suitable protecting groups for hydroxy include trialkylsilyl or diarylalkylsilyl (e.g., t-butyldimethylsilyl, t-butyldiphenylsilyl or trimethylsilyl), tetrahydropyranyl, benzyl, and the like. Suitable protecting groups for amino, amidino and guanidino include t-butoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, and the like. Suitable protecting groups for mercapto include -C(0)-R (where R is alkyl, aryl or aralkyl), 7-methoxybenzyl, trityl and the like. Suitable protecting groups for carboxylic acid include alkyl, aryl or aralkyl esters. \n\n\n [00240] Protecting groups may be added or removed in accordance with standard techniques, which are well-known to those skilled in the art and as described herein. The use of protecting groups is described in detail in Green, T.W. and P.G.M. Wutz, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis (1991), 2nd Ed., Wiley-Interscience. \n\n\n[00241] One of ordinary skill in the art could easily ascertain which choices for each substituent are possible for the reaction conditions of each Scheme. Moreover, the substituents are selected from components as indicated in the specification heretofore, and may be attached to starting materials, intermediates, and/or final products according to schemes known to those of ordinary skill in the art. \n\n\n[00242] Also it will be apparent that the compounds provided herein could exist as one or more isomers, that is, E/Z isomers, enantiomers and/or diastereomers. Compounds of formula (I) may be generally prepared as depicted in the following schemes, unless otherwise noted, the various substituents are as defined elsewhere herein. \n\n\n [00243] Standard abbreviations and acronyms as defined in J Org. Chem. 2007\n\n\n72(1): 23A-24A are used herein.

The commercially available appropriately substituted 5-bromo-2-fluoroazine derivatives 14 undergo a nucleophilic substitution at elevated temperature with appropriate amines (15) in solvents such as DMSO or i-PrOH and using bases such as DIEA to give substituted aminoazine derivatives 16.

The readily available appropriately substituted 2-fluoroazine derivatives 18 undergo a \n\n\nnucleophilic substitution at elevated temperature with appropriate alcohols (19) in solvents such as DMF and using bases such as sodium hydride or potassium t- butoxide to give substituted alkoxyazine derivatives 19. Compounds 19 can subsequently be transformed to the desired compounds 20 as described in Scheme 1 for conversion of compounds 3 to compounds 6. \n\n\nScheme 5: General synthesis of substituted Biaryl aryl ureas. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n : N, CH, CR' A^ = N, CH, CR\n\n\n: N, CH, CR : N, CH, CR\n1\n A\n3\n = N, CH, CR\n'\n \n\n\n [00249] In an illustrative method, aminoalkylpyrimidine derivatives may be routinely prepared according to the synthetic routes outlined in Scheme 6. The readily available appropriately substituted (Z)-2-(4'-nitrophenyl)-3-N,N- dimethylaminopropenals (21) and 2-aminoacetamidine hydrochlorides (22) were condensed in solvents such as, but not limited to, EtOH to form the pyrimidine derivatives 23. Reduction of the nitro groups could be realized optionally at elevated temperatures using reducing systems such as SnCl\n2\n in an alcohol solvent or metallic iron or tin under acidic conditions, or hydrogenation in the presence of transition metal catalysts. Compounds 24 can subsequently be transformed to compounds of formula (I) as described in Scheme 1 for conversion of compounds 4 to compounds 6. Scheme 6: General synthesis of aminoalkylpyrimidine derivatives. \n\n\n\n\n\n [00250] In an illustrative method, aminoalkylazine derivatives may also be routinely prepared according to the synthetic routes outlined in Scheme 7. The readily available 5-bromo-2-iodoazines (25) are coupled with alkynes 26 using a Sonogashira coupling protocol to give the alkynylazine derivatives 26, which are then coupled with appropriately substituted 4-(tert-butoxycarbonylamino)phenylboronic acids 2 using a Pd-catalyzed Suzuki coupling protocol to give the biaryl derivatives 27. The reduction of the alkynes of 27 to alkanes 28 can be realized using palladium on carbon under a hydrogen atmosphere in solvents such as, but not limited to, MeOH or EtOH. The THP group of 28 can be removed with mild acid, such as, but not limited to, pyridinium 7-toluenesulfonate, to give the alcohols 29. Activation of the alcohols 29 with methanesulfonic anhydride or methanesulfonyl chloride and bases such as TEA, followed by substitution with amines (30) affords derivatives 31. The tert-butyl \n\n carbamate of 31 can then be removed to give the anilines 32 using acids in solvents, such as TFA in DCM or 4N HCl in 1,4-dioxane.

Scheme 8 shows one example where R\n~\nNH\n2\n is 5- substituted-3-aminoisoxazole, whereby an appropriate 3-oxonitrile (35) is treated with hydroxylamine under appropriate conditions of pH and temperature which are described, for example, in Takase et al. Heterocycles 1991 32(6), 1153-1 158, to afford the desired aryl amine product (36). This method is particularly applicable for cases in which the atom of R\n9\n directly attached to the aromatic ring is highly substituted, for example, is an α,α-dialkyl substituent (See Takase et al. Heterocycles \n\n 1991 32(6), 1153-1158). The requisite 3-oxonitriles (35) can be prepared by reaction of an R\n9\n-containing carboxylic ester (33) with an akali metal salt of acetonitrile (34) (See, for example, US 4,728,743). \n\n\n Scheme 8: General synthesis of 3-aminoisoxazole derivatives. \n\n\n O „ NH\n2\nOH \n\n\n qX -lower alkyl + V\nM\n CN *~ \\ /\n\n\nR\n9 y CN\n N Solvent, heat O-N \n\n\n .. .. .. . . pH control\n\n\nM = alkali metal \nK\n \n\n\n 33 34 35 36 \n\n\n [00252] Scheme 9 shows an example for the synthesis of aryl amine derivatives\n\n\nR\n1\n-NH\n2\n, wherein the aryl group R\n1\n is 3-substituted-5-aminoisoxazole, whereby an appropriate 3-oxonitrile 35, prepared as described in Scheme 8, is treated with hydroxylamine under appropriate conditions of pH and temperature, as described again in Takase et al.

Eur. J. Med. Chem. 2002 37, 635-648), or when R\n9\n contains one or more highly electron-withdrawing groups, for example fluorine, or under special conditions of pH and solvent, such as an ethanol and water mixture as described in EP 0220947. \n\n\n Scheme 9: General synthesis of 5-aminoisoxazole derivatives. \n\n\n\n\n\n 37 \n\n\n[00253] In an illustrative method, the amide compounds of formula (I) may also be routinely prepared according to the synthetic routes outlined in Scheme 10.

Similarly, the biaryl aryl ureas 80 can be synthesized through Suzuki coupling of 78 with diaryl uear boronate esters 57. \n\n\nScheme 21: General synthesis of l,5-naphthyridin-2(lH)-one derivatives. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n -CR\n9a\n=CR\n9a\n-\n\n\n-CR\n9a\n=N-, \n\n\n -N=N-\n\n\nA\n3\n = N, CH, CR \n0\n \n\n\n [00265] In an illustrative method, the l ,5-naphthyridin-2(lH)-one compounds of formula (I) may also be routinely prepared according to the synthetic route outlined in Scheme 22. The l ,5-naphthyridin-2(lH)-one derivatives 78 can undergo reductive amination with aldehyde derivatives 81 to give aminopyridine derivatives 82. The reaction was accomplished using reducing agents, such as, but not limited to, NaCNBH\n3\n or Na(OAc)\n3\nBH, and promoted by the addition of acids, such as, but not limited to, AcOH or HC1. Aminopyridines 82 can then be cyclized to afford 1 ,5- naphthyridin-2(lH)-one derivatives 83 using procedures as described in Scheme 21. The aryl acetamide compounds 84 can be realized by coupling 1 ,5-naphthyridin- \n\n 2(lH)-one derivatives 83 with the boronate esters 61 using a Pd-catalyzed Suzuki coupling protocol. Alternatively, l,5-naphthyridin-2(lH)-one derivatives 78 can be N- alkylated with electrophiles (R\nu\n-X) using a base, such as, but not limited to, NaH or K\n2\nC0\n3\n, in a solvent, such as, but not limited to DMF or NMP, to give 83, which can then be transformed to l,5-naphthyridin-2(lH)-one derivatives 84. \n\n\nScheme 22: General synthesis of l,5-naphthyridin-2(lH)-one derivatives. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 78 \n\n\n [00266] The subject matter has been described in an illustrative manner, and it is to be understood that the terminology used is intended to be in the nature of description rather than of limitation.

M-NFS-60s are mouse monocytic cells that depend on the binding of the ligand M-CSF to its receptor, CSFIR, to proliferate. Inhibition of CSFIR kinase activity will cause reduced growth and/or cell death. This assay assesses the potency of compounds as CSFIR inhibitors by measuring the reduction of Alamar Blue reagent by viable cells. \n\n\n[00628] On day one of the experiment, M-NFS-60 cells were maintained in\n\n\nRPMI complete medium (Omega Scientific) plus 10% FBS supplemented with 20 ng/mL of M-CSF (R&D Systems). 96-well TC- treated, flat bottom plates were seeded at 10,000 cell/well at a volume of 100 μΐ, per well.

MV4-1 1 cells carry ITD mutation within juxtamembrane domain of Flt3 kinase which renders the kinase constitutively active. The growth and/or survival of MV4-1 1 cells are greatly reduced in the presence of Flt3 inhibitors. This assay measures the potency of compounds as Flt3 inhibitors by measuring the reduction of Alamar Blue reagent by viable cells. \n\n\n [00633] MV4-1 1 cells were grown in an incubator at 37°C under 5% C0\n2\n in\n\n\nIscove's media (Celgro) with 10%> FBS.

ΙΟΟμί of the cell suspension (64,000 cells) were aliquoted into each well of a 96-well TC-treated plate. Compounds were added at 9 different concentrations, with half-log intervals alongside a control reference compound serving as a positive control. Final DMSO concentration was kept at 0.5% and final volume at 200 μί. The cells were then incubated at 37°C under 5% C0\n2\n for 3 days. \n\n\n [00636] On day five of the experiment, 40 of Alamar Blue reagent was added to each well and the mixture was allowed to incubate for 3 hours.

Kinases were produced as fusions to T7 phage {See, Fabian et al. or WO04/015142) or alternatively, the kinases were expressed in HEK-293 cells and subsequently tagged with DNA for PCR detection (See, WO08/005310). For the binding assays, streptavidin-coated magnetic beads were treated with biotinylated affinity ligands for 30 min at room temperature to generate affinity resins. The liganded beads were blocked with excess biotin and washed with blocking buffer (SeaBlock (Pierce), 1 %> BSA, 0.05 %> Tween 20, 1 mM DTT) to remove unbound ligand and to reduce nonspecific binding. Binding reactions were assembled by combining kinase, liganded affinity beads, and test compounds in 1 x binding buffer (20 %> SeaBlock, 0.17x PBS, \n\n 0.05 % Tween 20, 6 mM DTT). Test compounds were prepared as 100 x stocks in DMSO and diluted into the aqueous environment. Kds were determined using an eleven point threefold serial dilutions. DMSO or control compounds were was added to control assays lacking a test compound. Primary screen assays were performed in polypropylene 384-well plates in a final volume of 20-40 μί, while Kd determinations were performed in polystyrene 96-well plates in a final volume of 135 μί. The assay plates were incubated at room temperature with shaking for 1 hour to allow the binding reactions to reach equilibrium, and the affinity beads were washed \n\n\nextensively with wash buffer (lx PBS, 0.05 % Tween 20) to remove unbound protein. The beads were then resuspended in elution buffer (lx PBS, 0.05 % Tween 20, 0.5 μΜ non-biotinylated affinity ligand) and incubated at room temperature with shaking for 30 min. The kinase concentration in the eluates was measured by quantitative PCR. \n\n\n [00639] A selectivity score (S10) is a quantitative measure of selectivity of a compound against a panel of kinases. An S10 was calculated for a compound by dividing the number of kinases found to have a percent of control (DMSO) less than 10 by the total number of distinct kinases tested (excluding mutant variants). Percent of control (POC) is calculated by subtracting the signal of the control compound (POC = 0) from the signal of the test compound and dividing the outcome by the signal of DMSO (POC = 100) minus the signal of the control compound. For the compounds disclosed herein, S10 scores were obtained by testing the compounds at 10 μΜ concentration in a kinase panel containing either 359 or 386 distinct kinases. \n\n\n[00640] In one embodiment, the compounds provided herein were found to have Kds of about or less than about 20 μΜ against CSF-IR kinase.
