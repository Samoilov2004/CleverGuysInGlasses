Description\n\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe 90 kDa heat shock protein (Hsp90) is an abundant molecular chaperone involved in the folding and assembly of proteins, many of which are involved in signal transduction pathways (for reviews see Neckers, 2002; Sreedhar et al., 2004a; Wegele et al., 2004 and references therein). So far nearly 50 of these so-called client proteins have been identified and include steroid receptors, non-receptor tyrosine kinases e.g. src family, cyclin-dependent kinases e.g. cdk4 and cdk6, the cystic transmembrane regulator, nitric oxide synthase and others (Donzé and Picard, 1999; McLaughlin et al., 2002; Chiosis et al., 2004; Wegele et al., 2004; http://www.picard.ch/downloads/Hsp90interactors.pdf). Furthermore, Hsp90 plays a key role in stress response and protection of the cell against the effects of mutation (Bagatell and Whitesell, 2004; Chiosis et al., 2004). The function of Hsp90 is complicated and it involves the formation of dynamic multi-enzyme complexes (Bohen, 1998; Liu et al., 1999; Young et al., 2001; Takahashi et al., 2003; Sreedhar et al., 2004; Wegele et al., 2004). Hsp90 is a target for inhibitors (Fang et al., 1998; Liu et al., 1999; Blagosklonny, 2002; Neckers, 2003; Takahashi et al., 2003; Beliakoff and Whitesell, 2004; Wegele et al., 2004) resulting in degradation of client proteins, cell cycle dysregulation and apoptosis. More recently, Hsp90 has been identified as an important extracellular mediator for tumour invasion (Eustace et al., 2004). Hsp90 was identified as a new major therapeutic target for cancer therapy which is mirrored in the intense and detailed research about Hsp90 function (Blagosklonny et al., 1996; Neckers, 2002; Workman and Kaye, 2002; Beliakoff and Whitesell, 2004; Harris et al., 2004; Jez et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2004) and the development of high-throughput screening assays (Carreras et al., 2003; Rowlands et al., 2004). Hsp90 inhibitors include compound classes such as ansamycins, macrolides, purines, pyrazoles, coumarin antibiotics and others (for review see Bagatell and Whitesell, 2004; Chiosis et al., 2004 and references therein).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe benzenoid ansamycins are a broad class of chemical structures characterised by an aliphatic ring of varying length joined either side of an aromatic ring structure. Naturally occurring ansamycins include: macbecin and 18,21-dihydromacbecin (also known as macbecin I and macbecin II respectively) (1 & 2; Tanida et al., 1980), geldanamycin (3; DeBoer et al., 1970; DeBoer and Dietz, 1976; WO 03/106653 and references therein), and the herbimycin family (4; 5, 6, Omura et al., 1979, Iwai et al., 1980 and Shibata et al, 1986a, WO 03/106653 and references therein).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnsamycins were originally identified for their antibacterial and antiviral activity, however, recently their potential utility as anticancer agents has become of greater interest (Beliakoff and Whitesell, 2004). Many Hsp90 inhibitors are currently being assessed in clinical trials (Csermely and Soti, 2003; Workman, 2003). In particular, geldanamycin has nanomolar potency and apparent specificity for aberrant protein kinase dependent tumour cells (Chiosis et al., 2003; Workman, 2003).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt has been shown that treatment with Hsp90 inhibitors enhances the induction of tumour cell death by radiation and increased cell killing abilities (e.g. breast cancer, chronic myeloid leukaemia and non-small cell lung cancer) by combination of Hsp90 inhibitors with cytotoxic agents has also been demonstrated (Neckers, 2002; Beliakoff and Whitesell, 2004). The potential for anti-angiogenic activity is also of interest: the Hsp90 client protein HIF-1α plays a key role in the progression of solid tumours (Hur et al., 2002; Workman and Kaye, 2002; Kaur et al., 2004).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHsp90 inhibitors also function as immunosuppressants and are involved in the complement-induced lysis of several types of tumour cells after Hsp90 inhibition (Sreedhar et al., 2004). Treatment with Hsp90 inhibitors can also result in induced superoxide production (Sreedhar et al., 2004a) associated with immune cell-mediated lysis (Sreedhar et al., 2004). The use of Hsp90 inhibitors as potential anti-malaria drugs has also been discussed (Kumar at al., 2003). Furthermore, it has been shown that geldanamycin interferes with the formation of complex glycosylated mammalian prion protein PrP\nc \n(Winklhofer et al., 2003).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs described above, ansamycins are of interest as potential anticancer and anti-B-cell malignancy compounds, however the currently available ansamycins exhibit poor pharmacological or pharmaceutical properties, for example they show poor water solubility, poor metabolic stability, poor bioavailability or poor formulation ability (Goetz et al., 2003; Workman 2003; Chiosis 2004). Both herbimycin A and geldanamycin were identified as poor candidates for clinical trials due to their strong hepatotoxicity (review Workman, 2003) and geldanamycin was withdrawn from Phase I clinical trials due to hepatotoxicity (Supko et al., 1995; WO 03/106653).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGeldanamycin was isolated from culture filtrates of \nStreptomyces hygroscopicus \nand shows strong activity in vitro against protozoa and weak activity against bacteria and fungi. In 1994 the association of geldanamycin with Hsp90 was shown (Whitesell et al., 1994). The biosynthetic gene cluster for geldanamycin was cloned and sequenced (Allen and Ritchie, 1994; Rascher et al., 2003; WO 03/106653). The DNA sequence is available under the NCBI accession number AY179507. The isolation of genetically engineered geldanamycin producer strains derived from \nS. hygroscopicus \nsubsp. \nduamyceticus \nJCM4427 and the isolation of 4,5-dihydro-7-O-descarbamoyl-7-hydroxygeldanamycin and 4,5-dihydro-7-O-descarbamoyl-7-hydroxy-17-O-demethylgeldanamycin were described recently (Hong et al., 2004). By feeding geldanamycin to the herbimycin producing strain \nStreptomyces hygroscopicus \nAM-3672 the compounds 15-hydroxygeldanamycin, the tricyclic geldanamycin analogue KOSN-1633 and methyl-geldanamycinate were isolated (Hu et al., 2004). The two compounds 17-formyl-17-demethoxy-18-O-21-O-dihydrogeldanamycin and 17-hydroxymethyl-17-demethoxygeldanamycin were isolated from \nS. hygroscopicus \nK279-78. \nS. hygroscopicus \nK279-78 is \nS. hygroscopicus \nNRRL 3602 containing cosmid pKOS279-78 which has a 44 kbp insert which contains various genes from the herbimycin producing strain \nStreptomyces hygroscopicus \nAM-3672 (Hu et al., 2004). Substitutions of acyltransferase domains have been made in four of the modules of the polyketide synthase of the geldanamycin biosynthetic cluster (Patel et al., 2004). AT substitutions were carried out in \n \n \nmodules\n \n \n 1, 4 and 5 leading to the fully processed analogues 14-desmethyl-geldanamycin, 8-desmethyl-geldanamycin and 6-desmethoxy-geldanamycin and the not fully processed 4,5-dihydro-6-desmethoxy-geldanamycin. Substitution of the \nmodule\n 7 AT lead to production of three 2-desmethyl compounds, KOSN1619, KOSN1558 and KOSN1559, one of which (KOSN1559), a 2-demethyl-4,5-dihydro-17-demethoxy-21-deoxy derivative of geldanamycin, binds to Hsp90 with a 4-fold greater binding affinity than geldanamycin and an 8-fold greater binding affinity than 17-AAG. However this is not reflected in an improvement in the IC\n50 \nmeasurement using SKBr3. Another analogue, a novel nonbenzoquinoid geldanamycin, designated KOS-1806 has a monophenolic structure (Rascher et al., 2005). No activity data was given for KOS-1806.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn 1979 the ansamycin antibiotic herbimycin A was isolated from the fermentation broth of \nStreptomyces hygroscopicus \nstrain No. AM-3672 and named according to its potent herbicidal activity. The antitumour activity was established by using cells of a rat kidney line infected with a temperature sensitive mutant of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) for screening for drugs that reverted the transformed morphology of the these cells (for review see Uehara, 2003). Herbimycin A was postulated as acting primarily through the binding to Hsp90 chaperone proteins but the direct binding to the conserved cysteine residues and subsequent inactivation of kinases was also discussed (Uehara, 2003).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChemical derivatives have been isolated and compounds with altered substituents at C19 of the benzoquinone nucleus and halogenated compounds in the ansa chain showed less toxicity and higher antitumour activities than herbimycin A (Omura et al., 1984; Shibata et al., 1986b). The sequence of the herbimycin biosynthetic gene cluster was identified in WO 03/106653 and in a recent paper (Rascher et al., 2005).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ansamycin compounds macbecin (1) and 18,21-dihydromacbecin (2) (C-14919E-1 and C-14919E-1), identified by their antifungal and antiprotozoal activity, were isolated from the culture supernatants of \nNocardia \nsp No. C-14919 (\nActinosynnema pretiosum \nsubsp \npretiosum \nATCC 31280) (Tanida et al., 1980; Muroi et al., 1980; Muroi et al., 1981; U.S. Pat. No. 4,315,989 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,187,292). 18,21-Dihydromacbecin is characterized by containing the dihydroquinone form of the nucleus. Both macbecin and 18,21-dihydromacbecin were shown to possess similar antibacterial and antitumour activities against cancer cell lines such as the murine leukaemia P388 cell line (Ono et al., 1982). Reverse transcriptase and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase activities were not inhibited by macbecin (Ono et al., 1982). The Hsp90 inhibitory function of macbecin has been reported in the literature (Bohen, 1998; Liu et al., 1999). The conversion of macbecin and 18,21-dihydromacbecin after adding to a microbial culture broth into a compound with a hydroxy group instead of a methoxy group at a certain position or positions is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,421,687 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,512,975.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDuring a screen of a large variety of soil microorganisms, the compounds TAN-420A to E were identified from producer strains belonging to the genus \nStreptomyces \n(7-11, EP 0 110 710).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn 2000, the isolation of the geldanamycin related, non-benzoquinone ansamycin metabolite reblastatin from cell cultures of \nStreptomyces \nsp. S6699 and its potential therapeutic value in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis was described (Stead et al., 2000).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA further Hsp90 inhibitor, distinct from the chemically unrelated benzoquinone ansamycins is Radicicol (monorden) which was originally discovered for its antifungal activity from the fungus \nMonosporium bonorden \n(for review see Uehara, 2003) and the structure was found to be identical to the 14-membered macrolide isolated from \nNectria radicicola\n. In addition to its antifungal, antibacterial, anti-protozoan and cytotoxic activity it was subsequently identified as an inhibitor of Hsp90 chaperone proteins (for review see Uehara, 2003; Schulte at al., 1999). The anti-angiogenic activity of radicicol (Hur et al., 2002) and semi-synthetic derivates thereof (Kurebayashi et al., 2001) has also been described.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecent interest has focussed on 17-amino derivatives of geldanamycin as a new generation of ansamycin anticancer compounds (Bagatell and Whitesell, 2004), for example 17-(allylamino)-17-desmethoxy geldanamycin (17-AAG, 12) (Hostein et al., 2001; Neckers, 2002; Nimmanapalli et al., 2003; Vasilevskaya et al., 2003; Smith-Jones et al., 2004) and 17-desmethoxy-17-N,N-dimethylaminoethylamino-geldanamycin (17-DMAG, 13) (Egorin et al., 2002; Jez et al., 2003). More recently geldanamycin was derivatised on the 17-position to create 17-geldanamycin amides, carbamates, ureas and 17-arylgeldanamycin (Le Brazidec et al., 2003). A library of over sixty 17-alkylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin analogues has been reported and tested for their affinity for Hsp90 and water solubility (Tian et al., 2004). A further approach to reduce the toxicity of geldanamycin is the selective targeting and delivering of an active geldanamycin compound into malignant cells by conjugation to a tumour-targeting monoclonal antibody (Mandler et al., 2000).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhilst many of these derivatives exhibit reduced hepatotoxicity they still have only limited water solubility. For example 17-AAG requires the use of a solubilising carrier (e.g. Cremophore®, DMSO-egg lecithin), which itself may result in side-effects in some patients (Hu et al., 2004).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMost of the ansamycin class of Hsp90 inhibitors bear the common structural moiety: the benzoquinone which is a Michael acceptor that can readily form covalent bonds with nucleophiles such as proteins, glutathione, etc. The benzoquinone moiety also undergoes redox equilibrium with dihydroquinone, during which oxygen radicals are formed, which give rise to further unspecific toxicity (Dikalov et al., 2002). For example treatment with geldanamycin can result in induced superoxide production (Sreedhar et al., 2004a).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore, there remains a need to identify novel ansamycin derivatives, which may have utility in the treatment of cancer and/or B-cell malignancies, preferably such ansamycins have improved water solubility, an improved pharmacological profile and/or reduced side-effect profile for administration. The present invention discloses novel ansamycin analogues generated by biotransformation and optionally genetic engineering of the parent producer strain. In particular the present invention discloses \nnovel\n 18,21-didesoxymacbecin analogues and other macbecin analogues, which generally have improved pharmaceutical properties compared with the presently available ansamycins; in particular they are expected show improvements in respect of one or more of the following properties: activity against different cancer sub-types, toxicity, water solubility, metabolic stability, bioavailability and formulation ability. Preferably the macbecin analogues (such as 18,21-didesoxymacbecin analogues) show improved bioavailability.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIn the present invention non-natural starter units have been fed to macbecin producing strains, optionally in combination with targeted inactivation or deletion of the genes responsible for the post-PKS modifications of macbecins, and optionally in combination with targeted inactivation or deletion of the genes responsible for starter unit (starter acid) biosynthesis, in order to produce novel macbecin analogues formed by incorporation of a non-natural starter unit. Optionally the genes or regulators responsible for starter unit biosynthesis may be manipulated by targeted inactivation or deletion or modified by other means such as exposing cells to UV radiation and selection of the phenotype indicating that starter unit biosynthesis has been disrupted. The optional targeting of the post-PKS genes may occur via a variety of mechanisms, e.g. by integration, targeted deletion of a region of the macbecin cluster including all or some of the post-PKS genes optionally followed by insertion of gene(s) or other methods of rendering the post-PKS genes or their encoded enzymes non-functional e.g. chemical inhibition, site-directed mutagenesis or mutagenesis of the cell for example by the use of UV radiation. As a result, the present invention provides macbecin analogues, methods for the preparation of these compounds, and methods for the use of these compounds in medicine or as intermediates in the production of further compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore, in a first aspect the present invention provides analogues of macbecins which are lacking the usual starter unit.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus in one aspect of the invention there is provided a compound of formula (I)\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nor a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof,\n\n\nwherein:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nR\n1 \nrepresents H, OH, OMe;\n \nR\n2 \nrepresents H or Me;\n \nR\n3 \nrepresents H or CONH\n2\n;\n \nR\n4 \nand R\n5 \neither both represent H or together they represent a bond (i.e. C4 to C5 is a double bond);\n \nR\n6 \nrepresents H, F, OH, OMe, Br, Cl, CF\n3\n, CH\n3\n, SH, CH\n2\nCH\n3 \nor NR\n10a\nR\n11a\n;\n \nR\n7 \nrepresents H, F, OH, OMe, Br, Cl, CF\n3\n, CH\n3\n, SH, CH\n2\nCH\n3 \nor NR\n10b\nR\n11b\n;\n \nR\n8 \nrepresents H, F, OH, OMe, Br, Cl, CF\n3\n, CH\n3\n, SH, CH\n2\nCH\n3 \nor NR\n10c\nR\n11c\n;\n \nR\n9 \nrepresents H, F, OH, OMe, Br, Cl, CF\n3\n, CH\n3\n, SH, CH\n2\nCH\n3 \nor NR\n10d\nR\n11d\n;\n \nR\n10a\n, R\n11a\n, R\n10b\n, R\n11b\n, R\n10c\n, R\n11c\n, R\n10d\n, R\n11d \nindependently represent H, CH\n3 \nor CH\n2\nCH\n3\n; provided however that:\n \nwhen R\n6 \nand R\n9 \nrepresent H then R\n7 \nand R\n8 \ndo not both represent OH; and\n \nwhen R\n6\n, R\n8 \nand R\n9 \nrepresent H, then R\n7 \ndoes not represent OH or H.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe above structure shows a representative tautomer and the invention embraces all tautomers of the compounds of formula (I) for example keto compounds where enol compounds are illustrated and vice versa.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention embraces all stereoisomers of the compounds defined by structure (I) as shown above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further aspect, the present invention provides macbecin analogues such as compounds of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for use as a pharmaceutical.\n\n\n \nDEFINITIONS\n\n\n \n \n \nThe articles “a” and “an” are used herein to refer to one or to more than one (i.e. at least one) of the grammatical objects of the article.

Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient (compound of the invention) with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention will normally be administered orally or by any parenteral route, in the form of a pharmaceutical formulation comprising the active ingredient, optionally in the form of a non-toxic organic, or inorganic, acid, or base, addition salt, in a pharmaceutically acceptable dosage form. Depending upon the disorder and patient to be treated, as well as the route of administration, the compositions may be administered at varying doses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, the compounds of the invention can be administered orally, buccally or sublingually in the form of tablets, capsules, ovules, elixirs, solutions or suspensions, which may contain flavouring or colouring agents, for immediate-, delayed- or controlled-release applications.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch tablets may contain excipients such as microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, sodium citrate, calcium carbonate, dibasic calcium phosphate and glycine, disintegrants such as starch (preferably corn, potato or tapioca starch), sodium starch glycollate, croscarmellose sodium and certain complex silicates, and granulation binders such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), hydroxy-propylcellulose (HPC), sucrose, gelatine and acacia. Additionally, lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid, glyceryl behenate and talc may be included.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in gelatine capsules. Preferred excipients in this regard include lactose, starch, a cellulose, milk sugar or high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. For aqueous suspensions and/or elixirs, the compounds of the invention may be combined with various sweetening or flavouring agents, colouring matter or dyes, with emulsifying and/or suspending agents and with diluents such as water, ethanol, propylene glycol and glycerine, and combinations thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA tablet may be made by compression or moulding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder (e.g. povidone, gelatine, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose), lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, disintegrant (e.g. sodium starch glycolate, cross-linked povidone, cross-linked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose), surface-active or dispersing agent. Moulded tablets may be made by moulding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein using, for example, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose in varying proportions to provide desired release profile.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations in accordance with the present invention suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets, each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient; as a powder or granules; as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or a non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. The active ingredient may also be presented as a bolus, electuary or paste.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges comprising the active ingredient in a flavoured basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert basis such as gelatine and glycerine, or sucrose and acacia; and mouth-washes comprising the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt should be understood that in addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned above the formulations of this invention may include other agents conventional in the art having regard to the type of formulation in question, for example those suitable for oral administration may include flavouring agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions adapted for topical administration may be formulated as ointments, creams, suspensions, lotions, powders, solutions, pastes, gels, impregnated dressings, sprays, aerosols or oils, transdermal devices, dusting powders, and the like. These compositions may be prepared via conventional methods containing the active agent. Thus, they may also comprise compatible conventional carriers and additives, such as preservatives, solvents to assist drug penetration, emollient in creams or ointments and ethanol or oleyl alcohol for lotions. Such carriers may be present as from about 1% up to about 98% of the composition. More usually they will form up to about 80% of the composition. As an illustration only, a cream or ointment is prepared by mixing sufficient quantities of hydrophilic material and water, containing from about 5-10% by weight of the compound, in sufficient quantities to produce a cream or ointment having the desired consistency.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions adapted for transdermal administration may be presented as discrete patches intended to remain in intimate contact with the epidermis of the recipient for a prolonged period of time. For example, the active agent may be delivered from the patch by iontophoresis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor applications to external tissues, for example the mouth and skin, the compositions are preferably applied as a topical ointment or cream. When formulated in an ointment, the active agent may be employed with either a paraffinic or a water-miscible ointment base.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the active agent may be formulated in a cream with an oil-in-water cream base or a water-in-oil base.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor parenteral administration, fluid unit dosage forms are prepared utilizing the active ingredient and a sterile vehicle, for example but without limitation water, alcohols, polyols, glycerine and vegetable oils, water being preferred. The active ingredient, depending on the vehicle and concentration used, can be either suspended or dissolved in the vehicle. In preparing solutions the active ingredient can be dissolved in water for injection and filter sterilised before filling into a suitable vial or ampoule and sealing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdvantageously, agents such as local anaesthetics, preservatives and buffering agents can be dissolved in the vehicle. To enhance the stability, the composition can be frozen after filling into the vial and the water removed under vacuum. The dry lyophilized powder is then sealed in the vial and an accompanying vial of water for injection may be supplied to reconstitute the liquid prior to use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParenteral suspensions are prepared in substantially the same manner as solutions, except that the active ingredient is suspended in the vehicle instead of being dissolved and sterilization cannot be accomplished by filtration. The active ingredient can be sterilised by exposure to ethylene oxide before suspending in the sterile vehicle. Advantageously, a surfactant or wetting agent is included in the composition to facilitate uniform distribution of the active ingredient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention may also be administered using medical devices known in the art. For example, in one embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition of the invention can be administered with a needleless hypodermic injection device, such as the devices disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,399,163; U.S. Pat. No. 5,383,851; U.S. Pat. No. 5,312,335; U.S. Pat. No. 5,064,413; U.S. Pat. No. 4,941,880; U.S. Pat. No. 4,790,824; or U.S. Pat. No. 4,596,556. Examples of well-known implants and modules useful in the present invention include: U.S. Pat. No. 4,487,603, which discloses an implantable micro-infusion pump for dispensing medication at a controlled rate; U.S. Pat. No. 4,486,194, which discloses a therapeutic device for administering medicaments through the skin; U.S. Pat.

No. 4,439,196, which discloses an osmotic drug delivery system having multi-chamber compartments; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,475,196, which discloses an osmotic drug delivery system. Many other such implants, delivery systems, and modules are known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dosage to be administered of a compound of the invention will vary according to the particular compound, the disease involved, the subject, and the nature and severity of the disease and the physical condition of the subject, and the selected route of administration. The appropriate dosage can be readily determined by a person skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions may contain from 0.1% by weight, preferably from 5-60%, more preferably from 10-30% by weight, of a compound of invention, depending on the method of administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be recognized by one of skill in the art that the optimal quantity and spacing of individual dosages of a compound of the invention will be determined by the nature and extent of the condition being treated, the form, route and site of administration, and the age and condition of the particular subject being treated, and that a physician will ultimately determine appropriate dosages to be used. This dosage may be repeated as often as appropriate. If side effects develop the amount and/or frequency of the dosage can be altered or reduced, in accordance with normal clinical practice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further aspect the present invention provides methods for the production of macbecin analogues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMacbecin can be considered to be biosynthesised in two stages. In the first stage the core-PKS genes assemble the macrolide core by the repeated assembly of simple carboxylic acid precursors to give a polyketide chain which is then cyclised to form the first enzyme-free intermediate “pre-macbecin”, see \nFIG. 1\n. In the second stage a series of “post-PKS” tailoring enzymes (e.g. P450 monooxygenases, methyltransferases, FAD-dependent oxygenases and a carbamoyltransferase) act to add the various additional groups to the pre-macbecin template resulting in the final parent compound structure, see \nFIG. 2\n. The macbecin analogues may be biosynthesised in a similar manner.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis biosynthetic production may be exploited by biotransformation optionally combined with genetic engineering of suitable producer strains to result in the production of novel compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSurprisingly the inventors have found that by feeding macbecin producing strains with non-natural starter units (starter acids or analogues thereof such as esters), these starter units may be incorporated into ansamycin structures to produce novel macbecin analogues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus according to the invention there is provided a process for preparing a macbecin analogue which comprises:\n\n \n \n \n \n \na) providing a strain that produces a macbecin or an analogue thereof when cultured under appropriate conditions\n \nb) feeding a starter unit which is not AHBA to said strain such that the starter unit is incorporated into said macbecin or analogue thereof.\n \nc) culturing said strain under suitable conditions for the production of an ansamycin or analogue thereof; and\n \nd) optionally isolating the compounds produced.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nSuitably the starter unit fed in step (b) is not 3-aminobenzoic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitably the strain of a) is characterised by being a strain which one or more AHBA biosynthesis genes have been deleted or inactivated. This may avoid competition for incorporation of a non-natural starter unit by AHBA which would decrease yield. Alternatively, the strain of a) may be mutated to lower the efficiency of AHBA biosynthesis. Suitably the conditions of step c) are such that the efficiency of AHBA biosynthesis is sub-optimal. Thus desirably AHBA is produced by the strain to a level which nevertheless allows incorporation of the fed non-natural starter unit. Typically the amount of incorporated fed non natural starter unit is >20%, preferably >50% of the total starter unit incorporation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitably the starter unit is selected from\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\nwherein R\n6\n, R\n7\n, R\n8 \nand R\n9 \nare as defined above;\n\n\nor an analogue thereof in which the acid moiety is derivatised such as an ester (eg the methyl or ethyl ester).\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn another embodiment the starter unit is a compound of formula (II):\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\nwherein R\n7 \nrepresents OH and R\n6\n, R\n8 \nand R\n9 \neach represent H;\n\n\nor an analogue thereof in which the acid moiety is derivatised such as an ester (eg the methyl or ethyl ester).\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn another embodiment the starter unit is a compound of formula (II) in which R\n6\n, R\n7\n, R\n8 \nand R\n9 \ndo not all represent H.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the strain is a macbecin producing strain and the starter unit is selected such that the strain produces a 18,21-didesoxymacbecin analogue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the starter unit is selected such that the strain produces a 18,21-didesoxymacbecin analogue which is substituted by fluorine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther exemplary start units include, but are not limited to those compounds shown in the second column of Tables 13, 14, 15 and 16 below, as well as appropriate derivatives thereof (such as salts and esters etc).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment the strain is a macbecin producing strain and the starter unit is selected such that the strain produces a macbecin analogue which is not substituted at \n \npositions\n \n 18 or 21 of the benzene ring.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitably the process (i) further comprises the step of subjecting the product of step (d) to a process of chemical modification or biotranformation optionally followed by the step of isolating the resultant compounds or (ii) further comprises the step of subjecting the product of step (c) to a process of chemical modification or biotransformation prior to step (d).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther aspects of the invention include a process for the generation of 18,21-didesoxymacbecin analogues, said method comprising:\n\n \n \n \na) providing a first host strain that produces macbecin when cultured under appropriate conditions in which optionally one or more post-PKS genes have been deleted or inactivated and/or one or more starter unit biosynthesis genes have been deleted or inactivated;\n \nb) feeding a non-natural starter unit to said strain\n \nc) culturing said modified host strain under suitable conditions for the production of 18,21-didesoxymacbecin analogues; and\n \nd) optionally isolating the compounds produced.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides a method of producing macbecin analogues said method comprising:\n\n \n \n \n \n \na) providing a first host strain that produces macbecin or an analogue when cultured under appropriate conditions\n \nb) feeding a non-natural starter unit to said strain\n \nc) culturing said strain under suitable conditions for the production of macbecin analogues; and\n \nd) optionally isolating the compounds produced.\n\n\nThe method may additionally comprise the step of:\n\n \ne) deleting or inactivating one or more of the starter unit biosynthesis genes, or a homologue thereof, said step usually occurring prior to step c) and/or the method may additionally comprise the step of:\n \nf) deleting or inactivating one or more post-PKS genes, said step usually occurring prior to step c).\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn step (a) by “a host strain that produces macbecin or an analogue thereof” includes a strain that produces macbecin or those analogues of macbecin analogues that are embraced by the definitions of R\n1\n-R\n11 \nwhen cultured under appropriate conditions. Appropriate conditions (and suitable conditions in step (c)) include the provision of a suitable starter feed and growth media of suitable composition (which will be known to a skilled person or may be determined by methods known per se).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitably the non-natural starter feed is a substituted benzoic acid (not being 3-amino-5-hydroxy-benzoic acid which is the natural starter unit).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitably the fed starter unit is a starter acid. However one skilled in the art will appreciate that there are alternative non-natural starter units, i.e. derivatives of the acid, that could be fed to the host strain to produce the same compound(s) for example, but not limited to, esters such as the methyl ester, the ethyl ester, the N-acetyl-cysteamine thioester of the substituted benzoic acid and the diketide analogue of the biosynthetic intermediate activated appropriately for incorporation for example as the N-acetyl-cysteamine thioester. Generally such derivatives are converted to the acid before incorporation. Acid compounds may also be supplied as corresponding salt forms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a first embodiment of the invention the host strain is a macbecin producing strain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an alternative embodiment, the host strain is an engineered strain based on a macbecin producing strain in which one or more of the starter unit biosynthetic genes have been deleted or inactivated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment the host strain is an engineered strain based on a macbecin producing strain in which one or more of the post-PKS genes have been deleted or inactivated. For example, the host strain may be an engineered strain based on a macbecin producing strain in which mbcM and optionally further post-PKS genes have been deleted or inactivated. Specifically, the host strain may be an engineered strain based on a macbecin producing strain in which mbcM has been deleted or inactivated. Alternatively the host strain may be an engineered strain based on a macbecin producing strain in which mbcM, mbcMT1, mbcMT2, mbcP and mbcP450 have been deleted or inactivated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe aforementioned deletions may be combined eg the host strain may be an engineered strain based on a macbecin producing strain in which mbcM and one or more of the starter unit biosynthetic genes and optionally further post-PKS genes have been deleted. For example, Ahs may be deleted or inactivated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitably the one or more starter unit biosynthetic genes and/or post-PKS genes will be deleted or inactivated selectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment, one or more starter unit biosynthetic genes or post-PKS genes are inactivated in said engineered strain by integration of DNA into the gene(s) such that functional protein is not produced. In an alternative embodiment, one or more of said starter unit biosynthetic genes or post-PKS genes are deleted in said engineered strain by making a targeted deletion or deletions. In a further embodiment one or more starter unit biosynthetic genes or post-PKS genes are inactivated in said engineered strain by site-directed mutagenesis. In a further embodiment a macbecin producing host strain is subjected to mutagenesis, chemical or UV, and a modified strain is selected in which one or more of the starter unit biosynthetic enzymes or post-PKS enzymes are not functional. The present invention also encompasses mutations of the regulators controlling the expression of one or more of the starter unit biosynthetic genes or post-PKS genes, a person of skill in the art will appreciate that deletion or inactivation of a regulator may have the same outcome as deletion or inactivation of the gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment an engineered strain in which one or more post-PKS genes have been deleted or inactivated as above, has re-introduced into it one or more of the same post PKS genes, or homologues thereof from an alternative macbecin producing strain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment an engineered strain in which one or more genes has been deleted or inactivated is complemented by one or more of the post PKS genes from a heterologous PKS cluster including, but not limited to the clusters directing the biosynthesis of rifamycin, ansamitocin, geldanamycin or herbimycin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA method of selectively deleting or inactivating a post PKS gene comprises:\n\n \n \n \n \n \n(i) designing degenerate oligos based on homologue(s) of the gene of interest (e.g. from the rifamycin, geldanamycin or herbimycin biosynthetic clusters and/or other available sequences) and isolating the internal fragment of the gene of interest from a suitable macbecin producing strain by using these primers in a PCR reaction,\n        \n \n(ii) integrating a plasmid containing this fragment into either the same, or a different macbecin producing strain followed by homologous recombination, which results in the disruption of the targeted gene,\n \n\n\n \n(iii) culturing the strain thus produced under conditions suitable for the production of the macbecin analogues.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn a specific embodiment, the macbecin-producing strain in step (i) is \nActinosynnema mirum \n(\nA. mirum\n). In a further specific embodiment the macbecin-producing strain in step (ii) is \nActinosynnema pretiosum \n(\nA. pretiosum\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA person of skill in the art will appreciate that an equivalent strain may be achieved using alternative methods to that described above, e.g.:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nDegenerate oligos may be used to amplify the gene of interest from any macbecin producing strain for example, but not limited to \nA. pretiosum\n, or \nA. mirum \n \n \nDifferent degenerate oligos may be designed which will successfully amplify an appropriate region of the post-PKS gene, or a homologue thereof, from a macbecin producer, or strain producing a homologue thereof.\n \nThe sequence of the gene of the \nA. pretiosum \nstrain may be used to generate the oligos which may be specific to the gene of \nA. pretiosum \nand then the internal fragment may be amplified from any macbecin producing strain e.g \nA. pretiosum \nor \nA. mirum. \n \n \nThe sequence of the gene of the \nA. pretiosum \nstrain may be used along with the sequence of homologous genes to generate degenerate oligos to the gene of \nA. pretiosum \nand then the internal fragment may be amplified from any macbecin producing strain e.g \nA. pretiosum \nor \nA. mirum. \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nFIG. 2\n shows the activity of the post-PKS genes in the macbecin biosynthetic cluster. A person of skill in the art would thus be able to identify which additional post-PKS genes would need to be deleted or inactivated in order to arrive at a strain that will produce the compound(s) of interest.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt may be observed in these systems that when a strain is generated in which one or more of the post-PKS genes does not function as a result of one of the methods described including inactivation or deletion, that more than one macbecin analogue may be produced. There are a number of possible reasons for this which will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. For example there may be a preferred order of post-PKS steps and removing a single activity leads to all subsequent steps being carried out on substrates that are not natural to the enzymes involved. This can lead to intermediates building up in the culture broth due to a lowered efficiency towards the novel substrates presented to the post-PKS enzymes, or to shunt products which are no longer substrates for the remaining enzymes possibly because the order of steps has been altered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA person of skill in the art will appreciate that the ratio of compounds observed in a mixture can be manipulated by using variations in the growth conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne skilled in the art will appreciate that in a biosynthetic cluster some genes are organised in operons and disruption of one gene will often have an effect on expression of subsequent genes in the same operon.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen a mixture of compounds is observed these can be readily separated using standard techniques some of which are described in the following examples.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA method of selectively deleting or inactivating a gene involved in AHBA synthesis comprises:\n\n \n \n \n \n \n(i) designing degenerate oligos based on homologue(s) of the gene of interest (e.g. from the rifamycin, geldanamycin or herbimycin biosynthetic clusters and/or other available sequences) and isolating the internal fragment of the gene of interest from a suitable macbecin producing strain by using these primers in a PCR reaction,\n \n(ii) integrating a plasmid containing this fragment into either the same, or a different macbecin producing strain followed by homologous recombination, which results in the disruption of the targeted gene,\n \n(iii) culturing the strain thus produced under conditions suitable for the production of the macbecin analogues.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn a specific embodiment, the macbecin-producing strain in step (i) is \nActinosynnema minim \n(\nA. mirum\n). In a further specific embodiment the macbecin-producing strain in step (ii) is \nActinosynnema pretiosum \n(\nA. pretiosum\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA person of skill in the art will appreciate that an equivalent strain may be achieved using alternative methods to that described above, e.g.:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nDegenerate oligos may be used to amplify the gene of interest from any macbecin producing strain for example, but not limited to \nA. pretiosum\n, or \nA. mirum \n \n \nDifferent degenerate oligos may be designed which will successfully amplify an appropriate region of the AHBA synthesis gene, or a homologue thereof, from a macbecin producer, or strain producing a homologue thereof.\n \nThe sequence of the gene of the \nA. pretiosum \nstrain may be used to generate the oligos which may be specific to the gene of \nA. pretiosum \nand then the internal fragment may be amplified from any macbecin producing strain e.g \nA. pretiosum \nor \nA. mirum. \n \n \nThe sequence of the gene of the \nA. pretiosum \nstrain may be used along with the sequence of homologous genes to generate degenerate oligos to the gene of \nA. pretiosum \nand then the internal fragment may be amplified from any macbecin producing strain e.g \nA. pretiosum \nor \nA. minim. \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nOne skilled in the art will appreciate that more than one AHBA synthesis gene may need to be inactivated, as organisms often have degeneracy in metabolic genes and enzymatic activities, therefore when one gene or activity is inactivated, other activities may complement until they are also inactivated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne skilled in the art will appreciate that in a biosynthetic cluster some genes are organised in operons and disruption of one gene will often have an effect on expression of subsequent genes in the same operon.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen a mixture of compounds is observed these can be readily separated using standard techniques some of which are described in the following examples.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMacbecin analogues may be screened by a number of methods, as described herein, and in the circumstance where a single compound shows a favourable profile a strain can be engineered to make this compound preferably. In the unusual circumstance when this is not possible, an intermediate can be generated which is then biotransformed to produce the desired compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides novel macbecin analogues generated by the selected deletion or inactivation of one or more post-PKS genes from the macbecin PKS gene cluster. In particular, the present invention relates to novel macbecin analogues produced by feeding a non-natural starter unit to a macbecin producing strain, optionally combined with the selected deletion or inactivation of one or more post-PKS genes, from the macbecin PKS gene cluster.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA person of skill in the art will appreciate that a gene does not need to be completely deleted for the gene product to be rendered non-functional, consequentially the term “deleted or inactivated” as used herein encompasses any method by which the gene product is rendered non-functional including but not limited to: deletion of the gene in its entirety, deletion of part of the gene, inactivation by insertion into the target gene, site-directed mutagenesis which results in the gene either not being expressed or being expressed to produce inactive protein, mutagenesis of the host strain which results in the gene either not being expressed or being expressed to produce inactive protein (e.g. by radiation or exposure to mutagenic chemicals, protoplast fusion or transposon mutagenesis). Alternatively the function of an active gene product can be impaired chemically with inhibitors, for example metapyrone (alternative name 2-methyl-1,2-di(3-pyridyl-1-propanone), EP 0 627 009) and ancymidol are inhibitors of oxygenases and these compounds can be added to the production medium to generate analogues. Additionally, sinefungin is a methyl transferase inhibitor that can be used similarly but for the inhibition of methyl transferase activity in vivo (McCammon and Parks, 1981).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an alternative embodiment, all of the post-PKS genes may be deleted or inactivated and then one or more of the genes may then be reintroduced by complementation (e.g. at an attachment site, on a self-replicating plasmid or by insertion into a homologous region of the chromosome). Therefore, in a particular embodiment the present invention relates to methods for the generation of macbecin analogues, said method comprising:\n\n \n \n \n \n \na) providing a first host strain that produces a macbecin when cultured under appropriate conditions\n \nb) optionally selectively deleting or inactivating all the post-PKS genes,\n \nc) feeding a non-natural starter unit to said strain\n \nd) culturing said modified host strain under suitable conditions for the production of macbecin analogues; and\n \ne) optionally isolating the compounds produced.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn an alternative embodiment, one or more of the deleted post-PKS genes are reintroduced. In a further embodiment, 1 or more of the post-PKS genes selected from the group consisting of mbcM, mbcN, mbcP, mbcMT1, mbcMT2 and mbcP450 are reintroduced. In a further embodiment, 2 or more of the post-PKS genes selected from the group consisting of mbcM, mbcN, mbcP, mbcMT1, mbcMT2 and mbcP450 are reintroduced. In a further embodiment, 3 or more of the post-PKS genes selected from the group consisting of mbcM, mbcN, mbcP, mbcMT1, mbcMT2 and mbcP450 are reintroduced. In a further embodiment, 4 or more of the post-PKS genes selected from the group consisting of mbcM, mbcN, mbcP, mbcMT1, mbcMT2 and mbcP450 are reintroduced. In a further alternative embodiment, 5 or more of the post-PKS genes selected from the group consisting of mbcM, mbcN, mbcP, mbcMT1, mbcMT2 and mbcP450 are reintroduced. Optionally genes from other PKS biosynthetic clusters such as but not limited to the geldanamycin or herbimycin pathways can be introduced appropriately.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, it will be apparent to a person of skill in the art that a subset of the post-PKS genes, could be deleted or inactivated and optionally a smaller subset of said post-PKS genes could be reintroduced to arrive at a strain that, when fed a non-natural starter unit, produces macbecin analogues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore, in a preferred embodiment the present invention relates to methods for the generation of macbecin analogues, said method comprising:\n\n \n \n \n \n \na) providing a first host strain that produces macbecin when cultured under appropriate conditions\n \nb) selectively deleting or inactivating mbcM,\n \nc) feeding a non-natural starter unit to said strain\n \nd) culturing said modified host strain under suitable conditions for the production of macbecin analogues; and\n \ne) optionally isolating the compounds produced.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn a further preferred embodiment the present invention relates to methods for the generation of macbecin analogues, said method comprising:\n\n \n \n \n \n \na) providing a first host strain that produces macbecin when cultured under appropriate conditions\n \nb) selectively deleting or inactivating mbcM and mbcP450\n \nc) optionally selectively deleting or inactivating further post-PKS genes\n \nd) feeding a non-natural starter unit to said strain\n \ne) culturing said modified host strain under suitable conditions for the production of macbecin analogues; and\n \nf) optionally isolating the compounds produced.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn a further preferred embodiment the present invention relates to methods for the generation of macbecin analogues, said method comprising:\n\n \n \n \n \n \na) providing a first host strain that produces macbecin when cultured under appropriate conditions\n \nb) selectively deleting or inactivating mbcM, mbcMT1, mbcMT2, mbcP and mbcP450\n \nc) optionally selectively deleting or inactivating further post-PKS genes or starter unit biosynthesis genes\n \nd) feeding a non-natural starter unit to said strain\n \ne) culturing said modified host strain under suitable conditions for the production of macbecin analogues; and\n \nf) optionally isolating the compounds produced.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nIt is well known to those skilled in the art that polyketide gene clusters may be expressed in heterologous hosts (Pfeifer and Khosla, 2001). Accordingly, the present invention includes the transfer of the macbecin biosynthetic gene cluster, with or without resistance and regulatory genes, either otherwise complete or containing deletions, into a heterologous host. Alternatively, the complete macbecin biosynthetic cluster can be transferred into a heterologous host, with or without resistance and regulatory genes, and it can then be manipulated by the methods described herein to delete or inactivate one or more of the post-PKS genes or starter unit biosynthesis genes. Methods and vectors for the transfer as defined above of such large pieces of DNA are well known in the art (Rawlings, 2001; Staunton and Weissman, 2001) or are provided herein in the methods disclosed. In this context a preferred host cell strain is a prokaryote, more preferably an actinomycete or \nEscherichia coli\n, still more preferably include, but are not limited to \nActinosynnema mirum \n(\nA. mirum\n), \nActinosynnema pretiosum \nsubsp. \npretiosum \n(\nA. pretiosum\n), \nS. hygroscopicus, S. hygroscopicus \nsp., \nS. hygroscopicus \nvar. \nascomyceticus, Streptomyces tsukubaensis, Streptomyces coelicolor, Streptomyces lividans, Saccharopolyspora erythraea, Streptomyces fradiae, Streptomyces avermitilis, Streptomyces cinnamonensis, Streptomyces rimosus, Streptomyces albus, Streptomyces griseofuscus, Streptomyces longisporoflavus, Streptomyces venezuelae, Streptomyces albus, Micromonospora \nsp., \nMicromonospora griseorubida, Amycolatopsis mediterranei \nor \nActinoplanes \nsp. N902-109. Further examples include \nStreptomyces hygroscopicus \nsubsp. \ngeldanus \nand \nStreptomyces \nviolaceusniger.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the entire biosynthetic cluster is transferred. In an alternative embodiment the entire PKS is transferred without any of the associated starter unit biosynthesis genes and/or post-PKS genes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment the entire macbecin biosynthetic cluster is transferred and then manipulated according to the description herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an alternative aspect of the invention, the macbecin analogue(s) of the present invention may be further processed by biotransformation with an appropriate strain. The appropriate strain either being an available wild type strain for example, but without limitation \nActinosynnema mirum, Actinosynnema pretiosum \nsubsp. \npretiosum, S. hygroscopicus, S. hygroscopicus \nsp. Alternatively, an appropriate strain may be engineered to allow biotransformation with particular post-PKS enzymes for example, but without limitation, those encoded by mbcM, mbcN, mbcP, mbcMT2, mbcP450 (as defined herein), gdmN, gdmM, gdmL, gdmP, (Rascher et al., 2003) the geldanamycin O-methyl transferase, hbmN, hbmL, hbmP, (Rascher et al., 2005) herbimycin O-methyl transferases and further herbimycin mono-oxygenases, asm7, asm10, asm11, asm12, asm19 and asm21 (Cassady et al., 2004, Spiteller et al., 2003). Where genes have yet to be identified or the sequences are not in the public domain it is routine to those skilled in the art to acquire such sequences by standard methods. For example the sequence of the gene encoding the geldanamycin O-methyl transferase is not in the public domain, but one skilled in the art could generate a probe, either a heterologous probe using a similar O-methyl transferase, or a homologous probe by designing degenerate primers from available homologous genes to carry out Southern blots on a geldanamycin producing strain and thus acquire this gene to generate biotransformation systems.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a particular embodiment the strain may have had one or more of its native polyketide clusters deleted, either entirely or in part, or otherwise inactivated, so as to prevent the production of the polyketide produced by said native polyketide cluster. Said engineered strain may be selected from the group including, for example but without limitation, \nActinosynnema mirum, Actinosynnema pretiosum \nsubsp. \npretiosum, S. hygroscopicus, S. hygroscopicus \nsp., \nS. hygroscopicus \nvar. \nascomyceticus, Streptomyces tsukubaensis, Streptomyces coelicolor, Streptomyces lividans, Saccharopolyspora erythraea, Streptomyces fradiae, Streptomyces avermitills, Streptomyces cinnamonensis, Streptomyces rimosus, Streptomyces albus, Streptomyces griseofuscus, Streptomyces longisporoflavus, Streptomyces venezuelae, Micromonospora \nsp., \nMicromonospora griseorubida, Amycolatopsis mediterranei \nor \nActinoplanes \nsp. N902-109. Further possible strains include \nStreptomyces hygroscopicus \nsubsp. \ngeldanus \nand \nStreptomyces violaceusniger. \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough the process for preparation of the macbecin analogues of the invention as described above is substantially or entirely biosynthetic, it is not ruled out to produce or interconvert macbecin analogues of the invention by a process which comprises standard synthetic chemical methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to allow for the genetic manipulation of the macbecin PKS gene cluster, first the gene cluster was sequenced from \nActinosynnema pretiosum \nsubsp. \npretiosum \nhowever, a person of skill in the art will appreciate that there are alternative strains which produce macbecin, for example but without limitation \nActinosynnema mirum\n. The macbecin biosynthetic gene cluster from these strains may be sequenced as described herein for \nActinosynnema pretiosum \nsubsp. \npretiosum\n, and the information used to generate equivalent strains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso provided as an aspect of the invention are:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nmacbecin analogues obtainable or obtained by the aforementioned processes;\n \nan engineered strain based on a macbecin producing strain in which one or more of the starter unit biosynthesis genes have been deleted or inactivated;\n \nsuch a strain wherein one or more genes selected from AHk, Adh, Ahs, OX and PH in \nActinosynnema pretiosum \nsubsp. \npretiosum \nATCC 31280 (or homologues in other strains) are deleted or inactivated;\n \nsuch an engineered strain in which mbcM has not been deleted or inactivated;\n \nsuch an engineered strain in which mbcM, mbcMT1, mbcMT2, mbcP and mbcP450 have not been deleted or inactivated;\n \nAn engineered strain based on a macbecin producing strain in which mbcM and one or more of the starter unit biosynthetic genes and optionally further post-PKS genes have been deleted, for example a strain in which Ahs has been deleted or inactivated.\n \nsuch a strain wherein the macbecin producing strain is \nA pretiosum \nor \nA mirum. \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention are advantageous in that they may be expected to have one or more of the following properties: tight binding to Hsp90, fast on-rate of binding to Hsp90, good activity against one or more different cancer sub-types compared with the parent compound; good toxicological profile such as good hepatotoxicity profile, good nephrotoxicity, good cardiac safety; good water solubility; good metabolic stability; good formulation ability; good bioavailability; good pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic properties such as tight binding to Hsp90, fast on-rate of binding to Hsp90 and/or good brain pharmacokinetics; good cell uptake; and low binding to erythrocytes.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\nGeneral Methods\n\n\nFermentation of Cultures\n\n\n \n \n \nConditions used for growing the bacterial strains \nActinosynnema pretiosum \nsubsp. \npretiosum \nATCC 31280 (U.S. Pat.

The culture was then harvested for extraction.\n\n\n \n \nMedia\n \n \n\n\nMedium\n \n \n 1—Seed Medium\n\n\n \n \n \nIn 1 L of distilled water\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGlucose\n \n20\n \ng\n \n \n \n \n \nSoluble potato starch (Sigma)\n \n30\n \ng\n \n \n \n \n \nSpray dried corn steep liquor (Roquette Freres)\n \n10\n \ng\n \n \n \n \n \n‘Nutrisoy’ toasted soy flour (Archer Daniels Midland)\n \n10\n \ng\n \n \n \n \n \nPeptone from milk solids (Sigma)\n \n5\n \ng\n \n \n \n \n \nNaCl\n \n3\n \ng\n \n \n \n \n \nCaCO\n3\n \n \n5\n \ng\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAdjust pH with NaOH\n \n7.0\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nSterilsation by autoclaving at 121° C. for 20 minutes.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nApramycin was added when appropriate after autoclaving to give a final concentration of 50 mg/L.\n\n\n \n \nMedium\n 2—Fermentation Medium\n\n\n \n \n \nIn 1 L of distilled water\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGlycerol\n \n50 g\n \n \n \n \n \nSpray dried corn steep liquor (Roquette Freres)\n \n10 g\n \n \n \n \n \n‘Bacto’ yeast extract (Difco)\n \n20 g\n \n \n \n \n \nKH\n2\nPO\n4\n \n \n20 g\n \n \n \n \n \nMgCl\n2\n•6H\n2\nO\n \n 5 g\n \n \n \n \n \nCaCO\n3\n \n \n 1 g\n \n \n \n \n \nAdjust pH with NaOH\n \n6.5\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nSterilsation by autoclaving at 121° C. for 20 minutes.\n\n\n\n \n \nMedium\n 3—ISP2 Medium\n\n\n \n \n \nIn 1 L of distilled water\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMalt extract\n \n10 g\n \n \n \n \n \nYeast extract\n \n 4 g\n \n \n \n \n \nDextrose\n \n 4 g\n \n \n \n \n \nAgar\n \n15 g\n \n \n \n \n \nAdjust pH with NaOH\n \n7.3\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nSterilsation by autoclaving at 121° C. for 20 minutes.\n\n\n\n \n \nMedium\n 4—MAM\n\n\n \n \n \nIn 1 L of distilled water\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWheat starch\n \n10\n \ng\n \n \n \n \n \nCorn steep solids\n \n2.5\n \ng\n \n \n \n \n \nYeast extract\n \n3\n \ng\n \n \n \n \n \nCaCO\n3\n \n \n3\n \ng\n \n \n \n \n \nIron sulphate\n \n0.3\n \ng\n \n \n \n \n \nAgar\n \n20\n \ng\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nSterilsation by autoclaving at 121° C. for 20 minutes.\n\n\n\n \nExtraction of Culture Broths for LCMS Analysis\n\n\n \n \n \nCulture broth (1 mL) and ethyl acetate (1 mL) were mixed vigorously for 15-30 min followed by centrifugation for 10 min. 0.5 mL of the organic layer was collected, evaporated to dryness and then re-dissolved in 0.23 mL of methanol and 0.02 \nmL\n 1% iron (III) chloride.\n\n\n \nLCMS Analysis Procedure\n\n\n \n \n \nAnalytical LCMS was performed using \nLCMS method\n 1 on an Agilent HP1100 HPLC system in combination with a Bruker Daltonics Esquire 3000+electrospray mass spectrometer operating in positive and/or negative ion mode. LCMS method 1: chromatography was achieved over a Phenomenex Hyperclone column (C\n18 \nBDS, 3 micron particle size, 150×4.6 mm) eluting at a flow rate of 1 mL/min using the following gradient elution process; T=0, 10% B; T=2, 10% B; T=20, 100% B; T=22, 100% B; T=22.05, 10% B; T=25, 10% B. Mobile phase A=water+0.1% formic acid; mobile phase B=acetonitrile+0.1% formic acid. UV spectra were recorded between 190 and 400 nm, with extracted chromatograms taken at 210, 254 and 276 nm.

NMR spectra were referenced to the residual proton or standard carbon resonances of the solvents in which they were run.\n\n\n \nAssessment of Compound Purity\n\n\n \n \n \nPurified compounds were analysed using \nLCMS method\n 2 described. LCMS method 2: chromatography was achieved over a Phenomenex HyperClone C\n18\n-BDS column (4.6×150 mm, 3 micron particle size) eluting with a gradient of water+0.1% formic acid:acetonitrile+0.1% formic acid, (90:10) to (0:100), at 1 mL/min over 20 min. Purity was assessed by MS and at multiple wavelengths (210, 254 & 276 nm). All compounds were >95% pure at all wavelengths. Purity was finally confirmed by inspection of the \n1\nH and \n13\nC NMR spectra.\n\n\n \nAssessment of Water Solubility\n\n\n \n \n \nWater solubility may be tested as follows: A 10 mM stock solution of the macbecin analogue is prepared in 100% DMSO at room temperature. Triplicate 0.01 mL aliquots are made up to 0.5 mL with either 0.1 M PBS, pH 7.3 solution or 100% DMSO in amber vials. The resulting 0.2 mM solutions are shaken in the dark, at room temperature on an IKA® vibrax VXR shaker for 6 h, followed by transfer of the resulting solutions or suspensions into 2 mL Eppendorf tubes and centrifugation for 30 min at 13200 rpm.

The origin of the donor xenografts was described by Fiebig at al., (1999). Other cell lines were either obtained from the NCl (DU145, MCF-7) or purchased from DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll cell lines, unless otherwise specified, were grown at 37° C. in a humidified atmosphere (95% air, 5% CO\n2\n) in a ‘ready-mix’ medium containing RPMI 1640 medium, 10% fetal calf serum, and 0.1 mg/mL gentamicin (PAA, Cölbe, Germany).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA modified propidium iodide assay was used to assess the effects of the test compound(s) on the growth of human tumour cell lines (Dengler et al., (1995)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBriefly, cells were harvested from exponential phase cultures by trypsinization, counted and plated in 96 well flat-bottomed microtitre plates at a cell density dependent on the cell line (5-10.000 viable cells/well). After 24 h recovery to allow the cells to resume exponential growth, 0.010 mL of culture medium (6 control wells per plate) or culture medium containing the macbecin analogue was added to the wells. Each concentration was plated in triplicate. Compounds were applied in five concentrations (100; 10; 1; 0.1 and 0.01 μg/ml). Following 4 days of continuous exposure, cell culture medium with or without test compound was replaced by 0.2 mL of an aqueous propidium iodide (PI) solution (7 mg/L). To measure the proportion of living cells, cells may be permeabilized by freezing the plates. After thawing the plates, fluorescence was measured using the Cytofluor 4000 microplate reader (excitation 530 nm, emission 620 nm), giving a direct relationship to the total number of viable cells. Growth inhibition may be expressed as treated/control×100 (% T/C). This can be plotted as a graph of % T/C against concentration of test compound applied, which can then be used to calculate the concentration necessary to inhibit cell growth by 70% (IC\n70\n).\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\nSequencing of the Macbecin PKS Gene Cluster\n\n\n \n \n \nGenomic DNA was isolated from \nActinosynnema pretiosum \n(ATCC 31280) and \nActinosynnema mirum \n(DSM 43827, ATCC 29888) using standard protocols described in Kieser et al., (2000). DNA sequencing was carried out by the sequencing facility of the Biochemistry Department, University of Cambridge, Tennis Court Road, \nCambridge CB2\n 1 QW using standard procedures.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrimers BIOSG104 5′-GGTCTAGAGGTCAGTGCCCCCGCGTACCGTCGT-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 1) AND BIOSG105 5′-GGCATATGCTTGTGCTCGGGCTCAAC-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 2) were employed to amplify the carbamoyltransferase-encoding gene gdmN from the geldanamycin biosynthetic gene cluster of \nStreptomyces hygroscopicus \nNRRL 3602 (Accession number of sequence: AY179507) using standard techniques. Southern blot experiments were carried out using the DIG Reagents and Kits for Non-Radioactive Nucleic Acid Labelling and Detection according to the manufacturers' instructions (Roche). The DIG-labelled gdmN DNA fragment was used as a heterologous probe. Using the gdmN generated probe and genomic DNA isolated from \nA. pretiosum \n2112 an approximately 8 kb EcoRI fragment was identified in Southern blot analysis. The fragment was cloned into \nLitmus\n 28 applying standard procedures and transformants were identified by colony hybridization. The clone p3 was isolated and the approximately 7.7 kb insert was sequenced. DNA isolated from clone p3 was digested with EcoRI and EcoRI/SacI and the bands at around 7.7 kb and at about 1.2 kb were isolated, respectively. Labelling reactions were carried out according to the manufacturers' protocols. Cosmid libraries of the two strains named above were created using the \nvector SuperCos\n 1 and the Gigapack III XL packaging kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturers' instructions. These two libraries were screened using standard protocols and as a probe, the DIG-labelled fragments of the 7.7 kb EcoRI fragment derived from clone p3 were used. Cosmid 52 was identified from the cosmid library of \nA. pretiosum \nand submitted for sequencing to the sequencing facility of the Biochemistry Department of the University of Cambridge. Similarly, cosmid 43 and cosmid 46 were identified from the cosmid library of \nA. mirum\n. All three cosmids contain the 7.7 kb EcoRI fragment as shown by Southern Blot analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn around 0.7 kbp fragment of the PKS region of cosmid 43 was amplified using \nprimers BIOSG124\n 5′-CCCGCCCGCGCGAGCGGCGCGTGGCCGCCCGAGGGC-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 3) and \nBIOSG125\n 5′-GCGTCCTCGCGCAGCCACGCCACCAGCAGCTCCAGC-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 4) applying standard protocols, cloned and used as a probe for screening the \nA. pretiosum \ncosmid library for overlapping clones. The sequence information of cosmid 52 was also used to create probes derived from DNA fragments amplified by \nprimers BIOSG130\n 5′-CCAACCCCGCCGCGTCCCCGGCCGCGCCGAACACG-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 5) and \nBIOSG131\n 5′-GTCGTCGGCTACGGGCCGGTGGGGCAGCTGCTGT-5′ (SEQ ID NO: 6) as well as \nBIOSG132\n 5′-GTCGGTGGACTGCCCTGCGCCTGATCGCCCTGCGC-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 7) and \nBIOSG133\n 5′-GGCCGGTGGTGCTGCCCGAGGACGGGGAGCTGCGG-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 8) which were used for screening the cosmid library of \nA. pretiosum\n. Cosmids 311 and 352 were isolated and cosmid 352 was sent for sequencing. Cosmid 352 contains an overlap of approximately 2.7 kb with cosmid 52. To screen for further cosmids, an approximately 0.6 kb PCR fragment was amplified using \nprimers BIOSG136\n 5′-CACCGCTCGCGGGGGTGGCGCGGCGCACGACGTGG CTGC-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 9) and BIOSG 137 5′-CCTCCTCGGACAGCGCGATCAGCGCCGCGC ACAGCGAG-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 10) and cosmid 311 as template applying standard protocols. The cosmid library of \nA. pretiosum \nwas screened and cosmid 410 was isolated. It overlaps approximately 17 kb with cosmid 352 and was sent for sequencing.

Construction of Plasmid pLSS308\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe DNA sequences of the gdmM gene from the geldanamycin biosynthetic gene cluster of \nStreptomyces hygroscopicus \nstrain NRRL 3602 (AY179507) and orf19 from the rifamycin biosynthetic gene cluster of \nAmycolatopsis mediterranei \n(AF040570 AF040571) were aligned using Vector NTI sequence alignment program. This alignment identified regions of homology that were suitable for the design of degenerate oligos that were used to amplify a fragment of the homologous gene from \nActinosynnema mirum \n(BIOT-3134; DSM43827; ATCC29888). The degenerate oligos are:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(SEQ ID NO: 12)\n \n \n \n \n \nFPLS1: 5′: ccscgggcgnycngsttcgacngygag 3′;\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(SEQ ID NO: 13)\n \n \n \n \n \nFPLS3: 5′: cgtcncggannccggagcacatgccctg 3′;\n \n \n \n \n \n\nwhere N=G, A, T or C; Y=C or T; S=G or C\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe template for PCR amplification was \nActinosynnema minim \ncosmid 43. The generation of cosmid 43 is described in Example 1 above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOligos FPLS1 and FPLS3 were used to amplify the internal fragment of a gdmM homologue from \nActinosynnema minim \nin a standard PCR reaction using cosmid 43 as the template and Taq DNA polymerase. The resultant 793 bp PCR product was cloned into pUC19 that had been linearised with SmaI, resulting in plasmid pLSS301. It was postulated that the amplified sequence is from the mcbM gene of the macbecin cluster of \nA. mirum\n. Plasmid pLSS301 was digested with EcoRI/HindIII and the fragment cloned into plasmid pKC1132 (Bierman et al., 1992) that had been digested with EcoRI/HindIII. The resultant plasmid, designated pLSS308, is apramycin resistant and contains an internal fragment of the \nA. mirum \nmbcM gene.\n\n\n \n \n2.2 Transformation of \nActinosynnema pretiosum \nsubsp. \npretiosum \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nEscherichia coli \nET12567, harbouring the plasmid pUZ8002 was transformed with pLSS308 by electroporation to generate the \nE. coli \ndonor strain for conjugation. This strain was used to transform \nActinosynnema pretiosum \nsubsp. \npretiosum \nby vegetative conjugation (Matsushima et al., 1994). Exconjugants were plated on \nMedium\n 4 and incubated at 28° C. Plates were overlayed after 24 h with 50 mg/L apramycin and 25 mg/L nalidixic acid. As pLSS308 is unable to replicate in \nActinosynnema pretiosum \nsubsp. \npretiosum\n, any apramycin resistant colonies were anticipated to be transformants that contained plasmid integrated into the mbcM gene of the chromosome by homologous recombination via the plasmid borne mcbM internal fragment (\nFIG. 3\n). This results in two truncated copies of the mbcM gene on the chromosome. Transformants were confirmed by PCR analysis and the amplified fragment was sequenced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nColonies were patched onto Medium 4 (with 50 mg/L apramycin and 25 mg/L nalidixic acid). A 6 mm circular plug from each patch was used to inoculate individual 50 mL falcon tubes containing 10 mL seed medium (variant of Medium 1-2% glucose, 3% soluble starch, 0.5% corn steep solids, 1% soybean flour, 0.5% peptone, 0.3% sodium chloride, 0.5% calcium carbonate) plus 50 mg/L apramycin. These seed cultures were incubated for 2 days at 28° C., 200 rpm with a 5 cm throw. These were then used to inoculate (5% v/v) fermentation medium (Medium 2) and were grown at 28° C. for 24 hours and then at 26° C. for a further 5 days. Metabolites were extracted from these according to the standard protocol described above. Samples were assessed for production of macbecin analogues by HPLC using the standard protocol described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe productive isolate selected was designated BIOT-3806.\n\n\n \n \n2.3 Identification of Compounds from BIOT-3806\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSamples were analysed as described in General Methods using \nLCMS method\n 1.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\ncompounds identified by LCMS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound\n\n\nRetention time (min)\n\n\n[M + Na]\n+\n \n\n\n[M − H]\n−\n \n\n\n \nMass\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\n11.4\n\n\n525.2\n\n\n501.2\n\n\n502\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15\n\n\n9.7\n\n\n541.1\n\n\n517.1\n\n\n518\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n\n8.6\n\n\n506.1\n\n\n482.1\n\n\n483\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB\n\n\n9.3\n\n\n539.2\n\n\n515.1\n\n\n516\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n10.9\n\n\n543.1\n\n\n519.2\n\n\n520\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 3\n\n\nGeneration of BIOT-3870: an \nActinosynnema pretiosum \nStrain in which the gdmM Homologue mbcM has an in-frame Deletion\n\n\n \n \n \n3.1 Cloning of DNA Homologous to the Downstream Flanking Region of mbcM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOligos BV145 (SEQ ID NO: 14) and BV146 (SEQ ID NO: 15) were used to amplify a 1421 bp region of DNA from \nActinosynnema pretiosum \n(ATCC 31280) in a standard PCR reaction using cosmid 52 (from example 1) as the template and Pfu DNA polymerase.

This 2816 bp SpeI/XbaI fragment was cloned into pKC1132 (Bierman et al., 1992) that had been linearised with SpeI to create pWV320.\n\n\n \n \n3.3 Transformation of \nActinosynnema pretiosum \nsubsp. \npretiosum \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nEscherichia coli \nET12567, harbouring the plasmid pUZ8002 was transformed with pWV320 by electroporation to generate the \nE. coli\n/donor strain for conjugation.

As pWV320 is unable to replicate in \nActinosynnema pretiosum \nsubsp. \npretiosum\n, apramycin resistant colonies were anticipated to be transformants that contained plasmid pWV320 integrated into the chromosome by homologous recombination via one of the plasmid borne mbcM flanking regions of homology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenomic DNA was isolated from six exconjugants and was digested and analysed by Southern blot. The blot showed that in four out of the six isolates integration had occurred in the upstream region of homology and in two of the six isolates homologous integration had occurred in the downstream region. One strain resulting from homologous integration in the upstream region (designated BIOT-3831) was chosen for screening for secondary crosses. One strain resulting from homologous integration in the downstream region (BIOT-3832) was also chosen for screening for secondary crosses.\n\n\n \n3.4 Screening for Secondary Crosses\n\n\n \n \n \nStrains were patched onto medium 4 (supplemented with 50 mg/L apramycin) and grown at 28° C. for four days. A 1 cm\n2 \nsection of each patch was used to inoculate 7 mL modified ISP2 (0.4% yeast extract, 1% malt extract, 0.4% dextrose in 1 L distilled water) without antibiotic in a 50 mL falcon tube. Cultures were grown for 2-3 days then subcultured on (5% inoculum) into another 7 mL modified ISP2 (see above) in a 50 mL falcon tube. After 4-5 generations of subculturing the cultures were sonicated, serially diluted, plated on \nMedium\n 4 and incubated at 28° C. for four days. Single colonies were then patched in duplicate onto \nMedium\n 4 containing apramycin and onto \nMedium\n 4 containing no antibiotic and the plates were incubated at 28° C. for four days. Patches that grew on the no antibiotic plate but did not grow on the apramycin plate were re-patched onto +/−apramycin plates to confirm that they had lost the antibiotic marker. The mutant strain encodes an mbcM protein with an in-frame deletion of 502 amino acids (\nFIG. 6A\n, SEQ ID NOs: 20 and 21; \nFIG. 6B\n shows the encoded protein sequence, SEQ ID NO: 22).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nmbcM deletion mutants were patched onto \nMedium\n 4 and grown at 28° C. for four days. A 6 mm circular plug from each patch was used to inoculate individual 50 mL falcon tubes containing 10 mL seed medium (adapted from medium 1-2% glucose, 3% soluble starch, 0.5% corn steep solids, 1% soybean flour, 0.5% peptone, 0.3% sodium chloride, 0.5% calcium carbonate). These seed cultures were incubated for 2 days at 28° C., 200 rpm with a 2 inch throw. These were then used to inoculate (0.5 mL into 10 mL) production medium (medium 2-5% glycerol, 1% corn steep solids, 2% yeast extract, 2% potassium dihydrogen phosphate, 0.5% magnesium chloride, 0.1% calcium carbonate) and were grown at 28° C. for 24 hours and then at 26° C. for a further 5 days. Secondary metabolites were extracted and analysed by LCMS for production of macbecin analogues as described in General Methods.\n\n\n \n \n3.5 Identification of 14 and 15 from BIOT-3872\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExtracts of the fermentation described in Example 3.4 were generated and assayed by LCMS as described in General Methods using \nLCMS method\n 1.

Analysis of the relationship between the observed structures and the biosynthetic pathway indicates that a number of enzymes are not functioning in addition to MbcM. In the case of \ncompound\n 15 these are MbcP, MbcMT1 and MbcMT2 and in the case of \ncompound\n 14 function of MbcP450 is also not observed. As described above there can be a number of reasons why these proteins may not be functional in this system, for example compounds 14 and 15 represent novel structures for these enzymes and they may poor substrates or not substrates at all.\n\n\n \n3.6 Selection of Individual Colonies by Generating Protoplasts of BIOT-3872\n\n\n \n \n \nProtoplasts were generated from BIOT-3872 using a method adapted from Weber and Losick 1988 with the following media alterations; \nActinosynnema pretiosum \ncultures were grown on ISP2 plates (medium 3) for 3 days at 28° C. and a 5 mm\n2 \nscraping used to inoculate 40 ml of ISP2 broth supplemented with 2 ml of sterile 10% (w/v) glycine in water.

The majority of protoplast generated patches produced at similar low levels to the parental strain. 15 out of the 80 samples tested produced significantly more 14 and 15 than the parental strain. The best producing strain, BIOT-3870 (also named WV4a-33) was observed to produce 14 and 15 at significantly higher levels than the parent strain and was selected for use in future experiments. Additionally, BIOT-3970 was isolated as an alternative isolate of the same strain. BIOT-3870 and BIOT-3970 can be used interchangeably.\n\n\n \nExample 4\n\n\nFeeding to WV4a-33 to generate 4,5-dihydro-11-O-desmethyl-15-desmethoxy-18,21-didesoxymacbecin\n\n\n \n \n \n4.1 Biotransformation of 3-amino-benzoic acid with WV4a-33 (BIOT-3870)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWV4a-33 was patched onto MAM plates (medium 4) and grown at 28° C. for three days.

These seed cultures were incubated for 65 hours at 28° C., 200 rpm with a 2 inch throw.

Two 6 mm circular plugs were used to inoculate 250 ml conical shake flasks containing 30 mL seed medium (adapted from medium 1-2% glucose, 3% soluble starch, 0.5% corn steep solids, 1% soybean flour, 0.5% peptone, 0.3% sodium chloride, 0.5% calcium carbonate). Six flasks were inoculated. These seed cultures were incubated for 65 hours at 28° C., 200 rpm with a 1 inch throw. These were then used to inoculate (1 mL into 10 mL) 170 falcon tubes each containing 10 ml of modified production medium (adapted from medium 2-5% glycerol, 1% corn steep solids, 2% yeast extract, 2% potassium dihydrogen phosphate, 0.5% magnesium chloride, 0.1% calcium carbonate media is left to sediment for 2-60 days and the top layer is taken as the production medium) and were grown at 26° C. for 24 hours. 0.1 mL of a 200 mM feed stock solution (3-aminobenzoic acid dissolved in methanol) was added to each falcon tube to give a final feed concentration of 2 mM. Tubes were incubated for a further 6 days at 26° C. The cultures were pooled (approximately 1.4 l) and the falcon tubes were washed (each with 7 ml of water). The washing liquid was pooled (approximately 1.4 l). The pooled cultures and washing liquids were used for isolation of 4,5-dihydro-11-O-desmethyl-15-desmethoxy-18,21-didesoxymacbecin (approximately 3 L in total). In parallel, the seed cultures were used to inoculate 30 ml of modified production medium (3 ml) followed by the same incubation and feeding regime as described above (final feed concentration of 2 mM). The flasks were incubated in a 2 inch throw shaker. Production levels were estimated by LCMS as being approximately between 50% and 90% of those measured for the falcon tube production cultures.\n\n\n5.2 Isolation and Characterisation of 4,5-dihydro-11-O-desmethyl-15-desmethoxy-18,21-didesoxymacbecin\n\n\nThe fermentation broth (3 L) was extracted two times with an equal volume of ethyl acetate (EtOAc).

This strain was used to transform BIOT-3870 by vegetative conjugation (Matsushima et al, 1994). Exconjugants were plated on MAM medium (1% wheat starch, 0.25% corn steep solids, 0.3% yeast extract, 0.3% calcium carbonate, 0.03% iron sulphate, 2% agar) and incubated at 28° C. Plates were overlayed after 24 h with 50 mg/L apramycin and 25 mg/L nalidixic acid. As pLSS315 is unable to replicate in BIOT-3870, apramycin resistant colonies were anticipated to be transformants that contained plasmid integrated into the chromosome by homologous recombination via the plasmid borne regions of homology.\n\n\n \n9.4 Screening for Secondary Crosses\n\n\n \n \n \nThree primary transformants of BIOT-3870:pLSS315 were selected for subculturing to screen for secondary crosses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStrains were patched onto MAM media (supplemented with 50 mg/L apramycin) and grown at 28° C. for four days. Two 6 mm circular plugs were used to inoculate 30 mL of ISP2 (0.4% yeast extract, 1% malt extract, 0.4% dextrose, not supplemented with antibiotic) in a 250 ml conical flask. Cultures were grown for 2-3 days then subcultured (5% inoculum) into 30 mL of ISP2 in a 250 ml conical flask. After 4-5 rounds of subculturing the cultures were protoplasted as described in Example 3.6, the protoplasts were serially diluted, plated on regeneration media (see Example 3.6) and incubated at 28° C. for four days. Single colonies were then patched in duplicate onto MAM media containing apramycin and onto MAM media containing no antibiotic and the plates were incubated at 28° C. for four days. Seven patches derived from clone no 1 (no 32-37) and four patches derived from clone no 3 (no 38-41) that grew on the no antibiotic plate but did not grow on the apramycin plate were re-patched onto +/−apramycin plates to confirm that they had lost the antibiotic marker.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProduction of macbecin analogues was carried out as described in the General Methods. Analysis was performed as described in General Methods using \nLCMS method\n 1. \nCompound\n 14 was produced in yields comparable to the parent strain BIOT-3870 and no production of \ncompound\n 15 was observed for \n \n \n \n \n \npatches\n \n \n \n \n \n 33, 34, 35, 37, 39 and 41. This result shows that the desired mutant strains have a deletion of 3892 bp of the macbecin cluster containing the genes mbcP, mbcP450, mbcMT1 and mbcMT2 in addition to the original deletion of mbcM. This strain was given the designation BIOT-3982.\n\n\n \nExample 10\n\n\nBinding to Hsp90\n\n\n \n \n \nIsothermal titration calorimetry and K\nd \ndeterminations. Yeast Hsp90 was dialysed against 20 mM Tris pH 7.5 containing 1 mM EDTA and 5 mM NaCl and then diluted to 0.008 mM in the same buffer, but containing 2% DMSO. The test compounds were dissolved in 100% DMSO at a concentration of 50 mM and subsequently diluted to 0.1 mM in the same buffer as for Hsp90 with 2% DMSO. Heats of interaction were measured at 30° C. on a MSC system (Microcal), with a cell volume of 1.458 mL. 10 aliquots of 0.027 mL of 0.100 mM of each test compound were injected into 0.008 mM yeast Hsp90. Heats of dilution were determined in a separate experiment by injecting the test compound into buffer containing 2% DMSO, and the corrected data fitted using a nonlinear least square curve-fitting algorithm (Microcal Origin) with three floating variables: stoichiometry, binding constant and change in enthalpy of interaction.

Mutasynthesis with substituted benzoic acid analogues can therefore be more efficient, also leading to simpler purification.\n\n\n \n \n15.1 Construction of the Plasmid pKC1132Ahscloneno8\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOligos CM453 (SEQ ID NO: 29) and CM452 (SEQ ID NO: 30) were used to amplify a ˜0.8 kb by region of DNA from Actinosynnema pretiosum (ATCC 31280) in a standard PCR reaction using cosmid 52 (from example 1) as the template and KOD DNA polymerase. A 5′ extension was designed in each oligo to introduce restriction sites to potentially aid cloning of the amplified fragment, although blunt end cloning was actually used. The amplified PCR product (PCR52/53) encoded an internal fragment of the Ahs gene. This ˜0.8 kb fragment was cloned into pKC1132 that had been linearised with EcoRV, resulting in plasmid pKC1132Ahscloneno8.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(SEQ ID NO: 29)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCM453\n \nATAT\nGAATTC\nTAGACCGCCCGGAACGCCATGAACG\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    EcoRI\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(SEQ ID NO: 30)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCM452\n \nATAT\nAAGCTT\nGTCACCAACGGGACGCACGCGCTGG\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    HindIII\n \n \n \n \n \n\n15.2 Transformation of \nActinosynnema pretiosum \nsubsp. \npretiosum \nBIOT-3982\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nEscherichia coli \nET12567, harbouring the plasmid pUZ8002 was transformed with pKC1132Ahscloneno8 by electroporation to generate the \nE. coli \ndonor strain for conjugation. This strain is used to transform \nActinosynnema pretiosum \nsubsp. \npretiosum \nBIOT-3982 by vegetative conjugation (Matsushima et al, 1994). Exconjugants are plated on \nMedium\n 4 and incubated at 28° C. Plates are overlayed after 24 h with 50 mg/L apramycin and 25 mg/L nalidixic acid. As pKC1132Ahscloneno8 is unable to replicate in \nActinosynnema pretiosum \nsubsp. \npretiosum \nBIOT-3982, apramycin resistant colonies are anticipated to be transformants that contain plasmid pKC1132Ahscloneno8 integrated into the chromosome via homologous recombination within the mbcAhs gene (\nFIG. 11\n). Confirmation of correct homologous recombination can be confirmed by Southern blot and PCR. The strain is designated as Actinosynnema pretiosum subsp. \npretiosum \nBIOT-3982AhsX. When grown under normal conditions, and without supplementation with AHBA, the strain is seen to produce no or much lower levels of 14.\n\n\n \nExample 16\n\n\nFeeding to \nActinosynnema pretiosum \nsubsp. \nPretiosum \nBIOT-3982AhsX to Generate Novel Macbecin Analogues\n\n\n \n \n \n16.1 Biotransformation using \nActinosynnema pretiosum \nsubsp. \npretiosum \nBIOT-3982AhsX\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nActinosynnema pretiosum \nsubsp. \npretiosum \nBIOT-3982AhsX, generation of which is described in example 15, is patched onto MAM plates (medium 4) and grown at 28° C. for three days. A 6 mm circular plug is used to inoculate individual 50 mL falcon tubes containing 10 mL seed medium (adapted from medium 1-2% glucose, 3% soluble starch, 0.5% corn steep solids, 1% soybean flour, 0.5% peptone, 0.3% sodium chloride, 0.5% calcium carbonate). These seed cultures are incubated for 65 hours at 28° C., 200 rpm with a 2 inch throw. These are then used to inoculate (1 mL into 10 mL) modified production medium (adapted from medium 2-5% glycerol, 1% corn steep solids, 2% yeast extract, 2% potassium dihydrogen phosphate, 0.5% magnesium chloride, 0.1% calcium carbonate media is left to sediment for 2-60 days and the top layer is taken as the production medium) and are grown at 26° C. for 24 hours. 0.1 mL of a 200 mM feed stock solution (in methanol—see list in table 16) is added to each falcon tube to give a final feed concentration of 2 mM. Tubes are incubated for a further 6 days at 26° C.\n\n\n \n16.2 Identification of Novel Macbecins by LCMS in Culture Extracts\n\n\n \n \n \nExtracts of the fermentation described in example 16.1 are generated and assayed by LCMS as described in General Methods. In all cases, the major ansamycin expected to be observed is described in table 16, and these ansamycins should not be seen in extracts of fermentations which are unfed. The table describes the substituted benzoic acid analogue which is fed to the strain, the LCMS masses, and the mass of the compound to be produced.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\ncompounds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment\n\n\nAHBA analogue\n\n\nCompound\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nnumber\n\n\nfed\n\n\nproduced\n\n\n[M + Na]\n+\n \n\n\n[M − H]\n−\n \n\n\nMass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n16A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16\n\n\n509.3\n\n\n485.2\n\n\n486\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n16B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17\n\n\n527.3\n\n\n503.3\n\n\n504\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n16C\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\n527.2\n\n\n503.1\n\n\n504\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nREFERENCES\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\nAllen, I.

A pharmaceutical composition comprising an effective amount of a humanized monoclonal antibody according to \nclaim 1\n and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. Description\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to glucagon receptor polypeptide antagonists which inhibit the binding of the hormone glucagon to its receptor. More particularly, the present invention relates to high affinity glucagon receptor antibodies or Fab fragments thereof that inhibit binding of glucagon to its receptor and their use in the treatment or prevention of type 2 diabetes (NIDDM) and related disorders in mammalian species.\n\n\nBACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION\n\n\nGlucagon is 29 amino acid peptide hormone produced by pancreatic α-cells in response to low blood glucose levels. Glucagon binds to a membrane-associated glucagon receptor on the surface of hepatocytes, which triggers a G-protein signal transduction cascade, activating intracellular cyclic AMP and leading to release of glucose through denovo synthesis (gluconeogenesis) and glycogen breakdown (glycogenolysis).\n\n\nUnson et al., disclose polyclonal antibodies raised against synthetic peptides corresponding to two extracellular portions of the rat receptor. In the assay disclosed, polyclonal antibodies raised against amino acid residues 126-137 and 206-219 were found to block binding of glucagon to the receptor in rat liver membranes (Unson et al., PNAS Vol. 93, pp. 310-315, January 1996).\n\n\nBuggy et al., discloses the preparation of a monoclonal antibody that is said to compete with glucagon for the hormone binding site of the receptor in an in vitro assay (Buggy et al., Horm. Metab. Res. 28 (1996) 215-219). In the assay disclosed the antibody, given the designation CIV395.7A, recognizes the human and rat glucagon receptors, but not mouse. In order to develop antibodies for human therapeutic treatments it is commonly necessary to perform pre-clinical efficacy and safety studies in validated rat and/or murine animal models. It would therefore greatly facilitate drug development of a therapeutic antibody and thus be highly desirable to provide a pre-clinical therapeutic antibody candidates that are able to bind rat, murine and human forms of the glucagon receptor.\n\n\nWright et al., disclose a monoclonal antibody designated hGR-2 F6 and the amino acid sequence of a Fab fragment thereof. This antibody has been raised in a mouse against the human glucagon receptor and described in the disclosed assay as a competitive antagonist at this receptor (Wright et al., Acta Cryst. (2000) D56, 573-580). The applicant has found that hGR-2 F6 binds to the rat and murine forms of the glucagon receptor with only low affinity, and no therapeutic efficacy has been found for hGR-2F6 in a diabetic rat in vivo model at high doses. In particular, this antibody was unable to reduce blood serum glucose in the rat model with any statistical significance (unpublished).\n\n\nThe applicant has identified a need to provide therapeutic monoclonal antibodies that will bind with high affinity to the glucagon receptor and thereby inhibit the binding of glucagon thereto, to provide effective treatments for diabetes, preferably type 2 diabetes and related disorders. Furthermore, in order to allow pre-clinical drug development of an antibody it is clearly desirable to provide monoclonal antibodies that can bind to the human, rat and murine forms of the glucagon receptor to allow obligatory pre-clinical safety and efficacy studies to be undertaken.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to novel monoclonal antibodies or Fab fragments thereof that are able to specifically bind with a high affinity to native glucagon receptors of human, rat and murine origin. Furthermore, the present inventors provide monoclonal antibodies or Fab fragments thereof that not only bind glucagon receptors of multiple origins, but for the first time provide glucagon receptor binding monoclonal antibodies that show in vivo efficacy in their ability to reduce blood serum glucose.\n\n\nIn a first aspect the present invention relates to a Fab fragment or humanized monoclonal antibody comprising said Fab fragment, wherein said Fab fragment capable of binding to human, rat and murine glucagon receptors and inhibits glucagon binding to each receptor with a Ki of less than 50 nM.\n\n\nIn a further unexpected finding the inventors for the first time provide antibodies or Fab fragments thereof capable of specifically binding to the glucagon receptor that are able to significantly increase in vivo serum concentrations of GLP-1. Increasing serum levels of GLP-1 is known in the art to enhance β-cell function, reduce glucagon secretion and delay gastric emptying and is recognized as being highly advantageous in the treatment of diabetes type 2 and associated conditions.\n\n\nIn a second aspect, the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising an effective amount of a Fab fragment or humanized monoclonal antibody according to the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.\n\n\nIn a third aspect, the invention provides a method of treating type 1 or type 2 diabetes and in the achievement of weight loss in a human, wherein said method comprises administrating an effective amount of a Fab fragment or humanized monoclonal antibody according to the present invention, to a patient in need thereof.\n\n\nA fourth aspect of the invention comprises a Fab fragment or humanized monoclonal antibody according to the present invention for use as a medicament.\n\n\nA fifth aspect of the invention of relates to the use of a Fab fragment or humanized monoclonal antibody according to the present invention in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or prevention of type 1 or type 2 diabetes or in the achievement of weight loss in a human.\n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to a Fab fragment or humanized monoclonal antibody comprising said Fab fragment, wherein said Fab fragment is capable of binding to human, rat and murine glucagon receptors and inhibits glucagon binding to each receptor with a Ki of less than 50 nM.\n\n\nThe invention also provides monoclonal antibodies, which in addition to the glucagon receptors of human, rat and murine origin, are also able to bind with a high affinity to the glucagon receptor of a cynomologous monkey. Preferably, the Fab fragment or humanized monoclonal antibody comprising said Fab fragment therefore also inhibits glucagon binding to a cynomologous monkey glucagon receptor with a Ki of less than 50 nM. Preferably the Fab fragment or humanized monoclonal antibody comprising said Fab fragment has a Ki at each of the named glucagon receptors of less than 30 nM, more preferably less than 20 nM, further preferred less than 10 nM. Further preferred the Fab fragment has an in vitro Ki at the rat, murine and cyno receptors of less than 20 nM and in vitro Ki at the human receptor of less than 5 nM. More preferably the Ki of the Fab fragment, and in particular at the human glucagon receptor, is from 0.1 nM to 15 nM, most preferably from 1 to 10 nM.\n\n\nA Fab fragment or humanized monoclonal antibody comprising said Fab fragment according to the present invention preferably has a functional binding affinity (Kb) at the human and rat glucagon receptors of at least 100 nM. Further preferred the Fab fragment or humanized monoclonal antibody comprising said Fab fragment has a functional binding affinity at these receptors of at least 50 nM, more preferably at least 10 nM. In a most preferred embodiment the Fab fragment or humanized monoclonal antibody comprising said Fab fragment has a functional binding affinity at the human and rat glucagon receptor of 1 to 10 nM.\n\n\nIn a particularly unexpected finding, the applicant has noted a very rapid rate at which serum GLP-1 is increased and serum blood glucose decreased on in vivo exposure to the Fab fragment or humanized monoclonal antibody comprising said Fab fragment having the binding properties identified in accordance with this invention. In order to maximize this favourable effect it is preferable that the Fab fragment or humanized monoclonal antibody comprising said Fab fragment does not appreciably bind to the GLP receptor i.e. Ki greater than 5000 nM.\n\n\nDescription Of The Sequences\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 1 to 22 refer to the light and heavy chain CDRs of Table 1:\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 23 to 30 refer to preferred human framework regions described herein:\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 31 and 32 are amino acid and cDNA sequences of the human GluR:\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 33 and 34 are amino acid and cDNA sequences of the rat GluR:\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 35 and 36 are amino acid and cDNA sequences of the murine GluR:\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 37 and 38 are amino acid and cDNA sequences of the cyno GluR:\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 39 and 40 are the variable region amino acid sequences of example 1 (Ab1)\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 41 and 42 are the variable region amino acid sequences of example 2 (Ab2)\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 43 and 44 are the variable region amino acid sequences of example 3 (Ab3)\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 45 and 46 are the variable region amino acid sequences of example 4 (Ab4)\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 45 and 47 are the variable region amino acid sequences of example 5 (Ab5)\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 45 and 48 are the variable region amino acid sequences of example 6 (Ab6)\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 45 and 49 are the variable region amino acid sequences of example 7 (Ab7)\n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 50 refers to a preferred kappa light chain IgG4 constant region.\n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 51 refers to a preferred heavy chain CH1 constant domain.\n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 52 refers to a preferred modified human IgG4 Fc region.\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 53 to 55 refer to preferred light chain CDRs.\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 56 to 68 refer to preferred heavy chain CDRs.\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 59 and 60 are light and heavy chain protein sequences of example 1 (Ab1).\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 61 and 62 are light and heavy chain protein sequences of example 2 (Ab2).\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 63 and 64 are light and heavy chain protein sequences of example 3 (Ab3).\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 65 and 66 are light and heavy chain protein sequences of example 4 (Ab4).\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 65 and 67 are light and heavy chain protein sequences of example 5 (Ab5).\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 65 and 68 are light and heavy chain protein sequences of example 6 (Ab6).\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 65 and 69 are light and heavy chain protein sequences of example 7 (Ab7).\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 70 and 71 are light and heavy chain DNA sequences of example 1 (Ab1).\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 72 and 73 are light and heavy chain DNA sequences of example 2 (Ab2).\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 74 and 75 are light and heavy chain DNA sequences of example 3 (Ab3).\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 76 and 77 are light and heavy chain DNA sequences of example 4 (Ab4).\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 76 and 78 are light and heavy chain DNA sequences of example 5 (Ab5).\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 76 and 79 are light and heavy chain DNA sequences of example 6 (Ab6).\n\n\nSEQ ID NOS 76 and 80 are light and heavy chain DNA sequences of example 7 (Ab7).\n\n\nDefinitions\n\n\n\n\n\nThe “glucagon receptor” also referred to herein as “GluR” belongs to the G protein-coupled receptor class 2 family consisting of a long amino terminal extracellular domain, seven transmembrane segments, and an intracellular C-terminal domain. Glucagon receptors are notably expressed on the surface of hepatocytes where they bind to glucagon and transduce the signal provided thereby into the cell. DNA sequences encoding glucagon receptors of rat and human origin have been isolated and disclosed in the art (EP0658200B1). The murine and cynomologous monkey homologues have also been isolated and sequenced (Burcelin, et al., Gene 164 (1995) 305-310); McNally et al., Peptides 25 (2004) 1171-1178).\n\n\nThe term “inhibits” as used herein with respect to an activity of an antibody or Fab fragment thereof of the invention means the ability to substantially antagonize the biological activity of the glucagon receptor. This ability is reflected in the Ki values calculated from the [\n125\nI] glucagon binding assay described herein.\n\n\nThe term “humanized” as used in reference to a monoclonal antibody of the invention refers to an antibody with at least human frameworks and constant regions (CL, CH domains (e.g., CH1, CH2, CH3), and hinge), and CDRs derived from glucagon receptor binding antibodies. Human frameworks comprise frameworks that correspond to human germline sequences as well as sequences with somatic mutations. Human frameworks and constant regions may be fully human or may vary from the native sequences by one or more amino acid substitutions, terminal and intermediate additions and deletions, and the like. CDRs may be derived from one or more CDRs that bind to the glucagon specific receptors in this application in the context of any antibody framework. For example, the CDRs of the humanized antibody of the present invention may be derived from CDRs that bind glucagon receptors in the context of a mouse antibody framework and then are engineered to bind glucagon receptors in the context of a human framework.\n\n\nThe term “monoclonal antibody” refers to an antibody that is derived from a single copy or clone, including e.g., any eukaryotic, prokaryotic, or phage clone, and not the method by which it is produced. Preferably a monoclonal antibody of the invention exists in a homogeneous or substantially homogeneous population.\n\n\nThe term “in vivo efficacy” as used herein with respect to an antibody of the invention means the ability of the antibody to impart a positive biological effect in a human or animal model. Preferably in vivo efficacy refers to a glucose normalization effect on an animal showing elevated blood glucose in response to an antibody of the present invention as compared to a control response. A diabetic Zucker diabetic fatty rat (ZDF) model (Horm Metab Res. 2005 February; 37(2):79-83) may be appropriately used to assess in vivo efficacy, wherein in vivo efficacy preferably denotes 100% blood glucose normalization on exposure of the animal to ≦30 mg/kg dosage of humanized antibody according to the present invention. More preferably in vivo efficacy denotes 100% blood glucose normalization on exposure of the animal to a dosage of ≦15 mg/kg of antibody, further preferred at a dosage of ≦10 mg/kg, more preferably 0.1 to 5 mg/kg. In a most preferred embodiment in vivo efficacy is used to denote 100% blood glucose normalization in a diabetic ZDF rat model on exposure of the animal to 1 to 3 mg/kg dosage of humanized antibody according to the present invention.\n\n\nThe term “glucose normalization” refers to mean plasma glucose values in a ZDF rat model of less than 120 mg/dL, preferably in the range of 110 to 120 mg/dL. Plasma glucose may be determined in accordance with Etgen et al., (Metabolism 2000; 49(5): 684-688) or calculated from a conversion of whole blood glucose concentration in accordance with D'Orazio et al., (Clin. Chem. Lab. Med. 2006; 44(12): 1486-1490).\n\n\nAs used herein, “Fab fragment” refers to that portion of an antibody molecule, within the variable region, which contains the amino acid residues of the light and heavy chain CDR and framework sequences in addition to CL and CH1 domain.\n\n\nThe 3 CDRs of the heavy chain are herein referred to as “CDRH1, CDRH2, and CDRH3” and the 3 CDRs of the light chain are referred to as “CDRL1, CDRL2 and CDRL3”. Assignment of amino acids to each domain is in accordance with a well-known convention (Kabat, et al., \nAnn. NY Acad. Sci. \n190:382-93 (1971); Kabat, et al., \nSequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest\n, Fifth Edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH Publication No. 91-3242 (1991)).

In vivo efficacy should be observed at a dosage of 30 mg/kg in a ZDF rat model, preferably at a dosage of less than 15 mg/kg, more preferably less than 5 mg/kg, further preferred with the range 0.1 to 5 mg/kg. Most preferably an antibody in accordance with the present invention achieves 100% glucose normalization in a ZDF rat model at a dosage of about 1 to 3 mg/kg. It has been found that particularly preferred antibodies in accordance with the present invention are able to show 100% glucose normalization in an in vivo ZDF rat model at the low dosage of 3 mg/kg. The present invention therefore preferably comprises a Fab fragment or humanized monoclonal antibody comprising said Fab fragment, wherein said Fab fragment comprises:\n\n\n(i) a light chain with a CDRL1 of SEQ ID NO 3; CDRL2 of SEQ ID NO: 5; CDRL3 of SEQ ID NO: 6; and a heavy chain with a CDRH1 of SEQ ID NO: 12; CDRH2 of SEQ ID NO: 15; CDRH3 of SEQ ID NO: 21;\n\n\n(ii) a light chain with a CDRL1 of SEQ ID NO 3; CDRL2 of SEQ ID NO: 5; CDRL3 of SEQ ID NO: 6; and a heavy chain with a CDRH1 of SEQ ID NO: 12; CDRH2 of SEQ ID NO: 17; CDRH3 of SEQ ID NO: 21;\n\n\n(iii) a light chain with a CDRL1 of SEQ ID NO 3; CDRL2 of SEQ ID NO: 5; CDRL3 of SEQ ID NO: 6; and a heavy chain with a CDRH1 of SEQ ID NO: 12; CDRH2 of SEQ ID NO: 15; CDRH3 of SEQ ID NO: 22; or\n\n\n(iv) a light chain with a CDRL1 of SEQ ID NO 3; CDRL2 of SEQ ID NO: 5; CDRL3 of SEQ ID NO: 6; and a heavy chain with a CDRH1 of SEQ ID NO: 13; CDRH2 of SEQ ID NO: 18; CDRH3 of SEQ ID NO: 22.\n\n\nIn a further preferred embodiment the present invention relates to a Fab fragment or humanized monoclonal antibody comprising said Fab fragment, wherein said Fab fragment comprises a light chain with a CDRL1 of SEQ ID NO 3; CDRL2 of SEQ ID NO: 5; CDRL3 of SEQ ID NO: 6; and a heavy chain with a CDRH1 of SEQ ID NO: 12; CDRH2 of SEQ ID NO: 17; CDRH3 of SEQ ID NO: 21. It has been found that an antibody comprising Fab fragments in accordance with this embodiment has a particularly advantageous property of maintaining in vivo efficacy over an extended period as compared to other similar antibodies within the genus being described.\n\n\nA Fab fragment or humanized monoclonal antibody comprising said Fab fragment of the present invention, preferably comprises light and heavy variable chain framework regions of human origin. Moreover, a variety of different human framework sequences may be used singly or in combination as a basis for the humanized immunoglobulins of the present invention. Preferably, the framework regions of the Fab fragment or humanized monoclonal antibody of the invention are of human origin or substantially of human origin (at least 95%, 97% or 99% of human origin). The sequences of framework regions of human origin may be obtained from ImMunoGenetics (IMGT) via their website http://imgt.cines.fr/textes/IMGTindex/FR.html or from \nThe immunoglobulin Factsbook\n, by Marie-Paule Lefranc, Gerard Lefranc, Academic Press 2001, ISBN 012441351. For example, germline light chain frameworks may be selected from the group consisting of: A11, A17, A18, A19, A20, A27, A30, L1, L1I, L12, L2, L5, L15 L6, L8, O12, O2, and O8 and germline heavy chain framework regions may be selected from the group consisting of: VH2-5, VH2-26, VH2-70, VH3-20, VH3-72, VHI-46, VH3-9, VH3-66, VH3-74, VH4-31, VH I-18, VH I-69, VI-13-7, VH3-11, VH3-15, VH3-21, VH3-23, VH3-30, VH3-48, VH4-39, VH4-59, and VH5-5I.\n\n\nThe specific antibodies disclosed herein can be used as a template or parent antibody to make additional antibodies of the invention. In one approach the parent antibody CDRs are grafted into a human framework that has a high sequence identity with the parent antibody framework. The sequence identity of the new framework will generally be at least 80%, at least 85%, or at least 90% with the corresponding framework in the parent antibody. This grafting may result in a reduction in binding affinity compared to the parent antibody. If this is the case, the framework can be back-mutated to the parent framework at certain positions based on specific criteria published by Queen et al., [Queen, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88, 2869 (1991)]. Further methods that may be used include, for example, Jones et al., Nature, 321:522 (1986); Riechmann et al., Nature, 332:323-327 (1988); Verhoeyen et al., Science, 239:1534 (1988).\n\n\nMost preferably the Fab fragment or humanized monoclonal antibody comprising said Fab fragment according to the present invention comprises the following light chain framework (FR) sequences: FR1 SEQ ID NO: 23; FR2 SEQ ID NO: 24; FR3 SEQ ID NO: 25; FR4 SEQ ID NO: 26; and heavy variable chain frameworks sequences: FR5 SEQ ID NO: 27; FR6 SEQ ID NO: 28; FR7 SEQ ID NO: 29; FR8 SEQ ID NO: 30; wherein these are arranged as light chain variable sequence FR1-CDRL1-FR2-CDRL2-FR3-CDRL3-FR4 and heavy chain variable sequence FR5-CDRH1-FR6-CDRH2-FR7-CDRH3-FR8.\n\n\nThe applicant has surprisingly determined that when predicting the in vivo efficacy of a glucagon receptor antagonism antibody through the use of an in vitro competitive glucagon binding assay, that it is the affinity of the Fab fragment that is positively correlated with in vivo efficacy. Conversely, the binding affinity (Ki) of a full antibody to the glucagon receptor is not necessarily a valid predictor of in vivo efficacy. A process of preparing monoclonal antibodies having the favourable properties sought herein, therefore preferably comprises selecting a Fab fragment that binds to each glucagon receptor with a Ki of less than 50 nM in an in vitro competitive glucagon binding assay using heterologously expressed glucagon receptor gene. More preferably said process comprises selecting a Fab fragment that has an in vitro Ki at each of the glucagon receptors of less than 30 nM, more preferably less than 20 nM, further preferred less than 10 nM. More preferably, the Fab fragment is selected by an in vitro Ki at the rat, murine and cyno receptors of less than 20 nM and in vitro Ki at the human receptor of less than 5 nM. More preferably the Ki of the selected Fab fragment, and in particular at the human glucagon receptor, is from 0.1 nM to 15 nM, most preferably from 1 to 10 nM. Fab fragments identified by this process may then be suitably expressed as full antibodies for therapeutic use by techniques commonly known in the art.\n\n\nIt will be appreciated that applying the teaching of the present invention the person skilled in the art may use common techniques e.g. site directed mutagenesis, to substitute amino acids within the specific CDR and framework sequences herein disclosed and in so doing generate further variable region amino acid sequences derived from the sequences herein provided. Up to all 20 alternative naturally occurring amino acids may be introduced at a specific substitution site. The in vitro selection process defined here above may then be suitably used to screen these additional variable region amino acid sequences for Fab fragments having the claimed cross reactivity and in vitro Ki that has been found by the present applicants to be indicative of in vivo efficacy. In this way further Fab fragments are identified that are suitable for preparing a humanized antibody in accordance with the present invention. Preferably the amino acid substitution within the frameworks is restricted to one, two or three positions within one or each of the framework sequences disclosed herein. Preferably amino acid substitution within the CDRs is restricted to one to three positions within one or each CDR, more preferably substitution at one or two amino acid positions within one or each CDR is performed. Further preferred, amino acid substitution is performed at one or two amino acid positions in the CDRs of the heavy chain variable region. Most preferably amino acid substitution is performed at one or two amino acid positions within CDRH2.\n\n\nA suitable methodology for combining CDR and framework substitutions to prepare alternative antibodies according to the present invention, using an antibody described herein as a parent antibody, is provided in Wu et al., J. Mol. Biol., 294:151-162.\n\n\nAs used herein, the Fc portion of an immunoglobulin refers to the constant region of an antibody from both heavy chains, which associate through non-covalent interactions and disulfide bonds. The Fc portion can include the hinge regions and extend through the CH2 and CH3 domains to the C-terminus of the antibody. The Fc portion can further include one or more glycosylation sites. Monoclonal antibodies of the present invention may have a heavy chain constant region selected from any of the immunoglobulin classes IgA, IgD, IgG, IgM and IgE. Preferably antibodies of the invention contain an Fc portion which is derived from human IgG4 Fc region because of its reduced ability to bind FcγR and complement factors as compared to other IgG sub-types. More preferably, the IgG4 Fc region of an antibody of the present invention contains substitutions that further reduce effector function [Issacs et al., (1996) Clin. Exp. Immunol. 106:427-433]. These may be selected from one or more of the group comprising proline for glutamate at residue 233, alanine or valine for phenylalanine at residue 234 and alanine or glutamate for leucine at residue 235 (EU numbering, Kabat, E. A. et al. (1991) \nSequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, \n5\nth \nEd. U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, Bethesda, Md., NIH Publication no. 91-3242). These residues corresponds to positions 15, 16 and 17 in SEQ ID NO: 52 and positions 235, 236 and 237 of SEQ ID NO: 67. Further, removing the N-linked glycosylation site in the IgG4 Fc region by substituting Ala for Asn at residue 297 (EU numbering) which corresponds to position 79 of SEQ ID NO:52 is another way to ensure that residual effector activity is eliminated in the context of a humanized antibody.\n\n\nIn addition, the IgG4 Fc portion for use with a humanized monoclonal antibody of present invention preferably contains a substitution that stabilizes heavy chain dimer formation and prevents the formation of half-IgG4 Fc chains. This construct consists of serine at position at 228 (EU numbering) being substituted by proline (amino acid residue 10 in SEQ ID NO:52). The C-terminal lysine residue present in the native molecule may also be deleted in the IgG4 derivative Fc portion of the antibodies discussed herein (position 229 of SEQ ID NO:52; deleted lysine referred to as des-K). A most preferred IgG4 Fc portion is provided by amino acids 221 to 448 of SEQ ID NO: 67.\n\n\nThe invention is further directed to an isolated nucleic acid sequence encoding an antibody of the invention; a vector (or vectors) comprising that nucleic acid, optionally operably linked to control sequences recognized by a host cell transformed with the vector; a host cell comprising that vector; a process for producing an antibody or Fab fragment thereof according to the invention comprising culturing the host cell so that the nucleic acid is expressed and, optionally, recovering the antibody from the host cell culture medium.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising the Fab fragment or humanized monoclonal antibody of the invention. The pharmaceutical composition of the invention may further comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In said pharmaceutical composition, the Fab fragment or humanized monoclonal antibody of the invention is the active ingredient. Preferably the pharmaceutical composition comprises a homogeneous or substantially homogeneous population of the Fab fragment or humanized monoclonal antibody of the invention. The composition for therapeutic use is sterile and may be lyophilized, optionally supplied with an appropriate diluent.\n\n\nA further embodiment of the present invention comprises a host cell or cell culture that is a recipient of any isolated polynucleotide of the invention or any recombinant vector(s) comprising a sequence encoding a HCVR, LCVR, monoclonal antibody or Fab fragment of the invention. Host cells include progeny of a single host cell, and the progeny may not necessarily be completely identical (in morphology or in total DNA complement) to the original parent cell due to natural, accidental, or deliberate mutation and/or change. A host cell includes cells transformed, transduced or infected in vivo or in vitro with one or more a recombinant vectors or a polynucleotide expressing a monoclonal antibody of the invention or a light chain or heavy chain thereof. A host cell which comprises a recombinant vector of the invention (either stably incorporated into the host chromosome or not) may also be referred to as a “recombinant host cell”. Preferred host cells for use in the invention are CHO cells, NS0 cells, HeLa, SP2/0 cells or COS cells. Additional host cells for use in the invention include plant cells, yeast cells, other mammalian cells and prokaryotic cells.\n\n\nThe invention embodies an article of manufacture comprising a packaging material and a Fab fragment or humanized monoclonal antibody of the invention contained within said packaging material and wherein the packaging material comprises a package insert which indicates that the Fab fragment or humanized monoclonal antibody neutralizes a GluR or decreases the level of GluR activity in the patient.\n\n\nBiological Assays:\n\n\nGlucagon Receptor (GlucR) Membrane Preparations\n\n\nMembrane preparations for binding studies are prepared from 293HEK cells expressing cloned human, mouse, cynomologous monkey or rat glucagon receptor. Each clonal cell line is first grown as a suspension culture and the frozen cell pellet is resuspended in membrane prep buffer consisting of 25 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mM MgCl\n2\n, Complete\nR \nEDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Science), and 20 U/ml DNase I (Sigma Chemical Company) at 4° C. The cells are homogenized with a motor-driven Teflon-glass Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer using 25 strokes, followed by centrifugation at 1800×g for 15 minutes at 4° C. The supernatant is collected and the pellet resuspended in membrane prep buffer, rehomogenized and centrifuged. The second supernatant is combined with the first supernatant and recentrifuged at 1800×g for 15 mins to clarify. The clarified supernatant is transferred to high speed tubes and centrifuged at 25000×g for 30 minutes at 4° C. The membrane pellet (P2) is resuspended in the membrane prep buffer (without DNAase), aliquoted, quick frozen on dry ice and stored at −80° C. until needed.\n\n\n[\n125\nI]Glucagon Binding by Scintillation Proximity Assay (SPA).\n\n\nA competitive receptor/ligand binding experiment is adapted to a scintillation proximity assay (SPA) format. Incubations are performed in clear bottom, opaque 96-well microplates. Compound is serially diluted 3-fold in binding buffer consisting of 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 2.5 mM CaCl\n2\n, 1 mM MgCl\n2\n, 0.1% fatty acid free BSA, 0.003% tween-20 and Complete\nR \nEDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets. P2 membranes (prepared above) are diluted in binding buffer from each receptor preparation, then added to the diluted compound followed by addition of 0.15 mgs of wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) SPA beads (GE Healthcare) previously blocked with 1% fatty acid free BSA, and 0.15 nM [\n125\nI]-Glucagon (Perkin-Elmer). Plates are sealed with adhesive sealing tape, mixed end over end, and incubated at room temperature for 12 hours. The radioactivity bound to the receptor (in close proximity to the WGA SPA bead) is quantified on a PE Life and Analytical Sciences Trilux Microbeta plate scintillation counter and expressed as counts per minute (CPM). Total binding is determined in the absence of added compound and nonspecific binding is determined by adding 1 uM glucagon (Lilly Research Labs). The final concentration of 1 uM of unlabeled glucagon is capable of completely inhibiting [\n125\nI]-glucagon binding to background levels.\n\n\n[\n125\nI]Glucagon Binding Data Analysis.\n\n\nRaw CPM data for concentration curves of compound are converted to percent inhibition by subtracting nonspecific binding from the individual CPM values and dividing by the total binding signal, also corrected for nonspecific binding. Data is analyzed using four-parameter (curve maximum, curve minimum, IC\n50\n, Hill slope) nonlinear regression routines (XLFit version 3.0: Activity Base, IDBS). The equilibrium dissociation constant determined by competitor inhibited radioligand binding, Ki, is calculated from the absolute IC\n50 \nvalue based upon the equation [Ki=IC\n50\n/(1+D/Kd)] where D equals the concentration of radioligand used in the experiment and Kd equals the equilibrium binding affinity constant of [\n125\nI]glucagon, in the assay for each individual receptor species.\n\n\nGlucagon-Stimulated cAMP Functional Antagonist Assay.\n\n\nThe functional antagonist activity is determined from the dose-dependent inhibition of increases in intracellular cAMP with a sub-maximal dose of glucagon using the same clonal rat, mouse, cynomologous, and human glucagon receptor-293HEK cell lines. Quantitation of the intracellular cAMP level is done with an Amplified Luminescent Proximity Homogeneous Assay, (Alpha Screen) from Perkin Elmer (6760625R). Briefly, cAMP generated within the cell competes for binding of a biotinylated cAMP-streptavidin coated Donor bead and a coated anti-cAMP antibody Acceptor bead. As the cAMP level within the cell increases, a disruption of the Acceptor bead-biotinlyated cAMP—Donor bead complex occurs. The functional assay is performed in 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, with 0.25 mM IBMX in HBSS containing Mg+2 and Ca+2. The clonal glucagon receptor-293HEK cells are suspended at 2500 cells per well and 1 unit/well of biotinylated cAMP from the kit in a total volume of 20 uls. The cells are pre-incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature with 20 uls of either 3-fold serially diluted compounds or of 3-fold serially diluted cAMP for use as a standard curve. The reaction is started by the addition of 20 uls of 300 pM glucagon (3×), a dose sufficient to produce 90% of the maximal intracellular cAMP. After 60 minutes at room temperature in the dark, the reaction is stopped by the addition of 30 uls of lysis buffer made of 1% IGEPAL CA630 (Sigma) and 0.1% fatty-acid free BSA (Gibco) in 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4 containing 1 unit each of the kit Donor and Acceptor beads per well. The plates are wrapped in foil to protect the Donor and Acceptor beads from light and mixed on Titertek shaker medium speed for 30 secs. After incubation overnight at room temperature, the plates are read on a Packard Fusion™-α Instrument.\n\n\nData Analysis for Functional cAMP Activity.\n\n\nThe alpha screen units are converted to pmoles cAMP generated per well based upon the cAMP standard curve. The pmoles cAMP produced in the presence of compound are converted to % of a maximal response with the submaximal dose of glucagon alone. Within each experiment, the concentration of glucagon needed to produce a 50% response in pmoles cAMP is determined. This EC50 concentration is used to normalize results between runs to a Kb where Kb=(EC50 compound)/[1+(pM glucagon used/EC50 in pM for glucagon dose response)]. The data is analyzed using four-parameter (curve maximum, curve minimum, IC\n50\n, Hill slope) nonlinear regression routines (XLFit version 3.0: Activity Base, IDBS).\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nAntibody examples Ab-1, Ab-2, Ab-3, Ab-4, Ab-5, Ab-6 and Ab-7 are made and purified as known in the art. An appropriate host cell, such as HEK 293 EBNA or CHO, is either transiently or stably transfected with an expression system for secreting antibodies using an optimal predetermined light chain to heavy chain vector ratio or a single vector system encoding both a light chain (set out in SEQ ID NOS: 70, 72, 74, 76) and a heavy chain (set out in SEQ ID NOS: 71, 73, 75, 77, 78, 79, 80). Clarified medium into which the antibody has been secreted is purified using any of many commonly-used techniques. For example, the medium may be conveniently applied to a Protein A or G Sepharose FF column that has been equilibrated with a compatible buffer, such as phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4). The column is washed to remove nonspecific binding components. The bound antibody is eluted, for example, by pH gradient (such as 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer pH 6.8 to 0.1 M sodium citrate buffer pH 2.5). Antibody fractions are detected, such as by SDS-PAGE, and then are pooled. Further purification is optional, depending on the intended use. The antibody may be concentrated and/or sterile filtered using common techniques. Soluble aggregate and multimers may be effectively removed by common techniques, including size exclusion, hydrophobic interaction, ion exchange, or hydroxyapatite chromatography. The purity of the antibody after these chromatography steps is greater than 99%. The product may be immediately frozen at −70° C. or may be lyophilized.\n\n\nFab expression is achieved in \nE. coli \nwherein the Fab molecules are secreted into the periplasmic space. The cell wall is disrupted by osmotic shock, and the Fab containing a His tag is purified on an IMAC column.\n\n\nTable 1 sets out the CDR combinations used in the antibody examples according to the present invention. The full antibody light chain combines the light chain framework sequences interspaced by three light chain CDRs; Framework 1 (SEQ ID NO: 23)-CDRL1-Framework 2 (SEQ ID NO: 24)-CDRL2-Framework 3 (SEQ ID NO: 25)-CDRL3-Framework 4 (SEQ ID NO: 26) and the light chain constant region (SEQ ID NO: 53).
