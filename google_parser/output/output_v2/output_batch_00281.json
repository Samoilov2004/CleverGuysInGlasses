Description\n\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\n \n \n \nPre-proglucagon is a 158 amino acid precursor polypeptide that is processed in different tissues to form a number of different proglucagon-derived peptides, including glucagon, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) and oxyntomodulin (OXM), that are involved in a wide variety of physiological functions, including glucose homeostasis, insulin secretion, gastric emptying, and intestinal growth, as well as the regulation of food intake. Glucagon is a 29-amino acid peptide that corresponds to amino acids 33 through 61 of pre-proglucagon, while GLP-1 is produced as a 37-amino acid peptide that corresponds to amino acids 72 through 108 of pre-proglucagon. GLP-1(7-36) amide or GLP-1(7-37)acid are biologically potent forms of GLP-1, that demonstrate essentially equivalent activity at the GLP-1 receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlucagon generally functions as a counter-regulatory hormone, opposing the actions of insulin, to maintain the level of blood glucose, particularly in instances of hypoglycemia. Thus, glucagon's general role in glucose regulation is to counteract the action of insulin and maintain blood glucose levels through enhanced synthesis and mobilization of glucose in the liver. However, in some patients with \nType\n 1 or Type 2 diabetes, absolute or relative elevated glucagon levels have been shown to contribute to the hyperglycemic state. Both in healthy control animals as well as in animal models of \nType\n 1 and Type 2 diabetes, removal of circulating glucagon with selective and specific antibodies has resulted in reduction of the glycemic level (Brand et al., Diabetologia 37, 985 (1994); Diabetes 43, [suppl 1], 172A (1994); Am. J. Physiol. 269, E469-E477 (1995); Diabetes 44 [suppl 1], 134A (1995); Diabetes 45, 1076 (1996)). These studies suggest that glucagon antagonism could be useful in glycemic control of diabetes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlucagon exerts its action by binding to and activating its receptor, which is part of the glucagon-secretin branch of the 7-transmembrane G-protein coupled receptor family. The receptor functions by an activation of the adenylyl cyclase resulting in increased cAMP levels. Previous reports have identified peptide-based, (see Unson, C. G. et al. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 789-94, Ahn, J. et al. (2001) J. Peptide Research 58, 151-8 and Ahn J. et al. (2001) J. Med. Chem. 44, 1372-9) as well as nucleotide-based glucagon antagonists (Sloop K. et al. (2004) J. Clinical Invest. 113, 1571-81). Peptide-based inhibition acts at the level of receptor binding while the latter functions by suppressing intracellular mRNA specific to the glucagon receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInhibitors of the glucagon receptor have been described, and are generally based on the amino acid sequence of glucagon. Several analogues in which one or more amino acids were either deleted or substituted to produce potent antagonists of glucagon receptor have been described, for example, [des His\n1\n] [Glu\n9\n]-glucagon amide (Unson et al., (1989) \nPeptides\n 10, 1171; Post et al., (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90, 1662), des His\n1\n, Phe\n6 \n[Glu\n9\n]-glucagon amide (Azizh et al., (1995) Bioorg. & Med. Chem. Lett. 16, 1849) and Nle\n9\n, Ala\n11,16\n-glucagon amide (Unson et al. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269(17), 12548). Other analogues include substitutions at positions 4 (Ahn J M et al. (2001) J. Pept. Res. 58(2):151-8), 1 (Dharanipragada, R. et al. (1993) Int. J. Pept. Res. 42(1): 68-77) and 4, 5, 12, 17 and 18 in the glucagon sequence (Gysin B et al. 1986. Biochemistry. 25(25):8278-84).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGLP-1 has different biological activities compared to glucagon. Its actions include stimulation of insulin synthesis and secretion, inhibition of glucagon secretion, and inhibition of food intake. GLP-1 has been shown to reduce hyperglycemia (elevated glucose levels) in diabetics. Exendin-4, a peptide from lizard venom that shares about 50% amino acid identity with GLP-1, activates the GLP-1 receptor and likewise has been shown to reduce hyperglycemia in diabetics.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere is also evidence that GLP-1 and exendin-4 may reduce food intake and promote weight loss, an effect that would be beneficial not only for diabetics but also for patients suffering from obesity. Patients with obesity have a higher risk of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular disease, and musculoskeletal diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs described herein, glucagon analogs are provided that exhibit high potency activity, both as glucagon antagonists and as GLP-1 agonists. More particularly, the novel glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonists represent novel chemical modifications of the N-terminus of the native glucagon sequence, and substitutions of the native glucagon sequence that allow for stabilization of the alpha-helix structure in the C-terminal portion of the compound. The novel glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonist compounds can be used in any setting where glucagon antagonism concurrent with GLP-1 agonism is desired. In accordance with one embodiment the compounds can be used in the treatment of diabetes or obesity.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY\n\n\n \n \n \nIn accordance with one embodiment, analogs of glucagon are provided that demonstrate potent, selective glucagon antagonism and selective glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) agonism (glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonists). These two activities have separately been shown to be highly desirable properties for the treatment of the metabolic syndrome, specifically diabetes and obesity. The glucagon antagonist activity is useful in any setting where the suppression of glucagon agonism is desired. The presence of GLP-1 agonism further suppresses the endogenous secretion of glucagon from the pancreas while stimulating insulin synthesis and secretion. The two pharmacological actions serve in a synergistic fashion to normalize metabolic abnormalities. These glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonists can be further modified to improve the solubility and stability of the compounds while maintaining the glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonist activity of the parent compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with one embodiment a glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonist is provided comprising a glucagon peptide that has been modified by the deletion of the first 1 to 5 amino acids residues (e.g., first amino acid, first two amino acids, first three amino acids, first four amino acids, first five amino acids) from the N-terminus, and stabilization of the alpha-helix structure in the C-terminal portion of the compound (around amino acid positions 12-29 according to the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon, SEQ ID NO: 1), e.g., by the linkage of the side chains of amino acid pairs, selected from \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n 12 and 16, 16 and 20, 20 and 24, and 24 and 28 (relative to the native glucagon peptide sequence), to one another through hydrogen-bonding or ionic interactions, such as the formation of salt bridges, or by covalent bonds. Alternatively, stabilization of the alpha-helix around residues 12-29 is achieved through introduction of one or more α,α-disubstituted amino acids at positions that retain the desired activity. In some embodiments, one, two, three, four or more of \n \npositions\n \n 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24 or 29 (according to the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon) of the glucagon peptide or analog thereof is substituted with an α,α-disubstituted amino acid. For example, substitution of position 16 (according to the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon) of a glucagon peptide or analog thereof with amino iso-butyric acid (AIB) provides a stabilized alpha helix in the absence of a salt bridge or lactam. In some embodiments, one, two, three or more of \npositions\n 16, 20, 21 or 24 (according to the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon) are substituted with AIB\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with one embodiment the glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonist represents a further modification of the glucagon peptide wherein in addition to the N-terminal deletion, the phenylalanine at \nposition\n 6 of the native glucagon peptide is modified, e.g., to comprise a hydroxyl group in place of the N-terminus amino group. In a further embodiment the natural carboxylic acid of the C-terminal amino acid is replaced with a charge-neutral group, such as an amide or ester. In another embodiment the aspartic acid residue at position four (position 9 of native glucagon peptide) is substituted with an amino acid selected from the group consisting of glutamic acid, homoglutamic acid, β-homoglutamic acid, a sulfonic acid derivative of cysteine, or an alkylcarboxylate derivative of cysteine having the structure of:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwherein X\n5 \nis C\n1\n-C\n4 \nalkyl, C\n2\n-C\n4 \nalkenyl, or C\n2\n-C\n4 \nalkynyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the sulfonic acid derivative of cysteine is cysteic acid or homocysteic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonist comprises the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 15 or SEQ ID NO: 51, and more particularly, a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 5, SEQ ID NO: 6, SEQ ID NO: 7, SEQ ID NO: 8, SEQ ID NO: 9, SEQ ID NO: 16, SEQ ID NO: 17, SEQ ID NO: 18, SEQ ID NO: 19, SEQ ID NO: 22, SEQ ID NO: 23, SEQ ID NO: 24 and SEQ ID NO: 25.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso provided herein is a peptide or conjugate thereof comprising (1) an intramolecular bridge, or an alpha, alpha-di-substituted amino acid, or an acidic amino acid at position 16 (according to the numbering of SEQ ID NO:1), or a combination thereof, (2) a C-terminal amide or ester in place of a C-terminal carboxylate, and (3) a general structure of A-B-C,\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwherein A is selected from the group consisting of:\n\n \n \n \n \n \n(i) phenyl lactic acid (PLA);\n \n(ii) an oxy derivative of PLA;\n \n(iii) a peptide of 2 to 6 amino acids in which two consecutive amino acids of the peptide are linked via an ester or ether bond;\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nB represents amino acids i to 26 of SEQ ID NO: 1, wherein i is 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7, optionally comprising one or more amino acid modifications, as further described herein, including, for example, any of the modifications described for glucagon peptides or glucagon analogs or glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonists;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nand C is selected from the group consisting of:\n\n \n \n \n \n \n(x) X;\n \n(xi) X—Y;\n \n(xii) X—Y—Z; and\n \n(xiii) X—Y—Z—R10,\n\n\nwherein X is Met, Leu, or Nle; Y is Asn or a charged amino acid; Z is Thr, Gly, Cys, Lys, ornithine (Orn), homocysteine, acetyl phenylalanine (Ac-Phe), or a charged amino acid; wherein R10 is selected from a group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 21, 26, 27, and 50.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the carboxy terminal amino acid of the glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonist described herein is covalently bound to a second peptide comprising a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 21, 26, 27, and 50. For example, in one embodiment, the glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonist of SEQ ID NO: 15, SEQ ID NO: 51, SEQ ID NO: 5, SEQ ID NO: 6, SEQ ID NO: 7, SEQ ID NO: 8, SEQ ID NO: 12, SEQ ID NO: 13, SEQ ID NO: 14, SEQ ID NO: 16, SEQ ID NO: 17, SEQ ID NO: 18, SEQ ID NO: 19, SEQ ID NO: 22, SEQ ID NO: 23, SEQ ID NO: 24 and SEQ ID NO: 25 is covalently bound to a second peptide comprising a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 21 (GPSSGAPPPS), SEQ ID NO: 26 (KRNRNNIA), SEQ ID NO: 27 (KRNR) and SEQ ID NO: 50 (GPSSGAPPPSX).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet further exemplary embodiments, any of the foregoing compounds can be further modified to improve stability by modifying the amino acid corresponding to position 15 or 16 of native glucagon, to reduce degradation of the peptide over time, especially in acidic or alkaline buffers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConjugates of glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonists are also provided, in which the glucagon peptide is linked, optionally via covalent bonding and optionally via a linker, to a conjugate moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the solubility of the glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonist is enhanced by the covalent linkage of a hydrophilic moiety to the peptide. In one embodiment the hydrophilic moiety is a polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain. In accordance with one embodiment a glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonist is provided, wherein the hydrophilic moiety is covalently bound to an amino acid residue corresponding to position 16, 21 or 24 of native glucagon. In one embodiment the glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonist comprises the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 12, SEQ ID NO: 13 or SEQ ID NO: 14 wherein a polyethylene glycol chain is covalently linked to the amino acid at position 16 of SEQ ID NO: 13, at position 19 of SEQ ID NO: 14 or at positions 16 and 19 of SEQ ID NO: 12. In one embodiment the polyethylene glycol chain has a molecular weight selected from the range of about 1,000 to about 5,000 Daltons. In another embodiment the polyethylene glycol chain has a molecular weight of at least about 20,000 Daltons. Alternatively the glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonist comprises the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 12 and has a polyethylene glycol chain covalently bound to both amino acid positions 16 and 19 of SEQ ID NO: 12, wherein the combined molecular weight of the two polyethylene chains is either about 1,000 to about 5,000 Daltons or is greater than about 20,000 Daltons.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the solubility of any of the preceding glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonist can be improved by modifying the peptide by substitutions and/or additions that introduce a charged amino acid into the C-terminal portion of the peptide, preferably at a position C-terminal to the amino acid corresponding to position 27 of native glucagon (i.e., C-terminal to position 22 of the glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonist). Optionally, one, two or three charged amino acids may be introduced within the C-terminal portion, preferably C-terminal to position 22 of the glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonist. In accordance with one embodiment the native amino acid(s) at positions 23 and/or 24 of the glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonist are substituted with a charged amino acid, and/or in a further embodiment one to three charged amino acids are also added to the C-terminus of the peptide. In exemplary embodiments, one, two or all of the charged amino acids are negatively charged.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment, the glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonist has been modified by truncation or deletion of one or two amino acids of the C-terminus of the glucagon peptide (i.e., position 29 and/or positions 28 and 29 of the native glucagon peptide).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonist is modified to comprise one or more amino acids of native GLP-1 by substitution of the native glucagon residue(s) at corresponding amino acid positions. For example, the glucagon antagonist may comprise one or more amino acid substitutions at any of \npositions\n 2, 3, 17, 18, 21, 23, and 24 (according to the amino acid numbering of native glucagon). In a specific embodiment, the glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 peptide is modified by one or more of the following amino acid substitutions: Ser2 is replaced with Ala, Gln3 is replaced with Glu, Arg17 is replaced with Gln, Arg at position 18 is replaced with Ala, Asp at position 21 is replaced with Glu, Val at position 23 is replaced with Ile, and Gln at \nposition\n 24 is replaced with Ala (amino acid positions are in accordance with the native glucagon sequence).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional modifications, e.g. conservative substitutions, may be made to the glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonists that still allow it to retain its activity at the glucagon and GLP-1 receptors. Thus, the invention contemplates that any of the glucagon analogs disclosed herein can be further modified to comprise up to 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9 further amino acid modifications, and still retain the desired level of activity of a glucagon antagonist and GLP-1 agonist at the glucagon and GLP-1 receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny of the modifications described above can be applied individually or in combination.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutically acceptable salts of the glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonist are also encompassed by the present disclosure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDimers of the glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonists disclosed herein are also encompassed by the present disclosure.

In one embodiment the pharmaceutical compositions comprise solutions that are sterilized and contained within various packages. The pharmaceutical compositions can be further packaged as part of a kit that includes a disposable device for administering the composition to a patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with one embodiment a method of rapidly treating hyperglycemia using a pre-formulated aqueous composition is provided. The method comprises the step of administering an effective amount of an aqueous solution comprising a novel modified glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonist of the present disclosure. In one embodiment the glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonist is pegylated and the PEG chain has a molecular weight of about 500 to about 5,000 Daltons. In one embodiment the modified glucagon solution is prepackaged in a device that is used to administer the composition to the patient suffering from hyperglycemia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with one embodiment an improved method of regulating blood glucose levels in insulin dependent patients is provided. The method comprises the steps of administering insulin in an amount therapeutically effective for the control of diabetes and administering a novel modified glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonist of the present disclosure, wherein said administering steps are conducted within twelve hours of each other. In one embodiment the glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonist and the insulin are co-administered as a single composition, wherein the glucagon analog is pegylated with a PEG chain having a molecular weight selected from the range of about 5,000 to about 40,000 Daltons. Such methods for treating hyperglycemia are expected to be useful for a variety of types of hyperglycemia, including diabetes, diabetes mellitus type I, diabetes mellitus type II, or gestational diabetes, either insulin-dependent or non-insulin-dependent, and reducing complications of diabetes including nephropathy, retinopathy and vascular disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition it has been reported that stimulation of GLP-1 will induce weight loss or prevent weight gain. Accordingly, it is believed that the glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonists disclosed herein will be effective in inducing weight loss or preventing weight gain. Furthermore, another compound that induces weight loss is oxyntomodulin, a naturally occurring digestive hormone found in the small intestine (see Diabetes 2005; 54:2390-2395). Oxyntomodulin is a 37 amino acid peptide that contains the 29 amino acid sequence of glucagon (i.e. SEQ ID NO: 1) followed by an 8 amino acid carboxy terminal extension of SEQ ID NO: 26 (KRNRNNIA). While it is contemplated that the peptides or glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonists described herein may optionally be joined to this 8 amino acid carboxy terminal extension (SEQ ID NO: 26), the invention specifically contemplates analogs lacking the 8 contiguous amino acids of SEQ ID NO: 26. Such methods for reducing appetite or promoting loss of body weight are expected to be useful in reducing body weight, preventing weight gain, or treating obesity of various causes, including drug-induced obesity, and reducing complications associated with obesity including vascular disease (coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, ischemia reperfusion, etc.), hypertension, onset of diabetes type II, hyperlipidemia and musculoskeletal diseases.\n\n\n \n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFIG. 1\n is a bar graph representing the stability of Glucagon Cys\n21\n-maleimidoPEG\n5K \nat 37° C. incubated for 24, 48, 72, 96, 144 and 166 hours, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 2\n represents data generated from HPLC analysis of Glucagon Cys\n21\n-maleimidoPEG\n5K \nat \npH\n 5 incubated at 37° C. for 24, 72 or 144 hours, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIGS. 3A & 3B\n represents data generated measuring glucagon receptor antagonism of the listed glucagon analogs, as measure by cAMP production.

The term also encompasses any of the agents approved by a regulatory agency of the US Federal government or listed in the US Pharmacopeia for use in animals, including humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein the term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” refers to salts of compounds that retain the biological activity of the parent compound, and which are not biologically or otherwise undesirable. Many of the compounds disclosed herein are capable of forming acid and/or base salts by virtue of the presence of amino and/or carboxyl groups or groups similar thereto.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts can be prepared from inorganic and organic bases. Salts derived from inorganic bases, include by way of example only, sodium, potassium, lithium, ammonium, calcium and magnesium salts. Salts derived from organic bases include, but are not limited to, salts of primary, secondary and tertiary amines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts may be prepared from inorganic and organic acids. Salts derived from inorganic acids include hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like. Salts derived from organic acids include acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, malic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluene-sulfonic acid, salicylic acid, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “treating” includes prophylaxis of the specific disorder or condition, or alleviation of the symptoms associated with a specific disorder or condition and/or preventing or eliminating said symptoms. For example, as used herein the term “treating diabetes” will refer in general to maintaining glucose blood levels near normal levels and may include increasing or decreasing blood glucose levels depending on a given situation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein an “effective” amount or a “therapeutically effective amount” of a glucagon antagonist refers to a nontoxic but sufficient amount of the peptide to provide the desired effect. For example one desired effect would be the prevention or treatment of hyperglycemia. The amount that is “effective” will vary from subject to subject, depending on the age and general condition of the individual, mode of administration, and the like. Thus, it is not always possible to specify an exact “effective amount.” However, an appropriate “effective” amount in any individual case may be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using routine experimentation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term, “parenteral” means not through the alimentary canal but by some other route such as subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraspinal, or intravenous.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein the term “native glucagon” refers to a peptide consisting of the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, and the term “native GLP-1” is a generic term that designates GLP-1(7-36)amide (consisting of the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4), GLP-1(7-37)acid (consisting of the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3) or a mixture of those two compounds. As used herein, a general reference to “glucagon” or “GLP-1” in the absence of any further designation is intended to mean native glucagon or native GLP-1, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “glucagon analog” as used herein includes any peptide comprising, either the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, or any derivative of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, including amino acid substitutions, or post translational modifications (e.g. methylation, acylation, ubiquitination and the like) of the peptide, that stimulates glucagon or GLP receptor activity, as measured by cAMP production using the assay described in Example 13.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “glucagon antagonist” refers to a compound that counteracts glucagon activity or prevents glucagon function as measured by cAMP production using a validated in vitro model assay, such as that described in Example 13. For example, a glucagon antagonist exhibits at least 50% inhibition (e.g., at least 60%, at least 70% inhibition) and preferably, at least 80% inhibition, of the maximum response achieved by glucagon at the glucagon receptor. In one embodiment, the glucagon antagonist exhibits at least 90% inhibition of the maximum response achieved by glucagon at the glucagon receptor. In a specific embodiment, the glucagon antagonist exhibits 100% inhibition of the maximum response achieved by glucagon at the glucagon receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “GLP-1 agonist” refers to a compound that stimulates GLP receptor activity, as measured by cAMP production using a validated in vitro model assay, such as that described in Example 13. A GLP-1 agonist accordingly exhibits GLP-1 agonist activity. The term “GLP-1 agonist activity” refers to maximal activity at the GLP-1 receptor of at least about 10% to about 200% or higher (including at least about 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 75%, 100%, 125%, 150%, or 175%) relative to native GLP-1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein a “glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonist” is a peptide that shares greater than about 65% amino acid sequence identity with the amino acid sequence of native glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 1), but has been modified to exhibit both glucagon antagonist activity as well as GLP-1 agonist activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the peptides described herein exhibit an IC50 at the glucagon receptor that is within a range that is about 100-fold higher or about 100-fold lower than the EC50 at the GLP-1 receptor. For example, a peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 can be modified such that the peptide exhibits at least about 50% (e.g., at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, about 100%) of the maximum agonism achieved by native GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor and at least about 50% (e.g., at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, about 100%) inhibition of the maximum response achieved by native glucagon at the glucagon receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one example, a glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonist comprises the glucagon analog of SEQ ID NO: 2 that has been modified to have a glutamic acid substitution at position 11 of SEQ ID NO: 2 or an intramolecular bridge, e.g. a lactam bridge, formed between amino acid residues pairs selected from the group consisting of 7 and 11, 11 and 15, 15 and 19, and 19 and 23 of SEQ ID NO: 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThroughout the application, all references to a particular amino acid position by number, absent any further designation or reference to a specific SEQ ID NO: refer to the amino acid position of native glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 1); numbered consecutively starting with the first amino acid of SEQ ID NO: 1 being \nposition number\n 1, or the corresponding amino acid position in any analogs thereof. However, when a particular amino acid position is designated by number while referring to a specific SEQ ID NO: the designated amino acid position is based on consecutive numbering, starting with the first amino acid, of the referenced SEQ ID NO: For example, the amino acid at \nposition\n 4 of SEQ ID NO: 2 is aspartic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein an amino acid “modification” refers to a substitution, addition or deletion of an amino acid, and includes substitution with or addition of any of the 20 amino acids commonly found in human proteins, as well as atypical or non-naturally occurring amino acids. Commercial sources of atypical amino acids include Sigma-Aldrich (Milwaukee, Wis.), ChemPep Inc. (Miami, Fla.), and Genzyme Pharmaceuticals (Cambridge, Mass.). Atypical amino acids may be purchased from commercial suppliers, synthesized de novo, or chemically modified or derivatized from naturally occurring amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein an amino acid “substitution” refers to the replacement of one amino acid residue by a different amino acid residue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “conservative amino acid substitution” is defined herein as exchanges within one of the following five groups:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nI. Small aliphatic, nonpolar or slightly polar residues:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAla, Ser, Thr, Pro, Gly;\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nII.

Large, aromatic residues:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nPhe, Tyr, Trp, acetyl phenylalanine\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nAs used herein the general term “polyethylene glycol chain” or “PEG chain”, refers to mixtures of condensation polymers of ethylene oxide and water, in a branched or straight chain, represented by the general formula H(OCH\n2\nCH\n2\n)\nn\nOH, wherein n is at least 9. Absent any further characterization, the term is intended to include polymers of ethylene glycol with an average total molecular weight selected from the range of 500 to 40,000 Daltons. “polyethylene glycol chain” or “PEG chain” is used in combination with a numeric suffix to indicate the approximate average molecular weight thereof. For example, PEG-5,000 refers to polyethylene glycol chain having a total molecular weight average of about 5,000.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein the term “pegylated” and like terms refers to a compound that has been modified from its native state by linking a polyethylene glycol chain to the compound. A “pegylated glucagon analog” is a glucagon analog that has a PEG chain covalently bound to the glucagon analog.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein a general reference to a peptide is intended to encompass peptides that have modified amino and carboxy termini. For example, an amino acid chain comprising an amide group in place of the terminal carboxylic acid is intended to be encompassed by an amino acid sequence designating the standard amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein a “linker” is a bond, molecule or group of molecules that binds two separate entities to one another. Linkers may provide for optimal spacing of the two entities or may further supply a labile linkage that allows the two entities to be separated from each other.

The term dimer, when used absent any qualifying language, encompasses both homodimers and heterodimers. A homodimer comprises two identical subunits, whereas a heterodimer comprises two subunits that differ, although the two subunits are substantially similar to one another.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein a “sulfonic acid derivative of cysteine” refers to compounds of the general structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein X\n6 \nis C\n1\n-C\n4 \nalkyl, C\n2\n-C\n4 \nalkene or C\n2\n-C\n4 \nalkynyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “C\n1\n-C\nn \nalkyl” wherein n can be from 1 through 6, as used herein, represents a branched or linear alkyl group having from one to the specified number of carbon atoms. Typical C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl groups include, but are not limited to, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl, butyl, iso-butyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, pentyl, hexyl and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “C\n2\n-C\nn \nalkenyl” wherein n can be from 2 through 6, as used herein, represents an olefinically unsaturated branched or linear group having from 2 to the specified number of carbon atoms and at least one double bond. Examples of such groups include, but are not limited to, 1-propenyl, 2-propenyl (—CH\n2\n—CH═CH\n2\n), 1,3-butadienyl, (—CH═CHCH═CH\n2\n), 1-butenyl (—CH═CHCH\n2\nCH\n3\n), hexenyl, pentenyl, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “C\n2\n-C\nn \nalkynyl” wherein n can be from 2 to 6, refers to an unsaturated branched or linear group having from 2 to n carbon atoms and at least one triple bond.

For example negatively charged amino acids include aspartic acid, glutamic acid, cysteic acid, homocysteic acid, and homoglutamic acid, whereas positively charged amino acids include arginine, lysine and histidine. Charged amino acids include the charged amino acids among the 20 amino acids commonly found in human proteins, as well as atypical or non-naturally occurring amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein the term “acidic amino acid” refers to an amino acid that comprises a second acidic moiety, including for example, a carboxylic acid or sulfonic acid group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein the term “patient” without further designation is intended to encompass any warm blooded vertebrate domesticated animal (including for example, but not limited to livestock, horses, cats, dogs and other pets) and humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “about” as used herein means greater or lesser than the value or range of values stated by 10 percent, but is not intended to designate any value or range of values to only this broader definition. Each value or range of values preceded by the term “about” is also intended to encompass the embodiment of the stated absolute value or range of values.\n\n\n \nEMBODIMENTS\n\n\n \n \n \nDisclosed herein are glucagon analogs that function as glucagon antagonists and GLP-1 agonists. Such glucagon antagonists/GLP-1 agonists are utilized in any setting where the suppression of glucagon agonism is desired while simultaneous stimulation of GLP-1 activity is also desired.

The two liberated cleavage peptides 1-15 and 16-29 are devoid of glucagon-like biological activity and thus represent a limitation on the aqueous pre-formulation of glucagon and its related analogs. The selective chemical substitution of the Asp at position 15 of native glucagon with Glu has been observed to virtually eliminate chemical cleavage of the 15-16 peptide bond.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, it is expected that the glucagon antagonists/GLP-1 agonists disclosed herein can be similarly modified to decrease their susceptibility to premature chemical cleavage in aqueous buffers. In accordance with one embodiment the glucagon antagonists/GLP-1 agonists described herein can be further modified to enhance their stability in aqueous solutions by replacing the native aspartic amino acid, located at corresponding position 15 of native glucagon, with an amino acid selected from the group consisting of cysteic acid, glutamic acid, homoglutamic acid and homocysteic acid. In accordance with one embodiment the aspartic acid residue at \nposition\n 10 of the glucagon antagonists/GLP-1 agonist of SEQ ID NO: 5, SEQ ID NO: 6, SEQ ID NO: 7 or SEQ ID NO: 8 can be substituted with an amino acid selected from the group consisting of cysteic acid, glutamic acid, homoglutamic acid and homocysteic acid, and in one embodiment the native aspartic acid at \nposition\n 10 of SEQ ID NO: 5, SEQ ID NO: 6, SEQ ID NO: 7 or SEQ ID NO: 8 is replaced with glutamic acid. In accordance with one embodiment a glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonist having improved stability in aqueous solutions is provided wherein the antagonist comprises a modified sequence of SEQ ID NO: 9, wherein the modification comprises substitution of the Asp at \nposition\n 10 of SEQ ID NO: 9 with Glu. In one embodiment a glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonist is provided comprising a sequence selected form the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 22, SEQ ID NO: 23, SEQ ID NO: 24 and SEQ ID NO: 25. In one embodiment the glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonist is amidated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with one embodiment, increased stability by way of reduced degradation of the glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonist described herein may also be achieved by substitution of the serine at position 16 (according to the numbering of native glucagon) with glutamic acid, cysteic acid, homo-glutamic acid, or homo-cysteic acid. In a specific embodiment, the serine at position 16 (according to the native glucagon sequence numbering) is replaced with glutamic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nApplicants have also discovered that native glucagon can be modified by introducing charge at its carboxy terminus to enhance the solubility of the peptide while retaining the agonist properties of the peptide. The enhanced solubility allows for the preparation and storage of glucagon solutions at near neutral pH. Formulating glucagon solutions at relatively neutral pHs (e.g. pH of about 6.0 to about 8.0) improves the long term stability of the glucagon analogs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nApplicants anticipate that the glucagon antagonists/GLP-1 agonists disclosed herein can be similarly modified to enhance their solubility in aqueous solutions at relatively neutral pH (e.g. pH of about 6.0 to about 8.0) while retaining the glucagon antagonist and GLP-1 activities of the parent protein. Accordingly, one embodiment is directed to a glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 of SEQ ID NO: 5, SEQ ID NO: 6, SEQ ID NO: 7 or SEQ ID NO: 8 that has been further modified relative to the native amino acids present at positions 6-29 of the wild type glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 1) to add charge to the peptide by the substitution of native non-charged amino acids with charged amino acids, or the addition of charged amino acids to the carboxy terminus. In accordance with one embodiment, one to three of the non-charged native amino acids of the glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonists disclosed herein are replaced with a charged amino acid. In one embodiment the charged amino acid is selected from the group consisting of lysine, arginine, histidine, aspartic acid and glutamic acid. More particularly, applicants have discovered that substituting the normally occurring amino acid corresponding to position 28 and/or 29 (relative to native glucagon) with charged amino acids, and/or the addition of one to two charged amino acids at the carboxy terminus of the peptide, enhances the solubility and stability of the glucagon analog in aqueous solutions at physiologically relevant pHs (i.e., a pH of about 6.5 to about 7.5). Accordingly such modifications of the glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonists disclosed herein are anticipated to have a similar effect on the solubility in aqueous solutions, particularly at a pH ranging from about 5.5 to about 8.0, while retaining the parent peptide's biological activity\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with one embodiment the glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonist of SEQ ID NO: 5, SEQ ID NO: 6, SEQ ID NO: 7 or SEQ ID NO: 8 is modified by the substitution of the native amino acid at position 23 and/or 24 of those sequences with a negatively charged amino acid (e.g., aspartic acid or glutamic acid) and optionally the addition of a negatively charged amino acid (e.g., aspartic acid or glutamic acid) to the carboxy terminus of the peptide. In an alternative embodiment the glucagon antagonis/GLP-1 agonist of SEQ ID NO: 5, SEQ ID NO: 6, SEQ ID NO: 7 or SEQ ID NO: 8 is modified by the substitution of the native amino acid at \nposition\n 24 of SEQ ID NO: 5, SEQ ID NO: 6, SEQ ID NO: 7 or SEQ ID NO: 8 with a positively charged amino acid (e.g., lysine, arginine or histidine) and optionally the addition of one or two positively charged amino acid (e.g., lysine, arginine or histidine) on the carboxy terminus of the peptide. In accordance with one embodiment a glucagon analog having improved solubility and stability is provided wherein the analog comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 15 or SEQ ID NO: 51 with the proviso that at least one amino acids at position, 23, or 24 of SEQ ID NO: 15 or SEQ ID NO: 51 is substituted with an acidic amino acid and/or an additional acidic amino acid added at the carboxy terminus of SEQ ID NO: 15 or SEQ ID NO: 51. In one embodiment the acidic amino acids are independently selected from the group consisting of Asp, Glu, cysteic acid and homocysteic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with one embodiment a glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonist having improved solubility and stability is provided wherein the antagonist comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 16, SEQ ID NO: 17, SEQ ID NO: 18 or SEQ ID NO: 19.

In one embodiment a glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonist is provided comprising the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 15 or SEQ ID NO: 51 wherein \nposition\n 4 of SEQ ID NO: 15 is aspartic acid and \nposition\n 10 of SEQ ID NO: 15 is glutamic acid. In a further embodiment the C-terminal amino acid of SEQ ID NO: 15 or SEQ ID NO: 51 is modified to replace the native carboxylic acid group with a charge-neutral group, such as an amide or ester.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present disclosure also encompasses glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonist fusion peptides wherein a second peptide has been fused to the c-terminus of the glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonist. More particularly, the fusion peptide may comprise a glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonist peptide of SEQ ID NO: 15 or SEQ ID NO: 51 that further comprises an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 21 (GPSSGAPPPS), SEQ ID NO: 50 (GPSSGAPPPSX), SEQ ID NO: 26 (KRNRNNIA) and SEQ ID NO: 27 (KRNR) linked to \namino acid\n 24 of the glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonist.

In a further embodiment the C-terminus is modified to replace the carboxylic acid group with an amide group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the glucagon antagonists/GLP-1 agonist is further modified by truncation or deletion of one or two amino acids of the C-terminus of the glucagon peptide (i.e., truncation of the amino acid at position 29 or at positions 28 and 29 of native glucagon) without affecting activity and/or potency at the glucagon and GLP-1 receptors. In this regard, the glucagon antagonist described herein can consist essentially of or consist of amino acids 1-27, 1-28, 2-27, 2-28, 3-27, 3-28, 4-27, 4-28, 5-27, 5-28, 6-27, or 6-28 of the native glucagon peptide (SEQ ID NO: 1) with one or more modifications resulting in glucagon antagonistic activity as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonist is further modified to comprise one or more amino acids of native GLP-1 by substitution of the native glucagon residue(s) at corresponding amino acid positions.

Accordingly, the glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonist can comprise the amino acid sequence of any of SEQ ID NOs: 60-70, 73-78, 80-88, 90-96, 103, 104, 106, and 114-118, or comprising the amino acid sequence of any of Peptides 2-6 of Table 13, Peptides 1-8 of Table 14, and Peptides 2-6, 8, and 9 of Table 15.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a specific embodiment, the above-described glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonist comprising PLA is modified to comprise an oxy derivative of PLA, such as, for instance, an ester of PLA or an ether of PLA. For example, the glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonist can comprise the amino acid sequence of any of SEQ ID NOs: 2, 5-20, 22-25, 32-36, 38, 39, 45, 46, and 51, wherein the PLA is linked via an ester or ether bond to an amino acid, peptide, polymer, acyl group, or alkyl group. The amino acid, peptide, polymer, acyl group, or alkyl group may be any of those described herein.

As used herein “oxy derivative of PLA” refers to a compound comprising a modified structure of PLA in which the hydroxyl group has been replaced with O—R\n11\n, wherein R\n11 \nis a chemical moiety. In this regard, the oxy derivative of PLA can be, for example, an ester of PLA or an ether of PLA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods of making oxy derivatives of PLA are known in the art. For example, when the oxy derivative is an ester of PLA, the ester may be formed by upon reaction of the hydroxyl of PLA with a carbonyl bearing a nucleophile. The nucleophile can be any suitable nucleophile, including, but not limited to an amine or hydroxyl. Accordingly, the ester of PLA can comprise the structure of Formula IV:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwherein R7 is an ester formed upon reaction of the hydroxyl of PLA with a carbonyl bearing a nucleophile.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe carbonyl bearing a nucleophile (which reacts with the hydroxyl of PLA to form an ester) can be, for example, a carboxylic acid, a carboxylic acid derivative, or an activated ester of a carboxylic acid. The carboxylic acid derivative can be, but is not limited to, an acyl chloride, an acid anhydride, an amide, an ester, or a nitrile. The activated ester of a carboxylic acid can be, for example, N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), tosylate (Tos), a carbodiimide, or a hexafluorophosphate. In some embodiments, the carbodiimide is 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), 1,1′-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI), 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC), or 1,3-diisopropylcarbodiimide (DICD). In some embodiments, the hexafluorophosphate is selected from a group consisting of hexafluorophosphate benzotriazol-1-yl-oxy-tris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP), benzotriazol-1-yl-oxytripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBOP), 2-(1H-7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyl uronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU), and o-benzotriazole-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-uronium-hexafluoro-phosphate (HBTU).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods of making ethers from reaction with a hydroxyl group (e.g., the hydroxyl of PLA) also are known in the art. For example, the hydroxyl group of PLA may be reacted with a halogenated alkyl or tosylated alkyl alcohol to form an ether bond.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, the chemical moiety of R\n11 \nis one which does not decrease the activity of the peptide. In some embodiments, the chemical moiety enhances the activity, stability, and/or solubility of the peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a specific embodiment, the chemical moiety bound to PLA via an oxygen-containing bond (e.g., via an ester or ether bond) is a polymer (e.g., a polyalkylene glycol), a carbohydrate, an amino acid, a peptide, or a lipid, e.g., a fatty acid or a steroid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a specific embodiment, the chemical moiety is an amino acid, which, optionally, is a part of a peptide, such that Formula IV is a depsipeptide. In this regard, PLA may be at a position other than the N-terminal amino acid residue of the peptide, such that the peptide comprises one or more (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or more) amino acids N-terminal to the PLA residue. For example, the peptide can comprise PLA at position n, wherein n is 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 of the peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino acids N-terminal to the PLA residue may be synthetic or naturally-occurring. In a specific embodiment, the amino acids which are N-terminal PLA are naturally-occurring amino acids. In one embodiment, the amino acids which are N-terminal to PLA are the N-terminal amino acids of native glucagon. For example, the peptide can comprise at the N-terminus the amino acid sequence of any of SEQ ID NOs: 52-56, wherein PLA is linked to threonine via an ester bond:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 52\n\n\nHis-Ser-Gln-Gly-Thr-PLA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 53\n\n\nSer-Gln-Gly-Thr-PLA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 54\n\n\nGln-Gly-Thr-PLA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 55\n\n\nGly-Thr-PLA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 56\n\n\nThr-PLA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an alternative embodiment, one or more of the N-terminal amino acids may be substituted with an amino acid other than the amino acid of native glucagon. For example, when the peptide comprises PLA as the amino acid at \n \nposition\n \n 5 or 6, the amino acid at \nposition\n 1 and/or position 2 may be an amino acid which reduces susceptibility to cleavage by dipeptidyl peptidase IV. More particularly, in some embodiments, \nposition\n 1 of the peptide is an amino acid selected from the group consisting of D-histidine, alpha, alpha-dimethyl imidiazole acetic acid (DMIA), N-methyl histidine, alpha-methyl histidine, imidazole acetic acid, desaminohistidine, hydroxyl-histidine, acetyl-histidine and homo-histidine. More particularly, in some embodiments, position 2 of the antagonist/agonist peptide is an amino acid selected from the group consisting of D-serine, D-alanine, valine, glycine, N-methyl serine, N-methyl alanine, and aminoisobutyric acid (AIB). Also, for example, when the peptide comprises PLA as the amino acid at \n \n \nposition\n \n \n 4, 5, or 6, the amino acid at \nposition\n 3 of the peptide may be glutamic acid, as opposed to the native glutamine residue of native glucagon. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the peptide comprises at the N-terminus the amino acid sequence of any of SEQ ID NOs: 57-59.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWith respect to the peptides comprising a compound of Formula IV, the polymer may be any polymer, provided that it can react with the hydroxyl group of PLA. The polymer may be one that naturally or normally comprises a carbonyl bearing a nucleophile. Alternatively, the polymer may be one which was derivatized to comprise the carbonyl bearing the carbonyl. The polymer may be a derivatized polymer of any of: polyamides, polycarbonates, polyalkylenes and derivatives thereof including, polyalkylene glycols, polyalkylene oxides, polyalkylene terepthalates, polymers of acrylic and methacrylic esters, including poly(methyl methacrylate), poly(ethyl methacrylate), poly(butylmethacrylate), poly(isobutyl methacrylate), poly(hexylmethacrylate), poly(isodecyl methacrylate), poly(lauryl methacrylate), poly(phenyl methacrylate), poly(methyl acrylate), poly(isopropyl acrylate), poly(isobutyl acrylate), and poly(octadecyl acrylate), polyvinyl polymers including polyvinyl alcohols, polyvinyl ethers, polyvinyl esters, polyvinyl halides, poly(vinyl acetate), and polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyglycolides, polysiloxanes, polyurethanes and co-polymers thereof, celluloses including alkyl cellulose, hydroxyalkyl celluloses, cellulose ethers, cellulose esters, nitro celluloses, methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxy-propyl methyl cellulose, hydroxybutyl methyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, cellulose propionate, cellulose acetate butyrate, cellulose acetate phthalate, carboxylethyl cellulose, cellulose triacetate, and cellulose sulphate sodium salt, polypropylene, polyethylenes including poly(ethylene glycol), poly(ethylene oxide), and poly(ethylene terephthalate), and polystyrene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe polymer can be a biodegradable polymer, including a synthetic biodegradable polymer (e.g., polymers of lactic acid and glycolic acid, polyanhydrides, poly(ortho)esters, polyurethanes, poly(butic acid), poly(valeric acid), and poly(lactide-cocaprolactone)), and a natural biodegradable polymer (e.g., alginate and other polysaccharides including dextran and cellulose, collagen, chemical derivatives thereof (substitutions, additions of chemical groups, for example, alkyl, alkylene, hydroxylations, oxidations, and other modifications routinely made by those skilled in the art), albumin and other hydrophilic proteins (e.g., zein and other prolamines and hydrophobic proteins)), as well as any copolymer or mixture thereof. In general, these materials degrade either by enzymatic hydrolysis or exposure to water in vivo, by surface or bulk erosion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe polymer can be a bioadhesive polymer, such as a bioerodible hydrogel described by H.

However, increasing the length of the PEG chain, or attaching multiple PEG chains to the peptide, such that the total molecular weight of the linked PEG is greater than 5,000 Daltons, begins to delay the time action of the modified glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonist or peptide.

In accordance with one embodiment the device of the kit is an aerosol dispensing device, wherein the composition is prepackaged within the aerosol device. In another embodiment the kit comprises a syringe and a needle, and in one embodiment the glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonist composition is prepackaged within the syringe.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following applies to the peptides and glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonists disclosed herein.\n\n\n \nStabilization of the Alpha Helix Structure\n\n\n \n \n \nStabilization of the alpha-helix structure in the C-terminal portion of the glucagon peptide (around amino acids 12-29, according to the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon, SEQ ID NO: 1) can be carried out by, e.g., formation of a covalent or non-covalent intramolecular bridge, or substitution and/or insertion of amino acids around positions 12-29 (according to the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon) with an alpha helix-stabilizing amino acid (e.g., an α,α-disubstituted amino acid).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, an intramolecular bridge is formed between two amino acid side chains to stabilize the three dimensional structure of the carboxy terminal portion (e.g., amino acids 12-29 according to the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon) of the glucagon peptide. The two amino acid side chains can be linked to one another through hydrogen-bonding, ionic interactions, such as the formation of salt bridges, or by covalent bonds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the intramolecular bridge is formed between two amino acids that are 3 amino acids apart, e.g., amino acids at positions i and i+4, wherein i is any integer between 12 and 25 (e.g., 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25) according to the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon. More particularly, the side chains of the amino acid pairs 12 and 16, 16 and 20, 20 and 24 or 24 and 28 (amino acid pairs in which i=12, 16, 20, or 24) according to the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon are linked to one another and thus stabilize the glucagon alpha helix. Alternatively, i can be 17.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some specific embodiments, wherein the amino acids at positions i and i+4 are joined by an intramolecular bridge, the size of the linker is about 8 atoms, or about 7-9 atoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the intramolecular bridge is formed between two amino acids that are two amino acids apart, e.g., amino acids at positions j and j+3, wherein j is any integer between 12 and 26 (e.g., 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, and 26) according to the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon. In some specific embodiments, j is 17.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some specific embodiments, wherein amino acids at positions j and j+3 are joined by an intramolecular bridge, the size of the linker is about 6 atoms, or about 5 to 7 atoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet other embodiments, the intramolecular bridge is formed between two amino acids that are 6 amino acids apart, e.g., amino acids at positions k and k+7, wherein k is any integer between 12 and 22 (e.g., 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 22) according to the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon. In some specific embodiments, k is 12, 13, or 17. In an exemplary embodiment, k is 17.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of amino acid pairings that are capable of covalently bonding to form a six-atom linking bridge include Orn and Asp, Glu and an amino acid of Formula I, wherein n is 2, and homoglutamic acid and an amino acid of Formula I, wherein n is 1, wherein Formula I is:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of amino acid pairing that are capable of covalently bonding to form a seven-atom linking bridge include Orn-Glu (lactam ring); Lys-Asp (lactam); or Homoser-Homoglu (lactone). Examples of amino acid pairings that may form an eight-atom linker include Lys-Glu (lactam); Homolys-Asp (lactam); Orn-Homoglu (lactam); 4-aminoPhe-Asp (lactam); or Tyr-Asp (lactone). Examples of amino acid pairings that may form a nine-atom linker include Homolys-Glu (lactam); Lys-Homoglu (lactam); 4-aminoPhe-Glu (lactam); or Tyr-Glu (lactone). Any of the side chains on these amino acids may additionally be substituted with additional chemical groups, so long as the three-dimensional structure of the alpha-helix is not disrupted. One of ordinary skill in the art can envision alternative pairings or alternative amino acid analogs, including chemically modified derivatives, that would create a stabilizing structure of similar size and desired effect. For example, a homocysteine-homocysteine disulfide bridge is 6 atoms in length and may be further modified to provide the desired effect. Even without covalent linkage, the amino acid pairings described above or similar pairings that one of ordinary skill in the art can envision may also provide added stability to the alpha-helix through non-covalent bonds, for example, through formation of salt bridges or hydrogen-bonding interactions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe size of a lactam ring can vary depending on the length of the amino acid side chains, and in one embodiment the lactam is formed by linking the side chains of a lysine amino acid to a glutamic acid side chain. Further exemplary embodiments (according to the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon) include the following pairings, optionally with a lactam bridge: Glu at position 12 with Lys at position 16; native Lys at position 12 with Glu at position 16; Glu at position 16 with Lys at \nposition\n 20; Lys at position 16 with Glu at \nposition\n 20; Glu at \nposition\n 20 with Lys at \nposition\n 24; Lys at \nposition\n 20 with Glu at \nposition\n 24; Glu at \nposition\n 24 with Lys at position 28; Lys at \nposition\n 24 with Glu at position 28. Alternatively, the order of the amide bond in the lactam ring can be reversed (e.g., a lactam ring can be formed between the side chains of a Lys12 and a Glu 16 or alternatively between a Glu 12 and a Lys16).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntramolecular bridges other than a lactam bridge can be used to stabilize the alpha helix of the glucagon analog peptides. In one embodiment, the intramolecular bridge is a hydrophobic bridge. In this instance, the intramolecular bridge optionally is between the side chains of two amino acids that are part of the hydrophobic face of the alpha helix of the glucagon analog peptide. For example, one of the amino acids joined by the hydrophobic bridge can be the amino acid at \nposition\n 10, 14, and 18 (according to the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one specific aspect, olefin metathesis is used to cross-link one or two turns of the alpha helix of the glucagon peptide using an all-hydrocarbon cross-linking system. The glucagon peptide in this instance can comprise α-methylated amino acids bearing olefinic side chains of varying length and configured with either R or S stereochemistry at the i and i+4 or i+7 positions. For example, the olefinic side can can comprise (CH\n2\n)\nn\n, wherein n is any integer between 1 to 6. In one embodiment, n is 3 for a cross-link length of 8 atoms. Suitable methods of forming such intramolecular bridges are described in the art. See, for example, Schafineister et al., \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n122: 5891-5892 (2000) and Walensky et al., \nScience \n305: 1466-1470 (2004). Alternatively, the glucagon peptide can comprise O-allyl Ser residues located on adjacent helical turns, which are bridged together via ruthenium-catalyzed ring closing metathesis. Such procedures of cross-linking are described in, for example, Blackwell et al., \nAngew, Chem., Int. Ed. \n37: 3281-3284 (1998).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another specific aspect, use of the unnatural thio-dialanine amino acid, lanthionine, which has been widely adopted as a peptidomimetic of cystine, is used to cross-link one turn of the alpha helix. Suitable methods of lanthionine-based cyclization are known in the art. See, for instance, Matteucci et al., \nTetrahedron Letters \n45: 1399-1401 (2004); Mayer et al., \nJ. Peptide Res. \n51: 432-436 (1998); Polinsky et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n35: 4185-4194 (1992); Osapay et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n40: 2241-2251 (1997); Fukase et al., \nBull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. \n65: 2227-2240 (1992); Harpp et al., \nJ. Org. Chem. \n36: 73-80 (1971); Goodman and Shao, \nPure Appl. Chem. \n68: 1303-1308 (1996); and Osapay and Goodman, \nJ. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. \n1599-1600 (1993).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, α, ω-diaminoalkane tethers, e.g., 1,4-diaminopropane and 1,5-diaminopentane) between two Glu residues at positions i and i+7 are used to stabilize the alpha helix of the glucagon peptide. Such tethers lead to the formation of a bridge 9-atoms or more in length, depending on the length of the diaminoalkane tether. Suitable methods of producing peptides cross-linked with such tethers are described in the art. See, for example, Phelan et al., \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n119: 455-460 (1997).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment of the invention, a disulfide bridge is used to cross-link one or two turns of the alpha helix of the glucagon peptide. Alternatively, a modified disulfide bridge in which one or both sulfur atoms are replaced by a methylene group resulting in an isosteric macrocyclization is used to stabilize the alpha helix of the glucagon peptide. Suitable methods of modifying peptides with disulfide bridges or sulfur-based cyclization are described in, for example, Jackson et al., \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n113: 9391-9392 (1991) and Rudinger and Jost, \nExperientia \n20: 570-571 (1964).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment, the alpha helix of the glucagon peptide is stabilized via the binding of metal atom by two His residues or a His and Cys pair positioned at i and i+4. The metal atom can be, for example, Ru(III), Cu(II), Zn(II), or Cd(II). Such methods of metal binding-based alpha helix stabilization are known in the art. See, for example, Andrews and Tabor, \nTetrahedron \n55: 11711-11743 (1999); Ghadiri et al., \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n112: 1630-1632 (1990); and Ghadiri et al., \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n119: 9063-9064 (1997).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe alpha helix of the glucagon peptide can alternatively be stabilized through other means of peptide cyclizing, which means are reviewed in Davies, \nJ. Peptide. Sci. \n9: 471-501 (2003). The alpha helix can be stabilized via the formation of an amide bridge, thioether bridge, thioester bridge, urea bridge, carbamate bridge, sulfonamide bridge, and the like. For example, a thioester bridge can be formed between the C-terminus and the side chain of a Cys residue. Alternatively, a thioester can be formed via side chains of amino acids having a thiol (Cys) and a carboxylic acid (e.g., Asp, Glu). In another method, a cross-linking agent, such as a dicarboxylic acid, e.g. suberic acid (octanedioic acid), etc. can introduce a link between two functional groups of an amino acid side chain, such as a free amino, hydroxyl, thiol group, and combinations thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with one embodiment, the alpha helix of the glucagon peptide is stabilized through the incorporation of hydrophobic amino acids at positions i and i+4. For instance, i can be Tyr and i+4 can be either Val or Leu; i can be Phe and i+4 can be Cys or Met; I can be Cys and i+4 can be Met; or i can be Phe and i+4 can be Ile. It should be understood that, for purposes herein, the above amino acid pairings can be reversed, such that the indicated amino acid at position i could alternatively be located at i+4, while the i+4 amino acid can be located at the i position.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with other embodiments of the invention, the alpha helix is stabilized through incorporation (either by amino acid substitution or insertion) of one or more alpha helix-stabilizing amino acids at the C-terminal portion of the glucagon peptide (around amino acids 12-29 according to the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon). In a specific embodiment, the alpha helix-stabilizing amino acid is an α,α-disubstituted amino acid, including, but not limited to any of amino iso-butyric acid (AIB), an amino acid disubstituted with the same or a different group selected from methyl, ethyl, propyl, and n-butyl, or with a cyclooctane or cycloheptane (e.g., 1-aminocyclooctane-1-carboxylic acid). In some embodiments, one, two, three, four or more of \n \npositions\n \n 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24 or 29 (according to the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon) is substituted with an α,α-disubstituted amino acid. In a specific embodiment, one, two, three or all of \npositions\n 16, 20, 21, and 24 (according to the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon) are substituted with AIB.\n\n\n \nLinkage of Hydrophilic Moieties\n\n\n \n \n \nIn another embodiment the solubility of the glucagon peptides disclosed herein are enhanced by the covalent linkage of a hydrophilic moiety to the peptide. Hydrophilic moieties can be attached to the glucagon peptides under any suitable conditions used to react a protein with an activated polymer molecule. Any means known in the art can be used, including via acylation, reductive alkylation, Michael addition, thiol alkylation or other chemoselective conjugation/ligation methods through a reactive group on the PEG moiety (e.g., an aldehyde, amino, ester, thiol, α-haloacetyl, maleimido or hydrazino group) to a reactive group on the target compound (e.g., an aldehyde, amino, ester, thiol, α-haloacetyl, maleimido or hydrazino group). Activating groups which can be used to link the water soluble polymer to one or more proteins include without limitation sulfone, maleimide, sulfhydryl, thiol, triflate, tresylate, azidirine, oxirane and 5-pyridyl. If attached to the peptide by reductive alkylation, the polymer selected should have a single reactive aldehyde so that the degree of polymerization is controlled.

Drug Delivery Rev. \n16: 157-182 (1995).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable hydrophilic moieties include polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylene glycol, polyoxyethylated polyols (e.g., POG), polyoxyethylated sorbitol, polyoxyethylated glucose, polyoxyethylated glycerol (POG), polyoxyalkylenes, polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde, copolymers of ethylene glycol/propylene glycol, monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol, mono-(C1-C10) alkoxy- or aryloxy-polyethylene glycol, carboxymethylcellulose, polyacetals, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyvinyl pyrrolidone, poly-1,3-dioxolane, poly-1,3,6-trioxane, ethylene/maleic anhydride copolymer, poly (.beta.-amino acids) (either homopolymers or random copolymers), poly(n-vinyl pyrrolidone)polyethylene glycol, propropylene glycol homopolymers (PPG) and other polyakylene oxides, polypropylene oxide/ethylene oxide copolymers, colonic acids or other polysaccharide polymers, Ficoll or dextran and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe hydrophilic moiety, e.g., polyethylene glycol chain in accordance with some embodiments has a molecular weight selected from the range of about 500 to about 40,000 Daltons. In one embodiment the hydrophilic moiety, e.g. PEG, has a molecular weight selected from the range of about 500 to about 5,000 Daltons, or about 1,000 to about 5,000 Daltons. In another embodiment the hydrophilic moiety, e.g., PEG, has a molecular weight of about 10,000 to about 20,000 Daltons. In yet other exemplary embodiments the hydrophilic moiety, e.g., PEG, has a molecular weight of about 20,000 to about 40,000 Daltons.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment dextrans are used as the hydrophilic moiety. Dextrans are polysaccharide polymers of glucose subunits, predominantly linked by α1-6 linkages. Dextran is available in many molecular weight ranges, e.g., about 1 kD to about 100 kD, or from about 5, 10, 15 or 20 kD to about 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 or 90 kD.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLinear or branched polymers are contemplated. Resulting preparations of conjugates may be essentially monodisperse or polydisperse, and may have about 0.5, 0.7, 1, 1.2, 1.5 or 2 polymer moieties per peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the hydrophilic moiety is a polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain, optionally linked to the peptide at one or more of \n \n \npositions\n \n \n 1, 16, 17, 20, 21, 24, 29 (according to the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon), a position within a C-terminal extension, e.g., 30, or at the N- or C-terminal amino acid. In some embodiments, the native amino acid at that position is substituted with an amino acid having a side chain suitable for crosslinking with hydrophilic moieties, to facilitate linkage of the hydrophilic moiety to the peptide. In exemplary embodiments, the native amino acid at that position is substituted with Lys, Cys, Orn, homocysteine, or acetyl-phenylalanine residue. In other embodiments, an amino acid modified to comprise a hydrophilic group is added to the peptide at the N- or C-terminus.\n\n\n \nConjugates and Fusions\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present disclosure also encompasses other conjugates in which glucagon peptides of the invention are linked, optionally via covalent bonding and optionally via a linker, to a conjugate moiety. Linkage can be accomplished by covalent chemical bonds, physical forces such electrostatic, hydrogen, ionic, van der Waals, or hydrophobic or hydrophilic interactions. A variety of non-covalent coupling systems may be used, including biotin-avidin, ligand/receptor, enzyme/substrate, nucleic acid/nucleic acid binding protein, lipid/lipid binding protein, cellular adhesion molecule partners; or any binding partners or fragments thereof which have affinity for each other.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptide can be linked to conjugate moieties via direct covalent linkage by reacting targeted amino acid residues of the peptide with an organic derivatizing agent that is capable of reacting with selected side chains or the N- or C-terminal residues of these targeted amino acids. Reactive groups on the peptide or conjugate include, e.g., an aldehyde, amino, ester, thiol, α-haloacetyl, maleimido or hydrazino group. Derivatizing agents include, for example, maleimidobenzoyl sulfosuccinimide ester (conjugation through cysteine residues), N-hydroxysuccinimide (through lysine residues), glutaraldehyde, succinic anhydride or other agents known in the art. Alternatively, the conjugate moieties can be linked to the peptide indirectly through intermediate carriers, such as polysaccharide or polypeptide carriers. Examples of polysaccharide carriers include aminodextran. Examples of suitable polypeptide carriers include polylysine, polyglutamic acid, polyaspartic acid, co-polymers thereof, and mixed polymers of these amino acids and others, e.g., serines, to confer desirable solubility properties on the resultant loaded carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCysteinyl residues most commonly are reacted with α-haloacetates (and corresponding amines), such as chloroacetic acid or chloroacetamide, to give carboxymethyl or carboxyamidomethyl derivatives. Cysteinyl residues also are derivatized by reaction with bromotrifluoroacetone, alpha-bromo-β-(5-imidozoyl)propionic acid, chloroacetyl phosphate, N-alkylmaleimides, 3-nitro-2-pyridyl disulfide, methyl 2-pyridyl disulfide, p-chloromercuribenzoate, 2-chloromercuri-4-nitrophenol, or chloro-7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHistidyl residues are derivatized by reaction with diethylpyrocarbonate at pH 5.5-7.0 because this agent is relatively specific for the histidyl side chain. Para-bromophenacyl bromide also is useful; the reaction is preferably performed in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate at pH 6.0.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLysinyl and amino-terminal residues are reacted with succinic or other carboxylic acid anhydrides. Derivatization with these agents has the effect of reversing the charge of the lysinyl residues. Other suitable reagents for derivatizing alpha-amino-containing residues include imidoesters such as methyl picolinimidate, pyridoxal phosphate, pyridoxal, chloroborohydride, trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid, O-methylisourea, 2,4-pentanedione, and transaminase-catalyzed reaction with glyoxylate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nArginyl residues are modified by reaction with one or several conventional reagents, among them phenylglyoxal, 2,3-butanedione, 1,2-cyclohexanedione, and ninhydrin. Derivatization of arginine residues requires that the reaction be performed in alkaline conditions because of the high pK\na \nof the guanidine functional group. Furthermore, these reagents may react with the groups of lysine as well as the arginine epsilon-amino group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe specific modification of tyrosyl residues may be made, with particular interest in introducing spectral labels into tyrosyl residues by reaction with aromatic diazonium compounds or tetranitromethane. Most commonly, N-acetylimidizole and tetranitromethane are used to form O-acetyl tyrosyl species and 3-nitro derivatives, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCarboxyl side groups (aspartyl or glutamyl) are selectively modified by reaction with carbodiimides (R—N═C═N—R′), where R and R′ are different alkyl groups, such as 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinyl-4-ethyl) carbodiimide or 1-ethyl-3-(4-azonia-4,4-dimethylpentyl) carbodiimide Furthermore, aspartyl and glutamyl residues are converted to asparaginyl and glutaminyl residues by reaction with ammonium ions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther modifications include hydroxylation of proline and lysine, phosphorylation of hydroxyl groups of seryl or threonyl residues, methylation of the alpha-amino groups of lysine, arginine, and histidine side chains (T. E. Creighton, Proteins: Structure and Molecular Properties, W.H. Freeman & Co., San Francisco, pp. 79-86 (1983)), deamidation of asparagines or glutamine, acetylation of the N-terminal amine, and/or amidation or esterification of the C-terminal carboxylic acid group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother type of covalent modification involves chemically or enzymatically coupling glycosides to the peptide. Sugar(s) may be attached to (a) arginine and histidine, (b) free carboxyl groups, (c) free sulfhydryl groups such as those of cysteine, (d) free hydroxyl groups such as those of serine, threonine, or hydroxyproline, (e) aromatic residues such as those of tyrosine, or tryptophan, or (f) the amide group of glutamine. These methods are described in WO87/05330 published 11 Sep. 1987, and in Aplin and Wriston, CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem., pp. 259-306 (1981).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary conjugate moieties that can be linked to any of the glucagon peptides described herein include but are not limited to a heterologous peptide or polypeptide (including for example, a plasma protein), a targeting agent, an immunoglobulin or portion thereof (e.g. variable region, CDR, or Fc region), a diagnostic label such as a radioisotope, fluorophore or enzymatic label, a polymer including water soluble polymers, or other therapeutic or diagnostic agents. In one embodiment a conjugate is provided comprising a glucagon peptide disclosed herein and a plasma protein, wherein the plasma protein is selected form the group consisting of albumin, transferin, fibrinogen and globulins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the linker comprises a chain of atoms from 1 to about 60, or 1 to 30 atoms or longer, 2 to 5 atoms, 2 to 10 atoms, 5 to 10 atoms, or 10 to 20 atoms long. In some embodiments, the chain atoms are all carbon atoms. In some embodiments, the chain atoms in the backbone of the linker are selected from the group consisting of C, O, N, and S. Chain atoms and linkers may be selected according to their expected solubility (hydrophilicity) so as to provide a more soluble conjugate. In some embodiments, the linker provides a functional group that is subject to cleavage by an enzyme or other catalyst or hydrolytic conditions found in the target tissue or organ or cell. In some embodiments, the length of the linker is long enough to reduce the potential for steric hindrance. If the linker is a covalent bond or a peptidyl bond and the conjugate is a polypeptide, the entire conjugate can be a fusion protein. Such peptidyl linkers may be any length. Exemplary linkers are from about 1 to 50 amino acids in length, 5 to 50, 3 to 5, 5 to 10, 5 to 15, or 10 to 30 amino acids in length. Such fusion proteins may alternatively be produced by recombinant genetic engineering methods known to one of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs noted above, in some embodiments, the glucagon peptides are conjugated, e.g., fused to an immunoglobulin or portion thereof (e.g. variable region, CDR, or Fc region). Known types of immunoglobulins (Ig) include IgG, IgA, IgE, IgD or IgM. The Fc region is a C-terminal region of an Ig heavy chain, which is responsible for binding to Fc receptors that carry out activities such as recycling (which results in prolonged half-life), antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), and complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, according to some definitions the human IgG heavy chain Fc region stretches from Cys226 to the C-terminus of the heavy chain. The “hinge region” generally extends from Glu216 to Pro230 of human IgG1 (hinge regions of other IgG isotypes may be aligned with the IgG1 sequence by aligning the cysteines involved in cysteine bonding). The Fc region of an IgG includes two constant domains, CH2 and CH3. The CH2 domain of a human IgG Fc region usually extends from amino acids 231 to amino acid 341. The CH3 domain of a human IgG Fc region usually extends from amino acids 342 to 447. References made to amino acid numbering of immunoglobulins or immunoglobulin fragments, or regions, are all based on Kabat et al. 1991, Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, U.S. Department of Public Health, Bethesda, Md. In a related embodiments, the Fc region may comprise one or more native or modified constant regions from an immunoglobulin heavy chain, other than CH1, for example, the CH2 and CH3 regions of IgG and IgA, or the CH3 and CH4 regions of IgE.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable conjugate moieties include portions of immunoglobulin sequence that include the FcRn binding site. FcRn, a salvage receptor, is responsible for recycling immunoglobulins and returning them to circulation in blood. The region of the Fc portion of IgG that binds to the FcRn receptor has been described based on X-ray crystallography (Burmeister et al. 1994, Nature 372:379). The major contact area of the Fc with the FcRn is near the junction of the CH2 and CH3 domains. Fc-FcRn contacts are all within a single Ig heavy chain. The major contact sites include amino acid residues 248, 250-257, 272, 285, 288, 290-291, 308-311, and 314 of the CH2 domain and amino acid residues 385-387, 428, and 433-436 of the CH3 domain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome conjugate moieties may or may not include FcγR binding site(s). FcγR are responsible for ADCC and CDC. Examples of positions within the Fc region that make a direct contact with FcγR are amino acids 234-239 (lower hinge region), amino acids 265-269 (B/C loop), amino acids 297-299 (C′/E loop), and amino acids 327-332 (F/G) loop (Sondermann et al., Nature 406: 267-273, 2000). The lower hinge region of IgE has also been implicated in the FcRI binding (Henry, et al., Biochemistry 36, 15568-15578, 1997). Residues involved in IgA receptor binding are described in Lewis et al., (J. Immunol. 175:6694-701, 2005). Amino acid residues involved in IgE receptor binding are described in Sayers et al. (J Biol. Chem. 279(34):35320-5, 2004).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmino acid modifications may be made to the Fc region of an immunoglobulin. Such variant Fc regions comprise at least one amino acid modification in the CH3 domain of the Fc region (residues 342-447) and/or at least one amino acid modification in the CH2 domain of the Fc region (residues 231-341). Mutations believed to impart an increased affinity for FcRn include T256A, T307A, E380A, and N434A (Shields et al. 2001, J. Biol. Chem. 276:6591). Other mutations may reduce binding of the Fc region to FcγRI, FcγRIIA, FcγRIIB, and/or FcγRIIIA without significantly reducing affinity for FcRn. For example, substitution of the Asn at position 297 of the Fc region with Ala or another amino acid removes a highly conserved N-glycosylation site and may result in reduced immunogenicity with concomitant prolonged half-life of the Fc region, as well as reduced binding to FcγRs (Routledge et al. 1995, Transplantation 60:847; Friend et al. 1999, Transplantation 68:1632; Shields et al. 1995, J. Biol. Chem. 276:6591). Amino acid modifications at positions 233-236 of IgG1 have been made that reduce binding to FcγRs (Ward and Ghetie 1995, Therapeutic Immunology 2:77 and Armour et al. 1999, Eur. J. Immunol. 29:2613). Some exemplary amino acid substitutions are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,355,008 and 7,381,408, each incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present disclosure also encompasses glucagon fusion peptides or proteins wherein a second peptide or polypeptide has been fused to a terminus, e.g., the carboxy terminus of the glucagon peptide. In some embodiments the second peptide added to the carboxy terminus of the glucagon peptide is GPSSGAPPPS, KRNRNNIA or KRNR linked to amino acid 29 of the glucagon peptide (according to the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon). In other embodiments, the second peptide is XGPSSGAPPPS, wherein X is selected from one of the 20 common amino acids, e.g., glutamic acid, aspartic acid or glycine. In one embodiment X represents an amino acid, for example Cys, that further comprises a hydrophilic moiety covalently linked to the side chain of that amino acid. Such C-terminal extensions improve solubility and also can improve glucagon or GLP-1 activity. In some embodiments wherein the glucagon peptide further comprises a carboxy terminal extension, the carboxy terminal amino acid of the extension ends in an amide group or an ester group rather than a carboxylic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, e.g., in glucagon peptides which comprise the C-terminal extension, the threonine at position 29 (according to the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon) is replaced with a glycine. For example, a glucagon peptide having a glycine substitution for threonine at position 29 and comprising the C-terminal extension of GPSSGAPPPS is four times as potent at the GLP-1 receptor as native glucagon modified to comprise the same C-terminal extension. This T29G substitution can be used in conjunction with other modifications disclosed herein to enhance the affinity of the glucagon peptides for the GLP-1 receptor. For example, the T29G substitution can be combined with the S16E and N20K amino acid substitutions (according to the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon), optionally with a lactam bridge between \namino acids\n 16 and 20, and optionally with addition of a PEG chain as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments an amino acid is added to the C-terminus, and the additional amino acid is selected from the group consisting of glutamic acid, aspartic acid and glycine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present disclosure also encompasses multimers of the modified glucagon peptides disclosed herein. Two or more of the modified glucagon peptides can be linked together using standard linking agents and procedures known to those skilled in the art. For example, dimers can be formed between two modified glucagon peptides through the use of bifunctional thiol crosslinkers and bi-functional amine crosslinkers, particularly for the glucagon peptides that have been substituted with cysteine, lysine ornithine, homocysteine or acetyl phenylalanine residues.\n\n\n \nAcylation and Alkylation\n\n\n \n \n \nIn accordance with some embodiments, the glucagon peptides disclosed herein are modified to comprise an acyl group or alkyl group. Acylation or alkylation can increase the half-life of the glucagon peptides in circulation. Acylation or alkylation can advantageously delay the onset of action and/or extend the duration of action at the glucagon and/or GLP-1 receptors and/or improve resistance to proteases such as DPP-IV and/or improve solubility. In some embodiments, the potency of the acylated glucagon peptides is comparable to the unacylated versions of the glucagon peptides. Glucagon peptides may be acylated or alkylated at the same amino acid position where a hydrophilic moiety is linked, or at a different amino acid position.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the invention provides a glucagon peptide modified to comprise an acyl group or alkyl group covalently linked to the amino acid at \nposition\n 10 of the glucagon peptide (according to the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon). The glucagon peptide may further comprise a spacer between the amino acid at \nposition\n 10 of the glucagon peptide and the acyl group or alkyl group. In some embodiments, the acyl group is a fatty acid or bile acid, or salt thereof, e.g. a C4 to C30 fatty acid, a C8 to C24 fatty acid, cholic acid, a C4 to C30 alkyl, a C8 to C24 alkyl, or an alkyl comprising a steroid moiety of a bile acid. The spacer is any moiety with suitable reactive groups for attaching acyl or alkyl groups. In exemplary embodiments, the spacer comprises an amino acid, a dipeptide, or a tripeptide, or a hydrophilic bifunctional spacer. In some embodiments, the spacer is selected from the group consisting of: Trp, Glu, Asp, Cys and a spacer comprising NH\n2\n(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)\nn\n(CH\n2\n)\nm\nCOOH, wherein m is any integer from 1 to 6 and n is any integer from 2 to 12. Such acylated or alkylated glucagon peptides may also further comprise a hydrophilic moiety, optionally a polyethylene glycol. Any of the foregoing glucagon peptides may comprise two acyl groups or two alkyl groups, or a combination thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAcylation can be carried out at any positions within the glucagon peptide, including any of positions 1-29, a position within a C-terminal extension, or the C-terminal amino acid, provided that glucagon antagonist activity (and optionally GLP-1 activity) is retained. Nonlimiting examples include \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 27, 28, or 29 (according to the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon). The acyl group can be covalently linked directly to an amino acid of the glucagon peptide, or indirectly to an amino acid of the glucagon peptide via a spacer, wherein the spacer is positioned between the amino acid of the glucagons peptide and the acyl group. Glucagon peptides may be acylated at the same amino acid position where a hydrophilic moiety is linked, or at a different amino acid position. Nonlimiting examples include acylation at position 10 (according to the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon) and pegylation at one or more positions in the C-terminal portion of the glucagon peptide, e.g., \nposition\n 24, 28 or 29 (according to the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon), within a C-terminal extension, or at the C-terminus (e.g., through adding a C-terminal Cys).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a specific aspect of the invention, the glucagon peptide is modified to comprise an acyl group by direct acylation of an amine, hydroxyl, or thiol of a side chain of an amino acid of the glucagon peptide. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptide is directly acylated through the side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol of an amino acid. In some embodiments, acylation is at \n \n \nposition\n \n \n 10, 20, 24, or 29 (according to the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon). In this regard, the acylated glucagon peptide can comprise the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2, or a modified amino acid sequence thereof comprising one or more of the amino acid modifications described herein, with at least one of the amino acids at \n \n \npositions\n \n \n 10, 20, 24, and 29 (according to the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon) modified to any amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol. In some specific embodiments of the invention, the direct acylation of the glucagon peptide occurs through the side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol of the amino acid at position 10 (according to the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the amino acid comprising a side chain amine is an amino acid of Formula I:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nIn some exemplary embodiments, the amino acid of Formula I, is the amino acid wherein n is 4 (Lys) or n is 3 (Orn).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the amino acid comprising a side chain hydroxyl is an amino acid of Formula II:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nIn some exemplary embodiments, the amino acid of Formula II is the amino acid wherein n is 1 (Ser).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet other embodiments, the amino acid comprising a side chain thiol is an amino acid of Formula III:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nIn some exemplary embodiments, the amino acid of Formula II is the amino acid wherein n is 1 (Cys).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the invention, the acylated glucagon peptide comprises a spacer between the peptide and the acyl group. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptide is covalently bound to the spacer, which is covalently bound to the acyl group. In some exemplary embodiments, the glucagon peptide is modified to comprise an acyl group by acylation of an amine, hydroxyl, or thiol of a spacer, which spacer is attached to a side chain of an amino acid at \n \n \nposition\n \n \n 10, 20, 24, or 29 (according to the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon), or at the C-terminal amino acid of the glucagon peptide. The amino acid to which the spacer is attached can be any amino acid comprising a moiety which permits linkage to the spacer. For example, an amino acid comprising a side chain NH\n2\n, —OH, or —COOH (e.g., Lys, Orn, Ser, Asp, or Glu) is suitable. In this respect, the acylated glucagon peptide can comprise the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, or a modified amino acid sequence thereof comprising one or more of the amino acid modifications described herein, with at least one of the amino acids at \n \n \npositions\n \n \n 10, 20, 24, and 29 (according to the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon) modified to any amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or carboxylate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the spacer is an amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol, or a dipeptide or tripeptide comprising an amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen acylation occurs through an amine group of a spacer the acylation can occur through the alpha amine of the amino acid or a side chain amine. In the instance in which the alpha amine is acylated, the spacer amino acid can be any amino acid. For example, the spacer amino acid can be a hydrophobic amino acid, e.g., Gly, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, Trp, Met, Phe, Tyr. Alternatively, the spacer amino acid can be an acidic residue, e.g., Asp and Glu. In the instance in which the side chain amine of the spacer amino acid is acylated, the spacer amino acid is an amino acid comprising a side chain amine, e.g., an amino acid of Formula I (e.g., Lys or Orn). In this instance, it is possible for both the alpha amine and the side chain amine of the spacer amino acid to be acylated, such that the glucagon peptide is diacylated. Embodiments of the invention include such diacylated molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen acylation occurs through a hydroxyl group of a spacer, the amino acid or one of the amino acids of the dipeptide or tripeptide can be an amino acid of Formula II. In a specific exemplary embodiment, the amino acid is Ser.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen acylation occurs through a thiol group of a spacer, the amino acid or one of the amino acids of the dipeptide or tripeptide can be an amino acid of Formula III. In a specific exemplary embodiment, the amino acid is Cys.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the spacer comprises a hydrophilic bifunctional spacer. In a specific embodiment, the spacer comprises an amino poly(alkyloxy)carboxylate. In this regard, the spacer can comprise, for example, NH\n2\n(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)\nn\n(CH\n2\n)\nm\nCOOH, wherein m is any integer from 1 to 6 and n is any integer from 2 to 12, such as, e.g., 8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoic acid, which is commercially available from Peptides International, Inc. (Louisville, Ky.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable methods of peptide acylation via amines, hydroxyls, and thiols are known in the art. See, for example, Example 19 (for methods of acylating through an amine), Miller, \nBiochem Biophys Res Commun \n218: 377-382 (1996); Shimohigashi and Stammer, \nInt J Pept Protein Res \n19: 54-62 (1982); and Previero et al., \nBiochim Biophys Acta \n263: 7-13 (1972) (for methods of acylating through a hydroxyl); and San and Silvius, \nJ Pept Res \n66: 169-180 (2005) (for methods of acylating through a thiol); \nBioconjugate Chem\n. “Chemical Modifications of Proteins: History and Applications” pages 1, 2-12 (1990); Hashimoto et al., \nPharmacuetical Res\n. “Synthesis of Palmitoyl Derivatives of Insulin and their Biological Activity” Vol. 6, No: 2 pp. 171-176 (1989).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe acyl group of the acylated glucagon peptide can be of any size, e.g., any length carbon chain, and can be linear or branched. In some specific embodiments of the invention, the acyl group is a C4 to C30 fatty acid. For example, the acyl group can be any of a C4 fatty acid, C6 fatty acid, C8 fatty acid, C10 fatty acid, C12 fatty acid, C14 fatty acid, C16 fatty acid, C18 fatty acid, C20 fatty acid, C22 fatty acid, C24 fatty acid, C26 fatty acid, C28 fatty acid, or a C30 fatty acid. In some embodiments, the acyl group is a C8 to C20 fatty acid, e.g., a C14 fatty acid or a C16 fatty acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an alternative embodiment, the acyl group is a bile acid.

Boc amino acids and HBTU were obtained from Midwest Biotech (Fishers, Ind.). General side chain protecting groups used were: Arg(Tos), Asn(Xan), Asp(OcHex), Cys(pMeBzl), His(Bom), Lys(2C1-Z), Ser(OBzl), Thr(OBzl), Tyr(2Br—Z), and Trp(CHO). Boc-Glu(OFm)—OH and Boc-Lys(Fmoc)-OH (Chem-Impex, Wood dale, IL) were used in the lactam-bridge formation sites. The N-terminal 3-phenyllacetic acid (PLA) (Aldrich, Milwaukee, Wis.) was coupled manually by BEPBT (3-(Diethoxy-phosphoryloxy)-3H-benzo[d][1,2,3] triazin-4-one (Synchem Inc., Aurora, Ohio) after the automated solid phase synthesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter peptide solid phase synthesis, each completed peptidyl resin was treated with 20% piperidine/DMF to remove the Fmoc groups. For the lactam-bridge formation, usually 299 mg (1 mmole, 5-fold) BEPBT were added in 10% DIEA/DMF and reacted for 2˜4 h until ninhydrin test shown negative.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptides were cleaved by liquid hydrogen fluoride cleavages performed in the presence of p-cresol and dimethyl sulfide. The cleavage was run for 1 hour in an ice bath using an HF apparatus (Penninsula Labs). After evaporation of the HF, the residue was suspended in diethyl ether and the solid materials were filtered and washed with ether. Each peptide was extracted into 30-70 ml aqueous acetic acid and diluted with water and lyophilized. Crude peptide was analyzed by analytical HPLC and peptide molecule weight was checked by ESI or MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Peptides were then purified by the general HPLC purification procedure.\n\n\n \n \nGeneral Peptide Synthesis Protocol with Fmoc-Chemistry Strategy:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptides were synthesized on an ABI 433A automated peptide synthesizer using standard Fmoc chemistry with Rink MBHA amide resin or first amino acid attached Wang resin (Novabiochem, San Diego, Calif.) using DIC/HOBT as coupling reagent. 3-phenyllacetic acid (PLA) was coupled manually by BEPBT after the automated peptide synthesis. The side chain protecting groups of N\nα\n-Fmoc [N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl]amino acids were as follows: Arg, Pmc; Asp, OtBu; Cys, Trt; Gln, Trt; His, Trt; Lys, Boc; Ser, tBu, Tyr, tBu; and Trp, Boc (Pmc=2,2,5,7,8-pentamethylchoman-6-sulfonyl, OtBu=tert-butyl ester, Trt=trityl, Boc=tert-butyloxycarbonyl, and tBu=tert-butyl ester). Fmoc-Glu(O-2-PhiPr)—OH and Fmoc-Lys(Mmt)-OH (Novabiochem, San Diego, Calif.) were incorporated in the lactam-bridge formation sites.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter solid phase synthesis, the 2-phenylisopropyl (2-PhiPr) group on the Glu and the 4-methoxytrityl (Mmt) group on the Lys were removed by flashing 1% TFA/DCM though the peptidyl resin. For the lactam-bridge formation, usually 150 mg (0.5 mmole, 5-fold) BEPBT were added in 10% DIEA/DMF and reacted for 2˜4 h until ninhydrin test shown negative.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptides were cleaved from the resin with cleavage cocktail containing 85% TFA, 5% phenol, 5% water and 5% thioanisole (2.5% EDT was added when peptide contains Cysteine). Crude peptides were precipitated in ether, centrifuged, and lyophilized. Peptides were then analyzed by analytical HPLC and checked by ESI or MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Peptides were purified by the general HPLC purification procedure.\n\n\n \nGeneral Analytical HPLC Procedure:\n\n\n \n \n \nAnalytical HPLC was performed on a Beckman System Gold HPLC system with a ZORBAX SB-C8 column (0.46×5 cm, 5 μm, Agilent) with a gradient elution at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min and monitored at 214 nm. The gradients were set up as 10% B to 80% B over 10 min and then 10% B for 5 min. Buffer A=0.1% TFA and B=0.1% TFA/90% acetonitrile.\n\n\n \nGeneral Preparative HPLC Purification Procedure:\n\n\n \n \n \nIf not specifically noted, the peptides were usually purified on a Waters 600E connected 486 monitor systems with semi-prepare HPLC column (ZORBAX SB-C8, 21.2×250 mm, 7 μm, Agilent) monitored at 214 nm or 230 nM. Buffer A=0.1% TFA/10% acetonitrile and B=0.1% TFA/90% acetonitrile. The gradients used for the purification were 0-30% B over 40 min, then 30-50% B over 30 min at a flow rate of 12 ml/min if not specifically noted. Fractions were analyzed by analytical HPLC and checked by mass spectrometry. The fractions over 90% pure were collected, lyophilized and stored. The fractions with purity between 60-90% were combined, lyophilized and purified again.\n\n\n \nGeneral Pegylation Protocol: (Cys-Maleimido)\n\n\n \n \n \nTypically, the glucagon Cys analog is dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (5-10 mg/ml) and 0.01M ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid is added (10-15% of total volume). Excess (1.2-2-fold) maleimido methoxy-polyethylene glycol (MAL-m-dPEG) reagent is added and the reaction stirred at room temp while monitoring reaction progress by HPLC. After 2-12 h, the reaction mixture, is acidified and loaded onto a preparative reverse phase column for purification using 0.1% TFA/acetonitrile gradients. The appropriate fractions were combined and lyophilized to give the desired pegylated derivatives.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor peptides that exhibit low solubility in PBS, the peptides were dissolved in 25% acetonitrile water or 4˜6M urea buffer with 50˜100 mM Tris (adjust pH 8.0-8.5) and reacted with PEG reagents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecific examples of compounds synthesized by the methods described above are provided as follows:\n\n\n \nSynthesis of [PLA6, D9, E16K20(lactam), D28]glucagon(6-29) amide\n\n\n \n \n \nA peptide sequence TSDYSKYLDERRAKDFVQWLMDT (SEQ ID NO: 49) was first solid phase synthesized on ABI 433A automated peptide synthesizer using 0.1 mmole Fmoc/HOBT/DCC chemistry program with 0.1 mmole Rink MBHA amide resin using DIC/HOBT as coupling reagent.

After the initial product (HPLC RT 7.85 min) was gone and the dimer product (HPLC RT 7.96 min) was the dominate product (˜24 h), the mixture was diluted with 0.1% TFA10% acetonitrile water and directly purified by preparative HPLC. After lyophilized about 6-10 mg [PLA6, D9, E16K20(lactam), C24, D28]glucagon (6-29) amide was obtained with ESI-MS 5942.0 corresponding the calculated MW 5942.6.\n\n\n \nExample 16\n\n\nAntagonist Activities of Glucagon Analogs\n\n\n \n \n \nThe receptor binding, cAMP induction and cAMP inhibition of glucagon and various glucagon derivative inhibitors were compared.

PLA is isoelectronic with phenylalanine (Phe) but has no titratable hydrogen. The data presented in Tables 9 & 10 demonstrate that with the PLA6 substitution, the native Asp9 analog exhibits pure antagonism but the potency is reduced relative to that of the Glu9 and hCys(SO\n3\nH)\n9 \nanalogs. The literature has previously, indicated that the native Asp9 residue has to be changed to Glu9 or hCys(SO\n3\nH)\n9 \nfor high affinity and potent antagonism of glucagon (2-29) analogs. Accordingly, it is surprising that substitution of Phe with PLA on a 6-29 shortened glucagon amide backbone improves the relative antagonist potency of the analog to a point comparable to that of the Glu9 and hCys(SO3H)\n9 \nanalogs. More specifically, the PLA6 analog increases the affinity of the analog for the glucagon receptor threefold as well as the potency of antagonism relative to the native Phe6 analog.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nResidue 9 substituted glucagon (6-29) analogs and their glucagon antagonism\n\n\n\n\n\n\nactivities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIC\n50 \n(nM)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nreceptor\n\n\ncAMP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeptide\n\n\nResidue 9\n\n\nbinding\n\n\npA\n2\n \n\n\nIC\n50 \n(nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlucagon\n\n\nAsp\n\n\n 1.0~2.5\n\n\n \n\n\n0.05~0.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(EC\n50\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[E\n9\n]Glucagon(aa6-29)-NH\n2\n \n\n\nGlu\n\n\n36.35 ± 5.23\n\n\n7.16 ± 0.27\n\n\n97.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[hCys(SO\n3\n)9]Glucagon(aa6-\n\n\nhCys(SO\n3\n)\n\n\n 59.11 ± 18.10\n\n\n7.16 ± 0.51\n\n\n133.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n29)-NH\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[hE\n9\n]Glucagon(aa6-29)-NH\n2\n \n\n\nhGlu\n\n\n162.9 ± 70.8\n\n\n6.27 ± 0.11\n\n\n472.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[C\n9\n(SCH\n2\nCOOH)]Glucagon(aa6-\n\n\nCSA-1\n\n\n107.3 ± 5.37\n\n\n6.68 ± 1.05\n\n\n101.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n29)-NH\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[C\n9\n(SCH\n2\nCH\n2\nCOOH)]Glucagon\n\n\nCSA-2\n\n\n146.4 ± 36.9\n\n\n6.64 ± 0.29\n\n\n116\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(aa6-29)-NH\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlucagon(aa6-29)-NH\n2\n \n\n\nAsp\n\n\n1670 ± —\n\n\n6.94 ± 0.63\n\n\n346\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[K\n9\n]Glucagon(aa6-29)-NH\n2\n \n\n\nLys\n\n\n3236 ± —\n\n\n6.58 ± 0.60\n\n\n398\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\namino acid positions according to the numbering of native glucagon indicated by superscripted numbers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nResidue 9 substituted [PLA6]glucagon (6-29) analogs and their glucagon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nantagonism activities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nIC\n50 \n(nM)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(cAMP, inhibit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIC\n50 \n(nM)\n\n\nGlucagon)\n\n\nSolubility\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeptide\n\n\n(Receptor binding)\n\n\n0.1 nM or\n\n\n0.2 nM\n\n\n(%, pH 6-8)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlucagon\n\n\n 1.96 ± 0.61\n\n\n0.09 (EC\n50\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[PLA\n6\n, D\n9\n]Glucagon(aa6-29)-\n\n\n13.85 ± 3.22\n\n\n6.90\n\n\n \n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNH\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[PLA\n6\n, D\n9\n]Glucagon(aa6-29)-\n\n\n15.51 ± 3.86\n\n\n13.20\n\n\n \n\n\n96\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOOH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[PLA\n6\n, E\n9\n]Glucagon(aa6-29)-\n\n\n12.33 ± 2.24\n\n\n2.39\n\n\n42.40\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNH\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[PLA\n6\n,\n\n\n14.20 ± 0.45\n\n\n \n\n\n40.20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhCys(SO\n3\n)\n9\n]Glucagon(aa6-29)-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNH\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[PLA\n6\n, D\n9\n, D\n28\n] Glucagon(aa6-\n\n\n 9.0 ± 1.24\n\n\n1.32\n\n\n \n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n29)-NH\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[PLA\n6\n, E\n9\n]Glucagon (aa6-\n\n\n 40.28 ± 11.29\n\n\n24.75\n\n\n \n\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n29 + CEX)-NH\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\namino acid positions according to the numbering of native glucagon indicated by superscripted numbers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effect of the PLA substitution at different positions of glucagon analog, including at \n \npositions\n \n 4 and 5 was also investigated.

There is a report of such a mixed glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonist in the literature as contributed by Bayer Research Labs [Journal of Endocrinology (2007) 192:371-80 & Journal of Biological Chemistry (2006) 282:12506-15]. However, analysis of the previously disclosed peptide (ANK2; SEQ ID NO: 37) revealed that the peptide possess no meaningful glucagon antagonism. More particularly, \nFIGS. 9A-9C\n present data showing that the Bayer peptide (ANK2; SEQ ID NO: 37), in comparison to the novel glucagon antaongist/GLP-1 agonists disclosed herein, is not a mixed glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonist. The ANK2 peptide has very potent GLP-1 agonism but demonstrates a weak, but full glucagon agonism. The peptides disclosed herein are chemically different in that they do not possess the native N-terminal residues, have an unnatural amino at the shortened N-terminus, and possess an internal linkage between the side chains of the analog (e.g., in the form of a salt bridge or a backbone lactam). The peptides can be selectively pegylated to extend the duration of action without changing the mixed agonist/antagonist properties.\n\n\n \nExample 18\n\n\n \n \n \nAll peptides described herein comprised a C-terminal amide in place of the C-terminal carboxylate, unless otherwise noted. The amino acid positions designated in the name of the peptide are in accordance with the numbering of native glucagon.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe glucagon antagonists described herein are acylated as follows:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAcylated and/or PEGylated peptides are prepared as follows. Peptides are synthesized on a solid support resin using either a CS Bio 4886 Peptide Synthesizer or Applied Biosystems 430A Peptide Synthesizer. In situ neutralization chemistry is used as described by Schnolzer et al., \nInt. J. Peptide Protein Res. \n40: 180-193 (1992). For acylated peptides, the target amino acid residue to be acylated (e.g., position ten) is substituted with an N ε-FMOC lysine residue. Treatment of the completed N-terminally BOC protected peptide with 20% piperidine in DMF for 30 minutes removes FMOC/formyl groups. Coupling to the free 8-amino Lys residue iss achieved by coupling a ten-fold molar excess of either an FMOC-protected spacer amino acid (ex. FMOC-(N—BOC)-Tryptophan-OH) or acyl chain (ex. C17-COOH) and PyBOP or DEPBT coupling reagent in DMF/DIEA. Subsequent removal of the spacer amino acid's FMOC group is followed by repetition of coupling with an acyl chain. Final treatment with 100% TFA results in removal of any side chain protecting groups and the N-terminal BOC group. Peptide resins are neutralized with 5% DIEA/DMF, dried, and then cleaved from the support using HF/p-cresol, 95:5, at 0° C. for one hour. Following ether extraction, a 5% HOAc solution is used to solvate the crude peptide. A sample of the solution is then verified to contain the correct molecular weight peptide by ESI-MS. Correct peptides are purified by RP-HPLC using a linear gradient of 10% CH3CN/0.1% TFA to 0.1% TFA in 100% CH3CN. A Vydac C18 22 mm×250 mm protein column is used for the purification. Acylated peptide analogs generally complete elution by a buffer ratio of 20:80. Portions are pooled together and checked for purity on an analytical RP-HPLC. Pure fractions are lyophilized yielding white, solid peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor peptide pegylation, 40 kDa methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) maleimido-propionamide (Chirotech Technology Ltd.) is reacted with a molar equivalent of peptide in 7M Urea, 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer using the minimal amount of solvent needed to dissolve both peptide and PEG into a clear solution (generally less than 2 mL for a reaction using 2-3 mg peptide). Vigorous stirring at room temperature is commenced for 4-6 hours and the reaction is analyzed by analytical RP-HPLC. PEGylated products appear distinct from the starting material with decreased retention times. Purification is performed on a Vydac C4 column with conditions similar to those used for the initial peptide purification. Elution occurs around buffer ratios of 50:50. Fractions of pure PEGylated peptide are found and lyophilized.\n\n\n \nExample 19\n\n\n \n \n \nAll peptides described herein comprised a C-terminal amide in place of the C-terminal carboxylate, unless otherwise noted. The amino acid positions designated in the name of the peptide are in accordance with the numbering of native glucagon.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe depesipeptide was assembled using conventional solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS). The PLA derivatized peptide chain was cyclized via a lactam bridge first and then esterified by amino acid using pre-activated symemterical anhydride manually. The classcial SPPS was continued to compolete the whole sequence. The standard cleavage procedure and purification method were applied to obtain the desired depsipeptide.\n\n\n \nExample\n\n\nSynthesis of lactam-bridge depsipeptide [Aib2, E3, Thr5-O-PLA6, E16K20(lactam), D28]G(2-29) amide\n\n\n \n \n \nA peptidyl resin with sequence HO-PLA-TSDYSKYLDERRAKDFVQWLMDT [PLA6, E16, K20, D28]glucagon(6-29) was synthesized by solid-phase Boc-chemistry using an ABI 430A automated peptide synthesizer with 0.2 mmole MBHA amide resin and DEPBT as coupling reagent. The following Boc amino acids were used: Ala, Arg(Tos), Asp(OcHx), Asn(Xan), Glu(OcHx), Gln(Xan), Leu, Lys(2-Cl—Z), Met, PLA, Ser(OBzl), Thr(OBzl), Trp(CHO), Tyr(2.6-di-Cl—Bzl) and Val except the glutamic acid at position 16 was incorporated with Boc-Glu(OFm)—OH and lysine at \nposition\n 20 was incorporated with Boc-Lys(Fmoc)-OH. After removal of Fm and Fmoc protecting groups at \nposition\n 16 and 20 with 20% piperidine in DMF, the peptidyl resin was treated with 300 mg (1 mmol) DEPBT in 10% DIEA/DMF for about 4 h to form the lactam bridge. To this lactam-bridged peptidyl resin was added a pre-activated symmetrical anhydride solution composed of Boc-Thr(OBzl)-OH (2 mmol)/DIC (1 mmol)/DMAP (0.2 mmol) in DCM and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 16 h. The remaining amino acids Boc-Gly-OH, Boc-Glu(OcHx)—OH and Boc-Aib-OH were coupled by standard Boc-chemistry again to obtain the depsipeptidyl resin of the following sequence: Aib-Glu-Gly-Thr-O-PLA-Thr-Ser-Asp-Tyr-Ser-Lys-Tyr-Leu-Asp-Glu*-Arg-Arg-Ala-Lys*-Asp-Phe-Val-Gln-Trp-Leu-Met-Asp-Thr-NH\n2\n. (*are lactam bridged)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptidyl resin was treated with liquid hydrogen fluoride to cleave the crude peptide from the solid support and remove all protecting groups. The depsipeptide was purified by preparative HPLC, and analyzed by MS and analytical HPLC. The purified peptide demonstrated a single peak in analytical RP-HPLC and the ESI-MS analysis yielded the desired mass of 3368.5 which corresponds with the calculated molecular weight of 3369.0 daltons.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilar procedure were used to synthesize the other lactam-bridge depsipeptides reported in this patent.\n\n\n \nExample 20\n\n\n \n \n \nAll peptides described herein comprised a C-terminal amide in place of the C-terminal carboxylate, unless otherwise noted.

The peptides were assembled using conventional solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS). The PLA derivatized peptide chain was cyclized via a lactam bridge. The standard cleavage procedure and purification method were applied to obtain the desired depsipeptide.\n\n\n \nExample\n\n\nSynthesis of cholesterol conjugated lactam-bridge peptide [PLA6, K10(COCH2CH2S-Chol), E16K20(lactam), D28]G(6-29) amide\n\n\n \n \n \nA peptidyl resin with sequence HO-PLA-TSDKSKYLDERRAKDFVQWLMDT [PLA6, K10, E16, K20, D28]glucagon(6-29) was synthesized by solid-phase Boc-chemistry using an ABI 430A automated peptide synthesizer with 0.2 mmole MBHA amide resin and DEPBT as coupling reagent. The following Boc amino acids were used: Ala, Arg(Tos), Asp(OcHx), Asn(Xan), Glu(OcHx), Gln(Xan), Leu, Lys(2-Cl—Z), Met, PLA, Ser(OBzl), Thr(OBzl), Trp(CHO), Tyr(2.6-di-Cl—Bzl) and Val except the glutamic acid at position 16 was incorporated with Boc-Glu(OFm)—OH, lysine at \nposition\n 20 was incorporated with Boc-Lys(Fmoc)-OH and lysine at \nposition\n 10 was incorporated with Boc-Lys(Alloc)-OH. After removal of Fm and Fmoc protecting groups at \npositions\n 16 and 20 with 20% piperidine in DMF, the peptidyl resin was treated with 300 mg (1 mmol)DEPBT in 10% DIEA/DMF for about 4 h to form the lactam bridge. This lactam-bridged peptidyl resin was treated a solution composed of 100 mg (0.4 equiv.)

The 3-tritylthiopropionic acid was then coupled by DEPBT to obtain the peptidyl resin with a sequence of: HO-PLA-Thr-Ser-Asp-Lys(COCH\n2\nCH\n2\nSH)-Ser-Lys-Tyr-Leu-Asp-Glu*-Arg-Arg-Ala-Lys*-Asp-Phe-Val-Gln-Trp-Leu-Met-Asp-Thr-NH\n2\n.

The peptide was purified by preparative HPLC, and analyzed by MS and analytical RP-HPLC. The purified peptide demonstrated a single peak in analytical RP-HPLC and the ESI-MS analysis yielded the desired mass of 3050.7 which corresponds with the calculated molecular weight of 3051.0 daltons of the peptide [PLA6, K10(CH2CH2SH), E16K20(lactam), D28]G(6-29) amide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo synthesize the cholesterol conjugated peptide [PLA6, K10(COCH2CH2S-Chol), E16K20(lactam), D28]G(6-29) amide, 10 mg (3.28 μM) of [PLA6, K10(COCH2CH2SH), E16K20(lactam), D28]G(6-29) amide was dissolved in 2 mL of 7 M urea buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). To this solution was added 10 mg (9 μM) of cholesterol reagent Br—Oxa\n12\n-Chol (see the structure below), at room temperature. The reaction was monitored by HPLC. After about 4 h, the reaction solution was purified directly by HPLC. The purified cholesterol conjugated peptide demonstrated a single peak in analytical chromatography and the ESI-MS analysis yielded the desired mass of 4074.13 which corresponds with the calculated molecular weight of 4073.0 of the cholesterol conjugated lactam-bridge peptide [PLA6, K10(COCH2CH2S-Chol), E16K20(lactam), D28]G(6-29) amide.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilar procedures were used to synthesize the other cholesterol conjugated and lactam-bridged peptides such as [PLA6, E16K20(lactam), D28, K30(COCH2CH2S-Chol)]G(6-30) amide and [PLA6, E16K20(lactam), D28, K40(COCH2CH2S-Chol)]G(6-40) amide reported in this patent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cholesterolylated peptides were tested for agonist activity at the GLP-1 receptor and antagonist activity at the glucagon receptor as essentially described in Example 13.

Description\n\n\n\n\nRELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\n \n \n \nThis patent application claims the benefit of priority of provisional patent application No. 61/276,875, filed Sep. 17, 2009 and provisional patent application No. 61/270,826, filed Jul. 14, 2009, the entire contents of each provisional application are incorporated by reference in their entirety.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides modified photoproteins, e.g., modified Clytin, having an increased affinity for calcium as well as an enhanced bioluminescence and their use as calcium indicators in reporter gene systems and in cell-based assays.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nSeveral photoproteins that have been reported to emit light upon reacting with Ca\n2+\n have been isolated from organisms to date, including Aequorin, Halistaurin, Obelin, Mnemiospin, Clytin and Berovin. In general, all of the aforementioned photoproteins are relatively small in size and are thought to contain a common organic substrate (coelenterazine) and molecular oxygen bound in the form of a complex.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAequorin has been the most widely studied Ca\n2+\n activated photoprotein, isolated from the hydroid \nAequorea victoria\n. In case, of Aequorin, the binding of Ca\n2+\n causes a conformational change in the protein, converting the protein to an enzyme which catalyzes the oxidation of coelenterazine by oxygen, with the emission of light (i.e., λmax=470 nm). Aequorin has been used for detecting calcium flux in cells, particularly, as mediated by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), e.g., as described in Stables et al. (Anal. Biochem., 252: 115-126 (1997)). Further, Aequorin-mediated luminescent calcium assays have been employed in high throughput screening for GPCRs, e.g., as described in Ungrin et al. (Anal. Biochem., 272: 34-42 (1999)). Additionally, Aequorin-expressing cells have also been used in drug screening assays, e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,872,538.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough, calcium-activated photoproteins such as, for example, Aequorin, are being used for detecting calcium flux stimulated by GPCRs, for example, and in drug screening, the affinity of Aequorin for calcium is rather low (i.e., only around 7 μM) relative to the cytosolic concentrations of calcium that are induced by receptors (e.g., in the 0.1 μM to 0.2 μM range). Further, although, mitochondrially targeted Aequorin appears to yield a better signal after GPCR simulation, the affinity for calcium is affected by the heterogeneity of mitochondrial calcium accumulation and generally lower amount of Aequorin expression in the mitochondria versus the cytosol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilarly, other calcium-activated photoproteins such as, for example, Obelin and Clytin, have also been reported to have lower affinity for calcium and/or low level of light emission.

Definitions\n\n\n \n \n \nIn order that the present disclosure may be more readily understood, certain terms are first defined. Additional definitions are set forth throughout the detailed description.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “photoprotein” or “Ca\n2+\n activated photoprotein,” as used interchangeably herein, refers to a protein which emits light upon binding to calcium. Photoproteins are generally isolated from marine coelenterates and emit visible light in the presence of calcium through an intramolecular reaction. The calcium binding sites of the known photoproteins are similar to those found in other Ca\n2+\n binding proteins such as, for example, Calmodulin, however, differ from other Ca\n2+\n proteins by a relatively high content of cysteine, histidine, tryptophan, proline and tyrosine residues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary photoproteins include, but are not limited to, Obelin, Clytin, Aequorin, Halistaurin, Mnemiospin and Berovin and generally do not include Luciferases. All these photoproteins are complexes of an apoprotein, an imidazopyrazine chromophore (coelenterazine) and oxygen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the present invention provides modified photoproteins. In a particular embodiment, the present invention relates to modified Clytin. Amino acid sequence alignment of photoproteins Clytin (SEQ ID NO:1), Aequorin (SEQ ID NO:2), Mitrocomin (SEQ ID NO:3) and Obelin (SEQ ID NO:4) are depicted in \nFIG. 1\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “modified photoprotein” or “Ca\n2+\n activated modified photoprotein,” as used interchangeably herein, refers to an amino acid sequence variant of a wild-type photoprotein (e.g., a variant of wt-Clytin, the amino acid sequence of wt-Clytin is set forth in SEQ ID NO:1), which exhibits an increased affinity for intracellular calcium and enhanced bioluminescence relative to that exhibited by wt-Clytin. In some embodiments, a modified photoprotein according to the present invention includes at least one amino acid modification in an helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain of wt-Clytin (e.g., EF hand III domain), where the modified photoprotein exhibits an increased affinity for intracellular calcium and enhanced bioluminescence relative to that exhibited by wt-Clytin. In some embodiments, a modified photoprotein comprises an amino acid sequence including at least the lysine residue at position 168 of SEQ ID NO:1 replaced with an amino acid other than a histidine, an arginine and a lysine, where the modified photoprotein exhibits an increased affinity for intracellular calcium and enhanced bioluminescence relative to a photoprotein comprising the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:1. In some embodiments, a modified photoprotein comprises an amino acid sequence including at least the lysine residue at position 168 of SEQ ID NO:1 replaced with an aspartic acid, where the photoprotein exhibits an increased affinity for intracellular calcium and enhanced bioluminescence relative to both a photoprotein comprising the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:1 and a photoprotein comprising the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn exemplary embodiments, a modified photoprotein according to the present invention comprises an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO:9 (K168D), SEQ ID NO:11 (K168E), SEQ ID NO:15 (K168G), SEQ ID NO:17 (K168N), SEQ ID NO:19 (K168Q), SEQ ID NO:21 (K168S), SEQ ID NO:23 (K168T), SEQ ID NO:25 (K168V) and SEQ ID NO:27 (K168Y). In some embodiments, modified photoproteins of the present invention further include a mitochondrial targeting signal sequence, e.g., a COX8 mitochondrial tag, the amino acid sequence of which is set forth in SEQ ID NO:8.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn EF hand domain is a type of a helix-turn-helix (HTH) structural domain found in a large family of calcium-binding proteins including the photoproteins encompassed by the present invention. It consists of two alpha helices positioned roughly perpendicular to one another and linked by a short loop region (usually about 12 amino acids) that usually binds calcium ions. The EF hand domain takes its name from traditional nomenclature used in describing the protein Parvalbumin, which contains three such motifs and is thought to be involved in muscle relaxation via its calcium-binding activity. EF hand domains also appear in each structural domain of the signaling protein Calmodulin and in the muscle protein Troponin-C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “HTH IV domain” or “EF hand III domain,” refers to the fourth of four helix-turn-helix domains (three of which are EF hand domains) and third of the three EF hand domains found in Clytin, which comprises amino acid residues 162 through 173 and includes the amino acid sequence DLDNSGKLDVDE (SEQ ID NO:31). The HTH IV domain (or the EF hand III domain) of Clytin reportedly binds to calcium at physiologically relevant concentrations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWithout wishing to be bound by theory, it is understood that amino acid sequence variants encompassed by the present invention may differ from the parent amino acid sequence from which they are derived, in the substitution, deletion and/or insertion of one or more amino acids anywhere within the parent amino acid sequence and including at least one amino acid residue substitution in at least one HTH domain (e.g., position 168 of Clytin which resides in the EF hand III domain), where the variants exhibit an increased affinity for calcium (e.g., an EC50 value of 500 nM or lower for intracellular calcium in HEK293T cells) and enhanced bioluminescence. In some embodiments, amino acid sequence variants will possess at least about 70%, or at least about 80%, or at least about 85%, or at least about 90%, or at least about 95%, or at least about 96%, or at least about 97%, or at least about 98%, or at least about 99% identity with the parent sequence (i.e., wt-Clytin set forth in SEQ ID NO:1), where such variants exhibit increased affinity for intracellular calcium and enhanced bioluminescence, and where such variants do not comprise the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:2 or variants thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “sequence identity” means that two nucleotide or amino acid sequences, when optimally aligned, such as by the programs GAP or BESTFIT using default gap weights, share at least 70% sequence identity, or at least 80% sequence identity, or at least 85% sequence identity, or at least 90% sequence identity, or at 95% sequence identity or more (e.g., 99% sequence identity or more). For sequence comparison, typically one sequence acts as a reference sequence (e.g., parent sequence), to which test sequences are compared. When using a sequence comparison algorithm, test and reference sequences are input into a computer, subsequence coordinates are designated, if necessary, and sequence algorithm program parameters are designated. The sequence comparison algorithm then calculates the percent sequence identity for the test sequence(s) relative to the reference sequence, based on the designated program parameters.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOptimal alignment of sequences for comparison can be conducted, e.g., by the local homology algorithm of Smith & Waterman, Adv. Appl. Math. 2:482 (1981), by the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman & Wunsch, J. Mol. Biol. 48:443 (1970), by the search for similarity method of Pearson & Lipman, Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA 85:2444 (1988), by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Dr., Madison, Wis.), or by visual inspection (see generally Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology). One example of algorithm that is suitable for determining percent sequence identity and sequence similarity is the BLAST algorithm, which is described in Altschul et al., J. Mol. Biol. 215:403 (1990). Software for performing BLAST analyses is publicly available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information (publicly accessible through the National Institutes of Health NCBI interne server). Typically, default program parameters can be used to perform the sequence comparison, although customized parameters can also be used. For amino acid sequences, the BLASTP program uses as defaults a wordlength (W) of 3, an expectation (E) of 10, and the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix (see Henikoff & Henikoff, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:10915 (1989)). Software for performing multiple sequence alignments with the MUSCLE (Multiple Sequence Comparison by Log Expectation) algorithm (Edgar, Nucl. Acids Res. 32: 1792 (2004)) is publicly available through the European Molecular Biology Laboratories via the European Bioinformatics Institute interne server.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, a modified photoprotein according to the present invention is based on the amino acid sequence of wt-Clytin (i.e., set forth in SEQ ID NO:1), where the modified photoprotein includes at least the lysine amino acid residue at position 168 replaced with an amino acid residue other than a histidine, an arginine and a lysine. In some embodiments, the lysine at position 168 of SEQ ID NO:1 is replaced with an amino acid selected from aspartic acid, glutamic acid, glycine, asparagine, serine, threonine, valine, tyrosine and glutamine, where the modified photoprotein exhibits an increased affinity for calcium (e.g., an EC50 value of 500 nM or lower in HEK293T cells) and enhanced bioluminescence relative to a wild type photoprotein (e.g., wt-Clytin and/or wt-Aequorin and/or Obelin). In a particular embodiment, a modified photoprotein according to the invention comprises an amino acid sequence comprising at least the lysine at position 168 replaced with an aspartic acid, where the modified photoprotein exhibits an increased affinity for intracellular calcium and enhanced bioluminescence relative to that exhibited by wt-Clytin and wt-Aequorin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a modified photoprotein according to the present invention comprises a mitochondrial targeting sequence (e.g., that set forth in SEQ ID NO: 8). In some embodiments, variants of Clytin including a mitochondrial targeting sequence are set forth in SEQ ID NO:10, SEQ ID NO:12, SEQ ID NO:16, SEQ ID NO:18; SEQ ID NO:20, SEQ ID NO:22, SEQ ID NO:24, SEQ ID NO:26 and SEQ ID NO:28.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable amino acids to replace lysine at position 168 of SEQ ID NO:1 include any naturally-occurring amino acid other than a histidine, an arginine and a lysine. In some embodiments, suitable amino acids to replace lysine at position 168 include one of a naturally occurring amino acid selected from an aspartic acid, a glutamic acid, an asparagine, a glycine, a serine, a threonine, a valine, a tyrosine and a glutamine. Non-naturally occurring amino acids and amino acid derivatives which are well known in the art could also be used to replace the lysine at position 168.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “bioluminescence,” “luminescence,” “bioluminescent” or “luminescent,” as used herein, relates to the ability of a modified photoprotein of the present invention to emit visible light upon binding to a divalent cation such as, for example, Ca\n2+\n. Bioluminescence reactions typically require three major components: a luciferin, a luciferase and molecular oxygen. However other components may also be required, including cations (e.g., Ca\n2+\n and Mg\n2+\n) and cofactors (e.g., ATP, NAD(P)H). Luciferases are enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of a substrate, luciferin, and produce an unstable intermediate. Light is emitted when the unstable intermediate decays to its ground state, generating oxyluciferin. Bioluminescence can be measured using one or more techniques known in the art and those described herein, including, but not limited to, use of luminometers such as, e.g., Victor2 and Lumilux (PERKINELMER), FLIPR and FlexStation (MOLECULAR DEVICES/MDS ANALYTICAL), Mithras (BERTHOLD TECHNOLOGIES), FDSS (HAMAMATSU PHOTONICS) and PHERAstar (BMG LABTECH).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “enhanced bioluminescence,” as used herein, refers to any increase in bioluminescence of a modified photoprotein relative to a wt-photoprotein in the presence of Ca\n2+\n. For example, in an exemplary embodiment, bioluminescence of a modified photoprotein such as a modified Clyin (e.g., Clytin having an amino acid modification at position 168) described herein is enhanced relative to the bioluminescence of wt-Clytin and/or wt-Aequorin, as measured either in living cells stimulated with a substance that increases intracellular Ca\n2+\n, or in permeabilized cells exposed to solutions containing varying concentrations of Ca\n2+\n. The bioluminescence of a modified photoprotein in the presence of calcium may be increased by about 1.5%, or about 2%, or about 3%, or about 4%, or about 5%, or about 10%, or about 20%, or about 30%, or about 40%, or about 50%, or about 60%, or about 70%, or about 80%, or about 90%, or greater than 90%, relative to that of a wt-photoprotein (e.g., wt-Clytin and/or wt-Aequorin and/or Obelin). In some embodiments, the bioluminescence of a modified photoprotein in the presence of calcium is increased by about 1.5-fold, or 2-fold, or 5-fold, or 10-fold, or 15-fold, or 20-fold, or 25-fold, or 30-fold, or 35-fold, or 40-fold, of 45-fold, or 50-fold, or 55-fold, or 60-fold, or 65-fold, or 70-fold, or 75-fold, or 80-fold, or 85-fold, of 90-fold, or greater than 90-fold, relative to a wt-photoprotein (e.g., wt-Clytin and/or wt-Aequorin).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is well known that intracellular calcium acts as a modulator of many important physiological responses and pathophysiological conditions. In most of these instances, extracellular signals are received through receptors (e.g., GPCRs and ion channels) and converted to changes in intracellular Ca\n2+\n concentration, which results in Ca\n2+\n sensitive changes inside the cell, including but not limited to, modulation of Ca\n2+\n sensitive kinases, proteases and transcription factors. Accordingly, measurement of intracellular Ca\n2+\n concentration is essential in understanding intracellular processes and modulation of cellular proteins. Furthermore, the central role of Ca\n2+\n in intracellular signaling makes it a very attractive reporter in drug discovery. Many drug target classes important for the pharmaceutical industry including, but not limited to, G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), ion channels and transporters trigger a Ca\n2+\n mobilization upon activation, referred to as “calcium flux.”\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChanges in intracellular Ca\n2+\n concentration or calcium flux can be detected using fluorescent dyes (e.g., fura-2 and indo-1) (See, e.g., R. Y. Tsien, Nature 290, 527 (1981); R. Y. Tsien, T. Pozzan, T. J. Rink, J. Cell. Biol. 94, 325 (1982)), the Ca\n2+\n sensitive bioluminescent jellyfish protein, Aequorin, (e.g., E. B. Ridgway and C. C. Ashley, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 29, 229 (1967)) or Ca\n2+\n sensitive microelectrodes (e.g., C. C. Ashley and A. K. Campbell, Eds., Detection and Measurement of Free Ca\n2+\n in cells (Elsevier, North-Holland, Amsterdam, 1979)). In an exemplary experiment, intracellular calcium concentration can be measured by adding coelenterazine cofactor to mammalian cells expressing a photoprotein and detecting photon emission, which is indicative of intracellular calcium concentration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides modified photoproteins which exhibit an increased affinity for intracellular Ca\n2+\n relative to the known photoproteins. Accordingly, the modified photoproteins of the present invention are more sensitive to changes in intracellular Ca\n2+\n concentration and, accordingly, are superior to the known proteins and reagents for detecting calcium flux. Because the modified photoproteins exhibit a greater sensitivity to changes in intracellular calcium concentration than wild-type photoproteins, the modified photoproteins are extremely valuable to use in assays for screening for modulators of GPCR or ion channel activity, especially screening for modulators which might result only in a small change in intracellular calcium concentration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “increased affinity for intracellular calcium,” as used herein, refers to any increase in the affinity of a modified photoprotein according to the present invention (e.g., Clytin set forth in SEQ ID NO:1 having an amino acid substitution at position 168) for intracellular calcium relative to a wild-type photoprotein (e.g., wt-Aequorin and/or wt-Clytin and/or wt-Obelin). For example, affinity for intracellular calcium may be increased by about 1.5%, or about 2%, or about 3%, or about 3.5%, or about 4%, or about 5%, or about 10%, or about 20%, or about 30%, or about 40%, or about 50%, or about 60%, or about 70%, or about 80%, or about 90%, or about 95%, or about 96%, or about 97%, or about 98%, or about 99% or more, relative to a wild-type photoprotein (e.g., wt-Clytin and/or wt-Aequorin and wt-Obelin). In some embodiments, increased affinity for intracellular calcium refers to a decrease in the EC50 value of a modified photoprotein for intracellular calcium relative to a wild-type photoprotein (e.g., wt-Clytin and/or wt-Aequorin and/or wt-Obelin). Affinity of a photoprotein for calcium can be measured using well known techniques and assays in the art, including but not limited to, the ones described herein. In an exemplary assay, described in the Examples herein, calcium affinity is measured by loading photoprotein-expressing cells with coelenterazine followed by measurement of bioluminescence emitted by the cells upon the addition of varying concentrations of calcium to the cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “EC50 value for intracellular calcium,” as used herein, refers to the concentration of free calcium that elicits a luminescent signal (i.e., bioluminescence) to a level which is 50% of the signal observed for the luminescent signal in the presence of a saturating amount of calcium (i.e., a concentration of calcium above which further increases in calcium concentration do not produce further increases in luminescent signal). The EC50 value for intracellular calcium, as used herein, is a measure of the affinity of a modified photoprotein for intracellular calcium. The EC50 value can be measured using one or more assays known in the art and those described herein, e.g., in the Examples section infra. In an exemplary embodiment, a modified photoprotein according to the invention has an EC50 value of 500 nM or lower for intracellular calcium in HEK293T cells, where the modified photoprotein is not wt-Aequorin or a variant thereof (e.g., does not comprise an amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:2, or a variant thereof).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the EC50 value for intracellular calcium of a modified photoprotein is decreased by about 1.5%, or 2%, or 3%, or 4%, or 5%, or 10%, or 15%, or 20%, or 25%, or 30%, or 50%, or 60%, or 70%, or 80%, or 90%, or 95%, or greater than 95%, relative to the EC50 value of a wild-type photoprotein (e.g., wt-Clytin and/or wt-Aequorin and/or wt-Obelin). In some embodiments, the EC50 value of a modified photoprotein of the present invention is decreased by about 10 nM, or 20 nM, or nM, or 40 nM, or 50 nM, or 60 nM, or 70 nM, or 80 nM, or 90 nM, or 100 nM, or 110 nM, or 120 nM, or 130 nM, or 140 nM, or 150 nM, or 160 nM, or 170 nM, or 180 nM, or 190 nM, or 200 nM, or 210 nM, or 220 nM, or 230 nM, or 240 nM, or 250 nM, or 260 nM, or 270 nM, or 280 nM, or 290 nM, or 300 nM, or 310 nM, or 320 nM, or 330 nM, or 340 nM, or 350 nM, or 360 nM, or 370 nM, or 380 nM, or 390 nM, or 400 nM, or 410 nM, or 420 nM, or 430 nM, or 440 nM, or 450 nM, or decreased by more than 450 nM, relative to the EC50 value of a wild-type photoprotein (e.g., wt-Clytin and/or wt-Aequorin and/or wt-Obelin).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “GPCR” refers to G-protein coupled receptors, which are involved in various cellular signal transduction pathways. As one of the largest and most diverse protein families in nature, the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily plays important roles in a variety of biological and pathological processes such as development and proliferation, neuromodulation, angiogenesis, metabolic disorders, inflammation, and viral infection. It is one of the most targeted protein families in pharmaceutical research today. All members of the GPCR superfamily share a similar seven transmembrane domain, however, can be grouped into classes on the basis of shared sequence motifs. For example, Class A includes Rhodopsin-like GPCRs, Class B includes Secretin-like GPCRs, Class C includes Metabotropic glutamate/pheromone GPCRs, Class D includes fungal pheromone GPCRs, and Class E includes cAMP GPCRs. Additional GPCRs can be classified as Frizzled/Smoothened GPCRs, Vomeronasal GPCRs and some that remain unclassified.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTable I below provides an enumeration of the nucleic acid and amino acid sequences discussed herein along with the corresponding Sequence Identifiers (SEQ ID NOs).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE I\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEQ ID NO\n\n\nBrief Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nWild type Clytin (wt-Clytin) amino acid sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nWild-type Aequorin (wt-Aequorin) amino acid sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nWild-type Mitrocomin (wt-Mitrocomin) amino acid sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nWild-type Obelin (wt-Obelin) amino acid sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nMitochondrial Wild-type Clytin (mt-Clytin) amino acid sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nMitochondrial Wild-type Aequorin (mt-Aequorin) amino acid sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nMitochondrial Wild-type Obelin (mt-Obelin) amino acid sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nCOX 8 mitochondrial tag amino acid sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nK168D modified Clytin amino acid sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nMitochondrial K168D modified Clytin amino acid sequence (mt-Clytin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nK168D)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\nK168E modified Clytin amino acid sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\nMitochondrial K168E modified Clytin amino acid sequence (mt-Clytin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nK168E)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\nK168H modified Clytin amino acid sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\nMitochondrial K168H modified Clytin amino acid sequence (mt-Clytin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nK168H)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15\n\n\nK168G modified Clytin amino acid sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16\n\n\nMitochondrial K168G modified Clytin amino acid sequence (mt-Clytin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nK168G)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17\n\n\nK168N modified Clytin amino acid sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\nMitochondrial K168N modified Clytin amino acid sequence (mt-Clytin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nK168N)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19\n\n\nK168Q modified Clytin amino acid sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\nMitochondrial K168Q modified Clytin amino acid sequence (mt-Clytin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nK168Q)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21\n\n\nK168S modified Clytin amino acid sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22\n\n\nMitochondrial K168S modified Clytin amino acid sequence (mt-Clytin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nK168S)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n23\n\n\nK168T modified Clytin amino acid sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24\n\n\nMitochondrial K168T modified Clytin amino acid sequence (mt-Clytin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nK168T)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25\n\n\nK168V modified Clytin amino acid sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26\n\n\nMitochondrial K168V modified Clytin amino acid sequence (mt-Clytin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nK168V)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27\n\n\nK168Y modified Clytin amino acid sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n28\n\n\nMitochondrial K168Y modified Clytin amino acid sequence (mt-Clytin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nK168Y)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n29\n\n\nK168R modified Clytin amino acid sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30\n\n\nMitochondrial K168R modified Clytin amino acid sequence (mt-Clytin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nK168R)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n31\n\n\nWild-type Clytin EF hand III domain amino acid sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n32\n\n\nWild type Clytin (wt-Clytin) nucleic acid sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n33\n\n\nWild-type Aequorin (wt-Aequorin) nucleic acid sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34\n\n\nK168D modified Clytin nucleic acid sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n35\n\n\nMitochondrial Wild-type Clytin (mt-Clytin) nucleic acid sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n36\n\n\nMitochondrial Wild-type Aequorin (mt-Aequorin) nucleic acid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nsequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n37\n\n\nMitochondrial K168D modified Clytin (mt-Clytin K168D) nucleic acid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nsequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n38\n\n\nK168D sense primer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n39\n\n\nK168D antisense primer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n40\n\n\nK168E sense primer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n41\n\n\nK168E antisense primer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n42\n\n\nK168G sense primer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n43\n\n\nK168G antisense primer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n44\n\n\nK168N sense primer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n45\n\n\nK168N antisense primer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n46\n\n\nK168Q sense primer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n47\n\n\nK168Q antisense primer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n48\n\n\nK168V sense primer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n49\n\n\nK168V antisense primer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50\n\n\nK168S sense primer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n51\n\n\nK168S antisense primer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n52\n\n\nK168T sense primer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n53\n\n\nK168T antisense primer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n54\n\n\nK168Y sense primer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n55\n\n\nK168Y antisense primer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n56\n\n\nK168R sense primer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n57\n\n\nK168R antisense primer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n58\n\n\nK168H sense primer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n59\n\n\nK168H antisense primer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n60\n\n\nH1 forward PCR primer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n61\n\n\nH1 reverse PCR primer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nII.

Four of the photoproteins, Aequorin, Mitrocomin, Clytin and Obelin, are from class Hydrozoa, phylum Cnidaria and are relatively small in size (21.4-27.5 kDa).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSince coelenterazine is the common luminescent chromophore contained in the photoproteins Aequorin, Mitrocomin, Clytin and Obelin, the light-emitting reaction is thought to be the same in these four photoproteins (Tsuji et al., Photochem. Photobiol., 62: 657-661 (1995)). Conventional nomenclature defines these photoprotein designations as the polypeptide complexed with the chromophore, whereas the photoprotein lacking the chromophore is designated an apoprotein (e.g., apoaequorin, apoclytin, apoobelin and apomitrocomin). In addition, the Ca\n2+\n binding photoproteins appear to retain a tightly bound O\n2 \nmolecule. Upon binding of calcium ions to the photoproteins, the protein catalyzes oxidation of coelenterazine and O\n2 \nto coelenteramide, CO\n2\n, and photons with emission maxima at 470 nm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDue to its low toxicity, Aequorin has been used as an intracellular calcium indicator since the early 1960s. Original use of Aequorin employed biochemically purified enzyme microinjected into the cells of interest (Blinks et al. \nPharmacol Rev., \n28: 1-93 (1976)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMolecular cloning of apoaequorin indicated that it consists of 189 amino acid residues in a single polypeptide chain and contains 4 HTH domains, 3 of which have amino acid sequences characteristic of EF hand Ca\n2+\n binding sites (Inouye et al., Proc. Natl. Acad Sci USA, 82: 3154-3158 (1985)). Cloning of the gene for Aequorin opened the door for recombinant expression in cells or even entire organisms. Expression of recombinant aequorin cDNA tagged with subcellular targeting signal sequences transports Aequorin to specific subcellular compartments, thereby permitting measurement of calcium concentrations specifically within those compartments (Rizzuto et al., Methods Cell Biol. 40: 339-358 (1994)). Such studies with Aequorin selectively targeted to mitochondria have revealed that when Ca\n2+\n is released from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stores, mitochondria accumulate calcium to concentrations exceeding those in the cytosol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMany GPCRs signal by stimulating calcium release from ER stores via inositol triphosphate. Accordingly, Aequorin has been utilized to measure GPCR-mediated calcium flux. The ease of measuring intracellular calcium flux with mitochondrially targeted Aequorin has permitted development of high throughput assays for modulators of a wide variety of GPCRs (Stables et al., Anal. Biochem., 252: 115-126 (1997); Ungrin et al., Anal. Biochem., 272: 34-42 (1999)). In addition, Aequorin has been utilized for high throughput analysis of calcium ion channel function (Walstab et al., Anal. Biochem., 368: 185-192 (2007)).\n\n\n \nIII. Structure of Clytin\n\n\n \n \n \nClytin, another photoprotein also known as Phialidin, was cloned from the hydroid \nClytia gregarium \n(formerly known as \nPhialidium gregarium\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cloning and sequence analysis of the cDNA for Ca\n2+\n activated Clytin (also referred to as Clytin-I) was first described by Inouye et al. (FEBS, 315, 343-346 (1993)). Clytin consists of 189 amino acid residues with about 64% amino acid sequence identity with Aequorin, and includes 4 HTH domains, 3 of which are EF-hand domains that bind Ca\n2+\n. The amino acid sequence of wild-type Clytin is set forth in SEQ ID NO:1. Regeneration of purified apoclytin with colenterazine, O\n2\n, 2-mercaptoethanol and EDTA leads to Clytin, just as in case of regeneration of apoaequorin into Aequorin. The bioluminescence reaction for Clytin is thought to be similar to that of Aequorin, as it has been reported that addition of calcium to the reconstituted Clytin results in the emission of light with a wavelength maximum of 470 nm (Inouye and Sahara, Protein Expr. Purif., 53: 384-389 (2007)). However, Clytin displays a lower affinity for calcium than Aequorin. A second isotype of Clytin, termed Clytin-II, has been recently cloned from \nClytia gregarium \n(Inouye, J. Biochem., 143: 711-717 (2008)). Clytin-I and Clytin-II share 88.4% amino acid identity, a similar affinity for calcium, and similar total quantum yield with respect to luminescence, however, they differ kinetically with Clytin-II displaying a 4.5-fold higher peak luminescence than both Clytin-I and Aequorin.\n\n\n \nIV. Generation of Modified Photoproteins\n\n\n \n \n \nThe modified photoproteins of the present invention can be made using any suitable methods known in the art. For example, standard techniques for site-directed mutagenesis of nucleic acids may be used such as those described, for example, in the laboratory manual entitled Molecular Cloning by Sambrook, Fritsch and Maniatis. Additionally, standard molecular biology techniques involving polymerase chain reaction (PCR) mutagenesis may be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the modified photoproteins are generated using standard genetic engineering techniques. For example, a nucleic acid molecule encoding a wt-photoprotein or a portion thereof can be cloned into a suitable vector for expression in an appropriate host cell. Suitable expression vectors are well known in the art and typically include the necessary elements for the transcription and translation of the modified photoprotein coding sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModified photoproteins described herein may also be synthesized chemically from amino acid precursors using methods well known in the art, including solid phase peptide synthetic methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExpression of modified photoproteins can be accomplished in cells from eukaryotic hosts such as yeasts, insects or mammals, or in prokaryotic host cells, e.g., bacteria such as \nE. coli. \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, modified photoproteins include a signal sequence for targeting such photoproteins to a particular compartment within a cell, for example, in order to detect calcium flux in a particular cellular compartment. In a particular embodiment, the modified photoproteins are specifically targeted to the mitochondria, e.g., by including a mitochondrial signaling sequence (e.g., COX8 signal sequence as described herein) at the amino-terminus of the modified protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, modified photoproteins include a tag or fusion, either at the N-terminus, C-terminus, or internal region, for detection and/or purification of the modified photoprotein. Such sequence tags include, but are not limited to, hemagglutinin (HA) tag, FLAG tag, myc tag, hexahistidine tag (SEQ ID NO: 62) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, modified photoproteins may be expressed on the surface of a bacteriophage such that each phage contains a DNA sequence that codes for an individual modified photoprotein displayed on the phage surface. In this approach, a library of modified photoproteins are made by synthesizing random or semi random oligonucleotides at selected positions in a photoprotein sequence chosen to generate a variety of amino acids at these positions. The encoding DNA is inserted into an appropriate phage vector, packaged into a phage particle and used to infect a suitable bacterial host. Each of the sequences is thus cloned in one phage vector and the modified photoprotein of interest (e.g., having a mutation at position 168 in case of clytin and having increased affinity for Ca2+) can be isolated and the nucleotide sequence encoding selected modified photoproteins determined by nucleotide sequencing.\n\n\n \nV. Transfecting a Nucleic Acid Molecule Encoding a Modified Photoprotein into a Suitable Cell\n\n\n \n \n \nA variety of methods known to those skilled in the art are available for transfecting nucleic acid molecules into suitable cells. For example, calcium phosphate, cationic lipids, and cationic polymers (such as polyethyleneimine) may be complexed with nucleic acid molecules and applied to cells, which subsequently internalize the complex and transcribe and/or translate the nucleic acid molecules. Alternatively, electrophysical methods such as electroporation, biolistic gene transfer, and microinjection may be used to generate transient openings within the cellular plasma membrane to allow diffusion of nucleic acid molecules across the plasma membrane. Viral vectors such as lentivirus, baculovirus, adenovirus, and adeno-associated virus may also be engineered to include a recombinant gene, and infection of the recombinant virus to receptive cells results in expression of the encoded recombinant protein. In theory, any mammalian cell line may be transfected with a nucleic acid molecule encoding a modified photoprotein encompassed by the present invention. Exemplary cell lines include, but are not limited to, CHO, COS, HEK293, U-2OS, HeLa, and NIH3T3. Such transfected cell lines may be used in assays, e.g., 24 to 72 hours following transfection. Alternatively, if the nucleic acid molecule of interest has been inserted into a plasmid also containing a gene for a selectable marker, the cells may be subjected to selection with a compound that is toxic to untransfected cells, but that is inactivated by the coexpressed selectable marker. Exemplary selection agents include geneticin, hygromycin, zeocin, and puromycin.\n\n\n \nVI. Measuring the Affinity of the Modified Photoprotein for Intracellular Calcium\n\n\n \n \n \nThe affinity of a calcium-activated photoprotein for intracellular calcium may be determined by several methods known to those skilled in the art, including those described herein. Generally, each method involves the use of solutions containing defined concentrations of calcium in the presence of calcium-binding buffers, such as EGTA or EDTA, that have known affinities for calcium. Thus, the effective concentration of free calcium in such buffered solutions can be readily calculated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe photoproteins may be expressed in bacteria such as \nE. coli \nand purified and subsequently complexed with the substrate coelenterazine. The photoproteins may also be expressed in mammalian cells and cellular lysates prepared from the cells and subsequently incubated with coelenterazine. Alternatively, cells expressing the photoproteins may be loaded with coelenterazine, then permeabilized by a detergent such as Triton X-100 or digitonin. In each case, the photoprotein preparation is exposed to the buffered calcium solution in a luminometer designed to quantify the emission of photons generated by the oxidation of coelenterazine.\n\n\n \nVII. Measuring GPCR Mediated or Ion Channel Mediated Bioluminescence with the Modified Photoprotein\n\n\n \n \n \nModified photoproteins may be used to measure GPCR activity or ion channel activity in intact, live cells in a bioluminescence assay. In an exemplary experiment, cells are transfected with a nucleic acid molecule encoding a GPCR or an ion channel and another nucleic acid molecule encoding an apophotoprotein. Alternatively, cells expressing endogenous GPCR or endogenous ion channel may be used, which are transfected with a nucleic acid molecule encoding an apophotoprotein. The transfected cells are maintained in media for a period of time to allow expression of the encoded recombinant proteins (typically 24-72 hours). Alternatively, the transfected cells are treated with one or more selective agents, typically for 1-3 weeks, to enrich for cells containing a stably integrated gene or genes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe live transfected cells are incubated with the chromophore coelenterazine, which can either be in native form or in a chemically modified form. Coelenterazine readily traverses the plasma membranes and enters the cell to complex with the apophotoprotein. In case of GPCRs, cells containing the reconstituted photoprotein are then exposed to a ligand for the GPCR, and luminescence is quantified with a luminometer.\n\n\n \nVIII: Screening Methods for Identifying Modulators of GPCR Activity\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention also provides methods of screening for modulators, e.g., activators, inhibitors, stimulators, enhancers, agonists, and antagonists, of GPCR activity. For example, the modified photoproteins can be used for identifying modulators of GPCR activity by detecting calcium flux in the presence of a modulator.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStimulation of cytosolic free calcium concentrations is a primary signal transduction pathway for many GPCRs. Typically, binding of an agonist to certain GPCRs elicits a conformational change that activates heterotrimeric G proteins of the Gq/11 class. The activated GTP-bound form of the alpha subunit of Gq activates the enzyme phospholipase c, which in turn, catalyzes the cleavage of membrane bound lipid phosphatidylinositol. This cleavage reaction generates diacylglycerol, which remains associated with the lipid bilayer, and inositol triphosphate, which is released into the cytosol. Inositol triphosphate binds and activates a calcium channel on the endoplamsic reticulum (ER) to mobilize calcium from stores in the ER into the cytosol. Such GPCR-mediated changes in cytosolic free calcium concentrations (i.e., calcium flux) lead to a number of biologically important downstream responses, including alterations in cellular phosphorylation and transcription. Subsequently, calcium from the cytosol accumulates in mitochondria. Additionally, it has been reported that direct transfer of calcium from the ER to the mitochondria may occur.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral methods for detecting and quantifying changes in cytosolic and mitochondrial free calcium have been developed. For example, fluorescent dyes have been developed that change either the fluorescence intensity, or the emission or excitation maximum wavelength, upon binding of calcium. Such dyes may be applied to cells to accumulate in the cytosol. Changes in cytosolic calcium concentrations result in changes in fluorescence intensity or wavelength maxima that may be quantified by use of fluorometric detectors. In addition, calcium-activated photoproteins such as Aequorin, Clytin and Obelin may be used to monitor changes in intracellular calcium. Such photoproteins have an advantage in that they may be fused with sequences that direct them to different organelles, such that calcium concentrations in various cellular compartments may be measured.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDue to the simple and sensitive methods available for monitoring changes in calcium concentrations within cellular compartments, screening for modulators of GPCR activity often utilizes such methods. Typically, a cell line expressing an endogenous or recombinant GPCR is loaded with a calcium-sensitive dye such as Fluo-4 in 96- or 384-well plates. A fluorometric plate reader with liquid handling capability simultaneously quantifies fluorescence as the compounds of interest are added to the plate. A second addition of a known agonist may be added in order to determine whether the compound in the first addition is an antagonist and inhibits the activity of the known agonist. Such screens are capable of analyzing nearly 100 plates per day per device, or up to 40,000 compounds. Such high throughput screens have been and currently are commonly used to discover novel compounds interacting with such exemplary GPCRs as histamine receptors (H\n1\n-H\n4\n), 5-HT receptors (5-HT\n1A\n, 5-HT\n1B\n, 5-HT\n1D\n, 5-HT\n2A\n, 5-HT\n2B\n, 5-HT\n2C\n, 5-HT\n4\n, 5-HT\n6 \nand 5-HT\n7\n), dopamine receptors (D\n1\n-D\n5\n), adrenoceptors (α1A, α1B, α1D, α2A, α2B, α2C, β1, β2, β3), glucagon-like peptide receptors (GLP-1 receptor), opioid receptors (δ, κ, μ).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, screening efforts performed with fluorescent calcium assays have several limitations. For example, intrinsically fluorescent compounds may interfere with the assay, or the signal to background ratio is not sufficient to miniaturize to a 1536 well format, and a relatively high proportion of false positives is observed. Luminescent calcium assays performed with cells expressing the GPCR of interest with Aequorin have been demonstrated to overcome some of these limitations, resulting in enhanced sensitivity and higher throughput (Gilchrist et al., J. Biomol. Screen., 13: 486-493 (2008)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis invention is further illustrated by the following examples which should not be construed as limiting. The contents of all references, patents and published patent applications cited throughout this application, as well as the Figures, are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nGeneration of Clytin Variants\n\n\n \n \n \nVersions of Clytin were generated which were either unmodified for cytosolic expression or contained a mitochondrial targeting sequence. In an exemplary experiment, the cDNAs encoding unmodified wild-type clytin (referred to as cyto-clytin-wt) and clytin with a COX8 mitochondrial leader sequence (referred to as mt-clytin-wt) were chemically synthesized by GenScript. The cDNAs were subsequently subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1, under the control of a CMV promoter. (INVITROGEN). Mutations including a lysine to aspartic acid mutation at position 168 (K168D) were introduced into the clytin cDNAs by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit (STRATAGENE).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe codon AAA encoding the lysine at position 168 in Clytin was changed to one of aspartic acid, glutamic acid, asparagine, glycine, glutamine, valine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, arginine and histidine. The primers used for making these modifications are summarized in Table I supra.\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\nMeasurement of Calcium Affinities of Wild-Type Clytin, Modified Clytin K168D and Wild-Type Aequorin\n\n\n \n \n \nFollowing the generation of modified forms of Clytin, the various variants were compared with wt-Aequorin for their affinity for intracellular calcium in transient transfection assays using co-transfection with the H1 histamine receptor (Genbank Accession No. NM\n—\n000861, obtained by PCR using H1-specific primers from a human brain cDNA library, \nforward primer\n 5′-GCCGCCACCATGAGCCTCCCCA ATTCCTC-3′ (SEQ ID NO:60), \nreverse primer\n 5′-TCATCAGGAGCGAATATGCAG AATTCTC-3′ (SEQ ID NO:61).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an exemplary experiment, HEK293T cells (ATCC-CRL-11268) were transiently co-transfected with 2 μgs of each of pcDNA3.1-H1 (containing the cDNA encoding the H1 histamine receptor) and pcDNA3.1 containing the cDNAs encoding wild type mitochondrial Clytin (referred to as mt-Clytin), modified mitochondrial Clytin having a lysine to aspartic acid mutation at position 168 (referred to as mt-Clytin K168D), modified mitochondrial Clytin having a lysine to glutamic acid mutation at position 168 (referred to as mt-Clytin K168E), wild-type mitochondrial Obelin (referred to as mt-Obelin) or wild type mitochondrial Aequorin (referred to as mt-Aequorin) using the Targefect-293 reagent (TARGETING SYSTEMS). 48 hours later, the cells were detached using Accutase (MILLIPORE), centrifuged, and resuspended in 5 coelenterazine in FreeStyle293 media (INVITROGEN), for incubation for 3-4 hours at room temperature in the dark. After incubation, the cells were centrifuged and resuspended in HBSS/HEPES buffer without Ca\n2+\n at a density of 1×10\n6 \ncells/ml. Next, 100 μl/well of cell suspension for each transfection were added by the use of a Victor2 luminometer plate reader (WALLAC, PERKINELMER), to a 96-well plate containing 50 μL/well Triton X-100 in MOPS/KCl buffer containing 10 mM EGTA and a series of Ca\n2+\n concentrations, such that free calcium concentrations ranged from 17 nM to 39.6 μM, followed by for measurement of total bioluminescence at 20 seconds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results of one such experiment are demonstrated in \nFIG. 2\n. As shown in \nFIG. 2\n, the modified mitochondrial Clytin having a K168D mutation (mt-Clytin K168D) had a very high affinity for Ca\n2+\n, i.e., an EC50 value of 129 nM. Whereas, the affinities of mt-Clytin and mt-Aequorin were found to be in the range previously reported, i.e., mt-Aequorin exhibited an EC50 value of 269 nM and mt-Clytin exhibited an EC50 value of 1348 nM. The modified mitochondrial Clytin having a K168E mutation also exhibited a relatively high affinity for calcium, i.e., an EC50 value of 173 nM.\n\n\n \nExample 3\n\n\nComparison of GPCR-Mediated Luminescence Exhibited by Various Photoprotein Variants\n\n\n \n \n \nIn another experiment, the ability of the various photoproteins to detect calcium flux in live cells was assessed by adding varying concentrations of histamine to cells in order to activate the H1 histamine receptor followed by measurement of bioluminescence of the various photoproteins. U-2OS cells were transfected with a cDNA encoding H1 histamine receptor along with a cDNA encoding either a wild-type photoprotein or a modified photoprotein according to the invention, as described above in Example 2, except that Lipofectamine-2000 (INVITROGEN) was used as the transfection reagent. On the second day, the cells were trypsinized, counted, and plated in a white tissue-culture treated 96-well plate (COSTAR) at a density of about 50,000 cells/well in growth media consisting of DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, non-essential amino acids, HEPES and penicillin/streptomycin. On the third day, the medium was removed and cells were washed once with 200 μl/well of HBSS/HEPES (containing Ca\n2+\n). Cells were subsequently incubated with 5 μM coelenterazine in HBSS/HEPES (containing Ca\n2+\n) in a volume of 200 μl/well, for 3-4 hours at room temperature in the dark. After incubation, the coelenterazine solution was removed and cells were washed and replaced with HBSS/HEPES buffer containing both Ca\n2+\n and Mg\n2+\n. 50 μl/well of histamine at varying concentrations in HBSS/HEPES containing both Ca\n2+\n and Mg\n2+\n was added to the cells and total bioluminescence was measured at 20 seconds using a Victor2 luminometer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results of one such exemplary experiment are depicted in the graph in \nFIG. 3\n. As shown in the graph, the cytosolic Clytin K169D exhibited a much higher luminescence than the other forms of Clytin and Aequorin tested in the experiment.\n\n\n \nExample 4\n\n\nComparison of GPCR-Mediated Versus Total Luminescence Mediated by Various Photoprotein Variants\n\n\n \n \n \nIn a subsequent experiment, GPCR-mediated bioluminescence versus the total bioluminescence exhibited by various photoproteins was compared, as another measure of the effectiveness of a calcium-activated photoprotein. In an exemplary experiment, U-2OS cells were transfected, plated and loaded with coelenterazine as described in Example 3. Luminescence induced by buffer alone or by 10 μM histamine was measured also as described in Example 3. Additionally, luminescence induced by addition of Triton X-100 in the presence of 1 mM calcium was also determined in order to assess the total amount of active photoprotein detectable using saturating calcium concentrations in cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results of one such experiment are summarized in the bar graph in \nFIG. 4\n. As demonstrated in \nFIG. 4\n, both the mitochondrial and cytosolic forms of modified Clytin K168D exhibited a GPCR-mediated signal which was close to 100% of the total signal. Whereas, the mitochondrial and cytosolic forms of Aequorin only yielded about 70% and 30% respectively, of the total signal and the mitochondrial and cytosolic forms of wild type Clytin yielded about 30% and 3%, respectively, of the total signal.\n\n\n \nExample 5\n\n\nComparison of Luminescence Exhibited by Various Photoprotein Variants, Induced by a GPCR Coupled to an Exogenous Chimeric G Protein\n\n\n \n \n \nIn another experiment, HEK293T cells were transiently co-transfected with plasmids containing cDNAs encoding the GIP Receptor (Genbank. Accession No. NM\n—\n000164; obtained from OPEN BIOSYSTEMS), a promiscuous G protein alpha subunit, and a panel of photoproteins, including mitochondrially targeted wild-type Clytin (wt-Clytin), 11 modified versions of mitochondrially targeted Clytin having an amino acid substitution at position 168 of SEQ ID NO:1 (SEQ ID NOs:10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28 and 30), cytosolic wild-type Clytin (SEQ ID NO:1), 2 modified versions of cytosolic Clytin having an amino acid substitution at position 168 of SEQ ID NO:1 (SEQ ID NOs:9 and 11), mitochondrially targeted and cytosolic wild-type Aequorin (SEQ ID NOs:6 and 2, respectively), and mitochondrially targeted and Cytosolic wild-type Obelin (SEQ ID NOs: 7 and 4, respectively). The GIP receptor ordinarily couples to the Gs class of G proteins to stimulate the cAMP pathway, and does not couple with Gq to activate calcium flux. However, coexpression of GIP receptor with a chimeric G protein containing sequences from Gαs and Gαq enable the GIP receptor to stimulate calcium flux.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cells were aliquoted at 100,000 cells/well in a 96-well plate, and subsequently assayed for GPCR mediated bioluminescence, induced by GIP ligand (10\n−11 \nto 10\n−6 \nM), as well as the total signal determined by addition of 1% Triton X-100 in the presence of 1 mM Ca\n2+\n. The results of the dose response curve to varying concentrations of GIP with a subset of the photoproteins are summarized in \nFIG. 5\n. Cytosolic and mitochondrial Clytin K168D display significantly higher signal intensities than any of the wild-type photoproteins. These data demonstrate that Clytin K168D allows enhanced sensitivity in analysis of GPCRs with non-native coupling to the calcium pathway.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results obtained with the entire photoprotein panel are summarized below in Table II. The % GPCR/total indicates the signal induced by maximal GIP (1 μM) as a percentage of the signal induced by Triton X-100 in the presence of 1 mM Ca\n2+\n. Signal to background ratio was calculated as the signal induced by maximal GIP (1 μM) divided by the signal induced by buffer alone. The EC50 value for calcium was determined as described above for \nFIG. 2\n for mitochondrially targeted photoproteins transfected into HEK293T cells in the absence of a cotransfected GPCR or G protein. Affinity for calcium was correlated with the properties of the amino acid side chain at residue 168 of Clytin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResidues with acidic and hydroxylated side chains, e.g., Clytin K168D, K168T and K168E generally exhibited higher calcium affinity (160 nM, 174 nM and 176 nM, respectively) than wild-type Clytin, Aequorin and Obelin (545 nM, 235 nM and 345 nM, respectively). Two other clytin mutants with hydroxylated or absent side chains, K168S and K168G, exhibited calcium affinities comparable to wild-type Aequorin, however, better than wt-Clytin. Substitutions at position 168 of wt-Clytin, which is a lysine, with hydrophobic amino acid residues (e.g., valine and tyrosine) or carboxamide side chains (e.g., asparagine and glutamine) displayed calcium affinities lower than wt-Aequorin but higher than wild-type Clytin. Substitutions at position 168 of Clytin with basic residues (e.g., histidine and arginine) resulted in calcium affinities comparable to wild-type Clytin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe EC50 value for receptor-mediated calcium flux induced by the ligand was determined by plotting luminescence (Y-axis) versus ligand concentration applied to the cells (X-axis), and applying a sigmoidal dose-response curve-fitting algorithm (GraphPad Prism). GPCR-mediated signals of the various modified forms of Clytin having an amino acid substitution at position 168 were also related to the nature of the side chain. In addition, the subcellular location of the photoproteins (cytosolic vs mitochondrial) appeared to have an effect on GPCR-mediated signals. In all the mitochondrially targeted version of photoproteins examined, mt-Clytin K168D yielded a lowest EC50 and highest % GPCR/total, highest signal to background ratio, and maximal signal using a GIP ligand. All of the other mitochondrially targeted mutants except for Clytin K168R and wild-type Clytin yielded results that were in the range of those observed for wt-Aequorin. Similarly, among the cytosolic versions of photoproteins examined, Clytin K168D exhibited a lowest EC50 and highest % GPCR/total, highest signal to background ratio and maximal signal using a GIP ligand.

(canceled) Description\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to protease resistant polypeptides, immunoglobulin (antibody) single variable domains and anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor 1 (TNFR1, p55, CD120a, P60, TNF receptor superfamily member 1A, TNFRSF1A) antagonists comprising these. The invention further relates to uses, formulations, compositions and devices comprising such anti-TNFR1 ligands.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nPolypeptides and peptides have become increasingly important agents in a variety of applications, including industrial applications and use as medical, therapeutic and diagnostic agents. However, in certain physiological states, such as inflammatory states (e.g., COPD) and cancer, the amount of proteases present in a tissue, organ or animal (e.g., in the lung, in or adjacent to a tumor) can increase. This increase in proteases can result in accelerated degradation and inactivation of endogenous proteins and of therapeutic peptides, polypeptides and proteins that are administered to treat disease. Accordingly, some agents that have potential for in vivo use (e.g., use in treating, diagnosing or preventing disease) have only limited efficacy because they are rapidly degraded and inactivated by proteases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProtease resistant polypeptides provide several advantages. For example, protease resistant polypeptides remaining active in vivo longer than protease sensitive agents and, accordingly, remaining functional for a period of time that is sufficient to produce biological effects. A need exists for improved methods to select polypeptides that are resistant to protease degradation and also have desirable biological activity.\n\n\n \nTNFR1\n\n\n \n \n \nTNFR1 is a transmembrane receptor containing an extracellular region that binds ligand and an intracellular domain that lacks intrinsic signal transduction activity but can associate with signal transduction molecules. The complex of TNFR1 with bound TNF contains three TNFR1 chains and three TNF chains. (Banner et al., \nCell, \n73(3) 431-445 (1993).) The TNF ligand is present as a trimer, which is bound by three TNFR1 chains. (Id.) The three TNFR1 chains are clustered closely together in the receptor-ligand complex, and this clustering is a prerequisite to TNFR1-mediated signal transduction. In fact, multivalent agents that bind TNFR1, such as anti-TNFR1 antibodies, can induce TNFR1 clustering and signal transduction in the absence of TNF and are commonly used as TNFR1 agonists. (See, e.g., Belka et al., \nEMBO, \n14(6):1156-1165 (1995); Mandik-Nayak et al., \nJ. Immunol, \n167:1920-1928 (2001).) Accordingly, multivalent agents that bind TNFR1, are generally not effective antagonists of TNFR1 even if they block the binding of TNFα to TNFR1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe extracellular region of TNFR1 comprises a thirteen amino acid amino-terminal segment (amino acids 1-13 of SEQ ID NO:603 (human); amino acids 1-13 of SEQ ID NO:604 (mouse)), Domain 1 (amino acids 14-53 of SEQ ID NO:603 (human); amino acids 14-53 of SEQ ID NO:604 (mouse)), Domain 2 (amino acids 54-97 of SEQ ID NO: 603 (human); amino acids 54-97 of SEQ ID NO:604 (mouse)), Domain 3 (amino acids 98-138 of SEQ ID NO: 603 (human); amino acid 98-138 of SEQ ID NO:604 (mouse)), and Domain 4 (amino acids 139-167 of SEQ ID NO:603 (human); amino acids 139-167 of SEQ ID NO:604 (mouse)) which is followed by a membrane-proximal region (amino acids 168-182 of SEQ ID NO:603 (human); amino acids 168-183 SEQ ID NO: 604 (mouse)). (See, Banner et al., \nCell \n73(3) 431-445 (1993) and Loetscher et al., \nCell \n61(2) 351-359 (1990).) \n \nDomains\n \n 2 and 3 make contact with bound ligand (TNFβ, TNFα). (Banner et al., \nCell, \n73(3) 431-445 (1993).) The extracellular region of TNFR1 also contains a region referred to as the pre-ligand binding assembly domain or PLAD domain (amino acids 1-53 of SEQ ID NO:603 (human); amino acids 1-53 of SEQ ID NO:604 (mouse)) (The Government of the USA, WO 01/58953; Deng et al., \nNature Medicine\n, doi: 10.1038/nm1304 (2005)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTNFR1 is shed from the surface of cells in vivo through a process that includes proteolysis of TNFR1 in \nDomain\n 4 or in the membrane-proximal region (amino acids 168-182 of SEQ ID NO:603; amino acids 168-183 of SEQ ID NO:604), to produce a soluble form of TNFR1. Soluble TNFR1 retains the capacity to bind TNFα, and thereby functions as an endogenous inhibitor of the activity of TNFα.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention provides a polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence that is at least 95% identical to the amino acid sequence of DOM1h-131-511 (shown in \nFIG. 3\n).

In one embodiment, the percent identity is at least 80, 85, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98 or 99%. In one embodiment, the selected variable domain is DOM1h-131-511, DOM1h-131-201, DOM1h-131-202, DOM1h-131-203, DOM1h-131-204, DOM1h-131-205 or DOM1h-131-206. The antagonist may be resistant to protease, for example one or more of the proteases as herein described, for example under a set of conditions as herein described. In one embodiment, the antagonist is an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof, such as a monovalent antigen-binding fragment (e.g., scFv, Fab, Fab′, dAb) that has binding specificity for TNFR1. Other examples of antagonists are ligands described herein that bind TNFR1. The ligands may comprise an immunoglobulin single variable domain or domain antibody (dAb) that has binding specificity for TNFR1, or the complementarity determining regions of such a dAb in a suitable format. In some embodiments, the ligand is a dAb monomer that consists essentially of, or consists of, an immunoglobulin single variable domain or dAb that has binding specificity for TNFR1. In other embodiments, the ligand is a polypeptide that comprises a dAb (or the CDRs of a dAb) in a suitable format, such as an antibody format.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome antagonist of TNFR1 of the invention do not inhibit binding of TNFα to TNFR1, but do inhibit signal transduction mediated through TNFR1. For example, an antagonist of TNFR1 can inhibit TNFα-induced clustering of TNFR1, which precedes signal transduction through TNFR1. Such antagonists provide several advantages. For example, in the presence of such an antagonist, TNFα can bind TNFR1 expressed on the surface of cells and be removed from the cellular environment, but TNFR1 mediated signal transduction will not be activated. Thus, TNFR1 signal-induced production of additional TNFα and other mediators of inflammation will be inhibited. Similarly, antagonists of TNFR1 that bind TNFR1 and inhibit signal transduction mediated through TNFR1, but do no inhibit binding of TNFα to TNFR1, will not inhibit the TNFα-binding and inhibiting activity of endogenously produced soluble TNFR1. Accordingly, administering such an antagonist to a mammal in need thereof can complement the endogenous regulatory pathways that inhibit the activity TNFα and the activity of TNFR1 in vivo. The invention also relates to ligands that (i) bind TNFR1 (eg, in Domain1), (ii) antagonize the activation of TNFR1 mediated signal transduction, and (iii) do not inhibit the binding of TNFα to TNFR1. Such a ligand binds soluble TNFR1 and does not prevent the soluble receptor from binding TNFα, and thus administering such an antagonist to a mammal in need thereof can complement the endogenous regulatory pathways that inhibit the activity TNFα in vivo by increasing the half-life of the soluble receptor in the serum. These advantages are particularly relevant to ligands that have been formatted to have a larger hydrodynamic size, for example, by attachment of a PEG group, serum albumin, transferrin, transferrin receptor or at least the transferrin-binding portion thereof, an antibody Fc region, or by conjugation to an antibody domain. For example, an agent (e.g., polypeptide, variable domain or antagonist) that i) binds TNFR1 (eg., in Domain1), (ii) antagonizes the activation of TNFR1 mediated signal transduction, and (iii) does not inhibit the binding of TNFα to TNFR1, such as a dAb monomer, can be formatted as a larger antigen-binding fragment of an antibody or as and antibody (e.g., formatted as a Fab, Fab′, F(ab)\n2\n, F(ab′)\n2\n, IgG, scFv). The hydrodynamic size of a ligand and its serum half-life can also be increased by conjugating or linking a TNFR1 binding agent (antagonist; variable domain) to a binding domain (e.g., antibody or antibody fragment) that binds an antigen or epitope that increases half-live in vivo, as described herein (see, \nAnnex\n 1 of WO2006038027 incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). For example, the TNFR1 binding agent (e.g., polypeptide) can be conjugated or linked to an anti-serum albumin or anti-neonatal Fc receptor antibody or antibody fragment, eg an anti-SA or anti-neonatal Fc receptor dAb, Fab, Fab′ or scFv, or to an anti-SA affibody or anti-neonatal Fc receptor affibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of suitable albumin, albumin fragments or albumin variants for use in a TNFR1-binding ligand according to the invention are described in WO 2005/077042A2 and WO2006038027, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments of the invention described throughout this disclosure, instead of the use of a “dAb” in an antagonist or ligand of the invention, it is contemplated that the skilled addressee can use a domain that comprises the CDRs of a dAb that binds TNFR1 (e.g., CDRs grafted onto a suitable protein scaffold or skeleton, eg an affibody, an SpA scaffold, an LDL receptor class A domain or an EGF domain) or can be a protein domain comprising a binding site for TNFR1, e.g., wherein the domain is selected from an affibody, an SpA domain, an LDL receptor class A domain or an EGF domain.

It is intended and should be appreciated that embodiments may be variously combined or separated without parting from the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art (e.g., in cell culture, molecular genetics, nucleic acid chemistry, hybridization techniques and biochemistry). Standard techniques are used for molecular, genetic and biochemical methods (see generally, Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2d ed. (1989) Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. and Ausubel et al., Short Protocols in Molecular Biology (1999) 4\nth \nEd, John Wiley & Sons, Inc. which are incorporated herein by reference) and chemical methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “antagonist of Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor 1 (TNFR1)” or “anti-TNFR1 antagonist” or the like refers to an agent (e.g., a molecule, a compound) which binds TNFR1 and can inhibit a (i.e., one or more) function of TNFR1. For example, an antagonist of TNFR1 can inhibit the binding of TNFα to TNFR1 and/or inhibit signal transduction mediated through TNFR1. Accordingly, TNFR1-mediated processes and cellular responses (e.g., TNFα-induced cell death in a standard L929 cytotoxicity assay) can be inhibited with an antagonist of TNFR1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “peptide” refers to about two to about 50 amino acids that are joined together via peptide bonds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “polypeptide” refers to at least about 50 amino acids that are joined together by peptide bonds. Polypeptides generally comprise tertiary structure and fold into functional domains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, a peptide or polypeptide (e.g. a domain antibody (dAb)) that is “resistant to protease degradation” is not substantially degraded by a protease when incubated with the protease under conditions suitable for protease activity. A polypeptide (e.g., a dAb) is not substantially degraded when no more than about 25%, no more than about 20%, no more than about 15%, no more than about 14%, no more than about 13%, no more than about 12%, no more than about 11%, no more than about 10%, no more than about 9%, no more than about 8%, no more than about 7%, no more than about 6%, no more than about 5%, no more than about 4%, no more than about 3%, no more that about 2%, no more than about 1%, or substantially none of the protein is degraded by protease after incubation with the protease for about one hour at a temperature suitable for protease activity. For example at 37 or 50 degrees C. Protein degradation can be assessed using any suitable method, for example, by SDS-PAGE or by functional assay (e.g., ligand binding) as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “display system” refers to a system in which a collection of polypeptides or peptides are accessible for selection based upon a desired characteristic, such as a physical, chemical or functional characteristic. The display system can be a suitable repertoire of polypeptides or peptides (e.g., in a solution, immobilized on a suitable support). The display system can also be a system that employs a cellular expression system (e.g., expression of a library of nucleic acids in, e.g., transformed, infected, transfected or transduced cells and display of the encoded polypeptides on the surface of the cells) or an acellular expression system (e.g., emulsion compartmentalization and display). Exemplary display systems link the coding function of a nucleic acid and physical, chemical and/or functional characteristics of a polypeptide or peptide encoded by the nucleic acid. When such a display system is employed, polypeptides or peptides that have a desired physical, chemical and/or functional characteristic can be selected and a nucleic acid encoding the selected polypeptide or peptide can be readily isolated or recovered. A number of display systems that link the coding function of a nucleic acid and physical, chemical and/or functional characteristics of a polypeptide or peptide are known in the art, for example, bacteriophage display (phage display, for example phagemid display), ribosome display, emulsion compartmentalization and display, yeast display, puromycin display, bacterial display, display on plasmid, covalent display and the like. (See, e.g., EP 0436597 (Dyax), U.S. Pat. No. 6,172,197 (McCafferty et al.), U.S. Pat. No. 6,489,103 (Griffiths et al.).)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “repertoire” refers to a collection of polypeptides or peptides that are characterized by amino acid sequence diversity. The individual members of a repertoire can have common features, such as common structural features (e.g., a common core structure) and/or common functional features (e.g., capacity to bind a common ligand (e.g., a generic ligand or a target ligand, TNFR1)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “functional” describes a polypeptide or peptide that has biological activity, such as specific binding activity. For example, the term “functional polypeptide” includes an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof that binds a target antigen through its antigen-binding site.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “generic ligand” refers to a ligand that binds a substantial portion (e.g., substantially all) of the functional members of a given repertoire. A generic ligand (e.g., a common generic ligand) can bind many members of a given repertoire even though the members may not have binding specificity for a common target ligand. In general, the presence of a functional generic ligand-binding site on a polypeptide (as indicated by the ability to bind a generic ligand) indicates that the polypeptide is correctly folded and functional. Suitable examples of generic ligands include superantigens, antibodies that bind an epitope expressed on a substantial portion of functional members of a repertoire, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Superantigen” is a term of art that refers to generic ligands that interact with members of the immunoglobulin superfamily at a site that is distinct from the target ligand-binding sites of these proteins. Staphylococcal enterotoxins are examples of superantigens which interact with T-cell receptors. Superantigens that bind antibodies include Protein G, which binds the IgG constant region (Bjorck and Kronvall, \nJ. Immunol., \n133:969 (1984)); Protein A which binds the IgG constant region and V\nH \ndomains (Forsgren and Sjoquist, \nJ. Immunol., \n97:822 (1966)); and Protein L which binds V\nL \ndomains (Bjorck, \nJ. Immunol., \n140:1194 (1988)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “target ligand” refers to a ligand which is specifically or selectively bound by a polypeptide or peptide. For example, when a polypeptide is an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof, the target ligand can be any desired antigen or epitope. Binding to the target antigen is dependent upon the polypeptide or peptide being functional.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein an antibody refers to IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD or IgE or a fragment (such as a Fab, F(ab′)\n2\n, Fv, disulphide linked Fv, scFv, closed conformation multispecific antibody, disulphide-linked scFv, diabody) whether derived from any species naturally producing an antibody, or created by recombinant DNA technology; whether isolated from serum, B-cells, hybridomas, transfectomas, yeast or bacteria.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “antibody format” refers to any suitable polypeptide structure in which one or more antibody variable domains can be incorporated so as to confer binding specificity for antigen on the structure. A variety of suitable antibody formats are known in the art, such as, chimeric antibodies, humanized antibodies, human antibodies, single chain antibodies, bispecific antibodies, antibody heavy chains, antibody light chains, homodimers and heterodimers of antibody heavy chains and/or light chains, antigen-binding fragments of any of the foregoing (e.g., a Fv fragment (e.g., single chain Fv (scFv), a disulfide bonded Fv), a Fab fragment, a Fab′ fragment, a F(ab′)\n2 \nfragment), a single antibody variable domain (e.g., a dAb, V\nH\n, V\nHH\n, V\nL)\n, and modified versions of any of the foregoing (e.g., modified by the covalent attachment of polyethylene glycol or other suitable polymer or a humanized V\nHH\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase “immunoglobulin single variable domain” refers to an antibody variable domain (V\nH\n, V\nHH\n, V\nL\n) that specifically binds an antigen or epitope independently of other V regions or domains. An immunoglobulin single variable domain can be present in a format (e.g., homo- or hetero-multimer) with other variable regions or variable domains where the other regions or domains are not required for antigen binding by the single immunoglobulin variable domain (i.e., where the immunoglobulin single variable domain binds antigen independently of the additional variable domains). A “domain antibody” or “dAb” is the same as an “immunoglobulin single variable domain” as the term is used herein. A “single immunoglobulin variable domain” is the same as an “immunoglobulin single variable domain” as the term is used herein. A “single antibody variable domain” or an “antibody single variable domain” is the same as an “immunoglobulin single variable domain” as the term is used herein. An immunoglobulin single variable domain is in one embodiment a human antibody variable domain, but also includes single antibody variable domains from other species such as rodent (for example, as disclosed in WO 00/29004, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety), nurse shark and Camelid V\nHH \ndAbs. Camelid V\nHH \nare immunoglobulin single variable domain polypeptides that are derived from species including camel, llama, alpaca, dromedary, and guanaco, which produce heavy chain antibodies naturally devoid of light chains. The V\nHH \nmay be humanized.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “domain” is a folded protein structure which has tertiary structure independent of the rest of the protein. Generally, domains are responsible for discrete functional properties of proteins, and in many cases may be added, removed or transferred to other proteins without loss of function of the remainder of the protein and/or of the domain. A “single antibody variable domain” is a folded polypeptide domain comprising sequences characteristic of antibody variable domains. It therefore includes complete antibody variable domains and modified variable domains, for example, in which one or more loops have been replaced by sequences which are not characteristic of antibody variable domains, or antibody variable domains which have been truncated or comprise N- or C-terminal extensions, as well as folded fragments of variable domains which retain at least the binding activity and specificity of the full-length domain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “library” refers to a mixture of heterogeneous polypeptides or nucleic acids. The library is composed of members, each of which has a single polypeptide or nucleic acid sequence. To this extent, “library” is synonymous with “repertoire.” Sequence differences between library members are responsible for the diversity present in the library. The library may take the form of a simple mixture of polypeptides or nucleic acids, or may be in the form of organisms or cells, for example bacteria, viruses, animal or plant cells and the like, transformed with a library of nucleic acids. In one embodiment, each individual organism or cell contains only one or a limited number of library members. In one embodiment, the nucleic acids are incorporated into expression vectors, in order to allow expression of the polypeptides encoded by the nucleic acids. In an aspect, therefore, a library may take the form of a population of host organisms, each organism containing one or more copies of an expression vector containing a single member of the library in nucleic acid form which can be expressed to produce its corresponding polypeptide member. Thus, the population of host organisms has the potential to encode a large repertoire of diverse polypeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “universal framework” is a single antibody framework sequence corresponding to the regions of an antibody conserved in sequence as defined by Kabat (“Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest”, US Department of Health and Human Services) or corresponding to the human germline immunoglobulin repertoire or structure as defined by Chothia and Lesk, (1987) J. Mol. Biol. 196:910-917. Libraries and repertoires can use a single framework, or a set of such frameworks, which has been found to permit the derivation of virtually any binding specificity though variation in the hypervariable regions alone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “dose” refers to the quantity of ligand administered to a subject all at one time (unit dose), or in two or more administrations over a defined time interval. For example, dose can refer to the quantity of ligand (e.g., ligand comprising an immunoglobulin single variable domain that binds target antigen) administered to a subject over the course of one day (24 hours) (daily dose), two days, one week, two weeks, three weeks or one or more months (e.g., by a single administration, or by two or more administrations). The interval between doses can be any desired amount of time.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase, “half-life,” refers to the time taken for the serum concentration of the ligand (eg, dAb, polypeptide or antagonist) to reduce by 50%, in vivo, for example due to degradation of the ligand and/or clearance or sequestration of the ligand by natural mechanisms. The ligands of the invention may be stabilized in vivo and their half-life increased by binding to molecules which resist degradation and/or clearance or sequestration. Typically, such molecules are naturally occurring proteins which themselves have a long half-life in vivo. The half-life of a ligand is increased if its functional activity persists, in vivo, for a longer period than a similar ligand which is not specific for the half-life increasing molecule. For example, a ligand specific for human serum albumin (HAS) and a target molecule is compared with the same ligand wherein the specificity to HSA is not present, that is does not bind HSA but binds another molecule. For example, it may bind a third target on the cell. Typically, the half-life is increased by 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% or more. Increases in the range of 2×, 3×, 4×, 5×, 10×, 20×, 30×, 40×, 50× or more of the half-life are possible. Alternatively, or in addition, increases in the range of up to 30×, 40×, 50×, 60×, 70×, 80×, 90×, 100×, 150× of the half-life are possible.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “hydrodynamic size” refers to the apparent size of a molecule (e.g., a protein molecule, ligand) based on the diffusion of the molecule through an aqueous solution. The diffusion, or motion of a protein through solution can be processed to derive an apparent size of the protein, where the size is given by the “Stokes radius” or “hydrodynamic radius” of the protein particle. The “hydrodynamic size” of a protein depends on both mass and shape (conformation), such that two proteins having the same molecular mass may have differing hydrodynamic sizes based on the overall conformation of the protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs referred to herein, the term “competes” means that the binding of a first target to its cognate target binding domain is inhibited in the presence of a second binding domain that is specific for said cognate target. For example, binding may be inhibited sterically, for example by physical blocking of a binding domain or by alteration of the structure or environment of a binding domain such that its affinity or avidity for a target is reduced. See WO2006038027 for details of how to perform competition ELISA and competition BiaCore experiments to determine competition between first and second binding domains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCalculations of “homology” or “identity” or “similarity” between two sequences (the terms are used interchangeably herein) are performed as follows. The sequences are aligned for optimal comparison purposes (e.g., gaps can be introduced in one or both of a first and a second amino acid or nucleic acid sequence for optimal alignment and non-homologous sequences can be disregarded for comparison purposes). In an embodiment, the length of a reference sequence aligned for comparison purposes is at least 30%, or at least 40%, or at least 50%, or at least 60%, or at least 70%, 80%, 90%, 100% of the length of the reference sequence. The amino acid residues or nucleotides at corresponding amino acid positions or nucleotide positions are then compared. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same amino acid residue or nucleotide as the corresponding position in the second sequence, then the molecules are identical at that position (as used herein amino acid or nucleic acid “homology” is equivalent to amino acid or nucleic acid “identity”). The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences, taking into account the number of gaps, and the length of each gap, which need to be introduced for optimal alignment of the two sequences. Amino acid and nucleotide sequence alignments and homology, similarity or identity, as defined herein may be prepared and determined using the \nalgorithm BLAST\n 2 Sequences, using default parameters (Tatusova, T. A. et al., \nFEMS Microbiol Lett, \n174:187-188 (1999)).\n\n\n \nSelection Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention in one embodiment relates to polypeptides and dAbs selected by a method of selection of protease resistant peptides and polypeptides that have a desired biological activity. Two selective pressures are used in the method to produce an efficient process for selecting polypeptides that are highly stable and resistant to protease degradation, and that have desired biological activity. As described herein, protease resistant peptides and polypeptides generally retain biological activity. In contrast, protease sensitive peptides and polypeptides are cleaved or digested by protease in the methods described herein, and therefore, lose their biological activity. Accordingly, protease resistant peptides or polypeptides are generally selected based on their biological activity, such as binding activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe methods described herein provide several advantages. For example, as disclosed and exemplified herein, variable domains, antagonists, peptides or polypeptides that are selected for resistance to proteolytic degradation by one protease (e.g., trypsin), are also resistant to degradation by other proteases (e.g., elastase, leucozyme). In one embodiment protease resistance correlates with a higher melting temperature (Tm) of the peptide or polypeptide. Higher melting temperatures are indicative of more stable variable domains, antagonists, peptides and polypeptides. Resistance to protease degradation also correlates in one embodiment with high affinity binding to target ligands. Thus, the methods described herein provide an efficient way to select, isolate and/or recover variable domains, antagonists, peptides, polypeptides that have a desired biological activity and that are well suited for in vivo therapeutic and/or diagnostic uses because they are protease resistant and stable. In one embodiment protease resistance correlates with an improved PK, for example improved over n variable domain, antagonist, peptide or polypeptide that is not protease resistant. Improved PK may be an improved AUC (area under the curve) and/or an improved half-life. In one embodiment protease resistance correlates with an improved stability of the variable domain, antagonist, peptide or polypeptide to shear and/or thermal stress and/or a reduced propensity to aggregate during nebulisation, for example improved over an variable domain, antagonist, peptide or polypeptide that is not protease resistant. In one embodiment protease resistance correlates with an improved storage stability, for example improved over an variable domain, antagonist, peptide or polypeptide that is not protease resistant. In one aspect, one, two, three, four or all of the advantages are provided, the advantages being resistance to protease degradation, higher Tm and high affinity binding to target ligand.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, there is provided a method for selecting, isolating and/or recovering a peptide or polypeptide from a library or a repertoire of peptides and polypeptides (e.g., a display system) that is resistant to degradation by a protease (e.g., one or more proteases). In one embodiment, the method is a method for selecting, isolating and/or recovering a polypeptide from a library or a repertoire of peptides and polypeptides (e.g., a display system) that is resistant to degradation by a protease (e.g., one or more proteases). Generally, the method comprises providing a library or repertoire of peptides or polypeptides, combining the library or repertoire with a protease (e.g., trypsin, elastase, leucozyme, pancreatin, sputum) under conditions suitable for protease activity, and selecting, isolating and/or recovering a peptide or polypeptide that is resistant to degradation by the protease and has a desired biological activity. Peptides or polypeptides that are degraded by a protease generally have reduced biological activity or lose their biological activity due to the activity of protease. Accordingly, peptides or polypeptides that are resistant to protease degradation can be selected, isolated and/or recovered using the method based on their biological activity, such as binding activity (e.g., binding a general ligand, binding a specific ligand, binding a substrate), catalytic activity or other biological activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe library or repertoire of peptides or polypeptides is combined with a protease (e.g., one or more proteases) under conditions suitable for proteolytic activity of the protease. Conditions that are suitable for proteolytic activity of protease, and biological preparations or mixtures that contain proteolytic activity, are well-known in the art or can be readily determined by a person of ordinary skill in the art. If desired, suitable conditions can be identified or optimized, for example, by assessing protease activity under a range of pH conditions, protease concentrations, temperatures and/or by varying the amount of time the library or repertoire and the protease are permitted to react. For example, in some embodiments, the ratio (on a mole/mole basis) of protease, eg trypsin, to peptide or polypeptide (eg, variable domain) is 800 to 80,00 (eg, 8,000 to 80,000) protease:peptide or polypeptide, eg when 10 micrograms/ml of protease is used, the ratio is 800 to 80,000 protease:peptide or polypeptide; or when 100 micrograms/ml of protease is used, the ratio is 8,000 to 80,000 protease:peptide or polypeptide. In one embodiment the ratio (on a weight/weight, eg microgram/microgram basis) of protease (eg, trypsin) to peptide or polypeptide (eg, variable domain) is 1,600 to 160,000 (eg, 16,000 to 160,000) protease:peptide or polypeptide eg when 10 micrograms/ml of protease is used, the ratio is 1,600 to 160,000 protease:peptide or polypeptide; or when 100 micrograms/ml of protease is used, the ratio is 16,000 to 160,000 protease:peptide or polypeptide. In one embodiment, the protease is used at a concentration of at least 100 or 1000 micrograms/ml and the protease:peptide ratio (on a mole/mole basis) of protease, eg trypsin, to peptide or polypeptide (eg, variable domain)\n\n\n \n \nis 8,000 to 80,000 protease:peptide or polypeptide. In one embodiment, the protease is used at a concentration of at least 10 micrograms/ml and the protease:peptide ratio (on a mole/mole basis) of protease, eg trypsin, to peptide or polypeptide (eg, variable domain) is 800 to 80,000 protease:peptide or polypeptide. In one embodiment the ratio (on a weight/weight, eg microgram/microgram basis) of protease (eg, trypsin) to peptide or polypeptide (eg, variable domain) is 1600 to 160,000 protease:peptide or polypeptide eg when C is 10 micrograms/ml; or when C or C′ is 100 micrograms/ml, the ratio is 16,000 to 160,000 protease:peptide or polypeptide. In one embodiment, the concentration (c or c′) is at least 100 or 1000 micrograms/ml protease. For testing an individual or isolated peptide or polypeptide (eg, an immunoglobulin variable domain), eg one that has already been isolated from a repertoire or library, a protease can be added to a solution of peptide or polypeptide in a suitable buffer (e.g., PBS) to produce a peptide or polypeptide/protease solution, such as a solution of at least about 0.01% (w/w) protease/peptide or polypeptide, about 0.01% to about 5% (w/w) protease/peptide or polypeptide, about 0.05% to about 5% (w/w) protease/peptide or polypeptide, about 0.1% to about 5% (w/w) protease/peptide or polypeptide, about 0.5% to about 5% (w/w) protease/peptide or polypeptide, about 1% to about 5% (w/w) protease/peptide or polypeptide, at least about 0.01% (w/w) protease/peptide or polypeptide, at least about 0.02% (w/w) protease/peptide or polypeptide, at least about 0.03% (w/w) protease/peptide or polypeptide, at least about 0.04% (w/w) protease/peptide or polypeptide, at least about 0.05% (w/w) protease/peptide or polypeptide, at least about 0.06% (w/w) protease/peptide or polypeptide, at least about 0.07% (w/w) protease/peptide or polypeptide, at least about 0.08% (w/w) protease/peptide or polypeptide, at least about 0.09% (w/w) protease/peptide or polypeptide, at least about 0.1% (w/w) protease/peptide or polypeptide, at least about 0.2% (w/w) protease/peptide or polypeptide, at least about 0.3% (w/w) protease/peptide or polypeptide, at least about 0.4% (w/w) protease/peptide or polypeptide, at least about 0.5% (w/w) protease/peptide or polypeptide, at least about 0.6% (w/w) protease/peptide or polypeptide, at least about 0.7% (w/w) protease/peptide or polypeptide, at least about 0.8% (w/w) protease/peptide or polypeptide, at least about 0.9% (w/w) protease/peptide or polypeptide, at least about 1% (w/w) protease/peptide or polypeptide, at least about 2% (w/w) protease/peptide or polypeptide, at least about 3% (w/w) protease/peptide or polypeptide, at least about 4% (w/w) protease/peptide or polypeptide, or about 5% (w/w) protease/peptide or polypeptide. The mixture can be incubated at a suitable temperature for protease activity (e.g., room temperature, about 37° C.) and samples can be taken at time intervals (e.g., at 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, etc.). The samples can be analyzed for protein degradation using any suitable method, such as SDS-PAGE analysis or ligand binding, and the results can be used to establish a time course of degradation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny desired protease or proteases can be used in the methods described herein. For example, a single protease, any desired combination of different proteases, or any biological preparation, biological extract, or biological homogenate that contains proteolytic activity can be used. It is not necessary that the identity of the protease or proteases that are used be known. Suitable examples of proteases that can be used alone or in any desired combination include serine protease, cysteine protease, aspartate proteases, thiol proteases, matrix metalloprotease, carboxypeptidase (e.g., carboxypeptidase A, carboxypeptidase B), trypsin, chymotrypsin, pepsin, papain, elastase, leukozyme, pancreatin, thrombin, plasmin, cathepsins (e.g., cathepsin G), proteinase (e.g., \nproteinase\n 1, \nproteinase\n 2, proteinase 3), thermolysin, chymosin, enteropeptidase, caspase (e.g., \ncaspase\n 1, \ncaspase\n 2, \ncaspase\n 4, \ncaspase\n 5, \ncaspase\n 9, \ncaspase\n 12, caspase 13), calpain, ficain, clostripain, actinidain, bromelain, separase and the like. Suitable biological extracts, homogenates and preparations that contains proteolytic activity include sputum, mucus (e.g., gastric mucus, nasal mucus, bronchial mucus), bronchoalveolar lavage, lung homogenate, lung extract, pancreatic extract, gastric fluid, saliva, tears and the like. The protease is used in an amount suitable for proteolytic degradation to occur. For example, as described herein, protease can be used at about 0.01% to about 5% (w/w, protease/peptide or polypeptide). When protease is combined with a display system that comprises the repertoire of peptides or polypeptides (e.g., a phage display system), for example, the protease can be used at a concentration of about 10 μg/ml to about 3 mg/ml, about 10 μg/ml, about 20 μg/ml, about 30 μg/ml, about 40 μg/ml, about 50 μg/ml, about 60 μg/ml, about 70 μg/ml, about 80 μg/ml, about 90 μg/ml, about 100 μg/ml, about 200 μg/ml, about 300 μg/ml, about 400 μg/ml, about 500 μg/ml, about 600 μg/ml, about 700 μg/ml, about 800 μg/ml, about 900 μg/ml, about 1000 μg/ml, about 1.5 mg/ml, about 2 mg/ml, about 2.5 mg/ml or about 3 mg/ml.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe protease is incubated with the collection of peptides or polypeptides (library or repertoire) at a temperature that is suitable for activity of the protease. For example, the protease and collection of peptides or polypeptides can be incubated at a temperature of about 20° C. to about 40° C. (e.g., at room temperature, about 20° C., about 21° C., about 22° C., about 23° C., about 24° C., about 25° C., about 26° C., about 27° C., about 28° C., about 29° C., about 30° C., about 31° C., about 32° C., about 33° C., about 34° C., about 35° C., about 36° C., about 37° C., about 38° C., about 39° C., about 40° C.). The protease and the collection of peptides or polypeptides are incubated together for a period of time sufficient for proteolytic degradation to occur. For example, the collection of peptides or polypeptides can be incubated together with protease for about 30 minutes to about 24 or about 48 hours. In some examples, the collection of peptides or polypeptides is incubated together with protease overnight, or for at least about 30 minutes, about 1 hour, about 1.5 hours, about 2 hours, about 3 hours, about 4 hours, about 5 hours, about 6 hours, about 7 hours, about 8 hours, about 9 hours, about 10 hours, about 11 hours, about 12 hours, about 13 hours, about 14 hours, about 15 hours, about 16 hours, about 17 hours, about 18 hours, about 19 hours, about 20 hours, about 21 hours, about 22 hours, about 23 hours, about 24 hours, about 48 hours, or longer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is generally desirable, at least in early selection rounds (e.g. when a display system is used), that the protease results in a reduction in the number of clones that have the desired biological activity that is selected for by at least one order of magnitude, in comparison to selections that do not include incubation with protease. In particular examples, the amount of protease and conditions used in the methods are sufficient to reduce the number of recovered clones by at least about one log (a factor of 10), at least about 2 logs (a factor of 100), at least about 3 logs (a factor of 1000) or at least about 4 logs (a factor of 10,000). Suitable amounts of protease and incubation conditions that will result in the desired reduction in recovered clones can be easily determined using conventional methods and/or the guidance provided herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe protease and collection of peptides or polypeptides can be combined and incubated using any suitable method (e.g., in vitro, in vivo or ex vivo). For example, the protease and collection of peptides or polypeptides can be combined in a suitable container and held stationary, rocked, shaken, swirled or the like, at a temperature suitable for protease activity. If desired, the protease and collection of peptides or polypeptides can be combined in an in vivo or ex vivo system, such as by introducing the collection of polypeptides (e.g., a phage display library or repertoire) into a suitable animal (e.g., a mouse), and after sufficient time for protease activity has passed, recovering the collection of peptides or polypeptides. In another example, an organ or tissue is perfused with the collection of polypeptides (e.g., a phage display library or repertoire), and after sufficient time for protease activity has passed, the collection of polypeptides is recovered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing incubation, a protease resistant peptide or polypeptide can be selected based on a desired biological activity, such as a binding activity. If desired, a protease inhibitor can be added before selection. Any suitable protease inhibitor (or combination of two or more protease inhibitors) that will not substantially interfere with the selection method can be used. Examples of suitable protease inhibitors include, α1-anti-trypsin, α2-macroglobulin, amastatin, antipain, antithrombin III, aprotinin, 4-(2-Aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (AEBSF), (4-Amidino-Phenyl)-Methane-Sulfonyl Fluoride (APMSF), bestatin, benzamidine, chymostatin, 3,4-Dichloroisocoumarin, diisoproply fluorophosphate (DIFP), E-64, ethylenediamine tetraacedic acid (EDTA), elastatinal, leupeptin, N-Ethylmaleimide, phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF), pepstatin, 1,10-Phenanthroline, phosphoramidon, serine protease inhibitors, N-tosyl-L-lysine-chloromethyl ketone (TLCK), Na-Tosyl-Phe-chloromethylketone (TPCK) and the like. In addition, many preparations that contain inhibitors of several classes of proteases are commercially available (e.g., Roche Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablets™ (Roche Diagnostics Corporation; Indianapolis, Ind., USA), which inhibits chymotrypsin, thermolysin, papain, pronase, pancreatic extract and trypsin).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA protease resistant peptide or polypeptide can be selected using a desired biological activity selection method, which allows peptides and polypeptides that have the desired biological activity to be distinguished from and selected over peptides and polypeptides that do not have the desired biological activity. Generally, peptides or polypeptides that have been digested or cleaved by protease loose their biological activity, while protease resistant peptides or polypeptides remain functional. Thus, suitable assays for biological activity can be used to select protease resistant peptides or polypeptides. For example, a common binding function (e.g., binding of a general ligand, binding of a specific ligand, or binding of a substrate) can be assessed using a suitable binding assay (e.g., ELISA, panning). For example, polypeptides that bind a target ligand or a generic ligand, such as protein A, protein L or an antibody, can be selected, isolated, and/or recovered by panning or using a suitable affinity matrix. Panning can be accomplished by adding a solution of ligand (e.g., generic ligand, target ligand) to a suitable vessel (e.g., tube, petri dish) and allowing the ligand to become deposited or coated onto the walls of the vessel. Excess ligand can be washed away and polypeptides (e.g., a phage display library) can be added to the vessel and the vessel maintained under conditions suitable for the polypeptides to bind the immobilized ligand. Unbound polypeptide can be washed away and bound polypeptides can be recovered using any suitable method, such as scraping or lowering the pH, for example.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen a phage display system is used, binding can be tested in a phage ELISA. Phage ELISA may be performed according to any suitable procedure. In one example, populations of phage produced at each round of selection can be screened for binding by ELISA to the selected target ligand or generic ligand, to identify phage that display protease resistant peptides or polypeptides. If desired, soluble peptides and polypeptides can be tested for binding to target ligand or generic ligand, for example by ELISA using reagents, for example, against a C- or N-terminal tag (see for example Winter et al. (1994) \nAnn. \nRev. Immunology\n \n12, 433-55 and references cited therein). The diversity of the selected phage may also be assessed by gel electrophoresis of PCR products (Marks et al. 1991, supra; Nissim et al. 1994 supra), probing (Tomlinson et al., 1992) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n227, 776) or by sequencing of the vector DNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to specificity for TNFR1, an antagonist or polypeptide (eg, a dual specific ligand) comprising an anti-TNFR1 protease resistant polypeptide (e.g., single antibody variable domain) can have binding specificity for a generic ligand or any desired target ligand, such as human or animal proteins, including cytokines, growth factors, cytokine receptors, growth factor receptors, enzymes (e.g., proteases), co-factors for enzymes, DNA binding proteins, lipids and carbohydrates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the protease resistant peptide or polypeptide (eg, dAb) or antagonist binds TNFR1 in pulmonary tissue. In one embodiment, the antagonist or polypeptide also binds a further target in pulmonary tissue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen a display system (e.g., a display system that links coding function of a nucleic acid and functional characteristics of the peptide or polypeptide encoded by the nucleic acid) is used in the methods described herein it may be frequently advantageous to amplify or increase the copy number of the nucleic acids that encode the selected peptides or polypeptides. This provides an efficient way of obtaining sufficient quantities of nucleic acids and/or peptides or polypeptides for additional rounds of selection, using the methods described herein or other suitable methods, or for preparing additional repertoires (e.g., affinity maturation repertoires). Thus, in some embodiments, the methods comprise using a display system (e.g., that links coding function of a nucleic acid and functional characteristics of the peptide or polypeptide encoded by the nucleic acid, such as phage display) and further comprises amplifying or increasing the copy number of a nucleic acid that encodes a selected peptide or polypeptide. Nucleic acids can be amplified using any suitable methods, such as by phage amplification, cell growth or polymerase chain reaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe methods described herein can be used as part of a program to isolate protease resistant peptides or polypeptides, eg dAbs, that can comprise, if desired, other suitable selection methods. In these situations, the methods described herein can be employed at any desired point in the program, such as before or after other selection methods are used. The methods described herein can also be used to provide two or more rounds of selection, as described and exemplified herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one example, the method is for selecting a peptide or polypeptide, eg a dAb, that is resistant to degradation by elastase, comprising providing a library or repertoire of peptides or polypeptides, combining the library or repertoire with elastase (or a biological preparation, extract or homogenate comprising elastase) under conditions suitable for proteolytic digestion by elastase, and selecting, isolating and/or recovering a peptide or polypeptide that is resistant to degradation by elastase and has TNFR1 binding activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular embodiments, there is provided a method for selecting an immunoglobulin single variable domain (a dAb) that is resistant to degradation by elastase and binds TNFR1. In these embodiments, a library or repertoire comprising dAbs is provided and combined with elastase (or a biological preparation, extract or homogenate comprising elastase) under conditions suitable for proteolytic digestion by elastase. Elastase resistant dAbs are selected that specifically bind TNFR1. For example, the elastase resistant dAb is not substantially degraded when incubated at 37° C. in a 0.04% (w/w) solution of elastase for a period of at least about 2 hours. In one embodiment, the elastase resistant dAb is not substantially degraded when incubated at 37° C. in a 0.04% (w/w) solution of elastase for a period of at least about 12 hours. In one embodiment, the elastase resistant dAb is not substantially degraded when incubated at 37° C. in a 0.04% (w/w) solution of elastase for a period of at least about 24 hours, at least about 36 hours, or at least about 48 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an embodiment, there is provided a method for selecting an immunoglobulin single variable domain (a dAb) that is resistant to degradation by elastase and binds TNFR1. The method comprises providing a phage display system comprising a repertoire of polypeptides that comprise an immunoglobulin single variable domain, combining the phage display system with elastase (about 100 μg/ml) and incubating the mixture at about 37° C., for example, overnight (e.g., about 12-16 hours), and then selecting phage that display a dAb that specifically bind TNFR1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one example, there is provided a method for selecting a peptide or polypeptide (eg, a dAb) that is resistant to degradation by leucozyme, comprising providing a library or repertoire of peptides or polypeptides, combining the library or repertoire with leucozyme (or a biological preparation, extract or homogenate comprising leucozyme) under conditions suitable for proteolytic digestion by leucozyme, and selecting, isolating and/or recovering a peptide or polypeptide that is resistant to degradation by leucozyme and has specific TNFR1 binding activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular embodiments, there is provided a method for selecting an immunoglobulin single variable domain (a dAb) that is resistant to degradation by leucozyme and binds TNFR1. In these embodiments, a library or repertoire comprising dAbs is provided and combined with leucozyme (or a biological preparation, extract or homogenate comprising leucozyme) under conditions suitable for proteolytic digestion by leucozyme. Leucozyme resistant dAbs are selected that specifically bind TNFR1. For example, the leucozyme resistant dAb is not substantially degraded when incubated at 37° C. in a 0.04% (w/w) solution of leucozyme for a period of at least about 2 hours. In one embodiment, the leucozyme resistant dAb is not substantially degraded when incubated at 37° C. in a 0.04% (w/w) solution of leucozyme for a period of at least about 12 hours. In one embodiment, the leucozyme resistant dAb is not substantially degraded when incubated at 37° C. in a 0.04% (w/w) solution of leucozyme for a period of at least about 24 hours, at least about 36 hours, or at least about 48 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an embodiment, there is provided a method for selecting an immunoglobulin single variable domain (a dAb) that is resistant to degradation by leucozyme and specifically binds TNFR1. The method comprises providing a phage display system comprising a repertoire of polypeptides that comprise an immunoglobulin single variable domain, combining the phage display system with leucozyme (about 100 μg/ml) and incubating the mixture at about 37° C., for example, overnight (e.g., about 12-16 hours), and then selecting phage that display a dAb that specifically bind TNFR1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another example, there is provided a method for selecting a peptide or polypeptide (eg, a dAb) that is resistant to degradation by trypsin, comprising providing a library or repertoire of peptides or polypeptides, combining the library or repertoire with trypsin under conditions suitable for proteolytic digestion by trypsin, and selecting, isolating and/or recovering a peptide or polypeptide that is resistant to degradation by trypsin and specifically binds TNFR1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular embodiments, there is provided a method for selecting an immunoglobulin single variable domain (a dAb) that is resistant to degradation by trypsin and specifically binds TNFR1. In these embodiments, a library or repertoire comprising dAbs is provided and combined with trypsin (or a biological preparation, extract or homogenate comprising trypsin) under conditions suitable for proteolytic digestion by trypsin. Trypsin resistant dAbs are selected that bind TNFR1. For example, the trypsin resistant dAb is not substantially degraded when incubated at 37° C. in a 0.04% (w/w) solution of trypsin for a period of at least about 2 hours. In one embodiment, the trypsin resistant dAb is not substantially degraded when incubated at 37° C. in a 0.04% (w/w) solution of trypsin for a period of at least about 3 hours. In one embodiment, the trypsin resistant dAb is not substantially degraded when incubated at 37° C. in a 0.04% (w/w) solution of trypsin for a period of at least about 4 hours, at least about 5 hours, at least about 6 hours, at least about 7 hours, at least about 8 hours, at least about 9 hours, at least about 10 hours, at least about 11 hours, or at least about 12 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an exemplary embodiment, there is provided a method for selecting an immunoglobulin single variable domain (a dAb) that is resistant to degradation by trypsin and specifically binds TNFR1. The method comprises providing a phage display system comprising a repertoire of polypeptides that comprise an immunoglobulin single variable domain, combining the phage display system with trypsin (100 μg/ml) and incubating the mixture at about 37° C., for example overnight (e.g., about 12-16 hours), and then selecting phage that display a dAb that specifically bind TNFR1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, there is provided a method of producing a repertoire of protease resistant peptides or polypeptides (eg, dAbs). The method comprises providing a repertoire of peptides or polypeptides; combining the repertoire of peptides or polypeptides and a protease under suitable conditions for protease activity; and recovering a plurality of peptides or polypeptides that specifically bind TNFR1, whereby a repertoire of protease resistant peptides or polypeptides is produced. Proteases, display systems, conditions for protease activity, and methods for selecting peptides or polypeptides that are suitable for use in the method are described herein with respect to the other methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a display system (e.g., a display system that links coding function of a nucleic acid and functional characteristics of the peptide or polypeptide encoded by the nucleic acid) that comprises a repertoire of peptides or polypeptides is used, and the method further comprises amplifying or increasing the copy number of the nucleic acids that encode the plurality of selected peptides or polypeptides. Nucleic acids can be amplified using any suitable method, such as by phage amplification, cell growth or polymerase chain reaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular embodiment, there is provided a method of producing a repertoire of protease resistant polypeptides that comprise anti-TNFR1 dAbs. The method comprises providing a repertoire of polypeptides that comprise dAbs; combining the repertoire of peptides or polypeptides and a protease (e.g., trypsin, elastase, leucozyme) under suitable conditions for protease activity; and recovering a plurality of polypeptides that comprise dAbs that have binding specificity for TNFR1. The method can be used to produce a naïve repertoire, or a repertoire that is biased toward a desired binding specificity, such as an affinity maturation repertoire based on a parental dAb that has binding specificity for TNFR1.\n\n\n \nPolypeptide Display Systems\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the repertoire or library of peptides or polypeptides provided for use in the methods described herein comprise a suitable display system. The display system may resist degradation by protease (e.g., a single protease or a combination of proteases, and any biological extract, homogenate or preparation that contains proteolytic activity (e.g., sputum, mucus (e.g., gastric mucus, nasal mucus, bronchial mucus), bronchoalveolar lavage, lung homogenate, lung extract, pancreatic extract, gastric fluid, saliva, tears and the like). The display system and the link between the display system and the displayed polypeptide is in one embodiment at least as resistant to protease as the most stable peptides or polypeptides of the repertoire. This allows a nucleic acid that encodes a selected displayed polypeptide to be easily isolated and/or amplified.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one example, a protease resistant peptide or polypeptide, eg a dAb, can be selected, isolated and/or recovered from a repertoire of peptides or polypeptides that is in solution, or is covalently or noncovalently attached to a suitable surface, such as plastic or glass (e.g., microtiter plate, polypeptide array such as a microarray). For example an array of peptides on a surface in a manner that places each distinct library member (e.g., unique peptide sequence) at a discrete, predefined location in the array can be used. The identity of each library member in such an array can be determined by its spatial location in the array. The locations in the array where binding interactions between a target ligand, for example, and reactive library members occur can be determined, thereby identifying the sequences of the reactive members on the basis of spatial location. (See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,143,854, WO 90/15070 and WO 92/10092.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the methods employ a display system that links the coding function of a nucleic acid and physical, chemical and/or functional characteristics of the polypeptide encoded by the nucleic acid. Such a display system can comprise a plurality of replicable genetic packages, such as bacteriophage or cells (bacteria). In one embodiment, the display system comprises a library, such as a bacteriophage display library.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA number of suitable bacteriophage display systems (e.g., monovalent display and multivalent display systems) have been described. (See, e.g., Griffiths et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,555,313 B1 (incorporated herein by reference); Johnson et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,733,743 (incorporated herein by reference); McCafferty et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,969,108 (incorporated herein by reference); Mulligan-Kehoe, U.S. Pat. No. 5,702,892 (Incorporated herein by reference); Winter, G. et al., \nAnnu. Rev. Immunol. \n12:433-455 (1994); Soumillion, P. et al., \nAppl. Biochem. Biotechnol. \n47(2-3):175-189 (1994); Castagnoli, L. et al., \nComb. Chem. High Throughput Screen, \n4(2):121-133 (2001).) The peptides or polypeptides displayed in a bacteriophage display system can be displayed on any suitable bacteriophage, such as a filamentous phage (e.g., fd, M13, F1), a lytic phage (e.g., T4, T7, lambda), or an RNA phage (e.g., MS2), for example.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, a library of phage that displays a repertoire of peptides or phage polypeptides, as fusion proteins with a suitable phage coat protein (e.g., fd pIII protein), is produced or provided. The fusion protein can display the peptides or polypeptides at the tip of the phage coat protein, or if desired at an internal position. For example, the displayed peptide or polypeptide can be present at a position that is amino-terminal to \ndomain\n 1 of pIII. (\nDomain\n 1 of pIII is also referred to as N1.) The displayed polypeptide can be directly fused to pIII (e.g., the N-terminus of \ndomain\n 1 of pIII) or fused to pIII using a linker. If desired, the fusion can further comprise a tag (e.g., myc epitope, His tag). Libraries that comprise a repertoire of peptides or polypeptides that are displayed as fusion proteins with a phage coat protein can be produced using any suitable methods, such as by introducing a library of phage vectors or phagemid vectors encoding the displayed peptides or polypeptides into suitable host bacteria, and culturing the resulting bacteria to produce phage (e.g., using a suitable helper phage or complementing plasmid if desired). The library of phage can be recovered from the culture using any suitable method, such as precipitation and centrifugation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe display system can comprise a repertoire of peptides or polypeptides that contains any desired amount of diversity. For example, the repertoire can contain peptides or polypeptides that have amino acid sequences that correspond to naturally occurring polypeptides expressed by an organism, group of organisms (eg, a repertoire of sequences of V\nHH \ndAbs isolated from a Camelid), desired tissue or desired cell type, or can contain peptides or polypeptides that have random or randomized amino acid sequences. If desired, the polypeptides can share a common core or scaffold. The polypeptides in such a repertoire or library can comprise defined regions of random or randomized amino acid sequence and regions of common amino acid sequence. In certain embodiments, all or substantially all polypeptides in a repertoire are of a desired type, such as a desired enzyme (e.g., a polymerase) or a desired antigen-binding fragment of an antibody (e.g., human V\nH \nor human V\nL\n). In embodiments, the polypeptide display system comprises a repertoire of polypeptides wherein each polypeptide comprises an antibody variable domain. For example, each polypeptide in the repertoire can contain a V\nH\n, a V\nL \nor an Fv (e.g., a single chain Fv).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmino acid sequence diversity can be introduced into any desired region of a peptide or polypeptide or scaffold using any suitable method. For example, amino acid sequence diversity can be introduced into a target region, such as a complementarity determining region of an antibody variable domain or a hydrophobic domain, by preparing a library of nucleic acids that encode the diversified polypeptides using any suitable mutagenesis methods (e.g., low fidelity PCR, oligonucleotide-mediated or site directed mutagenesis, diversification using NNK codons) or any other suitable method. If desired, a region of a polypeptide to be diversified can be randomized.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe size of the polypeptides that make up the repertoire is largely a matter of choice and uniform polypeptide size is not required. In one embodiment, the polypeptides in the repertoire have at least tertiary structure (form at least one domain).\n\n\n \nSelection/Isolation/Recovery\n\n\n \n \n \nA protease resistant peptide or polypeptide (e.g., a population of protease resistant polypeptides) can be selected, isolated and/or recovered from a repertoire or library (e.g., in a display system) using any suitable method. In one embodiment, a protease resistant polypeptide is selected or isolated based on a selectable characteristic (e.g., physical characteristic, chemical characteristic, functional characteristic). Suitable selectable functional characteristics include biological activities of the peptides or polypeptides in the repertoire, for example, binding to a generic ligand (e.g., a superantigen), binding to a target ligand (e.g., an antigen, an epitope, a substrate), binding to an antibody (e.g., through an epitope expressed on a peptide or polypeptide), and catalytic activity. (See, e.g., Tomlinson et al., WO 99/20749; WO 01/57065; WO 99/58655). In one embodiment, the selection is based on specific binding to TNFR1. In another embodiment, selection is on the basis of the selected functional characteristic to produce a second repertoire in which members are protease resistant, followed by selection of a member from the second repertoire that specifically binds TNFR1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the protease resistant peptide or polypeptide is selected and/or isolated from a library or repertoire of peptides or polypeptides in which substantially all protease resistant peptides or polypeptides share a common selectable feature. For example, the protease resistant peptide or polypeptide can be selected from a library or repertoire in which substantially all protease resistant peptides or polypeptides bind a common generic ligand, bind a common target ligand, bind (or are bound by) a common antibody, or possess a common catalytic activity. This type of selection is particularly useful for preparing a repertoire of protease resistant peptides or polypeptides that are based on a parental peptide or polypeptide that has a desired biological activity, for example, when performing affinity maturation of an immunoglobulin single variable domain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSelection based on binding to a common generic ligand can yield a collection or population of peptides or polypeptides that contain all or substantially all of the protease resistant peptides or polypeptides that were components of the original library or repertoire. For example, peptides or polypeptides that bind a target ligand or a generic ligand, such as protein A, protein L or an antibody, can be selected, isolated and/or recovered by panning or using a suitable affinity matrix. Panning can be accomplished by adding a solution of ligand (e.g., generic ligand, target ligand) to a suitable vessel (e.g., tube, petri dish) and allowing the ligand to become deposited or coated onto the walls of the vessel. Excess ligand can be washed away and peptides or polypeptides (e.g., a repertoire that has been incubated with protease) can be added to the vessel and the vessel maintained under conditions suitable for peptides or polypeptides to bind the immobilized ligand. Unbound peptides or polypeptides can be washed away and bound peptides or polypeptides can be recovered using any suitable method, such as scraping or lowering the pH, for example.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable ligand affinity matrices generally contain a solid support or bead (e.g., agarose) to which a ligand is covalently or noncovalently attached. The affinity matrix can be combined with peptides or polypeptides (e.g., a repertoire that has been incubated with protease) using a batch process, a column process or any other suitable process under conditions suitable for binding of peptides or polypeptides to the ligand on the matrix. Peptides or polypeptides that do not bind the affinity matrix can be washed away and bound peptides or polypeptides can be eluted and recovered using any suitable method, such as elution with a lower pH buffer, with a mild denaturing agent (e.g., urea), or with a peptide that competes for binding to the ligand. In one example, a biotinylated target ligand is combined with a repertoire under conditions suitable for peptides or polypeptides in the repertoire to bind the target ligand (TNFR1). Bound peptides or polypeptides are recovered using immobilized avidin or streptavidin (e.g., on a bead).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the generic ligand is an antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof. Antibodies or antigen binding fragments that bind structural features of peptides or polypeptides that are substantially conserved in the peptides or polypeptides of a library or repertoire are particularly useful as generic ligands. Antibodies and antigen binding fragments suitable for use as ligands for isolating, selecting and/or recovering protease resistant peptides or polypeptides can be monoclonal or polyclonal and can be prepared using any suitable method.\n\n\n \nLibraries/Repertoires\n\n\n \n \n \nIn other aspects, there are provided repertoires of protease resistant peptides and polypeptides, to libraries that encode protease resistant peptides and polypeptides, and to methods for producing such libraries and repertoires.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLibraries that encode and/or contain protease resistant peptides and polypeptides can be prepared or obtained using any suitable method. The library can be designed to encode protease resistant peptides or polypeptides based on a peptide or polypeptide of interest (e.g., an anti-TNFR1 peptide or polypeptide selected from a library) or can be selected from another library using the methods described herein. For example, a library enriched in protease resistant polypeptides can be prepared using a suitable polypeptide display system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one example, a phage display library comprising a repertoire of displayed polypeptides comprising immunoglobulin single variable domains (e.g., V\nH\n, Vk, Vλ) is combined with a protease under conditions suitable for protease activity, as described herein. Protease resistant polypeptides are recovered based on a desired biological activity, such as a binding activity (e.g., binding generic ligand, binding target ligand) thereby yielding a phage display library enriched in protease resistant polypeptides. In one embodiment, the recovery is on the basis of binding generic ligand to yield an enriched library, followed by selection of an anti-TNFR1 member of that library based on specific binding to TNFR1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another example, a phage display library comprising a repertoire of displayed polypeptides comprising immunoglobulin single variable domains (e.g., V\nH\n, Vκ, Vλ) is first screened to identify members of the repertoire that have binding specificity for a desired target antigen (TNFR1). A collection of polypeptides having the desired binding specificity are recovered and the collection is combined with protease under conditions suitable for proteolytic activity, as described herein. A collection of protease resistant polypeptides that have the desired target binding specificity is recovered, yielding a library enriched in protease resistant and high affinity polypeptides. As described herein in an embodiment, protease resistance in this selection method correlates with high affinity binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLibraries that encode a repertoire of a desired type of polypeptides can readily be produced using any suitable method. For example, a nucleic acid sequence that encodes a desired type of polypeptide (e.g., a polymerase, an immunoglobulin variable domain) can be obtained and a collection of nucleic acids that each contain one or more mutations can be prepared, for example by amplifying the nucleic acid using an error-prone polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system, by chemical mutagenesis (Deng et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem., \n269:9533 (1994)) or using bacterial mutator strains (Low et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol., \n260:359 (1996)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, particular regions of the nucleic acid can be targeted for diversification. Methods for mutating selected positions are also well known in the art and include, for example, the use of mismatched oligonucleotides or degenerate oligonucleotides, with or without the use of PCR. For example, synthetic antibody libraries have been created by targeting mutations to the antigen binding loops. Random or semi-random antibody H3 and L3 regions have been appended to germline immunoblulin V gene segments to produce large libraries with unmutated framework regions (Hoogenboom and Winter (1992) supra; Nissim et al. (1994) supra; Griffiths et al. (1994) supra; DeKruif et al. (1995) supra). Such diversification has been extended to include some or all of the other antigen binding loops (Crameri et al. (1996) \nNature Med., \n2:100; Riechmann et al. (1995) \nBio/Technology, \n13:475; Morphosys, WO 97/08320, supra). In other embodiments, particular regions of the nucleic acid can be targeted for diversification by, for example, a two-step PCR strategy employing the product of the first PCR as a “mega-primer.” (See, e.g., Landt, O. et al., \nGene \n96:125-128 (1990).) Targeted diversification can also be accomplished, for example, by SOE PCR. (See, e.g., Horton, R. M. et al., \nGene \n77:61-68 (1989).)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSequence diversity at selected positions can be achieved by altering the coding sequence which specifies the sequence of the polypeptide such that a number of possible amino acids (e.g., all 20 or a subset thereof) can be incorporated at that position. Using the IUPAC nomenclature, the most versatile codon is NNK, which encodes all amino acids as well as the TAG stop codon. The NNK codon may be used in order to introduce the required diversity. Other codons which achieve the same ends are also of use, including the NNN codon, which leads to the production of the additional stop codons TGA and TAA. Such a targeted approach can allow the full sequence space in a target area to be explored.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe libraries can comprise protease resistant antibody polypeptides that have a known main-chain conformation. (See, e.g., Tomlinson et al., WO 99/20749.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLibraries can be prepared in a suitable plasmid or vector. As used herein, vector refers to a discrete element that is used to introduce heterologous DNA into cells for the expression and/or replication thereof. Any suitable vector can be used, including plasmids (e.g., bacterial plasmids), viral or bacteriophage vectors, artificial chromosomes and episomal vectors. Such vectors may be used for simple cloning and mutagenesis, or an expression vector can be used to drive expression of the library. Vectors and plasmids usually contain one or more cloning sites (e.g., a polylinker), an origin of replication and at least one selectable marker gene. Expression vectors can further contain elements to drive transcription and translation of a polypeptide, such as an enhancer element, promoter, transcription termination signal, signal sequences, and the like. These elements can be arranged in such a way as to be operably linked to a cloned insert encoding a polypeptide, such that the polypeptide is expressed and produced when such an expression vector is maintained under conditions suitable for expression (e.g., in a suitable host cell).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCloning and expression vectors generally contain nucleic acid sequences that enable the vector to replicate in one or more selected host cells. Typically in cloning vectors, this sequence is one that enables the vector to replicate independently of the host chromosomal DNA and includes origins of replication or autonomously replicating sequences. Such sequences are well known for a variety of bacteria, yeast and viruses. The origin of replication from the plasmid pBR322 is suitable for most Gram-negative bacteria, the 2 micron plasmid origin is suitable for yeast, and various viral origins (e.g. SV40, adenovirus) are useful for cloning vectors in mammalian cells. Generally, the origin of replication is not needed for mammalian expression vectors, unless these are used in mammalian cells able to replicate high levels of DNA, such as COS cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCloning or expression vectors can contain a selection gene also referred to as selectable marker. Such marker genes encode a protein necessary for the survival or growth of transformed host cells grown in a selective culture medium. Host cells not transformed with the vector containing the selection gene will therefore not survive in the culture medium. Typical selection genes encode proteins that confer resistance to antibiotics and other toxins, e.g. ampicillin, neomycin, methotrexate or tetracycline, complement auxotrophic deficiencies, or supply critical nutrients not available in the growth media.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable expression vectors can contain a number of components, for example, an origin of replication, a selectable marker gene, one or more expression control elements, such as a transcription control element (e.g., promoter, enhancer, terminator) and/or one or more translation signals, a signal sequence or leader sequence, and the like. Expression control elements and a signal or leader sequence, if present, can be provided by the vector or other source. For example, the transcriptional and/or translational control sequences of a cloned nucleic acid encoding an antibody chain can be used to direct expression.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA promoter can be provided for expression in a desired host cell. Promoters can be constitutive or inducible. For example, a promoter can be operably linked to a nucleic acid encoding an antibody, antibody chain or portion thereof, such that it directs transcription of the nucleic acid. A variety of suitable promoters for procaryotic (e.g., the β-lactamase and lactose promoter systems, alkaline phosphatase, the tryptophan (trp) promoter system, lac, tac, T3, T7 promoters for \nE. coli\n) and eucaryotic (e.g., \nsimian virus\n 40 early or late promoter, Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat promoter, cytomegalovirus promoter, adenovirus late promoter, EG-1a promoter) hosts are available.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, expression vectors typically comprise a selectable marker for selection of host cells carrying the vector, and, in the case of a replicable expression vector, an origin of replication. Genes encoding products which confer antibiotic or drug resistance are common selectable markers and may be used in procaryotic (e.g., β-lactamase gene (ampicillin resistance), Tet gene for tetracycline resistance) and eucaryotic cells (e.g., neomycin (G418 or geneticin), gpt (mycophenolic acid), ampicillin, or hygromycin resistance genes). Dihydrofolate reductase marker genes permit selection with methotrexate in a variety of hosts. Genes encoding the gene product of auxotrophic markers of the host (e.g., LEU2, URA3, HIS3) are often used as selectable markers in yeast. Use of viral (e.g., baculovirus) or phage vectors, and vectors which are capable of integrating into the genome of the host cell, such as retroviral vectors, are also contemplated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable expression vectors for expression in prokaryotic (e.g., bacterial cells such as \nE. coli\n) or mammalian cells include, for example, a pET vector (e.g., pET-12a, pET-36, pET-37, pET-39, pET-40, Novagen and others), a phage vector (e.g., pCANTAB 5 E, Pharmacia), pRIT2T (Protein A fusion vector, Pharmacia), pCDM8, pCDNA1.1/amp, pcDNA3.1, pRc/RSV, pEF-1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.), pCMV-SCRIPT, pFB, pSG5, pXT1 (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.), pCDEF3 (Goldman, L. A., et al., \nBiotechniques, \n21:1013-1015 (1996)), pSVSPORT (GibcoBRL, Rockville, Md.), pEF-Bos (Mizushima, S., et al., \nNucleic Acids Res., \n18:5322 (1990)) and the like. Expression vectors which are suitable for use in various expression hosts, such as prokaryotic cells (\nE. coli\n), insect cells (\nDrosophila \nSchnieder S2 cells, Sf9), yeast (\nP. methanolica, P. pastoris, S. cerevisiae\n) and mammalian cells (eg, COS cells) are available.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of vectors are expression vectors that enable the expression of a nucleotide sequence corresponding to a polypeptide library member. Thus, selection with generic and/or target ligands can be performed by separate propagation and expression of a single clone expressing the polypeptide library member. As described above, the selection display system may be bacteriophage display. Thus, phage or phagemid vectors may be used. Example vectors are phagemid vectors which have an \nE. coli\n. origin of replication (for double stranded replication) and also a phage origin of replication (for production of single-stranded DNA). The manipulation and expression of such vectors is well known in the art (Hoogenboom and Winter (1992) supra; Nissim et al. (1994) supra). Briefly, the vector can contain a β-lactamase gene to confer selectivity on the phagemid and a lac promoter upstream of an expression cassette that can contain a suitable leader sequence, a multiple cloning site, one or more peptide tags, one or more TAG stop codons and the phage protein pIII. Thus, using various suppressor and non-suppressor strains of \nE. coli \nand with the addition of glucose, isopropyl thio-β-D-galactoside (IPTG) or a helper phage, such as VCS M13, the vector is able to replicate as a plasmid with no expression, produce large quantities of the polypeptide library member only or product phage, some of which contain at least one copy of the polypeptide-pIII fusion on their surface.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe libraries and repertoires described herein can contain antibody formats. For example, the polypeptide contained within the libraries and repertoires can be whole separate V\nH \nor V\nL \ndomains, any of which are either modified or unmodified. scFv fragments, as well as other antibody polypeptides, can be readily produced using any suitable method. A number of suitable antibody engineering methods are well known in the art. For example, a scFv can be formed by linking nucleic acids encoding two variable domains with a suitable oligonucleotide that encodes an appropriate linker peptide, such as (Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser)\n3 \nor other suitable linker peptides. The linker bridges the C-terminal end of the first V region and the N-terminal end of the second V region. Similar techniques for the construction of other antibody formats, such as Fv, Fab and F(ab′)\n2 \nfragments can be used. To format Fab and F(ab′)\n2 \nfragments, V\nH \nand V\nL \npolypeptides can be combined with constant region segments, which may be isolated from rearranged genes, germline C genes or synthesized from antibody sequence data. A library or repertoire described herein can be a V\nH \nor V\nL \nlibrary or repertoire.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe polypeptides comprising a protease resistant variable domain may comprise a target ligand (TNFR1) binding site and a generic ligand binding site. In certain embodiments, the generic ligand binding site is a binding site for a superantigen, such as protein A, protein L or protein G. The variable domains can be based on any desired variable domain, for example a human VH (e.g., V\nH \n1a, V\nH \n1b, \nV\n \n \n \nH \n2, \nV\n \n \n \nH \n3, \nV\n \n \n \nH \n4, \nV\n \n \n \nH \n5, V\nH \n6), a human Vλ (e.g., VλI, VλII, VλIII, VλIV, VλV, VλVI or Vκ1) or a human Vκ (e.g., Vκ2, Vκ3, Vκ4, Vκ5, Vκ6, Vκ7, Vκ8, Vκ9 or Vκ10) or a Camelid V\nHH\n, optionally that has been humanized.\n\n\n \nNucleic Acids, Host Cells and Methods for Producing Protease Resistant Polypeptides\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention relates to isolated and/or recombinant nucleic acids encoding protease resistant peptides or polypeptides e.g., that are selectable or selected by the methods described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acids referred to herein as “isolated” are nucleic acids which have been separated away from other material (e.g., other nucleic acids such as genomic DNA, cDNA and/or RNA) in its original environment (e.g., in cells or in a mixture of nucleic acids such as a library). An isolated nucleic acid can be isolated as part of a vector (e.g., a plasmid).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acids referred to herein as “recombinant” are nucleic acids which have been produced by recombinant DNA methodology, including methods which rely upon artificial recombination, such as cloning into a vector or chromosome using, for example, restriction enzymes, homologous recombination, viruses and the like, and nucleic acids prepared using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also relates to a recombinant host cell which comprises a (one or more) recombinant nucleic acid or expression construct comprising a nucleic acid encoding a protease resistant peptide or polypeptide, e.g., a peptide or polypeptide selectable or selected by the methods described herein. There is also provided a method of preparing a protease resistant peptide or polypeptide, comprising maintaining a recombinant host cell of the invention under conditions appropriate for expression of a protease resistant peptide or polypeptide. The method can further comprise the step of isolating or recovering the protease resistant peptide or polypeptide, if desired.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, a nucleic acid molecule (i.e., one or more nucleic acid molecules) encoding a protease resistant peptide or polypeptide, or an expression construct (i.e., one or more constructs) comprising such nucleic acid molecule(s), can be introduced into a suitable host cell to create a recombinant host cell using any method appropriate to the host cell selected (e.g., transformation, transfection, electroporation, infection), such that the nucleic acid molecule(s) are operably linked to one or more expression control elements (e.g., in a vector, in a construct created by processes in the cell, integrated into the host cell genome). The resulting recombinant host cell can be maintained under conditions suitable for expression (e.g., in the presence of an inducer, in a suitable animal, in suitable culture media supplemented with appropriate salts, growth factors, antibiotics, nutritional supplements, etc.), whereby the encoded peptide or polypeptide is produced. If desired, the encoded peptide or polypeptide can be isolated or recovered (e.g., from the animal, the host cell, medium, milk). This process encompasses expression in a host cell of a transgenic animal (see, e.g., WO 92/03918, GenPharm International).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe protease resistant peptide or polypeptide selected by the method described herein can also be produced in a suitable in vitro expression system, by chemical synthesis or by any other suitable method. Thus, the present invention provides for protease resistant peptides and polypeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolypeptides, dAbs & Antagonists\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs described and exemplified herein, protease resistant dAbs of the invention generally bind their target ligand with high affinity. Thus, in another aspect, there is provided a method for selecting, isolating and/or recovering a polypeptide or dAb of the invention that binds TNFR1 with high affinity. Generally, the method comprises providing a library or repertoire of peptides or polypeptides (eg dAbs), combining the library or repertoire with a protease (e.g., trypsin, elastase, leucozyme, pancreatin, sputum) under conditions suitable for protease activity, and selecting, isolating and/or recovering a peptide or polypeptide that binds a ligand (e.g., target ligand). Because the library or repertoire has been exposed to protease under conditions where protease sensitive peptides or polypeptides will be digested, the activity of protease can eliminate the less stable polypeptides that have low binding affinity, and thereby produce a collection of high affinity binding peptides or polypeptides. For example, the polypeptide or dAb of the invention can bind TNFR1 with an affinity (K\nD\n; K\nD\n=K\noff\n(kd)/K\non\n(ka) as determined by surface plasmon resonance) of 1 μM or stronger, or about 500 nM to about 0.5 pM. For example, the polypeptide or dAb of the invention can bind TNFR1 with an affinity of about 500 nM, about 100 nM, about 10 nM, about 1 nM, about 500 pM, about 100 pM, about 10 pM, about 1 pM or about 0.5 pM. Although we are not bound by any particular theory, peptides and polypeptides that are resistant to proteases are believed to have a lower entropy and/or a higher stabilization energy. Thus, the correlation between protease resistance and high affinity binding may be related to the compactness and stability of the surfaces of the peptides and polypeptides and dAbs selected by the method described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the polypeptide, dAb or antagonist of the invention inhibits binding of TNF alpha to TNF alpha Receptor I (p55 receptor) with an inhibitory concentration 50 (IC50) of or about 500 nM to 50 pM, or 100 nM to 50 pM, or 10 nM to 100 pM, or 1 nM to 100 pM; for example 50 nM or less, or 5 nM or less, or 500 pM or less, or 200 pM or less, or 100 pM or less.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the polypeptide, dAb or antagonist specifically binds TNFR1, eg, human TNFRI, and dissociates from human TNFR1 with a dissociation constant (K\nD\n) of 300 nM to 1 pM or 300 nM to 5 pM or 50 nM to 1 pM or 50 nM to 5 pM or 50 nM to 20 pM or about 10 pM or about 15 pM or about 20 pM as determined by surface plasmon resonance. In certain embodiments, the polypeptide, dAb or antagonist specifically binds TNFR1, eg, human TNFR1, and dissociates from human TNFR1 with a K\noff \nrate constant of 5×10\n−1 \ns\n−1 \nto 1×10\n−7 \ns\n−1 \nor 1×10\n−3 \ns\n−1 \nto 1×10\n−7 \ns\n−1 \nor 1×10\n−4 \ns\n−1 \nto 1×10\n−7 \ns\n−1 \nor 1×10\n−5 \ns\n−1 \nto 1×10\n−7 \ns\n−1 \nor 1×10\n−4 \ns\n−1 \nor 1×10\n−5 \ns\n−1 \nas determined by surface plasmon resonance. In certain embodiments, the polypeptide, dAb or antagonist specifically binds TNFR1, eg, human TNFR1, with a K\non \nof 1×10\n−3 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1 \nto 1×10\n−7 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1 \nor 1×10\n−3 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1 \nto 1×10\n−6 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1 \nor about 1×10\n−4 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1 \nor about 1×10\n−5 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1\n. In one embodiment, the polypeptide, dAb or antagonist specifically binds TNFR1, eg, human TNFR1, and dissociates from human TNFR1 with a dissociation constant (K\nD\n) and a K\noff \nas defined in this paragraph. In one embodiment, the polypeptide, dAb or antagonist specifically binds TNFR1, eg, human TNFR1, and dissociates from human TNFR1 with a dissociation constant (K\nD\n) and a K\non \nas defined in this paragraph. In some embodiments, the polypeptide or dAb specifically binds TNFR1 (eg, human TNFR1) with a K\nD \nand/or K\noff \nand/or K\non \nas recited in this paragraph and comprises an amino acid sequence that is at least or at least about 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical to the amino acid sequence of DOM1h-131-206 (shown in \nFIG. 3\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe polypeptide, dAb or antagonist can be expressed in \nE. coli \nor in \nPichia \nspecies (e.g., \nP. pastoris\n). In one embodiment, the ligand or dAb monomer is secreted in a quantity of at least about 0.5 mg/L when expressed in \nE. coli \nor in \nPichia \nspecies (e.g., \nP. pastoris\n). Although, the ligands and dAb monomers described herein can be secretable when expressed in \nE. coli \nor in \nPichia \nspecies (e.g., \nP. pastoris\n), they can be produced using any suitable method, such as synthetic chemical methods or biological production methods that do not employ \nE. coli \nor \nPichia \nspecies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the polypeptide, dAb or antagonist does not comprise a Camelid immunoglobulin variable domain, or one or more framework amino acids that are unique to immunoglobulin variable domains encoded by Camelid germline antibody gene segments, eg at \nposition\n 108, 37, 44, 45 and/or 47.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntagonists of TNFR1 according to the invention can be monovalent or multivalent. In some embodiments, the antagonist is monovalent and contains one binding site that interacts with TNFR1, the binding site provided by a polypeptide or dAb of the invention. Monovalent antagonists bind one TNFR1 and may not induce cross-linking or clustering of TNFR1 on the surface of cells which can lead to activation of the receptor and signal transduction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the antagonist of TNFR1 is multivalent. Multivalent antagonists of TNFR1 can contain two or more copies of a particular binding site for TNFR1 or contain two or more different binding sites that bind TNFR1, at least one of the binding sites being provided by a polypeptide or dAb of the invention. For example, as described herein the antagonist of TNFR1 can be a dimer, trimer or multimer comprising two or more copies of a particular polypeptide or dAb of the invention that binds TNFR1, or two or more different polypeptides or dAbs of the invention that bind TNFR1. In one embodiment, a multivalent antagonist of TNFR1 does not substantially agonize TNFR1 (act as an agonist of TNFR1) in a standard cell assay (i.e., when present at a concentration of 1 nM, 10 nM, 100 nM, 1 μM, 10 μM, 100 μM, 1000 μM or 5,000 μM, results in no more than about 5% of the TNFR1-mediated activity induced by TNFα (100 pg/ml) in the assay).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the multivalent antagonist of TNFR1 contains two or more binding sites for a desired epitope or domain of TNFR1. For example, the multivalent antagonist of TNFR1 can comprise two or more binding sites that bind the same epitope in \nDomain\n 1 of TNFR1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the multivalent antagonist of TNFR1 contains two or more binding sites provided by polypeptides or dAbs of the invention that bind to different epitopes or domains of TNFR1. In one embodiment, such multivalent antagonists do not agonize TNFR1 when present at a concentration of about 1 nM, or about 10 nM, or about 100 nM, or about 1 μM, or about 10 μM, in a standard L929 cytotoxicity assay or a standard HeLa IL-8 assay as described in WO2006038027.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther antagonists of TNFR1 do no inhibit binding of TNFα to TNFR1. Such ligands (and antagonists) may have utility as diagnostic agents, because they can be used to bind and detect, quantify or measure TNFR1 in a sample and will not compete with TNF in the sample for binding to TNFR1. Accordingly, an accurate determination of whether or how much TNFR1 is in the sample can be made.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the polypeptide, dAb or antagonist specifically binds TNFR1 with a K\nD \ndescribed herein and inhibits lethality in a standard mouse LPS/D-galactosamine-induced septic shock model (i.e., prevents lethality or reduces lethality by at least about 10%, as compared with a suitable control). In one embodiment, the polypeptide, dAb or antagonist inhibits lethality by at least about 25%, or by at least about 50%, as compared to a suitable control in a standard mouse LPS/D-galactosamine-induced septic shock model when administered at about 5 mg/kg or more, for example about 1 mg/kg.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the polypeptide, dAb or antagonist binds TNFR1 and antagonizes the activity of the TNFR1 in a standard cell assay with an ND\n50 \nof ≦100 nM, and at a concentration of ≦10 μM the dAb agonizes the activity of the TNFR1 by ≦5% in the assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular embodiments, the polypeptide, dAb or antagonist does not substantially agonize TNFR1 (act as an agonist of TNFR1) in a standard cell assay (i.e., when present at a concentration of 1 nM, 10 nM, 100 nM, 1 μM, 10 μM, 100 μM, 1000 μM or 5,000 μM, results in no more than about 5% of the TNFR1-mediated activity induced by TNFα (100 pg/ml) in the assay).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the polypeptide, dAb or antagonist of the invention are efficacious in models of chronic inflammatory diseases when an effective amount is administered. Generally an effective amount is about 1 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg (e.g., about 1 mg/kg, about 2 mg/kg, about 3 mg/kg, about 4 mg/kg, about 5 mg/kg, about 6 mg/kg, about 7 mg/kg, about 8 mg/kg, about 9 mg/kg, or about 10 mg/kg). The models of chronic inflammatory disease (see those described in WO2006038027) are recognized by those skilled in the art as being predictive of therapeutic efficacy in humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular embodiments, the polypeptide, dAb or antagonist is efficacious in the standard mouse collagen-induced arthritis model (see WO2006038027 for details of the model). For example, administering an effective amount of the polypeptide, dAb or antagonist can reduce the average arthritic score of the summation of the four limbs in the standard mouse collagen-induced arthritis model, for example, by about 1 to about 16, about 3 to about 16, about 6 to about 16, about 9 to about 16, or about 12 to about 16, as compared to a suitable control. In another example, administering an effective amount of the polypeptide, dAb or antagonist can delay the onset of symptoms of arthritis in the standard mouse collagen-induced arthritis model, for example, by about 1 day, about 2 days, about 3 days, about 4 days, about 5 days, about 6 days, about 7 days, about 10 days, about 14 days, about 21 days or about 28 days, as compared to a suitable control. In another example, administering an effective amount of the polypeptide, dAb or antagonist can result in an average arthritic score of the summation of the four limbs in the standard mouse collagen-induced arthritis model of 0 to about 3, about 3 to about 5, about 5 to about 7, about 7 to about 15, about 9 to about 15, about 10 to about 15, about 12 to about 15, or about 14 to about 15.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the polypeptide, dAb or antagonist is efficacious in the mouse ΔARE model of arthritis (see WO2006038027 for details of the model). For example, administering an effective amount of the polypeptide, dAb or antagonist can reduce the average arthritic score in the mouse ΔARE model of arthritis, for example, by about 0.1 to about 2.5, about 0.5 to about 2.5, about 1 to about 2.5, about 1.5 to about 2.5, or about 2 to about 2.5, as compared to a suitable control. In another example, administering an effective amount of the polypeptide, dAb or antagonist can delay the onset of symptoms of arthritis in the mouse ΔARE model of arthritis by, for example, about 1 day, about 2 days, about 3 days, about 4 days, about 5 days, about 6 days, about 7 days, about 10 days, about 14 days, about 21 days or about 28 days, as compared to a suitable control. In another example, administering an effective amount of the polypeptide, dAb or antagonist can result in an average arthritic score in the mouse ΔARE model of arthritis of 0 to about 0.5, about 0.5 to about 1, about 1 to about 1.5, about 1.5 to about 2, or about 2 to about 2.5.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the polypeptide, dAb or antagonist is efficacious in the mouse ΔARE model of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (see WO2006038027 for details of the model). For example, administering an effective amount of the polypeptide, dAb or antagonist can reduce the average acute and/or chronic inflammation score in the mouse ΔARE model of IBD, for example, by about 0.1 to about 2.5, about 0.5 to about 2.5, about 1 to about 2.5, about 1.5 to about 2.5, or about 2 to about 2.5, as compared to a suitable control. In another example, administering an effective amount of the polypeptide, dAb or antagonist can delay the onset of symptoms of IBD in the mouse ΔARE model of IBD by, for example, about 1 day, about 2 days, about 3 days, about 4 days, about 5 days, about 6 days, about 7 days, about 10 days, about 14 days, about 21 days or about 28 days, as compared to a suitable control. In another example, administering an effective amount of the polypeptide, dAb or antagonist can result in an average acute and/or chronic inflammation score in the mouse ΔARE model of IBD of 0 to about 0.5, about 0.5 to about 1, about 1 to about 1.5, about 1.5 to about 2, or about 2 to about 2.5.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the polypeptide, dAb or antagonist is efficacious in the mouse dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) induced model of IBD (see WO2006038027 for details of the model). For example, administering an effective amount of the polypeptide, dAb or antagonist can reduce the average severity score in the mouse DSS model of IBD, for example, by about 0.1 to about 2.5, about 0.5 to about 2.5, about 1 to about 2.5, about 1.5 to about 2.5, or about 2 to about 2.5, as compared to a suitable control. In another example, administering an effective amount of the polypeptide, dAb or antagonist can delay the onset of symptoms of IBD in the mouse DSS model of IBD by, for example, about 1 day, about 2 days, about 3 days, about 4 days, about 5 days, about 6 days, about 7 days, about 10 days, about 14 days, about 21 days or about 28 days, as compared to a suitable control. In another example, administering an effective amount of the polypeptide, dAb or antagonist can result in an average severity score in the mouse DSS model of IBD of 0 to about 0.5, about 0.5 to about 1, about 1 to about 1.5, about 1.5 to about 2, or about 2 to about 2.5.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular embodiments, the polypeptide, dAb or antagonist is efficacious in the mouse tobacco smoke model of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (see WO2006038027 and WO2007049017 for details of the model). For example, administering an effective amount of the ligand can reduce or delay onset of the symptoms of COPD, as compared to a suitable control.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnimal model systems which can be used to screen the effectiveness of the antagonists of TNFR1 (e.g, ligands, antibodies or binding proteins thereof) in protecting against or treating the disease are available. Methods for the testing of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in susceptible mice are known in the art (Knight et al. (1978) \nJ. Exp. Med., \n147: 1653; Reinersten et al. (1978) \nNew Eng. J. Med., \n299: 515). Myasthenia Gravis (MG) is tested in SJL/J female mice by inducing the disease with soluble AchR protein from another species (Lindstrom et al. (1988) \nAdv. Immunol., \n42: 233). Arthritis is induced in a susceptible strain of mice by injection of Type II collagen (Stuart et al. (1984) \nAnn. Rev. Immunol., \n42: 233). A model by which adjuvant arthritis is induced in susceptible rats by injection of mycobacterial heat shock protein has been described (Van Eden et al. (1988) \nNature, \n331: 171). Thyroiditis is induced in mice by administration of thyroglobulin as described (Maron et al. (1980) \nJ. Exp. Med., \n152: 1115). Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) occurs naturally or can be induced in certain strains of mice such as those described by Kanasawa et al. (1984) \nDiabetologia, \n27: 113. EAE in mouse and rat serves as a model for MS in human. In this model, the demyelinating disease is induced by administration of myelin basic protein (see Paterson (1986) \nTextbook of Immunopathology\n, Mischer et al., eds., Grune and Stratton, New York, pp. 179-213; McFarlin et al. (1973) \nScience, \n179: 478: and Satoh et al. (1987) \nJ. Immunol., \n138: 179).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, the present ligands (e.g., antagonists) will be utilised in purified form together with pharmacologically appropriate carriers. Typically, these carriers include aqueous or alcoholic/aqueous solutions, emulsions or suspensions, any including saline and/or buffered media. Parenteral vehicles include sodium chloride solution, Ringer's dextrose, dextrose and sodium chloride and lactated Ringer's. Suitable physiologically-acceptable adjuvants, if necessary to keep a polypeptide complex in suspension, may be chosen from thickeners such as carboxymethylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gelatin and alginates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntravenous vehicles include fluid and nutrient replenishers and electrolyte replenishers, such as those based on Ringer's dextrose. Preservatives and other additives, such as antimicrobials, antioxidants, chelating agents and inert gases, may also be present (Mack (1982) \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, \n16th Edition). A variety of suitable formulations can be used, including extended release formulations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ligands (e.g., antagonits) of the present invention may be used as separately administered compositions or in conjunction with other agents. These can include various immunotherapeutic drugs, such as cyclosporine, methotrexate, adriamycin or cisplatinum, and immunotoxins. Pharmaceutical compositions can include “cocktails” of various cytotoxic or other agents in conjunction with the ligands of the present invention, or even combinations of ligands according to the present invention having different specificities, such as ligands selected using different target antigens or epitopes, whether or not they are pooled prior to administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe route of administration of pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention may be any of those commonly known to those of ordinary skill in the art. For therapy, including without limitation immunotherapy, the selected ligands thereof of the invention can be administered to any patient in accordance with standard techniques.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe administration can be by any appropriate mode, including parenterally, intravenously, intramuscularly, intraperitoneally, transdermally, via the pulmonary route, or also, appropriately, by direct infusion with a catheter. The dosage and frequency of administration will depend on the age, sex and condition of the patient, concurrent administration of other drugs, counterindications and other parameters to be taken into account by the clinician. Administration can be local (e.g., local delivery to the lung by pulmonary administration, e.g., intranasal administration) or systemic as indicated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ligands of this invention can be lyophilised for storage and reconstituted in a suitable carrier prior to use. This technique has been shown to be effective with conventional immunoglobulins and art-known lyophilisation and reconstitution techniques can be employed. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that lyophilisation and reconstitution can lead to varying degrees of antibody activity loss (e.g. with conventional immunoglobulins, IgM antibodies tend to have greater activity loss than IgG antibodies) and that use levels may have to be adjusted upward to compensate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions containing the present ligands (e.g., antagonists) or a cocktail thereof can be administered for prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatments. In certain therapeutic applications, an adequate amount to accomplish at least partial inhibition, suppression, modulation, killing, or some other measurable parameter, of a population of selected cells is defined as a “therapeutically-effective dose”. Amounts needed to achieve this dosage will depend upon the severity of the disease and the general state of the patient's own immune system, but generally range from 0.005 to 5.0 mg of ligand, e.g. dAb or antagonist per kilogram of body weight, with doses of 0.05 to 2.0 mg/kg/dose being more commonly used. For prophylactic applications, compositions containing the present ligands or cocktails thereof may also be administered in similar or slightly lower dosages, to prevent, inhibit or delay onset of disease (e.g., to sustain remission or quiescence, or to prevent acute phase). The skilled clinician will be able to determine the appropriate dosing interval to treat, suppress or prevent disease. When a ligand of TNFR1 (e.g., antagonist) is administered to treat, suppress or prevent a chronic inflammatory disease, it can be administered up to four times per day, twice weekly, once weekly, once every two weeks, once a month, or once every two months, at a dose off, for example, about 10 μg/kg to about 80 mg/kg, about 100 μg/kg to about 80 mg/kg, about 1 mg/kg to about 80 mg/kg, about 1 mg/kg to about 70 mg/kg, about 1 mg/kg to about 60 mg/kg, about 1 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg, about 1 mg/kg to about 40 mg/kg, about 1 mg/kg to about 30 mg/kg, about 1 mg/kg to about 20 mg/kg, about 1 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg, about 10 μg/kg to about 10 mg/kg, about 10 μg/kg to about 5 mg/kg, about 10 μg/kg to about 2.5 mg/kg, about 1 mg/kg, about 2 mg/kg, about 3 mg/kg, about 4 mg/kg, about 5 mg/kg, about 6 mg/kg, about 7 mg/kg, about 8 mg/kg, about 9 mg/kg or about 10 mg/kg. In particular embodiments, the ligand of TNFR1 (e.g., antagonist) is administered to treat, suppress or prevent a chronic inflammatory disease once every two weeks or once a month at a dose of about 10 μg/kg to about 10 mg/kg (e.g., about 10 μg/kg, about 100 μg/kg, about 1 mg/kg, about 2 mg/kg, about 3 mg/kg, about 4 mg/kg, about 5 mg/kg, about 6 mg/kg, about 7 mg/kg, about 8 mg/kg, about 9 mg/kg or about 10 mg/kg.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTreatment or therapy performed using the compositions described herein is considered “effective” if one or more symptoms are reduced (e.g., by at least 10% or at least one point on a clinical assessment scale), relative to such symptoms present before treatment, or relative to such symptoms in an individual (human or model animal) not treated with such composition or other suitable control. Symptoms will obviously vary depending upon the disease or disorder targeted, but can be measured by an ordinarily skilled clinician or technician. Such symptoms can be measured, for example, by monitoring the level of one or more biochemical indicators of the disease or disorder (e.g., levels of an enzyme or metabolite correlated with the disease, affected cell numbers, etc.), by monitoring physical manifestations (e.g., inflammation, tumor size, etc.), or by an accepted clinical assessment scale, for example, the Expanded Disability Status Scale (for multiple sclerosis), the Irvine Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (32 point assessment evaluates quality of life with respect to bowel function, systemic symptoms, social function and emotional status—score ranges from 32 to 224, with higher scores indicating a better quality of life), the Quality of Life Rheumatoid Arthritis Scale, or other accepted clinical assessment scale as known in the field. A sustained (e.g., one day or more, or longer) reduction in disease or disorder symptoms by at least 10% or by one or more points on a given clinical scale is indicative of “effective” treatment. Similarly, prophylaxis performed using a composition as described herein is “effective” if the onset or severity of one or more symptoms is delayed, reduced or abolished relative to such symptoms in a similar individual (human or animal model) not treated with the composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA composition containing a ligand (e.g., antagonist) or cocktail thereof according to the present invention may be utilised in prophylactic and therapeutic settings to aid in the alteration, inactivation, killing or removal of a select target cell population in a mammal. In addition, the selected repertoires of polypeptides described herein may be used extracorporeally or in vitro selectively to kill, deplete or otherwise effectively remove a target cell population from a heterogeneous collection of cells. Blood from a mammal may be combined extracorporeally with the ligands whereby the undesired cells are killed or otherwise removed from the blood for return to the mammal in accordance with standard techniques.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA composition containing a ligand (e.g., antagonist) according to the present invention may be utilised in prophylactic and therapeutic settings to aid in the alteration, inactivation, killing or removal of a select target cell population in a mammal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ligands (e.g., anti-TNFR1 antagonists, dAb monomers) can be administered and or formulated together with one or more additional therapeutic or active agents. When a ligand (eg, a dAb) is administered with an additional therapeutic agent, the ligand can be administered before, simultaneously with or subsequent to administration of the additional agent. Generally, the ligand and additional agent are administered in a manner that provides an overlap of therapeutic effect.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the invention is a method for treating, suppressing or preventing a chronic inflammatory disease, comprising administering to a mammal in need thereof a therapeutically-effective dose or amount of a polypeptide, dAb or antagonist of TNFR1 according to the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the invention is a method for treating, suppressing or preventing arthritis (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis) comprising administering to a mammal in need thereof a therapeutically-effective dose or amount of a polypeptide, dAb or antagonist of TNFR1 according to the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the invention is a method for treating, suppressing or preventing psoriasis comprising administering to a mammal in need thereof a therapeutically-effective dose or amount of a polypeptide, dAb or antagonist of TNFR1 according to the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the invention is a method for treating, suppressing or preventing inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis) comprising administering to a mammal in need thereof a therapeutically-effective dose or amount of a polypeptide, dAb or antagonist of TNFR1 according to the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the invention is a method for treating, suppressing or preventing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive bronchitis, emphysema), comprising administering to a mammal in need thereof a therapeutically-effective dose or amount of a polypeptide, dAb or antagonist of TNFR1 according to the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the invention is a method for treating, suppressing or preventing pneumonia (e.g., bacterial pneumonia, such as Staphylococcal pneumonia) comprising administering to a mammal in need thereof a therapeutically-effective dose or amount of a polypeptide, dAb or antagonist of TNFR1 according to the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention provides a method for treating, suppressing or preventing other pulmonary diseases in addition to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and pneumonia. Other pulmonary diseases that can be treated, suppressed or prevented in accordance with the invention include, for example, cystic fibrosis and asthma (e.g., steroid resistant asthma). Thus, in another embodiment, the invention is a method for treating, suppressing or preventing a pulmonary disease (e.g., cystic fibrosis, asthma) comprising administering to a mammal in need thereof a therapeutically-effective dose or amount of a polypeptide, dAb or antagonist of TNFR1 according to the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular embodiments, an antagonist of TNFR1 is administered via pulmonary delivery, such as by inhalation (e.g., intrabronchial, intranasal or oral inhalation, intranasal drops) or by systemic delivery (e.g., parenteral, intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the invention is a method treating, suppressing or preventing septic shock comprising administering to a mammal in need thereof a therapeutically-effective dose or amount of a polypeptide, dAb or antagonist of TNFR1 according to the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a composition comprising a a polypeptide, dAb or antagonist of TNFR1 according to the invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMoreover, the present invention provides a method for the treatment of disease using a polypeptide, dAb or antagonist of TNFR1 or a composition according to the present invention. In an embodiment the disease is cancer or an inflammatory disease, eg rheumatoid arthritis, asthma or Crohn's disease.\n\n\n \nFormats\n\n\n \n \n \nIncreased half-life is useful in in vivo applications of immunoglobulins, especially antibodies and most especially antibody fragments of small size. Such fragments (Fvs, disulphide bonded Fvs, Fabs, scFvs, dAbs) suffer from rapid clearance from the body; thus, whilst they are able to reach most parts of the body rapidly, and are quick to produce and easier to handle, their in vivo applications have been limited by their only brief persistence in vivo. One embodiment of the invention solves this problem by providing increased half-life of the ligands in vivo and consequently longer persistence times in the body of the functional activity of the ligand.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for pharmacokinetic analysis and determination of ligand half-life will be familiar to those skilled in the art. Details may be found in Kenneth, A et al: Chemical Stability of Pharmaceuticals: A Handbook for Pharmacists and in Peters et al, Pharmacokinetc analysis: A Practical Approach (1996). Reference is also made to “Pharmacokinetics”, M Gibaldi & D Perron, published by Marcel Dekker, 2\nnd \nRev. ex edition (1982), which describes pharmacokinetic parameters such as t alpha and t beta half lives and area under the curve (AUC).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHalf lives (t½ alpha and t½ beta) and AUC can be determined from a curve of serum concentration of ligand against time. The WinNonlin analysis package (available from Pharsight Corp., Mountain View, CA94040, USA) can be used, for example, to model the curve. In a first phase (the alpha phase) the ligand is undergoing mainly distribution in the patient, with some elimination. A second phase (beta phase) is the terminal phase when the ligand has been distributed and the serum concentration is decreasing as the ligand is cleared from the patient. The t alpha half life is the half life of the first phase and the t beta half life is the half life of the second phase. Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides a ligand or a composition comprising a ligand according to the invention having a tα half-life in the range of 15 minutes or more. In one embodiment, the lower end of the range is 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, 6 hours, 7 hours, 10 hours, 11 hours or 12 hours. In addition, or alternatively, a ligand or composition according to the invention will have a tα half life in the range of up to and including 12 hours. In one embodiment, the upper end of the range is 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6 or 5 hours. An example of a suitable range is 1 to 6 hours, 2 to 5 hours or 3 to 4 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the present invention provides a ligand (polypeptide, dAb or antagonist) or a composition comprising a ligand according to the invention having a tβ half-life in the range of 2.5 hours or more. In one embodiment, the lower end of the range is 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, 6 hours, 7 hours, 10 hours, 11 hours, or 12 hours. In addition, or alternatively, a ligand or composition according to the invention has a tβ half-life in the range of up to and including 21 days. In one embodiment, the upper end of the range is 12 hours, 24 hours, 2 days, 3 days, 5 days, 10 days, 15 days or 20 days. In one embodiment a ligand or composition according to the invention will have a tβ half life in the \nrange\n 12 to 60 hours. In a further embodiment, it will be in the \nrange\n 12 to 48 hours. In a further embodiment still, it will be in the \nrange\n 12 to 26 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, or alternatively to the above criteria, the present invention provides a ligand or a composition comprising a ligand according to the invention having an AUC value (area under the curve) in the range of 1 mg·min/ml or more. In one embodiment, the lower end of the range is 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 100, 200 or 300 mg·min/ml.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, or alternatively, a ligand or composition according to the invention has an AUC in the range of up to 600 mg·min/ml. In one embodiment, the upper end of the range is 500, 400, 300, 200, 150, 100, 75 or 50 mg·min/ml. In one embodiment a ligand according to the invention will have a AUC in the range selected from the group consisting of the following: 15 to 150 mg·min/ml, 15 to 100 mg min/ml, 15 to 75 mg·min/ml, and 15 to 50 mg·min/ml.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolypeptides and dAbs of the invention and antagonists comprising these can be formatted to have a larger hydrodynamic size, for example, by attachment of a PEG group, serum albumin, transferrin, transferrin receptor or at least the transferrin-binding portion thereof, an antibody Fc region, or by conjugation to an antibody domain. For example, polypeptides dAbs and antagonists formatted as a larger antigen-binding fragment of an antibody or as an antibody (e.g., formatted as a Fab, Fab′, F(ab)\n2\n, F(ab′)\n2\n, IgG, scFv).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHydrodynamic size of the ligands (e.g., dAb monomers and multimers) of the invention may be determined using methods which are well known in the art. For example, gel filtration chromatography may be used to determine the hydrodynamic size of a ligand. Suitable gel filtration matrices for determining the hydrodynamic sizes of ligands, such as cross-linked agarose matrices, are well known and readily available.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe size of a ligand format (e.g., the size of a PEG moiety attached to a dAb monomer), can be varied depending on the desired application. For example, where ligand is intended to leave the circulation and enter into peripheral tissues, it is desirable to keep the hydrodynamic size of the ligand low to facilitate extravazation from the blood stream. Alternatively, where it is desired to have the ligand remain in the systemic circulation for a longer period of time the size of the ligand can be increased, for example by formatting as an Ig like protein.\n\n\n \n \nHalf-Life Extension by Targeting an Antigen or Epitope that Increases Half-Live In Vivo\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe hydrodynamic size of a ligand and its serum half-life can also be increased by conjugating or associating a TNFR1 binding polypeptide, dAb or antagonist of the invention to a binding domain (e.g., antibody or antibody fragment) that binds an antigen or epitope that increases half-live in vivo, as described herein. For example, the TNFR1 binding agent (e.g., polypeptide) can be conjugated or linked to an anti-serum albumin or anti-neonatal Fc receptor antibody or antibody fragment, eg an anti-SA or anti-neonatal Fc receptor dAb, Fab, Fab′ or scFv, or to an anti-SA affibody or anti-neonatal Fc receptor Affibody or an anti-SA avimer, or an anti-SA binding domain which comprises a scaffold selected from, but preferably not limited to, the group consisting of CTLA-4, lipocallin, SpA, an affibody, an avimer, GroEl and fibronectin (see PCT/GB2008/000453 filed 8\nth \nFeb. 2008 for disclosure of these binding domain, which domains and their sequences are incorporated herein by reference and form part of the disclosure of the present text). Conjugating refers to a composition comprising polypeptide, dAb or antagonist of the invention that is bonded (covalently or noncovalently) to a binding domain that binds serum albumin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable polypeptides that enhance serum half-life in vivo include, for example, transferrin receptor specific ligand-neuropharmaceutical agent fusion proteins (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,977,307, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference), brain capillary endothelial cell receptor, transferrin, transferrin receptor (e.g., soluble transferrin receptor), insulin, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF 1) receptor, insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF 2) receptor, insulin receptor, blood coagulation factor X, α1-antitrypsin and HNF 1α. Suitable polypeptides that enhance serum half-life also include alpha-1 glycoprotein (orosomucoid; AAG), alpha-1 antichymotrypsin (ACT), alpha-1 microglobulin (protein HC; AIM), antithrombin III (AT III), apolipoprotein A-1 (Apo A-1), apolipoprotein B (Apo B), ceruloplasmin (Cp), complement component C3 (C3), complement component C4 (C4), C1 esterase inhibitor (C1 INH), C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin (FER), hemopexin (HPX), lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)), mannose-binding protein (MBP), myoglobin (Myo), prealbumin (transthyretin; PAL), retinol-binding protein (RBP), and rheumatoid factor (RF).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable proteins from the extracellular matrix include, for example, collagens, laminins, integrins and fibronectin. Collagens are the major proteins of the extracellular matrix. About 15 types of collagen molecules are currently known, found in different parts of the body, e.g. type I collagen (accounting for 90% of body collagen) found in bone, skin, tendon, ligaments, cornea, internal organs or type II collagen found in cartilage, vertebral disc, notochord, and vitreous humor of the eye.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable proteins from the blood include, for example, plasma proteins (e.g., fibrin, α-2 macroglobulin, serum albumin, fibrinogen (e.g., fibrinogen A, fibrinogen B), serum amyloid protein A, haptoglobin, profilin, ubiquitin, uteroglobulin and β-2-microglobulin), enzymes and enzyme inhibitors (e.g., plasminogen, lysozyme, cystatin C, alpha-1-antitrypsin and pancreatic trypsin inhibitor), proteins of the immune system, such as immunoglobulin proteins (e.g., IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, IgM, immunoglobulin light chains (kappa/lambda)), transport proteins (e.g., retinol binding protein, α-1 microglobulin), defensins (e.g., beta-\ndefensin\n 1, \nneutrophil defensin\n 1, \nneutrophil defensin\n 2 and neutrophil defensin 3) and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable proteins found at the blood brain barrier or in neural tissue include, for example, melanocortin receptor, myelin, ascorbate transporter and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable polypeptides that enhance serum half-life in vivo also include proteins localized to the kidney (e.g., polycystin, type IV collagen, organic anion transporter K1, Heymann's antigen), proteins localized to the liver (e.g., alcohol dehydrogenase, G250), proteins localized to the lung (e.g., secretory component, which binds IgA), proteins localized to the heart (e.g., \nHSP\n 27, which is associated with dilated cardiomyopathy), proteins localized to the skin (e.g., keratin), bone specific proteins such as morphogenic proteins (BMPs), which are a subset of the transforming growth factor β superfamily of proteins that demonstrate osteogenic activity (e.g., BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-5, BMP-6, BMP-7, BMP-8), tumor specific proteins (e.g., trophoblast antigen, herceptin receptor, oestrogen receptor, cathepsins (e.g., cathepsin B, which can be found in liver and spleen)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable disease-specific proteins include, for example, antigens expressed only on activated T-cells, including LAG-3 (lymphocyte activation gene), osteoprotegerin ligand (OPGL; see \nNature \n402, 304-309 (1999)), OX40 (a member of the TNF receptor family, expressed on activated T cells and specifically up-regulated in human T cell leukemia virus type-I (HTLV-I)-producing cells; see \nImmunol. \n165 (1):263-70 (2000)). Suitable disease-specific proteins also include, for example, metalloproteases (associated with arthritis/cancers) including CG6512 \nDrosophila\n, human paraplegin, human FtsH, human AFG3L2, murine ftsH; and angiogenic growth factors, including acidic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-1), basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2), vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular permeability factor (VEGF/VPF), transforming growth factor-α (TGF α), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), angiogenin, interleukin-3 (IL-3), interleukin-8 (IL-8), platelet-derived endothelial growth factor (PD-ECGF), placental growth factor (PlGF), midkine platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF), and fractalkine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable polypeptides that enhance serum half-life in vivo also include stress proteins such as heat shock proteins (HSPs). HSPs are normally found intracellularly. When they are found extracellularly, it is an indicator that a cell has died and spilled out its contents. This unprogrammed cell death (necrosis) occurs when as a result of trauma, disease or injury, extracellular HSPs trigger a response from the immune system. Binding to extracellular HSP can result in localizing the compositions of the invention to a disease site.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable proteins involved in Fc transport include, for example, Brambell receptor (also known as FcRB). This Fc receptor has two functions, both of which are potentially useful for delivery. The functions are (1) transport of IgG from mother to child across the placenta (2) protection of IgG from degradation thereby prolonging its serum half-life. It is thought that the receptor recycles IgG from endosomes. (See, Holliger et al, \nNat Biotechnol \n15(7):632-6 (1997).)\n\n\n \n \ndAbs that Bind Serum Albumin\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention in one embodiment provides a polypeptide or antagonist (e.g., dual specific ligand comprising an anti-TNFR1 dAb (a first dAb)) that binds to TNFR1 and a second dAb that binds serum albumin (SA), the second dAb binding SA with a K\nD \nas determined by surface plasmon resonance of 1 nM to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 100, 200, 300, 400 or 500 μM (i.e., ×10\n−9 \nto 5×10\n−4\n), or 100 nM to 10 μM, or 1 to 5 μM or 3 to 70 nM or 10 nM to 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 μM. For example 30 to 70 nM as determined by surface plasmon resonance. In one embodiment, the first dAb (or a dAb monomer) binds SA (e.g., HSA) with a K\nD \nas determined by surface plasmon resonance of approximately 1, 50, 70, 100, 150, 200, 300 nM or 1, 2 or 3 μM. In one embodiment, for a dual specific ligand comprising a first anti-SA dAb and a second dAb to TNFR1, the affinity (eg K\nD \nand/or K\noff \nas measured by surface plasmon resonance, eg using BiaCore) of the second dAb for its target is from 1 to 100000 times (eg, 100 to 100000, or 1000 to 100000, or 10000 to 100000 times) the affinity of the first dAb for SA. In one embodiment, the serum albumin is human serum albumin (HSA). For example, the first dAb binds SA with an affinity of approximately 10 μM, while the second dAb binds its target with an affinity of 100 pM. In one embodiment, the serum albumin is human serum albumin (HSA). In one embodiment, the first dAb binds SA (eg, HSA) with a K\nD \nof approximately 50, for example 70, 100, 150 or 200 nM. Details of dual specific ligands are found in WO03002609, WO04003019 and WO04058821.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ligands of the invention can in one embodiment comprise a dAb that binds serum albumin (SA) with a K\nD \nas determined by surface plasmon resonance of 1 nM to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 100, 200, 300, 400 or 500 μM (i.e., ×10\n−9 \nto 5×10\n−4\n), or 100 nM to 10 μM, or 1 to 5 μM or 3 to 70 nM or 10 nM to 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 μM. For example 30 to 70 nM as determined by surface plasmon resonance. In one embodiment, the first dAb (or a dAb monomer) binds SA (e.g., HSA) with a K\nD \nas determined by surface plasmon resonance of approximately 1, 50, 70, 100, 150, 200, 300 nM or 1, 2 or 3 μM. In one embodiment, the first and second dAbs are linked by a linker, for example a linker of from 1 to 4 amino acids or from 1 to 3 amino acids, or greater than 3 amino acids or greater than 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15 or 20 amino acids. In one embodiment, a longer linker (greater than 3 amino acids) is used to enhance potency (K\nD \nof one or both dAbs in the antagonist).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular embodiments of the ligands and antagonists, the dAb binds human serum albumin and competes for binding to albumin with a dAb selected from the group consisting of MSA-16, MSA-26 (See WO04003019 for disclosure of these sequences, which sequences and their nucleic acid counterpart are incorporated herein by reference and form part of the disclosure of the present text),\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDOM7m-16 (SEQ ID NO: 473), DOM7m-12 (SEQ ID NO: 474), DOM7m-26 (SEQ ID NO: 475), DOM7r-1 (SEQ ID NO: 476), DOM7r-3 (SEQ ID NO: 477), DOM7r-4 (SEQ ID NO: 478), DOM7r-5 (SEQ ID NO: 479), DOM7r-7 (SEQ ID NO: 480), DOM7r-8 (SEQ ID NO: 481), DOM7h-2 (SEQ ID NO: 482), DOM7h-3 (SEQ ID NO: 483), DOM7h-4 (SEQ ID NO: 484), DOM7h-6 (SEQ ID NO: 485), DOM7h-1 (SEQ ID NO: 486), DOM7h-7 (SEQ ID NO: 487), DOM7h-22 (SEQ ID NO: 489), DOM7h-23 (SEQ ID NO: 490), DOM7h-24 (SEQ ID NO: 491), DOM7h-25 (SEQ ID NO: 492), DOM7h-26 (SEQ ID NO: 493), DOM7h-21 (SEQ ID NO: 494), DOM7h-27 (SEQ ID NO: 495), DOM7h-8 (SEQ ID NO: 496), DOM7r-13 (SEQ ID NO: 497), DOM7r-14 (SEQ ID NO: 498), DOM7r-15 (SEQ ID NO: 499), DOM7r-16 (SEQ ID NO: 500), DOM7r-17 (SEQ ID NO: 501), DOM7r-18 (SEQ ID NO: 502), DOM7r-19 (SEQ ID NO: 503), DOM7r-20 (SEQ ID NO: 504), DOM7r-21 (SEQ ID NO: 505), DOM7r-22 (SEQ ID NO: 506), DOM7r-23 (SEQ ID NO: 507), DOM7r-24 (SEQ ID NO: 508), DOM7r-25 (SEQ ID NO: 509), DOM7r-26 (SEQ ID NO: 510), DOM7r-27 (SEQ ID NO: 511), DOM7r-28 (SEQ ID NO: 512), DOM7r-29 (SEQ ID NO: 513), DOM7r-30 (SEQ ID NO: 514), DOM7r-31 (SEQ ID NO: 515), DOM7r-32 (SEQ ID NO: 516), DOM7r-33 (SEQ ID NO: 517) (See WO2007080392 for disclosure of these sequences, which sequences and their nucleic acid counterpart are incorporated herein by reference and form part of the disclosure of the present text; the SEQ ID No's in this paragraph are those that appear in WO2007080392),\n\n\n \n \n \n \ndAb8 (dAb10), dAb 10, dAb36, dAb7r20 (DOM7r20), dAb7r21 (DOM7r21), dAb7r22 (DOM7r22), dAb7r23 (DOM7r23), dAb7r24 (DOM7r24), dAb7r25 (DOM7r25), dAb7r26 (DOM7r26), dAb7r27 (DOM7r27), dAb7r28 (DOM7r28), dAb7r29 (DOM7r29), dAb7r29 (DOM7r29), dAb7r31 (DOM7r31), dAb7r32 (DOM7r32), dAb7r33 (DOM7r33), dAb7r33 (DOM7r33), dAb7h22 (DOM7h22), dAb7h23 (DOM7h23), dAb7h24 (DOM7h24), dAb7h25 (DOM7h25), dAb7h26 (DOM7h26), dAb7h27 (DOM7h27), dAb7h30 (DOM7h30), dAb7h31 (DOM7h31), dAb2 (dAbs 4,7,41), dAb4, dAb7, dAb11, dAb12 (dAb7m12), dAb13 (dAb 15), dAb15, dAb16 (dAb21, dAb7m16), dAb17, dAb18, dAb19, dAb21, dAb22, dAb23, dAb24, dAb25 (dAb26, dAb7m26), dAb27, dAb30 (dAb35), dAb31, dAb33, dAb34, dAb35, dAb38 (dAb54), dAb41, dAb46 (dAbs 47, 52 and 56), dAb47, dAb52, dAb53, dAb54, dAb55, dAb56, dAb7m12, dAb7m16, dAb7m26, dAb7r1 (DOM7r1), dAb7r3 (DOM7r3), dAb7r4 (DOM7r4), dAb7r5 (DOM7r5), dAb7r7 (DOM7r7), dAb7r8 (DOM7r8), dAb7r13 (DOM7r13), dAb7r14 (DOM7r14), dAb7r15 (DOM7r15), dAb7r16 (DOM7r16), dAb7r17 (DOM7r17), dAb7r18 (DOM7r18), dAb7r19 (DOM7r19), dAb7h1 (DOM7h1), dAb7h2 (DOM7h2), dAb7h6 (DOM7h6), dAb7h7 (DOM7h7), dAb7h8 (DOM7h8), dAb7h9 (DOM7h9), dAb7h10 (DOM7h10), dAb7h11 (DOM7h11), dAb7h12 (DOM7h12), dAb7h13 (DOM7h13), dAb7h14 (DOM7h14), dAb7p1 (DOM7p1), and dAb7p2 (DOM7p2) (see PCT/GB2008/000453 filed 8\nth \nFeb. 2008 for disclosure of these sequences, which sequences and their nucleic acid counterpart are incorporated herein by reference and form part of the disclosure of the present text).

Alternatively, conjugation can be achieved by using a peptide linker between moeities, eg, a peptide linker as described in WO 03076567 or WO 2004003019 (these linker disclosures being incorporated by reference in the present disclosure to provide examples for use in the present invention). Typically, a polypeptide that enhances serum half-life in vivo is a polypeptide which occurs naturally in vivo and which resists degradation or removal by endogenous mechanisms which remove unwanted material from the organism (e.g., human). For example, a polypeptide that enhances serum half-life in vivo can be selected from proteins from the extracellular matrix, proteins found in blood, proteins found at the blood brain barrier or in neural tissue, proteins localized to the kidney, liver, lung, heart, skin or bone, stress proteins, disease-specific proteins, or proteins involved in Fc transport.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn embodiments of the invention described throughout this disclosure, instead of the use of an anti-TNFR1 “dAb” in an antagonist or ligand of the invention, it is contemplated that the skilled addressee can use a polypeptide or domain that comprises one or more or all 3 of the CDRs of a dAb of the invention that binds TNFR1 (e.g., CDRs grafted onto a suitable protein scaffold or skeleton, eg an affibody, an SpA scaffold, an LDL receptor class A domain or an EGF domain) The disclosure as a whole is to be construed accordingly to provide disclosure of antagonists using such domains in place of a dAb. In this respect, see PCT/GB2008/000453 filed 8\nth \nFeb. 2008, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, therefore, an antagonist of the invention comprises an immunoglobulin single variable domain or domain antibody (dAb) that has binding specificity for TNFR1 or the complementarity determining regions of such a dAb in a suitable format. The antagonist can be a polypeptide that consists of such a dAb, or consists essentially of such a dAb. The antagonist can be a polypeptide that comprises a dAb (or the CDRs of a dAb) in a suitable format, such as an antibody format (e.g., IgG-like format, scFv, Fab, Fab′, F(ab′)\n2\n), or a dual specific ligand that comprises a dAb that binds TNFR1 and a second dAb that binds another target protein, antigen or epitope (e.g., serum albumin).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolypeptides, dAbs and antagonists according to the invention can be formatted as a variety of suitable antibody formats that are known in the art, such as, IgG-like formats, chimeric antibodies, humanized antibodies, human antibodies, single chain antibodies, bispecific antibodies, antibody heavy chains, antibody light chains, homodimers and heterodimers of antibody heavy chains and/or light chains, antigen-binding fragments of any of the foregoing (e.g., a Fv fragment (e.g., single chain Fv (scFv), a disulfide bonded Fv), a Fab fragment, a Fab′ fragment, a F(ab′)\n2 \nfragment), a single variable domain (e.g., V\nH\n, V\nL\n), a dAb, and modified versions of any of the foregoing (e.g., modified by the covalent attachment of polyalkylene glycol (e.g., polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, polybutylene glycol) or other suitable polymer).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the invention provides a ligand (eg, an anti-TNFR1 antagonist) that is an IgG-like format. Such formats have the conventional four chain structure of an IgG molecule (2 heavy chains and two light chains), in which one or more of the variable regions (V\nH \nand or V\nL\n) have been replaced with a dAb of the invention. In one embodiment, each of the variable regions (2 V\nH \nregions and 2 V\nL \nregions) is replaced with a dAb or single variable domain, at least one of which is an anti-TNFR1 dAb according to the invention. The dAb(s) or single variable domain(s) that are included in an IgG-like format can have the same specificity or different specificities. In some embodiments, the IgG-like format is tetravalent and can have one (anti-TNFR1 only), two (eg, anti-TNFR1 and anti-SA), three or four specificities. For example, the IgG-like format can be monospecific and comprises 4 dAbs that have the same specificity; bispecific and comprises 3 dAbs that have the same specificity and another dAb that has a different specificity; bispecific and comprise two dAbs that have the same specificity and two dAbs that have a common but different specificity; trispecific and comprises first and second dAbs that have the same specificity, a third dAb with a different specificity and a fourth dAb with a different specificity from the first, second and third dAbs; or tetraspecific and comprise four dAbs that each have a different specificity. Antigen-binding fragments of IgG-like formats (e.g., Fab, F(ab′)\n2\n, Fab′, Fv, scF\nV\n) can be prepared. In one embodiment, the IgG-like formats or antigen-binding fragments thereof do not crosslink TNFR1, for example, the format may be monovalent for TNFR1. If complement activation and/or antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) function is desired, the ligand can be an IgG1-like format. If desired, the IgG-like format can comprise a mutated constant region (variant IgG heavy chain constant region) to minimize binding to Fc receptors and/or ability to fix complement. (see e.g. Winter et al, GB 2,209,757 B; Morrison et al., WO 89/07142; Morgan et al., WO 94/29351, Dec. 22, 1994).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ligands of the invention (polypeptides, dAbs and antagonists) can be formatted as a fusion protein that contains a first immunoglobulin single variable domain that is fused directly to a second immunoglobulin single variable domain. If desired such a format can further comprise a half-life extending moiety. For example, the ligand can comprise a first immunoglobulin single variable domain that is fused directly to a second immunoglobulin single variable domain that is fused directly to an immunoglobulin single variable domain that binds serum albumin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally the orientation of the polypeptide domains that have a binding site with binding specificity for a target, and whether the ligand comprises a linker, is a matter of design choice. However, some orientations, with or without linkers, may provide better binding characteristics than other orientations. All orientations (e.g., dAb1-linker-dAb2; dAb2-linker-dAb1) are encompassed by the invention are ligands that contain an orientation that provides desired binding characteristics can be easily identified by screening.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolypeptides and dAbs according to the invention, including dAb monomers, dimers and trimers, can be linked to an antibody Fc region, comprising one or both of \nC\n \n \n \nH\n2 and \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 domains, and optionally a hinge region. For example, vectors encoding ligands linked as a single nucleotide sequence to an Fc region may be used to prepare such polypeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention moreover provides dimers, trimers and polymers of the aforementioned dAb monomers.\n\n\n \nCodon Optimised Sequences\n\n\n \n \n \nAs described above, embodiments of the invention provide codon optimized nucleotide sequences encoding polypeptides and variable domains of the invention. As shown in the following illustration, codon optimized sequences of about 70% identity can be produced that encode for the same variable domain (in this case the variable domain amino acid sequence is identical to DOM1h-131-206). In this instance, the sequences were optimized for expression by \nPichia pastoris \n(codon optimized sequences 1-3) or \nE. coli \n(codon optimized \nsequences\n 4 and 5).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe performed a calculation taking into account the degeneracy in the genetic code and maximised the number of nucleotide changes within each degenerate codon encoded by the nucleotide sequence of DOM1h-131-206 as shown in \nFIG. 19\n and a theoretical nucleotide sequence which still encodes a variable domain that is identical to DOM1h-131-206. The calculation revealed that the theoretical sequence would have only 57% identity to the nucleotide sequence of DOM1h-131-206 as shown in \nFIG. 19\n.\n\n\n \n \nCodon Optimised Sequence\n

\nEXEMPLIFICATION\n\n\nExample A\n\n\nLead Selection & Characterisation of Domain Antibodies to Human TNFR1\n\n\n \n \n \nDomain antibodies generated were derived from phage libraries. Both soluble selections and panning to passively absorbed human TNFR1 were performed according to the relevant standard methods. Human TNFR1 was purchased as a soluble recombinant protein either from R&D systems (Cat No 636-R1-025/CF) or Peprotech (Cat no. 310-07) and either used directly (in the case of passive selections) or after biotinylation using coupling via primary amines followed by quality control of its activity in a biological assay and analysis of its MW and extent of biotinylation by mass spectrometry. Typically 3 rounds of selection were performed utilising decreasing levels of antigen in every next round.\n\n\nOutputs from selections were screened by phage ELISA for the presence of anti-TNFR1 binding clones. DNA was isolated from these phage selections and subcloned into a expression vector for expression of soluble dAb fragments. Soluble dAb fragments were expressed in 96-well plates and the supernatants were used to screen for the presence of anti-TNFR1 binding dAbs, either using a direct binding ELISA with anti-c-myc detection or BIAcore™ using a streptavidin/biotinylated TNFR1 BIAcore™ chip and ranked according to off-rates.\n\n\nThe lead molecules, described below, were derived from the parental dAb, designated DOM1h-131 (disclosed in WO2006038027). This molecule was selected from the phage display library after 3 rounds of selections using 60 nM of biotinylated antigen. Streptavidin or neutravidin coated Dyna beads were alternated as capture reagents in each round of selection to prevent selection of binders against either streptavidin or neutravidin. The potency of the lead DOM1h-131 at this stage was in the low micromolar range as determined in the MRC-5 fibroblast/IL-8 release cell assay. The binding kinetics as determined by BIAcore™ typically displayed fast-on/fast-off rates. \nE. coli \nexpression levels of this DOM1h-131 lead molecule, as a C-terminally myc tagged monomer were in the region of 8 mg/l.\n\n\n\n \nAffinity Maturation of Leads:\n\n\n \n \n \nDOM1h-131 was taken forward into affinity maturation to generate mutants with higher potency and improved biophysical characteristics (see \nFIG. 3\n for amino acid sequences of DOM1h-131 derived leads). After generation of an error-prone library (average number of 1 amino acid change per dAb sequence, \nlibrary size\n 8×10\n7\n) using an error-prone PCR polymerase (Genemorph II, Stratagene), seven rounds of selection utilising these error-prone libraries were performed. This strategy led to the isolation of clone DOM1h-131-8, a molecule where 4 amino acid changes (one in framework 1 (FR1), one in CDR1, one in CDR3 and one in FR4) gave an approximate 100-fold improvement in potency as measured by the MRC-5 cell assay (˜4 nM). In this assay MRC-5 cells were incubated with the test samples for one hour then TNF-α (200 pg/ml) was added. After an overnight incubation IL-8 release was determined using an IL-8 ABI 8200 cellular detection assay (FMAT). A TNF-α dose curve was included in each experiment. The concentration of TNF-α used to compete with dAb binding to TNFR1 (200 pg/ml) was approximately 70% of the maximum TNF-α response in this assay.\n\n\nIn order to further improve potency, single amino acid positions were diversified by oligo-directed mutagenesis at key positions suggested by the error-prone lead consensus information. During this process an improved version of the DOM1h-131-8 clone, DOM1h-131-24 (originally named DOM1h-131-8-2 prior to correction) was isolated through BIAcore™ screening that had a single K94R amino acid mutation (amino acid numbering according to Kabat) and an RBA potency of 200-300 pM.\n\n\nFurther error-prone libraries based on this lead and the NNS library from which it was derived were generated and subjected to three rounds of phage selections using heat treatment (for method see Jespers L, et al., Aggregation-resistant domain antibodies selected on phage by heat denaturation. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004 September; 22(9):1161-5). During this selection, libraries were pooled and clones derived from round two of the selection yielded dAbs such as DOM1h-131-53 which were considered to be more heat stable. It was hypothesised that these clones would possess better biophysical characteristics. Some framework mutations in clone DOM1h-131-53 were germlined to generate clone DOM1h-131-83. This clone formed the basis for further diversification via oligo-directed individual CDR mutagenesis either using phage display selection as described above or using the in-vitro compartmentalization technology using emulsions. The phage display strategy generated leads DOM1h-131-117 and DOM1h-131-151. The in-vitro compartmentalization technology generated DOM1h-131-511.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt this stage these three leads were compared in biophysical and biological assays and DOM1h-131-511 was the molecule with the best properties. Furthermore these molecules were tested for their resistance to proteolytic cleavage in the presence of trypsin or leucozyme. Leucozyme consists of pooled sputum from patients with cystic fibrosis and contains high levels of elastase and other proteases and was used as a surrogate for in vivo conditions in lung diseases. This data indicated that all three leads DOM1h-131-117, DOM1h-131-151 and DOM1h-131-511 were rapidly degraded in presence of trypsin or leucozyme. This finding raised concerns about the in vivo persistence of DOM1h-131-511 when in the patient and a strategy was developed to select for improved resistance to trypsin. It was hypothesised that such improved trypsin resistance could have a beneficial effect on other biophysical properties of the molecule. Essentially the standard phage selection method was modified to allow for selection in the presence of proteases prior to selection on antigen. To this end a new phage vector was engineered in which the c-myc tag was deleted to allow selections in the presence of trypsin without cleaving the displayed dAb off the phage. DOM1h-131-511 based error-prone libraries were generated and cloned in the pDOM33 vector (see \nFIG. 50\n for pDOM33 vector map). Phage stocks generated from this library were pre-treated with either 1 mg/ml or 100 μg/ml trypsin at 37° C. for 24 hours, subsequently protease inhibitor which was Roche Complete Protease Inhibitors (2×) was added to block the trypsin activity prior to selection on the relevant antigen. Four rounds of selection were performed. Soluble expressed TNFR1 binding dAbs were assessed using the BIAcore™ for their ability to bind TNFR1 with or without the presence of proteases during one hour or overnight incubations at 37° C. in the presence or absence of trypsin (at 100 μg/ml or 1000 μg/ml final trypsin concentration).\n\n\n \n \nThis led to the isolation of two lead molecules DOM1h-131-202 and DOM1h-131-206 which demonstrated improved protease resistance as shown by BIAcore™ antigen binding experiments. It is interesting to note that DOM1h-131-202 contained only one mutation in CDR2 (V53D), all amino acid numbering according to Kabat) in comparison to DOM1h-131-511, whereas DOM1h-131-206 contained only two mutations: the first mutation is the same as in DOM1h-131-202 (V53D mutation in CDR2) and the second is a Y91H mutation in FR3 (see \nFIG. 3\n). This Y91H mutation in FR3 does occur in the 3-20 human germline gene indicating that this residue occurs in human antibodies. The three clones DOM1h-131-511, DOM1h-131-202 and DOM1h-131-206 have amino acid sequences as shown in \nFIG. 3\n.\n\n\n \nActivity of the Molecules was Determined as Below:\n\n\n \n \n \nBIAcore™ binding affinity assessment of DOM1H-131-202, DOM1H-131-511 and DOM1H-131-206 for binding to human TNFR1.\n\n\nThe binding affinities of DOM1H-131-202, DOM1H-131-511 and DOM1H-131-206 for binding to human recombinant \nE. coli\n-expressed human TNFR1 were assessed by BIAcore™ analysis. Analysis was carried out using biotinylated human TNFR1. 1400 RU of biotinylated TNFR1 was coated to a streptavidin (SA) chip. The surface was regenerated back to baseline using mild acid elution conditions. DOM1H-131-202, DOM1H-131-511 and DOM1H-131-206 were passed over this surface at defined concentrations using a flow rate of 50 μl/min. The work was carried out on a \nBIAcore™\n 3000 machine and data were analysed and fitted to the 1:1 model of binding. The binding data fitted well to the 1:1 model for all tested molecules. All K\nD \nvalues were calculated from k\non \nand k\noff \nrates. BIAcore™ runs were carried out at 25° C.\n\n\nThe data below were produced from three independent experiments. In each experiment the results were calculated by averaging a number of fits using highest dAb concentrations for kd and lower concentrations for ka. The data are presented as the mean and standard deviation (in brackets) of the results (Table 1).\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIAcore ™ data for DOM1H-131-202, DOM1H-131-511 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nand DOM1H-131-206 binding to human TNFR1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nk\non\n \n\n\nk\noff\n \n\n\nK\nD \n(nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDOM1H-131-511\n\n\n5.03E+05\n\n\n5.06E−04\n\n\n1.07\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(511)\n\n\n(1.07E+05)\n\n\n(1.01E−04)\n\n\n(0.44)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDOM1H-131-202 \n\n\n1.02E+06\n\n\n5.42E−04\n\n\n0.55\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(202)\n\n\n(2.69E+05)\n\n\n(3.69E−05)\n\n\n(0.11)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDOM1H-131-206 \n\n\n1.55E+06\n\n\n7.25E−04\n\n\n0.47\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(206)\n\n\n(3.57E+05)\n\n\n(1.95E−04)\n\n\n(0.06)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDOM1H-131-202, DOM1H-131-511 and DOM1H-131-206 bound similarly and with high affinity to human TNFR1.

Both DOM1H-131-202 and DOM1H-131-206 have a slightly better affinity in comparison to DOM1H-131-511 which has an average affinity of 1.07 nM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nReceptor Binding Assay:\n\n\n \n \n \nThe potency of the dAbs was determined against human TNFR1 in a receptor binding assay. This assay measures the binding of TNF-alpha to TNFR1 and the ability of soluble dAb to block this interaction. The TNFR1-FC fusion is captured on a bead pre-coated with goat anti-human IgG (H&L). The receptor coated beads are incubated with TNF-alpha (10 ng/ml), dAb, biotin conjugated anti-TNF-alpha and streptavidin alexa fluor 647 in a black sided clear bottomed 384 well plate. After 6 hours the plate is read on the ABI 8200 Cellular Detection system and bead associated fluorescence determined. If the dAb blocks TNF-alpha binding to TNFR1 the fluorescent intensity will be reduced.\n\n\nData was analysed using the ABI 8200 analysis software. Concentration effect curves and potency (EC\n50\n) values were determined using GraphPad Prism and a sigmoidal dose response curve with variable slope. The assay was repeated on three separate occasions. A TNF-alpha dose curve was included in each experiment (\nFIGS. 38 and 39\n). The concentration of TNF-alpha used to compete with dAb binding to TNFR1 (10 ng/ml) is approximately 90% of the maximum TNF-alpha response in this assay.\n\n\nA representative graph is shown in \nFIG. 39\n showing the ability of dAbs to inhibit the binding of TNF-alpha to TNFR1. In all three experiments the negative control samples (HEL4, an anti-hen egg white lysozyme dAb and V\nH \ndummy) weakly inhibit the interaction between TNF-alpha and TNFR1 at high concentrations. The average potency (EC\n50\n) values for the test samples and positive controls (anti-TNFR1 mAb obtained from R&D Systems, mAb225) and Enbrel™ (etanercept; a dimeric fusion consisting of TNFR2 linked to the Fc portion of IgG1; licensed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis) are shown in Table 2.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE 2\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPotency (EC\n50\n) values for DOM1H-131-202, \n \n \n \nDOM1H-131-206 and DOM1H-131-511 in a TNFR1 \n \n \n \nreceptor binding assay for three repeat experiments.\n \n \n \n \n \nSample\n \nAverage EC\n50 \n(nM)\n \nSEM\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDOM1H-131-202\n \n0.11\n \n0.008\n \n \n \nDOM1H-131-206\n \n0.07\n \n0.01\n \n \n \nDOM1H-131-511\n \n0.19\n \n0.01\n \n \n \nEnbrel ™ (Etanercept)\n \n0.20\n \n0.07\n \n \n \nAnti-TNFR1 mAb # mAb225\n \n0.08\n \n0.003\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn this assay DOM1H-131-206 appears more potent than the other two dAbs being tested and has a similar potency to the commercially available anti-TNFR1 mAb, MAB225 (R and D Systems).\n \n \n \n \n \n\nExpression of lead clones from \nPichia pastoris \nwas carried out as described below: The primary amino acid sequence of the three lead molecules was used to produce codon optimised genes for secreted expression in \nPichia pastoris\n. There is 75% sequence identity between the codon optimized and the non-codon optimized DOM1H-131-206. The three synthetic genes were cloned into the expression vector pPIC-Za (from Invitrogen) and then transformed into two \nPichia \nstrains, X33 and KM71H. The transformed cells were plated out onto increasing concentrations of Zeocin (100, 300, 600 and 900 μg/ml) to select for clones with multiple integrants. Approximately 15 clones for each cell line and construct were selected for expression screening. As the correlation between high/low gene copy number and expression level is not fully understood in \nPichia pastoris\n, several clones were picked from across the Zeocin concentration range. 5 L fermenter runs were carried out using clones that had not been extensively screened for high productivity. This allowed the production of significant amounts of material for further studies.\n\n\n\n \nMaterial Production for Protein Characterisation:\n\n\n \n \n \nProtein A based chromatography resins have been extensively used to purify V\nH \ndAbs from microbial culture supernatants. Although this allows a single step purification method for producing high purity material, usually >90% in most cases, for some molecules the low pH elution conditions can result in the formation of aggregates. There is also the issue of the limited capacity of affinity resins for dAbs; this would mean the use of significant quantities of resin to process from fermenters. In order to produce high quality material for characterisation and further stability and nebuliser studies, a downstream purification process was devised using a mixed modal charge induction resin as the primary capture step followed by anion exchange. Without significant optimisation, this allowed the recovery of ˜70% of the expressed dAb at a purity of ˜95%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the capture step on the mixed modal charge induction resin, Capto MMC from GE Healthcare, column equilibration is performed using 50 mM sodium phosphate pH6.0 and the supernatant is loaded without any need for dilution or pH adjustment. After washing the column, the protein is eluted by pH gradient using an elution buffer which is 50 mM Tris pH 9.0. The specific wash and gradient conditions will vary slightly depending on the p1 of the protein being eluted\n\n\n \n \nThe eluate peak is then further purified with a flow through step using anion exchange chromatography. This removes residual HMW contamination such as alcohol oxidase and reduces endotoxin. The resin is equilibrated with either PBS or phosphate buffer pH 7.4 without salt. Upon loading the eluate from Capto MMC onto the anion exchange resin the dAb does not bind and is recovered from the flow through. Endotoxin and other contaminants bind to the resin. The presence of salt if using PBS buffer improves protein recovery to 91% for this step rather than 86% recovery achieved without salt. However the presence of salt reduces the effectiveness of endotoxin removal such that a typical endotoxin level of dAb following this step with the inclusion of salt was measured as 58 EU/ml compared with a level of <1.0 EU/ml obtained when no salt was present.\n\n\n \nProtein Characterisation:\n\n\n \n \n \nThe material produced from the 5 L fermenter runs was characterised for identity using electrospray mass spectrometry, amino terminal sequencing and isoelectric focusing and for purity using SDS-PAGE, SEC and Gelcode glycoprotein staining kit (Pierce).\n\n\n \nIdentity:\n\n\n \n \n \nThe amino terminal sequence analysis of the first five residues of each protein, was as expected (EVQLL . . . ). Mass spectrometry was performed on samples of the proteins which had been buffer exchanged into 50:50 H\n2\nO:acetonitrile containing 0.1% glacial acetic acid using C4 Zip-tips (Millipore). The measured mass for each of the three proteins was within 0.5 Da of the theoretical mass based on the primary amino acid sequence (calculated using average masses) when allowing for a mass difference of −2 from the formation of the internal disulphide bond. IEF was used to identify the proteins based on their pI which was different for each protein.\n\n\n \nPurity:\n\n\n \n \n \nThe three proteins were loaded onto non-reducing SDS-PAGE gels in 1 μg and 10 μg amounts in duplicate. A single band was observed in all instances. Size exclusion chromatography was also performed to demonstrate levels of purity. For size exclusion chromatography (SEC) 100 μg of each protein were loaded onto a TOSOH G2000 SWXL column flowing at 0.5 ml/min Mobile phase was PBS/10% ethanol.\n\n\n \nInvestigation of dAb Stability for Candidate Selection:\n\n\n \n \n \nFor the indication of COPD, it would be necessary to deliver the dAb into the lung, eg using a nebuliser device. This would mean the protein could potentially experience a range of shear and thermal stresses depending on the type of nebuliser used and could be subjected to enzymatic degradation by proteases in the lung environment. It was determined if the protein could be delivered using this type of device, form the correct particle size distribution and remain functional following nebuliser delivery. Therefore the intrinsic stability of each molecule to a range of physical stresses was investigated to determine the baseline stability and the most sensitive stability indicating assays. As the stability of each protein will be dependent on the buffer solution it is solubilised in, some pre-formulation work was necessary. This information, such as buffer, pH, would also be useful for understanding the stability of the protein during the downstream purification process and subsequent storage. In order to characterise the changes in the molecules during exposure to a range of physical stresses, a range of analytical techniques were used such as size exclusion chromatography (SEC), SDS-PAGE and isoelectric focusing (IEF).\n\n\n \nAssessment of Protease Stability of DOM1H-131-202, DOM1H-131-511 and DOM1H-131-206:\n\n\n \n \n \nThe protease stability of DOM1H-131-202, DOM1H-131-511 and DOM1H-131-206 was assessed by BIAcore™ analysis of the residual binding activity after pre-incubation for defined timepoints in excess of proteases. Approximately 1400 RU of biotinylated TNFR1 was coated to a streptavidin (SA) chip. 250 nM of DOM1H-131-202, DOM1H-131-511 and DOM1H-131-206 was incubated with PBS only or with 100 μg/ml of trypsin, elastase or leucozyme for 1, 3, and 24 hours at 30° C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of a cocktail of protease inhibitors. The dAb/protease mixtures were then passed over the TNFR1 coated chip using reference cell subtraction. The chip surface was regenerated with 10 ul 0.1M glycine pH 2.2 between each injection cycle. The fraction of DOM1H-131-202, DOM1H-131-511 and DOM1H-131-206 bound to human TNFR1 (at 10 secs) pre-incubated with proteases was determined relative to dAb binding without proteases. BIAcore™ runs were carried out at 25° C.\n\n\nThe data was produced from three independent experiments. The bar graph indicates mean values and the error bars indicate standard deviation of the results (for results see \nFIG. 24\n).\n\n\nIt was found that DOM1H-131-202 and DOM1H-131-206 were shown to have greater resistance to proteolytic degradation by trypsin, elastase or leucozyme in comparison to DOM1H-131-511. The difference between DOM1H-131-202 and DOM1H-131-206 in comparison to DOM1H-131-511 is most pronounced after 1 hr with trypsin and after 3 hrs with elastase or leucozyme.\n\n\n\n \nThermal Stability as Determined Using DSC:\n\n\n \n \n \nIn order to determine at which pH the molecules had the greatest stability, differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) was used to measure the melting temperatures (T\nm\n) of each dAb in Britton-Robinson buffer. As Britton-Robinson is made up of three component buffer systems (acetate, phosphate and borate), it is possible to produce a pH range from 3-10 in the same solution. The theoretical pI was determined from the proteins primary amino acid sequence. From the DSC, the pH at which the dAbs had their greatest intrinsic thermal stability was found to be \npH\n 7 for DOM1H-131-202 (202), pH 7-7.5 for DOM1H-131-206 (206) and pH 7.5 for DOM1H-131-511 (511). For all subsequent stress and stability work the following pHs were used for each dAb; for DOM1H-131-202 (202) and DOM1H-131-206 (206) pH 7.0 and for DOM1H-131-511 (511) pH 7.5 in Britton-Robinson buffer. The results are summarised in Table 3 below:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of the pH and T\nm\ns of DOM1H-131-202 (202), \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDOM1H-131-206 (206) and DOM1H-131-511 (511) as \n\n\n\n\n\n\ndetermined by DSC in Britton-Robinson buffer at 1 mg/ml\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\npH that gives greatest\n\n\nTm (° C.) of the dAb at\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndAb\n\n\nintrinsic thermal stability\n\n\nthe given pH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDOM1H-131-202 (202)\n\n\n7.0\n\n\n68.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDOM1H-131-206 (206)\n\n\n7.0-7.5\n\n\n65.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDOM1H-131-511 (511)\n\n\n7.5\n\n\n58.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIntrinsic Solubility Testing:\n\n\n \n \n \nAll the lead dAbs were concentrated in centrifugal Vivaspin concentrators (5K cut-off), to determine their maximum solubility and the levels of recovery upon concentration. Experiments were performed in Britton-Robinson buffer at the most stable pH. Sample volumes and concentrations were measured over a time course and deviation from expected concentration recorded as well as percent recovery of the sample.\n\n\nIt was found that all proteins could be concentrated to over 100 mg/ml in Britton-Robinson buffer. Both DOM1H-131-202 (202) and DOM1H-131-206 (206) showed lower recoveries than expected compared to DOM1H-131-511 (511), but still within acceptable levels.\n\n\nNebuliser Delivery of the Lead dAbs:\n\n\nBy testing different nebulisers and formulation buffers it was demonstrated that the dAb could effectively be delivered using a wide range of nebulising devices. More importantly, it was shown for the first time that nebulisation of the dAb in the formulation buffer produced the desired particle size distribution (compared using the percentage of droplets <5 μm) for effective lung delivery whilst maintaining protein functionality. This is further described below.\n\n\n\n \nComparison of Performance in Various Devices:\n\n\n \n \n \nDOM1H-131-511 (511) was tested in six nebuliser devices comprising two devices from each of the three main groups of nebulisers for liquid formulations i.e. ultrasonic nebulisers, jet nebulisers and vibrating mesh nebulisers. In each device the dAb was tested at 5 mg/ml with a range of PEG concentrations. For each sample the percentage of droplet size <5 μm was measured using a Malvern Spraytek Device (Malvern Instruments Limited, UK) and the results are shown in \nFIG. 35\n. The stability of each sample after being nebulised was assessed using SEC to analyse the amount of sample which had dimerised both in the material remaining in the cup and in collected aerosol. The results may be seen in \nFIG. 36\n. The less the extent of dimer formation the greater the stability.\n\n\nMost devices can deliver 40% or more of the liquid formulation in the correct size range but the eFlow (a vibrating mesh nebuliser device) and PARI LC (a jet nebuliser) devices perform better, with the PARI LC* (star) device delivering more than 80% when PEG is included in the buffer. This increase in delivery with PEG is also observed with the eFlow and, to a lesser extent, with the PART LC+.\n\n\nImportantly activity of the dAb was also found to be retained after nebulisation (see results in \nFIG. 8\n)\n\n\n\n \nEffect of Buffer Additives:\n\n\n \n \n \nDue to the lower stability of DOM1H-131-511 (511), the 50 mM phosphate formulation buffer contained both \nPEG\n 1000 and sucrose (and has a viscosity which is within the range which is defined as about equal to the viscosity of a solution of about 2% to about 10\n% PEG\n 1000 in 50 mM phosphate buffer containing 1.2% (w/v sucrose) to help protect the dAb from both shear and thermal stress. As both DOM1H-131-202 (202) and DOM1H-131-206 (206) have higher T\nm\n's and showed considerably improved stability to thermal stress, all the molecules were tested in both the original formulation buffer and in Britton-Robinson buffer (which has a lower viscosity than the formulation buffer). The dAbs were tested in both the E-flow and Pari LC+devices with run time of 3.5 minutes at a protein concentration of 5 mg/ml and the particle size distribution determined using a Malvern Spraytek Device. As a comparison, a marketed drug for cystic fiborosis (designated standard protein X) that is delivered using a nebuliser device, was tested in its own formulation buffer. The results are shown in \nFIG. 37\n. For good delivery and distribution into the deep lung, the ideal particle size is less than 6 microns, e.g. <5 μm. All the dAbs give comparable levels of particle sizes that were less than 5 μm in both the Britton-Robinson buffer and formulation buffer (as described earlier). However, the higher viscosity of the formulation buffer could be particularly beneficial for producing particles within the correct size range, e.g. particles <5 μm. The concentration of the dAb in the cup of the device was determined by A\n280 \nmeasurements before and after nebulisation. It was found that the protein concentration did not change significantly indicating that neither the protein nor vehicle is preferentially nebulised during delivery.\n\n\n \nConclusion:\n\n\n \n \n \nIt has been demonstrated as described above that polypeptides such as dAbs can be nebulised in a range of commercially available nebuliser devices and importantly that they retain stability and biological activity after nebulisation and there is no significant aggregation observed following nebulisation. When viscosity enhancing excipients, such as PEG are added to the buffer formulation, particle size distribution and percentage droplet size less than 5 μm can be improved, thus potentially improving dAb delivery to the deep lung.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDelivery of dAb to the lung can also be improved by increasing the dAb concentration for example a concentration of up to about 40 mg/ml and delivery time without any reduction in dAb stability or activity.\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\nPhage Vector pDOM13\n\n\n \n \n \nA filamentous phage (fd) display vector, pDOM13 was used. This vector produces fusion proteins with phage coat protein III. The multiple cloning site of pDOM13 is illustrated in \nFIG. 1\n. The genes encoding dAbs were cloned as SalI/NotI fragments.\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\nTest Protease Selections on Phage-Displayed Domain Antibodies (dAbs) with a Range of Resistance to Trypsin\n\n\n \n \n \nThe genes encoding dAbs DOM4-130-54 which binds IL-1R1, DOM1h-131-511 which binds TNFR1, and DOM15-10, DOM15-26 and DOM15-26-501, which bind VEGFA, were cloned in pDOM13 and phages displaying these dAbs were produced according to standard techniques. Phages were purified by PEG precipitation, resuspended in PBS and titered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above dAbs displayed a range of ability to resist degradation by trypsin when tested as isolated proteins. Resistance to degradation was assessed as follows: dAb (1 mg/ml) in PBS was incubated with trypsin at 40 μg/ml at 30° C., resulting in a molecular ratio of 25:1 dAb:trypsin. Samples (30 μl) were taken immediately before addition of trypsin, and then at T=1 hour, 3 hours, and 24 hours. Protease activity was neutralized by addition of Roche Complete Protease Inhibitors (2×) followed by immersion in liquid nitrogen and storage on dry ice. 15 μg of each dAb sample was subsequently analyzed by electrophoresis on a Novex 10-20% Tricine gel and proteins were stained with SureBlue (1×).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBoth DOM15-10 and DOM15-26-501 were significantly digested during the first three hours. DOM15-26, DOM4-130-54 and DOM1h-131-511 were more stable, with digestion of the dAbs only becoming apparent after 24 hours (\nFIG. 2\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phage-displayed dAbs were also incubated in the presence of trypsin to evaluate if trypsin resistance of phage-displayed dAbs correlated with the results obtained with the isolated soluble dAbs. Various concentrations of trypsin and incubation times were tested. In all cases, after neutralization of trypsin with Roche Complete Protease Inhibitors, the phages were tested for their ability to bind a generic ligand: protein A, which binds all V\nH \ndomain antibodies (e.g., DOM1h-131, DOM15-26, DOM15-26-501) or protein L, which binds all V\nK \ndomain antibodies (e.g., DOM4-130-54, DOM15-10). Phage were also tested for binding to target antigens. In both cases, binding was assumed to correlate with retention of the dAb structural integrity through resistance to proteolysis. The binding activity was measured either by ELISA (using conjugated antibodies against phage) or by elution of bound phages and titre analysis following infection of exponentially growing \nE. coli \nTG1 cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTests with DOM15-10, DOM15-26 and DOM15-26-501 on Phage\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach dAb was treated for one hour at room temperature with a range of trypsin concentrations (100 μg/ml, 10 μg/ml and 0 μg/ml). Trypsin activity was blocked with Roche Complete Protease Inhibitor (1×) and then the phages were diluted in 2% Marvell in PBS, incubated with 50 nM of biotinylated antigen (recombinant human VEGF (R&D systems)) for one hour at room temperature. Strepavidin-coated beads (Dynabeads M-280 (Invitrogen)) that were pre-blocked for one hour at room temperature with 2% Marvell in PBS were added, and the mixture was then incubated for five minutes at room temperature. All of the incubation steps with Dynabeads were carried out on a rotating wheel. Unbound phages were washed away by washing the beads eight times with 1 ml of 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS. Bound phages were eluted with 0.5 ml of 0.1M Glycine pH2.2 and neutralized with 100 μl of 1M Tris-HCL pH 8.0. Eluted phage were used to infect exponentially growing TG1 cells (one hour at 37° C.) and plated on Tetracycline plates. Plates were incubated overnight at 37° C. and colony counts were made (see Table 4). The best results were observed from selection with incubation with 100 μg/ml trypsin. There was about a 10-fold increase in the yield of DOM15-26 in comparison to DOM15-10 and DOM15-26-501.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA second experiment was done to further confirm these results under more severe incubation conditions. Phage displayed dAbs were treated for 1 hour or 2 hours at 37° C. with agitation (250 rpm). The best results were observed from selections with 2 hour incubation with 100 ug/ml trypsin. The yield of DOM15-26 was 200-fold higher than the yield of DOM15-26-501 and 1000-fold higher than the yield of DOM15-10.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a third experiment, phages displaying DOM15-26 and DOM15-26-501 were mixed 1:1 at the start. They were then either incubated with trypsin (1000 μg/ml) or without trypsin for two hours at 37° C. with agitation (250 rpm), and then selected for antigen binding as described above. Sequencing of ten colonies from each selection revealed a mixed population of clones for selection without trypsin pre-treatment (DOM15-26: 4/10; DOM15-26-501: 6/10), whereas all clones from the selection with trypsin encoded for DOM15-26 as expected.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese experiments indicate that a selection pressure can be obtained by adding a protease to phages displaying dAbs, such that phages displaying the most proteolytically stable dAbs are preferentially selected (following panning on a generic ligand or the antigen).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDOM 15-\n\n\n1:1\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLength of\n\n\n \n\n\nTrypsin\n\n\nDOM 15-\n\n\n26-501\n\n\nmixed\n\n\nDOM 15-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment\n\n\nincubation\n\n\nTemp.\n\n\n \nconcentration\n \n\n\n26 titre\n\n\ntitre\n\n\ntitre\n\n\n10 \ntitre\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n1 \nhr\n \n \nRoom\n \n \n\n\n100\n\n\nμg/ml\n\n\n1.6 × 10\n8\n \n\n\n6.3 × 10\n7\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1.1 × 10\n7\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \ninput\n 10\n10\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \ntemp\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1 \nhr\n \n \nRoom\n \n \n\n\n10\n\n\nμg/\nml\n \n\n\n \n \n3 × 10\n8\n \n\n\n4.4 × 10\n8\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2.4 × 10\n8\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \ntemp\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1 \nhr\n \n \nRoom\n \n \n\n\n0\n\n\nμg/ml\n\n\n0.9 × 10\n8\n \n\n\n \n \n2 × 10\n8\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.7 × 10\n8\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \ntemp\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n1 hr, 250 rpm\n\n\n37° C.\n\n\n100\n\n\nμg/\nml\n \n\n\n \n \n2 × 10\n7\n \n\n\n \n \n1 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n1 × 10\n5\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \ninput\n 10\n9\n \n\n\n2 hr, 250 rpm\n\n\n37° C.\n\n\n100\n\n\nμg/\nml\n \n\n\n \n \n1 × 10\n7\n \n\n\n \n \n6 × 10\n4\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n1 × 10\n4\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2 hr, 250 rpm\n\n\n37° C.\n\n\n0\n\n\nμg/ml\n\n\n5.4 × 10\n7\n \n\n\n4.1 × 10\n7\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n3 × 10\n8\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n2 h, 250 rpm\n\n\n37° C.\n\n\n100\n\n\nμg/ml\n\n\n2.3 × 10\n8\n \n\n\n \n \n8 × 10\n5\n \n\n\n6.8 × 10\n7\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \ninput\n 10\n10\n \n\n\n2 h, 250 rpm\n\n\n37° C.\n\n\n0\n\n\nμg/ml\n\n\n3.9 × 10\n8\n \n\n\n4.4 × 10\n8\n \n\n\n4.8 × 10\n8\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTests with DOM4-130-54 on Phage\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDOM4-130-54 was tested in a similar protocol as described above.

Random mutations were introduced in the genes by PCR using the Stratagene Mutazyme II kit, biotinylated primers and 5-50 pg of template for a 50 n1 reaction. After digestion with SalI and NotI, the inserts were purified from undigested products with streptavidin-coated beads and ligated into pDOM13 at the corresponding sites. \nE. coli \nTB1 cells were transformed with the purified ligation mix resulting in large repertoires of tetracycline-resistant clones: 8.5×10\n8 \n(DOM4-130-54), 1.5×10\n9 \n(DOM1h-131-511), 6×10\n8 \n(DOM15-10) and 3×10\n9 \n(DOM15-26-555).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPhage libraries were prepared by double precipitation with PEG and resuspended in PBS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe rates of amino acid mutations were 2.3 and 4.4 for the DOM1h-131-511 and DOM4-130-54 repertoires, respectively. The functionality was assessed by testing 96 clones in phage ELISA using wells coated with protein A or protein L (at 1 μg/ml). 62.5% and 27% of the clones exhibited functional display of dAbs in the DOM1h-131-511 and DOM4-130-54 repertoires, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe rates of amino acid mutations were 2.5 and 4.6 for the DOM15-10 and DOM15-26-555 repertoires, respectively.

The pDOM5 vector is a pUC119-based vector. Expression of proteins is driven by the Plac promoter. A GAS1 leader sequence (see WO 2005/093074) ensured secretion of isolated, soluble dAbs into the periplasm and culture supernatant of \nE. coli \nJM83. 96 and 72 individual colonies from \nround\n 3 and \nround\n 4 were randomly picked for expression\n\n\n \n \n \n \n12-24 clones were sequenced from each \nround\n 3 and \nround\n 4 output. Consensus mutations were observed in both selections and approximately 25 clones harboring consensus motifs were chosen for further characterization. The amino acid sequences of these clones are shown in \nFIG. 3\n (DOM1h-131-511 selected variants) and \nFIG. 4\n (DOM4-130-54 selected variants) and listed as DNA sequences in \nFIGS. 19A-19L\n. The amino acids that differ from the parent sequence in selected clones are highlighted (those that are identical are marked by dots). The loops corresponding to CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 are outlined with boxes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese clones were expressed in a larger amount, purified on protein L (for DOM4-130-54 variants) and protein A (for DOM1h-131-511 variants) and tested for antigen binding on BIAcore after one hour or overnight incubation at 37° C. in the presence or absence of trypsin (100 μg/ml or 1000 μg/ml final concentration).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, the outputs from the DOM4-130-54 selections were more stable with most clones remaining resistant to trypsin for one hour and the best clones resistant overnight. In comparison, a small number of clones from the DOM1h-131-511 selections were resistant to trypsin for one hour, whilst none of the clones were resistant overnight.\n\n\n \nExample 5\n\n\nAnalysis of Selection Outputs\n\n\nDOM15-10 and DOM15-26-555 Repertoires\n\n\n \n \n \nThe effectiveness of selection with trypsin pre-treatment was first tested on monoclonal phage ELISA with and without trypsin digestion. Eighteen colonies from the second round of selection and 24 colonies from the third round of selection of each library were picked. Clones DOM15-10, DOM15-26-501 and DOM15-26 were used as controls. Additional controls included amplified and purified phage solution from each library after second and third rounds of trypsin selection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach phage sample was divided into two fractions, the first was treated with 100 ug/ml trypsin, the second was not treated with trypsin. Incubation of both fractions was carried out for one hour at 37° C. with agitation (250 rpm) and blocked by adding Roche Complete Protease Inhibitor (1×).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPhage ELISA was performed using the trypsin-digested and undigested samples. ELISA wells were coated with neutravidin in 0.1M bicarbonate buffer at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. After the washing steps with PBS and blocking of the antigen-coated wells with 1% Tween-20 in PBS for one hour at room temperature, the wells were coated with biotinylated hVEGF diluted in 1% Tween-20 in PBS at a concentration of 100 ng/ml. Next, the wells were washed with PBS and treated or untreated phage supernatants diluted 1:1 with 1% Tween-20/PBS, were added. After 30 minutes of incubation at 37° C., the wells were washed with 1% Tween-20/PBS, followed by a 30 minute incubation at 37° C. with anti-M13 phage-HRP conjugate (diluted 1/5000 in 1% Tween-20/PBS). The wells were then washed with PBS and peroxidase. Reaction was initiated by adding SureBlue reagent.

The enrichment of trypsin resistant clones is visible in both libraries after the third round of selection. The values of control ELISA wells containing amplified purified phage mix after each selection were much higher than 0.404 in each case after trypsin digestion. Moreover, a small increase in signal was observed when comparing trypsin-treated phage from the third round of selection with trypsin-treated phage from the second round of selection. The DOM15-10 phage library showed an increase of about 14% of the starting value. DOM15-26-555 phage library showed an increase that represents about 2% of the starting value.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOverall these results show that selection with trypsin pre-treatment was effective to select trypsin-resistant phage clones from the DOM15-10 and DOM15-26-555 repertoires.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll outputs from the second and third rounds of selection (DOM15-26-555) and from the third round of selection only (DOM15-10) were subcloned into the pDOM5 vector and transformed into HB2151 electrocompetent cells. The pDOM5 vector is a pUC119-based vector. Expression of proteins is driven by the Plac promoter. A GAS1 leader sequence ensured secretion of isolated, soluble dAbs into the periplasm and culture supernatant of \nE. coli \nHB2151. 184 individual colonies from each round of selection (3 and 4) were randomly picked for expression in 1 ml culture volumes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBacterial supernatants were diluted in HBS-EP BIAcore buffer (1:1 volume ratio) and split to duplicates. Trypsin was added to only one vial at a final concentration of 20 μg/ml. Incubation was carried out for 40 minutes at 37° C. with agitation (250 rpm). After blocking the reaction with Roche Complete Protease Inhibitor (1×), both trypsin treated and untreated phage supernatants were tested on \nBIAcore\n 3000 for antigen binding (2,000 RU of biotinylated hVEGF on a SA sensorchip).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe criteria for picking clones were: a decrease in antigen binding of <15% of dAbs treated with trypsin relative to untreated dAbs (based on max RU reached on selected time point), which would reflect dAbs stability to protease treatment in general; and off-rate decrease of <40% between two time points during dissociation of a dAb from the antigen. Based on these values, 60 clones from both the second and third rounds of selection of the DOM15-26-555 library and 17 clones from the third round of selection of the DOM15-10 library were sequenced. Consensus mutations were observed in both libraries' outputs and 17 clones from each library harboring consensus motifs were chosen for further characterization. The amino acid sequences of these clones are shown in \nFIG. 5\n (DOM15-26-555 selected variants) and \nFIG. 6\n (DOM15-10 selected variants) and listed as DNA sequences in \nFIGS. 20A-20E\n. The amino acids that differ from the parent sequence in selected clones are highlighted (those that are identical are marked by dots). The loops corresponding to CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 are outlined by boxes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese clones were expressed in 50 ml expression cultures, purified on protein A (for DOM15-26-555 variants) or protein L (for DOM15-10 variants) diluted to 100 nM concentration in HBS-EP buffer and tested for antigen binding on BIAcore after 1.5 hours of incubation at 37° C. with agitation (250 rpm) in the presence or absence of trypsin (20 μg/ml final concentration).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese clones were also tested for trypsin resistance using the method described in Example 2. Proteins were buffer exchanged to PBS and concentrated to 1 mg/ml. 25 μg of protein was mixed with 1 μg of trypsin (Promega) and incubated for 0 hours and 24 hours at 30° C. After this time, the reaction was blocked with Roche Complete Protease Inhibitor (1×) and DTT, as well as loading agent, was added Samples were denatured for five minutes at 100° C. Then 15 ng of each sample was analyzed by electrophoresis on Novex 10-20% Tricine gels and proteins were stained with SureBlue (1×).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, the outputs from the DOM15-26-555 selections were more stable, with most clones remaining resistant to trypsin for 1.5 hours when tested on BIAcore and overnight when run on SDS-PAGE. In comparison, only a small number of clones from the DOM15-10 selections were resistant to trypsin for overnight treatment when run on SDS-PAGE.\n\n\n \nExample 6\n\n\nIdentification of DOM1h-131-511 Variants\n\n\n \n \n \nDOM1h-131-203, DOM1h-131-204 and DOM1h-131-206 were analyzed in further detail.

These two states co-exist at all temperatures and the relative proportion of each state is usually determined by a constant K that is a function of the kinetic constants of folding and unfolding. The melting temperature is usually defined as the temperature at which K=1, i.e. the temperature at which the fraction of folded protein is equal to be fraction of unfolded protein. The constant K is determined by the stabilizing and destabilizing intramolecular interactions of a protein and therefore is primarily determined by the amino acid sequence of the protein. Extrinsic parameters such as temperature, pH, buffer composition, pressure influence K and therefore the melting temperature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnfolded proteins are easy targets for degradation mechanisms: (i) exposure of disulfide bonds increase risks of oxidation or reduction depending on the circumstances, (ii) enhanced backbone flexibility favours auto-proteolytic reactions, (iii) exposure of peptide segments offers targets to proteases in vivo, to proteases during production processes and to carry-over proteases during downstream processing and long-term storage, and (iv) exposure of aggregation-prone segments leads to inter-molecular aggregation and protein precipitation. In all cases, a loss of protein integrity, protein content and protein activity happens, thereby compromising efforts to (i) ensure batch reproducibility, (ii) ensure long-term stability on shelf, and (iii) in vivo efficacy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn nature proteins have been designed by evolution to adequately perform at body temperature and to be readily replaced via homeostatic mechanisms. Therapeutic proteins manufactured through biotechnogical processes face a different environment: they are frequently produced by recombinant DNA technology in a foreign host, are expressed at higher amount in large vessels, undergo very important changes in pH or buffer composition throughout downstream processes and finally are stored at high concentrations in non-physiological buffers for prolonged period of time. New delivery techniques (e.g. inhalation, sc patch, slow delivery nanoparticles) are also adding on the stress undergone by therapeutic proteins. Finally the advent of protein engineering techniques has resulted in the production of enhanced or totally novel therapeutic proteins. Because most engineering techniques are in-vitro based techniques aimed at altering or creating new amino acid sequences, evolution processes that have gradually improved biological proteins do not take place, hence resulting in proteins of sub-optimal performances with regards to stress resistance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe technique of the present invention aims at reproducing one of the conditions faced by proteins throughout Darwinian evolution. Peptides or polypeptides, eg immunoglobulin single variable domains are infused with proteases that play a major role in tissue remodelling and protein homeostasis. Any particular mutation that may result in a protein with an improved fit to its function is also tested for its ability to fit within the environment it is performing in. This process is reproduced in one embodiment of the present invention: a repertoire of peptide or polypeptide variants is created and exposed to a protease. In a second step, the repertoire of variants is contacted with a specific target. Only those protein variants that have sustained degradation by the protease are able to engage with the target and therefore recovered, eg, by a simple affinity purification process named ‘biopanning’. The system offers a number of advantages in comparison to in vivo processes: the protein repertoire can be faced with a wider range of conditions, eg a range of proteases, at higher concentrations, for longer times, in different buffers or pHs and at different temperatures. Thus this in vitro technology offers a means to design proteins that may perform and remain stable in a wider range of environments than those they originate from. Clearly this offers multiple advantages for the biotechnological industry and for the area of therapeutic proteins in particular.\n\n\n \nExample 12\n\n\nPK Correlation Data for Protease Resistant Leads\n\n\n \n \n \nThe parent dAb and a protease-resistant dAb in each of the four dAb lineages, were further evaluated in vivo (see Table15 below for list and details)\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nResistance\n\n\nTm\n\n\nActivity\n\n\nID as Fc\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLineage\n\n\ndAb ID\n\n\nto trypsin\n\n\n(° C.)\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\nfusion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDOM4-130\n\n\nDOM4-130-\n\n\n \nGood\n \n\n\n54\n\n\n0.128*\n\n\n \nDMS1541\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n54\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDOM4-130-\n\n\nVery high\n\n\n64\n\n\n0.160\n*\n \n \nDMS1542\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n202\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDOM1h-\n\n\nDOM1h-131-\n\n\n \nGood\n \n\n\n57\n\n\n0.048†\n\n\nDMS1543\n\n\n\n\n\n\n131\n\n\n511\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDOM1h-131-\n\n\nVery high\n\n\n64\n\n\n0.047†\n\n\n \nDMS1544\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n206\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDOM15-10\n\n\nDOM15-10\n\n\n \nLow\n \n\n\n64\n\n\n0.913†\n\n\nDMS1546\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDOM15-10-\n\n\nHigh\n\n\n63\n\n\n0.577†\n\n\n \nDMS1531\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDOM15-26\n\n\nDOM 15-26-\n\n\nLow\n\n\n52\n\n\n0.330†\n\n\nDMS1545\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n501(*)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDOM 15-26-\n\n\n \nHigh\n \n\n\n65\n\n\n0.033†\n\n\nDMS1529\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n593\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(*)as determined by MRC5/IL-a bioassay;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n†as determined by RBA assay\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDOM15-26-501 is a parent version of DOM15-26-555 exemplified above in this patent application.

Indeed the renal glomerular filtration cut-off is above 50 kDa and therefore small proteins such as dAbs are not retained in the circulation as they pass through the kidneys. Therefore, in order to evaluate the long term effects of resistance to proteases in vivo, we tag domain antibodies with a moiety that increases systemic residence. Several approaches (e.g. PEG, Fc fusions, albumin fusion, etc) aiming at extending half-life have been reported in the literature. In this application the domain antibodies have been tagged (or formatted) with the Fc portion of the human IgG1 antibody. This format offers two advantages: (i) the molecular size of the resulting dAb-Fc is ˜75 kDa which is large enough to ensure retention in circulation, (ii) the antibody Fc moiety binds to the FcRn receptor (also know as “Brambell” receptor). This receptor is localized in epithelial cells, endothelial cells and hepatocytes and is involved in prolonging the life-span of antibodies and albumin: indeed upon pinocytosis of antibodies and other serum proteins, the proteins are directed to the acidified endosome where the FcRn receptor intercepts antibodies (through binding to the Fc portion) before transit to the endosome and return these to the circulation. Thus by tagging the Fc portion to the dAb, it is ensured that the dAbs will exposed for long period to two at least compartments—the serum and the pre-endosomal compartments, each of which containing a specific set of proteolytic enzymes. In addition, the FcRn receptor mediates transcytosis whereby Fc-bearing proteins migrate to and from the extravascular space.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormatting with Fc was accomplished by fusing the gene encoding the VH and VK dAbs to the gene encoding the human IgG1 Fc, through a short intervening peptide linker (in bold):\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor a VH dAb (underlined):\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nEVQ . . . GQGTLVTVSSASTHTCPPCPAPELLGGP . . .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(hIgG1Fc) . . . PGK*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor a VK dAb (underlined):\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDIQ . . . GQGTKVEIKRTVAAPSTHTCPPCPAPELLGG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP . . . (hIgG1Fc) . . . PGK*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMaterial was produced by transient transfection of HEK293/6E cells using 293-fectin (Invitrogen) according to standard protocols. These cells are designed for high-level transient expression when used in conjunction with the pTT series of vectors (Durocher et al 2002). Thus the dAb genes were cloned into a modified pTT5 vector (pDOM38) to generate the Fc fusion expression vector (see \nFIG. 21\n). The supernatant from the transfected cells was harvested at 5 days post-transfection, clarified by centrifugation and filtered through a 0.2 μm filter. The dAb-Fc fusion proteins were purified by capture onto Protein-A streamline resin (GE Healthcare). Protein was eluted from the column in 10 mM sodium citrate pH3, followed by the addition of and 1M sodium citrate pH6, to achieve a final composition of 100 mM sodium citrate pH6.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dAb-Fc molecules were tested for in vivo half life in the rat at a target dose of 5 mg/kg into female Sprague-Dawley rats (n=3 per group). It should be noted that the target dose vastly exceeds target concentration in rats, so it is expected that differences in affinities between parent dAbs and trypsin-resistant dAbs (see example 11) will not impact on the fate of the molecules in vivo. Hence differences in PK profiles between dAbs are expected to reflect on an antigen-independent elimination process.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBlood samples were taken after 0.03, 1, 4, 8, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120 and 168 hours post administration.

The effects are mostly visible when AUC/D is considered: the AUC/D of 15-10 is only 42% of that of 15-10-11. The AUC/D of 15-26-501 is only 11% of that of 15-26-593. These important differences also impact (to a lesser extent) half-lives: 43.2 h versus 56.6 h for 15-10 and 15-10-11, respectively. A greater difference is seen with the DOM15-26 lineage: 12.9 h versus 86.2 h for 15-26-501 and 15-26-593, respectively. Indeed for a good PK analysis using non-compartmental analysis, there should be at least 4 data points used to fit the linear regression slope and the period of time over which the half life is estimated should be at least 3 times that of the calculated half life.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn light of the biophysical properties described in the examples herein, it appears that the ability of any given dAb to resist degradation by trypsin is correlated with the ability of the dAb-Fc fusion to circulate for longer period in the rat serum. Indeed as shown in the examples, such as Example 10, DOM15-10 and DOM15-26-501 are the most degradable dAbs: incubation of 25 ug dAb in the presence of 1 ug of trypsin at 30° C. for ˜3 h resulted in complete degradation. All other dAbs in this study (whether they had been selected with trypsin (ie. DOM15-10-11, DOM15-26-593, DOM4-130-202 and DOM1h-131-206) or whether they already had some trypsin resistance as parent molecules (DOM4-130-54 and DOM1h-131-511)) have comparable PK profile in rats when re-formatted into dAb-Fc molecules. Thus, the present PK study suggests that susceptibility to proteolysis has its biggest impact on the in vivo stability of dAbs when those dAbs have very low resistance to proteolysis. It also shows that—beyond a certain level—further increments in resistance to degradation by trypsin (e.g. DOM4-130-206 v DOM4-130-54) do not significantly add up to the ability of the dAb-Fc molecule to further slow down elimination in vivo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn three cases, selection in the presence of trypsin resulted in new molecules with increased thermal stability (defined by the melting temperature): DOM4-130-202, DOM1h-131-206 and DOM15-26-593. The PK study indicates that—in the present dataset—melting temperature is not an adequate parameter to rationalize the observed PK profiles: indeed DOM15-10 has a higher Tm than DOM15-10-11 and yet is more rapidly cleared than DOM15-10-11 from the circulation. Elsewhere, the two dAbs of the DOM4-130 lineage have markedly different Tm (by 10° C.) and yet show almost identical stability in vivo when formatted into dAb-Fc molecules. It should be noted that melting temperature is not per se excluded as key parameter to predict in vivo stability. It just happens that with the present dataset, large Tm differences (from 54° C. and above) have not a significant impact on the fate of dAbs in vivo. This doesn't exclude the possibility that at melting temperature lower than 54° C., the in vivo stability of dAbs may correlate with thermal stability, or perhaps even with thermal stability and resistance to proteases altogether.\n\n\n \nExample 13\n\n\nTrypsin Selections on DOM10-53-474\n\n\nTrypsin Stability of Purified DOM10-53-474:\n\n\n \n \n \nDOM10-53-474 is a domain antibody which binds to IL-13 with a high potency. To assess the stability of this dAb in the presence of trypsin, purified dAb was digested with trypsin for increased time points and run on a gel to examine any possible protein degradation. 25 μl of purified DOM10-53-474 at 1 mg/ml was incubated with 1 μl of sequencing grade trypsin at 1 mg/ml at 30° C., resulting in molecular ratio of 25:1 dAb:trypsin. dAb was incubated with trypsin for 1 h, 4 h and 24 h and the protease activity was neutralised by addition of 4 μl of Roche complete protease inhibitors followed by incubation on ice. \nTime\n 0 sample was made by adding protease inhibitors to dAb without adding trypsin. 2 μl of sample was subsequently analysed by electrophoresis using Labchip according to manufacturers instructions.\n\n\n\nFIG. 22\n shows a gel run with DOM10-53-474 incubated with trypsin for increased time points. For comparison one of the trypsin stable dAbs, DOM15-26-593 was also treated with trypsin as explained above and was run alongside. As shown in the figure, DOM15-26-593 looks stable even after 24 h incubation with trypsin. However, DOM10-53-474 is degraded to a certain extent after 24 h, but looking stable at 1 h and 4 h time points. These data suggests that DOM10-53-474 is resistant to degradation by trypsin to a certain extent, but is not as stable as one of the most trypsin stable dAbs DOM15-26-593.\n\n\n\n \nTrypsin Stability of Phage-Displayed DOM10-53-474:\n\n\n \n \n \nTo assess the trypsin stability of phage displayed DOM10-53-474, the gene encoding DOM10-53-474 was cloned into Sal/Not sites of pDOM33 (\nFIG. 50\n) and phage produced according to standard techniques. Phage was purified by PEG precipitation, resuspended in PBS and titered.\n\n\nPhage displayed dAbs were incubated with trypsin for different time points to evaluate trypsin resistance. Following incubation with trypsin, stability was measured by titre analysis following infection of exponentially growing \nE. coli \nTG1 cells.\n\n\n100 μl of phage was incubated in 100 μg/ml trypsin for 1 h, 2 h, 4 h and overnight at 37C, in a shaking incubator. Trypsin activity was blocked with Roche complete protease inhibitor (×2) and then phage was diluted in 2% marvel in PBS, incubated with 10 nM biotinylated IL-13 for one hour at room temperature. Streptavidin-coated beads (Dynabeads M-280 (Invitrogen) that were pre-blocked for one hour at room temperature with 2% marvel in PBS was added, and the mixture was then incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature. All of the incubation steps with Dynabeads were carried out on a rotating wheel. Unbound phage was washed away by washing the beads eight times with 1 ml of 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS. Bound phage was eluted with 0.5 ml of 0.1M Glycine pH 2.2 and neutralized with 100 μl of 1M Tris-HCL pH 8.0. Eluted phage was used to infect exponentially growing TG1 (1 h at 37° C.) and plated on tetracycline plates. Plates were incubated at 37° C. overnight and colony counts were made. Phage output titres following digestion with trypsin is summarised in Table 17. Phage titres decreased when incubated with trypsin for increased time points.

After digestion with SalI and NotI, inserts were purified from undigested products with streptavidin coated beads and ligated into pDOM33 at the corresponding sites. \nE. Coli TB\n1 cells were transformed with purified ligation mix resulting in an error prone library of DOM10-53-474. The size of the library was 1.9×10\n9 \nand the rate of amino acid mutation was 1.3.\n\n\nThree rounds of selections were performed with this library to select for dAbs with improved protease resistance. First round of selection was performed only with antigen without trypsin treatment to clean up the library to remove any clones that no longer bound antigen with high affinity. Selection was carried out at 10 nM IL-13. The outputs from round one were 2×10\n9 \ncompared to input phage of 6×10\n10 \nindicating that majority of library bound antigen with high affinity.\n\n\nThe second and third rounds of selections were performed with 1 nM biotinylated IL-13. Prior to panning on IL-13, phage was incubated with 100 μg/ml of trypsin at 37° C. in a shaker (250 rpm). For second round selection, trypsin incubation was carried out for 1 h either at room temperature or at 37° C.

Two clones, DOM1h-131-202 and DOM1h-131-206 were selected for further characterisation as they showed the most significant improvement to the action of trypsin. Further work as outlined below shows that with the improved resistance to the action of trypsin there are other beneficial effects, primarily on the stability of the molecules to shear and thermal stress. These two parameters are central to increasing the storage and shelf life stability of biopharmaceutical products.\n\n\n \n \nProduction of Lead DOM0101 dAbs in \nPichia pastoris: \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe genes encoding the primary amino acid sequence of the three lead molecules was used to produce secreted protein in \nPichia pastoris\n. The three synthetic genes (DOM1h-131-511, DOM1h-131-202 and DOM1h-131-206) were cloned into the expression vector pPIC-Za and then transformed into two \nPichia \nstrain, X33 and KM71H. The transformed cells were plated out onto increasing concentrations of Zeocin (100, 300, 600 and 900 μg/ml) to select for clones with multiple integrants. Several clones were then screened in 2 L flasks to identify high expressing cell lines. The best expressing clones were then used to produce material at 5 L scale in fermenters.\n\n\n \nProtein Purification and Material Characterization:\n\n\n \n \n \nIn order to produce high quality material for characterisation and further stability studies, a downstream purification process was devised using a mixed modal charge induction resin (Capto MMC) as the primary capture step followed by anion exchange (Q Sepharose). Without significant optimisation, this allowed the recovery of ˜70% of the expressed dAb at a purity of ˜95%. The material was characterised for identity using electrospray mass spectrometry, amino terminal sequencing and isoelectric focusing and for purity using SDS-PAGE and SEC (size exclusion chromatography).\n\n\n \nProtein Identity:\n\n\n \n \n \nThe amino terminal sequence analysis of the first five residues of each protein, was as expected (EVQLL . . . ). Mass spectrometry was performed on samples of the proteins which had been buffer exchanged into 50:50 H\n2\nO:acetonitrile containing 0.1% glacial acetic acid using C4 Zip-tips (Millipore). The measured mass for each of the three proteins was within 0.5 Da of the theoretical mass based on the primary amino acid sequence (calculated using average masses) when allowing for a mass difference of −2 from the formation of the internal disulphide bond. IEF was used to identify the proteins based on their p1 which was different for each protein.\n\n\n \nProtein Purity:\n\n\n \n \n \nThe three proteins were loaded onto non-reducing SDS-PAGE gels in 1 μg and 10 μg amounts in duplicate. A single band was observed in all instance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSize exclusion chromatography was also performed to demonstrate levels of purity. For size exclusion chromatography (SEC) 100 μg of each protein were loaded onto a TOSOH G2000 SWXL column flowing at 0.5 ml/min. Mobile phase was PBS/10% ethanol. The percentage of monomer was measured based on the area under the curve (see \nFIG. 23\n).\n\n\n \n \nComparison of Stability of DOM1h-131-511, -202 and -206\n\n\n \nAssessment of Protease Stability:\n\n\n \n \n \nThe protease stability of DOM1h-131-511, DOM1h-131-202 and DOM1h-131-206 was assessed by BIAcore™ analysis of the residual binding activity after pre-incubation for defined timepoints in excess of proteases. Approximately 1400 RU of biotinylated TNFR1 was coated to a streptavidin (SA) chip. 250 nM of DOM1h-131-511, DOM1h-131-202 and DOM1h-131-206 was incubated with PBS only or with 100 ug/ml of trypsin, elastase or leucozyme for 1, 3, and 24 hour at 30° C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of a cocktail of protease inhibitors. The dAb/protease mixtures were then passed over the TNFR1 coated chip using reference cell subtraction. The chip surface was regenerated with 10 ul 0.1M glycine pH 2.2 between each injection cycle. The fraction of DOM1h-131-511, DOM1h-131-202 and DOM1h-131-206 bound to human TNFR1 (at 10 secs) pre-incubated with proteases was determined relative to dAb binding without proteases. BIAcore™ runs were carried out at 25° C. The data below was produced from three independent experiments. The bar graph indicates mean values and the error bars indicate standard deviation of the results (\nFIG. 24\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt was found that DOM1h-131-202 and DOM1h-131-206 were shown to have greater resistance to proteolytic degradation by trypsin, elastase or leucozyme in comparison to DOM1h-131-511. The difference between DOM1h-131-202 and DOM1h-131-206 in comparison to DOM1h-131-511 is most pronounced after 1 hr with trypsin and after 3 hrs with elastase or leucozyme. There is a trend that DOM1h-131-206 is slightly more stable compared to DOM1h-131-202 in most of the conditions tested.\n\n\n \n \nThermal Stability of the dAbs as Determined Using DSC:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to determine at which pH the lead molecules had the greatest stability, differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) was used to measure the melting temperatures (T\nm\n) of each dAb in Britton-Robinson buffer. As Britton-Robinson is made up of three component buffer systems (40 mM of each of acetic, phosphoric and boric acid), it is possible to produce a pH range from 3-10 in the same solution. The theoretical p1 was determined from the proteins primary amino acid sequence. From the DSC, the pH at which the dAbs had their greatest intrinsic thermal stability was found to be \npH\n 7 for DOM1h-131-202, pH 7-7.5 for DOM1h-131-206 and pH 7.5 for DOM1h-131-511. For all subsequent stress and stability work the following pHs were used for each dAb; for DOM1h-131-202 and GSK1995057A DOM1h-131-206 pH 7.0 and for DOM1h-131-511 pH 7.5 in Britton-Robinson buffer. The results are summarised in Table 20.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of the pH and T\nm\ns of DOM1h-131-202, DOM1h-131-206 and\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDOM1h-131-511 as determined by DSC in Britton-Robinson buffer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nat 1 mg/ml.

Under these conditions, protein may undergo several physical processes such as aggregation or chemical modification. The dAbs (at 1 mg/ml) were incubated at 37 and 50° C. for 14 days in Britton-Robinson buffer. SEC was used to determine how much monomer was left in solution over the 14 day period (\nFIG. 25\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFrom \nFIG. 25\n it can be seen that both DOM1h-131-202 and DOM1h-131-206 are significantly more stable than DOM1h-131-511 to thermal stress. Exposing proteins to elevated temperatures, such as 37 and 50° C., are routinely used to give an indication on a drug's long term shelf-life. These higher temperatures are used to accelerate the normal process associated with long term storage at room temperature such as deamidation, oxidation or aggregation. The level of aggregation formation in solution can also be monitored using SEC (\nFIG. 26A\n to I). After 14 days at 37° C., the loss of DOM1h-131-511 from solution can be attributed to both precipitation and the formation of higher ordered aggregates as determined by SEC (\nFIG. 26B\n). A significantly lower loss in protein is also seen with both DOM1h-131-202 and DOM1h-131-206 at 37° C. after 14 days with very little or no substantial increase in aggregate formation, especially in the case of DOM1h-131-206 (\nFIG. 26H\n). At 50° C., the difference between the molecules is even more pronounced, with DOM1h-131-206 showing better stability at the higher temperature than DOM1h-131-202 after 14 days, showing significantly reduced formation of higher molecular weight aggregates (\nFIG. 26\n). Relative to the t=0, DOM1h-131-206 shows only a small increased in aggregate formation after 14 days (\nFIG. 26I\n), whereas DOM1h-131-511 has all but precipitated out of solution (\nFIG. 26C\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis shows that the changes introduced into the dAb by the trypsin selections, e.g. the improved thermal stability, has significantly improved the protein storage stability at 37 and 50° C. Both DOM1h-131-202 and more significantly DOM1h-131-206, clearly have improved solution stability and lower tendency to form aggregates at elevated temperatures which can directly be translated to improved long term storage stability at more relevant temperatures such +4° C. and room temperature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSamples from 24 hr, 48 hr, 7 days and 14 days time points from the thermal stress experiment were then analysed by IEF to see if the proteins had undergone any biophysical changes which would affect the overall charge of the protein (\nFIG. 27\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAgain both DOM1h-131-202 and DOM1h-131-206 show no significant changes at 37° C. compared to DOM1h-131-511. With DOM1h-131-511 a faint second band appears at 37° C. after 24 hrs. It is believed this extra banding is due to dimerisation of the protein, thus masking charge and producing two populations of molecules. At 50° C. the difference between the molecules is more pronounced, DOM1h-131-206 clearly shows no significant changes at the elevated temperature whereas DOM1h-131-202 is showing some sign of modification after 24 hr. The majority of DOM1h-131-511 is lost by precipitation after 48 hr in Britton-Robinson.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe T=0, 7 and 14 day time points at 50° C. were analysed by the TNFR-1 RBA to determine the functionality of the protein after exposure to high temperatures (\nFIG. 28\n). The assay is currently not as sensitive as SEC or IEF at detecting subtle changes to the molecule due to stress, but it can be used show that the dAb can still bind to the antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe shift in the curve to the left for DOM1h-131-511 reflects the fact that the majority of the dAb has been lost due to precipitation. The material that is left in solution is still able to bind antigen. As shown in \nFIG. 25\n, the majority of both DOM1h-131-202 and DOM1h-131-206 are able to be maintained in solution even after 14 days. The RBA shows that all the soluble protein is still functional and able to bind to TNFR1.\n\n\n \nStorage Stability Testing at High Protein Concentrations:\n\n\n \n \n \nExperiments were carried out to investigate the storage stability at +4° C. at very high protein concentrations to see how each molecule performed under these conditions. All the lead dAbs were concentrated in centrifugal Vivaspin concentrators (5K cut-off) in Britton-Robinson buffer at their most stable pH, to ˜100 mg/ml. The samples at ˜100 mg/ml were then left at +4° C. for 7 days and then analysed by SEC to see if any other physical changes had occurred to the samples during storage at high concentrations (\nFIG. 29\n). The samples were diluted to ˜1 mg/ml before being run on the SEC column in 1×\nPBS\n 10% ethanol (v/v).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFrom the SEC traces it can be seen that neither DOM1h-131-202 nor DOM1h-131-206 show any significant increase in the formation of aggregates after 7 days, where as there is ˜2% reduction in the monomer concentration for DOM1h-131-511.\n\n\n \n \nNebuliser Delivery of the Lead dAbs:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor early stage toxicology and clinical work, the dAbs will be formulated as a liquid and delivered via a nebulising device. Depending on the device (eg, ultrasonic, jet or vibrating mesh), the dAb will experience a degree of shear and thermal stress as it was nebulised to form a aerosol of defined particle size. As both DOM1h-131-202 and -206 have higher T\nm\n's and showed considerably improved stability to thermal stress compared to DOM1h-131-511, all the dAbs were tested in two nebuliser devices to see how they responded to shear/thermal stress induced during nebulisation. Both the protein from the nebulised aerosol and the remaining dAb in the device (i.e. in the cup) were then analysed by SEC to determine the amount of aggregation generated during the process.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll the molecules were tested in Britton-Robinson buffer at their most stable pH. The dAbs were tested in both the E-flow Rapid (vibrating mesh) and Pari LC+ (jet nebuliser) with run time of 3.5 minutes at a protein concentration of 5 mg/ml and the particle size distribution determined using a Malvern Spraytek. The results are shown in \nFIG. 30\n. For good delivery and distribution into the deep lung, the ideal particle size is <5 μm. All the dAbs give comparable levels of particle sizes that were less than 5 μm in Britton-Robinson buffer. The concentration of the dAb in the cup of the device was determined by A\n280 \nmeasurements before and after nebulisation (data not shown). It was found that the protein concentration did not change significantly indicating that neither the protein nor vehicle are preferentially nebulised during delivery.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSamples of the dAbs nebulised in Britton-Robinson buffer were run on SEC to determine if during delivery the protein had undergone any physical changes. \nFIG. 31\n shows the relative percentage change in either the cup or the aerosol as determined by SEC. It can be seen that both DOM1h-131-202 and DOM1h-131-206 undergo relative small changes in the concentration of monomer relative to DOM1h-131-511. This demonstrates that both DOM1h-131-202 and DOM1h-131-206 with their improved T\nm\n's have less propensity to aggregate during nebulisation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 32\n shows the actual SEC traces for DOM1h-131-206 and DOM1h-131-511 in Britton-Robinson buffer post nebulisation and demonstrates that the relative loss in monomer (\nFIG. 31\n) is due to dimer formation. This again provides further supporting evidence to the theory that the greater thermal stability shown by DOM1h-131-202 and DOM1h-131-206 can prevent significant aggregation even in an unoptimised formulation buffer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor toxicology and safety assessment work, it is necessary to delivery the dAb at significantly higher levels into the animal than the therapeutic doses given to patients. This can only be achieved by using significantly higher protein concentrations and/or delivering the dAb over a prolonged period of time. As it had already been shown that DOM1h-131-511 forms aggregates on nebulisation at 5 mg/ml over 3.5 mins, DOM1h-131-206 was tested at 40 mg/ml in PBS and nebulised using the Pari LC+ for up to 1 hour. Samples from the cup and aerosol were taken at the time points to throughout the run to see if the prolong nebulisation caused the dAbs to aggregate due to shear or thermal stress as determined by SEC and the protein concentration (A280 nm measurements). Table 21 shows the protein concentration of the dAb both in the cup and aerosol as determined by A280.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasured protein concentration of DOM1h-131-206 as determined\n\n\n\n\n\n\nby A280 absorbance readings for both the cup and aerosol during\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnebulisation of the dAb at ~40 mg/ml using the Pari LC+.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAllowing for dilution errors and instrumental error the sample\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconcentration does not change after nebulising the dAb over 1 hr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime\n\n\nCup Sample\n\n\nAerosol Sample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Mins)\n\n\n(mg/ml)\n\n\n(mg/ml)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n43.8\n\n\n43.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n29\n\n\n44.5\n\n\n43.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n59\n\n\n44.6\n\n\n44.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFrom Table 21 it can be seen that the concentration of the protein did not significantly change during the run, demonstrating that there was no significant loss of the protein due to aggregation. \nFIG. 33\n shows that over the period of 1 hour of nebulisation, DOM1h-131-206 does not form any higher ordered aggregates such as dimers as determined by SEC. This clearly demonstrates that the improved biophysical properties, as introduced into the molecule by trypsin selections, significantly increases the dAbs resistance to shear and thermal stress and that this can be directly correlated to improved storage shelf-life and the ability to nebulise the protein so that higher ordered aggregates do not form.\n\n\n \n \nSolution State of the Lead dAbs:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSince the major route of degradation for all the three lead dAbs appears to be self-association leading initially to dimerisation followed by further aggregation and ultimately precipitation, the three lead molecules were investigated by Analytical Ultra-Centrifugation (AUC) to determine the degree of self-association. The proteins were investigated by two methods, sedimentation equilibrium and sedimentation velocity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the sedimentation equilibrium method the three samples were run at three different concentrations ranging from 0.5 mg/ml to 5 mg/ml with centrifugation effects using three different rotor speeds. By this method it was determined that DOM1h-131-511 is a stable dimer (26.1-34.4 kDa), DOM1h-131-202 is monomer/dimer equilibrium (22.7-27.8 kDa) with a relatively stable dimeric state at the concentrations measured with K\nd\n=1.3 μM and DOM1h-131-206 is predominantly monomeric (15.4-17.9 kDa) with a K\nd \nfor the monomer to dimer association of 360 μM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy the sedimentation velocity method all samples showed some degree of dissociation upon dilution. From the results obtained, shown in \nFIG. 34\n, the sedimentation coefficient observed for DOM1h-131-511 is indicative of higher order aggregates and the peak shift upon dilution is an indication of dissociation of these aggregates. The protein aggregation and dissociation cancel each other out which can give the impression of being a stable dimer as observed by sedimentation equilibrium. The sedimentation coefficients observed for DOM1h-131-202 are indicative of a rapid dynamic equilibrium and therefore the monomer and dimer peaks could not be separated from each other, giving the single peak with a higher sedimentation coefficient than is appropriate for the mass of the sample. This result agrees with the result obtained by the sedimentation equilibrium method and the dissociation constant was measured as being 1 μM. DOM1h-131-206 was determined to be more monomeric than the other two samples, having a sedimentation coefficient of 1.9 s as compared to 2.5 s for the other two samples. This data agrees well with the sedimentation equilibrium data. At the concentrations measured, ˜10-fold below the K\nd \nof 360 μM, the sample is predominantly monomeric.\n\n\n \nExample 15\n\n\nPotency Enhancement of the DOM15-26-593 dAb\n\n\n \n \n \nAn example of the enhancement of potency in VEGFR2 Receptor Binding Assay of the DOM15-26-593 dAb over DOM15-26 parent is shown in \nFIG. 40\n. In this assay, the ability of a potential inhibitor to prevent binding of VEGF to VEGFR2 is measured in a plate-based assay. In this assay a VEGFR2-Fc chimera is coated on a 96-well ELISA plate, and to this is added a predetermined amount of VEGF that has been pre-incubated with a dilution series of the test dAb. Following the washing-off of unbound protein, the amount of VEGF bound to the receptor is detected with an anti-VEGF antibody, the level of which is determined colorimetrically. A dose-response effect is plotted as percentage inhibition of VEGF binding as a function of test substance concentration. An effective inhibitor is therefore one that demonstrates substantial blocking of ligand binding at low concentrations.\n\n\n \nFC Fusions Potency and Half Life:\n\n\n \n \n \nThe therapeutic potential of VEGF blockade in the treatment of tumours has been realised for over 30 years. The chronic nature of cancer dictates that biopharmaceuticals require a long serum half life to mediate their effects, and this is not consistent with the rapid clearance of free dAbs from the circulation by renal filtration. To assess the utility of the VEGF dAbs as anti-angiogenics for the treatment of cancer, the lead domain antibodies were formatted as fusions with wild type human IgG1 Fc via a hybrid linker so as to form a bivalent molecule with a serum half life extended by the use of FcRn-mediated antibody salvage pathways.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn this Fc fusion format, the potency of the lead trypsin selected dAb, DOM15-26-593 was compared with the initial parent dAb (DOM15-26) & the trypsin labile dAb (DOM15-26-501) using the assay described previously. The results are shown in the Table 22 below:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPotency (RBA) & half life characteristics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nof DOM15-26 leads in the Fc fusion format\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ndAb\n\n\nFc\n\n\nPotency (nM)\n\n\nT½b (hrs)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDOM15-26\n\n\nhIgG1\n\n\n0.506\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDOM15-26-501\n\n\nhIgG1\n\n\n0.323\n\n\n12.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDOM15-26-593\n\n\nhIgG1\n\n\n0.033\n\n\n84.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt can be seen from these results that in the dimeric Fc fusion format, affinity & potency are enhanced in relation to the free dAbs due to the effect of avidity. It is clear that the potency enhancement obtained in DOM15-26-593 by virtue of trypsin selection is maintained and is even more pronounced in this Fc format. Furthermore, the improvements in thermal and protease stability translate into profound changes in the in vivo pharmacokinetic behaviour of the molecules. The improvement in the elimination half life (see \nFIG. 41\n) of DOM15-26-593 compared with DOM15-26-501 is likely to be a direct consequence of the increased stability of the dAb, rendering it more resistant to the degradative processes that occur within the endosomal compartment. It is also to be expected, therefore, that dAbs with enhanced protease stability are able to persist for longer in other biological compartments such as the serum, mucosal surfaces and various tissue compartments where proteolysis is an active process involved in the turnover of biological molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmacokinetic Clearance Profiles:\n\n\n \n \nPharmacokinetic clearance profiles of DOM15-26-593 and DOM15-26-501 were measured after i.v. administration DOM15-26-593 and DOM15-26-501 to 3 rats at concentrations of 5 mg/kg. Levels of DOM15-26-593 and DOM15-26-501 in the serum were then measured using a direct VEGF binding standard ELISA assay and an anti-human Fc antibody, therefore only intact drug in the serum samples were detected. The full pharmacokinetic profile is shown in the Table 23 below:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary Pharmacokinetic parameters of the\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDOM15-26 & DOM15-26-593 Fc fusions in rat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHalf Life\n\n\nCmax\n\n\nAUC (0-inf)\n\n\nClearance\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndAb\n\n\n(hr)\n\n\n(μg/ml)\n\n\n(hr*μg/ml)\n\n\n(ml/hr/kg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDOM15-26-501\n\n\n12.9\n\n\n91.4\n\n\n445.1\n\n\n11.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDOM15-26-593\n\n\n84.6\n\n\n101.8\n\n\n3810\n\n\n1.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt can be seen from these results that DOM15-26-593 has a significantly improved pharmacokinetic profile with e.g. an extended half life and reduce clearance rate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe significantly improved potency and pharmacokinetic properties of the DOM15-26-593 resulted in analysis of the compound for a range of other biophysical attributes.\n\n\n \n \nSolution state properties: Analysis by SEC-MALLs & AUC:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExperiments were done with DOM15-26-593 as follows:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDOM15-26-593 behaves as a monomer in solution at concentrations of up to 2.5 mg/ml with a calculated molecular mass of 78-81 KDa, consistent with the calculated intact molecular mass of approx 76 kDa (\nFIGS. 42\n \na \n& \n42\n \nb\n).\n\n\n \nThermal Melting Properties: Analysis by DSC\n\n\n \n \n \nExperiments were done with DOM15-26-593 as follows:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe increased thermal stability of the trypsin selected dAb (65° C., \nFIG. 43\n middle panel) is maintained in the Fc fusion (64.5° C., \nFIG. 43\n upper panel). The Tm curve of the DOM15-26-501 dAb (52° C., \nFIG. 43\n lower panel) is shown for comparison.\n\n\n \nStability to Freeze-Thaw, Temperature Stress and Serum Components\n\n\n \n \n \nExperiments were done with DOM15-26-593 as follows:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe stability properties of the DOM15-26-593 dAb mean that the DOM15-26-593 dAb can be subjected to physical and biological stress with minimal effects on its ability to bind VEGF (\nFIGS. 44-47\n (a and b)). For example, the molecule can be repeatedly freeze thawed from liquid nitrogen (−196° C.) to body temperature (37° C.) for 10 cycles without loss of binding activity as determined by ELISA (\nFIG. 44\n). This treatment also resulted in no obvious alterations in the molecule's aggregation state, as assessed by conventional size exclusion chromatography (\nFIG. 45\n). Further tests demonstrated that the molecule can be placed at a range of different temperatures from −80° C. to 55° C. with only a minor drop in antigen binding activity after 168 hours at only the highest incubation temperature (\nFIG. 46\n). Furthermore, incubation with serum from human or cynomolgus monkeys at 37° C. for 14 days caused no loss of antigen binding ability (\nFIGS. 47\n \na \nand \n47\n \nb\n), as determined by the VEGF binding ELISA\n\n\n \nPotency in VEGFR2 Receptor Binding Assay & HUVEC Cell Assay:\n\n\n \n \n \nThe receptor binding assays described above were carried out as follows:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe receptor binding assay described above was used to assess the potency of the Fc fusions (\nFIG. 48\n). It was found that the DOM15-26-593 dAb has enhanced potency in this assay, which establishes the ability of the dAb to block the binding of VEGF to VEGFR2 in vitro. The potency of the DMS1529 was also demonstrated in a HUVEC (Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cell) assay, where the ability of VEGF antagonists to block the VEGF stimulated proliferation of HUVE cells is measured. Cell numbers are determined at the end of a fixed incubation period with a pre-determined amount of VEGF and a varying amount of test article. The more potent the antagonist, the lower the cell proliferation observed (\nFIG. 49\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nucleotide sequence of DOM1h-131-511 is set out in this paragraph and reference herein to the nucleotide sequence of DOM1 h-131-511 “shown in FIG. \n19\n” is a reference to the sequence set out in this paragraph.\n\n\n \n \nThe Nucleotide Sequence of DOM1h-131-511:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGAGGTGCAGC TGTTGGAGTC TGGGGGAGGC TTGGTACAGC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCTGGGGGGTC CCTGCGTCTC TCCTGTGCAG CCTCCGGATT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCACCTTTGCG CATGAGACGA TGGTGTGGGT CCGCCAGGCT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCCAGGGAAGG GTCTAGAGTG GGTCTCACAT ATTCCCCCGG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTTGGTCAGGA TCCCTTCTAC GCAGACTCCG TGAAGGGCCG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGTTCACCATC TCCCGCGACA ATTCCAAGAA CACGCTATAT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCTGCAAATGA ACAGCCTGCG TGCCGAGGAC ACAGCGGTAT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nATTACTGTGC GCTGCTTCCT AAGAGGGGGC CTTGGTTTGA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCTACTGGGGT CAGGGAACCC TGGTCACCGT CTCGAGC"
