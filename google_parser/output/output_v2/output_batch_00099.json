It is divided into two major classes of GABA B receptors, members of the family. The GABA A receptor complex, a membrane-bound heteropentameric protein polymer, is composed primarily of α, β and γ subunits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n  現在、ＧＡＢＡ Ａ受容体の合計２１種のサブユニットがクローニングされ、そして配列決定されている。３種のサブユニット（α、βおよびγ）が、哺乳類の脳細胞から得られる天然のＧＡＢＡ Ａ受容体の生化学的、電気生理学的および薬理学的機能を最も厳密に模倣する組換えＧＡＢＡ Ａ受容体の構築に必要である。ベンゾジアゼピン結合部位がαサブユニットとγサブユニットの間にあることを示す有力な証拠が存在する。組換えＧＡＢＡ Ａ受容体のうち、α１β２γ２は、古典的なＩ型ＢｚＲサブタイプの多くの作用を模倣し、一方、α２β２γ２、α３β２γ２およびα５β２γ２イオンチャンネルはＩＩ型ＢｚＲと名付けられている。\n\n\n  Currently, a total of 21 subunits of GABA A receptor have been cloned and sequenced. Recombinant GABA A in which the three subunits (α, β and γ) most closely mimic the biochemical, electrophysiological and pharmacological functions of natural GABA A receptors obtained from mammalian brain cells Required for receptor construction. There is strong evidence to show that the benzodiazepine binding site is between the α and γ subunits. Of the recombinant GABA A receptors, α1β2γ2 mimics many of the actions of the classic type I BzR subtype, while α2β2γ2, α3β2γ2 and α5β2γ2 ion channels are termed type II BzR.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n  ＭｃＮａｍａｒａおよびＳｋｅｌｔｏｎは、Ｐｓｙｃｈｏｂｉｏｌｏｇｙ，  ２１：１０１−１０８において、ベンゾジアゼピン受容体の逆アゴニストであるβ−ＣＣＭがＭｏ−ｒｒｉｓ水迷路における空間学習を増強することを明らかにしている。しかし、β−ＣＣＭおよび他の従来のベンゾジアゼピン受容体逆アゴニストは、痙攣促進性または痙攣性であり、これがヒトにおける認知増強剤としてのそれらの使用の妨げとなっている。さらに、これらの化合物は、ＧＡＢＡ Ａ受容体サブユニット間で非選択的であるが、ＧＡＢＡ Ａ α\n１\nおよび／またはα\n２\nおよび／またはα\n３\n受容体結合部位における活性が相対的にないＧＡＢＡ Ａ α５受容体の部分逆アゴニストまたは完全逆アゴニストを用いると、痙攣促進活性が低いかまたはない状態で認知を増強するのに有用な医薬を提供することができる。また、ＧＡＢＡ Ａ α\n１\nおよび／またはα\n２\nおよび／またはα\n３\n受容体結合部位において活性がなくはないが、α\n５\n含有サブユニットに対して機能的に選択的であるＧＡＢＡ Ａ α５逆アゴニストを使用することも可能である。しかしながら、ＧＡＢＡ Ａ α５サブユニットに選択的であり、ＧＡＢＡ Ａ α\n１\n、α\n２\nおよびα\n３\n受容体結合部位における活性が相対的にない逆アゴニストが好ましい。\n\nMcNamara and Skelton, in Psychobiology, 21: 101-108, show that β-CCM, an inverse agonist of the benzodiazepine receptor, enhances spatial learning in the Mo-ris water maze. However, β-CCM and other conventional benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonists are proconvulsant or convulsive, which prevents their use as cognitive enhancers in humans. In addition, these compounds are non-selective between GABA A receptor subunits but have relatively little activity at GABA A α \n1\n and / or α \n2\n and / or α \n3\n receptor binding sites. Use of partial or full inverse agonists of the receptor can provide a medicament useful for enhancing cognition with low or no convulsant activity. Although there is no no activity at GABA A alpha \n1\n and / or alpha \n2\n and / or alpha \n3\n receptor binding sites, use GABA A .alpha.5 inverse agonist is functionally selective for alpha \n5\n containing subunits It is also possible to do. However, inverse agonists that are selective for the GABA A α5 subunit and are relatively free of activity at GABA A α \n1\n , α \n2\n and α \n3\n receptor binding sites are preferred.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n  本発明の目的は、式Ｉの化合物および薬学的に許容しうる塩、前記化合物の製造、それらを含有する医薬およびそれらの製造、ならびに疾患、特に前記の種類の疾患および障害の制御もしくは予防における、または相当する医薬の製造における、前記化合物の使用である。\n\n\n  The object of the present invention is in the control or prevention of compounds of formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, the preparation of said compounds, medicaments containing them and their preparation, and diseases, in particular the aforementioned types of diseases and disorders.

Description\n\n\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to a novel heterocyclic compound.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND ART\n\n\n \n \n \nSince causal factor of schizophrenia as well as of bipolar disorder, mood disorders and emotional disorders is heterogeneous, it is desirable that a drug has multiple pharmacological effects so as to develop wide treatment spectrum.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nWO2004/026B69A1\n \n discloses that a carbostyril derivative represented by the general formula:\n\n \n \n\n(wherein A' represents -(CH\n2\n)\nm\nCH\n2\n-, -(CH\n2\n)\nm\nO-, etc. ; m represents an integer of 1 to 4; and R\nA\n represents a hydrogen atom, a C\n1-4\n alkyl group which may be substituted with 1 to 3 fluorine atoms, etc.) has D\n2\n receptor antagonist activity and serotonin 2A (5-HT\n2A\n) receptor antagonist activity and it is effective for treatment of schizophrenia and other central nervous system disorders).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, there is no description in \n \nWO2004/026864A1\n \n that carbostyril derivatives described in the document have D\n2\n -receptor partial agonist activity, 5'-HT\n2A\n receptor antagonist activity, α\n1\n receptor antagonist activity and serotonin uptake inhibitory activity together and have a wide treatment spectrum.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nWO 2005/019215 A1\n \n discloses the compounds represented by the following formula:\n\n \n \n\n(wherein A is -(CH\n2\n)\nm\nCH\n2\n-\n,\n -(CH\n2\n)\nm\nO- or the like; m is an integer of 2 to 5; D is N, C or the like; Z and Q are independently N, C or CH, provided that at least one of Z and Q is N; X and Y are independently C, N or the like, and the bond between X and Y is a single or double bond; R\n1\n is hydrogen, (C\n1\n-C\n3\n)alkyl group or the like; R\n4\n, R\n5\n, R\n6\n and R\n7\n each represents hydrogen, alkyl group or the like; and G represents a group of monocyclic or bicyclic compound), which bind to dopamine D\n2\n receptors. \n \nWO 2005/019215 A1\n \n teaches that some compounds disclosed therein have an activity as partial agonists of D\n2\n receptors or an activity as antagonists of D\n2\n receptors, and may be effective for the treatment of schizophrenia and other central nervous system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, \n \nWO 2005/019215 A1\n \n does not specifically disclose the compounds of the present invention.\n\n\n \nDISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nAn object of the present invention is to provide an antipsychotic drug which has a wider treatment spectrum, less side effects and excellent tolerability and safety as compared with well-known typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present inventors have conducted intensive studies on the above-described problem and consequently succeeded in synthesizing a novel compound which has dopamine D\n2\n receptor partial agonist activity (D\n2\n receptor partial agonist activity), serotonin 5-HT\n2A\n receptor antagonist activity (5-HT\n2A\n receptor antagonist activity) and adrenalin α\n1\n receptor antagonist activity (α\n1\n receptor antagonist activity) and further has serotonin uptake inhibitory effect (or serotonin reuptake inhibitory effect) together in addition to these effects.

It was homogenized in 50 mM Tris-hydrochloric acid buffer (100 mM NaCl, containing 2 mM dihydrogen disodium ethylene diamine tetraacetate, pH 7.4) of a volume 20 times of the weight of the tissue using a homogenizer with a high-speed rotating blade, and centrifuged at 4°C, 80,000 × g for 20 minutes. The obtained precipitate was suspended in the above-described buffer of a volume 20 times of the weight of the tissue and after incubated at 37°C for 10 minutes, centrifuged in the above-described condition. The obtained precipitate was suspended again in the above-described buffer of a volume 20 times of the weight of the tissue and centrifuged in the above-described condition. The obtained precipitate was suspended in 50 mM (Tris)-hydrochloric acid buffer (containing 1 mM dihydrogen disodium ethylene diamine tetraacetate, pH 7.4) of a volume 20 times of the weight of the tissue and preserved by freezing at -85°C till it was used for binding assay as a membrane specimen\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe binding assay was performed using 40 µl of the membrane specimen, 20 µl of [\n3\nH]-prazosin (final concentration 0.2 to 0.5 nM), 20 µl of a test drug and 50 mM Tris-hydrochloric acid buffer (containing 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) so that the total amount was 200 µl (final dimethylsulfoxide concentration 1%).

Cells were seeded at 10\n4\n cells/well on a 96-well microtiter plate coated with poly-L-lysine and grown under the same condition for 2 days. Each well was washed with 100 µl of a culture medium (IMDM culture medium, 0.1 mM sodium hypoxanthine, 16 µM thymidine). The culture medium was replaced with 50 µl of culture medium (IMDM culture medium, 0.1% sodium ascorbate, 0.1 mM sodium hypoxanthine, 16 µM thymidine) having dissolved therein 3 µM of a test compound. After allowed to incubate at 37°C, 5% carbon dioxide condition for 20 minutes, the culture medium was replaced with 100 µl of forskolin stimulative culture medium (IMDM culture medium, 0.1% sodium ascorbate, 0.1 mM sodium hypoxanthine, 16 µM thymidine, 10 µM forskolin, 500 µM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine) having 3 µM of the test compound dissolved therein and allowed to incubate at 37°C, 5% carbon dioxide condition for 10 minutes. After the culture medium was removed, 200 µl of Lysis 1B aqueous solution (Amersham Bioscience, reagent attached to cyclic AMP biotrack enzyme immunoassay system) was dispensed and shaken for 10 minutes. The aqueous solution of each well was used as a sample for measurement. Samples for measurement quadruply diluted were subjected to measurement of the quantity of cyclic AMP using the above-described enzyme immunoassay system. Inhibition ratio of the respective test compound was calculated assuming that the quantity of cyclic AMP of the well to which no test compound was added was 100%. In this empiric test system, dopamine which was used as a control drug suppressed the quantity of cyclic AMP to about 10% as the maximum activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt was confirmed that test compounds had partial agonistic activity for dopamine D\n2\n receptor in the above-described test.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSince the test compounds has partial agonistic activity for dopamine D\n2\n receptor, they can stabilize dopamine neurotransmission to a normal condition in a schizophrenia patient and as a result, exhibit, for example, positive and negative condition improving effect, cognitive impairment improving effect and the other symptom improving effects without causing side effects.\n\n\n \nPharmacological Test 3\n\n\nInhibitory effect on apomorphine-induced stereotyped behavior in rats\n\n\n \n \n \nWistar rats (male, six-seven weeks old, Japan SLC, Inc.) were used as test animals. A test compound was suspended in 5% gum arabic/(physiological saline or water) using an agate mortar and was diluted with the same solvent if necessary.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTest animals were fasted overnight from the day before. Apomorphine (0.7 mg/kg) was subcutaneously administered (1 ml/kg) 1 hour after each test compound was orally administered (5 ml/kg). Stereotyped behavior was observed for 1 minute respectively 20, 30 and 40 minutes after apomorphine injection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe stereotyped behavior of each animal was quantified according to the following condition and score made at three points were summed up and the anti-apomorphine effect was evaluated. Six test animals were used for each group.\n\n \n \n \n0: The appearance of the animals is the same as saline treated rats;\n \n1: Discontinuous sniffing, constant exploratory activity;\n \n2: Continuous sniffing, periodic exploratory activity;\n \n3: Continuous sniffing, discontinuous biting, gnawing or licking. Very brief periods of locomotor activity;\n \n4: Continuous biting, gnawing or licking; no exploratory activity.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nNon-clinical statistical analysis system was used for all statistical processing. When the significance probability value was lower than 0.05, it was judged that a significant difference existed. The difference of the score between the solvent administration group and each test compound administration group was analyzed using Wilcoxon rank-sum test or Steel test. In addition, linear regression analysis was used for calculating 50% effective dose (95 % confidence interval).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSince the test compounds showed inhibitory effect for apomorphine-induced stereotyped behavior, it was confirmed that the test compounds have D\n2\n receptor antagonistic effect.\n\n\n \nPharmacological Test 4\n\n\nInhibitory effect on (±)D-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI) induced head twitch in rats\n\n\n \n \n \nWistar rats (male, six-seven weeks old, Japan SLC, Inc.) were used as test animals. A test compound was suspended in 5% gum arabic/(physiological saline or water) using an agate mortar and was diluted with the same solvent if necessary.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTest animals were fasted overnight from the day before. DOI (5.0 mg/kg) was subcutaneously administered (1 ml/kg) 1 hour after each test compound was orally administered (5 ml/kg). The number of head twitches was counted for 10 minutes immediately after DOI injection. Six test animals were used for each group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-clinical statistical analysis was used for all statistical processing. When the significance probability value was lower than 0.05, it was judged that a significant difference existed. The difference of the number of head twitches between the solvent administration group and each test compound administration group was analyzed using t-test or Dunnett's test. In addition, linear regression analysis was used for calculating 50% effective dose (95 % confidence interval).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSince the test compounds showed inhibitory effect for DOI-induced head twitch, it was confirmed that the test compounds have serotonin 5HT\n2A\n receptor antagonistic effect.\n\n\n \nPharmacological Test 5\n\n\nCatalepsy inducing effect in rats\n\n\n \n \n \nWistar rats (male, six-seven weeks old, Japan SLC, Inc.) were used as test animals. A test compound was suspended in 5% gum arabic/(physiological saline or water) using an agate mortar and was diluted with the same solvent if necessary.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTest animals were fasted overnight from the day before observation on catalepsy and ptosis was performed 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours after each test compound was orally administered (5 ml/kg). Six test animals were used for each group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne forepaw of a rat was placed on an edge of a steel small box (width: 6.5 cm, depth: 4.0 cm, height: 7.2 cm) (an unnatural pose) and when the rat maintained the pose for more than 30 seconds, it was judged that the case was catalepsy positive. This observation was performed three times at each point, and if there was at least one positive case, it was judged that catalepsy occurred in the individual.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a result, catalepsy induction effect of a test compound was dissociated from inhibitory effect on apomorphine-induced stereotyped behavior, therefore it was suggested that apprehension for extrapyramidal side effect in clinic would be low.\n\n\n \nPharmacological Test 6\n\n\nMeasurement of serotonin (5-HT) uptake inhibitory activity of a test compound by rat brain synaptosome\n\n\n \n \n \nWistar male rats were decapitated, the brain was retrieved and frontal cortex was dissected out, and it was homogenized in 0.32 M sucrose solution of a weight 20 times of the weight of the tissue using a Potter type homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 4°C, 1,000 × g for 10 minutes, the obtained supernatant was further centrifuged at 4°C, 20,000 × g for 20 minutes, and the pellet was suspended in an incubation buffer (20 mM Hepes buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10 mM glucose, 145 mM sodium chloride, 4.5 mM potassium chloride, 1.2 mM magnesium chloride, 1.5 mM calcium chloride), which was used as crude synaptosome fraction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n5-HT uptake reaction was performed in a volume of 200 µl using a 96-well round bottom plate and pargyline (final concentration 10 µM) and sodium ascorbate (final concentration 0.2 mg/ml) were contained in the incubation buffer upon reaction and used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIncubation buffer (total counting), non-labeled 5-HT(final concentration 10)µM, non-specific counting) and the diluted test compound (final concentration 300nM) were added to each well.

Insulin is a hormone produced by pancreatic beta cells in the islets of Langerhans. Insulin decreases blood glucose levels, modulates carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, and influences the biosynthesis of protein and RNA.\n\n\nDiabetes mellitus is a syndrome characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from the impairment of insulin secretion and/or insulin action. Impairment of insulin secretion causes type I diabetes mellitus, also known as juvenile insulin-dependant DM (IDDM) or juvenile-onset diabetes. (Merck Manual Sec. 2, Chapter 13, 2005 online version.)\n\n\nImpairment of insulin action and insulin secretion results in \ntype\n 2 diabetes mellitus, also know as non-insulin-dependent mellitus. \nType\n 2 diabetes mellitus is characterized by hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. The hyperglycemia results from both an impaired insulin secretory response to glucose and decreased insulin effectiveness in stimulating skeletal muscle glucose uptake and in restraining hepatic glucose production. The beta cells within the pancreatic islets initially compensate for insulin resistance by increasing insulin output. (Polonsky, \nInt. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. \n24 Suppl 2:S29-31, 2000.)\n\n\nEventually, a patient may be become diabetic due to the inability to properly compensate for insulin resistance. In humans, the onset of \ntype\n 2 diabetes due to insufficient increases (or actual declines) in beta cell mass is apparently due to increased beta cell apoptosis relative to non-diabetic insulin resistant individuals. (Butler et al., \nDiabetes \n52:102-110, 2003.)\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present application features the use of the somatostatin subtype 3 receptor (SST3) as a target for affecting insulin secretion and for diagnosing diabetes related disorders. Glucose stimulated insulin secretion was found to be stimulated by knocking down expression of SST3 and through the use of a SST3 selective antagonist.\n\n\nThus, a first aspect of the present invention features a method for stimulating insulin secretion in a patient in need thereof. The method comprises the step of administering to the patient an effective amount of a SST3 antagonist or an agent that reduces expression of SST3.\n\n\nAn SST3 antagonist binds to SST3 and inhibits receptor activity. In the treatment of a patient, the overall degree of inhibition of SST3 receptor activity should be sufficient to provide a useful physiological effect such as increasing insulin secretion leading to a reduction in blood glucose level.\n\n\nAn agent reducing SST3 expression acts at the nucleic acid level to inhibit transcription, translation, or processing of SST3 encoding nucleic acids. Examples of such agents include short inhibitory RNA (siRNA), ribozymes, and antisense nucleic acid. In the treatment of a patient, the overall degree of inhibition should be sufficient to provide a useful physiological effect such as increasing insulin secretion leading to a reduction in blood glucose level.\n\n\nAnother aspect of the present invention features a method of screening for a compound affecting at least one of: insulin secretion or glucose uptake. The method involves: (a) identifying a compound binding to, or inhibiting the activity or expression of SST3; and (b) determining the ability of the compound identified in step (a) to affect at least one of one: insulin secretion or glucose uptake.\n\n\nThe initial identification of a compound binding to, or inhibiting the activity or expression of a SST3, can be performed experimentally or based on known information. Information on the SST3 is available in the scientific literature. Preferably, the compound is initially identified experimentally as inhibiting SST3 activity or expression.\n\n\nAnother aspect of the present invention features a method of determining progression of diabetes. The method involves: (a) using a selective SST3 ligand to measure β-cell mass and (b) determining whether there is a low or a decrease in β-cell mass. A low amount of β-cell mass can be determined with respect to the β-cell mass occurring in the general population. A decrease in β-cell mass can be determined with respect to a particular patient over the course of time.\n\n\nReference to open-ended terms such as “comprises” allows for additional elements or steps. Occasionally phrases such as “one or more” are used with or without open-ended terms to highlight the possibility of additional elements or steps.\n\n\nUnless explicitly stated, reference to terms such as “a” or “an” is not limited to one. For example, “a cell” does not exclude “cells”. Occasionally phrases such as one or more are used to highlight the possible presence of a plurality.\n\n\nOther features and advantages of the present invention are apparent from the additional descriptions provided herein including the different examples. The provided examples illustrate different components and methodology useful in practicing the present invention. The examples do not limit the claimed invention. Based on the present disclosure the skilled artisan can identify and employ other components and methodology useful for practicing the present invention.\n\n\n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n\n \nFIG. 1\n illustrates the effect of \nCompound\n 2 on mouse islets insulin secretion. “\nG\n 16” refers to 16 mM glucose. “GSIS” refers to glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.\n\n\n \nFIG. 2\n illustrates the effect of \nCompound\n 2 on blood glucose levels during the intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) in C57BL/6 mice.\n\n\n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe SST3 is identified herein as a target for affecting insulin secretion and assessing beta-cell mass. Glucose stimulated insulin secretion was found to be stimulated by knocking down expression of SST3 and through the use of an SST3 selective antagonist. An important physiological action of insulin is to decrease blood glucose levels. Based on the present application, targeting the SST3 has different uses including therapeutic applications, diagnostic applications, and evaluation of potential therapeutics.\n\n\nI. Somatostin And Somatostin Receptors\n\n\nSomatostatin is a hormone that exerts a wide spectrum of biological effects mediated by a family of seven transmembrane (TM) domain G-protein-coupled receptors. (Lahlou et al., \nAnn. N.Y. Acad. Sci. \n1014:121-131, 2004, Reisine et al., \nEndocrine Review \n16:427-442, 1995.) The predominant active forms of somatostatin are somatostatin-14 and somatostatin-28. Somatostatin-14 is a cyclic tetradecapeptide. Somatostatin-28 is an extended form of somatostatin-14.\n\n\nSST3 is the third, of five, related G-protein receptor subtypes responding to somatostatin. The other receptors are the \nsomatostatin subtype\n 1 receptor (SST1), \nsomatostatin subtype\n 2 receptor (SST2), somatostatin subtype 4 receptor (SST4) and somatostatin subtype 5 receptor (SST5). The five distinct subtypes are encoded by separate genes segregated on different chromosomes. (Patel et al., \nNeuroendocrinol. \n20:157-198, 1999.) All five receptor subtypes bind somatostatin-14 and somatostatin-28, with low nanomolar affinity. The ligand binding domain for somatostatin is made up of residues in TMs III-VII with a potential contribution by the second extracellular loop. Somatostatin receptors are widely expressed in many tissues, frequently as multiple subtypes that coexist in the same cell.\n\n\nThe five different somatostatin receptors all functionally couple to inhibition of adenylate cyclase by a pertussin-toxin sensitive protein (G\nαi1-3\n). (Lahlou et al., \nAnn. N.Y. Acad. Sci. \n1014:121-131, 2004.) Somatostatin-induced inhibition of peptide secretion results mainly from a decrease in intracellular Ca\n2+\n.\n\n\nAmong the wide spectrum of somatostatin effects, several biological responses have been identified with different receptor subtypes selectivity. These include growth hormone (GH) secretion mediated by SST2 and SST5, insulin secretion mediated by \nSST\n 1 and SST5, glucagon secretion mediated by SST2, and immune responses mediated by SST2. (Patel et al., \nNeuroendocrinol. \n20:157-198, 1999; Crider et al., \nExpert Opin. Ther. Patents \n13:1427-1441, 2003.)\n\n\nDifferent somatostatin receptor sequences from different organisms are well known in the art. (See for example, Reisine et al., \nEndocrine Review \n16:427-442, 1995.) Human, rat, and murine SST3 sequences and encoding nucleic acid sequences are provided in SEQ ID NO: 3 (human sst3 cDNA gi|44890055|ref|NM\n—\n001051.2| CDS 526:. 1782); SEQ ID NO: 4 (human sst3 AA gi|4557861|ref|NP\n—\n01042.1|); SEQ ID NO: 5 (mouse sst3 cDNA gi|66780401|ref|NM\n—\n009218.1| \nCDS\n 1 . . . 1287); SEQ ID NO: 6 (mouse sst3 AA gi|6678041|ref|NP\n—\n03244.1|); SEQ ID NO: 7 (rat sst3 cDNA gi|19424167|ref|NM\n—\n133522.1| CDS 656 . . . 1942); SEQ ID NO: 8 (rat sst3 A gi|19424168|ref|NP\n—\n598206.1|).\n\n\nII. Measuring SST3 Antagonist Activity\n\n\nSST3 antagonists can be identified using SST3 and nucleic acid encoding for SST3. Suitable assays include detecting compounds competing with a SST3 agonist for binding to SST3 and determining the functional effect of compounds on a SST3 cellular or physiologically relevant activity.\n\n\nSST3 cellular activities include cAMP inhibition, phospholipase C increase, tyrosine phsophatases increase, eNOS decrease, K\n+\n channel increase, Na\n+\n/H\n+\n exchange decrease, and ERK decrease. (Lablou et al., \nAnn. N.Y. Acad. Sci. \n1014:121-131, 2004.) Functional activity can be determined using cell lines expressing SST3 and determining the effect of a compound on one or more SST3 activity. (Poitout et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n44:29900-3000, 2001; Hocart et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n41:1146-1154, 1998.)\n\n\nSST3 binding assays can be performed, for example, by labeling somatostatin and determining the ability of a compound to inhibit somatostatin binding. (Poitout et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n44:29900-3000, 2001; Hocart et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n41:1146-1154, 1998.) Additional formats for measuring binding of a compound to a receptor are well-known in the art.\n\n\nA physiologically relevant activity for SST3 inhibition, identified herein, is stimulating insulin secretion. Stimulation of insulin secretion can be evaluated in vitro or in vivo.\n\n\nIII. SST3 Antagonists\n\n\nSST3 antagonists can be identified experimentally or based on available information. A variety of different SST3 antagonists are well known in the art. Examples of such antagonists include peptide antagonists, β-carboline derivatives, and a decahydroisoquinoline derivative. (Poitout et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n44:29900-3000, 2001, Hocart et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n41:1146-1154, 1998, Reubi et al., \nPNAS \n97:13973-13978, 2000, Bänziger et al., \nTetrahedron: Assymetry \n14:3469-3477, 2003, Crider et al., \nExpert Opin. Ther. Patents \n13:1427-1441, 2003, Troxler et al., International Publication No. WO 02/081471, International Publication Date Oct. 17, 2002) The different known SST3 antagonists can be used as starting points for obtaining additional antagonists.\n\n\nAntagonists can be characterized based on their ability to bind to SST3 (Ki) and effect SST3 activity (IC\n50\n), and to selectively bind to SST3 and selectively affect SST3 activity. Preferred antagonists strongly and selectively bind to SST3 and inhibit SST3 activity.\n\n\nIn different embodiments concerning SST3 binding, the antagonist has a Ki (nM) less than 100, preferably less than 50, more preferably less than 25 or more preferably less than 10. Ki can be measured as described by Poitout et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n44:29900-3000, 2001 and Example 7 infra.\n\n\nA selective SST3 antagonist binds SST3 at least 10 times more than is binds SST1, SST2, SST4, and SST5. In different embodiments concerning selective SST3 binding, the antagonist binds to each of SST1, SST2, SST4, and SST5 with a Ki greater than 1000, or preferably greater than 2000 nM and/or binds SST3 at least 40 times, more preferably at least 50 times, more preferably at least 100 times, or more preferably at least 500 times, greater than it binds to SST1, SST2, SST4, and SST5.\n\n\nIn different embodiment concerning SST3 activity, the antagonist has an IC\n50 \n(nM) less than 500, preferably less than 100, more preferably less than 50, or more preferably less than 10 nM. IC\n50 \ncan be determined by measuring inhibition of somatostatin-14 induced reduction of cAMP accumulation due to forskolin (1 μM) in CHO-K1 cells expressing SST3, as described by Poitout et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n44:29900-3000, 2001.\n\n\nPreferred antagonists have a preferred or more preferred Ki, a preferred or more preferred IC\n50\n, and a preferred or more preferred selectivity. More preferred antagonists have a Ki (nM) less than 25; are at least 100 times selective for SST3 compared to SST1, SST2, SST4 and SST5; and have a IC\n50 \n(nM) less than 10.\n\n\nIn an embodiment, the antagonist is a β-carboline derivative having the structure of Formula I (Troxler et al., International Publication No. WO 02/081471, International Publication Date Oct. 17, 2002):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein R\n1 \nis selected from the group consisting of:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein R\n2 \nand R\n3 \nis each independently selected from the group consisting of: (C\n1-4\n)alkoxy(C\n1-4\n)alkyl, (C\n3-7\n)cycloakyl(C\n1-4\n)alkyl and, if R\n1 \nis not an optionally substituted phenyl, (C\n1-12\n)alkyl;\n\n\nR\n4 \nis selected from the group consisting of: hydrogen, (C\n1-4\n)alkyl, (C\n1-4\n)alkoxy, halogen, and trifluoromethyl;\n\n\nR\n5 \nis selected from the group consisting of: hydrogen and (C\n1-4\n)alkyl;\n\n\nR\n6 \nis (C\n1-4\n)alkyl,\n\n\nR\n7 \nand R\n8 \nis each independently selected from the group consisting of: hydrogen and (C\n1-4\n)alkyl; and\n\n\nX is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, (C\n1-4\n)alkoxy, (C\n1-4\n)alkylamino, and di(C\n1-4\n)alkylamino,\n\n\nor a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof.\n\n\nExamples of different Formula I compounds are provided in Troxler et al., International Publication No. WO 02/081471, International Publication Date Oct. 17, 2002. One such example is (R)-1,1-bis-ethoxymethyl-3-(4-phenyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-2,3,4,9-tetrahydro-1H-β-carboline.\n\n\nIncluded within Formula I are the different optical isomers that may be present at one or more chiral carbon, racemic mixtures, and tautomeric forms. Each chiral carbon can be independently either R, S, or racemic.\n\n\nA halogen is selected from the group consisting of fluorine, chlorine, bromine and chlorine. Preferably, the halogen is either fluorine or chlorine.\n\n\nA pharmaceutically acceptable salt is a salt suitable for administration to a patient. The salt should be non-toxic in the amount employed.\n\n\nA solvate refers to association with a solvent such as water. Solvate examples include hydrates, hemihydrates, and trihydrates. Reference to solvate include a solvate of a salt.\n\n\nAnother set of examples are imidazolyl tetrahydro-β-carboline derivatives based on the compounds provided in Poitout et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n44:29900-3000, 2001.

Agents Targeting SST3 Expression\n\n\n\nSST3 encoding nucleic acid provides a target for compounds able to hybridize to the nucleic acid. Examples of compounds able to hybridize to a nucleic acid sequence include siRNA, ribozymes, and antisense nucleic acid. The mechanism of inhibition varies depending upon the type of compound. Techniques for producing and using siRNA, ribozymes, and antisense nucleic acid are well known in the art. (E.g., Probst, \nMethods \n22:271-281, 2000; Zhang et al., \nMethods in Molecular Medicine Vol. \n106\n. \nAntisense Therapeutics\n \n2\nnd \n \nEdition, p. \n11-34, Edited by I. Philips, Humana Press Inc., Totowa, N.J., 2005.)\n\n\nVectors for delivering nucleic acid based compounds include plasmid and viral based vectors. Preferred vectors for therapeutic applications are retroviral and adenovirus based vectors. (Devroe et al., \nExpert Opin. Biol. Ther. \n4(3):319-327, 2004, Zhang et al., \nVirology \n320:135-143, 2004.)\n\n\nV. Protein Production\n\n\nSST3 can be produced using techniques well, known in the art including those involving chemical synthesis and those involving recombinant production. (See e.g., Vincent, \nPeptide and Protein Drug Delivery\n, New York, N.Y., Decker, 1990\n; Current Protocols in Molecular Biology\n, John Wiley, 1987-2002, and Sambrook et al., \nMolecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, \n2\nnd \nEdition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989.)\n\n\nRecombinant nucleic acid techniques for producing a protein involve introducing, or producing, a recombinant gene encoding the protein in a cell and expressing the protein. A purified protein can be obtained from cell. Alternatively, the activity of the protein in a cell or cell extract can be evaluated.\n\n\nA recombinant gene contains nucleic acid encoding a protein along with regulatory elements for protein expression. The recombinant gene can be present in a cellular genome or can be part of an expression vector.\n\n\nThe regulatory elements that may be present as part of a recombinant gene include those naturally associated with the protein encoding sequence and exogenous regulatory elements not naturally associated with the protein encoding sequence. Exogenous regulatory elements such as an exogenous promoter can be useful for expressing a recombinant gene in a particular host or increasing the level of expression. Generally, the regulatory elements that are present in a recombinant gene include a transcriptional promoter, a ribosome binding site, a terminator, and an optionally present operator. A preferred element for processing in eukaryotic cells is a polyadenylation signal.\n\n\nExpression of a recombinant gene in a cell is facilitated through the use of an expression vector. Preferably, an expression vector in addition to a recombinant gene also contains an origin of replication for autonomous replication in a host cell, a selectable marker, a limited number of useful restriction enzyme sites, and a potential for high copy number. Examples of expression vectors are cloning vectors, modified cloning vectors, specifically designed plasmids and viruses.\n\n\nDue to the degeneracy of the genetic code, a large number of different encoding nucleic acid sequences can be used to code for a particular protein. The degeneracy of the genetic code arises because almost all amino acids are encoded by different combinations of nucleotide triplets or “codons”. Amino acids are encoded by codons as follows:\n\n \n \nA=Ala=Alanine: codons GCA, GCC, GCG, GCU\n \nC=Cys=Cysteine: codons UGC, UGU\n \nD=Asp=Aspartic acid: codons GAC, GAU\n \nE=Glu=Glutamic acid: codons GAA, GAG\n \nF=Phe=Phenylalanine: codons UUC, UUU\n \nG=Gly=Glycine: codons GGA, GGC, GGG, GGU\n \nH=His=Histidine: codons CAC, CAU\n \nI=Ile=lsoleucine: codons AUA, AUC, AUU\n \nK=Lys=Lysinc: codons AAA, AAG\n \nL=Leu=Leucine: codons UUA, UUG, CUA, CUC, CUG, CUU\n \nM=Met=Methionine: codon AUG\n \nN=Asn=Asparagine: codons AAC, AAU\n \nP=Pro=Proline: codons CCA, CCC, CCG, CCU\n \nQ=Gln=Glutamine: codons CAA, CAG\n \nR=Arg=Arginine: codons AGA, AGG, CGA, CGC, CGG, CGU\n \nS=Ser=Serine: codons AGC, AGU, UCA, UCC, UCG, UCU\n \nT=Thr=Threonine: codons ACA, ACC, ACG, ACU\n \nV=Val=Valine: codons GUA, GUC, GUG, GUU\n \nW=Trp=Tryptophan: codon UGG\n \nY=Tyr=Tyrosine: codons UAC, UAU\n \n\n\nIf desired, expression in a particular host can be enhanced through codon optimization. Codon optimization includes use of more preferred codons. Techniques for codon optimization in different hosts are well known in the art.\n\n\nVI. Therapeutic Applications\n\n\nTherapeutic applications of targeting SST3 include treatment of disease or disorders associated with at least one of an insulin deficiency or a hyperglycemic state. Examples of such diseases include hyperglycemia, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. A preferred therapeutic application is treatment of \ntype\n 2 diabetes in a patient.\n\n\nReference to “patient” indicates a mammal capable of contracting a disease or disorder. Preferably, the patient is a human.\n\n\nVII. Combination Treatment\n\n\nSST3 antagonists can be used alone or in conjunction with other therapeutic compounds. Available agents that have been used to try to help treat \ntype\n 2 diabetes include sulfonylureas and related K-ATP channel blockers; glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists such as GLP-1 and exendin-4; metformin; PPARγ-selective agonists; DP-IV; and insulin. (Inzucchi \nJAMA \n287:360-372, 2002; Doyle et al., \nPharmacol Rev. \n55:105-131, 2003; Hoist et al., \nCurr. Med. Chem. \n6:1005-1017, 1999; Baggio et al., \nTreat. Endocrinol \n1:117-125, 2002; Nauck et al., \nRegul. Pept. \n128:135-148, 2005.)\n\n\nVIII. Compound Preparation And Administration\n\n\nCompounds can be formulated and administered to a patient using the guidance provided herein along with techniques well known in the art. The preferred route of administration ensures that an effective amount of compound reaches the target. Guidelines for pharmaceutical administration of a therapeutic compound in general are provided in, for example, \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences \n20\nth \n \nEdition\n, Ed. Gennaro, Mack Publishing, 2000; and \n \nModern Pharmaceutics\n \n2\nnd \n \nEdition\n, Eds. Banker and Rhodes, Marcel Dekicker, Inc., 1990.\n\n\nCompounds having appropriate functional groups can be prepared as acidic or base salts. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts (in the form of water- or oil-soluble or dispersible products) include conventional non-toxic salts or the quaternary ammonium salts that are formed, e.g., from inorganic or organic acids or bases. Examples of such salts include acid addition salts such as acetate, adipate, alginate, aspartate, benzoate, benzenesulfonate, bisulfate, butyrate, citrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, cyclopentanepropionate, digluconate, dodecylsulfate, ethanesulfonate, fumarate, glucoheptanoate, glycerophosphate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonate, lactate, maleate, methanesulfonate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, nicotinate, oxalate, pamoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenylpropionate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, succinate, tartrate, thiocyanate, tosylate, and undecanoate; and base salts such as ammonium salts, alkali metal salts such as sodium and potassium salts, alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium and magnesium salts, salts with organic bases such as dicyclohexylamine salts, N-methyl-D-glucamine, and salts with amino acids such as arginine and lysine.\n\n\nCompounds can be administered using different routes including oral, nasal, by injection, transdermal, and transmucosally. Active ingredients to be administered orally as a suspension can be prepared according to techniques well known in the art of pharmaceutical formulation and may contain microcrystalline cellulose for imparting bulk, alginic acid or sodium alginate as a suspending agent, methylcellulose as a viscosity enhancer, and sweeteners/flavoring agents. As immediate release tablets, these compositions may contain microcrystalline cellulose, dicalcium phosphate, starch, magnesium stearate and lactose and/or other excipients, binders, extenders, disintegrants, diluents and lubricants.\n\n\nWhen administered by nasal aerosol or inhalation, compositions can be prepared according to techniques well known in the art of pharmaceutical formulation. Such compositions may be prepared for example, as solutions in saline, employing benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives, absorption promoters to enhance bioavailability, fluorocarbons, and/or other solubilizing or dispersing agents.\n\n\nThe compounds may also be administered in intravenous (both bolus and infusion), intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, topical with or without occlusion, or intramuscular form. When administered by injection, the injectable solutions or suspensions may be formulated using suitable non-toxic, parenterally-acceptable diluents or solvents, such as Ringer's solution or isotonic sodium chloride solution, or suitable dispersing or wetting and suspending agents, such as sterile, bland, fixed oils, including synthetic mono- or diglycerides, and fatty acids, including oleic acid.\n\n\nWhen rectally administered in the form of suppositories, these compositions may be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient, such as cocoa butter, synthetic glyceride esters or polyethylene glycols, which are solid at ordinary temperatures, but liquidify and/or dissolve in the rectal cavity to release the drug.\n\n\nSuitable dosing regimens for the therapeutic applications can be selected taking into account factors well known in the art including age, weight, sex and medical condition of the patient; the severity of the condition to be treated; the route of administration; the renal and hepatic function of the patient; and the particular compound employed.\n\n\nOptimal precision in achieving concentrations of drug within the range that yields efficacy without toxicity requires a regimen based on the kinetics of the drug's availability to target sites. This involves a consideration of the distribution, equilibrium, and elimination of a drug. The daily dose for a patient is expected to be between 0.01 and 1,000 mg per adult patient per day.\n\n\nIX. Diagnostic Applications\n\n\nA diagnostic application involves determining the progression of diabetes using a SST3 ligand. Radiolabeled SST3 ligands can be used for non-invasive measurement of pancreatic islet, or more specifically, beta-cell mass in patients with \ntype\n 2 diabetes by either Positron-Emission Tomography (PET) or High-Resolution Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The same measurement can also be used in \ntype\n 1 diabetic patients who have received islet transplantation. Preferably, the ligand is a selective SST3 antagonist.\n\n\nAn SST3 ligand binds selectivity to SST3, but need not affect SST3 activity. In different embodiments concerning SST3 binding, the ligand has a Ki (nM) less than 100, preferably less than 50, more preferably less than 25 or more preferably less than 10; and the ligand binds SST3 at least 10 times more than it binds SST1, SST2, SST4, and SST5. In different embodiments concerning selective SST3 binding, the ligand binds to each of SST1, SST2, SST4, and SST5 with a Ki greater than 1000, or preferably greater than 2000 nM and/or binds SST3 at least 40 times, more preferably at least 50, more preferably at least 100 times, and more preferably at least 500 times, greater than it binds to SST1, SST2, SST4, and SST5. In an additional embodiment, the ligand is an SST3 antagonist as described above in Section III supra.\n\n\nX. EXAMPLES\n\n\nExamples are provided below to further illustrate different features of the present invention. The examples also illustrate useful methodology for practicing the invention. These examples do not limit the claimed invention.\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nUp-Reputation of SST3 by High Glucose in INS-1 (832/13) Cells\n\n\nRegulation of the gene encoding SST3 was evaluated by measuring gene expression in INS-1 (832/13) cells. INS-1 (832/13) is a glucose responsive insulinoma β-cell line. (Hohmeier et al., \nDiabetes \n49:424-430, 2000.)\n\n\nINS-1 (832/13) were cultured in RPMI medium with low (2 mM) and high (16 mM) glucose for 24 hours before being collected for RNA extraction. Insulin secretion from the 832/13 INS-1 cell was very low at 2 mM glucose, but is several-fold higher at 16 mM glucose. Each treatment was performed in triplicate (i.e., three experiments on three separate days).\n\n\nThe collected RNA samples were hybridized to oligonucleotide microarrays to identify glucose signature genes. Agilent 60-mer oligo microarray technology, which is a two-channel platform, was used. With this technology, two RNA samples are separately labeled with different fluorescent dyes (Cy5 and Cy3) and are then competitively hybridized on a single array. Dye-swap replicates (fluor-reverse pairs) are produced and averaged to cancel any dye labeling bias resulting in the ratio data values.\n\n\nIn this example, the three 2 mM glucose RNA replicate samples were pooled and used as a common reference pool for all the hybridization. The relative expression of genes in the 16 mM, glucose samples to the 2 mM glucose samples were obtained by comparing the intensities of each of the 16 mM glucose samples to that of the common reference pool. The individual ratio values were then combined using the “replicate combined” feature in the Rosetta Resolver system to generate error-weighted mean ratios with associated p values (a hybrid error model or AHEM).\n\n\nAn Agilent Rat 25k v1.2 Chip A array was used. Of about 23 thousands rat genes represented on this chip, the SST3 gene was represented by one probe (SEQ ID NO: 1). Numerous genes were found to be up-regulated by high glucose (totally 1559 for FC>1.2). The SST3 gene was up-regulated by high glucose with a fold change=1.22, and p-value=0.00157.\n\n\nExample 2\n\n\nSST3 Gene Expression is Highly Enriched in Mouse and Rat Islets\n\n\nThe relative expression level of SST3 gene expression in pancreatic islets versus various other tissues was assessed by DNA microarray using a Body-Atlas. The Body-Atlas is a molecular anatomic atlas detailing the expression level of different genes in each tissue or cell-type.\n\n\nTotal RNA samples were extracted from a comprehensive collection of tissues (including the pancreatic islets) for normal C57BL/6 mice and Sprague-Dawley rats and hybridized to microarrays (Mouse TOE 75k v1.0 and Rat 50k v2.1) to generate the mouse and rat islet body atlas data, respectively. In each version of the body-atlas, a reference pool of RNA sample was composed by pooling an equal amount of RNA from 10 different tissues. Samples from each tissue (such as islets) were hybridized against the reference pool to obtain the relative expression of each gene.\n\n\nOn the mouse microarray used to construct the mouse body atlas, the probe (SEQ ID NO: 2), representing sst3, showed high islet enrichment (Table 2). There were 422 genes showing high islet enrichment. The data fields included are the ratios of islets' intensity to the intensity of the species-specific reference pool as well as the absolute hybridization intensities. The Tau values are probe- and array-specific background intensities and represent the intensity at which detection of a transcript achieves 90% confidence.\n\n\nOn the rat body atlas (Rat 50k v2.1) the probe (SEQ ID NO: 1) representing the SST3 gene was also identified as highly enriched in rat islets and the insulinoma INS-1 (832/13) cells (Table 3). About 600 other genes also showed high islet and INS-1 enrichment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSST3 Gene Expression Profile in a Mouse Body

levels of all five somatostatin receptor subtype in human islets from two different donors and 7 non-islet tissues were determined by the Taqman real-time PCR method. Fluorogenic Taqman probes specific for human sst1, sst2, sst3, sst4 and sst5 were purchased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, Calif., the catalog numbers are Hs0265617_s1, Hs00265624_s1, Hs00265633_s1, Hs00265639_s1 and Hs00265647_s1 respectively). Absolute mRNA levels for the genes of interest were determined by real-time reverse transcription reaction using the ABI PRISM 7900 Sequence Detection System from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, Calif.) through 40 cycles. β-Actin probe was used as reference to determine the relative abundance of the each gene in different tissues.\n\n\nThe Taqman results showed that sst3, along with sst5, are the two most abundant SST expressed genes in two separate human islet samples, and sst4 is not expressed in human islets. SST3 gene expression was also observed brain (Table 4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelative expression level of SSTs in human tissues\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSST1\n\n\nSST2\n\n\nSST3\n\n\nSST5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHs. \nIslet\n 2\n\n\n11.7\n\n\n29.6\n\n\n219.0\n\n\n124.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHs.

To study the function of candidate target genes in pancreatic beta-cell, we developed a robust method of siRNA mediated gene knockdown that can be used to screen for genes whose expression is required for normal glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) function in the rat insulinoma cell line INS-1 (832/13).\n\n\nThree 21-mer siRNA oligos were designed against each candidate gene and used as a pool at the final concentration of 20 uM. The siRNA oligos were delivered to the cells by Nucleofector Device (Amaxa, Gaithersburg, Md.). The INS-1 (832/13) cells were trypsinized, centrifuged, and resuspended in 100 ul Nucleofector solution V (2.25×10\n6 \ncells per reaction). Seven and a half microliters of pooled siRNA were then added to the cell suspension. The cells were electroporated with Amaxa Nucleofector Device program T21. After electroporation, the cells were transferred and split into 9 wells in 96-well plate with 200 ul of regular culture medium (RPMI 1640 with 10% FCS and 11 mM glucose).\n\n\nGSIS assays were performed after 48 hours. Prior to the assay, cells were washed once with glucose-free Krebs-Ringer Bicarbonate (KRB) medium and cells were incubated with the KRB medium for another 2 hours. The medium were replaced with fresh KRB supplemented with 2, 8, and 16 mM glucose and the cells were incubated for another 2 hours. Supernatants were taken out at the end of incubation for insulin measurement by Ultrasensitive Rat Insulin ELISA kit (ALPCO, Salem, N.H.).\n\n\nThe degree of gene knockdown by the siRNA oligos was quantified by Taqman real-time PCR also at 48 hours after electroporation. The method consistently obtained >70% knockdown of the target genes mRNA. We used PDE3b (phosphodiesterase 3B) and GCK (glucokinase) as two positive controls. As shown in Example 5, Table 6 (infra), compared to control-shocked INS-1 cells (using random sequence siRNA oligos), knocking down PDE3b increased GSIS by 1.5 to 3 fold, consistent with its role in hydrolyzing cAMP, a key positive mediator of GSIS. On the other hand, knocking down the key glycolytic enzyme, glucokinase, generally suppressed GSIS by 30 to 60%.\n\n\nThis method can also be used in other insulin secreting cells lines such as the murine insulinoma cell line MIN6 cells.\n\n\nExample 5\n\n\nSiRNA-Mediated Suppression of SST3 Gene Expression Enhances GSIS in INS-1 Cells\n\n\nTo study the role of SST3 in GSIS, we designed three pairs of siRNA oligos against rat sst3 (see Table 5 for sequences) and introduced the oligos into the INS-1 832/13 cells by electroporation as described in Example 4 supra.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nsiRNA Oligo Sequences Targeting Rat sst3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsiRNA\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nstart\n\n\nSense Sequence\n\n\nAntisense Sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n986\n\n\nrCrCUUUrCrGrGrCUrCUrCUrCrAUrGUTT\n\n\nRArCrAUrGrArGrArGrArGrCrCrGrArArArGrGTT\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 9)\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 12)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n829\n\n\nRGrGrGUUUrGrCUrGrGrGrCrArAUUrCrATT\n\n\nUrGrArAUUrGrCrCrCrArGrCrArArArCrCrCTT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 10)\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 13)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n924\n\n\nRCUrGrArCrGrArArCUrCUUrCrAUrGrCUTT\n\n\nRArGrCrAUrGrArArGrArGUUrCrGUrCrArGTT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 11)\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 14)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGSIS assays were performed 48 hours after electroporation. The ratios of insulin concentration measured between 8 mM and 2 mM (G8/G2) and 16 mM and 2 mM (G16/G2) glucose treatments are functional readouts for GSIS. These two ratios for each gene were compared to the sample treated with random sequence siRNA oligos. GCK and PDE3b served as functional controls. A ratio of 0.5 represents fifty percent reduction of GSIS, and a ratio of 2 represents one hundred percent increase of GSIS. Sst3 siRNA treated samples showed 2.7 to 4.4 fold enhancements of GSIS.

The rat sst3 specific probes were designed using Primer Express Software (Applied Biosystem) based on SEQ ID NO: 7 (Forward Primer: CTGAGCCATCTGTAAGAACCTTCA (SEQ ID NO: 15); Reverse Primer: CGTGCCTTAGGTCAAGCATAGC (SEQ ID NO: 16); Probe: TCTGCTCTCTTCAGGATCATGCTGGCT (SEQ ID NO: 17)). We observed about 55-75% reduction of sst3 mRNA in siRNA-treated cells.\n\n\nExample 6\n\n\nSST3 Specific Antagonist Enhances GSIS in Isolated Mouse Islets\n\n\nPancreatic islets of Langerhans were isolated from the pancreas of normal C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratory, Maine) by collagenase digestion and discontinuous Ficoll gradient separation, a modification of the original method of Lacy and Kostianovsky (Lacy et al., Diabetes 16:35-39, 1967). The islets were cultured overnight in RPMI 1640 medium (11 mM glucose) before GSIS assay.\n\n\nTo measure GSIS, islets were first preincubated for 30 minutes in the Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate (KRB) buffer with 2 mM glucose (in petri dishes). The KRB medium contains 143.5 mM Na\n+\n, 5.8 mM K\n+\n, 2.5 mM Ca\n2+\n, 1.2 mM Mg\n2+\n, 124.1 mM Cl\n−\n, 1.2 mM PO\n4\n \n3−\n, 1.2 mM SO\n4\n \n2+\n, 25 mM CO\n3\n \n2−\n, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (pH 7.4). The islets were then transferred to a 96-well plate (one islet/well) and incubated at 37° C. for 60 minutes in 200 μl of KRB buffer with 2 or 16 mM glucose, and other agents to be tested such as octreotide and a SST3 antagonist. (Zhou et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n278:51316-51323, 2003.) Insulin was measured in aliquots of the incubation buffer by ELISA with a commercial kit (ALPCO Diagnostics, Windham, N.H.).\n\n\nThe SST3 specific antagonist (R)-1,1-bis-ethoxymethyl-3-(4-phenyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-2,3,4,9-tetrahydro-1H-β-carboline (racemic structure shown below) was used to evaluate the role of SST3 in glucose stimulated insulin secretion from the β-cell.

The enhancement of GSIS was observed at low concentration (0.1 and 1 uM) of the SST3 antagonist. As expected, GSIS was significantly suppressed by 10 nM of Octreotide in isolated islets. The effect of octreotide was fully blocked by 0.1 to 1 uM of \nCompound\n 2.\n\n\nExample 7\n\n\nSpecific Binding of \nCompound\n 2 to SST3\n\n\nThe receptor-ligand binding assays of all 5 subtype of SSTRs were performed with membranes isolated from Chinese hamster ovary—(CHO) K1 cells stably expressing the cloned human somatostatin receptors in 96-well format as previous reported.

Neomycin-resistant clones were selected and maintained in medium containing 400 μg/ml G418 (Rohrer et al. \nScience \n282:737-740, 1998). Binding assays were performed using (3-\n125\nI-Tyr11)-SRIF-14 as the radioligand (used at 0.1 nM) and The Packard Unifilter assay plate. The assay buffer consisted of 50 mM Tris HCl (pH 7.8) with 1 mM EGTA, 5 mM MgCl\n2\n, leupeptin (10 μg/ml), pepstatin (10 μg/ml), bacitracin (200 μg/ml), and aprotinin (0.5 μg/ml). CHO-K1 cell membranes, radiolabeled somatostatin, and unlabeled test compounds were resuspended or diluted in this assay buffer. Unlabeled test compounds were examined over a range of concentrations from 0.01 nM to 10,000 nM. The Ki values for compounds were determined as described by Cheng and Prusoff \nBiochem Pharmacol. \n22:3099-3108, 1973.\n\n\nAs show in Table 7, \nCompound\n 2 exhibits very high and specific binding to SST3 (IC\n50\n=7.8 nM).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBinding Potencies of \nCompound\n 2 on\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSomatostatin Receptor Subtypes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nReceptor\n\n\nIC\n50 \n(nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSST1\n\n\n>1300\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSST2\n\n\n150,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSST3\n\n\n7.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSST4\n\n\n>490\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSST5\n\n\n>1500\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 8\n\n\nSST3 Antagonist Reduces Blood Glucose Levels During Glucose Tolerance Tests in Mice\n\n\nGlucose tolerance tests were performed using an SST3 antagonist in normal C57B1/6 mice.

No. 60/616,605, filed Oct. 7, 2004.\n\n\nFIELD OF INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to the discovery of particular heterocyclic compounds, and further to particular salts of these heterocycles, possessing increased activity as mGluR5 antagonists. In addition, the present invention relates to therapeutic methods of use of these compounds for the treatment and prevention of various diseases and conditions.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nUnsaturated heterocylic compounds find a wide variety of uses. For example, compounds of this class find uses as modulators of physiological processes that are mediated by ligand-activated receptors. Receptors that are activated by ligands are located throughout the nervous, cardiac, renal, digestive and bronchial systems, among others. In the nervous system, for example, heterocyclic compounds are capable of functioning as agonists or antagonists of receptors for neurotransmitters, neurohormones and neuromodulators. Ligand-activated receptors have been identified in a wide variety of species, including humans, other mammals and vertebrates as well as in invertebrate species. Therefore, compounds of this class are also able to modulate receptor-mediated processes throughout phylogeny and find uses in a wide variety of applications, e.g., as pharmaceuticals, insecticides, fungicides and other uses.\n\n\nReceptors activated by excitatory amino acids, such as the amino acid L-glutamic acid (glutamate), are a major excitatory neurotransmitter receptor class in the mammalian central nervous system. Anatomical, biochemical and electrophysiological analyses suggest that glutamatergic systems are involved in a broad array of neuronal processes, including fast excitatory synaptic transmission, regulation of neurotransmitter release, long-term potentiation, long-term depression, learning and memory, developmental synaptic plasticity, hypoxic-ischemic damage and neuronal cell death, epileptiform seizures, visual processing, as well as the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders. See generally, Nakanishi et al., Brain Research Reviews 26:230-235 (1998); Monaghan et al., Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 29:365-402 (1980). This extensive repertoire of functions, especially those related to learning, neurotoxicity, and neuropathology, has stimulated recent attempts to describe and define the mechanisms through which glutamate exerts its effects.\n\n\nGlutamate has been observed to mediate its effects through receptors that have been categorized into two main groups: ionotropic and metabotropic. Ionotropic glutamate receptors are generally divided into two classes: the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and non-NMDA receptors. Both classes of receptors are linked to integral cation channels and share some amino acid sequence homology. GluR1-4 are termed AMPA (a-amino-3-hydroxy-5 methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid) receptors because AMPA preferentially activates receptors composed of these subunits, while GluRS-7 and KA1-2 are termed kainate receptors as these are preferentially sensitive to kainic acid. Thus, an “AMPA receptor” is a non-NMDA receptor that can be activated by AMPA. AMPA receptors include the GluR1-4 family, which form homo-oligomeric and hetero-oligomeric complexes which display different current-voltage relations and calcium permeability. Polypeptides encoded by GluR1-4 nucleic acid sequences can form functional ligand gated ion channels. An AMPA receptor includes a receptor having a GluR1, GluR2, GluR3 and/or GluR4 subunit. A NMDA receptor includes a receptor having NMDARI, NMDAR2a, NMDAR2b, NMDAR2c, NMDAR2d and/or NMDAR3 subunits.\n\n\nMetabotropic glutamate receptors are divided into three groups based on amino acid sequence homology, transduction mechanism and pharmacological properties, namely Group I, Group II and Group III. Each Group of receptors contains one or more types of receptors. For example, Group I includes metabotropic glutamate receptors 1 and 5 (mGluR1 and mGluR5), Group II includes metabotropic glutamate receptors 2 and 3 (mGluR2 and mGluR3) and Group m includes metabotropic glutamate receptors 4, 6, 7 and 8 (mGluR4, mGluR6, mGluR7 and mGluR8). Several subtypes of a particular mGluR type may exist. For example, subtypes of mGluR1 include mGluR1a, mGluR1b, mGluR1c and mGluR1d.\n\n\nAnatomical studies demonstrate a broad and selective distribution of metabotropic glutamate receptors in the mammalian nervous system. For example, mGluR1 is expressed in the cerebellum, olfactory bulb, hippocampus, lateral septum, thalamus, globus pallidus, entopeduncular nucleus, ventral pallidum and substantia nigra (Petralia et al., (1997) J. Chem. Neuroanat., 13:77-93; Shigemoto et al., (1992) J. Comp. Neurol., 322:121-135). In contrast, mGluR5 is weakly expressed in the cerebellum, while higher levels of expression are found in the striatum and cortex (Romano et al., (1995) J. Comp. Neurol., 355:455-469). In the hippocampus, mGluR5 appears widely distributed and is diffusely expressed.\n\n\nMetabotropic glutamate receptors are typically characterized by seven putative transmembrane domains, preceded by a large putative extracellular amino-terminal domain and followed by a large putative intracelluar carboxy-terminal domain. The receptors couple to G-proteins and activate certain second messengers depending on the receptor group. Thus, for example, Group I mGluR's activate phospholipase C. Activation of the receptors results in the hydrolysis of membrane phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate to diacylglycerol, which activates protein kinase C, and inositol trisphosphate, which in turn activates the inositol trisphosphate receptor to promote the release of 20 intracellular calcium.\n\n\nA wide variety of heterocyclic compounds having activity as mGluR5 antagonists have been described in our International Publication No. WO 01/16121 and related national phase applications such as Ser. No. 09/387,073 (abandoned) and Ser. No. 10/217,800, issued as U.S. Pat. No. 6,774,138, for modulating the activity of the mGluR5 receptor and for use in the treatment of mGluR5 mediated conditions. Because of the physiological and pathological significance of excitatory amino acid receptors generally, and metabotropic glutamate receptors in particular, there is a need to identify ever more effective methods of modulating excitatory amino acid receptor-mediated processes, as well as more effective therapeutic methods of treatment and methods for prevention of diseases. There is thus a continuing need in the art to identify new and increasingly potent members of a compound class that can modulate excitatory amino acid receptors.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe identification of a series of compounds which falls within the scope of the group of compounds described and claimed in WO 01/16121 and in U.S. Pat.

In addition, receptors of this class also mediate inhibitory responses. Excitatory amino acid receptors are membrane spanning proteins that mediate the stimulatory actions of the amino acid glutamate and possibly other endogenous acidic amino acids. Excitatory amino acids are crucial for fast and slow neurotransmission and they have been implicated in a variety of diseases including Alzheimer's disease, stroke, schizophrenia, head trauma, epilepsy, and the like. In addition, excitatory amino acids are integral to the processes of long-term potentiation and depression which are synaptic mechanisms underlying learning and memory. There are three main subtypes of excitatory amino acid receptors: (1) the metabotropic receptors; (2) the ionotropic NMDA receptors; and (3) the non-NMDA receptors, which include the AMPA receptors and kainate receptors.\n\n\nAs employed herein, the phrase “modulating the activity of refers to altered levels of activity so that the activity is different with the use of the invention method when compared to the activity without the use of the invention method. Modulating the activity of excitatory amino acid receptors includes the suppression or augmentation of the activity of receptors. Suppression of receptor activity may be accomplished by a variety of means, including blocking of a ligand binding site, biochemical and/or physico-chemical modification of a ligand binding site, binding of agonist recognition domains, preventing ligand-activated conformational changes in the receptor, preventing the activated receptor from stimulating second messengers such as G-proteins, and the like.

In addition, certain salt forms are more compatible with pharmaceutical uses. For example, the hydrochloric acid salt of 2-(phenylethynl)-1,3-thiazole is an oil while the toluene sulfonic acid salt form of 2-(phenylethynl)-1,3-thiazole is a solid that is soluble in aqueous medium. Characteristics of salt forms of compounds depend on the characteristics of the compound so treated, and on the particular salt employed.\n\n\nIn accordance with another embodiment of the invention, there are provided methods of modulating the activity of metabotropic glutamate receptors, said method comprising contacting metabotropic glutamate receptors with a concentration of a heterocylic compound as described above in accordance with invention methods for modulating the activity of excitatory amino acid receptors, sufficient to modulate the activity of said metabotropic glutamate receptors.\n\n\nAs used herein, the phrase “metabotropic glutamate receptor” refers to a class of cell-surface receptors which participates in the G-protein-coupled response of cells to glutamatergic ligands. Three groups of metabotropic glutamate receptors, identified on the basis of amino acid sequence homology, transduction mechanism and binding selectivity are presently known and each group contains one or more types of receptors. For example, Group I includes metabotropic glutamate receptors 1 and 5 (mIGluR1 and mGluRS), Group II includes metabotropic glutamate receptors 2 and 3 (mGluR2 and mGluR3) and Group III includes metabotropic glutamate receptors 4, 6, 7 and 8 (mGluR4, mGluR6, mGluR7 and mGluR8). Several subtypes of each mGluR type may be found; for example, subtypes of mGluR1 include mGluR1a, mGluR1b and mGluR1c.\n\n\nIn accordance with another embodiment of the invention, there are provided methods of treating a wide variety of disease conditions, said method comprising administering to a patient having a disease condition a therapeutically effective amount of at least one of the heterocyclic compounds described above in accordance with invention methods for modulating the activity of excitatorγ amino acid receptors.\n\n\nAs used herein, “treating” refers to inhibiting or arresting the development of a disease, disorder or condition and/or causing the reduction, remission, or regression of a disease, disorder or condition. Those of skill in the art will understand that various methodologies and assays may be used to assess the development of a disease, disorder or condition, and similarly, various methodologies and assays may be used to assess the reduction, remission or regression of a disease, disorder or condition.\n\n\nDisease conditions contemplated for treatment in accordance with the invention include cerebral ischemia, chronic neurodegeneration, psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia, mood disorders, emotion disorders, disorders of extrapyramidal motor function, obesity, disorders of respiration, motor control and function, attention deficit disorders, concentration disorders, pain disorders, neurodegenerative disorders, epilepsy, convulsive disorders, eating disorders, sleep disorders, sexual disorders, circadian disorders, drug withdrawal, drug addiction, compulsive disorders, anxiety, panic disorders, depressive disorders, skin disorders, retinal ischemia, retinal degeneration, glaucoma, disorders associated with organ transplantation, asthma, ischemia, astrocytomas, and the like.\n\n\nDisease conditions contemplated for treatment in accordance with the present invention further include diseases of the pulmonary system, diseases of the nervous system, diseases of the cardiovascular system, diseases of the gastrointestinal system, diseases of the endocrine system, diseases of the exocrine system, diseases of the skin, cancer, diseases of the ophthalmic system, and the like.\n\n\nAs used herein, “administering” refers to means for providing heterocyclic compounds and/or salts thereof, as described herein, to a patient; using oral, sublingual intravenous, subcutaneous, transcutaneotis, intramuscular, intracutaneous, intrathecal, epidural, intraoccular, intracranial, inhalation, rectal, vaginal, and the like administration. Administration in the form of creams, lotions, tablets, capsules, pellets, dispersible powders, granules, suppositories, syrups, elixirs, lozenges, injectable solutions, sterile aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, suspensions or emulsions, patches, and the like, is also contemplated. The active ingredients may be compounded with non-toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers including, glucose, lactose, gum acacia, gelatin, mannitol, starch paste, magnesium trisilicate, talc, corn starch, keratin, colloidal silica, potato starch, urea, dextrans, and the like.\n\n\nFor purposes of oral administration, tablets, capsules, troches, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, or syrups, elixirs and lozenges containing various excipients such as calcium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate, sodium phosphate, and the like may be employed along with various granulating and disintegrating agents such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid, and the like, together with binding agents such as gum tragacanth, corn starch, gelatin, acacia, and the like. Lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid, talc, and the like may also be added. Preparations intended for oral use may be prepared according to any methods known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical preparations and such preparations may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of a sweetening agent such as sucrose, lactose, saccharin, and the lake, flavoring agents such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, and the like, coloring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically palatable preparations.\n\n\nPreparations for oral use may also contain suitable carriers include emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups, and the like, optionally containing additives such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending 24 agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, and the like. Tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period of time.\n\n\nFor the preparation of fluids for parenteral administration, suitable carriers include sterile aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, suspensions, or emulsions. For parenteral administration, solutions for the practice of the invention may comprise sterile aqueous saline solutions, or the corresponding water soluble pharmaceutically acceptable metal salts, as previously described. For parenteral administration, solutions of the compounds used in the practice of the invention may also comprise non-aqueous solutions, suspensions, emulsions, and the like. Examples of non-aqueous solvents or vehicles are propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils, such as olive oil and corn oil, gelatin, and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Such dosage forms may also contain adjuvants such as preserving, wetting, emulsifying, and dispersing agents. They may be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacteria-retaining filter, by incorporating sterilizing agents into the compositions, by irradiating the compositions, or by heating the compositions. They can also be manufactured in the form of sterile water, or some other sterile injectable medium immediately before use.\n\n\nAqueous solutions may also be suitable for intravenous, intramuscular, intrathecal, subcutaneous, and intraperitoneal injection. The sterile aqueous media employed are all readily obtainable by standard techniques well known to those skilled in the art. They may be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacteria-retaining filter, by incorporating sterilizing agents into the compositions, by irradiating the compositions, by heating the compositions, and the like. They can also be manufactured in the form of sterile water, or some other sterile medium capable of injection immediately before use.\n\n\nCompounds contemplated for use in accordance with the present invention may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal or vaginal administration. These compositions may be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient, such as cocoa butter, synthetic glyceride esters of polyethylene glycols, and the like, such materials being solid at ambient temperatures but liquefy and/or dissolve in internal cavities to release the drug.\n\n\nThe preferred therapeutic compositions for inocula and dosage will vary with the clinical indication. Some variation in dosage will necessarily occur depending upon the condition of the patient being treated, and the physician will, in any event, determine the appropriate dose for the individual patient. The effective amount of compound per unit dose depends, among other things, on the body weight, physiology, and chosen inoculation regimen. A unit dose of compound refers to the weight of compound without the weight of carrier (when carrier is used).\n\n\nThe route of delivery of compounds and compositions used for the practice of the invention is determined by the disease and the site where treatment is required. Since the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of compounds and compositions described herein will vary somewhat, the most preferred method for achieving a therapeutic concentration in a tissue is to gradually escalate the dosage and monitor the clinical effects. The initial dose, for such an escalating dosage regimen of therapy, will depend upon the route of administration.\n\n\nIn accordance with invention methods, the medicinal preparation can be introduced parenterally, by dermal application, and the like, in any medicinal form or composition. It is used as a solitary agent of medication or in combination with other medicinal preparations. Single and multiple therapeutic dosage regimens may prove useful in therapeutic protocols.\n\n\nAs employed herein, the phrase “a therapeutically effective amount”, when used in reference to invention methods employing heterocyclic compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, refers to a dose of compound sufficient to provide circulating concentrations high enough to impart a beneficial effect on the recipient thereof. The specific therapeutically effective dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated, the severity of the disorder, the activity of the specific compound used, the route of administration, the rate of clearance of the specific compound, the duration of treatment, the drugs used in combination or coincident with the specific compound, —the age, body weight, sex, diet and general health of the patient, and like factors well known in the medical arts and sciences. Dosage levels typically fall in the range of about 0.001 up to 100 mg/kg/day; with levels in the range of about 0.05 up to 10 mg/kg/day being preferred.\n\n\nIn still another embodiment of the invention, there are provided methods for preventing disease conditions in a subject at risk thereof, said method comprising administering to said subject a therapeutically effective amount of at least one of the heterocyclic compounds described above in accordance with invention methods for modulating the activity of excitatory amino acid receptors.\n\n\nAs used herein, the phrase “preventing disease conditions” refers to preventing a disease, disorder or condition from occurring in a subject who may be at risk for the disease, but has not yet been diagnosed as having the disease. Those of skill in the art will understand that a variety of methods may be used to determine a subject at risk for a disease, and that whether a subject is at risk for a disease will depend on a variety of factors known to those of skill in the art, including genetic make-up of the subject, age, body weight, sex, diet, general health, occupation, exposure to environmental conditions, marital status, and the like, of the subject.\n\n\nThose of skill in the art can readily identify a variety of assays that can be used to assess the activity of excitatory amino acid receptors. For receptor species that activate a second messenger pathway, assays that measure receptor-activated changes in intracellular second messengers can be employed to monitor receptor activity. For example, inhibition of G-protein-coupled metabotropic glutamate receptors using a radioligand binding assay. (See Example 109.)\n\n\nSimilarly, activation of excitatory amino acid receptors that leads to the release of intracellular calcium or changes in intracellular calcium concentration can also be used to assess excitatory amino acid receptor activity. Methods of detection of transient increases in intracellular calcium concentration are well known in the art. (See e.g., Ito et al., J. Neurochem. 56:531-540 (1991) and Example 108). G-protein coupled receptors are also coupled to other second messenger systems such as phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis (see, e.g., Berridge et al, (1982) Biochem. J. 206: 587-5950; and Nakajima et al., J. Biol. Chem. 267:2437-2442 (1992) and Example 110).\n\n\nThe following examples are intended to illustrate but not to limit the invention in any manner, shape, or form, either explicitly or implicitly. While they are typical of those that might be used, other procedures, methodologies, or techniques known to those skill in the art may alternatively be used.\n\n\nIntermediate 1\n\n\n2-chloro-5-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl]pyridine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2-Chloro-5-iodopyridine (40 mmol, 10.0 g), 2-methyl-4-[(trimethylsilyl)ethynyl]-1,3-thiazole (40 mmol, 7.8 g), dichlorobis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II) (2 mmol, 1.4 g), copper(I) iodide (4 mmol, 760 mg) and triethylamine (200 mmol, 28 mL) were added to deoxygenated DMF (200 mL) at room temperature.

See generally Daggett et al., Neuropharmacology 34:871-886 (1995). Receptor activity was detected by changes in intracellular calcium ([Ca\n2+\n]\ni\n) measured using the fluorescent calcium-sensitive dye, fura-2. hmGluR5a/L38-20 cells were plated onto 96-well plates, and loaded with 3 □M fura-2 for 1 h. Unincorporated dye was washed from the cells, and the cell plate was transferred to a custom-built 96-channel fluorimeter (SIBIA-SAIC, La Jolla, Calif.) which is integrated into a fully automated plate handling and liquid delivery system. Cells were excited at 350 and 385 nm with a xenon source combined with optical filters. Emitted light was collected from the sample through a dichroic mirror and a 510 nm interference filter and directed into a cooled CCD camera (Princeton Instruments). Image pairs were captured approximately every 1 s, and ratio images were generated after background subtraction. After a basal reading of 20 s, an EC\n80 \nconcentration of glutamate (10 □M) was added to the well, and the response evaluated for another 60 s. The glutamate-evoked increase in [Ca\n2+\n]\ni \nin the presence of the screening compound was compared to the response of glutamate alone (the positive control).\n\n\nEXAMPLE 109\n\n\n[\n3\nH]-mGluR5Antagonist Binding to Rodent Brain Membranes\n\n\nIn accordance with Anderson J J, Rao S P, Rowe B, Giracello D R, Holtz G, Chapman D F, Tehrani L, Bradbury M J, Cosford N D, Varney M A, [\n3\nH]Methoxymethyl-3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl]pyridine binding to inetabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 in rodent brain: in vitro and in vivo characterization. \nJ Pharmacol Exp Ther. \n2002 December; 303(3): 1044-51, membranes were prepared (as described in Ransom R W and Stec N L (1988) Cooperative modulation of [\n3\nH]MK-801 binding to the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-ion channel complex by L-glutamate, glycine, and polyamines. \nJ Neurochem \n51:830-836) using whole rat brain, or in Glu5\n+/+\n or mGlu5\n−/−\n whole mouse brain. Binding assays were performed as described in Schaffhauser H, Richards J G, Cartmell J, Chaboz S, Kemp J A, Klingelschmidt A, Messer J, Stadler H, Woltering T and Mutel V (1998) In vitro binding characteristics of a new selective group HI metabotropic glutamate receptor radioligand, [\n3\nH]LY354740, in rat brain. \nMol Pharmacol \n53:228-233.) at room temperature with slight modifications. Briefly, membranes were thawed and washed once with assay buffer (50 mM HEPES, 2 mM MgCl\n2\n, pH 7.4), followed by centrifugation at 40,000×g for 20 min. The pellet was resuspended in assay buffer and briefly homogenized with a Polytron.\n\n\nFor protein linearity experiments, increasing concentrations of membrane protein were added to 96-well plates in triplicate and binding was initiated by addition of 20 nM [\n3\nH]methoxymethyl-3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl]pyridine. The assay was incubated for 2 h and non-specific binding was determined using 10 μM MPEP. The binding was terminated by rapid filtration through glass-fiber filters (Unifilter-96 GF/B plate, Packard) using a 96-well plate Brandel cell harvester. Following addition of scintillant, the radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Protein measurements were performed by BioRad-DC Protein assay using bovine serum albumin as the standard.\n\n\nSaturation binding experiments were performed in triplicate with increasing concentrations of [\n3\nH]methoxymethyl-3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl]pyridine (1 pM to 100 nM). The time course of association was measured by the addition of 10 nM [\n3\nH]methoxymethyl-3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl]pyridine to the membranes at different time points (0-240 min), followed by filtration. Dissociation was measured by the addition of 100 μM unlabeled methoxymethyl-3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl]pyridine at different time points to membranes previously incubated for 3 h with 10 nM [\n3\nH]methoxymethyl-3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl]pyridine. For competition experiments, 100 μg membrane protein and 10 nM [\n3\nH]methoxymethyl-3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl]pyridine was added to wells containing increasing concentration of the test compound in duplicate (methoxymethyl-3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl]pyridine or MPEP). [3H]-3-Methoxy-5-(pyridin-2-ylethynyl)pyridine may also be used as the radioligand in the procedure described above. (See, Cosford, N. D. P.; Roppe, J.; Telrani, L.; Seiders, T. J.; Schweiger, E.

Lett. \n2003, 13, 351-354.)\n\n\nEXAMPLE 110\n\n\nPhosphatidylinositol Hydrolysis (IP) Assay\n\n\nInositol phosphate assays were performed as described by Berridge et al. (1982) (Berridge et al, (1982) Biochem. J. 206: 587-5950; and Nakajima et al., J. Biol. Chem. 267:2437-2442 (1992)) with slight modifications. Mouse fibroblast Ltk cells expressing hmGluR5 (hmGluR5/L38-20 cells) were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 8×105 cells/well. One □Ci of [\n3\nH]-inositol (Amersham PT6-271; Arlington Heights, Ill.; specific activity=17.7 Ci/mmol) was added to each well and incubated for 16 h at 37° C. Cells were washed twice and incubated for 45 min in 0.5 ml of standard Hepes buffered saline buffer (HBS; 125 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 0.620M MgSO\n4\n, 1.8 mM CaCl\n2\n, 20 mM HEPES, 6 mM glucose, pH to 7.4). The cells were washed with HBS containing 10 mM LiCl, and 400 ill buffer added to each well. Cells were incubated at 37° C. for 20 min. For testing, 50 □L, of 10× compounds used in the practice of the invention [made in HBS/LiCl (100 mM)] was added and incubated for 10 minutes. Cells were activated by the addition of 10 pM glutamate, and the plates left for 1 hour at 37° C.\n\n\nThe incubations were terminated by the addition of 1 mL ice-cold methanol to each well. In order to isolate inositol phosphates (IPs), the cells were scraped from wells, and placed in numbered glass test tubes. Chloroform (1 mL) was added to each tube, the tubes were mixed, and the phases separated by centrifugation. IPs were separated on Dowex anion exchange columns (AG 1-XS100-200 mesh formate form). The upper aqueous layer (750 □L) was added to the Dowex columns, and the PCT/US00/23923 109 columns eluted with distilled water (3 mL). The eluents were discarded, and the columns were washed with 60 mM ammonium formate/5 mM Borax (10 mL), which was also discarded as waste. Finally the columns were eluted with 800 mM ammonium formate/0.1 M formic acid (4 mL), and the samples collected in scintillation vials. Scintillant was added to each vial, and the vials shaken, and counted in a scintillation counter after 2 hours. Phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis in cells treated with certain exemplary compounds was compared to phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis in cells treated with control. Using this procedure an IC\n50 \nvalue of 33 nM was obtained for Example 1 and an IC\n50 \nvalue of 2 nM for Example 18.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 111\n\n\nActivity of Representative Compounds\n\n\nThe activity of certain of the compounds disclosed in the previous examples is presented below (N.D.=not determined):\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nExample\n \nCalcium Flux Assay (nM)\n \nKi (nM)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1\n \n3\n \n20\n \n \n \n2\n \n1.0\n \n2.0\n \n \n \n3\n \n0.9\n \n2.7\n \n \n \n4\n \n2.2\n \n2.6\n \n \n \n5\n \n6.3\n \n1.0\n \n \n \n6\n \n4.4\n \n1.2\n \n \n \n7\n \n1.1\n \n0.7\n \n \n \n8\n \n1.0\n \n0.9\n \n \n \n9\n \n1.1\n \nN.D.\n \n \n \n10\n \n0.7\n \nN.D.\n \n \n \n11\n \n1.3\n \nN.D.\n \n \n \n12\n \n0.6\n \n1.1\n \n \n \n13\n \n0.6\n \n0.6\n \n \n \n14\n \n0.8\n \n7.5\n \n \n \n15\n \n1.0\n \n2.6\n \n \n \n16\n \n0.4\n \n8.6\n \n \n \n17\n \n0.4\n \n3.8\n \n \n \n18\n \n4.9\n \n19.3\n \n \n \n19\n \n1.8\n \n2.8\n \n \n \n20\n \n1.0\n \n1.4\n \n \n \n21\n \n1.5\n \n1.5\n \n \n \n22\n \n1.2\n \n0.9\n \n \n \n23\n \n1.6\n \n1.6\n \n \n \n24\n \n0.3\n \n2.6\n \n \n \n25\n \n1.4\n \n9.0\n \n \n \n26\n \n0.1\n \n2.0\n \n \n \n27\n \n1.4\n \n1.0\n \n \n \n28\n \n1.7\n \n0.9\n \n \n \n29\n \n0.5\n \n10\n \n \n \n30\n \n2.2\n \n2.3\n \n \n \n31\n \n2.9\n \n12.2\n \n \n \n32\n \n1.0\n \n4.8\n \n \n \n33\n \n19\n \n7\n \n \n \n34\n \n18\n \n15\n \n \n \n35\n \n17\n \n5\n \n \n \n36\n \n14\n \n3\n \n \n \n37\n \n14\n \n10\n \n \n \n38\n \n13\n \n8\n \n \n \n39\n \n13\n \n4\n \n \n \n40\n \n12\n \n9\n \n \n \n41\n \n11\n \n5\n \n \n \n42\n \n11\n \n17\n \n \n \n43\n \n11\n \n0.65\n \n \n \n44\n \n11\n \n2\n \n \n \n45\n \n11\n \n7\n \n \n \n46\n \n11\n \n2\n \n \n \n47\n \n11\n \n19\n \n \n \n48\n \n9\n \n12.5\n \n \n \n49\n \n9\n \n5.5\n \n \n \n50\n \n9\n \n12\n \n \n \n51\n \n8\n \n9\n \n \n \n52\n \n8\n \n2\n \n \n \n53\n \n8\n \n8\n \n \n \n54\n \n8\n \n1.5\n \n \n \n55\n \n7\n \n4\n \n \n \n56\n \n7\n \n13\n \n \n \n57\n \n7\n \n7.5\n \n \n \n58\n \n7\n \n1.5\n \n \n \n59\n \n6\n \n4\n \n \n \n60\n \n6\n \n1.5\n \n \n \n61\n \n6\n \n12\n \n \n \n62\n \n6\n \n11\n \n \n \n63\n \n6\n \n4\n \n \n \n64\n \n6\n \n0.8\n \n \n \n65\n \n6\n \n8\n \n \n \n66\n \n5\n \n9\n \n \n \n67\n \n5\n \n7\n \n \n \n68\n \n5\n \n7\n \n \n \n69\n \n5\n \n14\n \n \n \n70\n \n5\n \n5\n \n \n \n71\n \n5\n \n4.5\n \n \n \n72\n \n5\n \n7\n \n \n \n73\n \n4\n \n2\n \n \n \n74\n \n4\n \n7.5\n \n \n \n75\n \n4\n \n4\n \n \n \n76\n \n3.5\n \n3\n \n \n \n77\n \n3\n \n13\n \n \n \n78\n \n3\n \n1.4\n \n \n \n79\n \n3\n \n16\n \n \n \n80\n \n3\n \n3\n \n \n \n81\n \n3\n \n6\n \n \n \n82\n \n3\n \n2\n \n \n \n83\n \n2\n \n12\n \n \n \n84\n \n2\n \n7\n \n \n \n85\n \n2\n \n1\n \n \n \n86\n \n2\n \n7\n \n \n \n87\n \n2\n \nN.D.\n \n \n \n88\n \n2\n \n4\n \n \n \n89\n \n1.6\n \n2\n \n \n \n90\n \n1.5\n \n4\n \n \n \n91\n \n1\n \n1\n \n \n \n92\n \n12\n \n7\n \n \n \n93\n \n11\n \n3\n \n \n \n94\n \n9\n \n6\n \n \n \n95\n \n8\n \n9\n \n \n \n96\n \n5\n \n5\n \n \n \n97\n \n5\n \n13\n \n \n \n98\n \n4\n \n8\n \n \n \n99\n \n2.8\n \n33\n \n \n \n100\n \n2.3\n \n23\n \n \n \n101\n \n2\n \n24\n \n \n \n102\n \n2\n \n26\n \n \n \n103\n \n1.6\n \n1.6\n \n \n \n104\n \n1.5\n \n6\n \n \n \n105\n \n1\n \n1\n \n \n \n106\n \nN.D.\n \n6\n \n \n \n107\n \n16\n \n9\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNd = not determined\n \n \n \n \n \n\nNote that the relatively high values in the calcium flux and binding assays, for Example 18, are counterbalanced by assay results in the IP assay (as reported in Example 110).\n\n\n\nWhile the invention has been described in detail with reference to certain preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood that modifications and variations are within the spirit and scope of that which is described and claimed."
