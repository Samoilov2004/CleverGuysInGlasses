This invention is also directed to pharmaceutical compositions containing the pyrimidine-5-carboxamide compounds and methods of using the compounds or compositions to treat a condition characterized by other indications. The invention is also directed to methods of making the compounds described herein.\n\n\n \nSTATE OF THE ART\n\n\n \n \n \nProtein kinases constitute a large family of structurally related enzymes that are responsible for the control of a variety of signal transduction processes within cells (see, e.g., Hardie and Hanks, The Protein Kinase Facts Book, I and II, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif., 1995). Protein kinases are thought to have evolved from a common ancestral gene due to the conservation of their structure and catalytic function. Almost all kinases contain a similar 250-300 amino acid catalytic domain. The kinases can be categorized into families by the substrates they phosphorylate (e.g., protein-tyrosine, protein-serine/threonine, lipids, etc.). Sequence motifs have been identified that generally correspond to each of these families (see, e.g., Hanks & Hunter, (1995), FASEB J. 9:576-596; Knighton et al., (1991), Science 253:407-414; Hiles et al., (1992), Cell 70:419-429; Kunz et al., (1993), Cell 73:585-596; Garcia-Bustos et al., (1994), EMBO J. 13:2352-2361).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMany diseases are associated with abnormal cellular responses triggered by protein kinase-mediated events. These diseases include autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, bone diseases, metabolic diseases, neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, allergies, asthma, alzheimer's disease and hormone-related diseases. As a consequence, there has been substantial efforts in medicinal chemistry to find inhibitors of protein kinases for use as therapeutic agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmunoreceptor tyrosine activation motif (ITAM)-mediated signaling has emerged as a primary event in signaling pathways responsible for human pathologies. ITAM-mediated signaling is responsible for relaying activation signals initiated at classical immune receptors such as T-cell receptors, B-cell receptors, Fc receptors in immune cells and at GPVI and FcγRIIa in platelets to downstream intracellular molecules such as syk and ZAP-70 (Underhill, D. M and Goodridge, H. S., \nTrends Immunol., \n28:66-73, 2007).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe binding of a ligand to an ITAM-containing receptor triggers signaling events which allows for the recruitment of proteins from a family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases called the Src family. These kinases phosphorylate tyrosine residues within the ITAM sequence, a region with which the tandem SH2 domains on either syk or ZAP-70 interact.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSyk, along with Zap-70, is a member of the syk family of protein tyrosine kinases. The interaction of syk or ZAP-70 with diphosphorylated ITAM sequences induces a conformation change in the kinases that allows for tyrosine phosphorylation of the kinase itself. Phosphorylated Syk family members activate a multitude of downstream signaling pathway proteins which include Src homology 2 (SH2) domain containing leukocyte-specific phosphoprotein of 76 kDa (SLP-76), Linker of Activation of T-cells (LAT) and PLC (phospholipase C)γ2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHuman pathologies attributed to dysfunctional ITAM-mediated signaling include autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus, multiple sclerosis, hemolytic anemia, immune-thrombocytopenia purpura, and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and arteriosclerosis. Interestingly, many of the above mentioned diseases are thought to occur through crosslinking of Fc receptors by antibodies which, via syk, activate a signaling cascade in mast, basophil and other immune cells that result in the release of cell mediators responsible for inflammatory reactions. The release of mediators and the production of cytokines in IgE stimulation-dependent allergic and inflammatory reactions from mast cells and basophiles can be controlled by inhibiting the tyrosine kinase activity of syk (Rossi, A. B. et al., \nJ Allergy Clin Immunol., \n118:749-755, 2006). In immune-thrombocytopenia, antibody bound platelets are cleared by the spleen by an Fc receptor/ITAM/syk-mediated process (Crow, A. R. et al., \nBlood, \n106:abstract 2165, 2005). Drug-induced thrombocytopenia, caused by heparin-\nplatelet factor\n 4 immune complexes that activate platelet FcγRIIa, also involve syk signaling downstream of receptor engagement (Reilly, M. P., \nBlood, \n98:2442-2447, 2001).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPlatelet agonists induce inside-out integrin signaling resulting in fibrinogen binding and platelet aggregation. This initiates outside-in signaling which produces further stimulation of platelets. syk is activated during both phases of integrin signaling, and inhibition of syk is shown to inhibit platelet adhesion to immobilized proteins (Law, D. A. et al., \nBlood, \n93:2645-2652, 1999). Release of arachidonic acid and serotonin and platelet aggregation induced by collagen are markedly inhibited in platelets derived from syk deficient mouse (Poole, A. et al., \nEMBO J., \n16:2333-2341, 1997). Thus syk inhibitors may also possess anticoagulation action.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBecause of the role syk plays in Ig-induced platelet activations, it is likely to be important in arteriosclerosis and restenosis. Arteriosclerosis is a class of diseases characterized by the thickening and hardening of the arterial walls of blood vessels. Although all blood vessels are susceptible to this serious degenerative condition, the aorta and the coronary arteries serving the heart are most often affected. Arteriosclerosis is of profound clinical importance since it can increase the risk of heart attacks, myocardial infarctions, strokes, and aneurysms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe traditional treatment for arteriosclerosis includes vascular recanalization procedures for less-serious blockages and coronary bypass surgery for major blockages. A serious shortcoming of intravascular procedures is that, in a significant number of treated individuals, some or all of the treated vessels restenose (i.e., re-narrow). For example, restenosis of an atherosclerotic coronary artery after PTCA occurs in 10-50% of patients undergoing this procedure and subsequently requires either further angioplasty or a coronary artery bypass graft. Furthermore, restenosis of an atherosclerotic coronary artery after stenting occurs in 10-20% of patients undergoing this procedure and subsequently requires repeat treatments to maintain adequate blood flow through the affected artery. Restenosis generally occurs in a relatively brief time period, e.g., roughly less than six months, after treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile the exact hormonal and cellular processes promoting restenosis have not been determined, restenosis is thought to be due in part to mechanical injury to the walls of the blood vessels caused by the balloon catheter or other intravascular device. For example, the process of PTCA, in addition to opening the obstructed artery, also injures resident coronary arterial smooth muscle cells (SMCs). In response to this injury, adhering platelets, infiltrating macrophages, leukocytes, or the smooth muscle cells themselves release cell-derived growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), with subsequent proliferation and migration of medial SMCs through the internal elastic lamina to the area of the vessel intima. Further proliferation and hyperplasia of intimal SMCs and, most significantly, production of large amounts of extracellular matrix over a period of three to six months results in the filling in and narrowing of the vascular space sufficient to significantly obstruct blood flow.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the role syk plays in Ig-induced platelet activations, syk plays a very important role in collagen-mediated signaling. The primary adhesive protein responsible for platelet adhesion and activation is collagen. Collagen is a filamentous protein contained within the fibrotic caps of atheromas which becomes exposed to blood during plaque rupture. Collagen functions initially by binding von Willebrand factor which tethers platelets through binding platelet membrane GPIb. Collagen functions secondarily by engaging the two collagen receptors on platelets, GPVI and integrin α2β1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGPVI exists in platelet membranes as a complex with FcRγ, an interaction required for the expression of GPVI. Activation of FcγRIIa on platelets results in platelet shape change, secretion and thrombosis. Signaling by the GPVI/FcRγ complex is initiated by tyrosine phosphorylation of the ITAM domain of FCRγ followed by the recruitment of syk.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nActivation of GPVI leads to induction of multiple platelet functions including: activation of integrins α2β1 to achieve firm platelet adhesion, and GP IIb-IIIa which mediates platelet aggregation and thrombosis growth; platelet secretion, allowing for the delivery of inflammatory proteins such as CD40L, RANTES and TGFβ to the vessel wall; and the expression of P-selectin which allows for the recruitment of leukocytes. Therefore, it is believed that syk inhibitors can inhibit thrombotic events mediated by platelet adhesion, activation and aggregation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt has been reported that the tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular protein (activation) induced by stimulation of a receptor for IgG antibody, FcγR, and the phagocytosis mediated by FcγR are considerably inhibited in macrophages derived from syk deficient mouse (Crowley, M. T. et al., \nJ. Exp. Med., \n186:1027-1039, 1997). This suggests that syk has a markedly important role in the FcγR-mediated phagocytosis of macrophages.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt has also been reported that an antisense oligonucleotide of syk suppresses the apoptosis inhibition of eosinophils induced by GM-CSF (Yousefi, S. et al., \nJ. E. Med., \n183:1407-1414, 1996), showing that syk is essential for the life extending signal of eosinophils caused by GM-CSF and the like. Since life extension of eosinophils is closely related to the transition of diseases into a chronic state in allergic disorders, such as asthma, syk inhibitors can also serve as therapeutic agents for chronic eosinophilic inflammation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSyk is important for the activation of B-cells via a B-cell antigen receptor and is involved in the phosphatidylinositol metabolism and increase in the intracellular calcium concentration caused by the antigen receptor stimulation (Hutchcroft, J E. et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem., \n267:8613-8619, 1992; and Takata, M. et al., \nEMBO J., \n13:1341-1349, 1994). Thus, syk inhibitors may be used to control the function of B-cells and are, therefore, expected to serve as therapeutic agents for antibody-related diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSyk binds to a T-cell antigen receptor, quickly undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation through crosslinking of the receptor and synergistically acts upon intracellular signals mediated by Src tyrosine kinases such as Lck (Couture, C. et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, \n91:5301-5305, 1994; and Couture, C. et al., \nMol. Cell. Biol., \n14:5249-5258, 1994). syk is present in mature T-cell populations, such as intraepithelial γδ T-cells and naïve αβ T-cells, and has been reported to be capable of phosphorylation of multiple components of the TCR signaling cascade (Latour, S. et. al., \nMol Cell Biol., \n17:4434-4441, 1997). As a consequence, syk inhibitors may serve as agents for inhibiting cellular immunity mediated by T-cell antigen receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecent comparative genomic hybridization studies have identified syk as another gene important in the pathogenesis of Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) (Chen, R. et al. \nJournal of Clinical Oncology, \n2007 ASCO Annual Meeting Proceedings (Post-Meeting Edition). \nVol\n 25, No 18S (June 20 Supplement), 2007: 8056). MCL represents 5-10% of all non-Hodgkins lymphomas and it is a difficult form of lymphoma to treat. It has the worst prognosis among the B cell lymphomas with median survival of three years. It has been reported that Syk is overexpressed in MCL (Rinaldi, A, et. al, \nBr. J. Haematol., \n2006; 132:303-316) and that Syk mediates mTOR (mammalian target of Rapamycin) survival signals in follicular, mantel cell, Burkitt's, and diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (Leseux, L., et. al, Blood, 2006; 108:4156-4162).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral lines of evidence suggest that many B-cell lymphomas depend upon B-cell receptor (BCR)-mediated survival signals. BCR signaling induces receptor oligomerization and phosphorylation of Igα and β immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activated motifs by SRC family kinases. ITAM phosphorylation results in the recruitment and activation of syk that initiates downstream events and amplifies the original BCR signal. Given the role of tonic BCR signaling in normal B cell and syk-dependent survival of non-Hodgkins lymphoma cell lines in vitro (Chen, L., et. al, \nBlood, \n2006; 108:3428-3433), syk inhibition is a promising rational treatment target for certain B-cell lymphomas and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (Stefania Gobessi, Luca Laurenti, Pablo Longo, Laura Carsetti, Giuseppe Leone, Dimitar G. Efremov, Constitutive activation of the protein tyrosine kinase Syk in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia B-cells, Blood, 2007, 110, Abstract 1123). Recent data shows that administration of a multikinase inhibitor which inhibits syk, may have significant clinical activity in CLL patients (Friedberg J W et al, \nBlood \n2008; 112(11), Abstract 3).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe oncogenic potential of the spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) has been described in a number of different settings. Clinically, Syk over-expression is reported in Mantle Cell Lymphoma (Rinaldi, A, et. al, \nBr. J. Haematol., \n2006; 132:303-316) and the TEL-Syk fusion protein (Translocated ETS Leukemia) generated by a chromosomal translocation (t(9;12)(q22;p12)) leads to increased Syk activity and is associated with myelodysplastic syndrome (Kuno, Y., et. al, \nBlood, \n2001; 97:1050-1055). Leukemia is induced in mice by adoptively transferring bone marrow cells that express human TEL-Syk (Wossning, T., JEM, 2006; 203:2829-2840). Further, in mouse primary bone marrow cells, over-expression of Syk results in IL-7 independent growth in culture (Wossning, T., et. al, JEM, 2006; 203:2829-2840).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInterestingly, Syk signaling appears to be required for B-cell development and survival in humans and mouse. Inducible loss of the B-cell receptor (Lam, K., et. al, Cell, 1997; 90:1073-1083) or Igα (Kraus, M., et. al, Cell, 2004; 117:787-800) results in loss of peripheral B-cells in mice. Over-expression of the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP-RO, which is known to negatively regulate Syk activity, inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in cell lines derived from non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (Chen, L., et. al, \nBlood, \n2006; 108:3428-3433). Finally, B-cell lymphomas rarely exhibit loss of BCR expression, and anti-idiotype therapy rarely leads to resistance (Kuppers, R. Nat Rev Cancer, 2005; 5:251-262).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEngagement of the antigen-specific B cell receptor (BCR) activates multiple signaling pathways that ultimately regulate the cells activation status, promoting survival and clonal expansion. Signaling through the BCR is made possible by its association with two other members of the immunoglobulin super-family; Igα and Igβ, each bearing an immuno-tyrosine based activation motif (ITAM) (Jumaa, Hendriks et al. Annu Rev Immunol 23: 415-45 (2005). The ITAM domain is directly phosphorylated by Src family kinases in response to BCR engagement. The spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) docks with and phosphorylates the ITAM, a process that enhances its kinase activity, resulting in Syk autophosphorylation and tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple downstream substrates (Rolli, Gallwitz et al. Mol Cell 10(5): 1057-69 (2002). This signaling pathway is active in B cells beginning at the transition from pro- to pre-B cell stage of development, when the newly formed pre-BCR is expressed. In fact, B cell development arrests at the pro-B cell stage in Syk knockout mice (Cheng, Rowley et al. 1995; Turner, Mee et al. Nature 378(6554): 303-6 (1995). Inducible loss of the B cell receptor (Lam, Kuhn et al. Cell 90(6): 1073-83 (1997) or Igα (Kraus, Alimzhanov et al. Cell 117(6): 787-800 (2004) results in loss of peripheral B cells in mice. Human B cells also appear to require Syk for proliferation and survival. Over-expression of the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP-RO, a negative regulator of Syk activity, inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in cell lines derived from non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) (Chen, Juszczynski et al. Blood 108(10): 3428-33 (2006). Knock down of Syk by siRNA in the NHL line SUDHL-4 led to a block in the G1/S transition of the cell cycle (Gururajan, Dasu et al. J Immunol 178(1): 111-21 (2007). Together, these data suggest that Syk signaling is required for the development, proliferation, and even survival of human and mouse B cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConversely, the oncogenic potential of Syk has been described in a number of different settings. Clinically, Syk over-expression is reported in Mantle Cell Lymphoma (Rinaldi, Kwee et al. Br J Haematol 132(3): 303-16 (2006) and the TEL-Syk fusion protein (Translocated ETS Leukemia) generated by a chromosomal translocation (t(9;12)(q22;p12)) leads to increased Syk activity and is associated with myelodysplastic syndrome (Kuno, Abe et al. Blood 97(4): 1050-5 (2001). Leukemia is induced in mice by the adoptive transfer of bone marrow cells that express human TEL-Syk (Wossning, Herzog et al. J Exp Med 203(13): 2829-40 (2006). Further, in mouse primary bone marrow cells, over-expression of Syk results in IL-7 independent growth in culture (Wossning, Herzog et al. 2006). Consistently, Syk was reported to mediate mTOR (mammalian target of Rapamycin) survival signals in follicular, mantle cell, Burkitt's, and diffuse large B-cell NHL (Leseux, Hamdi et al. Blood 108(13): 4156-62 (2006). Additional recent studies also suggest that Syk-dependant survival signals may play a role in B-cell malignancies, including DLBCL, mantle cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma (Gururajan, Jennings et al. 2006; Irish, Czerwinski et al. J Immunol 176(10): 5715-9 (2006). Given the role of tonic BCR signaling in normal B cells and Syk-dependent survival of NHL cell lines in vitro, the specific inhibition of Syk may prove promising for the treatment of certain B-cell lymphomas.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecently, R406 (Rigel Pharmaceuticals) was reported to inhibit ITAM signaling in response to various stimuli, including FcεR1 and BCR induced Syk activation (Braselmann, Taylor et al. J Pharmacol Exp Ther 319(3): 998-1008 (2006). Interestingly, this ATP-competitive inhibitor of Syk was also active against Flt3, cKit, and JAK kinases, but not against Src kinsase (Braselmann, Taylor et al. 2006). Activating mutations to Flt3 are associated with AML and inhibition of this kinase is currently under clinical development (Burnett and Knapper Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program 2007: 429-34 (2007). Over-activation of the tyrosine kinase cKit is also associated with hematologic malignancies, and a target for cancer therapy (Heinrich, Griffith et al. Blood 96(3): 925-32 (2000). Similarly, JAK3 signaling is implicated in leukemias and lymphomas, and is currently exploited as a potential therapeutic target (Heinrich, Griffith et al. 2000). Importantly, the multi-kinase inhibitory activity of R406 attenuates BCR signaling in lymphoma cell lines and primary human lymphoma samples, resulting in apoptosis of the former (Chen, Monti et al. Blood 111(4): 2230-7 (2008). Further, a phase II clinical trial reported favorable results by this compound in refractory NHL and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Friedberg J W et al, \nBlood \n2008; 112(11), Abstract 3). Although the precise mechanism of action is unclear for R406, the data suggest that inhibition of kinases that mediate survival signaling in lymphocytes is clinically beneficial.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional recent studies also suggest that syk-dependant survival signals may play a role in B-cell malignancies, including DLBCL, mantle cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma (see e.g., S. Linfengshen et al. \nBlood, February \n2008; 111: 2230-2237; J. M. Irish et al. \nBlood, \n2006; 108: 3135-3142; A. Renaldi et al. \nBrit J. Haematology, \n2006; 132: 303-316; M.

For example, “C\n1-8\nalkyl” refers to a hydrocarbon radical straight or branched, containing from 1 to 8 carbon atoms that is derived by the removal of one hydrogen atom from a single carbon atom of a parent alkane. The phrase “unsubstituted alkyl” refers to alkyl groups that do not contain groups other than fully saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon radicals. Thus the phrase includes straight chain alkyl groups such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl, dodecyl and the like. The phrase also includes branched chain isomers of straight chain alkyl groups such as isopropyl, t-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, and the like. Representative alkyl groups include straight and branched chain alkyl groups having 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 or 12 carbon atoms. Further representative alkyl groups include straight and branched chain alkyl groups having 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 carbon atoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Alkenyl” by itself or as part of another substituent refers to a straight or branched chain, which may be mono- or polyunsaturated, having the number of carbon atoms designated. For example, “C\n2\n-C\n8 \nalkenyl” means an alkenyl radical having from 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 atoms that is derived by the removal of one hydrogen atom from a single carbon atom of a parent alkane.

A “substituted” alkenyl group includes alkenyl groups in which a non-carbon or non-hydrogen atom is bonded to a carbon double bonded to another carbon and those in which one of the non-carbon or non-hydrogen atoms is bonded to a carbon not involved in a double bond to another carbon. Each site of unsaturation may be either cis or trans configuration about the double bond(s).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “alkynyl”, by itself or as part of another substituent, means a straight or branched chain hydrocarbon radical, which may be mono- or polyunsaturated, having the number of carbon atoms designated. For example, “C\n2\n-C\n8 \nalkynyl” means an alkynyl radical having from 2 to 8 carbon atoms that is derived by the removal of one hydrogen atom from a single carbon atom of a parent alkane. “Unsubstituted alkynyl” refers to straight and branched chain groups such as those described with respect to unsubstituted alkyl groups as defined above, except that at least one triple bond exists between two carbon atoms. Examples include, but are not limited to ethynyl e.g. —Ca≡C(H), 1-propynyl e.g. —C≡C(CH\n3\n), —C≡C(CH\n2\nCH\n3\n), —C(H\n2\n)C≡C(H), —C(H)\n2\nC≡C(CH\n3\n), and —C(H)\n2\nC≡C(CH\n2\nCH\n3\n) among others, and higher homologs and isomers thereof. A “substituted” alkynyl group includes alkynyl groups in which a non-carbon or non-hydrogen atom is bonded to a carbon triple bonded to another carbon and those in which a non-carbon or non-hydrogen atom is bonded to a carbon not involved in a triple bond to another carbon.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Alkylene” by itself or as part of another substituent means a divalent radical derived from an alkane, as exemplified by —CH\n2\nCH\n2\nCH\n2\nCH\n2\n—.

In other embodiments, sulfur may be oxidized to —S(O)— or —SO\n2\n— moieties.

For example, “heterocyclo group optionally mono- or di-substituted with an alkyl group means that the alkyl may but need not be present, and the description includes situations where the heterocyclo group is mono- or disubstituted with an alkyl group and situations where the heterocyclo group is not substituted with the alkyl group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Optionally substituted” means a ring which is optionally substituted independently with substituents. A site of a group that is unsubstituted may be substituted with hydrogen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Oxo” refers to the divalent group ═O.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Sulfanyl” refers to the group —SR\nf \nwhere R\nf \nis as defined herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Sulfinyl” refers to the group —S(═O)—R\ne \nwhere R\ne \nis as defined herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Sulfonic acid” refers to the group —S(O)\n2\n—OH.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Sulfonyl” refers to the group —S(O)\n2\n—R\ne \nwhere R\ne \nis as defined herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Sulfonylamino” refers to —NR\na\nS(═O)\n2\n—R\ne \nwhere R\na \nis selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, heteroaryl and heterocyclyl and R\ne \nis as defined herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Sulfonyloxy” refers to the group —OSO\n2\n—R\nc\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds that have the same molecular formula but differ in the nature or sequence of bonding of their atoms or the arrangement of their atoms in space are termed “isomers”. Isomers that differ in the arrangement of their atoms in space are termed “stereoisomers”. “Stereoisomer” and “stereoisomers” refer to compounds that exist in different stereoisomeric forms if they possess one or more asymmetric centers or a double bond with asymmetric substitution and, therefore, can be produced as individual stereoisomers or as mixtures. Stereoisomers include enantiomers and diastereomers. Stereoisomers that are not mirror images of one another are termed “diastereomers” and those that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other are termed “enantiomers”. When a compound has an asymmetric center, for example, it is bonded to four different groups, a pair of enantiomers is possible. An enantiomer can be characterized by the absolute configuration of its asymmetric center and is described by the R- and S-sequencing rules of Calm and Prelog, or by the manner in which the molecule rotates the plane of polarized light and designated as dextrorotatory or levorotatory (i.e., as (+) or (−)-isomers respectively). A chiral compound can exist as either individual enantiomer or as a mixture thereof. A mixture containing equal proportions of the enantiomers is called a “racemic mixture”. Unless otherwise indicated, the description is intended to include individual stereoisomers as well as mixtures. The methods for the determination of stereochemistry and the separation of stereoisomers are well-known in the art (see discussion in \nChapter\n 4 of A\nDVANCED \nO\nRGANIC \nC\nHEMISTRY\n, 4th edition J. March, John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1992) differ in the chirality of one or more stereocenters.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Thioacyl” refers to the groups R\na\n—C(S)—.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Thiol” refers to the group—SH.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Tautomer” refers to alternate forms of a molecule that differ in the position of a proton, such as enol-keto and imine-enamine tautomers, or the tautomeric forms of heteroaryl groups containing a —N═C(H)—NH— ring atom arrangement, such as pyrazoles, imidazoles, benzimidazoles, triazoles, and tetrazoles. A person of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that other tautomeric ring atom arrangements are possible.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is understood that in all substituted groups defined above, polymers arrived at by defining substituents with further substituents to themselves (e.g., substituted aryl having a substituted aryl group as a substituent which is itself substituted with a substituted aryl group, which is further substituted by a substituted aryl group, etc.) are not intended for inclusion herein. In such cases, the maximum number of such substitutions is three. For example, serial substitutions of substituted aryl groups are limited to -substituted aryl-(substituted aryl)-substituted aryl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Protecting group” refers to a group of atoms that, when attached to a reactive functional group in a molecule, mask, reduce or prevent the reactivity of the functional group. Typically, a protecting group may be selectively removed as desired during the course of a synthesis. Examples of protecting groups can be found in Greene and Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, 3\nrd \nEd., 1999, John Wiley & Sons, NY and Harrison et al., Compendium of Synthetic Organic Methods, Vols. 1-8, 1971-1996, John Wiley & Sons, NY. Representative amino protecting groups include, but are not limited to, formyl, acetyl, trifluoroacetyl, benzyl, benzyloxycarbonyl (“CBZ”), tert-butoxycarbonyl (“Boc”), trimethylsilyl (“TMS”), 2-trimethylsilyl-ethanesulfonyl (“TES”), trityl and substituted trityl groups, allyloxycarbonyl, 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (“FMOC”), nitro-veratryloxycarbonyl (“NVOC”) and the like. Representative hydroxy protecting groups include, but are not limited to, those where the hydroxy group is either acylated or alkylated such as benzyl and trityl ethers, as well as alkyl ethers, tetrahydropyranyl ethers, trialkylsilyl ethers (e.g., TMS or TIPPS groups) and allyl ethers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” is meant to include salts of the active compounds which are prepared with relatively nontoxic acids or bases, depending on the particular substituents found on the compounds described herein. When compounds of the present invention contain relatively acidic functionalities, base addition salts can be obtained by contacting the neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of the desired base, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of salts derived from pharmaceutically-acceptable inorganic bases include aluminum, ammonium, calcium, copper, ferric, ferrous, lithium, magnesium, manganic, manganous, potassium, sodium, zinc and the like. Salts derived from pharmaceutically-acceptable organic bases include salts of primary, secondary and tertiary amines, including substituted amines, cyclic amines, naturally-occurring amines and the like, such as arginine, betaine, caffeine, choline, N,N′-dibenzylethylenediamine, diethylamine, 2-diethylaminoethanol, 2-dimethylaminoethanol, ethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N-ethylmorpholine, N-ethylpiperidine, glucamine, glucosamine, histidine, hydrabamine, isopropylamine, lysine, methylglucamine, morpholine, piperazine, piperidine, polyamine resins, procaine, purines, theobromine, triethylamine, trimethylamine, tripropylamine, tromethamine and the like. When compounds of the present invention contain relatively basic functionalities, acid addition salts can be obtained by contacting the neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of the desired acid, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include those derived from inorganic acids like hydrochloric, hydrobromic, nitric, carbonic, monohydrogencarbonic, phosphoric, monohydrogenphosphoric, dihydrogenphosphoric, sulfuric, monohydrogensulfuric, hydriodic, or phosphorous acids and the like, as well as the salts derived from relatively nontoxic organic acids like acetic, propionic, isobutyric, malonic, benzoic, succinic, suberic, fumaric, mandelic, phthalic, benzenesulfonic, p-tolylsulfonic, citric, tartaric, methanesulfonic, and the like. Also included are salts of amino acids such as arginate and the like, and salts of organic acids like glucuronic or galactunoric acids and the like (see, e.g., Berge, S. M. et al., “Pharmaceutical Salts,” \nJournal of Pharmaceutical Science, \n66:1-19, 1977). Certain specific compounds of the present invention contain both basic and acidic functionalities that allow the compounds to be converted into either base or acid addition salts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe neutral forms of the compounds may be regenerated by contacting the salt with a base or acid and isolating the parent compound in the conventional manner. The parent form of the compound differs from the various salt forms in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents, but otherwise the salts are equivalent to the parent form of the compound for the purposes of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to salt forms, the present invention provides compounds which are in a prodrug ester form. “Prodrug”s of the compounds described herein are those compounds that readily undergo chemical changes under physiological conditions to provide the compounds of the present invention. Additionally, prodrugs can be converted to the compounds of the present invention by chemical or biochemical methods in an ex vivo environment. For example, prodrugs can be slowly converted to the compounds of the present invention when placed in a transdermal patch reservoir with a suitable enzyme or chemical reagent. Prodrugs are frequently, but not necessarily, pharmacologically inactive until converted into the active drug. Prodrugs are typically obtained by masking a functional group in the drug believed to be in part required for activity with a progroup (defined below) to form a promoiety which undergoes a transformation, such as cleavage, under the specified conditions of use to release the functional group, and hence the active drug. The cleavage of the promoiety may proceed spontaneously, such as by way of a hydrolysis reaction, or it may be catalyzed or induced by another agent, such as by an enzyme, by light, by acid or base, or by a change of or exposure to a physical or environmental parameter, such as a change of temperature. The agent may be endogenous to the conditions of use, such as an enzyme present in the cells to which the prodrug is administered or the acidic conditions of the stomach, or it may be supplied exogenously.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Progroup” refers to a type of protecting group that, when used to mask a functional group within an active drug to form a promoiety, converts the drug into a prodrug. Progroups are typically attached to the functional group of the drug via bonds that are cleavable under specified conditions of use. Thus, a progroup is that portion of a promoiety that cleaves to release the functional group under the specified conditions of use. As a specific example, an amide promoiety of the formula —NH—C(O)CH\n3 \ncomprises the progroup —C(O)CH\n3\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA wide variety of progroups, as well as the resultant promoieties, suitable for masking functional groups in the active syk selective inhibitory compounds to yield prodrugs are well-known in the art. For example, a hydroxyl functional group may be masked as a sulfonate, ester (such as acetate or maleate) or carbonate promoiety, which may be hydrolyzed in vivo to provide the hydroxyl group. An amino functional group may be masked as an amide, carbamate, imine, urea, phosphenyl, phosphoryl or sulfenyl promoiety, which may be hydrolyzed in vivo to provide the amino group. A carboxyl group may be masked as an ester (including methyl, ethyl, pivaloyloxymethyl, silyl esters and thioesters), amide or hydrazide promoiety, which may be hydrolyzed in vivo to provide the carboxyl group. The invention includes those esters and acyl groups known in the art for modifying the solubility or hydrolysis characteristics for use as sustained-release or prodrug formulations. Other specific examples of suitable progroups and their respective promoieties will be apparent to those of skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain compounds of the present invention can exist in unsolvated forms as well as solvated forms, including hydrated forms. “Solvate” refers to a complex formed by combination of solvent molecules with molecules or ions of the solute. The solvent can be an organic compound, an inorganic compound, or a mixture of both. Some examples of solvents include, but are not limited to, methanol, N,N-dimethylformamide, tetrahydrofuran, dimethylsulfoxide, and water. In general, the solvated forms are equivalent to unsolvated forms and are intended to be encompassed within the scope of the present invention. Certain compounds of the present invention may exist in multiple crystalline or amorphous forms. In general, all physical forms are equivalent for the uses contemplated by the present invention and are intended to be within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain compounds of the present invention possess asymmetric carbon atoms (optical centers) or double bonds; the racemates, diastereomers, geometric isomers, regioisomers and individual isomers (e.g., separate enantiomers) are all intended to be encompassed within the scope of the present invention. These isomers can be resolved or asymmetrically synthesized using conventional methods to render the isomers “optically pure”, i.e., substantially free of its other isomers. If, for instance, a particular enantiomer of a compound of the present invention is desired, it may be prepared by asymmetric synthesis, or by derivation with a chrial auxilliary, where the resulting diastereomeric mixture is separated and the auxilliary group cleaved to provide the pure desired enantiomers. Alternatively, where the molecule contains a basic functional group, such as amino, or an acidic functional group, such as carboxyl, diastereomeric salts are formed with an appropriate optically-active acid or base, followed by resolution of the diasteromers thus formed by fractional crystallization or chromatographic means well known in the art, and subsequent recovery of the pure enantiomers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention may also contain unnatural proportions of atomic isotopes at one or more of the atoms that constitute such compounds. For example, the compounds may be radiolabeled with radioactive isotopes, such as for example tritium (\n3\nH), iodine-125 (\n125\nI) or carbon-14 (\n14\nC). All isotopic variations of the compounds of the present invention, whether radioactive or not, are intended to be encompassed within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “administering” refers to oral administration, administration as a suppository, topical contact, intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, intralesional, intranasal or subcutaneous administration, or the implantation of a slow-release device e.g., a mini-osmotic pump, to a subject. Administration is by any route, including parenteral and transmucosal (e.g., buccal, sublingual, palatal, gingival, nasal, vaginal, rectal, or transdermal). Parenteral administration includes, e.g., intravenous, intramuscular, intra-arteriole, intradermal, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intraventricular, and intracranial. Other modes of delivery include, but are not limited to, the use of liposomal formulations, intravenous infusion, transdermal patches, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “agonist” or “activator” refers to an agent or molecule that binds to a receptor of the invention, stimulates, increases, opens, activates, facilitates, enhances activation or enzymatic activity, sensitizes or up regulates the activity of a receptor of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “antagonist” or “inhibitor” refers to an agent or molecule that inhibits or binds to, partially or totally blocks stimulation or activity, decreases, closes, prevents, delays activation or enzymatic activity, inactivates, desensitizes, or down regulates the activity of a receptor of the invention. As used herein, “antagonist” also includes a reverse or inverse agonist.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “condition or disorder responsive to modulation of syk” and related terms and phrases refer to a condition or disorder associated with inappropriate, e.g., less than or greater than normal, activity of syk and at least partially responsive to or affected by modulation of syk (e.g., syk antagonist or agonist results in some improvement in patient well-being in at least some patients). Inappropriate functional activity of syk might arise as the result of expression of syk in cells which normally do not express the receptor, greater than normal production of syk, or slower than normal metabolic inactivation or elimination of syk or its active metabolites, increased expression of syk or degree of intracellular activation (leading to, e.g., inflammatory and immune-related disorders and conditions) or decreased expression of syk. A condition or disorder associated with syk may include a “syk-mediated condition or disorder”.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the phrases “a condition or disorder mediated at least in part by syk kinase activity”, and related phrases and terms refer to a condition or disorder characterized by inappropriate, e.g., greater than normal, syk activity. Inappropriate syk functional activity might arise as the result of syk expression in cells which normally do not express syk or increased syk expression or degree of intracellular activation (leading to, e.g., inflammatory and immune-related disorders and conditions). A condition or disorder mediated at least in part by syk kinase activity may be completely or partially mediated by inappropriate syk functional activity. However, a condition or disorder mediated at least in part by syk kinase activity is one in which modulation of syk results in some effect on the underlying condition or disorder (e.g., an syk antagonist results in some improvement in patient well-being in at least some patients).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “inflammation” as used herein refers to infiltration of white blood cells (e.g., leukocytes, monocytes, etc.) into the area being treated for restenosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “intervention” refers to an action that produces an effect or that is intended to alter the course of a disease process. For example, “vascular intervention” refers to the use of an intravascular procedure such as angioplasty or a stent to open an obstructed blood vessel.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “intravascular device” refers to a device useful for a vascular recanalization procedure to restore blood flow through an obstructed blood vessel. Examples of intravascular devices include, without limitation, stents, balloon catheters, autologous venous/arterial grafts, prosthetic venous/arterial grafts, vascular catheters, and vascular shunts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “JAK” refers to a Janus kinase (RefSeq Accession No. P-43408) or a variant thereof that is capable of mediating gene expression in vitro or in vivo. JAK variants include proteins substantially homologous to native JAK, i.e., proteins having one or more naturally or non-naturally occurring amino acid deletions, insertions or substitutions (e.g., JAK derivatives, homologs and fragments). The amino acid sequence of JAK variant preferably is at least about 80% identical to a native JAK, more preferably at least about 90% identical, and most preferably at least about 95% identical.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “leukocyte” refers to any of the various blood cells that have a nucleus and cytoplasm, separate into a thin white layer when whole blood is centrifuged, and help protect the body from infection and disease. Examples of leukocytes include, without limitation, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “mammal” includes, without limitation, humans, domestic animals (e.g., dogs or cats), farm animals (cows, horses, or pigs), monkeys, rabbits, mice, and laboratory animals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “modulate”, “modulation” and the like refer to the ability of a compound to increase or decrease the function and/or expression of syk, where such function may include transcription regulatory activity and/or protein-binding. Modulation may occur in vitro or in vivo. Modulation, as described herein, includes the inhibition, antagonism, partial antagonism, activation, agonism or partial agonism of a function or characteristic associated with syk, either directly or indirectly, and/or the upregulation or downregulation of the expression of syk, either directly or indirectly. In a preferred embodiment, the modulation is direct. Inhibitors or antagonists are compounds that, e.g., bind to, partially or totally block stimulation, decrease, prevent, inhibit, delay activation, inactivate, desensitize, or downregulate signal transduction. Activators or agonists are compounds that, e.g., bind to, stimulate, increase, open, activate, facilitate, enhance activation, activate, sensitize or upregulate signal transduction. The ability of a compound to inhibit the function of syk can be demonstrated in a biochemical assay, e.g., binding assay, or a cell-based assay, e.g., a transient transfection assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Modulators” of activity are used to refer to “ligands”, “antagonists” and “agonists” identified using in vitro and in vivo assays for activity and their homologs and mimetics. Modulators include naturally occurring and synthetic ligands, antagonists, agonists, molecules and the like. Assays to identify antagonists and agonists include, e.g., applying putative modulator compounds to cells, in the presence or absence of a receptor of the invention and then determining the functional effects on a receptor of the invention activity. Samples or assays comprising a receptor of the invention that are treated with a potential activator, inhibitor, or modulator are compared to control samples without the inhibitor, activator, or modulator to examine the extent of effect. Control samples (untreated with modulators) are assigned a relative activity value of 100%. Inhibition is achieved when the activity value of a receptor of the invention relative to the control is about 80%, optionally 50% or 25-1%. Activation is achieved when the activity value of a receptor of the invention relative to the control is 110%, optionally 150%, optionally 200-500%, or 1000-3000% higher.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Patient” refers to human and non-human animals, especially mammals. Examples of patients include, but are not limited to, humans, cows, dogs, cats, goats, sheep, pigs and rabbits.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTurning next to the compositions of the invention, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient” means a carrier or excipient that is useful in preparing a pharmaceutical composition that is generally safe, non-toxic and neither biologically nor otherwise undesirable, and includes a carrier or excipient that is acceptable for veterinary use as well as human pharmaceutical use. A “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient” as used in the specification and claims includes both one and more than one such carrier or excipient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “pharmaceutically effective amount”, “therapeutically effective amount” or “therapeutically effective dose” refers to the amount of the subject compound that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue, system, animal or human that is being sought by the researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician. The term “therapeutically effective amount” includes that amount of a compound that, when administered, is sufficient to prevent development of, or alleviate to some extent, one or more of the symptoms of the condition or disorder being treated. The therapeutically effective amount will vary depending on the compound, the disorder or condition and its severity and the age, weight, etc., of the mammal to be treated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “platelet” refers to a minute, normucleated, disklike cell found in the blood plasma of mammals that functions to promote blood clotting.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “prevent”, “preventing”, “prevention” and grammatical variations thereof as used herein, refers to a method of partially or completely delaying or precluding the onset or recurrence of a disorder or condition and/or one or more of its attendant symptoms or barring a subject from acquiring or reacquiring a disorder or condition or reducing a subject's risk of acquiring or reaquiring a disorder or condition or one or more of its attendant symptoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “recanalization” refers to the process of restoring flow to or reuniting an interrupted channel of the body, such as a blood vessel.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “restenosis” refers to a re-narrowing or blockage of an artery at the same site where treatment, such as an angioplasty or a stent procedure, has been performed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase “selectively” or “specifically” when referring to binding to a receptor, refers to a binding reaction that is determinative of the presence of the receptor, often in a heterogeneous population of receptors and other biologics. Thus, under designated conditions, the compounds bind to a particular receptor at least two times the background and more typically more than 10 to 100 times background. Specific binding of a compound under such conditions requires a compound that is selected for its specificity for a particular receptor. For example, small organic molecules can be screened to obtain only those compounds that specifically or selectively bind to a selected receptor and not with other receptors or proteins. A variety of assay formats may be used to select compounds that are selective for a particular receptor. For example, High-throughput screening assays are routinely used to select compounds that are selective for a particular a receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “Sickle cell anemia” refers to an inherited disorder of the red blood cells in which both hemoglobin alleles encode the sickle hemoglobin (S) protein, i.e., the S/S genotype. The presence of abnormal hemoglobin results in the production of unusually shaped cells, which do not survive the usual length of time in the blood circulation. Thus, anemia results. “Anemia” refers to a decrease in the number of red blood cells and/or hemoglobin in the blood.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “Sickle cell disease” refers to an inherited disorder of the red blood cells in which one hemoglobin allele encodes the sickle hemoglobin (S) protein, and the other allele encodes another unusual hemoglobin protein, such as hemoglobin (S), (C), (D), (E), and (βThal). Examples of sickle cell disease genotypes include, without limitation, the S/S, S/C, S/D, S/E, and S/βThal genotypes. The most common types of sickle cell disease include sickle cell anemia, sickle-hemoglobin C disease, sickle beta-plus thalassemia, and sickle beta-zero thalassemia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe “subject” is defined herein to include animals such as mammals, including, but not limited to, primates (e.g., humans), cows, sheep, goats, horses, dogs, cats, rabbits, rats, mice and the like. In preferred embodiments, the subject is a human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “syk” refers to a spleen tyrosine kinase (RefSeq Accession No. P-043405) or a variant thereof that is capable of mediating a cellular response to T-cell receptors in vitro or in vivo. syk variants include proteins substantially homologous to native syk, i.e., proteins having one or more naturally or non-naturally occurring amino acid deletions, insertions or substitutions (e.g., syk derivatives, homologs and fragments). The amino acid sequence of syk variant preferably is at least about 80% identical to a native syk, more preferably at least about 90% identical, and most preferably at least about 95% identical.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “syk inhibitor” refers to any agent that inhibits the catalytic activity of spleen tyrosine kinase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “thrombosis” refers to the blockage or clotting of a blood vessel caused by a clumping of cells, resulting in the obstruction of blood flow. The term “thrombosis” refers to the clot that is formed within the blood vessel.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “treat”, “treating”, “treatment” and grammatical variations thereof as used herein, includes partially or completely delaying, alleviating, mitigating or reducing the intensity of one or more attendant symptoms of a disorder or condition and/or alleviating, mitigating or impeding one or more causes of a disorder or condition. Treatments according to the invention may be applied preventively, prophylactically, pallatively or remedially.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “vessel” refers to any channel for carrying a fluid, such as an artery or vein.

Methods of Synthesis\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention may be prepared by known organic synthesis techniques, including the methods described in more detail in the Examples. In general, the compounds of structure (I) above may be made by the following \nFIG. 3\n, wherein all substituents are as defined above unless indicated otherwise.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds having formula I may be prepared according to \nFIG. 3\n. Carboxylic acid 1.1 is converted to acid chloride 1.2 via a one-step procedure by treatment with a chlorination agent, such as thionyl chloride, and esterification with an alcohol, such as ethanol, to form compound 1.3 using conditions similar to that described below. Ester 1.3 is dichlorinated with a chlorinating agent, such as phosphorous oxychloride. Selective displacement of the 4-chloro group of the 2,4-dichloropyrimidine by an appropriate amine, such as E\n1\n-D\n1\n-NH\n2 \n(available commercially or synthesized using methods known to those skilled in the art), under basic conditions, such as with diisopropylamine (DIA), provides compounds of formula 1.5. Subsequent hydrolysis of the ester, displacement of the second chloro group with EDC and treatment with ammonia gives compound 1.7. Benzotriazolyl ether compound 1.7 may also be prepared through a linear route. Displacement of the benzotriazolyl ether group with an appropriate amine, such as Y\n1\n—NH\n2 \n(available commercially or synthesized using methods known to those skilled in the art), gives the desired product I, wherein E\n1\n-D\n1 \nand Y\n1 \nare as previously defined.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne skilled in the art will recognize that in certain embodiments of structure (I) when E\n1\n-D\n1 \nor Y\n1 \ncomprises a terminal heteroatom, it may be advantageous to use a protecting group strategy. The protecting group can be removed using methods known to those skilled in the art to yield compounds of structure (1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention may generally be utilized as the free base. Alternatively, the compounds of this invention may be used in the form of acid addition salts as described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nc. Inhibition of syk Kinase\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe activity of a specified compound as an inhibitor of a syk kinase may be assessed in vitro or in vivo. In some embodiments, the activity of a specified compound can be tested in a cellular assay. Selectivity could also be ascertained in biochemical assays with isolated kinases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilar types of assays can be used to assess JAK kinase inhibitory activity and to determine the degree of selectivity of the particular compound as compared to syk kinase. One means of assaying for such inhibition is detection of the effect of the compounds of the present invention on the upregulation of downstream gene products. In the Ramos/IL4 assay, B-cells are stimulated with the cytokine Interleukin-4 (IL-4) leading to the activation of the JAK/Stat pathway through phosphorylation of the JAK family kinases, JAK1 and JAK3, which in turn phosphorylate and activate the transcription factor Stat-6. One of the genes upregulated by activated Stat-6 is the low affinity IgE receptor, CD23. To study the effect of inhibitors (e.g., the 2,4-substituted pyrimindinediamine compounds described herein) on the JAK1 and JAK3 kinases, human Ramos B-cells are stimulated with human IL-4. 10′ post-stimulation, cells are subjected to intracellular flow cytometry to measure the extent of STAT-6 phosphorylation. 20 to 24 hours post-stimulation, cells are stained for upregulation of CD23 and analyzed using flow cytometry. A reduction of the amount of phosphohorylated STAT-6 and/or cell surface CD23 present compared to control conditions indicates that the test compound actively inhibits the JAK kinase pathway.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, IL-6 stimulation of Ramos B-cells induces \n \nJAKs\n \n 1, 2, and Tyk2, leading to Stat-3 and Erk phosphorylation. 10′ post-stimulation, cells are subjected to intracellular flow cytometry to measure the ability of compound to inhibit these phosphorylation events. To specifically measure the activity of JAK2, the CellSensor irfl-bla HEL cell line expressing the beta-lactamase reporter gene controlled by Stat5 will be used (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). These cells express a constituitively active JAK2 mutant (JAK2V617F), found naturally in myeloproliferative neoplasms (Constantinescu, S., et. al, \nTrends Biochem. Sci., \n2008; 33:122-31). A reduction in the amount of beta-lactamase reporter gene expression is used a measure of the JAK2 inhibitory activity of compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe activity of the compounds of the invention may additionally be characterized by assaying the effect of the compounds of the present invention described herein on A549 lung epithelial cells and U937 cells. A549 lung epithelial cells and U937 cells up-regulate ICAM-1 (CD54) surface expression in response to a variety of different stimuli. Therefore, using ICAM-1 expression as readout, test compound effects on different signaling pathways can be assessed in the same cell type. Stimulation with IL-1β through the IL-1 β receptor activates the TRAF6/NFκB pathway resulting in up-regulation of ICAM-1. IFN.gamma. induces ICAM-1 up-regulation through activation of the JAK1/JAK2 pathway. The up-regulation of ICAM-1 can be quantified by flow cytometry across a compound dose curve and EC\n50 \nvalues are calculated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe activity of the compounds of the invention may additionally be characterized by assaying the effect of the compounds of the present invention described herein on A549 lung epithelial cells and U937 cells.

Exemplary assays of this type are described in greater detail in the Examples.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nActive compounds as described herein generally inhibit the JAK kinase pathway with an IC\n50 \nin the range of about 1 mM or less, as measured in the assays described herein. Of course, skilled artisans will appreciate that compounds which exhibit lower IC\n50\ns, (on the order, for example, of 100 μM, 75 μM, 50 μM, 40 μM, 30 μM, 20 μM, 15 μM, 10 μM, 5 μM, 1 μM, 500 nM, 100 nM, 10 nM, 1 nM, or even lower) can be particularly useful in therapeutic applications. In instances where activity specific to a particular cell type is desired, the compound can be assayed for activity with the desired cell type and counter-screened for a lack of activity against other cell types. The desired degree of “inactivity” in such counter screens, or the desired ratio of activity vs. inactivity, may vary for different situations and can be selected by the user.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe active compounds also typically inhibit IL-4 stimulated expression of CD23 in B-cells with an IC\n50 \nin the range of about 20 μM or less, typically in the range of about 10 μM, 1 μM, 500 nM, 100 nM, 10 nM, 1 nM, or even lower. A suitable assay that can be used is the assay described in the Examples, “Assay for Ramos B-cell Line Stimulated with IL-4.” In certain embodiments, the active compounds of the present invention have an IC\n50 \nof less than or equal to 5 μM, greater than 5 μM but less than 20 μM, greater than 20 μM, or greater than 20 μM but less than 50 μM in the assay described in the Examples.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe active compounds also typically inhibit expression of ICAMI (CD54) induced by IFN.gamma. exposure in U937 or A549 cells with an IC\n50 \nin the range of about 20 μM or less, typically in the range of about 10 μM, 1 μM, 500 nM, 100 nM, 10 nM, 1 nM, or even lower. The IC\n50 \nagainst expression of ICAM (CD54) in IFN.gamma. stimulated cells can be determined in a functional cellular assay with an isolated A549 or U937 cell line. Suitable assays that can be used are the assays described in the Examples, “A549 Epithelial Line Stimulated with IFNγ” and “U937 IFN.gamma. ICAM1 FACS Assay,” respectively. In certain embodiments, the active compounds of the present invention have an IC\n50 \nof less than or equal to 20 μM, greater than 20 μM, or greater than 20 μM but less than 50 μM in the assays described in the Examples.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nd.

Water or oil-soluble or dispersible products are thereby obtained.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds utilized in the compositions and methods of this invention may also be modified by appending appropriate functionalities to enhance selective biological properties. Such modifications are known in the art and include those which increase biological penetration into a given biological system (e.g., blood, lymphatic system, central nervous system, etc.), increase oral availability, increase solubility to allow administration by injection, alter metabolism and alter rate of excretion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be manufactured by methods well known in the art such as conventional granulating, mixing, dissolving, encapsulating, lyophilizing, or emulsifying processes, among others. Compositions may be produced in various forms, including granules, precipitates, or particulates, powders, including freeze dried, rotary dried or spray dried powders, amorphous powders, tablets, capsules, syrup, suppositories, injections, emulsions, elixirs, suspensions or solutions. Formulations may optionally contain stabilizers, pH modifiers, surfactants, bioavailability modifiers and combinations of these.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “unit dosage form” refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of drug calculated to produce the desired onset, tolerability, and/or therapeutic effects, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient (e.g., an ampoule). In addition, more concentrated compositions may be prepared, from which the more dilute unit dosage compositions may then be produced. The more concentrated compositions thus will contain substantially more than, e.g., at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more times the amount of one or more syk inhibitors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for preparing such dosage forms are known to those skilled in the art (see, for example, \nREMINGTON'S PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES, \n18\nTH \nE\nD\n., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa. (1990)). In addition, pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the syk inhibitors of the present invention (e.g., acid addition salts) may be prepared and included in the compositions using standard procedures known to those skilled in the art of synthetic organic chemistry and described, e.g., by J. March, Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms and Structure, 4\nth \nEd. (New York: Wiley-Interscience, 1992).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions typically include a conventional pharmaceutical carrier or excipient and may additionally include other medicinal agents, carriers, adjuvants, diluents, tissue permeation enhancers, solubilizers, and the like. Preferably, the composition will contain about 0.01% to about 90%, preferably about 0.1% to about 75%, more preferably about 0.1% to 50%, still more preferably about 0.1% to 10% by weight of one or more syk inhibitors, with the remainder consisting of suitable pharmaceutical carrier and/or excipients. Appropriate excipients can be tailored to the particular composition and route of administration by methods well known in the art, e.g., \nREMINGTON'S PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES\n, supra.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutically acceptable carriers that may be used in these compositions include ion exchangers, alumina, aluminum stearate, lecithin, serum proteins, such as human serum albumin, buffer substances, such as phosphates, glycine, sorbic acid, potassium sorbate, partial glyceride mixtures of saturated vegetable fatty acids, water, salts or electrolytes, such as protamine sulfate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, potassium hydrogen phosphate, sodium chloride, zinc salts, colloidal silica, magnesium trisilicate, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, cellulose-based substances, polyethylene glycol, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, polyacrylates, waxes, polyethylene-polyoxypropylene-block polymers, polyethylene glycol and wool fat.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of suitable excipients include, but are not limited to, lactose, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, mannitol, starches, gum acacia, calcium phosphate, alginates, tragacanth, gelatin, calcium silicate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose, water, saline, syrup, methylcellulose, ethylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, and polyacrylic acids such as Carbopols. The compositions can additionally include lubricating agents such as talc, magnesium stearate, and mineral oil; wetting agents; emulsifying agents; suspending agents; preserving agents such as methyl-, ethyl-, and propyl-hydroxy-benzoates; pH adjusting agents such as inorganic and organic acids and bases; sweetening agents; and flavoring agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdministration of a composition comprising one or more syk inhibitors with one or more suitable pharmaceutical excipients as advantageous can be carried out via any of the accepted modes of administration. Thus, administration can be, for example, oral, topical, intravenous, subcutaneous, transcutaneous, transdermal, intramuscular, intra-joint, parenteral, intra-arteriole, intradermal, intraventricular, intracranial, intraperitoneal, intralesional, intranasal, rectal, vaginal, by inhalation or via an implanted reservoir. The term “parenteral” as used herein includes subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intra-articular, intra-synovial, intrasternal, intrathecal, intrahepatic, intralesional and intracranial injection or infusion techniques. Preferably, the compositions are administered orally or intravenously. The formulations of the invention may be designed as short-acting, fast-releasing, or long-acting. Still further, compounds can be administered in a local rather than systemic means, such as administration (e.g., injection) as a sustained release formulation. According to a representative embodiment, the compositions of this invention are formulated for pharmaceutical administration to a mammal, preferably a human being.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions of the present invention containing one or more syk inhibitors can be administered repeatedly, e.g., at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or more times, or the composition may be administered by continuous infusion. Suitable sites of administration include, but are not limited to, skin, bronchial, gastrointestinal, anal, vaginal, eye, and ear. The formulations may take the form of solid, semi-solid, lyophilized powder, or liquid dosage forms, such as, for example, tablets, pills, capsules, powders, solutions, suspensions, emulsions, suppositories, retention enemas, creams, ointments, lotions, gels, aerosols, or the like, preferably in unit dosage forms suitable for simple administration of precise dosages.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be in any orally acceptable dosage form, including tablets, capsules, cachets, emulsions, suspensions, solutions, syrups, elixirs, sprays, boluses, lozenges, powders, granules, and sustained-release formulations. Suitable excipients for oral administration include pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharine, talcum, cellulose, glucose, gelatin, sucrose, magnesium carbonate, and the like. In the case of tablets for oral use, carriers that are commonly used include lactose and corn starch. Lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, are also typically added. For a capsule form, useful diluents include lactose and dried cornstarch. When aqueous suspensions are required for oral use, the active ingredient is combined with emulsifying and suspending agents. If desired, certain sweetening, flavoring or coloring agents may also be added.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the compositions take the form of a pill, tablet, or capsule, and thus, the composition can contain, along with one or more syk inhibitors, a diluent such as lactose, sucrose, dicalcium phosphate, and the like; a disintegrant such as starch or derivatives thereof; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate and the like; and/or a binder such a starch, gum acacia, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gelatin, cellulose and derivatives thereof. A tablet can be made by any compression or molding process known to those of skill in the art. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the syk inhibitors in a free-flowing form, e.g., a powder or granules, optionally mixed with accessory ingredients, e.g., binders, lubricants, diluents, disintegrants, or dispersing agents. Molded tablets can be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered syk inhibitors with any suitable carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be in the form of suppositories for rectal administration. These may be prepared by mixing the agent with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at room temperature but liquid at rectal temperature and therefore will melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials include cocoa butter, beeswax, polyethylene glycol (PEG), hard fat, and/or hydrogenated cocoglyceride. Compositions suitable for rectal administration may also comprise a rectal enema unit containing one or more syk inhibitors and pharmaceutically-acceptable vehicles (e.g., 50% aqueous ethanol or an aqueous salt solution) that are physiologically compatible with the rectum and/or colon. The rectal enema unit contains an applicator tip protected by an inert cover, preferably comprised of polyethylene, lubricated with a lubricant such as white petrolatum, and preferably protected by a one-way valve to prevent back-flow of the dispensed formula. The rectal enema unit is also of sufficient length, preferably two inches, to be inserted into the colon via the anus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiquid compositions can be prepared by dissolving or dispersing one or more syk inhibitors and optionally one or more pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvants in a carrier such as, for example, aqueous saline, aqueous dextrose, glycerol, ethanol, and the like, to form a solution or suspension, e.g., for oral, topical, or intravenous administration. Pharmaceutical formulations may be prepared as liquid suspensions or solutions using a sterile liquid, such as oil, water, alcohol, and combinations thereof. Pharmaceutically suitable surfactants, suspending agents or emulsifying agents, may be added for oral or parenteral administration. Suspensions may include oils, such as peanut oil, sesame oil, cottonseed oil, corn oil and olive oil. Suspension preparation may also contain esters of fatty acids, such as ethyl oleate, isopropyl myristate, fatty acid glycerides and acetylated fatty acid glycerides. Suspension formulations may include alcohols, such as ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, hexadecyl alcohol, glycerol and propylene glycol. Ethers, such as poly(ethyleneglycol), petroleum hydrocarbons, such as mineral oil and petrolatum, and water may also be used in suspension formulations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may also be in a topical form, especially when the target of treatment includes areas or organs readily accessible by topical application, including diseases of the eye, the skin, or the lower intestinal tract. Suitable topical formulations are readily prepared for each of these areas or organs. For topical administration, the composition containing one or more syk inhibitors can be in the form of emulsions, lotions, gels, foams, creams, jellies, solutions, suspensions, ointments, and transdermal patches.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTopical application for the lower intestinal tract may be effected in a rectal suppository formulation (see above) or in a suitable enema formulation. Topically-transdermal patches may also be used. For topical applications, the pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated in a suitable ointment containing the active component suspended or dissolved in one or more carriers. Carriers for topical administration of the compounds of this invention include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, liquid petrolatum, white petrolatum, propylene glycol, polyoxyethylene, polyoxypropylene compound, emulsifying wax and water. Alternatively, the pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated in a suitable lotion or cream containing the active components suspended or dissolved in one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. Suitable carriers include mineral oil, sorbitan monostearate, \npolysorbate\n 60, cetyl esters, wax, cetyl alcohol, 2-octyldodecanol, benzyl alcohol and water.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may also be administered by nasal aerosol or inhalation. For delivery by inhalation, the compositions can be delivered as a dry powder or in liquid form via a nebulizer. Such compositions are prepared according to techniques known in the art of pharmaceutical formulation and may be prepared as solutions in saline, employing benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives, absorption promoters to enhance bioavailability, fluorocarbons and/or other conventional solubilizing or dispersing agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor ophthalmic use, the pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated as micronized suspensions in isotonic, pH adjusted sterile saline, or, preferably, as solutions in isotonic, pH adjusted sterile saline, either with our without a preservative, such as benzylalkonium chloride. Alternatively, for ophthalmic uses, the pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated in an ointment, such as petrolatum.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor parenteral administration, the compositions can be in the form of sterile injectable solutions and sterile packaged powders. Preferably, injectable solutions are formulated at a pH of about 4.5 to about 7.5.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSterile injectable forms of the compositions of this invention may be aqueous or oleaginous suspension. These suspensions may be formulated according to techniques known in the art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose, any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or di-glycerides. Fatty acids, such as oleic acid and its glyceride derivatives are useful in the preparation of injectables, as are natural pharmaceutically-acceptable oils, such as olive oil or castor oil, especially in their polyoxyethylated versions. These oil solutions or suspensions may also contain a long-chain alcohol diluent or dispersant, such as carboxymethyl cellulose or similar dispersing agents which are commonly used in the formulation of pharmaceutically acceptable dosage forms including emulsions and suspensions. Other commonly used surfactants, such as Tweens, Spans and other emulsifying agents or bioavailability enhancers which are commonly used in the manufacture of pharmaceutically acceptable solid, liquid, or other dosage forms may also be used for the purposes of formulation. Compounds may be formulated for parenteral administration by injection such as by bolus injection or continuous infusion. A unit dosage form for injection may be in ampoules or in multi-dose containers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions of the present invention can also be provided in a lyophilized form. Such compositions may include a buffer, e.g., bicarbonate, for reconstitution prior to administration, or the buffer may be included in the lyophilized composition for reconstitution with, e.g., water. The lyophilized composition may further comprise a suitable vasoconstrictor, e.g., epinephrine. The lyophilized composition can be provided in a syringe, optionally packaged in combination with the buffer for reconstitution, such that the reconstituted composition can be immediately administered to a patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny of the above dosage forms containing effective amounts are within the bounds of routine experimentation and within the scope of the invention. A therapeutically effective dose may vary depending upon the route of administration and dosage form. The representative compound or compounds of the invention is a formulation that exhibits a high therapeutic index. The therapeutic index is the dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects which can be expressed as the ratio between LD\n50 \nand ED\n50\n. The LD\n50 \nis the dose lethal to 50% of the population and the ED\n50 \nis the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population. The LD\n50 \nand ED\n50 \nare determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in animal cell cultures or experimental animals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBesides those representative dosage forms described above, pharmaceutically acceptable excipients and carriers and dosage forms are generally known to those skilled in the art and are included in the invention. It should be understood that a specific dosage and treatment regimen for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors, including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient, and the time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, judgment of the treating physician and severity of the particular disease being treated. The amount of active ingredient(s) will also depend upon the particular compound and other therapeutic agent, if present, in the composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \ne. Methods of Use\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention provides methods of inhibiting or decreasing syk activity as well as treating or ameliorating a syk associated state, symptom, condition, disorder or disease in a patient in need thereof (e.g., human or non-human). In one embodiment, the syk associated state, symptom, condition, disorder or disease is mediated, at least in part by syk kinase activity. In more specific embodiments, the present invention provides a method for treating a condition or disorder mediated at least in part by syk kinase activity is cardiovascular disease, inflammatory disease or autoimmune disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the invention provides methods for preventing or treating a condition in a mammal characterized by undesired thrombosis comprising the step of administering to the mammal a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the present invention. Such conditions include, but are not limited, to restenosis, acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, refractory angina, occlusive coronary thrombosis occurring post-thrombolytic therapy or post-coronary angioplasty, a thrombotically mediated cerebrovascular syndrome, embolic stroke, thrombotic stroke, transient ischemic attacks, venous thrombosis, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, coagulopathy, disseminated intravascular coagulation, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, thromboangiitis obliterans, thrombotic disease associated with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, thrombotic complications associated with extracorporeal circulation, thrombotic complications associated with instrumentation such as cardiac or other intravascular catheterization, intra-aortic balloon pump, coronary stent or cardiac valve, conditions requiring the fitting of prosthetic devices, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment, the present invention provides a method for treating thrombosis, immune thrombocytic purura, heparin induced thrombocytopenia, dilated cardiomypathy, sickle cell disease, atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, vacular inflammation, unstable angina or acute coronary syndromes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the present invention also provides a method for treating allergy, asthma, theumatoid arthritis, B Cell mediated disease such as Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, anti phospholipids syndrome, lupus, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, end stage renal disease or chronic lymphocytic leukemia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for treating hemolytic anemia or immune thrombocytopenic purpura.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds described herein are also potent and/or selective inhibitors of JAK kinases. As a consequence of this activity, the compounds can be used in a variety of in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo contexts to regulate or inhibit JAK kinase activity, signaling cascades in which JAK kinases play a role, and the biological responses effected by such signaling cascades. For example, in one embodiment, the compounds can be used to inhibit JAK kinase, either in vitro or in vivo, in virtually any cell type expressing the JAK kinase, such as in hematopoietic cells in which, for example, JAK3 is predominantly expressed. They may also be used to regulate signal transduction cascades in which JAK kinases, particularly JAK3, play a role. Such JAK-dependent signal transduction cascades include, but are not limited to, the signaling cascades of cytokine receptors that involve the common gamma chain, such as, for example, the IL-4, IL-7, IL-5, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21, or IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21 receptor signaling cascades. The compounds may also be used in vitro or in vivo to regulate, and in particular to inhibit, cellular or biological responses affected by such JAK-dependent signal transduction cascades. Such cellular or biological responses include, but are not limited to, IL-4/ramos CD23 upregulation and IL-2 mediated T-cell proliferation. Importantly, the compounds can be used to inhibit JAK kinases in vivo as a therapeutic approach towards the treatment or prevention of diseases mediated, either wholly or in part, by a JAK kinase activity (referred to herein as “JAK kinase mediated diseases”). Non-limiting examples of JAK kinase mediated diseases that can be treated or prevented with the compounds include, but are not limited to, the following: allergies; asthma; autoimmune diseases such as transplant rejection (e.g., kidney, heart, lung, liver, pancreas, skin, small intestine, large intestine, host versus graft reaction (HVGR), and graft versus host reaction (GVHR)), rheumatoid arthritis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; T-cell mediated autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, psoraiasis, and Sjogren's syndrome; Type II inflammatory diseases such as vascular inflammation (including vasculitis, arteritis, atherosclerosis, and coronary artery disease); diseases of the central nervous system such as stroke; pulmonary diseases such as bronchitis obliteraus and primary pulmonary hypertension; solid, delayed Type IV hypersensitivity reactions; and hematologic malignancies such as leukemia and lymphomas.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of diseases that are mediated, at least in part, by JAK kinases that can be treated or prevented according to the methods include, but are not limited to, allergies, asthma, autoimmune diseases such as transplant rejection (e.g., kidney, heart, lung, liver, pancreas, skin, host versus graft reaction (HVGR), etc.), rheumatoid arthritis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, psoraiasis and Sjogren's syndrome, Type II inflammatory disease such as vascular inflammation (including vasculitis, ateritis, atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease) or other inflammatory diseases such as osteoarthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, spastic colon, low grade scarring (e.g., scleroderma, increased fibrosis, keloids, post-surgical scars, pulmonary fibrosis, vascular spasms, migraine, reperfusion injury and post myocardial infarction), and sicca complex or syndrome, diseases of the central nervous system such as stroke, pulmonary diseases such as bronchitis obliterous and primary and primary pulmonary hypertension, delayed or cell-mediated, Type IV hypersensitivity and solid and hematologic malignancies such as leukemias and lyphomas.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, this invention provides a method of inhibiting an activity of a JAK kinase, comprising contacting the JAK kinase with an amount of a compound effective to inhibit an activity of the JAK kinase, wherein the compound is selected from the compounds of this invention. In certain embodiments of the methods described herein, the method is carried out in vivo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, this invention provides a method of inhibiting an activity of a JAK kinase, comprising contacting in vitro a JAK3 kinase with an amount of a compound effective to inhibit an activity of the JAK kinase, wherein the compound is selected from the compounds of this invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a specific embodiment, the compounds can be used to treat and/or prevent rejection in organ and/or tissue transplant recipients (i.e., treat and/or prevent allorgraft rejection). Allografts can be rejected through either a cell-mediated or humoral immune reaction of the recipient against transplant (histocompability) antigens present on the membranes of the donor's cells. The strongest antigens are governed by a complex of genetic loci termed human leukocyte group A (HLA) antigens. Together with the ABO blood groups antigens, they are the chief transplantation antigens detectable in humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRejection following transplantation can generally be broken into three categories: hyperacute, occurring hours to days following transplantation; acute, occurring days to months following transplantation; and chronic, occurring months to years following transplantation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHyperacute rejection is caused mainly by the production of host antibodies that attack the graft tissue. In a hyperacute rejection reaction, antibodies are observed in the transplant vascular very soon after transplantation. Shortly thereafter, vascular clotting occurs, leading to ischemia, eventual necrosis and death. The graft infarction is unresponsive to known immunosuppressive therapies. Because HLA antigens can be identified in vitro, pre-transplant screening is used to significantly reduce hyperacute rejection. As a consequence of this screening, hyperacute rejection is relatively uncommon today.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAcute rejection is thought to be mediated by the accumulation of antigen specific cells in the graft tissue. The T-cell-mediated immune reaction against these antigens (i.e., HVGR or GVHR) is the principle mechanism of acute rejection. Accumulation of these cells leads to damage of the graft tissue. It is believed that both CD4+ helper T-cells and CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells are involved in the process and that the antigen is presented by donor and host dendritic cells. The CD4+ helper T-cells help recruit other effector cells, such as macrophapges and eosinophils, to the graft. Accessing T-cell activation signal transduction cascades (for example, CD28, CD40L, and CD2 cascades) are also involved.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cell-mediated acute rejection can be reversed in many cases by intensifying immunotherapy. After successful reversal, severely damaged elements of the graft heal by fibrosis and the remainder of the graft appears normal. After resolution of acute rejection, dosages of immunosuppressive drugs can be reduced to very low levels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChronic rejection, which is a particular problem in renal transplants, often progresses insidiously despite increased immunosuppressive therapy. It is thought to be due, in large part, to cell-mediated Type IV hypersensitivity. The pathologic profile differs from that of acute rejection. The arterial endothelium is primarily involved with extensive proliferation that may gradually occlude the vessel lumen, leading to ischemia, fibrosis, a thickened intima, and atherosclerotic changes. Chronic rejection is mainly due to a progressive obliteration of graft vasculature and resembles a slow, vasculitic process.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn Type IV hypersensitivity, CD8 cytotoxic T-cells and CD4 helper T cells recognize either intracellular or extracellular synthesized antigen when it is complexed, respectively, with either Class I or Class II MHC molecules. Macrophages function as antigen-presenting cells and release IL-1, which promotes proliferation of helper T-cells. Helper T-cells release interferon gamma and IL-2, which together regulate delayed hyperactivity reactions mediated by macrophage activation and immunity mediated by T cells. In the case of organ transplant, the cytotoxic T-cells destroy the graft cells on contact.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSince JAK kinases play a critical role in the activation of T-cells, the compounds described herein can be used to treat and/or prevent many aspects of transplant rejection, and are particularly useful in the treatment and/or prevention of rejection reactions that are mediated, at least in part, by T-cells, such as HVGR or GVHR. The compounds can also be used to treat and/or prevent chronic rejection in transplant recipients and, in particular, in renal transplant recipients. The compound can also be administered to a tissue or an organ prior to transplanting the tissue or organ in the transplant recipient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, this invention provides a method of treating a T-cell mediated autoimmune disease, comprising administering to a patient suffering from such an autoimmune disease an amount of a compound effective to treat the autoimmune disease wherein the compound is selected from the compounds of the invention. In certain embodiments of the methods the autoimmune disease is multiple sclerosis (MS), psoraisis, or Sjogran's syndrome. Such autoimmune disease include, but are not limited to, those autoimmune diseases that are frequently designated as single organ or single cell-type autoimmune disorders and those autoimmune disease that are frequently designated as involving systemic autoimmune disorder. Non-limiting examples of diseases frequently designated as single organ or single cell-type autoimmune disorders include: Hashimoto's thyroiditis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, autoimmune atrophic gastritis of pernicious anemia, autoimmune encephalomyelitis, autoimmune orchitis, Goodpasture's disease, autoimmune thrombocytopenia, sympathetic ophthalmia, myasthenia gravis, Graves' disease, primary biliary cirrhosis, chronic aggressive hepatitis, ulcerative colitis and membranous glomerulopathy. Non-limiting examples of diseases often designated as involving systemic autoimmune disorder include: systemic lupus erythematosis, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome, Reiter's syndrome, polymyositis-dermatomyositis, systemic sclerosis, polyarteritis nodosa, multiple sclerosis and bullous pemphigoid. Additional autoimmune diseases, which can be .beta.-cell (humoral) based or T-cell based, include Cogan's syndrome, ankylosing spondylitis, Wegener's granulomatosis, autoimmune alopecia, Type I or juvenile onset diabetes, and thyroiditis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe types of autoimmune diseases that may be treated or prevented with such prodrugs generally include those disorders involving tissue injury that occurs as a result of a humoral and/or cell-mediated response to immunogens or antigens of endogenous and/or exogenous origin. Such diseases are frequently referred to as diseases involving the nonanaphylactic (i.e., Type II, Type III and/or Type IV) hypersensitivity reactions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nType I hypersensitivity reactions generally result from the release of pharmacologically active substances, such as histamine, from mast and/or basophil cells following contact with a specific exogenous antigen. As mentioned above, such Type I reactions play a role in numerous diseases, including allergic asthma, allergic rhinitis, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nType II hypersensitivity reactions (also referred to as cytotoxic, cytolytic complement-dependent or cell-stimulating hypersensitivity reactions) result when immunoglobulins react with antigenic components of cells or tissue, or with an antigen or hapten that has become intimately coupled to cells or tissue. Diseases that are commonly associated with Type II hypersensitivity reactions include, but are not limited, to autoimmune hemolytic anemia, erythroblastosis fetalis and Goodpasture's disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nType III hypersensitivity reactions, (also referred to as toxic complex, soluble complex, or immune complex hypersensitivity reactions) result from the deposition of soluble circulating antigen-immunoglobulin complexes in vessels or in tissues, with accompanying acute inflammatory reactions at the site of immune complex deposition. Non-limiting examples of prototypical Type III reaction diseases include the Arthus reaction, rheumatoid arthritis, serum sickness, systemic lupus erythematosis, certain types of glomerulonephritis, multiple sclerosis and bullous pemphingoid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nType IV hypersensitivity reactions (frequently called cellular, cell-mediated, delayed, or tuberculin-type hypersensitivity reactions) are caused by sensitized T-lymphocytes which result from contact with a specific antigen. Non-limiting examples of diseases cited as involving Type IV reactions are contact dermatitis and allograft rejection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAutoimmune diseases associated with any of the above nonanaphylactic hypersensitivity reactions may be treated or prevented with the prodrugs according to structural formulae (I) and (Ia). In particular, the methods may be used to treat or prevent those autoimmune diseases frequently characterized as single organ or single cell-type autoimmune disorders including, but not limited to: Hashimoto's thyroiditis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, autoimmune atrophic gastritis of pernicious anemia, autoimmune encephalomyelitis, autoimmune orchitis, Goodpasture's disease, autoimmune thrombocytopenia, sympathetic ophthalmia, myasthenia gravis, Graves' disease, primary biliary cirrhosis, chronic aggressive hepatitis, ulcerative colitis and membranous glomerulopathy, as well as those autoimmune diseases frequently characterized as involving systemic autoimmune disorder, which include but are not limited to: systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome, Reiter's syndrome, polymyositis-dermatomyositis, systemic sclerosis, polyarteritis nodosa, multiple sclerosis and bullous pemphigoid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be appreciated by skilled artisans that many of the above-listed autoimmune diseases are associated with severe symptoms, the amelioration of which provides significant therapeutic benefit even in instances where the underlying autoimmune disease may not be ameliorated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherapy using the compounds described herein can be applied alone, or it can be applied in combination with or adjunctive to other common immunosuppressive therapies, such as, for example, the following: mercaptopurine; corticosteroids such as prednisone; methylprednisolone and prednisolone; alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide; calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclosporine, sirolimus, and tacrolimus; inhibitors of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) such as mycophenolate, mycophenolate mofetil, and azathioprine; and agents designed to suppress cellular immunity while leaving the recipient's humoral immunologic response intact, including various antibodies (for example, antilymphocyte globulin (ALG), antithymocyte globulin (ATG), monoclonal anti-T-cell antibodies (OKT3)) and irradiation. These various agents can be used in accordance with their standard or common dosages, as specified in the prescribing information accompanying commercially available forms of the drugs (see also: the prescribing information in the 2006 Edition of The Physician's Desk Reference), the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Azathioprine is currently available from Salix Pharmaceuticals, Inc., under the brand name AZASAN; mercaptopurine is currently available from Gate Pharmaceuticals, Inc., under the brand name PURINETHOL; prednisone and prednisolone are currently available from Roxane Laboratories, Inc.; Methyl prednisolone is currently available from Pfizer; sirolimus (rapamycin) is currently available from Wyeth-Ayerst under the brand name RAPAMUNE; tacrolimus is currently available from Fujisawa under the brand name PROGRAF; cyclosporine is current available from Novartis under the brand dame SANDIMMUNE and from Abbott under the brand name GENGRAF; IMPDH inhibitors such as mycophenolate mofetil and mycophenolic acid are currently available from Roche under the brand name CELLCEPT and from Novartis under the brand name MYFORTIC; azathioprine is currently available from Glaxo Smith Kline under the brand name IMURAN; and antibodies are currently available from Ortho Biotech under the brand name QRTHOCLONE, from Novartis under the brand name SIMULECT (basiliximab), and from Roche under the brand name ZENAPAX (daclizumab).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the compounds could be administered either in combination or adjunctively with an inhibitor of a syk kinase. syk kinase is a tyrosine kinase known to play a critical role in Fcy receptor signaling, as well as in other signaling cascades, such as those involving B-cell receptor signaling (Turner et al., (2000), Immunology Today 21:148-154) and integrins beta (1), beta (2), and beta (3) in neutrophils (Mocsai et al., (2002), Immunity 16:547-558). For example, syk kinase plays a pivotal role in high affinity IgE receptor signaling in mast cells that leads to activation and subsequent release of multiple chemical mediators that trigger allergic attacks. However, unlike the JAK kinases, which help regulate the pathways involved in delayed or cell-mediated Type IV hypersensitivity reactions, syk kinase helps regulate the pathways involved in immediate IgE-mediated, Type I hypersensitivity reactions. Certain compounds that affect the syk pathway may or may not also affect the JAK pathways.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable syk inhibitory compounds are described, for example, in Ser.

The activity of a specified compound as an inhibitor of a syk kinase can be assessed in vitro or in vivo. In some embodiments, the activity of a specified compound can be tested in a cellular assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Cell proliferative disorder” refers to a disorder characterized by abnormal proliferation of cells. A proliferative disorder does not imply any limitation with respect to the rate of cell growth, but merely indicates loss of normal controls that affect growth and cell division. Thus, in some embodiments, cells of a proliferative disorder can have the same cell division rates as normal cells but do not respond to signals that limit such growth. Within the ambit of “cell proliferative disorder” is neoplasm or tumor, which is an abnormal growth of tissue. Cancer refers to any of various malignant neoplasms characterized by the proliferation of cells that have the capability to invade surrounding tissue and/or metastasize to new colonization sites.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, cell proliferative disorders treatable with the compounds disclosed herein relate to any disorder characterized by aberrant cell proliferation. These include various tumors and cancers, benign or malignant, metastatic or non-metastatic. Specific properties of cancers, such as tissue invasiveness or metastasis, can be targeted using the methods described herein. Cell proliferative disorders include a variety of cancers, including, among others, ovarian cancer, renal cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, kidney cancer, bladder cancer, pancreatic cancer, lung squamous carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the cell proliferative disorder treated is a hematopoietic neoplasm, which is aberrant growth of cells of the hematopoietic system. Hematopoietic malignancies can have its origins in pluripotent stem cells, multipotent progenitor cells, oligopotent committed progenitor cells, precursor cells, and terminally differentiated cells involved in hematopoiesis. Some hematological malignancies are believed to arise from hematopoietic stem cells, which have the ability for self renewal. For instance, cells capable of developing specific subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Cynthia K. Hahn, Kenneth N. Ross, Rose M. Kakoza, Steven Karr, Jinyan Du, Shao-E Ong, Todd R. Golub, Kimberly Stegmaier, Syk is a new target for AML differentiation, Blood, 2007, 110, Abstract 209) upon transplantation display the cell surface markers of hematopoietic stem cells, implicating hematopoietic stem cells as the source of leukemic cells. Blast cells that do not have a cell marker characteristic of hematopoietic stem cells appear to be incapable of establishing tumors upon transplantation (Blaire et al., 1997, Blood 89:3104-3112). The stem cell origin of certain hematological malignancies also finds support in the observation that specific chromosomal abnormalities associated with particular types of leukemia can be found in normal cells of hematopoietic lineage as well as leukemic blast cells. For instance, the reciprocal translocation t(9q34;22q11) associated with approximately 95% of chronic myelogenous leukemia appears to be present in cells of the myeloid, erythroid, and lymphoid lineage, suggesting that the chromosomal aberration originates in hematopoietic stem cells. A subgroup of cells in certain types of CML displays the cell marker phenotype of hematopoietic stem cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough hematopoietic neoplasms often originate from stem cells, committed progenitor cells or more terminally differentiated cells of a developmental lineage can also be the source of some leukemias. For example, forced expression of the fusion protein Bcr/Abl (associated with chronic myelogenous leukemia) in common myeloid progenitor or granulocyte/macrophage progenitor cells produces a leukemic-like condition. Moreover, some chromosomal aberrations associated with subtypes of leukemia are not found in the cell population with a marker phenotype of hematopoietic stem cells, but are found in a cell population displaying markers of a more differentiated state of the hematopoietic pathway (Turhan et al., 1995, Blood 85:2154-2161). Thus, while committed progenitor cells and other differentiated cells may have only a limited potential for cell division, leukemic cells may have acquired the ability to grow unregulated, in some instances mimicking the self-renewal characteristics of hematopoietic stem cells (Passegue et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 2003, 100:11842-9).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the hematopoietic neoplasm treated is a lymphoid neoplasm, where the abnormal cells are derived from and/or display the characteristic phenotype of cells of the lymphoid lineage. Lymphoid neoplasms can be subdivided into B-cell neoplasms, T and NK-cell neoplasms, and Hodgkin's lymphoma. B-cell neoplasms can be further subdivided into precursor B-cell neoplasm and mature/peripheral B-cell neoplasm. Exemplary B-cell neoplasms are precursor B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia) while exemplary mature/peripheral B-cell neoplasms are B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, splenic marginal zone B-cell lymphoma, hairy cell leukemia, plasma cell myeloma/plasmacytoma, extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of MALT type, nodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, mantle-cell lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, primary effusion lymphoma, and Burkitt's lymphoma/Burkitt cell leukemia. T-cell and Nk-cell neoplasms are further subdivided into precursor T-cell neoplasm and mature (peripheral) T-cell neoplasms. Exemplary precursor T-cell neoplasm is precursor T-lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia (precursor T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia) while exemplary mature (peripheral) T-cell neoplasms are T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia T-cell granular lymphocytic leukemia, aggressive NK-cell leukemia, adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia (HTLV-1), extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type, enteropathy-type T-cell lymphoma, hepatosplenic gamma-delta T-cell lymphoma, subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma, Mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome, Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma, T/null cell, primary cutaneous type, Peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise characterized, Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma, T/null cell, primary systemic type. The third member of lymphoid neoplasms is Hodgkin's lymphoma, also referred to as Hodgkin's disease. Exemplary diagnosis of this class that can be treated with the compounds include, among others, nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin's lymphoma, and various classical forms of Hodgkin's disease, exemplary members of which are Nodular sclerosis Hodgkin's lymphoma (\ngrades\n 1 and 2), Lymphocyte-rich classical Hodgkin's lymphoma, Mixed cellularity Hodgkin's lymphoma, and Lymphocyte depletion Hodgkin's lymphoma. In various embodiments, any of the lymphoid neoplasms that are associated with aberrant JAK activity can be treated with the syk inhibitory compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the hematopoietic neoplasm treated is a myeloid neoplasm. This group comprises a large class of cell proliferative disorders involving or displaying the characteristic phenotype of the cells of the myeloid lineage. Myeloid neoplasms can be subdivided into myeloproliferative diseases, myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases, myelodysplastic syndromes, and acute myeloid leukemias. Exemplary myeloproliferative diseases are chronic myelogenous leukemia (e.g., Philadelphia chromosome positive (t(9;22)(qq34;q11)), chronic neutrophilic leukemia, chronic eosinophilic leukemia/hypereosinophilic syndrome, chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera, and essential thrombocythemia. Exemplary myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases are chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, atypical chronic myelogenous leukemia, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Exemplary myelodysplastic syndromes are refractory anemia, with ringed sideroblasts and without ringed sideroblasts, refractory cytopenia (myelodysplastic syndrome) with multilineage dysplasia, refractory anemia (myelodysplastic syndrome) with excess blasts, 5q-syndrome, and myelodysplastic syndrome. In various embodiments, any of the myeloid neoplasms that are associated with aberrant syk activity can be treated with the syk inhibitory compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the compounds can be used to treat Acute myeloid leukemias (AML), which represent a large class of myeloid neoplasms having its own subdivision of disorders. These subdivisions include, among others, AMLs with recurrent cytogenetic translocations, AML with multilineage dysplasia, and other AML not otherwise categorized. Exemplary AMLs with recurrent cytogenetic translocations include, among others, AML with t(8;21)(q22;q22), AML1(CBF-alpha)/ETO, Acute promyelocytic leukemia (AML with t(15;17)(q22;q11-12) and variants, PML/RAR-alpha), AML with abnormal bone marrow eosinophils (inv(16)(p13q22) or t(16;16)(p13;q11), CBFb/MYH11X), and AML with 11q23 (MLL) abnormalities. Exemplary AML with multilineage dysplasia are those that are associated with or without prior myelodysplastic syndrome. Other acute myeloid leukemias not classified within any definable group include, AML minimally differentiated, AML without maturation, AML with maturation, Acute myelomonocytic leukemia, Acute monocytic leukemia, Acute erythroid leukemia, Acute megakaryocytic leukemia, Acute basophilic leukemia, and Acute panmyelosis with myelofibrosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Treating” within the context of the invention means an alleviation of symptoms associated with a disorder or disease, or halt of further progression or worsening of those symptoms, or prevention or prophylaxis of the disease or disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “mammal” includes organisms which express syk. Examples of mammals include mice, rats, cows, sheep, pigs, goats, horses, bears, monkeys, dogs, cats and, preferably, humans. Transgenic organisms which express syk are also included in this definition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe inventive methods comprise administering an effective amount of a compound or composition described herein to a mammal or non-human animal. As used herein, “effective amount” of a compound or composition of the invention includes those amounts that antagonize or inhibit syk. An amount which antagonizes or inhibits syk is detectable, for example, by any assay capable of determining syk activity, including the one described below as an illustrative testing method. Effective amounts may also include those amounts which alleviate symptoms of a syk associated disorder treatable by inhibiting syk. Accordingly, “antagonists of syk” include compounds which interact with the syk, and modulate, e.g., inhibit or decrease, the ability of a second compound, e.g., another syk ligand, to interact with the syk. The syk binding compounds are preferably antagonists of syk. The language “syk binding compound” (e.g., exhibits binding affinity to the receptor) includes those compounds which interact with syk resulting in modulation of the activity of syk. Syk binding compounds may be identified using an in vitro (e.g., cell and non-cell based) or in vivo method. A description of in vitro methods are provided below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of compound present in the methods and compositions described herein should be sufficient to cause a detectable decrease in the severity of the disorder, as measured by any of the assays described in the examples. The amount of syk modulator needed will depend on the effectiveness of the modulator for the given cell type and the length of time required to treat the disorder. In certain embodiments, the compositions of this invention may further comprise another therapeutic agent. When a second agent is used, the second agent may be administered either as a separate dosage form or as part of a single dosage form with the compounds or compositions of this invention. While one or more of the inventive compounds can be used in an application of monotherapy to treat a disorder, disease or symptom, they also may be used in combination therapy, in which the use of an inventive compound or composition (therapeutic agent) is combined with the use of one or more other therapeutic agents for treating the same and/or other types of disorders, symptoms and diseases. Combination therapy includes administration of the two or more therapeutic agents concurrently or sequentially. The agents may be administered in any order. Alternatively, the multiple therapeutic agents can be combined into a single composition that can be administered to the patient. For instance, a single pharmaceutical composition could comprise the compound or pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester or prodrug thereof according to the formula I, another therapeutic agent (e.g., methotrexate) or a tautomer thereof or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester or prodrug thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention comprises a compound having the formula I, a method for making an inventive compound, a method for making a pharmaceutical composition from at least one inventive compound and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient, and a method of using one or more inventive compounds to treat a variety of disorders, symptoms and diseases (e.g., inflammatory, autoimmune, neurological, neurodegenerative, oncology and cardiovascular), such as RA, osteoarthritis, irritable bowel disease IBD, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD and MS. The inventive compounds and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and/or neutral compositions may be formulated together with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier and the resulting composition may be administered in vivo to mammals, such as men, women and animals, to treat a variety of disorders, symptoms and diseases. Furthermore, the inventive compounds can be used to prepare a medicament that is useful for treating a variety of disorders, symptoms and diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll of the compounds of the present invention are either potent inhibitors of syk kinases, exhibiting IC\n50\ns in the respective assay in the range of less than 5 μM, with most being in the nanomolar, and several in the sub-nanomolar, range. In some embodiments, the compounds of the present invention may be “dual” syk/JAK inhibitors in that they inhibit both syk and JAK kinase to some degree. In other embodiments, the compounds of the present invention may selectively inhibit syk kinase, but not appreciably inhibit one or more JAK kinases. In other embodiments, the compounds of the present invention may selectively inhibit JAK kinase, but not appreciably inhibit one or more syk kinases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nf. Kits\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStill another aspect of this invention is to provide a kit comprising separate containers in a single package, wherein the inventive pharmaceutical compounds, compositions and/or salts thereof are used in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers to treat states, disorders, symptoms and diseases where syk plays a role.\n\n\n \nI.

Typical solvents employed for the Isco systems and flash column chromatography may be dichloromethane, methanol, ethyl acetate, hexane, acetone, aqueous hydroxyamine and triethyl amine. Typical solvents employed for the reverse phase HPLC may be varying concentrations of acetonitrile and water with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid.\n\n\n \nGeneral Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following synthetic reaction schemes are merely illustrative of some methods by which the compounds of the present invention can be synthesized, and various modifications to these synthetic reaction schemes can be made and will be suggested to one skilled in the art having referred to the disclosure contained in this application.\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\n4-(4-(4-acetylpiperazin-1-yl)phenylamino)-2-((1R,2S)-2-aminocyclohexylamino)pyrimidine-5-carboxamide\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStep 1: To a stirring solution of carboxylic acid 72.1 (85 g, 540 mmol) in thionyl chloride (425 mL) was added pyridine (8.5 mL, 0.11 mmol), slowly. The reaction was stirred at 75° C. overnight at which time it was concentrated and dried under vacuum to a light yellow powder. This yellow solid was slowly diluted with 750 mL of ethanol and refluxed overnight. The next day the reaction was determined to be complete by HPLC and then cooled in an ice bath and the solid filtered and washed with diethyl ether affording ethyl ester 72.2 an off-white powder (91 g, 87% for two steps).

The in vitro and in vivo human syk activities of the inventive compounds can be determined by various procedures known in the art, such as a test for their ability to inhibit the activity of human plasma syk. The potent affinities for human syk inhibition exhibited by the inventive compounds can be measured by an IC\n50 \nvalue (in nM). The IC\n50 \nvalue is the concentration (in nM) of the compound required to provide 50% inhibition of human syk proteolytic activity. The smaller the IC\n50 \nvalue, the more active (potent) is a compound for inhibiting syk activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn in vitro assay for detecting and measuring inhibition activity against syk is as follows:\n\n\n \nInhibition of syk Tyrosine Phosphorylation Activity\n\n\n \n \n \nPotency of candidate molecules for inhibiting syk tyrosine phosphorylation activity is assessed by measuring the ability of a test compound to inhibit syk-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of a syk-specific substrate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSYK tyrosine phosphorylation activity is measured using the LANCE™ Technology developed by Perkin Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences (Boston, Mass.). LANCE™ refers to homogeneous time resolved fluorometry applications using techniques such as time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay (TR-FRET) (see generally for procedures in Perkin Elmer Application Note—How to Optimize a Tyrosine Kinase Assay Using Time Resolved Fluorescence-Based LANCE Detection, wwww.perkinelmer.com/lifesciences). The assay principle involves detection of a phosphorylated substrate using energy transfer from a phosphospecific europium-labeled antibody to streptavidin-allophycocyanin as an acceptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo test the ability of candidate molecules to inhibit SYK tyrosine phosphorylation activity, molecules are reconstituted in 30% DMSO and serially diluted 1:3 with the final dilution containing DMSO in the absence of the candidate molecule. The final DMSO concentration in the assay is 3%. Kinase assays are performed as a two part reaction. The first reaction is a kinase reaction and which comprises of a candidate molecule, full length active recombinant SYK enzyme (Millipore, Calif.) and biotin-labeled SYK-specific substrate biotin-DEEDYESP-OH. The second reaction involves termination of the kinase reaction and the simultaneous addition of the detection reagents—europium-labeled anti-phosphotyrosine reagent (Eu-W1024-PY100, Perkin Elmer, Boston, Mass.) and Streptavidin-Allophycocyanin detection reagent (SA-APC, Prozyme, Calif.). The kinase reaction is performed in a black U-bottom 96-well microtitre plate. The final reaction volume is 50 μL and contains a final concentration of 1 nM active SYK enzyme, 550 nM SYK-substrate, and 100 μM ATP diluted in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl\n2\n, and 1 mM DTT. The reaction is allowed to proceed for 1 hour at room temperature. The quench buffer contains 100 mM Tris pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl\n2\n, 20 mM EDTA, 0.02% Brij35, and 0.5% BSA. The detection reagents are added to the reaction mixture at the following dilutions-1:500 for Eu-W1024-PY100 and 1:250 for SA-APC. The kinase reaction is terminated by the addition of 50 μL quench buffer containing the detection reagents. The detection is allowed to proceed for 1 hr at room temperature. Detection of the phosphorlated substrate in the absence and presence of inhibitors is measured in the TR-FRET instrument, Analyst HT (Molecular Probes, Sunnyvale, Calif.) and the condition for measurements are set up using CriterionHost Release 2.0 (Molecular Probes, Sunnyvale, Calif.). The settings used are a follows: \nexcitation\n 360 nm, emission 665-7.5 nm, beam splitter 350 \nnm\n 50/50, \nflash\n 100 pulses, delay 60 us, integration 400 us, z-\nheight\n 2 mm. Inhibition of SYK-tyrosine kinase activity is calculated as the maximum response observed in the presence of inhibitor, compared to that in the absence of inhibitor. IC\n50\ns were derived by non-linear regression analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntracellular phospho-flow cytometry was used to test compound inhibition of Syk activity in intact non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cell lines Ramos and SUDHL-6. 10×10\n6 \ncells in log phase growth were aliqoted; Syk kinase is activated by incubating cells for 10 minutes with 3 μg/ml antibody specific to the B cell receptor. Directly following, cells are fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde for 5 minutes at room temperature, washed in phosphate buffered saline, and then permeablized by incubation for 2 hours in ice cold methanol. Cells are again washed in phosphate buffered saline, then incubated for 30 minutes with antibody specific for phosphorylated Erk (Y204) and BLNK (Y84), which are indicators of Syk kinase activity, and phosphorylated Syk (Y352), a measure of Src family kinase activity. All antibodies used are purchased from BD Pharmingen (San Jose, Calif.). After incubation with antibodies, cells are again washed and subjected to flow cytometry. Representative data detailing inhibition of B cell receptor singaling by compounds are shown in Table 1 as IC\n50 \nranges.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-proliferative effects of compounds on non-Hodgkin's lymphoma B cell lines SUDHL-4, SUDHL-6, and Toledo was also assessed. SUDHL-4 and SUDHL-6 require B cell receptor signaling for growth and survival, while the Toledo cell line (serving here as a negative control) does not. Cells were aliquoted into each well of a 96-well plate and incubated with increasing concentrations of compound for 72 hours, after which cell survival and proliferation was determined using the MTT assay (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, Calif.) following protocols supplied by the manufacturer. Data are detailed in the Tables and Figures herein as IC\n50 \nvalues plus or minus standard deviations from 5 or 6 independent experiments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInduction of apoptosis in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma B cell lines SUDHL-4, SUDHL-6, and Toledo was assessed by measuring the \napoptotis marker Caspase\n 3. Cells were incubated with 1, 3, or 10 μM compound for 24, 48, and 72 hours. At the conclusion of each time point, cells were processed for flow cytometry analysis using the Monoclonal Rabbit Anti-Active Caspase-3 Antibody Kit and related protocols (BD Pharmingen). Data from two independent experiments are presented in Tables 7A and 7B, representing the percent of total cells undergoing apoptosis following incubation with compounds under the indicated conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSyk activity is not only required for B cell signaling, proliferation, and survival, as shown, but is also critical for cellular activation upon cross-linking of the B cell receptor. B cell activation leads to increased cell surface expression of several proteins involved in cell signaling, antigen presentation, and adhesion. Among these, CD80, CD86, and CD69 are commonly measured to determine B cell activation status. Therefore, primary mouse B cells isolated from spleen were aliquoted and incubated with increasing concentrations of compound (0.05 to 2 μM) in the presence of goat anti-mouse IgD (eBiosciences, Inc., San Diego, Calif.) for 20 hours to cross-link the B cell receptor. Following, cells were washed and incubated for 30 minutes on ice with antibodies specific for the CD80, CD86, and CD69 B cell activation markers. B cells were identified from the pooled population by staining with the B cell marker CD45RO. All antibodies were purchased from BD Pharmingen. Table 8 depicts the IC\n50 \nrange in which these compounds inhibited B cell receptor induced activation of mouse primary B cells\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the table below, activity in the Syk and/or Jak

the inhibition the GPVI-specific agonist Convulxin-induced human platelet calcium-mobilization or aggregation. Calcium-mobilization is assessed in human washed platelets in a 96-well microtiter format. Aggregation is assessed in a 96-well microtiter assay (see generally the procedures in Jantzen, H. M. et al. (1999) \nThromb. Hemost. \n81:111-117) or standard cuvette light transmittance aggregometry using human platelet-rich plasma (PRP).\n\n\n \nInhibition of Convulxin-Mediated Platelet Calcium-Mobilization In Vitro\n\n\n \n \n \nInhibition of Convulxin-induced calcium-mobilization was determined in human washed platelets using the \nFLIRP Calcium\n 3 Assay Kit (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif.). For preparation of washed platelets, human venous blood is collected from healthy, drug-free volunteers into ACD (85 mM sodium citrate, 111 mM glucose, 71.4 mM citric acid) containing PGI\n2 \n(1.25 ml ACD containing 0.2 μM PGI\n2 \nfinal; PGI\n2 \nwas from Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.). Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is prepared by centrifugation at 160×g for 20 minutes at room temperature. Washed platelets are prepared by centrifuging PRP for 10 minutes at 730 g and resuspending the platelet pellet in CGS (13 mM sodium citrate, 30 mM glucose, 120 mM NaCl; 2 ml CGS/10 ml original blood volume). After incubation at 37° C. for 15 minutes, the platelets are collected by centrifugation at 730 g for 10 minutes and resuspended at a concentration of 3×10\n8 \nplatelets/ml in Hepes-Tyrode's buffer (10 mM Hepes, 138 mM NaCl, 5.5 mM glucose, 2.9 mM KCl, 12 mM NaHCO\n3\n, pH 7.4). This platelet suspension is kept >45 minutes at room temperature before use in calcium mobilization assays.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor 96-well plate Calcium-mobilization experiments, equal volumes of 3×10\n8 \nwashed platelets/ml were incubated with equal volumes of Calcium-3 Assay Reagent A resuspended in 1× Hank's Balanced Salt Solution, pH 7.4, 20 mM Hepes buffer. The total reaction volume of 0.2 ml/well includes 1.5×10\n8\n/ml washed platelet/Calcium-3 Assay reagent A mix, 10 μM Eptifibatide (Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc, Cambridge, Mass.), serial dilutions (1:3) of test compounds in 0.75% DMSO. DMSO alone is added to 1 well of each 8 set to allow for a maximal calcium-mobilization reading. After 20 minutes preincubation at room temperature the 96-well microplate reader is loaded into the FlexStation (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif.). The FlexStation experimental conditions for measuring Calcium mobilization are set up using SOFTMax Pro. The settings used are detailed below. Fluorescence parameters-assay mode: flex, excitation 485 nM, 525 nM with a cut-off of 515 nM; Parameters—PMT sensitivity-6, pipette height 230 μl, read \ntime\n 2 minutes and 40 seconds, read \nintervals\n 2 seconds, temperature-23-25° C. After 18 seconds of baseline reading, calcium-mobilization is initiated by the addition of Convulxin to a final concentration of 125 ng/ml. Inhibition of calcium-mobilization was calculated as the maximum response observed in the presence of inhibitor, compared to that in the absence of inhibitor. IC\n50\ns were derived by non-linear regression analysis.\n\n\n \n \nInhibition of Convulxin-Mediated platelet Aggregation In Vitro\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor preparation of human platelet-rich plasma for aggregation assays, human venous blood was collected from healthy, drug-free volunteers into 0.38% sodium citrate (0.013 M, pH 7.0 final). Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is prepared by centrifugation of whole blood at 160×g for 20 minutes at room temperature. The PRP layer is removed, transferred to a new tube, and the platelet count is adjusted, if advantageous, to achieve a platelet concentration of ˜3×10\n8 \nplatelets/ml using platelet-poor plasma (PPP). PPP is prepared by centrifugation of the remaining blood sample (after removal of PRP) for 20 minutes at 800×g. This preparation of PRP can subsequently be used for aggregation assays in either a 96-well plate or standard cuvette aggregometry.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInhibition of Convulxin-induced aggregation is determined in 96-well flat-bottom microtiter plates using a microtiter plate shaker and plate reader similar to the procedure described by Frantantoni et al., \nAm. J. Clin. Pathol. \n94, 613 (1990). All steps are performed at room temperature. For 96-well plate aggregation using platelet-rich plasma (PRP), the total reaction volume of 0.2 ml/well includes 190 μl of PRP (˜3×10\n8 \nplatelets/ml, see above), and 5 μl of either serial dilution of test compounds in 30% DMSO or buffer (for control wells). After 20 minutes preincubation at \nroom temperature\n 5 μl of 320 ng/ml Convulxin agonist solution is added to each well to give a final concentration of 8 ng/ml Convulxin. The plates are then agitated for 5 min on a microtiter plate shaker and the 5 minute reading is obtained in the microtitre plate reader (Softmax, Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, Calif.). Aggregation is calculated from the decrease of OD at 650 nm at t=5 minutes. IC\n50\ns were derived by non-linear regression analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInhibition of Convulxin-induced aggregation was also determined for cuvette light transmittance aggregation assays, serial dilutions (1:2) of test compounds were prepared in 30% DMSO in a 96 well V-bottom plate (final DMSO concentration in the cuvette was 0.3%). The test compound (5 μl of serial dilutions in DMSO) was preincubated with PRP for 20 minutes prior to initiation of aggregation reactions, which is performed in a ChronoLog aggregometer by addition of agonist (125-250 ng/ml Convulxin) to 495 μL of PRP at 37° C. The aggregation reaction is recorded for 4 min, and maximum extent of aggregation is determined by the difference in extent of aggregation at baseline, compared to the maximum aggregation that occurs during the 4 minute period of the assay. Inhibition of aggregation was calculated as the maximum aggregation observed in the presence of inhibitor, compared to that in the absence of inhibitor. IC\n50\ns were derived by non-linear regression analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of compounds and their syk and PRP IC\n50 \nvalues are given in tables 2-5.\n\n\n \nCalcium Flux Assay in Ramos Cells Induced by Bcr Cross-Linking\n\n\n \n \n \nRamos cells (2G6.4C10, Burkitt's lymphoma, ATCC Item Number: CRL-1923) are sub-cultured at 5×10\n5 \ncells/ml in \n \nfresh medium\n \n 3 or 4 days ahead of experiments. Cells are harvest and re-suspend in fresh medium at 8×10\n6 \ncells/ml before dye-loading. An equal volume of \nCalcium\n 3 loading dye (Molecular Device) is added and mixed into cell suspension. Loading cells are dispensed in a 96 well plate and incubated 30 min. Compounds are then added in the dye-loaded cells and incubated for another 30 min. Spin cell down at 1000 rpm for 3 min before fluorescence measurement in FlexStation. BCR stimulation is carried by the addition of 5 μg/ml antibody (AffiniPure F(ab′)\n2 \nfragment Donkey anti-human IgM, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboraotries).\n\n\n \nCalcium Flux Assay in Jurkat Cells Induced by Tcr Cross-Linking\n\n\n \n \n \nThe protocol is very similar to B cell calcium flux as described in the previous section. The only differences are that T cells (clone E6-1, Acute T cell Leukemia, ATCC Item Number: Tib-152) and anti-human CD3 (Functional Grade Purified anti-human CD3, clone OKT3, eBioscience, No. 16-0037) replaced B cells and anti-human IgM. Cell density is kept the same but antibody is used at a concentration of 100 ng/ml.\n\n\n \nIL-2 Secretion in Jurkat Cells Induced by TCR Cross-Linking\n\n\n \n \n \nJurkat cell propagation and compound incubation procedures are the same as described in Jurkat calcium flux assay in the previous section. Antibody (anti CD3, OKT3) is coated onto a fresh plate (without cells) at 100 ng/well. Cells are suspended at 8×10\n6 \ncells/ml and incubated with compounds for 30 min in a separate plate. At the end of incubation, cells are transferred to the antibody-coated plate and incubated for 16 hours. 100 μl of cell medium after incubation is used for IL-2 measurement after incubation. IL-2 level is determined using an IL-2 ELISA kit (Human IL-2 ELISA kit II, BD Bioscience, No. 550611).\n\n\n \nExample 611\n\n\nMillipore Upstate KinaseProfiler™ screening\n\n\n \n \n \nThis assay is a direct measurement of the effect of compound on the catalytic activity of JAK3. Purified human JAK3 (GenBank AF513860) sequence (residue 781-C terminus) was obtained from insect cells. The catalytic hydrolysis of ATP is measured using a radiometric filter binding method. Incubation of kinase with \n33\n[P]ATP and substrate leads to incorporation of \n33\n-[P] into the substrate which can then be separated from the other reaction components by filtration. Assays were performed using 10 μM ATP and in the absence or presence of 1, 0.3, or 0.1 μM compound. Activity was expressed as % of inhibition of control.\n\n\n \nExample 612\n\n\nAmbit KinomeScan screening\n\n\n \n \n \nThis assay is an ATP-site dependent competition binding assay in which human kinases of interest are fused to a proprietary tag (T7 bacteriophage). The amount of kinase bound to an immobilized, active-site directed ligand is measured in the presence and absence of the test compound. Ambit's JAK assays use kinase domains and not full-length proteins. The domain used for JAK1 binding is the pseudo kinase domain while that for JAK3 binding is the catalytic domain (Mazen W Karaman, Sanna Herrgard, Daniel K Treiber, et. al.

The effect of compounds on inhibition of JAK3 and/or JAK1 can be assessed by measuring the amount of phosphorylated STAT6. This is performed by Western blotting using a specific phospho-STAT6 antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRamos B cells were suspended in 10 mM Hepes-buffered RPMI media (2×10\n7 \ncells/ml). Cells (90 μl) were incubated with 10 μl 3.3 μg/ml interleukin 4 (R & D Systems Inc, cat #204-IL; final concentration: 0.33 μg/ml). Incubations were for 10 min at 37° C. in the absence or presence of 2 μl compound diluted in 30% DMSO. Reactions were terminated by the addition of an equal volume of 2× lysis buffer (100 mM TRIS-HCl pH 8.0, 2% Triton-X-100, 5 mM EDTA, 250 mM NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1.25 mM PMSF, 5 mM sodium orthovandate, 5 mM (3-glycerophosphate, mini complete EDTA protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSamples were incubated with 1 μl of the nuclease, benzonase (Novagen, cat #71205-3) for 1 hour, room temperature and then 50 \nμl\n 5× loading buffer (330 mM TRIS pH 6.8, 9.5 SDS, 34% glycerol, 0.01% bromophenol blue, 10% beta-mercaptoethanol) was added.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCell lysates (15 μL) were subjected to SDS-PAGE (Novex 4-12% TRIS-glycine gels, Invitrogen) under reducing conditions, followed by electroblot-transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were then incubated in Zymed blocking buffer (Invitrogen) for 1 hr at room temperature (RT) then overnight at 4° C. with 1:500 anti phosphotyrosine-STAT6 (Cell Signaling Technology, cat #9364) primary antibody in Zymed blocking buffer. Following 5×10 mM washes with Tris-buffered saline, 0.25% NP40 (TBSN), blots were incubated for 1 hr at room temperature in the presence of 1:10,000 HRP-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences, cat #NA934V) in Zymed blocking buffer. After 4×10 min TBSN washes, blots were visualized by ECL (Pierce Western Lightening, Perkin Elmer cat #NEL101). In order to determine total (33 content, blots were stripped, washed 4× with TBSN, and re-probed with 1:2000 C3A antibody in block buffer overnight at 4° C. After 4×10 min TBSN washes, blots were incubated with 1:10,000 goat anti-mouse secondary antibody in blocking buffer, washed 4 more times with TBSN and exposed to Western Lightening reagent. Levels of stimulation over background and the extent of inhibition of compound were were determined by densitometry.\n\n\n \nExample 606\n\n\nInhibition of JAK Kinase Activity Assay for Ramos B-Cell Line Stimulated with IL-4\n\n\n \n \n \nThese examples illustrate methods for evaluating the in vitro and in vivo human JAK kinase activities of the inventive compounds can be determined by various procedures known in the art, such as a test for their ability to inhibit the activity of human plasma JAK kinase. The potent affinities for human JAK kinase inhibition exhibited by the inventive compounds can be measured by an IC\n50 \nvalue (in nM). The IC\n50 \nvalue is the concentration (in nM) of the compound required to provide 50% inhibition of human JAK kinase activity. The smaller the IC\n50 \nvalue, the more active (potent) is a compound for inhibiting JAK kinase activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn in vitro assay for detecting and measuring inhibition activity against JAK kinase is as follows:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe activity of the compounds for JAK kinases is confirmed in cellular assays designed to test for JAK inhibition. Briefly, JAK inhibition is tested in human Ramos B-cells activated with cytokine Interleukin-4 (IL-4). Twenty to 24 hours post stimulation, the cells are stained for upregulation of CD23 and analyzed by FACS. Stimulation of the B-cells with IL-4 leads to the activation of the JAK/STAT pathway through phosphorylation of the JAK kinase JAK1 and JAK3, which in turn phosphorylate and activate transcription factors STAT-5 and STAT-6. The low-affinity IgE receptor (CD23) is upregulated by activated STAT-5.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the assay, human Ramos B-cells (ATCC, Catalog No. CRL-1596) are cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Cellgro, Catalog No. 10-040-CM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (JRH, Catalog No. 12106-500M) according to the propagation protocol supplied with the cells, and maintained at a density of approximately 3.5×10\n5 \ncells/ml. The day before the assay, the cells are diluted to 3.5×10\n5 \ncells/ml to insure they are in the logorithmic growth phase. The cells are spun down, and suspended in RPMI 1640 medium (Cellgro, MediaTech, Inc., Herndon, Va., Cat No. 10-040-CM) containing 5-10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), heat inactivated (JRH Biosciences, Inc, Lenexa, Kans., Cat No. 12106-500M) according to ATCC propagation protocol. Cells are maintained at a density of 3.5×10\n4-5 \ncells/ml. The day before the experiment, Ramos B-cells are diluted to 3.5×10\n5 \ncells/mL to ensure that they are in a logarithmic growth phase and aliquots dispensed into a 96-well tissue culture plate. Cells are incubated with test compound (dissolved in DMSO) or DMSO (control) for 1 hr at 37° C. and then stimulated with IL-4 (Pepotech, Catalog No. 200-04) for 20-24 hours (final concentration is 50 Units/ml).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCells are spun down and suspended in RPMI with 5% serum. 5×10\n4 \ncells are used per point in a 96-well tissue culture plate. Cells are pre-incubated with compound or DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo., Cat No. D2650) vehicle control for 1 hour in a 37° C. incubator. Cells are then stimulated with IL-4 (Peprotech Inc., Rocky Hill, N.J., Cat No. 200-04) for a final concentration of 50 units/mL for 20-24 hours. Cells are then spun down and stained with anti-CD23-PE(BD Pharmingen, San Diego, Calif., Cat No. 555711) and analyzed by FACS. Detection is performed using a BD LSR I System Flow Cytometer, purchased from Becton Dickinson Biosciences of San Jose, Calif.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProliferation is measured using CellTiter-Glo® Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega), which determines the number of viable cells in culture based on quantitation of the ATP present, as an indicator of metabolically active cells. The substrate is thawed and allowed to come to room temperature. After mixing the Cell Titer-Glo reagent and diluent together, 100 μL is added to each well. The plates are mixed on an orbital shaker for two minutes to induce lysis and incubated at room temperature for an additional ten minutes to allow the signal to equilibrate. Detection is performed using a \nWallac Victor2\n 1420 multilabel counter purchased from Perkin Elmer, Shelton, Conn.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOn day two, A549 cells are pre-incubated with a 2,4-pyrimidinediamine test compound or DMSO (control) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo., Catalog No. D2650) for 1 hour. The cells are then stimulated with IFNγ (75 ng/mL) (Peprotech Inc., Rocky Hill, N.J., Cat. No. 300-O\n2\n) and allowed to incubate for 24 hours. The final test compound dose range is 30 μM to 14 nM in 2004 F12K media containing 5% FBS, 0.3% DMSO.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOn day three, the cell media is removed and the cells are washed with 200 μL PBS (phosphate buffered saline). Each well is trypsinized to dissociate the cells, then neutralized by addition of 200 μL complete F12K media. Cells are pelleted and stained with an APC conjugated mouse anti-human ICAM-1 (CD54) (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, Calif., Catalog #559771) antibody for 20 minutes at 4° C. Cells are washed with ice cold FACS buffer (PBS+2% FBS) and surface ICAM-1 expression is analyzed by flow cytometry. Detection is performed using a BD LSR I System Flow Cytometer, purchased from BD Biosciences of San Jose, Calif. Events are gated for live scatter and the geometric mean is calculated (Becton-Dickinson CellQuest software version 3.3, Franklin Lakes, N.J.). Geometric means are plotted against the compound concentration to generate a dose response curve.\n\n\n \nExample 607\n\n\nInhibition of Syk-Mediated Signal Transduction Through the B Cell Receptor in Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma Cell Lines\n\n\n \n \n \nCells were pre-treated for 1 hour without or with compound (0.02 to 2 uM) prior to stimulation of B cell receptor singling by incubation of cells with 3 μg/ml anti-mu antibody for 10 minutes at 37° C. Ca\n2+\n flux was measured using the \nCalcium\n 3 loading dye and the FlexStation (Molecular Device). B cell receptor signaling was assayed by intracellular phospho-Flow Cytometry, following protocols supplied by BD Pharmingen (San Jose, Calif.). Syk activation was measured by induction of BLNK tyrosine phosphorylation at amino acid position 84 (pBLNK Y84) and induction of ERK1/2 tyrosine phosphorylation at amino acid position 204 (pERK Y204). Activation of the Src family member Lyn was measured by induction of Syk tyrosine phosphorylation at amino acid position 352 (pSyk Y352). Data are presented as μM IC\n50\ns.

Select compounds were evaluated for their ability to inhibit platelet clearance in a mouse model of antibody-mediated thrombocytopenia. In this model, a rapid clearance of circulating platelets (approximately 50%) results from the intravenous administration of a rat anti-mouse GPIIb (clone MWReg30) antibody (BD Biosciences, Pharmingen). To evaluate capacity for inhibition of platelet clearance, compounds were suspended into 0.5% methycellulose in water and administered via oral gavage (100 ul/mouse) at a time prior to antibody injection when the compound would achieve maximum plasma concentration (typically 1-2 hours based on separate pharmacokinetic experiments for individual compounds). At 4 and 8 hours after injection of antibody, terminal blood samples were obtained from groups of vehicle and test article treated mice (n=5-10 mice/group) via cardiac puncture. Blood was anticoagulated using trisodium citrate or EDTA. Whole blood samples were measured for platelet counts on a hematology analyzer (Hemavet, Drew Scientific). Remaining blood was processed for plasma and compound concentrations measured by mass spectrometry.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPlatelet clearance was determined by measuring the difference in platelet number between the average non-antibody treatment group and animals administered the rat anti-mouse GPIIb antibody. Inhibition of platelet clearance was determined by comparing the difference between platelet clearance of vehicle and compound treated animals.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAVERAGE\n\n\nAVERAGE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nINHIBITION\n\n\nINHIBITION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAVERAGE\n\n\nOF\n\n\n(%) OF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPEAK PLASMA\n\n\nPLATELET\n\n\nPLATELET\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCONCENTRATION\n\n\nCLEARANCE\n\n\nCLEARANCE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMPOUND DOSE\n\n\n(μM)\n\n\n(4 HRS)\n\n\n(8 HRS)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 87   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n   30 MG/KG/\nDAY\n \n\n\n \n\n\n27%*\n\n\n12%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 87   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n   10 MG/KG/\nDAY\n \n\n\n \n\n\n7%\n\n\n13%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n*DENOTES STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN CLINICAL INFLAMMATION SCORE COMPARED TO VEHICLE CONTROL BY 2-TAILED, UNPAIRED, STUDENTS T-TEST\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAverage Peak Plasma\n\n\nAverage Inhibition (%) of\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound dose\n\n\nConcentration (μM)\n\n\ninflammation score\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 596   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n   100 mg/kg/day\n\n\n10.2 μM\n\n\n88%*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 596   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n   30 mg/kg/day\n\n\n 4.4 μM\n\n\n27%*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n*denotes statistically significant reduction in clinical inflammation score compared to vehicle control by 2-tailed, unpaired, Students t-Test\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 612\n\n\nMouse Model of Collagen Antibody Induced Arthritis\n\n\n \n \n \nThe inhibitory activity of select compounds was investigated in a mouse model of collagen antibody induced arthritis (CAIA). Collagen induced arthritis is mediated by autoantibodies to type II collagen and complement, thus arthritis can be induced by administration of polyclonal antibodies or a mixture of monoclonal antibodies to type II collagen. The CAIA model (Chondrex, Inc., Redmond, Wash.) uses a mixture of 4 clones which recognize individual epitopes clustered within an 83 amino acid peptide fragment of type II collagen. These epitopes share common amino acid sequences with many different species of type II collagen including chicken, mouse, rat, bovine, porcine, monkey and human. The model utilizes a monoclonal antibody cocktail followed by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce a severe and consistent arthritis in mice within 7 days. This model was developed based on the hypothesis that bacterial toxins absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract play a synergistic and pathologic role with autoantibodies to type II collagen in triggering arthritis in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor these experiments, the monoclonal antibody cocktail (Lot # OC-708) was injected intravenously via tail vein at a dose of 4 mg/mouse (40 mg/ml) on \nday\n 0 followed by intraperitoneal injection of LPS diluted into normal saline at a dose of 25 ug/mouse in 8 week old, female Balb/C mice (Charles River, Inc.). Dosing of test articles was started just before or after the IV injection of antibody cocktail. Compounds were suspended into 0.5% methylcellulose in water and administered via oral gavage (100 ul/mouse) daily for the duration of the 7-10 day study. Clinical inflammation scores were obtained daily. Inhibition of clinical inflammation scores was determined based on the difference between vehicle and test article treated mice at the end of the experiment. Plasma concentrations represent peak concentration at 1 hour post last dose on the day of study termination.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAVERAGE PEAK\n\n\nAVERAGE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPLASMA\n\n\nINHIBITION (%) OF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCONCENTRATION\n\n\nINFLAMMATION\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMPOUND DOSE\n\n\n(μM)\n\n\nSCORE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 87   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n   30 mg/kg/day\n\n\n7.8 μM\n\n\n44%*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n*denotes statistically significant reduction in clinical inflammation score compared to vehicle control by 2-tailed, unpaired, Students t-Test\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 613\n\n\nInhibition of IL-4 Induced JAK1/3 to Stat-6 Phosphorylation in Ramos B Cells\n\n\n \n \n \nRamos B cells were pre-treated for 1 hour with increasing concentrations of compound, as indicated prior to addition of IL-4.

This proliferative response is dependent on the activation of JAK-1 and JAK-3 tyrosine kinases, which phosphorylate and activate the transcription factor Stat-5.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHuman primary T cells are prepared as follows. Whole blood is obtained from a healthy volunteer, mixed 1:1 with PBS, layered on to Ficoll Hypaque (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, N.J., Catalog #17-1440-03) in 2:1 blood/PBS:ficoll ratio and centrifuged for 30 min at 4° C. at 1750 rpm. The lymphocytes at the serum: ficoll interface are recovered and washed twice with 5 volumes of PBS. The cells are resuspended in Yssel's medium (Gemini Bio-products, Woodland, Calif., Catalog #400-103) containing 40 U/mL recombinant IL2 (R and D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn., Catalog #202-IL (20 μg)) and seeded into a flask pre-coated with 1 μg/mL anti-CD3 (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, Calif., Catalog #555336) and 5 μg/mL anti-CD28 (Immunotech, Beckman Coulter of Brea Calif., Catalog #IM1376). The primary T-cells are stimulated for 3 to 4 days, then transferred to a fresh flask and maintained in RPMI with 10% FBS and 40 U/mL IL-2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrimary T-cells are washed twice with PBS to remove the IL-2 and resuspended in Yssel's medium at 2×10\n6 \ncells/mL. 50 μL of cell suspension containing 80 U/mL IL-2 is added to each well of a flat bottom 96 well black plate. For the unstimulated control, IL-2 is omitted from the last column on the plate. Compounds are serially diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.7% pure, cell culture tested, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo., Catalog No. D2650) from 5 mM in 3-fold dilutions and then diluted 1:250 in Yssel's medium. 50 μL of 2× compound is added per well in duplicate and the cells are allowed to proliferate for 72 hours at 37° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProliferation is measured using CellTiter-Glo® Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega), which determines the number of viable cells in culture based on quantitation of the ATP present, as an indicator of metabolically active cells. The substrate is thawed and allowed to come to room temperature. After mixing the Cell Titer-Glo reagent and diluent together, 100 μL is added to each well. The plates are mixed on an orbital shaker for two minutes to induce lysis and incubated at room temperature for an additional ten minutes to allow the signal to equilibrate. Detection is performed using a \nWallac Victor2\n 1420 multilabel counter purchased from Perkin Elmer, Shelton, Conn.\n\n\n \nExample 616\n\n\nA549 Epithelial Line Stimulated with IFNγ\n\n\n \n \n \nA549 lung epithelial cells up-regulate ICAM-1 (CD54) surface expression in response to a variety of different stimuli. Therefore, using ICAM-1 expression as readout, compound effects on different signaling pathways can be assessed in the same cell type. IFNγ up-regulates ICAM-1 through activation of the JAK/Stat pathway. In this example, the up-regulation of ICAM-1 by IFNγ is assessed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe A549 lung epithelial carcinoma cell line originated from the American Type Culture Collection. Routine culturing is with F12K media (Mediatech Inc., Lenexa, Kans., Cat. No. 10-025-CV) with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 I.U. penicillin and 100 ng/mL streptomycin (complete F12k media). Cells are incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO\n2 \nat 37° C. Prior to use in the assay, A549 cells are washed with PBS and trypsinized (Mediatech Inc., Cat. No. 25-052-CI) to lift the cells. The trypsin cell suspension is neutralized with complete F12K media and centrifuged to pellet the cells. The cell pellet is resuspended in complete F12K media at a concentration of 2.0×10\n5\n/mL. Cells are seeded at 20,000 per well, 100 μL total volume, in a flat bottom tissue culture plate and allowed to adhere overnight.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOn day two, A549 cells are pre-incubated with a 2,4-pyrimidinediamine test compound or DMSO (control) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo., Catalog No. D2650) for 1 hour. The cells are then stimulated with IFNγ (75 ng/mL) (Peprotech Inc., Rocky Hill, N.J., Cat. No. 300-O\n2\n) and allowed to incubate for 24 hours. The final test compound dose range is 30 μM to 14 nM in 200 μL F12K media containing 5% FBS, 0.3% DMSO.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOn day three, the cell media is removed and the cells are washed with 200 μl PBS (phosphate buffered saline). Each well is trypsinized to dissociate the cells, then neutralized by addition of 200 μL complete F12K media. Cells are pelleted and stained with an APC conjugated mouse anti-human ICAM-1 (CD54) (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, Calif., Catalog #559771) antibody for 20 minutes at 4° C. Cells are washed with ice cold FACS buffer (PBS+2% FBS) and surface ICAM-1 expression is analyzed by flow cytometry. Detection is performed using a BD LSR I System Flow Cytometer, purchased from BD Biosciences of San Jose, Calif. Events are gated for live scatter and the geometric mean is calculated (Becton-Dickinson CellQuest software version 3.3, Franklin Lakes, N.J.). Geometric means are plotted against the compound concentration to generate a dose response curve.\n\n\n \nExample 617\n\n\nU937\n\n\nIFNγICAM1 FACS Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nU937 human monocytic cells up-regulate ICAM-1 (CD54) surface expression in response to a variety of different stimuli. Therefore, using ICAM-1 expression as readout, compound effects on different signaling pathways can be assessed in the same cell type. IFNγ up-regulates ICAM-1 through activation of the JAK/Stat pathway. In this example, the up-regulation of ICAM-1 by IFNγ is assessed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe U937 human monocytic cell line is obtained from ATCC of Rockville, Md., catalog number CRL-1593.2, and cultured in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% (v/v) FCS. U937 cells are grown in 10% RPMI. The cells are then plated at a concentration of 100,000 cells per 160 μL in 96 well flat bottom plates. The test compounds are then diluted as follows: 10 mM test compound is diluted 1:5 in DMSO (3 μL 10 mM test compound in 12 μL DMSO), followed by a 1:3 serial dilution of test compound in DMSO (6 μL test compound serially diluted into 12 μL DMSO to give 3-fold dilutions). Then 4 μL of test compound is transferred to 76 μL of 10% RPMI resulting in a 10× solution (100 μM test compound, 5% DMSO). For control wells, 4 μL of DMSO is diluted into 76 μL 10% RPMI.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe assay is performed in duplicate with 8 points (8 3-fold dilution concentrations from 10 μL) and with 4 wells of DMSO only (control wells) under stimulated conditions and 4 wells of DMSO only under unstimulated conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe diluted compound plate is mixed 2× using a multimek (Beckman Coulter of Brea, Calif.) and then 20 μL of the diluted compounds is transferred to the 96 well plate containing 160 μL of cells, which are then mixed again twice at low speeds. The cells and compounds are then pre-incubated for 30 minutes at 37° C. with 5% CO\n2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe 10× stimulation mix is made by preparing a 100 ng/mL solution of human IFNγ in 10% RPMI. The cells and compound are then stimulated with 20 μL of IFNγ stimulation mix to give a final concentration of 10 ng/mL IFNγ, 10 μM test compound, and 0.5% DMSO. The cells are kept under conditions for stimulation for 18-24 hours at 37° C. with 5% CO\n2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cells are transferred to a 96 well round bottom plate for staining and then kept on ice for the duration of the staining procedure. Cells are spun down at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes at 4° C., following which the supernatant is removed. Following removal of the supernatant, 1 μL APC conjugated mouse anti-human ICAM-1 antibody is added per 100 μL FACS buffer. The cells are then incubated on ice in the dark for 30 minutes. Following incubation, 150 μL of FACS buffer is added and the cells are centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes at 4° C., following which the supernatant is removed. After removal of the supernatant, 200 μL of FACS buffer is added and the cells are resuspended. After suspension, the cells are centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min at 4° C. Supernatant is then removed prior to resuspension of the cells in 150 μL FACS buffer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDetection is performed using a BD LSR I System Flow Cytometer, purchased from BD Biosciences of San Jose, Calif. The live cells are gated for live scatter and the geometric mean of ICAM-APC is measured (Becton-Dickinson CellQuest software version 3.3, Franklin Lakes, N.J.). Both % live cells and ICAM-1 expression is analyzed. The assays for the test compounds is carried out in parallel with a control compound of known activity. The EC\n50 \nfor the control compound is typically 40-100 nM.\n\n\n \nExample 618\n\n\nAnalysis of B Cell Signaling\n\n\n \n \n \nThe human non-Hodgkin's lymphoma B cell lines SUDHL-4 (#ACC 495), SUDHL-6 (#ACC572), and Karpas-422 (#ACC32) were obtained from DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany); Toledo (#CRL-2631) and Ramos (#CRL-1596) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, Va.). All cells were maintained in RPMI media (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (ATCC) and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), and maintained in a 37° C. humidified tissue culture incubator. Antibodies used in these studies include polyclonal goat F(ab)′2 anti-human IgG (H+ L) and anti-human IgM (BioSource, Camarillo, Calif.); rabbit anti-human Syk, rabbit anti-human phospho-Syk (Y525/526), rabbit anti-human phospho-Syk (Y352), anti-human BLNK, anti-human phospho-BLNK (Y84) were obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies, Inc. (Danvers, Mass.). The following antibodies were obtained from Becton Dickenson (San Jose, Calif.) for phospho-flow cytometry: Alexa fluor 488-conjugated mouse anti-human phospho-STAT6 (Y641), Phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated mouse anti-human phospho-Zap70 (Y319)/Syk(Y352), and Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated mouse anti-human phospho-ERK1/2 (T202/Y204).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPhospho-flow cytometry was performed essentially as described elsewhere (Irish, Czerwinski et al. Blood 108(9): 3135-42 (2006). 0.5×10\n6 \ncells in growth media were stimulated with 1 μg/ml anti-μ or anti-γ antibody for 10 minutes. Induced signaling was terminated immediately following the indicated time by the addition of paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, Pa.) to a final concentration of 1%. Cells were incubated with paraformaldehyde for 5 minutes at room temperature, washed once with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), then resuspended and incubated overnight at 4° C. in pre-chilled methanol (−80° C.) (company, address). Fixed and permeablized cells were subsequently washed once in PBS, a second time in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.), and then stained with the indicated antibodies diluted 1:20 in PBS+1% BSA. After 30 minutes, cells were washed once in PBS and subjected to flow cytometry using the FACS Calibur (Becton Dickenson). For Western blot analyses, 106 cells were stimulated for 30 minutes with 2 μg/ml of the indicated BCR-specific antibodies. Signaling was terminated by resuspending the cells in lysis buffer and incubated on ice for 1 hour. Cell debris were removed by centrifugation, and the cleared protein lysates were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and probed with the indicated antibodies following recommendations made by the manufacturers. Where indicated, cells were pre-treated for 1 hour at 37° C. with Syk inhibitors or vehicle control (0.5% DMSO) at several concentrations prior to stimulation with anti-BCR antibody.\n\n\n \nExample 619\n\n\nSelective Inhibition of Syk Activity\n\n\n \n \n \nCompounds were tested for their ability to inhibit purified Syk. example 596 and example 87 (two compounds from a Syk-specific series as shown in Table 1b) and P420-89 (from a series with dual Syk and JAK inhibitory activities) were found to suppress Syk kinase activity with IC50s of 43 nM, 6 nM, and 31 nM, respectively. The selectivity of these compounds for Syk was determined by screening each against a panel of 270 independent purified kinases at 300 nM (Millipore). The percent inhibition relative to vehicle control was calculated, and the numbers were converted into a heat-map; no inhibition is represented as green, increasing blending with red indicates increasing percent inhibition with yellow representing 50% inhibition and red representing 100% inhibition (\nFIG. 8\n). As depicted in \nFIG. 8A\n, example 596 and example 87 were highly Syk specific (first and second rows, respectively) whereas P420-89 inhibited multiple kinases (third row). The subset of kinases that were inhibited by >80% by any of the three compounds are shown in \nFIG. 8B\n. example 596 inhibited Syk and MLK-1 (first row). At 300 nM example 87 inhibited 10 different kinases (second row). When re-tested at 50 nM (approximately 10× above its \nSyk\n 1050 value of 6 nM), however, Syk was the only kinase that remained inhibited (third row). P420-89 inhibited Syk, JAK2 and JAK3, along with several other kinases (fourth row).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEmploying the Milipore panel of purified kinases EXAMPLE 87 (IC\n50\n=1 nM) inhibited 98% of purified Syk kinase activity at 50 nM.

At 300 nM, P420-89 inhibited Syk by 88%, along with >80% inhibition of 32 additional kinases. Among these were \nJAK\n 2 and 3 (93% and 85% inhibited, respectively), Flt-3 (83-92% inhibited), and cKit (95-97% inhibited), all targets for therapeutic manipulation of lymphocyte function.\n\n\n \nExample 620\n\n\nCalcium Flux Assay and Selective Inhibition of Syk in Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma B Cell Lines\n\n\n \n \n \nRamos cells were cultured (maintaining approximately 0.5×10\n6 \ncells/ml) in \ngrowth medium\n 3 to 4 days ahead of experiments. Cells were harvested and re-suspended in fresh medium at 8×10\n6 \ncells/ml before dye-loading. An equal volume of \nCalcium\n 3 loading dye (Molecular Device, Sunneyvale, Calif.) was added to the cell suspensions. Loaded cells were dispensed in a 96 well plate and incubated for 20 minutes. Syk inhibitors were then added to the loaded cells and incubated for another 30 minutes. B cells were stimulated with 5 μg/ml anti-μ antibody. Changes in intracellular Ca2\n+\n concentration was measured using the FlexSTATion (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe electivity and potency of Syk inhibition in B cells was initially interrogated by Western blot, measuring BCR-mediated induction of pSyk Y525/526 and pBLNK Y84, both measures of Syk kinase activity, and the induction of pSyk Y352, a measure of Src kinase activity. SUDHL-6 B cells were stimulated with anti-BCR specific antibody for 30 minutes in the presence or absence of each Syk inhibitor or vehicle control. Treatment with 0.16 or 1 M of each compound reduced BCR-induced Syk autophorphorylation (Y525/526) by roughly 40% and 60%, respectively, as estimated by densitometry (data not shown). An expanded range of concentrations was used to further evaluate the effect of these compounds on BCR induced Syk and Src kinase activity. As shown in \nFIG. 9\n, A-C, each compound inhibited Syk activity (pBLNK Y84) with IC50 values ranging from 0.16 to 1 M, while no effect on Src activity (pSyk Y352) was observed as high as 2.5 M.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ability of each compound to suppress signaling events more distal to the BCR was also measured. Cells were again stimulated by anti-BCR antibody in the presence or absence of various concentrations of each Syk inhibitor. The induction of pSyk Y352 was measured as a specificity control, while that of pERK1/2/Y204 was used as a measure of more distal Syk-dependent signaling (Jiang, Craxton et al. J Exp Med 188(7): 1297-306 (1998). \nFIG. 12C\n shows representative FACS plots depicting the effect of the most specific and potent Syk inhibitor of the three, example 87, on BCR signaling. At 125 nM, ERK1/2 activation was completely suppressed, whereas the stimulated cells still stained positive for Syk Y352. This experiment was repeated, in which the effect of all three compounds on Src and Syk activity were determined (\nFIG. 10A\n). Concentrations of less than 125 nM were sufficient to suppress BCR induced Syk signaling to ERK1/2. By contrast, much higher concentrations were required to cause a modest suppression of Src activity; an effect on Src that was not observed by Western blot (\nFIG. 9\n, A-C). None of these Syk inhibitors suppressed PMA-induced ERK1/2 tyrosine phosphorylation, demonstrating these compounds do not inhibit signaling events down-stream of PKC.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhereas example 596 and example 87 specifically inhibited Syk in purified and cellular assays, P420-89 additionally demonstrated activity against purified JAK kinases. These compounds were tested for inhibition of IL-4 signaling to STAT-6 via JAK1/3 in B cells, a signaling pathway that does not require Syk. The Syk specific compounds did not suppress IL4 signaling at concentrations as high as 2 μM. Conversely, P420-89 did suppress IL4 signaling, with an IC50 around 125 nM (\nFIG. 10B\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis shows that selective inhibition of Syk suppressed BCR-induced Ca2+ flux in B cells with IC50 values around 100 nM. This suggests that by inhibiting Syk, these compounds suppress the signaling pathway, blocking the cellular response.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSelective inhibition of Syk is sufficient to suppress BCR signaling without affecting Src (\nFIGS. 9\n, \n10\n and \n12\n) or JAK (\nFIG. 10B\n). example 87, suppressed proliferation of NHL cell lines with equal potency to the multi-kinase inhibitor, P420-89 (Table, \nFIG. 18C\n). Additionally, example 87 and P420-89 equally induced apoptosis in these cells (\nFIG. 11B\n). This data demonstrates the role of Syk signaling in the survival of NHL cell lines, and demonstrates that inhibition of kinases other than Syk is not required to achieve this effect.\n\n\n \nExample 621\n\n\n \nCaspase\n 3 and Proliferation Assays: Syk Inhibition Disrupts Proliferation and Survival of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma B Cell Lines\n\n\n \n \n \nInduction of apoptosis was measured using the PE-conjugated monoclonal active caspase-3 antibody apoptosis kit (Becton Dickenson) following the supplied protocol. Cells were suspended in growth media (0.5×10\n6 \ncells/ml) and treated with the indicated concentrations of each Syk inhibitor or vehicle control for 24, 48, or 72 hours prior to FACS analysis. The MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, a tetrazole) assay (company name) was used as a measure of cell viability and growth, following protocols supplied by the manufacturer. Cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of each Syk inhibitor or vehicle control for 72 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSUDHL-4 and SUDHL-6 cells were previously classified as “BCR-type” (Monti, Savage et al. Blood 105(5): 1851-61 (2005); Polo, Juszczynski et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 104(9): 3207-12 (2007) and sensitive to Syk inhibition by R406 (Chen, Monti et al. 2008). The Toledo and Karpas-422 cell lines that lack BCR and BLNK expression, respectively (Gabay, Ben-Bassat et al. Eur J Haematol 63(3): 180-91 (1999); Sprangers, Feldhahn et al. Oncogene 25(36): 5056-62 (2006), having therefore adapted to survive independent of BCR signals, were insensitive to R406 (Chen, Monti et al. 2008). The proliferation of these cell lines when cultured in the presence or absence of various concentrations of each Syk inhibitor for 72 hours was tested. As presented in the Table in \nFIG. 18C\n, each compound suppressed proliferation of the Syk-dependent SUDHL cell lines with IC50 values in the low μM range. Toledo cells required much higher concentrations to affect proliferation. Dual suppression of Syk and JAK kinases by P420-89 did not appear to have a greater anti-proliferative effect relative to Syk inhibition alone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSelective inhibition of Syk was sufficient to induce apoptosis in “BCR-type” NHL cell lines. Cells were incubated with 1 or 3 M of the Syk specific inhibitor example 87 for 72 h. As demonstrated in \nFIG. 11A\n, SUDHL-4 and -6 cells each underwent apoptosis, whereas the Toledo and Karpas-422 cells did not (\nFIG. 11A\n). In replicate experiments, the specific inhibition of Syk by example 596 and example 87 induced apoptosis only in the SUDHL and Ramos cell lines. By comparison, P420-89, which potently inhibits Syk and JAK kinases, induced apoptosis in all the “BCR-type” cell lines, as well as in Karpas-422 and JJN-3, a multiple myeloma cell line that lacks BCR, and BLNK expression (Sprangers, Feldhahn et al. Oncogene 25(36): 5056-62 (2006). The Toledo cells remained insensitive to all three compounds (\nFIG. 11B\n). In a separate experiment, the SUDHL-6 and Toledo cells were found to be equally sensitive to induction of apoptosis by 72 h treatment with 1 M PMA. These data demonstrate the specific requirement of Syk in the survival of certain NHL cell lines.\n\n\n \nExample 622\n\n\nXenograft Studies and Tumor and Plasma Concentration Analysis\n\n\n \n \n \nSyk Inhibition Protects Against Tumor Formation in a Xenograft Mouse Model. Mice were received (company) and acclimated in-house at least three days prior to use. Ramos cells (3×106) were injected subcutaneously into the hind flank area of conscious mice using a 27 gauge needle in an injection volume of less than 0.5 ml. Following injection, mice were randomized into treatment groups (n=15) and dosed twice daily by oral gavage with vehicle or 10, 15, or 20 mg/kg of the Syk inhibitor example 87. Body weights were obtained at least once per week and caliper measurements of tumors were determined twice per week beginning when palpable tumorrs were formed until the end of the study. Tumor volume was assessed by caliper measurement using a formula [maximum length×width×height×π/6]. Twice daily dosing of vehicle or example 87 continued until the vehicle or any treatment group exhibited tumors that exceeded 1.5 grams in size. At the time of termination (5 weeks post Ramos innoculation) the mice were anesthetized with a ketamine cocktail. A blood sample was obtained for CBC and plasma concentration determination via cardiac puncture and the mice were euthanized via cervical dislocation. Tumors were then be excised and weighed. One half of the tumor was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for determination of concentration of example 87 in the tumor tissue and the other half was placed in 10% buffered formalin for histological investigation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effect of Syk inhibition on Ramos tumor formation in a xenograft mouse model was assessed. Mice were dosed twice daily with 10, 15, or 20 mg/kg example 87 or vehicle control beginning the day of tumor cell inoculation. Caliper measurements were initiated when tumors began to form, approximately three weeks post-tumor inoculation, and repeated every third day until termination of the study. The study was terminated when tumor weights began reaching approximately 1.5 mg, at which time tumors were excised and weighed. Tumor and plasma samples were subjected to pharmacokinetic analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach tumor sample was homogenized in 3 ml of saline per gram of tumor using the Kontes® Microtube Pellet Pestle® Rods and Motor (Kimble Chase, Vineland, N.J.). Plasma and tumor samples were analyzed for example 87 concentration using a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometer (LC/MS/MS). In brief, plasma and tumor samples were processed in a 96-well Captiva™ filter plate (0.2 μm, Varian, Inc., Palo Alto, Calif.). Aliquots of plasma and homogenized tumor samples were precipitated with acetonitrile containing 200 ng/mL of:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nthe internal standard. The mixture was vortexed and refrigerated at 4° C. for 30 minutes to allow complete protein precipitation. The mixture was filtered into a 96-well collection plate. The filtrate was injected onto a Sciex API3000 LC/MS/MS equipped with a turbo-ion spray source. example 87 and Compound A were separated on a Phenomenex Luna 5μ HILIC column (4.6×100 mm, 5 mm; Phenomenex, Torrance, Calif.). A mobile phase gradient mixture of 10% mobile phase A (0.1% formic acid in water) and 90% mobile phase B (0.1% formic acid in 90% acetonitrile, 10% water) to 65% mobile phase B was programmed over 1.1 minutes followed by a gradient of mobile phase B from 65% to 90% over 0.01 minutes. The peak areas of the m/z 394/360 product ion of example 87 were measured against those of the m/\nz\n 357/295 product ion of Compound A (internal standard) in positive ion mode. The analytical range was 2 to 5000 ng/ml.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmacokinetic analysis revealed that at steady-state, tumor concentrations of example 87 followed the concentration-time profiles seen with plasma in the 10, 15, and 20 mg/kg dose groups. Nonlinear increases in C\nmax\n, AUC (0-8), and tumor C\nmin \nwere observed as the dose was increased, but a dose-proportional increase in plasma C\nmin \nwas noted. Mean C\nmax \nand AUC (0-8) in plasma was at least 2-fold greater than that in tumor for all doses examined; however, mean nadir concentrations (C\nmin\n) were higher in tumor than in plasma (Table 14A), indicating accumulation of example 87 in the tumor compartment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable 14A\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTmax\n \nCmin\n \nCmax\n \nAUC (0-8)\n \n \n \n \n \nDosing regiment\n \n(hr)\n \n(ng/mL)\n \n(ng/mL)\n \n(ng * hr/mL)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDetermined from \nplasma\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n10 mg/kg BID\n \n1.50\n \n17.6\n \n179\n \n738\n \n \n \n \n \n15 mg/kg BID\n \n1.50\n \n26.6\n \n343\n \n1671\n \n \n \n \n \n20 mg/kg BID\n \n4.00\n \n39.5\n \n570\n \n3191\n \n \n \n \n \nDetermined from \ntumor\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n10 mg/kg BID\n \n8.00\n \n24.5\n \n55.2\n \n353\n \n \n \n \n \n15 mg/kg BID*\n \n4.00\n \n67.8\n \n163\n \n475\n \n \n \n \n \n20 mg/kg BID\n \n4.00\n \n125\n \n252\n \n1453\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable 14B\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDosing\n \ntumor/plasma ratio\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nregimen\n \nAUC based\n \nCmax based\n \nCmin based\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n10 mg/kg BID\n \n0.478\n \n0.308\n \n1.39\n \n \n \n \n \n15 mg/kg BID*\n \n0.284\n \n0.475\n \n2.55\n \n \n \n \n \n20 mg/kg BID\n \n0.455\n \n0.442\n \n3.15\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNote:\n \n \n \n \n \nNadir (0), 1.5, 4, and 8 h samples were taken on the da of harvest following the AM dose. The second dose was not administered on the day of harvest; therefore, pharmacokinetic values above were determined after a single AM dose at steady-state.\n \n \n \n \n \n*Only one tumor sample was available for the 8 h time-point and may have been an outlier (tumor concentrations at 8 h - 608 ng/ml); therefore, pharmacokinetic parameters were determined between 0 to 4 h for the 15 mg/kg BID EXAMPLE 87 dose group. As a result, AUC (0-8) and AUC based tumor/plamsa ration for this dose group may be underestimated.\n \n \n \n \n \n\nThe difference between plasma and tumor C\nmin \nbecame more prominent as the dose was increased, as indicated by the increase in tumor/plasma ratios determined from C\nmin \n(Table 14B). Tumor/plasma ratios determined from C\nmax \nand AUC (0-8) were similar across the various dose groups. Tumor concentrations were sustained above 60, 170, and 640 nM over the entire dosing interval at steady-state for example 87 at 10, 15, and 20 mg/kg, respectively.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMice dosed with all three concentrations of example 87 were protected from Ramos tumor growth in vivo. This was first evident from caliper measurements (data not shown), which revealed a reduced rate of tumor growth in the presence of the Syk inhibitor. Upon study completion, mice were euthanized and tumors excised and weighed; data presented in \nFIG. 17A\n. Consistent with caliper measurements, a statistically significant reduction in average tumor weight was achieved in all dosing groups, relative to vehicle control. These data reveal that sub-micromolar concentrations of example 87 can prevent tumor formation by an aggressive NHL cell line in mice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMice dosed with the Syk inhibitor did not present with reduced numbers in any subset of white blood cells. In fact, the only effect observed was an increase in the number of lymphocytes in mice treated with 15 mg/kg example 87, which was not repeated in mice dosed with 10 or 20 mg/kg (\nFIG. 18B\n). The relative percent of each cell subtype analyzed was also unaffected by the Syk inhibitor (data not shown). On average, mice treated with vehicle control had a 9.45% increase in body weight. Mice treated with 10, 15, and 20 mg/kg example 87, on the other hand, had on average 0.27% increase, 1.67% decrease, and 2.27% decrease in body weight, respectively, over the course of the study. There was no relationship, however, between % change in body weight and tumor growth (R2=0.27). These data suggest that the inhibition of tumor growth was indeed mediated by suppression of Syk activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Syk-specific inhibitor example 87 was also tested for activity in a Ramos tumor mouse xenograft model. At all the concentrations tested, statistically significant reductions in tumor growth were observed in mice dosed BID with example 87. The lowest concentration tested was 10 mg/kg, achieving tumor concentrations ranging from 64 to 140 nM over the course of the day. Suppression of tumor growth at these concentrations in vivo is consistent with concentrations of <125 nM found to suppress BCR-induced Ca2+ flux and distal BCR signaling to pERK Y204 (\nFIGS. 10 and 12\n). The selective pharmacological inhibition of Syk results in effects on the proliferations and survival of NHL cell lines. These data suggest that the selective targeting of Syk may similarly have clinical benefit in a variety of B-cell proliferative disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs detailed herein, Syk has been implicated experimentally in B cell development, proliferation, and survival. Moreover, Syk is implicated as an oncogene. Expression of constitutively active Syk in adoptively transferred bone marrow cells induces leukemia in mice, and over-activity of Syk is associated with a variety of lymphomas in humans Given the role of Syk in B cell biology, its selective inhibition may be sufficient to provide clinical benefit in B cell proliferative disorders, while reducing toxicities that may arise due to suppression of other off-target kinases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides a number of embodiments.

No. 11/964,285 filed Dec. 26, 2007; and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/017,125 filed Dec. 27, 2007; all of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nDescribed herein are irreversible kinase inhibitor compounds, methods for synthesizing such irreversible inhibitors, and methods for using such irreversible inhibitors in the treatment of diseases. Further described herein are methods, assays and systems for determining an appropriate irreversible inhibitor of a protein, including a kinase.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nA kinase, alternatively known as a phosphotransferase, is a type of enzyme that transfers phosphate groups from high-energy donor molecules, such as ATP, to specific target molecules; the process is termed phosphorylation. Protein kinases, which act on and modify the activity of specific proteins, are used to transmit signals and control complex processes in cells. Up to 518 different kinases have been identified in humans. Their enormous diversity and role in signaling makes them attractive targets for drug design.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nDescribed herein are inhibitors of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk). Also described herein are irreversible inhibitors of Btk. Further described are irreversible inhibitors of Btk that form a covalent bond with a cysteine residue on Btk. Further described herein are irreversible inhibitors of other tyrosine kinases, wherein the other tyrosine kinases share homology with Btk by having a cysteine residue (including a \nCys\n 481 residue) that forms a covalent bond with the irreversible inhibitor (such tyrosine kinases, are referred herein as “Btk tyrosine kinase cysteine homologs”). Also described herein are irreversible inhibitors of tyrosine kinases that have an accessible cysteine residue near an active site of the tyrosine kinase (referred herein as “Accessible Cysteine Kinases” or ACKs). Also described herein are irreversible inhibitors of any of the aforementioned tyrosine kinases, in which the irreversible inhibitor includes a Michael acceptor moiety. Further described are such irreversible inhibitors in which the Michael acceptor moiety preferentially forms a covalent bond with the appropriate cysteine residue on the desired tyrosine kinase relative to forming a covalent bond with other biological molecules that contain an accessible SH moiety. Also described herein are methods for synthesizing such irreversible inhibitors, methods for using such irreversible inhibitors in the treatment of diseases (including diseases wherein irreversible inhibition of Btk provides therapeutic benefit to a patient having the disease). Further described are pharmaceutical formulations that include an irreversible inhibitor of Btk.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds described herein include those that have a structure of any of Formula (A1-A6), Formula (B1-B6), Formula (C1-C6), Formula (D1-D6), Formula (I), or Formula (VII), and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, esters, acids and prodrugs thereof.

The section headings used herein are for organizational purposes only and are not to be construed as limiting the subject matter described.\n\n\n \nCertain Terminology\n\n\n \n \n \nIt is to be understood that the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of any subject matter claimed. In this application, the use of the singular includes the plural unless specifically stated otherwise. It must be noted that, as used in the specification and the appended claims, the singular forms “a,” “an” and “the” include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. In this application, the use of “or” means “and/or” unless stated otherwise. Furthermore, use of the term “including” as well as other forms, such as “include”, “includes,” and “included,” is not limiting.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDefinition of standard chemistry terms are found in reference works, including Carey and Sundberg “A\nDVANCED \nO\n \nRGANIC \n \n \nC\nHEMISTRY\n \n \n \n4\nTH \nED.” Vols. A (2000) and B (2001), Plenum Press, New York. Unless otherwise indicated, conventional methods of mass spectroscopy, NMR, HPLC, protein chemistry, biochemistry, recombinant DNA techniques and pharmacology, within the skill of the art are employed. Unless specific definitions are provided, the nomenclature employed in connection with, and the laboratory procedures and techniques of, analytical chemistry, synthetic organic chemistry, and medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry described herein are those known in the art. Standard techniques are optionally used for chemical syntheses, chemical analyses, pharmaceutical preparation, formulation, and delivery, and treatment of patients. Standard techniques are optionally used for recombinant DNA, oligonucleotide synthesis, and tissue culture and transformation (e.g., electroporation, lipofection). Reactions and purification techniques are performed using documented methodologies or as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is to be understood that the methods and compositions described herein are not limited to the particular methodology, protocols, cell lines, constructs, and reagents described herein and as such optionally vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to limit the scope of the methods and compositions described herein, which will be limited only by the appended claims.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnless stated otherwise, the terms used for complex moieties (i.e., multiple chains of moieties) are to be read equivalently either from left to right or right to left. For example, the group alkylenecycloalkylene refers both to an alkylene group followed by a cycloalkylene group or as a cycloalkylene group followed by an alkylene group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe suffix “ene” appended to a group indicates that such a group is a diradical. By way of example only, a methylene is a diradical of a methyl group, that is, it is a —CH\n2\n— group; and an ethylene is a diradical of an ethyl group, i.e., —CH\n2\nCH\n2\n—.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “alkyl” group refers to an aliphatic hydrocarbon group.

The alkyl moiety also includes an “unsaturated alkyl” moiety, which means that it contains at least one alkene or alkyne moiety. An “alkene” moiety refers to a group that has at least one carbon-carbon double bond, and an “alkyne” moiety refers to a group that has at least one carbon-carbon triple bond. The alkyl moiety, whether saturated or unsaturated, includes branched, straight chain, or cyclic moieties. Depending on the structure, an alkyl group includes a monoradical or a diradical (i.e., an alkylene group), and if a “lower alkyl” having 1 to 6 carbon atoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, C\n1\n-C\nx \nincludes C\n1\n-C\n2\n, C\n1\n-C\n3 \n. . . C\n1\n-C\nx\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe “alkyl” moiety optionally has 1 to 10 carbon atoms (whenever it appears herein, a numerical range such as “1 to 10” refers to each integer in the given range; e.g., “1 to 10 carbon atoms” means that the alkyl group is selected from a moiety having 1 carbon atom, 2 carbon atoms, 3 carbon atoms, etc., up to and including 10 carbon atoms, although the present definition also covers the occurrence of the term “alkyl” where no numerical range is designated). The alkyl group of the compounds described herein may be designated as “C\n1\n-C\n4 \nalkyl” or similar designations. By way of example only, “C\n1\n-C\n4 \nalkyl” indicates that there are one to four carbon atoms in the alkyl chain, i.e., the alkyl chain is selected from among methyl, ethyl, propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, iso-butyl, sec-butyl, and t-butyl. Thus C\n1\n-C\n4 \nalkyl includes C\n1\n-C\n2 \nalkyl and C\n1\n-C\n3 \nalkyl. Alkyl groups are optionally substituted or unsubstituted.

The alkenyl moiety is optionally branched, straight chain, or cyclic (in which case, it is also known as a “cycloalkenyl” group). Depending on the structure, an alkenyl group includes a monoradical or a diradical (i.e., an alkenylene group). Alkenyl groups are optionally substituted. Non-limiting examples of an alkenyl group include —CH═CH\n2\n, —C(CH\n3\n)═CH\n2\n, —CH═CHCH\n3\n, —C(CH\n3\n)═CHCH\n3\n.

Alkenyl groups optionally have 2 to 10 carbons, and if a “lower alkenyl” having 2 to 6 carbon atoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “alkynyl” refers to a type of alkyl group in which the first two atoms of the alkyl group form a triple bond. That is, an alkynyl group begins with the atoms —C≡C—R, wherein R refers to the remaining portions of the alkynyl group, which is either the same or different. The “R” portion of the alkynyl moiety may be branched, straight chain, or cyclic. Depending on the structure, an alkynyl group includes a monoradical or a diradical (i.e., an alkynylene group). Alkynyl groups are optionally substituted. Non-limiting examples of an alkynyl group include, but are not limited to, —C≡CH, —C≡CCH\n3\n, —C≡CCH\n2\nCH\n3\n, —C≡C—, and —C≡CCH\n2\n—.

In some embodiments, an amide moiety forms a linkage between an amino acid or a peptide molecule and a compound described herein, thereby forming a prodrug. Any amine, or carboxyl side chain on the compounds described herein can be amidified. The procedures and specific groups to make such amides are found in sources such as Greene and Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3\nrd \nEd., John Wiley & Sons, New York, N.Y., 1999, which is incorporated herein by reference for this disclosure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “ester” refers to a chemical moiety with formula —COOR, where R is selected from among alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl (bonded through a ring carbon) and heteroalicyclic (bonded through a ring carbon).

Carbocycle includes aryl and cycloalkyl. The term thus distinguishes carbocycle from heterocycle (“heterocyclic”) in which the ring backbone contains at least one atom which is different from carbon (i.e a heteroatom). Heterocycle includes heteroaryl and heterocycloalkyl. Carbocycles and heterocycles can be optionally substituted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “aromatic” refers to a planar ring having a delocalized π-electron system containing 4n+2 π electrons, where n is an integer.

Herein, whenever the number of carbon atoms in a heterocycle is indicated (e.g., C\n1\n-C\n6 \nheterocycle), at least one other atom (the heteroatom) must be present in the ring. Designations such as “C\n1\n-C\n6 \nheterocycle” refer only to the number of carbon atoms in the ring and do not refer to the total number of atoms in the ring. It is understood that the heterocylic ring can have additional heteroatoms in the ring. Designations such as “4-6 membered heterocycle” refer to the total number of atoms that are contained in the ring (i.e., a four, five, or six membered ring, in which at least one atom is a carbon atom, at least one atom is a heteroatom and the remaining two to four atoms are either carbon atoms or heteroatoms). In heterocycles that have two or more heteroatoms, those two or more heteroatoms can be the same or different from one another. Heterocycles can be optionally substituted.

A variety of lymphoma cell lines incubated with a range of concentrations of \nCompound\n 1. (B) presents an illustrative line graph showing inhibition of tumor growth in DLCL2 xenograft models. (C) presents an illustrative line graph showing inhibition of tumor growth in DOHH2 xenograft models. For in vivo lymphoma xenograft studies, 5E6 DOHH2 or DLCL2 cells in 50% matrigel were implanted subcutaneously in SCID mice and dosed orally with \nCompound\n 1 beginning when tumor size reached 100 mm2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 2\n presents an illustrative line graph showing inhibition of collagen-induced arthritis in male DBA/1OlaHsd mice. \nCompound\n 1 or vehicle was dosed orally once per day starting at \nday\n 1. Dexamethasone was included as a positive control. Paw inflammation was scored from 0-5 and averaged across all paws from all animals for each group in the study. \nCompound\n 1 at 12.5 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg regressed inflammation through the end of the study (day 11) while 3.125 mg/kg significantly reduced the increase in paw inflammation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 3\n presents an illustrative line graph showing inhibition of disease progression in a mouse MRL/lpr model of lupus. MRL/lpr mice (Jax strain 000485) were dosed orally once per day from 8 weeks of age until 20 weeks of age and urine protein levels were measured weekly. \nCompound\n 1 at 3.125 mg/kg, 12.5 mg/kg, and 50 mg/kg significantly reduced proteinuria, indicating amelioration of the progressive autoimmune renal failure seen in this mouse strain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 4\n presents an illustrative bar graph showing inhibition of mast cell degranulation in a mouse passive cutaneous anaphylaxis model. 23 hours after mice were sensitized with an intradermal injection of monoclonal anti-DNP-IgE in the back, they received a single oral dose of \nCompound\n 1 or vehicle. After one hour, animals were challenged with an intravenous injection of DNP-BSA and Evans Blue dye and the area of extravasation was measured. Increasing doses of \nCompound\n 1 significantly decreased the amount of Evans Blue release, indicating decreased mast cell activation and vascular permeabilization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 5\n presents an illustrative line graph showing in vivo plasma concentrations post-dosing of male jugular vein cannulated rats with \n \n \n \nCompounds\n \n \n \n 1, 7, 8, and 12. Blood samples were collected at 0.0833 (5 minutes), 0.333 (20 minutes), 1, 3, 6, 9, and 24 hours post-dosing from orally dosed rats. \nCompound\n 1 and Compound 12 have a short half-life in vivo. In contrast, \nCompound\n 7 and \nCompound\n 8 have a significantly longer in vivo half-life. Compounds like 1 and 12 are predicted to have enhanced kinase selectivity in vivo because inhibition will be sustained only for those kinases that are irreversibly inhibited.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 6\n presents an illustrative bar graph showing brief exposure to \nCompound\n 1 in vitro is sufficient to inhibit B cell activation in normal human B cells. B cells were purified from blood from healthy donors by negative selecting using the RosetteSep Human B cell enrichment cocktail. Cells were plated in growth media and indicated concentrations of \nCompound\n 1 were added. After incubation for 1 hour at 37° C., cells were washed three times using an 8-fold dilution in growth media for each wash. Cells were then stimulated with IgM F(ab′)2 for 18 hours at 37° C., stained with anti-CD69-PE antibody and analyzed by flow cytometry. This protocol mimics the predicted exposure of cells to \nCompound\n 1 in vivo and demonstrates that inhibition of B cells is sustained despite washing out of \nCompound\n 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 7\n presents illustrative ACKs, including Btk and Btk cysteine homologs.\n\n\n \n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nIrreversible Inhibitor Compounds\n\n\n \n \n \nIn the following description of irreversible kinase inhibitor compounds suitable for use in the methods described herein, definitions of referred-to standard chemistry terms may be found in reference works (if not otherwise defined herein), including Carey and Sundberg “Advanced Organic Chemistry 4th Ed.” Vols. A (2000) and B (2001), Plenum Press, New York. In addition, nucleic acid and amino acid sequences for Btk (e.g., human Btk) are disclosed in, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,326,469. Unless specific definitions are provided, the nomenclature employed in connection with, and the laboratory procedures and techniques of, analytical chemistry, synthetic organic chemistry, and medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry described herein are those known in the art. Standard techniques can be used for chemical syntheses, chemical analyses, pharmaceutical preparation, formulation, and delivery, and treatment of patients\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe inhibitor compounds described herein are selective for kinases having an accessible cysteine residue (such kinases are also known as Accessible Cysteine Kinases, or ACKs) that can form a covalent bond with a Michael acceptor moiety on the inhibitor compound. In some embodiments, the cysteine residue is accessible or becomes accessible when the binding site moiety of the irreversible inhibitor binds to the kinase. That is, the binding site moiety of the irreversible inhibitor binds to an active site of the ACK and the Michael acceptor moiety of irreversible inhibitor gains access (in one embodiment the step of binding leads to a conformational change in the ACK, thus exposing the cysteine) or is otherwise exposed to the cysteine residue of the ACK; as a result a covalent bond is formed between the “S” of the cysteine residue and the Michael acceptor of the irreversible inhibitor. Consequently, the binding site moiety of the irreversible inhibitor remains bound or otherwise blocks the active site of the ACK.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the ACK is Btk, a homolog of Btk or a tyrosine kinase having a cysteine residue in an amino acid sequence position that is homologous to the amino acid sequence position of \ncysteine\n 481 in Btk. See, e.g., kinases in \nFIG. 7\n. Inhibitor compounds described herein include a Michael acceptor moiety, a binding site moiety and a linker that links the binding site moiety and the Michael acceptor moiety (and in some embodiments, the structure of the linker provides a conformation, or otherwise directs the Michael acceptor moiety, so as to improve the selectivity of the irreversible inhibitor for a particular ACK).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, an irreversible inhibitor compound used in the methods described herein is identified or characterized in an in vitro assay, e.g., an acellular biochemical assay or a cellular functional assay. Such assays are useful to determine an in vitro IC\n50 \nfor an irreversible inhibitor compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, an acellular kinase assay can be used to determine kinase activity after incubation of the kinase in the absence or presence of a range of concentrations of a candidate irreversible inhibitor compound. If the candidate compound is in fact an irreversible inhibitor, kinase activity will not be recovered by repeat washing with inhibitor-free medium. See, e.g., J. B. Smaill, et al. (1999), \nJ. Med. Chem. \n42(10):1803-1815. Further, covalent complex formation between a Kinase and a candidate irreversible inhibitor is a useful indicator of irreversible inhibition of the Kinase that can be readily determined by a number of methods (e.g., mass spectrometry). For example, some irreversible Kinase-inhibitor compounds can form a covalent bond with the aforenoted cysteine residue (e.g., via a Michael reaction).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHigh throughput assays for many acellular biochemical assays (e.g., kinase assays) and cellular functional assays (e.g., calcium flux) are documented methodologies. In addition, high throughput screening systems are commercially available (see, e.g., Zymark Corp., Hopkinton, Mass.; Air Technical Industries, Mentor, Ohio; Beckman Instruments, Inc. Fullerton, Calif.; Precision Systems, Inc., Natick, Mass., etc.). These systems typically automate entire procedures including all sample and reagent pipetting, liquid dispensing, timed incubations, and final readings of the microplate in detector(s) appropriate for the assay. Automated systems thereby allow the identification and characterization of a large number of irreversible compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIrreversible inhibitor compounds can used for the manufacture of a medicament for treating any of the foregoing conditions (e.g., autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, allergy disorders, B-cell proliferative disorders, or thromboembolic disorders).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the irreversible inhibitor compound used for the methods described herein inhibits a Kinase activity with an in vitro IC\n50 \nof less than 10 μM. (e.g., less than 1 μM, less than 0.5 μM, less than 0.4 μM, less than 0.3 μM, less than 0.1, less than 0.08 μM, less than 0.06 μM, less than 0.05 μM, less than 0.04 μM, less than 0.03 μM, less than less than 0.02 μM, less than 0.01, less than 0.008 μM, less than 0.006 μM, less than 0.005 μM, less than 0.004 μM, less than 0.003 μM, less than less than 0.002 μM, less than 0.001, less than 0.00099 μM, less than 0.00098 μM, less than 0.00097 μM, less than 0.00096 μM, less than 0.00095 μM, less than 0.00094 μM, less than 0.00093 μM, less than 0.00092, or less than 0.00090 μM).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the irreversible inhibitor compound selectively and irreversibly inhibits an activated form of its target tyrosine kinase (e.g., a phosphorylated form of the tyrosine kinase). For example, activated Btk is transphosphorylated at tyrosine 551. Thus, in these embodiments the irreversible Btk inhibitor inhibits the target kinase in cells only once the target kinase is activated by the signaling events.\n\n\n \nParticular Irreversible Inhibitor Compounds for ACKs\n\n\n \n \n \nDescribed herein are compounds of any of Formula (A1-A6), Formula (B1-B6), Formula (C1-C6), Formula (D1-D6), Formula (I), or Formula (VII).

Protecting groups are used to block some or all reactive moieties and prevent such groups from participating in chemical reactions until the protective group is removed. In one embodiment, each protective group be removable by a different means. Protective groups that are cleaved under totally disparate reaction conditions fulfill the requirement of differential removal. Protective groups can be removed by acid, base, and hydrogenolysis. Groups such as trityl, dimethoxytrityl, acetal and t-butyldimethylsilyl are acid labile and may be used to protect carboxy and hydroxy reactive moieties in the presence of amino groups protected with Cbz groups, which are removable by hydrogenolysis, and Fmoc groups, which are base labile. Carboxylic acid and hydroxy reactive moieties may be blocked with base labile groups such as, but not limited to, methyl, ethyl, and acetyl in the presence of amines blocked with acid labile groups such as t-butyl carbamate or with carbamates that are both acid and base stable but hydrolytically removable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCarboxylic acid and hydroxy reactive moieties may also be blocked with hydrolytically removable protective groups such as the benzyl group, while amine groups capable of hydrogen bonding with acids may be blocked with base labile groups such as Fmoc. Carboxylic acid reactive moieties may be protected by conversion to simple ester compounds as exemplified herein, or they may be blocked with oxidatively-removable protective groups such as 2,4-dimethoxybenzyl, while co-existing amino groups may be blocked with fluoride labile silyl carbamates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAllyl blocking groups are useful in then presence of acid- and base-protecting groups since the former are stable and can be subsequently removed by metal or pi-acid catalysts. For example, an allyl-blocked carboxylic acid can be deprotected with a Pd\n0\n-catalyzed reaction in the presence of acid labile t-butyl carbamate or base-labile acetate amine protecting groups. Yet another form of protecting group is a resin to which a compound or intermediate may be attached. As long as the residue is attached to the resin, that functional group is blocked and cannot react. Once released from the resin, the functional group is available to react.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypically blocking/protecting groups may be selected from:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther protecting groups, plus a detailed description of techniques applicable to the creation of protecting groups and their removal are described in Greene and Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd Ed., John Wiley & Sons, New York, N.Y., 1999, and Kocienski, Protective Groups, Thieme Verlag, New York, N.Y., 1994, which are incorporated herein by reference for such disclosure.\n\n\n \nSynthesis of Compounds\n\n\n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, provided herein are methods of making and methods of using tyrosine kinase inhibitor compounds described herein.

They may, for instance, be bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent is not. The prodrug may also have improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. An example, without limitation, of a prodrug is a compound described herein, which is administered as an ester (the “prodrug”) to facilitate transmittal across a cell membrane where water solubility is detrimental to mobility but which then is metabolically hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid, the active entity, once inside the cell where water-solubility is beneficial. A further example of a prodrug is a short peptide (polyaminoacid) bonded to an acid group where the peptide is metabolized to reveal the active moiety. In certain embodiments, upon in vivo administration, a prodrug is chemically converted to the biologically, pharmaceutically or therapeutically active form of the compound. In certain embodiments, a prodrug is enzymatically metabolized by one or more steps or processes to the biologically, pharmaceutically or therapeutically active form of the compound. To produce a prodrug, a pharmaceutically active compound is modified such that the active compound will be regenerated upon in vivo administration. The prodrug can be designed to alter the metabolic stability or the transport characteristics of a drug, to mask side effects or toxicity, to improve the flavor of a drug or to alter other characteristics or properties of a drug. By virtue of knowledge of pharmacodynamic processes and drug metabolism in vivo, once a pharmaceutically active compound is known, prodrugs of compounds can be designed (if desired) (for examples of this procedure applied to other compounds, see, e.g., Nogrady (1985) \nMedicinal Chemistry A Biochemical Approach\n, Oxford University Press, New York, pages 388-392; Silverman (1992), The Organic Chemistry of Drug Design and Drug Action, Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, pages 352-401, Saulnier et al., (1994), \nBioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters\n, Vol. 4, p. 1985).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProdrug forms of the herein described compounds, wherein the prodrug is metabolized in vivo to produce a derivative as set forth herein are included within the scope of the claims. In some cases, some of the compounds herein-described are prodrugs for another derivative or active compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProdrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they are easier to administer than the parent drug. They are, for instance, bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent is not. The prodrug optionally has improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. Prodrugs may be designed as reversible drug derivatives, for use as modifiers to enhance drug transport to site-specific tissues. In some embodiments, the design of a prodrug increases the effective water solubility. See, e.g., Fedorak et al., \nAm. J.

Polymorphs include the different crystal packing arrangements of the same elemental composition of a compound. Polymorphs usually have different X-ray diffraction patterns, infrared spectra, melting points, density, hardness, crystal shape, optical and electrical properties, stability, and solubility. Various factors such as the recrystallization solvent, rate of crystallization, and storage temperature may cause a single crystal form to dominate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds described herein are optionally in various forms, including but not limited to, amorphous forms, milled forms and nano-particulate forms. In addition, compounds described herein include crystalline forms, also known as polymorphs.

Up to 518 different kinases have been identified in humans. Many kinase inhibitor compounds non-selectively bind and/or inhibit these kinases because the active sites of some of these kinases are similar in structure. Such cross-reactivity is not a desired feature of a kinase inhibitor compound because of the potential for undesired side effects when such a compound is being administered to treat a disease or condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe have observed that small differences in the structure of kinase inhibitor compounds have profound effects in the selectivity of similarly-structured kinases (e.g., ACKs, including, Btk and the Btk kinase cysteine homologs).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a result, we have developed assays, methods, and systems for converting a non-selective inhibitor compound into a highly-selective inhibitor compound. In brief, the non-selective inhibitor compound is provided with a Michael acceptor moiety and a linker moiety that links the Michael acceptor moiety to the remainder of the non-selective inhibitor compound. A series of linker and Michael acceptor moieties provides a small library/panel of test inhibitor compounds. The inhibitor library/panel is contacted with a panel of structurally related kinases (e.g., Btk and the Btk kinase cysteine homologs). Binding is determined by a variety of means, included fluorescence detection (or via any other detectable label), mass spectrometry, or a combination of approaches. An Activity Probe is optionally used to detect binding of members of the inhibitor library/panel to the kinase library/panel. The binding data is then optionally collected and analyzed to provide a structure-activity relationship (SAR) between the structure of the members of the inhibitor panel/library (e.g., Michael acceptor and/or linker moieties) and the activity of binding to and/or inhibiting members of the kinase panel. Based on this information, further modifications are suggested if necessary. We have successfully used this approach to improve the binding and selectivity of Btk inhibitor compounds (see Examples herein, including “Kinase Inhibitor Discovery Platform” example section).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA similar approach can be use for converting a selective inhibitor compound for a group of similarly-structured ACKs (including, Btk and the Btk kinase cysteine homologs) into a more highly-selective inhibitor compound (e.g., more selective for a particular ACK over structurally-similar ACKs), or for converting a selective inhibitor compound for a particular ACK (e.g., Btk) into an even more selective inhibitor of that particular ACK. For example, in brief, the selective inhibitor compound (which, for example, contains an active-site binding moiety, a linker moiety and a Michael acceptor moiety) is modified. In one embodiment, a series of linker and Michael acceptor moieties provides a small library/panel of test inhibitor compounds. The inhibitor library/panel is contacted with a panel of structurally related kinases (e.g., Btk and the Btk kinase cysteine homologs). Binding is determined by a variety of means, included fluorescence detection (or via any other detectable label), mass spectrometry, or a combination of approaches. An Activity Probe is optionally used to detect binding of members of the inhibitor library/panel to the kinase library/panel. The binding data is then optionally collected and analyzed to provide a structure-activity relationship (SAR) between the structure of the members of the inhibitor panel/library (e.g., Michael acceptor and/or linker moieties) and the activity of binding to and/or inhibiting members of the kinase panel. Based on this information, further modifications are suggested if necessary. We have also successfully used this approach to improve the binding and selectivity of Btk inhibitor compounds (see Examples herein, including “Kinase Inhibitor Discovery Platform” example section).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, for our highly selective \nBTK inhibitor Compound\n 1, we engineered an electrophilic center capable of irreversibly inactivating the target enzyme, BTK. That is, to an active site binding moiety of a reversible inhibitor was added a linker moiety and a Michael acceptor moiety that achieved a high degree of potency and selectivity by (1) fitting the core scaffold into the active site ATP binding pocket of kinase enzymes, and (2) forming a covalent bond with Cysteine-481 located in BTK. The chemistry required for covalent bond formation involves an electrophilic moiety that acts as a Michael acceptor, which bonds with a nucleophile (such as Cys-481) present in a precise location within the active site.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another example, the linker and Michael acceptor moiety of \nCompound\n 1 was modified to provide \nCompound\n 9 which has a different selectivity pattern. Table 1 is a table showing the degree of inhibition of a panel of kinases for two example compounds. IC\n50\ns were determined using the in vitro HotSpot kinase assay (purified enzymes, 33P-ATP, an appropriate substrate and 1 uM ATP.) Compared to \nCompound\n 1, \nCompound\n 9 has similar potency toward Btk, but significantly less potency toward JAK-3, ITK, and EGFR and significantly more potency toward the src-family kinases lck, c-src, FGR, Fyn, Hck, and Lyn and Yes. Thus, subtle modifications in the linker moiety and the Michael acceptor moiety are important for the design of selective ACK inhibitors.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nCompound\n 1\n\n\n \nCompound\n 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nKinase\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBTK\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nITK\n\n\n11.7\n\n\n909.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBmx/ETK\n\n\n0.8\n\n\n1.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTEC\n\n\n77.8\n\n\n108.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nEFGR\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n20.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHER2\n\n\n9.4\n\n\n1536.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHER4\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n3.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLCK\n\n\n2.0\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBLK\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nC-src\n\n\n262.6\n\n\n14.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFGR\n\n\n2.3\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFyn\n\n\n95.6\n\n\n7.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHCK\n\n\n3.7\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLyn\n\n\n16.2\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYES\n\n\n6.5\n\n\n0.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nABL\n\n\n86.1\n\n\n32.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBrk\n\n\n3.3\n\n\n3.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCSK\n\n\n2.2\n\n\n2.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFER\n\n\n8,070.0\n\n\n3,346.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nJAK3\n\n\n10.4\n\n\n8,278.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSYK\n\n\n>10,000\n\n\n>10,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTable 2 of Example 1c in the “Kinase Discovery Platform and Pulse Dosing” section of the examples section provides further modifications of the linker moiety and/or the Michael acceptor moiety and the impact of such changes of inhibitor selectivity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, in one aspect described herein are methods of identifying an irreversible inhibitor of a kinase selected from Btk, a Btk homolog, or a Btk kinase cysteine homolog (or indeed, any ACK) comprising:\n\n \n \n \n \n \n(1) contacting a multiplicity of kinases selected from Btk, a Btk homolog, or a Btk kinase cysteine homolog (or indeed any ACK) with a compound that comprises a Michael acceptor moiety;\n \n(2) contacting at least one non-kinase molecule having at least one accessible SH group with the compound that comprises a Michael acceptor moiety (this step allows for the selection of inhibitors that have low selectivity for higher abundance biological molecules that have moieties that irreversibly react with the inhibitor; thus preventing the inhibitor from binding to the desire ACK when administered as a drug to a patient); and\n \n(3) determining the covalent binding of the compound that comprises a Michael acceptor with the multiplicity of kinases and the at least one non-kinase molecule; and\n \nrepeating steps (1), (2), and (3) for at least one other compound that comprises a Michael acceptor moiety.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn a further aspect, the following steps are added: (4) comparing the covalent binding of the compound that comprises a Michael acceptor with the multiplicity of kinases and the at least one non-kinase molecule; and repeating steps (1), (2), (3) and (4) for at least one other compound that comprises a Michael acceptor moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further aspect the irreversible inhibitor compounds are also contacted with at least one non-ACK kinase in order to determine the selectivity of the irreversible inhibitor compound for the ACK relative to the non-ACK.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy way of certain relevant examples of non-kinase molecules with at least one accessible SH group are glutathione and/or hemoglobin. Because of the high abundance of these molecules in typical biological systems (e.g., in a patient), the desired irreversible inhibitor compounds have low selectivity/reactivity with these non-kinase molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments of the Kinase Inhibitor Discovery Platform, an Activity Probe (described in more detail herein) is used as a rapid diagnostic method for determining whether a test inhibitor compound has irreversibly inhibited an ACK. In one embodiment, the Activity Probe is itself an irreversible inhibitor of an ACK, and further, has a reporter moiety (e.g., a fluorescent moiety) as part of its structure. When used in competition with a test irreversible inhibitor, the absence of a ‘reporter’ signal on an ACK is one indication that the test irreversible inhibitor has prevented the Activity Probe from binding to the ACK (and that the test irreversible inhibitor has a higher binding affinity for the ACK than the Activity Probe).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the Kinase Inhibitor Discovery Platform, steps (1) and (2) are conducted in vivo and step (3) is conducted in part using an Activity Probe. Further, in certain embodiments, the determining step uses mass spectrometry, fluorescence, or a combination thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs described herein, in one embodiment, the inhibitor tested with the Kinase Inhibitor Discovery Platform comprise an active site binding moiety, a Michael acceptor moiety, and a linker moiety that links the Michael acceptor moiety to the active site binding moiety. For example, in such a scheme, the following information is collected and analyzed: the structure-function activity relationship between the structure of the linker moiety and/or the Michael acceptor moiety of each compound, and the binding and/or selectivity of each compound to at least one kinase. Further, in certain embodiments, structure of the active site binding moiety of each compound is not varied, whereas the structure of the linker moiety and/or the Michael acceptor moiety is varied.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one example, the inhibitors have the structure of Formula (VII):\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nwherein\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nis a moiety that binds to the active site of a kinase, including a tyrosine kinase, further including a Btk kinase cysteine homolog;\n\n \n \n \n \n \nY is an optionally substituted group selected from among alkylene, heteroalkylene, arylene, heteroarylene, heterocycloalkylene, cycloalkylene, alkylenearylene, alkyleneheteroarylene, alkylenecycloalkylene, and alkyleneheterocycloalkylene;\n \nZ is C(═O), OC(═O), NHC(═O), NCH\n3\nC(═O), C(═S), S(═O)\nx\n, OS(═O)\nx\n, NHS(═O)\nx\n, where x is 1 or 2;\n \nR\n7 \nand R\n8 \nare independently selected from among H, unsubstituted C\n1\n-C\n4 \nalkyl, substituted C\n1\n-C\n4\nalkyl, unsubstituted C\n1\n-C\n4\nheteroalkyl, substituted C\n1\n-C\n4\nheteroalkyl, unsubstituted C\n3\n-C\n6\ncycloalkyl, substituted C\n3\n-C\n6\ncycloalkyl, unsubstituted C\n2\n-C\n6\nheterocycloalkyl, and substituted C\n2\n-C\n6\nheterocycloalkyl; or\n \nR\n7 \nand R\n8 \ntaken together form a bond; and\n \nR\n6 \nis H, substituted or unsubstituted C\n1\n-C\n4\nalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted C\n1\n-C\n4\nheteroalkyl, C\n1\n-C\n6\nalkoxyalkyl, C\n1\n-C\n8\nalkylaminoalkyl, C\n1\n-C\n8\nhydroxyalkylaminoalkyl, C\n1\n-C\n8\nalkoxyalkylaminoalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted C\n3\n-C\n6\ncycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, substituted or unsubstituted C\n2\n-C\n8\nheterocycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl, C\n1\n-C\n4\nalkyl(aryl), C\n1\n-C\n4\nalkyl(heteroaryl), C\n1\n-C\n4\nalkyl(C\n3\n-C\n8\ncycloalkyl), or C\n1\n-C\n4\nalkyl(C\n2\n-C\n8\nheterocycloalkyl).\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn such a scheme, the following information is collected and analyzed: the structure-function activity relationship between the structure of Y-Z and/or\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nof each compound, and the binding and/or selectivity of each compound to at least one kinase.

In some embodiments, this selectivity is at least 5×, at least 10×, at least 20×, at least 50×, or at least 100×.

In one embodiment, the Kinase Inhibitor is an irreversible inhibitor. In another embodiment, the irreversible Kinase Inhibitor binds to a non-catalytic residue in the ATP binding pocket of Btk, a Btk homolog and/or a Btk kinase cysteine homolog (hereinafter a “Kinase”); in further embodiments, the non-catalytic residue is a cysteine residue. In some embodiments, the Activity Probe forms a covalent bond with at least one non-catalytic residue of a Kinase. In other embodiments, the Activity Probe forms a non-covalent bond with at least one non-catalytic residue of a Kinase. In a further embodiment, the Activity Probe forms hydrogen bonding within the ATP binding pocket of a Kinase. In yet a further embodiment, the Activity Probe has Van der Waals attractions with the Kinase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some other embodiments, the Activity Probes described herein are activity dependent such that the probe binds only an active Kinase. In further embodiments, the Activity Probe binds a Kinase that has been switched on by phosphorylation by upstream kinases.

In other embodiments, spacers are selected on the basis of a variety of characteristics including their hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, molecular flexibility and length. The spacer, thus, in some embodiments, comprises a chain of carbon atoms optionally interrupted or terminated with one or more heteroatoms, such as oxygen atoms, nitrogen atoms, and/or sulphur atoms. Thus, in some embodiments, the spacer comprises one or more amide, ester, amino, ether, and/or thioether functionalities, and optionally aromatic or mono/polyunsaturated hydrocarbons, polyoxyethylene such as polyethylene glycol, oligo/polyamides such as poly-.α-alanine, polyglycine, polylysine, and peptides in general, oligosaccharides, oligo/polyphosphates. Moreover, in other embodiments, the spacer consists of combined units thereof. In further embodiments, the length of the spacer varies, taking into consideration the desired or necessary positioning and spatial orientation of the active/functional part of the Activity Probe.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWithout limiting the scope of the compositions described herein, in some embodiments the reporter moiety is Bodipy. In the present context, the term reporter moiety means a group which is detectable either by itself or as a part of a detection series.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the labeled Activity Probes described herein are purified by one or more procedures including, but are not limited to, affinity chromatography; anion- or cation-exchange chromatography (using, including but not limited to, DEAE SEPHAROSE); chromatography on silica; reverse phase HPLC; gel filtration (using, including but not limited to, SEPHADEX G-75); hydrophobic interaction chromatography; size-exclusion chromatography, metal-chelate chromatography; ultrafiltration/diafiltration; ethanol precipitation; ammonium sulfate precipitation; chromatofocusing; displacement chromatography; electrophoretic procedures (including but not limited to preparative isoelectric focusing), differential solubility (including but not limited to ammonium sulfate precipitation), or extraction. In other embodiments, apparent molecular weight is estimated by GPC by comparison to globular protein standards (P\nROTEIN PURIFICATION METHODS, A PRACTICAL APPROACH \n(Harris & Angal, Eds.) IRL Press 1989, 293-306).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the in vitro inhibitory potency of a probe against a panel of selected Kinases as a rapid means of confirming accessibility of the reactive moiety to the Kinase active site is tested. By way of example only, although less potent than the \nparent Compound\n 2, the illustrative probe of \nCompound\n 3 retains potency against Btk (IC\n50\n˜90 nM). Thus, the piperazine linker and bodipy fluorophore do not seriously compromise accessibility of the illustrative probe to the enzyme active site.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Activity Probes described herein label kinases at the non-catalytic Cys 481 (or a homologous cysteine) and that in some embodiments, probe labeling does not require the catalytic machinery per se. As such it differs from canonical activity-based probes that target the enzyme catalytic machinery directly. In some embodiments, the Kinase undergoes a phosphorylation dependent conformational change that is tightly coupled to ATP binding and kinase activation. In some embodiments, effective labeling by a probe requires the Kinase to be in its active conformation in order to directly detect Kinase activity in cells. In other embodiments, effective labeling by a Activity Probe does not require the Kinase to be in its active conformation in order to directly detect Kinase activity in cells.\n\n\n \nTherapeutic Uses of Irreversible Inhibitor Compounds\n\n\n \n \n \nDescribed herein are methods, compositions, uses and medicaments for the treatment of disorders comprising administering to a patient in need an irreversible inhibitor of an ACK.

Dey et al. (2006), Cytojournal 3(24), and the “Revised European American Lymphoma” (REAL) classification system (see, e.g., the website maintained by the National Cancer Institute).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA number of animal models are useful for establishing a range of therapeutically effective doses of irreversible inhibitors, including irreversible Btk inhibitor compounds for treating any of the foregoing diseases. For example, refer to Examples 1-4 of the “Therapeutic Uses” section of the Examples included herein. Also, for example, dosing of irreversible inhibitor compounds for treating an autoimmune disease can be assessed in a mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis. In this model, arthritis is induced in Balb/c mice by administering anti-collagen antibodies and lipopolysaccharide. See Nandakumar et al. (2003), \nAm. J. Pathol \n163:1827-1837. In another example, dosing of irreversible inhibitors for the treatment of B-cell proliferative disorders can be examined in, e.g., a human-to-mouse xenograft model in which human B-cell lymphoma cells (e.g. Ramos cells) are implanted into immunodeficient mice (e.g., “nude” mice) as described in, e.g., Pagel et al. (2005), Clin Cancer Res 11(13):4857-4866. Animal models for treatment of thromboembolic disorders are also known.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the therapeutic efficacy of the compound for one of the foregoing diseases is optimized during a course of treatment. For example, a subject being treated optionally undergoes a diagnostic evaluation to correlate the relief of disease symptoms or pathologies to inhibition of in vivo Btk activity achieved by administering a given dose of an irreversible Btk inhibitor. Cellular assays are used to determine in vivo activity of Btk in the presence or absence of an irreversible Btk inhibitor. For example, since activated Btk is phosphorylated at tyrosine 223 (Y223) and tyrosine 551 (Y551), phospho-specific immunocytochemical staining of P-Y223 or P-Y551-positive cells are used to detect or quantify activation of Bkt in a population of cells (e.g., by FACS analysis of stained vs unstained cells). See, e.g., Nisitani et al. (1999), \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci, USA \n96:2221-2226. Thus, the amount of the Btk inhibitor inhibitor compound that is administered to a subject is optionally increased or decreased as needed so as to maintain a level of Btk inhibition optimal for treating the subject's disease state.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment are methods for identifying biomarkers suitable for determining patient response to an irreversible ACK inhibitor (including, e.g., a compound of Formula (I)) comprising administering to a test subject a composition containing an amount of the irreversible ACK inhibitor (including, e.g., a compound of Formula (I)) sufficient to inhibit B cell receptor signaling and correlating B cell receptor signaling with apoptosis. In another or further embodiment are methods for selecting a patient for treatment for lymphoma with an irreversible ACK inhibitor (including, e.g., a compound of Formula (I)) comprising measuring pErk or Erk transcriptional target levels in a patient sample, and correlating a high level of transcriptional targets with a positive response to the treatment. In another or further embodiments are methods for measuring a patient's response to treatment comprising administering to the patient an irreversible ACK inhibitor (including, e.g., a compound of Formula (I)), measuring pErk or Erk transcriptional target levels in a patient sample, and correlating a reduced level of transcriptional targets with a positive response to the administration of the irreversible ACK inhibitor (including, e.g., a compound of Formula (I)).\n\n\n \nCombination Treatments\n\n\n \n \n \nThe irreversible Btk inhibitor compositions described herein can also be used in combination with other well known therapeutic reagents that are selected for their therapeutic value for the condition to be treated. In general, the compositions described herein and, in embodiments where combinational therapy is employed, other agents do not have to be administered in the same pharmaceutical composition, and are optionally, because of different physical and chemical characteristics, have to be administered by different routes. The initial administration is made, for example, according to established protocols, and then, based upon the observed effects, the dosage, modes of administration and times of administration are modified.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain instances, it is appropriate to administer at least one irreversible Btk inhibitor compound described herein in combination with another therapeutic agent. By way of example only, if one of the side effects experienced by a patient upon receiving one of the irreversible Btk inhibitor compounds described herein is nausea, then it is appropriate to administer an anti-nausea agent in combination with the initial therapeutic agent. Or, by way of example only, the therapeutic effectiveness of one of the compounds described herein is enhanced by administration of an adjuvant (i.e., by itself the adjuvant has minimal therapeutic benefit, but in combination with another therapeutic agent, the overall therapeutic benefit to the patient is enhanced). Or, by way of example only, the benefit experienced by a patient is increased by administering one of the compounds described herein with another therapeutic agent (which also includes a therapeutic regimen) that also has therapeutic benefit. In any case, regardless of the disease, disorder or condition being treated, the overall benefit experienced by the patient is in some embodiments simply additive of the two therapeutic agents or in other embodiments, the patient experiences a synergistic benefit.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe particular choice of compounds used will depend upon the diagnosis of the attending physicians and their judgment of the condition of the patient and the appropriate treatment protocol. The compounds are optionally administered concurrently (e.g., simultaneously, essentially simultaneously or within the same treatment protocol) or sequentially, depending upon the nature of the disease, disorder, or condition, the condition of the patient, and the actual choice of compounds used. The determination of the order of administration, and the number of repetitions of administration of each therapeutic agent during a treatment protocol, is based on an evaluation of the disease being treated and the condition of the patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherapeutically-effective dosages can vary when the drugs are used in treatment combinations. Methods for experimentally determining therapeutically-effective dosages of drugs and other agents for use in combination treatment regimens are described in the literature. For example, the use of metronomic dosing, i.e., providing more frequent, lower doses in order to minimize toxic side effects, has been described extensively in the literature Combination treatment further includes periodic treatments that start and stop at various times to assist with the clinical management of the patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor combination therapies described herein, dosages of the co-administered compounds will of course vary depending on the type of co-drug employed, on the specific drug employed, on the disease or condition being treated and so forth. In addition, when co-administered with one or more biologically active agents, the compound provided herein may be administered either simultaneously with the biologically active agent(s), or sequentially. If administered sequentially, the attending physician will decide on the appropriate sequence of administering protein in combination with the biologically active agent(s).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn any case, the multiple therapeutic agents (one of which is a compound of Formula (A1-A6), (B1-B6), (C1-C6), or (D1-D6) described herein) are optionally administered in any order or even simultaneously. If simultaneously, the multiple therapeutic agents are optionally provided in a single, unified form, or in multiple forms (by way of example only, either as a single pill or as two separate pills). One of the therapeutic agents may be given in multiple doses, or both may be given as multiple doses. If not simultaneous, the timing between the multiple doses may vary from more than zero weeks to less than four weeks. In addition, the combination methods, compositions and formulations are not to be limited to the use of only two agents; the use of multiple therapeutic combinations are also envisioned.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is understood that the dosage regimen to treat, prevent, or ameliorate the condition(s) for which relief is sought, can be modified in accordance with a variety of factors. These factors include the disorder from which the subject suffers, as well as the age, weight, sex, diet, and medical condition of the subject. Thus, the dosage regimen actually employed can vary widely and therefore can deviate from the dosage regimens set forth herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical agents which make up the combination therapy disclosed herein may be a combined dosage form or in separate dosage forms intended for substantially simultaneous administration. The pharmaceutical agents that make up the combination therapy may also be administered sequentially, with either therapeutic compound being administered by a regimen calling for two-step administration. The two-step administration regimen may call for sequential administration of the active agents or spaced-apart administration of the separate active agents. The time period between the multiple administration steps may range from, a few minutes to several hours, depending upon the properties of each pharmaceutical agent, such as potency, solubility, bioavailability, plasma half-life and kinetic profile of the pharmaceutical agent. Circadian variation of the target molecule concentration may also determine the optimal dose interval.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, the compounds described herein also are optionally used in combination with procedures that provide additional or synergistic benefit to the patient. By way of example only, patients are expected to find therapeutic and/or prophylactic benefit in the methods described herein, wherein pharmaceutical composition of a compound disclosed herein and/or combinations with other therapeutics are combined with genetic testing to determine whether that individual is a carrier of a mutant gene that is known to be correlated with certain diseases or conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds described herein and combination therapies can be administered before, during or after the occurrence of a disease or condition, and the timing of administering the composition containing a compound can vary. Thus, for example, the compounds can be used as a prophylactic and can be administered continuously to subjects with a propensity to develop conditions or diseases in order to prevent the occurrence of the disease or condition. The compounds and compositions can be administered to a subject during or as soon as possible after the onset of the symptoms. The administration of the compounds can be initiated within the first 48 hours of the onset of the symptoms, within the first 6 hours of the onset of the symptoms, or within 3 hours of the onset of the symptoms. The initial administration can be via any route practical, such as, for example, an intravenous injection, a bolus injection, infusion over 5 minutes to about 5 hours, a pill, a capsule, transdermal patch, buccal delivery, and the like, or combination thereof.

In some embodiments, intermittent dosing is as effective as regular dosing. In further or alternative embodiments, the irreversible kinase inhibitor is administered only when the patient exhibits a particular symptom, e.g., the onset of pain, or the onset of a fever, or the onset of an inflammation, or the onset of a skin disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the case wherein the patient's condition does not improve, upon the doctor's discretion the administration of the compounds may be administered chronically, that is, for an extended period of time, including throughout the duration of the patient's life in order to ameliorate or otherwise control or limit the symptoms of the patient's disease or condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the case wherein the patient's status does improve, upon the doctor's discretion the administration of the compounds may be given continuously; alternatively, the dose of drug being administered may be temporarily reduced or temporarily suspended for a certain length of time (i.e., a “drug holiday”). The length of the drug holiday can vary between 2 days and 1 year, including by way of example only, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days, 7 days, 10 days, 12 days, 15 days, 20 days, 28 days, 35 days, 50 days, 70 days, 100 days, 120 days, 150 days, 180 days, 200 days, 250 days, 280 days, 300 days, 320 days, 350 days, or 365 days. The dose reduction during a drug holiday may be from 10%-100%, including, by way of example only, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 100%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOnce improvement of the patient's conditions has occurred, a maintenance dose is administered if necessary. Subsequently, the dosage or the frequency of administration, or both, can be reduced, as a function of the symptoms, to a level at which the improved disease, disorder or condition is retained. Patients can, however, require intermittent treatment on a long-term basis upon any recurrence of symptoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of a given agent that will correspond to such an amount will vary depending upon factors such as the particular compound, disease or condition and its severity, the identity (e.g., weight) of the subject or host in need of treatment, and is determined according to the particular circumstances surrounding the case, including, e.g., the specific agent being administered, the route of administration, the condition being treated, and the subject or host being treated. In general, however, doses employed for adult human treatment will typically be in the range of 0.02-5000 mg per day, or from about 1-1500 mg per day. The desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered simultaneously (or over a short period of time) or at appropriate intervals, for example as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical composition described herein may be in unit dosage forms suitable for single administration of precise dosages. In unit dosage form, the formulation is divided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of one or more compound. The unit dosage may be in the form of a package containing discrete quantities of the formulation. Non-limiting examples are packaged tablets or capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. Aqueous suspension compositions can be packaged in single-dose non-reclosable containers. Alternatively, multiple-dose reclosable containers can be used, in which case it is typical to include a preservative in the composition. By way of example only, formulations for parenteral injection may be presented in unit dosage form, which include, but are not limited to ampoules, or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe foregoing ranges are merely suggestive, as the number of variables in regard to an individual treatment regime is large, and considerable excursions from these recommended values are not uncommon. Such dosages may be altered depending on a number of variables, not limited to the activity of the compound used, the disease or condition to be treated, the mode of administration, the requirements of the individual subject, the severity of the disease or condition being treated, and the judgment of the practitioner.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nToxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such therapeutic regimens can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, including, but not limited to, the determination of the LD\n50 \n(the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED\n50 \n(the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between the toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio between LD\n50 \nand ED\n50\n. Compounds exhibiting high therapeutic indices are preferred. The data obtained from cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in human. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED\n50 \nwith minimal toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized.\n\n\n \nDosing Strategies to Increase Selectivity\n\n\n \n \n \nDescribed herein are irreversible kinase inhibitors that are selective for one or more ACKs, including a Btk, a Btk homolog, and a Btk kinase cysteine homolog. In some embodiments, the irreversible inhibitors described herein also bind reversibly to other kinases (some of which, in some embodiments, are also ACKs). As a means of enhancing the selectivity profile, such inhibitors are formulated (formulation includes chemical modifications of the inhibitor, use of excipients in a pharmaceutical composition, and combinations thereof) such that the pharmacokinetic profile favors enhanced selectivity of the inhibitors for an ACK over a non-ACK. By way of example only, an ACK is formulated to have a short plasma half-life. In other embodiments, an ACK is formulated to have an extended plasma half-life.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, as shown in the Examples, \nCompound\n 1 and Compound 12 have a short half-life in vivo. In contrast, \nCompound\n 7 and \nCompound\n 8 have a significantly longer in vivo half-life (\nFIG. 5\n). Compounds like 1 and 12 are predicted to have enhanced kinase selectivity in vivo because inhibition will be sustained only for those kinases that are irreversibly inhibited. Further, given that the irreversible kinase inhibitors described herein have both reversible (in general to non-ACKs) and irreversible (generally, to ACKs) activities, in vivo properties of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) are selected in order to optimize the therapeutic index. Specifically, in some embodiments, rapidly cleared compounds cause only brief inhibition of reversibly inhibited targets while maintaining sustained inhibition of irreversibly inhibited targets. Depending on the degree to which sustained inhibition of particular targets results in therapeutic effects or toxicities, we identify compounds with an optimal combination of in vitro selectivity profiles and in vivo ADME properties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment are kinase inhibitors that selectively and irreversibly binds to a protein tyrosine kinase selected from Btk, a Btk homolog, and a Btk kinase cysteine homolog, in which the kinase inhibitor reversibly and non-selectively binds to a multiplicity of protein tyrosine kinases, and further in which the plasma half life of the kinase inhibitor is less than about 4 hours. In such an embodiment, the kinase inhibitor selectively and irreversibly binds to at least one of Btk, Jak3, Blk, Bmx, Tec, and Itk.

In a further embodiment, the kinase inhibitor selectively and irreversibly binds to Tec. In a further embodiment, the kinase inhibitor selectively and irreversibly binds to Btk and Tec. In a further embodiment, the kinase inhibitor selectively and irreversibly binds to Blk. In a further embodiment, the kinase inhibitor reversibly and non-selectively binds to a multiplicity of src-family protein kinase inhibitors. In a further embodiment, the kinase inhibitor the plasma half life of the kinase inhibitor is greater than about 16 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one particular embodiment of any of the aforementioned kinase inhibitors, such kinase inhibitors have the structure of Formula (VII):\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein:\n\n\nwherein\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nis a moiety that binds to the active site of a kinase, including a tyrosine kinase, further including a Btk kinase cysteine homolog;\n\n\nY is an optionally substituted group selected from among alkylene, heteroalkylene, arylene, heteroarylene, heterocycloalkylene, cycloalkylene, alkylenearylene, alkyleneheteroarylene, alkylenecycloalkylene, and alkyleneheterocycloalkylene;\n\n\nZ is C(═O), OC(═O), NHC(═O), NCH\n3\nC(═O), C(═S), S(═O)\nx\n, OS(═O)\nx\n, NHS(═O)\nx\n, where x is 1 or 2;\n\n\nR\n7 \nand R\n8 \nare independently selected from among H, unsubstituted C\n1\n-C\n4 \nalkyl, substituted C\n1\n-C\n4\nalkyl, unsubstituted C\n1\n-C\n4\nheteroalkyl, substituted C\n1\n-C\n4\nheteroalkyl, unsubstituted C\n3\n-C\n6\ncycloalkyl, substituted C\n3\n-C\n6\ncycloalkyl, unsubstituted C\n2\n-C\n6\nheterocycloalkyl, and substituted C\n2\n-C\n6\nheterocycloalkyl; or\n\n\nR\n7 \nand R\n8 \ntaken together form a bond;\n\n\nR\n6 \nis H, substituted or unsubstituted C\n1\n-C\n4\nalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted C\n1\n-C\n4\nheteroalkyl, C\n1\n-C\n6\nalkoxyalkyl, C\n1\n-C\n8\nalkylaminoalkyl, C\n1\n-C\n8\nhydroxyalkylaminoalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted C\n3\n-C\n6\ncycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, substituted or unsubstituted C\n2\n-C\n8\nheterocycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl, C\n1\n-C\n4\nalkyl(aryl), C\n1\n-C\n4\nalkyl(heteroaryl), C\n1\n-C\n4\nalkyl(C\n3\n-C\n8\ncycloalkyl), or C\n1\n-C\n4\nalkyl(C\n2\n-C\n8\nheterocycloalkyl); and\n\n\npharmaceutically active metabolites, or pharmaceutically acceptable solvates, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, or pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs thereof.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment,\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \non the kinase inhibitor is a substituted fused biaryl moiety selected from\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment of such kinases:\n\n\n \nZ is C(═O), NHC(═O), NCH\n3\nC(═O), or S(═O)\n2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \nThe kinase inhibitor of claim \n49\n, wherein:\n\n\neach of R\n7 \nand R\n8 \nis H; or\n\n\nR\n7 \nand R\n8 \ntaken together form a bond.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment of such kinases:\n\n\n \n \nR\n6 \nis H, substituted or unsubstituted C\n1\n-C\n4\nalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted C\n1\n-C\n4\nheteroalkyl, C\n1\n-C\n6\nalkoxyalkyl, C\n1\n-C\n8\nalkylaminoalkyl, C\n1\n-C\n8\nhydroxyalkylaminoalkyl, C\n1\n-C\n8\nalkoxyalkylaminoalkyl, C\n1\n-C\n4\nalkyl(aryl), C\n1\n-C\n4\nalkyl(heteroaryl), C\n1\n-C\n4\nalkyl(C\n3\n-C\n8\ncycloalkyl), or C\n1\n-C\n4\nalkyl(C\n2\n-C\n8\nheterocycloalkyl).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment of such kinases:\n\n\n \n \nY is a 4-, 5-, 6-, or 7-membered cycloalkylene ring; or\n\n\nY is a 4-, 5-, 6-, or 7-membered heterocycloalkylene ring; or\n\n\nY is a C\n1\n-C\n4 \nalkylene, or 4-, 5-, 6-, or 7-membered heterocycloalkylene ring.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect of such dosing methods are pharmaceutical formulations comprising any of the aforementioned ACK inhibitors and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.

Briefly, 4-phenoxybenzoic acid (48 g) is added to thionyl chloride (100 mL) and heated under gentle reflux for 1 hour. Thionyl chloride is removed by distillation, the residual oil dissolved in toluene and volatile material removed at 80° C./20 mbar. The resulting acid chloride is dissolved in toluene (200 mL) and tetrahydrofuran (35 mL). Malononitrile (14.8 g) is added and the solution and stirred at −10° C. while adding diisopropylethylethylamine (57.9 g) in toluene (150 mL), while maintaining the temperature below 0° C. After 1 hour at 0° C., the mixture is stirred at 20° C. overnight. Amine hydrochloride is removed by filtration and the filtrate evaporated in vacuo. The residue is taken up in ethyl acetate and washed with 1.25 M sulphuric acid, then with brine and dried over sodium sulfate. Evaporation of the solvents gives a semisolid residue which is treated with a little ethyl acetate to give 4.1 g of 1,1-dicyano-2-hydroxy-2-(4-phenoxyphenyl)ethene as a white solid (m.p. 160-162° C.). The filtrate on evaporation gives 56.58 (96%) of 1,1-dicyano-2-hydroxy-2-(4-phenoxyphenyl)ethene as a grey-brown solid, which is sufficiently pure for further use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n1,1-Dicyano-2-hydroxy-2-(4-phenoxyphenyl)ethene (56.5 g) in acetonitrile (780 mL) and methanol (85 mL) is stirred under nitrogen at 0° C. while adding diisopropylethylamine (52.5 mL) followed by 2M trimethylsilyldiazomethane (150 mL) in THF. The reaction is stirred for 2 days at 20° C., and then 2 g of silica is added (for chromatography). The brown-red solution is evaporated in vacuo, the residue dissolved in ethyl acetate and washed well with water then brine, dried and evaporated. The residue is extracted with diethyl ether (3×250 mL), decanting from insoluble oil. Evaporation of the ether extracts gives 22.5 g of 1,1-dicyano-2-methoxy-2-(4-phenoxyphenyl)ethene as a pale orange solid. The insoluble oil is purified by flash chromatography to give 15.0 g of a red-orange oil.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n1,1-Dicyano-2-methoxy-2-(4-phenoxyphenyl)ethene (22.5 g) and 1,1-dicyano-2-methoxy-2-(4-phenoxyphenyl)ethene oil (15 g) are treated with a solution of hydrazine hydrate (18 mL) in ethanol (25 mL) and heated on the steambath for 1 hour. Ethanol (15 mL) is added followed by water (10 mL). The precipitated solid is collected and washed with ethanol:water (4:1) and then dried in air to give 3-amino-4-cyano-5-(4-phenoxyphenyl)pyrazole as a pale orange solid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n3-Amino-4-cyano-5-(4-phenoxyphenyl)pyrazole (29.5 g) is suspended in formamide (300 mL) and heated under nitrogen at 180° C. for 4 hours.

(R)-tert-butyl 2-(hydroxymethyl)pyrrolidine-1-carboxylate (0.5 g; 1.5 equivalents) was added to the mixture followed by the addition of diisopropyl diazodicarboxylate (0.5 mL). The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 4 hr. The reaction mixture was concentrated and purified by flash chromatography (acetone/CH\n2\nCl\n2\n=1/1) to give intermediate 3 (1.49 g).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntermediate 3 (1.49 g) was treated with 4 mL of TFA and 5 mL of CH\n2\nCl\n2 \nand stirred overnight at room temperature and then concentrated to dryness.

A variety of lymphoma cell lines were incubated with a range of concentrations of \nCompound\n 1 to determine the GI50, the concentration that results in 50% decrease in cell proliferation (\nFIG. 1A\n). \nCompound\n 1 inhibits tumor growth in DOHH2 and DLCL2 xenograft models (\nFIGS. 1B and 1C\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor in vitro cell proliferation assays, cells were seeded in 96-well plates in standard growth media (in most cases RPMI+10% fetal calf serum) and \nCompound\n 1 was added in a 9-point dilution series ranging from 10 uM to 0.04 uM with DMSO at 0.1% final concentration in all wells. After 72 hours, cell number was measured using Alamar Blue using manufacturer's protocol. A dilution series of untreated cells was run in parallel to verify that the Alamar Blue assay reliably reflected cell number and that growth conditions were not limiting. The GI50, the concentration that results in a 50% decrease in cell number, was calculated using Calcusyn to fit the dose-response curve. GI50 values were confirmed in two or more separate experiments for each cell line.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor in vivo lymphoma xenograft studies, 5E6 DOHH2 or DLCL2 cells in 50% matrigel were implanted subcutaneously in SCID mice and dosed orally with \nCompound\n 1 beginning when tumor size reached 100 mm2\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\nInhibition of Collagen-Induced Arthritis in a Mouse\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompound\n 1 inhibits collagen-induced arthritis in the mouse. Male DBA/1OlaHsd mice were injected intradermally with 150 microliters of 2 mg/mL Type II collagen in Freund's complete adjuvant with supplemental \nM. tuberculosis, \n4 mg/mL and boosted with the same injection 21 days later. After paw inflammation was established, animals were randomized and \nCompound\n 1 or vehicle was dosed orally once per day starting at \nday\n 1. Paw inflammation was scored from 0-5 and averaged across all paws from all animals for each group in the study. \nCompound\n 1 at 12.5 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg regressed inflammation through the end of the study (day 11) while 3.125 mg/kg significantly reduced the increase in paw inflammation (\nFIG. 2\n). Dexamethasone was included as a positive control.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another study, \nCompound\n 1 was dosed at 12.5 mg/kg to such mice over: (a) each day of an 11-day period; (b) \n \n \ndays\n \n \n 1, 2, and 3 of an 11-day period; or (c) \n \n \ndays\n \n \n 9, 10, and 11 of an 11-day period. Intermittent dosing reduced the increase in paw inflammation. In addition, \nCompound\n 9 was dosed to such mice at a level of 12.5 mg/kg or 50 mg/kg each day of an 11-day period. \nCompound\n 9 reduced the increase in paw inflammation.\n\n\n \nExample 3\n\n\nInhibition of Lupus in a Mouse Model\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompound\n 1 inhibits disease progression in the mouse MRL/lpr model of lupus. \nCompound\n 1 at 3.125 mg/kg, 12.5 mg/kg, and 50 mg/kg significantly reduced proteinuria, indicating amelioration of the progressive autoimmune renal failure seen in this mouse strain (\nFIG. 3\n). MRL/lpr mice (Jax strain 000485) were dosed orally once per day from 12 weeks of age until 20 weeks of age and urine protein levels were measured weekly using Clinitech Multistick dipstick.\n\n\n \nExample 4\n\n\nInhibition of Mast Cell Degranulation\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompound\n 1 inhibits mast cell degranulation in a mouse passive cutaneous anaphylaxis model. Increasing doses of \nCompound\n 1 significantly decrease the amount of Evans Blue release, indicating decreased mast cell activation and vascular permeabilization. (\nFIG. 4\n)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMice were sensitized with an intradermal injection of monoclonal anti-DNP-IgE in the back. 23 hours later they received a single oral dose of \nCompound\n 1 or vehicle. After one hour, animals were challenged with an intravenous injection of DNP-BSA and Evans Blue dye. Mast cell degranulation leads to vascular permeability and the distribution of the dye into the skin of the back. The area of extravasation after 1 hour is measured.\n\n\n \nExample 5\n\n\nPharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compositions described below are presented with a compound of Formula (A1-A6) for illustrative purposes; any of the compounds of any of Formulas (A1-A6), (B1-B6), (C1-C6), or (D1-D6) are optionally used in such pharmaceutical compositions.\n\n\n \nExample 5a\n\n\nParenteral Composition\n\n\n \n \n \nTo prepare a parenteral pharmaceutical composition suitable for administration by injection, 100 mg of a water-soluble salt of a compound of Formula (A1-A6) is dissolved in DMSO and then mixed with 10 mL of 0.9% sterile saline. The mixture is incorporated into a dosage unit form suitable for administration by injection.\n\n\n \nExample 5b\n\n\nOral Composition\n\n\n \n \n \nTo prepare a pharmaceutical composition for oral delivery, 100 mg of a compound of Formula (A1-A6) is mixed with 750 mg of starch.

The mixture is gently blended and poured into a mold to form a lozenge suitable for buccal administration.\n\n\n \nExample 5d\n\n\nInhalation Composition\n\n\n \n \n \nTo prepare a pharmaceutical composition for inhalation delivery, 20 mg of a compound of Formula (A1-A6) is mixed with 50 mg of anhydrous citric acid and 100 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride solution. The mixture is incorporated into an inhalation delivery unit, such as a nebulizer, which is suitable for inhalation administration.\n\n\n \nExample 5e\n\n\nRectal Gel Composition\n\n\n \n \n \nTo prepare a pharmaceutical composition for rectal delivery, 100 mg of a compound of Formula (A1-A6) is mixed with 2.5 g of methylcellulose (1500 mPa), 100 mg of methylparaben, 5 g of glycerin and 100 mL of purified water. The resulting gel mixture is then incorporated into rectal delivery units, such as syringes, which are suitable for rectal administration.\n\n\n \nExample 5f\n\n\nTopical Gel Composition\n\n\n \n \n \nTo prepare a pharmaceutical topical gel composition, 100 mg of a compound of Formula (A1-A6) is mixed with 1.75 g of hydroxypropyl cellulose, 10 mL of propylene glycol, 10 mL of isopropyl myristate and 100 mL of purified alcohol USP. The resulting gel mixture is then incorporated into containers, such as tubes, which are suitable for topical administration.\n\n\n \nExample 5g\n\n\nOphthalmic Solution Composition\n\n\n \n \n \nTo prepare a pharmaceutical ophthalmic solution composition, 100 mg of a compound of Formula (A1-A6) is mixed with 0.9 g of NaCl in 100 mL of purified water and filtered using a 0.2 micron filter. The resulting isotonic solution is then incorporated into ophthalmic delivery units, such as eye drop containers, which are suitable for ophthalmic administration.\n\n\n \nExample 6\n\n\nLevels of Tonic BCR Signaling Predict Response to \nCompound\n 1\n\n\n \n \n \nTo identify biomarkers that correlate with response to \nCompound\n 1, phosphorylation events in the BCR signal transduction pathway were investigated. A panel of phospho-specific antibodies that recognize activating phosphorylation sites on Syk, Btk, BLNK, PLC-g1, PLC-g2, ERK, and AKT were used and tested the effects of \nCompound\n 4 on both basal phosphorylation and phosphorylation following BCR stimulation driven by anti-IgM or anti-IgG cross-linking. We examined phosphorylation patterns in both a \nCompound\n 1 sensitive cell line (DOHH2) and a \nCompound\n 1 resistant cell line (Ramos).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nCompound\n 1 inhibits most BCR-stimulus induced phosphorylation events with similar potency in both cell lines. However, when we examined basal phosphorylation levels, we found higher basal phosphorylation in DOHH2 compared to Ramos, with phospho-ERK in particular indicating higher levels of basal or tonic signaling in DOHH2. Furthermore, \nCompound\n 4 significantly decreased pERK levels in unstimulated DOHH2 cells (IC50<10 nM), but not in Ramos cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA panel of nine Btk expressing B cell lymphoma cell lines was screened for basal pERK levels. Seven lines expressed significantly higher levels of basal pERK, and of these, 5 were sensitive to Compound 1 (GI50<1.3 uM), while the two cell lines with low pERK levels were resistant to \nCompound\n 1. This data shows that tonic BCR signaling contributes to the survival of a subset of lymphoma cell lines, and that inhibition of this signaling by \nCompound\n 4 is correlated with induction of apoptosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo additional experiments demonstrate that sensitivity to \nCompound\n 1 is correlated with high levels of pERK. First 1 uM of \nCompound\n 4 reduces expression of the known ERK transcriptional target Egr-1 within 1 hr, with maximal downregulation (10-fold) achieved by 4 hr. Second, in the lymphoma cell line WSU-DLCL2, BCR cross-linking by anti-IgG (30 ug/ml) overcomes inhibition of pERK by \nCompound\n 4, showing that strong BCR stimulus activates parallel pathways to pERK that do not require Btk. BCR stimulus also rescues WSU-DLCL2 from \nCompound\n 1 induced cytotoxicity, further confirming that inhibition of pERK is correlated with apoptosis induction by \nCompound\n 1. Taken together these data show high levels of pERK or ERK transcriptional targets such as Egr-1 serve as useful markers for lymphomas in which tonic BCR signaling is contributing to cell survival and that these lymphomas are particularly sensitive to BCR pathway inhibitors such as \nCompound\n 1.\n\n\n \nKinase Inhibitor Discovery Platform and Pulse Dosing\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nDesign of an Inhibitor\n\n\n \n \n \nBecause the ATP binding sites of the >500 kinases in the human genome are highly conserved, it has proven difficult to engineer selectivity for individual kinases using conventional reversible binding inhibitors. For our highly selective \nBTK inhibitor Compound\n 1, we engineered an electrophilic center capable of irreversibly inactivating the target enzyme, BTK. The approach employed structure based design to achieve a high degree of potency and selectivity by (1) fitting the core scaffold into the active site ATP binding pocket of kinase enzymes, and (2) forming a covalent bond with Cysteine-481 located in BTK. The unique chemistry required for covalent bond formation involves an electrophilic moiety that acts as a Michael acceptor, which bonds with a nucleophile (such as Cys-481) present in a precise location within the active site.\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\nInhibitor Screening Approach\n\n\n \n \n \nBy way of example only, a panel of 50-100 Cys-targeting kinase inhibitors is generated. The molecular orientation and positioning of the electrophilic group in these inhibitors in relation to the Cysteine residue will affect the potency and selectivity of a given inhibitor. Each inhibitor will then be profiled for kinetics of kinase inhibition (K\ni\n) for each of the ten Cys-containing kinases, effect on tumor cell proliferation (GI\n50\n), effect on relevant off-targets (hERG, CYPs), drug-like characteristics (solubility, clogP) and ability to block labeling by the active site probe. This panel of diverse inhibitors are then be used in cell assays (for example, inhibition of tumor growth) to screen for a phenotype of interest. With the phenotype, the identification of additional inhibited kinases is determined using the active site probe and mass spectrometry.\n\n\n \nExample 3\n\n\nInhibition of a Panel of Kinases for \nCompound\n 1 and \nCompound\n 9\n\n\n \n \n \nIn another example, the linker and Michael acceptor moiety of Compound 1 was modified to provide \nCompound\n 9 which has a different selectivity pattern. Table 1 is a table showing the degree of inhibition of a panel of kinases for two example compounds. IC\n50\ns were determined using the in vitro HotSpot kinase assay (purified enzymes, \n33\nP-ATP, an appropriate substrate and 1 uM ATP.) Compared to Compound 1, Compound 9 has similar potency toward Btk, but significantly less potency toward JAK-3, ITK, and EGFR and significantly more potency toward the src-family kinases lck, c-src, FGR, Fyn, Hck, and Lyn and Yes. Thus, subtle modifications in the linker moiety and the Michael acceptor moiety are important for the design of selective ACK inhibitors.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nCompound\n 1\n\n\nCompound 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nKinase\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBTK\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nITK\n\n\n11.7\n\n\n909.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBmx/ETK\n\n\n0.8\n\n\n1.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTEC\n\n\n77.8\n\n\n108.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nEFGR\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n20.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHER2\n\n\n9.4\n\n\n1536.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHER4\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n3.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLCK\n\n\n2.0\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBLK\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nC-src\n\n\n262.6\n\n\n14.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFGR\n\n\n2.3\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFyn\n\n\n95.6\n\n\n7.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHCK\n\n\n3.7\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLyn\n\n\n16.2\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYES\n\n\n6.5\n\n\n0.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nABL\n\n\n86.1\n\n\n32.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBrk\n\n\n3.3\n\n\n3.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCSK\n\n\n2.2\n\n\n2.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFER\n\n\n8,070.0\n\n\n3,346.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nJAK3\n\n\n10.4\n\n\n8,278.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSYK\n\n\n>10,000\n\n\n>10,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 4\n\n\nModification of Linker and Michael Acceptor Moieties and In Vitro Inhibitory Activity\n\n\n \n \n \nIn this example, compounds are selected based on in vitro characteristics to optimize for potency of inhibition of particular kinases and degree of covalent binding to off-target cysteines such as glutathione. For example, in Table 2, \nCompound\n 9 and Compound 12 both inhibit Btk with a similar potency as \nCompound\n 1, but they are both significantly less potent inhibitors of EGFR, ITK, and JAK-3. As another example, \nCompound\n 11 is similar to \nCompound\n 1 for inhibition of Btk but does not bind glutathione as readily.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA calculated value (e.g (1/Btk IC\n50\n)/Glutathione conjugation rate) as shown in the Table 2) is used to compare compounds for their ratio between potency at inhibiting their target and their non-specific binding to other SH groups, such as those in glutathione. As shown in Table 2, this calculated value is 4.7 for \nCompound\n 1 and for 239.6 for \nCompound\n 11. Calculated ratios such as these are used to quantitatively compare different compounds and select compounds for further study.\n\n\n \nExample 4a\n\n\nEnzyme Inhibition\n\n\n \n \n \nFor enzyme inhibition assays, compounds were tested in range of ten concentrations from 10 uM to 0.0005 uM using purified enzymes and the Hotspot kinase assay. Reaction conditions were 1 uM ATP, one hour incubation with inhibitor, and kinase activity detected using 33-ATP phosphorylation of an appropriately selected peptide substrate. Dose-response curves were fit using Prism, and the IC\n50\n, the concentration at which enzyme inhibition is 50% of maximal inhibition, was determined See Table 2.\n\n\n \nExample 4b\n\n\nGlutathione Binding Assays\n\n\n \n \n \nFor the glutathione binding assays, 5 mM glutathione, 10 μM Btk inhibitor in DMSO (10 μL) and 6 equivalents of N′N′ Diisopropyl ethyl amine were combined in 1 mL potassium phosphate buffer. The mixture was incubated for 0, 15, 60 minutes at room temperature and the reaction was stopped with 10 equivalents of formic acid. 50 μL of each reaction mixture was injected on HPLC (Mobil Phase A: 0.2% formic acid in water, Mobile Phase B: 0.2% formic acid in acetonitrile, HPLC Column. Metasil Basic 3μ, 150×4.6 mm, 10% B, Gradient: 10% to 90% B, Detection: UV/Vis 260 nM). Rate of reaction was reported as nmole GSH conjugate conversion per minute from the normalized ratio for area under the curve from HPLC chromatograms for both GSH conjugate and the parent.\n\n\n \nExample 4c\n\n\nCell Proliferation Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nAnalogs are generated that are Btk inhibitors and that are cytotoxic to the lymphoma cell line DOHH2. See Table 2. For the DOHH2 cell proliferation assay, cells were seeded in 96-well plates in standard growth media (RPMI+10% fetal calf serum) and compounds were added in a 9-point dilution series ranging from 10 uM to 0.04 uM with DMSO at 0.1% final concentration in all wells. After 72 hours, cell number was measured using Alamar Blue using manufacturer's protocol. A dilution series of untreated cells was run in parallel to verify that the Alamar Blue assay reliably reflected cell number and that growth conditions were not limiting. The GI\n50\n, the concentration that results in a 50% decrease in cell number, was calculated using Calcusyn to fit the dose-response curve.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(1/BTK\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nBTK\n\n\nITK\n\n\nEGFR\n\n\nLCK\n\n\nJAK3\n\n\nGlutathione\n\n\nIC\n50\n)/\n\n\nDOHH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound\n\n\nIC\n50\n \n\n\nIC\n50\n \n\n\nIC\n50\n \n\n\nIC\n50\n \n\n\nIC\n50\n \n\n\nConj Rate\n\n\nGlutathione\n\n\n2 GI\n50\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\n\n\nStructure\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\n(nmol/min)\n\n\nRate\n\n\n(μM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n11.7\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n2.0\n\n\n10.4\n\n\n0.398\n\n\n4.7\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1\n\n\n \n\n\n48.8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21\n\n\n \n\n\n74.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.2\n\n\n \n\n\n487.6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.6\n\n\n \n\n\n326.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.004\n\n\n44.5\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1\n\n\n \n\n\n60.9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.39\n\n\n0.8\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.3\n\n\n6,123\n\n\n268.7\n\n\n2.6\n\n\n>10,000\n\n\n0.01\n\n\n15.9\n\n\n0.317\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4\n\n\n \n\n\n83.4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n909.9\n\n\n20.6\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n8278.0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.011\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.31\n\n\n1954\n\n\n44.5\n\n\n0.88\n\n\n>10,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<0.03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.92\n\n\n6891\n\n\n18.85\n\n\n2.43\n\n\n>10,000\n\n\n0.004525\n\n\n239.6\n\n\n>10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.33\n\n\n14290\n\n\n698.3\n\n\n5.97\n\n\n>10,000\n\n\n0.004361\n\n\n172.2\n\n\n>10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.67\n\n\n3013\n\n\n18.75\n\n\n1.56\n\n\n12980\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.39\n\n\n592.3\n\n\n2.298\n\n\n9.24\n\n\n1456\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.37\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.16\n\n\n21100\n\n\n289.4\n\n\n5.90\n\n\n>10,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.59\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.14\n\n\n>10,000\n\n\n2807\n\n\n3.82\n\n\n>10,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.00\n\n\n2333\n\n\n435.3\n\n\n2.07\n\n\n>10,000\n\n\n0.0243\n\n\n20.6\n\n\n0.21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.38\n\n\n2536\n\n\n22.53\n\n\n0.76\n\n\n>10,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<0.03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.58\n\n\n534.6\n\n\n28.22\n\n\n6.62\n\n\n5997\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.69\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.07\n\n\n7993\n\n\n303.60\n\n\n98.59\n\n\n>10,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.39\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.15\n\n\n>10,000\n\n\n6238.00\n\n\n1346\n\n\n>10,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1.53\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.57\n\n\n3691\n\n\n156.30\n\n\n22.12\n\n\n>10,000\n\n\n0.014\n\n\n45.4\n\n\n<0.04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.32\n\n\n830\n\n\n70.49\n\n\n208.00\n\n\n3306.00\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.89\n\n\n476\n\n\n383.70\n\n\n235.40\n\n\n9077.00\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.44\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.48\n\n\n>10,000\n\n\n272.90\n\n\n25.81\n\n\n>10,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 5\n\n\nKinase Inhibitor Selectivity Predicted by Dosing\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompound\n 1 and Compound 12 have a short half-life in vivo. In contrast, \nCompound\n 7 and \nCompound\n 8 have a significantly longer in vivo half-life (\nFIG. 5\n). Compounds like 1 and 12 are predicted to have enhanced kinase selectivity in vivo because inhibition will be sustained only for those kinases that are irreversibly inhibited.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMale jugular vein cannulated rats were administered a single dose of all test compounds at 8 mg/kg each, in combination by oral gavage. Dose volumes were adjusted based on body weight data collected immediately prior to dosing. Blood samples were collected at 0.0833 (5 minutes), 0.333 (20 minutes), 1, 3, 6, 9, and 24 hours post-dosing from orally dosed rats. The samples were collected into plasma separator Microtainer tubes with anticoagulant (lithium heparin). Plasma samples were prepared by centrifugation (5 min at 5000×g), and at least 100 μL were transferred to storage tubes and stored frozen at −80° C. Plasma samples were thawed and 75 uL aliquots were transferred to centrifuge tubes to which 10 μL aliquots of internal standard solution (1 μg/mL) were added. The samples were not diluted with blank plasma prior to further processing. Soluble proteins were precipitated by the addition of 200 μL of acetonitrile, followed by centrifugation (20 min at 16,000×g). The samples were evaporated to dryness and reconstituted in 200 μL of water containing 0.2% formic acid and 10% methanol. All samples were loaded onto an autosampler maintained at 6° C. and evaluated for concentrations of test compounds using LC-MS/MS.\n\n\n \nExample 6\n\n\nB Cell Inhibition\n\n\n \n \n \nBrief exposure to \nCompound\n 1 in vitro is sufficient to inhibit B cell activation in normal human B cells (\nFIG. 6\n). This protocol mimics the predicted exposure of cells to \nCompound\n 1 in vivo and demonstrates that inhibition of B cells is sustained despite washing out of \nCompound\n 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nB cells were purified from blood from healthy donors by negative selecting using the RosetteSep Human B cell enrichment cocktail. Cells were plated in growth media (10% RPMI+10% fetal calf serum) and indicated concentrations of \nCompound\n 1 were added. After incubation for 1 hour at 37° C., cells were washed three times using an 8-fold dilution in growth media for each wash. Cells were then stimulated with 10 ug/ml of IgM F(ab′)2 for 18 hours at 37° C. Cells were then stained with anti-CD69-PE antibody and analyzed by flow cytometry using standard conditions.\n\n\n \nExample 7\n\n\nOptimizing the Therapeutic Index of Kinase Inhibitors\n\n\n \n \n \nGiven that kinase inhibitors described above will have both reversible and irreversible activities, we select their in vivo properties of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) in order to optimize the therapeutic index. Specifically, rapidly cleared compounds are expected to cause only brief inhibition of reversibly inhibited targets while maintaining sustained inhibition of irreversibly inhibited targets. Depending on the degree to which sustained inhibition of particular targets results in therapeutic effects or toxicities, we identify compounds with an optimal combination of in vitro selectivity profiles and in vivo ADME properties."

A method of treating a disease or disorder responsive to treatment with a Y5 receptor ligand, comprising administering the compound of \nclaim 22\n to a patient in need thereof sufficient to treat said disease or disorder. Description\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention is directed novel compounds which are ligands at the neuropeptide Y Y5 receptor. Separate aspects of the invention are directed to pharmaceutical compositions comprising said compounds and uses of the compounds to treat disorders related to mood, stress, cognition, stress and dementia.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND ART\n\n\n \n \n \nNeuropeptide Y (NPY) is a 36 amino acid neuropeptide expressed in the peripheral and central nervous system. This peptide is a member of the pancreatic polypeptide family, which also includes pancreatic polypeptide (PP) and peptide YY (PYY), and the biological effects of NPY are mediated through its interaction with receptors that belong in the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPresently, five NPY receptor subtypes have been cloned: Y1 (D. Larhammar, et al., J. Biol. Chem., 1992, 267, 10935-10938); Y2 (C. Gerald, et al., J. Biol. Chem., 1995, 270, 26758-26761); Y4 (J. Bard, et al., J. Biol. Chem., 1995, 270, 26762-26765); Y5 (C. Gerald, et al., J. Biol. Chem., 1995, 270, 26758-26761); and y6 (P. Gregor, et al., J. Biol. Chem., 1996, 271, 27776-27781). All these receptor subtypes are expressed in several species except for the y6 subtype, which has been shown to be expressed in mouse and rabbit but not in rat and primate. A Y3 subtype has been proposed based on pharmacological data. However, the Y3 subtype has yet to be cloned and its existence remains to be fully established.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNPY exerts numerous physiological effects. On the basis of animal studies, it is evident that a contributory relationship exists between NPY and its receptors with disorders such as depression, anxiety and obesity. For instance, NPY expression is shown to be sensitive to energy status while NPY administration reduces energy expenditure. Another significant ability of NPY is to acutely stimulate feeding (S. Kalra, et al., Endocr. Rev., 1999, 20, 68-100). The NPY Y5 receptor has also been shown to be a receptor subtype responsible for NPY-induced food intake (C. Gerald, et al., Nature, 1996, 382, 168-171).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also reported that the NPY Y5 receptor mediates CNS effects in connection with stress and neuroendocrine disorders (M. Walker, et al. WET, 2009, 328, 3. pg. 901-911). Lu AA33810, a selective Y5 receptor antagonist, attenuated increases in plasma ACTH and cortisol elicited by i.c.v. injection of cPP(1-7), NPY(19-23),Ala\n31\n,Aib\n32\n, Gln\n34\n]. In Sprague Dawley rats subjected to the social interaction test, Lu AA33810 (3-30 mg/kg, p.o.) produced anxiolytic-like effects after acute or chronic treatment. In Flinders Sensitive Line rats, chronic dosing of Lu AA33810 (10 mg/kg/day, i.p.) produced anxiolytic-like effects in the social interaction test, plus antidepressant-like effects in the forced swim test. In Wistar rats exposed to chronic mild stress, chronic dosing of Lu AA33810 (3, 10 mg/kg/day, i.p.) produced antidepressant-like activity, i.e. normalization of stress-induced decrease in sucrose consumption.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPCT Publication No. WO 03/51397 claims the use of NPY Y5 receptor antagonists in the treatment of dementias as well the treatment of cognitive impairment disorders such as cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia (CIAS). This application further discloses the use of NPY Y5 receptor antagonists to treat the positive and negative aspects of schizophrenia, autism, ADHD and Alzheimer's disease. The NPY Y5 receptor antagonist, MK-0557, is currently being tested in clinical trials for the treatment of cognitive impairment in patients with schizophrenia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough patients suffering from these disorders have available treatment options, many of these options lack the desired efficacy and are accompanied by undesired side effects. For example, the SSRIs have been a great advance for the treating mood disorders; however, many patients do not fully respond to treatments. Therefore, an unmet need exists for novel therapies for the treatment of said disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an attempt to identify new therapies, the inventors have identified a series of novel compounds as represented by Formula I and discovered that the compounds bind to the NPY Y5 receptor. Accordingly, the present invention provides novel compounds as medicaments for the treatment of disorders which are modulated by the NPY Y5 receptor.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nAn objective of the present invention is to provide compounds that are ligands at the NPY Y5 receptor. Accordingly, the present invention relates to compounds of Formula I.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein R\n1 \nis C\n1\n-C\n7 \nalkyl, C\n1\n-C\n7 \nperfluoroalkyl, C\n1\n-C\n7 \nalkoxy or halogen;\n\n\nwherein R\n2 \nis C\n1\n-C\n7 \nalkyl;\n\n\nwherein R\n3 \nis H, C\n1\n-C\n7 \nalkyl, C\n1\n-C\n7 \nalkoxy, —(CH\n2\n)\nu\nOH, —N(R\n4\n)C(O)C\n1\n-C\n7 \nalkyl or —N(R\n4\n)C(O)C\n1\n-C\n7 \nalkoxy;\n\n\nwherein R\n4 \nis H or C\n1\n-C\n7 \nalkyl;\n\n\nwherein X is —CH\n2\n—, —O—, —CH\n2\nO—, —NR\n5\n— or —CH\n2\nNR\n5\n—;\n\n\nwherein R\n5 \nis H, C\n1\n-C\n7 \nalkyl, phenyl or pyridyl, where the phenyl and pyridyl are optionally substituted with C\n1\n-C\n7 \nalkyl, C\n1\n-C\n7 \nperfluoroalkyl, C\n1\n-C\n7 \nalkoxy or halogen;\n\n\nwherein Ar is a divalent aromatic moiety selected from the group consisting of phenyl, pyridine, pyrimidine, pyridazine, pyrazine, imidazole, pyrazole, triazole, oxazole and isoxazole;\n\n\nwherein each m and n is independently an integer from 0 to 5 inclusive;\n\n\nwherein u is 0 or 1; and\n\n\nwherein each t and s is independently an integer from 0 to 2 inclusive; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn separate embodiments of the invention, the compound is selected from one of the specific compounds disclosed in the Experimental Section.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

Such salts include pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts. Acid addition salts include salts of inorganic acids as well as organic acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRepresentative examples of suitable inorganic acids include hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, phosphoric, sulfuric, sulfamic, nitric acids and the like. Representative examples of suitable organic acids include formic, acetic, trichloroacetic, trifluoroacetic, propionic, benzoic, cinnamic, citric, fumaric, glycolic, itaconic, lactic, methanesulfonic, maleic, malic, malonic, mandelic, oxalic, picric, pyruvic, salicylic, succinic, methane sulfonic, ethanesulfonic, tartaric, ascorbic, pamoic, bismethylene salicylic, ethanedisulfonic, gluconic, citraconic, aspartic, stearic, palmitic, EDTA, glycolic, p-aminobenzoic, glutamic, benzenesulfonic, p-toluenesulfonic acids, theophylline acetic acids, as well as the 8-halotheophyllines (for example, 8-bromotheophylline and the like).

Sci., 1977, 66, 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, the compounds of this invention may exist in unsolvated as well as in solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRacemic forms may be resolved into the optical antipodes by known methods, for example, by separation of diastereomeric salts thereof with an optically active acid, and liberating the optically active amine compound by treatment with a base. Separation of such diastereomeric salts can be achieved, e.g. by fractional crystallization. The optically active acids suitable for this purpose may include, but are not limited to d- or 1-tartaric, mandelic or camphorsulfonic acids. Another method for resolving racemates into the optical antipodes is based upon chromatography on an optically active matrix. The compounds of the present invention may also be resolved by the formation and chromatographic separation of diastereomeric derivatives from chiral derivatizing reagents, such as, chiral alkylating or acylating reagents, followed by cleavage of the chiral auxiliary. Any of the above methods may be applied either to resolve the optical antipodes of the compounds of the invention per se or to resolve the optical antipodes of synthetic intermediates, which can then be converted by methods described herein into the optically resolved final products which are the compounds of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional methods for the resolution of optical isomers, known to those skilled in the art, may be used. Such methods include those discussed by J. Jaques, A. Collet and S. Wilen in Enantiomers, Racemates, and Resolutions, John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1981. Optically active compounds can also be prepared from optically active starting materials.\n\n\n \nPharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention further provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of one of the specific compounds disclosed in the Experimental Section and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention may be administered alone or in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients, in either single or multiple doses. The pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention may be formulated with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents as well as any other known adjuvants and excipients in accordance with conventional techniques such as those disclosed in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 19\nth \nEdition, Gennaro, Ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1995.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions may be specifically formulated for administration by any suitable route such as oral, rectal, nasal, pulmonary, topical (including buccal and sublingual), transdermal, intracisternal, intraperitoneal, vaginal and parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intrathecal, intravenous and intradermal) routes. It will be appreciated that the route will depend on the general condition and age of the subject to be treated, the nature of the condition to be treated and the active ingredient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions for oral administration include solid dosage forms such as capsules, tablets, dragees, pills, lozenges, powders and granules. Where appropriate, the compositions may be prepared with coatings such as enteric coatings or they may be formulated so as to provide controlled release of the active ingredient such as sustained or prolonged release according to methods well known in the art. Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include solutions, emulsions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions for parenteral administration include sterile aqueous and nonaqueous injectable solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions as well as sterile powders to be reconstituted in sterile injectable solutions or dispersions prior to use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther suitable administration forms include, but are not limited to, suppositories, sprays, ointments, creams, gels, inhalants, dermal patches and implants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypical oral dosages range from about 0.001 to about 100 mg/kg body weight per day. Typical oral dosages also range from about 0.01 to about 50 mg/kg body weight per day. Typical oral dosages further range from about 0.05 to about 10 mg/kg body weight per day. Oral dosages are usually administered in one or more dosages, typically, one to three dosages per day. The exact dosage will depend upon the frequency and mode of administration, the sex, age, weight and general condition of the subject treated, the nature and severity of the condition treated and any concomitant diseases to be treated and other factors evident to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe formulations may also be presented in a unit dosage form by methods known to those skilled in the art. For illustrative purposes, a typical unit dosage form for oral administration may contain from about 0.01 to about 1000 mg, from about 0.05 to about 500 mg, or from about 0.5 to about 200 mg.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor parenteral routes such as intravenous, intrathecal, intramuscular and similar administration, typical doses are in the order of half the dose employed for oral administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides a process for making a pharmaceutical composition comprising admixing a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In an embodiment of the present invention the compound utilized in the aforementioned process is one of the specific compounds disclosed in the Experimental Section.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of this invention are generally utilized as the free substance or as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. One example is an acid addition salt of a compound having the utility of a free base. When a compound of Formula I contains a free base such salts are prepared in a conventional manner by treating a solution or suspension of a free base of Formula I with a molar equivalent of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid. Representative examples of suitable organic and inorganic acids are described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor parenteral administration, solutions of the compounds of Formula I in sterile aqueous solution, aqueous propylene glycol, aqueous vitamin E or sesame or peanut oil may be employed. Such aqueous solutions should be suitably buffered if necessary and the liquid diluent first rendered isotonic with sufficient saline or glucose. The aqueous solutions are particularly suitable for intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous and intraperitoneal administration. The compounds of Formula I may be readily incorporated into known sterile aqueous media using standard techniques known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable pharmaceutical carriers include inert solid diluents or fillers, sterile aqueous solutions and various organic solvents. Examples of solid carriers include lactose, terra alba, sucrose, cyclodextrin, talc, gelatin, agar, pectin, acacia, magnesium stearate, stearic acid and lower alkyl ethers of cellulose. Examples of liquid carriers include, but are not limited to, syrup, peanut oil, olive oil, phospholipids, fatty acids, fatty acid amines, polyoxyethylene and water. Similarly, the carrier or diluent may include any sustained release material known in the art, such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate, alone or mixed with a wax. The pharmaceutical compositions formed by combining the compounds of Formula I and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier are then readily administered in a variety of dosage forms suitable for the disclosed routes of administration. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form by methods known in the art of pharmacy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules or tablets, each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient, and optionally a suitable excipient. Furthermore, the orally available formulations may be in the form of a powder or granules, a solution or suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid, or an oil-in-water or water-in-oil liquid emulsion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf a solid carrier is used for oral administration, the preparation may be tabletted, placed in a hard gelatin capsule in powder or pellet form or it may be in the form of a troche or lozenge. The amount of solid carrier will vary widely but will range from about 25 mg to about 1 g per dosage unit. If a liquid carrier is used, the preparation may be in the form of a syrup, emulsion, soft gelatin capsule or sterile injectable liquid such as an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid suspension or solution.\n\n\n \nUses of the Compounds of Formula I\n\n\n \n \n \nAs mentioned above, the compounds of Formula I are ligands at the NPY Y5 receptor. The present invention provides a method of treating a subject suffering from a mood disorder which comprises administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of this invention. The present invention provides a method of treating a subject suffering from a cognitive disorder which comprises administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of this invention. This invention further provides a method of treating a subject suffering from obesity which comprises administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of this invention. In an embodiment of this invention, the subject is a human being.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, the present invention is directed to the use of a compound of this invention for the manufacture of a medicament useful for treating depression. Additionally, the present invention is directed to the use of a compound of this invention for the manufacture of a medicament useful for treating anxiety. The present invention further provides for the use of a compound of a compound of this invention for the manufacture of a medicament useful for treating obesity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe link between NPY and mood disorders such as depression and anxiety is established in the literature. For example, rats subjected to chronic mild stress exhibit anhedonia, a feature of clinical depression (P. Willner, et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol., 1997, 340, 121-132); they also contain elevated levels of NPY mRNA in hypothalamus accompanied by a reduction in hippocampus (V. Sergeyev, et al., Psychopharmacology, 2005, 178, 115-124). The behavioral changes associated with chronic mild stress are reversed by a variety of antidepressants (P. Willner, et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol., 1997, 340, 121-132). In one study of antidepressant therapies, rats treated with citalopram displayed an increased level of hippocampal NPY receptor binding with no change in NPY-like immunoreactivity (H. Husum, et al., Neuropsychopharmacology, 2001, 2, 183-191); conversely, electroconvulsive shock produced an increased level of hippocampal NPY-like immunoreactivity with no change in NPY receptor binding. These findings suggest that abnormal levels of NPY play a role in depressive illness, and that agents capable of regulating NPY and/or NPY receptor function particularly in limbic regions are useful for treating depression. Y5 is a NPY receptor expressed in limbic regions (M. Wolak, et al., J Comp. Neurol., 2003, 22, 285-311; and K. Nichol, et al., J. Neurosci., 1999, 19, 10295-10304). Accordingly, agents capable of regulating Y5 receptor function are therefore predicted to be useful for treating depression. Animal models of anxiety also reveal abnormal levels of NPY. In one example, maternally separated rats display an anxious and depressive phenotype throughout adulthood (R. Huot, Psychopharmacology, 2001, 158, 366-73); they also contain elevated levels of NPY-like immunoreactivity in hypothalamus accompanied by a reduction in hippocampus and cortex (P. Jimenez-Vasquez, Brain Res. Dev., 2001, 26, 149-152; H. Husum and A. Mathe, Neuropsychopharmacology, 2002 27:756-64; and H. Husum et al., Neurosci Lett., 2002, 333, 127-130). In a second example, rats subjected to fear conditioning display increased anxiety-like behavior; they also contain elevated levels of NPY in hypothalamus, amygdala and nucleus accumbens accompanied by a reduction in frontal cortex. The behavioral changes produced by fear conditioning can be reversed by treatment with anxiolytic drugs. In one study of fear conditioning, both the anxiety-like behavior and altered expression of NPY were reversed by treatment with diazepam (R. Krysiak, et al., Neuropeptides, 2000, 34, 148-57). These findings further suggest that NPY plays a role in anxiety, and that agents capable of regulating NPY and/or receptor function particularly in limbic regions are useful for treating anxiety. Y5 is a NPY receptor expressed in limbic regions (M. Wolak, et al., J. Comp. Neurol., 2003, 22, 285-311; and K. Nichol, et al., J. Neurosci., 1999, 19, 10295-10304). Thus, agents capable of regulating Y5 receptor function are therefore predicted to be useful for treating anxiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral groups disclose the nexus between the NPY Y5 receptor and sleep disorders related to circadian rhythm disruptions. This nexus is based on the discovery that NPY Y5 receptors mediate an important physiologic response in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus in response to the application of NPY. For example, WO 99/05911 and WO 05/30208 disclose this link and propose the use of NPY Y5 receptor ligands for treating sleep disorders. Accordingly, it is expected that the compounds of Formula I can be used for treating sleep disorders, which includes primary insomnia, and disorders related to disturbances in circadian rhythms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical industry is also targeting NPY Y5 receptor antagonists as potential therapies for the treatment of cognitive impairment/dysfunction disorders. For example, the NPY Y5 receptor antagonist, MK-0557, is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of cognitive impairment in patients with schizophrenia. In support of this indication, WO 03/51356 proposes that NPY Y5 receptor antagonism can be used to treat dementias. Accordingly, it is expected that the compounds of Formula I can used for treating cognitive impairment/dysfunction disorders such as cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia (CIAS). The compounds of the invention are also expected to treat the positive and negative aspects of schizophrenia; dementias; autism; ADHD; and Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWO 02/28393 discloses methods of reducing self-administration of alcohol in a patient suffering from alcoholism comprising administering a NPY Y5 receptor antagonist. Accordingly, it is expected that the compounds of Formula I can used for treating substance dependency/abuse disorders such as alcoholism as well as nicotine and cocaine addictions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, it is expected that the compounds of Formula I can be used for treating metabolic disorders such as dyslipidemia; hyperlipidemia; insulin hyposensitivity; hyperglycemia; metabolic syndrome; and diabetes mellitus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalgesic-like effects of NPY have been shown in rats and mice both after intrathecal administration and ICV administration, and after infusion directly into specific brain regions. These studies have used either “spinal” pain models or “supraspinal” models. The involvement of the Y5 receptor subtype has been linked to chronic pain disorders (Woldbye, et al. Brain Research, 2007, 49-55). Thus, it is expected that the compounds of Formula I can used for treating chronic pain disorders such as neuropathic pain; neuralgic pain; migraine; fibromyalgia; IBS; chronic fatigue syndrome; chronic tension type headache; chronic low back pain; myofascial pain and chronic osteoarthritis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, it is expected the treatment of the cognitive and mood impairment in Parkinson's disease may be an indication target for the compounds of Formula I. The compounds of Formula I may also be used to treat disorders relating to and impulsivity are aggression.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention will be better understood from the Experimental Details which follow. However, one skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the specific methods and results discussed therein are merely illustrative of the invention as described more fully in the claims which follow thereafter. Furthermore, the variables depicted in Schemes 1-6 are consistent with the variables recited in the Summary of the Invention.\n\n\n \nEXPERIMENTAL SECTION\n\n\n \n \n \nGeneral Methods: Anhydrous solvents were purchased from the Aldrich Chemical Company and used as received.

Chemical shifts (δ) are expressed in ppm, coupling constants (J) are expressed in Hz, and splitting patterns are described as follows: s=singlet; d=doublet; t=triplet; q=quartet; sept=septet; br=broad; m=multiplet; dd=doublet of doublets; dt=doublet of triplets; td=triplet of doublets; dq=doublet of quartet.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnless otherwise noted, mass spectra were obtained using electrospray ionization (ESMS, Micromass Platform II or Quattro Micro) or Waters ZQ mass spectrometry with Agilent 1100 HPLC system with an autosampler using DAD/UV and Waters ELSD detection system and Inertsil ODS-3 column. For LC-MS determination, four methods were used: Method A: C18 column, Neutral pH, 20% to 90% Acetonitrile/H\n2\nO with 0.2% Ammonium formate; or Method B: C18 column, Acidic pH, 0% to 30% Acetonitrile/H\n2\nO with 0.2% Acetic acid; or Method C: C8 column, Neutral pH, 10% to 90% Acetonitrile/H\n2\nO with 0.2% Ammonium formate; or Method D: C18 column, Neutral pH, 0% to 30% Acetonitrile/H\n2\nO with 0.2% Ammonium formate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain instances, the methods of preparing the compounds of the invention are described generally by referring to representative reagents such as bases or solvents. The particular reagent identified is representative but is not inclusive and does not limit the invention in any way.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is noted that schemes 1-6 describe the use of selective protecting groups during the synthesis of the compounds of the invention. One skilled in the art would be able to select the appropriate protecting group for a particular reaction. Moreover, it may be necessary to incorporate protection and deprotection strategies for substituents such as amino, amido, carboxylic acid and hydroxyl groups in the synthetic methods described below to synthesize the compounds of Formula I. Methods for protection and deprotection of such groups are well known in the art, and may be found in T. Green, et al., Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 1991, 2\nnd \nEdition, John Wiley & Sons, New York.\n\n\n \nPreparation of the Compounds of Formula I\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of Formula I wherein X is CH\n2 \nand s is 0-2 may be synthesized according to the procedures described in Scheme 1. The starting materials of Formulas II and III are commercially available or may be synthesized by procedures known in the prior art. In summary, a keto ester of Formula II is combined with an amino ester of Formula III in the presence of a reducing agent to afford a lactam ester of Formula IV which is further hydrolyzed to form a lactam acid of Formula V. Conversion to an acid chloride of Formula VI followed by reaction with an amine of Formula VII affords the compounds of Formula I.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRepresentative intermediates were synthesized according to Scheme 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntermediate of Formula N, wherein R\n3 \nis H and s is 1: 4-(2-Oxo-pyrrolidin-1-yl)-cyclohexanecarboxylic acid ethyl ester\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n4-Oxo-cyclohexanecarboxylic acid ethyl ester (6.808 g, 40.00 mmoles) and 4-amino-butyric acid methyl ester hydrochloride (6.144 g, 40.00 mmoles) were dispersed with stirring in 1,2-dichloroethane (125 mls).

Test compounds were diluted to desired concentrations with supplemented binding buffer in the presence of 30% DMSO. The binding assay was performed in 96-well polypropylene microtiter plates by mixing 125I-PYY test compound (25 μL), and finally, membrane suspensions (200 μL). Final DMSO=3%. Samples were incubated in at room temperature for about 120 min. Incubations were terminated by filtration over Whatman GF/C filters (pre-coated with 1% polyethyleneimine and air-dried before use), followed by washing with ice-cold binding buffer. Filter-trapped membranes were impregnated with MeltiLex solid scintillant (Wallac, Turku, Finland) and counted for \n125\nI-PYY in a Wallac MicroBeta Trilux. Non-specific binding was defined by 1000 nM porcine NPY. Specific binding was typically 80%; most non-specific binding was associated with the filter. Binding data were analyzed using nonlinear regression and statistical techniques available in the GraphPAD Prism package (San Diego, Calif.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe binding affinities for the compounds in the present invention, exemplified above, at the human NPY Y5 receptor were determined to be about 10 μM or less. The binding affinities for most of the compounds were determined to be about 1.0 μM or less. The binding affinities for several compounds were determined to be about 100 nM or less. A few compounds bind to the receptor with binding affinity less than about 10 nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE I\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbinding affinity of selected compounds\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nExample No.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1a\n \n2a\n \n3a\n \n4a\n \n5a\n \n5b\n \n6a\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nKi (nM)\n \n720\n \n8\n \n6\n \n9\n \n12\n \n3.8\n \n8\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nFunctional Assay: NPY Y5-Dependent Inhibition of Forskolin-stimulated cAMP Accumulation\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStably transfected cells were seeded into 96-well microtiter plates and cultured until confluent. To reduce the potential for receptor desensitization, the serum component of the media was reduced to 1.5% for 4 to 16 hours before the assay. Cells were washed in Hank's buffered saline, or HBS (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES, 1 mM CaCl\n2\n, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl\n2\n, and 10 mM glucose) supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin plus 100 uM IBMX. Test compounds were diluted to desired concentrations with assay buffer in the presence of 10% DMSO, then transferred to the cell plate and allowed to incubate for 20 min at 37° C. in 5% CO\n2 \n(final DMSO=1%). Cells were then stimulated with NPY (up to 10 uM) for a period of 5 min, followed by forskolin (10 uM) for another 5 min. The assay was then terminated and intracellular cAMP was quantified by with highthroughput time-resolved flourometry (HTRF kit from CisBio, Bedford, Mass.). The effect of the test compound on agonist (NPY) activity were analyzed using nonlinear regression and statistical techniques available in the GraphPAD Prism package (San Diego, Calif.). The compounds of Example 2a and 5b were determined to function as an antagonist at the NPY Y5 receptor.\n\n\n \nExample 8 \n\n\nIn-Vivo Assays\n\n\n \n \n \nThe in-vivo effects of the compounds of the present invention can be evaluated by using the following in-vivo behavioral animal models. The behavioral models described below are not intended to be the only models used to determine the efficacy of a compound of the invention to treat the corresponding disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAgonist-stimulated Feeding Assay. Sprague-Dawley rats (250-275 g) are implanted with guide cannulae into the lateral cerebral ventricle at Charles River Laboratories (Kingston, N.Y.) and shipped to the animal facility 2-3 days later. After a 1 week acclimation period, successful cannulae placement was confirmed by robust drinking in response to an i.c.v. infusion of angiotensin II (100 μg). At least 5 days prior to initiation of feeding studies, rats are acclimated to cages with wire grid floors, suspended by a stainless steel support above a waste tray. Food was removed on the morning of testing. To study the blockade of Y\n5 \nreceptor-induced feeding by the compound, animals were dosed orally with vehicle alone (20% cyclodextrin in distilled H\n2\nO) or the compound , followed 1 h later by i.c.v. infusion (5 μl over 1 min) of the Y\n5 \nreceptor-selective peptide agonist cPP (0.6 nmol in normal saline). The 0.6 nmol dose of cPP was selected because it is just below the ED\n50 \ndose (0.75 nmol) determined from preliminary experiments (data not shown) and provides a robust feeding signal. Animals are returned to the feeding cages and a pre-weighed amount of food was made available for 1 h. Net food intake=pre-weighed amount−(final amount+spilled amount). To test for nonspecific inhibition of the feeding response, we assess the effect of the compound (30 mg/kg) on feeding induced by 2 nmol NPY, a dose that evoked a feeding response equivalent to that of 0.6 nmol cPP.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRat Forced-swim Test: The procedure which may be used here is similar to that previously described (Luki, et al. Psychopharmacology 2001, 155, 315-322) with the following modifications. Male Sprague-Dawley rats may be used. Swim sessions are conducted for about 5 min, by placing rats in a plexiglass cylinder (about 46 cm tall×20 cm in diameter) filled about 30 cm deep with water at about 23° C. A compound of the invention or vehicle (about 0.01% lactic acid, about pH 6) is administered orally as a 1 ml/kg solution. Test sessions are videotaped and recorded for later scoring by a single rater, who is blinded to the treatment condition. Immobility is scored as the time a rat remained floating in the water making only movements necessary to keep its head above the water. Swimming is scored as the time a rat made active swimming motions, more than necessary to maintain its head above water.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRat Social-interaction Test: The procedure is performed for about 15 min as previously described (File and Hyde Br. J. Pharmacol. 1987, 62, 19-24) under low-light conditions using pairs of unfamiliar male Sprague-Dawley rats previously housed singly and exposed to the test arena for about 15 min on the previous day. A compound of the invention, chlordiazepoxide or vehicle is injected i.p. as a ˜1.0 ml/kg solution. All test sessions are videotaped and recorded for later scoring. Active social interaction, defined as sniffing, grooming, biting, boxing and crawling over and under, as well as locomotor activity (defined as squares crossed), is scored by a single rater, who is blinded to the treatment of each pair.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChronic mild stress: The chronic mild stress (CMS) test is performed using male Wistar rats as described previously (Papp et al., 2002). Rats are first trained to consume a 1% sucrose solution in a series of baseline tests during which the sucrose solution was presented in the home cage for 1 h following 14 h food and water deprivation. On the basis of their final sucrose intake scores, animals are divided into two matched groups, one subjected continuously to chronic mild stress for a period of 8-9 consecutive weeks and the other housed separately as a non-stressed control group. Both groups are subjected to a sucrose consumption test once weekly, around 10:00 a.m. and under similar conditions as in the training period. Following 2-3 weeks of stress, sucrose intake scores are used to further divide both stressed and control animals into matched groups (n=8 per group). For the next 5 weeks both stressed and control animals receive twice daily intraperitoneal injections of vehicle (0.25% hydroxypropyl (β methylcellulose, 1 ml/kg), a compound of the invention or citalopram at approx. 10:00 and 17:00, except that the 17:00 i.p. injection was omitted on days preceding the sucrose test. After 5 weeks the i.p. injections were terminated in both groups. Twenty-four h after the last i.p. injection, all animals were sacrificed and brains removed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNovel Object Recognition: Novel Object Recognition is a hippocampus-dependent, non-spatial, visual memory task that takes advantage of rodent's innate drive to explore novelty in its environment. Vehicle and/or test compound were administered at a dosing volume according to experimental design (i.p., p.o., or s.c.) at an interval ranging from 30 minutes to 24 hours prior to training or testing. Step 1: Animals were transported in their home cages from the vivarium to the dimly lit (5-6 lux) training room and are acclimated for approximately 45 minutes. Step 2: Animals were individually placed in the training/testing chamber for 3-15 minutes of habituation. The animals were then returned to their home cage. They remain in the testing room for approximately 15 minutes after the last animal is habituated before being returned to their colony room. Step 3: The day after initial habituation, the animals were returned to the testing room and acclimated as described in Step 1. The training procedure begins by placing the animal, nose facing the wall, into the empty chamber at a position in the center of a long wall. After 1 minute of re-habituation, the animal was removed from the chamber and placed in a holding cage for a period of 10 seconds. During this delay, two identical objects were placed 8 cm from the sides of the two short walls of the chamber; object pairs are randomly assigned within and between conditions. The animal was then returned to the chamber for a 3-15 minute period of exploration. After the training session, the animal is returned to its home cage. The animals remain in the testing room for approximately 15 minutes after the last animal was trained before being returned to their colony room. Step 4. Following a delay interval (1 hour to several weeks, but usually 24 hours), the animals were again returned to the testing room and acclimated as described in Step 1. After this, individual animals are re-habituated to the empty chamber for 1 minute as was described in Step 3. For the test, two new objects are placed in the chamber: one was identical to the objects used during training, while the other was novel. The position of the novel object was randomized for each animal. The animals were allowed to actively explore for 3-15 minutes. During the test period, the amount of time spent exploring either the novel or the familiar object was recorded using a hand held timer and video tape recorder or computer-based object exploration analysis program."
