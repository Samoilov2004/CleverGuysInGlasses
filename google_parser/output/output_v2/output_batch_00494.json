Anderson, et al. “Alpha-Synuclein Kinase.” The information contained in this file is hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nLewy body diseases (LBDs) are characterized by degeneration of the dopaminergic system, motor alterations, cognitive impairment, and formation of Lewy bodies (LBs). (McKeith et al., \nClinical and pathological diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies \n(\nDLB\n): \nReport of the CDLB International Workshop, Neurology \n(1996) 47:1113-24). LBDs include Parkinson's disease, Diffuse Lewy body disease (DLBD), Lewy body variant of Alzheimer's disease (LBV), combined Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the syndromes identified as multiple system atrophy (MSA). Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a term coined to reconcile differences in the terminology of LBDs. Disorders with LBs continue to be a common cause for movement disorders and cognitive deterioration in the aging population (Galasko et al., \nClinical\n-\nneuropathological correlations in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Arch. Neurol\n. (1994) 51:888-95). Although their incidence continues to increase, creating a serious public health problem, to date these disorders lack approved treatments (Tanner et al., \nEpidemiology of Parkinson's disease and akinetic syndromes, Curr. Opin. Neurol\n. (2000) 13:427-30). The cause for LBDs is controversial and multiple factors have been proposed to play a role, including various neurotoxins and genetic susceptibility factors.\n\n\nIn recent years, new hope for understanding the pathogenesis of LBDs has emerged. Specifically, several studies have shown that the synaptic protein alpha-synuclein plays a central role in PD pathogenesis because: (1) this protein accumulates in LBs (Spillantini et al., \nNature \n(1997) 388:839-40; Takeda et al., \nJ. Pathol\n. (1998) 152:367-72; Wakabayashi et al., \nNeurosci. Lett\n. (1997) 239:45-8), (2) mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene co-segregate with rare familial forms of parkinsonism (Kruger et al., \nNature Gen\n. (1998) 18:106-8; Polymeropoulos, et al., \nScience \n(1997) 276:2045-7) and, (3) overexpression of alpha-synuclein in transgenic mice (Masliah et al., \nScience \n(2000) 287:1265-9) and \nDrosophila \n(Feany et al., \nNature \n(2000) 404:394-8) mimics several pathological aspects of PD.\n\n\nMany scientists believe that PD is a relatively late development in a systemic synucleinopathy and that “parkinsonism is just the tip of the iceberg” (Langston, \nAnnals of Neurology \n(2006) 59:591-596). For example, Lewy bodies have been described in sympathetic ganglia and in the myenteric plexus of the gut (Herzog E., \nDtch Z Nervenheilk \n(1928) 107: 75-80; Kupsky et al., \nNeurology \n(1987) 37:1253-1255). Various disorders have been associated with the presence of Lewy bodies. For example, Lewy bodies have been found in the brain stem of a patient with rapid eye movement sleep behavioral disorder (Uchiyama et al., \nNeurology \n(1995) 45:709-712). Olfactory dysfunction has been reported in many PD patients long before the development of parkinsonism. Examination of cardiac tissue from patients with incidental Lewy body disease and typical PD revealed synuclein-positive neuritis in the myocardium (Iwanaga et al., \nNeurology \n(1999) 52:1269-1271). There is also evidence that esophageal, lower bowel and bladder dysfunction are early manifestations of PD-related pathology in the peripheral autonomic system (Qualman et al., \nGastroenterology \n(1984) 87:848-856; Castell et al., \nNeurogasdtroenterol Motil \n(2001) 13:361-364; Hague et al., \nActa Neuropathol \n(\nBerl\n) (1997) 94:192-196). Thus, the fact that accumulation of alpha-synuclein in the brain and other tissues is associated with similar morphological and neurological alterations in species as diverse as humans, mice, and flies suggests that this molecule contributes to the development of PD.\n\n\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nIn one aspect, the invention provides methods of screening an agent for activity for treating a Lewy Body disease (LBD). Such diseases include Parkinson's disease (PD), Diffuse Lewy body disease (DLBD), Lewy body variant of Alzheimer's disease (LBV), combined PD and Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the syndromes identified as multiple system atrophy (MSA). Some methods entail identifying an agent that modulates the activity or expression of a kinase shown in Table 1A, B; C, Table 2, Table 11 or Table 12, and determining whether the agent shows activity useful in treating LBD in an animal model of the disease. In some methods the modulation is inhibition. In some methods, step (a) involves identifying whether the agent inhibits the kinase. In some methods, step (a) is performed in a cell transformed with a nucleic acid expressing the kinase and/or alpha-synuclein. In some methods, step (a) is performed in vitro. In some methods, step (b) is performed in a transgenic animal model of LBD disease, and the transgenic animal may have a transgene expressing human alpha-synuclein. Preferably, the kinase is at least one of: APEG1, PLK2, CDC7L1, PRKG1, MAPK13, GAK, RHOK, ADRBK1, ADRBK2, GRK2L, GRK5, GRK6, GRK7, IKBKB, CKII and MET and the modulation is inhibition. More preferably, the kinase is PLK2 or GRK6 and the modulation is inhibition. More preferably, the kinase is PLK2. Preferably in some methods, the kinase is PRKG1, MAPK13, or GAK and the modulation is activation. In some aspects, step (b) involves contacting the transgenic animal with the agent and determining whether the agent inhibits formation of deposits of alpha-synuclein relative to a control transgenic animal not treated with the agent.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention provides methods of effecting treatment or prophylaxis of a LBD. Some examples of the method involve administering to a patient suffering from or at risk of the disease, an effective regime of an agent effective to modulate activity or expression of a kinase. The kinase can be one of those shown in Table 1A, B or C, Table 2, Table 11 or Table 12. Preferably, the agent is an antibody to the kinase, a zinc finger protein that modulates expression of the kinase, or an antisense RNA, siRNA, ribozyme or RNA having a sequence complementary to a nucleic acid sequence of the kinase. In some methods, the modulation is inhibition, and preferably, the kinase is at least one of the following: APEG1, PLK2, CDC7L1, RHOK, ADRBK1, ADRBK2, GRK2L, GRK5, GRK6, GRK7, IKBKB, CKII and MET. More preferably, the kinase is PLK2 or GRK6. More preferably, the kinase is PLK2. In some of the methods, the kinase is at least one of PRKG1, MAPK13, and GAK, and the modulation is activation.\n\n\nIn one aspect the invention provides method of treating a patient diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease by administering a therapeutically effective amount of an agent that inhibits PLK2 activity. In an embodiment the agent preferentially inhibits PLK2 activity relative to inhibition of PLK1 activity and/or PLK3 activity and/or PLK4 activity. The agent may be, for example, an siRNA. In one embodiment the patient is not diagnosed or under treatment for cancer and/or is not diagnosed or under treatment for Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\nIn related aspects, the invention provides a method for inhibiting phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein in a mammalian cell by reducing polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2) activity in the cell such that phosphorylation of synuclein is reduced. In a related aspect, the invention provides a method for inhibiting phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein in a mammalian cell (e.g., a neuronal cell) by contacting the cell with a compound that reduces PLK2 activity in the cell such that phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein is reduced. For example, the agent may reduce expression of a PLK2 gene product.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments the agent preferentially reduces PLK2 activity relative to reduction of PLK1 activity, PLK2 activity, or PLK3 activity. In certain embodiments the agent has a molecular weight less than 4000. In one embodiment the agent is a synthetic compound. In some embodiments the agent is a polynucleotide that inhibits expression or translation of a PLK2 RNA transcript, such as an siRNA. In an embodiment, one strand of the double stranded region of the siRNA is perfectly complementary to a PLK2 transcript but not to a PLK1 transcript or a PLK3 transcript.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention provides methods of identifying a kinase that phosphorylates alpha-synuclein by transfecting a cell expressing alpha-synuclein with a nucleic acid having a sequence complementary to a gene encoding a kinase or zinc finger protein that specifically binds to the gene. The transfected nucleic acid or zinc finger protein inhibits expression of the kinase; and an amount of phosphorylated alpha-synuclein the cell can then be measured relative to a control cell not transfected with the siRNA or nucleic acid encoding the same. In this case, a reduction in phosphorylated alpha-synuclein will provide an indication that the kinase phosphorylates alpha-synuclein. Some methods also include measuring an amount of alpha-synuclein produced by the cell relative to a control cell not transfected with the nucleic acid. In some methods, the nucleic acid is an siRNA or a DNA molecule encoding the same.\n\n\nThe invention provides a method of identifying an agent reduces alpha-synuclein phosphorylation in a mammalian cell expressing alpha-synuclein. The method includes selecting an agent that a) reduces activity of PLK2 in a cell expressing PLK2 (and optionally expressing synuclein), and b) does not reduce activity of PLK1 in a cell expressing PLK1, or reduces activity of PLK1 at a higher EC\n50 \nthan for PLK2; and/or c) does not reduce activity of PLK3 in a cell expressing PLK3, or reduces activity of PLK3 at a higher EC\n50 \nthan for PLK2; and/or d) does not reduce activity of PLK4 in a cell expressing PLK4, or reduces activity of PLK4 at a higher EC\n50 \nthan for PLK2. The cell can be a mammalian cell overexpressing alpha-synuclein. In one embodiment the agent a) reduces activity of PLK2 in a cell expressing PLK2; b) does not reduce activity of PLK1 in a cell expressing PLK1, or reduces activity of PLK1 at a higher EC\n50 \nthan for PLK2; c) does not reduce activity of PLK3 in a cell expressing PLK3, or reduces activity of PLK3 at a higher EC\n50 \nthan for PLK2; and d) does not reduce activity of PLK4 in a cell expressing PLK4, or reduces activity of PLK4 at a higher EC\n50 \nthan for PLK2. In a further step, the method involves determining whether the selected agent shows activity useful in treating Lewy Body Disease in an animal model of the disease or a cellular model of the disease. Animal models include transgenic animals. Cellular models include neuronally-derived cell cultures and mammalian cells over-expressing alpha-synuclein. Activities that can be assayed include reduction of the proportion of total alpha-synuclein that is phosphorylated at serine-129 or a reduction in aggregation of alpha-synuclein in the cell.\n\n\nIn other aspects, the invention provides methods of method of screening an agent for activity for treating a Lewy Body disease (LBD), by identifying an agent that modulates the activity or expression of synphilin, and determining whether the agent shows activity useful in treating LBD in an animal model of the disease.\n\n\nIn other aspects, the invention provides methods for producing Ser-129 phosphorylated-alpha synuclein, by providing a plasmid encoding alpha-synuclein and a plasmid encoding PLK2 in a bacterial cell, culturing the cell so that the plasmids are co-expressing to produce alpha synuclein and PLK2 so that the PLK2 phosphorylates the alpha-synuclein in a bacterial cell, and isolating phosphorylated alpha-synuclein from the cell.\n\n\n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n\n \nFIGS. 1A-C\n show the results of the in vitro phosphorylation assay for alpha-synuclein phosphorylation by a variety of recombinant kinases. \nFIG. 1A\n shows total alpha-synuclein, \nFIG. 1B\n shows phosphorylation of the pser-129 (phospho-serine-129) of alpha-synuclein and \nFIG. 1C\n shows phosphorylation of the pser-87 (phospho-serine-87) of alpha-synuclein.\n\n\n \nFIGS. 1D-F\n show a study with recombinant kinases, including kinases from the GPCR-receptor kinase (GRK) family and PLK2. \nFIG. 1D\n shows total alpha-synuclein, \nFIG. 1E\n shows phosphorylation of the pser-129 of alpha-synuclein and \nFIG. 1F\n shows phosphorylation of the pser-87 of alpha-synuclein.\n\n\n \nFIGS. 2A\n and B show the results of kinase activity in vitro for various kinases. \nFIG. 2A\n shows the total (AS). \nFIG. 2B\n shows phosphor-\nserine\n 129.\n\n\n \nFIGS. 3A-C\n show the results of kinase activity in vitro for various kinases. \nFIG. 2A\n shows the total AS. \nFIG. 3B\n shows \nSerine\n 129. \nFIG. 3C\n shows phospho-serine 87.\n\n\n \nFIGS. 4A\n and B show the effect of phospholipid on the assay results in \nFIGS. 3A and 3B\n. \nFIG. 4A\n shows the total AS. \nFIG. 4B\n shows \nSerine\n 129.\n\n\n \nFIG. 5\n shows the results of transfection of cDNA to PLK2 into 293-synuclein cells.

Definitions\n\n\nThe term “agent” is used to describe a compound that has or may have a pharmacological activity. Agents include compounds that are known drugs, compounds for which pharmacological activity has been identified but which are undergoing further therapeutic evaluation, and compounds that are members of collections and libraries that are to be screened for a pharmacological activity.\n\n\nA “pharmacological” activity means that an agent exhibits an activity in a screening system that indicates that the agent is or may be useful in the prophylaxis or treatment of a disease. The screening system can be in vitro, cellular, animal or human. Agents can be described as having pharmacological activity notwithstanding that further testing may be required to establish actual prophylactic or therapeutic utility in treatment of a disease.\n\n\nA Lewy-like body is a deposit of alpha-synuclein found in a transgenic animal that resembles some or all of the characteristics of a Lewy body found in human patients. The preferred characteristics are a compact alpha-synuclein positive inclusion. These inclusions preferably form in an age-dependent manner. The formation of alpha-synuclein positive inclusions preferably results in observable cellular pathology, leading to loss of functionality of affected neurons. Loss of function of affected neurons can be determined through behavioral tests, neuropharmacological response evaluation and electrophysiology.\n\n\nThe phrase “specifically binds” refers to a binding reaction which is determinative of the presence of the protein in the presence of a heterogeneous population of proteins and other biologics. Thus, under designated conditions, a specified ligand binds preferentially to a particular protein and does not bind in a significant amount to other proteins present in the sample. A molecule such as an antibody that specifically binds to a protein often has an association constant of at least 10\n6\nM\n−1 \nor 10\n7 \nM\n−1\n, preferably 10\n8\nM\n−1 \nto 10\n9 \nM\n−1\n, and more preferably, about 10\n10 \nM\n−1 \nto 10\n11 \nM\n−1 \nor higher. A variety of immunoassay formats may be used to select antibodies specifically immunoreactive with a particular protein. For example, solid-phase ELISA immunoassays are routinely used to select monoclonal antibodies specifically immunoreactive with a protein. See, e.g., Harlow and Lane (1988) Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Publications, New York, for examples of immunoassay formats and conditions that can be used to determine specific immunoreactivity.\n\n\nFor sequence comparison, typically one sequence acts as a reference sequence, to which test sequences are compared. When using a sequence comparison algorithm, test and reference sequences are input into a computer, subsequent coordinates are designated, if necessary, and sequence algorithm program parameters are designated. The sequence comparison algorithm then calculates the percent sequence identity for the test sequence(s) relative to the reference sequence, based on the designated program parameters.\n\n\nOptimal alignment of sequences for comparison can be conducted, e.g., by the local homology algorithm of Smith & Waterman, \nAdv. Appl. Math. \n2:482 (1981), by the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman & Wunsch, \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n48:443 (1970), by the search for similarity method of Pearson & Lipman, \nProc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA \n85:2444 (1988), by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Dr., Madison, Wis.), or by visual inspection (see generally Ausubel et al., supra).\n\n\nAnother example of algorithm that is suitable for determining percent sequence identity and sequence similarity is the BLAST algorithm, which is described in Altschul et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n215:403-410 (1990). Software for performing BLAST analyses is publicly available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). This algorithm involves first identifying high scoring sequence pairs (HSPs) by identifying short words of length W in the query sequence, which either match or satisfy some positive-valued threshold score T when aligned with a word of the same length in a database sequence. T is referred to as the neighborhood word score threshold (Altschul et al., supra.). These initial neighborhood word hits act as seeds for initiating searches to find longer HSPs containing them. The word hits are then extended in both directions along each sequence for as far as the cumulative alignment score can be increased. Cumulative scores are calculated using, for nucleotide sequences, the parameters M (reward score for a pair of matching residues; always >0) and N (penalty score for mismatching residues; always <0). For amino acid sequences, a scoring matrix is used to calculate the cumulative score. Extension of the word hits in each direction are halted when: the cumulative alignment score falls off by the quantity X from its maximum achieved value; the cumulative score goes to zero or below, due to the accumulation of one or more negative-scoring residue alignments; or the end of either sequence is reached. For identifying whether a nucleic acid or polypeptide is within the scope of the invention, the default parameters of the BLAST programs are suitable. The BLASTN program (for nucleotide sequences) uses as defaults a word length (W) of 11, an expectation (E) of 10, M=5, N=−4, and a comparison of both strands. For amino acid sequences, the BLASTP program uses as defaults a word length (W) of 3, an expectation (E) of 10, and the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix. The TBLATN program (using protein sequence for nucleotide sequence) uses as defaults a word length (W) of 3, an expectation (E) of 10, and a BLOSUM 62 scoring matrix. (see Henikoff & Henikoff, \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n89:10915 (1989)).\n\n\nIn addition to calculating percent sequence identity, the BLAST algorithm also performs a statistical analysis of the similarity between two sequences (see, e.g., Karlin & Altschul, \nProc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA \n90:5873-5787 (1993)). One measure of similarity provided by the BLAST algorithm is the smallest sum probability (P(N)), which provides an indication of the probability by which a match between two nucleotide or amino acid sequences would occur by chance. For example, a nucleic acid is considered similar to a reference sequence if the smallest sum probability in a comparison of the test nucleic acid to the reference nucleic acid is less than about 0.1, more preferably less than about 0.01, and most preferably less than about 0.001.\n\n\nFor purposes of classifying amino acids substitutions as conservative or non-conservative, amino acids are grouped as follows: Group I (hydrophobic side chains): norleucine, met, ala, val, leu, ile; Group II (neutral hydrophilic side chains): cys, ser, thr; Group III (acidic side chains): asp, glu; Group IV (basic side chains): asn, gln, his, lys, arg; Group V (residues influencing chain orientation): gly, pro; and Group VI (aromatic side chains): trp, tyr, phe. Conservative substitutions involve substitutions between amino acids in the same class. Non-conservative substitutions constitute exchanging a member of one of these classes for a member of another.\n\n\nTherapeutic agents of the invention are typically substantially pure from undesired contaminant. This means that an agent is typically at least about 50% w/w (weight/weight) purity, as well as being substantially free from interfering proteins and contaminants. Sometimes the agents are at least about 80% w/w and, more preferably at least about 90%, at least about 95%, or at least about 99% w/w purity. However, using conventional protein purification techniques, homogeneous peptides of at least 99% w/w can be obtained.\n\n\nThe term “antibody” or “immunoglobulin” is used to include intact antibodies and binding fragments thereof. Typically, fragments compete with the intact antibody from which they were derived for specific binding to an antigen fragment including separate heavy chains, light chains Fab, Fab′ F(ab′)2, Fabc, and Fv. Fragments are produced by recombinant DNA techniques, or by enzymatic or chemical separation of intact immunoglobulins. The term “antibody” also includes one or more immunoglobulin chains that are chemically conjugated to, or expressed as, fusion proteins with other proteins. The term “antibody” also includes bispecific antibody. A bispecific or bifunctional antibody is an artificial hybrid antibody having two different heavy/light chain pairs and two different binding sites. Bispecific antibodies can be produced by a variety of methods including fusion of hybridomas or linking of Fab′ fragments. See, e.g., Songsivilai & Lachmann, \nClin. Exp. Immunol. \n79:315-321 (1990); Kostelny et al., \nJ. Immunol. \n148, 1547-1553 (1992).\n\n\nA symptom of a disorder means a phenomenon experienced by an individual having the disorder indicating a departure from normal function, sensation or appearance.\n\n\nA sign of a disorder is any bodily manifestation that serves to indicate presence or risk of a disorder.\n\n\nThe term “patient” includes human and other mammalian subjects that receive either prophylactic or therapeutic treatment.\n\n\nAs used herein, “treating” a condition (e.g., Parkinson's Disease) or patient refers to taking steps to obtain beneficial or desired result. For purposes of this invention, beneficial or desired results include, but are not limited to, alleviation or amelioration of one or more symptoms of Parkinson's Disease, diminishment of extent of disease, delay or slowing of disease progression, amelioration, palliation or stabilization of the disease state.\n\n\nAs used herein, a “therapeutically effective amount” of a drug is an amount of a drug that, when administered to a subject diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, or diagnosed as being at high risk for developing Parkinson's disease will have the intended therapeutic effect, e.g., alleviation, amelioration, palliation or elimination of one or more manifestations of the disease in the subject. The full therapeutic effect does not necessarily occur by administration of one dose, and may occur only after administration of a series of doses. Thus, a therapeutically effective amount may be administered in one or more administrations.\n\n\nCompositions or methods “comprising” one or more recited elements may include other elements not specifically recited. For example, a composition that comprises alpha-synuclein peptide encompasses both an isolated alpha-synuclein peptide and alpha-synuclein peptide as a component of a larger polypeptide sequence.\n\n\nUnless otherwise apparent from the context, each embodiment, element, step or feature of the invention can be used in combination with any other.\n\n\nII. General\n\n\nThe invention is premised in part on the insight that Lewy Body diseases (LBDs) can be inhibited by inhibiting one or more kinases that phosphorylate alpha-synuclein and/or inhibit its production. Although practice of the invention is not dependent on an understanding of mechanism, it is believed that phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein at serine-129 is one of a series of molecular events leading to formation of intracellular deposits of alpha-synuclein. Alpha-synuclein phosphorylated at ser-129 is highly enriched in Lewy bodies (LBs) in Diffuse Lewy body disease (DLBD), multiple system atrophy (MSA) and familial forms of Parkinson's Disease (PD). The abnormal accumulation of phospho-alpha-synuclein in LBs indicates that phospho-synuclein may be a pathogenic species that drives LB formation, and that the kinase(s) responsible for its phosphorylation or which regulates production of alpha-synuclein itself are therapeutic target(s) for treatment of multiple synucleinopathies. Other events in this series likely include proteolytic cleavages following phosphorylation (see WO 2005/013889, filed May 19, 2004).\n\n\nIdentification of the kinase(s) primarily responsible for phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein allows compounds that reduce activity of the relevant kinase(s) to be identified. For convenience, reference herein to “phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein” refers to phosphorylation at Serine-129 (but does not exclude additional phosphorylation elsewhere, e.g., Serine-87).\n\n\nThe present application reports identification of several kinases where reduction in kinase activity is accompanied by a reduction of phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein and/or a reduction in total alpha-synuclein level. In particular, the kinase PLK2 can be inhibited to reduce phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein. The invention provides methods of (i) identifying modulators of the activity and expression of these kinases, (ii) methods of treating Lewy body diseases using kinase inhibitors, and (iii) exemplary kinase inhibitors for use in treating Lewy body diseases.\n\n\nAs discussed in the Examples, infra, we have carried out a variety of experiments to identify kinases important in phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein.

Identification of Target Kinases\n\n\nKinases that directly or indirectly modulate phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein can be identified as shown in the Examples. In general, a library of potential inhibitors is designed based on the known sequences of a collection of kinase genes. The members of the library can be any of the types of molecule described above. Members of the library are then introduced into cells expressing alpha-synuclein. Preferably both the cells and the alpha-synuclein are human. Usually, such cells are transfected with both DNA encoding human alpha-synuclein and DNA encoding the library member to be tested. Library members can be screened individually or en masse. After introduction of a library member, and culturing for a period sufficient for the library member to be expressed and effect repression of its kinase, the levels of total alpha-synuclein and phosphorylated alpha-synuclein are measured and compared with corresponding levels in an otherwise similar control cell not treated with a library member to suppress expression of a kinase. Measurements can be made by immunoassay using an antibody specific for alpha-synuclein (preferably human alpha-synuclein) to measure total levels of alpha-synuclein, and an antibody specific for phosphorylated alpha-synuclein to measure the level of phosphorylated alpha-synuclein. Exemplary antibodies are described in WO05047860, incorporated herein by reference. A reduction in level of phosphorylated alpha-synuclein between the treated and control cell that is significant in the sense of being outside the typical margin of error for measurements, indicates that the inhibitor introduced into the cell inhibited a kinase, which directly or indirectly affected phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein. The identity of the kinase can be determined from the identity of inhibitor, either by screening inhibitors individually, or if inhibitors are screened en masse, by sequencing the nucleic acid encoding the inhibitor. Likewise a reduction in the total level of alpha-synuclein between treated and control cells that is outside the margin of typical experimental error in measuring such levels provides an indication that the inhibitor inhibits a kinase that indirectly affects the expression level of alpha-synuclein.\n\n\nKinases identified by the initial screen, particularly, kinases known to be serine kinases, can then be tested for their capacity to phosphorylate alpha-synuclein in vitro, in cells or in transgenic animal models. An in vitro assay is an indication of whether a kinase directly phosphorylates alpha-synuclein and is therefore only useful for the kinases identified in the initial screen which are thought to be capable of directly phosphorylating alpha-synuclein. Cellular and transgenic assays can be used to screen kinases that affect phosphorylation either directly or indirectly. In vitro assays may be performed by contacting alpha-synuclein with the kinase under test and ATP in a suitable buffer. Preferably, the ATP is γ-32P ATP, in which case phosphorylated alpha-synuclein is radiolabeled and can be detected on a gel. Phosphorylation can also be measured using an antibody specific to phosphorylated alpha-synuclein as described before. Alternatively, phosphorylation can be measured indirectly by measuring ATP consumption using a coupled assay, in which ADP is detected as described for example by \nNature \n78, 632 (1956); \nMol. Pharmacol. \n6, 31-40 (1970). The extent of phosphorylation can be compared with a control in which the kinase or ATP or both is/are omitted. An increase in phosphorylation is an indication that the kinase directly phosphorylates alpha-synuclein. Cellular assays are performed on cells expressing alpha-synuclein, preferably human alpha-synuclein transfected into the cells. A nucleic acid capable of expressing the kinase is also transfected into the cells. The level of phosphorylated alpha-synuclein in the cells is measured relative to that in similar control cells lacking the transfected kinase. An increase in phosphorylation is an indication that the kinase directly or indirectly phosphorylates alpha-synuclein. Transgenic assays can be performed by comparing a transgenic animal expressing human alpha-synuclein disposed to develop Lewy body-like deposits with a similar animal also expressing a kinase transgene. A reduction in phosphorylated alpha-synuclein and/or in Lewy body-like deposits in the transgenic animal with the additional kinase transgene relative to the transgenic animal with just the alpha-synuclein transgene is an indication that the kinase is directly or indirectly involved in phosphorylating alpha-synuclein.\n\n\nIV. Target Kinases\n\n\nTables 1A, 1B and 1C show proteins whose inhibition modulates the phosphorylation at position ser-129. Table 1A shows kinases that can phosphorylate serine and/or threonine residues and sometimes tyrosine. Table 1B shows tyrosine kinases that cannot (so far as is known) modify serine residues. Table 1C shows kinases that phosphorylate non-protein targets but are not known to phosphorylate proteins. Kinases from the upper portion of Table 1A are candidates for direct phosphorylation of ser-129 of alpha-synuclein. Kinases from the upper part of Table 1B are also useful therapeutic targets via roles indirectly phosphorylating alpha-synuclein. Proteins in the upper part of Table 1C are also useful therapeutic targets for the same reason. Cols. 1, 2 and 3 of each table indicate the gene name, kinase name and Genbank accession number of kinases. The next column indicates whether treatment of cells with siRNA to that kinase decreased (“down”) or increased (“up”) phosphorylation of ser-129. The next three columns indicate the number of standard deviations the measured level of phosphorylation departs from the mean in three independent experiments. The final two columns indicate the kinase family (i.e., amino acid specificity) and group.\n\n\nTable 2 shows kinases whose inhibition modulates the overall levels of human alpha-synuclein without changing the percentage of phosphorylation. Table 2 shows all of the kinases with the strongest reduction in levels of human alpha-synuclein. The columns are labeled similarly to Tables 1A, 1B and 1C.\n\n\nTables 3 and 4 show kinases from Tables 1 and 2 that were confirmed in the Examples to modulate overall levels of human alpha-synuclein. The kinases that were verified include PLK2, APEG1, CDC7L1, MET, GRK1, 2, 6, and 7 as kinases that phosphorylate alpha-synuclein directly or indirectly. The kinases that were found to increase alpha-synuclein phosphorylation when inhibited, PRKG1, MAPK13, and GAK, are likely to function as negative regulators of alpha-synuclein phosphorylation. Further data from phosphorylation studies in vitro identified PKL2, GRK2, 5, 6, and 7 as capable of phosphorylating alpha-synuclein in vitro and also identified CKII and IKBKB. Further studies in cell culture showed that PLK2 and GPRK6 could directly phosphorylate alpha-synuclein in cell culture. These data were substantiated with immunohistochemistry. In summary, PLK2 and, to a lesser extent, GRK6 are particularly preferred targets for therapeutic intervention in Lewy body diseases because they can directly phosphorylate alpha-synuclein. Agents that inhibit PLK2 and GRK6 also inhibit phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein and thus can be used in treatment or prophylaxis of Lewy body disease.\n\n\nIn the Examples, below, transfection of cells with siRNA and knockdown of specific kinase targets was employed to identify kinases that modulated alpha-synuclein phosphorylation directly or indirectly. Subsequent experiments in vitro and in cell culture showed that two of these kinases, PLK2 directly and specifically phosphorylated the \nserine\n 129 of alpha-synuclein. Further experiments showed that PLK2 phosphorylated the \nserine\n 129 of alpha-synuclein to a much greater extent than GRK6 and other kinases described herein under the experimental conditions used. Thus, PLK2 is very likely a synuclein kinase. Additional evidence that PLK2 is a synuclein kinase is provided in Examples 11-16. Synuclein phosphorylation is reduced in cells treated with siRNA directed to PLK2, inhibitors of PLK2 activity reduce synuclein phosphorylation in a variety of cell types including primary neuronal cultures and cells over expressing PLK2, inhibitors affect endogenous kinase in with an EC\n50 \nconsistent with the EC\n50 \nobserved for their effect on PLK2.\n\n\nPLK2 is a Polo like kinase that is a G1 cell cycle protein, has a rapid turnover in cells, and is expressed in brain where it is involved in synaptic plasticity. The PLK family members are serine/threonine kinases, and contains four members that have an N-terminal kinase domain and a C-terminal regulatory domain consisting of two (PLKs 1-3) or one (PLK4) polo-box domains. The polo-box domain serves to bind to scaffolding proteins that then target the PLKs to specific sub-cellular locations and to phosphorylate their target proteins (Seeburg, D. P. et al, \nOncogene, \n2005). The polo-box also serves to negatively regulate the kinase domain by adopting a conformation that prevents kinase activity. Upon binding of the polo-box to a scaffolding protein, the polo-box is removed from the kinase domain, whereupon the kinase becomes active and is able to phosphorylate its substrate/s. Polo-like kinases are described in Seeburg et al., 2005, “Polo-like kinases in the nervous system” \nOncogene \n24:292-8; Lowery et al., 2005, “Structure and function of Polo-like kinases” \nOncogene \n24:248-59; and Winkles et al., 2005, “Differential regulation of polo-\nlike kinase\n 1, 2, 3, and 4 gene expression in mammalian cells and tissues” \nOncogene \n24:260-6.

An exemplary accession number for PLK2 is provided Table 1A. The sequence for PLK2 can also be found in any one of Ma, et al. \nMol. Cell. Biol. \n23 (19), 6936-6943 (2003), Burns, et al. \nMol.

PLK2 is also called SNK; for consistency, the name PLK2 is used throughout the present patent application.\n\n\nAPEG1, CDC7L1, MET, IKBKB, CKII, GRK1, GRK2, GRK6 and GRK7 are also targets for therapeutic intervention in Lewy body diseases because they are likely to be indirect activators of the direct kinase(s). Thus, agents that inhibit APEG1, CDC7L1, MET, IKBKB, CKII, GRK1, GRK2, GRK6 and GRK7 also inhibit phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein and can be used for treatment or prophylaxis of Lewy body disease. PRKG1, MAPK13, and GAK are negative regulators of the phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein. Thus, agents that activate these kinases decrease phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein and can be used in treatment or prophylaxis of Lewy body disease.\n\n\nGRK6, also called GPRK6, is a G protein-coupled receptor kinase and is involved in signal transduction. G protein-coupled receptor kinases phosphorylate and desensitize ligand-activated G protein-coupled receptors. GRK6 expression has previously been shown to be significantly elevated in the MPTP-lesioned group in most brain regions. For the purposes of consistency, the name GRK6 will be used throughout the present patent application. An exemplary accession number is provided in Table 1A.

Reference to the amino acid or nucleic acid sequence of synphilin includes the amino acid or nucleic acid sequence of any of these references and allelic variants thereof.\n\n\nV. Agents to Modulate Synuclein Kinase Activity or Expression\n\n\nIn one aspect, the invention provides methods of effecting treatment or prophylaxis of an LBD by administering an agent that modulates activity or expression of a kinase described herein. A number of agents of well-characterized general classes can be used. Without limitation these include inhibitory nucleic acids (e.g., siRNA, antisense RNA, ribozymes), inhibitory proteins (e.g., zinc finger proteins), antibodies, and small molecule inhibitors.\n\n\nPreferably the gene to be inhibited is PLK2 or GRK6 because the kinases encoded by these genes directly phosphorylate alpha-synuclein, and particularly PLK2. APEG1, CDC7L1, MET GRK1, GRK2, GRK6, IKBKB, CKII and GRK7 genes are also preferred targets for inhibition because they are likely to encode indirect activators of the direct kinase(s). PRKG1, MAPK13, and GAK are preferred candidates for activation in Lewy body diseases because they encode negative regulators of the phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein. The synphilin gene is a preferred target for inhibition because, although synphilin is not a kinase, it is associated with increased phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein (typically in the presence of a kinase such as PLK2).\n\n\nInhibitors that show specificity for PLK2 over one or more other polo-like kinase family members (i.e., PLK1, PLK3, and PLK4) are preferred. Inhibitors especially suited for therapeutic use may be identified by selecting for at least one of the following properties:\n\n \n \n \n \nI. Inhibits PLK2 activity and has no, or reduced, effect on PLK1.\n \nII. Inhibits PLK2 activity and has no, or reduced, effect on PLK3.\n \nIII. Inhibits PLK2 activity and has no, or reduced, effect on PLK4.\n \nIV. Inhibits PLK2 activity and has no, or reduced, effect on PLK1 and PLK3.\n \nV. Inhibits PLK2 activity and has no, or reduced, effect on PLK1 and PLK4.\n \nVI. Inhibits PLK2 activity and has no, or reduced, effect on PLK1, PLK3 and PLK4.\n \n \n \n\n\nAs used in this context, “no effect” means administration of the agent does not reduce expression, or reduces expression by a physiologically insignificant degree. “Reduced effect” means that the EC\n50 \nor K\ni \nvalues for inhibiting PLK2 is lower than the EC\n50 \nfor the reference PLK(s). In some embodiments the EC\n50 \nmay be at least 2-fold lower, and is sometimes at least 10-fold lower, and may be at least 100-fold, or even at least 1000-fold lower.\n\n\nAs used in this context, inhibition of PLK2 “activity” can result from reducing protein expression (e.g., reducing expression of the PLK2 gene, interfering with processing of PLK2 RNA, reducing the half-life of PLK2 mRNA or protein) or by competitive or noncompetitive inhibition of the PLK2 kinase activity.\n\n\nInhibitors that show specificity for PLK2 over non-polo kinases, especially other kinases expressed in the tissues to which the agent is delivered are especially preferred. In preferred embodiments the agent does not inhibit non-polo kinases (or has a EC\n50 \ngreater than 10-times higher, sometimes 100-times greater, and sometimes greater than 1000-times higher) for non-polo kinases compared to PLK2. However, inhibition of other kinases may be tolerated depending on the role and expression of the kinase. For example, a kinase that functions in the gut may not be affected by an inhibitor delivered to the brain.\n\n\nTo further guide the reader, inhibitory nucleic acids (e.g., siRNA, antisense RNA, ribozymes), inhibitory proteins (e.g., zinc finger proteins), antibodies, and small molecule inhibitors are discussed below.\n\n\nA. Inhibitory Polynucleotides\n\n\nSeveral examples of inhibitors of target kinases, including PLK2, are described below. Polynucleotide inhibitors are designed to bind specific target sequences within a target transcript. Preferably the inhibitors bind to a target site in a PLK2 RNA without binding a target site in: PLK1 and/or PLK3 and/or PLK4. Suitable target sites are identified by selecting segments of PLK2 that have no exact corresponding segment in other PLKs. Preferably, a selected segment of PLK2 lacks a corresponding segment having substantial sequence identity (for example, a selected segment from PLK2 should show less than 95, 90, 75 or 50% sequence identity with the closest corresponding segment in PLK4). A selected target segment is also preferably screened against a gene database to ensure that it does not show significant sequence identity with unrelated genes by chance.\n\n\nPolynucleotide inhibitors of PLK2 preferably show at least 30, 50, 75, 95, or 99% inhibition of levels of PLK2 mRNA or protein with little or no detectable reduction in levels of PLK1 and/or PLK3 and/or PLK4 mRNA or protein (i.e, less than 10, 5 or 1% inhibition). Protein expression can be quantified by forming immunological analyses using an antibody that specifically binds to the protein followed by detection of complex formed between the antibody and protein. mRNA levels can be quantified by, for example, dot blot analysis, in-situ hybridization, RT-PCR, quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (i.e., the so-called “TaqMan” methods), Northern blots and nucleic acid probe array methods.\n\n\ni) Short Inhibitory RNAs\n\n\nsiRNAs are relatively short, at least partly double stranded, RNA molecules that serve to inhibit expression or translation of a complementary mRNA transcript, such as a kinase transcript. Although an understanding of mechanism is not required for practice of the invention, it is believed that siRNAs act by inducing degradation of a complementary mRNA transcript. Principles for design and use of siRNAs generally are described by WO 99/32619, Elbashir, \nEMBO J. \n20, 6877-6888 (2001) and Nykanen et al., \nCell \n107, 309-321 (2001); WO 01/29058. siRNAs are formed from two strands of at least partly complementary RNA, each strand preferably of 10-30, 15-25, or 17-23 or 19-21 nucleotides long. The strands can be perfectly complementary to each other throughout their length or can have single stranded 3′-overhangs at one or both ends of an otherwise double stranded molecule. Single stranded overhangs, if present, are usually of 1-6 bases with 1 or 2 bases being preferred. The antisense strand of an siRNA is selected to be substantially complementary (e.g., at least 80, 90, 95% and preferably 100% complementary) to a segment of a transcript from a gene of the invention. Any mismatched bases preferably occur at or near the ends of the strands of the siRNA. Mismatched bases at the ends can be deoxyribonucleotides. The sense strand of an siRNA shows an analogous relationship with the complement of the segment of the gene transcript of interest. siRNAs having two strands, each having 19 bases of perfect complementarity, and having two unmatched bases at the 3′ end of the sense strand and one at the 3′ end of the antisense strand are particularly suitable.\n\n\nIf an siRNA is to be administered as such, as distinct from the form of DNA encoding the siRNA, then the strands of an siRNA can contain one or more nucleotide analogs. The nucleotide analogs are located at positions at which inhibitor activity is not substantially affected, e.g. in a region at the 5′-end and/or the 3′-end, particularly single stranded overhang regions. Preferred nucleotide analogues are sugar- or backbone-modified ribonucleotides. Nucleobase-modified ribonucleotides, i.e. ribonucleotides, containing a non-naturally occurring nucleobase instead of a naturally occurring nucleobase such as uridines or cytidines modified at the 5-position, e.g. 5-(2-amino)propyl uridine, 5-bromo uridine; adenosines and guanosines modified at the 8 position, e.g. 8-bromo guanosine; deaza nucleotides, e.g. 7-deaza-adenosine; O- and N-alkylated nucleotides, e.g. N6-methyl adenosine are also suitable. In preferred sugar-modified ribonucleotides, the 2′ OH-group is replaced by a group selected from H, OR, R, halo, SH, SR, NH2, NHR, NR2 or CN, wherein R is C1-C6 alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl and halo is F, CI, Br or I. In preferred backbone-modified ribonucleotides the phosphoester group connecting to adjacent ribonucleotides is replaced by a modified group, e.g. of phosphothioate group. A further preferred modification is to introduce a phosphate group on the 5′ hydroxide residue of an siRNA. Such a group can be introduced by treatment of an siRNA with ATP and T4 kinase. The phosphodiester linkages of natural RNA can also be modified to include at least one of a nitrogen or sulfur heteroatom. Modifications in RNA structure can be tailored to allow specific genetic inhibition while avoiding a general panic response in some organisms which is generated by dsRNA. Likewise, bases can be modified to block the activity of adenosine deaminase.\n\n\nOne example of such an agent is siRNA specific for PLK2. siRNAs to the gene encoding PLK2 can be specifically designed using methods described below. An exemplary accession number for PLK2 is [NM\n—\n006622] as provided in Table 1A. The amino acid sequence of human PLK2 is also set forth as SEQ ID NO:2 and SEQ ID NO:1 is the nucleic acid sequence encoding the amino acid sequence.

advantage of inhibitory polynucleotides is that they can be designed to be highly target specific. For example, siRNAs specific for PLK2 can be designed using target sequences that distinguish PLK2 from other PLKs. The program “siDESIGN” (Dharmacon, Inc., Lafayette, Colo.) can be used to predict siRNA sequences for any nucleic acid sequence, and is available on the World Wide Web at dharmacon.com. A number of other programs for designing siRNAs are available from others, including Genscript (available on the Web at genscript.com/ss1-bin/app/rnai) and from the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research jura.wi.mit.edu/pubint/http://iona.wi.mit.edu/siRNAext/. Guidelines for designing siRNA are available in the scientific literature (see, e.g., Elbashir et al., 2001, “Duplexes of 21-nucleotide RNAs mediate RNA interference in cultured mammalian cells” \nNature. \n411:494-8.; and Elbashir et al., 2001, “RNA interference is mediated by 21- and 22-nucleotide RNAs” \nGenes Dev. \n15:188-200) and published on the Web (see, e.g., “rnaiweb.com/RNAi/siRNA_Design/” and “protocol-online.org/prot/Protocols/Rules-of-siRNA-design-for-RNA-interference—RNAi—3210.html”).\n\n\nThere are a variety of ways to produce siRNAs. siRNAs can be generated using kits which generate siRNA from the kinase (e.g., PLK2) gene. For example, the “Dicer siRNA Generation” kit (catalog number T510001, Gene Therapy Systems, Inc., San Diego, Calif.) uses the recombinant human enzyme “dicer” in vitro to cleave long double stranded RNA into 22 bp siRNAs. By producing a mixture of siRNAs, the kit permits a high degree of success in generating siRNAs that will reduce expression of the target gene. Similarly, the Silencer™ siRNA Cocktail Kit (RNase III) (catalog no. 1625, Ambion, Inc., Austin, Tex.) generates a mixture of siRNAs from dsRNA using RNase III instead of dicer. Like dicer, RNase III cleaves dsRNA into 12-30 bp dsRNA fragments with 2 to 3 nucleotide 3′ overhangs, and 5′-phosphate and 3′-hydroxyl termini. According to the manufacturer, dsRNA is produced using T7 RNA polymerase, and reaction and purification components included in the kit. The dsRNA is then digested by RNase III to create a population of siRNAs. The kit includes reagents to synthesize long dsRNAs by in vitro transcription and to digest those dsRNAs into siRNA-like molecules using RNase III. The manufacturer indicates that the user need only supply a DNA template with opposing T7 phage polymerase promoters or two separate templates with promoters on opposite ends of the region to be transcribed.\n\n\nThe siRNAs of the invention can also be expressed from vectors. Typically, such vectors are administered in conjunction with a second vector encoding the corresponding complementary strand. Once expressed, the two strands anneal to each other and form the functional double stranded siRNA. One exemplar vector suitable for use in the invention is pSuper, available from OligoEngine, Inc. (Seattle, Wash.). In some embodiments, the vector contains two promoters, one positioned downstream of the first and in antiparallel orientation. The first promoter is transcribed in one direction, and the second in the direction antiparallel to the first, resulting in expression of the complementary strands. In yet another set of embodiments, the promoter is followed by a first segment encoding the first strand, and a second segment encoding the second strand. The second strand is complementary to the palindrome of the first strand. Between the first and the second strands is a section of RNA serving as a linker (sometimes called a “spacer”) to permit the second strand to bend around and anneal to the first strand, in a configuration known as a “hairpin.”\n\n\nThe formation of hairpin RNAs, including use of linker sections, is well known in the art. Typically, an siRNA expression cassette is employed, using a Polymerase III promoter such as human U6, mouse U6, or human H1. The coding sequence is typically a 19-nucleotide sense siRNA sequence linked to its reverse complementary antisense siRNA sequence by a short spacer. Nine-nucleotide spacers are typical, although other spacers can be designed. Further, 5-6 T's are often added to the 3′ end of the oligonucleotide to serve as a termination site for Polymerase III. See also, Yu et al., \nMol Ther \n7(2):228-36 (2003); Matsukura et al., \nNucleic Acids Res \n31(15):e77 (2003).\n\n\nThe siRNA targets can be targeted by hairpin siRNA as follows. To attack the same targets by short hairpin RNAs, produced by a vector (permanent RNAi effect), sense and antisense strand can be put in a row with a loop forming sequence in between and suitable sequences for an adequate expression vector to both ends of the sequence.\n\n\nThe siRNA of the invention can be made using any suitable method for producing a nucleic acid, such as the chemical synthesis and recombinant methods disclosed herein and known to one of skill in the art. It will be appreciated that the oligonucleotides can be made using nonstandard bases (e.g., other than adenine, cytidine, guanine, and uridine) or nonstandard backbone structures to provide desirable properties (e.g., increased nuclease-resistance, tighter-binding, stability or a desired Tm). Techniques for rendering oligonucleotides nuclease-resistant include those described in PCT Publication WO 94/12633. A wide variety of useful modified oligonucleotides may be produced, including oligonucleotides having a peptide-nucleic acid (PNA) backbone (Nielsen et al., 1991\n, Science \n254:1497) or incorporating 2′-O-methyl ribonucleotides, phosphorothioate nucleotides, methyl phosphonate nucleotides, phosphotriester nucleotides, phosphorothioate nucleotides, phosphoramidates.\n\n\nFor example and not limitation, the following are examples of siRNA sequences that can be used to inhibit PLK2. “Start position” refers to the sequence at accession number NM\n—\n006622.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSense Strand Sequence\n \n \nRegion\n \n \nStart Pos\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1\n \nCCGGAGATCTCGCGGATTA\n \nORF\n \n326\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2\n \nGGGGCAAAGTGCTGGGAAA\n \nORF\n \n378\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3\n \nTCACAGCAGAGTAGCTAAA\n \nORF\n \n469\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4\n \nGGGAAAAGATTGACAAAGA\n \nORF\n \n498\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5\n \nGATTGTGTCTGGACTGAAA\n \nORF\n \n691\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6\n \nGCACAGAGATCTCAAACTA\n \nORF\n \n733\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7\n \nACACAGAAGGAGAACGATA\n \nORF\n \n829\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8\n \nAGGAGAACGATATGTGGTA\n \nORF\n \n836\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n9\n \nCATAAGGGAAGCAAGGTAT\n \nORF\n \n1000\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n10\n \nGCTAGTATGTTGTCCAAAA\n \nORF\n \n1061\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n11\n \nGAAGACATCTACAAGCTTA\n \nORF\n \n1304\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n12\n \nCATCAATGAGGATAGGATA\n \nORF\n \n2062\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n13\n \nGACATGTGGTGGTACGAAA\n \n3′ UTR\n \n2281\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n14\n \nCAGAACAGGCTAAGGCATA\n \n3′ UTR\n \n2335\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n15\n \nGTGCATTCCTTGTTAATAA\n \n3′ UTR\n \n2660\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nThe siRNAs above were designed using the siDESIGN® center at www followed by dharmacon.com/DesignCenter/DesignCenterPage.aspx.

The particular mechanism by which the antisense molecule reduces expression is not critical. Typically antisense polynucleotides comprise a single-stranded antisense sequence of at least 7 to 10 to typically 20 or more nucleotides that specifically hybridize to a sequence from mRNA of a kinase gene of the invention. Some antisense polynucleotides are from about 10 to about 50 nucleotides in length or from about 14 to about 35 nucleotides in length. Some antisense polynucleotides are polynucleotides of less than about 100 nucleotides or less than about 200 nucleotides. In general, the antisense polynucleotide should be long enough to form a stable duplex but short enough, depending on the mode of delivery, to administer in vivo, if desired. The minimum length of a polynucleotide required for specific hybridization to a target sequence depends on several factors, such as G/C content, positioning of mismatched bases (if any), degree of uniqueness of the sequence as compared to the population of target polynucleotides, and chemical nature of the polynucleotide (e.g., methylphosphonate backbone, peptide nucleic acid, phosphorothioate), among other factors.\n\n\niv) Ribozymes\n\n\nRibozymes are RNA molecules that act as enzymes and can be engineered to cleave other RNA molecules at specific sites. The ribozyme itself is not consumed in this process, and can act catalytically to cleave multiple copies of mRNA target molecules. General rules for the design of ribozymes that cleave target RNA in trans are described in Haseloff & Gerlach, (1988) \nNature \n334:585-591 and Hollenbeck, (1987) \nNature \n328:596-603 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,496,698. Ribozymes typically include two flanking segments that show complementarity to and bind to two sites on a transcript (target subsites) of a gene encoding a kinase of the invention and a catalytic region between the flanking segments. The flanking segments are typically 5-9 nucleotides long and optimally 6 to 8 nucleotides long. The catalytic region of the ribozyme is generally about 22 nucleotides in length. The mRNA target contains a consensus cleavage site between the target subsites having the general formula NUN, and preferably GUC. (Kashani-Sabet and Scanlon, (1995) \nCancer Gene Therapy \n2:213-223; Perriman, et al., (1992) \nGene \n(\nAmst\n.) 113:157-163; Ruffner, et al., (1990) \nBiochemistry \n29: 10695-10702); Birikh, et al., (1997) \nEur. J. Biochem. \n245:1-16; Perrealt, et al., (1991) \nBiochemistry \n30:4020-4025). The specificity of a ribozyme can be controlled by selection of the target subsites and thus the flanking segments of the ribozyme that are complementary to such subsites. Ribozymes can be delivered either as RNA molecules or in the form of DNA encoding the ribozyme as a component of a replicable vector or in nonreplicable form as described below.\n\n\nExpression of a target kinase gene can also be reduced by delivering nucleic acids having sequences complementary to the regulatory region of the target gene (i.e., the target gene promoter and/or enhancers) to form triple helical structures which prevent transcription of the target gene in target cells in the body. See generally, Helene, (1991), \nAnticancer Drug Des., \n6(6):569-584; Helene, et al., (1992), \nAnn. N.Y. Acad. Sci., \n60:27-36; and Maher, (1992), \nBioassays \n14(12):807-815.\n\n\nv) Administration of siRNA and Other Inhibitory Nucleic Acids\n\n\nThe brain is the therapeutic target of kinase inhibitors of the invention. Therapeutic polynucleotides such as siRNAs, ribozymes and antisense polynucleotides can be administered in a number of ways. Methods of introduction include but are not limited to intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal, epidural, and oral routes. The compounds may be administered by any convenient route, for example by infusion, by bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings (e.g., oral, rectal and intestinal mucosa, etc.), and may be administered together with other biologically active agents. In general, therapeutic polynucleotides can be administered remotely (e.g., by i.v. injection) with a carrier that facilitates transfer to the brain or they can be delivered directly to the brain.\n\n\nFor direct administration to the brain, siRNAs (i.e., pharmaceutical compositions containing siRNAs) can be administered by any suitable route, including intraventricular and intrathecal injection; intraventricular injection may be facilitated by an intraventricular catheter, for example, attached to a reservoir, such as an Ommaya reservoir, direct injection or perfusion at the lesion site, injection into the brain arterial system, or by chemical or osmotic opening of the blood-brain barrier.\n\n\nIn one approach the therapeutic polynucleotide (e.g., siRNA) is delivered as a peptide conjugate. Kumar et al. exploited the fact that neurotropic viruses, such as rabies viruses, that preferentially infect the nervous system can penetrate the brain. The rabies virus achieves this through glycoprotein on its lipid envelope. To transfer siRNA to the neural cells in the brain, Kumar et al. identified a 29-residue peptide from the rabies virus glycoprotein (RVG) envelope that selectively binds to the acetylcholine receptor expressed by neurons. They fused this peptide with a sequence of 9 arginine residues that binds to siRNAs. After intravenous injection into mice with this peptide-conjugated siRNA, they found that the peptide not only enabled the transvascular delivery of siRNA to the brain but also resulted in efficient gene silencing (Kumar et al., (2007) Nature 448:39-43).\n\n\nThe therapeutic polynucleotide (e.g., siRNA) can be delivered using a liposome and targeted monoclonal antibody system. Pardridge reported that chemically modified liposomes conjugated to monoclonal antibodies raised against epidermal growth factor can penetrate mouse brain. Plasmid DNA encoding for short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was delivered to the brain following intravenous administration with pegylated immunoliposomes (PILs). The plasmid DNA is encapsulated in liposome, which is pegylated, and conjugated with receptor specific targeting monoclonal antibodies. Intravenous RNAi with PILs enables a 90% knockdown of the human epidermal growth factor receptor, which results in a 90% increase in survival time in mice with intra-cranial brain cancer (Pardridge, (2007) Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 59:141-152).\n\n\nSimilarly, Boado disclosed the use of the “Trojan Horse Liposome” (THL) technology as an effective delivery system to deliver shRNA to the brain. The tissue target specificity of THL is given by conjugation of approximately 1% of the PEG residues in the liposome to peptidomimetic monoclonal antibodies that bind to specific endogenous receptors (i.e. insulin and transferrin receptors) located on both the BBB and the brain cellular membranes, respectively. (Boado (2007) Pharm. Res. 24:1772-1787).\n\n\nThe therapeutic polynucleotide (e.g., siRNA) can be delivered by the combined use of receptor specific antibody delivery systems and avidin-biotin technology. The siRNA was mono-biotinylated on either terminus of the sense strand, in parallel with the production of a conjugate of the targeting monoclonal antibody and streptavidin. Rat glial cells permanently transfected with the luciferase gene were implanted in the brain of adult rats. Following the formation of intra-cranial tumors, the rats were treated with a single intravenous injection of biotinylated siRNA attached to a transferrin receptor antibody via a biotin-streptavidin linker. The intravenous administration of the siRNA caused a 69-81% decrease in luciferase gene expression in the intracranial brain cancer in vivo (Xia et al., (2007) Pharm. Res. 24:2309-2316).\n\n\nThe therapeutic polynucleotide (e.g., siRNA) can be delivered by stereotactic surgery or injection. Davidson and Boudreau reviewed in their article that siRNA can be delivered into the brain using neurosurgical method of stereotaxis and showed that a decrease in the transcription of certain genes alleviated symptoms of neuronal diseases (Davidson and Boudreau, (2007) Neuron 53:781-788).\n\n\nXia et al. reported that upon intracerebellar injection, recombinant adeno-associated virus vectors expressing short hairpin RNAs, which once expressed are processed into siRNAs, improved motor coordination, restored cerebellar morphology and resolved characteristic ataxin-1 inclusions in Purkinje cells of \nspinocerebellar ataxia type\n 1 mice (Xia et al., (2004) Nature Med. 10:816-820).\n\n\nFurther, DiFiglia et al. reported injecting intrastriatally cholesterol-conjugated siRNA that targets human huntingtin mRNA. The authors found that a single administration into the adult mouse striatum of the siRNA effected silencing of the gene, attenuated neuronal pathology, and delayed the abnormal behavioral phenotype observed in a rapid-onset, viral transgenic mouse model of Huntington's disease (DiFiglia et al. (2007) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 104:17204-17209). It is noted that such method results only in localized delivery around the injection site, with no widespread effect within the brain.\n\n\nSinger et al. disclosed using modified lentiviral vectors to deliver siRNAs into the brain cells of the transgenic mice that were producing vast amounts of human beta-amyloid and whose brains where littered with plaques. They found that lentiviral vector delivery of beta-secretase siRNA specifically reduced the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein and neurodegeneration in vivo and indicated that this approach could have potential therapeutic value for treatment of Alzheimer disease (Singer et al. (2005) Nature Neurosci. 8:1343-1349; reviewed in Orlacchio et al. (2007) Mini. Rev. Med. Chem. 7:1166-1176).\n\n\nKoutsilieri et al. reviewed the literature in the field of siRNA, disclosed different siRNA target strategies aiming for an allele-specific degradation of disease-inducing mRNA and its application in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease (HD) and spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA1) (Koutsilieri et al. (2007) J. Neural Transm Suppl. (72):43-49).\n\n\nHassani et al. demonstrated that cationic lipids and polyethylenimine (PEI) based polyplexes provided efficient delivery of siRNAs into the brains of new born mice, producing >80% inhibition of an exogenous gene with only picomolar levels of siRNA (Hassani et al. (2005) J. Gene Med. 7:198-207).\n\n\nKateb et al. employed nanotechnology as a method for delivering drugs to the brain for treatment of brain cancers. Specifically, the authors disclosed the use Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNTs) as nanovectors for transporting siRNA (Kateb et al. (2007) Neuroimage 37 Suppl 1:S9-17).\n\n\nThe therapeutic polynucleotide (e.g., siRNA) can be used in combination with other agents to improve or enhance the therapeutic effect of either. This process can involve administering both agents to the patient at the same time, either as a single composition or pharmacological formulation that includes both agents, or by administering two distinct compositions or formulations, wherein one composition includes the siRNA of the invention and the other includes the second agent(s). The siRNA therapy also can precede or follow the other agent treatment by intervals ranging from minutes to weeks.\n\n\nPolynucleotides can be delivered via a controlled release system. As an example, a pump may be used (Langer, supra; Sefton, 1987, CRC Crit. Ref. Biomed. Eng. 14:201-240; Buchwald et al., 1980, Surgery 88:507-516; Saudek et al., 1989, N. Engl. J. Med. 321:574-579). Alternatively, polymeric materials can be used (Medical Applications of Controlled Release, Langer and Wise, eds., CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla., 1974; Controlled Drug Bioavailability, Drug Product Design and Performance, Smolen and Ball, eds., Wiley, N.Y., 1984; Ranger and Peppas, 1983, Macromol. Sci. Rev. Macromol. Chem. 23:61; Levy et al., 1985, Science 228:190-192; During et al., 1989, Ann. Neurol. 25:351-356; Howard et al., 1989, J. Neurosurg. 71:858-863). In yet another alternative, a controlled release system can be placed in proximity of the therapeutic target, i.e., the brain, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose (e.g., Goodson, 1984, In: Medical Applications of Controlled Release, supra, Vol. 2, pp. 115-138). Other controlled release systems are discussed in the review by Langer (1990, Science 249:1527-1533).\n\n\nOther approaches can include the use of various transport and carrier systems, for example though the use of viral and/or non-viral delivery systems. For example, siRNA can be introduced into the brain in a virus modified to serve as a vehicle without causing pathogenicity. The virus can be, e.g., adenovirus, fowlpox virus, vaccinia virus, lentivirus, or neurotropic virus such as HIV, herpes simplex virus, flavivirus, or rabies virus. (Li et al., Methods Mol. Biol. 309:261-272 (2005); Davidson et al., Neuron 53:781-788 (2007); Xia et al., Nature Med 10:816-820 (2004); Kumar et al., Nature 448:39-43 (2007); U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,344,445, 6,924,144, 6,521,457). Furthermore, gene therapy approaches, for example as described in Kaplitt et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,180,613 and Davidson, WO 04/013280, can be used to express nucleic acid molecules in the brain.\n\n\nVarious non-viral delivery systems are known and can be used to administer a therapeutic polynucleotide (e.g., siRNA) to the brain, e.g., encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, microcapsules, by iontophoresis, or by incorporation into other vehicles, such as biodegradable polymers, hydrogels, cyclodextrins (see for example Gonzalez et al., 1999, Bioconjugate Chem., 10, 1068-1074; Wang et al., International PCT publication Nos. WO 03/47518 and WO 03/46185), poly(lactic-co-glycolic)acid (PLGA) and PLCA microspheres (see for example U.S. Pat. No. 6,447,796 and US Patent Application Publication No. US 2002130430), biodegradable nanocapsules, and bioadhesive microspheres, or by proteinaceous vectors (O'Hare and Normand, International PCT Publication No. WO 00/53722) or by the use of conjugates. For example, chemically modified liposomes encapsulating small hairpin RNA can be conjugated to monoclonal antibodies specific for specific endogenous receptors (e.g., such as insulin and transferrin) located on the blood brain barrier and brain cellular membranes (see Boado, Pharm. Res. 24(9):1772-1787 (2007)). As a further example, siRNA duplexes can be delivered with the combined use of receptor specific antibody delivery systems and avidin-biotin technology. The siRNA can be mono-biotinylated in parallel with the production of a conjugate of the targeting monoclonal antibody and streptavidin (see Xia et al., Pharm Res. 24(12):2309-16 (2007)). Other methods to deliver siRNA across plasma membranes in vivo include chemically modified siRNAs such as cholesterol-conjugated siRNAs (see DiFiglia et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 104(43):17204-9 (2007); Wolfrum et al., Nature Biotech. 25(10):1149-1157 (2007); Soutschek et al., Nature 432:173-178 (2003)).\n\n\nC. Zinc Finger Proteins\n\n\nZinc finger proteins can be engineered or selected to bind to any desired target site within a kinase gene of known sequence including, for example, PLK2. An exemplary motif characterizing one class of these proteins (C\n2\nH\n2 \nclass) is -Cys-(X)\n2-4\n-Cys-(X)\n12\n-His-(X)\n3-5\n-His (where X is any amino acid). A single finger domain is about 30 amino acids in length, and several structural studies have demonstrated that it contains an alpha helix containing the two invariant histidine residues and two invariant cysteine residues in a beta turn co-ordinated through zinc. In some methods, the target site is within a promoter or enhancer. In other methods, the target site is within the structural gene. In some methods, the zinc finger protein is linked to a transcriptional repressor, such as the KRAB repression domain from the human KOX-1 protein (Thiesen et al., \nNew Biologist \n2, 363-374 (1990); Margolin et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n91, 4509-4513 (1994); Pengue et al., \nNucl. Acids Res. \n22:2908-2914 (1994); Witzgall et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n91, 4514-4518 (1994)). In some methods, the zinc finger protein is linked to a transcriptional activator, such as VIP16. Zinc finger proteins can also be used to activate expression of desired genes. Methods for selecting target sites suitable for targeting by zinc finger proteins, and methods for designing zinc finger proteins to bind to selected target sites are described in WO 00/00388. Methods for selecting zinc finger proteins to bind to a target using phage display are described by EP.95908614.1. The target site used for design of a zinc finger protein is typically of the order of 9-19 nucleotides.\n\n\nFor example, proteins have been described that have the ability to translocate desired nucleic acids across a cell membrane. Typically, such proteins have amphiphilic or hydrophobic subsequences that have the ability to act as membrane-translocating carriers. For example, homeodomain proteins have the ability to translocate across cell membranes. The shortest internalizable peptide of a homeodomain protein, Antennapedia, was found to be the third helix of the protein, from amino acid position 43 to 58 (see, e.g., Prochiantz, Current Opinion in Neurobiology 6:629-634 (1996). Another subsequence, the h (hydrophobic) domain of signal peptides, was found to have similar cell membrane translocation characteristics (see, e.g., Lin et al., J. Biol. Chem. 270:14255-14258 (1995)). Such subsequences can be used to translocate oligonucleotides across a cell membrane. Oligonucleotides can be conveniently derivatized with such sequences. For example, a linker can be used to link the oligonucleotides and the translocation sequence. Any suitable linker can be used, e.g., a peptide linker or any other suitable chemical linker.\n\n\nD. Antibodies\n\n\nKinase activity can be reduced by administering anti-kinase (e.g., anti-PLK2) antibodies, both intact and binding fragments thereof, such as Fabs, Fvs, which specifically bind to a kinase of the invention. Usually the antibody is a monoclonal antibody although polyclonal antibodies can also be expressed recombinantly (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,555,310). Examples of antibodies that can be expressed include mouse antibodies, chimeric antibodies, humanized antibodies, veneered antibodies and human antibodies. Chimeric antibodies are antibodies whose light and heavy chain genes have been constructed, typically by genetic engineering, from immunoglobulin gene segments belonging to different species (see, e.g., Boyce et al., \nAnnals of Oncology \n14:520-535 (2003)). For example, the variable (V) segments of the genes from a mouse monoclonal antibody may be joined to human constant (C) segments. A typical chimeric antibody is thus a hybrid protein consisting of the V or antigen-binding domain from a mouse antibody and the C or effector domain from a human antibody. Humanized antibodies have variable region framework residues substantially from a human antibody (termed an acceptor antibody) and complementarity determining regions substantially from a mouse-antibody, (referred to as the donor immunoglobulin). See Queen et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n86:10029-10033 (1989) and WO 90/07861, U.S. Pat. No. 5,693,762, U.S. Pat. No. 5,693,761, U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,089, U.S. Pat. No. 5,530,101 and Winter, U.S. Pat. No. 5,225,539. The constant region(s), if present, are also substantially or entirely from a human immunoglobulin. Antibodies can be obtained by conventional hybridoma approaches, phage display (see, e.g., Dower et al., WO 91/17271 and McCafferty et al., WO 92/01047), use of transgenic mice with human immune systems (Lonberg et al., WO93/12227 (1993)), among other sources. Nucleic acids encoding immunoglobulin chains can be obtained from hybridomas or cell lines producing antibodies, or based on immunoglobulin nucleic acid or amino acid sequences in the published literature.\n\n\nAntibodies can be administered by intravenous injection. A portion of the injected antibodies will cross the blood-brain barrier. Alternatively antibodies can be administered directly to the brain (e.g., by intraventricular or intrathecal injection). Antibodies may be internalized by synuclein-expressing cells by endocytosis. Alternatively, antibodies may be linked to carrier moiety that facilitates transport across the cell membrane.\n\n\nIn one embodiment an intrabody is used to reduce PLK2 activity. The term “intrabody” or “intrabodies” refers to intracellularly expressed antibody constructs, usually single-chain Fv antibodies, directed against a target inside a cell. Nam, et al. (2002) Methods Mol. Biol. 193:301; der Maurr et al. (2002) J. Biol Chem Nov 22; 277(47):45075; Cohen (2002) Methods Mol Biol 178:367. The scFv gene can be transferred into cells, where scFv protein expression can modulate the properties of its target, e.g. PLK2, sometimes extinguishing protein function and causing a phenotypic knockout. Indeed, the scFv intrabody can be expressed in the cytoplasm and directed to any cellular compartment where it can target intracellular proteins and elicit specific biological effects. Intrabodies thus provide effective means for blocking or modulating the activity of proteins such as PLK2.\n\n\nE. Kinase Inhibitors to Modulate Activity\n\n\nIn addition to the biological molecules discussed above, small molecule compounds can be used to modulate (usually inhibit) expression or activity of kinases. As discussed below, known kinase inhibitors can be screened for desired target specificity and other properties, and additional inhibitors can be identified based on target specificity. PLK2 or GRK6 are preferred kinases for inhibition because they are candidates for directly phosphorylating alpha-synuclein. PLK2 is a particularly preferred kinase because it has been shown to phosphorylate alpha-synuclein to a much higher level than GRK6 or other kinases tested herein.\n\n\nOther kinase targets include APEG1, CDC7L1, MET GRK1, GRK2, GRK6, IKBKB, CKII and GRK7 are also preferred kinases for inhibition because they are likely to be indirect activators of the direct kinase(s). PRKG1, MAPK13, and GAK are preferred kinases for activation in Lewy body diseases because they are negative regulators of the phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein. Alternatively, these kinases themselves or fragments or mimetics thereof having similar activity can be used directly as inhibitors of alpha-synuclein phosphorylation. Synphilin can be used as an alternative therapeutic target for inhibition of alpha-synuclein phosphorylation. For example, synphilin can be added to an assay having alpha-synuclein and PLK-2 expression and inhibitors of synphilin identified.\n\n\nCompounds to be screened for capacity to modulate expression or activity of kinases include the modulators of expression described in Section IV. These compounds also include many known examples of kinase inhibitors, some of which are already approved for therapeutic uses or in clinical trials, usually for treatment of cancer. Lead structures include quinazolines, pyrido[d]- and pyrimidol[d]pyrimidines, pyrazolo[d]-pyrimidines, pyrrolo[d]pyrimidines, pheylamino-pyrimidines, 1-oxo-3-aryl-1H-indene-2-carboxylic acid derivatives, and substituted indolin-2-ones and natural products such as strauosporine (see Traxler et al., 2001\n, Medicinal Research Reviews \n21:499-512). Some such compounds are commercially available from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp. (La Jolla, Calif.) including H89, Y27632, AT877 (fasudil hydrochloride), rottlerin, KN62, U0123, PD184352, PD98059, SB203580, SB202190, wortmannin, Li\n+\n, Ro 318220, chelerythrein and 10-[3-(1-piperazinyl)propyl]-2-trifluoromethyl-phenothiazine (see Davies, \nBiochem. J. \n351, 95-105 (2000)). Other compounds currently in clinical trials include STI571 (Glivec™, a phenylamino-pyrimidine derivative) (Novartis), ZD1839 (Iressa) (AstraZeneca), OSI-774 (Roche/OSI), PKI166 (Novartis), CI1033 (Pfizer/Warner-Lambert), EKB-569 (Wyeth-Ayerst), SU5416 (SUGEN), PTK787/ZK224584, aniline-phthalazine derivative (Novartis/Schering AG), SU6668 (Sugen), ZD6474 (AstraZeneca), and CEP2583 (Cephalon). Caveolin-1 is an example of a compound known to modulate the activity of the GRK kinases. Examples of compounds known to modulate the activity of the PLK2/SNK kinases include the RING-H2 domain of hVPS18 (human vacuolar protein sorting 18), and calcium- and integrin-binding protein CIB.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments the therapeutic agent is a small molecule that is a thiazolidone, a quinazoline, a pyrimidine (e.g., a pyrido[d]-pyrimidine, pyrimidol[d]pyrimidine, a pyrazolo[d]-pyrimidine, a pyrrolo[d]pyrimidine, a pheylamino-pyrimidines, or a phenylamino-pyrimidine derivative); an indazole-pyridine derivative, a carboxylic acid derivative (e.g., a 1-oxo-3-aryl-1H-indene-2-carboxylic acid derivative), a substituted indolin-2-one, an aniline-phthalazine derivative; a quinolinone derivative, a benzthiazole-3 oxide compound, an azaindazole compound, or a dihydropteridinone. In certain embodiments the therapeutic agent is a small molecule protein kinase inhibitor described in US 20070203143; US 2007/0179177; US 2007/0135387; US 2007/0010565; US 2007/0037862; US 2007/0010566; US 2006/0074119; US 2006/0079503; US 2006/0223833; US 2005/0014761; US 2004/0176380; US 2006/0040997; U.S. Pat.

Each of the aforelisted publications is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nCompounds may be synthetic or can be obtained from natural sources, such as, e.g., marine microorganisms, algae, plants, and fungi. Other compounds that can be tested include compounds known to interact with alpha-synuclein, such as synphilin. Alternatively, compounds can be from combinatorial libraries of agents, including peptides or small molecules, or from existing repertories of chemical compounds synthesized in industry, e.g., by the chemical, pharmaceutical, environmental, agricultural, marine, cosmeceutical, drug, and biotechnological industries. Combinatorial libraries can be produced for many types of compounds that can be synthesized in a step-by-step fashion. Such compounds include polypeptides, proteins, nucleic acids, beta-turn mimetics, polysaccharides, phospholipids, hormones, prostaglandins, steroids, aromatic compounds, heterocyclic compounds, benzodiazepines, oligomeric N-substituted glycines and oligocarbamates. Large combinatorial libraries of compounds can be constructed by the encoded synthetic libraries (ESL) method described in Affymax WO 95/12608, Affymax WO 93/06121, Columbia University WO 94/08051, Pharmacopeia WO 95/35503 and Scripps WO 95/30642 (each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes). Peptide libraries can also be generated by phage display methods. See, e.g., Devlin, WO 91/18980. Compounds to be screened can also be obtained from governmental or private sources, including, e.g., the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Natural Product Repository, Bethesda, Md., the NCI Open Synthetic Compound Collection, Bethesda, Md., NCI's Developmental Therapeutics Program, or the like. Compounds can include, e.g., pharmaceuticals, therapeutics, environmental, agricultural, or industrial agents, pollutants, cosmeceuticals, drugs, organic compounds, lipids, glucocorticoids, antibiotics, peptides, proteins, sugars, carbohydrates, and chimeric molecules.\n\n\nAs discussed above, kinase inhibitors that preferentially inhibit PLK2 are of particular value. As is shown in Examples 13-16, below, we assayed the effect of several kinase inhibitors levels of phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein in rat ventral mesencephalon and mouse cortical cell cultures, and other cells.\n\n\nAn exemplary compound for use according to the invention is the compound BI2536 having the structure:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs demonstrated in the Examples below, BI 2536 (4-[[(7r)-8-cyclopentyl-7-ethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-2-pteridinyl]amino]-3-methoxy-n-(1-methyl-4-piperidinyl)-benzamide; also called ELN-481574-2;) reduced phosphorylation of alpha synuclein in a variety of cell types. BI 2536 inhibits PLK1, PLK2 and PLK3 (see, Steegmaier et al., 2007\n, Current Biology, \n17:316-322) and does not inhibit PLK4 (Johnson et al., 2007\n, Biochemistry \n46:9551-9563). Steegmaier et al. reported an IC\n50 \nof 0.83 nM for PLK1, 3.5 nM for PLK2 and 9 nM for PLK3. In tests described in Example 15, below, BI2536 was shown to have 16-fold selectivity for PLK2 (\nIC\n \n \n \n50 \n11 nM) and 13-fold selectivity for PLK3 (IC\n50 \n14 nM). BI 2536 has category IV PLK2 specificity (Inhibits PLK2 activity and has no, or reduced, effect on PLK4) and is a candidate for Parkinson's disease therapeutics.\n\n\nAccordingly, in one aspect the invention provides a method for inhibiting phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein in a mammalian cell by contacting the cell with an amount of BI 2536 that reduces PLK2 activity in the cell such that phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein is reduced. In a related aspect, the invention provides a method of treating a patient diagnosed with Parkinson's disease by administering a therapeutically effective amount of BI 2536.\n\n\nU.S. Pat. No. 6,861,422, incorporated herein by reference, describes BI 2536 and structurally related dihydropteridinone kinase inhibitors. Dihydropteridinone compounds that inhibit PLK2 are useful for inhibiting phosphorylation of synuclein.\n\n\nAnother exemplary compound for use according to the invention is the compound ELN-481080 having the structure:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nSee, McInnes et al., 2006\n, Current Topics in Medicinal Chemistry \n5:181-97 (Compound 8). Also see US 2006/0040997, “Benzthiazole-3 oxides useful for the treatment of proliferative disorders” incorporated herein by reference. See Example 14, below.\n\n\n\nSeveral inhibitors of polo-like kinases are described in Johnson et al., 2007, “Pharmacological and functional comparison of the polo-like kinase family: insight into inhibitor and substrate specificity” \nBiochemistry \n46:9551-63. Of those characterized in that study, several preferentially inhibit PLK2 and may be used as therapeutic agents.\n\n\nFor example, CHIR-258 (3) is a multitarget growth factor kinase inhibitor developed for treatment of t(4;14) multiple myeloma (Trudel et al., 2005\n, Blood. \n105:2941-8).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nK\ni \nvalues for CHIR-258 for PLK1, PLK2, PLK3 and PLK4 are >20, 0.85, >20, and 1.4 uM respectively meaning CHR-258 is a Type VI inhibitor (inhibits PLK2 activity and has reduced effect on PLK1, PLK3 and PLK4). Although CHIR-258 is an inhibitor of receptor tyrosine kinases, warranting study of the side effect profile, targeted delivery to the brain and/or particular treatment regimens can be investigated to determine whether the compound has an acceptable therapeutic index for treatment and prevention of Parkinson's Disease, and a clinically acceptable side effect profile.

Methods of Treatment\n\n\nThe invention provides several methods of preventing or treating Lewy Body disease in patients suffering from or at risk of such disease. Therapeutic agents include any of the agents described above that inhibit phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein and/or reduce total levels of alpha-synuclein.\n\n\nThe experimental examples below provide strong evidence that PLK2 is a synuclein kinase. Thus, in a particular aspect, the invention provides a method of effecting treatment or prophylaxis of an LB disease by administering to a patient suffering from or at risk of the disease an effective regime of an agent effective to suppress activity or expression of PLK2. It is preferred that the agent shows a high level of specificity for PLK2.\n\n\nPatients amenable to treatment include individuals at risk of disease of a LBD but not showing symptoms, as well as patients presently showing symptoms. Therefore, the present methods can be administered prophylactically to individuals who have a known genetic risk of a LBD. Such individuals include those having relatives who have experienced this disease, and those whose risk is determined by analysis of genetic or biochemical markers. Genetic markers of risk toward PD include mutations in the alpha-synuclein or Parkin, UCHLI, LRRK2, and CYP2D6 genes; particularly mutations at \npositions\n 30 and 53 of the alpha-synuclein gene. Another genetic marker of risk toward PD includes measuring the levels or SNCA dosage or transcription. Individuals presently suffering from Parkinson's disease can be recognized from its clinical manifestations including resting tremor, muscular rigidity, bradykinesia and postural instability.\n\n\nIn some methods, the patient is free of clinical symptoms or risk factors for any amyloidogenic disease other than one characterized by Lewy bodies. In some methods, the patient is free of clinical symptoms or risk factors of any disease characterized by extracellular amyloid deposits.\n\n\nIn some methods the patient is not diagnosed with cancer and/or Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\nTreatment typically entails multiple dosages over a period of time. Treatment can be monitored by assaying signs or symptoms of the disease being treated relative to base line measurements before initiating treatment. In some methods, administration of an agent results in reduction of intracellular levels of aggregated alpha-synuclein. In some methods, administration of the agent results in a reduction in levels of phosphorylated synuclein. In some methods, administration of an agent results in improvement in a clinical symptom of a LBD, such as motor or cognitive function in the case of Parkinson's disease.\n\n\nIn prophylactic applications, pharmaceutical compositions or medicaments are administered to a patient susceptible to, or otherwise at risk of a LBD in regime comprising an amount and frequency of administration of the composition or medicament sufficient to eliminate or reduce the risk, lessen the severity, or delay the outset of the disease, including physiological, biochemical, histologic and/or behavioral symptoms of the disease, its complications and intermediate pathological phenotypes presenting during development of the disease. In therapeutic applications, compositions or medicates are administered to a patient suspected of, or already suffering from such a disease in a regime comprising an amount and frequency of administration of the composition sufficient to cure, or at least partially arrest, the symptoms of the disease (physiological, biochemical, histologic and/or behavioral), including its complications and intermediate pathological phenotypes in development of the disease. An amount adequate to accomplish therapeutic or prophylactic treatment is defined as a therapeutically- or prophylactically-effective dose. A combination of amount and dosage frequency adequate to accomplish therapeutic or prophylactic treatment is defined as a therapeutically or prophylactically-effective regime.\n\n\nEffective doses of the compositions of the present invention, for the treatment of the above described conditions vary depending upon many different factors, including means of administration, target site, physiological state of the patient, whether the patient is human or an animal, other medications administered, and whether treatment is prophylactic or therapeutic. Usually, the patient is a human but nonhuman mammals including transgenic mammals can also be treated. Treatment dosages need to be titrated to optimize safety and efficacy.\n\n\nThe dosage and frequency of administration can vary depending on whether the treatment is prophylactic or therapeutic. Guidance can be obtained from the dosing schedules of kinase inhibitors currently approved or in clinical trials for other indications. Dosages in the range of 0.1-1000 mg, preferably 10-500 mg, may be used. Frequency of dosing (e.g., daily, weekly or monthly) depends on the half-life of the drug. In prophylactic applications, a relatively low dosage is administered at relatively infrequent intervals over a long period of time. Some patients continue to receive treatment for the rest of their lives. In therapeutic applications, a relatively high dosage at relatively short intervals is sometimes required until progression of the disease is reduced or terminated, and preferably until the patient shows partial or complete amelioration of symptoms of disease. Thereafter, the patent can be administered a prophylactic regime.\n\n\nTherapeutic agents can be administered by parenteral, topical, intravenous, oral, subcutaneous, intraarterial, intracranial, intrathecal, intraperitoneal, intranasal or intramuscular means for prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatment. In some methods, agents are injected directly into a particular tissue where deposits have accumulated, for example intracranial injection. In some methods, agents are administered as a sustained release composition or device, such as a Medipad™ device. Small molecules that pass through the blood brain barrier sufficiently are usually administered orally, but can also be administered intravenously.\n\n\nAgents of the invention can optionally be administered in combination with other agents that are at least partly effective in treatment of LBD. Agents of the invention can also be administered in conjunction with other agents that increase passage of the agents of the invention across the blood-brain barrier.\n\n\nAgents of the invention are often administered as pharmaceutical compositions comprising an active therapeutic agent and a variety of other pharmaceutically acceptable components. See \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Science \n(15th ed., Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., 1980). The preferred form depends on the intended mode of administration and therapeutic application. The compositions can also include, depending on the formulation desired, pharmaceutically-acceptable, non-toxic carriers or diluents, which are defined as vehicles commonly used to formulate pharmaceutical compositions for animal or human administration. The diluent is selected so as not to affect the biological activity of the combination. Examples of such diluents are distilled water, physiological phosphate-buffered saline, Ringer's solutions, dextrose solution, and Hank's solution. In addition, the pharmaceutical composition or formulation may also include other carriers, adjuvants, or nontoxic, nontherapeutic, nonimmunogenic stabilizers and the like.\n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions can also include large, slowly metabolized macromolecules such as proteins, polysaccharides such as chitosan, polylactic acids, polyglycolic acids and copolymers (such as latex functionalized Sepharose™, agarose, cellulose, and the like), polymeric amino acids, amino acid copolymers, and lipid aggregates (such as oil droplets or liposomes).\n\n\nFor parenteral administration, agents of the invention can be administered as injectable dosages of a solution or suspension of the substance in a physiologically acceptable diluent with a pharmaceutical carrier that can be a sterile liquid such as water, oils, saline, glycerol, or ethanol. Additionally, auxiliary substances, such as wetting or emulsifying agents, surfactants, pH buffering substances and the like can be present in compositions. Other components of pharmaceutical compositions are those of petroleum, animal, vegetable, or synthetic origin, for example, peanut oil, soybean oil, and mineral oil. In general, glycols such as propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol are preferred liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions. Antibodies can be administered in the form of a depot injection or implant preparation which can be formulated in such a manner as to permit a sustained release of the active ingredient. An exemplary composition comprises monoclonal antibody at 5 mg/mL, formulated in aqueous buffer consisting of 50 mM L-histidine, 150 mM NaCl, adjusted to pH 6.0 with HCl. Compositions for parenteral administration are typically substantially sterile, substantially isotonic and manufactured under GMP conditions of the FDA or similar body.\n\n\nCompositions may be prepared as injectables, either as liquid solutions or suspensions; solid forms suitable for solution in, or suspension in, liquid vehicles prior to injection can also be prepared. The preparation also can be emulsified or encapsulated in liposomes or micro particles such as polylactide, polyglycolide, or copolymer for enhanced adjuvant effect, as discussed above (see Langer, \nScience \n249, 1527 (1990) and Hanes, \nAdvanced Drug Delivery Reviews \n28, 97-119 (1997). The agents of this invention can be administered in the form of a depot injection or implant preparation which can be formulated in such a manner as to permit a sustained or pulsatile release of the active ingredient.\n\n\nAdditional formulations suitable for other modes of administration include oral, intranasal, and pulmonary formulations, suppositories, and transdermal applications. For suppositories, binders and carriers include, for example, polyalkylene glycols or triglycerides; such suppositories can be formed from mixtures containing the active ingredient in the range of 0.5% to 10%, preferably 1%-2%. Oral formulations include excipients, such as pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharine, cellulose, and magnesium carbonate. These compositions take the form of solutions, suspensions, tablets, pills, capsules, sustained release formulations or powders and contain 10%-95% of active ingredient, preferably 25%-70%.\n\n\nTopical application can result in transdermal or intradermal delivery. Topical administration can be facilitated by co-administration of the agent with cholera toxin or detoxified derivatives or subunits thereof or other similar bacterial toxins (See Glenn et al., \nNature \n391, 851 (1998)). Co-administration can be achieved by using the components as a mixture or as linked molecules obtained by chemical crosslinking or expression as a fusion protein. Alternatively, transdermal delivery can be achieved using a skin patch or using transferosomes (Paul et al., \nEur. J. Immunol. \n25, 3521-24 (1995); Cevc et al., \nBiochem. Biophys. Acta \n1368, 201-15 (1998)).\n\n\nVII. Lewy Body Diseases\n\n\nLewy Body Diseases (LBD) are characterized by degeneration of the dopaminergic system, motor alterations, cognitive impairment, and formation of Lewy bodies (LBs). (McKeith et al., \nClinical and pathological diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies \n(\nDLB\n): \nReport of the CDLB International Workshop, Neurology \n(1996) 47:1113-24). Lewy Bodies are spherical protein deposits found in nerve cells. Their presence in the brain may disrupt the brain's normal function interrupting the action of chemical messengers including acetylcholine and dopamine. Lewy Body diseases include Parkinson's disease (including idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD)), Diffuse Lewy Body Disease (DLBD) also known as Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB), Combined Alzheimer's and Parkinson disease and multiple system atrophy (MSA). DLBD shares symptoms of both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. DLBD differs from Parkinson's disease mainly in the location of Lewy Bodies. In DLBD Lewy Bodies form mainly in the cortex. In Parkinson's disease, they form in selected regions throughout the brain stem, midbrain, and in advanced disease, cerebral cortex. See, Braak et al., 2003, “Staging of brain pathology related to sporadic Parkinson's disease” \nNeurobiology of Aging \n24:197-211. Other Lewy Body diseases include Pure Autonomic Failure, Lewy body dysphagia, Incidental LBD, Inherited LBD (e.g., mutations of the alpha-synuclein gene, PARK3 and PARK4) and Multiple System Atrophy (e.g., Olivopontocerebellar Atrophy, Striatonigral Degeneration and Shy-Drager Syndrome).\n\n\nVIII. Identification of Modulators of Kinases that Directly or Indirectly Phosphorylate Alpha-Synuclein\n\n\nAgents that modulate expression or activity of a kinase that directly or indirectly phosphorylates alpha-synuclein can be identified by a variety of assays. Particularly preferred are agents that inhibit kinases PLK2 or GRK6, or APEG1, CDC7L1, MET GRK1, GRK2, GRK6, IKBKB, CKII and GRK7, or agents that activate PRKG1, MAPK13, and GAK. Agents that modulate expression can be identified in cell-based assays in which an agent under test is introduced into a cell expressing alpha-synuclein and a kinase that directly or indirectly effects phosphorylation of the alpha-synuclein or modulates levels of total alpha-synuclein. Optionally, particularly for PLK2, synphilin can be expressed as well to augment activity of the kinase. The agent can be introduced directly or in the form of a nucleic acid encoding the agent and capable of expressing the agent. The cell can naturally express the alpha-synuclein and kinase or one or both of these can be introduced into the cell by transfection of a suitable nucleic acid. The effect of the agent on expression of the kinase can be measured directly from the level of the kinase or its mRNA, or indirectly by measuring the level of phosphorylated alpha-synuclein or total alpha-synuclein as described above. The level of kinase mRNA can be assayed by a hybridization type assay. The level of the kinase can be assayed by an immunoassay. Optionally, the kinase is tagged with a peptide label such as Flag™ (Hopp et al., \nBioTechnology \n6, 1204-1210 (1988)) to facilitate detection. An agent that decrease the level of the kinase, decrease the level of phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein and/or decrease the level of total alpha-synuclein relative to similar control cells not treated with an agent have a pharmacological activity potentially useful for treatment of Lewy body diseases.\n\n\nAgents are also screened for activity to modulate activity of a kinase suspected of phosphorylating alpha-synuclein or increasing total levels of alpha-synuclein. An initial screen can be performed to select a subset of agents capable of specifically binding to a kinase. Such an assay can be performed in vitro using an isolated kinase or fragment thereof having kinase activity.\n\n\nIn one embodiment an agent that reduces alpha-synuclein phosphorylation in a mammalian cell expressing alpha-synuclein, and which may be used as a therapeutic agent, is identified based on the following criteria: a) reduces activity of PLK2 in a cell expressing PLK2; and b) does not reduce activity of PLK1 in a cell expressing PLK1, or reduces activity of PLK1 at a higher EC\n50 \nthan for PLK2; and/or c) does not reduce activity of PLK3 in a cell expressing PLK3, or reduces activity of PLK3 at a higher EC\n50 \nthan for PLK2; and/or d) does not reduce activity of PLK4 in a cell expressing PLK4, or reduces activity of PLK4 at a higher EC\n50 \nthan for PLK2. In one embodiment an agent is selected that meets all of criteria a-d. The mammalian cell may be a cell overexpressing alpha-synuclein (e.g., transfected with a vectors expressing exogenous, e.g., human, alpha-synuclein). The mammalian cell may be a neuronally-derived cell such as, for example, cells from mouse cortical cell cultures, rat ventral mesencephalon cell cultures, or other neuronal cells from humans or non-human mammals.\n\n\nAgents identified by such a screen can then be assayed functionally. Agents can also be directly assayed functionally without the binding assay. For a kinase that directly phosphorylates alpha-synuclein, modulators can be screened by an in vitro assay combining the kinase, alpha-synuclein, ATP and the modulator in comparison with a control in which the modulator is omitted. Optionally, synphilin can be included as well to increase phosphorylation particularly if the kinase is PLK2. The modulator has potentially useful pharmacological activity if it reduces the level of phosphorylation beyond the margin of typical experimental error relative to the control.\n\n\nAgents can also be screened in cells expressing alpha-synuclein and the kinase under test, and optionally, particularly if the kinase is PLK2, synphilin. Such screens are effective regardless of whether the kinase phosphorylates alpha-synuclein directly or indirectly, or otherwise affects levels of alpha-synuclein. Cells are contacted with the agent and levels of total alpha-synuclein and phosphorylated alpha-synuclein are measured, as above, relative to a control cell not treated with the agent. A reduction in the level of phosphorylated alpha-synuclein or total alpha-synuclein relative to the corresponding level in a control cell not treated with the agent, beyond the margin of typical experimental error, is an indication that the compound has pharmacological activity potential useful in treating Lewy body diseases. Agents may also be screened in cells for ability to reduce aggregation of alpha-synuclein in the cell.\n\n\nAgents can also be screened in transgenic animal models of Lewy body disease, alone or in combination with the other assays described above. Total levels of alpha-synuclein, phosphorylated alpha-synuclein or Lewy-like bodies or other indica of Lewy Body pathology or symptoms are measured in a transgenic animal treated with an agent under test relative to corresponding levels in a similar control animal not treated with the agent. A reduction in one or more of these levels is an indication, the agent has pharmacological activity potentially useful in treating Lewy body diseases.\n\n\nThe kinase used in the above assays and cellular and transgenic models is preferably a human kinase having a sequence in one of the references or accession numbers provided in this disclosure. However, allelic (variants within a species) and species variants (variants between species) of such a kinase can also be used, as can variants having at least 90% sequence identity to such a kinase. For subsequent clinical use, agents identified by such assays are capable of modulating the activity or expression of a natural kinase, preferably a form occurring in humans.\n\n\nIX. Transgenic Animal and Cellular Models of Lewy Body Disease\n\n\nTransgenic animal models are useful for testing the capacity of kinases to effect phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein and formation of Lewy-like bodies as described above. Transgenic animals are also useful for screening agents for activity in modulating phosphorylation or production of alpha-synuclein. Particularly preferred are agents that inhibit or are suspected of inhibiting kinases including PLK2 and GRK6, or APEG1, CDC7L1, MET GRK1, GRK2, GRK6, IKBKB, CKII and GRK7. Also preferred are agents that activate or are suspected of activating kinases PRKG1, MAPK13, and GAK. Further, knockout animals (i.e., animals in which an endogenous kinase is inactivated either by insertional inactivation or trans inhibition by an siRNA, zinc finger protein or the like) are useful for identifying the effect of eliminating activity of a kinase on an animal. For example, analysis of a PLK2-knockout mouse can indicate whether inhibitors of PLK2 have any side effects. Analogous knockouts can reveal similar information for other kinases.\n\n\nIn general, transgenic models have a genome comprising an alpha-synuclein transgene in operable linkage with one or more regulatory sequences to ensure its expression. Expression of the transgene leads to Lewy-body like deposits of alpha-synuclein in the brain of the animal. Several such transgenic animals have been described in the scientific and patent literature (see Masliah et al., \nAm. J. Pathol\n. (1996) 148:201-10 and Feany et al., \nNature \n(2000) 404:394-8)), U.S. Pat. No. 5,811,633 (for transgenic animals with a mutant form of APP). Some transgenic animals express variant or mutant alpha-synuclein, such as familial mutants A30P, A53T, and E46K of alpha synuclein. Some transgenic animals have an additional transgene, such as a transgene encoding a kinase as described above. Transgenic animals bearing a transgene expressing alpha-synuclein protein can also be crossed with other transgenic models of neurogenic disease, such as models of Alzheimer's disease. For example, transgenic animals bearing a transgene expressing a truncated alpha-synuclein protein can be crossed with transgenic animals bearing a transgene expressed APP with a FAD mutation as described by e.g., Games et al., \nNature \n373, 523 (1995) McConlogue et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,612,486, Hsiao et al., \nScience \n274, 99 (1996); Staufenbiel et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n94, 13287-13292 (1997); Sturchler-Pierrat et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n94, 13287-13292 (1997); Borchelt et al., \nNeuron \n19, 939-945 (1997)). The procedure for performing such a cross is described by e.g., Masliah et al., \nPNAS USA \n98:12245-12250 (2001), which reports a cross between transgenic mice expressing a full length alpha-synuclein with PDAPP mice as described by Games et al Transgenic animals of the invention are preferably rodents, such as mice or rats, or insects, such as \nDrosophila\n. Transgenic animals can be produced by introduction of a transgene at the germline stage in which case all or substantially all (except for rare loss through somatic mutation) of the cells of the transgenic animal include the transgene integrated into the genome. Transgenes can be introduced by microinjection, nuclear transfer or viral infection into cells or animals. Adeno Associated Viruses and Lentiviruses are particularly suitable for the latter. Alternatively, transgenes can be introduced by viral infection into the brain of the animal. Such transgenes are not part of the germline of recipient animals but can be targeted to regions of the brain responsible for disease (e.g., the substantia nigra). Such animal models incorporate an alpha-synuclein into the genome of brain cells and are disposed to develop at least one characteristic of LBD disease. Lentiviruses provide a suitable vehicle for so introducing an alpha-synuclein transgene into the brain (see \nBrain Pathology \n13, 364-372 (2003); Bjorklund, \nTrends Neurosci. \n26, 386-92 (2003), Lotharius et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n277, 38884-94 (2002), Zhou et al., \nBrain Research \n866, 33-43 (2000)). Transgenic animals can also include a transgene capable of expressing one of the kinases of the invention (e.g., a nucleic acid encoding the kinase in operable linkage with regulatory elements to ensure its expression in the brain of an animal), instead of or as well as a transgene expressing alpha synuclein. Optionally, a transgene expressing synphilin can be included as well. Some cellular models express variant or mutant alpha-synuclein, such as familial mutants A30P, A53T, and E46K of alpha synuclein. Some cells have an additional transgene, such as a transgene encoding a kinase as described above, e.g., PLK2.\n\n\nCellular models of Lewy body disease can also be used in the screening methods of the invention. Cells transfected with alpha-synuclein form inclusion bodies containing aggregated alpha-synuclein. The transformed cells are preferably neuronal cells, such as GT1-7 neuronal cells (Hsue et al. \nAm. J. Pathol. \n157:401-410 (2000)), PC12 cells or SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. PEAK and/or HCC cells can also be used (see Example 10). The cells are preferably human cells. A vector comprising a segment encoding a form of alpha-synuclein operably linked to one or more regulatory sequences that ensure expression of the expression is transfected into the cells. Cells can also be transfected with a nucleic acid encoding a kinase of the invention as described above. Transfected cells can be used to screen agents for activity in clearing alpha-synuclein inclusions. An exemplary cellular model is identified in Example 10 in which HCC neuronal cells are transfected with synuclein and PLK2 with the result that aggregation and phosphorylation of the synuclein matching LB formation occurs. In order to identify inhibitors of the kinase, the cell is contacted with the inhibitor and a reduction in the amount of phosphorylation and/or aggregation is identified.\n\n\nX. Alpha-Synuclein Isolation and Phosphorylation\n\n\nHuman alpha-synuclein is a polypeptide of 140 amino acids having the following amino acid sequence:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMDVFMKGLSK AKEGVVAAAE KTKQGVAEAA GKTKEGVLYV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGSKTKEGVVH GVATVAEKTK EQVTNVGGAV VTGVTAVAQK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTVEGAGSIAA ATGFVKKDQL GKNEEGAPQE GILEDMPVDP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDNEAYEMPSE EGYQDYEPEA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Ueda et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n(1993) 90:11282-6); GenBank accession number: P37840). The protein has three recognized domains, a KTKE repeat domain covering amino acids 1-61, a NAC (Non-Amyloid Component) domain running from about amino acids 60-95, and a C-terminal acidic domain running from about amino acid 98 to 140.\n\n\nUnless otherwise apparent from the context, reference to alpha-synuclein includes the natural human amino acid sequence indicated above as well as analogs including allelic, species and induced variants (e.g., E83Q, A90V, A76T) having at least 90% sequence identity to natural human alpha-synuclein. Amino acids of analogs are assigned the same numbers as corresponding amino acids in the natural human sequence when the analog and human sequence are maximally aligned. Analogs typically differ from naturally occurring peptides at one, two or a few positions, often by virtue of conservative substitutions. Some natural allelic variants are genetically associated with hereditary LBD. The term “allelic variant” is used to refer to variations between genes of different individuals in the same species and corresponding variations in proteins encoded by the genes. Allelic variants include familial mutants or variants, such as E46K, A30P and A53T (the first letter indicates the amino acid in SEQ ID NO:1, the number is the residue position in SEQ ID NO:1, and the second letter is the amino acid in the allelic variant). Analogs can include any combination of allelic variants. The A53T variation is associated with enhanced levels of phosphorylation at \nposition\n 129 of alpha-synuclein in an individual having the mutation relative to the norm of phosphorylation in undiseased individuals who lack the mutation.\n\n\nAlpha-synuclein, its fragments, and analogs can be synthesized by solid phase peptide synthesis or recombinant expression, or can be obtained from natural sources. Automatic peptide synthesizers are commercially available from numerous suppliers, such as Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif. Recombinant expression can be in bacteria, such as \nE. coli\n, yeast, insect cells or mammalian cells. Procedures for recombinant expression are described by Sambrook et al., \nMolecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual \n(C.S.H.P. Press, NY 2d ed., 1989).\n\n\nA method was developed herein to prepare large amounts of wild-type phospho-S129 alpha-synuclein, mutant and/or familial forms in a bacterial expression system. When recombinant hPLK2 was co-expressed with alpha-synuclein in bacteria, the phospho-S129 alpha-synuclein that was produced in the cell was recovered with a very high yield and purity. This is because, unlike most \nE. coli \nproteins, the alpha-synuclein could resist heating. After boiling of the bacterial lysate, alpha-synuclein purity reached about 95% before chromatography.\n\n\nTo co-express recombinant protein in a bacterial system, the plasmids harboring each gene of interest were chosen be compatible within the bacterial cell by ensuring that they possessed a different origin of replication and a different antibiotic selection. The alpha-synuclein gene was sub-cloned into a pDEST24 compatible vector, pCDF1b. BL21-DE3 bacteria were then co-transformed with both the pDEST24 containing wild-type hPLK2 or hPLK2 constitutive mutant constructs without a GST tag and the pCDF1b/AS plasmid. The bacterial lysates were boiled and the supernatant, expected to contain alpha-synuclein was analyzed by Western blot with an anti-phospho-S129-alpha-synuclein antibody (11A5), by using the SYPRO Ruby™ and ProZDiamond™ dyes (total protein and phospho-Ser/Thr specific dye respectively), by SDS-PAGE and by mass spectrometry, with the results that a fairly pure phospho-S129-alpha-synuclein product was isolated that, upon analysis by mass spectrometry was revealed to be more than 95% phosphorylated. To ensure that the final product was 100% phosphorylated and highly pure, the supernatant of the last centrifugation was passed through an 11A5-sepharose-affinity purification column one or more times. Any contamination was removed using HPLC.\n\n\nXI. Examples\n\n\nEXAMPLE 1\n\n\nScreen for Kinases that Modulate Alpha-Synuclein Phosphorylation\n\n\nTo identify the kinase or kinases that phosphorylates α-synuclein at serine-129 an siRNA kinase library (Ambion) was screened on cells containing a quantifiable amount of phosphorylated α-synuclein. Human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293 cells (PEAK cells) stably transfected with human wild-type α-synuclein under control of a CMV promoter (PEAK-Syn cells) were transfected with 100 nM siRNAs targeting 597 human kinases and were assayed by ELISA assays to quantitate total and phospho-synuclein levels. Ninety-five kinases with siRNAs that altered the percentage of phosphorylated alpha-synuclein were identified (see Tables 1-2). Of those, 28 belonged to the class of kinases that phosphorylate serine residues and hence were capable of directly phosphorylating α-synuclein at serine-129. Others were tyrosine kinases. Although tyrosine kinases do not phosphorylate α-synuclein at ser-129 directly, they can act as upstream regulators of the alpha-synuclein kinase. Two of these ser/thr kinases, casein kinase 2 and calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II, have been reported to phosphorylate α-synuclein in vitro (Pronin et al, \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n275: 26515-26522 (2000), Okochoa et al, \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n275: 390-397 (2000); Nakajo et al, \nEur. J. Biochem. \n217: 1057-1063 (1993) and a casein kinase 2 inhibitor has been reported to decrease phospho-synuclein levels in cells (Okochoa et al, 2000). Several of the GRK family members (although not GRK6) have been reported to phosphorylate alpha-synuclein in vitro (Pronin et al, 2000). GRK2 expression in flies has been reported to increase phospho-synuclein levels (Chen and Feany, \nNature Neurosci. \n8: 657-663 (2005)).\n\n\nIn addition to kinases that lower phospho-synuclein levels, 99 kinases whose siRNAs altered total α-synuclein levels in the PEAK-Syn cells were identified in Table 2 and included fucokinase (FUK), Genbank number NM\n—\n145059; Protein Kinase N1 (PRKCL1, PKN1), Genbank number NM\n—\n002741; Doublecortin and CaM kinase-like 1 (DCAMKL1) NM\n—\n004734; Branched chain Ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase (BCKDK) NM\n—\n005881; Aurora Kinase C (AURKC, STK13); NM\n—\n003160, Kinase suppressor of ras 2 (FLJ25965), NM\n—\n173598; FLJ32704; MAP2K6; and Tousled-like kinase 2 (TLK2) NM\n—\n006842. The mechanism of action may involve either regulation of alpha-synuclein turnover or synthesis (See Table 2).\n\n\nTables 1A, 1B and 1C show kinases whose inhibition modulates the phosphorylation at position ser-129. Table 1A, B, and C differ in the type of kinase. Table 1A shows kinases that can phosphorylate serine residues and often tyrosine and/or threonine as well. Table 1B shows tyrosine kinases that cannot (so far as is known) modify serine residues. Table 1C shows kinases not known to have phosphorylate proteins. Kinases from the upper portion of Table 1A are candidates for direct phosphorylation of ser-129 of alpha-synuclein. Kinases from the upper part of Table 1B are also useful therapeutic targets via roles indirectly phosphorylating alpha-synuclein. Proteins in the upper part of Table 1C are also useful therapeutic targets for the same reason. Cols. 1, 2 and 3 of each table indicate the gene name, kinase name and Genbank accession number of kinases. The next column indicates whether inhibiting expression of the kinase decreased (“down”) or increased (“up”) phosphorylation. The next three columns indicate the number of standard deviations the measured level of phosphorylation departs from the mean in three independent experiments. The final two columns indicate the kinase family (i.e., amino acid specificity) and group.\n\n\nTables 2 and 3 show kinases whose inhibition modulates the overall levels of human alpha-synuclein without changing the percentage of phosphorylation. Table 2 shows all of the kinases with the strongest reduction in levels of human alpha-synuclein. The columns are labeled similarly to Tables 1A, 1B and 1C.\n\n\nTables 1A-C: Complete list of Kinase candidates that reduce phosphorylation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

alpha-synuclein phosphorylation from Example 1 were retested to verify the effect on alpha-synuclein. The confirmation screen was performed using 10 nM siRNA on the targets identified in Example 1 along with several additional kinases of interest. The higher concentration of siRNA in Example 1 was used to ensure that marginal knockdown caused by poorly designed siRNAs could be observed. By using a much lower siRNA concentration in the confirmation screens, the chance of effects due to a general response to the siRNA itself could be much reduced. Some siRNAs that were later reported by Ambion to be ineffective were also re-screened (see replacement library screen below). Finally, some newly identified kinases were screened and those results were added to the pool of results. The kinases that were identified as candidates were tested by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) to confirm that they were actually present in the PEAK-Syn cells (see Example 6). The experimental procedures and results for the confirmation and rescreening were as follows:\n\n\nConfirmation Screen\n\n\nThe results for the confirmation screen were grouped into four categories shown below:\n\n\nCompletely Confirmed: This category included the kinases for which all three siRNAs produced identical phenotypes in the 10 nM screen and in the 100 nM screen.\n\n\nMostly Confirmed: This category included the kinases for which ⅔ of the siRNAs produced identical phenotypes in the 10 nM and in the 100 nM screen, but one third did not; or, alternatively one siRNA result was replicated, but for a second siRNA there was a trend for the same phenotype but with a different siRNA from that used in the original screen.\n\n\nPartly Confirmed: This category included the kinases for which ⅓ of the siRNAs produced the same phenotype in the 10 nM screen and in the 100 nM screen.\n\n\nNot Confirmed: This category included the kinases for which either or both of the following occurred:\n\n \n \n \n \na) None of the three siRNAs had any effect on phosphor-alpha-synuclein levels at 10 nM, and/or\n \nb) The siRNAs produced the opposite phenotype to what was observed in the primary 100 nM screen\n \n \n \n\n\nThe number of kinases that fell into each category was tabulated and the results are shown in Table 3. Seven kinases were completely confirmed, and they are listed in Table 4. Of these seven, only three were identified as possessing the qualities to be good candidates for a kinase that directly phosphorylates alpha-synuclein at ser-129. This is because only three were both ser/thr kinases and decreased phospho alpha-synuclein levels when the kinase levels were reduced by the specific siRNA. These included: APEG1, which is believed to play a role in growth and differentiation of smooth muscle, PLK2 (SNK), which is expressed in brain and is believed to play a role in normal cell division, and CDC7L1, a cell division cycle protein with kinase activity. Of the three, PLK2 was of the most interest due to its role and localization in cells, such as activated neurons. Alpha-synuclein is a synaptic-associated protein thought to be involved in synaptic plasticity and vesicular transport. Thus, PLK2 was identified as a very good candidate for a kinase that directly phosphorylates α-synuclein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE 3\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBreakdown of Candidate Hits From 10 nM Confirmation Screen\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNumber\n \n \n \n \n \nHit Category\n \nof Hits\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCompletely Confirmed\n \n7\n \n \n \n \n \nMostly Confirmed\n \n29\n \n \n \n \n \nPartly Confirmed\n \n22\n \n \n \n \n \nNo Reactivity at 10 nM\n \n19\n \n \n \n \n \nOpposite Reaction to Primary Screen\n \n23\n \n \n \n \n \nTotal Number Of Hits Re-Screened at 10 nM\n \n100\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNOTES:\n \n \n \n \n \nFor all subsequent tables\n \n \n \n \n \n*** denotes where a replacement siRNA has been analyzed and the new data substituted for that from the ineffective siRNA\n \n \n \n \n \n\nKey to shading:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompletely Confirmed Hits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4 shows the seven candidates whose results were completely replicated at 10 nM. Only the first three were identified as having strong potential to be a direct kinase, because they are ser/thr kinases that reduce phospho-synuclein levels when the kinase level is reduced.\n\n\nThere were 29 kinases that fell into the mostly confirmed category, 12 of which were candidates for a direct kinase. These are listed in Table 5. There were 17 additional kinases that were mostly confirmed at 10 nM. Although not likely to be a direct kinase, these could play a role in the regulation of a direct kinase and are listed in Table 6. Twenty-two kinases fell into the partly confirmed category. The ser/thr kinases that decreased phospho alpha-synuclein (i.e. potentially a direct kinase for alpha-synuclein) are listed in Table 8, and the remaining potentially regulatory kinases are listed in Table 8.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPotential Direct Serine/Threonine Kinases that Mostly Confirmed at 10 nM siRNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ser/thr kinases shown in Table 5 were identified as having potential to be a direct kinase that phosphorylates alpha-synuclein because they significantly reduced phospho-synuclein levels when the kinase level was reduced. ⅔ of the siRNAs produced identical results at 10 nM as they did at 100 nM, and as such, were designated as Mostly Confirmed hits.\n\n\nThe kinases in Table 6 were designated as Mostly Confirmed, because ⅔ of the siRNAs produced identical results at 10 nM and 100 nM concentration of siRNA. However, because they did not produce the appropriate phenotype or were the wrong class of kinase (i.e. tyr or non-protein kinase as opposed to a ser/thr kinase), they were identified as not likely to be a direct kinase that phosphorylates ser-129 on alpha-synuclein. Instead, they may be upstream modulators of alpha-synuclein phosphorylation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Kinases That Were Mostly Confirmed at 10 nM sirRNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPotential Direct Serine/Threonine Kinases that Partly Confirmed at 10 nM siRNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ser/thr kinases in Table 7 were identified as having potential to be a direct kinase that phosphorylates alpha-synuclein because they significantly reduced phospho-synuclein levels when the kinase levels were reduced.

However, several had contradictory results and, thus, were designated as having less potential to be direct kinases of alpha-synuclein.\n\n\nForty-two kinases did not have their initial results confirmed at 10 nM. Of these, 19 fell into category (a) listed above, and are listed in Table 9. At 10 nM, none of the three siRNAs at 10 nM produced any change in the phospho-alpha-synuclein phenotype, indicating that the results for these kinases from the 100 nM screen were possibly due to off-target effects. Twenty-three kinases (Table 10) produced the opposite effect on phospho-alpha-synuclein levels at 10 nM than at 100 nM siRNA. There is a possibility that the results at 10 nM were the true effects due to the fact that at 100 nM results are sometimes masked by off-target effects. This can happen at the much higher siRNA concentration. Alternatively, the true effect may have been seen at the higher concentration. In any case, these kinases were designated as less likely to be direct kinases of alpha-synuclein.\n\n\nThe nineteen kinases shown in Table 9 had no significant reactivity at 10 nM compared to controls. Thus, it is possible that the change in phospho-synuclein levels observed at 100 nM was due to off-target effects caused by high concentrations of siRNA. GPRK5 and GPRK7 were not candidates in the original 100 nM screen, but were analyzed at 10 nM siRNA because of additional interest in their role in alpha-synuclein phosphorylation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKinases That Had No Reactivity at 10 nM siRNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results for the kinases in Table 10 were not confirmed at 10 nM because they had the opposite effect on phospho-synuclein levels from that seen at 100 nM. However, it is possible that the results at 10 nM siRNA were the true results, and that the high concentration (100 nM) of siRNA was masking the true effects. It is also possible that the initial effects observed at 100 nM were the true effects. These were designated as likely to be direct kinases of alpha-synuclein and set aside to be tested further at a later date.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE 10\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nKinases Whose Results Were Opposite To The Primary Screen\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nReplacement and Up-Dated Library Screens\n\n\n\nBecause some siRNAs used in the initial screen were later identified as being of poor quality, screens were performed at both concentrations with replacement siRNAs. The data for the replacement siRNAs was used to replace the data for that specific siRNA result from the original screen. Statistical data was tabulated for the three siRNAs for each kinase, and using this, nine additional kinases were identified as candidates from the original screen that were missed in the primary screen. These were retested, and two of the kinases were partially confirmed at 10 nM siRNA. These were BCKDK and FLJ25965 (KSR2).\n\n\nDuring the process, a number of new kinases were identified and siRNAs became available. These were tested as in Example 1 as an AMBION Up-Dates library and new kinase candidates were identified. Many of the newly identified kinases fell under the GO (Gene Ontology Consortium) classification. As such, it was difficult to find detailed information on some of these kinases. Several of the genes included in this category were not true kinases, but were kinase binding proteins or adaptor proteins. At 10 nM siRNA, thirteen kinases were confirmed to be candidates for directly acting on alpha-synuclein. Two of these were likely candidates for being a direct kinase, see Table 11. The remaining eleven were designated as possible indirect regulators of phospho-synuclein levels, see Table 11.

From these results, PLK2, APEG1, CDC7L1, MET, IKBKB, CKII, GRK1, 2, 6 and 7 were identified as kinases that are very likely to phosphorylate alpha-synuclein directly or indirectly. The kinases that were identified as having siRNAs that increased alpha-synuclein phosphorylation (PRKG1, MAPK13, and GAK) could very well be negative regulators of alpha-synuclein phosphorylation.\n\n\nTables 12 and 13: Summary of Confirmation Studies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGRK Results- Mixture of Mostly, Partially and Not Confirmed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the following examples, in vitro kinase assays were performed on a number of the potential targets identified in Examples 1 and 2.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 3\n\n\nIdentification of Direct Phosphorylation of Alpha-Synuclein In Vitro\n\n\nTo determine which of the kinase(s) from the siRNA screen directly phosphorylated alpha-synuclein, purified kinases were incubated with alpha-synuclein in in vitro kinase reactions. These results showed that PLK2, GRK2, 5, 6. and 7 (GPRK2, 5, 6 and 7) were all capable of phosphorylating alpha-synuclein specifically at \nserine\n 129 and did not phosphorylate serine 87 in vitro, showing that they could directly phosphorylate alpha-synuclein. MET, CDC7L1, and IKBKB were shown to be incapable of directly phosphorylating alpha-synuclein (\nFIGS. 1A-C\n).\n\n\nAssay conditions for testing recombinant kinase activities toward recombinant alpha-synuclein at \nserine\n 129 were established and found to be reproducible by immunoblot and ELISA analyses. Commercially available recombinant kinases were used when possible. Those that were not available were produced as indicated by recombinant means.\n\n\nIn \nFIGS. 1A-C\n, recombinant kinases were included in the in vitro alpha-synuclein (AS) assay by standardizing kinase to alpha-synuclein substrate at a constant molar ratio (derived from MW of predicted mature protein) in each reaction (1:200; kinase: recombinant alpha-synuclein kinase—rAS). −control, +kinase; In \nFIG. 1A\n, a probe for total alpha-synuclein (AS) (mAb Syn-1; 0.1 μg/mL) was used indicating equivalent substrate in each reaction; In \nFIG. 1B\n, a parallel blot was probed for 5129 phosphorylation (\nmAb 11A5\n 1 μg/mL). Prominent signals came from GRK6, CKI, CKII and PLK2 (not previously tested by activity normalization). In \nFIG. 1C\n, a parallel blot probed for S87 phosphorylation (pAb, ELADW-110 5 μg/mL). A signal was detected only with CKI phosphorylation.\n\n\nIn \nFIGS. 1D-F\n, a more focused study was performed with recombinant kinases from the GPCR-receptor kinase (GRK) family and PLK2 were included in the in vitro alpha-synuclein (AS) assay by standardizing kinase to AS substrate at a constant molar ratio (derived from MW of predicted mature protein) in each reaction (1:200; kinase: rAS). −control, +kinase; CAM kinases served as negative controls while CKI and II served as positive controls. In \nFIG. 1D\n, a probe for total AS (mAb Syn-1; 0.1 μg/mL) was used indicating equivalent substrate in each reaction; In \nFIG. 1E\n, a parallel blot probed for 5129 phosphorylation (\nmAb\n 11 \nA5\n 1 μg/mL). Prominent signals came from all GRKs except for GRK7. A specificity between GRK members could be seen with signal and can be represented as: CKI>GRK6>PLK2>GRK4>GRK5>GRK2. In \nFIG. 1F\n, a parallel blot probed for S87 phosphorylation (pAb, ELADW-110 5 μg/mL). Signal was detected only with CKI phosphorylation.\n\n\nThe assay conditions are defined in Table 14 and were held constant for all kinases tested. All of the kinases listed were available as tagged/recombinant protein with the exception of CDC7L1, PRKG1 and APEG. Those putative targets were expressed in an in vitro translation system and tested in the in vitro AS assay without protein concentration or activity measurements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssay conditions for in vitro kinase reactions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nCon-\n\n\n \n\n\n1:200 kinase:AS\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nfir-\n\n\n \n\n\n(molarity)\n\n\ntotal ul\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nma-\n\n\n \n\n\nng kinase;

1 \nmM EDTA MgCl\n 10 mM pH 8.0, 0.1% BME; 0.01% Brij-35; 5 ug BSA, 100 uM ATP (5×[substrate]), 100 uL volume; 300 ng r-wt-AS (208 nM), (1:200 kinase: AS or activity normalized 0.03 U/rxn, 34 C; 17 hrs. Further, those kinases with varying levels of significance/confirmation from combined screening data were purchased as recombinant, tagged protein, annotated and incorporated into a table format for the purposes of establishing in vitro assays that were comparable based upon normalization to activity units (determined by the manufacturer from synthetic substrates) or substrate:enzyme molar ratios determined from MW and reaction volume. The details of reaction conditions are stipulated in Table 14. Kin.=kinase. For Confirmation: Most=mostly, Part=partially, del=deleted, conf=confirmed.\n\n\nKinase activity was initially tested against AS by activity units as determined from non-native substrates (peptides or casein). This method was used to get a rough estimate as to specificity between kinases and whether AS was an in vitro substrate for the kinase panel. The results of this study are found in \nFIGS. 2 and 3\n. At the time of this experiment, only a portion of available kinases were obtained and ⅔ kinases from the “most probable 7 confirmed” were included (PLK2 was not tested). The most prominent result came from GRK6 (G-protein coupled receptor kinase 6). CKI gave a modest signal and CKII was not detectable. Because both CK kinases are known to phosphorylate 5129 AS, normalization by activity units was biased against those kinases which had higher specific activity for tested substrates vs AS. This was likely the situation for GRK6 which might have preferred AS as a substrate rather than the peptide substrate which defined its activity units.\n\n\nIn the following examples, in vitro kinase assays were performed on a number of the potential targets identified in Examples 1 and 2. To correct for the activity bias, kinases were retested and newly procured kinases were put into an assay that normalized for molarity. This gave a better measurement of stoichiometric ratios between enzyme and substrate, thus reporting the phosphorylation event as a function of AS/kinase interaction. This was in contrast to the event in which unrelated substrate/kinase phosphorylation was measured. \nFIGS. 3A-C\n illustrate a more realistic view of AS phosphorylation with roughly equivalent levels of phospho ser-129 between CKI, GRK6 and PLK2 (one of 7 highly confirmed). With the exception of CKI, none of the tested kinases were capable of phosphorylating AS at the ser-87 residue. This observation confirmed the specificity/preference of these kinases for the ser-129 site and/or the low preference/inaccessibility for the ser-87 site. However, CKI has been reported to phosphorylate at both sites.\n\n\nEffect of Acidic Phospholipid on the Assay Results\n\n\nThe significant levels of activity by GRK6 and PLK2 (polo-like kinase phylogenetically related to the GRK family) in the in vitro assay combined with the identification of PLK2, GRK2 and GRK1 as decreasers of phosphorylation in the RNAi screen, prompted a more comprehensive survey of other GRK members. \nFIGS. 4A\n and B indicate the results of \nGRK\n 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 and PLK2 compared in the in vitro assay. This preference could be represented as CKI>GRK6>PLK2>GRK4>GRK5>GRK2. GRK 7 was not able to phosphorylate at appreciable levels. All GRKs were unable to phosphorylate at ser-87 pointing to a specificity for the acidic sequence flanking \namino acid\n 129. These reactions were quantitated and confirmed by ELISA measurements. These values more or less agreed with the immunoblot data with an apparent decrease in PLK2 level vs GRKs. It is likely that most of the AS substrate was depleted (phosphorylated) based on the assay design (300 ng AS, 210 nM for 17 hr).\n\n\nThe positive effect of acidic phospholipids on the phosphorylation of AS has been previously reported Pronin et. al. JBC 275(34): 26515-26522 (2000) and a pronounced effect on \nGRK\n 2 and 5 was observed. Because of this report and the many studies indicating that acidic phospholipids modulate AS conformation, a mixture of phosphatidylcholine (PC): phosphatidylserine (PS): phosphatidyl-inositol-phosphate-3 (PIP3) was generated and incorporated into the established in vitro assay. The lipid mixture was shown to increase signal for almost all of the kinases tested. The addition of a lipid environment is likely to imitate the membrane surface in a cell where AS and GRKs are likely to associate. Without being bound by the following theory, it is probably due to a favorable exposure of the C-term of AS upon lipid binding of the N-term helices of AS. Interestingly, the lipid effect of ser-87 phosphorylation (as see by the CKI reaction) led to a decrease in the level of phosphorylation. This may be the result of epitope masking by lipid interaction if ser-87 is buried upon helix interaction.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 4\n\n\nIdentification of Direct Phosphorylation of Alpha-Synuclein in Cell Lines\n\n\nBecause kinases can be more promiscuous in vitro than they are in cells, an assay was performed in cell lines to confirm the direct interaction with alpha-synuclein. cDNAs for the kinases that phosphorylated alpha-synuclein in vitro from Example 3 were transfected into the PEAK-Syn cell line to see which was capable of phosphorylating alpha-synuclein ser-129 in cells. The results showed that GRK6 and, to an even greater extent, PLK2 were able to mediate alpha-synuclein phosphorylation in cells (\nFIG. 6\n).\n\n\ncDNA clones for PLK2, GPRK6, APEG1, CDC7 and PRKG1 were obtained from Origene. The cDNA was transcribed and transfected into PEAK-Syn cells using Lipofectamine 2000™ (Invitrogen). For each cDNA analyzed, 12 wells of a 96-well plate were transfected, along with 12 control wells of untransfected cells. Cells were harvested at 48 hrs post-transfection as per the ELISA screening protocol, and analyzed by ELISA for total and phospho-synuclein, and values were normalized for total protein. For those kinase targets not commercially available as recombinant proteins (namely APEG, PRKGI and CDC7LI), an in vitro cell-free reticulocyte system (Promega) was employed to express protein from human full-length cDNA clones (Origene). Proper sequence was determined and DNA prepared. PLK2 and GRK6 cDNA was also included in the study as positive controls.\n\n\nThe percentage of phospho-synuclein in untransfected cells was calculated to be 7.8%. The percentage of phospho-synuclein for the cells transfected with APEG1, CDC7 and PRKG1 cDNA was only marginally higher than untransfected cells at 8.9%. These kinases were considered to have produced a negative result in altering phospho-synuclein levels, and were considered negative controls for experimental purposes, as they were subjected to the same rigors of transfection that the other kinases were exposed to cDNA to PLK2 was transfected into 293-synuclein cells. Cells were harvested 48 hrs following transfection and analyzed by ELISA for total and phospho-synuclein levels. ELISA values were corrected for total protein levels. Overexpression of PLK2 resulted in a dramatic increase in phospho-synuclein levels, increasing phospho-synuclein expression by 4.3-fold above expression in untransfected cells.\n\n\nIt is likely that when a direct kinase that phosphorylates α-synuclein is introduced into the cell an increase in phospho-synuclein levels would be observed. This was the case for both GPRK6 and PLK2 (\nFIG. 6\n). The percent phospho-synuclein in cells transfected with GPRK6 cDNA increased dramatically, from 8.9% to 18.9%. This increase is significant to 9.25 standard deviations above the percent phospho-synuclein observed for the negative kinases. The increase in phospho-synuclein levels for the PLK2-transfected cells was even more dramatic, increasing the percent phospho-synuclein almost four-fold to 33.2%. This represents an extremely significant change, an increase of 22.75 standard deviations above the phospho-synuclein levels observed for the negative kinases. This dramatic increase was by far the largest change observed previously in using this assay. This data strongly indicates GPRK6, and especially PLK2 as very solid contenders as direct kinases responsible for phosphorylating α-synuclein. Thus, as shown in \nFIG. 6\n, when GPRK6 cDNA is transfected into HEK-synuclein cells, the expression of phospho-synuclein increases 2-fold. Introduction of PLK2 cDNA into cells results in an even more dramatic increase in phospho-synuclein expression, a change of almost four-fold above control values.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 5\n\n\nPhosphorylation by PLK2 (SNK) GRK6, CKII and IKBKB\n\n\nThe data in Example 4 was further substantiated for PLK2 by showing that PLK2 siRNAs reduced alpha-synuclein phosphorylation. This strengthened the data showing that PLK2 is a likely candidate as a cellular kinase that directly phosphorylates alpha-synuclein at Serine 129 (Tables 2 and 12).\n\n\nHEK 293 cells stably transfected with alpha-synuclein were transfected with 10 nM and 100 nM of SmartPool siRNAs (Dharmacon). SmartPool siRNAs include 4 individual siRNAs to a specific target. Thus, the actual concentration of each of the four siRNAs transfected into cells was 2.5 nM and 25 nM respectively. The results in \nFIG. 7\n show that PLK2 significantly decreased phospho-synuclein levels, a change of approximately 25%. At 10 nM, but not at 100 nM of siRNA, GPRK6 significantly increased the percentage of phospho-synuclein by one standard deviation above the mean of the control negative kinases (\nFIG. 7\n). This is the opposite effect to what was previously observed in the primary siRNA screen and may be due to the quality of the siRNA used in the first or second assays. These results were confirmed by immunohistochemistry.\n\n\nThe significant knockdown of phospho-synuclein levels by different siRNAs from a different source, independently confirms and solidifies the data, and substantiates the role of PLK2 as a direct kinase that phosphorylates α-synuclein. These experiments were then performed on two other kinases identified in the screens to be of interest, casein kinase two (CKII) and IKBKB.\n\n\nThe individual CKII catalytic subunits were hits in the primary siRNA screen (see Example 1 and Table 1B) and confirmed at the 10 mM siRNA screen. It was of interest to determine if the individual CKII subunits α\n1 \nand α′, when cotransfected with PLK2 or each other, had additive effects on alpha-synuclein phosphorylation. Transfections were performed using the individual CKII subunits A (α\n1\n) and B (α′), cotransfected with PLK2 or each other. Overexpression of these catalytic subunits increased phospho-synuclein levels by 1.75 and 1 standard deviations respectively (the effect was not additive). When each of the individual subunits was co-transfected with PLK2, the levels of phospho-synuclein increased over that of PLK2 alone (18.6% phospho-synuclein) by 1.25 standard deviations each to 22.8% phospho-synuclein. However when both subunits were co-transfected with PLK2 phospho-synuclein levels were not significantly increased above that for PLK2 alone (21.4% phospho-synuclein).\n\n\nIKBKB siRNA knockdown resulted in a significant decrease in alpha-synuclein phosphorylation so this gene was tested for capacity to phosphorylate alpha synuclein. Transfections and ELISA analysis were performed as per standard procedure. Previous in vitro experiments demonstrated that IKBKB was not a direct synuclein kinase as it did not phosphorylate synuclein in a direct kinase assay (see Example 3), but may be an upstream regulator of synuclein phosphorylation. Thus, IKBKB was over-expressed in HEK-syn cells to identify the effect on phosphorylation of synuclein. Following introduction of IKBKB cDNA into cells, synuclein phosphorylation increased from 8.3% in the negative (empty vector) control to 21.5%, a 2.6-fold increase. This represented an increase in synuclein phosphorylation that was significant to almost 53 standard deviations. The PLK2 positive control increased synuclein phosphorylation to 65.8%, an almost 8-fold increase in phosphorylation (significant to 230 standard deviations). Although the effect on synuclein phosphorylation was much more modest for IKBKA, a related kinase, (1.2 fold) than for IKBKB, it was still significant to 1.4 standard deviations.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 6\n\n\nSynphilin as an Alternative Therapeutic Target\n\n\nSynphilin is a synuclein-associated protein that has been shown to bind alpha-synuclein. To determine if the presence of synphilin can enhance the phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein, it was over-expressed in HEK cells with and without alpha-synuclein and PLK2. Transfections were performed according to standard protocol, followed by alpha-synuclein ELISA and analysis. Cells were also harvested for Western blot analysis. Transfected cell lysates were analyzed for total synuclein using 1H7 antibody and phospho-\nserine\n 129 synuclein using 11A5 antibody (See WO 05047860). The total amount of DNA transfected into cells remained constant at 0.16 μg/well of a 96-well plate. The type of DNA introduced into cells varied, with empty vector being used to make up the full quota of DNA. Varying concentrations of alpha-synuclein, PLK2, and synphilin cDNA were introduced into naïve HEK cells. Cells transfected with all three showed a slight increase in total synuclein. For phospho-synuclein, the levels in untransfected cells were below the limit of quantitation. Introducing alpha-synuclein alone yielded 5.2% phospho-synuclein, which was marginally less than co-transfection of synuclein with synphilin (5.4% phospho-synuclein). Co-transfection of PLK2 and synuclein yielded levels similar those observed for transfecting PLK2 into HEK-syn stable cells, 60% phospho-synuclein. Strikingly, concurrent over-expression of all three cDNA's (PLK2, synuclein and synphilin) resulted in 83.3% phospho-synuclein in the HEK cells. Thus, synphilin increased synuclein phosphorylation in PLK2, alpha-synuclein over-expressed HEK cells.\n\n\nIncreased phosphorylation of alpha synuclein in the presence of synphilin can be explained by synphilin binding to the PLK2 polo-box thereby facilitating phosphorylation of synuclein by PLK2. Synuclein itself is unlikely to bind the polo-box domain.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 7\n\n\nPLK2 Activity: Phosphorylation of Alpha Synuclein and Familial Mutants of Alpha Synuclein\n\n\nTo analyze PLK2 phosphorylation of a number of known familial mutants of alpha synuclein, in vitro studies were performed and the phosphorylation of the alpha synuclein and mutants analyzed. The familial mutants (FPD) were A30P, A53T, and E46K.\n\n\nAll in vitro reactions were performed using the following conditions, 10 mM MgCl2, 100 μM ATP, 27 mM HEPES, 250 ng/ml PLK2, 1/50 dilution of Protease Inhibitor solution (1 tablet in 1 ml of reaction buffer), 40 mM Nitrophenylphosphate, 1 mg/ml of 95% Type II-S Phosphatidylcholine from soybean, and 10, 100, or 1000 nM alpha synuclein (AS). The reaction was incubated at 37° C. The activity was analyzed by autoradiography.\n\n\nPLK2 was found to be more active against wild-type alpha synuclein than beta synuclein. Further, the mutant alpha-synucleins were phosphorylated more at a given concentration (especially at lower concentrations) than WT. A trend of PLK2 activity was identified with PLK2 activity being highest with FPD mutants, followed by wild-type alpha synuclein, and minimally against beta synuclein. This order is consistent with a mechanism by which phosphorylation of alpha synuclein drives Lewy body formation and subsequent pathology.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 8\n\n\nConfirmation of the Presence of Kinases in HEK-Synuclein and SY5Y-Synuclein Cells\n\n\nqRT-PCR was performed to determine if the kinases of interest were expressed in HEK-synuclein and SY5Y-synuclein cells. In Table 15 all samples were normalized to GAPDH expression. In addition, two of the negative kinases were analyzed in each experiment as a reference. Of the 24 potential direct kinase candidates tested, 20 were detected in the HEK293-synuclein cells, including PLK2. Thus, the remaining completely confirmed kinases were detected in the cells (\nFIG. 9\n). Four of the potential direct kinases tested, GPRK1, GPRK7, ERK8 and RIPK3, were not detected. GPRK6 was barely detectable.\n\n\nThe qRT-PCR was performed as follows: the mRNA levels were normalized to GAPDH mRNA expression levels. Total RNA was purified from a cell pellet using the QIAGEN RNeasy Kit and protocol. Primer-probe sets for 24 of the potential direct kinases and the four indirect completely confirmed kinases were ordered from Applied Biosystems (TaqMan Gene Expression Assays), along with reverse transcriptase, RNase inhibitors and standard PCR reagents. A one-step RT-PCR/qRT-PCR reaction as performed an ABI7500 Real-Time PCR machine for each primer-probe set using 20 ng or 200 ng total RNA using the following cycling conditions: 48° C./30 mins (RT-PCR step), 95° C./10 mins (denature), then 40 cycles of 95° C./15 secs, 60° C./1 min. For each primer-probe set, an RT-negative reaction and PCR-negative reaction was performed. The RT-negative controls for background amplification of DNA (not RNA) that is contaminating the purified RNA. The PCR-negative control was to ensure all of the PCR reagents were free of contaminating RNA and DNA, and should have had no signal.\n\n\nAll three of the completely confirmed potential direct kinases, along with the four indirect completely confirmed kinases were easily detected in SY5Y-synuclein cells, indicating this cell line may be a viable option for a neuronally-derived cell line for further experimental analysis of kinases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nqRT-PCR demonstration of the presence of kinases\n\n\n\n\n\n\nin HEK-synuclein and SY5Y-synuclein cells\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSample Name\n\n\nRelative Expression (to GAPDH)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSYN APEG1\n\n\n2.23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSYN SNK/PLK2\n\n\n3.57\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSYN CDC7L1\n\n\n1758.34\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSYN PRKG1\n\n\n7.36\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSYN MAPK13\n\n\n8.97\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSYN GAK\n\n\n2.17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSYN MET\n\n\n891.44\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSY5Y-SYN APEG1\n\n\n1698.45\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSY5Y-SYN\n\n\n208.66\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSNK/PLK2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSY5Y-SYN CDC7L1\n\n\n24.42\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSY5Y-SYN PRKG1\n\n\n42.22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSY5Y-SYN MAPK13\n\n\n45.73\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSY5Y-SYN GAK\n\n\n17.63\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSY5Y-SYN MET\n\n\n86.22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 9\n\n\nIdentification of Increased Phosphorylation of Alpha-Synuclein in 293 Cells and Neuronally-Derived Cell Lines\n\n\nPLK2 and GRK were overexpressed in 293 cells stably transfected with alpha synuclein. ELISA and Western blot were performed to identify increase in phospho-synuclein with PLK and GRK kinases and an increase in phosphorylation was demonstrated. A second method was used to confirm the increase using the same biotinylated antibodies used in the ELISA for immunostaining (11A5) in 293 cells. This method also demonstrated an increase in phospho-synuclein in cells transfected with PLK2 and to a lesser extent GRK. The increase was detected in a small population of cells that brightly stain for 11A5, not a general increase in all cells. The amount of total synuclein (measured using the 5C12 antibody) did not appear to change. This was a significant increase in phosphorylation in the 293 cells. Thus, it was of interest to see if the results could be repeated in neuroblastoma cells.\n\n\nTo identify that the dramatic upregulation of phospho-synuclein observed with PLK2 and GPRK6 occurs in neuronally-derived cells, the same experiment was performed in human neuroblastoma cells (SY5Y cells). Immunostaining results showed that PLK2 caused an increase in the phospho-synuclein in a small population of cells, in a very similar pattern to the 293 cell experiments. Quantitation was performed by immunohistochemistry using the ArrayScan™ in two ways. First all cells were counted and did not show any difference. Then just the bright cells were counted and this analysis showed about a 5-10 fold increase in the number of 11A5 positive cells that were PLK transfected, with a slight increase with GRK6 as well.\n\n\nThe cDNA transfection experiment is repeated in HCC cells and immunohistochemistry is performed with a variety of alpha-synuclein antibodies on the cells that have been transfected with PLK2 and GPRK6. Cells may be treated with additional reagents to mimic the pathology of Parkinson's disease; such reagents could include, for example, rotenone, paraquat, hydrogen peroxide, or ferric chloride. In this way, inclusion formation and/or alpha-synuclein aggregation is observed in these cells. Antibodies used to look for inclusions/aggregation include LB509, SYN-1, 11A5 and ELADW-110.\n\n\nNext, cDNA for PLK2 and GPRK6 siRNA is transfected in primary neuronal cultures in preparation for introducing targets into a mouse model. The method is performed as in Example 4. qRT-PCR is performed (as in Example 2) using SY5Y-synuclein RNA. SY5Y-synuclein cells are derived from neuroblastoma cells and have been stably transfected with a WT-synuclein vector.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 10\n\n\nDistribution of Lentivirus-Expressed Alpha-Synuclein in Human Cortical Culture (HCC)—a Cellular Model for Lewy Body Disease\n\n\nOf interest was the identification of a cellular model for Lewy body disease and/or for PD pathology. Thus, lentivirus-mediated expression of alpha-synuclein in human cortical cultures was used to establish a model of alpha-synuclein deposition in vivo. Experiments were performed on donors, and HCC cells overexpressing wild-type and variant alpha-synuclein to fractionate the cells and localize wild-type alpha-synuclein and variant alpha-synuclein within the cells. In one experiment aggregation of alpha synuclein in a manner matching LB disease was observed in the HCC cells. Further, in one experiment when PLK2 was expressed, the phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein as well as the aggregation increased. In other experiments this was not observed.\n\n\nFurther experiments were performed to determine whether extending culture might increase the accumulation of overexpressed synuclein, and would stress the cells, which also might favor synuclein deposition or toxicity. Accordingly, HCC were transduced with viral vectors expressing WT, A53T, S129A or both A53T/S129A alpha-synuclein mutants. Following transfection cells were grown in vitro for 9, 16 or 23 days before collecting and fractionating. ELISA results were normalized to protein concentration and showed an accumulation of synuclein in the soluble fraction with increasing time. Somewhat greater accumulation was observed with the S129A mutant.\n\n\nWhen further experiments were performed with WT, 119-truncated, and E46K AS, the results were as follows. The higher the expression of wild-type the larger the portion of alpha synuclein recovered in the soluble fraction. E46K synuclein showed a 50-100% increase in the amount of phosphorylated alpha-synuclein. However, the E46K mutation did not markedly affect relative amounts of synuclein recovered in the membrane-bound or insoluble fractions. Expression of 119-truncated alpha synuclein led to a slight increase in the relative amount accumulating in the insoluble fraction (about 3 fold higher relative to WT). The increase is expected in view of the published results suggesting that truncated synuclein forms fibrils much more readily in vitro than does full-length (Murray et al. 2003 \nBiochemistry \n42:8530). The 119 truncation resulted in an increased association with membranes consistent with the N-terminal domain being responsible for association with lipid bilayers. The increased association with membranes may mitigate the increased tendency of the soluble protein to aggregate. The response of the insoluble fraction to increases in levels of soluble synuclein on overexpression and to truncation, a change favoring aggregation, suggest that it provides a way to identify factors affecting aggregation in the intraneuronal milieu.\n\n\nThe increased alpha-synuclein in the soluble compartment might be shifting the alpha-synuclein to a potentially more vulnerable compartment, leading to changes which could result in increased deposition. Since the kinases proposed to phosphorylate alpha-synuclein at Ser129 are soluble, it seems likely that the soluble alpha-synuclein is more accessible to phosphorylation as well.\n\n\nAdditional experiments are performed to identify inhibitors of the phosphorylation and/or aggregation in this cellular model by expressing the inhibitors in the cells and identifying a reduction in the phosphorylation and/or aggregation.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 11\n\n\nAnalysis of Endogenous Kinase Activity in Alpha-Synuclein Knock-Out Mice\n\n\nThe utilization of an alpha-synuclein knockout (alpha-synuclein KO) mouse brain for the identification of a putative alpha-synuclein kinase has the advantage over the siRNA screen in the following ways: 1) the use of brain material provides relevant and possibly higher levels of brain-specific kinase activity which the HEK cell line may not provide; 2) cofactors may be present in brain (lipid, protein, etc.) which may not be present in cells and 3) absence of any endogenous alpha-synuclein which could be detected as a phosphorylated AS. The inclusion of 25-50 μg of extracts (soluble and detergent soluble) with recombinant alpha-synuclein (rAS) was assessed with 250 μM ATP to determine if appreciable kinase activity was present in crude material. \nFIG. 8A\n shows total alpha-synuclein in each reaction indicating equivalent loadings of rAS. In \nFIG. 8B\n, the levels of phospho-ser-129 alpha-synuclein were investigated. The rAS in both TBS (sucrose soluble) and TX (Triton-S 100 soluble) extracts was phosphorylated, with roughly twice the level of signal from the TBS material than the TX (although reactions were not normalized for protein). Phosphorylation levels were increased by addition of CKI but were not significantly affected by the addition of phospholipids from soybean. An identical blot was probed for ser-87 phosphorylation in \nFIG. 9B\n. This pAb presents cross-reactivity with rAS at 100 ng, thus levels above background indicate true phosphorylation at the ser-87 site. In both TBS and TX reactions there is no significant phosphorylation at this site whereas the CKI spike achieved phosphorylation at appreciable levels. These experiments suggest that measurable and real kinase activit(ies) are present in the soluble and membrane fractions of KO mouse brain and are specific to the ser-129 site compared to ser-87. The potential exists for phosphorylation at other serine or threonine sites in alpha-synuclein but antibodies are not yet available to detect such modifications. Thus, measurable levels of ser-129 specific kinase activity/activities are present in alpha-synuclein KO mouse brain extracts and could serve as starting material for purification of a kinase from the brain.\n\n\nIn \nFIGS. 8A\n, \n8\nB, \n9\nA and \n9\nB, cortices of alpha-synuclein KO mouse brain were Dounce homogenized to obtain 200 mM sucrose soluble and 0.1% Triton X-100 soluble extracts with protease and phosphatase inhibitors present. 20 μl of sample (100 μl total volume of reaction) was incubated with 2.4 μg of wt-rAS in the presence or absence of 1000 units of casein kinase I(CKI) as a positive control, and/or 200 μg of phosphatidycholine (PC; soybean lecithin) to increase kinase activiti(es). Reactions were loaded on SDS-PAGE (130 ng total AS) and immunoblotted with Syn-1 (total Syn; 0.1 ug/ml), 11A5 (phospho ser-129; 1 μg/ml) or ELADW110 (phospho ser-87; 2 μg/mL).\n\n\nThe above data shows that PLK2 other direct and/or indirect kinases (such as GRK6), and modulators such as synphilin are novel targets for therapeutic intervention in DLB and PD. PLK2 is a preferred target because it can directly phosphorylate alpha-synuclein specifically at ser-129.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 12\n\n\nEffect of Overexpression of PLK Family Members on Synuclein Phosphorylation\n\n\nOverexpression of PLK family members PLK1, 2 and 3, but not PLK4, increased synuclein phosphorylation above the level of the endogenous kinase in HEK-293 cells.\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nHEK-293 naïve cells were transfected with an expression vector encoding PLK1, PLK2, PLK3, or PLK4 under the control of a CMV promoter, or empty vector, together with an expression vector encoding WT-synuclein. All vectors had the sequence coding for the protein of interest. Transfection was accomplished using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) with 0.08 μg vector. Cells were washed and harvested 48 hours post-transfection. A Micro BCA (Pierce) total protein assay and total synuclein and phospho-synuclein ELISAs were performed on each plate of treated cells.\n\n\nResults\n\n\nResults are summarized in Table 16.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE 16\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nProportion of total\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsynuclein that\n \n \n \n \n \nis phoshorylated\n \nFold Change in Percent\n \n \n \nEndogenous Kinase\n \nat ser-129 2.0%\n \nSynuclein Phosphorylation\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEndogenous Kinase +\n \n1.6%\n \n0.8\n \n \n \nsynphilin\n \n \n \nOver-Expressed PLK1\n \n4.1%\n \n2.1\n \n \n \nOver-Expressed PLK2\n \n42.3%\n \n21.2\n \n \n \nOver-Expressed PLK3\n \n79.2%\n \n39.6\n \n \n \nOver-Expressed PLK4\n \n1.9%\n \n1.0\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nPLK2\n\n\n\nOver-expression of PLK2 in the 293 cells yielded similar results to those observed in previous experiments, resulting in a 21-fold increase in synuclein phosphorylation, from 2% to 42.3%.\n\n\nPLK3\n\n\nThe over-expression of PLK3 generated an even more striking 39-fold increase in synuclein phosphorylation, from 2% to 79.2% phospho-synuclein. However, knockdown of PLK3 does not decrease the percentage of phosphorylated synuclein in the 293 cells (see Example 13, infra). PLK3 is structurally most similar to PLK2 of all the PLK family members, so even if PLK3 is not the synuclein kinase, it may be able to perform the same physiological tasks as PLK2. It has been proposed that in the absence of PLK2 expression, PLK3 can functionally compensate for the absent PLK2 (Smith et al., 2006, “Epigenetic inactivation implies a tumor suppressor function in hematologic malignancies for Polo-like kinase 2 but not Polo-like kinase 3.Cell Cycle.” \nCell Cycle \n5:1262-4). In addition, over-expression experiments can yield off-target and non-physiological effects and results should be substantiated through additional experimentation such as siRNA knockdown or in vitro transcription/translation experiments.\n\n\nPLK1\n\n\nOver-expression of PLK1 resulted in a two-fold increase in the percent of synuclein phosphorylation (from 2% to 4.1%). While not as robust an increase in synuclein phosphorylation as the 21-fold increase with PLK2 or 39-fold increase with PLK3 over-expression, it is still significant. However, as noted above, overexpression of proteins can yield results that do not accurately represent the physiological state within cells and tissues. Over-expression of genes can produce off-target effects and can result in erroneous localizations within cells that do not characterize the true physiological state, and results of over-expression experiments should be substantiated with additional experimentation such as siRNA knockdown or in vitro transcription/translation experiments.\n\n\nPLK4\n\n\nOver-expression of PLK4 did not change the percentage of synuclein phosphorylation in 293 cells. The structure of PLK4 is much different from those of the other PLKs, and has only a single polo box domain rather than the two that the other three family members have. The results do not exclude the possibility that in other tissue types, PLK4 may be able to phosphorylate synuclein.\n\n\nIn Vitro Biochemical Assays\n\n\nIn vitro biochemical assays using each of the four PLK family members as the kinase to phosphorylate synuclein were conducted. The results (not shown) mirror the cell-based ovewrexpression assays described above, with PLK1 being able to phosphorylate synuclein moderately, PLK2 and PLK3 having extremely robust phosphorylation of synuclein, and PLK4 exhibiting no ability to phosphorylate synuclein.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 13\n\n\nsiRNA Knockdown of PLK Family Members\n\n\nHEK-293 naïve cells were transfected with 40 nM, 100 nM and 200 nM of Dharmacon On Target Plus Smart Pool siRNAs (Darmacon, Lafayette, Colo.) designed to knock down the expression of each of the four PLK family members. The transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen Carlsbad, Calif.). Cells were washed and harvested 48 hours post-transfection. A Micro BCA (Pierce) total protein assay and total synuclein and phospho-synuclein ELISAs were performed on each plate of treated cells.\n\n\nPLK2\n\n\nThe results of the siRNA knockdown experiment are summarized in \nFIG. 10\n. In agreement with what we have observed previously for PLK2 siRNA inhibition (see Example 5) knockdown resulted in a 25% decrease in the percentage of phosphorylated synuclein in the 293 cells.\n\n\nPLK3\n\n\nThe knockdown of PLK3 also had no effect on synuclein phosphorylation, which is not in agreement with the PLK3 overexpression data. This may be due to the fact that overexpression can be somewhat promiscuous, and not indicative of the true physiological state within cells. It may also be that PLK3 is not the synuclein kinase in 293 cells, but it could still be the synuclein kinase in neurons or other cells due to the potential for isoform switching between cell types. Thus, although PLK3 knockdown does not reduce synuclein phosphorylation as we would expect from inhibition of the synuclein kinase, it does not completely eliminate PLK3 as being the correct PLK family member as the synuclein kinase in neurons.\n\n\nPLK1\n\n\nCells treated with PLK1 siRNA showed a 40% decrease in the total protein levels compared to the negative siRNA control, indicating that treatment of cells with PLK1 siRNA inhibits proliferation of cells. This has been noted in the literature, and confirms the role of PLK1 in mitosis. Taking into account this change in total protein levels, knockdown of PLK1 transcript results in a 60-90% increase in the percentage of phospho-synuclein. This indicates that PLK1 is negative regulator of synuclein phosphorylation. It appears that when PLK1 is present in cell, it regulates PLK2 or it's upstream pathway and accordingly the level of PLK2-mediated phosphorylation of synuclein. This increase in phospho-synuclein with PLK1 knockdown has been observed in two independent experiments, and is intriguing as a potential regulator of PLK2-driven synuclein phosphorylation.\n\n\nPLK4\n\n\nKnockdown of PLK4 with siRNA had no effect on synuclein phosphorylation, in accord with the PLK4 overexpression data above (Example 11).\n\n\nEXAMPLE 14\n\n\nTreatment of Primary Neuronal Cultures with Kinase Inhibitors\n\n\nThe effect on levels of serine-129 synuclein was tested for kinase inhibitors with various specificities in rat and mouse primary cortical cell culture was tested.\n\n\nTable 17 shows the inhibitors used in the experiment:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE 17\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInhibitor\n \n \nPrimary Specificity\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1\n \nELN-481080\n \nPLK1\n \n \n \n2\n \nELN-481574-2 (BI 2536)\n \n \nPLK\n 1, 2, 3\n \n \n \n3\n \nELN-481530\n \nJNK3\n \n \n \n4\n \nDMAT (2-Dimethylamino-\n \nCasein kinase 2\n \n \n \n \n \n4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-\n \n \n \n \n \n1H-benzimidazole)\n \n \n \n5\n \nScytonemin\n \nPLK1, PKCβ1, PKCβ2,\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCdk1/B, Myt1, and Chk1\n \n \n \n6\n \nK252A\n \nGeneric kinase inhibitor\n \n \n \n7\n \nWortmannin\n \nGeneric kinase inhibitor\n \n \n \n8\n \nN-benzoyl staurosporine\n \nGeneric kinase inhibitor\n \n \n \n9\n \nTBB (4,5,6,7-Tetrabromo-\n \nATP/GTP-competitive\n \n \n \n \n \n2-azabenzimidazole)\n \ninhibitor of casein kinase 2\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nPreparation of Mouse Neuronal Cell Cultures\n\n\n\nMouse cortical cultures from fetal (i) Swiss-Webster, (ii) C56BL/6 WT and (iii) C56BL/6 E46K-Synuclein Trangenic mice were prepared and maintained in B27/DMEM/1% Penicillin-Streptomycin at 37° C./10% CO\n2 \nfor three to fourteen days and then treated with kinase inhibitors.\n\n\nCultures were exposed to inhibitors for two hours in B27/DMEM/1% Penicillin-Streptomycin.

A Micro BCA (Pierce) total protein assay, and total synuclein and phospho-synuclein ELISAs were performed on each plate of treated cells using standard methods.\n\n\nPreparation of Rat Neuronal Cell Cultures\n\n\nRat Ventral Mesencephalon (RVM) cultures were prepared from E15 Wistar rats. The RVM cultures were cultured for 2 days and transduced with 0.75 MOI E46K-Synuclein lentivirus alone, or 0.75 MOI E46K-Synuclein lentivirus plus 0.75 MOI ca-PLK2 lentivirus. The mid-brain region, ventral mesencephalon, from \nembryonic day\n 15 Wistar rats were dissected and pooled for processing for culture as described previously in Steven et al., 2001, Genetics 10:1317-24 with the medium supplement replaced with B27 (Invitrogen) and 1% FBS (HyClone). Transduced cultures were maintained in neuronal media with B27/1% FBS and 37° C./5% CO\n2 \nuntil treated with inhibitors. On DIV 17 (which corresponds to 15 days after viral transduction of the cultures) cells were treated with inhibitors for two hours. Cells were then harvested as detailed above in neuronal media with B27/1% FBS. A Micro BCA (Pierce) total protein assay, and total synuclein and phospho-synuclein ELISAs were performed on each plate of treated cells using standard methods.\n\n\nResults\n\n\nThe effects of inhibitors on phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein are summarized in Tables 18 and 19. Table 18 shows that the extent of inhibition of synuclein phosphorylation by selected inhibitors is similar for the endogenous kinase in mouse and rat primary cultures, as well as a constitutively active PLK2 variant (caPLK2). In caPLK2 the polo-box has been deleted, activating the Thr to Asp mutation in the kinase activation loop. Table 19 shows the rank order of potency for selected inhibitors is similar between cell types and across species (mouse, rat and human)\n\n\nThe results of treatment of several primary neuronal cultures with PLK and other inhibitors were very similar to those observed in 293 cells in both the EC\n50 \nvalues (Table 18) and the rank order of potency (Table 19). The EC\n50 \nvalues for the potent PLK inhibitor BI 2536 (ELN-481574-2) in all cellular paradigms were in the nanomolar range, with most EC\n50 \nvalues being 100 nM or less, and has an IC\n50 \nof 27 nM in the in vitro biochemical assay. This PLK inhibitor is a very potent inhibitor of synuclein phosphorylation in primary neuronal cultures in mouse and rat, substantiating the role of a PLK family member as the synuclein kinase.\n\n\nThe second most potent inhibitor in most of the cellular paradigms tested was the generic kinase inhibitor K252A (EC\n50 \nvalues of 3-7 μM). In the in vitro biochemical reaction, K252A does not inhibit PLK2-driven synuclein phosphorylation (IC\n50\n>10 μM), indicating that its inhibition of synuclein phosphorylation is through an upstream or downstream regulator of PLK2.\n\n\nThe third most potent inhibitor of synuclein phosphorylation in primary neuronal cells is ELN-481080, a PLK1 inhibitor that also has inhibitory activity on PLK2, and to a lesser degree, PLK3 and PLK4 (see Table 21). The IC\n50 \nof ELN-481080 was 7.7 μM, and the EC\n50 \nvalues in most cellular paradigms was 12-38 μM.\n\n\nThe fourth most potent inhibitor of synuclein phosphorylation in primary neuronal cells is the casein kinase 2 inhibitor DMAT (2-Dimethylamino-4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzimidazole). The EC\n50 \nvalues for inhibition of synuclein phosphorylation in each of the cell types were 16-33 μM. In the biochemical assay DMAT was the second most potent inhibitor of synuclein phosphorylation with an IC\n50 \nof 2.07 μM. That DMAT can directly act on PLK2 to inhibit synuclein phosphorylation suggests that reports by others using to DMAT to show that the CKII is the synuclein kinase may be due to the inhibitory effect the DMAT has on PLK2 and not on casein kinase 2. To confirm that the inhibitory effect DMAT is due to inhibition of PLK2, MCC were treated with TBB, a very specific CKII inhibitor. TBB had no effect on synuclein phosphorylation, even at concentrations of 100 μM (data not shown). Thus, we are confident that the inhibitory effect of DMAT on synuclein phosphorylation is due to its direct activity on PLK2 and not CKII.\n\n\nThe other four inhibitors tested, Scytonemin, Wortmannin and N-benzoyl staurosporine did not inhibit 50% of synuclein phosphorylation in any of the cells or in the in vitro assay. ELN-481530, the JNK3 inhibitor, also did not inhibit PLK2-driven phosphorylation in vitro, or in most cell types tested. However, in RVM stably transduced with E46K-synuclein (but not in conjunction with caPLK2), concentrations of 1 μM or greater of ELN-481530 and above inhibited 50% of synuclein phosphorylation, with the inhibition reaching a plateau of 50%. In addition, 293 cells over-expressing human WT-synuclein and WT-PLK2 reached the same plateau of 50% inhibition at 10 μM ELN-481530. While further work needs to be done to elucidate the role that JNK may play in synuclein phosphorylation, it seems reasonable to suggest the JNK may be a regulator of PLK2 and synuclein phosphorylation in certain cell types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EC\n50\n/IC\n50 \nvalues for selected inhibitors are similar between cell types and\n\n\n\n\n\n\nacross species (mouse, rat and human)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nRVM E46K-\n\n\n \n\n\nOver-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nStraight\n\n\n \n\n\nE46K-Syn TG\n\n\nSwiss-Webster\n\n\nRVM E46K-\n\n\nSynuclein\n\n\nEndogenous\n\n\nExpressed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInhibitor\n\n\nBiochemical\n\n\nWT-MCC\n\n\nMCC\n\n\nMCC\n\n\nSynuclein\n\n\ncaPLK2\n\n\nKinase (293)\n\n\nPLK2 (293)*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nELN-481080\n\n\n  7.7 μM\n\n\n 17.3 μM\n\n\n 12.3 μM\n\n\n 14.8 μM\n\n\n~100 μM\n\n\n 25.2 μM\n\n\n~100 μM\n\n\n 38 μM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nELN-481574-2\n\n\n0.027 μM \n\n\n <0.1 μM\n\n\n <0.1 μM\n\n\n0.092 μM \n\n\n0.598 μM \n\n\n0.078 μM \n\n\n0.054 μM \n\n\n 0.07 μM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDMAT\n\n\n 2.07 μM\n\n\n 18.7 μM\n\n\n 16.6 μM\n\n\n 21.6 \nμM\n \n\n\n 20 μM\n\n\n 28.5 μM\n\n\n 33 μM\n\n\n 18.6 μM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nK252A\n\n\n >10 μM\n\n\n  3 μM\n\n\n  3.1 μM\n\n\n  2.9 μM\n\n\n  3.2 μM\n\n\n  3.5 μM\n\n\n  3.6 μM\n\n\n  7.1 μM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nELN-481530\n\n\n>100 μM\n\n\n>100 μM\n\n\n>100 μM\n\n\nNT\n\n\n ~1 μM\n\n\n>100 μM\n\n\n>100 μM\n\n\n ~10 μM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScytonemin\n\n\n>100 μM\n\n\n>100 μM\n\n\n>100 μM\n\n\nNT\n\n\n>100 μM\n\n\n>100 μM\n\n\n>100 μM\n\n\n>100 μM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWortmannin\n\n\n>100 μM\n\n\n>100 μM\n\n\n>100 μM\n\n\nNT\n\n\n>100 μM\n\n\n>100 μM\n\n\n>100 μM\n\n\n>100 μM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN-Benzoyl\n\n\n>100 μM\n\n\n>100 μM\n\n\n>100 μM\n\n\nNT\n\n\n>100 μM\n\n\n>100 μM\n\n\n>100 μM\n\n\n>100 μM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStaurosporine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n*See Example 14\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNT - Inhibitor not tested in these cells\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rank order of potency for selected inhibitors is similar for different cell types\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand species (mouse, rat and human)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nRVM E46K-\n\n\n \n\n\nOver-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nStraight\n\n\n \n\n\nE46K-Syn TG\n\n\nSwiss-Webster\n\n\nRVM E46K-\n\n\nSynuclein\n\n\nEndogenous\n\n\nExpressed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInhibitor\n\n\nBiochemical\n\n\nWT-MCC\n\n\nMCC\n\n\nMCC\n\n\nSynuclein\n\n\ncaPLK2\n\n\nKinase (293)\n\n\nPLK2 (293)*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nELN-481080\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n5\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nELN-481574-2\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDMAT\n\n\n2\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nK252A\n\n\n4\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nELN-481530\n\n\nNA\n\n\nNA\n\n\nNA\n\n\nNA\n\n\n2\n\n\nNA\n\n\nNA\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScytonemin\n\n\nNA\n\n\nNA\n\n\nNA\n\n\nNA\n\n\nNA\n\n\nNA\n\n\nNA\n\n\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWortmannin\n\n\nNA\n\n\nNA\n\n\nNA\n\n\nNA\n\n\nNA\n\n\nNA\n\n\nNA\n\n\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN-Benzoyl\n\n\nNA\n\n\nNA\n\n\nNA\n\n\nNA\n\n\nNA\n\n\nNA\n\n\nNA\n\n\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStaurosporine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n*See Example 14\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNA—Not Applicable due to an EC\n50 \nnot being reached\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 15\n\n\nSpecificity of ELN-481574\n\n\nPLK inhibitor ELN-481574-2 (BI 2536) exhibited high potency for reducing alpha-synuclein phosphorylation in a variety of cells, including primary neuronal cells (see Example 14). The inhibitor was screened against a panel of 260 kinases (almost half the kinome) and found that at 10 uM, ELN-481574 was very potent in inhibiting PLK2 and PLK3, although the compound also inhibited several CaMKs and casein kinases. The ten kinases that were inhibited the most by ELN-481574 were subjected to a nine-point dose-response (0.003 uM to 3 uM) of the compound to determine the IC50. The ELN-481574 compound has 16-fold selectivity for PLK2 (\nIC\n \n \n \n50 \n11 nM) and 13-fold selectivity for PLK3 (IC\n50 \n14 nM) over the next closest kinase IC\n50 \n(CaMKIIδ 182 nM). See Table 20 for a summary.

EC\n50 \nvalues (Table 21) and a rank order of potency (Table 22) was similar to that seen in primary neuronal cells (see Example 13). The PLK inhibitor ELN-481574-2 was the most potent inhibitor of synuclein phosphorylation by the endogenous kinase and by each of the over-expressed PLKs. The EC\n50 \nfor the endogenous kinase was 99 nM, and was 36 nM, 80 nM, 438 nM and 192 nM for each of the PLK1, 2, 3 and 4. The EC\n50 \nfor PLK3 is somewhat higher than it is for the endogenous kinase or the other PLKs.\n\n\nThe second most potent inhibitor of synuclein phosphorylation was DMAT, with EC\n50 \nvalues of ˜14-74 μM for the over-expressed PLKs and 56 μM for the endogenous kinase. The PLK1 inhibitor ELN-481080 shows selectivity for PLK1 (16.7 μM) over PLK2 (47.8 μM), and while an EC\n50 \nwas not reached for inhibition of synuclein phosphorylation by over-expressed PLK3 or PLK4, ELN-481080 did inhibit 30-40% of synuclein phosphorylation at concentrations of 30-100 μM.

However, it did inhibit 30-45% of synuclein phosphorylation by cells overexpressing PLK2 or PLK3 at concentrations of 1 μM and above.

No. 13/010,974, filed on Jan. 21, 2011, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional application 61/336,460, filed on Jan. 22, 2010, the contents of which are incorporated herein in its entirety.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe identification of small organic molecules that affect specific biological functions is an endeavor that impacts both biology and medicine. Such molecules are useful as therapeutic agents and as probes of biological function. Such small molecules have been useful at elucidating signal transduction pathways by acting as chemical protein knockouts, thereby causing a loss of protein function. (Schreiber et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc, 1990, 112, 5583; Mitchison, Chem. and Biol., 1994, I5 3) Additionally, due to the interaction of these small molecules with particular biological targets and their ability to affect specific biological function (e.g. gene transcription), they may also serve as candidates for the development of new therapeutics.\n\n\nOne biological target of recent interest is histone deacetylase (HDAC) (see, for example, a discussion of the use of inhibitors of histone deacetylases for the treatment of cancer: Marks et al. Nature Reviews Cancer 2001, 7,194; Johnstone et al. Nature Reviews Drug Discovery 2002, 287). Post-translational modification of proteins through acetylation and deacetylation of lysine residues plays a critical role in regulating their cellular functions. HDACs are zinc hydrolases that modulate gene expression through deacetylation of the N-acetyl-lysine residues of histone proteins and other transcriptional regulators (Hassig et al Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1997, 1, 300-308). HDACs participate in cellular pathways that control cell shape and differentiation, and an HDAC inhibitor has been shown effective in treating an otherwise recalcitrant cancer (Warrell et al J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998, 90, 1621-1625). At this time, eleven human HDACs, which use Zn as a cofactor, have been identified (Taunton et al. Science 1996, 272, 408-411; Yang et al. J. Biol. Chem. 1997, 272, 28001-28007. Grozinger et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sd. U.S.A. 1999, 96, 4868-4873; Kao et al. Genes Dev. 2000, 14, 55-66. Hu et al J. Biol. Chem. 2000, 275, 15254-15264; Zhou et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. ScI U.S.A. 2001, 98, 10572-10577; Venter et al. Science 2001, 291, 1304-1351) these members fall into three classes (class I, II, and IV). An additional seven HDACs have been identified which use NAD as a cofactor. To date, no small molecules are known that selectively target any particular class or individual members of this family ((for example ortholog-selective HDAC inhibitors have been reported: (a) Meinke et al. J. Med. Chem. 2000, 14, 4919-4922; (b) Meinke, et al Curr. Med. Chem. 2001, 8, 211-235). There remains a need for preparing structurally diverse HDAC and tubulin deacetylase (TDAC) inhibitors particularly ones that are potent and/or selective inhibitors of particular classes of HDACs or TDACs and individual HDACs and TDACs.\n\n\nRecently, a cytoplasmic histone deacetylase protein, HDAC6, was identified as necessary for aggresome formation and for survival of cells following ubiquitinated misfolded protein stress. The aggresome is an integral component of survival in cancer cells. The mechanism of HDAC6-mediated aggresome formation is a consequence of the catalytic activity of the carboxy-terminal deacetylase domain, targeting an uncharacterized non-histone target. The present invention also provides small molecule inhibitors of HDAC6. In certain embodiments, these new compounds are potent and selective inhibitors of HDAC6.\n\n\nThe aggresome was first described in 1998, when it was reported that there was an appearance of microtubule-associated perinuclear inclusion bodies in cells over-expressing the pathologic ΔF508 allele of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance receptor (CFTR). Subsequent reports identified a pathologic appearance of the aggresome with over-expressed presenilin-1 (Johnston J A, et al. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143:1883-1898), parkin (Junn E, et al. J Biol Chem. 2002; 277: 47870-47877), peripheral myelin protein PMP22 (Notterpek L, et al. Neurobiol Dis. 1999; 6: 450-460), influenza virus nucleoprotein (Anton L C, et al. J Cell Biol. 1999; 146:113-124), a chimera of GFP and the membrane transport protein pi 15 (Garcia-Mata R, et al. J Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1239-1254) and notably amyloidogenic light chains (DuI J L, et al. J Cell Biol. 2001; 152:705-716). Model systems have been established to study ubiquitinated (ΔF508 CFTR) (Johnston J A, et al. J Cell Biol. 1998; 143:1883-1898) and non-ubiquitinated (GFP-250) (Garcia-Mata R, et al. J Cell Biol. 1999; 146:1239-1254) protein aggregate transport to the aggresome. Secretory, mutated, and wild-type proteins may assume unstable kinetic intermediates resulting in stable aggregates incapable of degradation through the narrow channel of the 26S proteasome. These complexes undergo active, retrograde transport by dynein to the pericentriolar aggresome, mediated in part by a cytoplasmic histone deacetylase, HDAC6 (Kawaguchi Y, et al. Cell. 2003; 1 15:727-738).\n\n\nHistone deacetylases are a family of at least 11 zinc-binding hydrolases, which catalyze the deacetylation of lysine residues on histone proteins. HDAC inhibition results in hyperacetylation of chromatin, alterations in transcription, growth arrest, and apoptosis in cancer cell lines. Early phase clinical trials with available nonselective HDAC inhibitors demonstrate responses in hematologic malignancies including multiple myeloma, although with significant toxicity. Of note, in vitro synergy of conventional chemotherapy agents (such as melphalan) with bortezomib has been reported in myeloma cell lines, though dual proteasome-aggresome inhibition was not proposed. Until recently selective HDAC inhibitors have not been realized.\n\n\nHDAC6 is required for aggresome formation with ubiquitinated protein stress and is essential for cellular viability in this context. HDAC6 is believed to bind ubiquitinated proteins through a zinc finger domain and interacts with the dynein motor complex through another discrete binding motif. HDAC6 possesses two catalytic deacetylase domains. It is not presently known whether the amino-terminal histone deacetylase or the carboxy-terminal tubulin deacetylase (TDAC) domain mediates aggresome formation.\n\n\nAberrant protein catabolism is a hallmark of cancer, and is implicated in the stabilization of oncogenic proteins and the degradation of tumor suppressors (Adams J. Nat Rev Cancer. 2004; 4:349-360). Tumor necrosis factor alpha induced activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NFKB) is a relevant example, mediated by NFKB inhibitor beta (IKB) proteolytic degradation in malignant plasma cells. The inhibition of IKB catabolism by proteasome inhibitors explains, in part, the apoptotic growth arrest of treated myeloma cells (Hideshima T, et al. Cancer Res. 2001; 61:3071-3076). Multiple myeloma is an ideal system for studying the mechanisms of protein degradation in cancer. Since William Russell in 1890, cytoplasmic inclusions have been regarded as a defining histological feature of malignant plasma cells. Though the precise composition of Russell bodies is not known, they are regarded as ER-derived vesicles containing aggregates of monotypic immunoglobulins (Kopito R R, Sitia R. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1:225-231) and stain positive for ubiquitin (Manetto V, et al. Am J Pathol. 1989; 134:505-513). Russell bodies have been described with CFTR over-expression in yeast (Sullivan M L, et al. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2003; 51:545-548), thus raising the suspicion that these structures may be linked to overwhelmed protein catabolism, and potentially the aggresome. The role of the aggresome in cancer remains undefined.\n\n\nAberrant histone deacetylase activity has also been linked to various neurological and neurodegenerative disorders, including stroke, Huntington's disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. HDAC inhibition may induce the expression of anti-mitotic and anti-apoptotic genes, such as p21 and HSP-70, which facilitate survival. HDAC inhibitors can act on other neural cell types in the central nervous system, such as reactive astrocytes and microglia, to reduce inflammation and secondary damage during neuronal injury or disease. HDAC inhibition is a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of a range of central nervous system disorders (Langley B et al., 2005, Current Drug Targets—CNS & Neurological Disorders, 4: 41-50).\n\n\nHistone deacetylase is known to play an essential role in the transcriptional machinery for regulating gene expression, induce histone hyperacetylation and to affect the gene expression. Therefore, it is useful as a therapeutic or prophylactic agent for diseases caused by abnormal gene expression such as inflammatory disorders, diabetes, diabetic complications, homozygous thalassemia, fibrosis, cirrhosis, acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL), organ transplant rejections, autoimmune diseases, protozoal infections, tumors, etc. Thus, there remains a need for the development of novel inhibitors of histone deacetylases and tubulin histone deacetylases. In particular, inhibitors that are more potent and/or more specific for their particular target than known HDAC and TDAC inhibitors. HDAC inhibitors specific for a certain class or member of the HDAC family would be particularly useful both in the treatment of proliferative diseases and protein deposition disorders and in the study of HDACs, particularly HDAC6. Inhibitors that are specific for HDAC versus TDAC and vice versa are also useful in treating disease and probing biological pathways. The present invention provides novel compounds, pharmaceutical compositions thereof, and methods of using these compounds to treat disorders related to HDAC6 including cancers, inflammatory, autoimmune, neurological and neurodegenerative disorders.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nIn one aspect, the invention provides a compound of formula I:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nor a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester or prodrug thereof,\n\n\nwherein,\n\n\nZ is N or CR*, wherein R* is an optionally substituted alkyl, an optionally substituted acyl, an optionally substituted aryl or an optionally substituted heteroaryl;\n\n\nring A is an optionally substituted aryl or an optionally substituted heteroaryl;\n\n\nring B is an optionally substituted aryl or an optionally substituted heteroaryl;\n\n\nR\n1 \nis (i) H, alkyl, haloalkyl, alkenyl, aryl, arylalkyl, heteroaryl, heterocyclic, carbocyclic, C(O)—R\n2\n, C(O)O—R\n2\n, or S(O)\np\n, each of which may be optionally substituted;

The terms “optionally substituted”, “optionally substituted alkyl,” “optionally substituted “optionally substituted alkenyl,” “optionally substituted alkynyl”, “optionally substituted cycloalkyl,” “optionally substituted cycloalkenyl,” “optionally substituted aryl”, “optionally substituted heteroaryl,” “optionally substituted aralkyl”, “optionally substituted heteroaralkyl,” “optionally substituted heterocycloalkyl,” and any other optionally substituted group as used herein, refer to groups that are substituted or unsubstituted by independent replacement of one, two, or three or more of the hydrogen atoms thereon with substituents including, but not limited to:\n\n\nalkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, heterocycloalkyl, heteroaryl, arylalkyl, heteroarylalkyl,\n\n\n—F, —Cl, —Br, —I,\n\n\n—OH, protected hydroxy, oxygen, oxo,\n\n\n—NO\n2\n, —CN,\n\n\n—NH\n2\n, protected amino, —NH—C\n1\n-C\n12\n-alkyl, —NH-aryl, -dialkylamino, —\n\n\n—O—C\n1\n-C\n12\n-alkyl, —O-aryl,\n\n\n—C(O)—, —C(O)O—, —C(O)NH—, —OC(O)—, —OC(O)O—, —OC(O)NH—, —NHC(O)—, —NHC(O)O—,\n\n\n—C(O)—C\n1\n-C\n12\n-alkyl, —C(O)—C\n3\n-C\n12\n-cycloalkyl, —C(O)-aryl, —C(O)-heteroaryl, —C(O)-heterocycloalkyl,\n\n\n—C(O)O—C\n1\n-C\n12\n-alkyl, —C(O)O—C\n3\n-C\n12\n-cycloalkyl, —C(O)O-aryl, —C(O)O-heteroaryl, —C(O)O-heterocycloalkyl,\n\n\n—CONH\n2\n, —CONH—C\n1\n-C\n12\n-alkyl, —CONH-aryl,\n\n\n—OCO\n2\n—C\n1\n-C\n12\n-alkyl, —OCO\n2\n-aryl, —OCONH\n2\n, —OCONH—C\n1\n-C\n12\n-alkyl, —OCONH— aryl,\n\n\n—NHC(O)—C\n1\n-C\n12\n-alkyl, —NHC(O)-aryl, —NHCO\n2\n—C\n1\n-C\n12\n-alkyl, —NHCO\n2\n— aryl, —S(O)—C\n1\n-C\n12\n-alkyl, —S(O)-aryl, —SO\n2\nNH—C\n1\n-C\n12\n-alkyl, —SO\n2\nNH— aryl,\n\n\n—NHSO\n2\n—C\n1\n-C\n12\n-alkyl, —NHSO\n2\n-aryl,\n\n\n—SH, —S—C\n1\n-C\n12\n-alkyl, or —S-aryl.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the optionally substituted groups include the following: C\n1\n-C\n12\n-alkyl, C\n2\n-C\n12\n-alkenyl, C\n2\n-C\n12\n-alkynyl, C\n3\n-C\n12\n-cycloalkyl, C\n3\n-C\n12\n-aryl, C\n3\n-C\n12\n-heterocycloalkyl, C\n3\n-C\n12\n-heteroaryl, C\n4\n-C\n12\n-arylalkyl, or C\n2\n-C\n12\n-heteroarylalkyl.\n\n\nIt is understood that the aryls, heteroaryls, alkyls, and the like can be further substituted.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “metal chelator” refers to any molecule or moiety that is capable of forming a complex (i.e., “chelates”) with a metal ion. In certain exemplary embodiments, a metal chelator refers to any molecule or moiety that “binds” to a metal ion, in solution, making it unavailable for use in chemical/enzymatic reactions. In certain embodiments, the solution comprises aqueous environments under physiological conditions. Examples of metal ions include, but are not limited to, Ca\n2+\n, Fe\n3+\n, Zn\n2+\n, Na\n+\n, etc. In certain embodiments, the metal chelator binds Zn\n2+\n. In certain embodiments, molecules of moieties that precipitate metal ions are not considered to be metal chelators.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “small molecule” refers to a non-peptidic, non-oligomeric organic compound either synthesized in the laboratory or found in nature. Small molecules, as used herein, can refer to compounds that are “natural product-like”, however, the term “small molecule” is not limited to “natural product-like” compounds. Rather, a small molecule is typically characterized in that it contains several carbon-carbon bonds, and has a molecular weight of less than 1500, although this characterization is not intended to be limiting for the purposes of the present invention. Examples of “small molecules” that occur in nature include, but are not limited to, taxol, dynemicin, and rapamycin. In certain other preferred embodiments, natural-product-like small molecules are utilized.\n\n\nThe term “subject” as used herein refers to a mammal. A subject therefore refers to, for example, dogs, cats, horses, cows, pigs, guinea pigs, and the like. Preferably the subject is a human. When the subject is a human, the subject may be referred to herein as a patient.\n\n\nTreat”, “treating” and “treatment” refer to a method of alleviating or abating a disease and/or its attendant symptoms.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” refers to those salts of the compounds formed by the process of the present invention which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans and lower animals without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response and the like, and are commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are well known in the art. For example, S. M. Berge, et al. describes pharmaceutically acceptable salts in detail in J. Pharmaceutical Sciences, 66: 1-19 (1977). The salts can be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of the compounds of the invention, or separately by reacting the free base function with a suitable organic acid. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable include, but are not limited to, nontoxic acid addition salts are salts of an amino group formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid and perchloric acid or with organic acids such as acetic acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, succinic acid or malonic acid or by using other methods used in the art such as ion exchange. Other pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, adipate, alginate, ascorbate, aspartate, benzenesulfonate, benzoate, bisulfate, borate, butyrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, citrate, cyclopentanepropionate, digluconate, dodecylsulfate, ethanesulfonate, formate, fumarate, glucoheptonate, glycerophosphate, gluconate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxy-ethanesulfonate, lactobionate, lactate, laurate, lauryl sulfate, malate, maleate, malonate, methanesulfonate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, nicotinate, nitrate, oleate, oxalate, palmitate, pamoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenylpropionate, phosphate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, stearate, succinate, sulfate, tartrate, thiocyanate, p-toluenesulfonate, undecanoate, valerate salts, and the like. Representative alkali or alkaline earth metal salts include sodium, lithium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and the like. Further pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, when appropriate, nontoxic ammonium, quaternary ammonium, and amine cations formed using counterions such as halide, hydroxide, carboxylate, sulfate, phosphate, nitrate, alkyl having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, sulfonate and aryl sulfonate.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable ester” refers to esters of the compounds formed by the process of the present invention which hydrolyze in vivo and include those that break down readily in the human body to leave the parent compound or a salt thereof. Suitable ester groups include, for example, those derived from pharmaceutically acceptable aliphatic carboxylic acids, particularly alkanoic, alkenoic, cycloalkanoic and alkanedioic acids, in which each alkyl or alkenyl moiety advantageously has not more than 6 carbon atoms. Examples of particular esters include, but are not limited to, formates, acetates, propionates, butyrates, acrylates and ethylsuccinates.\n\n\nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs” as used herein refers to those prodrugs of the compounds formed by the process of the present invention which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans and lower animals with undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and the like, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, and effective for their intended use, as well as the zwitterionic forms, where possible, of the compounds of the present invention. “Prodrug”, as used herein means a compound which is convertible in vivo by metabolic means (e.g. by hydrolysis) to afford any compound delineated by the formulae of the instant invention. Various forms of prodrugs are known in the art, for example, as discussed in Bundgaard, (ed.), Design of Prodrugs, Elsevier (1985); Widder, et al. (ed.), Methods in Enzymology, vol. 4, Academic Press (1985); Krogsgaard-Larsen, et al., (ed). “Design and Application of Prodrugs, Textbook of Drug Design and Development, Chapter 5, 113-191 (1991); Bundgaard, et al., Journal of Drug Deliver Reviews, 8:1-38 (1992); Bundgaard, J. of Pharmaceutical Sciences, 77:285 et seq. (1988); Higuchi and Stella (eds.) Prodrugs as Novel Drug Delivery Systems, American Chemical Society (1975); and Bernard Testa & Joachim Mayer, “Hydrolysis In Drug And Prodrug Metabolism: Chemistry, Biochemistry And Enzymology,” John Wiley and Sons, Ltd. (2002).\n\n\nThis invention also encompasses pharmaceutical compositions containing, and methods of treating disorders through administering, pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs of compounds of the invention. For example, compounds of the invention having free amino, amido, hydroxy or carboxylic groups can be converted into prodrugs. Prodrugs include compounds wherein an amino acid residue, or a polypeptide chain of two or more (e.g., two, three or four) amino acid residues is covalently joined through an amide or ester bond to a free amino, hydroxy or carboxylic acid group of compounds of the invention. The amino acid residues include but are not limited to the 20 naturally occurring amino acids commonly designated by three letter symbols and also includes 4-hydroxyproline, hydroxyysine, demosine, isodemosine, 3-methylhistidine, norvalin, beta-alanine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, citrulline, homocysteine, homoserine, ornithine and methionine sulfone. Additional types of prodrugs are also encompassed. For instance, free carboxyl groups can be derivatized as amides or alkyl esters. Free hydroxy groups may be derivatized using groups including but not limited to hemisuccinates, phosphate esters, dimethylaminoacetates, and phosphoryloxymethyloxy carbonyls, as outlined in Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews, 1996, 19, 1 15. Carbamate prodrugs of hydroxy and amino groups are also included, as are carbonate prodrugs, sulfonate esters and sulfate esters of hydroxy groups. Derivatization of hydroxy groups as (acyloxy)methyl and (acyloxy)ethyl ethers wherein the acyl group may be an alkyl ester, optionally substituted with groups including but not limited to ether, amine and carboxylic acid functionalities, or where the acyl group is an amino acid ester as described above, are also encompassed. Prodrugs of this type are described in J. Med. Chem. 1996, 39, 10. Free amines can also be derivatized as amides, sulfonamides or phosphonamides. All of these prodrug moieties may incorporate groups including but not limited to ether, amine and carboxylic acid functionalities\n\n\nCombinations of substituents and variables envisioned by this invention are only those that result in the formation of stable compounds. The term “stable”, as used herein, refers to compounds which possess stability sufficient to allow manufacture and which maintains the integrity of the compound for a sufficient period of time to be useful for the purposes detailed herein (e.g., therapeutic or prophylactic administration to a subject).\n\n\nThe terms “isolated,” “purified,” or “biologically pure” refer to material that is substantially or essentially free from components that normally accompany it as found in its native state. Purity and homogeneity are typically determined using analytical chemistry techniques such as polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or high performance liquid chromatography. Particularly, in embodiments the compound is at least 85% pure, more preferably at least 90% pure, more preferably at least 95% pure, and most preferably at least 99% pure.\n\n\nCompounds of the

In certain embodiments, the compounds of the present invention are useful as inhibitors of histone or tubulin deacetylases and thus are useful as anti-cancer agents, and thus may be useful in the treatment of cancer, by effecting tumor cell death or inhibiting the growth of tumor cells. In certain exemplary embodiments, the inventive anticancer agents are useful in the treatment of cancers and other proliferative disorders, including, but not limited to breast cancer, cervical cancer, colon and rectal cancer, leukemia, lung cancer, melanoma, multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, and gastric cancer, to name a few. In certain embodiments, the inventive anticancer agents are active against leukemia cells and melanoma cells, and thus are useful for the treatment of leukemias (e.g., myeloid, lymphocytic, myelocytic and lymphoblastic leukemias) and malignant melanomas. In certain embodiments, the compounds are useful in the treatment of multiple myeloma.\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention are especially effective to treat or prevent inflammatory, immune and autoimmune diseases including, but not limited to, arthritic conditions, such as, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis; rheumatoid spondylitis; psoriasis; post ischemic perfusion injury; inflammatory bowel disease; chronic inflammatory pulmonary disease, eczema, asthma, psoriasis, ischemia/reperfusion injury, ulcerative colitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, psoriatic arthritis, infectious arthritis, progressive chronic arthritis, deforming arthritis, osteoarthritis, traumatic arthritis, gouty arthritis, Reiter's syndrome, polychondritis, acute synovitis and spondylitis, glomerulonephritis (with or without nephrotic syndrome), autoimmune hematologic disorders (e.g. hemolytic anemia, aplasic anemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenia and neutropenia), autoimmune gastritis and autoimmune inflammatory bowel diseases (e.g. ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease), host versus graft disease, allograft rejection, chronic thyroiditis, Graves' disease, scleroderma, diabetes (type I and type II), active hepatitis (acute and chronic), primary binary cirrhosis, myasthenia gravis, multiple sclerosis (MS), systemic lupus erythematosus, atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, skin sunburns, chronic renal insufficiency, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, idiopathic sprue, sarcoidosis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, uveitis, conjunctivitis, keratoconjunctivitis, otitis media, periodontal disease, pulmonary interstitial fibrosis, asthma, bronchitis, rhinitis, sinusitis, pneumoconiosis, pulmonary insufficiency syndrome, pulmonary emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis, silicosis, chronic inflammatory pulmonary disease (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and other inflammatory or obstructive diseases of the airways.\n\n\nAdditionally, the inventive compounds may also be useful in the treatment of protozoal infections. The inventive compounds are also useful in the treatment of diseases associated with aberrant protein catabolism, for example, protein degradation disorders, disorders associated with misfolded proteins, and protein deposition disorders. In certain embodiments, the compound are useful in the treatment of the protein deposition disorders, Wilson's disease, spinocerebellar ataxia, prion disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal muscular atrophy, spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, amyloidosis, Alzheimer's disease, Alexander's disease, alcoholic liver disease, cystic fibrosis, Pick's disease, and Lewy body dementia. In certain exemplary embodiments, the compounds of the invention are useful for disorders associated with histone deacetylation activity. In certain exemplary embodiments, the compounds of the invention are useful for disorders associated with tubulin deacetylation activity.\n\n\nNeurodegenerative diseases that can be treated or prevented include Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, cerebral ischaemia, traumatic neurodegenerative disease, Huntingtons's disease or chorea, senile dementia, memory disorder, vascular dementia, lesions associated with cerebral ischemia (stroke) and with cranial and medullary trauma, among others.\n\n\nMethods delineated herein include those wherein the subject is identified as in need of a particular stated treatment. Identifying a subject in need of such treatment can be in the judgment of a subject or a health care professional and can be subjective (e.g. opinion) or objective (e.g. measurable by a test or diagnostic method).\n\n\nAs discussed above, the compounds of the invention are selective inhibitors of HDAC6 and, as such, are useful in the treatment of disorders modulated by histone deacetylases. As discussed above, the compounds of the invention are selective inhibitors of tubulin deacetylases and, as such, are useful in the treatment of disorders modulated by tubulin deacetylases. For example, compounds of the invention may be useful in the treatment of cancer (e.g., breast cancer, prostate cancer, multiple myeloma, leukemia, lymphoma, etc.). Accordingly, in yet another aspect, according to the methods of treatment of the present invention, tumor cells are killed, or their growth is inhibited by contacting said tumor cells with an inventive compound or composition, as described herein.\n\n\nThus, in another aspect of the invention, methods for the treatment of cancer are provided comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of an inventive compound (i.e., of any of the formulae herein), as described herein, to a subject in need thereof. In certain embodiments, the subject is identified as in need of such treatment. In certain embodiments, a method for the treatment of cancer is provided comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of an inventive compound, or a pharmaceutical composition comprising an inventive compound to a subject in need thereof, in such amounts and for such time as is necessary to achieve the desired result. In certain embodiments of the present invention a “therapeutically effective amount” of the inventive compound or pharmaceutical composition is that amount effective for killing or inhibiting the growth of tumor cells. The compounds and compositions, according to the method of the present invention, may be administered using any amount and any route of administration effective for killing or inhibiting the growth of tumor cells. Thus, the expression “amount effective to kill or inhibit the growth of tumor cells,” as used herein, refers to a sufficient amount of agent to kill or inhibit the growth of tumor cells. The exact amount required will vary from subject to subject, depending on the species, age, and general condition of the subject, the severity of the infection, the particular anticancer agent, its mode of administration, and the like.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the method involves the administration of a therapeutically effective amount of the compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof to a subject (including, but not limited to a human or animal) in need of it. In certain embodiments, the inventive compounds as useful for the treatment of cancer (including, but not limited to, glioblastoma, retinoblastoma, breast cancer, cervical cancer, colon and rectal cancer, leukemia (e.g., CML, AML, CLL, ALL), lymphoma, lung cancer (including, but not limited to small cell lung cancer), melanoma and/or skin cancer, multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer and gastric cancer, bladder cancer, uterine cancer, kidney cancer, testicular cancer, stomach cancer, brain cancer, liver cancer, or esophageal cancer).\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the inventive anticancer agents are useful in the treatment of cancers and other proliferative disorders, including, but not limited to breast cancer, cervical cancer, colon and rectal cancer, leukemia, lung cancer, melanoma, multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, and gastric cancer, to name a few. In certain embodiments, the inventive anticancer agents are active against leukemia cells and melanoma cells, and thus are useful for the treatment of leukemias (e.g., myeloid, lymphocytic, myelocytic and lymphoblastic leukemias) and malignant melanomas. In still other embodiments, the inventive anticancer agents are active against solid tumors.\n\n\nMultiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell malignancy which remains incurable despite conventional treatment (Gregory, et al. (1992) J Clin Oncol 10, 334-342) as well as high dose therapy and stem cell transplantation (Attal, M., et al. (2003) N Engl J Med 349, 2495-2502). Novel agents have recently been developed which target not only MM cells, but also the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment, and can overcome conventional drug resistance (Hideshima, T. & Anderson, K. C. (2002) Nat Rev Cancer 2, 927-937). For example, the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (formally PS-341) induces significant anti-tumor activity in human MM cell lines and freshly isolated patient MM cells (Hideshima, T. & Anderson, K. C. (2002) Nat Rev Cancer 2, 927-937; Hideshima, et al. (2001) Cancer Res. 61, 3071-3076; Mitsiades, N., et al. (2002) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 99, 14374-14379; Hideshima, T., et al. (2002) J Biol Chem 277, 16639-47; Mitsiades, N., et al. (2003) Blood 101, 2377-80; Chauhan, D., et al (2003) Cancer Res 63, 6174-6177; Hideshima, T., et al. (2003) Blood 101, 1530-1534; Hideshima, T., et al. (2003) Oncogene 22, 8386-8393; Hideshima, T., et al. (2004) Oncogene 23, 8766-8776) associated with c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) (also known as stress-activated protein kinase) and caspase activation, followed by apoptosis (Hideshima, T., et al. (2001) Cancer Res. 61, 3071-3076; Mitsiades, N., et al. (2002) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 99, 14374-14379; Hideshima, T., et al. (2003) Blood 101, 1530-1534). Bortezomib also inhibits adherence of MM cells to bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) by downregulating adhesion molecules (ICAM-1 and VCAM-1) (Hideshima, T., et al. (2001) Oncogene 20, 4519-4527); as well as induces cleavage of DNA-protein kinase catalytic subunit and ataxia telangiectasia mutated, suggesting that bortezomib also inhibits DNA repair. Neither IL-6 nor adherence of MM cells to BMSCs protects against bortezomib-induced apoptosis. Without wishing to be bound by any scientific theory, bortezomib enhances sensitivity and can overcome resistance in MM cells to conventional chemotherapeutic agents, especially to DNA damaging agents (Mitsiades, N., et al. (2003) Blood 101, 2377-80). In support of this, a phase II trial of bortezomib treatment of 202 patients with refractory relapsed MM demonstrated 35% responses, including 10% complete and near complete responses (Richardson, P. G., et al. (2003) NEnglJ Med 348, 2609-2617); however, 65% of patients did not respond. Heat-shock protein (hsp)-27 mediates bortezomib-resistance; conversely, inhibiting hsp-27 expression using hsp-27 antisense, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) siRNA, or p38 MAPK inhibitor to downregulate hsp-27 can restore MM cell susceptibility to bortezomib (Chauhan, D., et al. (2003) Cancer Res 63, 6174-6177; Hideshima, T., et al. (2004) Oncogene 23, 8766-8776).\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the inventive compounds also find use in the prevention of restenosis of blood vessels subject to traumas such as angioplasty and stenting. For example, it is contemplated that the compounds of the invention will be useful as a coating for implanted medical devices, such as tubings, shunts, catheters, artificial implants, pins, electrical implants such as pacemakers, and especially for arterial or venous stents, including balloon-expandable stents. In certain embodiments inventive compounds may be bound to an implantable medical device, or alternatively, may be passively adsorbed to the surface of the implantable device. In certain other embodiments, the inventive compounds may be formulated to be contained within, or, adapted to release by a surgical or medical device or implant, such as, for example, stents, sutures, indwelling catheters, prosthesis, and the like. Accordingly, without wishing to be bound to any particular theory, the inventive compounds having antiproliferative effects can be used as stent coatings and/or in stent drug delivery devices, inter alia for the prevention of restenosis or reduction of restenosis rate. Suitable coatings and the general preparation of coated implantable devices are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,099,562; 5,886,026; and 5,304,121; each of which is incorporated herein by reference. The coatings are typically biocompatible polymeric materials such as a hydrogel polymer, polymethyldisiloxane. polycaprolactone, polyethylene glycol, polylactic acid, ethylene vinyl acetate, and mixtures thereof. The coatings may optionally be further covered by a suitable topcoat of fluorosilicone, polysaccarides, polyethylene glycol, phospholipids or combinations thereof to impart controlled release characteristics in the composition. A variety of compositions and methods related to stent coating and/or local stent drug delivery for preventing restenosis are known in the art (see, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,517,889; 6,273,913; 6,258,121; 6,251,136; 6,248,127; 6,231,600; 6,203,551; 6,153,252; 6,071,305; 5,891,507; 5,837,313 and published U.S. patent application No.: US2001/0027340, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). For example, stents may be coated with polymer-drug conjugates by dipping the stent in polymer-drug solution or spraying the stent with such a solution. In certain embodiments, suitable materials for the implantable device include biocompatible and nontoxic materials, and may be chosen from the metals such as nickel-titanium alloys, steel, or biocompatible polymers, hydrogels, polyurethanes, polyethylenes, ethylenevinyl acetate copolymers, etc. In certain embodiments, the inventive compound is coated onto a stent for insertion into an artery or vein following balloon angioplasty.\n\n\nThe compounds of this invention or pharmaceutically acceptable compositions thereof may also be incorporated into compositions for coating implantable medical devices, such as prostheses, artificial valves, vascular grafts, stents and catheters. Accordingly, the present invention, in another aspect, includes a composition for coating an implantable device comprising a compound of the present invention as described generally above, and a carrier suitable for coating said implantable device. In still another aspect, the present invention includes an implantable device coated with a composition comprising a compound of the present invention as described generally above, and a carrier suitable for coating said implantable device.\n\n\nWithin other aspects of the present invention, methods are provided for expanding the lumen of a body passageway, comprising inserting a stent into the passageway, the stent having a generally tubular structure, the surface of the structure being coated with (or otherwise adapted to release) an inventive compound or composition, such that the passageway is expanded. In certain embodiments, the lumen of a body passageway is expanded in order to eliminate a biliary, gastrointestinal, esophageal, tracheal/bronchial, urethral and/or vascular obstruction.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the invention provides a method of treatment of any of the disorders described herein, wherein the subject is a human.\n\n\nIn accordance with the foregoing, the present invention further provides a method for preventing or treating any of the diseases or disorders described above in a subject in need of such treatment, which method comprises administering to said subject a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. For any of the above uses, the required dosage will vary depending on the mode of administration, the particular condition to be treated and the effect desired.\n\n\nPharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable ester, salt, or prodrug thereof, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\nCompounds of the invention can be administered as pharmaceutical compositions by any conventional route, in particular enterally, e.g., orally, e.g., in the form of tablets or capsules, or parenterally, e.g., in the form of injectable solutions or suspensions, topically, e.g., in the form of lotions, gels, ointments or creams, or in a nasal or suppository form. Pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of the present invention in free form or in a pharmaceutically acceptable salt form in association with at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent can be manufactured in a conventional manner by mixing, granulating or coating methods. For example, oral compositions can be tablets or gelatin capsules comprising the active ingredient together with a) diluents, e.g., lactose, dextrose, sucrose, mannitol, sorbitol, cellulose and/or glycine; b) lubricants, e.g., silica, talcum, stearic acid, its magnesium or calcium salt and/or polyethyleneglycol; for tablets also c) binders, e.g., magnesium aluminum silicate, starch paste, gelatin, tragacanth, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose and or polyvinylpyrrolidone; if desired d) disintegrants, e.g., starches, agar, alginic acid or its sodium salt, or effervescent mixtures; and/or e) absorbents, colorants, flavors and sweeteners. Injectable compositions can be aqueous isotonic solutions or suspensions, and suppositories can be prepared from fatty emulsions or suspensions. The compositions may be sterilized and/or contain adjuvants, such as preserving, stabilizing, wetting or emulsifying agents, solution promoters, salts for regulating the osmotic pressure and/or buffers. In addition, they may also contain other therapeutically valuable substances. Suitable formulations for transdermal applications include an effective amount of a compound of the present invention with a carrier. A carrier can include absorbable pharmacologically acceptable solvents to assist passage through the skin of the host. For example, transdermal devices are in the form of a bandage comprising a backing member, a reservoir containing the compound optionally with carriers, optionally a rate controlling barrier to deliver the compound to the skin of the host at a controlled and predetermined rate over a prolonged period of time, and means to secure the device to the skin. Matrix transdermal formulations may also be used. Suitable formulations for topical application, e.g., to the skin and eyes, are preferably aqueous solutions, ointments, creams or gels well-known in the art. Such may contain solubilizers, stabilizers, tonicity enhancing agents, buffers and preservatives.\n\n\nCompounds of the invention can be administered in therapeutically effective amounts in combination with one or more therapeutic agents (pharmaceutical combinations). For example, synergistic effects can occur with other anti-proliferative, anti-cancer, immunomodulatory or anti-inflammatory substances. Where the compounds of the invention are administered in conjunction with other therapies, dosages of the co-administered compounds will of course vary depending on the type of co-drug employed, on the specific drug employed, on the condition being treated and so forth.\n\n\nCombination therapy includes the administration of the subject compounds in further combination with other biologically active ingredients (such as, but not limited to, a second and different antineoplastic agent) and non-drug therapies (such as, but not limited to, surgery or radiation treatment). For instance, the compounds of the invention can be used in combination with other pharmaceutically active compounds, preferably compounds that are able to enhance the effect of the compounds of the invention. The compounds of the invention can be administered simultaneously (as a single preparation or separate preparation) or sequentially to the other drug therapy. In general, a combination therapy envisions administration of two or more drugs during a single cycle or course of therapy.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, these compositions optionally further comprise one or more additional therapeutic agents. Alternatively, a compound of this invention may be administered to a patient in need thereof in combination with the administration of one or more other therapeutic agents. For example, additional therapeutic agents for conjoint administration or inclusion in a pharmaceutical composition with a compound of this invention may be an approved chemotherapeutic agent, or it may be any one of a number of agents undergoing approval in the Food and Drug Administration that ultimately obtain approval for the treatment of protozoal infections and/or any disorder associated with cellular hyperproliferation. In certain other embodiments, the additional therapeutic agent is an anticancer agent, as discussed in more detail herein. In certain other embodiments, the compositions of the invention are useful for the treatment of protozoal infections. In the treatment of cancer or protein degradation disorders, the inventive compound may be combined with a proteasome inhibitor (e.g., bortezomib, R1 15777 FTI, MG132, NPI-0052, etc.). In the treatment of cancer or protein degradation disorders, the inventive compound may be combined with protein degradation inhibitor (e.g. another inventive compound, a tubacin-like compound, bortezomib, R1 15777FTI, MG1 32, NPI-0052, SAHA, \n166\nHo-DOTMP, arsenic trioxide, 17-AAG, MG 132, etc.).\n\n\nIt will also be appreciated that the compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be employed in combination therapies, that is, the compounds and pharmaceutical compositions can be administered concurrently with, prior to, or subsequent to, one or more other desired therapeutics or medical procedures. The particular combination of therapies (therapeutics or procedures) to employ in a combination regimen will take into account compatibility of the desired therapeutics and/or procedures and the desired therapeutic effect to be achieved. It will also be appreciated that the therapies employed may achieve a desired effect for the same disorder (for example, an inventive compound may be administered concurrently with another anticancer agent), or they may achieve different effects (e.g., control of any adverse effects).\n\n\nThe present invention encompasses pharmaceutically acceptable topical formulations of inventive compounds. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable topical formulation,” as used herein, means any formulation which is pharmaceutically acceptable for intradermal administration of a compound of the invention by application of the formulation to the epidermis. In certain embodiments of the invention, the topical formulation comprises a carrier system. Pharmaceutically effective carriers include, but are not limited to, solvents {e.g., alcohols, poly alcohols, water), creams, lotions, ointments, oils, plasters, liposomes, powders, emulsions, microemulsions, and buffered solutions (e.g., hypotonic or buffered saline) or any other carrier known in the art for topically administering pharmaceuticals. A more complete listing of art-known carriers is provided by reference texts that are standard in the art, for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 16th Edition, 1980 and 17th Edition, 1985, both published by Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. In certain other embodiments, the topical formulations of the invention may comprise excipients. Any pharmaceutically acceptable excipient known in the art may be used to prepare the inventive pharmaceutically acceptable topical formulations. Examples of excipients that can be included in the topical formulations of the invention include, but are not limited to, preservatives, antioxidants, moisturizers, emollients, buffering agents, solubilizing agents, other penetration agents, skin protectants, surfactants, and propellants, and/or additional therapeutic agents used in combination to the inventive compound. Suitable preservatives include, but are not limited to, alcohols, quaternary amines, organic acids, parabens, and phenols. Suitable antioxidants include, but are not limited to, ascorbic acid and its esters, sodium bisulfite, butylated hydroxytoluene, butylated hydroxyanisole, tocopherols, and chelating agents like EDTA and citric acid. Suitable moisturizers include, but are not limited to, glycerine, sorbitol, polyethylene glycols, urea, and propylene glycol. Suitable buffering agents for use with the invention include, but are not limited to, citric, hydrochloric, and lactic acid buffers.

Suitable skin protectants that can be used in the topical formulations of the invention include, but are not limited to, vitamin E oil, allatoin, dimethicone, glycerin, petrolatum, and zinc oxide.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the pharmaceutically acceptable topical formulations of the invention comprise at least a compound of the invention and a penetration enhancing agent. The choice of topical formulation will depend or several factors, including the condition to be treated, the physicochemical characteristics of the inventive compound and other excipients present, their stability in the formulation, available manufacturing equipment, and costs constraints. As used herein the term “penetration enhancing agent” means an agent capable of transporting a pharmacologically active compound through the stratum corneum and into the epidermis or dermis, preferably, with little or no systemic absorption. A wide variety of compounds have been evaluated as to their effectiveness in enhancing the rate of penetration of drugs through the skin. See, for example, Percutaneous Penetration Enhancers, Maibach H. I. and Smith H. E. (eds.), CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, Fla. (1995), which surveys the use and testing of various skin penetration enhancers, and Buyuktimkin et ah, Chemical Means of Transdermal Drug Permeation Enhancement in Transdermal and Topical Drug Delivery Systems, Gosh T. K., Pfister W. R., Yum S. I. (Eds.), Interpharm Press Inc., Buffalo Grove, IU. (1997). In certain exemplary embodiments, penetration agents for use with the invention include, but are not limited to, triglycerides (e.g., soybean oil), aloe compositions (e.g., aloe-vera gel), ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, octolyphenylpolyethylene glycol, oleic acid, polyethylene glycol 400, propylene glycol, N-decylmethylsulfoxide. fatty acid esters (e.g., isopropyl myristate, methyl laurate, glycerol monooleate, and propylene glycol monooleate) and N-methylpyrrolidine.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the compositions may be in the form of ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, powders, solutions, sprays, inhalants or patches. In certain exemplary embodiments, formulations of the compositions according to the invention are creams, which may further contain saturated or unsaturated fatty acids such as stearic acid, palmitic acid, oleic acid, palmito-oleic acid, cetyl or oleyl alcohols, stearic acid being particularly preferred. Creams of the invention may also contain a non-ionic surfactant, for example, polyoxy-40-stearate. In certain embodiments, the active component is admixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives or buffers as may be required. Ophthalmic formulation, eardrops, and eye drops are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention. Additionally, the present invention contemplates the use of transdermal patches, which have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of a compound to the body. Such dosage forms are made by dissolving or dispensing the compound in the proper medium. As discussed above, penetration enhancing agents can also be used to increase the flux of the compound across the skin. The rate can be controlled by either providing a rate controlling membrane or by dispersing the compound in a polymer matrix or gel.\n\n\nIt will also be appreciated that the compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be formulated and employed in combination therapies, that is, the compounds and pharmaceutical compositions can be formulated with or administered concurrently with, prior to, or subsequent to, one or more other desired therapeutics or medical procedures. The particular combination of therapies (therapeutics or procedures) to employ in a combination regimen will take into account compatibility of the desired therapeutics and/or procedures and the desired therapeutic effect to be achieved. It will also be appreciated that the therapies employed may achieve a desired effect for the same disorder (for example, an inventive compound may be administered concurrently with another immunomodulatory agent, anticancer agent or agent useful for the treatment of psoriasis), or they may achieve different effects (e.g., control of any adverse effects).\n\n\nFor example, other therapies or anticancer agents that may be used in combination with the inventive compounds of the present invention include, but not limited to, surgery, radiotherapy (in but a few examples, gamma-radiation, neutron beam radiotherapy, electron beam radiotherapy, proton therapy, brachytherapy, and systemic radioactive isotopes, to name a few), endocrine therapy, biologic response modifiers (interferons, interleukins, antibodies, aptamers, siRNAs, oligonucletoides, enzyme, ion channel and receptor inhibitors or activators to name a-few), hyperthermia and cryotherapy, agents to attenuate any adverse effects (e.g., antiemetics), and other approved chemotherapeutic drugs, including, but not limited to, alkylating drugs (e.g., mechlorethamine, chlorambucil, Cyclophosphamide, Melphalan, Ifosfamide), antimetabolites (e.g., Methotrexate), purine antagonists and pyrimidine antagonists (e.g., 6-Mercaptopurine, 5-Fluorouracil, Cytarabile, Gemcitabine), spindle poisons (e.g., Vinblastine, Vincristine, Vinorelbine, Paclitaxel), podophyllotoxins (e.g., Etoposide, Irinotecan, Topotecan), antibiotics (Doxorubicin, Bleomycin, Mitomycin), nitrosoureas (e.g., Carmustine, Lomustine), inorganic ions (e.g., Cisplatin, Carboplatin), enzymes (e.g., Asparaginase), and hormones (e.g., Tamoxifen, Leuprolide, Flutamide, and Megestrol), to name a few. For a more comprehensive discussion of updated cancer therapies see, The Merck Manual, Seventeenth Ed. 1999, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. See also the National Cancer Institute (CNI) website (www.nci.nih.gov) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website for a list of the FDA approved oncology drugs (www.fda.gov/cder/cancer/dmglistfrarne).\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention further comprise one or more additional therapeutically active ingredients (e.g., chemotherapeutic and/or palliative). For purposes of the invention, the term “palliative” refers to treatment that is focused on the relief of symptoms of a disease and/or side effects of a therapeutic regimen, but is not curative. For example, palliative treatment encompasses painkillers, antinausea medications, anti-pyretics, and anti-sickness drugs. In addition, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery can all be used palliatively (that is, to reduce symptoms without going for cure; e.g., for shrinking tumors and reducing pressure, bleeding, pain and other symptoms of cancer).\n\n\nThe present compounds and compositions can be administered together with hormonal and steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, such as but not limited to, estradiol, conjugated estrogens (e.g., PREMARIN, PREMPRO, AND PREMPHASE), 17 beta estradiol, calcitonin-salmon, levothyroxine, dexamethasone, medroxyprogesterone, prednisone, cortisone, flunisolide, and hydrocortisone; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, such as but not limited to, tramadol, fentanyl, metamizole, ketoprofen, naproxen, nabumetone, ketoralac, tromethamine, loxoprofen, ibuprofen, aspirin, and acetaminophen; anti-TNF-α antibodies, such as infliximab (REMICADE™) and etanercept (ENBREL™).\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the present invention formulated together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. As used herein, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” means a non-toxic, inert solid, semi-solid or liquid filler, diluent, encapsulating material or formulation auxiliary of any type. The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention can be administered to humans and other animals orally, rectally, parenterally, intracisternally, intravaginally, intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders, ointments, or drops), buccally, or as an oral or nasal spray.\n\n\nLiquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethylformamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents.\n\n\nInjectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P. and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid are used in the preparation of injectables.\n\n\nIn order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is often desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle.\n\n\nCompositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non-irritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are solid at ambient temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound.\n\n\nSolid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like.\n\n\nThe active compounds can also be in micro-encapsulated form with one or more excipients as noted above. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings, release controlling coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. In such solid dosage forms the active compound may be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as sucrose, lactose or starch. Such dosage forms may also comprise, as is normal practice, additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g., tableting lubricants and other tableting aids such a magnesium stearate and microcrystalline cellulose. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents.\n\n\nDosage forms for topical or transdermal administration of a compound of this invention include ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, powders, solutions, sprays, inhalants or patches. The active component is admixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives or buffers as may be required. Ophthalmic formulation, ear drops, eye ointments, powders and solutions are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention.\n\n\nThe ointments, pastes, creams and gels may contain, in addition to an active compound of this invention, excipients such as animal and vegetable fats, oils, waxes, paraffins, starch, tragacanth, cellulose derivatives, polyethylene glycols, silicones, bentonites, silicic acid, talc and zinc oxide, or mixtures thereof.\n\n\nPowders and sprays can contain, in addition to the compounds of this invention, excipients such as lactose, talc, silicic acid, aluminum hydroxide, calcium silicates and polyamide powder, or mixtures of these substances. Sprays can additionally contain customary propellants such as chlorofluorohydrocarbons.\n\n\nTransdermal patches have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of a compound to the body. Such dosage forms can be made by dissolving or dispensing the compound in the proper medium. Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase the flux of the compound across the skin. The rate can be controlled by either providing a rate controlling membrane or by dispersing the compound in a polymer matrix or gel.\n\n\nAccording to the methods of treatment of the present invention, disorders are treated or prevented in a subject, such as a human or other animal, by administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention, in such amounts and for such time as is necessary to achieve the desired result. The term “therapeutically effective amount” of a compound of the invention, as used herein, means a sufficient amount of the compound so as to decrease the symptoms of a disorder in a subject. As is well understood in the medical arts a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of this invention will be at a reasonable benefit/risk ratio applicable to any medical treatment.\n\n\nIn general, compounds of the invention will be administered in therapeutically effective amounts via any of the usual and acceptable modes known in the art, either singly or in combination with one or more therapeutic agents. A therapeutically effective amount may vary widely depending on the severity of the disease, the age and relative health of the subject, the potency of the compound used and other factors. In general, satisfactory results are indicated to be obtained systemically at daily dosages of from about 0.03 to 2.5 mg/kg per body weight (0.05 to 4.5 mg/m\n2\n). An indicated daily dosage in the larger mammal, e.g. humans, is in the range from about 0.5 mg to about 100 mg, conveniently administered, e.g. in divided doses up to four times a day or in retard form. Suitable unit dosage forms for oral administration comprise from ca. 1 to 50 mg active ingredient.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, a therapeutic amount or dose of the compounds of the present invention may range from about 0.1 mg/kg to about 500 mg/kg (about 0.18 mg/m\n2 \nto about 900 mg/m\n2\n), alternatively from about 1 to about 50 mg/kg (about 1.8 to about 90 mg/m\n2\n). In general, treatment regimens according to the present invention comprise administration to a patient in need of such treatment from about 10 mg to about 1000 mg of the compound(s) of this invention per day in single or multiple doses. Therapeutic amounts or doses will also vary depending on route of administration, as well as the possibility of co-usage with other agents.\n\n\nUpon improvement of a subject's condition, a maintenance dose of a compound, composition or combination of this invention may be administered, if necessary. Subsequently, the dosage or frequency of administration, or both, may be reduced, as a function of the symptoms, to a level at which the improved condition is retained when the symptoms have been alleviated to the desired level, treatment should cease. The subject may, however, require intermittent treatment on a long-term basis upon any recurrence of disease symptoms.\n\n\nIt will be understood, however, that the total daily usage of the compounds and compositions of the present invention will be decided by the attending physician within the scope of sound medical judgment. The specific inhibitory dose for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder; the activity of the specific compound employed; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion of the specific compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or coincidental with the specific compound employed; and like factors well known in the medical arts.\n\n\nThe invention also provides for a pharmaceutical combinations, e.g. a kit, comprising a) a first agent which is a compound of the invention as disclosed herein, in free form or in pharmaceutically acceptable salt form, and b) at least one co-agent. The kit can comprise instructions for its administration to a subject suffering from or susceptible to a disease or disorder.\n\n\nThe terms “co-administration” or “combined administration” or the like as utilized herein are meant to encompass administration of the selected therapeutic agents to a single patient, and are intended to include treatment regimens in which the agents are not necessarily administered by the same route of administration or at the same time.\n\n\nThe term “pharmaceutical combination” as used herein means a product that results from the mixing or combining of more than one active ingredient and includes both fixed and non-fixed combinations of the active ingredients. The term “fixed combination” means that the active ingredients, e.g., a compound of the invention and a co-agent, are both administered to a patient simultaneously in the form of a single entity or dosage. The term “non-fixed combination” means that the active ingredients, e.g., a compound of the invention and a co-agent, are both administered to a patient as separate entities either simultaneously, concurrently or sequentially with no specific time limits, wherein such administration provides therapeutically effective levels of the two compounds in the body of the patient. The latter also applies to cocktail therapy, e.g., the administration of three or more active ingredients.\n\n\nSome examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include, but are not limited to, ion exchangers, alumina, aluminum stearate, lecithin, serum proteins, such as human serum albumin, buffer substances such as phosphates, glycine, sorbic acid, or potassium sorbate, partial glyceride mixtures of saturated vegetable fatty acids, water, salts or electrolytes, such as protamine sulfate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, potassium hydrogen phosphate, sodium chloride, zinc salts, colloidal silica, magnesium trisilicate, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyacrylates, waxes, polyethylene-polyoxypropylene-block polymers, wool fat, sugars such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; starches such as corn starch and potato starch; cellulose and its derivatives such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; powdered tragacanth; malt; gelatin; talc; excipients such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes, oils such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil; safflower oil; sesame oil; olive oil; corn oil and soybean oil; glycols; such a propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol; esters such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate, agar; buffering agents such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; alginic acid; pyrogen-free water, isotonic saline; Ringer's solution; ethyl alcohol, and phosphate buffer solutions, as well as other non-toxic compatible lubricants such as sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate, as well as coloring agents, releasing agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the composition, according to the judgment of the formulator. The protein kinase inhibitors or pharmaceutical salts thereof may be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions for administration to animals or humans. These pharmaceutical compositions, which comprise an amount of the protein inhibitor effective to treat or prevent a protein kinase-mediated condition and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, are another embodiment of the present invention.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nThe compounds and processes of the present invention will be better understood in connection with the following examples, which are intended as an illustration only and not to limit the scope of the invention. Various changes and modifications to the disclosed embodiments will be apparent to those skilled in the art and such changes and modifications including, without limitation, those relating to the chemical structures, substituents, derivatives, formulations and/or methods of the invention may be made without departing from the spirit of the invention and the scope of the appended claims.
