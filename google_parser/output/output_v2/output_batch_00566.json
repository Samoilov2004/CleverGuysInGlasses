Description\n\n\n\n\nCROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION\n\n\n \n \n \nThis application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61/109,899, filed Oct. 30, 2008.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThere is provided by the present invention compounds that are serotonin receptor modulators. More particularly, there is provided by the present invention biphenyl compounds that are serotonin receptor modulators useful for the treatment of disease states mediated by serotonin receptor activity.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nSerotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is a major neurotransmitter eliciting effects via a multiplicity of receptors. To date, at least fifteen different 5-HT receptors have been identified, largely as the result of cDNA cloning. These receptors have been grouped into seven families (5-HT\n1 \nthrough 5-HT\n7\n) (Hoyeri, D. et al. \nPharmacol. Biochem. Behav. \n2002, 71, 533-554).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFourteen of the fifteen cloned 5-HT receptors are expressed in the brain. 5-HT is implicated in many disease states, particularly conditions of the central nervous system including; depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, learning and memory dysfunction, migraine, chronic pain, sensory perception, motor activity, temperature regulation, nociception, sexual behavior, hormone secretion, and cognition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe identification of multiple 5-HT receptors has provided the opportunity to characterize existing therapeutic agents thought to act via the serotonergic system. Consequently, this has led to the realization that many drugs have non-selective properties (Roth, B. L. et al. \nNeuroscientist \n2000, 6(4), 252-262). For example, the antipsychotic drugs, clozapine, chlorpromazine, haloperidol and olanzapine exhibit affinities for multiple serotonin receptors in addition to other families of receptors. Similar behavior has been noted for antidepressants including imipramine, nortriptaline, fluoxetine and sertraline. Similarly, the anti-migraine agent sumatriptan exhibits high affinity for several serotonin receptors. While the lack of selectivity often contributes to a favorable therapeutic outcome, it can also cause undesirable and dose-limiting side effects (Stahl, S. M. \nEssential Psychopharmacology, \n2\nnd \ned., Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, U.K., 2000). For example, the inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine uptake together with 5-HT\n2 \nreceptor blockade is responsible for the therapeutic effects of the tricyclic antidepressants. In contrast, their blockade of histamine H\n1\n, muscarinic and alpha-adrenergic receptors can lead to sedation, blurred vision and orthostatic hypertension respectively. Likewise, the atypical antipsychotics, including olanzapine and clozapine, are considered to have positive therapeutic effects attributable to their actions at 5-HT\n2\n, D\n2 \nand 5-HT\n7 \nreceptors. Conversely, their side effect liability is due to their affinities for a range of dopaminergic, serotonergic and adrenergic receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nElucidating selective ligands has the potential to ameliorate untoward pharmacologies and provide novel efficacious therapies. More importantly, the ability to obtain compounds which portray receptor selectivity provides the prospect to target distinct therapeutic mechanisms and improve clinical responses with a single drug. Consequently, there remains a need for potent serotonin receptor modulators with desirable pharmaceutical properties.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nCertain biphenyl derivatives have now been found to have 5HT\n7 \nmodulating activity.

For the sake of brevity, the disclosures of the publications, including patents, cited in this specification are herein incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “including”, “containing” and “comprising” are used herein in their open, non-limiting sense.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “alkyl” refers to a straight- or branched-chain alkyl group having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms in the chain. Examples of alkyl groups include methyl (Me, which may also be structurally depicted by a bond, “/”), ethyl (Et), n-propyl (Pr), isopropyl (iPr), butyl (nBu), isobutyl (iBu), sec-butyl (sBu), tert-butyl (tBu), pentyl, isopentyl, tert-pentyl, hexyl, isohexyl, and groups that in light of the ordinary skill in the art and the teachings provided herein would be considered equivalent to any one of the foregoing examples.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “cycloalkyl” refers to a saturated or partially saturated, monocyclic, fused polycyclic, or spiro polycyclic carbocycle having from 3 to 12 ring atoms per carbocycle. Illustrative examples of cycloalkyl groups include the following entities (depicted without their bonds of attachment):\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “heterocycloalkyl” refers to a monocyclic, or fused, bridged, or spiro polycyclic ring structure that is saturated or partially saturated and has from 3 to 12 ring atoms per ring structure selected from carbon atoms and up to three heteroatoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. The ring structure may optionally contain up to two oxo groups on carbon or sulfur ring members. Illustrative examples (depicted without their bonds of attachment) include:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “heteroaryl” refers to a monocyclic, fused bicyclic, or fused polycyclic aromatic heterocycle (ring structure having ring atoms selected from carbon atoms and up to four heteroatoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur) having from 3 to 12 ring atoms per heterocycle. Illustrative examples of heteroaryl groups include the following entities (depicted without their bonds of attachment):\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThose skilled in the art will recognize that the species of cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, and heteroaryl groups listed or illustrated above are not exhaustive, and that additional species within the scope of these defined terms may also be selected.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “halogen” represents chlorine, fluorine, bromine or iodine. The term “halo” represents chloro, fluoro, bromo or iodo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “substituted” means that the specified group or moiety bears one or more substituents. The term “unsubstituted” means that the specified group bears no substituents. The term “optionally substituted” means that the specified group is unsubstituted or substituted by one or more substituents. Where the term “substituted” is used to describe a structural system, the substitution is meant to occur at any valency-allowed position on the system. In cases where a specified moiety or group is not expressly noted as being optionally substituted or substituted with any specified substituent, it is understood that such a moiety or group is intended to be unsubstituted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny formula given herein is intended to represent compounds having structures depicted by the structural formulae as well as certain variations or forms. In particular, compounds of any formula given herein may have asymmetric centers and therefore exist in different enantiomeric forms. It is understood that some compounds referred to herein are chiral and/or have geometric isomeric centers, for example E- and Z-isomers. All optical isomers and stereoisomers of the compounds of any general structural formula, and mixtures thereof, are considered within the scope of the formulae. Thus, any general formula given herein is intended to represent a racemate, one or more enantiomeric forms, one or more diastereomeric forms, one or more atropisomeric forms, and mixtures thereof. Furthermore, certain structures may exist as geometric isomers (i.e., cis and trans isomers), as tautomers, or as atropisomers. Additionally, any general formula given herein is intended to embrace hydrates, solvates, and polymorphs of such compounds, and mixtures thereof. Furthermore, certain compounds referred to herein can exist in solvated as well as unsolvated forms. It is understood that this invention encompasses all such solvated and unsolvated forms that possess the activity that characterizes the compounds of this invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another example, a zwitterionic compound is encompassed herein by referring to a compound that is known to form a zwitterion, even if it is not explicitly named in its zwitterionic form. Terms such as zwitterion, zwitterions, and their synonyms zwitterionic compound(s) are standard IUPAC-endorsed names that are well known and part of standard sets of defined scientific names. In this regard, the name zwitterion is assigned the name identification CHEBI:27369 by the Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) dictionary of molecular entities. As generally well known, a zwitterion or zwitterionic compound is a neutral compound that has formal unit charges of opposite sign. Sometimes these compounds are referred to by the term “inner salts”. Other sources refer to these compounds as “dipolar ions”, although the latter term is regarded by still other sources as a misnomer. As a specific example, aminoethanoic acid (the amino acid glycine) has the formula H\n2\nNCH\n2\nCOOH, and it exists in some media (in this case in neutral media) in the form of the zwitterion \n+\nH\n3\nNCH\n2\nCOO\n−\n. Zwitterions, zwitterionic compounds, inner salts and dipolar ions in the known and well established meanings of these terms are within the scope of this invention, as would in any case be so appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art. Because there is no need to name each and every embodiment that would be recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art, no structures of the zwitterionic compounds that are associated with the compounds of this invention are given explicitly herein. They are, however, part of the embodiments of this invention. No further examples in this regard are provided herein because the interactions and transformations in a given medium that lead to the various forms of a given compound are known by any one of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny general formula given herein is also intended to represent unlabeled forms as well as isotopically labeled forms of the compounds. Isotopically labeled compounds have structures of the formulas given herein except that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having a selected atomic mass or mass number. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine, chlorine, and iodine, such as \n2\nH, \n3\nH, \n11\nC, \n13\nC, \n14\nC, \n15\nN, \n18\nO, \n17\nO, \n31\nP, \n32\nP, \n35\nS, \n18\nF, \n36\nCl, and \n125\nI, respectively. Such isotopically labeled compounds are useful in metabolic studies (preferably with \n14\nC), reaction kinetic studies (with, for example \n2\nH or \n3\nH), detection or imaging techniques (such as positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)) including drug or substrate tissue distribution assays, or in radioactive treatment of patients. In particular, an \n18\nF or \n11\nC labeled compound may be particularly preferred for PET or SPECT studies. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium (i.e., \n2\nH) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements. Isotopically labeled compounds of this invention and prodrugs thereof can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the schemes or in the examples and preparations described below by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen referring to a formula given herein, the selection of a particular moiety from a list of possible species for a specified variable is not intended to define the moiety for the variable appearing elsewhere. In other words, where a variable appears more than once in a formula, the choice of the species from a specified list is independent of the choice of the species for the same variable elsewhere in the formula unless otherwise indicated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy way of a first example on substituent terminology, if substituent S\n1\n \nexample \nis one of S\n1 \nand S\n2\n, and substituent S\n2\n \nexample \nis one of S\n3 \nand S\n4\n, then these assignments refer to embodiments of this invention given according to the choices S\n1\n \nexample \nis S\n1 \nand S\n2\n \nexample \nis S\n3\n; S\n1\n \nexample \nis S\n1 \nand S\n2\n \nexample \nis S\n4\n; S\n1\n \nexample \nis S\n2 \nand S\n2\n \nexample \nis S\n3\n; S\n1\n \nexample \nis S\n2 \nand S\n2\n \nexample \nis S\n4\n; and equivalents of each one of such choices. The shorter terminology “S\n1\n \nexample \nis one of S\n1 \nand S\n2\n, and S\n2\n \nexample \nis one of S\n3 \nand S\n4\n” is accordingly used herein for the sake of brevity, but not by way of limitation. The foregoing first example on substituent terminology, which is stated in generic terms, is meant to illustrate the various substituent assignments described herein. The foregoing convention given herein for substituents extends, when applicable, to members such as R\n1\n, R\n2\n, A, X\n4\n, X\n5\n, X\n6\n, X\n7\n, R\na\n, R\nb\n, R\nc\n, R\nd\n, R\ne\n, R\nf\n, R\ng\n, R\nh\n, R\ni\n, R\nj\n, R\nk\n, R\nl\n, R\nm\n, and R\no\n, and any other generic substituent symbol used herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, when more than one assignment is given for any member or substituent, embodiments of this invention comprise the various groupings that can be made from the listed assignments, taken independently, and equivalents thereof. By way of a second example on substituent terminology, if it is herein described that substituent S\nexample \nis one of S\n1\n, S\n2\n, and S\n3\n, this listing refers to embodiments of this invention for which S\nexample \nis S\n1\n; S\nexample \nis S\n2\n; S\nexample \nis S\n3\n; S\nexample \nis one of S\n1 \nand S\n2\n; S\nexample \nis one of S\n1 \nand S\n3\n; S\nexample \nis one of S\n2 \nand S\n3\n; S\nexample \nis one of S\n1\n, S\n2 \nand S\n3\n; and S\nexample \nis any equivalent of each one of these choices. The shorter terminology “S\nexample \nis one of S\n1\n, S\n2\n, and S\n3\n” is accordingly used herein for the sake of brevity, but not by way of limitation. The foregoing second example on substituent terminology, which is stated in generic terms, is meant to illustrate the various substituent assignments described herein. The foregoing convention given herein for substituents extends, when applicable, to members such as as R\n1\n, R\n2\n, A, X\n4\n, X\n5\n, X\n6\n, X\n7\n, R\na\n, R\nb\n, R\nc\n, R\nd\n, R\ne\n, R\nf\n, R\ng\n, R\nh\n, R\ni\n, R\nj\n, R\nk\n, R\nl\n, R\nm\n, and R\no\n, and any other generic substituent symbol used herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nomenclature “C\n1-j\n” with j>i, when applied herein to a class of substituents, is meant to refer to embodiments of this invention for which each and every one of the number of carbon members, from i to j including i and j, is independently realized. By way of example, the term C\n1-3 \nrefers independently to embodiments that have one carbon member (C\n1\n) embodiments that have two carbon members (C\n2\n), and embodiments that have three carbon members (C\n3\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term C\nn-m\nalkyl refers to an aliphatic chain, whether straight or branched, with a total number N of carbon members in the chain that satisfies n≦N≦m, with m>n. Any disubstituent referred to herein is meant to encompass the various attachment possibilities when more than one of such possibilities are allowed. For example, reference to disubstituent -A−B-, where A≠B, refers herein to such disubstituent with A attached to a first substituted member and B attached to a second substituted member, and it also refers to such disubstituent with A attached to the second substituted member and B attached to the first substituted member.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of Formulae (I) and (II) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs, and pharmaceutically active metabolites of the present invention are useful as serotonin receptor modulators in the methods of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” is intended to mean a salt of a free acid or base of a compound represented by Formulae (I) or (II), that is non-toxic, biologically tolerable, or otherwise biologically suitable for administration to the subject. See, generally, G. S. Paulekuhn, et al., “Trends in Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient Salt Selection based on Analysis of the Orange Book Database”, \nJ. Med. Chem., \n2007, 50:6665-72, S. M. Berge, et al., “Pharmaceutical Salts”, \nJ Pharm Sci., \n1977, 66:1-19, and \nHandbook of Pharmaceutical Salts, Properties, Selection, and Use\n, Stahl and Wermuth, Eds., Wiley-VCH and VHCA, Zurich, 2002. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are those that are pharmacologically effective and suitable for contact with the tissues of patients without undue toxicity, irritation, or allergic response. A compound of Formulae (I) or (II) may possess a sufficiently acidic group, a sufficiently basic group, or both types of functional groups, and accordingly react with a number of inorganic or organic bases, and inorganic and organic acids, to form a pharmaceutically acceptable salt.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include sulfates, pyrosulfates, bisulfates, sulfites, bisulfites, phosphates, monohydrogen-phosphates, dihydrogenphosphates, metaphosphates, pyrophosphates, chlorides, bromides, iodides, acetates, propionates, decanoates, caprylates, acrylates, formates, isobutyrates, caproates, heptanoates, propiolates, oxalates, malonates, succinates, suberates, sebacates, fumarates, maleates, butyne-1,4-dioates, hexyne-1,6-dioates, benzoates, chlorobenzoates, methyl benzoates, dinitrobenzoates, hydroxybenzoates, methoxybenzoates, phthalates, sulfonates, xylenesulfonates, phenylacetates, phenylpropionates, phenyl butyrates, citrates, lactates, γ-hydroxybutyrates, glycolates, tartrates, methane-sulfonates, propanesulfonates, naphthalene-1-sulfonates, naphthalene-2-sulfonates, and mandelates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the compound of Formulae (I) or (II) contains a basic nitrogen, the desired pharmaceutically acceptable salt may be prepared by any suitable method available in the art, for example, treatment of the free base with an inorganic acid, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, sulfamic acid, nitric acid, boric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like, or with an organic acid, such as acetic acid, phenylacetic acid, propionic acid, stearic acid, lactic acid, ascorbic acid, maleic acid, hydroxymaleic acid, isethionic acid, succinic acid, valeric acid, fumaric acid, malonic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, glycolic acid, salicylic acid, oleic acid, palmitic acid, lauric acid, a pyranosidyl acid, such as glucuronic acid or galacturonic acid, an alpha-hydroxy acid, such as mandelic acid, citric acid, or tartaric acid, an amino acid, such as aspartic acid, glutaric acidor glutamic acid, an aromatic acid, such as benzoic acid, 2-acetoxybenzoic acid, naphthoic acid, or cinnamic acid, a sulfonic acid, such as laurylsulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, any compatible mixture of acids such as those given as examples herein, and any other acid and mixture thereof that are regarded as equivalents or acceptable substitutes in light of the ordinary level of skill in this technology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the compound of Formulae (I) or (II) is an acid, such as a carboxylic acid or sulfonic acid, the desired pharmaceutically acceptable salt may be prepared by any suitable method, for example, treatment of the free acid with an inorganic or organic base, such as an amine (primary, secondary or tertiary), an alkali metal hydroxide, alkaline earth metal hydroxide, any compatible mixture of bases such as those given as examples herein, and any other base and mixture thereof that are regarded as equivalents or acceptable substitutes in light of the ordinary level of skill in this technology. Illustrative examples of suitable salts include organic salts derived from amino acids, such as N-methyl-D-glucamine, lysine, choline, glycine and arginine, ammonia, carbonates, bicarbonates, primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, and cyclic amines, such as tromethamine, benzylamines, pyrrolidines, piperidine, morpholine, and piperazine, and inorganic salts derived from sodium, calcium, potassium, magnesium, manganese, iron, copper, zinc, aluminum, and lithium.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also relates to pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs of the compounds of Formulae (I) or (II), and treatment methods employing such pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs. The term “prodrug” means a precursor of a designated compound that, following administration to a subject, yields the compound in vivo via a chemical or physiological process such as solvolysis or enzymatic cleavage, or under physiological conditions (e.g., a prodrug on being brought to physiological pH is converted to the compound of Formulae (I) or (II). A “pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug” is a prodrug that is non-toxic, biologically tolerable, and otherwise biologically suitable for administration to the subject. Illustrative procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable prodrug derivatives are described, for example, in “\nDesign of Prodrugs\n”, ed. H. Bundgaard, Elsevier, 1985.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary prodrugs include compounds having an amino acid residue, or a polypeptide chain of two or more (e.g., two, three or four) amino acid residues, covalently joined through an amide or ester bond to a free amino, hydroxy, or carboxylic acid group of a compound of Formulae (I) or (II). Examples of amino acid residues include the twenty naturally occurring amino acids, commonly designated by three letter symbols, as well as 4-hydroxyproline, hydroxylysine, demosine, isodemosine, 3-methylhistidine, norvalin, beta-alanine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, citrulline homocysteine, homoserine, ornithine and methionine sulfone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional types of prodrugs may be produced, for instance, by derivatizing free carboxyl groups of structures of Formulae (I) or (II) as amides or alkyl esters. Representative pharmaceutically acceptable amides of the invention include those derived from ammonia, primary C\n1-6 \nalkyl amines and secondary di(C\n1-6\nalkyl) amines. Secondary amines include 5- or 6-membered heterocyclic or heteroaromatic ring moieties containing at least one nitrogen atom and optionally between 1 and 2 additional heteroatoms. Preferred amides are derived from ammonia, C\n1-3\nalkyl primary amines, and di(C\n1-2\nalkyl)amines. Representative pharmaceutically acceptable esters of the invention include C\n1-7\nalkyl, C\n5-7\ncycloalkyl, phenyl, and phenyl(C\n1-6\n)alkyl esters. Preferred esters include methyl esters. Prodrugs may also be prepared by derivatizing free hydroxy groups using groups including hemisuccinates, phosphate esters, dimethylaminoacetates, and phosphoryloxymethyloxycarbonyls, following procedures such as those outlined in Fleisher et al., \nAdv. Drug Delivery Rev. \n1996, 19, 115-130. Carbamate derivatives of hydroxy and amino groups may also yield prodrugs. Carbonate derivatives, sulfonate esters, and sulfate esters of hydroxy groups may also provide prodrugs. Derivatization of hydroxy groups as (acyloxy)methyl and (acyloxy)ethyl ethers, wherein the acyl group may be an alkyl ester, optionally substituted with one or more ether, amine, or carboxylic acid functionalities, or where the acyl group is an amino acid ester as described above, is also useful to yield prodrugs. Prodrugs of this type may be prepared as described in Robinson et al., \nJ Med. Chem. \n1996, 39 (1), 10-18. Free amines can also be derivatized as amides, sulfonamides or phosphonamides. All of these prodrug moieties may incorporate groups including ether, amine, and carboxylic acid functionalities.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also relates to pharmaceutically active metabolites of the compounds of Formulae (I) or (II), which may also be used in the methods of the invention. A “pharmaceutically active metabolite” means a pharmacologically active product of metabolism in the body of a compound of Formulae (I) or (II) or salt thereof. Prodrugs and active metabolites of a compound may be determined using routine techniques known or available in the art. See, e.g., Bertolini, et al., \nJ Med. Chem. \n1997, 40, 2011-2016; Shan, et al., \nJ Pharm Sci. \n1997, 86 (7), 765-767; Bagshawe, \nDrug Dev Res. \n1995, 34, 220-230; Bodor, \nAdv Drug Res. \n1984, 13, 224-331; Bundgaard, \nDesign of Prodrugs \n(Elsevier Press, 1985); and Larsen, \nDesign and Application of Prodrugs, Drug Design and Development \n(Krogsgaard-Larsen, et al., eds., Harwood Academic Publishers, 1991).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of Formulae (I) or (II) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs, and pharmaceutically active metabolites of the present invention are useful as modulators of the seratonin receptor in the methods of the invention. As such modulators, the compounds may act as antagonists, agonists, or inverse agonists. The term “modulators” include both inhibitors and activators, where “inhibitors” refer to compounds that decrease, prevent, inactivate, desensitize or down-regulate seratonin receptor expression or activity, and “activators” are compounds that increase, activate, facilitate, sensitize, or up-regulate seratonin receptor expression or activity. Many of the compounds of the present invention are 5-HT\n7 \nmodulators that act as 5-HT\n7 \nagonists. As such, the compounds are useful in the treatment of 5-HT\n7\n-mediated disease in which an increase, induction, activation or up-regulation of serotonin receptor expression or activity is required.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “treat” or “treating” as used herein is intended to refer to administration of an active agent or composition of the invention to a subject for the purpose of effecting a therapeutic or prophylactic benefit through modulation of serotonin receptor activity. Treating includes reversing, ameliorating, alleviating, inhibiting the progress of, lessening the severity of, or preventing a disease, disorder, or condition, or one or more symptoms of such disease, disorder or condition mediated through modulation of serotonin receptor activity. The term “subject” refers to a mammalian patient in need of such treatment, such as a human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn treatment methods according to the invention, an effective amount of a pharmaceutical agent according to the invention is administered to a subject suffering from or diagnosed as having such a disease, disorder, or condition. An “effective amount” means an amount or dose sufficient to generally bring about the desired therapeutic or prophylactic benefit in patients in need of such treatment for the designated disease, disorder, or condition. Effective amounts or doses of the compounds of the present invention may be ascertained by routine methods such as modeling, dose escalation studies or clinical trials, and by taking into consideration routine factors, e.g., the mode or route of administration or drug delivery, the pharmacokinetics of the compound, the severity and course of the disease, disorder, or condition, the subject's previous or ongoing therapy, the subject's health status and response to drugs, and the judgment of the treating physician.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention may be particularly useful in the treatment or prevention of diseases, disorders, or conditions mediated by serotonin receptor activity, such as: central nervous system disorders such as sleep disorders (including insomnia), depression/anxiety, generalized anxiety disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, cognitive disorders, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, psychotic disorders, phobic disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, mood disorders, post-traumatic stress and other stress-related disorders, migraine, pain, eating disorders, obesity, sexual dysfunction, metabolic disturbances, hormonal imbalance, hot flashes associated with menopause, alcohol abuse, drug abuse, and addictive disorders including drug addiction and alcohol addiction. Further diseases associated with serotonin receptor activity for which the compounds may be useful for treating are nausea, inflammation, centrally mediated hypertension, sleep/wake disturbances, jetlag, and circadian rhythm abnormalities. The compounds may also be used in the treatment and prevention of hypotension, peripheral vascular disorders, cardiovascular shock, renal disorders, gastric motility, diarrhea, spastic colon, irritable bowel disorders, ischemias, septic shock, urinary incontinence and other disorders related to the gastrointestinal and vascular systems. In addition, compounds of the present invention may be used in methods for treating or preventing a range of ocular disorders including glaucoma, optic neuritis, diabetic retinopathy, retinal edema, and age-related macular degeneration. Symptoms or disease states are intended to be included within the scope of “medical conditions, disorders, or diseases.”\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention are 5-HT\n7 \nmodulators, many of which are 5-HT\n7 \nagonists. As such, the compounds are useful in the treatment of 5-HT\n7 \nmediated disease states. Where the compounds possess substantial 5-HT\n7 \nmodulating activity, they may be particularly useful in methods for treating depression/anxiety, sleep/wake disturbances, sleep disorders, jet lag, migraine, urinary incontinence, gastric motility, and irritable bowel disorders, hypertension, analgesic, and irritable bowel syndrome.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParticularly, as serotonin receptor modulators, the compounds of the present invention are useful in the treatment or prevention of depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, and circadian rhythm abnormalities.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention are used, alone or in combination with one or more other active ingredients, to formulate pharmaceutical compositions of the invention. In addition, the compounds of the invention may be used in combination with additional active ingredients in the treatment of the above conditions. In an exemplary embodiment, additional active ingredients are those that are known or discovered to be effective in the treatment of conditions, disorders, or diseases mediated by serotonin receptors or that are active against another target associated with the particular condition, disorder, or disease. Suitable examples include: H\n1 \nreceptor antagonists, H\n2 \nreceptor antagonists, H\n3 \nreceptor antagonists, topiramate (TOPAMAX™), and neurotransmitter modulators such as norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (NRIs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), noradrenergic reuptake inhibitors, non-selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (NSSRIs), acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (such as tetrahydroaminoacridine, Donepezil (ARICEPT™), Rivastigmine, or Galantamine (REMINYL™)), modafinil, anti-psychotics, sedatives, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOs), and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). The combination may serve to increase efficacy (e.g., by including in the combination a compound potentiating the potency or effectiveness of a compound according to the invention), decrease one or more side effects, or decrease the required dose of the compound according to the invention. In preferred embodiments, the combination method employs doses containing additional active ingredients in the range of about 20 to 300 mg per dose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA pharmaceutical composition of the invention comprises: (a) an effective amount of a compound of Formulae (I) and (II), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug, or pharmaceutically active metabolite thereof; and (b) a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “pharmaceutically acceptable excipient” refers to a substance that is non-toxic, biologically tolerable, and otherwise biologically suitable for administration to a subject, such as an inert substance, added to a pharmacological composition or otherwise used as a vehicle, carrier, or diluent to facilitate administration of a agent and that is compatible therewith. Examples of excipients include calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, various sugars and types of starch, cellulose derivatives, gelatin, vegetable oils, and polyethylene glycols.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDelivery forms of the pharmaceutical compositions containing one or more dosage units of the active agents may be prepared using suitable pharmaceutical excipients and compounding techniques known or that become available to those skilled in the art. It is anticipated that the compounds of the invention can be administered by oral or parenteral routes, including intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, rectal and topical administration, and inhalation. For oral administration, the compounds of the invention will generally be provided in the form of tablets or capsules or as an aqueous solution or suspension. Tablets for oral use may include the active ingredient mixed with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as inert diluents, disintegrating agents, binding agents, lubricating agents, sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preservatives. Suitable inert diluents include sodium and calcium carbonate, sodium and calcium phosphate and lactose. Cornstarch and alginic acid are suitable disintegrating agents. Binding agents may include starch and gelatin. The lubricating agent, if present, will generally be magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. If desired, the tablets may be coated with a material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate, to delay absorption in the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCapsules for oral administration include hard and soft gelatin capsules. To prepare hard gelatin capsules, compounds of the invention may be mixed with a solid, semi-solid, or liquid diluent. Soft gelatin capsules may be prepared by mixing the compound of the invention with water, an oil such as peanut oil or olive oil, liquid paraffin, a mixture of mono and di-glycerides of short chain fatty acids, polyethylene glycol 400, or propylene glycol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiquids for oral administration may be in the form of suspensions, solutions, emulsions or syrups or may be lyophilized or presented as a dry product for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid compositions may optionally contain: pharmaceutically-acceptable excipients such as suspending agents (for example, sorbitol, methyl cellulose, sodium alginate, gelatin, hydroxyethylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, aluminum stearate gel and the like); non-aqueous vehicles, e.g., oil (for example, almond oil or fractionated coconut oil), propylene glycol, ethyl alcohol, or water; preservatives (for example, methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoate or sorbic acid); wetting agents such as lecithin; and, if desired, flavoring or coloring agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe active agents of this invention may also be administered by non-oral routes. For intramuscular, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous and intravenous use, the compounds of the invention will generally be provided in sterile aqueous solutions or suspensions, buffered to an appropriate pH and isotonicity. Suitable aqueous vehicles include Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride. Aqueous suspensions according to the invention may include suspending agents such as cellulose derivatives, sodium alginate, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone and gum tragacanth, and a wetting agent such as lecithin. Suitable preservatives for aqueous suspensions include ethyl and n-propyl p-hydroxybenzoate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor topical administration, the compounds may be mixed with a pharmaceutical carrier at a concentration of about 0.1% to about 10% of drug to vehicle. Another mode of administering the compounds of the invention may utilize a patch formulation to affect transdermal delivery.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention may alternatively be administered in methods of this invention by inhalation, via the nasal or oral routes, e.g., in a spray formulation also containing a suitable carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEffective doses of the compounds of the present invention may be ascertained by conventional methods. The specific dosage level required for any particular patient will depend on a number of factors, including severity of the condition being treated, the route of administration and the weight of the patient. In general, however, it is anticipated that the daily dose (whether administered as a single dose or as divided doses) will be in the range 0.01 to 1000 mg per day, more usually from 1 to 500 mg per day, and most usually from 10 to 200 mg per day. Expressed as dosage per unit body weight, a typical dose will be expected to be between 0.0001 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg, especially between 0.01 mg/kg and 7 mg/kg, and most especially between 0.15 mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention includes also pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds represented by Formulae (I) or (II), preferably of those described below.

Artisans will recognize that, to obtain the various compounds herein, starting materials may be suitably selected so that the ultimately desired substituents will be carried through the reaction scheme with or without protection as appropriate to yield the desired product. Alternatively, it may be necessary or desirable to employ, in the place of the ultimately desired substituent, a suitable group that may be carried through the reaction scheme and replaced as appropriate with the desired substituent. Unless otherwise specified, the variables in the formulas depicted in the schemes below are as defined above in reference to Formulae (I) and (II). Reactions may be performed between the melting point and the reflux temperature of the solvent, and preferably between 0° C. and the reflux temperature of the solvent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nList of abbreviations: Ac=Acetyl, AIBN=azobisisobutyronitrile, Boc=tert-Butylcarbamoyl, m-CPBA=meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid, DCE=dichloroethane, DEAD=diethyldiazodicarboxylate, DIBAL-H=diisobutyl aluminum hydride, DIEA=N,N-Diisopropylethylamine, DMA=N,N-Dimethylacetamide, DME=Ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, DMF=dimethylformamide, DMSO=Dimethyl sulfoxide, Et\n3\nN=triethylamine, Et\n2\nO=diethyl ether, EtOAc=Ethyl acetate, MeCN=acetonitrile, MeOH=methanol, MsCl=Methanesulfonyl chloride, TFA=trifluoroacetic acid, TFAA=trifluoroacetic acid anhydride, THF=tetrahydrofuran, TLC=thin layer chromatography, Q-Phos=1,2,3,4,5-pentaphenyl-1′-(di-tert-butylphosphino)ferrocene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe biphenyl compounds of formulas (I) and (II) may be prepared by a number of reaction schemes.

A further preferred protecting group is t-butyl carbamate (Boc) or trifluoroacetamide. This protecting group (P\n1\n) on the nitrogen may be removed using generally accepted methods or may be converted directly into compounds of the formula A10. More specifically a group such as a Boc group may be removed with an acid such as trifluoroacetic acid or hydrochloric acid and the like in a solvent such as CH\n2\nCl\n2\n, EtOAc, THF, 1,4-dioxane, MeOH or EtOH.

One skilled in the art will recognize that the addition of acid to decrease the pH of the reaction mixture to less than pH 7 may be required. Examples of acids may include AcOH, Ti(O-iPr)\n4\n, trifluoroacetic acid or hydrochloric acid and the like. One skilled in the art will also recognize that compounds of formula A10 may be obtained from A9 upon treatment with an alkyl chloride, bromide, iodide, mesylate or tosylate and the like in a solvent such as DMF, DMA, THF or EtOH in the presence of bases such as NaHCO\n3\n, Na\n2\nCO\n3\n, K\n2\nCO\n3 \nor Cs\n2\nCO\n3\n.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntermediates of formula B5 were prepared according to Scheme B. Compounds of the formula B1 were prepared similar to compounds of formula A5 (Scheme 1). Compounds of the formula B2 were obtained from compounds of the formula B1 upon treatment with methyl iodide in a solvent such as DMF, DMA, THF or EtOH in the presence of bases such as NaHCO\n3\n, Na\n2\nCO\n3\n, K\n2\nCO\n3 \nor Cs\n2\nCO\n3\n. One skilled in the art will recognize that compounds of formula B2 can be utilized for transition-metal catalyzed cross-coupling reactions as previously described. Treatment of compounds of formula B2 with organoboron compounds A7 in the presence of a catalyst such as PdCl\n2\n(dppf), PdCl\n2\n(dppe) Pd\n2\n(dba)\n3\n, Pd(dba)\n2\n, PdCl\n2\n(PPh\n3\n)\n2\n, Pd(PPh\n3\n)\n4 \nin a solvent such as PhCH\n3\n, 1,4-dioxane, THF, DMA, DMF or DME in the presence of a base such as Na\n2\nCO\n3\n, K\n2\nCO\n3\n, Cs\n2\nCO\n3\n, CsF, KF, K\n3\nPO\n4\n, KOAc or the like and a ligand typically used in such reactions such as Q-Phos, dppf, dppe or PPh\n3 \nand the like affords compounds of formula B3 at temperatures ranging from rt to 160° C. using conventional or microwave heating.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amine in compounds of formula B3 may be protected with a protecting group, as indicated by P\n1\n, with previously described protecting groups. A preferred protecting group is t-butyl carbamate (Boc) or trifluoroacetamide.

Compounds were assayed in their free form or as salts, as indicated in the Examples section above.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBinding Affinities and Functional Activity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEx\n\n\n5HT\n7 \nKi (nM)\n\n\npEC50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n3.79\n\n\n6.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n21.00\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n33.88\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n11.00\n\n\n6.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n19.00\n\n\n5.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n8.20\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n10.00\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n13.49\n\n\n6.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n50.00\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n112.00\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n759.98\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n770.02\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\n1000.00\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\n249.98\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15\n\n\n120.01\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16\n\n\n114.00\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17\n\n\n4.42\n\n\n6.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\n532.97\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19\n\n\n299.99\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\n25.50\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21\n\n\n34.64\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22\n\n\n751.97\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n23\n\n\n67.00\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24\n\n\n8.89\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25\n\n\n10.49\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26\n\n\n15.49\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27\n\n\n410.02\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n28\n\n\n127.00\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n29\n\n\n10000.00\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30\n\n\n508.04\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n31\n\n\n10000.00\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n32\n\n\n454.05\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n33\n\n\n525.05\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34\n\n\n666.96\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n35\n\n\n754.92\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n36\n\n\n10000.00\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n37\n\n\n2267.25\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n38\n\n\n189.02\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n39\n\n\nND\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n40\n\n\nND\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n41\n\n\n470.00\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n42\n\n\n209.99\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n43\n\n\n5.46\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n44\n\n\n19.00\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n45\n\n\n52.00\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n46\n\n\n117.00\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n47\n\n\n7.98\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n48\n\n\n19.77\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n49\n\n\n129.99\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50\n\n\n150.00\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n51\n\n\n120.01\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n52\n\n\n80.24\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n53\n\n\n310.03\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n54\n\n\n120.01\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n55\n\n\n430.03\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n56\n\n\n180.01\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n57\n\n\n55.94\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n58\n\n\n155.02\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n59\n\n\n209.99\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n60\n\n\n329.99\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n61\n\n\n299.99\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n62\n\n\n729.96\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n63\n\n\n1699.81\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n64\n\n\nND\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n65\n\n\n129.99\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n66\n\n\n380.01\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n67\n\n\n120.01\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n68\n\n\n1482.86\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n69\n\n\n59.01\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n*ND symbolizes not determined.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile the invention has been illustrated by reference to exemplary and preferred embodiments, it will be understood that the invention is intended not to be limited by the foregoing detailed description, but to be defined by the appended claims as properly construed under principles of patent law."
