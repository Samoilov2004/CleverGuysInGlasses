No. 61/329,428, filed Apr. 29, 2010, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to azabicycloalkane-indoles, which are melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH-1) receptor antagonists, pharmaceutical compositions including these compounds, and methods of preparation and use thereof. The compounds are useful in the treatment of obesity, anxiety, depression, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and psychiatric disorders.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nObesity and the multitude of co-morbidities associated with obesity such as diabetes, dyslipidemia, coronary heart disease, and certain cancers are a major concern for public health. The currently available pharmaceutical therapies for the treatment of obesity have limited efficacy and side effects that limit their use. Thus, there is a significant medical need for better pharmacotherapy for obesity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nObesity has associated with it, economic and social costs. Obese people, an increasing proportion of most western societies, are regarded as having out of control feeding habits often associated with low self-esteem. Moreover, obese persons are more likely to have medical problems associated with or exacerbated by the excess body weight. Examples of medical conditions caused, exacerbated, or triggered by excessive weight include bone fractures, pains in the knee joints, arthritis, increased risk of hypertension, artherosclerosis, stroke, and diabetes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMelanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) has been identified as an orexigenic peptide that exerts an effect on food intake and body weight regulation. MCH is a cyclic 19 amino acid neuropeptide expressed in the zona incerta and lateral hypothalamus in response to both energy restriction and leptin deficiency. MCH is known to stimulate feeding when injected into the lateral ventricle of rats and the mRNA for MCH is upregulated in the hypothalamus of genetically obese mice (ob/ob) and in fasted control and ob/ob animals. In addition, animals treated with MCH show increases in glucose, insulin and leptin levels, mimicking human metabolic syndrome (Gomori, “Chronic Infusion of MCH Causes Obesity in Mice,” \nAm. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab., \n284:E583 (2002)). Mice lacking MCH are hypophagic and lean with increased metabolic rate, whereas animals over-expressing MCH gain excess weight on both standard and high fat diets. MCH is thought to have effects on other nervous system functions as well (Rocksz, “Biological Examination of Melanin Concentrating Hormone 1: Multi-tasking from the Hypothalamus,” \nDrug News Perspect., \n19(5):273 (2006)). An orphan G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) was recently identified as a receptor for MCH. Disruption of the binding between MCH and the MCH receptor, i.e. MCH antagonism, may thus be used to counteract the effects of MCH (McBriar, “Recent Advances in the Discovery of Melanin-Concentrating Hormone Receptor Antagonists,” \nCurr. Opin. Drug Disc\n. & \nDev., \n9(4):496 (2006)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe current preferred treatment for obesity as well as Type II non-insulin dependent diabetes is diet and exercise with a view toward weight reduction and improved insulin sensitivity for diabetics. Patient compliance, however, is usually poor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe problem is compounded by the fact that there are currently only two medications approved for the treatment of obesity (sibutramine (MERIDIA™) and orlistat (XENICAL™)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention is directed to overcoming these and other deficiencies in the art.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe

(1984), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “method of treating” means amelioration or relief from the symptoms and/or effects associated with the disorders described herein. As used herein, reference to “treatment” of a patient is intended to include prophylaxis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “monocyclic” used herein indicates a molecular structure having one ring.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “optionally substituted” is used to indicate that a group may have a substituent at each substitutable atom of the group (including more than one substituent on a single atom), provided that the designated atom's normal valency is not exceeded and the identity of each substituent is independent of the others. In accordance with the present invention, up to three H atoms in each residue are replaced with alkyl, halogen, haloalkyl, hydroxy, loweralkoxy, carboxy, carboalkoxy (also referred to as alkoxycarbonyl), carboxamido (also referred to as alkylaminocarbonyl), cyano, carbonyl, nitro, amino, alkylamino, dialkylamino, mercapto, alkylthio, sulfoxide, sulfone, acylamino, amidino, phenyl, benzyl, heteroaryl, phenoxy, benzyloxy, or heteroaryloxy. “Unsubstituted” atoms bear all of the hydrogen atoms dictated by their valency. When a substituent is keto (i.e., =0), then two hydrogens on the atom are replaced. Combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds; by “stable compound” or “stable structure” is meant a compound that is sufficiently robust to survive isolation to a useful degree of purity from a reaction mixture, and formulation into an efficacious therapeutic agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutical composition” means a composition comprising a compound of formula I and at least one component comprising pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, adjuvants, excipients, or vehicles, such as preserving agents, fillers, disintegrating agents, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, suspending agents, sweetening agents, flavoring agents, perfuming agents, antibacterial agents, antifungal agents, lubricating agents, and dispensing agents, depending on the nature of the mode of administration and dosage forms. As used herein, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” is used to mean any carrier, diluent, adjuvant, excipient, or vehicle, as described herein. Examples of suspending agents include ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar and tragacanth, or mixtures of these substances. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be ensured by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, for example sugars, sodium chloride, and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the use of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monosterate and gelatin. Examples of suitable carriers, diluents, solvents, or vehicles include water, ethanol, polyols, suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils (such as olive oil), and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Examples of excipients include lactose, milk sugar, sodium citrate, calcium carbonate, and dicalcium phosphate. Examples of disintegrating agents include starch, alginic acids, and certain complex silicates. Examples of lubricants include magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulphate, talc, as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable” means it is, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the cells of humans and lower animals without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response and the like, and are commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable dosage forms” means dosage forms of the compound of the invention, and includes, for example, tablets, dragees, powders, elixirs, syrups, liquid preparations, including suspensions, sprays, inhalants tablets, lozenges, emulsions, solutions, granules, capsules, and suppositories, as well as liquid preparations for injections, including liposome preparations. Techniques and formulations generally may be found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., latest edition, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs” as used herein means those prodrugs of the compounds useful according to the present invention which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans and lower animals with undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and the like, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, and effective for their intended use, as well as the zwitterionic forms, where possible, of the compounds of the invention. The term “prodrug” means compounds that are rapidly transformed in vivo to yield the parent compound of the above formula, for example by hydrolysis in blood. Commonly, the conversion of prodrug to drug occurs by enzymatic processes in the liver or blood of the mammal. Many of the compounds of the invention may be chemically modified without absorption into the systemic circulation, and in those cases, activation in vivo may come about by chemical action (as in the acid-catalyzed cleavage in the stomach) or through the intermediacy of enzymes and microflora in the gastrointestinal GI tract. Functional groups which may be rapidly transformed, by metabolic cleavage, in vivo form a class of groups reactive with the carboxyl group of the compounds of this invention. They include, but are not limited to, such groups as alkanoyl (such as acetyl, propionyl, butyryl, and the like), unsubstituted and substituted aroyl (such as benzoyl and substituted benzoyl), alkoxycarbonyl (such as ethoxycarbonyl), trialkylsilyl (such as trimethyl- and triethysilyl), monoesters formed with dicarboxylic acids (such as succinyl), and the like. Because of the ease with which the metabolically cleavable groups of the compounds useful according to this invention are cleaved in vivo, the compounds bearing such groups act as pro-drugs. The compounds bearing the metabolically cleavable groups have the advantage that they may exhibit improved bioavailability as a result of enhanced solubility and/or rate of absorption conferred upon the parent compound by virtue of the presence of the metabolically cleavable group.

Such terminology is well understood by persons of skill in the art and is used in the context of processes which involve sequential treatment with a series of reagents. In that context, a protecting group refers to a group which is used to mask a functionality during a process step in which it would otherwise react, but in which reaction is undesirable. The protecting group prevents reaction at that step, but may be subsequently removed to expose the original functionality. The removal or “deprotection” occurs after the completion of the reaction or reactions in which the functionality would interfere. Thus, when a sequence of reagents is specified, as it is in the processes of the invention, the person of ordinary skill can readily envision those groups that would be suitable as “protecting groups.” Suitable groups for that purpose are discussed in standard textbooks in the field of chemistry, such as Greene, \nProtective Groups in Organic Synthesis\n, John Wiley & Sons, New York (1991), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “solvate” refers to a compound of formula I in the solid state, wherein molecules of a suitable solvent are incorporated in the crystal lattice. A suitable solvent for therapeutic administration is physiologically tolerable at the dosage administered. Examples of suitable solvents for therapeutic administration are ethanol and water. When water is the solvent, the solvate is referred to as a hydrate. In general, solvates are formed by dissolving the compound in the appropriate solvent and isolating the solvate by cooling or using an antisolvent. The solvate is typically dried or azeotroped under ambient conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “therapeutically effective amount” is meant to describe an amount of compound of the present invention effective producing the desired therapeutic effect. Such amounts generally vary according to a number of factors well within the purview of ordinarily skilled artisans given the description provided herein to determine and account for. These include, without limitation: the particular subject, as well as its age, weight, height, general physical condition, and medical history, the particular compound used, as well as the carrier in which it is formulated and the route of administration selected for it; and, the nature and severity of the condition being treated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds described herein may contain one or more asymmetric centers and may thus give rise to enantiomers, diastereomers, and other stereoisomeric forms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach chiral center may be defined, in terms of absolute stereochemistry, as (R)- or (S)-.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention is meant to include all such possible isomers, as well as mixtures thereof, including racemic and optically pure forms. Optically active (R)- and (S)-, (−)- and (+)-, or (D)- and (L)-isomers may be prepared using chiral synthons or chiral reagents, or resolved using conventional techniques. When the compounds described herein contain olefinic double bonds or other centers of geometric asymmetry, and unless specified otherwise, it is intended that the compounds include both E and Z geometric isomers. Likewise, all tautomeric forms are also intended to be included.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis invention also envisions the “quaternization” of any basic nitrogen-containing groups of the compounds disclosed herein. The basic nitrogen can be quaternized with any agents known to those of ordinary skill in the art including, for example, lower alkyl halides, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl chloride, bromides and iodides; dialkyl sulfates including dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl and diamyl sulfates; long chain halides such as decyl, lauryl, myristyl and stearyl chlorides, bromides and iodides; and aralkyl halides including benzyl and phenethyl bromides. Water or oil-soluble or dispersible products may be obtained by such quaternization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the characterization of some of the substituents, it is recited that certain substituents may combine to form rings. Unless stated otherwise, it is intended that such rings may exhibit various degrees of unsaturation (from fully saturated to fully unsaturated), may include heteroatoms and may be substituted with lower alkyl or alkoxy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, R\n1 \nis H.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, R\n1 \nis C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl, for example, methyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, R\n2 \nis H.

Radioisotopes of hydrogen, carbon, phosphorous fluorine iodine and chlorine include \n3\nH, \n14\nC, \n35\nS, \n18\nF, \n32\nP, \n33\nP, \n125\nI and \n36\nCl, respectively. Compounds that contain those radioisotopes and/or other radioisotopes of other atoms are within the scope of this invention. Radiolabeled compounds described herein and prodrugs thereof can generally be prepared by methods well known to those skilled in the art. Conveniently, such radiolabeled compounds can be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the Examples and Schemes by substituting a readily available radiolabeled reagent for a non-radiolabeled reagent. Such compounds have a variety of potential uses, e.g., as standards and reagents in determining the binding ability of a potential pharmaceutical. In addition, in the case of stable isotopes, such compounds may have the potential to favorably modify the biological properties, e.g., pharmacological and/or pharmacokinetic properties, of compounds of formula I. The details concerning selection of suitable sites for incorporating radioactive isotopes into the compounds are known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the present invention as described herein are useful as MCH-1 receptor antagonists. It may be found upon examination that compounds that are not presently excluded from the claims are not patentable to the inventors in this application. In that case, the exclusion of species and genera in applicants' claims are to be considered artifacts of patent prosecution and not reflective of the inventors' concept or description of their invention. The invention, in a compound aspect, is all compounds of formula I, except those that are in the public's possession.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile it may be possible for compounds of formula I to be administered as the raw chemical, it will often be preferable to present them as part of a pharmaceutical composition. Accordingly, another aspect of the present invention is a pharmaceutical composition containing a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The carrier must be “acceptable” in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. Furthermore, when reference is made in an independent claim to a compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, it will be understood that claims which depend from that independent claim which refer to such a compound also include pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compound, even if explicit reference is not made to the salts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolid carriers suitable for use in the composition of the invention include one or more substances which may also act as flavoring agents, lubricants, solubilizers, suspending agents, fillers, glidants, compression aides, binders, tablet-disintegrating agents, or encapsulating materials. In powders, the carrier may be a finely divided solid which is in admixture with a finely divided compound of formula I. In tablets, the formula I compound may be mixed with a carrier having the necessary compression properties in suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size desired. Said powders and tablets may contain up to 99% by weight of the formula I compound. Solid carriers suitable for use in the composition of the invention include calcium phosphate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugars, lactose, dextrin, starch, gelatin, cellulose, methyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidine, low melting waxes, and ion exchange resins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny pharmaceutically acceptable liquid carrier suitable for preparing solutions, suspensions, emulsions, syrups and elixirs may be employed in the composition of the invention. Compounds of formula I may be dissolved or suspended in a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid carrier such as water, an organic solvent, or a pharmaceutically acceptable oil or fat, or a mixture thereof. Said liquid composition may contain other suitable pharmaceutical additives such as solubilizers, emulsifiers, buffers, preservatives, sweeteners, flavoring agents, suspending agents, thickening agents, coloring agents, viscosity regulators, stabilizers, osmo-regulators, or the like. Examples of liquid carriers suitable for oral and parenteral administration include water (particularly containing additives as above, e.g., cellulose derivatives, preferably sodium carboxymethyl cellulose solution), alcohols (including monohydric alcohols and polyhydric alcohols, e.g., glycols) or their derivatives, or oils (e.g., fractionated coconut oil and arachis oil). For parenteral administration the carrier may also be an oily ester such as ethyl oleate or isopropyl myristate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the present invention, the pharmaceutical composition further comprises one or more other therapeutic adjuncts, e.g., other compounds effective in the treatment of obesity, anxiety, depression, or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, that are known to persons of skill in the art. Such other therapeutic adjunts are described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the present invention relates to a method of treating a disease or condition which is susceptible to treatment with an MCH-1 receptor antagonist. This method involves selecting a patient with a disease or condition which is susceptible to treatment with an MCH-1 receptor antagonist and administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiseases or conditions which are susceptible to treatment with an MCH-1 receptor antagonist in accordance with the present invention include, but are not limited to, obesity, general anxiety disorders, social phobias, vertigo, obsessive-compulsive disorders, panic disorders, post-traumatic stress disorders, Parkinson's Disease Psychosis, schizophrenia, cognitive decline and defects in schizophrenia, presenile dementias, Alzheimer's Disease, psychological disorders, depression, substance abuse disorders, dementia associated with neurodegenerative disease, cognition deficits, and epilepsy (see PCT Publication No. WO 2007/010275, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs described above, the compounds of the present invention are useful as MCH-1 antagonists. As used in this invention, the term “antagonist” refers to a compound which binds to, and decreases the activity of, a receptor in the presence of an agonist. In the case of a G-protein coupled receptor, activation may be measured using any appropriate second messenger system which is coupled to the receptor in a cell or tissue in which the receptor is expressed. Some specific, but by no means limiting, examples of well-known second messenger systems are adenylate cyclase, intracellular calcium mobilization, ion channel activation, guanylate cyclase, and inositol phospholipid hydrolysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, treatment means any manner in which one or more of the symptoms of a disease or disorder are ameliorated or otherwise beneficially altered. Treatment also encompasses any pharmaceutical use of the compositions herein, such as use for treating diseases or disorders in which MCH-1 receptor activity is implicated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment of the present invention, the above method further involves administering a therapeutically effective amount of one or more therapeutic adjuncts. Suitable therapeutic adjuncts include, but are not limited to, anti-obesity and/or anorectic agents, anti-anxiety agents, anti-depression agents, and anti-non-alcoholic fatty liver disease agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable anti-obesity and/or anorectic adjuncts include, but are not limited to, phenylpropanolamine, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, phentermine, a cholecystokinin-A (hereinafter referred to as CCK-A) agonist, a monoamine reuptake inhibitor (such as sibutramine), a sympathomimetic agent, a serotonergic agent (such as dexfenfluramine or fenfluramine), a dopamine agonist (such as bromocriptine), a melanocyte-stimulating hormone receptor agonist or mimetic, a melanocyte-stimulating hormone analog, a cannabinoid receptor antagonist or inverse agonist, a melanin concentrating hormone receptor antagonist, a serotonin 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor antagonist, a serotonin 5-HT\n2C \nreceptor agonist, the OB protein (hereinafter referred to as “leptin”), a leptin analog, a leptin receptor agonist, the amylin peptide, an amylin analog, an amylin receptor agonist, a neuropeptide Y receptor modulator, a galanin antagonist, or a GI lipase inhibitor or decreaser (such as orlistat).
