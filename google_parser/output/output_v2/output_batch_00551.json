Description\n\n\n\n\n TITLE OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS FOR THE TREATMENT OF PAIN AND OTHER INDICATIONS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n In one aspect the invention disclosed herein is directed to compositions useful in the treatment of pain and other FAAH mediated diseases, disorders and conditions. In particular, the invention disclosed herein is directed to pharmaceutical compositions \n\n\ncomprising selected FAAH inhibitors and a second active agent. \n\n\n hi another aspect the invention disclosesed herein is directed to compositions useful in the treatment of neuropathic and nociceptive pain, said compositions comprising etoricoxib. \n\n\n In another aspect the invention disclosesed herein is directed to compositions useful in the treatment of neuropathic and nociceptive pain, said compositions comprising etoricoxib and a selected FAAH inhibitor. \n\n\n Disclosed herein are compounds that inhibit the activity of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), compositions that include the compounds, and methods of their use. \n\n\nCompounds disclosed herein as inhibitors of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) are useful in the treatment of diseases, disorders, or conditions that would benefit from the inhibition of fatty acid amide hydrolase and increases in endogenous fatty acid amides. \n\n\n Fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) is an enzyme that is abundantly expressed throughout the CNS (Freund et al. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83:1017-1066) as well as in peripheral tissues, such as, for example, in the pancreas, brain, kidney, skeletal muscle, placenta, and liver (Giang, D. K. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997, 94, 2238-2242; Cravatt et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004, 101, 29, 10821-10826). FAAH hydrolyzes the fatty acid amide (FAA) family of endogenous signaling lipids. General classes of fatty acid amides include the N- acylethanolamides (NAEs) and fatty acid primary amides (FAPAs). Examples of NAEs include anandamide (AEA), palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and oleoylethanolamide (OEA). An example of FAPAs includes 9-Z-octadecenamide or oleamide. (McKinney M K and Cravatt B F. 2005. Annu Rev Biochem 74:41 1-32). Another class of fatty acid amide family of endogenous signaling lipids is N-acyl taurines that have also been shown to be elevated upon FAAH deletion or inhibition and appear to act on transient receptor potential (TRP) family of calcium channels, although the functional consequences are not yet clear (Saghatehan A, et al. Biochemistry. 2004, 43:14332-9, Saghatelian A, et al. Biochemistry, 2006, 45:9007 -9015). h addition to fatty acid amides, FAAH can also hydrolyze certain fatty acid esters, such as, for example, 2- arachidonylglycerol (2-AG) another endocannabinoid (Mechoulam et al. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50:83-90; Stella et al. Nature, 1997; 388:773-778; Suguria et al. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215:89-97). \n\n Inhibition of FAAH is expected to lead to an increase in the level of anandamide and other fatty acid amides. This increase in fatty acid amides leads to an increase in the noiceptive threshold. Thus, inhibitors of FAAH are useful in the treatment of pain (Cravatt, BF; Lichtman, AH Current Opinion in Chemical Biology 2003, 7, 469-475). Such inhibitors are useful in the treatment of other disorders that can be treated using fatty acid amides or modulators of cannabinoid receptors, such as, for example, anxiety, sleep disorder, Alzheimer disease, and Parkinson's disease, eating disorders, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disorders, and inflammation (Simon et al Archives of Gen. Psychiatry, 2006, 63, 824-830. unos, G et al. Pharmacol Rev 2006, 58,389-462). In some embodiments, FAAH inhibitor compounds may be peripherally restricted and may not substantially affect neural disorders, such as, for example, depression and anxiety. Finally, agonism of \n\n\ncannabinoid receptors has also been shown to reduce the progression of atherosclerosis in animal models (see Steffens et al. Nature, 2005, 434, 782-786; and Steffens et al., Curr Opin. Lipid., 2006, 17, 519-526). Thus, increasing the level of endogenous cannabinergic fatty acid amides (e.g., anandamide) is expected to effectively treat or reduce the risk of \n\n\ndeveloping atherosclerosis. \n\n\n Inhibition of FAAH also leads to elevation of palmitoylethanolamide which is thought to work, in part, through activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor a (PPAR- a) to regulate multiple pathways including, for example, pain perception in neuropathic and inflammatory conditions such as convulsions, neurotoxicity, spacticity and to reduce inflammation, for example, in atopic eczema and arthritis (LoVerme J et al. The nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha mediates the anti-inflammatory actions of palmitoylethanolamide. Mol Pharmacol 2005, 67, 15-19; LoVerme J et al The search for the palmitoylethanolamide receptor. Life Sci 2005, 77: 1685-1698. Lambert DM et al. The palmitoylethanolamide family: a new class of anti-inflammatory agents? Curr Med Chem 2002, 9: 663-674; Eberlein B, et al. Adjuvant treatment of atopic eczema: assessment of an emollient containing N-palmitoylethanolamine (ATOP A study). J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol. 2008, 22:73-82. Re G, et al. Palmitoylethanolamide, endocannabinoids and related cannabimimetic compounds in protection against tissue inflammation and pain: potential use in companion animals.Vet J. 2007 173:21-30.). Thus, inhibition of FAAH is useful for the treatment of various pain and inflammatory conditions, such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, skeletomuscular pain, and fibromyalgia. \n\n\n It is also thought that certain fatty acid amides, such as, for example, OEA, act through the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor a (PPAR- a) to regulate diverse physiological processes, including, e.g., feeding and lipolysis. Consistent with this, human adipose tissue has been shown to bind and metabolize endocannabinoids such as anandamide and 2-arachidonylglycerol (see Spoto et al., Biochimie 2006, 88, 1889-1897; and Matias et al. , J. Clin. Endocrin. & Met., 2006, 91, 3171-3180). Thus, inhibiting FAAH activity in \n\n vivo leads to reduced body fat, body weight, caloric intake, and liver triglyceride levels. \n\n\nHowever, unlike other anti-lipidemic agents that act through PPAR- a, e.g., fibrates, FAAH inhibitors do not cause adverse side effects such as rash, fatigue, headache, erectile \n\n\ndysfunction, and, more rarely, anemia, leukopenia, angioedema, and hepatitis (see, e.g., \n\n\nMuscari et al. Cardiology, 2002, 97: 115-121). \n\n\n Many fatty acid amides are produced on demand and rapidly degraded by \n\n\nFAAH. As a result, hydrolysis by FAAH is considered to be one of the essential steps in the regulation of fatty acid amide levels in the central nervous system as well as in peripheral tissues and fluids. The broad distribution of FAAH combined with the broad array of biological effects of fatty acid amides (both endocannabinoid and non-endocannabinoid mechanisms) suggests that inhibition of FAAH leads to altered levels of fatty acid amides in many tissues and fluids and may be useful to treat many different conditions. FAAH \n\n\ninhibitors increase the levels of endogenous fatty acid amides. FAAH . inhibitors block the degradation of endocannabinoids and increase the tissue levels of these endogenous \n\n\nsubstances. FAAH inhibitors can be used in this respect in the prevention and treatment of pathologies in which endogenous cannabinoids and or any other substrates metabolized by the FAAH enzyme are involved. \n\n\n The various fatty acid ethanolamides have important and diverse \n\n\nphysiological functions. As a result, inhibitor molecules that selectively inhibit FAAH \n\n\nenzymatic activity would allow a corresponding selective modulation of the cellular and extra-cellular concentrations of a FAAH substrate. FAAH inhibitors that are biologically compatible could be effective pharmaceutical compounds when formulated as therapeutic agents for any clinical indication where FAAH enzymatic inhibition is desired. In some embodiments, FAAH activity in peripheral tissues can be preferentially inhibited. In some embodiments, FAAH inhibitors that do substantially cross the blood-brain-barrier can be used to preferentially inhibit FAAH activity in peripheral tissues. In some embodiments, FAAH inhibitors that preferentially inhibit FAAH activity in peripheral tissues can minimize the effects of FAAH inhibition in the central nervous system. In some embodiments, it is preferred to inhibit FAAH activity in peripheral tissues and minimize FAAH inhibition in the central nervous system. \n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n The present invention is directed to a composition useful for the treatment of a FAAH mediated disease, disorder or conditions comprising a selected FAAH inhibitor and and a second active agent.

These FAAH inhibitors are expected to reduce one or more symptoms of one or more such disorders. \n\n\n Alone or in combination with a second active agent, the FAAH inhibitors of the invention can be used to prevent and/or treat, for example, epilepsy and epileptiform-iduced damage, exposure to excitotoxic neurotoxins, excitotoxicity, ischaemic brain damage, cerebral ischaema, traumatic injury (e.g. brain injury), depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinsons disease, Huntington's disease, amyotropic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, tourette-s syndrome, schizophrenia, glaucoma, pain, addiction, inflammation, allergic responses, eating disorders, low blood pressure, hypertension, respiratory problems, cancer (tumour growth), chemotherapy complications, asphyxia, attention deficit disorder, and gastrointestinal diseases, including nausea and vomiting, gastric ulcers, secretory diarrhea, paralytic ileus, inflammatory bowel disease, colon cancer, gastro-oesophageal reflux conditions, pruritus, fatty liver disease, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The FAAH inhibitors can also be used to treat irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a disorder commonly associated with cramping, abdominal pain, bloating, constipation, and diarrhea. There are three major types of \n\n IBS: constipation predominant (IBS-C), diarrhea predominant (IBS-D), and alternating (IBS-A) in which constipation and diarrhea both occur. \n\n\nGlaucoma and ocular disorders \n\n\n Alone or in combination with a second active agent, the FAAH inhibitors of the invention can be used to prevent and/or treat glaucoma and other disorders characterized by ocular hypertension. \n\n\nSleep Disorders \n\n\n Alone or in combination with a second active agent, the FAAH inhibitors of the invention can be used to prevent and/or treat a sleep disorder that affects the subject's ability to fall asleep and/or remain asleep, and/or results in unrefreshing sleep. The term \"sleep disorder\" includes insomnia, night terrors, bruxism, somnambulism, sleep apnea, restless leg syndrome, unrefreshing sleep, seasonal affective disorder, circadian rhythm adjustment disorders, and the like. \n\n\n Insomnia is typically classed into sleep onset insomnia, where a subject takes more than 30 minutes to fall asleep; and sleep maintenance insomnia, where the subject spends more than 30 minutes awake during an expected sleep period, or for example, waking before the desired wake-up time with an inability to get back to sleep. Sleep disorders include both endogenous disorders, such as sleep apnea, and disorders related to behavioral or external environmental factors. For example, sleep disorders include a subject's difficulty in adjusting to a new circadian rhythm, for example, due to jet lag; night, extended, or irregular work shifts; and the like. A sleep disorder can also arise in a subject that has other disorders, diseases, or injuries, or in a subject being treated with other medications, where the subject as a result has difficulty falling asleep and/or remaining asleep, or experiences unrefreshing sleep. For example, the disclosed method is useful for inducing sleep in a subject having difficulty sleeping as the result of undergoing chemotherapy, or as a result of injuries, or as the result of stress or mood disorders such as depression, anxiety, and the like. \n\n\n Sleep disorders include conditions recognized by one skilled in the art as sleep disorders— for example, conditions known in the art or conditions which are proposed to be sleep disorders or discovered to be sleep disorders. See, for example. Thorpy. MJ International Classification of Sleep Disorders, Revised: Diagnostic and Coding Manual. American Sleep Disorders Association; Rochester, Minnesota 1997; and JCD CM, International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, National Center for Health Statistics. \n\n\nHyattsville, MD. \n\n\n Sleep disorders can be generally classed into dyssoinnias, e.g., intrinsic, extrinsic, and circadian rhythm disorders; parasomnias, e.g., arousal, sleep- wake transition, and rapid eye \n\n movement (REM) associated disorders, and other parasomnias; disorders associated with mental, neurological, and oilier medical disorders; and other sleep disorders. \n\n\nIntrinsic sleep disorders include, for example, psychophysiological insomnia, sleep state misperception, idiopathic insomnia, narcolepsy, recurrent hypersomnia, idiopathic hypersomnia, post-traumatic hypersomnia, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, central sleep apnea syndrome, central alveolar hypoventilation syndrome, periodic limb movement disorder, restless legs syndrome, and the like. \n\n\n Extrinsic sleep disorders include, for example, inadequate sleep hygiene, environmental sleep disorder, altitude insomnia, adjustment sleep disorder, insufficient sleep syndrome, limit-setting sleep disorder, sleep-upsilonnset association disorder, food allergy insomnia, nocturnal eating (drinking) syndrome, hypnotic-dependent sleep disorder, stiinulaiu- dependent sleep disorder, alcohol-dependent sleep disorder, toxin-induced sleep disorder, and the like. \n\n\n Circadian rhythm sleep disoiders include, for example, time-zone change (jet lag) syndrome, shift work sleep disorder, irregular sleep-wake pattern, delayed sleep phase syndrome, advanced sleep phase syndrome, non 24h sleep-wake disorder, and the like. \n\n\n Arousal sleep disorders include, for example, confusional arousals, sleepwalking, sleep terrors, and the like. \n\n\n Sleep-wake transition disorders include, for example, rhythmic movement disorder, sleep starts, sleeptalking, nocturnal leg cramps, and the like. \n\n\n REM-associatcd sleep disorders include, for example, nightmares, sleep paralysis, impaired sleep-related penile erections, sleep-related painful erections, REM sleep- related sinus arrest, REM sleep behavior disorders, and the like. \n\n\n Other parasomnias include, for example, sleep bruxism, sleep enuresis, sleep- related abnormal swallowing syndrome, nocturnal paroxysmal dystonia, sudden unexplained nocturnal death syndrome, primary snoring, infant sleep apnea, congenital central \n\n\nhypoventilation syndrome, sudden infant death syndrome, benign neonatal sleep myoclonus, and the like. A \"sleep disorder\" may also arise in a subject that has other medical disorders, diseases, or injuries, or in a subject being treated with other medications or medical treatments, where the subject as a result has difficulty falling asleep and/or remaining asleep, or experiences unrefreshing sleep, e.g., the subject experiences sleep deprivation. For example, some subjects have difficulty sleeping after undergoing medical treatment for other conditions, e.g., \n\n\nchemotherapy or surgery, or as a result of pain or other effects of physical injuries. \n\n\n It is well known in the art that certain medical disorders, for example, central nervous system (CNS) disorders, e.g., mental or neurological disorders, e.g. anxiety, can have a sleep disorder component, e.g., sleep deprivation. Thus, treating a sleep disorder also includes treating a sleep disorder component of other disorders, e.g., CNS disorders. Further, treating the sleep disorder component of CNS disorders can also have the beneficial effect of ameliorating \n\n other symptoms associated with the disorder. For example, in some subjects experiencing anxiety coupled with sleep deprivation, treating the sleep deprivation component also treats the anxiety component. Thus, the present invention also includes a method of treating such medical disorders. \n\n\n Sleep disorders associated with mental disorders include psychoses, mood disorders anxiety disorders, panic disorder, addictions, and the like. Specific mental disorders include, for example, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, affective neurosis/disorder, depressive neurosis/disorder, anxiety neurosis, dysthymic disorder, behavior disorder, mood disorder, schizophrenia, depression, delirium, alcoholism, and the like. \n\n\n Sleep disorders associated with neurological disorders include, for example, cerebral degenerative disorders, dementia, parkinsonism, fatal familial insomnia, sleep related epilepsy, electrical status epilepticus of sleep, sleep-related headaches, arid the like. Sleep disorders associated with other medical disorders include, fur example, sleeping sickness, nocturnal cardiac ischemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sleep-related asthma, sleep- related gastroesophageal reflux, peptic ulcer disease, fibrositis syndrome, and the like. \n\n\n In some circumstances, sleep disorders are also associated with pain, e.g., neuropathic pain associated with restless leg syndrome; migraine; enhanced or exaggerated sensitivity to pain, such as hyperalgesia, causalgia and allodynia; acute pain; bum pain; atypical facial pain: neuropathic pain; back pain; complex regional pain syndromes 1 and 11 ; arthritic pain: sports injury pain; pain related to infection, e.g., HIV. post-polio syndrome, and postherpetic neuralgia; phantom limb pain; labor pain; cancer pain; postchemotherapy pain; post- stroke pain, post-operative pain; neuralgia; conditions associated with visceral pain including irritable bowel syndrome, migraine and angina; and the like. \n\n\n Other sleep disordeis include, for example, short sleeper, long sleeper, subwakefulness syndrome, fragmentary myoclonus, sleep hyperhidrosis, menstrual associated sleep disorder, pregnancy- associated sleep disorder, terrifying hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep- related neurogenic tachypnea, sleep-related laryngospasm, sleep choking syndrome, and the like. \n\n\n Insomnia is typically classed into sleep onset insomnia, where a subject takes more than 30 minutes to fall asleep; and sleep maintenance insomnia, where the subject spends more than 30 minutes awake during an expected sleep period, or, for example, waking before the desired wake-up time with difficulty or an inability to get back to sleep Some of the disclosed compounds are effective in treating sleep onset and sleep maintenance insomnias, insomnia resulting from circadian rhythm adjustment disorders, or insomnia resulting from CNS disorders. In one embodiment, a subject is treated for a circadian rhythm adjustment disorder. In another embodiment a subject is treated for insomnia resulting from a mood disorder. In other embodiments, a subject is treated for sleep apnea, somnambulism, night terrors, restless leg syndrome, sleep onset insomnia, and sleep maintenance insomnia. In other embodiments, a subject is treated for, sleep onset insomnia or sleep maintenance insomnia \n\n Alone or in combination with a second active agent, the FAAH inhibitors of the invention can be used to for inducing, prolonging and/or enhancing sleep. This can encompass the treatment of a sleep disorder, i.e. a difficulty in achieving satisfactory sleep due to some internal or external factor, e.g. pain, stress or anxiety, misuse of stimulants or depressants, or temporary disturbance of lifestyle and it can encompass elective desires on the part of a user to achieve a particularly beneficial period of sleep. Such a desire may, for instance, arise in anticipation of important events the following day or in the near future for which a person may wish to be fully alert and refreshed. \n\n\n Alone or in combination with a second active agent, the FAAH inhibitors of the invention can help achieve any of the following goals: getting to sleep, especially stage 1 sleep; staying asleep; sleeping well; waking refreshed; waking alert; faster onset to stage 1 sleep; \n\n\nincreasing duration of sleep periods; decreasing the number and duration of awakenings; \n\n\nincreasing total duration of sleep; increasing probability of sleeping well; reducing insomnia, especially chronic or mild-moderate insomnia; decreasing disturbances during sleeptime; and improving quality of sleep. Meeting these goals can be determined by any standard or, known subjective or objective measures, for instance the arolinska scale, Loughborough sleep log or actimetry. \n\n\n Improved sleep can assist in keeping awake; keeping alert; keeping refreshed; and performing well the next day. \n\n\n The degree of refreshedness and quality of sleep may be determined by the - morning- log of the Loughborough sleep log with the highest degree of refreshedness or quality of sleep being represented as 1 and the lowest being represented as 5. Accordingly, the percentage increase in refreshedness or quality of sleep is measured in this context by the decrease in the mean refreshedness or quality of sleep. \n\n\n The response of feeling extremely alert, very alert or alert can be determined, for instance, by the Karolinska 9- point scale. Other measures of sleep parameters include the sleep disturbance index (SDI) and time to sleep onset (TTSO) that can both be measured by actimetry. \n\n\n The FAAH inhibitors of the invention can be used in combination with therapies currently used for the treatment of sleep disorders, e.g., Aldesleukin (Proleukin), Amantadine (Symmetrel). Baclofen (Lioresal). Bepridil (Vascor), Carisoprodol (Soma), Clonazepam \n\n\n (Klonopin), Diazepam (Valium), Diphenhydramine (Sominex, Nytoi), Doxylamipie (Unisom). Estazolam (ProSoni). Flurazepam (Dalmane), Gabapentin, Lorazepam (Ativan). Le vod opa- carb idopa (Sincmet), Melatonin. Methylphenidate (Ritalin), Modanfmil (Provigil), Pemoline (Cylert), Pergolide, Pramipexoie, Promethazine (Phenergan), Quazepam (Doral), Rimantadine (Flumadine), Sibutxamuie (Meridia), Sodium oxybate, Synthetic conjugated estrogens \n\n\n (Cenestin), Temazepam (Restoril), Triazolam (Halcion), Zaleplon (Sonata), and Zolpidem (Arnbien). \n\n Obesity related disorders \n\n\n Alone or in combination with a second active agent, the FAAH inhibitors of the invention may be used to treat obesity and/or to reduce or control body weight (or fat) or prevent and/or treat obesity or other appetite related disorders related to the excess consumption of food, ethanol and other appetizing substances. The compounds may be used to modulate lipid metabolism, reduce body fat (e.g., via increasing fat utilization) or reduce (or suppress) appetite (e.g., via inducing satiety). Obesity is a condition in which there is an excess of body fat. In many cases, an individual is considered obese if the individual has a body mass index (BMA) greater than or equal to 30 kg/nr or if the individual has at least one co-morbidity and a BMI greater than or equal to 27 kg/m\n2\n. In certain situations, a subject at risk for obesity is an otherwise healthy subject with a BMI of 25 kg m\n2\n to less than 30 kg/m\n2\n or a subject with at least one co-morbidiiy with a BMI of 25 kg/m to less than 27 kg/in . \n\n\n The increased risks associated with obesity aree thought to occur at a lower BMI in Asians. In some situations, obesity in an Asian refers to a condition whereby a subject with at least one obesity-induced or obesity-related co-morbidity that requires weight reduction or that would be improved by weight reduction, has a BMI greater than or equal to 25 kg/nr. In Asians, an obese subject sometimes refers to a subject with at least one obesity-induced or obesity-related co-morbidity that requires weight reduction or that would be improved by weight reduction, with a BMI greater than or equal to 25 kg/m . In some situations, an Asian at risk of obesity is a subject with a BMI of greater than 23 kg/m 2 to less than 25 kg/m 2. \n\n\n Obesity-induced or obesity related co-morbidities include, but are not limited to diabetes, noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus type 2, impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting glucose, insulin resistance syndrome, dyslipidemia, hypertension, hyperuricacidemia, gout, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, sleep apnea syndrome, Pickwickian syndrome, fatty liver, cerebral infarction, cerebral, thrombosis, transient ischemic attack, orthopedic disorders, arthritis deformans, lumbodynia, emmeniopatliy, and infertility. In particular, co-morbidities include: hypertension, hyperlipidemia, dyslipidemia, glucose intolerance, cardiovascular disease, sleep apnea, diabetes mellitus, and other obesity-related conditions. \n\n\n Treatment (of obesity and obesity-related disorders) refers to the administration of the compounds described herein to reduce or maintain the body weight of an obese subject. One outcome of treatment may be reducing the body weight of an obese subject relative to that subject's body weight immediately before the administration of the compounds described herein. Another outcome of treatment may be preventing body weight regain of body weight previously lost as a result of diet, exercise, or pharmacotherapy. Another outcome of treatment may be decreasing the occurrence of and/or the severity of obesity- related diseases. The treatment may suitably result in a reduction in food or calorie intake by the subject, including a reduction in total food intake, or a reduction of intake of specific components of the diet such as \n\n carbohydrates or fats; and/or the inhibition of nutrient absorption; and/or the inhibition of the reduction of metabolic rate; and in weight reduction in patients in need thereof. The treatment may also result in an alteration of metabolic rate, such as an increase in metabolic rate, rather than or in addition to an inhibition of the reduction of metabolic rate; and/or in minimization of the metabolic resistance that normally results from weight loss. \n\n\n Prevention (of obesity and obesity-related disorders) refers to the administration of the compounds described herein to reduce or maintain the body weight of a subject at risk of obesity. One outcome of prevention may be reducing the body weight of a subject at risk of obesity relative to that subject's body weight immediately before the administration of the compounds described herein. Another outcome of prevention may be preventing body weight regain of body weight previously lost as a result of diet, exercise, or pharmacotherapy. Another outcome of prevention may be preventing obesity from occurring if the treatment is administered prior to the onset of obesity in a subject at risk of obesity. Another outcome of prevention may be decreasing the occurrence and/or severity of obesity-related disorders if the treatment is administered prior to the onset of obesity in a subject at risk of obesity. Moreover, if treatment is commenced in already obese subjects, such treatment may prevent the occurrence, progression or severity of obesity-related disorders, such as, but not limited to, arteriosclerosis, Type II diabetes, polycystic ovarian disease, cardiovascular diseases, osteoarthritis, dermatological disorders, hypertension, insulin resistance, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and cholelithiasis. Obesity-related disorders are disorders that are associated with, caused by, or result from obesity. Examples of obesity-related disorders include overeating and bulimia, hypertension, diabetes, elevated plasma insulin concentrations and insulin resistance, dyslipidemias, hyperlipidemia, endometrial, breast, prostate and colon cancer, osteoarthritis, obstructive sleep apnea, cholelithiasis, gallstones, heart disease, abnormal heart rhythms and arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease, sudden death, stroke, polycystic ovarian disease, craniopharyngioma, the Prader-Willi Syndrome, Frupsilonhhch's syndrome, GH- deficie.it subjects, normal variant short stature, Turner's syndrome, and other pathological conditions showing reduced metabolic activity or a decrease in resting energy expenditure as a percentage of total fat-free mass, e.g., children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The compounds described herein may be used to reduce or control body weight (or fat) or to prevent and/or treat obesity or other appetite related disorders related to the excess consumption of food, ethapiol and other appetizing substances. The compounds may be used to modulate lipid metabolism, reduce body fat (e.g. via increasing fat utilization) or reduce (or suppress) appetite (e.g. via inducing satiety). \n\n\n Further examples of obesity- related disorders are metabolic syndrome, also known as syndrome X, insulin resistance syndrome, sexual and reproductive dysfunction, such as infertility, hypogonadism in males and hirsutism in females, gastrointestinal motility disorders, such as obesity-related gastroesophageal reflux, respiratory disorders, such as obesity- \n\n hypoventilation syndrome (Pickwickian syndrome), cardiovascular disorders, inflammation, such as systemic inflammation of the vasculature, arteriosclerosis, hypercholesterolemia, \n\n\nhyperuricaemia, lowerback pain, gallbladder disease, gout, and kidney cancer. The compounds described herein are also useful for reducing the risk of secondary outcomes of obesity, such as reducing the risk of left ventricular hypertrophy. \n\n\n The FAAH inhibitors of the invention can be administered in combination with anti-obesity agents, including, but not limited to: 1 IB HSD-I (11-beta hydroxy steroid \n\n\ndehydrogenase type 1) inhibitors, such as BVT 3498, BVT 2733, 3-(l -adamantyl)-4-ethyl- 5- (ethyl thio)- 4H-1.2,4-lriazole. 3-(l-adamantyl)-5-(3,4,5~trimethoxyphenyl)-4-methyl-4H-I,2,4- triazole, 3- adamantanyl-4,5,6,7.8, 9,10,1 l,12,3a-decahydro-l,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a][l ljannulene\n,\n and those compounds disclosed in WOO 1/90091, WOO 1/90090, WO01/90092 and WO02/072084; 5HT (serotonin) transporter inhibitors, such as paroxetine, fluoxetine, fenfluramine, \n\n\nfluvoxamine. sertraline, and imipramipie. and those disclosed in WOO03/00663; 5HT antagonists such as those in WO03/037871.

Anxiety disorders are a group of psychological problems whose key features include excessive anxiety, fear, worry, avoidance, and compulsive rituals, and produce or result in inordinate morbidity, over utilization of healthcare services, and functional impairment. They are among the most prevalent psychiatric conditions in the United States and in most other countries. Anxiety disorders listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition, Revised 1994, published by the American Psychiatric Association, Washington, D C. pages 393-444) include panic disorder with and without agoraphobia, agoraphobia without history of panic disorder, specific phobia, social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), acute stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), anxiety disorder due to a general medical condition, substance- induced anxiety disorder, specific phobia, and anxiety disorder not otherwise specified. \n\n\n Obsessive compulsive disorder is characterized by recurrent and persistent ideas, thoughts, impulses or images (obsessions) that are ego-dyslonic and/or repetitive, purposeful and intentional behaviors (compulsions) that are recognized by the person as excessive or \n\n\nunreasonable. The obsessions or compulsions cause marked distress, are time-consuming, and/or significantly interfere with social or occupational functioning. \n\n\n Panic disorder is characterized by recurrent unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or \n\n\nconsequences of the attacks, and/or a significant change in behavior related to the attacks. A panic attack is defined as a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort in which four (or more) of the following symptoms develop abruptly and reach a peak within 10 minutes: (1) palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate; (2) sweating; (3) trembling or shaking; (4) sensations of shortness of breath or smothering; (5) feeling of choking; (6) chest pain or discomfort; (7) nausea or abdominal distress; (8) feeling dizzy unsteady, lightheaded, or faint; (9) derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (being detached from oneself): (10) fear of losing control; (11) fear of dying; (12) paresthesias (numbness or tingling sensations); and (13) chills or hot flushes. Panic disorder may or may not be associated with agoraphobia, or an irrational and often disabling fear of being out in public. \n\n\n Social anxiety disorder, also known as social phobia, is characterized by a marked and persistent fear of one or more social or performance situations in which the person is exposed to unfamiliar people or to possible scrutiny by others. Exposure to the feared situation almost invariably provokes anxiety, which may approach the intensity of a panic attack. The feared situations are avoided or endured with intense anxiety or distress. The avoidance, anxious anticipation, or distress in the feared situation(s) interferes significantly with the person's normal routine, occupational or academic functioning, or social activities or relationships, or there is \n\n marked distress about having the phobias. Lesser degrees of performance anxiety or shyness generally do not require psychopharmacological treatment. \n\n\n Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation) that is persistent for at least 6 months and which the person finds difficult to control. It must be associated with at least 3 of the following 6 symptoms: \n\n\nrestlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge, being easily fatigued, difficulty concentrating or mind going blank, irritability, muscle tension, and sleep disturbance. \n\n\n The diagnostic criteria for this disorder are described in further detail in DSM-IV, which is incorporated herein by reference (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). \n\n\n Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as defined by DSM11 l-R/PV, requires exposure to a traumatic event that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or threat to the physical integrity of self or others, and a response which involves intense fear, \n\n\nhelplessness, or horror. Symptoms that occur as a result of exposure to the traumatic event include re-experiencing of the event in the form of intrusive thoughts, flashbacks or dreams, and intense psychological distress and physiological reactivity on exposure to cues to the event; \n\n\navoidance of situations reminiscent of the traumatic event, inability to recall details of the event, and/or numbing of general responsiveness manifested as diminished interest in significant activities, estrangement from others, restricted range of affect, or sense of foreshortened future: and symptoms of autonomic arousal including hypervigiiance, exaggerated startle response, sleep disturbance, impaired concentration, and irritability or outbursts of anger. A PTSD diagnosis requires that the symptoms are present for at least a month and that they cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. \n\n\n Alone or in combination, it is contemplated that the compounds will be effective in treating obsessions and compulsions in patients who have been diagnosed as having obsessive compulsive disorder based upon administration of appropriate tests, which may include, but are not limited to any of the following: Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) (for adults), National Institute of Mental Health Global OCD Scale (NIMH GOCS), and CG1- Severity of Illness scale. It is further contemplated that the compounds will be effective in inducing improvements in certain of the factors measured in these tests, such as a reduction of several points in the YBOCS total score. It is also contemplated that the compounds of this invention will be effective in preventing relapse of obsessive- compulsive disorder. \n\n\n Alone or in combination with a second active agent, the FAAH inhibitors of the invention will be effective in treating panic disorder in patients who have been diagnosed with panic disorder on the basis of frequency of occurrence of panic attacks, or by means of the CGI- Severity of Illness scale. It is further contemplated that the compounds described herein will be effective in inducing improvements in certain of the factors measured in these evaluations, such as a reduction in frequency or elimination of panic attacks an improvement in the CGI- Severity of Illness scale or a CGI Global Improvement score of 1 (very much improved), 2 (much \n\n improved) or 3 (minimally improved). It is also contemplated that the compounds of this invention will be effective in-preventing relapse of panic disorder. \n\n\n Alone or in combination with a second active agent, the FAAH inhibitors of the invention will be effective in treating social anxiety disorder in patients who have been diagnosed as having social anxiety disorder based upon the administration of any of the following tests: the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS), the CGI-Severity of Illness scale, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM- A)\nt\n the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D)\n,\n the axis V Social and occupational Functioning Assessment Scale of DSM-IV, the axis II (ICD10) World-Health organization Disability Assessment, Schedule 2 (DAS-2), the Sheehan Disability Scales, the Schneier Disability Profile, the World Health Organization\n\n\nQuality of Life- 100 (WHOQOL-100)), or other tests as described in Ballenger. JC et al 1998, J Clin Psychiatry 59 Suppl 17:54-60., which is incorporated herein by reference. It is further contemplated that the FAAH inhibitors of the invention will be effective in inducing \n\n\nimprovements as measured by these tests, such as the a change from baseline in the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS)\n!\n or a CGI-Global Improvement score of 1 (very much improved), 2 (much improved) or 3 (minimally improved). It is also contemplated that the FAAH inhibitors of the invention will be effective in preventing relapse of social anxiety disorder. \n\n\n Alone or in combination with a second active agent, the FAAH inhibitors of the invention will be effective in treating generalized anxiety disorder in patients who have been diagnosed as having this disorder based upon the diagnostic criteria described in DSM-IV. It is further contemplated that the compounds described herein will be effective in reducing symptoms of this disorder, such as the following: excessive worry and anxiety, difficulty controlling worry, restlessness, or feeling keyed up or on edge, being easily fatigued, difficulty concentrating or mind going blank, irritability, muscle tension, or sleep disturbance. It is also contemplated that the compounds of this invention will be effective in preventing relapse of general anxiety disorder. \n\n\n Alone or in combination with a second active agent, the FAAH inhibitors of the invention will be effective in treating PTSD in patients who have been diagnosed as having PTSD based upon the administration of any of the following tests: Clinician Administered PTSD Scale Part 2 (CAPS) and the patient-rated Impact of Event Scale (IES).

The compounds may be useful for treating neuroinflammation associated with brain disorders (e.g., Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease) and chronic inflammation associated with cranial radiation injury. The compounds may be useful for treating acute inflammatory conditions (such as those resulting from infection) and chronic inflammatory conditions (such as those resulting from asthma, arthritis, and \n\n\ninflammatory bowel disease). The FAAH compounds may also be useful in treating \n\n\ninflammation associated with trauma and non- inflammatory myalgia. The compounds can also be administered to those prior to surgery or taking anticoagulants. The compounds may reduce the risk of a thrombotic cardiovascular event which is defined as any sudden event of a type known to be caused by platelet aggregation, thrombosis, and subsequent ischemic clinical events, including thrombotic or thromboembolic stroke, myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, transient ischemic attack (ΤΪΑ; amaurosis fagax), reversible ischemic neurologic deficits, and any similar thrombotic event in any vascular bed (splanchnic, renal, aortic, peripheral, etc.). \n\n\n The FAAH inhibitors of the invention may inhibit uterus contraction caused by hormones and prostanoid- induced smooth muscle contraction. The compounds may be useful in treating premature labor, menstrual cramps, menstrual irregularity, and dysmenorrhea. \n\n Alone or in combination with a second active agent, the FAAH inhibitors of the invention may inhibit cellular neoplastic transformations and metastatic tumor growth. The compounds described herein may be associated with reducing die number of adenomatous colorectal polyps.

The compounds are also useful for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain syndromes can develop following neuronal injury and the resulting pain may persist for months or years, even after the original injury has healed. Neuronal injury may occur in the peripheral nerves, dorsal roots, spinal cord, or certain regions in the brain. Neuropathic pain syndromes are traditionally \n\n classified according to the disease or event that precipitated them. Neuropathic pain syndromes include: diabetic neuropathy; sciatica; back pain, non-specific lower back pain; multiple sclerosis pain; fibromyalgia; HIV -related neuropathy; neuralgia, such as post- herpetic neuralgia and trigeminal neuralgia; pain related to chronic alcoholism, hypothyroidism, uremia, or vitamin deficiencies; pain related to compression of the nerves (e.g., Carpal Tunnel Syndrome), and pain resulting from physical trauma, amputation/phantom limb pain, cancer, toxins or chronic inflammatory conditions. The symptoms of neuropathic pain are incredibly heterogeneous and are often described as spontaneous shooting and lancinating pain, or ongoing, burning pain. In addition, there is pain associated with normally non painful sensations such as \"pins and needles\" (paraesthesias and dysesthesias), increased sensitivity to touch (hyperesthesia), painful sensation following innocuous stimulation (dynamic, static or thermal allodynia), increased sensitivity to noxious stimuli (thermal, cold, mechanical hyperalgesia), continuing pain sensation after removal of the stimulation (hyperpathia) or an absence of or deficit in selective sensory pathways (hypoalgesia). \n\n\n Alone or in combination with a second active agent, the FAAH inhibitors of the invention may also be of use in the treatment and/or prevention of cyclooxygenase-mediated proliferative disorders such as may occur in diabetic retinopathy and tumor angiogenesis.

Additional asymmetric centers may be present depending upon the nature of the various substituents on the molecule. Each such asymmetric center will independently produce two optical isomers and it is intended that all of the possible optical isomers and diastereomers in mixtures and as pure or partially purified compounds are included within the ambit of this invention. The present invention is meant to comprehend all such isomeric forms of these compounds. Formula I shows the structure of the class of compounds without preferred stereochemistry. The independent syntheses of these diastereomers or their chromatographic separations may be achieved as known in the art by appropriate modification of the methodology disclosed herein. Their absolute stereochemistry may be determined by the x-ray crystallography of crystalline products or crystalline \n\n\nintermediates which are derivatized, if necessary, with a reagent containing an asymmetric center of known absolute configuration. If desired, racemic mixtures of the compounds may be separated so that the individual enantiomers are isolated. The separation can be carried out by methods well known in the art, such as the coupling of a racemic mixture of compounds to an enantiomerically pure compound to form a diastereomeric mixture, followed by separation of the individual diastereomers by standard methods, such as fractional crystallization or \n\n\nchromatography. The coupling reaction is often the formation of salts using an enantiomerically pure acid or base. The diasteromeric derivatives may then be converted to the pure enantiomers by cleavage of the added chiral residue. The racemic mixture of the compounds can also be separated directly by chromatographic methods utilizing chiral stationary phases, which methods are well known in the art. Alternatively, any enantiomer of a compound may be obtained by stereoselective synthesis using optically pure starting materials or reagents of known \n\n\nconfiguration by methods well known in the art. \n\n\n The present invention also includes all pharmaceutically acceptable isotopic variations of a compound of the Formula I in which one or more atoms is replaced by atoms having the same atomic number, but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. \n\n\n Examples of isotopes suitable for inclusion in the compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen such as 2H and 3H, carbon such as 1 C, 13c and 14 , nitrogen such as 3 and 15N, oxygen such as 15o, 17\n(\n3 and 1^0, phosphorus such as 32p\ns\n sulfur such as 35s, fluorine such as l $F, iodine such as 23j and 125i\n9\n and chlorine such as 60. \n\n\n Certain isotopically-labelled compounds of Formula I, for example those incorporating a radioactive isotope, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution studies. The radioactive isotopes tritium, i.e. H, and carbon-14, i.e. 1 C, are particularly useful for this purpose in view of their ease of incorporation and ready means of detection. \n\n Substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e. 2H, may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements, and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Substitution with positron emitting isotopes, such as 1 lC, l $F, 15o and ^Ή, can be useful in Positron Emission Topography (PET) studies for examining substrate receptor occupancy. \n\n\nIsotopically-labelled compounds of Formula I can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the accompanying Examples using appropriate isotopically-labelled reagents in place of the non- labelled reagent previously employed. \n\n\n The invention is described using the following definitions unless otherwise indicated. \n\n\n The term \"halogen\" or \"halo\" includes F, CI, Br, and I. \n\n\n The term \"alkyl\" means linear or branched structures and combinations thereof, having the indicated number of carbon atoms.

C3- galkynyl, for example, includes propynyl, 1-methylethynyl, butynyl and the like. \n\n\n The term \"cycloalkyl\" means mono-, bi- or tri-cyclic structures, optionally combined with linear or branched structures, the indicated number of carbon atoms. Examples of cycloalkyl groups include cyclopropyl, cyclopentyl, cycloheptyl, adamantyl, \n\n\ncyclododecylmethyl, 2-ethyl-l- bicyclo[4.4.0]decyl, and the like. \n\n\n The term \"aryl\" is defined as a mono- or bi-cyclic aromatic ring system and includes, for example, phenyl, naphthyl, and the like. \n\n\n The term \"aralkyl\" means an alkyl group as defined above of 1 to 6 carbon atoms with an aryl group as defined above substituted for one of the alkyl hydrogen atoms, for example, benzyl and the like. \n\n The term \"aryloxy\" means an aryl group as defined above attached to a molecule by an oxygen atom (aryl-O) and includes, for example, phenoxy, naphthoxy and the like. \n\n\n The term \"aralkoxy\" means an aralkyl group as defined above attached to a molecule by an oxygen atom (aralkyl-O) and includes, for example, benzyloxy, and the like. \n\n\n The term \"arylthio\" is defined as an aryl group as defined above attached to a molecule by a sulfur atom (aryl-S) and includes, for example, thiophenyoxy, thionaphthoxy and the like. \n\n\n The term \"aroyl\" means an aryl group as defined above attached to a molecule by an carbonyl group (aryl-C(O)-) and includes, for example, benzoyl, naphthoyl and the like. \n\n\n The term \"aroyloxy\" means an aroyl group as defined above attached to a molecule by an oxygen atom (aroyl-O) and includes, for example, benzoyloxy or benzoxy, naphthoyloxy and the like. \n\n\n The term \"HET\", such as in \"HET*\", \"HET2\", \"ΗΕΤ3\", \"HET4\",\"HETi \", \"HET2\", \"HET3\", \"HET4\" is defined as a 5- to 10-membered aromatic, partially aromatic or non-aromatic mono- or bicyclic ring, containing 1-4 heteroatoms selected from O, S and N, and optionally substituted with 1-2 oxo groups. Where applicable, the Het group shall be defined to include the N-oxide.

FAAH inhibitors are useful in the treatment of a variety of painful syndromes, diseases, disorders and/or conditions, including but not limited to those characterized by non-inflammatory pain, inflammatory pain, peripheral neuropathic pain, central pain, deafferentiation pain, chronic nociceptive pain, stimulus of nociceptive receptors, phantom and transient acute pain. \n\n\n Inhibition of FAAH activity can also be used in the treatment of a variety of conditions involving inflammation. These conditions include, but are not limited to arthritis (such as rheumatoid arthritis, shoulder tendonitis or bursitis, gouty arthritis, and aolymyalgia rheumatica), organ-specific inflammatory diseases (such as thyroiditis, hepatitis, \n\n\ninflammatory bowel diseases), asthma, other autoimmune diseases (such as multiple sclerosis), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), allergic rhinitis, and \n\n\ncardiovascular diseases. \n\n\n In some cases, FAA H inhibitors are useful in preventing neurodegeneration or for neuroprotection. \n\n\n In addition, it has been shown that when FAAH activity is reduced or absent, one of its substrates, anandamide, acts as a substrate for COX-2, which converts anandamide to prostamides (Weber et al., J Lipid, Res. 2004; 45:757). Concentrations of certain prostamides may be elevated in the presence of a FAAH inhibitor. Certain prostamides are associated with reduced intraocular pressure and ocular hypotensivity. Thus, in one embodiment, FAAH inhibitors may be useful for treating glaucoma. \n\n\n In some embodiments, FAAH inhibitors can be used to treat or reduce the risk of EMDs, which include, but are not limited to, obesity, appetite disorders, overweight, cellulite, Type I and Type II diabetes, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, steatohepatitis, liver steatosis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, Syndrome X, insulin resistance, diabetic \n\n\ndyslipidemia, anorexia, bulimia, anorexia nervosa, hyperlipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, inflammatory disorders or conditions, Alzheimer's disease, Crohn's disease, vascular inflammation, inflammatory bowel disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, thrombosis, or cachexia. \n\n\n In other embodiments, FAAH inhibitors can be used to treat or reduce the risk of insulin resistance syndrome and diabetes, i.e., both primary essential diabetes such as Type I Diabetes or Type II Diabetes and secondary nonessential diabetes. Administering a composition containing a therapeutically effective amount of an in vivo FAAH inhibitor reduces the severity of a symptom of diabetes or the risk of developing a symptom of diabetes, such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, liver steatosis, nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy, foot ulceration, or cataracts. \n\n In another embodiment, FAAH inhibitors can be used to treat food abuse behaviors, especially those liable to cause excess weight, e.g., bulimia, appetite for sugars or fats, and non-insulin-dependent diabetes. \n\n\n In some embodiments, FAAH inhibitors can be used to treat a subject \n\n\nsuffering from an EMD and also suffers from a depressive disorder or from an anxiety disorder. Preferably, the subject is diagnosed as suffering from the depressive or psychiatric disorder prior to administration of the FAAH inhibitor composition. Thus, a dose of a \n\n\nFAAH inhibitor that is therapeutically effective for both the EMD and the depressive or anxiety disorder is administered to the subject. \n\n\n Preferably, the subject to be treated is human. However, the methods can also be used to treat non-human mammals. Animal models of EMDs such as those described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,946,491 are particularly useful. \n\n\n FAAH inhibitor compositions can also be used to decrease body- weight in individuals wishing to decrease their body weight for cosmetic, but not necessarily medical considerations. \n\n\n It will be appreciated that when using any combination described herein, both the FAAH compound of the present invention and the other active agent(s) will be administered to a patient, within a reasonable period of time. The compounds may be in the same \n\n\npharmaceutically acceptable carrier and therefore administered simultaneously. They may be in separate pharmaceutical carriers such as conventional oral dosage forms which are taken simultaneously. The term \"combination\" also refers to the case where the compounds are provided in separate dosage forms and are administered sequentially. Therefore, by way of example, one active component may be administered as a tablet and then, within a reasonable period of time, the second active component may be administered either as an oral dosage form such as a tablet or a fast-dissolving oral dosage form. By a \"fast dissolving oral formulation\" is meant, an oral delivery form which when placed on the tongue of a patient, dissolves within about 10 seconds. By \"reasonable period of time\" is meant a time period that is not in excess of about 1 hour. That is, for example, if the first active component is provided as a tablet, then within one hour, the second active component should be administered, either in the same type of dosage form, or another dosage form which provides effective delivery of the medicament. \n\n\n A FAAH inhibitor composition can be administered in combination with a drug for lowering circulating cholesterol levels (e.g., statins, niacin, fibric acid derivatives, or bile acid binding resins). FAAH inhibitor compositions can also be used in combination with a weight loss drug, e.g., orlistat or ah appetite suppressant such as diethylpropion, mazindole, orlistat, phendimetrazine, phentermine, or sibutramine. \n\n\n The term \"treating\" encompasses not only treating a patient to relieve the patient of the signs and symptoms of the disease or condition but also prophylactically treating an asymptomatic patient to prevent the onset of the disease or condition or preventing, slowing or \n\n reversing the progression of the disease or condition. The term \"amount effective for treating\" is intended to mean that amount of a drug or pharmaceutical agent that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue, a system, animal or human that is being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician.

The present invention is meant to comprehend such possible diastereomers as well as their racemic and resolved, enantiomerically pure forms and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. \n\n\n Some of the compounds described herein contain olefinic double bonds, and unless specified otherwise, are meant to include both E arid Z geometric isomers. \n\n\n The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise a compound of Formula I as an active ingredient or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, thereof, and may also contain a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and optionally other therapeutic ingredients. The term \"pharmaceutically acceptable salts\" refers to salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic bases including inorganic bases and organic bases. Salts derived from inorganic bases include aluminum, ammonium, calcium, copper, ferric, ferrous, lithium, \n\n magnesium, manganic salts, manganous, potassium, sodium, zinc, and the like. Particularly preferred are the ammonium, calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium salts. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable organic non-toxic bases include salts of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines, and basic ion exchange resins, such as arginine, betaine, caffeine, choline, Ν,Ν'- dibenzylethylenediamine, diethylamine, 2-diethylaminoethanol, 2-dimethylammoethanol, ethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N-ethyl-morpholine, N-ethylpiperidine, glucamine, glucosamine, histidine, hydrabamine, isopropylamine, lysine, methylglucamine, morpholine, piperazine, piperidine, polyamine resins, procaine, purines, theobromine, triethylamine, trimethylamine, tripropylamine, tromethamine, and the like. \n\n\n When the compound of the present invention is basic, salts may be prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic acids, including inorganic and organic acids. Such acids include acetic, benzenesulfonic, benzoic, camphorsulfonic, citric, ethanesulfonic, fumaric, gluconic, glutamic, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, isethionic, lactic, maleic, malic, mandelic, methanesulfonic, mucic, nitric, pamoic, pantothenic, phosphoric, succinic, sulfuric, tartaric, p- toluenesulfonic acid, and the like. Particularly preferred are citric, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, maleic, phosphoric, sulfuric, and tartaric acids. \n\n\n It will be understood that in the discussion of methods of treatment which follows, references to the compounds of Formula I are meant to also include the pharmaceutically acceptable salts. \n\n\n The magnitude of prophylactic or therapeutic dose of a compound of Formula I will, of course, vary with the nature and the severity of the condition to be treated and with the particular compound of Formula I and its route of administration. It will also vary according to a variety of factors including the age, weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination and response of the individual patient. In general, the daily dose from about 0.001 mg to about 100 mg per kg body weight of a mammal, preferably 0.01 mg to about 10 mg per kg. On the other hand, it may be necessary to use dosages outside these limits in some cases. \n\n\n The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. For example, a formulation intended for oral administration to humans may contain from about 0.5 mg to about 5 g of active agent compounded with an appropriate and convenient amount of carrier material which may vary from about 5 to about 95 percent of the total composition. Dosage unit forms will generally contain from about 1 mg to about 2 g of an active ingredient, typically 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg, 400 mg, 500 mg, 600 mg, 800 mg, or lOOO mg. \n\n\n For the treatment of F AAH mediated diseases the compound of Formula I may be administered orally, topically, parenterally, by inhalation spray or rectally in dosage unit \n\n formulations containing conventional non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants and vehicles. The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intrastemal injection or infusion techniques. In addition to the treatment of warmblooded animals such as mice, rats, horses, cattle, sheep, dogs, cats, etc., the compound of the invention is effective in the treatment of humans. \n\n\n The pharmaceutical compositions containing the active ingredient may be in a form suitable for oral use, for example, as tablets, troches, lozenges, solutions, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, syrups or elixirs. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents, flavouring agents, colouring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations. Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. These excipients may be for example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, for example, corn starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, for example starch, gelatin or acacia, and lubricating agents, for example, magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed. They may also be coated by the technique described in the U.S. Patent 4,256,108, 4,166,452, and 4,265,874 to form osmotic therapeutic tablets for control release. \n\n\n Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredients is mixed with water-miscible solvents such as propylene glycol, PEGs and ethanol, or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil. \n\n\n Aqueous suspensions contain the active material in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are suspending agents, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents may be a naturally-occurring phosphatide, for example lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example \n\n\nheptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol \n\n anhydrides, for example polyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives, for example ethyl, or n-propyl, p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more colouring agents, one or more flavouring agents, and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose, saccharin or aspartame. \n\n\n Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set forth above, and flavouring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid. \n\n\n Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavouring and colouring agents, may also be present. \n\n\n The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of an oil-in-water emulsion. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, for example olive oil or arachis oil, or a mineral oil, for example liquid paraffin or mixtures of these. Suitable emulsifying agents may be naturally-occurring phosphatides, for example soy bean, lecithin, and esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example sorbitan monooleate, and condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, for example \n\n\npol oxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The emulsions may also contain sweetening and flavouring agents. \n\n\n Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, for example glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol, or sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a preservative, flavouring, and colouring agents. The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1 ,3-butane diol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, and isotonic sodium chloride solution. Cosolvents such as ethanol, propylene glycol, or polyethylene glycols may also be used. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables. \n\n\n The compounds of Formula I may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by \n\n mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ambient temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials are cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols. \n\n\n For topical use, creams, ointments, gels, solutions or suspensions, etc., containing a compound of Formula I are employed. (For purposes of this application, topical application shall include mouth washes and gargles.) Topical formulations may generally be comprised of a pharmaceutical carrier, cosolvent, emulsifier, penetration enhancer, preservative system, and emollient. ASSAYS \n\n\n The following assays illustrate the utility of the invention: \n\n\n The compounds of the invention underwent pharmacological evaluations to determine their inhibitory effect on the en2yme FAAH (Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase). \n\n\n To assist in assay development stable cell lines for human, murine and rat full length FAAH were developed. Human FAAH cDNA (Accession No: NMJ301441.1 ) was purchased from Origene (Rockville, MD). The full length FAAH was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector, pcDEF.neo, using Xbal and EcoRl restriction sites and used for stable cell line generation. \n\n\nConstruct Sequence \n\n\n Full length rodent FAAH CAAGGTACCGCCACCATGGTGCTGAGCGAAGTGTGG Full length murine FAAH 2 CCGGAATTCTCAAGATGGCCGCTTTTCAGG \n\n\nFull length rat FAAH 3 CCGGAATTCTCACGATGGCTGCTTTTGAGG \n\n\nMurine (accession number NM_010173) and Rat FAAH (accession number\n\n\nNM_024132) was amplified by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from brain cDNA (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) using primers 1 and 2 or primers 1 and 3 respectively (see Table). The resulting PCR product was ligated into pCR4 TOPO and DNA sequence confirmed. The full length murine FAAH was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector, pcDEFneo using either EcoRI (murine) or Kpnl and EcoRI (rat) restriction sites. Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) were transfected following manufacturers protocol (AMAXA). Forty eight hours post transfection, cells were trypsinized and transferred to 96 well plates in Iscove's DMEM media supplemented with 2mM Glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mg ml geneticin and HT Supplement (0.1 mM sodium hypoxanthine, 0.016 mM thymidine) in order to isolate single clones. Following selection in geneticin, individual clones were selected and FAAH activity was assessed using a whole cell fluorescent anandamide assay, modified from Ramarao et al (2005). Following removal of tissue culture media cells were dislodged following addition of Cellstripper (Mediatech, Inc. Manassas, VA) and transferred to 96 well black clear \n\n bottom assay plate, centrifuged at l,000rpm for 3mins and media removed and replaced with assay buffer (50mM Tris pH8.0, ImM EDTA, 0.1% fatty acid free BSA). The reaction was initiated by addition of fluorescent substrate, AMC Arachidonoyl Amide (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, Michigan) to 1 μΜ and reaction allowed to proceed for 2 hours at room temperature. Release of fluorescence was monitored in a CytoFluor Multiplate Reader. Cells expressing the highest amount of FAAH activity were selected for study with FAAH inhibitors. \n\n\nPreparation of lysate and microsomes \n\n\n CHO cells expressing FAAH were used to prepare either crude cell lysate or microsome fractions. To harvest cells, tissue culture media was decanted, the monolayer washed three times with Ca\n++\nMg\n++\n free PBS and cells recovered after 15 min in enzyme free dissociation media (Millipore Corp, Billerica, MA). Cells were collected by centrifuging at 2000 rpm for 15 min. and the cell pellet re-suspended with 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) containing ImM EDTA and the protease inhibitors aprotinin (1 mg/ml) and leupeptin (100 μΜ). The suspension was sonicated at 4°C and the cell lysate recovered after centrifuging at 12,000xg (14,600rpm, SS34 rotor) for 20 min at 4°C to fonn a crude pellet of cell debris, nuclei, peroxisomes, lysosomes, and mitochondria; the supernatant or cell lysate was used for FAAH enzyme assay. In some cases, microsomes fractions enriched in FAAH were prepared by centrifuging the cell lysate further at 27,000 rpm (100,000 x g) in SW28 rotor for 50 minutes at 4°C. The pellet containing FAAH- enriched microsomes was re-suspend in 50 mM HEPES, (pH 7,4) 1 mM EDTA, and any remaining DNA sheared by passage of material through a 23 gauge needle and aliquots of enzyme were store at -80°C prior to use. \n\n\nFAAH assays \n\n\n Several assays have been used to demonstrate the inhibitory activity. Enzyme activity was demonstrated in a radioenzymatic test based on measuring the product of hydrolysis (ethanolamine [ H]) of anandamide [ethanolamine sup.3H] (American Radiolabeled \n\n\nChemicals; lmCi/ml) with FAAH (Life Sciences (1995), 56, 1999-2005 and Journal of \n\n\nPharmacology and Experimented Therapeutics (1997), 283, 729-734), Analytical, Biochemistry (2003), 318, 270-5. In addition, routine assays were performed monitoring hydrolysis of arachidonyl-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin amide (AAMCA) by following increase in fluorescence upon release of 7-amino 4-methyl cournarin ( EX= 355 iim, (X\nE\nM =460 nm), Analytical, \n\n\nBiochemistry (2005), 343, 143-51 \n\n\n Assays are performed on either cell lysate or microsome fractions prepared as described or in whole cell format employing either the fluorescent substrate AAMCA (Cayman chemical, Ann Arbor, MI,) or \n3\nH-anandmaide ([ETHANOLAMINE- 1-3H] American \n\n\nRadiolabeled Chemicals; lmCi/ml). The cell lysate or microsome assay is performed in Costar black wall, clear bottom plates by adding FAAH CHO (whole cell, cell lysate or microsome) in \n\n assay buffer (50 mM Phosphate, pH 8.0, Ϊ mM EDTA, 200 mM KCl, 0.2% glycerol, 0.1% fatty acid free BSA) to each well, followed by either DMSO or compound and allowed to incubate at 22~25°C for fifteen minutes. AAMCA substrate was used to achieve a final concentration of 1 μΜ and reaction allowed to proceed at room temperature for 1-3 hours. Fluorescent release as a measure of FA AH activity was monitored by reading the plate in a CytoFluor Multiplate Reader (Ex: 360/40nM; Em: 460/40nM). Whole cell assay is conducted with cells harvested after rinsing tissue culture flasks three times with Ca^Mg^ free PBS, incubating for 10 min in Enzyme free dissociation media and centrifuging for Sminutes at l,000rpm in table top centrifuge. Cells are resuspended in assay buffer at desired cell number in (4 l0\n4\ncells/assay in 96-well format; lxl0\n4\ncells/assay in 384-well format) and assayed as described. \n\n\n Alternatively, assays are performed using anandamide [ethanolamine l-.sup.3H] (specific activity of 10 Ci/mmol) diluted with cold anandamide to achieve a final assay concentration of 1 μΜ anandamide (-50,000 cpm). Enzyme (CHO cell lysate, brain or liver homogenate) is incubated in assay buffer (50 mM Phosphate, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 200 mM KCl, 0.2% glycerol, 0.1 % fatty acid free BSA) with inhibitor at 25°C for 30 minutes. The reaction was terminated by addition of 2 volumes of chloroform: methanol (1 :1) and mixed by vortexing. Following a centrifugation step, 2000 rpm for 10 min. at room temperature, the aqueous phase containing the released \n3\nH-ethanolamide was recovered and quantitated by liquid scintillation as a reflection of FAAH enzyme activity. \n\n\nRamarao M.K., et al.

A 50pe catheter is placed in the femoral vein for collecting blood samples. Another rat is orally adminstrated with an unlabeled fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitor 2 hr prior to injection of radiotracer to demonstrate non-specific binding and dose occupancy. 1 mCi/rat of an ^C labeled FAAH inhibitor is injected via its tail vein, and the catheters flushed with several mLs of normal saline. One rat is scanned at a time. \n\n Acquisition of images is started as the radiotracer was injected. Images are acquired for 90 minutes and the rat is subsequently euthanized with sodium pentobarbital. Regions of interest (ROIs) are drawn on the summed image which includes the brain, then used to analyze the count rates in subsequent images. Count-rates are converted to %-dose/ROI by dividing the count-rate in the ROI by that of the whole rat, which is then multiplied by 100. \n\n\n At the time of injection, blood is collected from the femoral catheter and two drops of blood is collected into each tube for the first two minutes, then 300 microliter samples of blood are taken for metabolite correction and determination of radioactivity in plasma and whole blood at 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 90 minutes. 300 microliter plasma samples are taken for plasma drug concentration determinations from the rat preinjected with the unlabeled fatty acid amide hydrolase inhibitor right before the injection of PET tracer and after 90 minutes scanning. \n\n\nPET Imaging in Rhesus Monkey: \n\n\n A fasted Rhesus monkey (7 - 11 kg) is anesthetized with ketamine I.M. (15 mpk) and the monkey is placed in the PET camera bed. An IV. catheter is inserted into the right saphenous vein. For arterial sampling, the right femoral area is aseptically prepared and an arterial catheter is placed and fixed with sutures. Subsequent anesthesia is maintained with Isofiurane. The animal is intubated and placed on Isofiurane (2 - 2.5 %) with ventilated medical grade compressed air at approximately 23 respirations per minute for the duration of the study. The I:E ratio, volume and rate of respiration is adjusted to maintain C02 levels ~40mmHg and Sp02 levels 95 to 100%. A temperature probe, pulse oximeter, and end tidal CO2 monitor are connected. Body temperature is maintained by placing the animal on a K-module heating pad and placing another pad on top and the animal is positioned inside the camera gantry supine, head first. General fluid therapy is maintained with 1 ml/min Lactated Ringer's IV throughout study. An aliquot of \n¾ I\nC labeled FAAH inhibitor is injected IV with emission imaging begining at the time of injection and continuing for 90 minutes. \n\n\n Whole blood samples are collected via arterial catheter into Heparin tubes for determination of radioactivity in whole blood and plasma. Samples are centrifuged and 20 ul whole blood and plasma are counted 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 seconds post PET ligand injection. Samples of blood (0.5 ml) are taken for metabolite correction and determination of radioactivity in plasma and whole blood at 3, 5, 15, 30, 60, and 90 minutes. \n\n\n In a separate experiment, a fasted rhesus monkey is orally dosed with an unlabeled FAAH inhibitor (vehicle; Imwitor/Tween) 21 hr prior to injection of radiotracer. A plasma sample (1 ml) is taken for plasma drug concentration determinations at 20.5, 21, 22, 22.5 hr. At 21 hr, an aliquot of \nn\nC labeled FAAH inhibitor is injected IV and emission imaging begins at the time of injection and continues for 90 minutes following the same protocol as above. Occupancy is detennined by comparing tracer binding in various regions of the brain after dosing with the \n\n FAAH inhibitor, to tracer binding in the same regions of the brain in the absence of FAAH inhibitor. \n\n\nCombination Study \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound A Etoricoxib \n\n\nStandard isobolographic analysis methods (Tallarida et al. 1989) were used to assess whether the FAAH inhibitor Compound A demonstrates additive or synergistic interaction when co-dosed with etoricoxib in the Complete Freunds Adjuvant model of inflammatory pain in the rat (Eid et al. 2008). Etoricoxib and Compound A were tested in PO dose ratios of 1 :1, 0.3:1, and 3:1. \n\n\n Overall, the data demonstrate that there is not a significant difference between the observations recorded and the predicted line of additivity (Figure 1). Therefore these data indicate that etoricoxib and the FAAH inhibitor compound A are additive in the their analgesic effect against inflammatory pain. \n\n\nTallarida R.J., et al.

Description\n\n\n\n\n Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors \n\n\nField of the Invention \n\n\n The present invention relates to carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, their use in medicine including cancer treatment, pharmaceutical compositions containing such inhibitors and inhibitors for use in diagnosis or imaging. \n\n\nBackground of the Invention \n\n\n As some solid cancer tumours grow in cancer patients, hypoxic regions may be formed, particularly in the interior of the tumour. These hypoxic regions therefore tend not to be associated with a blood supply. Hypoxic cancer cells represent a danger to cancer patients because there is an increased tendency for hypoxic tumour micro environments to stimulate metastatic progression and because hypoxic tumour cells have increased resistance to treatment. Chemotherapeutic agents have problems reaching the cells from the blood supply and the hypoxia itself protects cells against radiotherapy because oxygen is necessary for the cytotoxic action of radiation-generated free radicals. Tumour hypoxia is therefore generally associated with poor prognosis for cancer patients. \n\n\nCarbonic anhydrases (CAs) are widespread zinc metalloenzymes found in higher vertebrates including humans. 16 isozymes have been characterised to date, many of which are involved in critical physiological processes. They catalyse the following reaction: C0\n2\n+H\n2\n0=H\n+\n+HC0\n3\n \n\"\n. In humans, CAs are present in a large variety of tissues including the gastrointestinal tract, the reproductive tract, the nervous system, kidneys, lungs, skin and eyes. The different isozymes are localised in different parts of the cell with CA I and CA II, important isozymes in normal cells, being localised in the cytosol. \n\n\nThe gene expression profile of a hypoxic cancer cell is different from that of other cancer cells in a normally-oxygenated environment (\"normoxic conditions\"). Under hypoxic conditions, transcription factor HIFa is sufficiently stable to give rise to hypoxia-induced gene expression. One consequence of this is that the distribution of isoforms of carbonic anhydrase (CA) is altered in hypoxic tumour cells as compared with normoxic cells. As a result, CA isozymes IX \n\n and XII are found to be overexpressed in hypoxic tumour cells. These isozymes have therefore become known as potential targets for anti-tumour therapy and imaging. \n\n\nUnlike many CAs, CA IX and CA XII are both extracellularly localised on hypoxic tumour cells. These enzymes play a role in carbon fixation which may aid the growth of the tumour cells and also in acidification of the cells' micro environment. They are therefore thought to provide a target for cancer therapy because they are relatively specific to the hypoxic tumour cells and appear to be important in the survival and proliferation of those cells. \n\n\nEfforts have been made to find inhibitors which are specific for CA IX and/or CA XII. CA IX is known to be a particularly catalytically efficient isozyme, having a k\nca\nt— 5.5xl0^s ' whereas CA XII has catalytic activity of one order of magnitude lower. A consequence of this is that for inhibitors to be effective they must have relatively low inhibition constants (Ki of the order of nanomolar). Furthermore, for such inhibitors to be useful, they must also be relatively specific for CA IX/CA XII as compared to the CA isozymes which are usually found distributed intracellularly in normal cells such as CA II. Winum et al describe in \"Anti-Cancer Agents in Medicinal Chemistry, 2009, 9, 693-702\" a variety of different CA IX inhibitors. The most widely studied CA IX inhibitors are those in the sulphonamide series, typically having the formula R-Ar-S0\n2\nNH\n2\n. Therapeutic and diagnostic agents which are sulphonamides are described in WO2006/137092 and sulphonamide-based metal chelate complexes for imaging are described in WO2009/089383. Great variation is reported in the CA IX inhibiton constants for the sulphonamides as well as variation in the selectivity of the inhibitors. Sulphamate and sulphamide inhibitors have also been proposed in Winum et al. The best CA IX inhibitor was 4-chlorophenyl sulphamate. However, the usefulness of such an inhibitor for practical purposes as a pharmaceutically-active compound is limited because it is relatively unstable in solution. \n\n\nThere is a need in this art for new inhibitors for CA IX and CA XII for use in pharmaceutical applications including cancer therapy, diagnosis and imaging. \n\n\nSummary of the Invention \n\n Accordingly, in a first aspect, the present invention provides a carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) inhibitor which comprises a compound of general formula: \n\n\nR-NH-CX-NH-(CH\n2\n)\nn\n-Ar-Q-S0\n2\n-NH\n2\n \n\n\nor a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt, derivative or prodrug thereof; wherein \n\n\nn = 0, 1 or 2; \n\n\nQ is O or NH; \n\n\nX is O or S; and \n\n\n R comprises an organic substituent group. \n\n\nIt has surprisingly been found that carbonic anhydrase inhibitors according to the invention are potent inhibitors of CA IX and selective for CA IX over CA II. The inhibitors may also inhibit CA XII. Although the inhibitors are sulphamates (Q=0) or sulphamides (Q=NH), they have been found to be relatively stable, particularly in solution, thereby enabling them to be used on a practical level in pharmaceutical compositions. \n\n\nCarbonic anhydrases are thought to have a catalytic mechanism which relies upon an active site which contains a coordinated zinc ion. Inhibitors of the type according to the present invention are thought to act by forming an adduct between the zinc ion and the terminal nitrogen. The rest of the inhibitor molecule is accommodated in a binding pocket of the carbonic anhydrase enzyme which widens out to some extent as distance increases from the zinc ion. As a result, the binding pocket can accommodate a relatively wide variation in the organic substituent group R. The organic substituent group, which does not include H, may be aliphatic or aromatic and may include one or more heteroatoms. It is preferred that R is bulky and so short linear hydrocarbon groups are not preferred. Cyclic groups are preferred although acyclic groups having from 1 to 18 carbon atoms, including linear and/or branched chain, may be used as the organic substituent group. \n\n\nThe organic substituent group preferably comprises a substituted or unsubstituted cyclic substituent, which may be carbocyclic or heterocyclic. In one arrangement, the cyclic substituent comprises an aromatic substituent. Typically, the aromatic substituent has the formula Ar'-(CH\n2\n)\nP\n- in which Ar' is a substituted or unsubstituted aromatic ring or ring system having up to 3 fused rings; p may be 0, 1 or 2 thereby allowing up to two methylene groups to \n\n link the aromatic ring or ring system to the rest of the molecule. Many of the Ar' groups which have been found to be effective have a single aromatic ring such as a phenyl ring, thiophenyl ring or pyridyl or other 5-/6-membered heterocycles. Larger ring systems include naphthyl, benzofuranyl and benzodioxinyl. Alternatively, the aromatic substituent may have the formula Ar'R'-CH- in which R' is Me and Ar' is the same or different and is a substituted or unsubstituted aromatic ring or ring system as above. As a further alternative, R' and Ar' are each Ph wherein each Ph is the same or different and is substituted or unsubstituted. \n\n\nThe aromatic ring of the aromatic substituent may be substituted or unsubstituted. Typically, up to three substituents may be borne by each ring or ring system and these substituents include F, CI, Br, I, CN, MeO, Ph, PhO, PhCH\n2\n, N0\n2\n, Me\n2\nN, Me, Et0\n2\nC, Ac, EtO, iPr, MeS and EtOOC. Aromatic substituents which have been found to be particularly effective may be selected from 4-F-C\n6\nH\n4\n, 4-Cl-C\n6\nH\n4\n, 4-Br-C\n6\nH\n4\n, 4-I-C\n6\nH\n4\n, 2,4,I\n2\n-CH\n6\nH\n3\n, 2,4,6,I\n3\n-C\n6\nH\n2\n, 4-NC- C\n6\nH\n4\n, 4-MeO-C\n6\nH\n4\n, 4-Ph-C\n6\nH\n4\n , 4-PhO-C\n6\nH\n4\n, C\n6\nF\n5\n, 4-PhCH\n2\n-C\n6\nH\n4\n, 4-PhCH\n2\nCH\n2\nC\n6\nH\n4\n, 4-0\n2\nN-C\n6\nH\n4\n, 4-Me\n2\nN-C\n6\nH\n4\n, 2,3,4-F\n3\nC\n6\nH\n2\n, 3,5-Me\n2\nC\n6\nH\n3\n, 4-Et0\n2\nC-C\n6\nH\n4\n, 1 -naphthyl, 2-Br-4,6- F\n2\nC\n6\nH\n2\n, 2,4,6-Cl\n3\nC\n6\nH\n2\n, Ph, 3,4-Cl\n2\nC\n6\nH\n3\n, 3-Cl-C\n6\nH , 2,4-F\n2\nC\n6\nH\n3\n, 2-Me-4-MeO-C\n6\nH\n3\n, 2-Ph- C\n6\nH\n4\n, 2-PhO-C\n6\nH\n4\n, 3-PhO-C\n6\nH\n4\n, 4-Ac-C\n6\nH\n4j\n 3-Ac-C\n6\nH\n4\n, 4-PhCH\n2\n0-C\n6\nH\n4,\n 2-MeO-5-Me-C\n6\nH\n3\n, 2-EtO-C\n6\nH\n4\n, 4-MeC\n6\nH\n4\n-CH\n2\n, Ph\n2\nCH, 4-iPr-C\n6\nH\n4\n, 2-iPr-C\n6\nH\n4\n, fluoren-9-yl, 3-MeS-C\n6\nH\n4\n, 2- naphthyl, 2-EtOOC- C\n6\nH\n4\n, 3-(2,3-dihydrobenzofuran-5-yl), 3-EtOOC- C\n6\nH\n4\n, 2-NC-C\n6\nH\n4\n, 1- naphthyl-CH\n2\nCH\n2,\n thiophen-2-yl-CH\n2\nCH\n2\n, 3-(2,3-dihydro-benzo[l,4]dioxin-6-yl), furan-2-yl, 1-naphthyl-Me-CH, 3-N0\n2\n-C\n6\nH\n4\n, 2, 4(MeO)\n2\n-C\n6\nH\n4\n, 2-Me-4Cl-C\n6\nH\n3\n, Ph-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n, 4-BuO- C\n6\nH\n4\n, Ph-CH\n2\n, 2-Me-C\n6\nH\n4\n, 2-Cl-C\n6\nH\n4\n, 4-HCOO-C\n6\nH\n4\n, pyridin-2-yl-methyl/ethyl and pyridin- 4-yl-methyl-ethyl . \n\n\nAccording to a further arrangement, the cyclic substituent may comprise an alicyclic substituent. This alicylic substituent may be substituted or unsubstituted and may be saturated or unsaturated. The alicyclic substituent may have a single ring or may have a plurality of fused rings. Preferably, the alicyclic substituent is substituted or unsubstituted 1- or 2- adamantyl, N-Boc-piperidin-4-yl, substituted or unsubstituted cyclohexyl, or substituted or unsubstituted piperazine-methy 1/ ethyl . \n\n In a further arrangement, the organic substituents may comprise a charged moiety such as substituted pyridinium, piperidinium, or piperazinium or tetralkylammonium. Where the organic substituent is charged, this confers on the inhibitor a further advantage. A charged inhibitor cannot readily cross the cell membrane and so is prevented from penetrating the intracellular space. Such inhibitors are less likely to be metabolised before they reach their target cells because they will not enter the intracellular space of other cells, such as those surrounding the target cells. Such inhibitors are also selective for extracellular CAs because they will not enter the cells and bind to the intracellular CAs. Since aerobic/normoxic cells do not express extracellular drug-binding CA's the inhibitor will be able to diffuse freely through the aerobic region close to blood vessels without being bound there, and reach into the hypoxic regions. \n\n\nThe Ar group of the carbonic anhydrase inhibitors of the present invention denotes an aromatic group which typically has a single ring or two fused rings. The Ar group may be carbocyclic or heterocyclic and may be substituted or unsubstituted. Typically, small substituents are preferred such as Me, Et, OH, MeO, F, CI, Br, I and CN. Whether or not the Ar group is substituted, two ring positions are taken up with Q and (CH\n2\n)n (which is a direct bond to the rest of the molecule when n=0). These two ring positions may be at any point on the Ar ring except ortho to one another because of steric constraints. For example, where Ar is a single ring such as phenyl, Q and (CH\n2\n)\nn\n are positioned meta or para to one another (i.e. 1,3 or 1,4). Where Q is para to (CH\n2\n)\nn\n, small substituent groups may be positioned on the ring as described above. Where Q is meta to (CH\n2\n)\nn\n the above substituents may also be positioned on the ring as described above; additionally, in the para position, a larger substituent may be incorporated instead, such as a C I to C5 hydrocarbyl substituent. Preferably, Ar is a substituted or unsubstitued phenylene or naphthalene, more preferably a phenylene group, most preferably paraphenylene. \n\n\nIn the inhibitors of the invention, the group (CH\n2\n)\nn\n acts as a linker between the NH-CX-NH group and the Ar group. Whilst there is some tolerance in the distance between NH-CX-NH and Ar, this is limited and so n is no greater than 2. It is preferred that n=0, thereby denoting a direct bond between NH-CX-NH and Ar. Where Ar is paraphenylene, this gives rise to the following structure: \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n X may be O or S thus denoting a ureido or thioureido group. \n\n\nPreferred sulfamate inhibitors according to the invention have the following general formula: \n\n\n \n\n wherein R denotes the aromatic substituent and is selected from 4-F-C\n6\nH\n4\n, 4-Cl-C\n6\nH\n4\n, 4-Br- C\n6\nH\n4\n, 4-I-C\n6\nH\n4\n, 4-NC-C\n6\nH\n4\n, 4-MeO-C\n6\nH\n4\n, 4-Ph-C\n6\nH\n4\n, 4-PhO-C\n6\nH\n4\n, C\n6\nF\n5\n, 4-PhCH\n2\n-C\n6\nH\n4\n, 4- PhCH\n2\nCH\n2\nC\n6\nH\n4\n, 4-0\n2\nN-C\n6\nH\n4\n, 4-Me\n2\nN-C\n6\nH\n4\n, 2,3,4-F\n3\nC\n6\nH\n2\n, 3,5-Me\n2\nC\n6\nH\n3\n, 4-Et0\n2\nC-C\n6\nH\n4\n, 1- naphthyl, 2-Br-4,6-F\n2\nC\n6\nH\n2\n, 2,4,6-Cl\n3\nC\n6\nH\n2\n, Ph, 3,4-Cl\n2\nC\n6\nH\n3\n, 3-Cl-C\n6\nH\n4\n, 2,4-F\n2\nC\n6\nH\n3\n, 2-Me-4- MeO-C\n6\nH\n3\n, 2-Ph-C\n6\nH\n4\n, 2-PhO-C\n6\nH\n4\n, 3-PhO-C\n6\nH\n4\n, 4-Ac-C\n6\nH\n4;\n 3-Ac-C\n6\nH\n4\n, 4-PhCH\n2\n0-C\n6\nH\n4j\n 2- MeO-5-Me-C\n6\nH\n3\n, 2-EtO-C\n6\nH\n4\n, 4-MeC\n6\nH\n4\n-CH\n2\n, Ph\n2\nCH, 4-iPr-C\n6\nH\n4\n, 2-iPr-C\n6\nH\n4\n, fluoren-9-yl, 3-MeS-C\n6\nH\n4\n, 2-naphthyl, 2-EtOOC- C\n6\nH\n4\n, 3-(2,3-dihydrobenzofuran-5-yl), 3-EtOOC- C\n6\nH\n4\n, 2-NC-C\n6\nH\n4\n, l-naphthyl-CH\n2\nCH\n2>\n thiophen-2-yl-CH\n2\nCH\n2\n, 3-(2,3-dihydro-benzo[l,4]dioxin-6- yl), 1-adamantyl and N-Boc-piperidin-4-yl, pyridin-2-yl-methyl, pyridin-2-yl-ethyl; pyridin-4- yl-methyl-ethyl-, 4-N-methyl-piperazine-methyl/ethyl and the positively charged moieties shown below (A-C): \n\n\n \n\n X = CI, Br, I, methanesulfonate, etc \n\n\n X = CI, Br, I, methanesulfonate, etc \n\n\n A B C \n\n Other preferred sulfamate inhibitors have the formulae 15 to 18 or 20, as set out in Table 3 below. \n\n\nPreferred sulfamides have the formulae 7a to 7p or 8a to 8h as set out in Table 2 below. \n\n\nWhilst various CA IX inhibitors of the prior art have Ki values of the order of micromolar, inhibitors of the present invention have a Ki for CA IX of up to about 150 nM, usually up to about 120 nM and a corresponding Ki for CA XII of up to about 240nM, usually up to about 80 nM. It is preferred that the Ki for CA IX is no greater than 50 nM, more preferably no greater than 30 nM, preferably no greater than 20 nM, more preferably no greater than 10 nM. The selectivity ratio of the inhibitors of the present invention as measured by Ki CA II/ Ki CA IX can be at least 6 and is typically at least 7.5, advantageously at least 10, more advantageously at least 11.5, preferably at least 12.5, more preferably at least 15, still more preferably at least 20, yet still more preferably at least 30, most preferably at least 40 and especially at least 50. As it will be appreciated, the higher the value for the selectivity ratio, the less likely side effects may arise in the use of the inhibitors by virtue of their inhibition of cytosolic CA isozymes in normal cells. \n\n\nTypically, CA inhibition is measured by assaying for CA-catalysed C0\n2\n hydration activity using an appropriate indicator dye. As described in further detail in the specific examples, phenol red may be used as the indicator and this has an absorpent maximum of 557 nm. Stopped flow spectrophotometry may used to measure the rate of hydration activity. \n\n\nIn a further aspect, pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated comprising a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor as described herein or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt, ester, or prodrug thereof optionally incorporating a pharmaceutically-acceptable diluents, excipient or carrier (including combinations thereof). Pharmaceutically-acceptable salts are known in this technical field and include salts with acids or bases which are accepted for the formation of salts for pharmaceutical use. For example, where the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor bears a carboxylic acid group, such pharmaceutically-acceptable salts include those of non-toxic cations such as quarternary ammonium ions, alkali metals such as sodium or potassium and alkaline earth metals such as calcium. Organic bases may also be used, such as ethanolamine, \n\n pyridine, trimethylamine or triethylamine. Alternatively, acid addition salts may be formed by the use of pharmaceutically-acceptable non-toxic acids such as hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, oxalic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, acetic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, carbonic acid or an amino acid. Other materials may be added to the pharmaceutical compositions depending on the intended route of administration to the subject. Such additional materials include solubilising agents, coating agents, lubricants, binders and suspending agents. Non-toxic carriers, diluents and excipients are described in standard textbooks such as Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company. \n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions may contain a prodrug form of the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor which is intended to become active only when metabolised by the subject. Such prodrug forms include esters which can be hydrolyzed in vivo with the formation of the sulfamate/sulfamide inhibitors presented above. \n\n\nThe present invention is not limited in relation to the particular route of administration to the subject. This may depend in part upon which part of the body of the subject needs to be targeted as well as the tolerance of the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor molecule to that particular route of administration. Standard routes of administration include oral, buccal, sublingual, inhalation, topical (including ophthalmic), rectal, vaginal, nasal and parenteral (including intravenous, intraarterial, intramuscular, subcutaneous and intraarticular). \n\n\nThe precise form of pharmaceutical composition and dosage thereof will also be dependent upon the subject to be treated including body weight, route of administration and precise disease conditions. \n\n\nPharmaceutically-acceptable derivatives include esters, amides, salts and nanoparticles based on the sulfamates/sulfamides described herein. \n\n\nAs will be appreciated, inhibitors according to the present invention may be used in medicine, and have particular use in cancer treatment. Whilst treatment of hypoxic cancer tumours is important in itself, a subject with cancer is likely to need additional treatment such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Treatments of the hypoxic tumour alone may account for \n\n approximately 40% reduction in tumour volume. The remaining tumour volume is therefore preferably treated additionally with chemotherapy or radiation therapy appropriate to normoxic cells. Accordingly, in one aspect, the inhibitors according to the invention are provided for use in cancer treatment of a subject who is treated additionally with chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Such inhibitors include compound 3p. \n\n\nA further major problem related to cancer therapy is the formation of distant metastases. These cannot be treated radically with radiotherapy or surgery and therefore systemic chemical treatment is needed. However, chemotherapeutic drugs usually have limited specificity for cancer cells and thus, their use is limited by severe side-effects. Although chemotherapy has a high curative rate for some small groups of patients and some palliative effect for several groups it is curative in less than 5 per cent of cancer patients over-all. The metastases may be detectable at the time of the first diagnosis, but may also appear following successful treatment of the primary tumor with radiotherapy or surgery. Recent data indicate that hypoxia in the primary tumor is a driving force for formation of metastasis (Rofstad E.K.: Microenvironment- induced cancer metastasis. Int. J radiat. Biol. 76; (2000) 589-605). This is well explained with respect to post-treatment effects related to radiotherapy since hypoxic cells are resistant to radiation and therefore may survive that treatment. It has, however been shown that hypoxia can be a negative prognostic factor related to malignant progression even after primary tumor surgery (Hockel M., Schlesinger K., Aral B., Mitze M., Schaffer U., Vaupel P.: Association between tumor hypoxia and malignant progression in advanced cancer of the uterine cervix. Cancer Res. 56; (1996) 4509-4515). Thus, there is a need for a treatment modality which reduces metastasis by specifically killing the hypoxic sub-fraction of cancer cells. A specific effect on the hypoxic sub-population is expected to be cancer specific since tissue hypoxia is specific to solid cancers. Such treatment would be valuable even if it does not have a strong effect on the primary tumor since the localized cancer can often be removed by combination with radical treatments like surgery or radiotherapy. Accordingly a CAIX inhibitor may be used as an anti-metastatic. Preferred CAIX inhibitors are those described herein, such as compound 3p. \n\n\nIn a further aspect, a product is provided comprising a CA IX inhibitor according to the invention and a chemotherapeutic agent as a combined preparation for simultaneous, separate \n\n or sequential use in cancer treatment. In this way, a kit may be provided containing the present inhibitors and further chemotherapeutic agents typically in separate containers. Alternatively, where appropriate, the chemotherapeutic agent and inhibitor may be administered to the subject together. Preferred CA IX inhibitors are those described herein, such as compound 3p. \n\n\nIn a further aspect, the CA IX inhibitors as described herein may be used in the preparation of a medicament for treatment of cancer. \n\n\nThe CA IX inhibitors of the present invention may also be used in methods of diagnosis or imaging. For these applications, the inhibitor typically includes a label appropriate to the particular diagnosis or imaging method. Such labels include fluorescent labels, spin labels, radiolabels or heavy atoms. \n\n\nThe organic substituent R may therefore be tailored to accommodate such labels. If the organic substituent group is itself fluorescent, this may confer upon the inhibitor a fluorescent label suitable for the above methods. An example of such an inhibitor is compound 20 in which the organic substituent comprises a 3-hydroxy-6-oxo-6H-xanthen-9-yl group. In the case of a radiolabel, this may be incorporated in any one of the inhibitors of the present invention. Suitable radioactive isotopes for inclusion in the molecules include the standard nuclides, such is 45 60 61 66 as \n1S\nF, \nn\nC, \n6\n Cu, \nJJm\nTc, etc. as well as the non-standard ones, such as Ti, Cu, Cu, Ga,\n\n\n72 74 76 86 89 94m 124 \n\n\n As, As, Br, Y, Zr, Tc and I \n\n\nWhere a heavy atom such as Zn(II); Cu(II), Co(II); Al(III); Fe(II); Fe(III); Re(VII); Os(VIII), Ru(VIII) is to be incoiporated, this will typically be done by using an organic substituent group which comprises a chelator such as EDTA, DTP A, IDA, cryptates, crown ethers, porphyrins, etc (as for example those describe in A. Scozzafava, L. Menabuoni, F. Mincione, C.T. Supuran, Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. A general approach for the preparation of water soluble sulfonamides incorporating polyamino-polycarboxylate tails and of their metal complexes possessing long lasting, topical intraocular pressure lowering properties. J Med. Chem. 2002, 45, 1466-1476.) \n\n In a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided an imaging composition comprising such CA IX inhibitors and a suitable diluents, excipient or carrier. Such compositions are typically manufactured for injection or per os administration into the subject. \n\n\nBrief Description of the Drawings \n\n\n The present invention will now be described in further detail, by way of example only, with reference to the following examples and accompanying drawings in which: \n\n\n FIGURE 1 shows the structures of sulfamide inhibitors of the present invention; \n\n\n FIGURE 2 shows structures of further sulfamide inhibitors of the present invention; \n\n\n FIGURE 3 shows a graph of tumour volume against time for treatment using a CA IX inhibitor of the present invention; \n\n\n FIGURE 4 shows a graph of tumour volume against time for the treatment comparing CAIX inhibitor 3k with an inert vehicle; \n\n\n FIGURE 5 shows the number of metastatic MDA-231 clonogens within lung tissue comparing CAIX inhibitor 3k with vehicle; \n\n\n FIGURE 6 compares MDA-231 cell migration in inhibitor-treated cells to control cells; \n\n\nFIGURE 7 shows a graph of gap closure against CA IX inhibitors comparing hypoxic and normoxic activity; \n\n\n FIGURE 8 shows gap closure dose response of CA IX inhibitors according to the invention; FIGURE 9 shows effective CA IX inhibitor on spheroid cell growth in presence or absence of doxorubicin or radiation treatment; \n\n\n FIGURE 10 shows CA IX mRNA expression in EV/2 and 94/1 cells under normoxic and hypoxic conditions; \n\n\n FIGURE 11 shows CA IX protein expression levels in EV/2 and 94/1 cells under normoxic and hypoxic conditions; \n\n\n FIGURE 12 shows quantitative fluorescence analysis of a fluorescent CA IX inhibitor binding to EV/2 and 94/1 cells under normoxic, hypoxic and reoxygenated conditions; \n\n\n FIGURE 13 shows quantitative FACS analysis of a fluorescent CA IX inhibitor binding to\n\n\nEV/2 and 94/1 cells under normoxic, hypoxic and reoxygenated conditions; \n\n\n FIGURE 14 shows immunofluorescence analysis of a fluorescent CA IX inhibitor binding to\n\n\nEV/2 and 94/1 cells under normoxic, hypoxic and reoxygenated conditions; \n\n FIGURE 15 shows pixel quantification of immunofluoresence staining of fluorescent CA IX inhibitor binding to EV/2 and 94/1 cells under normoxic, hypoxic and reoxygenated conditions; \n\n\n FIGURE 16 shows the effects of low oxygen conditions on survival of EV/2 and 94/1 cells; FIGURE 17 shows the effect of different doses of irradiation on survival of EV/2 and 94/1 cells under normoxic and anoxic conditions; and \n\n\n FIGURE 18 shows the effect of a CA IX inhibitor according to the invention on the sensitivity of EV/2 and 94/1 cells to irradiation under normoxic and anoxic conditions. \n\n\nDetailed Description of the Invention \n\n\nExamples \n\n\nExample 1 \n\n\n Preparation of ureido-sulfamates with strong CA IX/XII inhibitory activity and antitumor properties \n\n\nChemistry. \n\n\n\n\n\n 3a - 3bh \n\n\nExperimental Section : \n\n\n General. All reagents and solvents were of commercial quality and used without further purification. All reactions were carried out under an inert atmosphere of nitrogen. TLC analyses were performed on silica gel 60 F\n254\n plates (Merck Art.1.05554). Spots were visualized under 254nm UV illumination, or by ninhydrin solution spraying. Melting point were determined on a Buchi Melting Point 510 and are uncorrected. 1H and \nI3\nC NMR spectra \n\n were recorded on Bruker DRX-400 spectrometer using DMSO-i¾ as solvent and tetramethylsilane as internal standard. Electron Ionization mass spectra (30eV) were recorded in positive or negative mode on a Water MicroMass ZQ. \n\n\nPreparation of sulfamates. \n\n\nGeneral Procedure. \n\n\n There are two procedures to achieve the first step depending on the substrate solubility. \n\n\nProcedure A (non soluble)\n\n\n >-aminophenol 2 (1 equiv.) was added to a solution of isocyanate 1 (1 equiv.) in 15-20 ml of acetonitrile. The mixture was stirred at room temperature until complete formation of the product (TLC monitoring). The resulting precipitate was then filtered and washed with ethyl acetate several times. \n\n\nProcedure B (Soluble) \n\n\n ^>-aminophenol 2 (1 equiv.) was added to a solution of isocyanate (1 equiv.) in 15-20 ml of acetonitrile. The mixture was stirred at room temperature untill complete formation of the product (TLC monitoring). The mixture was then diluted with 100 ml of ethyl acetate and washed several times with water. When presence of />-aminophenol was detected by TLC, the organic phase was washed with an aqueous solution of HC1 IN, followed with brine. Finally the organic phase was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and concentrated under vacuum. \n\n\nThe different ureas were controlled by ESI mass spectrometry and used in the next reaction without further purifications. \n\n\nSulfamates were then prepared by reacting the requisite phenol (1 equiv.) with sulfamoyl chloride (3equiv.) in Ν,Ν-dimethylacetamide (Okada, M.; Iwashita, S. and Koizumi, N. Efficient general method for sulfamoylation of a hydroxyl group. Tetrahedron Lett. 2000, 41, 7057-7051.). (Sulfamoyl chloride was prepared from chlorosulfonyl isocyanate and formic acid as described previously: Appel, R. and Berger, G. Hydrazinsulfonsaiire-amide, I. IJber das hydrazodisulfamid. Chem. Ber. 1958, 91, 1339-1341.).

An Applied Photophysics stopped-flow instrument has been used for assaying the CA catalysed C0\n2\n hydration activity.\n1\n Phenol red (at a concentration of 0.2 mM) has been used as indicator, working at the absorbance maximum of 557 nm, with 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.5) as buffer, and 20 mM Na\n2\nS0\n4\n (for maintaining constant the ionic strength), following the initial rates of the CA-catalyzed C0\n2\n hydration reaction for a period of 10-100 s. The C0\n2\n concentrations ranged from 1.7 to 17 mM for the determination of the kinetic parameters and inhibition constants. For each inhibitor at least six traces of the initial 5-10% of the reaction have been used for determining the initial velocity. The uncatalyzed rates were determined in the same manner and subtracted from the total observed rates. Stock solutions of inhibitor (0.1 mM) were prepared in distilled-deionized water and dilutions up to 0.01 nM were done thereafter with distilled-deionized water. Inhibitor and enzyme solutions were preincubated together for 15 min at room temperature in order to allow for the formation of the E-I complex. The inhibition constants were obtained by non-linear least-squares methods using PRISM 3, as reported earlier,\n1\n'\n2\n'\n3\n and represent the mean from at least three different determinations. All enzymes were recombinant ones, obtained as reported earlier.\n2,3\n \n\n\n1. Khalifah, R.G. The carbon dioxide hydration activity of carbonic anhydrase. I.

Starting from 1 ,4-phenylene- diamine 4, which has been monoprotected with the tertbutyl-oxycarbonyl (boc) moiety, by reaction with boc chloride 5, the key intermediates 6 have been obtained, which were not isolated. The one-pot preparation continued with the sulfamoylation of 6 (as described above for the preparation of sulfamates 3, Procedure B) and treatment with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) which led to the deprotected amine. The sulfamides 7/8 were then prepared from the key intermediate, by reaction with alkyl/aryl isocyanates as descibed above for compounds 3, with an acceptable yiled (of 45-63 %). The analogues sulfamides 8, possessing an extra methylene moiety between thenureido and benzenesulfamide part of the molecule, were prepared similarly to 7, starting with 4-aminobenzylamine insted of 1 ,4-phenylenediamine. \n\n Example 4 \n\n\n Inhibition studies on carbonic anhydrases with sulfamides 7 \n\n\n Inhibition studies were performed on carbonic anhydrases using the compounds prepared in accordance with Example 3.

The inhibition constant (Ki) was determined for CAI, CAM, CAIX and CAXII. The results a re presented in Table 3. \n\n\nTable 3: CA inhibition data with compounds 15, 16, 17, 18 and 20 (stopped flow assay) \n\n\nCompound Ki (nM) hCA I hCA I I hCA IX hCA XI I Ki CA ll/Ki CA IX \n\n\n7 6530 541 12 15 45.1 \n\n\n8 6725 347 19 6 18.3 \n\n\n9 5418 613 9 5 68.1 \n\n 10 3459 486 10 10 48.6 \n\n\n 12 7635 235 14 12 16.8 \n\n\n Example 7 \n\n\n Anti-tumour activity of selected ureido-sulfamate \n\n\n Compound 3p was selected for further investigation. This compound was the ureido-sulfamate 4-[3,5-dimethylphenyl)ureido]phenyl sulfamate, which had a Ki for CA IX of 2nM and a Ki for CA XII of 7 nM. This compound also had a selectivity ratio (Ki II/Ki IX) of 78. \n\n\nA mouse xenograft model was chosen to assess the in vivo activity of this inhibitor on HT29 colon carcinoma cells which had been subcutaneously injected into mice to form a xenograft. The experimental details are set out in Table 4 \n\n\nThe results are shown in Figure 3 from which it may be inferred that a significant reduction in the volume of the tumour is observed when comparing subcutaneous injection of carbonic anhydrase inhibitor with control. As around 30 % of the cells in the tumor are hypoxic, and as it can be seen, at the highest dosage of CA inhibitor, a reduction of the tumor growth of 30 % has been achieved, it can be concluded that all the cancer cells expressing CA IX have been killed by inhibiting the enzyme with the CA IX-sulfamate inhibitor from the invention. \n\n\nTaken together, the results indicate that the CA inhibitors of the present invention are potent inhibitors of CA IX and CA XII and demonstrate selectivity for inhibition of CA IX or CA XII over their intracellular isozyme counterparts. Activity of the inhibitors in vivo in the reduction of tumour size has also been demonstrated. \n\n Table 4 \n\n\n\n\n\nNude female.

The cells were prepared in a 1 : 1 mix of Matrigel: serum- free RMPI. \n\n\nMouse condition was monitored daily and tumour volumes recorded at least 3x per week. \n\n\nOnce tumours reached approximately 100mm\n3\n, they were randomised in to the following treatment groups: \n\n\nGroup 1: 8 mice implanted with MDA231-EGFP cells received vehicle administered in a \"5 days on, 2 days\" off schedule (ie Mon-Fri dosing each week). \n\n\n Group 2: 8 mice implanted with MDA231-EGFP cells received CA-IX inhibitor S4 administered at lOmg/kg dose in a \"5 days on, 2 days\" off schedule (ie Mon-Fri dosing each week). \n\n\nTreatment was continued until primary tumours reached a designated endpoint volume of approx 1000mm\n3\n. \n\n\nMouse health and condition was monitored throughout and weights recorded up to 3 times per week. \n\n\nBefore sacrifice Pimonidazole at 0.2ml of lOmg/ml solution i/p (2h before) and 0.1 ml of a 6mg/ml Hoechst solution (iv) (1 minute before) were administered. Tumour and lungs were rapidly removed for processing. \n\n Clonogens were assessed in lungs using a clonogenic assay. About a quarter of the total lung tissue was taken and weighed. The tissue was cross chopped with scissors and a scalpel in a petri dish. 5ml of RPMI medium supplemented with enzymes was added to the petri dish and this was incubated for 40 minutes on a shaker at 37°C. The RPMI serum free medium (47 ml) was formulated with 66 mg collagenase, 18.94 mg trypsin and lmg DNase. After incubation, 5 ml RPMI with 10% FCS was added to neutralize the enzymes. The sample was pipetted up and down to disaggregate undigested parts and centrifuged for 3 minutes at 1500 rpm followed by resuspension in 4 ml BPS. A dilution range of cell suspensions was made in a 6-well plate and cells were left to grow for 5 to 7 days without changing the medium. Clones were then stained with bromophenol blue and counted, calculating the number per mg of tissue following correction for the dilution. \n\n\nThe results of this experiment are shown in Figures 4 and 5. Figure 4 shows a graph of tumour volume against time comparing tumours from the vehicle treated mice against those treated with the CAIX inhibitor. It will be apparent from this Figure that the inhibitor had little or no effect on the growth of the orthotopic MDA-231 tumours, as assessed by tumour volume. \n\n\nFigure 5 shows a comparison of the number of colonies per gram of lung tissue as a measure of the number of metastatic MDA-231 clonogens in the treated mice. Comparing vehicle- treated mice with those treated with the CAIX inhibitor, it is clear that the CAIX inhibitor treated mice had significantly fewer metastatic clonogens suggesting that CAIX inhibitors may be potent anti-metastatic agents. \n\n\nIn the in vitro experiment a cell migration assay was performed to assess the effect of CAIX inhibitor 3p on in vitro wound closure. \n\n\nA cell migration assay was performed as follows. A coverslip was placed in a 3cm dish and 0.5x10\n6\n cells (in 10% FCS-RPMI) was seeded, per 3 cm dish. The cells were left to grow for 24 hours so as to obtain a confluent layer of cells on the coverslip and a scratch was made with a pipette tip (p200) and loosely attached cells were washed off. The medium was replaced with a low serum (0.2% serum) medium to reduce the level of proliferation. \n\n Inhibitor or vehicle was added and left for 0, 4, 8 or 24 hours. Inhibitor was applied at a working concentration of 33 μΜ and inhibitors were provided from a stock solution of 100 mM in DMSO. Cells were fixed in buffered formalin and scratches were imaged with ImageJ and the extent of wound closure was calculated. The cells used in the assay were MDA-231 GFP cells. \n\n\nThe results are shown in Figure 6 on the right hand side. Gap closure (%) is plotted at 4 and 8 hours for vehicle-treated and inhibitor-treated cells under normoxic and anoxic conditions respectively. It is apparent from the results that the presence of CA-IX inhibitor significantly inhibits cell migration, thereby resulting in a very low percentage gap closure as compared with control. \n\n\nThe ability for MDA231 cells to express HIF and CA-IX under normoxic and anoxic conditions was assessed. MDA231 cells were grown in a standard cell culture incubator under normoxic/anoxic conditions for 24 hours. Cells were isolated from petri dishes and cell lysates prepared. The cell lysates were prepared by lysing the cells in TNN buffer supplemented with inhibitors to protect the proteins from degradation during the isolation. TNN buffer contained Tris-HCl, NaCL, EDTA, NP40 (supplemented on the day of use with DTT), PMSF, sodium orthovanadate, NaF, β-glycerol phosphate, NaPPi and protease inhibitor cocktail. The level of protein in the lysate was measured on a spectrophotometer against a concentration range of albumen. 50 micro grams of protein/ lysate was loaded on a polyacrylamide gel to separate proteins according to their molecular weight. Proteins were transferred from the gel onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated overnight with antibodies specific to CA-IX, HIF or β actin. The final detection was done by exposure of the membranes to a CL-XPosure film which is an X ray film to capture the emission of light after exposure of the membrane to enhanced chemiluminescence (using a horseradish peroxidase and hydrogen peroxide catalysed oxidation of luminol. \n\n\nThe results are shown in Figure 6 on the left hand side, which shows images of the antibody- treated gel bands. The bands shown in the image reflect how much protein there is present in the cells. It is apparent that, under normal conditions in air no HIF or CA-IX is expressed. \n\n This is because HIF is only expressed under low oxygen conditions and HIF is required to regulate CA-IX expression. Under hypoxic conditions both HIF and CA-IX are expressed. The β actin is present as a control and is expressed irrespective of the oxygenation of the cells. \n\n\nAnti-metastatic activity of CA IX inhibitors (2) \n\n\nA series of 11 compounds were assayed in scratch wound assays to evaluate the effect of CA-IX inhibition on cellular migration in air and hypoxia. As a preliminary screen, compounds were tested against the MDA231 cell line at a concentration of 33μΜ. This cell line is highly migratory in cell culture and shows robust induction of CA-IX in hypoxia (Figure 6). Cells were then cultured in air or hypoxia and migration analysed 24h later relative to vehicle treated controls. 7 compounds showed either little activity, or equivalent inhibitory effects in both air and hypoxia (Figure 7). Figure 7 shows that some of the compound panel showed little activity in the migration assay, or were equally able to prevent migration in both aerobic and hypoxic conditions (eg FC9-398A, FC9-399A, C- 400Abis, FC9-401A and FC9-402A; corresponding respectively to compounds 3m, 3n, 3a and 3F). \n\n\n4 compounds (FC9-396A, FC-397A, FC-403A and S4; corresponding respectively to compounds 3i, 3k, 3h and 3p) showed inhibitory effects against hypoxic cell migration at concentrations that had minimal effects in air. These were deemed as apparent \"hits\" in this assay screen . Figure 8 shows the dose response of FC-397A (A) and S4 (B). Inhibition by FC-397A was confirmed in two other cell lines (WRO; thyroid; HT1080; fibrosarcoma). Concentrations given are in μΜ. \n\n\nThese data support the contention that CA-IX inhibition can control spontaneous metastatic dissemination/growth from primary tumours. \n\n Example 9 \n\n\nEnhancement of chemotherapeutic and radiotherapeutic effects of CA-IX inhibitors \n\n\nFurther preliminary studies have been undertaken to evaluate the ability of the CA-IX inhibitor, S4 (corresponding to compound 3p from Example 1) to enhance the effect of chemo or radiotherapy. These studies were undertaken using tumour cells grown into 3- D spheroid cultures that have a natural oxygen gradient. Spheroids of FaDU head and neck cells were generated and treated for 24h with S4 or vehicle alone; doxorubicin alone or in combination with S4; and S4 or vehicle plus lOGy radiotherapy given at the end of the 24h exposure. Spheroids were treated with trypsin to generate single cell suspensions and plated at various dilutions. Clonogenecity was then recorded per spheroid. S4 alone little effect on growth of cells isolated from the spheroids. However coincident CA-IX inhibition and either doxorubicin or radiation treatment reduced colongenic survival compared with either agent alone (Figure 9). \n\n\nFigure 9 shows spheroids derived from FaDU cells treated with the CA-IX inhibitor S4 alone (33μΜ) or in combination with radiation (lOGy) or doxorubicin (10 μΜ). The CA-IX inhibitor alone had little effect on cell growth (compare plates labelled \"None\"), but when combined with doxorubicin or radiotherapy there was a significant reduction in colony formation per spheroid (values given ±SEM). \n\n\nThese data suggest that CA-IX inhibition can improve the cytotoxic effect of radiotherapy or doxorubicin treatment in 3-D model systems where treatment resistance is linked to the presence of hypoxic cells. \n\n Method details \n\n\nSpheroid experiments: \n\n\nSpheroids were generated by the \"liquid overlay technique\". Fadu cells (lxlO\n4\n per well) were grown in a 96-wells plate of which were coated with agarose (1.5%). The coating prevents the cells from forming monolayers and gives rise of spheroid growth. \n\n\nThe spheroids were grown in a C0\n2\n-incubator for 5-7 days. Thereafter, the spheroids were collected and grown in a spinner flask for an additional 5-7 days until they reached a diameter of ~500-750pm (10%-0.1% 02 gradient in spheroid). \n\n\nSpheroids were pooled for the following treatments: \n\n\n1. Vehicle for 24 hours \n\n\n 2. CA9 inhibitor (33μΜ) for 24h \n\n\n 3. Doxorubicin (ΙΟμΜ) for 24h \n\n\n 4. Vehicle for 24 hours followed by lOGy radiotherapy \n\n\n 5. CA9 inhibitor (33μΜ) for 24h by lOGy radiotherapy \n\n\nDirectly thereafter, spheroids were digested to single cells using trypsin/EDTA and the cells seeded at a range of concentration in culture plates (clonogenicity assay). \n\n\nAfter about a week the cells were stained with methylene blue and the number of colonies counted. \n\n Example 10 \n\n\nStudies on use of fluorescent CA IX inhibitors as imaging/diagnosis agents\n\n\nCompound 20, the fluorescent derivative FC11-489A bis from Example 5 possesses a fluorescent label and was used to study the effectiveness of CA IX inhibitors of the present invention in imaging/diagnosis applications, \n\n\n This compound was tested in a final concentration of 100 μΜ (in 0.5% DMSO concentration). A stock solution of 1 mM was prepared containing 5% DMSO supplemented with DMEM cell culture growth medium and added on the cells in a 1/10 dilution. For the tests, human colorectal HT-29 adenocarcinoma cells were used harbouring a shRNA against CA IX (94/1) or a scrambled control (EV/2) [is there a public source of this cell line?]. \n\n\n 10.1 Characterisation of cell lines \n\n\n Exponentially growing cells were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were investigated by Western blotting and qRT-PCR for their CA IX expression levels under normoxia, hypoxia 0.2% or upon reoxygenation (qRT-PCR only under normoxia and hypoxia 0.2%). Figure 10 shows CA IX mRNA expression levels upon 24h exposure to hypoxia 0.2% (Hyp) in CA IX expressing (EV/2) and CA IX knock donw (94/1) cell line. Normoxia (Norm) exposure was used as control. CA IX mRNA expression levels were significantly increased in the EV/2 CA IX expressing cell line upon hypoxia exposure (fig. 10), while the 94/1 CA IX knock down cell line did not demonstrate an induction. \n\n\nFigure 11 shows CA IX protein expression levels upon 24h exposure to normoxia (N), hypoxia 0.2% (H) and upon reoxygenation (R = 24h 0.2% followed by lh 21% oxygen) in CA IX expressing (EV/2) and CA IX knock down (94/1) cell line, β-actin was used as loading control. CA IX protein expression (fig. 12) was found in the EV/2 cells and levels were elevated upon hypoxia 0.2%, which remained high upon reoxygenation (lh) conditions. On the other hand, little to no CA IX protein expression was found in the 94/1 cells (> 90% knock down) without any upregulation upon hypoxia or reoxygenation conditions. \n\n\n10.2 FC11-489A bis binding \n\n\n 10.2.1 Plate reader experiment \n\n\n EV/2 and 94/1 cells were plated at a density of 100.000 per well (Corning 24-well plates) a day before the start of the experiment and transfer to a hypoxic culture chamber (MACS VA500 micro- aerophilic workstation, Don Whitley Scientific, Shipley, UK). The atmosphere in the chamber consisted of 0.2% 0\n2\n, 5% C0\n2\n and residual N\n2\n. Normoxic wells were incubated in parallel in air with 5% C0\n2\n. Reoxygenation conditions were obtained by transferring plates after 24h hypoxia exposure \n\n to air conditions for an add itional hour. Cells were incubated with FC11-489A bis the last 30 min of each exposure. Control conditions were obtained by addition of 0.5% DMSO supplemented with medium. After incubation, cells were rinsed twice with PBS to remove unbound FC11-489A bis and fixed in freshly prepared 2% pa raformaldehyde on ice. Plates were placed in a BMG microplate reader FLUOstare Omega using following protocol: Fluorescence intensity - Well scanning using 5x5 scan matrix in a diameter of 10 mm with 10 flashes per scan point, a gain of 1000 a nd 355 nm - 460 nm filter settings. Fluorescence intensity data were corrected for both background signals (cells without FC11-489A bis) and normalized to the signal intensity of cells incubated with FC11-489A bis under normoxia. \n\n\n A significant higher bind ing (P = 0.004) of FC11-489A bis was demonstrated at EV/2 CA IX expressing cells exposed to hypoxia for 24h, compared with their normoxic counterparts (fig. 12), corresponding with elevated CA IX protein expression (fig. 11). Figure 12 shows quantitative fluorescence Omega plate reader analysis of FC11-489A bis binding to EV/2 CA IX expressing and 94/1 CA IX knock down cells treated under the respective conditions. Data demonstrate the fold accumulation compared with FC11-489A bis treated normoxic cells and represent the mean +/- SEM of four independent experiments. Upon reoxygenation, binding was dramatically reduced (P = 0.002) compa red with hypoxic conditions and was not statistically different (P = 0.325) with binding under normoxia. No significant binding was found at 94/1 CA IX knock down cells, corresponding with having no CA IX protein expression in these cells (fig. 10). Binding between EV/2 and 94/1 cells was only significantly different (P < 0.001) upon hypoxia exposure. \n\n\n10.2.2 Flow cytometer experiment \n\n\n EV/2 and 94/1 cells were plated at a density of 0,5 x 10e6 per 6 cm dish (Corning) a day before the start of the experiment and transfer to a hypoxic culture chamber (MACS VA500 micro-aerophilic workstation, Don Whitley Scientific, Shipley, UK). The atmosphere in the cham ber consisted of 0.2% 0\n2\n, 5% C0\n2\n and residual N\n2\n. Normoxic dishes were incubated in parallel in air with 5% C0\n2\n. Reoxygenation conditions were obtained by transferring dishes after 24h hypoxia exposure to air conditions for an additional hour. Cells were incubated with FC11-489A bis the last 30 min of each exposure. Control conditions were obtained by addition of 0.5% DMSO supplemented with medium. After incubation, cells were rinsed twice with PBS to remove unbound FC11-489A bis, scraped and fixed in freshly prepa red 2% paraformaldehyde on ice. Single suspensions were obtained by passing cells through 70 μητι nylon cell strainers (BD Biosciences). Mean fluorescence intensity was analyzed using a FACSort flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using FIT-C filter settings. Data were corrected for both background signals (cells without FC11-489A bis) and normalized to the signal intensity of cells incubated with FC11-489A bis under normoxia. \n\n\n The FACS results confirmed the data obtained previously with the plate reader. Figure 13 shows quantitative FACS analysis of FC11-489A bis binding to EV/2 CA IX expressing and 94/1 CA IX knock down cells treated under the respective conditions. Data demonstrate the fold accumulation compared with FC11-489A bis treated normoxic cells and represent the mean +/- SEM of four independent experiments. A significant higher binding (P = 0.004) of FC11-489A bis was \n\n demonstrated at EV/2 CA IX expressing cells exposed to hypoxia for 24h, compared with their normoxic counterparts (fig. 13), corresponding with elevated CA IX protein expression (fig. 11). Upon reoxygenation, binding was dramatically reduced (P = 0.0016) compared with hypoxic conditions and was not statistically different (P = 0.325) with binding under normoxia. No significant binding was found at 94/1 CA IX knock down cells, corresponding with having no CA IX protein expression in these cells (fig. 12). Binding at EV/2 cells was significantly higher then at 94/1 cells for all experimental conditions (N: P = 0.0043; H: P = 0.0003; : P = 0.0022). \n\n\n 10.2.3 Fluorescence staining experiment \n\n\n EV/2 and 94/1 cells were grown (at a density of 70000 cells) on glass coverslips a day before the start of the experiment and transfer to a hypoxic culture chamber (MACS VA500 micro-aerophilic workstation, Don Whitley Scientific, Shipley, UK). The atmosphere in the chamber consisted of 0.2% 0\n2\n, 5% C0\n2\n and residual N\n2\n. Normoxic slides were incubated in parallel in air with 5% C0\n2\n. Reoxygenation conditions were obtained by transferring the coverslips after 24h hypoxia exposure to air conditions for an additional hour. Cells were incubated with FC11-489A bis the last 30 min of each exposure. Control conditions were obtained by addition of 0.5% DMSO supplemented with medium. At the end of the experiment, slides were rinsed twice with PBS to remove unbound FC11- 489A bis and cells were fixed in freshly prepared 2% paraformaldehyde. Cells were mounted onto slides with Fluorescence Mounting Medium (DAKO) and analyzed with a Zeiss Axioskop fluorescence microscope using FIT-C filter settings. \n\n\n Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated higher binding of FC11-489A bis at EV/2 CA IX expressing cells exposed to hypoxia 0.2% (fig. 14). Binding was reduced upon reoxygenation to levels similar as normoxia exposure. Binding at 94/1 CA IX knock down cells was lower for all experimental conditions compared to the EV/2 cells. \n\n\n Each staining picture was loaded into ImageJ analysis software (Image J 1.38x NIH USA, http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/ Java 1.5.0_17), converted to 8-bit images, thresholded to exclude areas without cells and all remaining pixels were analyzed for their intensity. Data were corrected for both background signals (cells without FC11-489A bis) and normalized to the signal intensity of cells incubated with FC11-489A bis under normoxia. \n\n\n Figure 15 shows pixel quantification of immunofluorescence staining of FC11-489A bis binding to EV/2 CA IX expressing and 94/1 CA IX knock down cells treated under the respective conditions. For each oxygen condition, for at least 350 pixels fluorescence intensity was analyzed. \n\n\n A significant higher binding (P < 0.001) of FC11-489A bis was demonstrated at EV/2 CA IX expressing cells exposed to hypoxia for 24h, compared with their normoxic counterparts (fig. 15), corresponding with elevated CA IX. protein expression (fig. 11). Upon reoxygenation, binding was dramatically reduced (P = 0.017) compared with hypoxic conditions and was not statistically different (P = 0.134) with binding under normoxia. No significant binding was found at 94/1 CA IX knock down cells, corresponding with having no CA IX protein expression in these cells (fig. 11). \n\n 10,2.3 Conclusion \n\n\n HT-29 EV/2 CA IX expressing cells exposed to hypoxia demonstrated a strong CA IX upregulation both on m NA and protein levels. Upon reoxygenation, CA IX protein expression levels stayed elevated, in agreement with the known half-life of 38h in reoxygenated cells. HT-29 94/1 CA IX knock down cells demonstrated > 90% reduction in CA IX expression and no upregulation was demonstrated upon hypoxia and reoxygenation conditions. \n\n\n FC11-489A bis binding was exclusively observed during conditions of hypoxia in the EV/2 CA IX expressing cell line. Furthermore, despite high levels of CA IX, virtually no binding of FC11-489A bis occurred after reoxygenation. In 94/1 CA IX knock down cells, no binding of FC11-489A bis was demonstrated irrespective of the oxygen concentration. In conclusion, not only CA IX expression, but also the presence of active CA IX is necessary to enable FC11-489A bis binding, requirements only obtained under hypoxia exposure. \n\n\nExample 11 \n\n\n Effects of a CA IX inhibitor/radiation combination on cell survival \n\n\n Compound S4 (compound 3p from Example 1) was used in this Example to study the effectiveness of CA IX inhibition of the present invention in radiotherapeutic applications. \n\n\n This compound was tested in a final concentration of 33 μΜ (in 0.5% DMSO concentration). A stock solution of 330 μΜ was prepared containing 5% DMSO supplemented with DMEM cell culture growth medium and added on the cells in a 1/10 dilution. For the tests, human colorectal HT-29 adenocarcinoma cells were used harbouring a shRNA against CA IX (94/1) or a scrambled control (EV/2). \n\n\n 11.1 Experimental setup \n\n\n EV/2 and 94/1 cells were plated at a density of 0.5 x 10e6 per 6 cm dish (Corning) a day before the start of the experiment and transfer to an anoxic culture chamber (MACS VA500 micro-aerophilic workstation, Don Whitley Scientific, Shipley, UK). The atmosphere in the chamber consisted of 0.0% 0\n2\n, 10% H\n2\n, 5% C0\n2\n and residual N\n2\n. Normoxic dishes were incubated in parallel in air with 5% C0\n2\n. Cells were incubated with S4 lh after the start of the anoxic/normoxic exposure, during 23h. Control conditions were obtained by addition of 0.5% DMSO supplemented with medium. After incubation, cells were irradiated on ice (MCN 225 industrial X-ray tube (Philips, Eindhoven, NL) at 225 kV and 10 mA under the respective oxygen concentrations using different doses (Normoxia: 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 Gy; Anoxia: 0, 4, 8, 12 and 16 Gy). After irradiation, cells were washed, trypsinized and plated for the clonogenic survival assay and incubated under standard culture conditions until colonies were formed (14 days). Colonies were fixed and stained with 4% methylene blue in 70% ethanol. Plating efficiency was determined by counting colonies consisting of > 50 cells and correcting for the number of cells seeded. \n\n 11.2 Results \n\n\n 11.2.1 Long-term effect of24h anoxia on survival \n\n\n First we investigated if CA IX knock down affected the long-term effect of 24h anoxia on cell killing, to be able to exclude this effect in the following therapy study. No differences were observed (fig. 16) between the EV/2 and 94/1 cells regarding their tolerance to low oxygen conditions (P = 0.3028). \n\n\n11.2.2 Intrinsic radiosensitivity \n\n\n Next, we investigated the effect of CA IX knock down on intrinsic radiosensitivity. Figure 17 shows intrinsic radiosensitivity of EV/2 CA IX expressing and 94/1 CA IX knock down cells, as assessed using clonogenic survival assay at different irradiation doses, N = normoxia, A = anoxia. \n\n\n Under normoxic exposure, no differences in survival were found between EV/2 and 94/1 cells regarding their sensitivity to different doses of irradiation. This is in agreement with the equal levels of CA IX m NA and protein levels under ambient air. However, when cells were exposed to anoxia for 24h and irradiated under these no oxygen conditions, knock down of CA IX makes cells more sensitive to irradiation (fig. 17), with a significant difference at 8 Gy (P = 0.013), 12 Gy {P < 0.0001 ) and 16 Gy (P = 0.0011). \n\n\n11.2.3 S4 sensitizes CA IX expressing cells to irradiation \n\n\n Next, we investigated if the compound S4 is able to sensitize cells to irradiation. Under normoxic exposure, no sensitization to irradiation was demonstrated, neither for the EV/2 and 94/1 cells. When EV/2 CA IX expressing cells were exposed to 24h anoxia and pretreated with S4, a sensitization to irradiation was observed (fig. 18) for 8 Gy (P = 0.023), 12 Gy (P < 0.0001 ) and 16 Gy (P = 0.014). Sensitization of EV/2 cells pretreated with S4 was to a similar extent as seen for the 94/1 CA IX knock down cells without S4 pretreatment, since no significant differences were found between both arms [8 Gy (P = 0.6464), 12 Gy (P = 0.5067 ) and 16 Gy (P = 0.8691)]. Furthermore, S4 pretreatment of the 94/1 CA IX knock down cells had no effect on the radiosensitivity, demonstrating the CA IX specific inhibition of S4. \n\n\n11.2.4 Conclusion \n\n\n CA IX inhibition, either using a genetic approach (knock down) or pharmacological (S4) results in a sensitization to irradiation. Genetically or pharmacologically, this sensitization occurs to a similar extent. Pharmacological testing was performed at 33 μΜ, a concentration selected based on no- toxicity under normoxic conditions based on proliferation/viability assays."
