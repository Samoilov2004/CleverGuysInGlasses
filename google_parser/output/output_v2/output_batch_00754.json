Accordingly, the Government has certain rights in the invention. \n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n Ubiquitin is a small protein consisting of 76 amino acids that is important in the regulation of protein function in the cell. Ubiquitination and deubiquitination are enzymatically mediated processes by which ubiquitin is covalently bound to or unbound from a target protein. These processes have been implicated in the regulation of the cell cycle, apoptosis, the marking of transmembrane proteins such as receptors for removal, regulation of DNA transcription and repair, and other important functions. Proteins are targeted for degradation by the proteasome in the cell by being \"tagged\" with three or more ubiquitin molecules (polyubiquitination). The binding of a single ubiquitin molecule (monoubiquitination) does not generally target the monoubiquitinated protein for degradation. Rather, it may trigger activities such as DNA repair and gene silencing, among other functions. Huang and D'Andrea (2006) Mol Cell Biol. 7:323-34. \n\n\n Deubiquitination allows ubiquitin to be recycled and restores the function of the deubiquitinated proteins. Ubiquitin molecules are cleaved from a protein by \n\n\ndeubiquitinating enzymes, which are cysteine proteases that operate through an active site thiol. There are approximately 95 different deubiquitinating enzymes in human cells. Huang et al. (2006) Nature Cell Biol. 8(4):339-47. Among them, Ubiquitin\n\n\nSpecific Protease 1 (USPl), also known as ubiquitin specific peptidase 1 and as ubiquitin \n\n carboxyl terminal hydrolase 1, has been found to regulate the repair of DNA damage induced by DNA cross-linking agents, which include agents such as cisplatin, mitomycin C (MMC), diepoxybutane (DEB), ionizing radiation (IR), and ultraviolet (UV) radiation. \n\n\n USPl has been shown to deubiquitinate monoubiquitinated Fanconi anemia group complementation group D2 (FANCD2-Ub), a protein that in its monoubiquitinated form mediates DNA repair from the damage induced by the aforementioned agents. Nijman et al. (2005) Mol Cell 17:331-39. USPl also has been shown to deubiquitinate monoubiquitinated proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA-Ub), a protein that in its monoubiquitinated form activates DNA translesion synthesis, a polymerase-mediated bypass of DNA lesions. Huang et al. (2006) Nature Cell Biol. 8(4):339-47. \n\n\n Recently it was reported that USPl forms a complex with and is activated by USPl associated factor 1 (UAF1), also known as WD repeat domain 48. Cohn et al. (2007) Mol Cell 28:786-97; US 2008/0167229 Al. The active USP1/UAF1 complex controls cellular levels of monubiquitinated FANCD2. Even more recently, it was reported that UAF1 also separately forms complexes with and activates two additional deubiquitinating enzymes, ubiquitin specific protease 12 (USP12) and ubiquitin specific protease 46 (USP46). Cohn et al. (2009) J Biol Chem. 284(8):5343-51. \n\n\n Co-owned US 2008/0167229 discloses three compounds, β-lapachone, Biomol AP401 (propidium iodide), and RK-682, as potential small molecule inhibitors of USP1/UAF1 complex-mediated deubiquitinase activity. \n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n The invention provides certain small molecule inhibitors of USPl activity as well as compositions and methods related to the inhibitors useful for the inhibition of USPl activity in vitro and in vivo. These small molecule inhibitors of USPl activity are structurally distinct from β-lapachone, Biomol AP401 (propidium iodide), and RK-682. The invention further provides, in part, compositions and methods useful for the treatment, prevention, and characterization of cancer based on the ability to inhibit USPl activity in cancer cells. \n\n\n It has surprisingly been discovered according to the present invention that inhibition of USPl activity, which inhibits deubiquitination of monoubiquitinated FANCD2 (FANCD2-Ub), results in reduced DNA repair activity in cells, including \n\n cancer cells. This was unexpected because FANCD2-Ub is the active form of FANCD2. Inhibition of USP1 activity thus can render cancer cells, including cancer cells otherwise resistant to treatment with DNA cross-linking agents, susceptible to treatment with DNA cross-linking agents. \n\n\n The deubiquitinating enzyme USP1 and its associated factor UAF1 regulate the\n\n\nFanconi Anemia (FA)-BRCA DNA repair pathway by catalyzing the deubiquitination of mono-ubiquitinated FANCD2. Inactivation of USP1/UAF1 results in elevated level of mono-ubiquitinated FANCD2, disruption of the FA-BRCA pathway, and cellular hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, such as mitomycin C and cisplatin. \n\n\n Targeting USP1/UAF1 with a small-molecule inhibitor therefore enhances the efficacy of DNA crosslinking agents in cancer therapy. \n\n\n An aspect of the invention is a pharmaceutical composition including a small molecule inhibitor of ubiquitin specific protease 1 (USP1) according to Formula I: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n wherein \n\n\n X is O, S, or NR\n3\n;

These small molecule inhibitors of USPl activity inhibit the deubiquitinating activity of USPl, both alone and in combination with UAF1, both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, it has now unexpectedly been discovered by the inventors that inhibition of USPl activity can render cancer cells, including cancer cells otherwise resistant to treatment with DNA cross-linking agents, susceptible to treatment with DNA cross-linking agents. \n\n\n Ubiquitin is a 76 amino acid protein that can be covalently attached to other proteins, targeting them for degradation or regulating their function. The amino acid sequence of the human form of ubiquitin is given by SEQ ID NO: l : \n\n\n1 MQIFVKTLTG KTITLEVEPS DTIENVKAKI QDKEGIPPDQ QRLIFAGKQL EDGRTLSDYN 61 IQKESTLHLV LRLRGG \n\n\nUbiquitin is covalently attached to other proteins by a ubiquitin transferase enzyme, and it is released from a ubiquitinated protein by a deubiquitinating enzyme. \n\n\n Ubiquitination and deubiquitination regulate a number of essential biological processes such as gene transcription, DNA replication, and DNA repair. Pickart et al.\n\n\n(2004) Biochim Biophys Acta 1695:55-72. Ubiquitin modifications can be divided into three principal types. First, monoubiquitination may alter the activity of the substrate, as has been described for the FANCD2 protein of the Fanconi anemia pathway and the PCNA protein involved in translesion synthesis. Kennedy et al. (2005) Genes Dev 19:2925-40; Hoegh et al. (2002) Nature 419: 135-41. Second, polyubiquitination through K48 linkage typically targets the protein substrate for degradation by the proteasome. Third, polyubiquitination through K63 linkage can alter the activity of the protein substrate by modifying its protein-protein interaction properties. \n\n\n There are at least 95 putative deubiquitinating enzymes in humans. Nijman et al.\n\n\n(2005) Cell 123:773-86. This family of deubiquitinating enzymes is divided into five subfamilies, including the ubiquitin specific protease (USP) subfamily (58 members), the \n\n otubain protease (OTU) subfamily and the JABl/MPN/Mov34 metalloprotease (JAMM) subfamily (14 members each), the Josephine domain protease (MJD) subfamily (5 members), and the ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase (UCH) subfamily (4 members). The exact biological function for many of these enzymes is currently unknown. However, for those enzymes whose function has been uncovered, it has become apparent that regulation of their activities is essential for integrity of the pathways they regulate. \n\n\n Ubiquitin- specific protease 1 (USPl) is a cysteine protease with deubiquitinase activity. USPl cleaves ubiquitin from monoubiquitinated and polyubiquitinated protein substrates, including FANCD2 and PCNA. Huang et al. (2006) Nature Cell Biol. \n\n\n8(4):339-47.

There are thirteen Fanconi anemia genes, and their corresponding proteins fall into several classes of enzymes and structural proteins, including a ubiquitin ligase, monoubiquitinated proteins, a helicase, and one with both helicase and nuclease motifs. Since FA patients share a characteristic clinical and cellular phenotype, it has been assumed that the thirteen FA proteins cooperate in a common DNA repair pathway. \n\n Indeed, the FA proteins work in concert to control the monoubiquitinated state of the FANCD2 and FANCI proteins (see FIG. 1) and the downstream functions of the pathway. \n\n\n As shown in FIG. 1, after DNA damage, the Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3- related kinase (ATR) activates FA core complex (FANCA/B/C/E/F/G/L/M). The FA core complex then functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase and monoubiquitinates FANCD2 and FANCI. The monoubiquitinated FANCD2/FANCI complex is then targeted to chromatin where it forms a complex with additional FA proteins and other DNA repair proteins. A protein complex of USPl and UAFl then deubiquitinates FANCD2/FANCI complex, allowing their release from chromatin. USPl is also required for localization of FANCD2/FANCI into DNA repair foci. \n\n\n Although mutations in the thirteen FA genes account for most, if not all, cases of FA, additional genes related to the FA-BRCA pathway may also be important. For example, disruption of USPl in mice yields the FA phenotype, and knockdown of either USPl or UAFl also disrupts the FA-BRCA pathway and causes hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents. \n\n\n USPl associated factor 1 (UAFl) is a WD repeat endosomal protein that has been described to form a heterodimeric complex with USPl and thereby to enhance the deubiquitinase activity of USPl. This protein has been previously shown to play a role in the downregulation of the T lymphocyte receptor. Park et al. (2002) Immunity 17:221- 33. The amino acid sequence for human UAFl is given by SEQ ID NO:3: \n\n\n1 MAAHHRQNTA GRRKVQVSYV IRDEVEKYNR NGVNALQLDP ALNRLFTAGR DSIIRIWSVN\n\n\n61 QHKQDPYIAS MEHHTDWVND IVLCCNGKTL ISASSDTTVK VWNAHKGFCM STLRTHKDYV\n\n\n121 KALAYAKDKE LVASAGLDRQ IFLWDVNTLT ALTASNNTVT TSSLSGNKDS IYSLAMNQLG\n\n\n181 TIIVSGSTEK VLRVWDPRTC AKLMKLKGHT DNVKALLLNR DGTQCLSGSS DGTIRLWSLG\n\n\n241 QQRCIATYRV HDEGVWALQV NDAFTHVYSG GRDRKIYCTD LRNPDIRVLI CEEKAPVLKM\n\n\n301 ELDRSADPPP AIWVATTKST VNKWTLKGIH NFRASGDYDN DCTNPITPLC TQPDQVIKGG\n\n\n361 ASIIQCHILN DKRHILTKDT NNNVAYWDVL KACKVEDLGK VDFEDE IKKR FK VYVPNWF\n\n\n421 SVDLKTGMLT ITLDESDCFA AWVSAKDAGF SSPDGSDPKL NIGGLLLQAL LEYWPRTHVN\n\n\n481 PMDEEENEVN HVNGEQENRV QKGNGYFQVP PHTPVIFGEA GGRTLFRLLC RDSGGETESM\n\n\n541 LLNETVPQWV ID ITVDKNMP KFNKIPFYLQ PHASSGAKTL KKDRLSASDM LQVRKVMEHV\n\n\n601 YEKI INLDNE SQTTSSSNNE KPGEQEKEED IAVLAEEKIE LLCQDQVLDP NMDLRTVKHF\n\n\n661 IWKSGGDLTL HYRQKST \n\n Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is a DNA replication sliding clamp protein that can form part of a DNA polymerase complex. Upon monoubiquitination, PCNA can interact with any of several different DNA polymerases to form a complex which carries out either DNA replication or DNA repair, particularly translesion DNA synthesis. Huang & D'Andrea (2006) Mol Cell Biol. 7:323-34. As used herein,\n\n\n\"translesion DNA synthesis\" is a form of DNA repair in which specialized, damage- tolerant DNA polymerases (such as Pol eta) bypass DNA lesions that would normally stall replication of a DNA strand, allowing for later repair of the bypassed lesion. These DNA lesions can occur upon cellular exposure to ionizing radiation, ultraviolet light, or DNA-disrupting chemical agents.

Small molecule inhibitors of USPl so identified include the compounds of Formula III (933), Formula IV (527), Formula V (947), and Formula VI (009). \n\n\n \n\n Formula IV (527) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Formula V (947) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Formula VI (009) \n\n\nThe compounds of Formula IV and V are disclosed herein as representative examples of individual classes of compounds according to Formula I (and related Formula IA) and Formula II, respectively (see below). \n\n\n As used herein, an \"inhibitor of USPl\" refers to an agent that decreases deubiquitinase activity of USPl. As used herein, the term \"deubiquitinase activity of USPl\" and, equivalently, \"USPl activity\", refers to the action of USPl to remove ubiquitin from a ubiquitinated substrate. Deubiquitinase activity can be measured in vitro or in vivo, and it can be measured directly or indirectly. Deubiquitinase activity can be measured by a number of assays including assays that measure the deubiquitination of FANCD2-Ub or PCNA-Ub, natural targets of USPl deubiquitination. Alternatively, deubiquitinase activity of USPl can be determined by measuring the deubiquitination of a test molecule such as ubiquitin-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (AMC-Ub), which produces a fluorescently detectable signal upon the cleavage of ubiquitin. A USPl polypeptide is deemed to have deubiquitinase activity where the level of deubiquitinated FANCD2, PCNA, or AMC in the presence of USPl is at least 10% greater than the level of deubiquitinated FANCD2, PCNA, or AMC from a control sample (e.g., sample from the same tissue, or a separate aliquot of a cellular sample) in the absence of USPl. \n\n\nAlternatively a USPl polypeptide is deemed to have deubiquitinase activity where the level of ubiquitinated FANCD2-Ub, PCNA-Ub, or AMC-Ub is decreased by at least 10% in the presence of USPl relative to a control sample in the absence of USPl. In one \n\n embodiment an increase in USP1 activity in response to an agent as used herein refers to any detectable increase in the production of a deubiquitinated substrate (e.g., deubiquitinated AMC) in the presence of the agent relative to in the absence of the agent, such as a 0.5% increase, a 1% increase or decrease, 2%, 3-5%, 5-10%, 10-20%, 20-40%, 40-80%, 90%, or 100% or more increase in the production of a deubiquitinated substrate. In one embodiment a decrease in USP1 activity in response to an agent as used herein refers to any detectable decrease in the production of a deubiquitinated substrate (e.g., deubiquitinated AMC) in the presence of the agent relative to in the absence of the agent, such as a 0.5% decrease, a 1% decrease, 2%, 3-5%, 5-10%, 10-20%, 20-40%, 40-80%, 90%, or 100% decrease in the production of a deubiquitinated substrate. \n\n\n As used herein, a \"small molecule\" refers to an organic molecule of molecular weight of less than 1500 Daltons. Small molecules of the invention exclude short interfering RNA or short interfering hairpin RNA. \n\n\n Short interfering RNA (\"siRNA\") is a double-stranded RNA molecule that is generally 17 to 25 base pairs in length, one of whose strands contains a sequence\n\n\n(antisense sequence) that is complementary to a segment of a target messenger RNA. siRNA associates with an RNA-induced silencing complex in the cell, which then binds to a complementary region of a target messenger RNA and inactivates it. \n\n\n Short interfering hairpin RNA (\"shRNA\") is a ribonucleic acid containing sense and antisense sequences from a target gene connected by a loop; it can be expressed in mammalian cells from a vector. Transcribed shRNA is transported from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where it is processed, where it can decrease the expression of a gene with complementary sequences by RNA interference (RNAi). \n\n\n As used herein, RNA interference (\"RNAi\") refers to a selective intracellular degradation of RNA by means of an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). RNAi occurs in cells naturally to remove foreign RNAs (e.g., viral RNAs). RNAi proceeds via fragments cleaved from free double- stranded RNA molecules (such as viral RNA) which direct the degradative mechanism to other similar RNA sequences. Introduction of the double-stranded RNA into a cell triggers the degradation of the double- stranded RNA into shorter siRNA strands. These siRNAs then associate with RNA-induced silencing complexes, leading to the unwinding of the siRNAs into single strands, which then associate with complementary regions of messenger RNA and prevent the expression of \n\n the corresponding proteins. The use of synthetic siRNA to \"direct RNA interference (RNAi) against expression\" of a target gene refers to the reduction of the expression of the target gene by entry of the synthetic siRNA into the natural RNAi mechanism at the same point as natural siRNA created from double-stranded RNA, e.g., viral RNA, would enter that mechanism. That is, synthetic siRNA associate with the RISC, unwind, and then associate with complementary mRNA regions of target transcripts, which are then degraded. \n\n\n The compounds of Formula III (933) and Formula V (947) are known. For example, a method for synthesizing the compound of Formula V (947) is disclosed in Sondhi et al. (2008) Letts Org Chem 5:51-4, but this reference does not disclose a use for this compound. \n\n\n In contrast, the compounds of Formula IV (527) and Formula VI (009) appear to be novel compounds. \n\n\n The invention in one aspect provides the compound of Formula IV (527). \n\n\n The invention in one aspect provides the compound of Formula VI (009). \n\n\n The invention provides a pharmaceutical composition that includes (a) a small molecule inhibitor of USP1 selected from the group consisting of a compound of Formula I, a compound of Formula IA, a compound of Formula II, the compound of Formula IV (527), the compound of Formula V (947), and a combination thereof, and (b) a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In one embodiment the pharmaceutical composition includes the compound of Formula IV (527) and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In one embodiment the pharmaceutical composition includes the compound of Formula V (947) and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. \n\n\n As used herein, a \"pharmaceutically acceptable carrier\" refers to one or more compatible solid or liquid filler, diluents or encapsulating substances which are suitable for administration to a human or other vertebrate animal. The term \"carrier\" denotes an organic or inorganic ingredient, natural or synthetic, with which the active ingredient is combined to facilitate the application. The components of the pharmaceutical compositions also are capable of being commingled with the compounds of the present invention, and with each other, in a manner such that there is no interaction which would substantially impair the desired pharmaceutical efficacy. \n\n A pharmaceutical composition of the invention can be prepared by placing an effective amount of at least one active agent of the invention, such as a compound of any one of Formulas I- IV, in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. \n\n\n The invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition that includes (a) a small molecule inhibitor of USP1 selected from the group consisting of a compound of Formula I, a compound of Formula IA, a compound of Formula II, the compound of Formula III (933), the compound of Formula IV (527), the compound of Formula V (947), and any combination thereof; (b) a DNA cross-linking agent; and (c) a \n\n\npharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In one embodiment the small molecule inhibitor of USP1 is the compound of Formula III (933). In one embodiment the small molecule inhibitor of USP1 is the compound of Formula IV (527). In one embodiment the small molecule inhibitor of USP1 is the compound of Formula V (947). \n\n\n As used herein, a \"DNA cross-linking agent\" refers to a chemical compound or radiation that induces DNA cross-linking in a cell when applied to the cell. In one embodiment a DNA cross-linking agent is a chemical compound. Such compounds include certain chemotherapeutic agents, such as cisplatin, carboplatin, oxaliplatin, alkylating agents, mitomycin C, as well as certain carcinogenic chemicals, such as diepoxybutane. Cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II)) and related compounds carboplatin and oxaliplatin forms DNA cross-links as monoadduct, interstrand cross-link, intrastrand cross-link or DNA protein cross-link. Alkylating agents include \n\n\ncyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, melphalan, ifosfamide, uramustine, and bendamustine. \n\n\n DNA cross-linking radiation includes ionizing radiation and ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Ionizing radiation consists of subatomic particles or electromagnetic waves that are energetic enough to detach electrons from atoms or molecules, ionizing them. The occurrence of ionization depends on the energy of the impinging individual particles or waves. Generally, particles or photons with energies above a few electron volts (eV) are ionizing. Examples of ionizing particles are energetic alpha particles, beta particles, and neutrons. The ability of an electromagnetic wave (photons) to ionize an atom or molecule depends on its frequency. Radiation on the short-wavelength end of the electromagnetic spectrum, such as high frequency ultraviolet, x-rays, and gamma rays, is ionizing. Ionizing radiation comes from radioactive materials, x-ray tubes, and particle accelerators. \n\n The manner of exposure to DNA cross-linking agents can be deliberate or accidental. Examples of deliberate exposure include therapeutic chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Examples of accidental exposure include occupational exposure to chemicals or ionizing radiation, frequent air travel, and nuclear accidents and nuclear warfare. \n\n\n In one embodiment the pharmaceutical composition includes a DNA cross- linking agent selected from the group consisting of cisplatin, carboplatin, oxaliplatin, an alkylating agent, and mitomycin C. Any combination of such DNA cross-linking agents is also embraced by the invention. \n\n\n The invention provides a pharmaceutical composition including (a) a small molecule inhibitor of USP1 selected from the group consisting of a compound of Formula I, a compound of Formula IA, a compound of Formula II, the compound of Formula III (933), the compound of Formula IV (527), the compound of Formula V (947), and any combination thereof; (b) a poly (adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor; and (c) a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In one embodiment the small molecule inhibitor of USP1 is the compound of Formula III (933). In one embodiment the small molecule inhibitor of USP1 is the compound of Formula IV (527). In one embodiment the small molecule inhibitor of USP1 is the compound of Formula V (947). \n\n\n Poly(ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) is a key signaling enzyme involved in triggering repair of single-strand DNA damage. PARP actually includes a family of at least 17 members, including PARP-1 (also known as PARP1 and PARP I) and PARP-2 (also known as PARP2 and PARP II). One important function of PARP-1 is assisting in the repair of single-strand DNA nicks. It binds sites with single strand breaks through its N-terminal zinc fingers and recruits XRCCl, DNA ligase III, DNA polymerase beta and a kinase to the nick, a process called base excision repair (BER). PARP-2 has been shown to oligomerize with PARP1 and therefore is also implicated in BER. The oligomerization has also been shown to stimulate PARP catalytic activity. PARP- 1 is also known for its role in transcription through remodeling of chromatin by PARylating histones and relaxing chromatin structure, thus allowing transcription complex to access genes. Several forms of cancer are more dependent on PARP than regular cells, making PARP an attractive target for chemotherapeutic cancer therapy. \n\n Since PARP acts to repair DNA nicks by BER, whereas the FA-BRCA pathway acts to repair DNA defects by a different mechanism, homologous recombination (HR), it is believed that the combined inhibition of the FA-BRCA pathway and of PARP may be significantly more potent than inhibition of either one alone. \n\n\n As used herein, a \"PARP inhibitor\" refers to a pharmacological agent that reduces DNA repair by PARP. PARP inhibition has been demonstrated to selectively kill tumor cells lacking components of the homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair pathway while sparing normal cells. Known defects in HR repair include the well- characterized hereditary BRCAl and BRCA2 mutations in breast and ovarian cancer, as well as nonhereditary BRCA mutations. \n\n\n Several PARP inhibitors are known in the art and are currently under development, including BSI 201 (BiPar Sciences; 4-iodo-3-nitrobenzamide), olaparib (AZD-2281 ; Astra Zeneca) (4-[(3-[(4-cyclopropylcarbonyl)piperazin-4-yl]carbonyl) -4- fluorophenyl]methyl(2H)phthalazin-l-one), ABT-888 (veliparib) (2-[(R)-2- methylpyrrolidin-2-yl]-lH-benzimidazole-4-carboxamide), CEP-9722 (Cephalon), MK- 4827, KU-0059436 (AZD-2281), LT-673, and 3-aminobenzamide. \n\n\n In one embodiment a PARP inhibitor is a PARP-1 inhibitor. \n\n\n In one embodiment the pharmaceutical composition including (a) a small molecule inhibitor of USP1, (b) a PARP inhibitor, and (c) a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, further includes a DNA cross-linking agent. \n\n\n It should also be understood that, in addition to compounds of Formula III, Formula IV, and Formula V, and pharmaceutical compositions including said compounds, the invention also embraces structurally related active compounds and pharmaceutical compositions including said structurally related active compounds. Such structurally related active compounds are believed to include compounds according to Formula I, Formula IA, and Formula II, below. \n\n\n Definitions of specific functional groups and chemical terms are described in more detail below. For purposes of this invention, the chemical elements are identified in accordance with the Periodic Table of the Elements, CAS version, Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 75\nth\n Ed. , inside cover, and specific functional groups are generally defined as described therein. Additionally, general principles of organic chemistry, as well as specific functional moieties and reactivity, are described in Organic \n\n Chemistry, Thomas Sorrell, University Science Books, Sausalito: 1999, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. \n\n\n Certain compounds of the present invention may exist in particular geometric or stereoisomeric forms. The present invention contemplates all such compounds, including cis- and fraws-isomers, R- and S-enantiomers, diastereomers, (D)-isomers, (L)- isomers, the racemic mixtures thereof, and other mixtures thereof, as falling within the scope of the invention. Additional asymmetric carbon atoms may be present in a substituent such as an alkyl group. All such isomers, as well as mixtures thereof, are intended to be included in this invention. \n\n\n Isomeric mixtures containing any of a variety of isomer ratios may be utilized in accordance with the present invention. For example, where only two isomers are combined, mixtures containing 50:50, 60:40, 70:30, 80:20, 90: 10, 95:5, 96:4, 97:3, 98:2, 99: 1, or 100:0 isomer ratios are all contemplated by the present invention. Those of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that analogous ratios are contemplated for more complex isomer mixtures. \n\n\n If, for instance, a particular enantiomer of a compound of the present invention is desired, it may be prepared by asymmetric synthesis, or by derivation with a chiral auxiliary, where the resulting diastereomeric mixture is separated and the auxiliary group cleaved to provide the pure desired enantiomers. Alternatively, where the molecule contains a basic functional group, such as amino, or an acidic functional group, such as carboxyl, diastereomeric salts are formed with an appropriate optically-active acid or base, followed by resolution of the diastereomers thus formed by fractional \n\n\ncrystallization or chromatographic means well known in the art, and subsequent recovery of the pure enantiomers. \n\n\n One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the synthetic methods, as described herein, utilize a variety of protecting groups. By the term \"protecting group,\" as used herein, it is meant that a particular functional moiety, e.g., O, S, or N, is temporarily blocked so that a reaction can be carried out selectively at another reactive site in a multifunctional compound. In certain embodiments, a protecting group reacts selectively in good yield to give a protected substrate that is stable to the projected reactions; the protecting group should be selectively removable in good yield by readily available, preferably non-toxic reagents that do not attack the other functional groups; \n\n the protecting group forms an easily separable derivative (more preferably without the generation of new stereogenic centers); and the protecting group has a minimum of additional functionality to avoid further sites of reaction. As detailed herein, oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen, and carbon protecting groups may be utilized.

(2008) Letts Org Chem 5:51-4, but this reference does not disclose a use for this compound. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, a compound of Formula II is any one of the following compounds: 2-(2-furanylmethyl)-7-methoxy-l,3(2H,4H)-isoquinolinedione (Registry No. 328039-10-7, Ryan Scientific, Inc.); 2-benzyl-l,3(2H,4H)-isoquinolinedione (Registry No. 21640-31-3, Key Organics Ltd., Camelford, United Kingdom); 2-(4- methoxybenzyl)-l,3(2H,4H)-isoquinolinedione (Registry No. 217493-71-5, Key\n\n\nOrganics, Ltd.); 2-(2-phenylethyl)-l,3(2H,4H)-isoquinolinedione (Registry No. 53558- \n\n 67-1, ChemBridge Corp.); 3-(2-furanylmethyl)-2,4,(lH,3H)-quinazolinedione (Registry No. 436855-78-6, Ryan Scientific, Inc.); 3-(2-furanylmethyl)-l-methyl-2,4,(lH,3H)- quinazolinedione (Registry No. 531504-02-6, Enamine, Kiev, Ukraine); 2-(2- furylmethyl)-lH-isoindole-l,3(2H)-dione (Registry No. 4667-83-8, ChemBridge Corp.); 2-(2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)ethyl)isoquinoline-l,3(2H,4H)-dione (Registry No. 198139- 89-8, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO); and 2-benzo[l,3]dioxol-5-ylmethyl-4H- isoquinoline-l,3-dione (Registry No. 565193-20-6, Ryan Scientific, Inc.). \n\n\n It should be understood that, in addition to compounds of Formula III (933), Formula IV (527), and Formula V (947), and likewise related compounds as disclosed above, and pharmaceutical compositions including said compounds, the invention also embraces pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said compounds and pharmaceutical compositions including said pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said compounds. As used herein, a \"pharmaceutically acceptable salt\" refers to an acid or base form of a compound, usually in combination with a counter ion, that is suitable for use in pharmacy. When used in medicine the salts should be pharmaceutically acceptable, but non-pharmaceutically acceptable salts may conveniently be used to prepare \n\n\npharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Such salts include, but are not limited to, those prepared from the following acids: hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulphuric, nitric, phosphoric, maleic, acetic, salicylic, p-toluene sulphonic, tartaric, citric, methane sulphonic, formic, malonic, succinic, naphthalene-2-sulphonic, and benzene sulphonic. Also, such salts can be prepared as alkaline metal or alkaline earth salts, such as sodium, potassium or calcium salts of the carboxylic acid group. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are well known in the art and are the subject of numerous reviews and monographs such as P. H. Stahl and C. G. Wermuth, editors, Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection and Use, Weinheim/Zurich:Wiley-VCH/VHCA, 2002. \n\n\n The invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions of the invention formulated for targeted delivery to a cancer cell. As used herein, a \"cancer cell\" refers to a living cell in or isolated from a cancer. \"Cancer\" as used herein refers to an uncontrolled growth of cells. Cancers which migrate from their original location and seed vital organs can eventually lead to the death of the subject through the functional deterioration of the affected organs. Cancers include, but are not limited to, basal cell carcinoma, biliary tract cancer; bladder cancer; bone cancer; brain and CNS cancer; \n\n breast cancer; cervical cancer; choriocarcinoma; colon and rectum cancer; connective tissue cancer; cancer of the digestive system; endometrial cancer; esophageal cancer; eye cancer; cancer of the head and neck; gastric cancer; intra-epithelial neoplasm; kidney cancer; larynx cancer; leukemia; liver cancer; lung cancer (e.g. small cell and non-small cell); lymphoma including Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; melanoma; \n\n\nmyeloma; neuroblastoma; oral cavity cancer (e.g., lip, tongue, mouth, and pharynx); ovarian cancer; pancreatic cancer; prostate cancer; retinoblastoma; rhabdomyosarcoma; rectal cancer; renal cancer; cancer of the respiratory system; sarcoma; skin cancer; \n\n\nstomach cancer; testicular cancer; thyroid cancer; uterine cancer; cancer of the urinary system, as well as other carcinomas and sarcomas. \n\n\n Certain cancer cells express cancer antigens on their cell surface, thereby making it possible to target delivery of an agent to the cancer cells. A \"cancer antigen\" as used herein is a compound, such as a peptide or protein, associated with a tumor or cancer cell surface and which is capable of provoking an immune response when expressed on the surface of an antigen presenting cell in the context of an MHC molecule. Some of these antigens are encoded, although not necessarily expressed, by normal cells. These antigens can be characterized as those which are normally silent (i.e., not expressed) in normal cells, those that are expressed only at certain stages of differentiation and those that are temporally expressed such as embryonic and fetal antigens. Other cancer antigens are encoded by mutant cellular genes, such as oncogenes (e.g., activated ras oncogene), suppressor genes (e.g., mutant p53), fusion proteins resulting from internal deletions or chromosomal translocations. Still other cancer antigens can be encoded by viral genes such as those carried on RNA and DNA tumor viruses. Cancer antigens can be prepared from cancer cells either by preparing crude extracts of cancer cells, for example, as described in Cohen, et al., 1994, Cancer Research, 54:1055, by partially purifying the antigens, by recombinant technology, or by de novo synthesis of known antigens. Cancer antigens include but are not limited to antigens that are recombinantly expressed, an immunogenic portion of, or a whole tumor or cancer. Such antigens can be isolated or prepared recombinantly or by any other means known in the art. \n\n\n A pharmaceutical composition formulated for targeted delivery to a cancer cell includes a delivery vehicle that contains or is coated with an active agent, such as a small molecule USPl inhibitor of the invention, linked to a targeting agent that is specific for a \n\n cancer antigen or other target molecule of interest that is present on the cancer cell. A delivery vehicle can be a nanosphere, microsphere, emulsome, liposome, or virosome, any of which can be prepared using methods well known in the art. A targeting agent can be an antigen-specific antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof, a receptor, or counter-receptor. As an example, a receptor-counter-receptor pair can be a growth factor receptor and the corresponding growth factor that binds to the growth factor receptor. In one embodiment, the targeting agent can include biotin or a biotinylated molecule that binds to avidin or streptavidin that is present on the surface of a cancer cell. In one embodiment, the targeting agent can include avidin or streptavidin that binds to biotin or a biotinylated molecule that is present on the surface of a cancer cell. \n\n\n The invention provides a method for inhibiting USP1 -mediated deubiqitination of a ubiquitinated substrate, whereby the ubiquitinated substrate is contacted with a small molecule inhibitor of USP1 selected from the group consisting of a compound of Formula I, a compound of Formula IA, a compound of Formula II, the compound of Formula III (933), the compound of Formula IV (527), the compound of Formula V (947), and any combination thereof, in an amount effective to inhibit USP1 -mediated deubiqitination of the ubiquitinated substrate. In one embodiment the small molecule inhibitor of USP1 is the compound of Formula III (933). In one embodiment the small molecule inhibitor of USP1 is the compound of Formula IV (527). In one embodiment the small molecule inhibitor of USP1 is the compound of Formula V (947). The method can be performed in vitro or in vivo. In one embodiment the ubiquitinated substrate is an isolated ubiquitinated substrate. A substrate or other compound is \"isolated\" when it is substantially separated from other cellular components with which it is found in nature. In one embodiment an isolated substrate is a substrate that has been purified from a natural source. In one embodiment the isolated substrate is expressed artificially by a host cell and then separated from the host cell. \n\n\n In one embodiment the substrate is a natural substrate of USP1. For example, in one embodiment the substrate is ubiquitinated FANCD2 (FANCD2-Ub). In one embodiment the substrate is ubiquitinated PCNA (PCNA-Ub). \n\n\n In one embodiment the substrate is an artificial substrate of USP1. For example, in one embodiment the substrate is ubiquitinated AMC (AMC-Ub). \n\n The invention provides a method for treating a subject having cancer, whereby a small molecule inhibitor of USP1 selected from the group selected from the group consisting of a compound of Formula I, a compound of Formula IA, a compound of Formula II, the compound of Formula III (933), the compound of Formula IV (527), the compound of Formula V (947), and any combination thereof, is administered to a subject having cancer in need of such treatment in an amount effective to treat the cancer. In one embodiment the small molecule inhibitor of USP1 is the compound of Formula III (933). In one embodiment the small molecule inhibitor of USP1 is the compound of Formula IV (527). In one embodiment the small molecule inhibitor of USP1 is the compound of Formula V (947). \n\n\n As used herein, a \"subject having a cancer\" refers to a living mammal with a detectable cancer. In one embodiment the subject is a human. Methods for detecting cancer are well known in the art. Such methods include biopsy, blood smear, bone marrow biopsy, X-ray, CAT scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), radionuclide scanning, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the like. \n\n\n The compound can be administered to the subject using any suitable route of administration. Such routes of administration can include oral, intravenous, \n\n\nintramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravesical, intracistemal, other direct injection (e.g., into a tumor), topical, aerosol to lung, rectal, vaginal, and other mucosal. \n\n\n As used herein, an \"effective amount\" is an amount that is sufficient to realize a desired biological effect. Combined with the teachings provided herein, by choosing among the various active compounds and weighing factors such as potency, relative bioavailability, patient body weight, severity of adverse side-effects and preferred mode of administration, an effective prophylactic or therapeutic treatment regimen can be planned which does not cause substantial toxicity and yet is effective to treat the particular subject. The effective amount for any particular application can vary depending on such factors as the disease or condition being treated, the particular active agent being administered, the size of the subject, or the severity of the disease or condition. One of ordinary skill in the art can empirically determine the effective amount of a particular active agent and/or other therapeutic agent without necessitating undue experimentation. It is preferred generally that a maximum dose be used, that is, the highest safe dose according to sound medical judgment. Multiple doses per day may \n\n be contemplated to achieve appropriate systemic levels of compounds. Appropriate systemic levels can be determined by, for example, measurement of the patient's peak or sustained plasma level of the drug. \"Dose\" and \"dosage\" are used interchangeably herein. \n\n\n For any compound described herein the therapeutically effective amount can be initially determined from animal models. A therapeutically effective dose can also be determined from human data for active agents which have been tested in humans and for compounds which are known to exhibit similar pharmacological activities, such as other related active agents. Higher doses may be required for enteral administration as compared to parenteral administration. The applied dose can be adjusted based on the relative bioavailability and potency of the administered compound. Adjusting the dose to achieve maximal efficacy based on the methods described above and other methods as are well-known in the art is well within the capabilities of the ordinarily skilled artisan. \n\n\n Generally, daily oral doses of active compounds will be from about 0.01 milligrams/kg per day to 1000 milligrams/kg per day. It is expected that oral doses in the range of 0.5 to 50 milligrams/kg, in one or several administrations per day, will yield the desired results. Dosage may be adjusted appropriately to achieve desired drug levels, local or systemic, depending upon the mode of administration. For example, it is expected that intravenous administration would be from an order to several orders of magnitude lower dose per day. In the event that the response in a subject is insufficient at such doses, even higher doses (or effective higher doses by a different, more localized delivery route) may be employed to the extent that patient tolerance permits. Multiple doses per day are contemplated to achieve appropriate systemic levels of compounds. \n\n\n As used herein, the term \"treat\" means to reduce or ameliorate a disease or condition by a detectable amount or degree. The term \"treat\" as used herein refers to both complete and partial treatment. In the context of cancer, the term \"treat\" as used herein thus can refer to complete or partial remission of a cancer. For example, treating a tumor may be manifest as a halted or slowed progression in the size or volume of a tumor, a decrease in the size or volume of a tumor, or complete resolution of a tumor. \n\n\n The method can be combined with at least one additional cancer treatment agent.\n\n\nFor example, in one embodiment the method further includes administering to the subject a DNA cross-linking agent. In one embodiment the method further includes \n\n administering to the subject a PARP inhibitor. In one embodiment the method further includes administering to the subject a DNA cross-linking agent and a PARP inhibitor. The additional cancer treatment agent can be administered either essentially \n\n\nsimultaneously or sequentially with respect to the administering of the small molecule USPl inhibitor. When the administering is sequential, either agent can be administered before the other. Alternatively or in addition, the administering of the small molecule USPl inhibitor and the administering of the at least one additional cancer treatment agent can be at least partially overlapping in time or non-overlapping in time. Furthermore, the administering of the small molecule USPl inhibitor and the administering of the at least one additional cancer treatment agent can be accomplished using the same or different routes of administration, as may be appropriate. \n\n\n It is believed that cancers that do not express USPl are particularly sensitive to DNA cross-linking agents. It is also believed that cancers that do not express UAF1 are particularly sensitive to DNA cross-linking agents. Conversely, it is believed that cancers that do express USPl are resistant to DNA cross-linking agents. It is also believed that cancers that do express USP 1 and UAF1 are particularly resistant to DNA cross-linking agents. A cancer that does express USPl can therefore be sensitized to DNA cross-linking agents by contacting the cancer with a USPl inhibitor. \n\n\n The invention provides a method for sensitizing a cancer to a DNA cross-linking agent, whereby a cancer is contacted with a small molecule inhibitor of USPl selected from the group selected from the group consisting of a compound of Formula I, a compound of Formula IA, a compound of Formula II, the compound of Formula III (933), the compound of Formula IV (527), the compound of Formula V (947), and any combination thereof, in an amount effective to sensitize the cancer to a DNA cross- linking agent. In one embodiment the small molecule inhibitor of USPl is the compound of Formula III (933). In one embodiment the small molecule inhibitor of USPl is the compound of Formula IV (527). In one embodiment the small molecule inhibitor of USPl is the compound of Formula V (947). The method can be performed in vitro or in vivo. In one embodiment the cancer expresses USPl. In one embodiment the cancer expresses both USPl and UAF1. \n\n\n As used herein, to \"sensitize\" means to make more susceptible. A cancer or cancer cell is sensitized to a DNA cross-linking agent according to the method when it is \n\n made more susceptible to the DNA cross-linking agent than it was, or otherwise would have been, without the contacting with the small molecule USPl inhibitor. \n\n\n In one embodiment the DNA cross-linking agent is a chemotherapy agent selected from the group consisting of cisplatin, carboplatin, oxaliplatin, alkylating agents, mitomycin C, and any combination thereof. In one embodiment the DNA cross- linking agent is cisplatin. \n\n\n In one embodiment the DNA cross-linking agent is ionizing radiation, for example, X-ray therapy, cobalt-60 gamma ray irradiation, cesium- 137 gamma ray irradiation, iridium- 192 gamma ray irradiation, other external beam radiotherapy, and brachytherapy. \n\n\n The invention provides a method to identify a cancer that is responsive to USPl inhibition, whereby cancer cells from a cancer are contacted with a small molecule inhibitor of USPl selected from the group consisting of a compound of Formula I, a compound of Formula IA, a compound of Formula II, the compound of Formula III (933), the compound of Formula IV (527), the compound of Formula V (947), and any combination thereof; and measuring USPl activity in the cancer cells contacted with the small molecule inhibitor of USPl, wherein reduced USPl activity in the cancer cells contacted with the small molecule inhibitor of USPl relative to control USPl activity in the cancer cells not contacted with the small molecule inhibitor of USPl identifies the cancer as a cancer that that is responsive to USPl inhibition. In one embodiment the small molecule inhibitor of USPl is the compound of Formula III (933). In one embodiment the small molecule inhibitor of USPl is the compound of Formula IV (527). In one embodiment the small molecule inhibitor of USPl is the compound of Formula V (947). The method can be performed in vitro or in vivo. Alternatively or in addition, individual steps of the method can be performed, independent of each other, in vitro or in vivo. In vitro methods and, likewise, in vitro method steps, can be performed in a cell- free assay or in a cell-based assay. \n\n\n The term \"cancer cells from a cancer\" as used herein can refer to cancer cells isolated from a cancer or to cancer cells in situ in a cancer. \n\n\n In one embodiment the method is a method to identify a subject having a cancer that is responsive to USPl inhibition, whereby cancer cells from a subject having a cancer are contacted with a small molecule inhibitor of USPl selected from the group \n\n consisting of a compound of Formula I, a compound of Formula IA, a compound of Formula II, the compound of Formula III (933), the compound of Formula IV (527), the compound of Formula V (947), and any combination thereof; and measuring USPl activity in the cancer cells contacted with the small molecule inhibitor of USPl, wherein reduced USPl activity in the cancer cells contacted with the small molecule inhibitor of USPl relative to control USPl activity in the cancer cells not contacted with the small molecule inhibitor of USPl identifies the subject as a subject having a cancer that that is responsive to USPl inhibition. \n\n\n The term \"cancer cells from a subject having a cancer\" as used herein can refer to cancer cells isolated from a subject having a cancer or to cancer cells in situ in subject having a cancer. \n\n\n USPl activity can be measured by any of the assays described herein. For example, activity can be measured by measuring the level of deubiquitinated target protein in response to USPl/UAFl (that is, for example, the conversion of AMC-Ub to AMC). In one embodiment, an assay to measure USPl deubiquitination activity includes the steps of contacting a preparation comprising USPl (and optionallyUAFl) with a ubiquitinated target, e.g., AMC-Ub, and measuring fluorescence emission. \n\n\nCleavage of ubiquitin from AMC-Ub releases the fluorogenic AMC moiety, which can be detected as an increase in fluorescence emission at 460 nm (λ\nεχ\n=380 nm). Dang et al. (1998) Biochemistry 37:1868-79. \n\n\n For measurement of USPl activity in a cell-based assay, levels of ubiquitinated FANCD2-Ub and unubiquitinated FANCD2, or levels of ubiquitinated PCNA-Ub and unubiquitinated PCNA can be measured, for example by immunoblotting whole cell lysates with anti-FANCD2 antibody (e.g., sc-20022; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or anti-PCNA antibody (e.g., sc-56; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), respectively. \n\n\n Assays to determine the deubiquitinase activity of USPl can be performed in a cell-based assay, for example, in which USPl (and optionally UAF1) are recombinantly expressed in a cell (such as E. coli or SF9 insect cells) along with the target, or in a cell- free assay in which, for example, USPl (or a USPl/UAFl complex) is contacted in vitro with a candidate inhibitor in the presence of a ubiquitinated target. \n\n\n The invention provides a method to identify a cancer that is responsive to combined DNA cross-linking therapy and USPl inhibition, whereby cancer cells from a \n\n cancer are contacted with a DNA cross-linking agent and a small molecule inhibitor of USPl selected from the group consisting of a compound of Formula I, a compound of Formula IA, a compound of Formula II, the compound of Formula III (933), the compound of Formula IV (527), the compound of Formula V (947), and any \n\n\ncombination thereof; and proliferation of the cancer cells contacted with the DNA cross- linking agent and the small molecule inhibitor of USPl is measured, wherein reduced proliferation of the cancer cells contacted with the DNA cross-linking agent and the small molecule inhibitor of USPl relative to control proliferation of the cancer cells contacted with the DNA cross-linking agent but not the small molecule USPl inhibitor identifies the cancer as a cancer that is responsive to DNA cross-linking therapy together with USPl inhibition. In one embodiment the small molecule inhibitor of USPl is the compound of Formula III (933). In one embodiment the small molecule inhibitor of USPl is the compound of Formula IV (527). In one embodiment the small molecule inhibitor of USPl is the compound of Formula V (947). The method can be performed in vitro or in vivo. Alternatively or in addition, individual steps of the method can be performed, independent of each other, in vitro or in vivo. In vitro methods and, likewise, in vitro method steps, can be performed in a cell-free assay or in a cell-based assay. \n\n\n In one embodiment the method is a method to identify a subject having a cancer that is responsive to combined DNA cross-linking therapy and USPl inhibition, whereby cancer cells from a subject having a cancer are contacted with a DNA cross-linking agent and a small molecule inhibitor of USPl selected from group consisting of a compound of Formula I, a compound of Formula IA, a compound of Formula II, the compound of Formula III (933), the compound of Formula IV (527), the compound of Formula V (947), and any combination thereof; and proliferation of the cancer cells contacted with the DNA cross-linking agent and the small molecule inhibitor of USPl is measured, wherein reduced proliferation of the cancer cells contacted with the DNA cross-linking agent and the small molecule inhibitor of USPl relative to control proliferation of the cancer cells contacted with the DNA cross-linking agent but not the small molecule USPl inhibitor identifies the subject as a subject having a cancer that is responsive to DNA cross-linking therapy together with USPl inhibition. \n\n\n The term \"combined DNA cross-linking therapy and USPl inhibition\" as used herein refers to any combination of DNA cross-linking therapy and USPl inhibition. \n\n \"DNA cross-linking therapy\" refers to the administration to a subject of at least one DNA cross-linking agent, as defined herein. \"USPl inhibition\" refers to the \n\n\nadministration to a subject of at least one small molecule USPl inhibitor. In one embodiment a small molecule USPl inhibitor is a small molecule USPl inhibitor of the invention. The administration of the DNA cross-linking agent and the USPl inhibitor can be accomplished either essentially simultaneously or sequentially with respect to the administering of the USPl inhibitor. When the administering is sequential, either agent can be administered before the other. Alternatively or in addition, the administering of the small molecule USPl inhibitor and the administering of the at least one DNA cross- linking agent can be at least partially overlapping in time or non-overlapping in time. Furthermore, the administering of the small molecule USPl inhibitor and the \n\n\nadministering of the at least one DNA cross-linking agent can be accomplished using the same or different routes of administration, as may be appropriate. \n\n\n The formulations of the invention are administered in pharmaceutically acceptable solutions, which may routinely contain pharmaceutically acceptable concentrations of salt, buffering agents, preservatives, compatible carriers, adjuvants, and optionally other therapeutic ingredients. \n\n\n For use in therapy, an effective amount of the active agent can be administered to a subject by any mode that delivers the active agent to the desired surface. \n\n\nAdministering the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may be accomplished by any means known to the skilled artisan. Preferred routes of administration include but are not limited to oral, parenteral, intramuscular, intranasal, sublingual, intratracheal, inhalation, ocular, vaginal, and rectal. \n\n\n For oral administration, the compounds (e.g., compounds of Formula III-V, and other therapeutic agents) can be formulated readily by combining the active compound(s) with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers well known in the art. Such carriers enable the compounds of the invention to be formulated as tablets, pills, dragees, capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions and the like, for oral ingestion by a subject to be treated. Pharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be obtained as solid excipient, optionally grinding a resulting mixture, and processing the mixture of granules, after adding suitable auxiliaries, if desired, to obtain tablets or dragee cores. Suitable excipients are, in particular, fillers such as sugars, including lactose, sucrose, mannitol, \n\n or sorbitol; cellulose preparations such as, for example, maize starch, wheat starch, rice starch, potato starch, gelatin, gum tragacanth, methyl cellulose, \n\n\nhydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and/or \n\n\npolyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). If desired, disintegrating agents may be added, such as the cross-linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, agar, or alginic acid or a salt thereof such as sodium alginate. Optionally the oral formulations may also be formulated in saline or buffers, i.e. EDTA for neutralizing internal acid conditions or may be administered without any carriers. \n\n\n Also specifically contemplated are oral dosage forms of the above component or components. The component or components may be chemically modified so that oral delivery of the derivative is efficacious. Generally, the chemical modification contemplated is the attachment of at least one moiety to the component molecule itself, where said moiety permits (a) inhibition of proteolysis; and (b) uptake into the blood stream from the stomach or intestine. Also desired is the increase in overall stability of the component or components and increase in circulation time in the body. Examples of such moieties include: polyethylene glycol, copolymers of ethylene glycol and propylene glycol, carboxymethyl cellulose, dextran, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone and polyproline. Abuchowski and Davis, 1981, \"Soluble Polymer-Enzyme Adducts\" In: Enzymes as Drugs, Hocenberg and Roberts, eds., Wiley-Interscience, New York, NY, pp. 367-383; Newmark, et al., 1982, J. Appl. Biochem. 4: 185-189. Other polymers that could be used are poly-1,3- dioxolane and poly-l,3,6-tioxocane. Preferred for pharmaceutical usage, as indicated above, are polyethylene glycol moieties. \n\n\n For the component (or derivative) the location of release may be the stomach, the small intestine (the duodenum, the jejunum, or the ileum), or the large intestine. One skilled in the art has available formulations which will not dissolve in the stomach, yet will release the material in the duodenum or elsewhere in the intestine. Preferably, the release will avoid the deleterious effects of the stomach environment, either by protection of the active agent (or derivative) or by release of the biologically active material beyond the stomach environment, such as in the intestine. \n\n\n To ensure full gastric resistance a coating impermeable to at least pH 5.0 is essential. Examples of the more common inert ingredients that are used as enteric coatings are cellulose acetate trimellitate (CAT), hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate (HPMCP), \n\n HPMCP 50, HPMCP 55, polyvinyl acetate phthalate (PVAP), Eudragit L30D, Aquateric, cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP), Eudragit L, Eudragit S, and Shellac. These coatings may be used as mixed films. \n\n\n A coating or mixture of coatings can also be used on tablets, which are not intended for protection against the stomach. This can include sugar coatings, or coatings which make the tablet easier to swallow. Capsules may consist of a hard shell (such as gelatin) for delivery of dry therapeutic i.e. powder; for liquid forms, a soft gelatin shell may be used. The shell material of cachets could be thick starch or other edible paper. For pills, lozenges, molded tablets or tablet triturates, moist massing techniques can be used. \n\n\n The therapeutic can be included in the formulation as fine multi-particulates in the form of granules or pellets of particle size about 1 mm. The formulation of the material for capsule administration could also be as a powder, lightly compressed plugs or even as tablets. The therapeutic could be prepared by compression. \n\n\n Colorants and flavoring agents may all be included. For example, the active agent (or derivative) may be formulated (such as by liposome or microsphere encapsulation) and then further contained within an edible product, such as a refrigerated beverage containing colorants and flavoring agents. \n\n\n One may dilute or increase the volume of the therapeutic with an inert material. These diluents could include carbohydrates, especially mannitol, a-lactose, anhydrous lactose, cellulose, sucrose, modified dextrans and starch. Certain inorganic salts may be also be used as fillers including calcium triphosphate, magnesium carbonate and sodium chloride. Some commercially available diluents are Fast-Flo, Emdex, STA-Rx 1500, Emcompress and Avicell. \n\n\n Disintegrants may be included in the formulation of the therapeutic into a solid dosage form. Materials used as disintegrates include but are not limited to starch, including the commercial disintegrant based on starch, Explotab. Sodium starch glycolate, Amberlite, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, ultramylopectin, sodium alginate, gelatin, orange peel, acid carboxymethyl cellulose, natural sponge and bentonite may all be used. Another form of the disintegrants are the insoluble cationic exchange resins. Powdered gums may be used as disintegrants and as binders and these can include powdered gums such as agar, Karaya or tragacanth. Alginic acid and its sodium salt are also useful as disintegrants. \n\n Binders may be used to hold the therapeutic agent together to form a hard tablet and include materials from natural products such as acacia, tragacanth, starch and gelatin. Others include methyl cellulose (MC), ethyl cellulose (EC) and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). Polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) could both be used in alcoholic solutions to granulate the therapeutic. \n\n\n An anti-frictional agent may be included in the formulation of the therapeutic to prevent sticking during the formulation process. Lubricants may be used as a layer between the therapeutic and the die wall, and these can include but are not limited to; stearic acid including its magnesium and calcium salts, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), liquid paraffin, vegetable oils and waxes. Soluble lubricants may also be used such as sodium lauryl sulfate, magnesium lauryl sulfate, polyethylene glycol of various molecular weights, Carbowax 4000 and 6000. \n\n\n Glidants that might improve the flow properties of the drug during formulation and to aid rearrangement during compression might be added. The glidants may include starch, talc, pyrogenic silica and hydrated silicoaluminate. \n\n\n To aid dissolution of the therapeutic into the aqueous environment a surfactant might be added as a wetting agent. Surfactants may include anionic detergents such as sodium lauryl sulfate, dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate and dioctyl sodium sulfonate. Cationic detergents might be used and could include benzalkonium chloride or benzethomium chloride. The list of potential non-ionic detergents that could be included in the formulation as surfactants are lauromacrogol 400, polyoxyl 40 stearate, polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil 10, 50 and 60, glycerol monostearate, polysorbate 40, 60, 65 and 80, sucrose fatty acid ester, methyl cellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose. These surfactants could be present in the formulation of the active agent or derivative either alone or as a mixture in different ratios. \n\n\n Pharmaceutical preparations which can be used orally include push- fit capsules made of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticizer, such as glycerol or sorbitol. The push-fit capsules can contain the active ingredients in admixture with filler such as lactose, binders such as starches, and/or lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate and, optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active compounds may be dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, liquid paraffin, or liquid polyethylene glycols. In addition, stabilizers may be added. \n\n Microspheres formulated for oral administration may also be used. Such microspheres have been well defined in the art. All formulations for oral administration should be in dosages suitable for such administration. \n\n\n For buccal administration, the compositions may take the form of tablets or lozenges formulated in conventional manner. \n\n\n For administration by inhalation, the compounds for use according to the present invention may be conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from pressurized packs or a nebulizer, with the use of a suitable propellant, e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges of e.g. gelatin for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch. \n\n\n Also contemplated herein is pulmonary delivery of the active agents (or derivatives thereof). The active agent (or derivative) is delivered to the lungs of a mammal while inhaling and traverses across the lung epithelial lining to the blood stream. Other reports of inhaled molecules include Adjei et al., 1990, Pharmaceutical Research, 7:565-569; Adjei et al., 1990, International Journal of Pharmaceutics, 63: 135-144 (leuprolide acetate); \n\n\nBraquet et al., 1989, Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology, 13(suppl. 5):143-146 (endothelin-1); Hubbard et al., 1989, Annals of Internal Medicine, Vol. Ill, pp. 206-212 (al- antitrypsin); Smith et al., 1989, J. Clin. Invest. 84:1145-1146 (a- 1 -proteinase); Oswein et al., 1990, \"Aerosolization of Proteins\", Proceedings of Symposium on Respiratory Drug Delivery II, Keystone, Colorado, March, (recombinant human growth hormone); Debs et al., 1988, J. Immunol. 140:3482-3488 (interferon-g and tumor necrosis factor alpha) and Platz et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,284,656 (granulocyte colony stimulating factor). A method and composition for pulmonary delivery of drugs for systemic effect is described in U.S. Patent No. 5,451,569, issued September 19, 1995 to Wong et al. \n\n\n Contemplated for use in the practice of this invention are a wide range of mechanical devices designed for pulmonary delivery of therapeutic products, including but not limited to nebulizers, metered dose inhalers, and powder inhalers, all of which are familiar to those skilled in the art. \n\n Some specific examples of commercially available devices suitable for the practice of this invention are the Ultravent nebulizer, manufactured by Mallinckrodt, Inc., \n\n\nSt. Louis, Missouri; the Acorn II nebulizer, manufactured by Marquest Medical Products, Englewood, Colorado; the Ventolin metered dose inhaler, manufactured by Glaxo Inc., Research Triangle Park, North Carolina; and the Spinhaler powder inhaler, manufactured by Fisons Corp., Bedford, Massachusetts. \n\n\n All such devices require the use of formulations suitable for the dispensing of active agent (or derivative). Typically, each formulation is specific to the type of device employed and may involve the use of an appropriate propellant material, in addition to the usual diluents, adjuvants and/or carriers useful in therapy. Also, the use of liposomes, microcapsules or microspheres, inclusion complexes, or other types of carriers is contemplated. Chemically modified active agent may also be prepared in different formulations depending on the type of chemical modification or the type of device employed. \n\n\n Formulations suitable for use with a nebulizer, either jet or ultrasonic, will typically comprise active agent (or derivative) dissolved in water at a concentration of about 0.1 to 25 mg of biologically active active agent per mL of solution. The formulation may also include a buffer and a simple sugar (e.g., for active agent stabilization and regulation of osmotic pressure). The nebulizer formulation may also contain a surfactant, to reduce or prevent surface induced aggregation of the active agent caused by atomization of the solution in forming the aerosol. \n\n\n Formulations for use with a metered-dose inhaler device will generally comprise a finely divided powder containing the active agent (or derivative) suspended in a propellant with the aid of a surfactant. The propellant may be any conventional material employed for this purpose, such as a chlorofluorocarbon, a hydrochlorofluorocarbon, a \n\n\nhydrofluorocarbon, or a hydrocarbon, including trichlorofluoromethane, \n\n\ndichlorodifluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethanol, and 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, or combinations thereof. Suitable surfactants include sorbitan trioleate and soya lecithin. Oleic acid may also be useful as a surfactant. \n\n\n Formulations for dispensing from a powder inhaler device will comprise a finely divided dry powder containing active agent (or derivative) and may also include a bulking agent, such as lactose, sorbitol, sucrose, or mannitol in amounts which facilitate dispersal of \n\n the powder from the device, e.g., 50 to 90% by weight of the formulation. The active agent (or derivative) should most advantageously be prepared in particulate form with an average particle size of less than 10 micrometers (μιη), most preferably 0.5 to 5 μιη, for most effective delivery to the distal lung. \n\n\n Nasal delivery of a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is also contemplated. Nasal delivery allows the passage of a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention to the blood stream directly after administering the therapeutic product to the nose, without the necessity for deposition of the product in the lung. Formulations for nasal delivery include those with dextran or cyclodextran. \n\n\n For nasal administration, a useful device is a small, hard bottle to which a metered dose sprayer is attached. In one embodiment, the metered dose is delivered by drawing the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention solution into a chamber of defined volume, which chamber has an aperture dimensioned to aerosolize and aerosol formulation by forming a spray when a liquid in the chamber is compressed. The chamber is compressed to administer the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. In a specific embodiment, the chamber is a piston arrangement. Such devices are commercially available. \n\n\n Alternatively, a plastic squeeze bottle with an aperture or opening dimensioned to aerosolize an aerosol formulation by forming a spray when squeezed is used. The opening is usually found in the top of the bottle, and the top is generally tapered to partially fit in the nasal passages for efficient administration of the aerosol formulation. Preferably, the nasal inhaler will provide a metered amount of the aerosol formulation, for administration of a measured dose of the drug. \n\n\n The compounds, when it is desirable to deliver them systemically, may be formulated for parenteral administration by injection, e.g., by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. \n\n\n Pharmaceutical formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of the active compounds in water-soluble form. Additionally, suspensions of \n\n the active compounds may be prepared as appropriate oily injection suspensions. \n\n\n Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils such as sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, such as ethyl oleate or triglycerides, or liposomes. Aqueous injection suspensions may contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran. Optionally, the suspension may also contain suitable stabilizers or agents which increase the solubility of the compounds to allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions. \n\n\n Alternatively, the active compounds may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile pyrogen-free water, before use. \n\n\n The compounds may also be formulated in rectal or vaginal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g. , containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides. \n\n\n In addition to the formulations described previously, the compounds may also be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long acting formulations may be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, for example, as a sparingly soluble salt. \n\n\n The pharmaceutical compositions also may comprise suitable solid or gel phase carriers or exeipients. Examples of such carriers or exeipients include but are not limited to calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, various sugars, starches, cellulose derivatives, gelatin, and polymers such as polyethylene glycols. \n\n\n Suitable liquid or solid pharmaceutical preparation forms are, for example, aqueous or saline solutions for inhalation, microencapsulated, encochleated, coated onto microscopic gold particles, contained in liposomes, nebulized, aerosols, pellets for implantation into the skin, or dried onto a sharp object to be scratched into the skin. The pharmaceutical compositions also include granules, powders, tablets, coated tablets,\n\n\n(micro)capsules, suppositories, syrups, emulsions, suspensions, creams, drops or preparations with protracted release of active compounds, in whose preparation exeipients and additives and/or auxiliaries such as disintegrants, binders, coating agents, swelling agents, lubricants, flavorings, sweeteners or solubilizers are customarily used as described above. The pharmaceutical compositions are suitable for use in a variety of \n\n drug delivery systems. For a brief review of methods for drug delivery, see Langer, Science 249: 1527-1533, 1990, which is incorporated herein by reference. \n\n\n The active agents and optionally other therapeutics may be administered per se (neat) or in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. When used in medicine the salts should be pharmaceutically acceptable, but non-pharmaceutically acceptable salts may conveniently be used to prepare pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Such salts include, but are not limited to, those prepared from the following acids: \n\n\nhydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulphuric, nitric, phosphoric, maleic, acetic, salicylic, p- toluene sulphonic, tartaric, citric, methane sulphonic, formic, malonic, succinic, naphthalene-2-sulphonic, and benzene sulphonic. Also, such salts can be prepared as alkaline metal or alkaline earth salts, such as sodium, potassium or calcium salts of the carboxylic acid group. \n\n\n Suitable buffering agents include: acetic acid and a salt (1-2% w/v); citric acid and a salt (1-3% w/v); boric acid and a salt (0.5-2.5% w/v); and phosphoric acid and a salt (0.8-2% w/v). Suitable preservatives include benzalkonium chloride (0.003-0.03% w/v); chlorobutanol (0.3-0.9% w/v); parabens (0.01-0.25% w/v) and thimerosal (0.004- 0.02% w/v). \n\n\n The therapeutic agent(s), including specifically but not limited to the active agent, may be provided in particles. Particles as used herein means nano or microparticles (or in some instances larger) which can consist in whole or in part of the active agent or the other therapeutic agent(s) as described herein. The particles may contain the therapeutic agent(s) in a core surrounded by a coating, including, but not limited to, an enteric coating. The therapeutic agent(s) also may be dispersed throughout the particles. The therapeutic agent(s) also may be adsorbed into the particles. The particles may be of any order release kinetics, including zero order release, first order release, second order release, delayed release, sustained release, immediate release, and any combination thereof, etc. The particle may include, in addition to the therapeutic agent(s), any of those materials routinely used in the art of pharmacy and medicine, including, but not limited to, erodible, nonerodible, biodegradable, or nonbiodegradable material or combinations thereof. The particles may be microcapsules which contain the active agent in a solution or in a semi-solid state. The particles may be of virtually any shape. \n\n Both non-biodegradable and biodegradable polymeric materials can be used in the manufacture of particles for delivering the therapeutic agent(s). Such polymers may be natural or synthetic polymers. The polymer is selected based on the period of time over which release is desired. Bioadhesive polymers of particular interest include bioerodible hydrogels described by H.S. Sawhney, CP. Pathak and J.A. Hubell in Macromolecules, (1993) 26:581-587, the teachings of which are incorporated herein. These include polyhyaluronic acids, casein, gelatin, glutin, poly anhydrides, polyacrylic acid, alginate, chitosan, poly(methyl methacrylates), poly(ethyl methacrylates), poly (butylmethacry late), poly(isobutyl methacrylate), poly(hexylmethacrylate), poly(isodecyl methacrylate), poly(lauryl methacrylate), poly(phenyl methacrylate), poly(methyl acrylate), poly(isopropyl acrylate), poly(isobutyl acrylate), and \n\n\npoly(octadecyl acrylate). \n\n\n The therapeutic agent(s) may be contained in controlled release systems. The term \"controlled release\" is intended to refer to any drug-containing formulation in which the manner and profile of drug release from the formulation are controlled. This refers to immediate as well as non-immediate release formulations, with non-immediate release formulations including but not limited to sustained release and delayed release formulations. The term \"sustained release\" (also referred to as \"extended release\") is used in its conventional sense to refer to a drug formulation that provides for gradual release of a drug over an extended period of time, and that preferably, although not necessarily, results in substantially constant blood levels of a drug over an extended time period. The term \"delayed release\" is used in its conventional sense to refer to a drug formulation in which there is a time delay between administration of the formulation and the release of the drug there from. \"Delayed release\" may or may not involve gradual release of drug over an extended period of time, and thus may or may not be \"sustained release.\" \n\n\n Use of a long-term sustained release implant may be particularly suitable for treatment of chronic conditions. \"Long-term\" release, as used herein, means that the implant is constructed and arranged to deliver therapeutic levels of the active ingredient for at least 7 days, and preferably 30-60 days. Long-term sustained release implants are well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art and include some of the release systems described above. \n\n The present invention is further illustrated by the following Examples, which in no way should be construed as further limiting. The entire contents of all of the references (including literature references, issued patents, published patent applications, and co-pending patent applications, if any) cited throughout this application are hereby expressly incorporated by reference. \n\n\nEXAMPLES \n\n\n Materials and Methods \n\n\n Cell Lines, enzymes and compounds \n\n\n HeLa and U20S-DRGFP cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and penicillin/streptomycin glutamine (Invitrogen). Purified USP5 enzyme was purchased from Boston Biochem. UCH-Ll and UCL-H3 were as reported previously (Mermerian et al, Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters, 17:3729). C526 was synthesized and the purity validated by high-performance liquid chromatography. \n\n\nPurification of USP1 and UAF1 protein complex \n\n\n The co-purification of USP1/UAF1 complex was performed as described previously (Cohn et al, Mol Cell, 2007). N-terminal His-tagged USP1 GG670/671AA was expressed using pFASTBac-HTa vector (Invitrogen), and UAF1 were expressed using pFASTBac-1 vector (Invitrogen). Each recombinant virus was produced by transfecting the corresponding bacmid to Sf9 cells. For the purification, cell pellets were re-suspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM BME, 10 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol, and 0.2% Triton X-100) and sonicated to lyse. Lysates were centrifuged, and the supernatants were incubated with Ni-NTA agarose resin (QIAGEN) for 1 hr. The resin was washed extensively, and the proteins were eluted in elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM BME, 10% glycerol, and 250 mM imidazole). Eluted protein was bound to a 5 ml HiTrap Q-FF cartridge (GE Biosciences), washed with washing buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 100 mM KC1, 5 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 10% glycerol), eluted in the same buffer containing 500 mM KC1 and stocked at -80°C. After final purification, the protein concentration was \n\n measured using Bradford assay and the quality of the protein was determined by SDS- PAGE and coomassie blue staining. \n\n\nIn Vitro Deubiquitination Assay \n\n\n The in vitro enzymatic assays were performed using purified proteins from Sf9 cells as described previously (Cohn et al.). The assays using ubiquitin-AMC (Ub-7- amido-4-methylcoumarin; Boston Biochem) as substrate was carried out in a reaction buffer containing 20 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.8), 20 mM NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml ovalbumin, 0.5 mM EDTA and 10 mM dithiothreitol. The fluorescence was measured by FluoStar Galaxy Fluorometer (BMG Labtech). For the Ub-vinylsulfone (VS) assay, the proteins were incubated with Ub-VS at 0.5 μΜ final concentration for 1 h at 30 °C, followed by the immunoblotting analysis. \n\n\nHigh Throughput Screening \n\n\n The ubiquitin-Rho based enzyme assay for high throughput screening was established in a 384- well format. The reaction buffer containing and USP1/UAF1 complex were added in 384 well plates using automated liquid handling robot- Bio-Tek Microfill (Bio-Tek Instrments Inc., VT), followed by addition of the compounds (in DMSO) from the compound library plates to wells using a pin transfer robotic system at a final concentration of 10 μΜ. The reaction was composed of 0.1 nM purified \n\n\n USP1/UAF complex, 75 nM ubiquitin Rhodamine (Ub-Rho, Boston Biochem, U-600) and 2 μΜ ubiquitin. Fluorescence was monitored in a FluoStar Galaxy Fluorometer (BMG Labtech). Fluorescence emission at 535 nm (λβχ = 485 nm) was measured in an automated plate reader Envision 2 (Perkin Elmer, MA). \n\n\nClonogenic Assay \n\n\n Cells were seeded in 6- well plate at 500 cells per well followed by treatment with C527. Colonies were allowed to grow for 7-10 days, fixed with a solution containing 10% Methanol and 10% acetic acid at room temperature for 15 min and then stained with 1% crystal violet in methanol. Colonies of >50 cells were counted, and the surviving fraction was calculated and normalized to untreated control. \n\n HR Analysis \n\n\n HR repair activity was analyzed using DR-GFP reporter as previously described (Pierce AJ et al, Genes Dev, 13: 2633). U20S-DRGFP cells carrying a chromosomally integrated single copy of HR repair substrate were used to test the effect of C527 on HR. DSB-induced HR results in restoration and expression of GFP and was quantified by FACS. Briefly, 24 h after induction of chromosomal double-strand breaks through the expression of I-Scel, cells were treated with C527 for 24 h. Cells were subjected to FACS analysis and the percentage of GFP-positive cells was quantitated relative to the total viable cell number. For each analysis, 100,000 cells were processed. \n\n\nImmunofluorescence \n\n\n Cells were pre-extracted with extraction buffer (0.25% Triton-XlOO in 200 mM HEPES at pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl\n2\n and 300 mM sucrose) on ice for 2 min prior to fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde. RAD51 foci were detected using anti- RAD51 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and visualized using Alexa Fluor 488- conjugated secondary antibody. The quantification of cells with RAD51 foci was performed by counting the number of cells with RAD51 foci. At least 200 cells were counted from each sample. Data are represented as mean + SD from three independent experiments. \n\n\nMTT assay \n\n\n HeLa cells were seeded in 96-well plate and treated with C527 for 4 more days. 20 μΕ MTT (Sigma) at 5 mg/mL was added to each well and cells were left at 37 °C for incubation. 4 h later, the metabolic product was dissolved in a solution containing 10% SDS, 5% isopropanol and O.Olmol/L HCl. Optical density at 565 nm was measured in an automated plate reader. The percentage of cell survival was determined by normalizing to solvent vehicle treated cells. \n\n\nExample 1. Recombinant USP1 \n\n\n Recombinant USP1 protein purified from Sf9 cells was expressed using pFastBac-HTa vector (Invitrogen) containing an N-terminal His tag. For USP1 and \n\n USP1/UAF1 complex purification, cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol and 0.2% Triton X-100) and sonicated to lyse. Lysates were centrifuged and the supernatants were incubated with Ni-NTA agarose resin (Qiagen) for 1 hour. The resin was washed extensively and the proteins eluted in elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol and 250 mM imidazole). Eluted protein was bound to a 5 mL HiTrap Q-FF cartridge (GE Biosciences), washed with washing buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM KC1, 5 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA and 10% glycerol) and eluted in the same buffer containing 500 mM KC1. \n\n\nExample 2. Recombinant UAF1 \n\n\n Recombinant UAF1 protein purified from Sf9 cells was expressed using pFastBac-1 vector (Invitrogen) with an engineered C-terminal Strep II tag. Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, 10% glycerol), centrifuged, and the clarified lysate was incubated for 1 hour with the Strep-Tactin resin (Novagen). Following incubation, the resin was washed extensively and the protein eluted in the same buffer containing 2.5 mM desthiobiotin. \n\n\nExample 3. Purification of Native USP1/UAF1 Complex \n\n\n USP1 enzyme was purified with associated proteins as a native protein complex from HeLa cells. A HeLa cell line stably expressing a Flag- and HA-epitope tagged fusion protein of USP1 (e-USPl) was generated by retroviral transduction. The exogenous e-USPl protein was expressed at levels comparable to the endogenous protein and also underwent autocleavage, a feature previously reported for the USP1 protein. Huang et al. (2006) Nat Cell Biol 8:339-47; Nijman et al. (2005) Mol Cell 17:331-9. \n\n\n Nuclear extract was prepared from HeLa cells, and the native USP1 complex was purified by a two-step immunoaffinity purification scheme. Nakatani and Ogryzko (2003) Methods Enzymol 370:430-44. SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified complex demonstrated the presence of multiple polypeptides. No polypeptides were observed in a mock purification from untransduced HeLa cells, indicating that all polypeptides copurifying with e-USPl were bona fide subunits of the USP1 complex. Mass spectrometric analysis of the polypeptides identified full length USP1, the N-terminal \n\n cleavage product of USPl, and the C-terminal cleavage product of USPl. A fourth major polypeptide, with a molecular weight of 80 kDa, was identified as the previously studied p80 protein. Park et al. (2002) Immunity 17:221-33. This protein is now referred to as UAFl (USPl Associated Factor 1). UAFl contains 677 amino acids and harbors 7 or 8 potential WD40-repeats in the N-terminal half and a predicted coiled coil structure in the C-terminal half. Tertiary structure prediction using the Phyre software, available on the world wide web at sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/.about.phyre, suggests the presence of a complete propeller structure comprised by the WD40 repeats. The intensities of Coomassie blue stained USPl and UAFl proteins in the SDS-PAGE were nearly identical, suggesting stoichiometric amounts of the two proteins in the complex and a possible functional relationship. \n\n\n The protein subunits in the USPl complex were analyzed by immunoblotting, using antibodies to the USPl protein (Nijman et al. (2005) Mol Cell 17:331-9) and newly generated antibodies against the UAFl protein. The results confirmed the presence of full length USPl, N-terminal USPl, and UAFl in the USPl complex, in good correlation with the Coomassie blue stain of the complex. \n\n\n Flag-HA-tagged UAFl was expressed in HeLa cells and the protein was immunoprecipitated with associated proteins. Immunoblotting of the immunoprecipitate revealed the presence of endogenous USPl as well as its cleavage product, confirming the presence of a native USP1/UAF1 complex. The majority of USPl protein in the HeLa cells was observed to exist as a protein complex with UAFl. \n\n\nExample 4. Production of a Polyclonal Antibody to UAFl \n\n\n A polyclonal rabbit antibody was raised against a fragment of the UAFl protein consisting of amino acids 400-677. A 6xHis-UAFl (400-677) fusion protein was expressed in E. coli and purified over an NTA column. The purified protein was injected subcutaneously into a rabbit with Freund's complete adjuvant in the first injection and Freund's incomplete adjuvant for the following boost injections. Example 5. Initial In Vitro Screening to Identify Small Molecule Inhibitors of USPl Deubiquitinating Activity \n\n USP1/UAF1 protein complex serves as an excellent target for high throughput screening to identify small molecule inhibitors as radioprotective agents. A baculovirus mediated SF9 insect cell expression method has been developed for both USPl and UAF1. The expressed proteins are purified by affinity, ion exchange, and gel filtration chromatography. Briefly, a baculovirus for USPl and UAF1 was generated using the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen, CA). Full length USPl contains an autocleavage site at residue 670-671, where cleavage occurs at GG after a Ubiquitin like motif. Huang et al. (2006) Nat Cell Biol. 8: 1043-45. In order to purify the intact full length protein, two Glycine residues were mutated to Alanines using site directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). This modified full length USPl clone was PCR amplified and subcloned into pFastBac-HT vectors (Invitrogen, CA) with N-terminal His tag. USPl Associated Factor 1 (UAF1) was also cloned into pFastBac vector, but without the N- terminal His tag. The clones were PCR verified and transformed into DHlOBac cells for blue-white colony selection. Bacmid DNA from the re-confirmed colony was extracted and presence of correct USPl or UAF1 clones were confirmed by PCR amplification. The bacmid DNA were then transfected into SF9 cells using the Cellfectin reagent (Invitrogen, CA). PI virus sets were collected following manufacturer's protocol and used to amplify P2 and P3 virus respectively. SF9 cells were co-infected with USPl and UAF1 viruses to co-express these two proteins. A series of virus titer was used to optimize the expression level of USPl and UAF1. Best expression of USPl and UAF1 was observed with the virus titers of 1 μΐ in 2000 μΐ and 4000 μΐ of SF9 culture respectively. Expression level of these proteins at various time points after infection was also tested to determine optimum time of expression. Best expression was achieved at 60 hours after infection. Finally, SF9 suspension culture was infected at cell density 1.8 million/ml and grown at 28° C on orbital shaker for 60 hours. After expression, cells were harvested at 500 g for 7 minutes, washed with lxPBS, centrifuged again and stored at -80° C for purification. \n\n\n USPl and UAF1 complex was initially purified by Ni-NTA affinity purification. SF9 cells were resuspended in a pre-chilled lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol and 0.2% Triton X. After sonication, the cell lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 r.p.m. for 45 minutes at 4° C Ni-NTA resin equilibrated in the lysis buffer and added to the soluble \n\n supernatant from the whole cell lysate. 2-3 ml of resin was added to per 2 liter of SF9 culture. The resin was incubated with mixing for 1 hour at 4° C and spun down resin at 500xg for 5 min. After carefully removing the supernatant, the Ni-NTA resin was re- suspended in lysis buffer to wash out any unbound proteins. After spinning down the resin again, it was resuspended in wash buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X. After spinning down the resin again, it was washed twice with wash buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1000 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol, followed by a final wash with buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol. The bound USPl/UAFl complex was eluted slowly from the column by elution buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol. At this stage, eluted USPl/UAFl complex was further purified by ion exchange chromatography using Q-sepharose column. The purified protein complex was further purified by gel filtration using S-200 column. Final buffer to be used in gel filtration column contained 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 100 mM KC1, 5 mM DTT, and 0.1 mM EDTA. After final purification, quality of the protein was checked by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining. Finally, USPl/UAFl concentration was measured by Bradford assay (BioRad, Calif.). 11 mg of protein complex were purified from 2 liter SF9 culture at a final concentration of 0.77 mg/ml. \n\n\n In order to develop a highly sensitive assay with easy readout for high throughput detection, the fluorogenic compound Ubiquitin-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (AMC-Ub, Boston Biochem) was used as a substrate for USPl/UAFl enzyme complex. USP1 catalyzes the cleavage of AMC-Ub, releasing free AMC moiety, which leads to increase in fluorescence emission at 460 nm (λ\nεχ\n=380 nm). Dang et al. (1998) Biochemistry 37: 1868-79. Catalytic activity towards AMC-Ub increases 35 fold compared to USP1 enzyme alone. Initial enzyme assay development was performed in 96-well plates with 100 μΐ reaction volume containing 20 mM HEPES-KOH, 0.1 mg/ml ovalbumin (Sigma), 0.5 mM EDTA, and 10 mM DTT. 2.5 nM USPl/UAFl enzyme complex was mixed with the reaction buffer, incubated at 37° C for 10 minutes and then 0.3 μΜ AMC-Ub was added. Fluorescence was measured using a Fluostar Galaxy Fluorometer (BMG Labtech Inc.). \n\n Ubiquitin aldehyde (Al-Ub) is a potent covalent inhibitor of deubiquitinating enzymes, and it inhibits the enzyme by covalently attaching to the active site. There is a sharp decrease in enzyme activity upon incubation of USPl/UAFl complex with 25 nM of Al-Ub. The significant decrease in signal upon Al-Ub can easily be detected in high throughput data collection and data interpretation. Hence, Al-Ub can be used as positive control for inhibition in screening assays, including high throughput screening, and any potential inhibition signal can be compared to this control. \n\n\n Once the preliminary enzyme assay was established in 96-well format, it was optimized for 384 wells for high throughput screening (HTS) of inhibitors. The major points to be considered were the volume of the reaction and amount of AMC-Ub substrate to be used in the assay. Since the price of AMC-Ub is very high, in order to make it a feasible assay for HTS, lowest workable amount of the AMC conjugate was used. Reaction volume was minimized to 30 μΐ in order to meet the recommendation of ICCB-L screening facility (Harvard). In the preliminary optimization experiment, a series of pilot experiments were performed with varying AMC-Ub concentrations (0.025 μΜ to 0.2 μΜ), along with the varying concentration of USPl/UAFl complex (0.2 nM to 3.2 nM). This concentration grid was performed in 384-well plates (Corning, 3711) using the automated liquid handler present at ICCB-L screening facility. After incubating the enzyme and buffer at 37° C for 10 minutes, AMC-Ub was added and fluorescence emission at 460 nm (λ\nεχ\n=380 nm) was measured in an automated plate reader Envision 2 (Perkin Elmer). Fluorescence reading for all time points up to one hour was noted and the data for different AMC-Ub concentration range was plotted with each USPl/UAFl enzyme complex concentration. Comparison of fluorescence emission in each set showed the minimum optimal AMC-Ub concentration required with optimum USPl/UAFl concentration to obtain significant increase in signal compared to the baseline. Based on the results, 0.1 μΜ AMC-Ub concentration along with 1.6 nM USPl/UAFl concentration produced significantly increased signal from the baseline and these optimum concentrations were used for HTS. So by this optimization AMC-Ub concentration was reduced 3 times (0.3 μΜ to 0.1 μΜ) and volume of the reaction was reduced 3.33 times (100 μΐ to 30 μΐ). Taken together, the overall use of the substrate was reduced 10 times by doing this optimization (3x3.33). Unlike single enzyme assay, only one time point can be collected in HTS with thousands of compound screen. This \n\n optimization step also shows the desirable time point to read fluorescence signal is 15 minutes after addition of AMC-Ub, as this is before the reaction reaches the saturation. \n\n\n After large scale expression-purification of USP1/UAF1 protein complex, high throughput screening was performed. Buffers and USP1/UAF1 complex were added into 384-well plates (Corning, black 3711) using automated liquid handling robot Bio- Tek Microfill (Bio-Tek Instruments Inc., VT). This was followed by addition of compounds to the plate wells using pin transfer robotic system. This includes a custom designed Seiko Cartesian robot with pin arrays (V & P Scientific Inc.) and Zymark Twister II robotic arm to stack and transfer compound plates and assay plates. In this step, 100 μΕ of the compounds (in DMSO) from compound library plates was added to the 384-well assay plates. After incubating the assay plates at 37° C for 10 minutes, desired volume of AMC-Ub was added by the automated liquid handler. Finally, fluorescence emission at 460 nm\n\n\n nm) was measured in an automated plate reader Envision 2 (Perkin Elmer, Mass.). The Z' factor for the assay was calculated (Zhang et al. (1999) / Biomol Screen 4:67-73) and, if required, the assay was further optimized until Z>0.5. \n\n\n The HTS assay was run using the ICCB-L Biomol bioactive library (Harvard Medical School, Boston, Mass.). ICCB-L has a collection of over 150,000 compounds in their compound library, which consists of known bioactive libraries, natural product libraries, and commercial libraries such as ChemDiv, ChemBridge, etc. Known bioactive libraries containing Biomol ICCB known bioactives, NINDS, and Prestwick collections were tested first for potential inhibitors. This set of the library contains many FDA-approved drugs and the compounds are known to exhibit low toxicity and high cellular retention, making them excellent targets for further cell-based assay. The reactions were performed using automated instruments as described above. Among two bioactive libraries tested, three compounds, β-lapachone, Biomol AP401 (propidium iodide), and RK-682, were previously shown to have substantial low fluorescence signal in the range of Al-Ub-treated positive control sets. US 2008/0167229 Al. Identification of these compounds by high throughput screening established the validity of the experimental setup. \n\n Results. Four additional small molecule inhibitors of USPl deubiquitinating activity were identified from a screen of approximately 150,000 compounds. The compounds so identified included the following: \n\n\nFormula III (933), \n\n\n \n\n Formula IV (527), \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 6. Additional In Vitro Screening to Characterize Small Molecule Inhibitors of\n\n\nUSPl Identified in Initial Screening \n\n\n Hits from the initial screening were analyzed further in secondary screening. In this step, the compounds were re-tested for inhibition using the AMC-Ub in vitro enzyme assay. After reconfirming inhibition, different concentration range of the inhibitors were tested to show dose dependency of inhibition and IC50 calculation. \n\n\n In one set of experiments, HeLa cells were incubated in the presence of 50 μΜ of selected inhibitors including the compound of Formula III (933) and the compound of Formula IV (527) for 2, 4, or 6 hours, followed by cell lysis. Ub-aldehyde (Ub-Ald, a known USPl inhibitor) was used as a positive control, and dimethysulf oxide (DMSO) was used as a negative control. Lysates were incubated with the Ub-vinyl sulfone (Ub- \n\n Vs) reagent for 40 minutes. Proteins were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with the anti-USPl antibody. Results are shown in Fig. 2. \n\n\n Results. Ub-aldehyde blocked Ub-Vs conjugation of USP1 (lane 4), whereas DMSO alone did not block conjugation of USP1 (lane 3). Of five putative USP1 inhibitors evaluated (lanes 5-9), the C527 compound was a potent inhibitor of deubiquitinase activity. \n\n\n IC50 values for compounds of Formulas III- VI, determined following 4 hour preincubation, are shown in Table 1. \n\n\nTable 1. \n\n\n Compound IC50 (nM) \n\n\n a \n\n\n Formula III (933) \n\n\n Formula IV (527) 134 \n\n\n Formula V (947) 7,500 \n\n\n Formula VI (009) 2,400 \n\n\n a No data Example 7. Cell-Based Screening to Further Characterize Small Molecule Inhibitors of USP1 Identified in In Vitro Screening \n\n\n Candidate USP1 inhibitors from initial and secondary screens were then used in cell-based assays to look for USP1 inhibition in vivo using levels of FANCD2-Ub and PCNA-Ub as biomarkers for inhibition. For the cell-based assay, cells were treated with the candidate compounds and levels of monoubiquitinated FANCD2 and PCNA were tested both with and without DNA damage. USP1 inhibition was detected as high level of endogenous monoubiquitinated FANCD2 and PCNA. For this assay HeLa and HEK293T cells were treated with selected concentrations of these compounds and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum in a humidified 5% CO\n2\n incubator at 37° C. Damage was induced by both UV irradiation using Stratalinker (Stratagene) and treatment with mitomycin C (MMC, Sigma). After cell lysis, levels of monoubiquitinated FANCD2 and PCNA in whole cell lysate was tested by immunoblotting with anti-FANCD2 antibody (sc-20022; Santa Cruz \n\n Biotechnology) and anti-PCNA antibody (sc-56; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Protection from chromosome aberrations were also tested in UV/MMC-damaged cells treated with candidate USP1 inhibitors using standard chromosome breakage assay. Yang et al. (2001) Blood 98:3435-40. Representative results are shown in Fig. 3. \n\n\n Results. HeLa cells were incubated with the compound of Formula IV (527) for eight hours, followed by cell lysis and incubation of protein extract with Ub- vinyl sulfone. Increasing concentrations of the compound of Formula IV (527) resulted in a dose-dependent blockade of USP1 deubiquitinase activity (lanes 3, 4, 5). Increasing concentrations of the compound of Formula IV (527) also resulted in a dose-dependent increase in FANCD2-Ub levels and FANCI-Ub levels (lanes 7, 8, 9). \n\n\nExample 8. USP1/UAF1 Inhibitor Sensitizes HeLa cells to the DNA Crosslinking Agent Mitomycin C \n\n\n HeLa cells were pretreated for six hours with selected concentrations (0, 200, or 500 nM) of mitomycin C (MMC), washed, then exposed to selected concentrations (0, 10, or 20 μΜ) of the compound of Formula IV (527) for eight hours. Cell survival was measured by redox dye. Results are shown in Fig. 4. \n\n\n Results. Pretreatment with the compound of Formula IV (20 micromolar) resulted in sensitization of the HeLa cells to the cytotoxic effects of MMC. \n\n\nExample 9. C 527 inhibits USP1/UAF1 in a time-course and dose-dependent manner\n\n\nThe ability of C527, the compound of Formula IV (527) to inhibit USP1/UAF1 in a time-course and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5) was confirmed using ubiquitin- AMC (Ub-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin), another ubiquitin derivative similar to Ub-Rhodamine (Ub-Rho) but having a different emission wavelength, as substrate. Pretreatment of USP1/UAF1 with a single dose of C527 (1 uM) for variable time periods resulted in a serial increase in inhibition of DUB activity (i.e., fluorescence) (Fig. 5A). Treatment for 2 h with an increase in dose of C527, ranging from 0.5 to 2 μΜ, resulted in a dose- dependent decrease in DUB activity (Fig. 5B). Based on these results, the IC50 of C527 for the USP1/UAF1 complex was 0.88 + 0.03 μΜ (Fig. 5C). \n\n\nExample 10. C527 is a pan-deubiquitinating enzyme inhibitor in vitro \n\n To examine the specificity of C527 in USP1/UAF1 inhibition, its ability to inhibit other DUB enzymes in vitro was examined. It has been recently showed that UAF1 stimulates not only USP1, but also two other DUB enzymes, USP12 and USP46 (Cohn MA, Kee Y, Haas W, Gygi SP, D'Andrea AD. UAF1 is a subunit of multiple \n\n\ndeubiquitinating enzyme complexes. J Biol Chem. 2009;284:5343-5351). Moreover, the active complex of USP12 contains an additional WD40 subunit (WDR20). C527 also inhibited the DUB activity of the USP12/UAF1/WDR20 complex, as well as the USP5 enzyme in vitro (Fig. 6A and 6B). However, the IC50 of C527 for these DUB enzymes was slightly higher (Fig. 6D). UCH-Ll and UCH-L3 are members of a different subclass of deubiquitinating enzymes, referred to as the ubiquitin-carboxy terminal hydrolases (Mermerian AH, Case A, Stein RL, Cuny GD. Structure-activity relationship, kinetic mechanism, and selectivity for a new class of ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-Ll (UCH- Ll) inhibitors. Bioorg Med Chem Lett. 2007;17:3729-3732). Interestingly, C527 had considerably less inhibitory effect on these deubiquitinating enzymes, even though they are also cysteine proteases. Taken together, C527 is a pan-deubiquitinating enzyme inhibitor in vitro, though it has some specificity for the USP subfamily of DUBs, compared to the UCH subfamily. \n\n\n The ability of C527 to inhibit the deubiquitinating activity of native USP1 complexes derived from human cells was determined next (Fig. 7). For this purpose, the HA-tagged ubiquitin- VS, an affinity reagent known to covalently modify and trap active DUB enzymes in cell extracts was used. Cell extracts prepared from HeLa cells were pretreated with increasing concentrations of C527 for 4 h, followed by the incubation with Ub-VS for 40 min at 30 °C. The enzymatic activity of endogenous DUBs was indicated by the conjugation of Ub-VS, detected as HA-labeling (see Fig. 7, high molecular weight bands). Solvent vehicle treated cell extracts showed increased enzymatic activity of endogenous DUBs, as indicated by a whole panel of HA-labeling at different molecular weight. Ub-VS conjugation was inhibited by ubiquitin- aldehyde (Ub-Ald), a non-specific inhibitor of DUBs (lane 3). In contrast, C527 failed to inhibit the Ub-VS labeling of other endogenous DUB enzyme complexes but did inhibit USP1 binding to Ub-VS in the same reaction in a dose-dependent manner. These data indicate that C527 has a preferential inhibition of the native USP1, compared to other native DUBs in the extract. \n\n Example 11. C527 impairs homologous recombination repair \n\n\n Recent studies have indicated that the Fanconi Anemia pathway is required for optimal homologous recombination (HR) repair (Nakanishi K, Yang YG, Pierce AJ, et al. Human Fanconi anemia monoubiquitination pathway promotes homologous DNA repair. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2005;102: 1110-1115). Disruption of FANCD2 monoubiquitination or of USP1 activity (Oestergaard VH, Langevin F, Kuiken HJ, et al. Deubiquitination of FANCD2 is required for DNA crosslink repair. Mol Cell. \n\n\n2007;28:798-809; Kim JM, Parmar K, Huang M, et al. Inactivation of murine Uspl results in genomic instability and a Fanconi anemia phenotype. Dev Cell. 2009;16:314- 320) results in decreased HR. A gene conversion assay was used to examine the effect of C527 on cellular HR activity (Fig. 8A). Interestingly, C527 caused a dose-dependent decreased in gene conversion, based on the measurement of cellular GFP in this assay, and inhibition occurred in the 0 to 5 μΜ range (Fig. 8A). In contrast, C527 did not inhibit non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) activity under the same condition (Fig. 8B). \n\n\n To confirm that the C527 treatment caused HR defect, RAD51 foci formation, another surrogate marker of cellular HR activity, was tested (Fig. 8C). Camptothecin activated the assembly of RAD51 and H2AX foci. C527 treatment inhibited RAD51 foci formation but had a non-detectable effect on H2AX foci formation. Taken together, these results further indicate that C527 has HR-inhibitory activity. \n\n\nExample 12. C527 causes DNA damage and inhibits the proliferation of tumor cells\n\n\nImpaired HR integrity may lead to genotoxic effect. Genotoxic agents are known to directly activate DNA damage response pathways, resulting in FANCD2 \n\n\nmonoubiquitination and CHK1 phosphorylation (Fig. 9A). The results indicate that C527, like the genotoxic crosslinking agent MMC, can activate markers of the DNA damage response. Accordingly, C527 treatment inhibited cell proliferation as assessed using clonogenic assay (Fig. 9B). \n\n\nExample 13. C527 sensitizes tumor cells to DNA damaging agents \n\n\n Inhibitors of the FA-BRCA pathway are known to sensitize tumor cells to the cytotoxic effects of ICL- indicating agents. Specifically, it is known that proteasome \n\n inhibitors block FANCD2 monoubiquitination, perhaps through depletion of intracellular pools of free ubiquitin, resulting in inhibition of HR repair (Chirnomas D, Taniguchi T, de la Vega M, et al. Chemosensitization to cisplatin by inhibitors of the Fanconi anemia/BRCA pathway. Mol Cancer Ther. 2006;5:952-961). The ability of C527 to sensitize pretreated human cells to MMC or to other agents was tested. C527 sensitized cells to MMC and to CPT, consistent with its ability to specifically inhibit HR in cells (Fig.10). \n\n\n DNA Repair inhibitors have recently emerged as a novel class of anti-cancer agents. Conventional anticancer agents, such as the alkylating agents busulfan and cyclophosphamide, kill cancer cells by causing DNA damage. Tumors can become resistant to conventional therapy by amplifying DNA repair pathways. DNA repair inhibitors, such as the newly developed PARP inhibitors, block DNA repair and sensitize tumor cells to conventional agnets. \n\n\n There are several DNA repair pathways in human cells, and each pathway deals with a specific set of DNA lesions. The Fanconi Anemia (FA-BRCA) pathway, regulates homologous recombination repair and is require for interstrand DNA crosslink repair. A DNA repair inhibitor for this pathway is expected to sensitize tumor cells to crosslinking agents, such as cisplatin and mitomycin C. \n\n\n Several enzymatic steps comprise the FA-BRCA pathway, and each step is a potential target for inhibitor development. Critical catalytic events in the FA-BRCA pathway include 1) the E3 ligase dependent monoubiquitination of FANCD2 and 2) the USP1 -dependent deubiquitination of FANCD2-Ub. Disruption of either enzymatic step results in cisplatin sensitization. \n\n\n Recent studies have identified small molecule inhibitors of FANCD2 \n\n\nmonoubiquitination, and these compounds are currently in preclinical development (curcumin and proteasome inhibitor). Small molecule inhibitors of the FA-BRCA pathway can block HR repair and sensitize tumors to DNA crosslinking agents such as cisplatin. The results described herein demonstrate that C527 can inhibit USP1/UAF1 in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. Cells exposed to C527 exhibited reduced USP1 activity, increased monoubiquitinated FANCD2 levels, and a defect in homologous recombination repair. C527 also enhanced the cellular sensitivity of cancer cells to mitomycin C and camptothecin but not to etoposide treatment. The identification of this \n\n lead inhibitor against the USP1/UAF1 complex provides a structural basis for further development of new anticancer drugs. \n\n\nExample 14. In vivo activtity ofC527 \n\n\n Bortezomib (Velcade) has been shown to inhibit the FA-BRCA pathway. \n\n\n Preliminary breast cancer xenograft studies with one HR pathway-proficient breast tumor line have been conducted. Bortezomib inhibited the FA/BRCA pathway and the combination of Velcade plus PARP inhibitor (ABT-888) resulted in enhanced killing of this cell line in vivo, compared to either agent alone (data not shown) \n\n\n Nude mice bearing MDA-MB-231 tumor xenografts are treated with either vehicle control, ABT-888 (25mg/kg B.W), cisplatin, C527 or combination of ABT-888 or cysplatin and C527. It is anticipated that C527 will have homologous recombination (HR) -inhibiting activity in vivo, and will synergize with PARP inhibitor and/or Cisplatin in vivo. \n\n\nThe foregoing written specification is considered to be sufficient to enable one skilled in the art to practice the invention.
