Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to a process for producing an antithrombin III composition comprising an antithrombin III molecule having complex type N-glycoside-linked sugar chains, wherein the complex type N-glycoside-linked sugar chains have a structure in which fucose is not bound to N-acetylglucosamine in the reducing end in the sugar chains.\n\n\n \n\n\nBACKGROUND ART\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThrombus formation accompanies a danger of stopping blood flow. Since cutoff of blood flow by the formation of thrombi becomes a lethal factor, the living body has several mechanisms to control and regulate blood coagulation. That is, direct inactivation of activated coagulation factors by serine protease [\nThe Thrombin; Volume I (Machovich R., ed.), pp. 1-21, CRC Press, Boca Raton (1982\n.)], a regulatory mechanism based on the degradation of factor V and factor VIII by activated protein C [\nProgress in Hemostasis and Thrombosis, Volume 7 (Spaet T. H., ed.), pp. 25-54, Grune & Stratton, New York (1984\n)] and an inhibitory mechanism of activated coagulation factors by various serine protease inhibitors in blood. In addition, the presence of a tissue factor inhibitor which inhibits activation of factor VII in an activated factor X-dependent manner [\nJournal of Japanese Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis, 2, 550. (1991\n)] has also been found. The most important mechanism among these is the inhibitory mechanism of activated coagulation factors by various serine protease inhibitors in blood.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious serine protease inhibitors are present in blood, and their amount reaches 10% of the total plasma protein. It is known that 4 inhibitors among these inhibitors, namely antithrombin III, at proteinase inhibitor, α2 macroglobulin and heparin cofactor II, are important in regulating blood coagulation. Among such inhibitors, antithrombin III is particularly important and occupies 70% of the antithrombin activity in plasma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntithrombin III is a glycoprotein comprising 432 amino acids and having a molecular weight of approximately 59,000 to 65,000, and has three disulfide bonds, Cys8-Cys128, Cys21-Cys95 and Cys247-Cys430, in its molecule [\nProc. Natl. Acad Sci, USA, 80, 1845 (1983\n)]. By these bonds, a large loop structure is formed on the C-terminal, and an Arg393-Ser394 bond is present as the active center in this loop structure (\nFig. 1\n). Human antithrombin III has an isoelectric point of 5.11. N-Glycoside-linked sugar chains are added to 4 positions, the 96th, 135th, 155th and 192nd asparagine residues counting from the N-terminus (hereinafter referred to as Asn96, Asn135, Asn155 and Asn192, respectively) of antithrombin III. The antithrombin III in human plasma exists in two kinds of isoforms, an α type having four N-glycoside-linked sugar chains and a β type having only three N-glycoside-linked sugar chains but not having a sugar chain to the Asn135 [\nPathophysiol. Haemost. Thromb., 32, 143 (2002\n)], and in the antithrombin III in human plasma, 90 to 95% is the α type and the remaining 5 to 10% is the β type.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe complex type N-glycoside-linked sugar chains added to antithrombin III are constituted by N-acetylglucosamine, sialic acid, galactose and mannose (\nFig. 2\n). One of the characteristics of the Antithrombin III distributing in human plasma is that its sugar chain structure is free from the fucose modification.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntithrombin III has been developed as a blood coagulation inhibitor and is broadly used in the world for the treatment of thrombosis based on congenital antithrombin III deficiency and multiple intravascular blood coagulation syndrome which accompanies reduction of antithrombin III.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBlood preparations such as antithrombin III are produced by using pooled human plasma samples as the raw material. In Japan, the pooled plasma is prepared at Plasma Fractionation Center, Japanese Red Cross Society, by mixing plasma samples of approximately 5,000 to 10,000 volunteers after completion of the 6 months of storage, and provided. In reality, in order to produce one lot of a blood preparation such as a dry concentrated human blood coagulation factor VIII preparation, Cross Eight M (Japanese Red Cross Society), several batches of cryoprecipitates obtained from the above-described pooled plasmas are necessary, and plasma samples of approximately 80,000 volunteers are used \n[\n \nJapanese Journal of Transfusion Medicine, 48, 27 (2002\n)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pooled plasma is produced by using blood samples provided by blood donors as the raw material, and it has been reported that the human parvovirus B19-positive ratio in blood donors in Japan is estimated to be 0.6 to 0.8% [\nJournal of Japan Society of Blood Transfusion, 42, 231 (1996\n)]. Thus, it is calculated that one lot equivalent to the above-described Cross Eight M is contaminated with human parvovirus B19-positive blood samples corresponding to roughly 480 to 640 donors. The human parvovirus B 19 is a small virus of 18 to 26 nm in diameter without envelope, and keeps its resistance even after carrying out heat treatment at 60°C for 30 minutes, acid treatment at approximately \npH\n 3, chloroform treatment, surfactant treatment and the like [\nScience, 262, 114 (1993\n)], so that it cannot be eliminated by general virus elimination methods. Accordingly, elimination of human parvovirus B19 requires a step for filtration through an exclusively developed virus eliminating membrane having a pore size of several nanometers to several ten nanometers. However, it is considered that a filtration step which uses such a small membrane pore size, namely a nanofiltration step, is difficult to be introduced into the production process of many plasma fractionation preparations [\nJapanese Journal of Transfusion Medicine, 48, 27 (2002\n)]. It is considered that human parvovirus B19 is the cause of erythema infectiosum, and generally shows only transient cold-like symptoms in the case of healthy persons without anti-B 19 antibody, but causes chronic hemolytic anemia in some cases. Also, it is said that it sometimes induces serious acute pure red cell aplasia in immunodeficiency patients. In addition, there is a report stating that pregnant women having no anti-B19 antibody sometimes result in miscarriage or the unborn babies cause edema, and 15% of the intrauterine fetal death was positive regarding the result of DNA inspection of B19 [\nLancet, 357, 1494 (2001\n)]. In the dry concentrated human blood coagulation factor VIII preparation, Cross Eight M (Japanese Red Cross Society), a case in which a transient infection with human parvovirus B19 by the administration of this preparation was suspected was reported in September, 1997 [\nJournal of Japanese Society of Child Hematology, 11, 289 (1997\n)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA hepatitis B virus-negative, hepatitis C virus-negative and Human immunodeficiency virus I and II-negative pooled plasma is used as the production material of antithrombin III blood preparations such as Neuart (manufactured by Mitsubishi Pharma Corporation) and Anthrobin P (manufactured by Aventis Boehring), but the presence or absence of human parvovirus B19 in the raw material has not been confirmed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough a virus inactivation treatment at 60°C for 10 hours, namely pasteurization, is carried out in the production process of antithrombin III blood preparations, there are problems such that the antithrombin III which is a protein is denatured, and AIDS virus, human parvovirus and prion which becomes the cause of mutation type Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease cannot be completely removed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs described in the above, the use of blood preparations has disadvantages in that there is a risk of viral infection, and the risk cannot completely be excluded by the current techniques. Thus, an antithrombin III preparation with improved safety is in demand.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, in order to provide human antithrombin III without using human plasma as the raw material, its replacement with a recombinant has been considered. However, the activity of the recombinant antithrombin III prepared by using gene recombination techniques is inferior to the activity of antithrombin III obtained from a natural material such as plasma. This is because it is considered that the sugar chain structure to be added to the recombinant is different from that of antithrombin III prepared from plasma, and specifically, it is assumed that since fucose is bound to the complex type N-glycoside-linked sugar chains to be added to the recombinant antithrombin III, its Affinity with heparin becomes low, and therefore sufficient anti-blood coagulation activity cannot be obtained [\nJournal of Biological Chemistry, 268, 17588 (1993\n), \nBiochemistry, 35, 8881 (1996\n)]. To date, there are reports on recombinant antithrombin III produced by a baby hamster kidney-derived BHK cell [\nJournal of Biological Chemistry, 268, 17588 (1993\n), \nBiochemistry, 15, 8881 (1996\n)], a Chinese hamster ovary-derived CHO cell (\n \nWO02/02793\n \n) or a transgenic goat (\n \nUS 2003096974\n \n), but fucose is bound to N-acetylglucosamine in the reducing end in the complex type N-glycoside-linked sugar chains binding to the recombinant antithrombin III in each of these cases. The ratio of the complex type N-glycoside-linked sugar chains to which fucose is bound to the total complex type N-glycoside-linked sugar chains in the produced recombinant antithrombin III varies depending on the host cell, but is estimated to be from 39 to 95%. Attempts have been made to reduce the ratio of the sugar chain in which fucose is bound to the complex type N-glycoside-linked sugar chains by various devices such as improvement of the culturing method, but it has not been succeeded yet in producing a recombinant antithrombin III having a sugar chain structure equivalent to that of the natural antithrombin III.\n\n\n \n\n\nDISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to the following (1) to (17).\n\n \n \n \n[1].

The methods for selecting the mutant using, as a marker, the sugar chain structure of a produced glycoprotein molecule include the methods described in 4 and 5 below.\n\n\n \n(2) Technique of introducing a dominant-negative mutant of a gene encoding an enzyme\n\n\n \n \n \nThe host cell used for the production of the antithrombin III composition can be prepared by using the method of introducing a dominant-negative mutant of a target gene, i.e., a gene encoding an enzyme relating to the fucose modification. Examples of the enzymes relating to the synthesis of the intracellular sugar nucleotide GDP-fucose include GMD and Fx. Examples of the enzymes relating to the modification of a sugar chain in which 1-position of fucose is bound to 6-position of N-acetylglucosamine in the reducing end through α-bond in a complex type N-glycoside-linked sugar chain include α1,6-fucosyltransferase and α-L-fucosidase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese enzymes have substrate specificity and catalyze specific reactions. By disrupting the active center of such enzymes having substrate specificity and catalytic action, their dominant-negative mutants can be prepared. Preparation of a dominant-negative mutant is described in detail below, using for an example GMD among the target enzymes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a result of the analysis of the tertiary structure of GMD derived from \nEscherichia coli,\n it has been revealed that four amino acids (threonine at position 133, glutamic acid at \nposition\n 135, tyrosine at position 157 and lysine at position 161) have an important function for the enzyme activity \n(\n \nStructure, 8, 2, 2000\n). That is, the mutants prepared by substituting the above four amino acids with other amino acids based on the tertiary structure information all showed significantly decreased enzyme activity. On the other hand, little change was observed in the ability of the mutants to bind to the GMD coenzyme NADP or the substrate GDP-mannose. Accordingly, a dominant-negative mutant can be prepared by substituting the four amino acids which are responsible for the enzyme activity of GMD. On the basis of the result of preparation of a dominant-negative mutant of GMD derived from \nEscherichia coli,\n dominant-negative mutants of other GMDs can be prepared by performing homology comparison and tertiary structure prediction using the amino acid sequence information. For example, in the case of GMD derived from CHO cell (SEQ ID NO:8), a dominant-negative mutant can be prepared by substituting threonine at \nposition\n 155, glutamic acid at position 157, tyrosine at position 179 and lysine at position 183 with other amino acids.

Specific examples are described below.\n\n\n \n(1) Antithrombin activity measuring method\n\n\n \n \n \nA purified antithrombin III composition and a substance to be tested such as defibrinated plasma are serially diluted using 0.05 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.3, containing 0.15 M NaCl and 0.2% human serum albumin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo 100 µl of each of the diluted samples, 500 µl of 7.5 U/ml thrombin solution is added, and the reaction is carried out at 37°C for 10 minutes. Then, 2 ml of a substrate solution prepared by diluting the thrombin-specific coloring substrate (HD-CHA-But-Arg-pNA) attached to Berichrome Antithrombin III (manufactured by Boehring Berge) to 0.25 M with a diluent is added thereto, and the reaction is carried out at 37°C for 5 minutes. Thereafter, the reaction is stopped by adding 0.5 ml of 50% acetic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy measuring absorbance in the reaction solution at 405 nm, a value is obtained by subtracting the absorbance of a reaction solution to which the substance to be tested at each dilution step was added from the absorbance of a control reaction solution to which antithrombin III as the substance to be tested was not added. This value as the amount of inactivated thrombin is plotted as ordinate, and dilution ratio of the substance to be tested as abscissa, on a semi-log graph paper. By linearly approximating relationship between the amount of inactivated thrombin and dilution ratio of the substance to be tested from the plotted measured values and comparing it with an approximate expression obtained as a result of the measurement of the purified antithrombin III composition and defibrinated plasma, the ratio of the purified antithrombin III composition to the defibrinated plasma can be calculated and its titer can be determined.\n\n\n \n(2) Heparin cofactor activity measuring method\n\n\n \n \n \nA purified antithrombin III composition and a substance to be tested such as defibrinated plasma are serially diluted using 0.05 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.3, containing 0.15 M NaCl and 0.2% human serum albumin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo 50 µl of each of the diluted samples, 1.0 ml of 0.3 unit thrombin solution containing 2.5 U/ml heparin is added, and the reaction is carried out at 37°C for 5 minutes. Next, 100 µl of the substrate solution described in the above-described 3(1) adjusted to 2.0 mM is added thereto, and the reaction is carried out at 37°C for 2 minutes. Thereafter, the reaction is stopped by adding 0.5 ml of 50% acetic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter completion of the reaction, absorbance in the reaction mixture is measured at 405 nm, and then titer of the purified antithrombin III composition upon defibrinated plasma can be determined by the same method described in the above-described 3(1).\n\n\n \n \n(3) In vivo\n test using DIC morbid state model animal\n\n\n \n \n \nAnti-blood coagulation activity of the purified antithrombin III composition \nin vivo\n can be examined using a rabbit acute DIC morbid state model [\nClinic and Research (Rinsyo to Kenkyu), 62, 3573 (1985\n)], a rat acute DIC morbid state model \n[\n \nClinic and Research (Rinsyo to Kenkyu), 62, 3688 (1985\n)], a pregnant rabbit acute DIC morbid state model \n[\n \nParmacometrics, 30, 589 (1985\n)] or the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, safety and therapeutic effect of the antithrombin III composition in human can also be evaluated using an animal species model relatively close to human, such as \nMacaca fascicularis.\n \n\n\n \n4. Analysis of sugar chains in the antithrombin III composition\n\n\n \n \n \nThe sugar chain structure of an antithrombin III molecule expressed in various cells can be analyzed according to general methods of analysis of the sugar chain structure of glycoproteins. For example, a sugar chain bound to an antithrombin III molecule consists of neutral sugars such as galactose, mannose and fucose, amino sugars such as N-acetylglucosamine, and acidic sugars such as sialic acid, and can be analyzed by techniques such as sugar composition analysis and sugar chain structure analysis using two-dimensional sugar chain mapping.\n\n\n \n(1) Analysis of neutral and amino sugar compositions\n\n\n \n \n \nThe sugar chain composition of an antithrombin III molecule can be analyzed by carrying out acid hydrolysis of sugar chains with trifluoroacetic acid or the like to release neutral sugars or amino sugars and analyzing the composition ratio.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecifically, the analysis can be carried out by a method using a carbohydrate analysis system (BioLC; product of Dionex). BioLC is a system for analyzing the sugar composition by HPAEC-PAD (high performance anion-exchange chromatography-pulsed amperometric detection) [\nJ. Lig. Chromatogr., 6, 1577 (1983\n)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe composition ratio can also be analyzed by the fluorescence labeling method using 2-aminopyridine. Specifically, the composition ratio can be calculated by fluorescence labeling an acid-hydrolyzed sample by 2-aminopyridylation according to a known method \n[\n \nAgric. Biol. Chem., 55(1), 283-284 (1991\n)] and then analyzing the composition by HPLC.\n\n\n \n(2) Analysis of sugar chain structure\n\n\n \n \n \nThe sugar chain structure of an antithrombin III molecule can be analyzed by two-dimensional sugar chain mapping \n[\n \nAnal. Biochem., 171, 73 (1988\n); \nSeibutsukagaku Jikkenho (Biochemical Experimentation Methods) 23 - Totanpakushitsu Tosa Kenkyuho (Methods of Studies on Glycoprotein Sugar Chains), Gakkai Shuppan Center, edited by Reiko Takahashi (1989\n)]. The two-dimensional sugar chain mapping is a method of deducing a sugar chain structure, for example, by plotting the retention time or elution position of a sugar chain by reversed phase chromatography as the X axis and the retention time or elution position of the sugar chain by normal phase chromatography as the Y axis, and comparing them with the results on known sugar chains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecifically, a sugar chain is released from an antithrombin III molecule by hydrazinolysis of the antithrombin III composition and subjected to fluorescence labeling with 2-aminopyridine (hereinafter referred to as PA) [\nJ. Biochem., 95, 197 (1984\n)]. After being separate from an excess PA-treating reagent by gel filtration, the sugar chain is subjected to reversed phase chromatography. Then, each peak of the sugar chain is subjected to normal phase chromatography. The sugar chain structure can be deduced by plotting the obtained results on a two-dimensional sugar chain map and comparing them with the spots of a sugar chain standard (manufactured by Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.) or those in the literature \n[\n \nAnal. Biochem., 171, 73 (1988\n)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe structure deduced by the two-dimensional sugar chain mapping can be confirmed by carrying out mass spectrometry, e.g., MALDI-TOF-MS, of each sugar chain.\n\n\n \n5. Immunoassay for determining the sugar chain structure of an antithrombin III molecule\n\n\n \n \n \nAn antithrombin III composition consists of antithrombin III molecules which are different in sugar chain structure. The recombinant antithrombin III composition of the present invention, in which the ratio of sugar chains having a structure wherein fucose is bound to the N-acetylglucosamine in the reducing end to all the complex type N-glycoside-linked sugar chains bound to the Fc region is 0%, has a high ADCC activity. Such an antithrombin III composition can be identified using the method for analyzing the sugar chain structure of an antithrombin III molecule described in the above 4. Further, it can also be identified by immunoassays using lectins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiscrimination of the sugar chain structure of an antithrombin III molecule by immunoassays using lectins can be made according to the immunoassays such as Western staining, RIA (radioimmunoassay), VIA (viroimmunoassay), EIA (enzymoimmunoassay), FIA (fluoroimmunoassay) and MIA (metalloimmunoassay) described in the literature [\nMonoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Applications, Wiley-Liss, Inc. (1995\n); \nEnzyme Immunoassay, 3rd Ed., Igaku Shoin (1987\n); \nEnzyme Antibody Technique, Revised Edition, Crakusai Kikaku (1985\n); \netc\n.], for example, in the following manner.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA lectin recognizing the sugar chain structure of an antithrombin III molecule is labeled, and the labeled lectin is subjected to reaction with a sample antithrombin III composition, followed by measurement of the amount of a complex of the labeled lectin with the antithrombin III molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of lectins useful for determining the sugar chain structure of an antithrombin III molecule include WGA (wheat-germ agglutinin derived from \nT\n. \nvulgaris),\n ConA (concanavalin A derived from \nC\n. \nensiformis\n), RIC (a toxin derived from \nR. communis\n), L-PHA (leukoagglutinin derived from \nP. vulgaris),\n LCA (lentil agglutinin derived from \nL. culinaris),\n PSA (pea lectin derived from \nP. sativum),\n AAL \n(Aleuria aurantia\n lectin), ACL \n(Amaranthus caudatus\n lectin), BPL \n(Bauhinia purpurea\n lectin), DSL \n(Datura stramonium\n lectin), DBA \n(Dolichos biflorus\n agglutinin), EBL (elderberry balk lectin), ECL \n(Erythrina cristagalli\n lectin), EEL \n(Euonymus europaeus\n lectin), GNL \n(Galanthus nivalis\n lectin), GSL \n(Griffonia simplicifolia\n lectin), HPA\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n(Helix pomatia\n agglutinin), HHL \n(Hippeastrum\n hybrid lectin), Jacalin, LTL \n(Lotus tetragonolobus\n lectin), LEL \n(Lycopersicon esculentum\n lectin), MAL \n(Maackia amurensis\n lectin), MPL \n(Maclura pomifera\n lectin), NPL \n(Narcissus pseudonarcissus\n lectin), PNA (peanut agglutinin), E-PHA \n(Phaseolus vulgaris\n erythroagglutinin), PTL \n(Psophocarpus tetragonolobus\n lectin), RCA \n(Ricinus communis\n agglutinin), STL \n(Solanum tuberosum\n lectin), SJA \n(Sophora japonica\n agglutinin), SBA (soybean agglutinin), UEA \n(Ulex europaeus\n agglutinin), VVL \n(Vicia villosa\n lectin) and WFA \n(Wisteria floribunda\n agglutinin).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is preferred to use lectins specifically recognizing a sugar chain structure wherein fucose is bound to the N-acetylglucosamine in the reducing end in a complex type N-glycoside-linked sugar chain. Examples of such lectins include lentil lectin LCA (lentil agglutinin derived from \nLens culinaris),\n pea lectin PSA (pea lectin derived from \nPisum sativum),\n broad bean lectin VFA (agglutinin derived from \nVicia faba)\n and \nAleuria aurantia\n lectin AAL (lectin derived from \nAleuria aurantia).\n \n\n\n \n6. Utilization of the antithrombin III composition\n\n\n \n \n \nSince the antithrombin III composition obtained in the present invention has high heparin binding activity equivalent to that of the natural origin antithrombin III, it is useful in preventing and treating diseases which accompany blood coagulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is known that platelets are adhered and coagulated in a region where blood coagulation is formed, such as a vascular endothelial tissue, to form thrombi in diseases which accompany blood coagulation. Thrombus is formed by various causes such as wound, arteriosclerosis and vascular inflammation, and embolus is generated when the thrombi are released and transferred by blood flow to clog other blood vessels. When an artery is obstructed by thrombi or emboli, the perfusion region downstream of the obstructed area becomes an ischemic state. Such various morbid states caused by thrombi are called thrombosis. Accordingly, the antithrombin III composition of the present invention is useful also in preventing and treating thrombosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of the thrombosis include cerebral infarction (cerebrovascular accidents), myocardial infarction, appendicular arterial thromboembolism, deep venous thrombosis (thrombophlebitis), DIC, antithrombin III defective disease, gestational toxicosis and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCerebral infarction (cerebrovascular accidents) is a disease which accompanies obstruction of blood vessels induced by atherosclerosis lesions formed in the main cerebral arteries inside and outside of the skull. Since cerebral blood vessels are rapidly obstructed by thrombi, difficulty of moving such as hemiplegia and neurotic symptoms such as sensory disturbance of one side, disturbance of visual field, aphasia and dysarthria appear relatively quickly. Kinds of the cerebral infarction include lacuna cerebral infarction which is thrombosis of a relatively small cerebral artery generated by obstruction of arteriole branched from the main cerebral artery, and cardiogenic cerebral infarction which occurs due to obstruction of cerebral blood vessel by released thrombi once formed in the heart caused by heart diseases including myocardial infarction, valvular disease of heart such as mitral stenosis, articular fibrillation and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMyocardial infarction is a result of the necrosis of myocardial cells caused by a blood flow disorder in a cardiac muscle of perfusion region due to obstruction of coronary artery. Although there are patients having anginal symptom such as chest pain and thoracic compression pain before onset of the disease, it suddenly onsets without prodromal symptom in most cases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of the appendicular arterial thromboembolism include arteriosclerosis obliterans (ASO) which is an obstructive lesion caused by arteriosclerosis in the legs and cause-unknown thromboangitis obliterans (TAO, Burger disease) which accompanies a vascular inflammation that causes thrombotic obstruction in arteries and veins of the limbs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe deep venous thrombosis (thrombophlebitis) is a thrombosis which is generated by surgical operation, long-term lying in bed, infection, pregnancy, blood flow stagnation by wound or the like or vein injury. This is apt to occur in the left leg, and its main symptom is a swelling, but symptoms such as flushing of the skin, over-swelling of veins and pain also occur. This is also apt to occur by a long-term enplane, and such a case is particularly called economy class syndrome.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDIC is a disease which occurs as a result of an ischemic organ disorder caused by the broad range microthrombus formation in micro blood vessels due to excess activation of the blood coagulation system in the living body, and its basal diseases include acute leukemia, cancer, infectious disease, obstetric disease, fluminant hepatitis, aortic aneurysm, cardiac aneurysm, giant hemangioma, diabetic coma, intravascular hemolysis, operation, wound, burn wound, plastic operation and the like. Since its morbid state greatly varies depending on the basal disease, it is necessary to carry out anticoagulation therapy together with the treatment of basal disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antithrombin III defective disease is a disease which accompanies quantitative reduction or qualitative abnormality of antithrombin III. The quantitative reduction or qualitative abnormality of antithrombin III causes inhibition reduction upon activated blood coagulation factors IX and X and thrombin and the like and becomes a cause of the onset of thrombosis. The antithrombin III defective disease was found in 1965 as a congenital hereditary disease in Norwegian families frequently generating thrombosis. The antithrombin III defective disease is found in several percent of patients having multiple or recurrent thrombosis. In the patients of antithrombin III defective disease, the onset frequency increases with the age, and this disease is generated in many cases through pregnancy, infection, surgical operation, wound, taking of oral contraceptives and the like as the start. Since thrombi are formed in many cases in leg deep veins, its onset is observed also in regions of pulmonary embolism, mesenteric vein, intracranial artery and vein and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe gestational toxicosis is a disease which occurs during pregnancy, and its main symptoms are hypertension, proteinuria and edema. A disease in which similar symptoms are observed even after delivery is called secondary disease of gestational toxicosis and included in the gestational toxicosis in a broad sense. Abnormality of the coagulation fibrinolysis system is related to the origin of gestational toxicosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antithrombin III composition can also be administered to patients before the onset of diseases for the purpose of preventing formation of thrombi. Specific examples of such patients include those patients having a possible danger of causing diseases such as vascular re-stricture after PTCA, unstable angina, peripheral artery obstruction, transient cerebral ischemic attack, acute myocardial infarction, non-Q wave myocardial infarction, DIC, thrombosis complication due to heparin thrombopenia, acute pulmonary thromboembolism, deep vein thrombosis, symptomatic pulmonary embolism and antithrombin III defective disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA pharmaceutical composition comprising the antithrombin in composition of the present invention may be administered alone as a therapeutic agent. However, it is preferably mixed with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and provided as a pharmaceutical preparation produced by an arbitrary method well known in the technical field of pharmaceutics.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is desirable to administer the pharmaceutical composition by the route that is most effective for the treatment. Suitable administration routes include oral administration and parenteral administration such as intraoral administration, intratracheal administration, intrarectal administration, subcutaneous administration, intramuscular administration and intravenous administration. In the case of an antithrombin III preparation, intravenous administration is preferable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical preparation may be in the form of spray, capsules, tablets, granules, syrup, emulsion, suppository, injection, ointment, tape, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical preparations suitable for oral administration include emulsions, syrups, capsules, tablets, powders and granules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiquid preparations such as emulsions and syrups can be prepared using, as additives, water, sugars such as sucrose, sorbitol and fructose, glycols such as polyethylene glycol and propylene glycol, oils such as sesame oil, olive oil and soybean oil, antiseptics such as p-hydroxybenzoates, flavors such as strawberry flavor and peppermint, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCapsules, tablets, powders, granules or the like can be prepared using, as additives, excipientssuch as lactose, glucose, sucrose and mannitol, disintegrators such as starch and sodium alginate, lubricants such as magnesium stearate and talc, binders such as polyvinyl alcohol, hydroxypropyl cellulose and gelatin, surfactants such as fatty acid esters, plasticizers such as glycerin, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical preparations suitable for parenteral administration include injections, suppositories and sprays.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInjections can be prepared using carriers comprising a salt solution, a glucose solution, or a mixture thereof or the like. It is also possible to prepare powder injections by freeze-drying the antithrombin III composition according to a conventional method and adding sodium chloride thereto.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuppositories can be prepared using carriers such as cacao butter; hydrogenated fat and carboxylic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antithrombin III composition may be administered as such in the form of spray, but sprays may be prepared using carriers which do not stimulate the oral or airway mucous membrane of a recipient and which can disperse the antithrombin III composition as fine particles to facilitate absorption thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable carriers include lactose and glycerin. It is also possible to prepare aerosols, dry powders or the like according to the properties of the antithrombin III composition and the carriers used. In preparing these parenteral preparations, the above-mentioned additives for the oral preparations may also be added.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dose and administration frequency will vary depending on the desired therapeutic effect, the administration route, the period of treatment, the patient's age and body weight or the like. However, an appropriate daily dose of the active ingredient for an adult person is generally 10 µg/kg to 20 mg/kg.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, the anti-blood coagulation activity of the antithrombin III composition can be examined by an \nin vitro\n test such as antithrombin activity measuring method or heparin cofactor activity measuring method, \nan in vivo\n test using a DIC morbid state model using an experimental animal such as a rabbit, or the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe method for measuring antithrombin activity, the method for measuring heparin cofactor activity and the DIC morbid state model test are carried out by methods described in literatures \n(\n \nThe Second Series of Pharmaceutical Research and Development, Volume 20, Blood Product, Ikuo Suzuki, ed., Hirokawa Publishing Company, Tokyo, Japan (1992\n); \nThe Course of Medicine (Igaku no Ayumi), 120, 1147 (1982\n); \nJapanese Pharmacology and Therapeutics, 17, 5843 (1989\n); \nClinic and Research (Rinsyo to Kenkyu), 62, 3573 (1985\n); \nClinic and Research (Rinsyo to Kenkyu), 62, 3688 (1985\n); \nParmacometrics, 30, 589 (1985\n) or the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention is explained below in more detail based on Examples; however, Examples are simple illustrations, and the scope of the present invention is not limited thereto.\n\n\n \n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \nFig. 1\n schematically shows a structure of human antithrombin III.\n\n\n \nFig. 2\n schematically shows complex type N-glycoside-linked sugar chains added to human plasma-derived antithrombin III.\n\n\n \nFig. 3\n shows the steps for constructing plasmid pKOFUT8Neo.\n\n\n \nFig. 4\n shows the steps for constructing plasmid pBS-ATIII.\n\n\n \nFig. 5\n shows the steps for constructing plasmid pKAN-ATIII.\n\n\n \nFig. 6\n shows the steps for constructing plasmid pKAN-ATIIIN135Q.\n\n\n \nFig.7\n shows elution pattern of antithrombin III by heparin affinity chromatography.\n\n\n \nFig 8\n shows heparin cofactor activity of antithrombin III.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nConstruction of CHO/DG44 cell line in which both alleles of al,6-fucosyltransferase (put8) on the genome have been disrupted\n\n\n \n \n \nThe CHO/DG44 cell line comprising the deletion of a genome region for both alleles of α1,6-fucosyltransferase (hereinafter also referred to as FUT8) including the translation initiation codons was constructed according to the following steps.\n\n\n \n1. Construction of Chinese hamster FUT8 gene targeting vector plasmid \npKOFUT8Neo comprising exon\n 2\n\n\n \n \n \nPlasmid pKOFUT8Neo was constructed in the following manner using targeting vector plasmid pKOFUT8Puro of \nexon\n 2 of Chinese hamster FUT8 gene constructed by the method described in Example 13-1 of \n \nWO02/31140\n \n, and plasmid pKOSelectNeo (manufactured by Lexicon).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsing 16 units of a restriction enzyme \nAsc\nI (New England Biolabs), 1.0 µg of plasmid pKOSelectNeo (manufactured by Lexicon) was allowed to react at 37°C for 2 hours.

Next, 20 ng of the purified PCR product fragment (\nEco\nRI-\nBam\nHI) and 80 ng of the purified pBluescript II KS(+) fragment (\nEco\nRI-\nBam\nHI) were ligated in the presence of Ligation High (manufactured by Toyobo Co., Ltd.), and an \nEscherichia coli\n strain DH5α (manufactured by Toyobo Co., Ltd.) was transformed using the thus obtained recombinant plasmid DNA. Plasmid DNA was prepared from each transformant, and its nucleotide sequence was analyzed using BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit v2.0 (manufactured by Applied Biosystems) and a DNA sequencer ABI PRISM 377 (manufactured by Applied Biosystems). As a result, a plasmid pBS-ATIII containing a gene sequence of a full translation region of human antithrombin III was obtained (\nFig. 4\n).\n\n\n \n3. Preparation of plasmid pKAN-ATIII\n\n\n \n \n \nIn 17 µl of sterile water, 3 µg of the pBS-ATIII prepared in the above was dissolved, and 10 units of \nEco\nRI (manufactured by Takara Bio), 10 units of \nBam\nHI (manufactured by Takara Bio) and 2 µl of 10 × H buffer were added thereto to obtain 20 µl of a reaction mixture, and the digestion reaction was carried out at 37°C for 16 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNext, 3 µg of a plasmid pKANTEX93 (\n \nWO97/10354\n \n) was dissolved in 17.5 µl of sterile water. Next, 20 µl of a reaction mixture was prepared by adding 10 units of \nEco\nRI and 2 µl of 10 × H buffer to the solution, and the digestion reaction was carried out at 37°C for 16 hours. After the reaction, phenol/chloroform extraction treatment and ethanol precipitation were carried out, and the thus recovered plasmid was dissolved in 17.5 µl of sterile water. Next, 20 µl of a reaction mixture was further prepared by adding 10 units of \nBam\nHI and 2 µl of 10 × K buffer to the solution, and the digestion reaction was carried out at 37°C for 16 hours. The pBS-ATIII fragment (\nEco\nRI-\nBam\nHI) and pKANTEX93 fragment (\nEco\nRI-\nBam\nHI), both obtained in the above, were subjected to 1.5% (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis, and respective DNA fragments of approximately 1.4 kb and 9.0 kb were purified using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (manufactured by QIAGEN). Next, 50 ng of the purified pBS-ATIII fragment (\nEco\nRI-\nBam\nHI) and 30 ng of the purified pKANTEX93 fragment (\nEco\nRI-\nBam\nHI) were ligated in the presence of Ligation High (manufactured by Toyobo Co., Ltd.), and the \nE\n. \ncoli\n strain DH5α (manufactured by Toyobo Co., Ltd.) was transformed using the thus obtained recombinant plasmid DNA. Plasmid DNA was prepared from each transformant, and its nucleotide sequence was analyzed using BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit v2.0 and the DNA sequencer ABI PRISM 377 (manufactured by Applied Biosystems). As a result, a Plasmid pKAN-ATIII for animal cell expression containing a gene sequence of a full translation region of human antithrombin III was obtained (\nFig. 5\n).\n\n\n \n4. Stable introduction of human antithrombin III expression plasmid into CHO/DG44 cell line in which genomic FUT8 gene was double-knocked out\n\n\n \n \n \nTransformants were prepared by stably introducing the plasmid pKAN-ATIII prepared in the above item into the CHO/DG44 cell line in which the FUT8 gene was double-knocked out prepared in Example 1. Gene introduction of the plasmid pKAN-ATIII was carried out by the following procedure in accordance with the electroporation [\nCytotechnology, 3 133 (1990\n)]. First, 100 µg of the plasmid pKAN-ATIII was linearized by preparing 600 µl of a reaction mixture containing 60 µl of NEBuffer 3 (manufactured by New England Biolabs) and 120 unites of a restriction enzyme \nMlu\nI (manufactured by New England Biolabs) and the digestion reaction was carried out at 37°C for 5 hours. After the reaction, the reaction mixture was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction treatment and ethanol precipitation to thereby recover the linear plasmid. Next, one cell line among the CHO/DG44 cell clones in which the FUT8 gene was double-knocked out prepared in Example 1 was suspended in a K-PBS buffer (137 mmol/l KCl, 2.7 mmol/l NaCl, 8.1 mmol/l Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 1.5 mmol/l KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 4.0 mmol/l MgCl\n2\n) to prepare a suspension of 8 × 10\n7\n cells/ml. After 200 µl of the cell suspension (1.6 × 10\n6\n cells) was mixed with 9 µg of the above-described linear plasmid, a full volume of the cell-DNA mixture was transferred into Gene Pulser Cuvette (2 mm in inter-electrode distance, manufactured by BIO-RAD), and gene introduction was carried out using an electroporation device Gene Pulser II (manufactured by BIO-RAD) under conditions of 350 V in pulse voltage and 250 µF in electric capacity. After carrying out the gene introduction on 4 cuvettes in the same manner, the cell suspension was suspended in 120 ml of IMDM medium (manufactured by Life Technology) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (manufactured by Life Technology) and 50 µg/ml gentamicin (manufactured by Nacalai Tesque) and inoculated at 100 µl/well into 96-well 12 plates for adherent cells (manufactured by Greiner). The culturing was carried out in a CO\n2\n incubator (manufactured by TABAI) under conditions of 5% CO\n2\n and 37°C.\n\n\n \n5. Obtaining of 500 nM MTX-resistant cell line\n\n\n \n \n \nThe cells into which the pKAN-ATIII was stably introduced obtained in the above item were cultured for 6 days, and then the culture supernatants were discarded and the IMDM medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 50 µg/ml gentamicin and 50 nM methotrexate (MTX) (manufactured by SIGMA) was dispensed at 100 µl/well. The culturing was continued for 9 days while repeating this medium exchanging work at an interval of 3 to 4 days. Next, the culturing was continued for 18 days while repeating the medium exchanging work using the IMDM medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 50 µg/ml gentamicin and 200 nM MTX at an interval of 3 to 4 days, and the finally formed colonies were inoculated into a 24 well plate (manufactured by SIGMA). Subsequently, the culturing was continued for 19 days while repeating the medium exchanging work using the IMDM medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 50 µg/ml gentamicin and 500 nM MTX at an interval of 3 to 4 days, optionally expanding the culture, thereby obtaining transformant, resistant to 500 nM MTX.\n\n\n \n6. Selection of cell line highly producing antithrombin III\n\n\n \n \n \nFrom each of the several 500 nm MTX-resistant cell lines obtained in the above item, 1.5 × 10\n6\n cells were collected, suspended in 5 ml of the IMDM medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 50 µg/ml gentamicin and 500 nM MTX, and then cultured by inoculating into a tissue culture flask (culturing \narea\n 25 cm\n2\n, manufactured by Greiner). Three days after the culturing, the culture supernatant was recovered, and the amount of human antithrombin III contained in the supernatant was measured using ELISA for antithrombin (ATIII) kit (manufactured by Affinity Biological). The method was carried out in accordance with the instructions attached to the kit, and a commercially available human plasma-derived antithrombin III (manufactured by SIGMA) was used as the standard preparation. Among the several 500 nM MTX-resistant cell lines, it was confirmed that human antithrombin III is expressed in a concentration of 304 µg/ml in the culture supernatant of a cell line MS705 pKAN-ATIII 27. The cell line MS705 pKAN-ATIII 27 was deposited on September 9, 2003, as FERM BP-08472 in International Patent Organism Depositary, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (\nCentral\n 6, 1-1, Higashi 1-chome, Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki, Japan).\n\n\n \nExample 3\n\n\nExpression of recombinant antithrombin III by CHO/DG44 cell:\n\n\n1. Introduction of human antithrombin III expression plasmid into CHO/DG44 cell line\n\n\n \n \n \nFirst, 100 µg of the plasmid pKAN-ATIII prepared in Example 2-3 was linearized by preparing 600 µl of a reaction mixture containing 60 µl of NEBuffer 3 (manufactured by New England Biolabs) and 120 units of a restriction enzyme \nMlu\nI (manufactured by New England Biolabs) and the digestion reaction was carried out at 37°C for 5 hours. After the reaction, the reaction mixture was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction treatment and ethanol precipitation to thereby recover the linear plasmid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNext, a CHO/DG44 cell line [\nProc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA, 77, 4216 (1980\n)] was suspended in K-PBS buffer (137 mmol/l KCl, 2.7 mmol/l NaCl, 8.1 mmol/l Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 1.5 mmol/l KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 4.0 mmol/l MgCl\n2\n) to give a density of 8 × 10\n7\n cells/ml. Next, 200 µl of the cell suspension (1.6 × 10\n6\n cells) was mixed with 9 µg of the above-described linear plasmid, a full volume of the cell-DNA mixture was transferred into Gene Pulser Cuvette (2 mm in inter-electrode distance, manufactured by BIO-RAD), and gene introduction was carried out using an electroporation device Gene Pulser (manufactured by BIO-RAD) under conditions of 350 V in pulse voltage and 250 µF in electric capacity. The electroporation was carried out in accordance with a reference [\nCytotechnology, 3, 133 (1990\n)]. After the gene introduction, the cell suspension was suspended in 30 ml of IMDM medium (manufactured by Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (manufactured by Life Technologies) and 50 µg/ml of gentamicin (manufactured by Nacalai Tesque) and inoculated at 100 µl/well into 96-well 3 plates for adherent cells (manufactured by Greiner). The culturing was carried out under conditions of 5% CO\n2\n and 37°C.\n\n\n \n2. Obtaining of MTX-resistant cell line\n\n\n \n \n \nThe pKAN-ATIII-introduced cells obtained in the above were cultured for 6 days, and then the culture supernatants were discarded and the IMDM medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 50 µg/ml gentamicin and 50 nM methotrexate (MTX) (manufactured by SIGMA) was dispensed at 100 µl/well. The culturing was continued for 9 days while repeating this medium exchanging work at an interval of 3 to 4 days. Next, the culturing was continued for 18 days while repeating the medium exchanging work using the IMDM medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 50 µg/ml gentamicin and 200 nM MTX at an interval of 3 to 4 days, and the finally formed colonies were inoculated into a 24 well plate (manufactured by Greiner). Subsequently, the culturing was continued for 19 days while repeating the medium exchanging work using the IMDM medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 50 µg/ml gentamicin and 500 nM MTX at an interval of 3 to 4 days, optionally expanding the culture, thereby obtaining transformants resistant to 500 nM MTX.\n\n\n \n3. Selection of cell line highly producing antithrombin III\n\n\n \n \n \nFrom each of the several 500 nm MTX-resistant cell lines obtained in the above item, 1.0 × 10\n6\n cells were collected, suspended in 5 ml of the IMDM medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 50 µg/ml gentamicin and 500 nM MTX, and then cultured by inoculating into a tissue culture flask. Three days after the culturing, the culture supernatant was recovered, and the amount of recombinant antithrombin III contained in the supernatant was measured using ELISA for antithrombin (ATEII) kit (manufactured by Affinity Biological), and a highly producing cell line was selected from the result. The method was carried out in accordance with the instructions attached to the ELISA kit, and a human plasma-derived preparation Neuart (manufactured by Mitsubishi Pharma Corporation) was used as the standard preparation. A transformant in which accumulation of recombinant human antithrombin III was found in its culture supernatant was named pKAN-ATIII DG44.\n\n\n \nExample 4\n\n\nPurification of recombinant antithrombin III and analysis of sugar chain structure:\n\n\n1. Naturalization to serum-free medium\n\n\n \n \n \nThe recombinant antithrombin III-expressing FUT8 gene-double-knockout cell line and recombinant antithrombin III-expressing CHO/DG44 cell line prepared in Examples 2 and 3 were naturalized to a serum-free medium by the following method. Each cell line was suspended in 15 ml of EX-CELL 302 medium (manufactured by JRH) supplemented with 4 mM of L-glutamine (manufactured by Invitrogen), 50 µg/ml of gentamicin and 500 nM of MTX (hereinafter referred to as serum-free medium) to give a density of 5 × 10\n5\n cells/ml and inoculated into a 125 ml-conical flask to carry out a batch culturing. The culturing was carried out at 35°C and at a rotation speed of 90 to 100 rpm, and when sub-culturing was carried out, the air in the conical flask was replaced by blowing air containing 5% CO\n2\n onto the medium surface, in a volume of 4-fold or more of the culture vessel volume. Three days thereafter, the medium was exchanged, and sub-culturing was carried out with 5 × 10\n5\n cells/ml on the 6th day. Thereafter, the sub-culturing was repeated at an interval of 3 to 4 days for 2 weeks to naturalize the cells to the serum-free medium. By this culturing, a transformant pKAN-ATIII AFMS705 derived from the FUT8 gene-double-knockout cell line and having the ability to grow in the serum-free medium and a transformant pKAN-ATIII AFDG44 derived from the CHO/DG44 cell line and having the ability to grow in the serum-free medium were obtained. Each of the thus obtained cell lines was suspended in 15 ml of the serum-free medium to give a density of 3.0 × 10\n5\n cells/ml and cultured by inoculating into a 125 ml flask. Three days after the culturing, the culture supernatant was recovered, and the amount of recombinant antithrombin III contained in the supernatant was measured using ELISA for antithrombin (ATIII) kit (manufactured by Affinity Biological) to confirm that the recombinant antithrombin III was expressed by both of the transformants in almost the same concentration, namely 18 µg/ml in the culture supernatant of pKAN-ATIII AFMS705 and 28 µg/ml in the culture supernatant of pKAN-ATIII AFDG44. In this connection, the cell line pKAN-ATIII AFMS705 was deposited as a cell line name pKAN-ATIII AFMS705 on August 10, 2004, as FERM BP-10088 in International Patent Organism Depositary, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (\nCentral\n 6, 1-1, Higashi 1-chome, Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki, Japan).\n\n\n \n2. Obtaining of culture supernatant containing recombinant antithrombin III\n\n\n \n \n \nEach of the cell lines pKAN-ATIII AFMS705 and pKAN-ATIII AFDG44 obtained in the above as two serum-free-naturalized cell lines was suspended in 450 ml of the serum-free medium to give a density of 3 × 10\n5\n cells/ml and inoculated into a 2 liter capacity roller bottle (manufactured by Becton Dickinson), and the air in the conical flask was replaced by blowing air containing 5% CO\n2\n onto the medium surface, in a volume of 4-fold or more of the culture vessel volume. The culturing was carried out at 35°C and at a rotation speed of 5 to 10 rpm, and 37.5 ml of a feed medium and 1.8 ml of 50% glucose solution were added thereto on the 5th day of the culturing for the purpose of supplementing for consumed nutrient substances such as amino acids. The feed medium is a medium comprising amino acids (L-alanine 0.22 g/l, L-arginine monohydrochloride 0.74 g/l, L-asparagine monohydrate 0.22 g/l, L-aspartic acid 0.26 g/l, L-cystine dihydrochloride 0.80 g/l, L-glutamic acid 0.66 g/l, L-glutamine 7.3 g/l, glycine 0.26 g/l, L-histidine monohydrochloride dihydrate 0.37 g/l, L-isoleucine 0.92 g/l, L-leucine 0.92 g/l, L-lysine monohydrochloride 1.29 g/l, L-methionine 0.26 g/l, L-phenylalanine 0.58 g/l, L-proline 0.35 g/l, L-serine 0.37 g/l, L-threonine 0.84 g/l, L-tryptophan 0.14 g/l, L-tyrosine disodium dihydrate 0.92 g/l and L-valine 0.83 g/l), vitamins (d-biotin 0.0001 g/l, calcium D-pantothenate 0.035 g/l, choline chloride 0.035 g/l, folic acid 0.035 g/l, myo-inositol 0.063 g/l, niacin amide 0.035 g/l, pyridoxal hydrochloride 0.035 g/l, riboflavin 0.0035 g/l, thiamine hydrochloride 0.035 g/l and cyanocobalamin 0.0001 g/l), recombinant human insulin 0.31 g/l (manufactured by JRH), ethanolamine 0.025 g/l (manufactured by Sigma-Aldrich), 2-mercaptoehtanol 0.0098 g/l (manufactured by Sigma-Aldrich), a soybean hydrolysate HY-SOY 8 g/l (manufactured by Quest Intemational), sodium selenite 16.8 µg/l (manufactured by Sigma-Aldrich), cholesterol lipid concentrated solution 2 ml/l (250 × aqueous solution, manufactured by Invitrogen) and ferric ethylenediaminetetraacetate sodium salt 0.05 g/l (manufactured by Sigma-Aldrich). In and after the feeding, air replacement by aeration was carried out every day until completion of the culturing. By keeping 80% or more of the survival ratio, the culturing was carried out for 9 to 10 days. After completion of the culturing, the amount of recombinant human antithrombin in the culture supernatant was measured using ELISA for antithrombin (ATIII) kit (manufactured by Affinity Biological). As a result, it was confirmed that the recombinant antithrombin III is contained in the culture supernatants of pKAN-ATIII AFMS705 and pKAN-ATIII AFDG44 in respective concentrations of 68 µg/ml and 87 µg/ml. Hereinafter, the recombinant antithrombin III produced by pKAN-ATIII AFMS705 is referred to as ATIII MS705, and the recombinant antithrombin III produced by pKAN-ATIII AFDG44 as ATIII DG44, respectively.\n\n\n \n3. Purification of recombinant antithrombin III\n\n\n \n \n \nRecombinant antithrombin III was purified in the following manner from the culture supernatant containing recombinant antithrombin III, obtained in the above item, in accordance with the method described in a reference [\nMeth. Enzymol.,\n \n222,\n 525, 1993]. A portion of the culture supernatant containing recombinant antithrombin III obtained in the above item, corresponding to approximately 250 mg of the recombinant antithrombin III, was applied to a heparin column (\nHeparin Sepharose\n 6 Fast Flow, 250 ml, manufactured by Amersham Bioscience) which had been equilibrated with a buffer solution consisting of 50 mM Tris, 14 mM citric acid and 0.15 M NaCl (pH 7.4). Subsequently, the heparin column was washed with 10 CV of the equilibration buffer, and then the recombinant antithrombin III was eluted using a linear gradient elution method (12 CV) up to 3 M NaCl concentration. The equipment used was Hiload Chromatography System (manufactured by Amersham Bioscience), the flow rate was 21 ml/min, and the recombinant human antithrombin III elution fractions were fractionated at 50 ml. When the amount of human antithrombin III in each fraction was measured using ELISA for antithrombin(ATIII) kit (manufactured by Affinity Biological), roughly dividing three peaks were observed in the elution pattern as shown in \nFig. 7\n, and ATIII MS705 and ATIII DG44 showed different elution patterns. In the following, these are called peak (1) fraction, peak (2) fraction and peak (3) fraction in that order starting from the most quickly eluted fraction. It has been reported that plurality of peaks were found when antithrombin III was purified by heparin affinity chromatography in the following literatures [e.g., \nJ. Biol. Chem., 268, 17588 (1993\n), \nBiochem. J., 286, 793 (1992\n), \nJ. Biol. Chem., 264, 21153 (1989\n), \netc\n.]. In addition, when elution pattern of Neuart was examined, its elution was observed limiting to the peak (2) fraction. Each of the main peak fractions corresponding to ATIII MS705 peak (2) fraction and peak (3) fraction, and ATIII DG44 peak (1) fraction and peak (2) fraction was desalted with 5 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) by a dia-filtration method using Pericon XL (manufactured by Millipore) and Biomax 10, (manufactured by Millipore). Each of the thus desalted peak fractions was applied to DEAE Sepharose Fast Flow Column (manufactured by Amersham, 480 ml) and adsorbed thereto. Subsequently, the column was washed with 12 CV of 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), and then the recombinant antithrombin III was eluted at a flow rate of 40 ml/min using a linear gradient elution method (8.6 CV) up to 1.0 M NaCl concentration. The elution pattern was measured by its absorbance (A280 nm). Next, the elution fractions containing recombinant antithrombin III were combined, and the buffer solution was replaced by PBS by a dia-filtration method using Pericon XL (manufactured by Millipore) and Biomax 10 (manufactured by Millipore), thereby preparing samples for evaluation. By measuring absorbance (A280 nm) of the samples for evaluation, the protein concentration was calculated based on A280 nm 1.0 = 0.64 mg/ml. In addition, determination using ELISA for antithrombin(ATIII) kit (manufactured by Affinity Biological) was also carried out to confirm that the concentration was identical by the absorbance method and the ELISA method. Also, reduction SDS-PAGE was carried out using PAGEL SPG520L (manufactured by Atto). In the electrophoresis, 2 µg of recombinant antithrombin III reduced with 2-mercaptoethanol was used, and the staining was carried out by CBB staining. As a result, bands other than the ATIII band of approximately 60 kD in molecular weight were not confirmed in all of the samples for evaluation.\n\n\n \n4. Composition analysis of recombinant antithrombin III neutral sugar and amino sugar\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compositions of neutral sugar and amino sugar were analyzed on the samples for evaluation obtained in Example 4-3. Each of the recombinant antithrombin III evaluation samples was hydrolyzed at 100°C for 2 hours in the presence of 4.0 mo/l trifluoroacetic acid to release neutral sugars and amino sugars from the protein. The thus released sugars were analyzed using DX-500 sugar analyzer (manufactured by Dionex) with reference to the method described in the literature of \nMichael Weitzhandler et al. [Analytical Biochemistry, 241, 128-134 (1996\n)] and DIONEX Application Note 92 (The Determination of Sugars in Molasses by High-Performance Anion Exchange with Pulsed Amperometric Detection). It is known that the sugar chain structure of human plasma-derived antithrombin III is a complex type double-strand sugar chain which does not contain fucose \n \n[\n \n \nArch. Biochem. Biophys., 203, 458 (1980\n)] (\nFig. 2\n). In the analysis of the results of neutral sugar and amino sugar composition analysis, compositional ratios of respective monosaccharide components (fucose, galactose and mannose) were calculated by regarding the compositional ratio of N-acetylglucosamine as 4. As a result of the analysis, fucose was detected in the sugar chain components of ATIII DG44, while the fucose content in the sugar chain components of ATIII MS705 was the detection limit or less, similar to the case of Neuart which is a human plasma-derived antithrombin III. In addition, based on the compositional ratios of respective monosaccharide components, it was suggested that the main sugar chain structure of all samples is not a high mannose type or hybrid type but a complex type double-strand sugar chain.\n\n\n \n5. Hydroxyapatite chromatography analysis\n\n\n \n \n \nThe α type and β type compositional ratio of the samples for evaluation obtained in Example 4-3 was analyzed by hydroxyapatite chromatography, with reference to the method of \nGoran Karlsson and Stefan Winge [Protein Expression and Purification, 28, 196-201 (2003\n)]. As a result, similar to the case of the human plasma-derived Neuart, the a type was mainly contained in the ATIII MS705 peak (2) fraction and ATIII DG44 peak (1) fraction. Also, the α type and β type were contained in the ATIII DG44 peak (2) fraction at almost the same ratio. Results of the neutral sugar and amino sugar analysis and hydroxyapatite chromatography analysis are summarized in Table 1.\n\n \nTable 1\n \n \n \n \n \nSugar chain structure\n \nFucose\n \nMain molecular type\n \n \n \n \nATIII MS705 peak (2)\n \ncomplex type double-strand\n \n-\n \nα\n \n \n \nATIII MS705 peak (3)\n \ncomplex type double-strand\n \n-\n \nβ\n \n \n \nATIII DG44 peak (1)\n \ncomplex type double-strand\n \n+\n \nα\n \n \n \nATIII DG44 peak (2)\n \ncomplex type double-strand\n \n+\n \nα & β\n \n \n \nNeuart\n \ncomplex type double-strand\n \n-\n \nα\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nSince ATIII DG44 contained fucose in the sugar chain, its sugar chain structure was different from that of the human plasma-derived antithrombin III. On the other hand, it was found that sugar chain structures of the ATIII MS705 peak (2) fraction and ATIII MS705 peak (3) fraction are sugar chain structures close to the human plasma-derived α type and β type antithrombin III, respectively. In addition, it was able to separate the α type and β type of ATIII MS705 by a heparin affinity-aided purification method as reported in a reference [\nJ. Biol. Chem., 268, 17588 (1993\n)] on human plasma-derived antithrombin III. However, it was not able to separate the ATIII DG44 peak (2) fraction when the same purification was carried out. Based on the above, it was revealed that the ATIII MS705 has properties equivalent to those of the human plasma-derived antithrombin III.\n\n\n \nExample 5\n\n\nComparison of biological activities of purified recombinant antithrombin III samples:\n\n\n1. Measurement of heparin dissociation constant\n\n\n \n \n \nSince the three-dimensional structure of antithrombin III molecule changes by the binding of antithrombin III with heparin, the heparin dissociation constant can be measured making use of the change in fluorescence intensity of the tryptophan residue constituting the antithrombin III protein.

First, a buffer solution (pH 7.4) comprising 20 mM Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA·2H\n2\nO and 0.1% PEG 6000 was prepared. This buffer solution was used in diluting the samples. From 0 to 20 equivalents of heparin (manufactured by SIGMA) was added to 50 nM of antithrombin III, and the fluorescence intensity of each solution was measured at an excitation wavelength of 280 nm and a fluorescence wavelength of 340 nm. The dissociation constant was analyzed by an analyzing software GraphPad prism 4 (manufactured by Graphpad) using the equation 1). Results of the measurement of heparin dissociation constant (Kd value, unit nM) of samples for evaluation obtained in Example 4-3 are shown in Table 2. The binding strength of ATIII to heparin becomes strong as the Kd value becomes small. Thus, the ATIII MS705 peak (3) fraction showed the largest binding strength, followed by the ATIII MS705 peak (2) fraction and the ATIII DG44 peak (2) fraction, and the ATIII DG44 peak (1) fraction showed the weakest binding strength.\n\n \nTable 2\n \n \n \n \n \nKd (nM)\n \n \n \n \nATIII MS705 peak (2)\n \n9.87 ± 1.09\n \n \n \nATIII MS705 peak (3)\n \n3.06 ± 0.07\n \n \n \nATIII DG44 peak (1)\n \n59.71 ± 2.11\n \n \n \nATIII DG44 peak (2)\n \n9.84 ± 0.97\n \n \n \nNeuart\n \n20.09 ± 3.60\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n2. Measurement of heparin cofactor activity\n\n\n \n \n \nIt is known that thrombin inhibition rate of antithrombin III considerably increases in the presence of heparin. Also, the binding reaction of thrombin with antithrombin III occurs at a molar ratio of 1:1, and they mutually lose their activities after the reaction, so that antithrombin reaction of the antithrombin completes within a markedly short period of time in the presence of heparin. The heparin cofactor activity is represented by the residual thrombin activity at the time of the completion of the antithrombin reaction, or in other words, the heparin cofactor activity can measure the amount of the activated antithrombin III at the time of the completion of the antithrombin reaction [\nZoku lyakuhin No Kaihatsu (A Sequel to Medicines, Continued), 20, 185 (1992\n)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to measure the heparin cofactor activity, a buffer solution (pH 8.3) consisting of 0.15 M NaCl, 0.05 M Tris-HCl and 0.2% albumin was firstly prepared. This buffer solution was used in diluting samples and preparing an enzyme solution. To an antithrombin III solution, 1.0 ml of an enzyme solution comprising 2.5 units/ml of thrombin (manufactured by Enzyme Research Laboratories) and 0.6 unit/ml of heparin (manufactured by SIGMA) was added, followed by reaction at 37°C for 5 minutes. Subsequently, 100 µl of 2.0 mM S-2238 (manufactured by Daiichi Pure Chemicals) as a specific substrate of thrombin was added thereto and allowed to develop color for 2 minutes, and then the reaction was stopped with 50% acetic acid. The residual thrombin activity was calculated from the absorbance (A405 nm) of p-nitroaniline formed by the degradation of S-2238 in the reaction mixture. In this case, antithrombin III was used in the measurement by diluting it within the range of 0.15 to 4 µg/ml. Neuart was used as the standard substance for the preparation of a calibration curve, and the heparin cofactor activity was calculated as the activity (unit/ml) per unit volume (liquid volume). The heparin cofactor activity in each of the samples for evaluation obtained in Example 4-3 was measured, and the obtained activity values were expressed by the activity (unit/g) per unit mass, with the results shown in \nFig. 8\n. The peak fraction (2) of ATIII MS705 and peak fraction (3) of ATIII MS705 showed similar activity to that of the human plasma-derived preparation Neuart (manufactured by Mitsubishi Pharma Corporation), but the ATIII DG44 peak fraction (1) and ATIII DG44 peak fraction (2) showed lower values than that of Neuart.\n\n\n \n3. Measurement of thrombin inhibition secondary rate constant in the absence of heparin\n\n\n \n \n \nThe thrombin inhibition secondary rate constant was measured in accordance with a reference (\nJ. Biol. Chem., 277, 24460 (2002\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThrombin inhibition reaction of ATIII in the absence of heparin can be considered by approximating to a pseudo-primary reaction under conditions in which antithrombin III is present in an excess amount based on the amount of thrombin, so that the following equation 2) is formed. \n \n \n \n \nln\n \n \nT\n \n \n \nt\n \n \n=\n \n-\n \nkobs\n \n*\n \nt\n \n+\n \nln\n \n⁢\n \n \n \n \nT\n \n \n \n0\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n[T]\n1\n:\n \nthrombin concentration after t hour\n \n[T]\n0\n:\n \ninitial concentration of thrombin\n \nkobs:\n \npseudo-primary rate constant\n \nt:\n \ntime\n \n\n\n \n \nkobs\n \n=\n \nk\n \n \nAT\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \nk:\n \nsecondary rate constant\n \n[AT]:\n \nantithrombin III concentration\n \n\n\n \n \n \nAccordingly, in order to measure the thrombin inhibition secondary rate constant, a buffer solution (pH 7.4) comprising 20 mM Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA·2H\n2\nO and 0.1% PEG 8000 was firstly prepared. This buffer solution was used in diluting samples and preparing an enzyme solution. An enzyme solution comprising 100 nM antithrombin III and 10 nM thrombin was prepared and allowed to react at 25°C for a period of 1 to 40 minutes. At each period, 100 µl of 0.15 mM S-2238 (manufactured by Daiichi Pure Chemicals) as a specific substrate of thrombin was added thereto, and the absorbance (A405 nm) for approximately 2 minutes was measured. The residual thrombin concentration was calculated from the change in absorbance at each period, and the pseudo-primary rate constant was calculated using the above-described equation 2). In addition, thrombin inhibition secondary rate constant (unit/M/second) in the absence of heparin was calculated using the above-described formula 3). The secondary rate constant of the samples for evaluation obtained in Example 4-3 is shown in Table 3. S.D. represents standard deviation. Regarding the thrombin inhibition secondary rate constant in the absence of heparin, the ATIII DG44 peak (1) fraction showed a slightly low value, but all of the other samples for evaluation showed similar activity to that of the human plasma-derived antithrombin \nIII\n Neuart.\n\n \nTable 3\n \n \n \n \n \nSecondary rate constant (- hep)\n \n \n \n/M/sec\n \nS.D.\n \n \n \n \nATIII MS705 peak (2)\n \n8.5E + 03\n \n1.9 E + 02\n \n \n \nATIII MS705 peak (3)\n \n8.8E + 03\n \n3.7 E + 02\n \n \n \nATIII DG44 peak (1)\n \n7.7E + 03\n \n1.8 E + 02\n \n \n \nATIII DG44 peak (2)\n \n8.6E + 03\n \n1.6 E + 02\n \n \n \nNeuart\n \n8.2E + 03\n \n8.8 E + 01\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n4. Measurement of thrombin inhibition secondary rate constant in the presence of heparin\n\n\n \n \n \nThe thrombin inhibition secondary rate constant of the samples for evaluation obtained in Example 4-3, in the presence of heparin, was measured by the following method in accordance with a reference \n[\n \nBiochem.

The residual thrombin concentration was calculated from the change in absorbance at each period, and the pseudo-primary rate constant was calculated using the above-described equation 2).

Regarding the numerical values, for example, 2.5 E + 07 means 2.5×10\n7\n. Also, S.D. means standard deviation. Regarding the secondary rate constant, the peak (2) fraction of ATIII MS705 and peak (3) fraction of ATIII MS705 showed similar activity to that of Neuart, but the ATIII DG44 peak (1) fraction showed a considerably low value, and the ATIII DG44 peak (2) fraction also showed a slightly lower value. Based on this result, it was found that a fraction having low antithrombin activity in the presence of heparin is contained in the recombinant antithrombin III produced by using the CHO/DG44 cell line. On the other hand, it was found that a fraction mainly showing similar activity to that of the human plasma-derived antithrombin III is obtained from the recombinant antithrombin III produced by using the FUT8 gene-double-knockout cell line.\n\n \nTable 4\n \n \n \n \n \nSecondary rate constant (+ hep)\n \n \n \n/M/sec\n \nS.D.\n \n \n \n \nATIII MS705 peak (2)\n \n2.5E + 07\n \n1.6E + 06\n \n \n \nATIII MS705 peak (3)\n \n2.6E + 07\n \n8.7E + 05\n \n \n \nATIII DG44 peak (1)\n \n8.7E + 06\n \n1.1E + 04\n \n \n \nATIII DG44 peak (2)\n \n2.0E + 07\n \n8.1E + 05\n \n \n \nNeuart\n \n2.3E + 07\n \n2.9E + 05\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a result of the analyses in Examples 4 and 5, it was shown that the recombinant antithrombin III produced by the FUT8 gene-double-knockout cell line is a protein having similar properties to those of the human plasma-derived Antithrombin III, in terms of the sugar chain structures and biological activities, in comparison with the recombinant antithrombin III produced by the CHO/DG44 cell line. From this result, it was shown that the recombinant antithrombin III produced by the FUT8 gene-double-knockout cell line is suitable as a substitute for the human plasma-derived antithrombin III.\n\n\n \nExample 6\n\n\nExpression of amino acid-modified recombinant antithrombin III in FUT8 gene-double-knockout cell:\n\n\n \n \n \nAn FUT8 gene-double-knockout cell capable of expressing a mutation type human antithrombin III (hereinafter referred to as \"ATIIIN135Q\"), in which asparagine residue at the 135th position counting from the N-terminal of mature type human antithrombin III was substituted with a glutamine residue, was prepared by the method shown below. In this connection, since the ATIIIN135Q composition has 3 addition sites for N-binding type sugar chains, all of the expressed recombinant antithrombin III become the β-type.\n\n\n \n1. Preparation of plasmid pBS-ATIIIN135Q\n\n\n \n \n \nFirstly, two oligo DNA primers for site-directed mutagenesis (SEQ ID NOs:30 and 31) for replacing the 167th asparagine residue counting from the N-terminal to a glutamine residue were prepared for the antithrombin III gene sequence (UniGene: Hs.75599, SEQ ID NO:1). Using the pBS-ATIII prepared in Example 2-2 as the template, site-directed mutagenesis was applied to the antithrombin III cDNA sequence using the above-described primers and Quick Change® Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (manufactured by STRATAGENE). The method was carried out in accordance with the manual attached to the kit. Plasmid DNA samples were prepared from the thus obtained transformants using QIAprep® Spin Miniprep Kit (manufactured by QIAGEN), and their nucleotide sequences were analyzed using BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit v2.0 (manufactured by Applied Biosystems) and a DNA sequencer ABI PRISM 377 (manufactured by Applied Biosystems). As a result, a plasmid pBS-ATIIIN135Q comprising a cDNA sequence of a full translation region of a mutation type antithrombin III (ATIIIN135Q) was obtained (\nFig. 6\n).\n\n\n \n2. Preparation of expression vector pKAN-ATIIIN135Q\n\n\n \n \n \nIn 17 µl of sterile water, 3 µg of the pBS-ATIIIN135Q prepared in the above was dissolved, 10 units of \nEco\nRI (manufactured by Takara Bio), 10 units of \nBam\nHI (manufactured by Takara Bio) and 2 µl of 10 × H buffer were added thereto to prepare 20 µl of a reaction mixture, and then the digestion reaction was carried out at 37°C for 16 hours. Next, 3 µg of a plasmid pKANTEX93 (described in \n \nWO97/10354\n \n) was dissolved in 17.5 µl of sterile water. By adding 10 units of \nEco\nRI and 2 µl of 10 × H buffer to the solution, 20 µl of a reaction mixture was prepared to carry out the digestion reaction at 37°C for 16 hours. After the reaction, phenol/chloroform extraction treatment and ethanol precipitation were carried out, and the recovered plasmid was dissolved in 17.5 µl of sterile water. By further adding 10 units of \nBam\nHI and 2 µl of 10 × K buffer to the solution, 20 µl of a reaction mixture was prepared to carry out the digestion reaction at 37°C for 16 hours. The pBS-ATIIIN135Q fragment (\nEco\nRI-\nBam\nHI) and pKANTEX93 fragment (\nEco\nRI-\nHam\nHI) obtained in the above were subjected to 1.5% (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis, and approximately 1.4 kbp and 9.0 kbp of DNA fragments were respectively purified using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (manufactured by QIAGEN). Next, 20µl of a reaction mixture containing 50 ng of the purified pBS-ATIIIN135Q fragment (\nEco\nRI-\nBam\nHI), 30 ng of the purified pKANTEX93 fragment (\nEco\nRI\n-Bam\nHI) and Ligation High (manufactured by Toyobo Co., Ltd.) was prepared, and the ligation reaction was carried out at 16°C for 16 hours. Using the thus obtained plasmid DNA, an \nE. coli\n strain DH5α (manufactured by Toyobo Co., Ltd.) was transformed. By preparing a plasmid DNA from the resulting transformant using QIAprep® Spin Miniprep Kit (manufactured by QIAGEN), a mutation type AT antithrombin III expression plasmid for animal cell, pKAN-ATIIIN135Q, was obtained (\nFig. 6\n).\n\n\n \n3. Introduction of ATIIIN135Q expression plasmid into FUT8 gene-double-knockout cell\n\n\n \n \n \nThe plasmid pKAN-ATIIIN135Q prepared in Example 6-2 was stably introduced into the FUT8 gene-double-knockout cell prepared in Example 1. The gene introduction was carried out by the following procedure in accordance with the electroporation method [\nCytotechnology, 3, 133 (1990\n)]. Firstly, 30 µg of the plasmid pKAN-ATIIIN135Q was linearized by preparing 200 µl of a reaction mixture containing 20 µl of NEBuffer 3 (manufactured by New England Biolabs) and 100 unites of a restriction enzyme \nMlu\nI (manufactured by New England Biolabs) and the digestion reaction was carried out at 37°C for 16 hours. After the reaction, the reaction mixture was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction treatment and ethanol precipitation to thereby recover the linear plasmid. Next, the FUT8 gene-double-knockout cell obtained in Example 1 was suspended in a K-PBS buffer (137 mmol/l KCl, 2.7 mmol/l NaCl, 8.1 mmol/l Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 1.5 mmol/l KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 4.0 mmol/l MgCl\n2\n) to prepare a suspension of 8×10\n7\n cells/ml. After 200 µl of the cell suspension (1.6×10\n6\n cells) was mixed with 9 µg of the above-described linear plasmid, a full volume of the cell-DNA mixture was transferred into Gene Pulser Cuvette (2 mm in inter-electrode distance, manufactured by BIO-RAD), and gene introduction was carried out using an electroporation device Gene Pulser II (manufactured by BIO-RAD) under conditions of 350 V in pulse voltage and 250 µF in electric capacity. After carrying out the gene introduction, the cell suspension was suspended in 30 ml of IMDM medium (manufactured by Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (manufactured by Life Technologies) and 50 µg/ml of gentamicin (manufactured by Nacalai Tesque) and inoculated at 100 µl/well into 96-well 3 plates for adherent cells (manufactured by Greiner). The culturing was carried out under conditions of 5% CO\n2\n and 37°C.\n\n\n \n4. Obtaining of MTX-resistant cell line\n\n\n \n \n \nThe pKAN-ATIIIN135Q-introduced cells obtained in the above item were cultured for 6 days, and then the culture supernatants were discarded and the IMDM medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 50 µg/ml gentamicin and 50 nM methotrexate (MTX) (manufactured by SIGMA) was dispensed at 100 µl/well. The culturing was continued for 9 days while repeating this medium exchanging work at an interval of 3 to 4 days. Next, the culturing was continued for 18 days while repeating the medium exchanging work using the IMDM medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 50 µg/ml gentamicin and 200 nM MTX at an interval of 3 to 4 days, and the finally formed colonies were inoculated into a 24 well plate (manufactured by SIGMA). Subsequently, the culturing was continued for 19 days while repeating the medium exchanging work using the IMDM medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 50 µg/ml gentamicin and 500 nM MTX at an interval of 3 to 4 days, optionally expanding the process, thereby obtaining transformants resistant to 500 nM MTX.\n\n\n \n5. Selection of cell line highly producing ATIIIN135Q\n\n\n \n \n \nFrom each of the several 500 nm MTX-resistant cell lines obtained in the above item, 1.0×10\n6\n cells were collected, suspended in 5 ml of the IMDM medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 50 µg/ml gentamicin and 500 nM MTX, and then cultured by inoculating into a tissue culture flask (manufactured by Greiner). Three days after the culturing, the culture supernatant was recovered, and the amount of ATIIIN135Q contained in the supernatant was measured using ELISA for antithrombin (ATIII) kit (manufactured by Affinity Biological), to select a highly producing cell line. The method was carried out in accordance with the manual attached to the ELISA kit, and Neuart (manufactured by Mitsubishi Pharma Corporation) was used as the standard preparation.\n\n\n \n6. Naturalization to serum-free medium\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ATIIIN135Q-expressing FUT8 gene-double-knockout cell line prepared in the above item was naturalized to a serum-free medium in the same manner as in Example 4-1. The cell line was suspended in 15 ml of the serum-free medium described in Example 4-1 to give a density of 5 × 10\n5\n cells/ml and inoculated into a 125 ml-conical flask (manufactured by Coming) to carry out batch culturing. The culturing was carried out at 35°C and at a rotation speed of 90 to 100 rpm, and when sub-culturing was carried out, the air in the conical flask was replaced by blowing air containing 5% CO\n2\n onto the medium surface, in a volume of 4-folds or more of the culture vessel volume. The medium was exchanged 3 days thereafter, and subculturing was carried out at an inoculation density of 5×10\n5\n cells/ml on the 6th day. Thereafter, the sub-culturing was repeated at an interval of 3 to 4 days for 2 weeks to neutralize the cells to the serum-free medium. By this culturing, a cell line pKAN-ATIIIN135Q AFMS705 which can grow in the serum-free medium and does not cause aggregation was obtained. The thus obtained cell line was suspended in 15 ml of the serum-free medium to give a density of 3.0×10\n5\n cells/ml and cultured by inoculating into a 125 ml capacity flask. Three days after the culturing, the culture supernatant was recovered, and the amount of recombinant antithrombin III contained in the supernatant was measured using ELISA for antithrombin (ATIII) kit (manufactured by Affinity Biological) to confirm that it was expressed in a concentration of 6 µg/ml in the culture supernatant. In this connection, the cell line pKAN-ATIIIN135Q AFMS705 was deposited as a cell line name pKAN-ATIIIN135Q AFMS705 on August 10, 2004, as FERM BP-10089 in International Patent Organism Depositary, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (\nCentral\n 6, 1-1, Higashi 1-chome, Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki, Japan).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThereafter, a mutation type recombinant antithrombin III having a complex type sugar chain in which fucose is not bound to N-acetylglucosamine in the reducing end was obtained by the method described in Example 4, and it was confirmed that the number of the complex type N-glycoside-linked sugar chains was three. In addition, as a result of measuring biological activities of the antithrombin III by the method described in Example 5, it was confirmed that the heparin dissociation constant is significantly smaller and that the heparin cofactor activity and the thrombin inhibition secondary rate constant are significantly higher, than those of the mutation type recombinant antithrombin III expressed by the CHO/DG44 cell:\n\n\n \nExample 7\n\n\nObtaining of cell line which does not express gene of an enzyme capable of catalyzing dehydrogenation to convert GDP-mannose into GDP-4-keto,6-deoxy-GDP-mannose:\n\n\n1.

USA, 77, 4216 (1980\n)) was cultured in an IMDM-FBS(10)-HT(1) medium [IMDM medium (manufactured by Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (manufactured by Invitrogen) and 1 × concentration of HT supplement (manufactured by Invitrogen)] using a 75 cm\n2\n flask for adherent culture (manufactured by Greiner), and allowed to proliferate until reaching just before the confluent stage. After washing the cells with 5 ml of Dulbecco PBS (hereinafter referred to as PBS) (manufactured by Invitrogen), 1.5 ml of 0.05% trypsin (manufactured by Invitrogen) diluted with PBS was added thereto and the cells were allowed to stand at 37°C for 5 minutes to peal off them from the culture container bottom. The pealed cells were recovered by a centrifugation operation generally carried out in cell culturing and suspended to give a density of 1 × 10\n5\n cells/ml by adding the IMDM-FBS(10)-HT(1) medium, and then 0.1 µg/ml of an alkylation agent, MNNG (manufactured by SIGMA), was added or not added thereto. After allowing the cells to stand at 37°C for 3 days in a CO\n2\n incubator (manufactured by TABAI), the culture supernatant was discarded, and the cells were washed, peeled off, recovered and suspended in the IMDM-FBS(10)-HT(1) medium, in the similar manner as described above, and then inoculated into a 96-well plate for adherent culture (manufactured by Asahi Techno Glass) at a density of 1,000 cells/well. To each well, 1 mg/ml of \nLens culinaris\n agglutinin (hereinafter referred to as LCA, manufactured by Vector) was added as a final concentration in the medium. After culturing at 37°C for 2 weeks in a CO\n2\n incubator, the thus formed colonies were obtained as lectin-resistant CHO/DG44 cell lines.\n\n\n \n2.

Subsequently, single-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 5 µg of each RNA in 20 µl of a reaction mixture using SUPER SCRIPT First-Strand synthesis system for RT-PCR (manufactured by Invitrogen) in accordance with the instructions attached thereto.\n\n\n \n(2) Analysis of expression quantity of β-actin gene using RT-PCR\n\n\n \n \n \nIn order to verify quality of each of the respective cell line-derived single-stranded cDNA samples prepared in the above item (1), amplification of β-actin cDNA by PCR was examined in the following manner.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter 20 µl of a reaction mixture [1 × EX Taq Buffer (manufactured by Takara Shuzo), 0.2 mM of dNTPs, 0.5 unit of EX Taq polymerase (manufactured by Takara Shuzo) and 0.5 µM of the synthetic oligo DNA primers of SEQ ID NOs:32 and 33] containing, as the template, 0.5 µl of each of the respective cell line-derived single-stranded cDNA samples prepared in the above (1) was prepared, the reaction mixture was heated at 94°C for 5 minutes and then 14 cycles of the reaction, one cycle consisting of reaction at 94°C for one minute and reaction at 68°C for 2 minutes, were carried out using DNA Thermal Cycler 480 (manufactured by Perkin Elmer). After 10 µl of the resulting PCR reaction mixture was subjected to agarose electrophoresis, the DNA fragments were stained using Cyber Green (manufactured by BMA), and then the amount of the expected DNA fragment of approximately 800 bp was measured using Fluor Imager SI (manufactured by Molecular Dynamics). As a result, it was able to detect the expression of β-actin at a similar level by using every cell line-derived single-stranded cDNA.\n\n\n \n(3) Analysis of the expressed amount of GDP-\nmannose\n 4,6-dehydratase gene using RT-PCT method\n\n\n \n \n \nNext, the expressed amount of GDP-\nmannose\n 4,6-dehydratase gene in the respective lectin-resistant CHO/DG44 cell lines obtained in the above item (1) was analyzed. In order to amplify cDNA of GDP-\nmannose\n 4,6-dehydratase gene by PCR, a synthetic oligo DNA primer of 26 mer having the nucleotide sequence represented by SEQ ID NO:34 and a synthetic oligo DNA primer of 28 mer having the nucleotide sequence represented by SEQ ID NO:35 were prepared from the cDNA sequence of CHO cell-derived GDP-\nmannose\n 4,6-dehydratase represented by SEQ ID NO:38. Subsequently, 20 µl of a reaction mixture [1 × EX Taq Buffer (manufactured by Takara Shuzo), 0.2 mM of dNTP mixture, 0.5 unit of EX Taq polymerase (manufactured by Takara Shuzo) and 0.5 µM of the synthetic oligo DNA primers of SEQ ID NOs:34 and 35] containing, as the template, 0.5 µl of each of the respective cell line-derived single-stranded cDNA samples prepared in the above item (1) was prepared, the reaction mixture was heated at 94°C for 5 minutes, and then 30 cycles of the reaction, one cycle consisting of reaction at 94°C for one minute and reaction at 68°C for 2 minutes, were carried out by using DNA Thermal Cycler 480 (manufactured by Perkin Elmer). After 10 µl of the resulting PCR reaction mixture was subjected to agarose electrophoresis, the DNA fragments were stained using Cyber Green (manufactured by BMA), and then amount of the expected DNA fragment of approximately 430 bp was measured using Fluor Imager SI (manufactured by Molecular Dynamics). As a result, it was confirmed that a cell line in which expression of GDP-mannose-4,6-dehydratase gene is not observed is present in the obtained lectin-resistant CHO/DG44 cell lines. The cell line in which no expression of GDP-\nmannose\n 4,6-dehydratase gene was observed was named cell line CHO SM. In this connection, when resistance of the thus obtained cell line CHO SM to various species of lectin was examined, the cell line CHO SM showed a resistance also to a lectin which recognizes the same sugar chain structure as the sugar chain structure which is recognized by LCA, namely other lectin which recognizes a sugar chain structure in which 1-position of fucose is bound to 6-position of N-acetylglucosamine residue in the reducing end through α-bond in the N-glycoside-linked sugar chain. Specifically, it showed resistance to a medium supplemented with 1 mg/ml in final concentration of \nPisum sativum\n agglutinin (hereinafter referred to as PSA, manufactured by Vector) or to a medium supplemented with 1 mg/ml in final concentration of \nAleuria aurantia\n lectin (hereinafter referred to as AAL, manufactured by Vector).\n\n\n \n3. Genomic analysis of cell line in which the gene of an enzyme capable of catalyzing dehydrogenation to convert GDP-mannose into GDP-4-keto,6-deoxy-GDP-mannose is not expressed\n\n\n \n \n \nUsing a T75 flask for adherent culture (manufactured by Greiner), each of CHO/DG44 cell and the CHO SM cell line obtained in the above was cultured in IMDM-FBS(10)-HT(1) medium until it reached just before the confluent stage, and then genomic DNA was prepared in accordance with the method described in a literature \n[\n \nNucleic Acid Research, 3, 2303 (1976\n)], and the thus obtained genomic DNA was dissolved overnight in 300 µl of TE-RNase buffer solution (pH 8.0) [10 mmol/l Tris-HCl, 1 mmol/l EDTA, 200 µg/l RNase A]. After 12 µg of the genomic DNA prepared in the above was digested with three different restriction enzymes \nEco\nRI (manufactured by Takara Shuzo), \nHind\nIII (manufactured by Takara Shuzo) and \nBgl\nII (manufactured by Takara Shuzo), respectively, the DNA fragments were recovered using the ethanol precipitation method and then dissolved in 20 µl of TE buffer (pH 8.0) [10 mmol/l Tris-HCl, 1 mmol/l EDTA] and subjected to 0.8% (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis. After the electrophoresis, the genomic DNA fragments were transferred onto a nylon membrane in accordance with the method described in a literature [\nProc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA, 76, 3683 (1979\n)]. After the transfer, heat treatment of the nylon membrane was carried out at 80°C for 2 hours. Next, in order to examine the quality of the genomic DNA transferred onto the nylon membrane, Southern hybridization was carried out using, as the probe, α1,6-fucosyltransferase (FUT8) gene which is considered to be present uniformly in the genome of every cell line. The probe for detecting the FUT8 gene was prepared in the following manner. Firstly, 10 µg of a plasmid mfFUT8-pCR2.1 containing mouse FUT8 cDNA as described in Example 11 of \n \nWO02/31140\n \n, was dissolved in 50 µl of M buffer (manufactured by Takara Shuzo), digested overnight with a restriction enzyme \nHind\nIII (manufactured by Takara Shuzo), and then the reaction mixture was replaced with H buffer (manufactured by Takara Shuzo) and digestion reaction with a restriction enzyme EcoRI (manufactured by Takara Shuzo) was further carried out overnight. After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was subjected to 2% agarose electrophoresis, and an \nEco\nRI-\nHind\nIII fragment of 156 \nbp containing exon\n 2 of FUT8 gene was purified. A 25 ng portion of the thus obtained DNA fragment was radiation-labeled using 1.75 MBq of [α-\n32\nP]dCTP and Megaprime DNA labeling system, dCTP (manufactured by Amersham Bioscience). Next, hybridization was carried out in the following manner. Firstly, the above-described nylon membrane was sealed in a roller bottle, and pre-hybridization was carried out at 65°C for 3 hours by adding 15 ml of a hybridization solution [4 × SSPE, 5 × Denhaldt's solution, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, 0.1 mg/ml sermon sperm DNA]. Next, the \n32\nP-labeled probe DNA was denatured with heat, charged into the bottle and heated overnight at 65°C. After the hybridization, the nylon membrane was soaked in 50 ml of 2 × SSC-0.1% (w/v) SDS and heated at 65°C for 15 minutes. After repeating the above washing step twice, the nylon membrane was soaked in 50 ml of 0.2 × SSC-0.1% (w/v) SDS and heated at 65°C for 15 minutes. After washing, the nylon membrane was exposed to an X-ray film at 80°C two nights for development. After the development, the nylon membrane was boiled in a stripping solution [1% SDS, 0.1 × SSC] to release the probe and again subjected to hybridization with different probe. By the above-described method, a fragment specific to \nexon\n 2 of FUT8 gene was detected in the genomic DNA of each of the cell line CHO/DG44 and cell line CHO SM. Based on the above results, it was shown that the genomic DNA samples transferred onto the nylon membrane, derived from the cell line CHO SM and cell line CHO/DG44, have the identical quality.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOn the other hand, a probe specific to \nexon\n 5 of GMD gene was prepared in the following manner. Firstly, oligo DNA primers (SEQ ID NOs:36 and 37) which specifically bind to the \nexon\n 5 were designed based on a conventionally known human GMD genomic DNA sequence (NCBI accession No. NT-034880). The region corresponds to a region of the nucleotide number 346 to the nucleotide number 538 of the human GMD cDNA sequence represented by SEQ ID NO:39. Next, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out by preparing 100 µl of a reaction mixture [ExTaq buffer (manufactured by Takara Shuzo), 0.2 mmol/l of dNTPs and 2.5 µmol/l of the above-described gene-specific primers (SEQ ID NOs:36 and 37)] containing 10 ng of the plasmid pAGE249GMD described in Example 15 of \n \nWO02/31140\n \n. The PCR was carried out by heating at 94°C for 5 minutes and 30 cycles, one cycle consisting of reaction at 94°C for one minute, reaction at 58°C for 2 minutes and reaction at 72°C for 3 minutes. After the PCR, the reaction mixture was subjected to 2% agarose electrophoresis, and a DNA fragment of approximately 200 bp was purified. Next, 25 ng of the thus obtained DNA fragment was radiation-labeled using 1.75 MBq of [a-\n32\nP]dCTP and Megaprime DNA labeling system, dCTP (manufactured by Amersham Bioscience). Using the probe, hybridization was carried out on the above-described nylon membrane. As a result, a fragment specific to \nexon\n 5 of GMD gene was found in the genomic DNA derived from the CHO/DG44 cell, while a fragment specific to \nexon\n 5 of GMD gene was not detected in the genomic DNA derived from the cell line CHO SM. Based on the above results, it was shown that the cell line CHO SM is a GMD-knockout cell in which at least an exon 5-containing region among the GMD-encoding genomic region was deleted.\n\n\n \nExample 8\n\n\nExpression of recombinant antithrombin III in cell line CHO SM:\n\n\n1. Introduction of ATIII expression plasmid into cell line CHO SM\n\n\n \n \n \nThe plasmid pKAN-ATIII prepared in Example 2-3 was stably introduced into the cell line CHO SM prepared in Example 7. The gene introduction was carried out by the following procedure in accordance with the conventionally known electroporation method [\nCytotechnology, 3, 133 (1990\n)]. Firstly, 30 µg of the plasmid pKAN-ATIII was linearized by preparing 200 µl of a reaction mixture containing 20 µl of NEBuffer 3 (manufactured by New England Biolabs) and 100 units of a restriction enzyme \nMlu\nI (manufactured by New England Biolabs) and digesting at 37°C for 16 hours. After the reaction, the reaction mixture was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction treatment and ethanol precipitation to thereby recover the linear plasmid. Next, the cell line CHO SM obtained in Example 7 was suspended in a K-PBS buffer (137 mmol/l KCI, 2.7 mmol/l NaCl, 8.1 mmol/l Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 1.5 mmol/l KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 4.0 mmol/l MgCl\n2\n) to prepare a suspension of 8×10\n7\n cells/ml. After 200 µl of the cell suspension (16×10\n6\n cells) was mixed with 9 µg of the above-described linear plasmid, a full volume of the cell-DNA mixture was transferred into Gene Pulser Cuvette (2 mm in inter-electrode distance, manufactured by'BIO-RAD), and gene introduction was carried out using an electroporation device Gene Pulser (manufactured by BIO-RAD) under conditions of 350 V in pulse voltage and 250 µF in electric capacity. After carrying out the gene introduction, the cell suspension was suspended in 30 ml of IMDM medium (manufactured by Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (manufactured by Life Technologies) and 50 µg/ml of gentamicin (manufactured by Nacalai Tesque) and inoculated at 100 µl/well into 96-well 3 plates for adherent cells (manufactured by Greiner). The culturing was carried out under conditions of 5% CO\n2\n and 37°C.\n\n\n \n2. Obtaining of MTX-resistant cell line\n\n\n \n \n \nThe pKAN-ATIII-introduced cells obtained in the above were cultured for 6 days, and then the culture supernatants were discarded and the IMDM medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 50 µg/ml gentamicin and 50 nM MTX (manufactured by SIGMA) was dispensed at 100 µl/well. The culturing was continued for 9 days while repeating this medium exchanging work at an interval of 3 to 4 days. Next, the culturing was continued for 18 days while repeating the medium exchanging work using the IMDM medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 50 µg/ml gentamicin and 200 nM MTX at an interval of 3 to 4 days, and the finally formed colonies were inoculated into a 24 well plate (manufactured by SIGMA). Subsequently, the culturing was continued for 19 days while repeating the medium exchanging work using the IMDM medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 50 µg/ml gentamicin and 500 nM MTX at an interval of 3 to 4 days, optionally expanding the process to thereby obtain cell lines resistant to 500 nM MTX.\n\n\n \n3. Selection of cell line highly producing antithrombin III\n\n\n \n \n \nFrom each of the several 500 nm MTX-resistant cell lines obtained in the above item, 1.0 × 10\n6\n cells were collected, suspended in 5 ml of the IMDM medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 50 µg/ml gentamicin and 500 nM MTX, and then cultured by inoculating into a T25 flask. Three days after the culturing, the culture supernatant was recovered, and the amount of ATIII contained in the supernatant was measured using ELISA for antithrombin (ATIII) kit (manufactured by Affinity Biological). As a result, it was confirmed that the recombinant human antithrombin III is expressed in the culture supernatant at a concentration of 513 ng/ml, and this transformant was named cell line pKAN-ATIII1 GMDKO.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThereafter, a recombinant antithrombin III having a sugar chain in which fucose is not bound to N-acetylglucosamine in the reducing end was obtained by the method described in Example 4. In addition, by measuring biological activities of the antithrombin III by the method described in Example 5, it was confirmed that the recombinant antithrombin expressed in the GMD knockout cell has significantly smaller heparin dissociation constant and significantly higher heparin cofactor activity and thrombin inhibition secondary rate constant, than the recombinant antithrombin III expressed in the CHO/DG44 cell.\n\n\n \nExample 9\n\n\nExpression of amino acid-modified recombinant antithrombin III in cell line CHO SM: 1. Introduction of ATIIIN135Q expression plasmid into cell line CHO SM\n\n\n \n \n \nThe plasmid pKAN-ATIIIN135Q prepared in Example 6-2 was introduced into the cell line CHO SM prepared in Example 7. The gene introduction was carried out by the following procedure in accordance with the conventionally known electroporation method [\nCytotechnology, 3, 133 (1990\n)]. Firstly, 30 µg of the plasmid pKAN-ATIIIN135Q was linearized by preparing 200 µl of a reaction mixture containing 20 µl ofNEBuffer 3 (manufactured by New England Biolabs) and 100 unites of a restriction enzyme \nMlu\nI (manufactured by New England Biolabs) and digesting at 37°C for 16 hours. After the reaction, the reaction mixture was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction treatment and ethanol precipitation to thereby recover the linear plasmid. Next, the cell line CHO SM obtained in Example 7 was suspended in a K-PBS buffer (137 mmol/l KCl, 2.7 mmol/l NaCl, 8.1 mmol/l Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 1.5 mmol/l KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 4.0 mmol/l MgCl\n2\n) to prepare a suspension of 8 × 10\n7\n cells/ml. After 200 µl of the cell suspension (1.6 × 10\n6\n cells) was mixed with 9 µg of the above-described linear plasmid, a full volume of the cell-DNA mixture was transferred into Gene Pulser Cuvette (2 mm in inter-electrode distance, manufactured by BIO-RAD), and gene introduction was carried out using an electroporation device Gene Pulser (manufactured by BIO-RAD) under conditions of 350 V in pulse voltage and 250 µF in electric capacity.

Selection of cell line highly producing ATIIIN135Q\n\n\n \n \n \nFrom each of the several 500 nm MTX-resistant cell lines obtained in the above item, 1.0 × 10\n6\n cells were collected, suspended in 5 ml of the IMDM medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 50 µg/ml gentamicin and 500 nM MTX, and then cultured by inoculating into a T25 flask. Three days after the culture supernatant was recovered, and the amount of ATIIIN135Q contained in the supernatant was measured using ELISA for antithrombin (ATIII) kit (manufactured by Affinity Biological), to establish a highly producing cell line. The method was carried out in accordance with the manual attached hereto, and Neuart (manufactured by Mitsubishi Pharma Corporation) was used as the standard preparation.. As a result, it was confirmed that antithrombin III is expressed in the culture supernatant of the thus obtained antithrombin III expressing cell line, at a concentration of 45.4 ng/ml, and this transformant was named cell line pKAN-ATIIIN135Q GMDKO.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThereafter, a mutation type recombinant antithrombin III having a sugar chain in which fucose is not bound to N-acetylglucosamine in the reducing end was obtained by the method described in Example 4, and it was confirmed that the number of the N-linked type sugar chains was three. In addition, by measuring the biological activity of the antithrombin III by the method described in Example 5, it was confirmed that the mutation type recombinant antithrombin III expressed in the GMDKO cell has significantly smaller heparin dissociation constant and significantly higher heparin cofactor activity and thrombin inhibition secondary rate constant, than the mutation type recombinant antithrombin. III expressed in the CHO/DG44 cell.\n\n\n \nExample 10\n\n\nExpression of recombinant antithrombin III in yeast:\n\n\n \n \n \nAlthough many kinds of yeast are known, yeasts belonging to the genus \nPichia\n and the genus \nSaccharomyces\n can be exemplified as typical yeasts frequently used as the hosts for expressing recombinant proteins. In general, it is known that the principal structure of N-linked type sugar chains to be added to the recombinant proteins expressed by these yeasts is a high mannose type sugar chain which has 2 N-acetylglucosamine residues in the core residue of the reducing end, and has 9 to several tens of mannose residues and a few to over 10 mannose 6-phosphate residues in the branched region in the non-reducing end \n(\n \nYeast, 19, 1191 (2002\n)). In addition, a high mannose type sugar chain having such a structure is often called hyper mannose type sugar chain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn Examples described below, firstly described are preparation methods of \nPichia\n strains and \nSaccharomyces\n strains capable of expressing an antithrombin III to which a hybrid type sugar chain, having an intermediate structure of high mannose type sugar chain and complex type sugar chain, is mainly added as the N-linked type sugar chain.\n\n\n \n1. Preparation of a \nPichia\n yeast strain in which genomic PNO 1 enzyme gene is disrupted\n\n\n \n \n \nUsing genomic DNA of a \nPichia\n yeast strain, such as \nPichia pastoris\n strain GTS 115 (manufactured by Invitrogen) as the template, a full sequence of the translation region of PNO 1 (phosphomannosylation of N-linked oligosaccharides 1) gene (GenBank accession number: AB099514) of the \nPichia\n yeast is amplified by PCR. The thus amplified PNO 1 gene sequence of approximately 3,200 bp, after replacing its 5'-terminal half sequence by a yeast-derived orotidine-5'-phosphate decarboxylase (URA 3) gene (GenBank accession number: AF321098), is inserted into a vector such as pCR2.1-TOPO vector (manufactured by Invitrogen) to prepare a plasmid for PNO 1 gene disruption use. Next, 100 µg of this plasmid is linearized by using a restriction enzyme, and then stably introduced into the \nPichia\n yeast such as GTS 115 by the electroporation method described in \nPichia\n Expression Kit (manufactured by Invitrogen). Next, the gene-introduced yeast is cultured at room temperature using uracil-deleted YPD medium (manufactured by Invitrogen), and genomic DNA is extracted from each of the grown colonies. Subsequently, by amplifying the sequence of yeast PNO 1 locus by PCR using this genomic DNA as the template, a yeast clone in which the PNO 1 locus is disrupted by homologous recombination is selected. By the above method, the principal structure of N-linked type sugar chain expressed by the \nPichia\n yeast can be modified into a high mannose type sugar chain which has 2 N-acetylglucosamine residues in the core residue of the reducing end, and has a structure in which 9 to several tens of mannose residues are bound to the non-reducing end.\n\n\n \n2. Preparation of a \nPichia\n yeast strain in which genomic α-1,6-mannosyltransferase gene is disrupted\n\n\n \n \n \nUsing genomic DNA of a \nPichia\n yeast strain, such as \nPichia pastoris\n strain X-33 (manufactured by Invitrogen) as the template, α-1,6-mannosyltransferase (OCH 1) gene (GenBank accession number: AF540063) of the \nPichia\n yeast is amplified by PCR. The thus amplified OCH 1 gene sequence of approximately 2,800 bp, after replacing its 5'-terminal half sequence by a yeast-derived orotidine-5'-phosphate decarboxylase (URA 3) gene (GenBank accession number: AF321098), is inserted into a vector such as pCR2.1-TOPO vector (manufactured by Invitrogen) to prepare a vector for disruption of OCH 1 gene. Next, 100 µg of this vector is linearized by using a restriction enzyme \nSfi\nI (manufactured by New England Biolabs), and then stably introduced into a \nPichia\n strain, such as the PNO 1 gene-disrupted strain described in the above item or \nPichia pastoris\n strain JC308, by the electroporation method described in \nPichia\n Expression Kit (manufactured by Invitrogen). Next, the gene-introduced yeast is cultured at room temperature using uracil-deleted YPD medium (manufactured by Invitrogen), and genomic DNA is extracted from each of the grown colonies. Subsequently, by amplifying the sequence of yeast OCH 1 locus by PCR using this genomic DNA as the template, a yeast clone strain in which the OCH 1 locus is disrupted by homologous recombination is selected. By the above method, the principal structure of N-linked type sugar chain expressed by the \nPichia\n yeast can be modified into a Man8 type high mannose type sugar chain which has 2 N-acetylglucosamine residues in the core part of the reducing end, and has a structure in which 8 mannose residues are bound to the non-reducing end.\n\n\n \n3. Preparation of \nPichia\n yeast strain into which recombinant chimeric α-1,2-mannosidase gene is introduced\n\n\n \n \n \nTotal RNA is extracted from a round worm \n(Caenorhabditis elegans)\n using RNeasy Mini Kit (manufactured by QIAGEN), and then first-strand cDNA is prepared using this RNA as the template and using Superscript™ first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (manufactured by Invitrogen). Next, by carrying out PCR using this cDNA as the template and using specific primers and KOD polymerase (manufactured by Toyobo Co., Ltd.), a cDNA encoding the active domain of round worm α-1,2-mannosidase (GenBank accession number: NM-073594) is specifically amplified. The thus amplified cDNA, after ligating a cDNA sequence encoding the leader peptide of a yeast α-mannosidase (MNS 1) gene (GenBank accession number: M63598) to its 5'-terminal, is inserted into a vector such as expression vector pPICZ for yeast (manufactured by Invitrogen) to thereby prepare a vector for expressing α-1,2-mannosidase in the yeast endoplasmic reticulum. Next, this vector is stably introduced by electroporation into the above-described \nPichia\n yeast strain in which both of the PNO 1 gene and OCH 1 gene are disrupted by homologous recombination. The yeast after the gene introduction is cultured at room temperature using YPD medium (manufactured by Invitrogen) lacking uracil and containing zeosine (manufactured by Invitrogen), and total RNA is extracted from each of the grown colonies Next, a yeast clone strain in which expression of the recombinant chimeric α-1,2-mannosidase is found is selected by PCR using a first-strand cDNA prepared from this total RNA as the template. By the above method, the principal structure of N-linked type sugar chain expressed by the \nPichia\n yeast can be modified into a Man5 type high mannose type sugar chain which has 2 N-acetylglucosamine residues in the core residue of the reducing end, and has a structure in which 5 mannose residues are bound to the non-reducing end.\n\n\n \n4. Preparation of \nPichia\n yeast strain into which a recombinant UDP-N-acetylglucosamine transporter gene is introduced\n\n\n \n \n \nTotal RNA is extracted from a yeast \n(Kluyveromyces lactis)\n using RNeasy Mini Kit (manufactured by QIAGEN), and then cDNA is prepared using this RNA as the template and using Superscript\n™\n first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (manufactured by Invitrogen). Next, by carrying out PCR using this cDNA as the template and using specific primers and KOD polymerase (manufactured by Toyobo Co., Ltd.), a cDNA encoding a full translation region of yeast UDP-N-acetylglucosamine transporter (GenBank accession number: AF106080) is specifically amplified. Next, the thus amplified cDNA of approximately 3,700 bp is inserted between restriction enzymes \nEco\nRI cleavage site and \nNot\nI cleavage site positioned at the downstream of the alcohol oxygenase promoter sequence of a vector such as an expression vector pPIC3.5K for yeast (manufactured by Invitrogen) to thereby prepare a vector which expresses UDP-N-acetylglucosamine transporter in the yeast Golgi body. Next, this vector is stably introduced by electroporation into the α-1,2-mannosidase gene-introduced \nPichia\n yeast strain described in the above item. The yeast after the gene introduction is cultured at room temperature using YPD medium containing an agent G418 (manufactured by Nacalai Tesque), and total RNA is extracted from each of the grown colonies. Thereafter, a yeast clone strain in which expression of recombinant UDP-N-acetylglucosamine transporter is found is selected by PCR using cDNA prepared from this total RNA as the template.\n\n\n \n5. Preparation of \nPichia\n yeast strain into which recombinant chimeric N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-I gene is introduced\n\n\n \n \n \nBy carrying out PCR using a human liver cDNA (manufactured by Clontech) as the template and using specific primers and KOD polymerase (manufactured by Toyobo Co., Ltd.), a cDNA encoding the active domain of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-I (GenBank accession number: M55621) is specifically amplified. The thus amplified cDNA, after ligating a cDNA sequence encoding the leader peptide of a yeast mannosyltransferase (MNN 9) gene (GenBank accession number: L23752) to its 5'-terminal, is inserted between restriction enzymes \nKpn\nI cleavage site and \nXba\nI cleavage site positioned at the downstream of the alcohol dehydrogenase promoter sequence of a vector such as an expression vector pAUR123 for yeast (manufactured by Takara Bio), to thereby prepare a vector which expresses N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-I in the yeast Golgi body. Next, this vector is introduced into the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine transporter gene-introduced \nPichia\n yeast strain described in the above, by the lithium acetate method described in the manual attached to the expression vector pAUR123. The yeast after the gene introduction is cultured at room temperature using YPD medium containing an agent aurobrassidin A (manufactured by Takara Bio), and total RNA is extracted from each of the grown colonies. Next, a yeast clone strain in which expression of the recombinant N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-I is found is selected by PCR using a cDNA prepared from this total RNA as the template. By the above method, the principal structure of N-linked type sugar chain expressed by the \nPichia\n yeast can be modified into a hybrid type sugar chain having a structure in which one N-acetylglucosamine residue is added to the non-reducing end of a Man5 type high mannose type sugar chain which has 2 N-acetylglucosamine residues in the core residue of the reducing end, and has 5 mannose residues bound to the non-reducing end.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, preparation methods of \nPichia\n yeast strains which mainly express a hybrid type sugar chain, namely an intermediate structure of high mannose type sugar chain and complex type sugar chain, as the N-linked type sugar chain have been described. In addition to the above-described \nPichia\n strains, yeasts belonging to the genus \nSaccharomyces\n can be exemplified as the yeast frequently used as the host for expressing recombinant proteins. Preparation methods of a \nSaccharomyces\n yeast strain which mainly expresses a hybrid type sugar chain as the N-linked type sugar chain are described below.\n\n\n \n6. Preparation of \nSaccharomyces\n yeast strain in which α-1,6-mannosyltransferase gene and α-1,3-mannosyltransferase gene on the genome are disrupted\n\n\n \n \n \nIn accordance with the method of \nNakayama et al. (EMBO Journal, 11, 2511 (1992\n)), a yeast clone in which the OCH 1 locus is disrupted by homologous recombination is selected. Haploid cells are induced in accordance with the method of \nSherman et al. (Methods in Enzymology, 194, 21 (1991\n)) from the \nSaccharomyces\n yeast strain in which the OCH 1 gene locus is disrupted, and then mixed with haploid cells of a mutant yeast strain LB1-10B in which the α-1,3-mannosyltransferase (MNN 1) gene is disrupted (University of California), followed by culturing under nitrogen-deficient conditions to form diploid zygotes. Next, the thus obtained zygotes are cultured at room temperature using YPD medium lacking uracil and leucine, and genomic DNA is extracted from each of the grown colonies. Subsequently, a yeast clone strain in which both of the OCH 1 gene locus and MNN 1 gene locus are disrupted is selected by respectively amplifying sequence of the yeast OCH 1 locus (GenBank accession number: AF540063) and sequence of the MNN 1 locus (GenBank accession number: AF540063L23753) through PCR using this genomic DNA as the template. By the above method, the principal structure of N-linked type sugar chain expressed by the \nSaccharomyces\n yeast can be modified into a Man8 type high mannose type sugar chain which has 2 N-acetylglucosamine residues in the core residue of the reducing end, and has a structure in which 8 mannose residues are bound to the non-reducing end.\n\n\n \n7. Preparation of \nSaccharomyces\n yeast strain into which recombinant chimeric α-1,2-mannosidase gene is introduced\n\n\n \n \n \nTotal RNA is extracted from a fungus (\nAspergillus saitoi\n) using RNeasy Mini Kit (manufactured by QIAGEN), and then cDNA is prepared using this RNA as the template and using Superscript™ first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (manufactured by Invitrogen). Next, by carrying out PCR using this cDNA as the template and using specific primers and KOD polymerase (manufactured by Toyobo Co., Ltd.), a cDNA encoding the full translation region of fungal α-1,2-mannosidase (GenBank accession number: D49827) is specifically amplified. After ligating a yeast endoplasmic reticulum-specific signal peptide \n(\n \nFMBO Journal, 7, 913 (1988\n)), namely a cDNA sequence encoding histidine-aspartic acid-glutamic acid-leucine and a translation termination codon, to the 3'-terminal of the thus amplified cDNA of approximately 1,500 bp, from which its translation termination codon have been eliminated, is inserted into a vector such as expression vector pPICZ for yeast (manufactured by Invitrogen) or the like, to thereby prepare a vector for expressing α-1,2-mannosidase in the yeast endoplasmic reticulum. Next, this vector is stably introduced by electroporation into the above-described \nSaccharomyces\n yeast strain in which the α-1,6-mannosyltransferase gene and the α-1,3-mannosyltransferase gene are disrupted. The yeast after the gene introduction is cultured at room temperature using YPD medium (manufactured by Invitrogen) lacking uracil and containing zeosine (manufactured by Invitrogen), and total RNA is extracted from each of the grown colonies. Subsequently, a yeast clone strain in which expression of the recombinant chimeric α-1,2-mannosidase is found is selected by PCR using a cDNA prepared from this total RNA as the template. By the above method, the principal structure of N-linked type sugar chain expressed by the \nSaccharomyces\n yeast can be modified into a Man5 type high mannose type sugar chain which has 2 N-acetylglucosamine residues in the core residue of the reducing end, and has a structure in which 5 mannose residues are bound to the non-reducing end.\n\n\n \n8.

Next, this vector is stably introduced by electroporation into the α-1,2-mannosidase gene-introduced \nSaccharomyces\n strain described in the above item. The yeast after the gene introduction is cultured at room temperature using YPD medium containing an agent G418 (manufactured by Nacalai Tesque), and total RNA is extracted from each of the grown colonies. Thereafter, a yeast clone strain in which expression of recombinant UDP-N-acetylglucosamine transporter is found is selected by PCR using cDNA prepared from this total RNA as the template.\n\n\n \n9. Preparation of \nSaccharomyces\n yeast strain into which recombinant chimeric N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-I gene is introduced\n\n\n \n \n \nBy carrying out PCR using a human liver cDNA (manufactured by Clontech) as the template and using specific primers and KOD polymerase (manufactured by Toyobo Co., Ltd.), a cDNA encoding the active domain of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-I (GenBank accession number: M55621) is specifically amplifies. The thus amplified cDNA, after ligating a cDNA sequence encoding the leader peptide of a yeast mannosyltransferase (MNN 9) gene (GenBank accession number: L23752) to its 5'-terminal, is inserted between restriction enzymes \nKpn\nI cleavage site and \nXba\nI cleavage site positioned at the downstream of the alcohol dehydrogenase promoter sequence of a vector such as an expression vector pAUR123 for yeast (manufactured by Takara Bio), to thereby prepare a vector which expresses N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-I in the yeast Golgi body. Next, this vector is introduced into the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine transporter gene-introduced \nSaccharomyces\n yeast strain described in the above item, by the lithium acetate method described in the manual attached to the expression vector pAUR123.

Next, a yeast clone strain in which expression of the recombinant N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-1 is found is selected by PCR using a cDNA prepared from this total RNA as the template. By the above method, the principal structure of N-linked type sugar chain expressed by the \nSaccharomyces\n yeast can be modified into a hybrid type sugar chain having a structure in which one N-acetylglucosamine residue is added to the non-reducing end of a Man5 type high mannose type sugar chain which has 2 N-acetylglucosamine residues in the core residue of the reducing end, and has 5 mannose residues bound to the non-reducing end.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, preparation methods of \nPichia\n yeast strains or \nSaccharomyces\n yeast strains which mainly express a hybrid type sugar chain in which one N-acetylglucosamine residue is added to the non-reducing end of a Man5 type high mannose type sugar chain, as the N-linked type sugar chain have been described. The preparation methods of a recombinant human antithrombin III mainly having a hybrid type sugar chain as the N-linked type sugar chain are described below.\n\n\n \n10. Preparation of recombinant human antithrombin III expression vector\n\n\n \n \n \nIn accordance with the method of \nYamauchi et al. (Bioscience, Biotechnology and Biochemistry, 56, 600 (1992\n)), a cDNA encoding the full length mature type human antithrombin III is specifically amplified by PCR using a human liver cDNA (manufactured by Clontech) as the template and KOD polymerase (manufactured by Toyobo Co., Ltd.) as the enzyme for amplification. Thereafter, the thus obtained cDNA is inserted between restriction enzymes \nCla\nI cleavage site and \nXba\nI cleavage site positioned at the downstream of the alcohol oxygenase promoter sequence of a vector such as an expression vector pPIC6α for yeast (manufactured by Invitrogen), to thereby prepare a vector pPIC6α/hATIII which expresses and secretes the mature type human antithrombin III.\n\n\n \n11. Preparation of yeast strain into which recombinant human antithrombin III gene is introduced\n\n\n \n \n \nA linearized vector is prepared from 100 µg of the vector pPIC6α/hATIII which expresses and secretes the mature type human antithrombin III described in the above, by digesting inside of the HIS4 gene with a restriction enzyme \nSal\nI (manufactured by New England Biolabs) and subjecting the resulting fragments to phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Next, in accordance with the method of \nMochizuki et al. (Protein Expression and Purification, 23, 55 (2001\n)), this linearized antithrombin III expression vector is introduced by the lithium acetate method into the \nPichia\n yeast strain capable of expressing mainly a hybrid type sugar chain as the N-linked type sugar chain described in the above-described \nitem\n 5 of this Example or the \nSaccharomyces\n yeast strain capable of expressing mainly a hybrid type sugar chain as the N-linked type sugar chain described in the above 9 of this Example. The yeast after the gene introduction is cultured at room temperature using YPD medium (manufactured by Invitrogen) containing an agent blasticidin (manufactured by Invitrogen) to obtain blasticidin-resistant colonies. Next, each of the blasticidin-resistant colonies is inoculated into liquid YPD medium (manufactured by Invitrogen) to carry out batch culturing at 30°C for 24 hours or more. The culture supernatant obtained after the culturing is analyzed using a human plasma-derived antithrombin III medical preparation Neuart (manufactured by Mitsubishi Pharma Corporation) or the like as the standard substance and using Human Antithrombin III ELISA Kit (manufactured by Affinity Biologicals). By this analysis, it is possible to detect the recombinant human antithrombin III contained in culture supernatant and to measure its concentration. This recombinant antithrombin III having a hybrid type sugar chain which does not contain fucose as the N-linked type sugar chain, secreted into the yeast culture supernatant, can be purified by the method described in Example 4. In addition, the sugar chain structure of the purified antithrombin III protein can be analyzed by the method described in Example 4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, it has been described that a recombinant human antithrombin III mainly having a hybrid type sugar chain which does not contain fucose as the N-linked type sugar chain can be prepared by using, as the host, a \nPichia\n yeast strain which mainly expresses a hybrid type sugar chain in which one N-acetylglucosamine residue is added to the non-reducing end of a Man5 type high mannose type sugar chain, as the N-linked type sugar chain, or a \nSaccharomyces\n yeast strain modified in the same manner. Next, methods for preparing yeast strains expressing a recombinant human antithrombin III mainly having a complex type double-strand sugar chain as the N-linked type sugar chain which does not contain fucose, using this yeast strain expressing a recombinant human antithrombin III mainly having a hybrid type sugar chain as the N-linked type sugar chain are described below.\n\n\n \n12.

Description\n\n\n\n\n Melanocortin Receptor-Specific Peptides\n\n\nCROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION\n\n\nThis application claims priority to and the benefit of the filing of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 61/184,929 entitled \"Melanocortin Receptor-Specific Peptides\", filed June 8, 2009, and the specification and claims thereof are incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nField of the Invention (Technical Field):\n\n\nThe present invention relates to melanocortin receptor-specific cyclic peptides which may be used in the treatment of melanocortin receptor-mediated diseases, indications, conditions and syndromes. Description of Related Art:\n\n\nThe following discussion refers to a number of publications by author(s) and year of publication, and that due to recent publication dates certain publications are not to be considered as prior art vis-a-vis the present invention. Discussion of such publications herein is given for more complete background and is not to be construed as an admission that such publications are prior art for patentability determination purposes.\n\n\nA family of melanocortin receptor types and subtypes have been identified, including melanocortin-1 receptors (MC1-R) expressed on normal human melanocytes and melanoma cells, melanocortin-2 receptors (MC2-R) for ACTH (adrenocorticotropin) expressed in cells of the adrenal gland, melanocortin-3 and melanocortin-4 receptors (MC3-R and MC4-R) expressed primarily in cells in the hypothalamus, mid-brain and brainstem, and melanocortin-5 receptors (MC5-R), expressed in a wide distribution of peripheral tissues. MC1-R has been suggested to be associated with hair and skin pigmentation and inflammation, MC2-R is believed to mediate steroidogenesis, MC3-R has been suggested to be associated with energy homeostasis, food intake, and inflammation, MC4-R is believed to control feeding behavior, energy homeostasis, and sexual function (e.g. erectile function), and MC5-R has been suggested to be involved in the exocrine gland system.\n\n\nSignificant work has been done in determining the structure of melanocortin receptors, including both the nucleic acid sequences encoding for the receptors and the amino acid sequences constituting the receptors. MC4-R is a G protein-coupled, 7-transmembrane receptor that is believed to be expressed primarily in the brain. MC4-R inactivation has been shown to result in obesity (Hadley, 1999, Ann N Y Acad Sci, 885:1-\n\n\n21 ). Agouti-related protein (AgRP) is an endogeneous compound that has been suggested to be a MC antagonist or an inverse agonist on MC4-R. The α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH) is believed to be the principle endogenous MC4-R agonist.\n\n\nAlso peripherally located MC4-R receptors have been suggested to be involved in the control of energy homeostasis, and the role of MC4-R signalling in the vagus nerve and its relevance for treatment \n\n of obesity and diabetes is discussed by Gautron et al, The Journal of Comparative Neurology, 518:6-24 (2010).\n\n\nPeptides specific for MC4-R, and secondarily peptides specific for MC3-R, are believed to be useful in regulation of mammalian energy homeostasis, including use as agents for attenuating food intake and body weight gain. MC4-R agonist peptides are believed to be useful for treating sexual dysfunction, including male erectile dysfunction, and for decreasing food intake and body weight gain, such as for treatment of obesity. Such peptides may also be employed for decreasing voluntary ethanol consumption, treatment of drug addictions, and the like. MC4-R agonist peptides, as well as MC3-R agonist peptides, may further be employed for treatment of circulatory shock, ischemia, hemorrhagic shock, inflammatory diseases and related diseases, indications, conditions and syndromes. MC4-R antagonist peptides, by contrast, are believed to be useful for weight gain aid, such as for use in treatment of cachexia, sarcopenia, wasting syndrome or disease, and anorexia. Such peptides may also be employed for treatment of depression and related disorders. (Wikberg et al, Nature Reviews, Drug Discovery, 7, 307, (2008); Adan et al, British J.

Res., 29(6), 949-957 (2005)).\n\n\nMelanocortin receptor-specific cyclic peptides include cyclic α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (\"α-MSH\") analog peptides such as Ac-Nle-cyc/o(-Asp-His-D-Phe-Arg-Trp-Lys)-NH\n2\n (See U.S. Patent Nos. 5,674,839 and 5,576,290) and Ac-Nle-cyc/o(-Asp-His-D-Phe-Arg-Trp-Lys)-OH (See U.S. Patent Nos. 6,579,968 and 6,794,489). These and other melanocortin receptor-specific peptides generally contain the central tetrapeptide sequence of native α-MSH, His\n6\n-Phe\n7\n-Arg\n8\n-Trp\n9\n (SEQ ID NO:1 ), or a mimetic or variation thereof, such as the substitution of D-Phe for Phe\n7\n.

Melanocortin receptor-specific cyclic peptides disclosed in the foregoing are typically cyclized through a lactam bridge formed by the side chains of Asp (aspartic acid) and Lys (lysine), or alternatively through a disulfide bridge formed by the side chains of two Cys (cysteine) or other reactive thiol-containing residues. Notwithstanding the intense scientific and pharmaceutical interest in melanocortin receptor- specific peptides, evidenced by numerous articles in the scientific literature and numerous patent \n\n applications and issued patents, no melanocortin receptor-specific peptide has been approved as a drug for any therapeutic indication. Indeed, there are no reports of any melanocortin receptor-specific peptide for any therapeutic indication having advanced past Phase Il clinical trials. There remains a significant and substantial need for melanocortin receptor-specific peptides for use in pharmaceutical applications. It is against this background that the present invention was made.\n\n\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nIn one aspect, the present invention relates to a cyclic peptide of the structural formula (I):\n\n\nR\n1\n \n\n\n \n\n including all enantiomers, stereoisomers or diastereoisomers thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of any of the foregoing, wherein:\n\n\nR\n1\n is H- or a C\n1\n to C\n7\n acyl group, wherein the C\n1\n to C\n7\n comprises a linear or branched alkyl or a cycloalkyl or both a linear alkyl and a cycloalkyl;\n\n\nR\n2\n is -N(R\n15a\n)(Ri5b), -NH-(CH\n2\n)\nz\n-N(R\n15a\n)(Ri5b), NH-C(=NH)-N(R\n15a\n)(Ri5b), C(=O)- N(R\n15a\n)(Ri5b) or NH-C(=O)-N(R\n15a\n)(R\n15\nb);\n\n\nR\n3\n is -H, -CH\n3\n or -CH\n2\n-, and if it is -CH\n2\n- forms with R\n4\n a ring of the general structure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR\n4\n is -H, -(CH\n2\n)\nZ\n- if R\n3\n is -CH\n2\n-, and if it is -(CH\n2\n)\nZ\n- forms the ring with R\n3\n, provided that if R\n11\n is not H, then the carbon atom to which R\n11\n is bound is -CH-, or R\n4\n is -(CH\n2\n)\nW\n-R\n12\n-(CH\n2\n)\nW\n-R\n13\n, wherein any H in either (CH\n2\n)\nW\n is optionally substituted with -(CH\n2\n)\nW\n-CH\n3\n, but, if R\n1\n is CH\n3\n-(C=O)-, R\n5\n is unsubstituted phenyl, R\n6\n is H, R\n7\n is -(CH\n2\n)\n3\n-NH-C(=NH)-NH\n2\n, R\n8\n is indole, and R\n9\n is C(=O)-OH or C(=O)- NH\n2\n, then excluding:\n\n\n-(CH\n2\n)\n2\n- but only if R\n3\n is -CH\n2\n- and forms an unsubstituted pyrrolidine ring with R\n3\n and R\n10\n is -CH\n2\n-C(=O)-NH-(CH\n2\n)\n4\n, -(CH\n2\n)\n2\n-C(=O)-NH-(CH\n2\n)\n3\n or -(CH\n2\n)\n3\n-NH-C(=O)-(CH\n2\n)\n2\n, \n\n\n but only if R\n10\n is -CH\n2\n-C(=O)-NH-(CH\n2\n)\n4\n, -(CH\n2\n)\n2\n-C(=O)-\n\n\nNH-(CH\n2\n)\n3\n or -(CH\n2\n)\n3\n-NH-C(=O)-(CH\n2\n)\n2\n, and \n\n but only if R\n10\n is -CH\n2\n-C(=O)-NH-(CH\n2\n)\n3\n, -(CH\n2\n)\n2\n-C(=O)-NH- (CHz)\n31\n -CH\n2\n-C(=O)-NH-(CH\n2\n)\n4\n or -(CH\n2\n)\n2\n-C(=O)-NH-(CH\n2\n)\n4\n; R\n5\n is unsubstituted phenyl or naphthyl; R\n6\n is -H, -CH\n3\n or -CH\n2\n-, and if it is -CH\n2\n- forms with R\n7\n a ring of the general structure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR\n7\n is -(CH\n2\n)\nZ\n- if R\n6\n is -CH\n2\n-, and if it is -(CH\n2\n)\nZ\n- forms the ring with R\n6\n,or R\n7\n is -(CH\n2\n)\nW\n-R\n14\n;\n\n\n \n\n optionally substituted with \n■\n' oonnee \\ oorr^ mmoo\nN\nrree\n<\n rriinngg ^^ ssuubbssttSiittuueennrttss^,, are the same or different and independently hydroxyl, halogen, sulfonamide, alkyl, -O-alkyl, aryl, or -O-aryl; R\n9\n is H, -C(=O)-OH, \n\n\n -C(=O)-(CH\n2\n)\nw\n-cycloalkyl or -C(=O)-R\n16\n; \n\n \n\n\n-(CH\n2\n)\nx\n-C(=O)-NH-(CH\n2\n)\ny\n-,\n\n\n-(CH\n2\n)\nx\n-NH-C(=O)-(CH\n2\n)\ny\n-,\n\n\n-(CH\n2\n)\nx\n-C(=O)-(CH\n2\n)\nz\n-C(=O)-(CH\n2\n)\ny\n-,\n\n\n-(CH\n2\n)\nx\n-C(=O)-NH-C(=O)-(CH\n2\n)\ny\n-, or\n\n\n-(CH\n2\n)\nx\n-NH-C(=O)-NH-(CH\n2\n)\ny\n-; R\n11\n is -H or -R\n12\n-(CH\n2\n)w-R\n13\n; R\n12\n is optionally present, and if present is\n\n\n-O-,\n\n\n-S-,\n\n\n-NH-,\n\n\nSi=O)\n2\n-,\n\n\n-S(=O)-,\n\n\n-S(=O)\n2\n-NH-,\n\n\n-NH-S(=O)\n2\n-,\n\n\n-C(=O)-,\n\n\n-C(=O)-O-,\n\n\n-O-C(=O)-,\n\n\n-NH-C(=O)-O-,\n\n\n-O-C(=O)-NH-,\n\n\n-NH-C(=O)-, or\n\n\n-C(=O)-NH-; \n\n R\n13\n is H, -CH\n3\n, -N(R\n15a\n)(Ri5b), -NH-(CH\n2\n)\nz\n-N(R\n15a\n)(Ri5b), -NH-CH(=NH)-N(R\n15a\n)(Ri5b), -NH-CH(=O)-N(R\n15a\n)(Ri5b), -O(R\n15a\n),\n\n\n-(Ri5a)(Ri5b), -S(=O)\n2\n(Ri5a), -C(=O)-O(R\n15a\n),\n\n\n \n\n wherein any ring in R\n13\n is optionally substituted with one or more ring substituents, and when one or more are present, are the same or different and independently hydroxyl, halogen, sulfonamide, alkyl, -O-alkyl, aryl, -O-aryl, C(=O)-OH, or C(=O)-N(R\n15a\n)(R\n15\nb);\n\n\nR\n14\n is H, -N(R\n15a\n)(R\n15\nb), -NH-(CH\n2\n)\nz\n-N(R\n15a\n)(Ri5b), -NH-CH(=NH)-N(R\n15a\n)(Ri5b), -NH-CH(=O)-N(R\n15a\n)(R\n15b\n), -O(R\n15a\n), a linear or branched C\n1\n to C\n17\n alkyl chain, -C(=O)-N(R\n15a\n)(R\n15b\n),\n\n\n \n\n wherein any ring is optionally substituted with one or more optional ring substituents, and when one or more are present, are the same or different and independently hydroxyl, halogen, sulfonamide, alkyl, -O- alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, O-aralkyl, or -O-aryl; independently H or a C\n1\n to C\n4\n linear or branched alkyl chain;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR\n17\n is H, -C(=O)-OH, or -C(=O)-N(R\n15a\n)(R\n15\nb); w is in each instance independent 0 to 5; x is 1 to 5; y is 1 to 5; and z is in each instance independently 1 to 5.\n\n\nIn another aspect there is provided the cyclic peptide of formula (I) wherein R\n10\n is -(CH\n2\n)\nX\n-C(=O)- NH-(CH\n2\n)\ny\n- where x is 4 and y is 3, where x is 3 and y is 2, or where x is 2 and y is 1.

Suitable substituents, in addition to the side chain moiety of the α-amino acid, include C\n1\n to C\n6\n linear or branched alkyl. Aib is an example of an α, α-disubstituted amino acid. While α, α-disubstituted amino acids can be referred to using conventional L- and D-isomeric references, it is to be understood that such references are for convenience, and that where the substituents at the α-position are different, such amino acid can interchangeably be referred to as an α, α-disubstituted amino acid derived from the L- or D-isomer, as appropriate, of a residue with the designated amino acid side chain moiety. Thus (S)- \n\n 2-Aιmino-2-methyl-hexanoic acid can be referred to as either an α, α-disubstituted amino acid derived from L-NIe or as an α, α-disubstituted amino acid derived from D-AIa. Similarly, Aib can be referred to as an α, α-disubstituted amino acid derived from Ala. Whenever an α, α-disubstituted amino acid is provided, it is to be understood as including all (R) and (S) configurations thereof. Whenever a claim or description herein refers to an \"amino acid\", such designation includes, but is not limited to, an \"α, α- disubstituted amino acid.\"\n\n\nAn \"N-substituted amino acid\" means any amino acid wherein an amino acid side chain moiety is covalently bonded to the backbone amino group, including optionally where there are no substituents other than H in the α-carbon position. Sarcosine is an example of an N-substituted amino acid. By way of example, sarcosine can be referred to as an N-substituted amino acid derivative of Ala, in that the amino acid side chain moiety of sarcosine and Ala is the same, methyl. Whenever a claim or description herein refers to an \"amino acid\", such designation includes, but is not limited to, an \"\"N-substituted amino acid.\"\n\n\nThe term \"alkane\" includes linear or branched saturated hydrocarbons. Examples of linear alkane groups include methane, ethane, propane, and the like. Examples of branched or substituted alkane groups include methylbutane or dimethylbutane, methylpentane, dimethylpentane or trimethylpentane, and the like. In general, any alkyl group may be a substitutent of an alkane.\n\n\nThe term \"alkene\" includes unsaturated hydrocarbons that contain one or more double carbon- carbon bonds. Examples of such alkene groups include ethylene, propene, and the like. The term \"alkenyl\" includes a linear monovalent hydrocarbon radical of two to six carbon atoms or a branched monovalent hydrocarbon radical of three to six carbon atoms containing at least one double bond; examples thereof include ethenyl, 2-propenyl, and the like.\n\n\nThe \"alkyl\" groups specified herein include those alkyl radicals of the designated length in either a straight or branched configuration. Examples of such alkyl radicals include methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, sec-butyl, tertiary butyl, pentyl, isopentyl, hexyl, isohexyl, and the like.\n\n\nThe term \"alkyne\" includes a linear monovalent hydrocarbon radical of two to six carbon atoms or a branched monovalent hydrocarbon radical of three to six carbon atoms containing at least one triple bond; examples thereof include ethyne, propyne, butyne, and the like.\n\n\nThe term \"aryl\" includes a monocyclic or bicyclic aromatic hydrocarbon radical of 6 to 12 ring atoms, and optionally substituted independently with one or more substituents selected from alkyl, haloalkyl, cycloalkyl, alkoxy, alkythio, halo, nitro, acyl, cyano, amino, monosubstituted amino, disubstituted amino, hydroxy, carboxy, or alkoxy-carbonyl. Examples of an aryl group include phenyl, biphenyl, naphthyl, 1-naphthyl, and 2-naphthyl, derivatives thereof, and the like.\n\n\nThe term \"aralkyl\" includes a radical - R\na\nR\nb\n where R\na\n is an alkylene (a bivalent alkyl) group and R\nb\n is an aryl group as defined above. Examples of aralkyl groups include benzyl, phenylethyl, 3-(3- chlorophenyl)-2-methylpentyl, and the like.\n\n\nThe term \"aliphatic\" includes compounds with hydrocarbon chains, such as for example alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, and derivatives thereof.\n\n\nThe term \"acyl\" includes a group R(C=O)-, where R is an organic group, such as an alkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, carbocyclyl or heterocyclyl. Thus, when reference is made herein to a substituted acyl group, \n\n it means that said organic group (R) is substituted. The acetyl group CH\n3\n-C(=O)-, referred to herein as \"Ac\", is non-limiting example of an acyl.\n\n\nA peptide or aliphatic moiety is \"acylated\" when an alkyl or substituted alkyl group as defined above is bonded through one or more carbonyl {-(C=O)-} groups. A peptide is most usually acylated at the N-terminus.\n\n\nAn \"omega amino aliphatic chain\" includes an aliphatic moiety with a terminal amino group. Examples of omega amino aliphatic chains include aminoheptanoyl and the amino acid side chain moieties of ornithine and lysine.\n\n\nThe term \"heteroaryl\" includes mono- and bicyclic aromatic rings containing from 1 to 4 heteroatoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur. 5- or 6-membered heteroaryl are monocyclic heteroaromatic rings; examples thereof include thiazole, oxazole, thiophene, furan, pyrrole, imidazole, isoxazole, pyrazole, triazole, thiadiazole, tetrazole, oxadiazole, pyridine, pyridazine, pyrimidine, pyrazine, and the like.

When reference is made herein to a substituted amide group, it means that at least one of said organic groups (R\nc\n and R\nd\n) is substituted. Examples of amides include methylamide, ethylamide, propylamide, and the like.\n\n\nAn \"amine\" includes an amino group (-NH\n2\n), -NHR\n3\n and -NR\na\nR\nb\n, wherein each of R\na\n and R\nb\n independently represents an organic group. When reference is made herein to a substituted amine group, it means that at least one of the organic groups (R\na\n and R\nb\n) is substituted.\n\n\nAn \"imide\" includes compounds containing an imido group (-C(=O)-NH-C(=O)-). A \"nitrile\" includes compounds that contain a (-CN) group bound to an organic group.\n\n\nThe term \"halogen\" is intended to include the halogen atoms fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine, and groups including one or more halogen atoms, such as -CF\n3\n and the like.\n\n\nThe term \"composition\", as in pharmaceutical composition, is intended to encompass a product comprising the active ingredient(s), and the inert ingredient(s) that make up the carrier, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination, complexation or aggregation of any two or more of the ingredients, or from dissociation of one or more of the ingredients, or from other types of reactions or interactions of one or more of the ingredients. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions utilized in the present invention encompass any composition made by admixing an active ingredient and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. By a melanocortin receptor \"agonist\" is meant an endogenous substance, drug substance or compound, including a compound such as the peptides of the present invention, which can interact with a melanocortin receptor and initiate a pharmacological response, including but not limited to adenyl cyclase activation, characteristic of the melanocortin receptor. For the present invention, a melanocortin receptor agonist which is an agonist at melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4-R) is preferred, but for certain applications, a melanocortin receptor agonist which is an agonist at both MC4-R and melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1-R) is preferred, and for other applications a melanocortin receptor agonist which is an agonist at one or \n\n more of MC 1 -R, melanocortin-3 receptor (MC3-R), MC4-R and melanocortin-5 receptor (MC5-R) is preferred.\n\n\nBy \"α-MSH\" is meant the peptide Ac-Ser-Tyr-Ser-Met-Glu-His-Phe-Arg-Trp-Gly-Lys-Pro-Val-NH\n2\n (SEQ ID NO:2) and analogs and homologs thereof, including without limitation NDP-α-MSH. By \"NDP-α-MSH\" is meant the peptide Ac-Ser-Tyr-Ser-Nle-Glu-His-D-Phe-Arg-Trp-Gly-Lys-Pro-\n\n\nVaI-NH\n2\n and analogs and homologs thereof.\n\n\nBy \"EC\n50\n\" is meant the molar concentration of an agonist, including a partial agonist, which produced 50% of the maximum possible response for that agonist. By way of example, a test compound which, at a concentration of 72 nM, produces 50% of the maximum possible response for that compound as determined in a cAMP assay in an MC4-R cell expression system has an EC\n50\n of 72 nM. Unless otherwise specified, the molar concentration associated with an EC\n50\n determination is in nanomoles per liter (nM).\n\n\nBy \"Ki (nM)\" is meant the equilibrium inhibitor dissociation constant representing the molar concentration of a competing compound that binds to half the binding sites of a receptor at equilibrium in the absence of radioligand or other competitors. In general, the numeric value of the Ki is inversely correlated to the affinity of the compound for the receptor, such that if the Ki is low, the affinity is high. Ki may be determined using the equation of Cheng and Prusoff (Cheng Y., Prusoff W. H., Biochem. Pharmacol. 22: 3099-3108, 1973): \n\n\n where \"ligand\" is the concentration of radioligand and K\nD\n is an inverse measure of receptor affinity for the radioligand which produces 50% receptor occupancy by the radioligand. Unless otherwise specified, the molar concentration associated with a Ki determination is in nM. Ki may be expressed in terms of specific receptors (e.g., MC1-R, MC3-R, MC4-R or MC5-R) and specific ligands (e.g., α-MSH or NDP-α- MSH). By \"inhibition\" is meant the percent attenuation, or decrease in receptor binding, in a competitive inhibition assay compared to a known standard. Thus, by \"inhibition at 1 μM (NDP-α-MSH)\" is meant the percent decrease in binding of NDP-α-MSH by addition of a determined amount of the compound to be tested, such as 1 μM of a test compound, such as under the assay conditions hereafter described. By way of example, a test compound that does not inhibit binding of NDP-α-MSH has a 0% inhibition, and a test compound that completely inhibits binding of NDP-α-MSH has a 100% inhibition. Typically, as described hereafter, a radio assay is used for competitive inhibition testing, such as with I\n125\n-labeled NDP-α-MSH, or a lanthanide chelate fluorescent assay, such as with Eu-NDP-α-MSH. However, other methods of testing competitive inhibition are known, including use of label or tag systems other than radioisotopes, and in general any method known in the art for testing competitive inhibition may be employed in this invention. It may thus be seen that \"inhibition\" is one measure to determine whether a test compound attenuates binding of α-MSH to melanocortin receptors.\n\n\nBy \"binding affinity\" is meant the ability of a compound or drug to bind to its biological target, expressed herein as Ki (nM). \n\n By \"intrinsic activity\" is meant the maximal functional activity achievable by a compound in a specified melanocortin receptor expressing cell system, such as the maximal stimulation of adenylyl cyclase. The maximal stimulation achieved by α-MSH or NDP-α-MSH is designated as an intrinsic activity of 1.0 (or 100%) and a compound capable of stimulating half the maximal activity that of α-MSH or NDP-α-MSH is designated as having an intrinsic activity of 0.5 (or 50%). A compound of this invention that under assay conditions described herein has an intrinsic activity of 0.7 (70%) or higher is classified as an agonist, a compound with intrinsic activity between 0.1 (10%) and 0.7 (70%) is classified as a partial agonist, and a compound with intrinsic activity below 0.1 (10%) is classified as inactive or having no intrinsic activity. In one aspect, the cyclic peptides of the present invention may generally be characterized as a partial agonist at MC4-R with respect to α-MSH or NDP-α-MSH.\n\n\nIn general, \"functional activity\" is a measure of the signaling of a receptor, or measure of a change in receptor-associated signaling , such as a melanocortin receptor, and in particular MC4-R or hMC4-R, upon activation by a compound. Melanocortin receptors initiate signal transduction through activation of heterotrimeric G proteins. In one aspect, melanocortin receptors signal through Ga\n3\n, which catalyzes production of cAMP by adenylyl cyclase. Thus determination of stimulation of adenylyl cyclase, such as determination of maximal stimulation of adenylyl cyclase, is one measure of functional activity, and is the primary measure exemplified herein. However, it is to be understood that alternative measures of functional activity may be employed in the practice of this invention, and are specifically contemplated and included within the scope of this invention. Thus, in one example intracellular free calcium may be measured, such as reported by and using the methods disclosed in Mountjoy K. G. et al., Melanocortin receptor-medicated mobilization of intracellular free calcium in HEK293 cells. Physiol Genomics 5:11-19, 2001 , or Kassack M. U. et al., Functional screening of G protein-coupled receptors by measuring intracellular calcium with a fluorescence microplate reader. Biomol Screening 7:233-246, 2002. It is also possible to measure activation by measurement of the production of inositol triphosphate or diacylglycerol from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate, such as by use of radioassays. Yet another measure of functional activity is receptor internalization, resulting from activation of regulatory pathways, such as using the methods disclosed in Nickolls S.A. et al., Functional selectivity of melanocortin 4 receptor peptide and nonpeptide agonists: evidence for ligand specific conformational states. J Pharm Exper Therapeutics 313:1281-1288, 2005. Yet another measure of functional activity is the exchange, and exchange rate, of nucleotides associated with activation of a G protein receptor, such as the exchange of GDP (guanosine diphosphate) for GTP (guanosine triphosphase) on the G protein α subunit, which may be measured by any number of means, including a radioassay using guanosine 5'-(γ- [\n35\nS]thio)-triphosphate, as disclosed in Manning D. R., Measures of efficacy using G proteins as endpoints: differential engagement of G proteins through single receptors. MoI Pharmacol 62:451-452, 2002. Various gene-based assays have been developed for measuring activation of G-coupled proteins, such as those disclosed in Chen W. et al., A colorimetric assay from measuring activation of Gs- and Gq- coupled signaling pathways. Anal Biochem 226:349-354, 1995; Kent T.C. et al., Development of a generic dual-reporter gene assay for screening G-protein-coupled receptors. Biomol Screening, 5:437- 446, 2005; or Kotarsky K. et al., Improved receptor gene assays used to identify ligands acting on orphan seven-transmembrane receptors. Pharmacology & Toxicology 93:249-258, 2003. The colorimetric assay of Chen et al. has been adapted for use in measuring melanocortin receptor activation, as \n\n disclosed in Hruby V.J. et al., Cyclic lactam α-melanocortin analogues of Ac-Nle\n4\n-cyclo[Asp\n5\n,D- Phe\n7\n,Lys\n101\n α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone-(4-10)-NH\n2\n with bulky aromatic amino acids at position 7 shows high antagonist potency and selectivity at specific melanocortin receptors. J Med Chem 38:3454- 3461 , 1995.

The term is not limited to physiological conditions, and includes psychogenic conditions \n\n or perceived impairment without a formal diagnosis of pathology or disorder. Sexual dysfunction includes erectile dysfunction in a male mammal and female sexual dysfunction in a female mammal.\n\n\n\"Erectile dysfunction\" is a disorder involving the failure of a male mammal to achieve functional erection, ejaculation, or both. Erectile dysfunction is accordingly synonymous with impotence, and includes the inability to attain or sustain an erection of sufficient rigidity for coitus. Symptoms of erectile dysfunction include an inability to achieve or maintain an erection, ejaculatory failure, premature ejaculation, or inability to achieve an orgasm. An increase in erectile dysfunction is often associated with age or may be caused by a physical disease or as a side-effect of drug treatment.\n\n\n\"Female sexual dysfunction\" is a disorder including sexual arousal disorder. The term \"sexual arousal disorder\" includes a persistent or recurrent failure to attain or maintain the lubrication-swelling response of sexual excitement until completion of sexual activity. Sexual dysfunction in females can also include inhibited orgasm and dyspareunia, which is painful or difficult coitus. Female sexual dysfunction includes, but is not limited to, a number of categories of diseases, conditions and disorders including hypoactive sexual desire disorder, sexual anhedonia, sexual arousal disorder, dyspareunia and vaginismus. Hypoactive sexual desire disorder includes a disorder in which sexual fantasies and desire for sexual activity are persistently or recurrently diminished or absent, causing marked distress or interpersonal difficulties. Hypoactive sexual desire disorder can be caused by boredom or unhappiness in a long-standing relationship, depression, dependence on alcohol or psychoactive drugs, side effects from prescription drugs, or hormonal deficiencies. Sexual anhedonia includes decreased or absent pleasure in sexual activity. Sexual anhedonia can be caused by depression, drugs, or interpersonal factors. Sexual arousal disorder can be caused by reduced estrogen, illness, or treatment with diuretics, antihistamines, antidepressants, or antihypertensive agents. Dyspareunia and vaginismus are sexual pain disorders characterized by pain resulting from penetration and may be caused, for example, by medications which reduce lubrication, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, inflammatory bowel disease or urinary tract problems.\n\n\nBy \"circulatory shock\" is meant the general medical condition in which organs and/or tissues of the body of the subject, which subject may be human or animal, are not receiving an adequate flow of blood. Circulatory shock includes conditions such as hypovolemic shock, cardiogenic shock, vasodilatory shock and the like. These conditions or dysfunctions in circulation can in turn have different causes, such as bacterial blood infection (septic shock or infectious), severe allergic reaction (anaphylactic shock), trauma (traumatic shock), severe bleeding or loss of blood (hemorrhagic shock), neurologic dysfunction causing abnormal opening of blood vessels (neurogenic shock) or endocrine related (endocrine shock). Circulatory shock can further result in ischemia and ischemic damage to bodily organs, tissues, cells or parts. Upon reperfusion, or restoration of blood flow, ischemia-reperfusion injury can occur, also resulting in damage to bodily organs, tissues, or cells.\n\n\nBy \"inflammatory disease,\" also sometimes called an \"inflammatory condition,\" is meant a disease or condition characterized in part by inflammatory mechanisms, such as specific T lymphocyte reactions or antibody-antigen interactions causing the recruitment of inflammatory cells and endogenous mediator chemicals, including but not limited to cytokines, which mediator chemicals include but are not limited to one or more of increased NF-κB activity, increased TNF-α production, increased IL-1 production and increased IL-6 production. \n\n By \"Stage I shock,\" also sometimes called \"compensated shock\" or \"non-progressive shock,\" is meant a condition which occurs when the body detects decreased blood flow or perfusion and begins to activate one or more of several reactive mechanisms to restore perfusion or direct blood flow to the most vital body organs. Stage I shock can be asymptomatic, but may also include, but is not limited to, symptoms such as low blood flow or perfusion, rapid or increased heart rate, shallow or irregular breathing, hypotension, hypertension, pallor and cyanosis.\n\n\nBy \"Stage Il shock,\" also sometimes called \"decompensated shock\" or \"progressive shock,\" is mean a condition which occurs when the compensatory mechanisms of the body begin to fail and organ perfusion cannot be restored to normal or maintained. Symptoms of Stage Il shock include, but are not limited to, confusion, anxiety, disorientation and other mental disturbances indicating a lack of oxygen to the brain, chest pains, increased heart rate, oliguria, multiple organ dysfunction, falling blood pressure (hypotension), rapid breathing, weakness and pupil dilation.\n\n\nBy \"Stage III shock,\" also sometimes called \"irreversible shock,\" is meant a condition which occurs after the state of decreased perfusion or blood flow has existed to such an extent that the organs and tissues of the body are permanently affected. Such symptoms include, but are not limited to, multiple organ failure, kidney failure, coma, blood pooling in the extremities and death.\n\n\n2.0 Clinical Indications and Utility.\n\n\nThe compositions and methods disclosed herein can be used for both medical applications and animal husbandry or veterinary applications. Typically, the methods are used in humans, but may also be used in other mammals. The term \"patient\" is intended to denote a mammalian individual, and is so used throughout the specification and in the claims. The primary applications of the present invention involve human patients, but the present invention may be applied to laboratory, farm, zoo, wildlife, pet, sport or other animals. Clinical indications and specific utilities include the following:\n\n\n2.1 Obesity and Related Metabolic Syndrome. Peptides of formula (I) and (II), have been found to be ligands of the MC4 receptor. Such peptides are believed to be useful in treating diseases, disorders and/or conditions responsive to modulation of the MC4-R function, more particularly activation of the MC4-R, i.e. diseases, disorders and/or conditions which would benefit from agonism (including full or partial agonism) at the MC4-R, including energy homeostasis and metabolism related (such as diabetes, in particular type 2 diabetes; dyslipidemia; fatty liver; hypercholesterolemia; hypertriglyceridemia; hyperuricacidemia; impaired glucose tolerance; impaired fasting glucos; insulin resistance syndrome; and metabolic syndrome), food intake related (such as hyperphagia; binge eating; bulimia; and compulsive eating) and/or energy balance and body weight related diseases, disorders and/or conditions, more particularly such diseases, disorders and conditions characterized by excess body weight and/or excess food intake. Such peptides are particularly believed to be useful for treatment of body weight related diseases, disorders and/or conditions characterized by excess body weight, including obesity and overweight (by promotion of weight loss, maintenance of weight loss, and/or prevention of weight gain, including medication-induced weight gain or weight gain subsequent to cessation of smoking), and diseases, disorders and/or conditions associated with obesity and/or overweight, such as insulin resistance; impaired glucose tolerance; type 2 diabetes; metabolic syndrome; dyslipidemia (including hyperlipidemia); hypertension; heart disorders (e.g. coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction); \n\n cardiovascular disorders; non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis); joint disorders (including secondary osteoarthritis); gastroesophageal reflux; sleep apnea; atherosclerosis; stroke; macro and micro vascular diseases; steatosis (e.g. in the liver); gall stones; and gallbladder disorders. It will be understood that there are medically accepted definitions of obesity and overweight. A patient may be identified by, for example, measuring body mass index (BMI), which is calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by height in meters squared, and comparing the result with the definitions. The recommended classifications for BMI in humans, adopted by the Expert Panel on the Identification, Evaluation and Treatment of Overweight and Obesity in Adults, and endorsed by leading organizations of health professionals, are as follows: underweight < 18.5 kg/m\n2\n, normal weight 18.5-24.9 kg/m\n2\n, overweight 25-29.9 kg/m\n2\n, obesity (class 1 ) 30-34.9 kg/m\n2\n, obesity (class 2) 35-39.9 kg/m\n2\n, extreme obesity (class 3) > 40 kg/m\n2\n (Practical Guide to the Identification, Evaluation, and Treatment of Overweight and Obesity in Adults, The North American Association for the Study of Obesity (NAASO) and the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) 2000). Modifications of this classification may be used for specific ethnic groups. Another alternative for assessing overweight and obesity is by measuring waist circumference. There are several proposed classifications and differences in the cutoffs based on ethnic group. For instance, according to the classification from the International Diabetes Federation, men having waist circumferences above 94 cm (cut off for europids) and women having waist circumferences above 80 cm (cut off for europids) are at higher risk of diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases because of excess abdominal fat. Another classification is based on the recommendation from the Adult Treatment Panel III where the recommended cut-offs are 102 cm for men and 88 cm for women. However, the peptides of Formula I may also be used for reduction of self-diagnosed overweight and for decreasing the risk of becoming obese due to life style, genetic considerations, heredity and/or other factors. 2.2 Sexual Dysfunction.\n\n\nPeptides, compositions and methods of the present invention may be employed for the treatment of sexual dysfunction, including both male erectile dysfunction and female sexual dysfunction. In one particular embodiment, the peptides, compositions and methods of the present invention are used in male patients to increase erectile function, including but not limiting to increasing erectile function so as to permit vaginal intercourse. In another particular embodiment, the peptides, compositions and methods of the present invention are used to treat female sexual dysfunction, including but not limited to an increase in arousal success rate, desire success rate, levels of arousal and desire. For female sexual dysfunction, endpoints may, but need not, be determined by any of a number of validated instruments, including but not limited to the Female Sexual Distress Scale, Female Sexual Encounter Profile, Female Sexual Function Index, and Global Assessment Questionnaire. Patients treated for female sexual dysfunction may be premenopausal women or postmenopausal women.\n\n\n2.3 Circulatory Shock and Related Diseases, Indications, Conditions and Syndromes. Peptides, compositions and methods of the present invention may be employed for the treatment of circulatory shock in a subject. The compositions and methods provided herein may be employed to treat Stage I shock, Stage Il shock or Stage III shock. In one particular embodiment, the methods of the present invention are used to treat the initial stage of shock, which initial stage of shock is characterized \n\n by cardiac output insufficient to meet the body's metabolic needs, but not otherwise low enough to produce significant symptoms. The patient may be anxious and alert, with increased respiration.\n\n\nThe invention provides compositions for use and methods of treating or preventing hemorrhagic shock in a patient, which include administering a composition including one or more of the peptides of the present invention to a patient diagnosed as suffering from blood loss. The blood loss may, but need not, be measured as a percentage of the subject's blood volume, such as, for example, a blood loss of greater than about 15% total blood volume, or greater than 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, or 50% of the subject's total volume. Alternatively, the blood loss may, but need not, be measured in terms of a drop in blood volume in any amount sufficient to cause hemorrhagic shock in a particular subject, such as, for example, a loss of about 750 ml_, 1000 ml_, of about 1500 ml_, or of about 2000 ml_ or more in a human subject. The blood loss may also be measured in terms of a drop in systolic blood pressure, such as, for example, a drop in systolic blood pressure that is about 20 mm Hg, 30 mm Hg, 40 mm Hg, 50 mm Hg, 60 mm Hg, 70 mm Hg, 80 mm Hg, 90 mm Hg or 100 mm Hg or more than 100 mm Hg lower than the subject's normal systolic blood pressure. In particular embodiments, the subject is undergoing or has undergone a medical procedure, such as, but not limited to, surgery, a transfusion or child birth. In other particular embodiments, the subject has suffered a traumatic injury, such as, but not limited to, resulting from a motor vehicle accident, from an industrial injury, or from a gunshot wound.\n\n\nIn additional embodiments of the present invention, the compositions and methods are used to treat cardiogenic shock, hypovolemic shock and vasodilatory shock, each of which can be in any of the aforementioned stages of shock. In one particular embodiment of the present invention, the methods are used to treat cardiogenic shock. Cardiogenic shock is, generally speaking, low blood flow or perfusion that is caused by heart malfunction where the heart does not pump adequate blood. Causes can include any condition that interferes with ventricular filling or emptying, such as, but not limited to, embolism, ischemia, regurgitation and valve malfunction. In another particular embodiment of the present invention, the methods are used to treat vasodilatory shock. Vasodilatory shock is caused by severe venous or arteriolar dilation, which results in inadequate blood flow. Several known causes contribute to vasodilatory shock including, but not limited to, cerebral trauma, drug or poison toxicity, anaphylaxis, liver failure, bacteremia and sepsis. In another more particular embodiment of the present invention, the methods are used to treat shock resulting from sepsis or bacteremia. In an even more particular embodiment, the compositions and methods are used to treat septic shock or bacteremic shock in Stage I, Il or III. In yet another embodiment, the compositions and methods of the present invention are used to treat hypovolemic shock. Hypovolemic shock is, generally speaking, decreased intravascular volume, which decrease in intravascular volume can be relative or absolute. Hemorrhage from conditions such as, but not limited to, ulcers, gastrointestinal injury, trauma, accidents, surgery, and aneurysm may cause hypovolemic shock; but loss of other body fluids may also cause hypovolemic shock. For instance, renal fluid loss, intravascular fluid loss, water or other peritoneal fluid loss may contribute to hypovolemic shock. In one particular embodiment of the present invention, the compositions and methods, including administration of one or more of the peptides of the present invention, are used to treat hypovolemic shock. In an even more particular embodiment, the compositions and methods are used to treat hypovolemic shock in Stage I, Stage Il or Stage III. \n\n Circulatory shock, including hemorrhagic shock, may also result from partially controlled or uncontrolled bleeding within one or more internal organs or vessels of a patient. Bleeding may result from any cause, including by way of example from a ruptured aneurysm, dissected aorta, an ulcer, trauma or other gastrointestinal bleeding. In some instances the patient exhibits signs of circulatory shock or hypovolemia, which may include hypotension, but the source of internal bleeding is unknown. In one embodiment, the invention is directed to methods of using one or more of the peptides of the present invention to protect the heart, brain or other organs of a patient against injury caused by circulatory shock. The protective effect against circulatory shock occurs instantaneously or within a short time period following administration of a composition comprising one or more of the peptides of the present invention, preferably within at least about 40 minutes following administration, more preferably within 1-20 minutes, more preferably within 1-15 minutes, and most preferably within about 1-10 minutes. 2.4 Ischemia and Related Diseases, Indications, Conditions and Syndromes. Ischemia refers to any decrease or stoppage in the blood supply to any bodily organ, tissue, cell, or part, particularly where that decrease or stoppage leads to or would likely lead to ischemic damage to the bodily organ, tissue, cell, or part. An \"ischemic episode\" refers to any transient or permanent period of ischemia. Ischemia may result from any constriction or obstruction of the vasculature, or may result from circulatory shock, such as hemorrhagic shock, hypovolemic shock, or the like. The decrease or lack of blood flow results in a decrease or lack of oxygen to the affected part of the body, and may also result in an increase of inflammatory disease mediator chemicals such as various cytokines and other substances. During certain surgical procedures such as cardiac surgery and organ transplantation, the flow of blood is stopped temporarily and then resumed (reperfusion), resulting in ischemia-reperfusion injury. During a heart attack, the blood that supplies the heart is stopped, also resulting in ischemia that can evolve into infarction. Current treatment to relieve heart attacks requires reperfusion of the ischemic area of the heart, such as by using thrombolytic drugs or coronary angioplasty. The invention has particular application in prevention of injury due to renal ischemia, including lung injury secondary to renal ischemia, preventing or limiting ischemic heart injuries subsequent to a myocardial infarction, preventing or limiting ischemic brain injuries subsequent to a cardiovascular injury, including without limitation myocardial infarction, stroke or the like. Neuroprotection is provided by administration of a composition of the invention to a patient with cerebral ischemia or stroke, particularly patients who are concurrently hypotensive. The invention has further particular application in preventing or limiting ischemic organ damage in organ transplant, including transplant of the heart, kidney, liver, lungs, pancreas or small intestine. In one aspect, the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may be utilized for perfusion of a transplant organ, which perfusion may be prior to, during or subsequent to transplant of the organ. In one embodiment, the invention is directed to methods of using one or more of the peptides of the present invention to protect the heart, brain or other organs of a patient against injury caused by ischemia. The protective effect against ischemia occurs instantaneously or within a short time period following administration of a composition comprising one or more of the peptides of the present invention, preferably within at least about 40 minutes following administration, more preferably within 1-20 minutes, more preferably within 1-15 minutes, and most preferably within about 1-10 minutes. \n\n Ischemia may also results from any of a variety of diseases or conditions, and in one embodiment the invention is directed to methods of using one or more of the peptides of the present invention to protect the organs of a patient against injury resulting from ischemia, which ischemia is caused by a disease or condition. Such disease or condition may include, by way of example and not limitation, atherosclerotic diseases such as atheromata with thrombosis, embolism from the heart or from blood vessel from any organ, vasospasm, hypotension due to heart disease, hypotension due to systemic disease including infection or allergic reactions, or hypotension resulting from administration, ingestion or other exposure to one or more toxic compounds or drugs. Ischemia may also be secondary ischemia, and in another embodiment the invention is directed to methods of using one or more of the peptides of the present invention to protect the organs of a patient against injury resulting from secondary ischemia. Such secondary ischemia may be secondary to a disease or condition such diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hyperlipoproteinemia, dyslipidemia Buerger's disease, also called thromboangiitis obliterans, Takayasu's arteritis, arteritis temporalis, Kawasaki disease, also called lymph node syndrome, mucocutaneous node disease, infantile polyarteritis, cardiovascular syphilis, and various connective tissue diseases and disorders.\n\n\n2.5 Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury and Related Diseases, Indications, Conditions and Syndromes.\n\n\nIschemia-reperfusion is the interruption of blood flow to bodily tissue and the subsequent and often abrupt restoration of blood flow to the tissue. While restoration of blood flow following ischemia is essential to preserve functional tissue, the reperfusion itself is known to be harmful to the tissue. Both ischemia and reperfusion are known to be important contributors to tissue necrosis. Several mechanisms appear to play a causative role in the generation of tissue damage associated with ischemia-reperfusion injury.\n\n\nVarious methods of limiting reperfusion injury have been described, such as induced hypothermia, controlled reperfusion, and ischemic preconditioning. Induced hypothermia is the induction of moderate hypothermia, thought to suppress many of the chemical reactions associated with reperfusion injury. Controlled reperfusion refers to controlling the initial period of reperfusion by reperfusing the tissue at a low pressure using blood that has been modified to be hyperosmolar, alkalotic, and substrate-enriched. Ischemic preconditioning is the purposeful causing of short ischemic events to have protective effect by slowing cell metabolism during a longer ischemic event. Although these treatments may be useful in surgical settings (e.g., before or after planned heart surgery), they are not possible in emergency settings.\n\n\nThe invention has particular application in preventing or limiting the severity of renal reperfusion injury, including lung injury secondary to renal reperfusion, preventing or limiting reperfusion heart injuries subsequent to a myocardial infarction, preventing or limiting reperfusion brain injuries subsequent to a cardiovascular injury, including without limitation myocardial infarction, stroke or the like. The invention has further particular application in preventing or limiting reperfusion organ damage in organ transplant, including transplant of the heart, kidney, liver, lungs, pancreas or small intestine. In one aspect, the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may be utilized for perfusion of a transplant organ, which perfusion may be prior to, during or subsequent to transplant of the organ. \n\n In one embodiment, the invention is directed to methods of using one or more of the peptides of the present invention to protect the heart, brain or other organs of a patient against injury caused by ischemia-reperfusion injury, including injury caused by or during reperfusion. The protective effect against ischemia-reperfusion injury occurs instantaneously or within a short time period following administration of a composition comprising one or more of the peptides of the present invention, preferably within at least about 40 minutes following administration, more preferably within 1-20 minutes, more preferably within 1-15 minutes, and most preferably within about 1-10 minutes.\n\n\n2.6 Diseases Related to Increased Cytokine Expression and Related Diseases, Indications, Conditions and Syndromes. Expression of various cytokines is increased during an inflammatory process, including an inflammatory process secondary to circulatory shock, ischemia, reperfusion injury and the like. TNF-α is a pleiotropic cytokine produced mainly by macrophages, and also by other types of cells. Other cytokines which increase during an inflammatory process, including an inflammatory process secondary to circulatory shock, ischemia, reperfusion injury and the like, include IL-1 and IL-6. While cytokines such as TNF-α have beneficial effects in many instances, significantly increased levels, such as secondary to circulatory shock, ischemia, reperfusion injury and the like, can have pathological effects. In one aspect, reperfusion of hypoxic or ischemic tissues, such hypoxic as secondary to circulatory shock, results in inflammatory responses, including increased cytokine expression.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the invention is directed to methods of using one or more of the peptides of the present invention to decrease pro-inflammatory cytokine production and expression, including decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokine production and expression secondary to circulatory shock, ischemia, reperfusion injury and the like. The decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokine production and expression, including without limitation one or more of TNF-α, IL-1 and IL-6, occurs instantaneously or within a short time period following administration of a composition comprising one or more of the peptides of the present invention, preferably within at least about 40 minutes following administration, more preferably within 1-20 minutes, more preferably within 1-15 minutes, and most preferably within about 1-10 minutes.\n\n\nIn a related embodiment, the invention is directed to methods of using one or more of the peptides of the present invention to increase anti-inflammatory cytokine production and expression. The increase in anti-inflammatory cytokine production and expression, including without limitation IL-10, occurs instantaneously or within a short time period following administration of a composition comprising one or more of the peptides of the present invention, preferably within at least about 40 minutes following administration, more preferably within 1-20 minutes, more preferably within 1-15 minutes, and most preferably within about 1-10 minutes. 2.7 Use for Hemodialysis.\n\n\nThe compositions and methods of the present invention may be employed to prevent hypotension while subjects are undergoing hemodialysis, as an adjunct in the removal of excess extracellular fluid during hemodialysis by preventing or minimizing hypotension secondary to removal of excess fluid, to stabilize high blood pressures between hemodialysis treatments by removal of excess extracellular fluid, and for similar and related indications. In hemodialysis, blood is pumped through the blood compartment of a dialyzer, exposing it to a semipermeable membrane. The cleansed blood is then returned via the \n\n circuit back to the body. Ultrafiltration occurs by increasing the hydrostatic pressure across the dialyzer membrane, generally by applying a negative pressure to the dialysate compartment of the dialyzer. This pressure gradient causes water and dissolved solutes to move from blood to the dialysate, and allows removal of up to several liters of excess extracellular fluid during a typical 3 to 5 hour treatment. Removal of excess extracellular fluid in subjects on long-term hemodialysis is critical because the presence of chronic volume expansion of excess fluid results in hypertension. However, it is frequently not possible to remove all accumulated excess fluid during hemodialysis because of intradialytic (during dialysis) hypotension. Intradialytic hypotension is defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure by > 20 mm Hg or a decrease in mean arterial pressure by 10 mm Hg more. Intradialytic hypotension is associated with symptoms such as abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, muscle cramps, dizziness or fainting, and anxiety. Intradialytic hypotension can induce cardiac arrhythmias, and predispose the subject to coronary ischemic events or cerebral ischemic events.\n\n\nEstimates are that intradialytic hypotension occurs in about 25% to 50% of all hemodialysis sessions. The primary cause of intradialytic hypotension is believed to be the rapid removal of circulatory volume during hemodialysis, resulting in hemodynamic instability. The most common current treatment for intradialytic hypotension is either to decrease the rate of fluid removal or infuse fluid, but both methods result in insufficient dialysis and resulting volume overload. Pharmacological interventions have been considered, such as use of midodrine, an α-adrenergic agent. However, this is associated with a number of side effects, including induction of supine systolic hypertension. In addition, various vasopressin receptor agonists have been considered for this indication, as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 7,183,255, issued February 27, 2007.\n\n\n2.8 Acute Blood Loss Secondary to Surgery and Related Indications, Conditions and Syndromes.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions and methods of the present invention can be utilized for subjects with acute blood loss that occurs during surgery. In one embodiment, the subject can be undergoing a surgery that can cause acute blood loss. In another embodiment, the subject can be scheduled to undergo a surgery that can cause acute blood loss. In another embodiment, the subject can be predisposed to or at high risk of needing a surgery that can cause acute blood loss as a result of genetic factors (e.g., family history) and/or environmental factors (e.g., diet). As used herein, the term \"surgery\" is used interchangeable with the term \"operation.\" A surgery that causes acute blood loss can involve any type of cell (e.g., somatic cell, germ cell, embryonic cell, stem cell), tissue (e.g., bone, muscle, connective, blood), and/or organ (e.g., brain, kidney, lung, heart, pancreas, prostate, ovary, uterus, gastrointestinal tract). Examples of surgeries that can cause acute blood loss include, but are not limited to, an elective surgery. There are many different types of surgery including, but is not limited to, optional or elective surgery, required surgery, and urgent or emergency surgery. Many surgical procedures are associated with a high risk of hemorrhage or blood loss. These include cardiac surgeries, coronary artery bypass graft surgery, abdominal hysterectomies, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, repair of a brain aneurysm, radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations, endovascular treatment of posteri or circulation aneurysms, proliferative vitreoretinopathy, lipoma excision, and sinus surgery. As such, the subject can be one who is undergoing, scheduled to undergo, or has undergone one of the foregoing surgical \n\n procedures, or any other surgical procedure with a high risk of hemorrhage or blood loss, or any other surgical procedure in which there is intra-operative or post-operation hemorrhage, blood loss, hypovolemia or hypotension.\n\n\nIn one aspect, the compositions and methods of the invention have particular application in cardiac surgery, such as coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Over 500,000 bypass surgeries are performed per year in the United States, but there are no approved cardioprotective drugs for reduction of cardiovascular events post surgery. Additionally, a large proportion of bypass patients are hypotensive prior to or during surgery, and are currently administered conventional vasopressor drugs.\n\n\nThe subject can be administered compositions including one or more of the peptides of the present invention by the methods of the present invention before, during and/or after the surgery. The timing and quantity of compositions administered to a patient which include one or more peptides of the present invention can be selected by the skilled practitioner using ordinary skill taking into account, for example, the degree of blood loss in the subject.\n\n\n2.9 Acute Blood Loss Secondary to Trauma and Related Indications, Conditions and Syndromes.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions and methods of the present invention can be utilized for subjects with acute blood loss from trauma. In one embodiment, the subject is suffering from or diagnosed with a trauma that can cause acute blood loss. In another embodiment, the subject can be predisposed to or at risk of suffering a trauma that causes acute blood loss as a result of genetic factors (e.g., triple-X syndrome) and/or environmental factors (e.g., living in a high crime neighborhood).\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"trauma\" is used interchangeable with the term \"injury.\" A trauma that causes acute blood loss can involve any type of cell (e.g., somatic cell, germ cell, embryonic cell, stem cell), tissue (e.g., bone, muscle, connective, blood), and/or organ (e.g., brain, kidney, lung, heart, pancreas, prostate, ovary, uterus, gastrointestinal tract). Examples of trauma that can cause acute blood loss include, but are not limited to, a burn, a gunshot wound, and a stab wound.\n\n\nThere are many different types of trauma including, but not limited to, accidental injury and criminal injury. An accidental injury is injury sustain in any type of accident (e.g., automobile accident injury, whiplash, drowning, fall, sports injury, burn, machinery accident, suffocation, natural accident, accidental eye injury, occupational injury, toy-related injury). Criminal injury is injury caused by criminal activity (e.g., child abuse, assault), and in particular, gunshot wound and stab wound.\n\n\nTrauma includes battlefield trauma. Battlefield trauma includes trauma secondary to gunshot or an explosive device, including but not limited to rockets, mortars, mines, improvised explosive devices and the like. Uncontrolled hemorrhage is the leading cause of preventable combat-related deaths. The vast majority of these deaths occur in the field before the injured can be transported to a treatment facility. It has been estimated that the most common cause single cause of preventable death on the battlefield results from bleeding from extremity wounds. Bleeding from torso wounds is another cause of preventable death. Battlefield trauma also includes penetrating head wounds and injuries.\n\n\nThe subject can be administered compositions including one or more of the peptides of the present invention by the methods of the present invention, which administration may be before the onset of symptoms of conditions such as hypovolemic shock, traumatic shock or hemorrhagic shock, or after the onset of symptoms. The timing and quantity of compositions administered can be selected by the \n\n skilled practitioner using ordinary skill taking into account, for example, the degree of blood loss in the subject.\n\n\n2.10 Ocular Disease, Indications, Conditions and Syndromes.\n\n\nDry eye disease is an ocular disease affecting approximately 10-20% of the population. This disease progressively affects larger percentages of the population as it ages, with the majority of these patients being women. In addition, almost everyone experiences ocular irritation, or the symptoms and/or signs of dry eye as a condition, from time to time under certain circumstances, such as prolonged visual tasking (e.g., working on a computer), being in a dry environment, using medications that result in ocular drying and so on. In individuals suffering from dry eye, the protective layer of tears that normally protects the ocular surface is compromised, a result of insufficient or unhealthy production of one or more tear components. This can lead to exposure of the surface of the eye, ultimately promoting desiccation and damage of surface cells. Signs and symptoms of dry eye include but are not limited to keratitis, conjunctival and corneal staining, redness, blurry vision, decreased tear film break-up time, decreased tear production, tear volume, and tear flow, increased conjunctival redness, excess debris in the tear film, ocular dryness, ocular grittiness, ocular burning, foreign body sensation in the eye, excess tearing, photophobia, ocular stinging, refractive impairment, ocular sensitivity, and ocular irritation. Patients may experience one or more of these symptoms. The excess tearing response may seem counterintuitive, but it is a natural reflex response to the irritation and foreign body sensation caused by the dry eye. Some patients may also experience ocular itching due to a combination of ocular allergy and dry eye symptoms.\n\n\nThere are many possible variables that can influence a patient's signs or symptoms of dry eye including levels of circulating hormones, various autoimmune diseases (e.g. Sjogren's syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus), ocular surgeries including PRK or LASIK, many medications, environmental conditions, visual tasking such as computer use, ocular fatigue, contact lens wear, and mechanical influences such as corneal sensitivity, partial lid closure, surface irregularities (e.g. pterygium), and lid irregularities (e.g. ptosis, entropion/ectropion, Pinguecula). Environments with low humidity, such as those that cause dehydration, can exacerbate or cause dry eye symptoms, such as sitting in a car with the defroster on or living in a dry climate zone. In addition, visual tasking can exacerbate symptoms. Tasks that can greatly influence symptoms include watching TV or using a computer for long periods of time where the blink rate is decreased.\n\n\nUveitis is an ocular disease involving inflammation of the middle layer or uvea of the eye, and may also be understood to include any inflammatory process involving the interior of the eye. Uveitis includes anterior, intermediate, posterior and panuveitic forms, with the majority of uveitis cases anterior in location, involving inflammation of the iris and anterior chamber. This condition can occur as a single episode and subside with proper treatment or may take on a recurrent or chronic nature. Symptoms include red eye, injected conjunctiva, pain and decreased vision. Signs include dilated ciliary vessels, presence of cells and flare in the anterior chamber, and keratic precipitates on the posterior surface of the cornea. Intermediate uveitis includes inflammation and the presence of inflammatory cells in the vitreous cavity, and posterior uveitis include the inflammation of the retina and choroid. Uveitis may be secondary to any of a number of diseases and disorders, including acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy, ankylosing spondylitis, Behget's disease, birdshot retinochoroidopathy, \n\n brucellosis, herpes simplex, herpes zoster, inflammatory bowel disease, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, Kawasaki disease, leptospirosis, Lyme disease, multiple sclerosis, psoriatic arthritis, Reiter's syndrome, sarcoidosis, syphilis, systemic lupus erythematosus, toxocariasis, toxoplasmosis, tuberculosis, Vogt- Koyanagi-Harada syndrome, Whipple disease or polyarteritis nodosa. 2.11 Inflammatory Diseases, Indications, Conditions and Syndromes.\n\n\nPeptides, compositions and methods of the present invention are further directed towards the treatment of inflammatory diseases and inflammatory conditions in a subject. There are a number of inflammatory diseases and inflammatory conditions which may be so treated. In one aspect, the inflammatory condition results from a disease including a form of arthritis, including but not limited to osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, septic arthritis, gout and pseudogout, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, Still's disease and ankylosing spondylitis, as well as arthritis secondary to other diseases, such as arthritis secondary to lupus erythematosus, Henoch-Schonlein purpura, psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis, haemochromatosis, hepatitis, Wegener's granulomatosis, vasculitis syndromes, Lyme disease, familial Mediterranean fever, hyperimmunoglobulinemia D with recurrent fever, TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. In another aspect, the inflammatory condition results from a disease including a form of inflammatory bowel disease, such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, collagenous colitis, lymphocytic colitis, ischemic colitis, diversion colitis, Behget's syndrome, infective colitis and indeterminate colitis. In another aspect, the inflammatory condition results from an autoimmune disease, including but not limited to systemic syndromes such as systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren's syndrome, scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis and polymyositis, or a syndrome affecting only a local body system, such as the endocrine system (diabetes mellitus type 1 , Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Addison's disease, etc.), dermatologic system (pemphigus vulgaris), hematologic system (autoimmune hemolytic anemia), or neural system (multiple sclerosis). Thus autoimmune diseases include, in addition to the general syndromes discussed above, such diseases and conditions as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, Addison's disease, ankylosing spondylitis, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, aplastic anemia, autoimmune hepatitis, autoimmune oophoritis, celiac disease, Crohn's disease, gestational pemphigoid, Goodpasture's syndrome, Graves' disease, Guillain-Barre syndrome, Hashimoto's disease, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, Kawasaki disease, lupus erythematosus, mixed connective tissue disease, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome, optic neuritis, Ord's thyroiditis, pemphigus, pernicious anaemia, primary biliary cirrhosis, Reiter's syndrome, Sjogren's syndrome, Takayasu's arteritis, temporal arteritis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia and Wegener's granulomatosis.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the inflammatory condition results from or is related to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), also known as chronic obstructive airway diseases, including but not limited to diseases characterized by the pathological limitation of airflow in the airway that is not fully reversible, such as for example chronic bronchitis, emphysema, pneumoconiosis, pulmonary neoplasms and other lung disorders. Other inflammatory conditions include upper or lower airway diseases and disorders, such as allergic asthma, non-allergic asthma, allergic rhinitis, vasomotor rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, non-allergic conjunctivitis, and the like, as well as airway diseases related to external toxins or substances, such as various forms of pneumoconiosis (coalworker's pneumoconiosis, asbestosis, \n\n silicosis, bauxite fibrosis, berylliosis, or siderosis), byssinosis or hypersensitivity pneumonitis (farmer's lung or bird fancier's lung).\n\n\nIn yet another aspect, the inflammatory condition results from or is related to some form of transplant-related condition or syndrome, such as graft-versus-host disease, hyperacute rejection, acute rejection, or chronic rejection. Graft-versus-host disease is a common complication of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, but can occur with other transplantations, and particularly those with T cells present in the graft, either as contaminants or intentionally introduced. Hyperacute, acute or chronic rejection can occur with bodily organs such as kidneys, liver, pancreas, spleen, uterus, heart or lungs, as well as transplantation of bone, cornea, face, hand, penis or skin. In one embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition including one or more of the peptides of the present invention is given prophylactically to limit or prevent a transplant-related condition or syndrome, such as immediately before, during or after transplantation of a bodily fluid, organ or part. In another embodiment, the bodily fluid, organ or part being transplanted is perfused with a solution of a pharmaceutical composition including one or more of the peptides of the present invention.

The therapeutic administration of one or more of the peptides of the present invention serves to attenuate any symptom, or prevent additional symptoms from arising. When administration is for the purposes of preventing shock (\"prophylactic administration\"), one or more of the peptides of the present invention are provided in advance of any visible or detectable symptom. The prophylactic administration of one or more of the peptides of the present invention serve to attenuate subsequently arising symptoms or prevent symptoms from arising altogether. The route of administration of one or more of the peptides of the present invention include, but are not limited to, topical, transdermal, intranasal, vaginal, rectal, oral, subcutaneous, intravenous, intraarterial, intramuscular, intraosseous, intraperitoneal, epidural and intrathecal.\n\n\nFurthermore, the methods of treating or preventing circulatory shock of the present invention also relate to coadministering one or more substances to the subject in addition to one or more of the peptides of the present invention. The term \"coadminister\" indicates that each of at least two compounds is administered during a time frame wherein the respective periods of biological activity or effects overlap. Thus the term includes sequential as well as concurrent administration of compounds where one compound is one or more of the peptides of the present invention. If more than one compound is coadministered, the routes of administration of the two or more compounds need not be the same. The scope of the invention is not limited by the identity of the compound which may be coadministered. For \n\n example, one or more of the peptides of the present invention may be coadministered with androstenetriol, androstenediol or derivatives thereof, various vasopressin agonists, or other pharmaceutically active substances, such as catecholamines or other α adrenergic agonists, α\n2\n adrenergic agonists, β adrenergic agonists or β\n2\n adrenergic agonists, including but not limited to epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, isoproterenol, vasopressin and dobutamine. Alternatively, one or more of the peptides of the present invention may be coadministered with fluids or other substances that are capable of alleviating, attenuating, preventing or removing symptoms in a subject suffering from, exhibiting the symptoms of, or at risk of suffering from hypovolemic shock, vasodilatory shock or cardiogenic shock. Types of fluid that can be coadministered with one or more of the peptides of the present invention should be specific to the circumstances surrounding the particular subject that is suffering from, exhibiting the symptoms of, or at risk of suffering from shock. For example, fluids that may be coadministered with one or more of the peptides of the present invention include, but are not limited to, salt solutions - such as sodium chloride and sodium bicarbonate - as well as whole blood, synthetic blood substitutes, plasma, serum, serum albumin and colloid solutions. Colloid solutions include, but are not limited to, solutions containing hetastarch, albumin or plasma. In one particular embodiment of the present invention, fluids such as one or more of salt solutions, colloidal solutions, whole blood, synthetic blood substitutes, plasma or serum are coadministered with one or more of the peptides of the present invention in patients suffering from or exhibiting the symptoms of a hypovolemic shock, such as hemorrhagic shock. Particular embodiments of the coadministration methods of the present invention include methods of performing a transfusion in a subject, with the transfusion methods comprising providing blood or synthetic blood substitutes that comprise one or more of the peptides of the present invention to a subject. The blood used in the transfusion methods can be whole blood, synthetic blood substitutes, or any fractionated portion of whole blood, such as plasma, serum, or red blood cells. 4.4 Methods of Administration and Use for Prophylactic Therapy for Circulatory Shock and\n\n\nRelated Diseases, Indications, Conditions and Syndromes.\n\n\nThe invention also relates to methods of preventing or preventing the progression of shock in a subject at risk of suffering from shock by administering a therapeutically effective amount of one or more of the peptides of the present invention to the subject, prior to or immediately at the onset of the first symptoms of shock. As used herein, the term \"prevent,\" as it relates to shock, indicates that a substance of the present invention is administered to a subject to prohibit one or more symptoms of shock from detectably appearing or to attenuate the effects of one or more symptoms of shock. The term \"prevent\" also encompasses prohibiting entirely shock or any of its associated symptoms, from detectably appearing. Thus a subject may be \"pretreated,\" such as a subject in a surgical setting, by using the substances of the present invention to prevent shock from arising. The phrase \"preventing the progression,\" as it relates to shock, is used to mean a procedure designed to prohibit the detectable appearance of one or more additional symptoms of shock in a patient already exhibiting one or more symptoms of shock, and is also used to mean prohibiting the already-present symptoms of shock from worsening in the subject. The symptoms of shock that are included in preventative methods of the present invention include, but are not limited to, such symptoms of shock as highlighted herein, such as tachycardia, shallow or erratic breathing and death. A subject that is \"at risk of shock\" may be \n\n recognized based upon the specific circumstances surrounding a subject. For example, a surgery patient or a subject that has been wounded and begun losing blood would be at risk of shock. Similarly, a patient with a bacterial infection and exhibiting a fever or low blood pressure may also be at risk of shock or an inflammatory disease or condition. In additional embodiments of the present invention, the methods are used to prevent cardiogenic shock, hypovolemic shock and vasodilatory shock, each of which can be in any of the three aforementioned stages of shock. In one particular embodiment of the present invention, the methods are used to prevent cardiogenic shock. In another particular embodiment of the present invention, the methods are used to prevent vasodilatory shock. In another more particular embodiment of the present invention, the methods are used to prevent shock resulting from sepsis or bacteremia. In an even more particular embodiment, the methods are used to prevent septic shock or bacteremic shock in Stage I, Il or III shock. In yet another embodiment, the methods of the present invention are used to prevent hypovolemic shock. In one particular embodiment of the present invention, the methods are used prevent hemorrhagic shock. In an even more particular embodiment, the methods are used to prevent hemorrhagic shock in Stage I, Stage Il or Stage III.\n\n\nSimilar to the methods of treating shock described herein, one embodiment of the methods of preventing shock of the present invention comprises coadministering another substance with one or more of the peptides of the present invention or a derivative thereof. The scope of the invention is not limited by the identity of the substance which may be coadministered with one or more of the peptides of the present invention to prevent shock. For example, one or more of the peptides of the present invention may be coadministered with androstenetriol, androstenediol or derivatives thereof, various vasopressin agonists, or other pharmaceutically active substances, such as catecholamines or other α adrenergic agonists, α\n2\n adrenergic agonists, β adrenergic agonists or β\n2\n adrenergic agonists, including but not limited to epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, isoproterenol, vasopressin and dobutamine, to prevent shock.\n\n\nAlternatively, one or more of the peptides of the present invention may be coadministered with fluids or other substances that are capable of preventing or removing symptoms in a subject at risk of suffering from hypovolemic shock, vasodilatory shock or cardiogenic shock. The types of fluid that can be coadministered with one or more of the peptides of the present invention to prevent shock should be specific to the circumstances surrounding the particular subject that is at risk of suffering from shock. For example, fluids that may be coadministered with one or more of the peptides of the present invention include, but are not limited to, salt solutions — such as sodium chloride and sodium bicarbonate — as well as whole blood, synthetic blood substitutes, plasma, serum, serum albumin and colloid solutions. Colloid solutions include, but are not limited to, solutions containing hetastarch, albumin or plasma. In one particular embodiment of the present invention, fluids including one or more of salt solutions, colloidal solutions, whole blood, synthetic blood substitutes, plasma or serum are coadministered with one or more of the peptides of the present invention or a derivative thereof in subjects at risk of suffering a hypovolemic shock, such as hemorrhagic shock.\n\n\n4.5 Methods of Administration and Use for Inflammation Related Applications, Diseases, Indications, Conditions and Syndromes. \n\n In yet another aspect, the invention includes methods which optionally include monitoring the subject for signs or symptoms of inflammation, inflammatory diseases or inflammatory conditions both before and after administration of one or more of the peptides of the present invention. Thus a subject may be administered one or more of the peptides of the present invention by one of the methods of the invention after being diagnosed with a condition, disease or syndrome likely to induce an inflammatory response, but prior to the manifestation of overt symptoms of inflammation, inflammatory disease or inflammatory condition. Methods of treating or preventing inflammation, inflammatory diseases or inflammatory conditions described herein comprise administering a therapeutically effective amount of one or more of the peptides of the present invention to a subject. As used herein, the term \"administer\" and \"administering\" are used to mean introducing at least one compound into a subject. When administration is for the purpose of treatment, the substance is provided at, or after the onset of, a sign or symptom of inflammation, inflammatory disease or inflammatory condition. The therapeutic administration of this substance serves to attenuate any symptom, or prevent additional symptoms from arising. When administration is prophylactic administration for the purposes of preventing or limiting inflammation, inflammatory disease or an inflammatory condition, a pharmaceutical composition including one or more of the peptides of the present invention is provided in advance of any visible or detectable symptom. The prophylactic administration of one or more of the peptides of the present invention serve to attenuate subsequently arising symptoms or prevent symptoms from arising altogether. The route of administration of one or more of the peptides of the present invention include, but are not limited to, topical, transdermal, intranasal, vaginal, rectal, oral, subcutaneous intravenous, intraarterial, intramuscular, intraosseous, intraperitoneal, epidural and intrathecal.\n\n\n4.6 Methods of Administration and Use for Ocular Diseases, Indications, Conditions and Syndromes.\n\n\nFor ocular applications, in one aspect one or more of the peptides of the present invention are formulated in an ophthalmic dosage form and is administered in the form of eye drops, eye washes or by means of other ocular delivery systems.\n\n\n4.7 Devices for Administration for Hemorrhagic or Traumatic Shock.\n\n\nIn certain aspects, special devices may be provided for delivery and administration of a pharmaceutical composition including one or more of the peptides of the present invention. Thus in one aspect a prefilled syringe may be adapted for use in military applications for emergency treatment under battlefield conditions, such as for treatment of battlefield trauma, or use by paramedic personnel responding to a trauma victim. The prefilled syringe may include a lyophilized component including one or more of the peptides of the present invention and an aqueous solubilizing component, such that the pharmaceutical composition may be reconstituted immediately prior to use. The resulting reconstituted pharmaceutical composition may be an isotonic or hypertonic solution. In a related aspect, the prefilled syringe may include one or more of the peptides of the present invention in solution with the pharmaceutical composition including one or more preservatives or stabilizers, such that the prefilled syringe may be stored for a specified period at ambient temperature, such as room temperature, without substantial degradation. \n\n 5.0 Methods of Making.\n\n\nIn general, the peptides of the present invention may be synthesized by solid-phase synthesis and purified according to methods known in the art. Any of a number of well-known procedures utilizing a variety of resins and reagents may be used to prepare the peptides of the present invention. The cyclic peptides of the present invention may be readily synthesized by known conventional procedures for the formation of a peptide linkage between amino acids. Such conventional procedures include, for example, any solution phase procedure permitting a condensation between the free alpha amino group of an amino acid or residue thereof having its carboxyl group and other reactive groups protected and the free primary carboxyl group of another amino acid or residue thereof having its amino group or other reactive groups protected. In a preferred conventional procedure, the cyclic peptides of the present invention may be synthesized by solid-phase synthesis and purified according to methods known in the art. Any of a number of well-known procedures utilizing a variety of resins and reagents may be used to prepare the peptides of the present invention.\n\n\nThe process for synthesizing the cyclic peptides may be carried out by a procedure whereby each amino acid in the desired sequence is added one at a time in succession to another amino acid or residue thereof or by a procedure whereby peptide fragments with the desired amino acid sequence are first synthesized conventionally and then condensed to provide the desired peptide. The resulting peptide is then cyclized to yield a cyclic peptide of the invention.\n\n\nSolid phase peptide synthesis methods are well known and practiced in the art. In such methods the synthesis of peptides of the invention can be carried out by sequentially incorporating the desired amino acid residues one at a time into the growing peptide chain according to the general principles of solid phase methods. These methods are disclosed in numerous references, including Merrifield, R. B., Solid phase synthesis (Nobel lecture). Angew Chem 24:799-810 (1985) and Barany et al., The Peptides, Analysis, Synthesis and Biology, Vol. 2, Gross, E. and Meienhofer, J., Eds. Academic Press 1-284 (1980).\n\n\nIn chemical syntheses of peptides, reactive side chain groups of the various amino acid residues are protected with suitable protecting groups, which prevent a chemical reaction from occurring at that site until the protecting group is removed. Also common is the protection of the alpha amino group of an amino acid residue or fragment while that entity reacts at the carboxyl group, followed by the selective removal of the alpha amino protecting group to allow a subsequent reaction to take place at that site. Specific protecting groups have been disclosed and are known in solid phase synthesis methods and solution phase synthesis methods.\n\n\nAlpha amino groups may be protected by a suitable protecting group, including a urethane-type protecting group, such as benzyloxycarbonyl (Z) and substituted benzyloxycarbonyl, such as p- chlorobenzyloxycarbonyl, p-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl, p-bromobenzyloxycarbonyl, p-biphenyl- isopropoxycarbonyl, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) and p-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl (Moz) and aliphatic urethane-type protecting groups, such as t-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), diisopropylmethoxycarbonyl, isopropoxycarbonyl, and allyloxycarbonyl (Alloc). Fmoc are preferred for alpha amino protection. Guanidino groups may be protected by a suitable protecting group, such as nitro, p- toluenesulfonyl (Tos), Z, pentamethylchromanesulfonyl (Pmc), adamantyloxycarbonyl, \n\n pentamethyldihydrobenzofuran-5-sulfonyl (Pbf) and Boc. Pbf and Pmc are preferred protecting groups for Arg.\n\n\nThe peptides of the invention described herein were prepared using solid phase synthesis, such as by means of a Symphony Multiplex Peptide Synthesizer (Rainin Instrument Company) automated peptide synthesizer, using programming modules as provided by the manufacturer and following the protocols set forth in the manufacturer's manual.\n\n\nSolid phase synthesis is commenced from the C-terminal end of the peptide by coupling a protected alpha amino acid to a suitable resin. Such starting material is prepared by attaching an alpha amino-protected amino acid by an ester linkage to a p-benzyloxybenzyl alcohol (Wang) resin, a 2- chlorotrityl chloride resin or an oxime resin, by an amide bond between an Fmoc-Linker, such as p-[(R, S^α-ti^θH-fluor-en-θ-yO-methoxyformamidol^^-dimethyloxybenzyll-phenoxyacetic acid (Rink linker) to a benzhydrylamine (BHA) resin, or by other means well known in the art. Fmoc-Linker-BHA resin supports are commercially available and generally used when feasible. The resins are carried through repetitive cycles as necessary to add amino acids sequentially. The alpha amino Fmoc protecting groups are removed under basic conditions. Piperidine, piperazine, diethylamine, or morpholine (20-40% v/v) in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) may be used for this purpose.\n\n\nFollowing removal of the alpha amino protecting group, the subsequent protected amino acids are coupled stepwise in the desired order to obtain an intermediate, protected peptide-resin. The activating reagents used for coupling of the amino acids in the solid phase synthesis of the peptides are well known in the art. After the peptide is synthesized, if desired, the orthogonally protected side chain protecting groups may be removed using methods well known in the art for further derivatization of the peptide.\n\n\nTypically, orthogonal protecting groups are used as appropriate. For example, the peptides of the invention contain multiple amino acids with an amino group-containing side chain. In one aspect, an Allyl-Alloc protection scheme is employed with the amino acids forming a lactam bridge through their side chains, and orthogonal protecting groups, cleavable under different reactive conditions, use for other amino acids with amino group-containing side chains. Thus, for example, Fmoc-Lys(Alloc)-OH, Fmoc- Om(AIIoC)-OH, Fmoc-Dap(Alloc)-OH, Fmoc-Dab(Alloc)-OH, Fmoc-Asp(OAII)-OH or Fmoc-Glu(OAII)-OH amino acids can be employed for the positions forming a lactam bridge upon cyclization, while other amino acids with amino group-containing side chains have a different and orthogonal protecting group, such as with Fmoc-Arg(Pbf)-OH, Fmoc-Lys(Pbf)-OH, Fmoc-Dab(Pbf)-OH or the like. Other protecting groups may be similarly employed; by way of example and not limitation, Mtt/OPp (4-methyltrityl/ 2- phenylisopropyl) can be employed with the side chains forming a lactam bridge upon cyclization, with orthogonal protecting groups being utilized for other positions that are not cleavable using conditions suitable for cleavage of Mtt/OPp. Reactive groups in a peptide can be selectively modified, either during solid phase synthesis or after removal from the resin. For example, peptides can be modified to obtain N-terminus modifications, such as acetylation, while on resin, or may be removed from the resin by use of a cleaving reagent and then modified. Similarly, methods for modifying side chains of amino acids are well known to those skilled in the art of peptide synthesis. The choice of modifications made to reactive groups present on the peptide will be determined, in part, by the characteristics that are desired in the peptide. \n\n In the peptides of the present invention, in one embodiment the N-terminus group is modified by introduction of an N-acetyl group. In one aspect, a method is employed wherein after removal of the protecting group at the N-terminal, the resin-bound peptide is reacted with acetic anhydride in DMF in the presence of an organic base, such as aspyridine or diisopropylethylamine. Other methods of N-terminus acetylation are known in the art, including solution phase acetylation, and may be employed.\n\n\nThe peptide can, in one embodiment, be cyclized prior to cleavage from the peptide resin. For cyclization through reactive side chain moieties, the desired side chains are deprotected, and the peptide suspended in a suitable solvent and a cyclic coupling agent added. Suitable solvents include, for example DMF, dichloromethane (DCM) or 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). Suitable cyclic coupling reagents include, for example, 2-(1 H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1 ,1 ,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU), 2-(1 H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1 ,1 ,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU), benzotriazole-1-yl-oxy-tris(dimethylamino)phosphoniumhexafluorophosphate (BOP), benzotriazole-1-yl- oxy-tris(pyrrolidino)phosphoniumhexafluorophosphate (PyBOP), 2-(7-aza-1 H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1 , 1 ,3,3- tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TATU), 2-(2-oxo-1(2H)-pyridyl)-1 ,1 ,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TPTU) or N.N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide/i-hydroxybenzotriazole (DCCI/HOBt). Coupling is conventionally initiated by use of a suitable base, such as N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA), sym-collidine or N-methylmorpholine (NMM).\n\n\nFor peptides with a non-lactam cyclic bridge, such as peptides containing the bridge: -(CH\n2\n)\nx\n-NH-C(=O)-(CH\n2\n)\nz\n-C(=O)-NH-(CH\n2\n)\ny\n-, where x, y and z are each independently 1 to 5, the peptides may be made using solid phase synthesis employing a side-chain protected diamine amino acid for the positions to be cyclized. Particularly preferred in such positions are Dap, Dab or Lys, preferably with an amine protecting group such as Alloc, Mtt, Mmt (methoxytrityl), Dde (1-(4,4-dimethyl-2,6-dioxocyclohex-1-ylidene))ethyl), ivDde (1-(4,4- dimethyl-2,6-dioxocyclohex-1-ylidene)-3-methylbutyl) or any other orthogonally cleavable protecting group. Typically, one side chain protecting group is removed first, such as removal of Mtt using 2% TFA in dichloromethane. Following washing of the resin, the resulting resin-bound unprotected amine is acylated, such as with a 0.5 M solution of a cyclic anhydride such as succinic anhydride or glutaric anhydride in dichloromethane/pyridine 1 :1. Following additional wash steps, the orthogonally cleavable protecting group of the second diamino amino acid is cleaved, such as removal of Alloc using tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) and phenyl silane in dichloromethane. After washing with dichloromethane and DMF the resin-bound peptide is cyclized using standard coupling reagents such as TBTU and a base. Alternatively, an ivDde protected resin-bound diamino amino acid can be deprotected using a solution of 5% of hydrazine in DMF, and after washing with DMF the resulting resin bound amine can either be acylated with a cyclic anhydride or can be cyclized with a resin bound carboxylic acid.\n\n\nThe cyclized peptides can then be cleaved from solid phase, using any suitable reagent, such as ethylamine in DCM or various combinations of agents, such as trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), tri- isopropylsilane (TIS), dimethoxybenezene (DMB), water and the like. The resulting crude peptide is dried and remaining amino acid side chain protecting groups, if any, are cleaved using any suitable reagent, such as (TFA) in the presence of water, TIS, 2-mercaptopethane (ME), and/or 1 ,2-ethanedithiol (EDT). The final product is precipitated by adding cold ether and collected by filtration. Final purification \n\n is by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), using a suitable column, such as a C\n18\n column, or other methods of separation or purification, such as methods based on the size or charge of the peptide, can also be employed. Once purified, the peptide can be characterized by any number of methods, such as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), amino acid analysis, mass spectrometry, and the like.\n\n\nFor peptides of the present invention which have a C-terminus substituted amide derivative or N- alkyl group, synthesis may proceed by solid phase synthesis commenced from the C-terminal end of the peptide by coupling a protected alpha amino acid to a suitable resin. Such methods for preparing substituted amide derivatives on solid-phase have been described in the art. See, for example, Barn D. R. et al., Synthesis of an array of amides by aluminum chloride assisted cleavage on resin bound esters. Tetrahedron Letters, 37:3213-3216 (1996); DeGrado W.F. and Kaiser E.T., Solid-phase synthesis of protected peptides on a polymer bound oxime: Preparation of segments comprising the sequences of a cytotoxic 26-peptide analogue. J. Org. Chem., 47:3258-3261 (1982). Such a starting material can be prepared by attaching an alpha amino-protected amino acid by an ester linkage to a p-benzyloxybenzyl alcohol (Wang) resin or an oxime resin by well known means. The peptide chain is grown with the desired sequence of amino acids, the peptide cyclized and the peptide-resin treated with a solution of appropriate amine (such as methyl amine, dimethyl amine, ethylamine, and so on). Peptides employing a p-benzyloxybenzyl alcohol (Wang) resin may be cleaved from resin by aluminum chloride in DCM, and peptides employing an oxime resin may be cleaved by DCM. While synthesis has been described primarily with reference to solid phase Fmoc chemistry, it is to be understood that other chemistries and synthetic methods may be employed to make the cyclic peptides of the invention, such as by way of example and not limitation, methods employing Boc chemistry, solution chemistry, and other chemistries and synthetic methods.\n\n\n6.0 Formulations. Depending on the desired route of administration, the formulation of a composition including one or more cyclic peptides of the present invention may be varied. Thus the formulation may be suitable for subcutaneous injection, or intravenous injection, for topical applications, for ocular applications, for nasal spray applications, for inhalation applications, for other transdermal applications and the like.\n\n\n6.1 Salt Form of Cyclic Peptides of the Present Invention.

Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols and mixtures thereof in oils. These preparations may optionally contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms. The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases, the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that it may be administered by syringe. The form must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, a polyol, for \n\n example glycerol, propylene glycol or liquid polyethylene glycol, suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils.\n\n\nThe cyclic peptides of the present invention may be therapeutically applied by means of nasal administration.

The peptides may also be in a dry or powder formulation.\n\n\nThe cyclic peptides of the present invention may be formulated with any of a variety of agents that increase effective nasal absorption of drugs, including peptide drugs. These agents should increase nasal absorption without unacceptable damage to the mucosal membrane. U.S. Patents No. 5,693,608, 5,977,070 and 5,908,825, among others, teach a number of pharmaceutical compositions that may be employed, including absorption enhancers, and the teachings of each of the foregoing, and all references and patents cited therein, are incorporated by reference.\n\n\nIf in an aqueous solution, the cyclic peptides may be appropriately buffered by means of saline, acetate, phosphate, citrate, acetate or other buffering agents, which may be at any physiologically acceptable pH, generally from about pH 4 to about pH 7. A combination of buffering agents may also be employed, such as phosphate buffered saline, a saline and acetate buffer, and the like. In the case of saline, a 0.9% saline solution may be employed. In the case of acetate, phosphate, citrate, and the like, a 50 mM solution may be employed. In addition to buffering agents, a suitable preservative may be employed, to prevent or limit bacteria and other microbial growth. One such preservative that may be employed is 0.05% benzalkonium chloride.\n\n\nIn an alternative embodiment, cyclic peptides of the present invention may be administered directly into the lung, lntrapulmonary administration may be performed by means of a metered dose inhaler, a device allowing self-administration of a metered bolus of a peptide of the present invention when actuated by a patient during inspiration. In one aspect of this embodiment, the cyclic peptide may be in a dried and particulate form, for example particles between about 0.5 and 6.0 μm, such that the particles have sufficient mass to settle on the lung surface, and not be exhaled, but are small enough that they are not deposited on surfaces of the air passages prior to reaching the lung. Any of a variety of different techniques may be used to make dry powder microparticles, including but not limited to micro- milling, spray drying and a quick freeze aerosol followed by lyophilization. With micro-particles, the peptides may be deposited to the deep lung, thereby providing quick and efficient absorption into the bloodstream. Further, with such approach penetration enhancers are not required, as is sometimes the case in transdermal, nasal or oral mucosal delivery routes. Any of a variety of inhalers can be employed, including propellant-based aerosols, nebulizers, single dose dry powder inhalers and multidose dry powder inhalers. Common devices in current use include metered dose inhalers, which are used to deliver medications for the treatment of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and the like. Preferred devices include dry powder inhalers, designed to form a cloud or aerosol of fine powder with a particle size that is always less than about 6.0 μm.\n\n\nMicroparticle size, including mean size distribution, may be controlled by means of the method of making. For micro-milling, the size of the milling head, speed of the rotor, time of processing and the like control the microparticle size. For spray drying, the nozzle size, flow rate, dryer heat and the like control \n\n the microparticle size. For making by means of quick freeze aerosol followed by lyophilization, the nozzle size, flow rate, concentration of aerosoled solution and the like control the microparticle size. These parameters and others may be employed to control the microparticle size.\n\n\nThe cyclic peptides of the present invention may be therapeutically administered by means of an injection of a sustained release formulation. In one embodiment, a cyclic peptide of the present invention is formulated for a deep intramuscular injection, such as in the gluteal or deltoid muscle, of a formulation with a polyethylene glycol, such as polyethylene glycol 3350, and optionally one or more additional excipients and preservatives, including but not limited to excipients such as salts, polysorbate 80, sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid to adjust pH, and the like. In another embodiment a cyclic peptide of the present invention is formulated with a poly(ortho ester), which may be an auto-catalyzed poly(ortho ester) with any of a variable percentage of lactic acid in the polymeric backbone, and optionally one or more additional excipients. In one embodiment poly (D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) polymer is employed. In general, any of a number of injectable and bioerodible polymers, which are preferably also adhesive polymers, may be employed in a sustained release injectable formulation. Alternatively other sustained release formulations may be employed, including formulations permitting subcutaneous injection, which other formulations may include one or more of nano/microspheres (such as compositions including PLGA polymers), liposomes, emulsions (such as water-in-oil emulsions), gels, insoluble salts or suspensions in oil. The formulation may be such that an injection is required on a daily, weekly, monthly or other periodic basis, depending on the concentration and amount of cyclic peptide, the sustained release rate of the materials employed, and other factors known to those of skill in the art. 6.3 Oral Formulations of Peptides of the Present Invention.\n\n\nIn one aspect, the peptides of the present invention are formulated for oral delivery. The peptide is preferably formulated and made such that it is encased in an enteric protectant, more preferably such that it is not released until the tablet or capsule has transited the stomach, and optionally has further transited a portion of the small intestine. In the context of this application it will be understood that the term enteric coating or material refers to a coating or material that will pass through the stomach essentially intact but will rapidly disintegrate in the small intestine to release the active drug substance. One enteric coating solution that may be used includes cellulose acetate phthalate, and optionally other ingredients such as ammonium hydroxide, triacetin, ethyl alcohol, methylene blue, and purified water. Cellulose acetate phthalate is a polymer that has been used in the pharmaceutical industry for enterically coating individual dosage forms such as tablets and capsules, and is not soluble in water at a pH of less than about 5.8. Enteric coatings including cellulose acetate phthalate provide protection against the acidic environment of the stomach, but begin to dissolve in environment of the duodenum (pH of about 6- 6.5), and are completely dissolved by the time the dosage form reaches the ileum (pH of about 7-8). In addition to cellulose acetate phthalate, other enteric coating materials are known and may be used with peptides of the present invention, including without limitation hydroxypropylmethylethylcellulose succinate, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate, polyvinyl acetate phthalate, and methacrylic acid- methyl methacrylate copolymer. The enteric coating employed promotes dissolution of the dosage form primarily at a site outside the stomach, and may be selected such that the enteric coating dissolves at a pH of approximately at least 6.0, more preferable at a pH of from about 6.0 to about 8.0. In one preferred aspect, the enteric coating dissolves and breaks down in the proximity of the ileum. \n\n Any of a variety of permeation enhancers may be employed, to increase uptake in the intestines upon dissolution of the enteric coating. In one aspect, permeation enhancers increase either paracellular or transcellular transport systems. An increase in paracellular transport can be achieved by opening the tight junctions of the cells; an increase in transcellular transport can be achieved by increasing the fluidity of the cell membrane. Representative, non-limiting examples of such permeation enhancers include calcium chelators, bile salts (such as sodium cholate), and fatty acids. The peptides of the present invention may be in an enteric-coated individual dosage form that includes a fatty acid, such as for example oleate, palmitate, stearate, sodium caprate, or conjugated linoleic acid, in an enteric-coated capsule, to increase paracellular transport. In one aspect, the individual dosage form, such as a tablet or capsule, optionally further includes common pharmaceutical binders such as povidone, diluents, glidants, fillers such as microcrystalline cellulose, lubricants such as magnesium stearate, disintegrants such as croscarmellose sodium, preservatives, colorants and the like in their usual known sizes and amounts. In some embodiments, peptides or polypeptides that act as substrates for intestinal proteases are further added. 6.4 Ophthalmic Formulations.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, ocular diseases, indications, conditions and syndromes, such as for example either dry eye disease or uveitis, may be treated with an ophthalmic dosage form including one or more of the peptides of the present invention. The ophthalmic dosage form may include one or more active ingredients in addition to one or more of the peptides of the present invention, such as for example artificial tear components, topical corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclosporine-A (Restasis® - Allergan). In a related embodiment, one or additional compounds may be given separately from one or more of the peptides of the present invention, such as separate administration of an ophthalmic dosage form including an artificial tear component, a topical corticosteroid, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, a calcineurin inhibitor such a cyclosporine-A, or a combination of any of the foregoing.\n\n\n6.5 Routes of Administration.\n\n\nIf a composition including one or more peptides of the present invention is administered by injection, the injection may be intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal or other means known in the art. The peptides of the present invention may be formulated by any means known in the art, including but not limited to formulation as tablets, capsules, caplets, suspensions, powders, lyophilized preparations, suppositories, ocular drops, skin patches, oral soluble formulations, sprays, aerosols and the like, and may be mixed and formulated with buffers, binders, excipients, stabilizers, antioxidants and other agents known in the art. In general, any route of administration by which the peptides of invention are introduced across an epidermal layer of cells may be employed. Administration means may thus include administration through mucous membranes, buccal administration, oral administration, dermal administration, inhalation administration, nasal administration, urethral administration, vaginal administration, and the like.\n\n\n6.6 Therapeutically Effective Amount.\n\n\nIn general, the actual quantity of cyclic peptide of the present invention administered to a patient will vary between fairly wide ranges depending upon the mode of administration, the formulation used, and the response desired. The dosage for treatment is administration, by any of the foregoing means or \n\n any other means known in the art, of an amount sufficient to bring about the desired therapeutic effect. Thus a therapeutically effective amount includes an amount of a peptide or pharmaceutical composition of the present invention that is sufficient to therapeutically alleviate sexual dysfunction in a patient, or to prevent or delay onset or recurrence of the sexual dysfunction. In general, the cyclic peptides of the present invention are highly active. For example, the cyclic peptide can be administered at about 0.1 , 0.5, 1 , 5, 50, 100, 500, 1000 or 5000 μg/kg body weight, depending on the specific peptide selected, the desired therapeutic response, the route of administration, the formulation and other factors known to those of skill in the art. 7.0 Peptides of the Present Invention. In one aspect, the invention provides a cyclic heptapeptide which contains a core sequence derived from His-Phe-Arg-Trp within the cyclic portion, and where the amino acid in the first position is outside the cyclic portion and has a side chain including at least one primary amine, guanidine or urea group. Representative amino acids which may be in the first position include, but are not limited to, Dap, Dab, Orn, Lys, Cit or Arg. The core sequence derived from His-Phe-Arg-Trp will include unsubstituted D-Phe, D-NaI 1 or D-\n\n\nNaI 2 in the Phe position, but typically a variety of amino acids may be utilitized for the remaining amino acids in the core sequence. In general, the His position may be a substituted or unsubstituted Pro, or may be an amino acid with a side chain including at least one primary amine, secondary amine, alkyl, cycloalkyl, cycloheteroalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, alcohol, ether, sulfide, sulfone, sufoxide, carbomyl or carboxyl. The Arg position may be a substituted or unsubstituted Pro, or may be an amino acid with a side chain including at least one primary amine, secondary amine, guanidine, urea, alkyl, cycloalkyl, cycloheteroalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, or ether. The Trp position may be an amino acid with a side chain including at least one substituted or unsubstituted aryl or heteroaryl.\n\n\nThe peptides encompassed within formulas (I) and (II) contain one or more asymmetric elements such as stereogenic centers, stereogenic axes and the like, so that the peptides encompassed within formula (I) can exist in different stereoisomeric forms. For both specific and generically described peptides, including the peptides encompassed within formulas (I) and (II), all forms of isomers at all chiral or other isomeric centers, including enantiomers and diastereomers, are intended to be covered herein. The peptides of the invention each include multiple chiral centers, and may be used as a racemic mixture or an enantiomerically enriched mixture, in addition to use of the peptides of the invention in enantiopure preparations. Typically, the peptides of the invention will be synthesized with the use of chirally pure reagents, such as specified L- or D-amino acids, using reagents, conditions and methods such that enantiomeric purity is maintained, but it is possible and contemplated that racemic mixtures may be made. Such racemic mixtures may optionally be separated using well-known techniques and an individual enantiomer may be used alone. In cases and under specific conditions of temperature, solvents and pH wherein peptides may exist in tautomeric forms, each tautomeric form is contemplated as being included within this invention whether existing in equilibrium or predominantly in one form. Thus a single enantiomer of a peptide of formula (I), which is an optically active form, can be obtained by asymmetric synthesis, synthesis from optically pure precursors, or by resolution of the racemates. The invention is further intended to include prodrugs of the present peptides, which on administration undergo chemical conversion by metabolic processes before becoming active \n\n pharmacological peptides. In general, such prodrugs will be functional derivatives of the present peptides, which are readily convertible in vivo into a peptide of formulas (I) or (II). Prodrugs are any covalently bonded compounds, which release the active parent peptide drug of formulas (I) or (II) in vivo. Conventional procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable prodrug derivatives are described, for example, in Design of Prodrugs, ed. H. Bundgaard, Elsevier, 1985. Typical examples of prodrugs have biologically labile protecting groups on a functional moiety, such as for example by esterification of hydroxyl, carboxyl or amino functions. Thus by way of example and not limitation, a prodrug includes peptides of formula (I) wherein an ester prodrug form is employed, such as, for example, lower alkyl esters of an R group of formula (I), such as where R is -OH, which lower alkyl esters may include from 1- 8 carbons in an alkyl radical or aralkyl esters which have 6-12 carbons in an aralkyl radical. Broadly speaking, prodrugs include compounds that can be oxidized, reduced, aminated, deaminated, hydroxylated, dehydroxylated, hydrolyzed, dehydrolyzed, alkylated, dealkylated, acylated, deacylated, phosphorylated or dephosphorylated to produce an active parent peptide drug of formula (I) in vivo.\n\n\nThe subject invention also includes peptides which are identical to those recited in formula (I), but for the fact that one or more atoms depicted in formula (I) are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen, such as \n2\nH, \n3\nH, \n13\nC, \n14\nC, \n15\nN, \n18\nO and \n17\nO, respectively. Peptides of the present invention and pharmaceutically acceptable salts or solvates of said compounds which contain the aforementioned isotopes and/or other isotopes of other atoms are within the scope of this invention.\n\n\nCertain isotopically-labeled compounds of the present invention, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as \n3\nH and \n14\nC are incorporated, may have use in a variety of assays, such as in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Substitution with heavier isotopes, such as substitution of one or more hydrogen atoms with deuterium (\n2\nH), can provide pharmacological advantages in some instances, including increased metabolic stability, lsotopically labeled peptides of formula (I) can generally be prepared by substituting an isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent.\n\n\n8.0 Tests and Assays Employed in Evaluation of the Peptides of the Present Invention. The melanocortin receptor-specific peptides of the present invention of this invention may be tested by a variety of assay systems and animal models to determine binding, functional status and efficacy.\n\n\n8.1 Competitive Inhibition Assay using [l\n125\n]-NDP-α-MSH.\n\n\nA competitive inhibition binding assay is performed using membrane homogenates prepared from HEK-293 cells that express recombinant hMC4-R, hMC3-R, or hMC5-R, and from B-16 mouse melanoma cells (containing endogenous MC1-R). In some instances, HEK-293 cells that express recombinant hMC1-R were employed. In the examples that follow, all MC3-R, MC4-R and MC5-R values are for human recombinant receptors. MC1-R values are for B-16 mouse melanoma cells, unless the heading is \"hMC1-R\", in which case the value is for human recombinant MC1-R. Assays were performed in 96 well GF/B Millipore multiscreen filtration plates (MAFB NOB10) pre-coated with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (Fraction V). Membrane homogenates were incubated with 0.2nM (for hMC4-R) 0.4 nM (for\n\n\nMC3-R and MC5-R) or 0.1 nM (for mouse B16 MC1-R or hMC1-R) [l\n125\n]-NDP-α-MSH (Perkin Elmer) and \n\n increasing concentrations of test peptides of the present invention in buffer containing 25 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) with 100 mM NaCI, 2 mM CaCI\n2\n, 2 mM MgCI\n2\n, 0.3 mM 1 ,10-phenanthroline, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin. After incubation for 60 minutes at 37° C, the assay mixture was filtered and the membranes washed three times with ice-cold buffer. Filters were dried and counted in a gamma counter for bound radioactivity. Non-specific binding was measured by inhibition of binding of [l\n125\n]-NDP-α-MSH in the presence of 1 μM NDP-α-MSH. Maximal specific binding (100%) was defined as the difference in radioactivity (cpm) bound to cell membranes in the absence and presence of 1 μM NDP-α-MSH. Radioactivity (cpm) obtained in the presence of test compounds was normalized with respect to 100% specific binding to determine the percent inhibition of [l\n125\n]-NDP-α-MSH binding. Each assay was conducted in triplicate and the actual mean values are described, with results less than 0% reported as 0%. Ki values for test peptides of the present invention were determined using Graph-Pad Prism® curve-fitting software.\n\n\n8.2 Competitive Binding Assay Using Eu-NDP-α-MSH\n\n\nAlternatively, a competitive inhibition binding assay was performed employing Eu-NDP-α-MSH (PerkinElmer Life Sciences catalog No. AD0225) with determination by time-resolved fluorometry (TRF) of the lanthanide chelate. In comparison studies with [l\n125\n]-NDP-α-MSH, the same values, within experimental error ranges, were obtained for percent inhibition and Ki. Typically competition experiments to determine Ki values were conducted by incubating membrane homogenates prepared from HEK-293 cells that express recombinant hMC4-R with 9 different concentrations of test compounds of interest and 2 nM of Eu-NDP-α-MSH in a solution containing 25 mM HEPES buffer with 100 mM NaCI, 2 mM CaCI\n2\n, 2 mM MgCI\n2\n and 0.3 mM 1 ,10-phenanthroline. After incubation for 90 minutes at 37°C, the reaction was stopped by filtration over AcroWell 96-well filter plates (Pall Life Sciences). The filter plates were washed 4 times with 200 μL of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. DELFIA Enhancement solution (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to each well. The plates were incubated on a shaker for 15 minutes and read at 340 nm excitation and 615 nm emission wavelengths. Each assay was conducted in duplicate and mean values were utilized. Ki values were determined by curve-fitting with Graph-Pad Prism® software using a one-site fixed-slope competition binding model.\n\n\n8.3 Competitive Binding Assay using [I\n125\nJ-AgRP (83-132).\n\n\nCompetitive binding studies using [I\n125\nJ-AgRP (83-132) are carried out using membrane homogenates isolated from cells that express hMC4-R. The assays were performed in 96-well GF/B Millipore multiscreen filtration plates (MAFB NOB10) pre-coated with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (Fraction V). The assay mixture contained 25 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) with 100 mM NaCI, 2 mM CaCI\n2\n, 2 mM MgCI\n2\n, 0.3 mM 1 ,10-phenanthroline, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, membrane homogenates, radioligand [I\n125\nJ-AgRP (83-132) (Perkin Elmer) and increasing concentrations of peptides of the present invention in a total volume of 200 μL. Binding was measured at radioligand concentrations of 0.2 nM. After incubating for 1 hour at 37° C, the reaction mixture was filtered and washed with assay buffer containing 500 mM NaCI. The dried discs were punched out from the plate and counted on a gamma counter. Ki values for test peptides of the present invention were determined using Graph-Pad Prism\n®\n curve-fitting software. \n\n 8.4 Assay for Agonist Activity.\n\n\nAccumulation of intracellular cAMP was examined as a measure of the ability of the peptides of the present invention to elicit a functional response in HEK-293 cells that express MC4-R. Confluent HEK-293 cells that express recombinant hMC4-R were detached from culture plates by incubation in enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer. Dispersed cells were suspended in Earle's Balanced Salt Solution containing 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mM MgCI\n2\n, 1 mM glutamine, 0.5% albumin and 0.3 mM 3-isobutyl- 1-methyl-xanthine (IBMX), a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. The cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 0.5 x 10\n5\n cells per well and pre-incubated for 10 minutes. Cells were exposed for 15 minutes at 37° C to peptides of the present invention dissolved in DMSO (final DMSO concentration of 1 %) at a concentration range of 0.05 - 5000 nM in a total assay volume of 200 μl_. NDP-α-MSH was used as the reference agonist. cAMP levels were determined by an HTRF® cAMP cell-based assay system from Cisbio Bioassays utilizing cryptate-labeled anti-cAMP and d2-labeled cAMP, with plates read on a Perkin- Elmer Victor plate reader at 665 and 62OnM. Data analysis was performed by nonlinear regression analysis with Graph-Pad Prism\n®\n software. The maximum efficacies of the test peptides of the present invention were compared to that achieved by the reference melanocortin agonist NDP-αMSH.\n\n\n8.5 Food Intake and Body Weight Change.\n\n\nChange in food intake and body weight was evaluated for selected peptides administered by intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous injection routes. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from Hilltop Lab Animals, Inc. (Scottsdale, PA) or other vendors. Animals were individually housed in conventional polystyrene hanging cages and maintained on a controlled 12 hour on/off light cycle. Water and pelleted food was provided ad libitum. The rats were dosed IV with vehicle or selected peptides (0.3 to 1.0 mg/kg), or dosed subcutaneously with vehicle or selected peptides (doses up to 30 mg/kg). The changes in body weight and food intake for the 24 hour period after dosing was determined. The changes in body weight and food intake for the 48 hour and 72 hour periods after dosing can also be measured to determine reversal of changes in body weight and food intake effects back to baseline levels.\n\n\n8.6 Induction of Penile Erection.\n\n\nThe ability of peptides of the present invention to induce penile erection (PE) in male rats were evaluated with selected peptides. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250-300 g were kept on a 12 hour on/off light cycle with food and water ad libitum. All behavioral studies were performed between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. Groups of 6-8 rats were administered peptides at a variety of doses via an IV route.\n\n\nImmediately after treatment, rats were placed into individual polystyrene cages (27 cm long, 16 cm wide, and 25 cm high) for behavioral observation, typically by remote video monitoring. Rats are observed for one hour, and the number of yawns, grooming bouts and PEs are recorded in 10-minute bins.\n\n\n9.0 Examples. The invention is further exemplified by the following non-limiting examples:\n\n\n9.1 Peptides of the following structures were synthesized by the general methods described above, and averaged MC4-R Ki values for peptides were determined as indicated. All Ki values were determined using [l\n125\n]-NDP-α-MSH unless marked with an \"\n*\n\", in which event the values were determined using Eu-NDP-α-MSH. Kit values marked \"ND\" were not determined. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.2 The peptides of Nos. 126 through 129 were tested in functional assays. The peptide No. 126 was determined to be an agonist at MC4-R, with intrinsic activity of 101 % at MC4-R where NDP-α- MSH is 100%, and with an EC\n50\n of 0.047 nM (average of three studies). The peptide No. 127 was determined to be an agonist at MC4-R, with intrinsic activity of 98% at MC4-R where NDP-α-MSH is\n\n\n100%, and with an EC\n50\n of 0.06 nM (average of two studies). The peptide No. 128 was determined to be an agonist at MC4-R, with intrinsic activity of 95% at MC4-R where NDP-α-MSH is 100%, and with an EC\n50\n of 0.073 nM (average of three studies). The peptide No. 129 was determined to be an agonist at MC4-R, with intrinsic activity of 96% at MC4-R where NDP-α-MSH is 100%, and with an EC\n50\n of 0.065 nM (average of two studies). Thus for the four peptides in the series, EC\n50\n values were on the order of one and one-half-fold to two-fold less that the Ki values.\n\n\n9.3 Peptide No. 1 was evaluated for binding against MC1-R, MC3-R and MC4-R in competitive studies using Eu-labeled NDP-α-MSH, and was found to have a Ki value of 4 nM at MC4-R (average of six studies), a Ki value of 4 nM for MC1-R (average of four studies) and a Ki value of 103 nM for MC3-R (average of five studies). In competitive studies using [l\n125\n]-NDP-α-MSH, peptide No. 1 was found to have a Ki value of 2 nM at MC4-R (one study), 25 nM at MC3-R (one study) and 3 nM at MC1-R (one study). In functional studies, Peptide No. 1 was determined to be an agonist, with intrinsic activity of 91 % at MC4-R where NDP-α-MSH is 100%, and with an EC\n50\n of 1 nM (average of three studies).\n\n\nIn rat feeding studies, using bremelanotide (a non-specific MC4-R agonist of the formula Ac-NIe- cyclo(Asp-His-D-Phe-Arg-Trp-Lys)-OH)) as a positive control, peptide No. 1 was found to reduce food intake and decrease the rate of change in body weight. Using the methods as described above, groups of 8 rats each rats received 1 mg/kg bremelanotide, 0.3 mg/kg of peptide No. 1 , 1 mg/kg of peptide No. 1 or vehicle control. For the 0-2, 0-4, and 0-20 hour periods, the decrease in food consumption in rats receiving either 0.3 or 1 mg/kg of peptide No. 1 was statistically significant compared to control. The 0- 20 hour percent change in body weight was also statistically significant compared to control for the group receiving 1 mg/kg of peptide No. 1. \n\n In rat penile erection studies, again using bremelanotide as a positive control, peptide No. 1 was found to result in a statistically significant increase, compared to vehicle, in observed spontaneous erections when administered IV at doses of 0.3 or 1 mg/kg.\n\n\n9.4 Peptide No. 16 was evaluated for binding against MC1-R, MC3-R and MC4-R in competitive studies using Eu-labeled NDP-α-MSH, and was found to have a Ki value of 25 nM at MC4-R (average of two studies), a Ki value of 323 nM for MC1-R (one study) and a Ki value of 1055 nM for MC3- R (one study). In functional studies, Peptide No. 16 was determined to be a partial agonist, with intrinsic activity of 42% at MC4-R where NDP-α-MSH is 100%, and with an EC\n50\n of 40 nM (average of five studies). In rat feeding studies, using bremelanotide as a positive control, peptide No. 16 was found to reduce food intake and decrease the rate of change in body weight. Using the methods as described above, groups of 8 rats each rats received 1 mg/kg bremelanotide, 0.3 mg/kg of peptide No. 16, 1 mg/kg of peptide No. 16 or vehicle control. For the 0-2, 0-4, and 0-20 hour periods, the decrease in food consumption in rats receiving 1 mg/kg of peptide No. 16 was statistically significant compared to control, and for the 0-2 and 0-4 hour periods, the decrease in food consumption in rats receiving 0.3 mg/kg of peptide No. 16 was statistically significant compared to control. The 0-20 hour percent change in body weight was also statistically significant compared to control for the group receiving 1 mg/kg of peptide No. 1.\n\n\n9.5 Peptide No. 32 was evaluated for binding against MC1-R and MC4-R in competitive studies using Eu-labeled NDP-α-MSH, and was found to have a Ki value of 24 nM at MC4-R (average of six studies) and a Ki value of 673 nM for MC1-R (average of three studies). In competitive studies using [l\n125\n]-NDP-α-MSH, peptide No. 32 was found to have a Ki value of 13 nM at MC4-R (two studies), 340 nM at MC3-R (one study) and 133 nM at MC1-R (two studies). In functional studies, Peptide No. 32 was determined to be an agonist, with intrinsic activity of 98% at MC4-R where NDP-α-MSH is 100%, and with an EC\n50\n of 17 nM (average of eight studies).\n\n\nIn rat penile erection studies, again using bremelanotide as a positive control, but with subcutaneous administration of peptide No. 32, peptide No. 32 was observed to result in an increase in observed spontaneous erections when administered at doses of 1 , 3 or 10 mg/kg, but less than observed spontaneous erections observed with 1.0 mg/kg bremelanotide administered IV. Although the invention has been described in detail with particular reference to these preferred embodiments, other embodiments can achieve the same results. Variations and modifications of the present invention will be obvious to those skilled in the art and it is intended to cover all such modifications and equivalents.
