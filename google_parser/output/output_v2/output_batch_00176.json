The disclosure of each application is hereby expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nPre-proglucagon is a 158 amino acid precursor polypeptide that is processed in different tissues to form a number of different proglucagon-derived peptides, including glucagon, glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP-I), glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) and oxyntomodulin (OXM), that are involved in a wide variety of physiological functions, including glucose homeostasis, insulin secretion, gastric emptying, and intestinal growth, as well as the regulation of food intake. Glucagon is a 29-amino acid peptide that corresponds to amino acids 33 through 61 of pre-proglucagon, while GLP-I is produced as a 37-amino acid peptide that corresponds to amino acids 72 through 108 of pre- proglucagon.\n\n\nWhen blood glucose begins to fall, glucagon, a hormone produced by the pancreas, signals the liver to break down glycogen and release glucose, causing blood glucose levels to rise toward a normal level. GLP-I has different biological activities compared to glucagon. Its actions include stimulation of insulin synthesis and secretion, inhibition of glucagon secretion, and inhibition of food intake. GLP-I has been shown to reduce hyperglycemia (elevated glucose levels) in diabetics. Exendin-4, a peptide from lizard venom that shares about 50% amino acid identity with GLP-I , activates\n'\n the GLP-I receptor and likewise has been shown to reduce hyperglycemia in diabetics. Glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) is a 42-amino acid gastrointestinal regulatory peptide that stimulates insulin secretion from pancreatic beta\n\n\nl l60014vl \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\ncells in the presence of glucose. It is derived by proteolytic processing from a 133-amino acid precursor, preproGIP.\n\n\nSUMMARY As disclosed herein, glucagon peptides are provided that are analogs of native glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 1) and that exhibit GIP activity. The invention also provides methods of using such peptides.\n\n\nNative glucagon does not activate the GIP receptor, and normally has about 1% of the activity of native-GLP-1 at the GLP-I receptor. Modifications to the native glucagon sequence described herein produce glucagon peptides that can exhibit potent glucagon activity equivalent to or better than the activity of native glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 1), potent GIP activity equivalent to or better than the activity of native GIP (SEQ ID NO: 4), and/or potent GLP-I activity equivalent to or better than the activity of native GLP-I . GLP-I (7-36) amide (SEQ ID NO: 3) or GLP-I (7-37) (acid) (SEQ ID NO: 2) are biologically potent forms of GLP-I , that demonstrate essentially equivalent activity at the GLP-I receptor.\n\n\nThe data described herein show that peptides having both GIP activity and GLP-I activity are particularly advantageous for inducing weight loss or preventing weight gain, as well as for treating hyperglycemia, including diabetes. In vivo data disclosed herein demonstrate that the combination of GIP agonist activity with GLP-I agonist activity produces a greater effect on weight reduction than GLP-I alone. This activity is particularly unexpected in view of teachings in the art that antagonizing GIP is desirable for reducing daily food intake and body weight, and increasing insulin sensitivity and energy expenditure. (Irwin et al., Diabetologia 50: 1532-1540 (2007); and Althage et al., J Biol Chem, e-publication on April 17, 2008).\n\n\nThus, in one aspect, the invention provides methods for inducing weight loss or preventing weight gain, which involve administering to a patient in need thereof an effective amount of a compound, e.g. a glucagon peptide, that exhibits activity at both the GIP receptor and the GLP-I receptor, and that optionally also exhibits activity at the glucagon receptor. Such compounds include the GIP/GLP- 1 co-agonists and glucagon/GIP/GLP-1 tri-agonists described herein. \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nIncreased activity at the GIP receptor is provided by an amino acid modification at position 1. For example, His at position 1 is substituted with a large, aromatic amino acid, optionally Tyr, Phe, Trp, amino-Phe, nitro-Phe, chloro-Phe, sulfo-Phe, 4-pyridyl- AIa, methyl-Tyr, or 3-amino Tyr. Increased activity at the GIP receptor is provided by modifications that stabilize the alpha helix structure of the C-terminal portion (amino acids 12-29) of the glucagon peptide or analog thereof. For example, an intramolecular bridge can be formed by a covalent bond between the side chains of two amino acids at positions i and i+4 or between positions j and j+3, or between positions k and k+7. In exemplary embodiments, the bridge is between positions 12 and 16, 16 and 20, 20 and 24, 24 and 28, or 17 and 20. In other embodiments, non-covalent interactions such as salt bridges can be formed between positively and negatively charged amino acids at these positions. Alternatively, for example, stabilization of the alpha helix structure in the C-terminal portion of the glucagon peptide (around amino acids 12-29) is achieved through purposeful introduction of one or more α, α-disubstituted amino acids at positions that retain the desired activity. In some embodiments, one, two, three, four or more of positions 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24 or 29 of a glucagon peptide or analog thereof is substituted with an α, α-disubstituted amino acid. For example, substitution of position 16 of a glucagon peptide or analog thereof with amino iso-butyric acid (AIB) provides a stabilized alpha helix in the absence of a salt bridge or lactam. Such peptides are considered herein as a peptide lacking an intramolecular bridge. In specific aspects, stabilization of the alpha-helix is accomplished by introducing one or more α, α-disubstituted amino acids without introduction of a covalent intramolecular bridge, e.g., a lactam bridge, a disulfide bridge. Such peptides are considered herein as a peptide lacking a covalent intramolecular bridge. In some embodiments, one, two, three or more of positions 16, 20, 21 or 24 are substituted with AIB.\n\n\nIncreased activity at the GIP receptor is provided by amino acid modifications at positions 27 and/or 28, and optionally at position 29. For example, the Met at position 27 is substituted with a large aliphatic amino acid, optionally Leu, the Asn at position 28 is substituted with a small aliphatic amino acid, optionally Ala, and the Thr at position 29 is substituted with a small aliphatic amino acid, optionally GIy. \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nIncreased activity at the GIP receptor is also provided by an amino acid modification at position 12. For example, position 12 is substituted with a large, aliphatic, nonpolar amino acid, optionally He.\n\n\nIncreased activity at the GIP receptor is also provided by an amino acid modification at positions 17 and/or 18. For example, position 17 is substituted with a polar residue, optionally GIn, and position 18 is substituted with a small aliphatic amino acid, optionally Ala.\n\n\nIncreased activity at the glucagon receptor is provided by an amino acid modification at position 16 of native glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 1) as described herein. Reduced, maintained, or increased activity at the glucagon receptor is provided, e.g., by an amino acid modification at position 3 as described herein.\n\n\nRestoration of glucagon activity which has been reduced by amino acid modifications at positions 1 and/or 2 is provided by modifications that stabilize the alpha helix structure of the C-terminal portion (amino acids 12-29) of the glucagon peptide or analog thereof. For example, an intramolecular bridge can be formed by a covalent bond between the side chains of two amino acids at positions i and i+4 or between positions j and j+3, or between positions k and k+7. In other embodiments, non-covalent interactions such as salt bridges can be formed between positively and negatively charged amino acids at these positions. In yet other embodiments, one or more α, α-disubstituted amino acids are inserted or substituted into this C-terminal portion (amino acids 12-29) at positions that retain the desired activity. For example, one, two, three or all of positions 16, 20, 21 or 24 are substituted with an α, α-disubstituted amino acid, e.g., AIB.\n\n\nIncreased activity at the GLP-I receptor is provided by replacing the carboxylic acid of the C-terminal amino acid with a charge-neutral group, such as an amide or ester. Increased activity at the GLP-I receptor is provided by modifications that stabilize alpha-helix structure in the C-terminal portion (around amino acids 12-29) of the glucagon peptide or analog thereof. In some embodiments, an intramolecular bridge can be formed by a covalent bond between the side chains of two amino acids at positions i and i+4 or between positions j and j+3, or between positions k and k+7. In other embodiments, non-covalent interactions such as salt bridges can be formed between positively and negatively charged amino acids at these positions. In yet other \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nembodiments, one or more α, α-disubstituted amino acids are inserted or substituted into this C-terminal portion (amino acids 12-29) at positions that retain the desired activity. For example, one, two, three or all of positions 16, 20, 21 or 24 are substituted with an α, α-disubstituted amino acid, e.g., AIB. Increased activity at the GLP-I receptor is provided by an amino acid modification at position 20 as described herein.\n\n\nIncreased activity at the GLP-I receptor is provided by adding a C-terminal extension peptide such as GPSSGAPPPS (SEQ ID NO: 95) or XGPSSGAPPPS (SEQ ID NO: 96) to the C-terminus. GLP-I activity in such analogs can be further increased by modifying the amino acid at position 18, 28 or 29, or at position 18 and 29, as described herein.\n\n\nA further modest increase in GLP-I potency is provided by modifying the amino acid at position 10 to be a large, aromatic amino acid residue, optionally Trp.\n\n\nReduced activity at the GLP-I receptor is provided, e.g., by an amino acid modification at position 7, a deletion of the amino acid(s) C-terminal to the amino acid at position 27 or 28, yielding a 27- or 28-amino acid peptide, or a combination thereof, as described herein.\n\n\nPreservation of activity after pegylation is provided by the addition of GPSSGAPPPS (SEQ ID NO: 95) to the C-terminus. As demonstrated herein, maintained or increased activity at each of the glucagon receptor, GLP-I receptor, and GIP receptor (in comparison to a lactam-containing, GIP- active, glucagon-based analog) is provided by (i) an amino acid substitution of Ser at position 16 with an amino acid of Formula IV: H\n2\nN OH\n\n\n \n\n [Formula IV], wherein n is 1 to 16, or 1 to 10, or 1 to 7, or 1 to 6, or 2 to 6, or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5, each of Ri and R\n2\n is independently selected from the group consisting of H, Ci-Ci\n8\n alkyl, (Ci-Ci\n8\n\n32993-208847\n\n\nalkyl)OH, (C\n1\n-C\n18\n 811CyI)NH\n21\n (C\n1\n-C\n18\n alkyl)SH, (C\n0\n-C\n4\n alkyl)(C\n3\n-C\n6\n)cycloalkyl, (C\n0\n-C\n4\n alkyl)(C\n2\n-C\n5\n heterocyclic), (C\n0\n-C\n4\n alkyl)(C\n6\n-C\n10\n aryl)R\n7\n, and (C\n1\n-C\n4\n alkyl)(C\n3\n-C\n9\n heteroaryl), wherein R\n7\n is H or OH, and the side chain of the amino acid of Formula IV comprises a free amino group, and (ii) an amino acid substitution of the GIn at position 20 with an alpha, alpha-disubstituted amino acid, e.g., AIB. In some embodiments, the amino acid at position 16 is Lys and the amino acid at position 20 is AIB.\n\n\nThe activity at each of the glucagon receptor, GLP-I receptor, and GIP receptor of the analog comprising an amino acid of Formula IV at position 16 and an alpha, alpha di-substituted amino acid at position 20 can be further enhanced by extending the length of the peptide, e.g. by fusion to a C-terminal extension peptide, e.g. of about 1-21 , about 9 to 21 , about 6-18, about 9-12, or about 10 or 1 1 amino acids in length. In some embodiments, the C-terminus is extended by fusion to GPSSGAPPPS (SEQ ID NO: 95) or XGPSSGAPPPS (SEQ ID NO: 96), wherein X is GIy or a small, aliphatic or non-polar or slightly polar amino acid. In alternative embodiments, the C-terminus is extended by fusion to GPSSGAPPPS (SEQ ID NO: 95) and 1 -11 amino acids (e.g., 1-5, or 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1 1 amino acids) are fused to the C-terminus of GPSSGAPPPS (SEQ ID NO: 95). The 1-1 1 amino acids at the C-terminus of GPSSGAPPPS (SEQ ID NO: 95) can comprise, for example, one or more small aliphatic amino acids, such as Ala or GIy. In this regard, the C-terminal extension can be, for example, GPSSGAPPPSX\nm\n, wherein m is 1 to 1 1 (e.g., 1 to 5) and X is Ala or GIy. Alternatively, the 1 to 1 1 (e.g., 1 to 5) amino acids fused to the C-terminus of SEQ ID NO: 95 may be a combination of different small aliphatic amino acids. For example, the 1 to 1 1 (e.g., 1 to 5) amino acids may be a combination of Ala and GIy residues.\n\n\nEnhancement of activity at each of the glucagon, GLP-I , and GIP receptors of a GIP-active, glucagon-based analog, including an analog comprising an amino acid of\n\n\nFormula IV at position 16 and an alpha, alpha disubstituted amino acid at position 20, can furthermore be achieved upon acylation or alkylation of an amino acid located within a C-terminal extension or at the C-terminal amino acid (e.g., an amino acid which is added to the C-terminus of the C-terminal extension). The acylation or alkylation can be of an amino acid located at, for example, any of positions 30, 31 , 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, and 50. In some embodiments, the amino acid \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nwhich is acylated or alkylated is located at position 37, 38, 39, 40, 41 , 42, or 43. In some embodiments, the acylated or alkylated amino acid is a Lys which is attached to an acyl or alkyl group, e.g. C10-C22. In certain embodiments, the Lys is located C-terminal to a C-terminal extension consisting of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 95, such that the Lys is located at position 40 of the analog. Optionally, acylated, C-terminally extended peptides are also pegylated, e.g. at position 24.\n\n\nEnhancement of the activity at each of the glucagon, GLP-I, and GIP receptors of a GIP-active, glucagon-based analog can moreover be achieved by acylation or alkylation of an amino acid via a spacer (e.g., an amino acid, dipeptide, tripeptide, hydrophilic bifunctional spacer, hydrophobic bifunctional spacer). In some embodiments, the GIP- active, glucagon-based analog comprises an acyl or alkyl group via a spacer, which spacer is attached to the side chain of the amino acid at position 10 or position 40 of the analog. In other embodiments, the analog comprises a C-terminal extension of 1 to 21 amino acids C-terminal to the amino acid at position 29 and the spacer, which is covalently attached to an acyl or alkyl group, is attached to an amino acid of the extension at a position corresponding to one of positions 37-43 relative to SEQ ID NO: 1. In certain embodiments, the spacer is 3 to 10 atoms in length. In specific aspects, the total length of the spacer and acyl or alkyl group is about 14 to about 28 atoms in length. Suitable spacers for purposes of increasing activity at one or more of the glucagon, GLP- 1 , and GIP receptors are further described herein.\n\n\nAny of the modifications described above which increase or decrease GIP activity, which increase or decrease glucagon receptor activity, and which increase or decrease GLP-I receptor activity can be applied individually or in combination. Any of the modifications described above can also be combined with other modifications that confer other desirable properties, such as increased solubility and/or stability and/or duration of action. Alternatively, any of the modifications described above can be combined with other modifications that do not substantially affect solubility or stability or activity. Exemplary modifications include but are not limited to:\n\n\n(A) Improving solubility, for example, by introducing one, two, three or more charged amino acid(s) to the C-terminal portion of native glucagon, preferably at a position C-terminal to position 27. Such a charged amino acid can be introduced by \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nsubstituting a native amino acid with a charged amino acid, e.g. at positions 28 or 29, or alternatively by adding a charged amino acid, e.g. after position 27, 28 or 29. In exemplary embodiments, one, two, three or all of the charged amino acids are negatively charged. In other embodiments, one, two, three or all of the charged amino acids are positively charged. Such modifications increase solubility, e.g. provide at least 2-fold, 5- fold, 10-fold, 15-fold, 25-fold, 30-fold or greater solubility relative to native glucagon at a given pH between about 5.5 and 8, e.g., pH 7, when measured after 24 hours at 25\n0\nC.\n\n\n(B) Increasing solubility and duration of action or half-life in circulation by addition of a hydrophilic moiety such as a polyethylene glycol chain, as described herein, e.g. at position 16, 17, 20, 21 , 24 or 29, within a C-terminal extension, or at the C- terminal amino acid of the peptide,\n\n\n(C) Increasing solubility and/or duration of action or half-life in circulation and/or delaying the onset of action by acylation or alkylation of the glucagon peptide, as described herein; (D) Increasing duration of action or half-life in circulation through introducing resistance to dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) cleavage by modification of the amino acid at position 1 or 2 as described herein.\n\n\n(E) Increasing stability by modification of the Asp at position 15, for example, by deletion or substitution with glutamic acid, homoglutamic acid, cysteic acid or homocysteic acid. Such modifications can reduce degradation or cleavage at a pH within the range of 5.5 to 8, for example, retaining at least 75%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99%, up to 100% of the original peptide after 24 hours at 25°C. Such modifications reduce cleavage of the peptide bond between Aspl 5-Serl6.\n\n\n(F) Increasing stability by modification of the Ser at position 16, for example by substitution with Thr or AIB. Such modifications also reduce cleavage of the peptide bond between Aspl 5-Serl6.\n\n\n(G) Increasing stability by modification of the methionine at position 27, for example, by substitution with leucine or norleucine. Such modifications can reduce oxidative degradation. Stability can also be increased by modification of the GIn at position 20 or 24, e.g. by substitution with Ala, Ser, Thr, or AIB. Such modifications can reduce degradation that occurs through deamidation of GIn. Stability can be increased by \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nmodification of Asp at position 21, e.g. by substitution with GIu. Such modifications can reduce degradation that occurs through dehydration of Asp to form a cyclic succinimide intermediate followed by isomerization to iso-aspartate.\n\n\n(H) Non-conservative or conservative substitutions, additions or deletions that do not substantially affect activity, for example, conservative substitutions at one or more of positions 2, 5, 9, 10, 1 1, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 , 24, 27, 28 or 29; substitution of one or more of these positions with Ala; deletion of amino acids at one or more of positions 27, 28 or 29; or deletion of amino acid 29 optionally combined with a C-terminal amide or ester in place of the C-terminal carboxylic acid group; substitution of Lys at position 12 with Arg; substitution of Tyr at position 10 with VaI or Phe;\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the glucagon peptides described herein exhibit an EC50 for GIP receptor activation activity of about 10OnM or less, or about 75, 50, 25, 10, 8, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1 nM or less.

In certain embodiments, the linker is PEG, e.g., a 5 kDa PEG, 20 kDa PEG. In some embodiments, the linker is a disulfide bond. For example, each monomer of the dimer may comprise a Cys residue (e.g., a terminal or internally positioned Cys) and the sulfur atom of each Cys residue participates in the formation of the disulfide bond. In some aspects of the invention, the monomers are connected via terminal amino acids (e.g., N-terminal or C-terminal), via internal amino acids, or via a terminal amino acid of at least one monomer and an internal amino acid of at least one other monomer.

A conjugate moiety may be covalently linked to any of the glucagon peptides described herein, including a dimer, trimer or higher order multimer. Any of the modifications described herein which increase glucagon receptor activity, retain partial glucagon receptor activity, improve solubility, increase stability, or reduce degradation can be applied to glucagon peptides individually or in combination. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptides are soluble at a concentration of at least 1 mg/mL at a pH between 6 and 8, or between 6 and 9, or between 7 and 9 (e.g. pH 7), and optionally retain at least 95% of the original peptide (e.g. 5% or less of the original peptide is degraded or cleaved) after 24 hours at 25\n°\nC.\n\n\nSterile pharmaceutical compositions comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent and kits comprising devices are provided.

Each value or range of values preceded by the term \"about\" is also intended to encompass the embodiment of the stated absolute value or range of values.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"pharmaceutically acceptable carrier\" includes any of the standard pharmaceutical carriers, such as a phosphate buffered saline solution, water, emulsions such as an oil/water or water/oil emulsion, and various types of wetting agents. The term also encompasses any of the agents approved by a regulatory agency of the US Federal government or listed in the US Pharmacopeia for use in animals, including humans. As used herein the term \"pharmaceutically acceptable salt\" refers to salts of compounds that retain the biological activity of the parent compound, and which are not \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nbiologically or otherwise undesirable. Many of the compounds disclosed herein are capable of forming acid and/or base salts by virtue of the presence of amino and/or carboxyl groups or groups similar thereto.\n\n\nPharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts can be prepared from inorganic and organic bases. Salts derived from inorganic bases, include by way of example only, sodium, potassium, lithium, ammonium, calcium and magnesium salts. Salts derived from organic bases include, but are not limited to, salts of primary, secondary and tertiary amines.\n\n\nPharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts may be prepared from inorganic and organic acids. Salts derived from inorganic acids include hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like. Salts derived from organic acids include acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, malic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluene-sulfonic acid, salicylic acid, and the like.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"treating\" includes prophylaxis of the specific disorder or condition, or alleviation of the symptoms associated with a specific disorder or condition and/or preventing or eliminating said symptoms. For example, as used herein the term \"treating diabetes\" will refer in general to altering glucose blood levels in the direction of normal levels and may include increasing or decreasing blood glucose levels depending on a given situation.\n\n\nAs used herein an \"effective\" amount or a \"therapeutically effective amount\" of a glucagon peptide refers to a nontoxic but sufficient amount of the peptide to provide the desired effect. For example one desired effect would be the prevention or treatment of hypoglycemia, as measured, for example, by an increase in blood glucose level. An alternative desired effect for the glucagon peptides of the present disclosure would include treating hyperglycemia, e.g., as measured by a change in blood glucose level closer to normal, or inducing weight loss/preventing weight gain, e.g., as measured by reduction in body weight, or preventing or reducing an increase in body weight, or normalizing body fat distribution. The amount that is \"effective\" will vary from subject to subject, depending on the age and general condition of the individual, mode of \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nadministration, and the like. Thus, it is not always possible to specify an exact \"effective amount.\" However, an appropriate \"effective\" amount in any individual case may be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using routine experimentation.\n\n\nThe term, \"parenteral\" means not through the alimentary canal but by some other route such as subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraspinal, or intravenous.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"purified\" and like terms relate to the isolation of a molecule or compound in a form that is substantially free of contaminants normally associated with the molecule or compound in a native or natural environment. As used herein, the term \"purified\" does not require absolute purity; rather, it is intended as a relative definition. The term \"purified polypeptide\" is used herein to describe a polypeptide which has been separated from other compounds including, but not limited to nucleic acid molecules, lipids and carbohydrates.\n\n\nThe term \"isolated\" requires that the referenced material be removed from its original environment (e.g., the natural environment if it is naturally occurring). For example, a naturally-occurring polynucleotide present in a living animal is not isolated, but the same polynucleotide, separated from some or all of the coexisting materials in the natural system, is isolated.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"peptide\" encompasses a sequence of 3 or more amino acids and typically less than 50 amino acids, wherein the amino acids are naturally occurring or non-naturally occurring amino acids. Non-naturally occurring amino acids refer to amino acids that do not naturally occur in vivo but which, nevertheless, can be incorporated into the peptide structures described herein.\n\n\nAs used herein, the terms \"polypeptide\" and \"protein\" are terms that are used interchangeably to refer to a polymer of amino acids, without regard to the length of the polymer. Typically, polypeptides and proteins have a polymer length that is greater than that of \"peptides.\"\n\n\nA \"glucagon peptide\" as used herein includes any peptide comprising, either the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, or any analog of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 , including amino acid substitutions, additions, deletions or post translational modifications (e.g., methylation, acylation, alkylation, ubiquitination, intramolecular covalent bonding such as lactam bridge formation, PEGylation, and the like) of the \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\npeptide, wherein the analog stimulates glucagon or GLP-I or GIP receptor activity, e.g., as measured by cAMP production using the assay described in Example 16.\n\n\nThe term \"glucagon agonist\" refers to a complex comprising a glucagon peptide that stimulates glucagon receptor activity, e.g., as measured by cAMP production using the assay described in Example 16.\n\n\nAs used herein an amino acid \"modification\" refers to a substitution, addition or deletion of an amino acid, and includes substitution with or addition of any of the 20 amino acids commonly found in human proteins, as well as atypical or non-narurally occurring amino acids. Throughout the application, all references to a particular amino acid position by number (e.g. position 28) refer to the amino acid at that position in native glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 1) or the corresponding amino acid position in any analogs thereof. For example, a reference herein to \"position 28\" would mean the corresponding position 27 for a glucagon analog in which the first amino acid of SEQ ID NO: 1 has been deleted. Similarly, a reference herein to \"position 28\" would mean the corresponding position 29 for a glucagon analog in which one amino acid has been added before the N-terminus of SEQ ID NO: 1. Commercial sources of atypical amino acids include Sigma-Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI), ChemPep Inc. (Miami, FL), and Genzyme Pharmaceuticals (Cambridge, MA).

For example, an amino acid chain comprising an amide group in place of the terminal carboxylic acid is intended to be encompassed by an amino acid sequence designating the standard amino acids. \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nAs used herein a \"linker\" is a bond, molecule or group of molecules that binds two separate entities to one another. Linkers may provide for optimal spacing of the two entities or may further supply a labile linkage that allows the two entities to be separated from each other. Labile linkages include photocleavable groups, acid-labile moieties, base-labile moieties and enzyme-cleavable groups.\n\n\nAs used herein a \"dimer\" is a complex comprising two subunits covalently bound to one another via a linker. The term dimer, when used absent any qualifying language, encompasses both homodimers and heterodimers.

Other modifications disclosed herein prolong the half-life, increase solubility, or increase stability of the resulting peptide. Yet other modifications \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\ndisclosed herein have no effect on activity, or can be made without destroying the desired activity or activities. Any of the combinations that serve the same purpose (e.g. increasing GIP activity) can be applied individually or in combination. Any of the single or sets of combinations that confer enhanced properties can be applied individually or in combination, e.g. increased GIP and/or GLP-I activity can be combined with increased half-life.\n\n\nIn exemplary embodiments, the glucagon peptide may comprise a total of 1, up to 2, up to 3, up to 4, up to 5, up to 6, up to 7, up to 8, up to 9, or up to 10 amino acid modifications relative to the native glucagon sequence. In some embodiments, such glucagon peptides retain at least 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 or 28 of the naturally occurring amino acids at the corresponding positions in native glucagon (e.g. have 1 -7, 1 -5 or 1-3 modifications relative to naturally occurring glucagon). In related embodiments, 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or more of the amino acid modifications may be non-conservative substitutions, additions or deletions. In some embodiments, 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or more of the amino acid modifications may be conservative substitutions. In some embodiments 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 non-conservative substitutions are carried out at any of positions 2, 5, 7, 10, 1 1 , 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 , 24, 27, 28 or 29 and up to 5 further conservative substitutions are carried out at any of these positions. In some embodiments 1, 2, or 3 amino acid modifications are carried out within amino acids at positions 1-16, and 1 , 2 or 3 amino acid modifications are carried out within amino acids at positions 17-26.\n\n\nModifications that affect GIP activity\n\n\nEnhanced activity at the GIP receptor is provided by an amino acid modification at position 1. For example, His at position 1 is substituted with a large, aromatic amino acid, optionally Tyr, Phe, Trp, amino-Phe, nitro-Phe, chloro-Phe, sulfo-Phe, 4-pyridyl- AIa, methyl-Tyr, or 3-amino Tyr. Unexpectedly, the combination of Tyr at position 1 with stabilization of the alpha helix within the region corresponding to amino acids 12-29 provided a glucagon peptide that activates GIP receptor as well as GLP-I receptor and glucagon receptor. The alpha helix structure can be stabilized by, e.g., formation of a covalent or non-covalent intramolecular bridge, or substitution and/or insertion of amino \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nacids around positions 12-29 with an alpha helix-stabilizing amino acid (e.g., an α,α- disubstituted amino acid).\n\n\nEnhanced activity at the GlP receptor is also provided by amino acid modifications at positions 27 and/or 28, and optionally at position 29. For example, the Met at position 27 is substituted with a large aliphatic amino acid, optionally Leu, the\n\n\nAsn at position 28 is substituted with a small aliphatic amino acid, optionally Ala, and the\n\n\nThr at position 29 is substituted with a small aliphatic amino acid, optionally GIy.\n\n\nSubstitution with LAG at positions 27-29 provides increased GIP activity relative to the native MNT sequence at those positions. Enhanced activity at the GIP receptor is also provided by an amino acid modification at position 12. For example, position 12 is substituted with a large, aliphatic, nonpolar amino acid, optionally He.\n\n\nEnhanced activity at the GIP receptor is also provided by an amino acid modification at positions 17 and/or 18. For example, position 17 is substituted with a polar residue, optionally GIn, and position 18 is substituted with a small aliphatic amino acid, optionally Ala. A substitution with QA at positions 17 and 18 provides increased\n\n\nGIP activity relative to the native RR sequence at those positions.\n\n\nAny of the modifications described above which increase GIP receptor activity can be applied individually or in combination. Combinations of the modifications that increase GIP receptor activity generally provide higher GIP activity than any of such modifications taken alone.\n\n\nModifications that affect glucagon activity\n\n\nIn some embodiments, analogs of glucagon are provided that have enhanced potency and optionally improved solubility and stability. In one embodiment, enhanced glucagon potency is provided by an amino acid modification at position 16 of native glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 1). By way of nonlimiting example, such enhanced potency can be provided by substituting the naturally occurring serine at position 16 with glutamic acid or with another negatively charged amino acid having a side chain with a length of 4 atoms, or alternatively with any one of glutamine, homoglutamic acid, or homocysteic acid, or a charged amino acid having a side chain containing at least one heteroatom, (e.g. \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nN, O, S, P) and with a side chain length of about 4 (or 3-5) atoms. In some embodiments the glucagon peptide retains its original selectivity for the glucagon receptor relative to the GLP-I receptors.\n\n\nGlucagon receptor activity can be reduced by an amino acid modification at position 3, e.g. substitution of the naturally occurring glutamine at position 3, with an acidic, basic, or a hydrophobic amino acid. For example substitution at position 3 with glutamic acid, ornithine, or norleucine substantially reduces or destroys glucagon receptor activity.\n\n\nMaintained or enhanced activity at the glucagon receptor may be achieved by modifying the GIn at position 3 with a glutamine analog. For example, a glucagon peptide comprising a glutamine analog at position 3 may exhibit about 5%, about 10%, about 20%, about 50%, or about 85% or greater the activity of native glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 1) at the glucagon receptor. In some embodiments a glucagon peptide comprising a glutamine analog at position 3 may exhibit about 20%, about 50%, about 75%, about 100%, about 200% or about 500% or greater the activity of a corresponding glucagon peptide having the same amino acid sequence as the peptide comprising the glutamine analog, except for the modified amino acid at position 3 (e.g. SEQ ID NO: 250 or SEQ ID NO: 251) at the glucagon receptor. In some embodiments, a glucagon peptide comprising a glutamine analog at position 3 exhibits enhanced activity at the glucagon receptor, but the enhanced activity is no more than 1000%, 10,000%, 100,000%, or 1,000,000% of the activity of native glucagon or of a corresponding glucagon peptide having the same amino acid sequence as the peptide comprising the glutamine analog, except for the modified amino acid at position 3.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the glutamine analog is a naturally occurring or a non- naturally occurring amino acid comprising a side chain of Structure I, II or III: \n\n\n\n\n\nStructure I\n\n\nO •^-R\n1\n-CH\n2\n-U-Y\n\n\nStructure II \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nO |-R\n1\n-CH\n2\n- S- CH\n2\n-R\n4\n \n\n\nStructure III\n\n\nwherein R\n1\n is C\n0\n.\n3\n alkyl or C\n0-3\n heteroalkyl; R\n2\n is NHR\n4\n or C \n1\n.\n3\n alkyl; R\n3\n is C\n) -3\n alkyl; R\n4\n is H or C, .\n3\n alkyl; X is NH, O, or S; and Y is NHR\n4\n, SR\n3\n, or OR\n3\n. In some embodiments, X is NH or Y is NHR\n4\n. In some embodiments, R\n1\n is C\n0\n-\n2\n alkyl or Ci heteroalkyl. In some embodiments, R\n2\n is NHR\n4\n or Ci alkyl. In some embodiments, R\n4\n is H or C\n1\n alkyl. In exemplary embodiments, an amino acid comprising a side chain of Structure I is provided where, R\n1\n is CH\n2\n-S, X is NH, and R\n2\n is CH\n3\n (acetamidomethyl- cysteine, C(Acm)); R\n1\n is CH\n2\n, X is NH, and R\n2\n is CH\n3\n (acetyldiaminobutanoic acid, Dab(Ac)); R\n1\n is C\n0\n alkyl, X is NH, R\n2\n is NHR\n4\n, and R\n4\n is H (carbamoyldiaminopropanoic acid, Dap(urea)); or R\n1\n is CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n, X is NH, and R\n2\n is CH\n3\n (acetylornithine, Om(Ac)). In exemplary embodiments, an amino acid comprising a side chain of Structure II is provided where, R\n1\n is CH\n2\n, Y is NHR\n4\n, and R\n4\n is CH\n3\n (methylglutamine, Q(Me)); In exemplary embodiments, an amino acid comprising a side chain of Structure III is provided where, R\n1\n is CH\n2\n and R\n4\n is H (methionine-sulfoxide, M(O)); In specific embodiments, the amino acid at position 3 is substituted with Dab(Ac). For example, glucagon agonists can comprise the amino acid sequence of any of SEQ ID NOs: 243- . 248, 250, 251, and 253-256.\n\n\nModifications that affect GLP-I activity Enhanced activity at the GLP-I receptor is provided by replacing the carboxylic acid of the C-terminal amino acid with a charge-neutral group, such as an amide or ester. Enhanced activity at the GLP-I receptor is also provided by stabilizing the alpha- helix structure in the C-terminal portion of glucagon (around amino acids 12-29), e.g., through formation of an intramolecular bridge between the side chains of two amino acids, or substitution and/or insertion of amino acids around positions 12-29 with an alpha helix-stabilizing amino acid (e.g., an α,α-disubstituted amino acid). The side chains of these amino acids can be linked to one another through hydrogen-bonding or ionic interactions, such as the formation of salt bridges, or by covalent bonds. In some embodiments, the bridge is formed between amino acids that are separated by three \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nintervening amino acids, i.e. an amino acid at position \"i\" and an amino acid at position \"i+4\", wherein i is any integer from 12 to 25 (e.g., 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 , 22, 23, 24 or 25). In exemplary embodiments, the side chains of the amino acid pairs 12 and 16, 13 and 17, 16 and 20 , 17 and 21 , 20 and 24 or 24 and 28 (amino acid pairs in which i = 12, 16, 20, or 24) are linked to one another and thus stabilize the glucagon alpha helix.\n\n\nIn other embodiments, the bridge is formed between amino acids that are separated by two intervening amino acids, i.e. an amino acid at position \"j\" and an amino acid at position \"j+3\", wherein j is any integer from 12 to 26 (e.g., 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 , 22, 23, 24, 25 or 26). In exemplary embodiments, j is 17. In further embodiments, the bridge is formed between amino acids that are separated by six intervening amino acids, i.e. an amino acid at position \"k\" and an amino acid at position \"k+7\", wherein k is any integer from 12 to 22 (e.g., 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 or 22). In one embodiment, k is 17. In some embodiments, the bridge or linker is about 8 (or about 7-9) atoms in length, particularly when the bridge is between positions i and i+4. In some embodiments, the bridge or linker is about 6 (or about 5-7) atoms in length, particularly when the bridge is between positions j and j+3.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, intramolecular bridges are formed by (a) substituting the naturally occurring serine at position 16 with glutamic acid or with another negatively charged amino acid having a side chain with a length of 4 atoms, or alternatively with any one of glutamine, homoglutamic acid, or homocysteic acid, or a charged amino acid having a side chain containing at least one heteroatom, (e.g. N, O, S, P) and with a side chain length of about 4 (or 3-5) atoms, and (b) substituting the naturally occurring glutamine at position 20 with another hydrophilic amino acid having a side chain that is either charged or has an ability to hydrogen-bond, and is at least about 5 (or about 4-6) atoms in length, for example, lysine, citrulline, arginine, or ornithine. The side chains of such amino acids at positions 16 and 20 can form a salt bridge or can be covalently linked. In one embodiment the two amino acids are bound to one another to form a lactam ring. The size of the lactam ring can vary depending on the length of the amino acid side chains, and in one embodiment the lactam is formed by linking the side chains \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nof a lysine amino acid to a glutamic acid side chain. The order of the amide bond in the lactam ring can be reversed (e.g., a lactam ring can be formed between the side chains of a Lysl2 and a GIu 16 or alternatively between a GIu 12 and a Lyslό)\n\n\nIn some embodiments, stabilization of the alpha helix structure in the C-terminal portion of the glucagon peptide is achieved through the formation of an intramolecular bridge other than a lactam bridge. For example, suitable covalent bonding methods include any one or more of olefin metathesis, lanthionine-based cyclization, disulfide bridge or modified sulfur-containing bridge formation, the use of α, ω-diaminoalkane tethers, the formation of metal-atom bridges, and other means of peptide cyclization are used to stabilize the alpha helix.\n\n\nPotency at the GLP-I receptor can be further enhanced by an alanine substitution for the native arginine at position 18.\n\n\nAny of the modifications described above which increase GLP-I receptor activity can be applied individually or in combination. Combinations of the modifications that increase GLP-I receptor activity generally provide higher GLP-I activity than any of such modifications taken alone. For example, the invention provides glucagon peptides that comprise modifications at position 16, at position 20, and at the C-terminal carboxylic acid group, optionally with a covalent bond between the amino acids at positions 16 and 20; glucagon peptides that comprise modifications at position 16 and at the C-terminal carboxylic acid group; glucagon peptides that comprise modifications at positions 16 and 20, optionally with a covalent bond between the amino acids at positions 16 and 20; and glucagon peptides that comprise modifications at position 20 and at the C- terminal carboxylic acid group.\n\n\nGLP-I activity may be reduced by comprising (i) a C-terminal alpha carboxylate group, (ii) a substitution of the Thr at position 7 with an amino acid lacking a hydroxyl group, e.g., Abu or He, (iii) a deletion of the amino acid(s) C-terminal to the amino acid at position 27 or 28 (e.g., deletion of the amino acid at position 28, deletion of the amino acid at positions 28 and 29) to yield a peptide 27 or 28 amino acids in length, or (iv) a combination thereof. \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nModifications That Affect Activity At Each Of The Glucagon, GLP-I, And GIP Receptors\n\n\nEnhanced activity at each of the glucagon receptor, GLP-I receptor, and GIP receptor is provided by (i) an amino acid substitution of Ser at position 16 with an amino acid of Formula IV:\n\n\nH H\n2\nN C COOH\n\n\n(CH\n2\n)\nn\n \n\n\nN .\n\n\nR\n1\n' \nR\n2\n\n\n[Formula IV],\n\n\nwherein n is 1 to 16, or 1 to 10, or 1 to 7, or 1 to 6, or 2 to 6, or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5, each of Ri and R\n2\n is independently selected from the group consisting of H, Ci -C]\n8\n alkyl, (Ci-Ci\n8\n alkyl)OH, (Ci-Ci\n8\n alkyl)NH\n2\n, (Ci-Ci\n8\n alkyl)SH, (C\n0\n-C\n4\n alkyl)(C\n3\n-C\n6\n)cycloalkyl, (C\n0\n-C\n4\n alkyl)(C\n2\n-C\n5\n heterocyclic), (C\n0\n-C\n4\n alkyl)(C\n6\n-Cio aryl)R\n7\n, and (C\nr\nC\n4\n alkyl)(C\n3\n-C\n9\n heteroaryl), wherein R\n7\n is H or OH, and the side chain of the amino acid of Formula IV comprises a free amino group, and (ii) an amino acid substitution of the GIn at position 20 with an alpha, alpha-disubstituted amino acid, e.g., AIB. In some embodiments, the amino acid at position 16 is Orn, Dab, Lys, or homoLys, and the amino acid at position 20 is AIB. In specific embodiments, the amino acid at position 16 is Lys and the amino acid at position 20 is AIB.\n\n\nThe activity at each of the glucagon receptor, GLP- 1 receptor, and glucagon receptor of the analog comprising an amino acid of Formula IV at position 16 and an alpha, alpha di-substituted amino acid at position 20 can be further enhanced by extending the length of the peptide, e.g. by fusion to a C-terminal extension peptide, e.g. of about 1-21 , about 9 to 21 , about 6-18, about 9-12, or about 10 or 1 1 amino acids in length. In some embodiments, the C-terminus is extended by fusion to GPSSGAPPPS (SEQ ID NO: 95) or XGPSSGAPPPS (SEQ ID NO: 96), wherein X is GIy or a small, aliphatic or non-polar or slightly polar amino acid. In alternative embodiments, the C- terminus is extended by fusion to GPSSGAPPPS (SEQ ID NO: 95) and 1 -1 1 amino acids are fused to the C-terminus of GPSSGAPPPS (SEQ ID NO: 95). For example, the C- \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nterminal extension of the analog can comprise GPSSGAPPPS (SEQ ID NO: 95) followed by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 1 1 additional amino acids at the C-terminus of SEQ ID NO: 95. The 1-1 1 additional amino acids can be, for example, a small aliphatic amino acid, such as Ala. In this regard, the C-terminal extension can, for example, comprise the amino acid sequence of GPSSGAPPPSA\n1n\n, wherein m is 1 to 1 1.\n\n\nEnhancement of activity at each of the glucagon, GLP-I , and GIP receptors of a GIP-active, glucagon-based analog, including an analog comprising an amino acid of Formula IV at position 16 and an alpha, alpha disubstituted amino acid at position 20, can furthermore be achieved upon acylation or alkylation of an amino acid located within a C-terminal extension or at the C-terminal amino acid (e.g., an amino acid which is added to the C-terminus of the C-terminal extension). The acylation or alkylation can be of an amino acid located, for example, at any of positions 30, 31 , 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41 , 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, and 50 of the C-terminally extended analog. In some embodiments, the amino acid which is acylated or alkylated is located at position 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, or 43 of the C-terminally extended analog. In some embodiments, the acylated or alkylated amino acid is an amino acid of Formula I, II, or III, e.g., Lys, which is attached to an acyl or alkyl group, e.g. C10-C22. In certain embodiments, the Lys is located C-terminal to a C-terminal extension consisting of SEQ ID NO: 95, such that the Lys, Dab, Orn, or homoLys is located at position 40 of the analog. Optionally, C-terminally extended peptides are also pegylated, e.g. at any of the positions described herein (e.g., position 24).\n\n\nEnhancement of the activity at each of the glucagon, GLP-I , and GIP receptors of a GIP-active, glucagon-based analog can moreover be achieved by acylation or alkylation of an amino acid via a spacer (e.g., an amino acid, dipeptide, tripeptide, hydrophilic bifunctional spacer, hydrophobic bifunctional spacer). In some embodiments, the GIP- active, glucagon-based analog comprises an acyl or alkyl group via a spacer, which spacer is attached to the side chain of the amino acid at position 10 of the analog. In other embodiments, the analog comprises a C-terminal extension of 1 to 21 amino acids (e.g., an extension comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 95 or 96) C- terminal to the amino acid at position 29 and the spacer, which is covalently attached to an acyl or alkyl group, is attached to an amino acid of the extension at a position \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\ncorresponding to one of positions 37-43 relative to SEQ ID NO: 1. In specific embodiments, the spacer is attached to the amino acid at position 40 relative to SEQ ID NO: 1. In certain embodiments, the spacer is 3 to 10 atoms in length. In specific aspects, the total length of the spacer and acyl or alkyl group is about 14 to about 28 atoms in length. For example, the spacer can be an amino acid, including, but not limited to, any of those described herein. Also, for example, the spacer may be a dipeptide or tripeptide comprising amino acids described herein. The spacer in specific aspects is one of the following dipeptides: Ala-Ala, βAla-βAla, or γGlu-γGlu. Additional suitable spacers for purposes of increasing activity at one or more of the glucagon, GLP-I, and GIP receptors are further described herein.\n\n\nModifications that improve DPP-IV resistance\n\n\nModifications at position 1 and/or 2 can increase the peptide's resistance to dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP FV) cleavage. For example, the amino acid at position 2 may be substituted with D-serine, D-alanine, valine, glycine, N-methyl serine, N-methyl alanine, or amino isobutyric acid. In some embodiments, the amino acid at position 1 may be substituted with D-histidine, desaminohistidine, hydroxyl-histidine, acetyl- histidine, homo-histidine, N-methyl histidine, alpha-methyl histidine, imidazole acetic acid, or alpha, alpha-dimethyl imidiazole acetic acid (DMIA).\n\n\nIt was observed that modifications at position 2 (e.g. AIB at position 2) and in some cases modifications at position 1 (e.g., DMIA at position 1) may reduce glucagon activity, sometimes significantly; surprisingly, this reduction in glucagon activity can be restored by stabilizing the alpha-helix structure in the C-terminal portion of glucagon (around amino acids 12-29), e.g., through formation of a covalent bond between the side chains of two amino acids, as described herein. In some embodiments, the covalent bond is between amino acids at positions \"i\" and \"i+4\", or positions \"j\" and \"j+3\", e.g., between positions 12 and 16, 16 and 20, 20 and 24, 24 and 28, or 17 and 20. In exemplary embodiments, this covalent bond is a lactam bridge between a glutamic acid at \n■\n position 16 and a lysine at position 20. In some embodiments, this covalent bond is an intramolecular bridge other than a lactam bridge. For example, suitable covalent bonding methods (i.e., means of forming a covalent intramolecular bridge) include any one or more of olefin metathesis, lanthionine-based cyclization, disulfide bridge or modified \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nsulfur-containing bridge formation, the use of α, ω-diaminoalkane tethers, the formation of metal-atom bridges, and other means of peptide cyclization.\n\n\nModifications that reduce degradation In yet further exemplary embodiments, any of the glucagon peptides can be further modified to improve stability by modifying the amino acid at position 15 and/or 16 of SEQ ID NO: 1 to reduce degradation of the peptide over time, especially in acidic or alkaline buffers. Such modifications reduce cleavage of the Aspl 5-Serl 6 peptide bond, hi exemplary embodiments, the amino acid modification at position 15 is a deletion or substitution of Asp with glutamic acid, homoglutamic acid, cysteic acid or homocysteic acid. In other exemplary embodiments, the amino acid modification at position 16 is a deletion or substitution of Ser with Thr or AIB. In other exemplary embodiments, Ser at position 16 is substituted with glutamic acid or with another negatively charged amino acid having a side chain with a length of 4 atoms, or alternatively with any one of glutamine, homoglutamic acid, or homocysteic acid.\n\n\nIn some embodiments the methionine residue present at position 27 of the native peptide is modified, e.g. by deletion or substitution. Such modifications may prevent oxidative degradation of the peptide. In some embodiments, the Met at position 27 is substituted with leucine, isoleucine or norleucine. In some specific embodiments, Met at position 27 is substituted with leucine or norleucine.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the GIn at position 20 and/or 24 is modified, e.g. by deletion or substitution. Such modifications can reduce degradation that occurs through deamidation of GIn. In some embodiments, the GIn at position 20 and/or 24 is substituted with Ala or AIB. In some embodiments the GIn at position 20 and/or 24 is substituted with Lys, Arg, Orn, or Citrulline.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the Asp at position 21 is modified, e.g. by deletion or substitution. Such modifications can reduce degradation that occurs through dehydration of Asp to form a cyclic succinimide intermediate followed by isomerization to iso- aspartate. In some embodiments, position 21 is substituted with GIu, homoglutamic acid or homocysteic acid. In some specific embodiments, position 21 is substituted with GIu. Other modifications \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nSome positions of the native glucagon peptide can be modified while retaining at least some of the activities of the parent peptide. Accordingly, applicants anticipate that one or more of the amino acids located at positions at positions 2, 5, 10, 1 1 , 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 , 24, 27, 28 or 29 can be substituted with an amino acid different from that present in the native glucagon peptide, and still retain activity at the glucagon receptor.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, position 18 is substituted with an amino acid selected from the group consisting of Ala, Ser, or Thr. In some embodiments the amino acid at position 20 is substituted with Ser, Thr, Lys, Arg, Orn, Citrulline or AIB. In some embodiments, position 21 is substituted with GIu, homoglutamic acid or homocysteic acid, hi some embodiments, the glucagon peptide comprises 1 to 10 amino acid modifications selected from positions 16, 17, 18, 20, 21 , 23, 24, 27, 28 and 29. In exemplary embodiments, the modifications are one or more amino acid substitutions selected from the group consisting of Glnl7, Alal 8, Glu21 , Ile23, Ala24, Val27 and Gly29. In some embodiments, 1 to 2 amino acids selected from positions 17-26 differ from the parent peptide. In other embodiments, 1 to 2 amino acids selected from positions 17-22 differ from the parent peptide. In yet other embodiments, the modifications are Glnl7, Alal 8, Glu21, Ile23 and Ala24.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, one or more amino acids is added to the carboxy terminus of the glucagon peptide. The amino acid is typically selected from one of the 20 common amino acids, and in some embodiments the amino acid has an amide group in place of the carboxylic acid of the native amino acid. In exemplary embodiments the added amino acid is selected from the group consisting of glutamic acid and aspartic acid and glycine. Other modifications that do not destroy activity include WlO or R20. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptides disclosed herein are modified by truncation of the C-terminus by one or two amino acid residues yet retain similar activity and potency at the glucagon, GLP-I and/or GIP receptors. In this regard, the amino acid at position 29 and/or 28 can be deleted.\n\n\nStabilization of the Alpha Helix Structure Stabilization of the alpha-helix structure in the C-terminal portion of the glucagon peptide (around amino acids 12-29) provides enhanced GLP-I and/or GIP activity and \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nrestores glucagon activity which has been reduced by amino acid modifications at positions 1 and/or 2. The alpha helix structure can be stabilized by, e.g., formation of a covalent or non-covalent intramolecular bridge, or substitution and/or insertion of amino acids around positions 12-29 with an alpha helix-stabilizing amino acid (e.g., an α,α- disubstituted amino acid).\n\n\nIn some embodiments, an intramolecular bridge is formed between two amino acid side chains to stabilize the three dimensional structure of the carboxy terminal portion (e.g., amino acids 12-29) of the glucagon peptide. The two amino acid side chains can be linked to one another through non-covalent bonds, e.g., hydrogen-bonding, ionic interactions, such as the formation of salt bridges, or by covalent bonds. When the two amino acid side chains are linked to one another through one or more covalent bonds, the peptide may be considered herein as comprising a covlent intramolecular bridge. When the two amino acid side chains are linked to one another through non-covalent bonds, e.g., hydrogen bonds, ionic interactions, the peptide may be considered herein as comprising a non-covalent intramolecular bridge.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the intramolecular bridge is formed between two amino acids that are 3 amino acids apart, e.g., amino acids at positions i and i+4, wherein i is any integer between 12 and 25 (e.g., 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 , 22, 23, 24, and 25). More particularly, the side chains of the amino acid pairs 12 and 16, 16 and 20 , 20 and 24 or 24 and 28 (amino acid pairs in which i = 12, 16, 20, or 24) are linked to one another and thus stabilize the glucagon alpha helix. Alternatively, i can be 17.\n\n\nIn some specific embodiments, wherein the amino acids at positions i and i+4 are joined by an intramolecular bridge, the size of the linker is about 8 atoms, or about 7-9 atoms. In other embodiments, the intramolecular bridge is formed between two amino acids that are two amino acids apart, e.g., amino acids at positions j and j+3, wherein j is any integer between 12 and 26 (e.g., 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, and 26). In some specific embodiments, j is 17.\n\n\nIn some specific embodiments, wherein amino acids at positions j and j+3 are joined by an intramolecular bridge, the size of the linker is about 6 atoms, or about 5 to 7 atoms. \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nIn yet other embodiments, the intramolecular bridge is formed between two amino acids that are 6 amino acids apart, e.g., amino acids at positions k and k+7, wherein k is any integer between 12 and 22 (e.g., 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 , and 22). In some specific embodiments, k is 12, 13, or 17. In an exemplary embodiment, k is 17.\n\n\nExamples of amino acid pairings that are capable of covalently bonding to form a six-atom linking bridge include Om and Asp, GIu and an amino acid of Formula I, wherein n is 2, and homoglutamic acid and an amino acid of Formula I, wherein n is 1, wherein Formula I is:\n\n\nH H\n2\nN C COOH\n\n\n(CH\n2\n)\nn\n \n\n\nNH\n2\n . wherein n = 1 to 4\n\n\n[Formula I]\n\n\nExamples of amino acid pairing that are capable of covalently bonding to form a seven-atom linking bridge include Orn-Glu (lactam ring); Lys-Asp (lactam); or Homoser- Homoglu (lactone). Examples of amino acid pairings that may form an eight-atom linker include Lys-Glu (lactam); Homolys-Asp (lactam); Orn-Homoglu (lactam); 4-aminoPhe- Asp (lactam); or Tyr-Asp (lactone). Examples of amino acid pairings that may form a nine-atom linker include Homolys-Glu (lactam); Lys-Homoglu (lactam); 4-aminoPhe- GIu (lactam); or Tyr-Glu (lactone). Any of the side chains on these amino acids may additionally be substituted with additional chemical groups, so long as the three- dimensional structure of the alpha-helix is not disrupted. One of ordinary skill in the art can envision alternative pairings or alternative amino acid analogs, including chemically modified derivatives, that would create a stabilizing structure of similar size and desired effect. For example, a homocysteine-homocysteine disulfide bridge is 6 atoms in length and may be further modified to provide the desired effect. Even without covalent linkage, the amino acid pairings described above or similar pairings that one of ordinary skill in the art can envision may also provide added stability to the alpha-helix through non- \n\n32993-208847\n\n\ncovalent bonds, for example, through formation of salt bridges or hydrogen-bonding interactions.\n\n\nThe size of a lactam ring can vary depending on the length of the amino acid side chains, and in one embodiment the lactam is formed by linking the side chains of a lysine amino acid to a glutamic acid side chain. Further exemplary embodiments include the following pairings, optionally with a lactam bridge: GIu at position 12 with Lys at position 16; native Lys at position 12 with GIu at position 16; GIu at position 16 with Lys at position 20; Lys at position 16 with GIu at position 20; GIu at position 20 with Lys at position 24; Lys at position 20 with GIu at position 24; GIu at position 24 with Lys at position 28; Lys at position 24 with GIu at position 28. Alternatively, the order of the amide bond in the lactam ring can be reversed (e.g., a lactam ring can be formed between the side chains of a Lys 12 and a GIu 16 or alternatively between a GIu 12 and a Lys 16).\n\n\nIntramolecular bridges other than a lactam bridge can be used to stabilize the alpha helix of the glucagon analog peptides. In one embodiment, the intramolecular bridge is a hydrophobic bridge. In this instance, the intramolecular bridge optionally is between the side chains of two amino acids that are part of the hydrophobic face of the alpha helix of the glucagon analog peptide. For example, one of the amino acids joined by the hydrophobic bridge can be the amino acid at position 10, 14, and 18.\n\n\nIn one specific aspect, olefin metathesis is used to cross-link one or two turns of the alpha helix of the glucagon peptide using an all-hydrocarbon cross-linking system. The glucagon peptide in this instance can comprise α-methylated amino acids bearing olefinic side chains of varying length and configured with either R or S stereochemistry at the i and i+4 or i+7 positions. For example, the olefinic side can can comprise (CH\n2\n)n, wherein n is any integer between 1 to 6. In one embodiment, n is 3 for a cross-link length of 8 atoms. Suitable methods of forming such intramolecular bridges are described in the art. See, for example, Schafmeister et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 122: 5891-5892 (2000) and Walensky et al., Science 305: 1466-1470 (2004). Alternatively, the glucagon peptide can comprise 0-allyl Ser residues located on adjacent helical turns, which are bridged together via ruthenium-catalyzed ring closing metathesis. Such procedures of cross- linking are described in, for example, Blackwell et al., Angew, Chem., Int. Ed. 37: 3281- 3284 (1998). \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nIn another specific aspect, use of the unnatural thio-dialanine amino acid, lanthionine, which has been widely adopted as a peptidomimetic of cystine, is used to cross-link one turn of the alpha helix. Suitable methods of lanthionine-based cyclization are known in the art. See, for instance, Matteucci et al., Tetrahedron Letters 45: 1399- 1401 (2004); Mayer et al., J. Peptide Res. 51 : 432-436 (1998); Polinsky et al., J. Med. Chem. 35: 4185-4194 (1992); Osapay et al., J. Med. Chem. 40: 2241-2251 (1997); Fukase et al., Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 65: 2227-2240 (1992); Harpp et al., J. Org. Chem. 36: 73-80 (1971); Goodman and Shao, Pure Appl. Chem. 68: 1303-1308 (1996); and Osapay and Goodman, J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1599-1600 (1993). In some embodiments, α, ω-diaminoalkane tethers, e.g., 1 ,4-diaminopropane and\n\n\n1 ,5-diaminopentane) between two GIu residues at positions i and i+7 are used to stabilize the alpha helix of the glucagon peptide. Such tethers lead to the formation of a bridge 9- atoms or more in length, depending on the length of the diaminoalkane tether. Suitable methods of producing peptides cross-linked with such tethers are described in the art. See, for example, Phelan et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 119: 455-460 (1997).\n\n\nIn yet another embodiment of the invention, a disulfide bridge is used to crosslink one or two turns of the alpha helix of the glucagon peptide. Alternatively, a modified disulfide bridge in which one or both sulfur atoms are replaced by a methylene group resulting in an isosteric macrocyclization is used to stabilize the alpha helix of the glucagon peptide. Suitable methods of modifying peptides with disulfide bridges or sulfur-based cyclization are described in, for example, Jackson et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1 13: 9391 -9392 (1991) and Rudinger and Jost, Experientia 20: 570-571 (1964).\n\n\nIn yet another embodiment, the alpha helix of the glucagon peptide is stabilized via the binding of metal atom by two His residues or a His and Cys pair positioned at i and i+4. The metal atom can be, for example, Ru(III), Cu(II), Zn(II), or Cd(II). Such methods of metal binding-based alpha helix stabilization are known in the art. See, for example, Andrews and Tabor, Tetrahedron 55: 1 1711-11743 (1999); Ghadiri et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 112: 1630-1632 (1990); and Ghadiri et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1 19: 9063-9064 (1997). The alpha helix of the glucagon peptide can alternatively be stabilized through other means of peptide cyclizing, which means are reviewed in Davies, J. Peptide. Sci. 9: \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\n471-501 (2003). The alpha helix can be stabilized via the formation of an amide bridge, thioether bridge, thioester bridge, urea bridge, carbamate bridge, sulfonamide bridge, and the like. For example, a thioester bridge can be formed between the C-terminus and the side chain of a Cys residue. Alternatively, a thioester can be formed via side chains of amino acids having a thiol (Cys) and a carboxylic acid (e.g., Asp, GIu). In another method, a cross-linking agent, such as a dicarboxylic acid, e.g. suberic acid (octanedioic acid), etc. can introduce a link between two functional groups of an amino acid side chain, such as a free amino, hydroxyl, thiol group, and combinations thereof.\n\n\nIn accordance with one embodiment, the alpha helix of the glucagon peptide is stabilized through the incorporation of hydrophobic amino acids at positions i and i+4. For instance, i can be Tyr and i+4 can be either VaI or Leu; i can be Phe and i+4 can be Cys or Met; I can be Cys and i+4 can be Met; or i can be Phe and i+4 can be He. It should be understood that, for purposes herein, the above amino acid pairings can be reversed, such that the indicated amino acid at position i could alternatively be located at i+4, while the i+4 amino acid can be located at the i position.\n\n\nIn accordance with other embodiments of the invention, the alpha helix is stabilized through incorporation (either by amino acid substitution or insertion) of one or more alpha helix-stabilizing amino acids at the C-terminal portion of the glucagon peptide (around amino acids 12-29). In a specific embodiment, the alpha helix- stabilizing amino acid is an α, α-disubstituted amino acid, including, but not limited to any of amino iso-butyric acid (AIB), an amino acid disubstituted with the same or a different group selected from methyl, ethyl, propyl, and n-butyl, or with a cyclooctane or cycloheptane (e.g., 1 -aminocyclooctane-l -carboxylic acid). In some embodiments, one, two, three, four or more of positions 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 , 24 or 29 of the glucagon peptide is substituted with an α, α-disubstituted amino acid. In a specific embodiment, one, two, three or all of positions 16, 20, 21 , and 24 are substituted with an α,α- disubstiruted amino acid, e.g., AIB. For example, the glucagon peptide can comprise a substitution of position 16 with AIB in the absence of an intramolecular bridge, e.g., a non-covalent intramolecular bridge (e.g., a salt bridge) or a covalent intramolecular bridge (e.g., a lactam). Such peptides lacking an intramolecular bridge are advantageously easy to prepare. \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nIn accordance with some embodiments, the glucagon peptide lacking an intramolecular bridge comprises one or more substitutions within amino acid positions 12-29 with an α, α-disubstituted amino acid and an acyl or alkyl group covalently attached to the side chain of an amino acid of the glucagon peptide, e.g., the amino acid at positions 10 or 40 of the glucagon peptide. In specific embodiments, the acyl or alkyl group is non-native to a naturally occurring amino acid. In certain aspects, the acyl or alkyl group is non-native to the amino acid at position 10. Such acylated or alkylated glucagon peptides lacking an intramolecular bridge exhibit enhanced activity at the GLP- 1 and glucagon receptors as compared to the non-acylated counterpart peptides. Further enhancement in activity at the GLP-I and glucagon receptors can be achieved by the acylated glucagon peptides lacking an intramolecular bridge by incorporating a spacer between the acyl or alkyl group and the side chain of the amino acid at positions 10 or 40 of the peptide. Acylation and alkylation, with or without incorporating spacers, are further described herein. In specific embodiments, the acylated or alkylated glucagon peptide, or analog thereof, further comprises a modification which selectively reduces activity at the GLP-I receptor. For example, the acylated or alkylated glucagon peptide, or analog thereof, comprises one or a combination of: a C-terminal alpha carboxylate, a deletion of the amino acids C-terminal to the amino acid at position 27 or 28 (e.g., deletion of the amino acid at position 29, deletion of the amino acids at positions 28 and 29), a substitution of the Thr at position 7 with a large, aliphatic, non-polar amino acid, e.g., He. In some embodiments, position 16 or position 20 is substituted with an α,α-disubstituted amino acid, e.g., AIB. In some embodiments, position 20 is substituted with an α,α- disubstituted amino acid, e.g., AIB. In certain embodiments, position 20 is substituted with an α,α-disubstituted amino acid, e.g., AIB, and position 16 is substituted with an amino acid of Formula IV H\n2\nN OH\n\n\n \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\n[Formula IV], wherein n is 1 to 16, or 1 to 10, or 1 to 7, or 1 to 6, or 2 to 6, or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5, each of Ri and R\n2\n is independently selected from the group consisting of H, Ci-Ci\n8\n alkyl, (Ci-Ci\n8\n alkyOOH, (C-C\n18\n alkyl)NH\n2\n, (C\n1\n-C\n18\n alkyl)SH, (C\n0\n-C\n4\n alkyl)(C\n3\n-C\n6\n)cycloalkyl, (C\n0\n-C\n4\n alkyl)(C\n2\n-C\n5\n heterocyclic), (C\n0\n-C\n4\n alkyl)(C\n6\n-C\n10\n aryl)R\n7\n, and (Ci-C\n4\n alkyl)(C\n3\n-C\n9\n heteroaryl), wherein R\n7\n is H or OH, and the side chain of the amino acid of Formula IV comprises a free amino group. In particular embodiments, the amino acid of Formula IV is 2,3 diamino propionic acid (DAP), 2,4-diaminobutyric acid (DAB), Om, Lys or homoLys. The combination of an amino acid of Formula IV at position 16 and an alpha, alpha disubstituted amino acid advantageously provides improved activity at each of the glucagon, GLP-I , and GIP receptors.\n\n\nLinkage of hydrophilic moieties\n\n\nIn another embodiment the solubility of the glucagon peptides disclosed herein are enhanced by the covalent linkage of a hydrophilic moiety to the peptide. Hydrophilic moieties can be attached to the glucagon peptides under any suitable conditions used to react a protein with an activated polymer molecule. Any means known in the art can be used, including via acylation, reductive alkylation, Michael addition, thiol alkylation or other chemoselective conjugation/ligation methods through a reactive group on the PEG moiety (e.g., an aldehyde, amino, ester, thiol, α-haloacetyl, maleimido or hydrazino group) to a reactive group on the target compound (e.g., an aldehyde, amino, ester, thiol, α-haloacetyl, maleimido or hydrazino group). Activating groups which can be used to link the water soluble polymer to one or more proteins include without limitation sulfone, maleimide, sulfhydryl, thiol, triflate, tresylate, azidirine, oxirane, 5-pyridyl, and alpha- halogenated acyl group (e.g., alpha-iodo acetic acid, alpha-bromoacetic acid, alpha- chloroacetic acid). If attached to the peptide by reductive alkylation, the polymer selected should have a single reactive aldehyde so that the degree of polymerization is controlled. See, for example, Kinstler et al., Adv. Drug. Delivery Rev. 54: 477-485 (2002); Roberts et al., Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 54: 459-476 (2002); and Zalipsky et al., Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 16: 157-182 (1995). \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nIn a specific aspect of the invention, an amino acid residue on the glucagon peptide having a thiol is modified with a hydrophilic moiety such as PEG. In some embodiments, the thiol is modified with maleimide-activated PEG in a Michael addition reaction to result in a PEGylated peptide comprising the thioether linkage shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the thiol is modified with a haloacetyl-activated PEG in a nucleophilic substitution reaction to result in a PEGylated peptide comprising the thioether linkage shown below:\n\n\nPeptide \n\n\n Suitable hydrophilic moieties include polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylene glycol, polyoxyethylated polyols (e.g., POG), polyoxyethylated sorbitol, polyoxyethylated glucose, polyoxyethylated glycerol (POG), polyoxyalkylenes, polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde, copolymers of ethylene glycol/propylene glycol, monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol, mono-(Cl-ClO) alkoxy- or aryloxy-polyethylene glycol, carboxymethylcellulose, polyacetals, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyvinyl pyrrolidone, poly-1 , 3-dioxolane, poly-l ,3,6-trioxane, ethyl ene/maleic anhydride copolymer, poly (.beta. -amino acids) (either homopolymers or random copolymers), poly(n-vinyl pyrrolidone)polyethylene glycol, propropylene glycol homopolymers (PPG) and other polyakylene oxides, polypropylene oxide/ethylene oxide copolymers, colonic acids or other polysaccharide polymers, Ficoll or dextran and mixtures thereof.\n\n\nThe hydrophilic moiety, e.g., polyethylene glycol chain in accordance with some embodiments has a molecular weight selected from the range of about 500 to about 40,000 Daltons. In one embodiment the hydrophilic moiety, e.g. PEG, has a molecular weight selected from the range of about 500 to about 5,000 Daltons, or about 1 ,000 to about 5,000 Daltons. In another embodiment the hydrophilic moiety, e.g., PEG, has a molecular weight of about 10,000 to about 20,000 Daltons. In yet other exemplary \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nembodiments the hydrophilic moiety, e.g., PEG, has a molecular weight of about 20,000 to about 40,000 Daltons.\n\n\nIn one embodiment dextrans are used as the hydrophilic moiety. Dextrans are polysaccharide polymers of glucose subunits, predominantly linked by α 1-6 linkages. Dextran is available in many molecular weight ranges, e.g., about 1 kD to about 100 kD, or from about 5, 10, 15 or 20 kD to about 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 or 90 kD.\n\n\nLinear or branched polymers are contemplated. Resulting preparations of conjugates may be essentially monodisperse or polydisperse, and may have about 0.5, 0.7, 1 , 1.2, 1.5 or 2 polymer moieties per peptide. In one embodiment the hydrophilic moiety is a polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain, optionally linked to the peptide at one or more of positions 16, 17, 21 , 24, 29, a position within a C-terminal extension, e.g., 30, 31 , 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, or at the C- terminal amino acid (e.g., 40). In some embodiments, the native amino acid at that position is substituted with an amino acid having a side chain suitable for crosslinking with hydrophilic moieties, to facilitate linkage of the hydrophilic moiety to the peptide. In exemplary embodiments, the native amino acid at that position is substituted with Lys, Cys, Orn, homocysteine, or acetyl-phenylalanine residue. In other embodiments, an amino acid modified to comprise a hydrophilic group is added to the peptide at the C- terminus. .\n\n\nOther modifications that enhance solubility\n\n\nIn another embodiment the solubility of any of the glucagon peptides can be improved by amino acid substitutions and/or additions that introduce a charged amino acid into the C-terminal portion of the peptide, preferably at a position C-terminal to position 27 of SEQ ID NO: 1. Optionally, one, two or three charged amino acids may be introduced within the C-terminal portion, preferably C-terminal to position 27. In some embodiments the native amino acid(s) at positions 28 and/or 29 are substituted with one or two charged amino acids, and/or in a further embodiment one to three charged amino acids are also added to the C-terminus of the peptide. In exemplary embodiments, one, two or all of the charged amino acids are negatively charged. In some embodiments, the negatively charged (acidic amino acid) is aspartic acid or glutamic acid. \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nAdditional modifications, e.g. conservative substitutions, may be made to the glucagon peptide that still allow it to retain GIP activity (and optionally GLP-I activity and/or glucagon activity).\n\n\nConjugates and fusions\n\n\nThe present disclosure also encompasses other conjugates in which glucagon peptides of the invention are linked, optionally via covalent bonding and optionally via a linker, to a conjugate moiety. Linkage can be accomplished by covalent chemical bonds, physical forces such electrostatic, hydrogen, ionic, van der Waals, or hydrophobic or hydrophilic interactions. A variety of non-covalent coupling systems may be used, including biotin-avidin, ligand/receptor, enzyme/substrate, nucleic acid/nucleic acid binding protein, lipid/lipid binding protein, cellular adhesion molecule partners; or any binding partners or fragments thereof which have affinity for each other.\n\n\nThe peptide can be linked to conjugate moieties via direct covalent linkage by reacting targeted amino acid residues of the peptide with an organic derivatizing agent that is capable of reacting with selected side chains or the N- or C-terminal residues of these targeted amino acids. Reactive groups on the peptide or conjugate include, e.g., an aldehyde, amino, ester, thiol, α-haloacetyl, maleimido or hydrazino group. Derivatizing agents include, for example, maleimidobenzoyl sulfosuccinimide ester (conjugation through cysteine residues), N-hydroxysuccinimide (through lysine residues), glutaraldehyde, succinic anhydride or other agents known in the art. Alternatively, the conjugate moieties can be linked to the peptide indirectly through intermediate carriers, such as polysaccharide or polypeptide carriers. Examples of polysaccharide carriers include aminodextran. Examples of suitable polypeptide carriers include polylysine, polyglutamic acid, polyaspartic acid, co-polymers thereof, and mixed polymers of these amino acids and others, e.g., serines, to confer desirable solubility properties on the resultant loaded carrier.\n\n\nCysteinyl residues are most commonly are reacted with α-haloacetates (and corresponding amines), such as chloroacetic acid, chloroacetamide to give carboxymethyl or carboxyamidomethyl derivatives. Cysteinyl residues also are derivatized by reaction with bromotrifluoroacetone, alpha-bromo-β-(5-imidozoyl)propionic acid, chloroacetyl \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nphosphate, N-alkylmaleimides, 3-nitro-2-pyridyl disulfide, methyl 2-pyridyl disulfide, p- chloromercuribenzoate, 2-chloromercuri-4-nitrophenol, or chloro-7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa- 1 ,3-diazole.\n\n\nHistidyl residues are derivatized by reaction with diethylpyrocarbonate at pH 5.5- 7.0 because this agent is relatively specific for the histidyl side chain. Para- bromophenacyl bromide also is useful; the reaction is preferably performed in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate at pH 6.0.\n\n\nLysinyl and amino-terminal residues are reacted with succinic or other carboxylic acid anhydrides. Derivatization with these agents has the effect of reversing the charge of the lysinyl residues. Other suitable reagents for derivatizing alpha-amino-containing residues include imidoesters such as methyl picolinimidate, pyridoxal phosphate, pyridoxal, chloroborohydride, trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid, O-methylisourea, 2,4- pentanedione, and transaminase-catalyzed reaction with glyoxylate.\n\n\nArginyl residues are modified by reaction with one or several conventional reagents, among them phenylglyoxal, 2,3-butanedione, 1 ,2-cyclohexanedione, and ninhydrin. Derivatization of arginine residues requires that the reaction be performed in alkaline conditions because of the high pK\n*\n of the guanidine functional group. Furthermore, these reagents may react with the groups of lysine as well as the arginine epsilon-amino group. The specific modification of tyrosyl residues may be made, with particular interest in introducing spectral labels into tyrosyl residues by reaction with aromatic diazonium compounds or tetranitromethane. Most commonly, N-acetylimidizole and tetranitromethane are used to form O-acetyl tyrosyl species and 3-nitro derivatives, respectively. Carboxyl side groups (aspartyl or glutamyl) are selectively modified by reaction with carbodiimides (R-N.dbd.C.dbd.N-R\n1\n), where R and R' are different alkyl groups, such as l-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinyl-4-ethyl) carbodiimide or l-ethyl-3-(4-azonia-4,4- dimethylpentyl) carbodiimide. Furthermore, aspartyl and glutamyl residues are converted to asparaginyl and glutaminyl residues by reaction with ammonium ions. Other modifications include hydroxylation of proline and lysine, phosphorylation of hydroxyl groups of seryl or threonyl residues, methylation of the alpha-amino groups \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nof lysine, arginine, and histidine side chains (T. E. Creighton, Proteins: Structure and Molecular Properties, W.H. Freeman & Co., San Francisco, pp. 79-86 (1983)), deamidation of asparagines or glutamine, acetylation of the N-terminal amine, and/or amidation or esterifϊcation of the C-terminal carboxylic acid group. Another type of covalent modification involves chemically or enzymatically coupling glycosides to the peptide. Sugar(s) may be attached to (a) arginine and histidine, (b) free carboxyl groups, (c) free sulfhydryl groups such as those of cysteine, (d) free hydroxyl groups such as those of serine, threonine, or hydroxyproline, (e) aromatic residues such as those of tyrosine, or tryptophan, or (f) the amide group of glutamine. These methods are described in WO87/05330 published 1 1 Sep. 1987, and in ApHn and Wriston, CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem., pp. 259-306 (1981).\n\n\nExemplary conjugate moieties that can be linked to any of the glucagon peptides described herein include but are not limited to a heterologous peptide or polypeptide (including for example, a plasma protein), a targeting agent, an immunoglobulin or portion thereof (e.g. variable region, CDR, or Fc region), a diagnostic label such as a radioisotope, fluorophore or enzymatic label, a polymer including water soluble polymers, or other therapeutic or diagnostic agents. In one embodiment a conjugate is provided comprising a glucagon peptide of the present invention and a plasma protein, wherein the plasma protein is selected form the group consisting of albumin, transferin, fibrinogen and globulins.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the linker comprises a chain of atoms from 1 to about 60, or 1 to 30 atoms or longer, 2 to 5 atoms, 2 to 10 atoms, 5 to 10 atoms, or 10 to 20 atoms long. In some embodiments, the chain atoms are all carbon atoms. In some embodiments, the chain atoms in the backbone of the linker are selected from the group consisting of C, O, N, and S. Chain atoms and linkers may be selected according to their expected solubility (hydrophilicity) so as to provide a more soluble conjugate. In some embodiments, the linker provides a functional group that is subject to cleavage by an enzyme or other catalyst or hydrolytic conditions found in the target tissue or organ or cell. In some embodiments, the length of the linker is long enough to reduce the potential for steric hindrance. If the linker is a covalent bond or a peptidyl bond and the conjugate is a polypeptide, the entire conjugate can be a fusion protein. Such peptidyl linkers may \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nbe any length. Exemplary linkers are from about 1 to 50 amino acids in length, 5 to 50, 3 to 5, 5 to 10, 5 to 15, or 10 to 30 amino acids in length. Such fusion proteins may alternatively be produced by recombinant genetic engineering methods known to one of ordinary skill in the art. As noted above, in some embodiments, the glucagon peptides are conjugated, e.g., fused to an immunoglobulin or portion thereof (e.g. variable region, CDR, or Fc region). Known types of immunoglobulins (Ig) include IgG, IgA, IgE, IgD or IgM. The Fc region is a C-terminal region of an Ig heavy chain, which is responsible for binding to Fc receptors that carry out activities such as recycling (which results in prolonged half-life), antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), and complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC).\n\n\nFor example, according to some definitions the human IgG heavy chain Fc region stretches from Cys226 to the C-terminus of the heavy chain. The \"hinge region\" generally extends from Glu216 to Pro230 of human IgGl (hinge regions of other IgG isotypes may be aligned with the IgGl sequence by aligning the cysteines involved in cysteine bonding). The Fc region of an IgG includes two constant domains, CH2 and CH3. The CH2 domain of a human IgG Fc region usually extends from amino acids 231 to amino acid 341. The CH3 domain of a human IgG Fc region usually extends from amino acids 342 to 447. References made to amino acid numbering of immunoglobulins or immunoglobulin fragments, or regions, are all based on Kabat et al. 1991, Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, U.S. Department of Public Health, Bethesda, Md. In a related embodiments, the Fc region may comprise one or more native or modified constant regions from an immunoglobulin heavy chain, other than CHl , for example, the CH2 and CH3 regions of IgG and IgA, or the CH3 and CH4 regions of IgE. Suitable conjugate moieties include portions of immunoglobulin sequence that include the FcRn binding site. FcRn, a salvage receptor, is responsible for recycling immunoglobulins and returning them to circulation in blood. The region of the Fc portion of IgG that binds to the FcRn receptor has been described based on X-ray crystallography (Burmeister et al. 1994, Nature 372:379). The major contact area of the Fc with the FcRn is near the junction of the CH2 and CH3 domains. Fc-FcRn contacts are all within a single Ig heavy chain. The major contact sites include amino acid residues \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\n248, 250-257, 272, 285, 288, 290-291, 308-311 , and 314 of the CH2 domain and amino acid residues 385-387, 428, and 433-436 of the CH3 domain.\n\n\nSome conjugate moieties may or may not include FcγR binding site(s). FcγR are responsible for ADCC and CDC. Examples of positions within the Fc region that make a direct contact with FcγR are amino acids 234-239 (lower hinge region), amino acids 265- 269 (B/C loop), amino acids 297-299 (CVE loop), and amino acids 327-332 (F/G) loop (Sondermann et al., Nature 406: 267-273, 2000). The lower hinge region of IgE has also been implicated in the FcRI binding (Henry, et al., Biochemistry 36, 15568-15578, 1997). Residues involved in IgA receptor binding are described in Lewis et al., (J Immunol. 175:6694-701 , 2005). Amino acid residues involved in IgE receptor binding are described in Sayers et al. (J Biol Chem. 279(34):35320-5, 2004).\n\n\nAmino acid modifications may be made to the Fc region of an immunoglobulin. Such variant Fc regions comprise at least one amino acid modification in the CH3 domain of the Fc region (residues 342-447) and/or at least one amino acid modification in the CH2 domain of the Fc region (residues 231-341). Mutations believed to impart an increased affinity for FcRn include T256A, T307A, E380A, and N434A (Shields et al. 2001 , J. Biol. Chem. 276:6591). Other mutations may reduce binding of the Fc region to FcγRI, FcγRIIA, FcγRIIB, and/or FcγRIIIA without significantly reducing affinity for FcRn. For example, substitution of the Asn at position 297 of the Fc region with Ala or ■ another amino acid removes a highly conserved N-glycosylation site and may result in reduced immunogenicity with concomitant prolonged half-life of the Fc region, as well as reduced binding to FcγRs (Routledge et al. 1995, Transplantation 60:847; Friend et al. 1999, Transplantation 68: 1632; Shields et al. 1995, J. Biol. Chem. 276:6591). Amino acid modifications at positions 233-236 of IgGl have been made that reduce binding to FcγRs (Ward and Ghetie 1995, Therapeutic Immunology 2:77 and Armour et al. 1999, Eur. J. Immunol. 29:2613). Some exemplary amino acid substitutions are described in US Patents 7,355,008 and 7,381,408, each incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The present disclosure also encompasses glucagon fusion peptides or proteins wherein a second peptide or polypeptide has been fused to a terminus, e.g., the carboxy terminus of the glucagon peptide. In some embodiments the second peptide added to the carboxy terminus of the glucagon peptide is SEQ ID NO: 95 (GPSSGAPPPS), SEQ ID \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nNO: 97 (KRNRNNIA) or SEQ ID NO: 98 (KRNR) linked to amino acid 29 of the glucagon peptide. In other embodiments, the second peptide is XGPSSGAPPPS (SEQ ID NO: 96), wherein X is selected from one of the 20 common amino acids, e.g., glutamic acid, aspartic acid or glycine. In one embodiment X represents an amino acid, for example Cys, that further comprises a hydrophilic moiety covalently linked to the side chain of that amino acid. Such C-terminal extensions improve solubility and also can improve GIP or GLP-I activity. In some embodiments wherein the glucagon peptide further comprises a carboxy terminal extension, the carboxy terminal amino acid of the extension ends in an amide group or an ester group rather than a carboxylic acid. In some embodiments, e.g., in glucagon peptides which comprise the C-terminal extension, the threonine at position 29 of the native glucagon peptide is replaced with a glycine. For example, a glucagon peptide having a glycine substitution for threonine at position 29 and comprising the C-terminal extension of GPSSGAPPPS (SEQ ID NO: 95) is four times as potent at the GLP-I receptor as native glucagon modified to comprise the same C-terminal extension. This T29G substitution can be used in conjunction with other modifications disclosed herein to enhance the affinity of the glucagon peptides for the GLP-I receptor. For example, the T29G substitution can be combined with the S16E and N20K amino acid substitutions, optionally with a, lactam bridge between amino acids 16 and 20, and optionally with addition of a PEG chain as described herein. In some embodiments an amino acid is added to the C-terminus, and the additional amino acid is selected from the group consisting of glutamic acid, aspartic acid and glycine.\n\n\nThe present disclosure also encompasses multimers of the modified glucagon peptides disclosed herein. Two or more of the modified glucagon peptides can be linked together using standard linking agents and procedures known to those skilled in the art. For example, dimers can be formed between two modified glucagon peptides through the use of bifunctional thiol crosslinkers and bi-functional amine crosslinkers, particularly for the glucagon peptides that have been substituted with cysteine, lysine ornithine, homocysteine or acetyl phenylalanine residues. Acylation and alkylation \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nIn accordance with some embodiments, the glucagon peptides disclosed herein are modified to comprise an acyl group or an alkyl group, e.g., an acyl or alkyl group which is non-native to a naturally-occurring amino acid. Acylation or alkylation can increase the half-life of the glucagon peptides in circulation. Acylation or alkylation can advantageously delay the onset of action and/or extend the duration of action at the glucagon and/or GLP-I receptors and/or improve resistance to proteases such as DPP-IV and/or improve solubility. Activity at the glucagon and/or GLP-I and/or GIP receptors of the glucagon peptide may be maintained after acylation. In some embodiments, the potency of the acylated glucagon peptides is comparable to the unacylated versions of the glucagon peptides. In alternative embodiments, the potency of the acylated glucagon peptides is increased as compared to that of the unacylated version of the glucagon peptides.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the invention provides a glucagon peptide modified to comprise an acyl group or alkyl group covalently linked to the amino acid at position 10 of the glucagon peptide. The glucagon peptide may further comprise a spacer between the amino acid at position 10 of the glucagon peptide and the acyl group or alkyl group. In some embodiments, the acyl group is a fatty acid or bile acid, or salt thereof, e.g. a C4 to C30 fatty acid, a C8 to C24 fatty acid, cholic acid, a C4 to C30 alkyl, a C8 to C24 alkyl, or an alkyl comprising a steroid moiety of a bile acid. The spacer is any moiety with suitable reactive groups for attaching acyl or alkyl groups. In exemplary embodiments, the spacer comprises an amino acid, a dipeptide, a tripeptide, a hydrophilic bifunctional, or a hydrophobic bifunctional spacer. In some embodiments, the spacer is selected from the group consisting of: Trp, GIu, Asp, Cys and a spacer comprising NH\n2\n(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nθ)n(CH\n2\n)mCOOH, wherein m is any integer from 1 to 6 and n is any integer from 2 to 12. Such acylated or alkylated glucagon peptides may'also further comprise a hydrophilic moiety, optionally a polyethylene glycol. Any of the foregoing glucagon peptides may comprise two acyl groups or two alkyl groups, or a combination thereof.\n\n\nAcylation can be carried out at any position within the glucagon peptide, including any of positions 1 -29, a position within a C-terminal extension, or the N- or C- terminal amino acid, provided that GIP activity (and optionally GLP-I and/or glucagon \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nactivity) is retained, if not enhanced. Acylation may occur, for example, at any amino acid which is added to the glucagon sequence (SEQ ID NO: 1), e.g., at the N- or C- terminus. Nonlimiting examples include positions 1, 5, 10, 1 1 , 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 , 24, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, or 50 of the glucagon peptide. The acyl group can be covalently linked directly to an amino acid of the glucagon peptide, or indirectly to an amino acid of the glucagon peptide via a spacer, wherein the spacer is positioned between the amino acid of the glucagon peptide and the acyl group. Glucagon peptides may be acylated at the same amino acid position where a hydrophilic moiety is linked, or at a different amino acid position. Nonlimiting examples include acylation at position 10 or position 40 and pegylation at one or more positions in the C-terminal portion of the glucagon peptide, e.g., position 24, 28 or 29, within a C-terminal extension, or at the C-terminus (e.g., through adding a C-terminal Cys).\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the glucagon peptide is modified to comprise an extension of about 1 to about 21 amino acids C-terminal to the glucagon peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 or an analog thereof and at least one of the amino acids of the extension is acylated or alkylated. For example, the modified glucagon peptide may comprise an extension of about 1 to about 21 amino acids C-terminal to the amino acid at position 29 of the glucagon peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 or analog thereof. Alternatively, if the glucagon peptide or analog thereof is truncated by one or two amino acids, the extension of about 1 to about 21 amino acids may be C-terminal to the amino acid at position 27 or 28 of the glucagon peptide or analog thereof. Accordingly, the acylated or alkylated amino acid within the C-terminal extension can be, for example, any of the amino acids at position 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, or 50 of the C-terminally extended glucagon peptide. The C-terminal extension in some embodiments comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 95 or 96. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptide comprises a C-terminal extension comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 95 and 1 to 1 1 additional amino acids at the C- terminus of SEQ ID NO: 95, which additional amino acid(s) is/are acylated or alkylated, as described herein. In specific embodiments, the acylated or alkylated amino acid is a \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nDab, Orn, Lys, or homoLys residue and is located at position 40 of the C-terminally extended glucagon peptide or analog thereof.\n\n\nIn accordance with one embodiment, the glucagon peptide is modified to comprise an acyl group which is attached to the glucagon peptide via an ester, thioester, or amide linkage for purposes of prolonging half-life in circulation and/or delaying the onset of and/or extending the duration of action and/or improving resistance to proteases such as DPP-IV.\n\n\nIn a specific aspect of the invention, the glucagon peptide is modified to comprise an acyl group by direct acylation of an amine, hydroxyl, or thiol of a side chain of an amino acid of the glucagon peptide. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptide is directly acylated through the side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol of an amino acid. In some embodiments, acylation is at position 10, 20, 24, 29, or 40. In this regard, the acylated glucagon peptide can comprise the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO : 1 , or a modified amino acid sequence thereof comprising one or more of the amino acid modifications described herein, with at least one of the amino acids at positions 10, 20, 24, 29, and 40 modified to any amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol. In some specific embodiments of the invention, the direct acylation of the glucagon peptide occurs through the side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol of the amino acid at position 10 or 40. In some embodiments, the amino acid comprising a side chain amine is an amino acid of Formula I:\n\n\n \n\n wherein n = 1 to 4 [Formula I]\n\n\nIn some exemplary embodiments, the amino acid of Formula I, is the amino acid wherein n is 4 (Lys) or n is 3 (Orn). \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nIn other embodiments, the amino acid comprising a side chain hydroxyl is an amino acid of Formula II:\n\n\nH H\n2\nN C COOH\n\n\n(CH\n2\n)n\n\n\nOH wherein n = 1 to 4\n\n\n[Formula II]\n\n\nIn some exemplary embodiments, the amino acid of Formula II is the amino acid wherein n is 1 (Ser). In yet other embodiments, the amino acid comprising a side chain thiol is an amino acid of Formula III:\n\n\nH H\n2\nN C COOH\n\n\n(CH\n2\n)n\n\n\nSH wherein n = 1 to 4 [Formula III]\n\n\nIn some exemplary embodiments, the amino acid of Formula II is the amino acid wherein n is 1 (Cys).\n\n\nIn yet other embodiments, the amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol is a disubstituted amino acid comprising the same structure of Formula I, Formula II, or Formula III, except that the hydrogen bonded to the alpha carbon of the amino acid of Formula I, Formula II, or Formula III is replaced with a second side chain.\n\n\nIn one embodiment of the invention, the acylated glucagon peptide comprises a spacer between the peptide and the acyl group. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptide is covalently bound to the spacer, which is covalently bound to the acyl group. \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nThe amino acid to which the spacer is attached can be any amino acid (e.g., a singly or doubly α-substituted amino acid) comprising a moiety which permits linkage to the spacer. For example, an amino acid comprising a side chain NH\n2\n, -OH, or -COOH (e.g., Lys, Orn, Ser, Asp, or GIu) is suitable. In this respect, the acylated glucagon peptide can comprise the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 , or a modified amino acid sequence thereof comprising one or more of the amino acid modifications described herein, with at least one of the amino acids at positions 10, 20, 24, 29, and 40 modified to any amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or carboxylate.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the spacer is an amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol, or a dipeptide or tripeptide comprising an amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol.\n\n\nWhen acylation occurs through an amine group of a spacer the acylation can occur through the alpha amine of the amino acid or a side chain amine. In the instance in which the alpha amine is acylated, the spacer amino acid can be any amino acid. For example, the spacer amino acid can be a hydrophobic amino acid, e.g., GIy, Ala, VaI, Leu, He, Trp, Met, Phe, Tyr, 6-amino hexanoic acid, 5 -amino valeric acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, and 8-aminooctanoic acid. Alternatively, the spacer amino acid can be an acidic residue, e.g., Asp and GIu.\n\n\nIn the instance in which the side chain amine of the spacer amino acid is acylated, the spacer amino acid is an amino acid comprising a side chain amine, e.g., an amino acid of Formula I (e.g., Lys or Orn). In this instance, it is possible for both the alpha amine and the side chain amine of the spacer amino acid to be acylated, such that the glucagon peptide is diacylated. Embodiments of the invention include such diacylated molecules.\n\n\nWhen acylation occurs through a hydroxyl group of a spacer, the amino acid or one of the amino acids of the dipeptide or tripeptide can be an amino acid of Formula II. In a specific exemplary embodiment, the amino acid is Ser.\n\n\nWhen acylation occurs through a thiol group of a spacer, the amino acid or one of the amino acids of the dipeptide or tripeptide can be an amino acid of Formula III. In a specific exemplary embodiment, the amino acid is Cys. In some embodiments, the spacer is a hydrophilic bifunctional spacer. In certain embodiments, the hydrophilic bifunctional spacer comprises two or more reactive groups, \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\ne.g., an amine, a hydroxyl, a thiol, and a carboxyl group or any combinations thereof. In certain embodiments, the hydrophilic bifunctional spacer comprises a hydroxyl group and a carboxylate. In other embodiments, the hydrophilic bifunctional spacer comprises an amine group and a carboxylate. In other embodiments, the hydrophilic bifunctional spacer comprises a thiol group and a carboxylate. In specific embodiments, the spacer comprises an amino poly(alkyloxy)carboxylate. In this regard, the spacer can comprise, for example, NH\n2\n(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)\nn\n(CH\n2\n)\nm\nCOOH, wherein m is any integer from 1 to 6 and n is any integer from 2 to 12, such as, e.g., 8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoic acid, which is commercially available from Peptides International, Inc. (Louisville, KY). In some embodiments, the spacer is a hydrophobic bifunctional spacer.\n\n\nHydrophobic bifunctional spacers are known in the art. See, e.g., Bioconjugate Techniques, G. T. Hermanson (Academic Press, San Diego, CA, 1996), which is incorporated by reference in its entirety In certain embodiments, the hydrophobic bifunctional spacer comprises two or more reactive groups, e.g., an amine, a hydroxyl, a thiol, and a carboxyl group or any combinations thereof. In certain embodiments, the hydrophobic bifunctional spacer comprises a hydroxyl group and a carboxylate. In other embodiments, the hydrophobic bifunctional spacer comprises an amine group and a carboxylate.

In specific aspects, the long chain alkane comprises an amine, hydroxyl, or thiol group (e.g. octadecylamine, tetradecanol, and hexadecanethiol) which reacts with a carboxyl group, or activated form thereof, of the glucagon peptide. The carboxyl group, or activated form thereof, of the glucagon peptide can be part of a side chain of an amino acid (e.g., glutamic acid, aspartic acid) of the glucagon peptide or can be part of the peptide backbone.

The incorporation of a hydrophilic moiety can be accomplished through any suitable means, such as any of the methods described herein. In this regard, the acylated glucagon peptide can comprise SEQ ID NO: 1 , including any of the modifications described herein, in which at least one of the amino acids at position 10, 20, 24, 29, and 40 comprise an acyl group and at least one of the amino acids at position 16, 17, 21 , 24, 29, or 40, a position within a C-terminal extension, or the C-terminal amino acid are modified to a Cys, Lys, Orn, homo-Cys, or Ac-Phe, and the side chain of the amino acid is covalently bonded to a hydrophilic moiety (e.g., PEG). In some embodiments, the acyl group is attached to position 10 or 40, optionally via a spacer comprising Cys, Lys, Orn, homo-Cys, or Ac-Phe, and the hydrophilic moiety is incorporated at a Cys residue at position 24.\n\n\nAlternatively, the acylated glucagon peptide can comprise a spacer, wherein the \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nspacer is both acylated and modified to comprise the hydrophilic moiety.

Without being held to any particular theory, it is believed that alkylation of glucagon peptides will achieve similar, if not the same, effects as acylation of the glucagon peptides, e.g., a prolonged half-life in circulation, a delayed onset of action, an extended duration of action, an improved resistance to proteases, such as DPP-IV, and increased potency at the GLP-I, GIP, and glucagon receptors.\n\n\nAlkylation can be carried out at any positions within the glucagon peptide, including any of positions 1-29, a position within a C-terminal extension, or the N- or C- terminal amino acid, provided that the GIP activity (and optionally GIP and/or glucagon activity) is retained, if not enhanced. Alkylation may occur, for example, at any amino acid which is added to the glucagon sequence (SEQ ID NO: 1), e.g., at the N- or C- terminus. Nonlimiting examples include positions 1, 5, 10, 1 1, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 , 24, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 , 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41 , 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, or 50. The alkyl group can be covalently linked directly to an amino acid of the glucagon peptide, or indirectly to an amino acid of the glucagon peptide via a spacer, wherein the spacer is positioned between the amino acid of the glucagon peptide and the alkyl group. Glucagon peptides may be alkylated at the same amino acid position where a hydrophilic moiety is linked, or at a different amino acid position. Nonlimiting examples include alkylation at position 10 or 40 and pegylation at one or more positions in the C-terminal portion of the glucagon peptide, e.g., position 24, 28 29, or 40, within a C-terminal extension, or at the C-terminus (e.g., through adding a C-terminal Cys). \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nIn a specific aspect of the invention, the glucagon peptide is modified to comprise an alkyl group by direct alkylation of an amine, hydroxyl, or thiol of a side chain of an amino acid of the glucagon peptide. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptide is directly alkylated through the side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol of an amino acid. In some embodiments, alkylation is at position 10, 20, 24, 29, or 40. In this regard, the alkylated glucagon peptide can comprise the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO : 1 , or a modified amino acid sequence thereof comprising one or more of the amino acid modifications described herein, with at least one of the amino acids at positions 10, 20, 24, 29, and 40 modified to any amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol. In some specific embodiments of the invention, the direct alkylation of the glucagon peptide occurs through the side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol of the amino acid at position 10.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the amino acid comprising a side chain amine is an amino acid of Formula I. In some exemplary embodiments, the amino acid of Formula I, is the amino acid wherein n is 4 (Lys) or n is 3 (Om).\n\n\nIn other embodiments, the amino acid comprising a side chain hydroxyl is an amino acid of Formula II. In some exemplary embodiments, the amino acid of Formula\n\n\nII is the amino acid wherein n is 1 (Ser).\n\n\nIn yet other embodiments, the amino acid comprising a side chain thiol is an amino acid of Formula III. In some exemplary embodiments, the amino acid of Formula\n\n\nIII is the amino acid wherein n is 1 (Cys).\n\n\nIn yet other embodiments, the amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol is a disubstituted amino acid comprising the same structure of Formula I, Formula II, or Formula III, except that the hydrogen bonded to the alpha carbon of the amino acid of Formula I, Formula II, or Formula III is replaced with a second side chain. In one embodiment of the invention, the alkylated glucagon peptide comprises a spacer between the peptide and the alkyl group. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptide is covalently bound to the spacer, which is covalently bound to the alkyl group. In some exemplary embodiments, the glucagon peptide is modified to comprise an alkyl group by alkylation of an amine, hydroxyl, or thiol of a spacer, which spacer is attached to a side chain of an amino acid at position 10, 20, 24, 29, or 40 of the glucagon peptide. \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nThe amino acid to which the spacer is attached can be any amino acid (e.g., a singly α- substituted amino acid or an α,α-disubstituted amino acid) comprising a moiety which permits linkage to the spacer. For example, an amino acid comprising a side chain NH\n2\n, -OH, or -COOH (e.g., Lys, Orn, Ser, Asp, or GIu) is suitable. In this respect, the alkylated glucagon peptide can comprise the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 , or a modified amino acid sequence thereof comprising one or more of the amino acid modifications described herein, with at least one of the amino acids at positions 10, 20, 24, 29, and 40 modified to any amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or carboxylate. In some embodiments, the spacer is an amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol or a dipeptide or tripeptide comprising an amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol.\n\n\nWhen alkylation occurs through an amine group of a spacer the alkylation can occur through the alpha amine of the amino acid or a side chain amine. In the instance in which the alpha amine is alkylated, the spacer amino acid can be any amino acid. For example, the spacer amino acid can be a hydrophobic amino acid, e.g., GIy, Ala, VaI, Leu, He, Trp, Met, Phe, Tyr, 6-amino hexanoic acid, 5-aminovaleric acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, and 8-aminooctanoic acid. Alternatively, the spacer amino acid can be an acidic residue, e.g., Asp and GIu, provided that the alkylation occurs on the alpha amine of the acidic residue. In the instance in which the side chain amine of the spacer amino acid is alkylated, the spacer amino acid is an amino acid comprising a side chain amine, e.g., an amino acid of Formula I (e.g., Lys or Om). In this instance, it is possible for both the alpha amine and the side chain amine of the spacer amino acid to be alkylated, such that the glucagon peptide is dialkylated. Embodiments of the invention include such dialkylated molecules.\n\n\nWhen alkylation occurs through a hydroxyl group of a spacer, the amino acid or one of the amino acids of the dipeptide or tripeptide can be an amino acid of Formula II. In a specific exemplary embodiment, the amino acid is Ser.\n\n\nWhen acylation occurs through a thiol group of spacer, the amino acid or one of the amino acids of the dipeptide or tripeptide can be an amino acid of Formula III.

In some embodiments, the length of the spacer and alkyl is 17 to 28 (e.g., 19 to 26, 19 to 21) atoms. In accordance with certain foregoing embodiments, the bifunctional spacer can be a synthetic or non-naturally occurring amino acid comprising an amino acid backbone \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nthat is 3 to 10 atoms in length (e.g., 6-amino hexanoic acid, 5-aminovaleric acid, 7- aminoheptanoic acid, and 8-aminooctanoic acid). Alternatively, the spacer can be a dipeptide or tripeptide spacer having a peptide backbone that is 3 to 10 atoms (e.g., 6 to 10 atoms) in length.

In some embodiments, the strength of the buffer is no more than 300 mM (e.g. at most 200 mM, at most 100 mM, at most 90 mM, at most 80 mM, at most 70 mM, at most 60 mM, at most 50 mM, at most 40 mM, at most 30 mM, at most 20 mM, at most 10 mM, at most 5 mM, at most 1 mM).\n\n\nGlucagon peptides that are GIP/GLP-1 co-agonists, glucagon/GIP co-agonists and glucagon/GIP/GLP-1 tri-agonists may be used in any indication for which each of their activities has been previously described as useful. For example, glucagon activity can increase glucose levels, for insulin buffering, or to decrease gut motility during radiological examination. GLP-I activity can lower glucose levels, an activity useful for treating hyperglycemia, e.g. diabetes. GLP-I activity can also induce weight loss or prevent weight gain, e.g. through decreasing appetite. GIP activity can also lower glucose levels, an activity useful for treating hyperglycemia, e.g. diabetes. GIP/GLP-1 co-agonists and glucagon/GIP/GLP-1 tri-agonists are particularly advantageous for inducing weight loss or preventing weight gain, as well as for treating hyperglycemia, including diabetes. In vivo data disclosed herein demonstrates that the combination of GIP agonist activity with GLP-I agonist activity produces a greater effect on weight reduction than GLP-I alone. This activity is particularly unexpected in view of teachings in the art that antagonizing GIP is desirable for reducing daily food intake and body weight, and increasing insulin sensitivity and energy expenditure. (Irwin et al., \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nDiabetologia 50: 1532-1540 (2007); and Althage et al., J Biol Chem, e-publication on April 17, 2008).\n\n\nIn vivo data disclosed herein also demonstrates that the combination of GIP agonist activity with GLP-I agonist activity reduces glucose levels. Thus, the glucagon peptides described herein are expected to be used to reduce or maintain body weight, or to treat hyperglycemia, or to reduce blood glucose level, or to normalize and/or stabilize blood glucose level.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, a method of treating hyperglycemia, or a method of reducing weight gain or inducing weight loss is provided, which involves administering an effective amount of an aqueous solution comprising a glucagon peptide of the invention. In further embodiments, methods of treating diabetes involving coadministering a conventional dose or a reduced dose of insulin and a glucagon peptide of the invention are provided. Methods of treating diabetes with a glucagon peptide of the invention, without co-administering insulin are also provided. Such methods for treating hyperglycemia are expected to be useful for a variety of types of hyperglycemia, including diabetes, diabetes mellitus type I, diabetes mellitus type II, or gestational diabetes, either insulin-dependent or non-insulin-dependent, and reducing complications of diabetes including nephropathy, retinopathy and vascular disease. Methods for reducing appetite or promoting loss of body weight are expected to be useful in reducing body weight, preventing weight gain, or treating obesity of various causes, including drug-induced obesity, and reducing complications associated with obesity including vascular disease (coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, ischemia reperfusion, etc.), hypertension, onset of diabetes type II, hyperlipidemia and musculoskeletal diseases.\n\n\nMetabolic Syndrome, also known as metabolic syndrome X, insulin resistance syndrome or Reaven's syndrome, is a disorder that affects over 50 million Americans. Metabolic Syndrome is typically characterized by a clustering of at least three or more of the following risk factors: (1) abdominal obesity (excessive fat tissue in and around the abdomen), (2) atherogenic dyslipidemia (blood fat disorders including high triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol and high LDL cholesterol that enhance the accumulation of plaque \n\n32993-208847\n\n\nin the artery walls), (3) elevated blood pressure, (4) insulin resistance or glucose intolerance, (5) prothrombotic state (e.g. high fibrinogen or plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 in blood), and (6) pro-inflammatory state (e.g. elevated C-reactive protein in blood). Other risk factors may include aging, hormonal imbalance and genetic predisposition.\n\n\nMetabolic Syndrome is associated with an increased the risk of coronary heart disease and other disorders related to the accumulation of vascular plaque, such as stroke and peripheral vascular disease, referred to as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Patients with Metabolic Syndrome may progress from an insulin resistant state in its early stages to full blown type II diabetes with further increasing risk of ASCVD. Without intending to be bound by any particular theory, the relationship between insulin resistance, Metabolic Syndrome and vascular disease may involve one or more concurrent pathogenic mechanisms including impaired insulin-stimulated vasodilation, insulin resistance-associated reduction in NO availability due to enhanced oxidative stress, and abnormalities in adipocyte-derived hormones such as adiponectin (Lteif and Mather, Can. J. Cardiol. 20 (suppl. B):66B-76B (2004)).\n\n\nAccording to the 2001 National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel (ATP III), any three of the following traits in the same individual meet the criteria for Metabolic Syndrome: (a) abdominal obesity (a waist circumference over 102 cm in men and over 88 cm in women); (b) serum triglycerides (150 mg/dl or above); (c) HDL cholesterol (40 mg/dl or lower in men and 50 mg/dl or lower in women); (d) blood pressure (130/85 or more); and (e) fasting blood glucose (1 10 mg/dl or above). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an individual having high insulin levels (an elevated fasting blood glucose or an elevated post meal glucose alone) with at least two of the following criteria meets the criteria for Metabolic Syndrome: (a) abdominal obesity (waist to hip ratio of greater than 0.9, a body mass index of at least 30 kg/m\n2\n, or a waist measurement over 37 inches); (b) cholesterol panel showing a triglyceride level of at least 150 mg/dl or an HDL cholesterol lower than 35 mg/dl; (c) blood pressure of 140/90 or more, or on treatment for high blood pressure). (Mathur, Ruchi, \"Metabolic Syndrome,\" ed. Shiel, Jr., William C, MedicineNet.com, May 1 1 , 2009). \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nFor purposes herein, if an individual meets the criteria of either or both of the criteria set forth by the 2001 National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel or the WHO, that individual is considered as afflicted with Metabolic Syndrome.\n\n\nWithout being bound to any particular theory, glucagon peptides described herein are useful for treating Metabolic Syndrome. Accordingly, the invention provides a method of preventing or treating Metabolic Syndrome, or reducing one, two, three or more risk factors thereof, in a subject, comprising administering to the subject a glucagon peptide described herein in an amount effective to prevent or treat Metabolic Syndrome, or the risk factor thereof. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) refers to a wide spectrum of liver disease ranging from simple fatty liver (steatosis), to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), to cirrhosis (irreversible, advanced scarring of the liver). All of the stages of NAFLD have in common the accumulation of fat (fatty infiltration) in the liver cells (hepatocytes). Simple fatty liver is the abnormal accumulation of a certain type of fat, triglyceride, in the liver cells with no inflammation or scarring. In NASH, the fat accumulation is associated with varying degrees of inflammation (hepatitis) and scarring (fibrosis) of the liver. The inflammatory cells can destroy the liver cells (hepatocellular necrosis). In the terms \"steatohepatitis\" and \"steatonecrosis\", steato refers to fatty infiltration, hepatitis refers to inflammation in the liver, and necrosis refers to destroyed liver cells. NASH can ultimately lead to scarring of the liver (fibrosis) and then irreversible, advanced scarring (cirrhosis). Cirrhosis that is caused by NASH is the last and most severe stage in the NAFLD spectrum. (Mendler, Michel, \"Fatty Liver: Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH),\" ed. Schoenfield, Leslie J., MedicineNet.com, August 29, 2005). Alcoholic Liver Disease, or Alcohol-Induced Liver Disease, encompasses three pathologically distinct liver diseases related to or caused by the excessive consumption of alcohol: fatty liver (steatosis), chronic or acute hepatitis, and cirrhosis. Alcoholic hepatitis can range from a mild hepatitis, with abnormal laboratory tests being the only indication of disease, to severe liver dysfunction with complications such as jaundice (yellow skin caused by bilirubin retention), hepatic encephalopathy (neurological dysfunction caused by liver failure), ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdomen), \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nbleeding esophageal varices (varicose veins in the esophagus), abnormal blood clotting and coma. Histologically, alcoholic hepatitis has a characteristic appearance with ballooning degeneration of hepatocytes, inflammation with neutrophils and sometimes Mallory bodies (abnormal aggregations of cellular intermediate filament proteins). Cirrhosis is characterized anatomically by widespread nodules in the liver combined with fibrosis. (Worman, Howard J., \"Alcoholic Liver Disease\", Columbia University Medical Center website).\n\n\nWithout being bound to any particular theory, glucagon peptides described herein are useful for the treatment of Alcoholic Liver Disease, NAFLD, or any stage thereof, including, for example, steatosis, steatohepatitis, hepatitis, hepatic inflammation, NASH, cirrhosis, or complications thereof. Accordingly, the invention provides a method of preventing or treating Alcoholic Liver Disease, NAFLD, or any stage thereof, in a subject comprising administering to a subject a glucagon peptide described herein in an amount effective to prevent or treat Alcoholic Liver Disease, NAFLD, or the stage thereof. Such treatment methods include reduction in one, two, three or more of the following: liver fat content, incidence or progression of cirrhosis, incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma, signs of inflammation, e.g. abnormal hepatic enzyme levels (e.g., aspartate aminotransferase AST and/or alanine aminotransferase ALT, or LDH), elevated serum ferritin, elevated serum bilirubin, and/or signs of fibrosis, e.g. elevated TGF-beta levels. In preferred embodiments, the glucagon peptides are used treat patients who have progressed beyond simple fatty liver (steatosis) and exhibit signs of inflammation or hepatitis. Such methods may result, for example, in reduction of AST and/or ALT levels.\n\n\nThe glucagon peptides of the invention may be administered alone or in combination with other anti-diabetic or anti-obesity agents. Anti-diabetic agents known in the art or under investigation include insulin, sulfonylureas, such as tolbutamide\n\n\n(Orinase), acetohexamide (Dymelor), tolazamide (Tolinase), chlorpropamide (Diabinese), glipizide (Glucotrol), glyburide (Diabeta, Micronase, Glynase), glimepiride (Amaryl), or gliclazide (Diamicron); meglitinides, such as repaglinide (Prandin) or nateglinide (Starlix); biguanides such as metformin (Glucophage) or phenformin; thiazolidinediones such as rosiglitazone (Avandia), pioglitazone (Actos), or troglitazone (Rezulin), or other PPARγ inhibitors; alpha glucosidase inhibitors that inhibit carbohydrate digestion, such \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nas miglitol (Glyset), acarbose (Precose/Glucobay); exenatide (Byetta) or pramlintide; Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors such as vildagliptin or sitagliptin; SGLT (sodium-dependent glucose transporter 1) inhibitors; glucokinase activators (GKA); glucagon receptor antagonists (GRA); or FBPase (fructose 1 ,6-bisphosphatase) inhibitors. Anti-obesity agents known in the art or under investigation include, Leptin and\n\n\nFibroblast Growth Factor 21 (FGF-21), appetite suppressants, such as phenethylamine type stimulants, phentermine (optionally with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine), diethylpropion (Tenuate®), phendimetrazine (Prelu-2®, Bontril®), benzphetamine (Didrex®), sibutramine (Meridia®, Reductil®); rimonabant (Acomplia®), other cannabinoid receptor antagonists; oxyntomodulin; fluoxetine hydrochloride (Prozac); Qnexa (topiramate and phentermine), Excalia (bupropion and zonisamide) or Contrave (bupropion and naltrexone); or lipase inhibitors, similar to xenical (Orlistat) or Cetilistat (also known as ATL-962), or GT 389-255.\n\n\nGlucagon peptides of the invention that retain the glucose-raising effects of glucagon in hypoglycemic patients may be used to treat hypoglycemia, e.g., preventing or treating acute, periodic or nocturnal hypoglycemia. Such glucagon peptides can also be administered in conjunction with insulin to buffer the actions of insulin and help to maintain stable blood glucose levels in diabetics. In such embodiments an improved method of regulating blood glucose levels in insulin dependent patients is provided. The glucagon peptides of the present disclosure can be co-administered with insulin as a single composition, simultaneously administered as separate solutions, or alternatively, the insulin and the glucagon peptide can be administered at different time relative to one another. In some embodiments, the method comprises the steps of administering insulin in an amount therapeutically effective for the control of diabetes and administering a novel modified glucagon peptide of the present disclosure in an amount therapeutically effective for the prevention of hypoglycemia, wherein said administering steps are conducted within twelve hours of each other. The exact ratio of the modified glucagon peptide relative to the administered insulin will be dependent in part on determining the glucose levels of the patient and other clinical parameters. \"Normalizing\" blood level means that the blood glucose level is returned to normal (e.g,, lowering blood glucose level if it is higher than normal, or raising blood glucose level if it is lower than normal). \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\n\"Stabilizing\" blood glucose level means reducing the maximal variation in blood glucose level over a period of time, e.g., 8 hours, 16 hours, 24 hours, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days or 1 week. For example, administration of glucagon peptide causes the blood glucose level over time to be maintained closer to the normal range of glucose values than it would be in the absence of administration of glucagon peptide.\n\n\nGlucagon peptides of the invention that retain the desired activity can be used to induce temporary paralysis of the gut for radiological uses, or treat other metabolic diseases that result from low blood levels of glucagon. In such embodiments a method is provided for inducing the temporary paralysis of the intestinal tract. The method comprises the step of administering one or more of the glucagon peptides disclosed herein to a patient.\n\n\nIn a different aspect, the invention provides a method of reducing weight gain or inducing weight loss, or treating hyperglycemia, comprising co-administering to a patient in need thereof a GIP receptor agonist molecule and a GLP-I receptor agonist molecule in amounts effective to reduce weight gain or induce weight loss or decrease appetite. The two molecules can be together in the same composition. Alternatively, a molecule that activates both GIP and GLP-I receptors can be administered in such methods. The combination of various receptor agonist, i.e., activation, properties provides an unexpected additive or synergistic effect, or other unexpected clinical benefit(s). Administration with a conventional dose of insulin, a reduced dose of insulin, or without insulin is contemplated according to such methods. Exemplary GIP receptor agonist molecules include GIP or GIP analogs, e.g., that retain at least 50%, 60%, 70%, or 80% sequence identity upon visual inspection after alignment to maximize matches. Exemplary GLP-I receptor agonists molecules include GLP-I , GLP-I analogs, e.g., that retain at least 50%, 60%, 70%, or 80% sequence identity upon visual inspection after alignment to maximize matches, exendin-4 analogs, e.g., that retain at least 50%, 60%, 70%, or 80% sequence identity upon visual inspection after alignment to maximize matches or derivatives thereof. Exemplary molecules that exhibit both activities include glucagon peptides of the invention, GLP-I analogs that activate both GLP-I and GIP receptors, fusions of GIP and GLP-I, or fusions of GIP analogs and GLP-I analogs, or chemically modified derivatives thereof. \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nThe treatment methods in accordance with the present invention including but not limited to treatment of hypoglycemia, may comprise the steps of administering the presently disclosed glucagon peptides to a patient using any standard route of administration, including parenterally, such as intravenously, intraperitoneally, subcutaneously or intramuscularly, intrathecally, transdermally, rectally, orally, nasally or by inhalation.\n\n\nIn accordance with some embodiments, excluded from such methods, on a disease-by-disease basis, are any glucagon analogs or GLP-I analogs in the prior art disclosed to be useful for treating that particular disease. In another embodiment peptides described in U.S. Patent No. 6,864,069 as acting as both a GLP-I agonist and a glucagon antagonist for treating diabetes may also be excluded. In another embodiment, the invention may exclude the use of glucagon antagonists to treat diabetes, such as the antagonists described in Unson et al., J. Biol. Chem., 264:789-794 (1989), Ahn et al., J. Med. Chem., 44:3109-31 16 (2001), and Sapse et al., MoI. Med., 8(5):251-262 (2002). In some embodiments, oxyntomodulin or a glucagon peptide that contains the 8 C-terminal amino acids of oxyntomodulin (SEQ ID NO: 97) may be excluded.\n\n\nOxyntomodulin, a naturally occurring digestive hormone found in the small intestine, induces weight loss (see Diabetes 2005; 54:2390-2395). Oxyntomodulin is a 37 amino acid peptide that contains the 29 amino acid sequence of glucagon (i.e. SEQ ID NO: 1) followed by an 8 amino acid carboxy terminal extension of SEQ ID NO: 97 (KRNRNNIA). While the present invention contemplates that glucagon peptides described herein may optionally be joined to this 8 amino acid carboxy terminal extension (SEQ ID NO: 97), the invention in some embodiments also specifically contemplates glucagon peptides lacking the 8 contiguous carboxy amino acids of SEQ ID NO: 97.\n\n\nAny one of the following peptides is excluded from the compounds of the invention, although further modifications thereto exhibiting the desired co-agonist pr tri- agonist activity, pharmaceutical compositions, kits, and treatment methods using such compounds may be included in the invention: The peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 with an [Argl2] substitution and with a C-terminal amide; The peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 with [Argl2,Lys20] substitutions and with a C-terminal amide; The peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nwith [Argl2,Lys24] substitutions and with a C-terminal amide; The peptide of SEQ ID NO: lwith [Argl 2,Lys29] substitutions and with a C-terminal amide; The peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 with a [Glu9] substitution; The peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 missing His 1 , with [Glu9, GIu 16, Lys29] substitutions and C-terminal amide; The peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 with [Glu9, GIu 16, Lys29] substitutions and with a C-terminal amide; The peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 with [Lysl3, GIu 17] substitutions linked via lactam bridge and with a C- terminal amide; The peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 with [Lysl7, Glu21] substitutions linked via lactam bridge and with a C-terminal amide; the peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 missing Hisl, with [Glu20, Lys24] substitutions linked via lactam bridge; the peptides disclosed in PCT/US2008/053857, filed February 13, 2008, PCT/US2006/017494, filed May 5,\n\n\n2006; PCT/US2007/018415, filed August 17, 2007; PCT/GB2005/000710, filed February 25, 2005; PCT/GBOO/01089, filed March 29, 2000; PCT/US2006/005020, filed February 10, 2006; each of which are incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention may be prepared by standard synthetic methods, recombinant DNA techniques, or any other methods of preparing peptides and fusion proteins. Although certain non-natural amino acids cannot be expressed by standard recombinant DNA techniques, techniques for their preparation are known in the art.\n\n\nCompounds of the invention that encompass non-peptide portions may be synthesized by standard organic chemistry reactions, in addition to standard peptide chemistry reactions when applicable. Additional data on glucagon and GLP-I activity of glucagon peptides is also disclosed in PCT/US2008/053857, filed February 13, 2008, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 1\n\n\nGeneral Synthesis Protocol:\n\n\nGlucagon analogs were synthesized using HBTU-activated \"Fast Boc\" single coupling starting from 0.2mmole of Boc Thr(OBzl)Pam resin on a modified Applied Biosystem 430 A peptide synthesizer. Boc amino acids and HBTU were obtained from \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nMidwest Biotech (Fishers, IN). Side chain protecting groups used were: Arg(Tos), Asn(Xan), Asp(OcHex), Cys(pMeBzl), His(Bom), Lys(2Cl-Z), Ser(OBzl), Thr(OBzl), Tyr(2Br-Z), and Tφ(CHO). The side-chain protecting group on the N-terminal His was Boc. Each completed peptidyl resin was treated with a solution of 20% piperdine in dimethylformamide to remove the formyl group from the tryptophan. Liquid hydrogen fluoride cleavages were performed in the presence of p-cresol and dimethyl sulfide. The cleavage was run for 1 hour in an ice bath using an HF apparatus (Penninsula Labs). After evaporation of the HF, the residue was suspended in diethyl ether and the solid materials were filtered. Each peptide was extracted into 30-70ml aqueous acetic acid and a diluted aliquot was analyzed by HPLC [Beckman System Gold, 0.46x5cm Zorbax C8, lml/min, 45C, 214nm, A buffer =0.1%TFA, B=0.1%TFA/90%acetonitrile, gradient of 10% to 80%B over lOmin].\n\n\nPurification was done on a FPLC over a 2.2 x 25 cm Kromasil Cl 8 column while monitoring the UV at 214nm and collecting 5 minute fractions. The homogeneous fractions were combined and lyophilized to give a product purity of >95%. The correct molecular mass and purity were confirmed using MALDI-mass spectral analysis.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 2 General Pegylation Protocol: (Cys-maleimido)\n\n\nTypically, the glucagon Cys analog is dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (5- lOmg/ml) and 0.0 IM ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid is added (10-15% of total volume).\n\n\nExcess (2-fold) maleimido methoxyPEG reagent (Nektar) is added and the reaction stirred at room temp while monitoring reaction progress by HPLC. After 8-24hrs, the reaction mixture, is acidified and loaded onto a preparative reverse phase column for purification using 0.1%TFA/acetonitrile gradient. The appropriate fractions were combined and lyophilized to give the desired pegylated analogs. \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nEXAMPLE 3\n\n\nSynthesis of Glucagon Cys\n17\n(l-29) and Similar MonoCys Analogs\n\n\n0.2mmole Boc Thr(OBzl) Pam resin (SynChem Inc) in a 60ml reaction vessel and the following sequence was entered and run on a modified Applied Biosystems 430A Peptide Synthesizer using FastBoc HBTU-activated single couplings.\n\n\nHSQGTFTSDYSKYLDSCRAQDFVQWLMNT\n\n\nThe following side chain protecting groups were used: Arg(Tos), Asp(OcHex), Asn(Xan), Cys(pMeBzl), Glu(OcHex), His(Boc), Lys(2Cl-Z), Ser(Bzl), Thr(Bzl), Trp(CHO), and Tyr(Br-Z). The completed peptidyl resin was treated with 20% piperidine/dimethylformamide to remove the Trp formyl protection then transferred to an HF reaction vessel and dried in vacuo. 1.0ml p-cresol and 0.5 ml dimehyl sulfide were added along with a magnetic stir bar. The vessel was attached to the HF apparatus (Pennisula Labs), cooled in a dry ice/methanol bath, evacuated, and aprox. 10ml liquid hydrogen fluoride was condensed in. The reaction was stirred in an ice bath for lhr then the HF was removed in vacuo. The residue was suspended in ethyl ether; the solids were filtered, washed with ether, and the peptide extracted into 50 ml aqueous acetic acid.

The fractions containing homogeneous product were combined, frozen and lyophilized to give 25.7 mg. Purity as determined by analytical HPLC was ~90%. A MALDI mass spectral analysis showed a broad peak from 23,000 to 27,000 which is approximately 20,000 a.m.u. more than starting Glucagon C\n24\n (3457.8).\n\n\nEXAMPLE 9 Glucaeon Cvs\n29\n Mal-PEG-5K\n\n\n20.0mg of Glucagon Cys\n29\n(l-29) and 24.7 mg mPEG-Mal-5000 (Nektar Therapeutics) were dissolved in 3.5 ml PBS with stirring at room temperature and 0.5 ml 0.01M EDTA was added.

HPLC analysis showed a purity of 95% and MALDI mass spect analysis showed a mass of 3540.7 or 84 mass units more than starting material.

Lys(Cl-Z) was used at position 12 if lactams were constructed from 16-20, 20-24, or 24- 28. The completed peptidyl resin was treated with 20% piperidine/dimethylformamide for one hour with rotation to remove the Trp formyl group as well as the Fmoc and OFm protection from Lysl2 and GIu 16. Upon confirmation of removal by a positive ninhydrin test, the resin was washed with dimethylformamide, followed by dichloromethane and than again with dimethylformamide. The resin was treated with 520 mg (1 mmole) Benzotriazole-1-yl-oxy-tris-pyrrolidino-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBOP) in \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\ndimethylformamide and diisopropylethylamine (DIEA). The reaction proceeded for 8-10 hours and the cyclization was confirmed by a negative ninhydrin reaction. The resin was washed with dimethylformamide, followed by dichloromethane and subsequently treated with trifluoroacetic acid for 10 minutes. The removal of the Boc group was confirmed by a positive ninhydrin reaction. The resin was washed with dimethylformamide and dichloromethane and dried before being transferred to a hydrofluoric acid (HF) reaction vessel. 500 μL p-cresol was added along with a magnetic stir bar. The vessel was attached to the HF apparatus (Peninsula Labs), cooled in a dry ice/methanol bath, evacuated, and approximately 10 mL of liquid hydrofluoric acid was condensed into the vessel. The reaction was stirred for 1 hour in an ice bath and the HF was subsequently removed in vacuo. The residue was suspended in ethyl ether; the solids were filtered, washed with ether, and the peptide was solubilized with 150 mL 20% acetonitrile/1% acetic acid.\n\n\nAn analytical HPLC analysis of the crude solubilized peptide was conducted under the following conditions [4.6 X 30 mm Xterra C8, 1.50 mL/min, 220 nm, A buffer 0.1% TF A/10% ACN, B buffer 0.1 % TF A/100% ACN, gradient 5-95%B over 15 minutes]. The extract was diluted twofold with water and loaded onto a 2.2 X 25 cm Vydac C4 preparative reverse phase column and eluted using an acetonitrile gradient on a Waters HPLC system (A buffer of 0.1% TF A/10% ACN, B buffer of 0.1% TF A/10% CAN and a gradient of 0-100% B over 120 minutes at a flow of 15.00 ml/min. HPLC analysis of the purified peptide demonstrated greater than 95% purity and electrospray ionization mass spectral analysis confirmed a mass of 3506 Da for the 12-16 lactam. Lactams from 16-20, 20-24, and 24-28 were prepared similarly. \n\n\n\n\n32993-208847\n\n\nEXAMPLE 14\n\n\nGlucagon Solubility Assays:\n\n\nA solution (lmg/ml or 3mg/ml) of glucagon (or an analog) is prepared in 0.01N HCl. lOOul of stock solution is diluted to ImI with 0.0 IN HCl and the UV absorbance (276nm) is determined. The pH of the remaining stock solution is adjusted to pH7 using 200-250ul 0.1 M Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n (pH 9.2). The solution is allowed to stand overnight at 4\n0\nC then centrifuged. lOOul of supernatant is then diluted to ImI with 0.01N HCl, and the UV absorbance is determined (in duplicate).\n\n\nThe initial absorbance reading is compensated for the increase in volume and the following calculation is used to establish percent solubility: Final Absorbance\n\n\nX lOO = percent soluble\n\n\nInitial Absorbance\n\n\nEXAMPLE 15\n\n\nGlucagon Receptor Binding Assay The affinity of peptides to the glucagon receptor was measured in a competition binding assay utilizing scintillation proximity assay technology. Serial 3-fold dilutions of the peptides made in scintillation proximity assay buffer (0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.1% w/v bovine serum albumin) were mixed in 96 well white/clear bottom plate (Corning Inc., Acton, MA) with 0.05 nM (3-[\nl25\nI]-iodotyrosyl) TyrlO glucagon (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), 1-6 micrograms per well, plasma membrane fragments prepared from cells over-expressing human glucagon receptor, and 1 mg/well polyethyleneimine-treated wheat germ agglutinin type A scintillation proximity assay beads (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). Upon 5 min shaking at 800 rpm on a rotary shaker, the plate was incubated 12h at room temperature and then read on MicroBetal450 liquid scintillation counter (Perkin-Elmer, Wellesley, MA). Non- specifically bound (NSB) radioactivity was measured in the wells with 4 times greater concentration of \"cold\" native ligand than the highest concentration in test samples and total bound radioactivity was detected in the wells with no competitor. Percent specific binding was calculated as following: % Specific Binding = ((Bound-NSB)/(Total bound- \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nNSB)) X 100. IC\n5O\n values were determined by using Origin software (OriginLab, Northampton, MA).\n\n\nEXAMPLE 16 Functional Assay- cAMP Synthesis\n\n\nThe ability of glucagon analogs to induce cAMP was measured in a firefly luciferase-based reporter assay. HEK293 cells co-transfected with a receptor (glucagon receptor, GLP-I receptor or GIP receptor) and luciferase gene linked to cAMP responsive element were serum deprived by culturing 16h in DMEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 0.25% Bovine Growth Serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) and then incubated with serial dilutions of either glucagon, GLP-I, GIP or novel glucagon analogs for 5 h at 37\n0\nC, 5% CO\n2\n in 96 well poly-D-Lysine-coated \"Biocoat\" plates (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). At the end of the incubation 100 microliters of LucLite luminescence substrate reagent (Perkin-Elmer, Wellesley, MA) were added to each well. The plate was shaken briefly, incubated 10 min in the dark and light output was measured on MicroBeta-1450 liquid scintillation counter (Perkin-Elmer, Wellesley, MA). Effective 50% concentrations were calculated by using Origin software (OriginLab, Northampton, MA.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 17\n\n\nStability Assay for glucagon Cys-maleimido PEG analogs\n\n\nEach glucagon analog was dissolved in water or PBS and an initial HPLC analysis was conducted. After adjusting the pH ( 4, 5, 6, 7), the samples were incubated over a specified time period at 37\n0\nC and re-analyzed by HPLC to determine the integrity of the peptide. The concentration of the specific peptide of interest was determined and the percent remaining intact was calculated relative to the initial analysis.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 18\n\n\nPreparation of acylated and/or PEGylated peptides Acylated and/or PEGylated peptides are prepared as follows. Peptides are synthesized on a solid support resin using either a CS Bio 4886 Peptide Synthesizer or \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nApplied Biosystems 430A Peptide Synthesizer. In situ neutralization chemistry is used as described by Schnolzer et al., /«/. J. Peptide Protein Res. 40: 180-193 (1992). For acylated peptides, the target amino acid residue to be acylated (e.g., position ten) is substituted with an N ε -FMOC lysine residue. Treatment of the completed N-terminally BOC protected peptide with 20% piperidine in DMF for 30 minutes removes\n\n\nFMOC/formyl groups. Coupling to the free ε-amino Lys residue is achieved by coupling a ten-fold molar excess of either an FMOC-protected spacer amino acid (ex. FMOC-(N- BOC)-Tryptophan-OH) or acyl chain (ex. C17-COOH) and PyBOP or DEPBT coupling reagent in DMF/DIEA. Subsequent removal of the spacer amino acid's FMOC group is followed by repetition of coupling with an acyl chain. Final treatment with 100% TFA results in removal of any side chain protecting groups and the N-terminal BOC group. Peptide resins are neutralized with 5% DIEA/DMF, are dried, and then are cleaved from the support using HF/p-cresol, 95:5, at 0\n0\nC for one hour. Following ether extraction, a 5% HOAc solution is used to solvate the crude peptide. A sample of the solution is then verified to contain the correct molecular weight peptide by ESI-MS. Correct peptides are purified by RP-HPLC using a linear gradient of 10% CH3CN/0.1% TFA to 0.1 % TFA in 100% CH3CN. A Vydac Cl 8 22 mm x 250 mm protein column is used for the purification. Acylated peptide analogs generally complete elution by a buffer ratio of 20:80. Portions are pooled together and checked for purity on an analytical RP-HPLC. Pure fractions are lyophilized yielding white, solid peptides.\n\n\nIf a peptide comprises a lactam bridge and target residues to be acylated, acylation is carried out as described above upon addition of that amino acid to the peptide backbone.\n\n\nFor peptide pegylation, 40 kDa methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) maleimido- propionamide (Chirotech Technology Ltd.) is reacted with a molar equivalent of peptide in 7M Urea, 5OmM Tris-HCl buffer using the minimal amount of solvent needed to dissolve both peptide and PEG into a clear solution (generally less than 2 mL for a reaction using 2-3 mg peptide). Vigorous stirring at room temperature commences for 4- 6 hours and the reaction is analyzed by analytical RP-HPLC. PEGylated products appear distinctly from the starting material with decreased retention times. Purification is performed on a Vydac C4 column with conditions similar to those used for the initial \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\npeptide purification. Elution typically occurs around buffer ratios of 50:50. Fractions of pure PEGylated peptide are collected and lyophilized.\n\n\nPeptides are assayed for biological activity as described above in Example 16. Acylated peptides may exhibit increased potency at the GLP-I receptor. Inclusion of a tryptophan spacer may provide better potency at the glucagon receptor.\n\n\nWhile acylation can extend the half-life of a peptide to hours or more, PEGylation with repeats in tens of kDa ranges can do even more. Peptides comprising both types of modifications are prepared. These peptides are expected to exhibit extended half-life in circulation, as well as resistance to DPP-IV and other proteases.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 20\n\n\nEffect in vivo on weight gain, appetite and blood glucose levels\n\n\nThe following peptides were synthesized as essentially described above.\n\n\n(A) A pegylated glucagon/GLP-1 co-agonist peptide (Chimera 2 AIB2 C24 4OK PEG, which is a Chimera 2 peptide (see Example 21) further modified with an AIB at position 2, a Cys at 24 which is attached to a 4OK PEG group);\n\n\n(B) A pegylated GIP antagonist (Pro3 C24 GIP NH2 ( 1 -42) 40K PEG, which is amino acids 1-42 of GIP (the sequence of native GIP is SEQ ID NO: 4) modified with a Pro at position 3, a Cys at position 24, which is attached to a 4OK PEG group, and an amide in place of the C-terminal carboxylate);\n\n\n(C) A GIP agonist (AIB2 C24 GIP (1-42) 4OK PEG, which is amino acids 1- 42 of GIP (the sequence of native GIP is SEQ ID NO: 4) modified with AIB at position 2 and a Cys at position 24, which is attached to a 4OK PEG group); and\n\n\nThe peptides were tested in vivo by subcutaneously injecting diet-induced obese (DIO) mice with various peptides, or vehicle alone, QW (70 or 210 nmol/kg/week). Each group contained 8 mice, each with an initial average body weight of 50 g. Body weight, body composition, food intake, and blood glucose levels were determined periodically.\n\n\nAs shown in Figures 1 to 3, neither the GIP antagonist nor the GIP agonist peptide were effective at reducing body weight, cumulative food intake, and blood glucose levels in the mice, in comparison to the pegylated glucagon/GLP-1 co-agonist. \n\n32993-208847\n\n\nEXAMPLE 21\n\n\nGIP, GLP-I and glucagon activity of peptides\n\n\nPeptides of SEQ ID NOs: 5-94 (each of which comprised an amide in place of the C-terminal carboxylate) were synthesized as essentially described above and tested in vitro for activity at the GIP receptor, GLP-I receptor, and glucagon receptors by Example 16. The EC50 of each peptide are shown in Table 1. \n\n\n\n\n32993-208847\n\n\nTABLE 1 \n\n\n\n\n\n32993-208847\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n32993-208847\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n32993-208847\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n32993-208847\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelative activity is activity relative to the native hormone of the indicated receptor \n\n\n\n\n32993-208847\n\n\nBased on these data, it was determined that Peptides mt-140, mt-147, mt-151, mt- 152, mt-158, mt-164, mt-165, mt-166, mt-169, mt-170, mt-172, mt-175, and mt-179 were exemplary GLP-1/GIP/glucagon triagonist peptides, while Peptides mt-148, mt-149, mt- 162, mt-174, mt-178, mt-201, and mt-204 were exemplary GLP-1/GIP co-agonist peptides, and Peptides mt- 1 16, mt- 176, mt- 177, and mt- 182 were exemplary GIP/glucagon co-agonist peptides.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 22\n\n\nA GLP-1/GIP/glucagon triagonist peptide (mt-170), GLP-1/GIP co-agonist peptide (mt-178), and two GIP/glucagon co-agonist peptides (mt-182 and mt-179) of Example 21 were tested in vivo by subcutaneously injecting diet-induced obese (DIO) mice with these peptides, a glucagon/GLP-1 co-agonist peptide (Chimera 2 AIB2 (native glucagon amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO: 1) comprising the following modifications: GIn at position 17, Ala at position 18, Lys at position 20, GIu at position 21 , He at position 23, and Ala at position 24, and a C-terminal amide (\"Chimera 2\") with a further modification of AIB at position 2) or Chimera 2 AIB2 lactam (same as Chimera 2 AIB2 with further modifications of GIu at position 16 and Lys at position 20, wherein a lactam bridges the side chains of GIu 16 and Lys20), or vehicle alone, QW (70 or 210 nmol/kg/week). Each group contained 8 mice, each with an initial average body weight of 50 g. Body weight was determined periodically.\n\n\nAs shown in Figure 4, the triagonist and GLP-1/GIP co-agonist were a little more effective at reducing body weight in the mice as Chimera 2 AIB2, but not as effective as Chimera 2 AIB2 lactam, which demonstrated the best ability to reduce body weight. In contrast, both of the GIP/glucagon co-agonists, and especially mt-182, were less effective at reducing body weight.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 23\n\n\nA GLP-1/GIP/glucagon triagonist peptide (mt-170) and GLP-1/GIP co-agonist peptide (mt-178) were tested in vivo by subcutaneously injecting diet-induced obese (DIO) mice with these peptides, a GLP agonist (comprising SEQ ID NO: 3 with a GIu at position 16), or vehicle alone, QW (10 nmol/kg/week for 4 weeks or 35 nmol/kg/week \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nfor 2 weeks). Each group contained 8 mice, each mouse with an initial average body weight of 49 g. Body weight and blood glucose levels were determined periodically. As shown in Figures 5 and 6, both the GLP-I /GIP co-agonist and triagonist were more effective at reducing body weight and blood glucose levels than the GLP-I agonist.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 24\n\n\nThe effect of stabilizing the alpha helix of glucagon-based analogs with an alpha, alpha-disubstitited amino acid in lieu of a lactam was investigated by replacing the lactam of mt-165 (SEQ ID NO: 64) and of mt-170 (SEQ ID NO: 69) with an AIB at position 16. The peptide comprising the sequence of mt-165 with an AIB at position 16 in lieu of the lactam was termed \"mt-241\" and had the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 167, while the peptide comprising the sequence of mt-170 with an AIB at position 16 in lieu of the lactam was termed \"mt-248\" and had the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 173. Additional linear peptides lacking a lactam bridge and comprising AIB at position\n\n\n16 and/or 20 were also made as essentially described above. These peptides were termed \"mt-242,\" \"mt-249,\" \"mt-250,\" \"mt-251 ,\" \"mt-252,\" \"mt-255,\" \"mt-258,\" and \"mt-259\" and had the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NOs: 168, 174-176, 107, 108, 177, and 258, respectively. The in vitro biological activity at the glucagon, GLP-I, and GIP receptors of each of these peptides were tested as essentially described in Example 16. The results are shown in Table 2. \n\n\n\n\n32993-208847\n\n\nTABLE 2 \n\n\n\n\n\n32993-208847\n\n\nAs evidenced by the results in Table 2, linear peptides which do not contain a lactam provided activity at the GIP receptor, as well as the glucagon and/or GLP-I receptors. More specifically, mt-242, mt-248, mt-249, mt-250, mt-252, mt-255, mt-258, and mt-259 exhibited activities of glucagon/GLP-1/GIP triagonists, whereas mt-251 exhibited activity of a GLP-I /GIP co-agonist. Peptide mt-252, which had a Lys at position 16 and an AIB at position 20, exhibited potency at the glucagon and GLP-I receptors and exhibited an enhanced activity at the GIP receptor.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 25 Linear peptides lacking a lactam ring and comprising a Lys or similar residue at position 16 and AIB at position 20 were made as essentially described above. The peptides had the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NOs: 99-141 , 144-164, and 166. The peptides were tested in vitro for biological activity at the glucagon, GLP-I , and GIP receptors as essentially described in Example 16. The results are shown in Table 3. \n\n\n\n\n32993-208847\n\n\nTABLE 3 \n\n\n\n\n\n32993-208847\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n32993-208847\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n32993-208847\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n32993-208847\n\n\nAs shown in Table 3, the linear peptides were active at the GIP receptor and, in many cases, the peptide was additionally active at the glucagon receptor and/or the GLP- 1 receptor. More specifically, all of mt-252, mt-255, mt-257, mt-260, mt-261 , mt-262, mt-265, mt-266, mt-267, mt-275, mt-276, mt-277, mt-278, mt-279, mt-280, mt-286, mt- 287, mt-288, mt-289, mt-290, mt-291, mt-292, mt-293, mt-295, mt-296, mt-297, mt-299, mt-306, mt-307, mt-310, mt-323, mt-324, and mt-345 exhibited activity at the GIP, GLP- 1 , and glucagon receptors, while the other peptides of Table 3 exhibited activity at the GIP and GLP-I receptors (except for mt-285, which exhibited activity at only the GIP receptor, and mt-325, which exhibited activity at the glucagon and GIP receptors, but not at the GLP-I receptor).\n\n\nWhen comparing the data for mt-252, which comprised a C-terminal extension, to the data of mt\n:\n257, mt-258, and mt-259, which peptides did not comprise a C-terminal extension, it was apparent that the C-terminal extension enhanced the activities at all of the glucagon, GLP-I, and GIP receptors. When comparing the data for mt-252, which comprised a Lys at position 16, to the data of mt-275 and mt-276, which peptides comprised an Orn and a Dab residue at position 16, respectively, it was apparent that the Lys could be replaced with a Lys-like residue.\n\n\nFurther, when comparing the data of mt-252, which comprises a GIn at position 3, to the data of mt-256 and mt-274, which peptides comprise a GIu at position 3, it becomes apparent that the substitution of GIn at position 3 with a GIu residue achieved selectivity for the GLP-I and GIP receptors over the glucagon receptor.\n\n\nThe effect of acylation with C 14, C 16, and Cl 8 fatty acids was evident from the data of mt-260 to mt-263 and mt-265 to mt-272. From these data, it was apparent that acylation with C16 and Cl 8 fatty acids provided increased activity at the GLP-I and GIP receptors. The acylation of these peptides even allowed for increased activity at the glucagon receptor even though the peptides comprised a Gln3Glu substitution. The increased activity at the glucagon receptor could also be seen from the data of the triagonists mt-277 to mt-280. \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nEXAMPLE 26\n\n\nThe in vivo activities of a pegylated, cyclic, lactam-containing peptide, mt-178\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 75), and a pegylated, linear peptide lacking a lactam, mt-274 (SEQ ID NO:\n\n\n99), were tested in DIO mice, and compared to the in vivo activity of a pure GLP-I agonist control having a GLP-I -based structure of SEQ ID NO: 179. Peptides or a vehicle control were intraperitoneally injected into the mice on Day 0 at 1 , 3, or 10 nmol/kg/week.\n\n\nA 1 -hour glucose tolerance test (GTT) was performed on the mice by intraperitoneally injecting a 25% (w/v) glucose saline solution into the mice one hour after injection with one of the peptides or vehicle control. The glucose saline solution was administered to the mice at a dose of 1.5 g per kg of mouse body weight. Blood glucose levels were measured at the time of injection of peptide or vehicle control (-60 min), at the time of glucose saline solution injection (0 min), or at 15, 30, 60, or 120 min post injection with the glucose saline solution. The results of the 1-hour GTT are shown in Figure 7.\n\n\nA 24-hour GTT also was performed on the mice in the same manner as the 1-hour\n\n\nGTT, except that the glucose saline solution was administered to the. mice 24 hours after injection with the peptide or vehicle control. The results of the 24-hour GTT are shown in Figure 8. The total blood glucose levels of each mouse were measured 0 and 7 days after injection with peptide or vehicle control and are shown in Figure 9.\n\n\nFurther, the body weight of each mouse was measured at 0, 1 , 3, 5, and 7 days after injection with peptide or vehicle control. The % change in body weight of the mice are shown in Figure 10. As shown in Figure 10, mice injected with mt-178 and mt-274 at either the 3 or\n\n\n10 nmol/kg/week dose lost weight to the same or greater extent of mice injected with the\n\n\nGLP-agonist control peptide (at a 10 nmol/kg/week dose).\n\n\nAs shown in Figures 7 and 8, mice injected with mt-178, mt-274, or the GLP-I agonist control exhibited decreased levels of blood glucose, as compared to mice injected with the vehicle control. The potency of mt-178 and mt-274 appeared to be greater than that of the GLP-I agonist control peptide, as mt-178 and mt-274 at 3 nmol/kg/week \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nachieved the same effect of the GLP-I agonist control peptide at the 10 nmol/kg/week dose, mt-274 appeared to have the highest potency as this peptide at a 1 nmol/kg/week dose achieved similar results as the GLP-I agonist control peptide at 10 nmol/kg/week.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 27\n\n\nThe same peptides described in Example 26 were tested again in mice, except that higher doses (either 10 or 35 nmol/kg/week) of the peptides were subcutaneously injected into the mice. Two additional peptides were also tested at these doses: one peptide having the same structure as mt-178 but comprising a PEG group attached to the Cys at position 40 via a more stable thioether linkage (-SCH2CO-) formed by nucleophilic substitution as opposed to a traditional thioether linkage formed by malenimide PEG via Michael addition as found in mt-178) and a second peptide having the same structure as mt-274 but comprising a PEG group attached to the Cys at position 40 via the thioether linkage (-SCH2CO-) formed by nucleophilic substitution. These peptides are referred to herein as mt- 178(TE) and mt-274(TE), respectively.\n\n\nThe total blood glucose levels of the mice were measured 0 and 7 days after injection with peptide or vehicle control and are shown in Figure 11. The total changes in blood glucose of the mice was measured 7 days after injection with peptide or vehicle control and are shown in Figure 12. The body weight of each mouse was measured at 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 days after injection with peptide or vehicle control. The % changes in body weight of the mice as a function of time are shown in Figure 13, while the total changes in body weight of the mice as measured 7 days after injection with peptide or vehicle control are shown in Figure 14. As shown in Figure 12, the total change in blood glucose decreased in all mice injected with any of the tested peptides, as compared to the mice injected with vehicle control. The most dramatic changes in blood glucose were seen in mice injected with 35 nmol/kg/week of mt-274 or mt-178(TE).\n\n\nAs shown in Figure 14, the total change in body weight decreased in all mice injected with any of the tested peptides, as compared to the mice injected with vehicle \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\ncontrol. Like the total change in blood glucose, the most dramatic changes in body weight were observed in mice injected with 35 nmol/kg/week of mt-274 or mt-178(TE).\n\n\nEXAMPLE 28 The in vivo activities of the peptides described in Example 26 were compared to the in vivo activities of acylated versions of the linear mt-274 peptide. More specifically, three acylated versions of mt-274 in which the C-terminal amino acid (a Lys residue) was covalently attached to a Cl 6 fatty acyl group, a C 14 fatty acyl group, or a Cl 8 fatty acyl group were made and tested. These peptides are referred to herein as mt-298, mt-309, and mt-310, respectively. Like the parent peptide, mt-274, the acylated peptides also comprised a 40 kDa PEG group. However, the PEG group of the acylated peptides was covalently attached to the side chain of a Cys residue at position 24 of the peptides. The amino acid sequences of the acylated peptides mt-298, mt-309, and mt-310 are provided herein as SEQ ID NOs: 101-103, respectively. A non-acylated version of mt-298, mt-209, and mt-310 (hereinafter referred to as mt-31 1) was made and tested. Peptide mt-31 1 differed from mt-274 in that mt-31 1 was covalently attached to a PEG group through the side chain of a Cys residue at position 24 (as opposed to a Cys residue at the C-terminus as found in mt-274) and the C-terminal residue of mt-31 1 was a Lys residue, not a Cys residue, as found in mt-274. The peptides or a vehicle control were subcutaneously injected into DIO mice on\n\n\nDay 0 at 10 nmol/kg for one week.\n\n\nThe blood glucose levels of the mice were measured 0 and 7 days after injection with peptide or vehicle control and are shown in Figure 15. The body weight of each mouse was measured at 0, 1 , 3, 5, and 7 days after injection with peptide or vehicle control. The % changes in body weight of the mice as a function of time are shown in Figure 16, while the total changes in body weight of the mice as measured 7 days after injection with peptide or vehicle control are shown in Figure 17.\n\n\nAs shown in Figure 17, mice injected with any of the peptides exhibited a decrease in body weight as compared to mice injected with vehicle control. Mice injected with the pegylated, cyclic, lactam-containing peptide (mt-178) demonstrated the greatest loss of body weight 7 days after injection. \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nAs shown in Figure 15, the blood glucose levels of mice injected with mt-178, mt- 274, mt-31 1 , or C 14 or C16 acylated versions thereof decreased. Acylation with a Cl 8 fatty acyl group did not appear to cause a decrease in blood glucose levels, suggesting that the size of the acyl group may be important for glucose lowering effects of the peptides.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 29\n\n\nLinear glucagon-based peptides lacking a lactam that were acylated but not pegylated were made as essentially described above. Specifcally, mt-260 comprising a C 14 fatty acyl group on the C-terminal amino acid (SEQ ID NO: 104), mt-261 comprising a Cl 6 fatty acyl group on the C-terminal amino acid (SEQ ID NO: 105) and mt-262 comprising a Cl 8 fatty acyl group on the C-terminal amino acid (SEQ ID NO: 106) were made. The structures of each of these peptides were similar to those of mt-298, mt-309, and mt-310, but differed in that mt-260, mt-261 , and mt-262 comprised an Asn residue in place of a pegylated Cys residue at position 24.\n\n\nThe peptides, mt-260, mt-261 , or mt-262, a control peptide (Liraglutide, an acylated GLP-I analog), or a vehicle control were injected QD into mice at a dose of 25 or 125 nmol/kg for 7 days.\n\n\nThe blood glucose levels of the mice were measured 0 and 7 days after injection with peptide or vehicle control and are shown in Figure 18. The body weight of each mouse was measured at 0, 1 , 3, 5, and 7 days after injection with peptide or vehicle control. The % changes in body weight of the mice as a function of time are shown in Figure 19, while the total changes in body weight of the mice as measured 7 days after injection with peptide or vehicle control are shown in Figure 20. As shown in Figure 18, the effects that the acylated, unpegylated, linear peptides\n\n\n(mt-260, mt-261 , and mt-262) had on blood glucose levels were dramatic. At 25 nmol/kg, these peptides caused about a 50% decrease in blood glucose levels, and at the higher dose, the peptides caused a decrease in blood glucose levels that was greater than 50%. As shown in Figure 19, each of the acylated, unpegylated, linear peptides (at either the low or high dose) caused a decrease in body weight which was more potent \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nthan the decrease in body weight achieved by Liraglutide at the low dose. Body weight continued to decrease over the course of the 7 days of the assay.\n\n\nThese results suggest that acylated, unpegylated linear glucagon-based peptides that are active at the GlP and GLP-I receptors are able to dramatically decrease blood glucose levels and body weight, thereby indicating that these peptides can be used to treat metabolic disorders, including diabetes, and for treatment of obesity.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 30\n\n\nThe linear glucagon-based peptide mt-261 (SEQ ID NO: 105) was tested at different doses in DIO mice (N=8 per group; average initial body weight = 48 g). Mice were subcutaneously injected QD for one week with vehicle only, liraglutide (30 nmol/kg of body weight) or mt-261 (0.3, 1 , 3, 10 or 30 nmol/kg of body weight).\n\n\nThe body weight of the mice was measured 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 days after the first injection. As shown in Figure 21, injection with mt-261 or liraglutide caused weight loss in the mice. Peptide mt-261 exhibited a higher potency than liraglutide, as 3 nmol/kg mt- 261 achieved essentially the same effect as 30 nmol/kg liraglutide (Figure 21).\n\n\nThe fat mass of the mice were measured 7 days after the first injection by nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. As shown in Figure 22, increasing doses of mt-261 generally correlated with decreasing fat mass. The fat mass of mice injected with 3 nmol/kg mt-261 was about the same as the fat mass of mice injected with 30 nmol/kg liraglutide, demonstrating the high potency of mt-261 in comparison to liraglutide. Blood glucose levels of the mice were measured 0 and 7 days after the first injection. As shown in Figure 23, doses as low as 3 nmol/kg of mt-261 caused a significant decrease in blood glucose levels. Consistent with the results of the fat mass and body weight assays, the decrease in blood glucose levels of mice injected with 3 nmol/kg mt-261 was similar to the decrease of blood glucose levels of mice injected with 30 nmol/kg liraglutide, demonstrating the higher potency of mt-261 as compared to liraglutide.\n\n\nIn a separate experiment, the unacylated version of mt-261 , namely, mt-263 (SEQ ID NO: 1 1 1) was tested in nine groups of C57BI/6 mice (8 mice per group) for its in vivo effects on body weight, food intake, blood glucose levels, and fat mass. The mice were \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\n1 1 months old and had been on a diabetogenic diet for 9 months at the time of the study. The average body weight of the mice were 57 g. The mice were subcutaneously injected daily with 3, 10, or 30 nmol/kg mt-263 for one week. The control groups received either a vehicle control or Exendin-4 at 10 or 30 nmol/kg/day. To assess the in vivo effects on body weight, the body weight of the mice were measured on Day 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7, wherein Day 0 is the first day of injection. As shown in Figure 24, injection of mt-263 at any of the three doses caused a steady decrease in body weight over the 7 day test period. The effect on body weight also appreared to be dose-dependent as the total change in body weight (shown in Figure 25) increased upon increasing dose of mt-263 peptide. Further, as shown in Figure 25, the total changes in body weight achieved by any of the three doses of mt-263 was substantially more than the total change in body weight achieved by injection with Exendin-4 (at either dose).\n\n\nThe in vivo effects on food intake, fat mass, and blood glucose were also determined. The total food intake and fat mass as measured on Day 7 of mice injected. with mt-263 were reduced as compared to vehicle control and Exendin-4. Further, the total changes in blood glucose levels (as measured on Day 7 compared to levels measured on Day 0) of mice injected with mt-263 were significantly reduced in comparison to mice injected with either vehicle control or Exendin-4 (Figure 26). The peptide at a 10 nmol/kg dose appeared to be the optimal dose, achieving the greatest decrease in blood glucose levels (almost -80 mg/dL).\n\n\nThe in vivo effects on body weight, food intake, and blood glucose levels of peptide mt-263 also were compared to those of peptides mt-349 (SEQ ID NO: 262), mt- 280, mt-356, and mt-357, and of a vehicle control. Mice were given 30 nmol/kg/day of one of the peptides for 1 week. All peptides were effective at reducing body weight in mice as compared to vehicle control. \n\n\n\n\n32993-208847\n\n\nEXAMPLE 31\n\n\nThe in vivo effects of the linear, acylated glucagon-based peptides mt-277, mt- 278, and mt-279 were tested and compared to those of liraglutide. DIO mice (8 mice per group; average initial body weight = 51.4 g) were subcutaneously injected daily for 1 week with a vehicle control or 10 nmol/kg of liraglutide, mt-277, mt-278, or mt-279.\n\n\nThe body weight of the mice was measured 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 days after the first injection. As shown in Figure 27, injection with mt-277, mt-278, or mt-279 caused significant weight loss in the mice. All of these peptides further demonstrated a higher potency than liraglutide. Blood glucose levels of the mice were measured 0 and 7 days after the first injection. As shown in Figure 28, each of mt-277, mt-278, and mt-279 caused a significant decrease in blood glucose levels, which decrease was much greater than that seen in mice injected with liraglutide.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 32\n\n\nA GLP-I receptor-active, glucagon-based analog was modified to comprise a C- terminal extension of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 95 and further modified to comprise a Lys at the C-terminus of SEQ ID NO: 95. The Lys residue which was located at position 40 of the analog was acylated with a C 14 fatty acyl group. This acylated analog was tested for in vitro activity at the glucagon, GLP-I, and GIP receptors as essentially described in Example 16. The in vitro activity was compared to that of the parent GLP-I receptor-active, glucagon-based analog lacking the C-terminal extension and acylation at position 40. The C-terminally extended, acylated analog demonstrated an approximate 15% increase of activity at the GIP receptor and an approximate 52% increase at the glucagon receptor. Activity at the GLP-I receptor actually decreased when stimulated by the C-terminally extended, acylated analog. However, the activity was still greater than 100% of the activity achieved by native GLP-I at the GLP-I receptor. \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nEXAMPLE 33\n\n\nAcylated glucagon analog peptides (each of which comprised an amide in place of the C-terminal carboxylate) were synthesized as essentially described above. Peptides mt-358, mt-367, mt-368, and mt-369 were acylated monomers, whereas mt-354, mt-376, and mt-377 were acylated dimers, wherein each dimer comprised two monomers linked via C-terminal Cys residues. Peptides mt-367, mt-368, and mt-369 comprised a γGlu- γGlu dipeptide spacer for purposes of attaching the acyl group, whereas mt-358 was acylated in the absence of a spacer. Peptides mt-225, mt-227, and mt-294 were pegylated monomers that comprised a lactam bridge between the glutamic acid at position 16 and the lysine at position 20. Peptides mt-225 and mt-227 comprised a dipeptide spacer for purposes of attaching the PEG, whereas mt-294 was acylated via a thioether made by a reaction with a haloacetyl. Peptides mt-356 and mt-357 served as unacylated control peptides, of which mt-357 comprised an He at position 7, but mt-356 comprised a Thr. All were tested for in vitro activity at the GIP receptor, GLP-I receptor, and glucagon receptors as essentially described in Example 16. The EC50 (nM) and the activity relative to the native hormone of each peptide are shown in Table 4. \n\n\n\n\n32993-208847\n\n\nTABLE 4 \n\n\n\n\n\n32993-208847\n\n\n \n\n indicates a disulfide-linked dimer structure, in which each peptide monomer is attached via a disulfide bond as shown in Structure A\n\n\n♦ * indicates a PEG-linked dimer structure, in which each peptide monomer is attached via a PEG as shown in Structure B t each monomer of the dimer comprised acylation at position 40 of the monomer (wherein position 1 is the N-terminal amino acid). \n\n\n\n\n32993-208847\n\n\nDisulfide dimer \n\n\n\n\n\nStructure A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure B\n\n\nAs shown in Table 4, all three acylated dimers demonstrated potent activity at the GLP-I and GIP receptors. Also, the activity at the GLP-I receptor exhibited by mt-368 was dramatically enhanced as compared to that demonstrated by mt-358, and the activity at the GIP receptor of mt-368 was essentially maintained in comparison to mt-358, \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nsuggesting that acylation of a glucagon peptide via a spacer can increase the activity at the GLP-I receptor, while maintaining robust activity at the GIP receptor. Acylation via a spacer at position 10 of the glucagon analog appeared to be as good a position as position 40 of the glucagon analog, since the relative activities at the GLP-I and GIP receptors were about the same for mt-367 and mt-369.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 34\n\n\nTwo acylated glucagon analog peptides having the same amino acid sequence but differing in the pegylation linker were made as essentially described herein: mt-331 (SEQ ID NO: 153) comprised a linkage to PEG of structure:\n\n\n \n\n while mt-31 1 (SEQ ID NO: 100) comprised a linkage to PEG of structure:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two peptides or a vehicle control were administered via subcutaneous injection QW for one week to multiple groups of DIO mice (6 mice per group; average body weight = 64.6 g). The peptides were administered at a dose of either 10 or 35 nmol/kg.\n\n\nThe body weights of the mice were measured 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 days after administration of the peptides or the vehicle control. The body weight of the mice injected with the higher dose of either mt-31 1 or mt-331 steadily decreased over the course of the week. The total change in body weight (%) is shown in Figure 29. As shown in this figure, the total change in body weight was greatest for the mice injected with mt-31 1.\n\n\nThe total food intake by each group of mice was also measured 0, 1 , 3, 5, and 7 days after administration of the peptides or the vehicle control. As shown in Figure 30, the total food intake by the groups of mice injected with either dose of mt-31 1 or mt-331 was decreased, as compared to the mice injected with a vehicle control. \n\n32993-208847\n\n\nThe blood glucose levels of each group of mice were measured 0 and 7 days after administration of the peptides or the vehicle control. The blood glucose levels of the mice decreased upon administration of the higher dose of either mt-31 1 or mt-331. As shown in Figure 31 , the decrease in blood glucose levels was greater in mice injected with 35 nmol/kg mt-331.\n\n\nThe fat mass of each group of mice were measured. Administration of the peptides did not appear to have an effect on the fat mass, however.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 35\n\n\nThe in vivo effects of two peptides of the same amino acid sequence but differing by the absence of an acyl group attached to the Lys at position 40 (mt-331 (SEQ ID NO: 153)) or presence of a Cl 4 fatty acyl group (mt-353 (SEQ ID NO: 166)) on body weight, food intake, blood glucose levels and fat mass were tested in 7 month old C57BI/6 mice. The mice were on a diabetogenic diet for 5 months and the average initial body weight was 53 g. The peptides or a vehicle control were administered to the mice by subcutaneous injection for one week at a dose of 0.1 , 0.3, 3, or 10 nmol/kg.\n\n\nBody weight was measured 0, 1 , 3, 5, and 7 days after administration of the peptide or vehicle control. As shown in Figure 32, the total change in body weight was most significant for mice injected with 10 nmol/kg of either mt-331 or mt-353.\n\n\nFood intake by the mice was measured 0, 1 , 3, 5, and 7 days after administration of the peptide or vehicle control. As shown in Figure 33, the total food intake by the mice injected with 3 or 10 nmol/kg of either mt-331 or mt-353 was decreased in comparison to mice administered the vehicle control.\n\n\nBlood glucose levels of the mice also were monitored. As shown in Figure 34, mt-331 caused a decrease in blood glucose levels in a dose-dependent manner. The two doses of mt-353 additionally caused blood glucose levels to decrease. The fat mass levels were not significantly impacted by the administration of either peptide.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 36\n\n\nThe in vivo effects of three acylated triagonist peptides, mt-277, mt-278, and mt- 279, having the structure of SEQ ID NOs: 123, 124, and 125, respectively, on body \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nweight, blood glucose levels, and food intake were tested in 8 groups of DIO mice (8 mice per group). The peptides had the same amino acid sequence but differed in the size of the fatty acyl group to which it was attached. Liraglutide at a concentration of 10 nM/kg was used as a control. The peptides or a vehicle control were administered by subcutaneous injection daily for one week.\n\n\nThe in vitro activities at the glucagon, GLP-I, and GIP receptors were tested and the % activity of each peptide relative to the native hormone is shown below in Table 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe body weight of the mice was measured 0, 1 , 3, 5, and 7 days after administration of the peptides or the vehicle control. Over the course of the week, the body weight of the mice that were injected with one of the acylated triagonist peptides dramatically decreased, as compared to the vehicle control. As shown in Figure 35, the total change in body weight (%) of the mice injected with one of the acylated triagonist peptides was approximately -15%, whereas Liraglutide achieved less than a 5% decrease in body weight.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 37\n\n\nThe effect of dosing frequency on efficacy of a pegylated, acylated peptide (mt- 309; SEQ ID NO: 102) and a non-pegylated, acylated peptide (mt-261 ; SEQ ID NO: 105) was tested in 7 groups of DIO mice (8 mice per group) having an average body weight of 58 g. The peptides were subcutaneously injected into the mice QD at a dose of 5 nmol/kg, every 2\nnd\n day at a dose of 10 nmol/kg, or QW at a dose of 30 nmol/kg. The study lasted for 6 days, such that each group of mice received 30 nmol/kg by the end of the study \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nperiod. Body weight and blood glucose levels were measured 0 and 6 days after the first administration.\n\n\nAs shown in Figure 36, the total change in body weight (%) of mice injected QW with mt-309 was approximately the same as the total change in body weight for mice injected QD with the same peptide. Also, as shown in Figure 36, the total change in body weight of mice injected QD with mt-261 was about the same as the total change in body weight of mice injected every 2\nnd\n day with this peptide.\n\n\nThe same trends in body weight could also be observed with blood glucose levels (Figure 37): a QW injection of mt-309 achieved the same decrease in blood glucose levels as a QD injection of this peptide, and a QD injection of mt-261 achieved the same decrease in blood glucose levels as an every 2\" day injection of this peptide.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 38\n\n\nThe effect on dosing frequency on efficacy was tested for an acylated glucagon agonist peptide, mt-261 (SEQ ID NO: 105) by subcutaneously injecting 8 groups of DIO mice (8 mice per group) having an initial body weight of 56 g with 5 nmol/kg daily, 10 nmol/kg every 2\nnd\n day, 15 nmol/kg every 3\nrd\n day, or 30 nmol/kg for one day, such that each group received a total dose of 30 nmol/kg per week. The mice were 8 months old and had been on a diabetogenic diet for 6 months. Body weight, food intake, blood glucose levels and fat mass of each group were measured. As shown in Figure 38, the mice injected with the peptide every three days exhibited the greatest decrease in body weight. Interestingly, mice injected with the peptide daily and mice injected with the peptide every two days exhibited nearly the same decrease in body weight.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 39\n\n\nThe following glucagon analog peptides having appreciable agonist activity at only the glucagon receptor and not the GIP receptor and comprising a backbone of Peptide J\n\n\nHS-X-GTFTSDYSKYLDTRRAAEFVAWL(NIe)DE\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 240) or Peptide K \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nHS-X-GTFTSDYSKYLD(Aib)RRAADFV AWLMDE\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 241) with additional modification at position 3 were made by solid-phase peptide synthesis as essentially described herein. The peptides were tested for in vitro activity at the glucagon receptor as essentially described in Example 16. The EC50 (nM) of each peptide is shown in Table 6.\n\n\nTABLE 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ = glutamine; C(Acm) = acetamidomethyl-cysteine; Dab(Ac) = acetyldiaminobutanoic acid; Dap(urea) = carbamoyldiaminopropanoic acid; Q(Me) = methylglutamine; M(O) = methionine-sulfoxide; Om(Ac) = acetylornithine. \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nAs shown in Table 6, multiple amino acids could replace the GIn at position 3 without a substantial loss of activity at the glucagon receptor, and, in some cases, the modification actually increased the activity, e.g., Dab(Ac) and Q(Me) on the Peptide K backbone.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 40\n\n\nGlucagon analog peptides having appreciable activity at the glucagon receptor and not the GIP receptor and comprising Dab(Ac) at position 3 on various glucagon analog backbones were made as essentially described herein and the in vitro activity at the glucagon receptor was tested. The structures and activities of each peptide are shown in Table 7.\n\n\nTABLE 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 41\n\n\nAnalogs of glucagon having a C-terminal amide in place of the C-terminal alpha carboxylate were made as essentially described herein: \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nPeptides mt-367, mt-368, and mt-369 comprised the structures of SEQ ID NOs: 235, 236, and 237, resepectively. Peptide mt-384 comprised the amino acid of SEQ ID NO: 1 with the following amino acid modifications: Tyr at position 1 , an AIB at position 2, Lys at position 10, wherein the Lys was covalently bound to a Cl 6 fatty acyl group via a γ-Glu-γ-Glu dipeptide spacer, He at position 12, Lys at position 16, GIn at position 17, Ala at position 18, AIB at position 20, GIu at position 21, Asn at position 24, Leu at position 27, Ala at position 28, and GIy at position 29, followed by the amino acid of SEQ ID NO: 95 C-terminal to the amino acid at position 29. Peptide mt-385 comprised the same structure as Peptide mt-384 except that Thr at position 7 was changed to an He in mt-385.\n\n\nThe analogs were tested for in vitro activity at each of the glucagon, GLP-I , and GIP receptors as essentially described herein. The results are shown in Table 8.\n\n\nTABLE 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNine groups of 8 DIO mice (strain: C57B16 WT) were subcutaneously injected daily for 7 days with 10 nmol/kg of one of the peptides of Table 8. The average initial body weight of the mice was 57.6 g. The mice were approximately 10 months old and had been on a high fat diet for about 8 months.\n\n\nThe total change in body weight was measured on Day 7. All mice injected with a peptide of Table 8 demonstrated a decrease in body weight as compared to vehicle control. Mice that were injected with mt-369 demonstrated the greatest amount of weight \n\n 32993-208847\n\n\nloss (~25% decrease), followed by mice that were injected with mt-368 (~22% decrease) and mice that were injected with mt-384 (~21% decrease). Mice that were injected with mt-367 or mt-385 exhibited a lower but still significant weight loss (mt-367: ~18% decrease and mt-385: -15% decrease). \n\n\n\n\n32993-208847\n\n\nAll references, including publications, patent applications, and patents, cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each reference were individually and specifically indicated to be incorporated by reference and were set forth in its entirety herein.\n\n\nThe use of the terms \"a\" and \"an\" and \"the\" and similar referents in the context of . describing the invention (especially in the context of the following claims) are to be construed to cover both the singular and the plural, unless otherwise indicated herein or clearly contradicted by context.
