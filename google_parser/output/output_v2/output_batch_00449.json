(canceled) Description\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to new protein conjugates and new conjugates of growth hormones with improved pharmacological properties, to methods for their preparation, and to the use of said conjugates in therapy.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIt is well known that the properties of proteins may be modified by covalently conjugating groups to said proteins. Such conjugation generally requires some functional group in the protein to react with another functional group in the compound to be conjugated to the protein. Typically, amino groups, such as the N-terminal amino group, the ∈-amino group in lysines or the cysteine thiol group have been used in combination with a suitable acylating or alkylating reagent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is often desired to conjugate at specific sites, because the biological activity of a chemically modified protein will depend on the site of modification, and this is referred to as regioselective conjugation. Regioselective acylation of growth hormones, such as for instance human growth hormone (hGH) is, however, difficult because this protein contains nine lysine residues of similar reactivity, and mixtures of products usually result. The single components of these mixtures are difficult to isolate, and will therefore usually be obtained in low yield and purity only.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne strategy to attain regioselective conjugation of a property-modifying group to a protein consists in generating a functional group in the protein, which cannot be found in the natural proteinogenic amino acids. Such a unique functional group may, for instance, be an aldehyde or ketone, an alkyne, or an azide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular protein-derived aldehydes have often been used for the conjugation of property-modifying groups to proteins. This conjugation can be achieved by treating the protein-derived aldehyde with an alkoxylamine (R—O—NH\n2\n) to form an oxime, with hydrazine-derivatives to form hydrazones, or with 2-aminoethanethiols to form thiazolidines (see for instance Zhang and Tam, Analytical Biochemistry 233, 87-93 (1996); Zatsepin et al., Bioconjugate Chemistry 13, 822-830 (2002)). All these conjugating functional groups are hydrolytically unstable, and may be hydrolyzed by the treatment with acids or bases (Shao and Tam, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 117, 3893-3899 (1995)) at much higher rates than normal peptide bonds. For this reason, the above mentioned conjugates will slowly decompose in aqueous solution, what limits their utility.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGaertner et al (Bioconjugate Chem. 7, 38-44 (1996)) disclose a method for conjugating Polyethylene glycol (PEG) to IL-8, G-CFS and IKL-1ra by generating an aldehyde at the N-terminus of these proteins, followed by reaction with an alkoxyamine-functionalized PEG. The aldehyde is generated at the N-terminus either by oxidation with periodate if the N-terminal amino acid residue is serine or threonine, or by metal catalyzed oxidative deamination if the N-terminal amino acid residue is different from serine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nN-terminal serine-extended human growth hormone, Ser-hGH, is disclosed as SEQ ID No. 66 in WO 04/007687. This application relates to multimeric forms of for instance hGH with improved properties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUS 20040127417 describes the reductive alkylation of native growth hormone with a PEG-derived aldehyde. In said procedure the slight difference in basicity between the lysine side-chain amino groups and the N-terminal amino group is exploited: under acidic conditions imine formation with the less extensively protonated N-terminal amino group is faster than imine formation with the lysine side-chains, so that a regioselective PEGylation of the N-terminal amino acid can be achieved.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides conjugated peptides according to formula (I)\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein\n\n\nProt represents a peptide-derived radical generated by the formal removal of a hydrogen atom from an amino group (—NH\n2\n) of said peptide,\n\n\nR\n1 \nrepresents arylene or a heteroarylene, optionally substituted with a C\n1-6\n-alkyl, halogen, cyano, nitro, hydroxyl, carboxyl, or aryl group;\n\n\nR\n2 \nrepresents a bond or a linker, wherein said linker comprises a diradical selected from the group consisting of —C(═O)—NH—, —NH—, —O—, —S—, —O—P(O)(OH)—O—, —O—C(═O)—NH—, —NH—C(═O)—NH—, —(CH\n2\n)\n1-10\n—, —O—(CH\n2\n)\n3\n—NH—C(═O)—, —C(═O)NH(CH\n2\n)\n2-30\n—, —(CH\n2\n)\n1-30\nC(═O)NH(CH\n2\n)\n2-30\n—, —(CH\n2\n)\n0-30\nC(═O)NH—(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)\n1-10\n—(CH\n2\n)\n1-5\n—C(═O)—, —C(═O)NH—[CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)\n1-10\n—(CH\n2\n)\n1-5\n—C(═O)]\n1-5\nNH(CH\n2\n)\n2-30\n—, —C(═O)—, —(CH\n2\n)\n1-30\n—NHC(═O)—, —(CH\n2\n)\n1-30\nC(═O)—, —NHC(═O)NH(CH\n2\n)\n2-30\n—, —(CH\n2\n)\n1-30\n—NHC(═O)NH(CH\n2\n)\n2-30\n—, —(CH\n2\n)\n0-30\nC(═O)NH(CH\n2\n)\n2-30\n—NHC(═O)—(CH\n2\n)\n0-30\n—, —(CH\n2\n)\n0-30\nC(═O)NH(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)\n1-30\n—CH\n2\nCH\n2\nNHC(═O)—(CH\n2\n)\n0-30\n—, or —NH(CH\n2\n)\n2-30\n—,\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nand combinations thereof, and\n\n\nR\n3 \nrepresents a property-modifying group;\n\n\nR\n4 \nrepresents hydrogen or C\n1-6\n-alkyl;\n\n\nR\n5 \nrepresents —CH\n2\n— or —C(═O)—,\n\n\nor pharmaceutically acceptable salts, prodrugs and solvates thereof.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides methods for preparing a peptide compound comprising a property-modifying group, said method comprising the steps of\n\n \n \n \n(a) treatment of an aldehyde or ketone derived from the peptide compound with a property-modifying group-derived aniline or heteroarylamine to yield an imine or a hemiaminal,\n \n(b) treatment of this imine or hemiaminal with a suitable reducing agent, such as NaCNBH\n3\n, to yield a secondary amine.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides compounds of formula (III)\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein R\n1\n, R\n2\n, and R\n3 \nare as defined above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides compounds according to the present invention for use in therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides pharmaceutical preparations comprising a compound according to the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides methods of treating diseases benefiting from an increase in the level of circulating growth hormone, the method comprising the administration of a therapeutically effective amount of a compound or a pharmaceutical preparation according to the present invention to a patient in need thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides the use of a compound according to the present invention in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of a disease benefiting from an increase in the level of circulating growth hormone.\n\n\n \n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFIG. 1\n.

This disclosure also provides methods for the preparation of these compounds, and for their use for the treatment of diseases. The conjugates of the present invention are devoid of groups which can be hydrolyzed more readily than peptide bonds, and their stability should therefore be similar as the stability of the unconjugated peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to the present invention, peptide-derived aldehydes (or “aldehydes derived from the peptide”) may be cleanly coupled to PEG-derived anilines or heteroarylamines. Due to the much lower basicity of anilines and heteroarylamines, if compared to aliphatic amines such as lysine side-chain amino groups or the N-terminal amino group of peptides or proteins, and because of the high stability of aniline- or heteroarylamine-derived imines (conjugation of the imine double bond with the aromatic system), a selective imine-formation between the aldehyde-functionality of the peptide and the aniline or heteroarylamine is observed. Reduction of this imine leads to the formation of stable N-alkyl anilines/heteroarylamines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, in one embodiment this invention provides compounds of formula (I)\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein\n\n\nProt represents a peptide-derived radical generated by the formal removal of a hydrogen atom from an amino group (—NH\n2\n) of said peptide,\n\n\nR\n1 \nrepresents arylene or a heteroarylene, optionally substituted with a C\n1-6\n-alkyl, halogen, cyano, nitro, hydroxyl, carboxyl, or aryl group;\n\n\nR\n2 \nrepresents a bond or a linker, wherein said linker comprises a diradical selected from the group consisting of —C(═O)—NH—, —NH—, —O—, —S—, —O—P(O)(OH)—O—, —O—C(═O)—NH—, —NH—C(═O)—NH—, —(CH\n2\n)\n1-10\n—, —O—(CH\n2\n)\n3\n—NH—C(═O)—, —C(═O)NH(CH\n2\n)\n2-30\n—, —(CH\n2\n)\n1-30\nC(═O)NH(CH\n2\n)\n2-30\n—, —(CH\n2\n)\n0-30\nC(═O)NH—(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)\n1-10\n—(CH\n2\n)\n1-5\n—C(═O)—, —C(═O)NH—[CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)\n1-10\n—(CH\n2\n)\n1-5\n—C(═O)]\n1-5\nNH(CH\n2\n)\n2-30\n—, —C(═O)—, —(CH\n2\n)\n1-30\n—NHC(═O)—, —(CH\n2\n)\n1-30\nC(═O)—, —NHC(═O)NH(CH\n2\n)\n2-30\n—, —(CH\n2\n)\n1-30\n—NHC(═O)NH(CH\n2\n)\n2-30\n—, —(CH\n2\n)\n0-30\nC(═O)NH(CH\n2\n)\n2-30\n—NHC(═O)—(CH\n2\n)\n0-30\n—, —(CH\n2\n)\n0-30\nC(═O)NH(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)\n1-30\n—CH\n2\nCH\n2\nNHC(═O)—(CH\n2\n)\n0-30\n—, or —NH(CH\n2\n)\n2-30\n—,\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nand combinations thereof, and\n\n\nR\n3 \nrepresents a property-modifying group;\n\n\nR\n4 \nrepresents hydrogen or C\n1-6\n-alkyl;\n\n\nR\n5 \nrepresents —CH\n2\n— or —C(═O)—,\n\n\nor pharmaceutically acceptable salts, prodrugs and solvates thereof.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnsymmetric biradicals are intended to be connectable to other molecular fragments in both possible directions, i.e. a biradical such as —C(═O)—NH— represents both —C(═O)—NH— and —HN—(C═O)—.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSaid compounds have improved pharmacological properties compared to the corresponding unconjugated peptide.

It is to be understood that the term is also intended to include peptides, which have been derivatized, for instance by the attachment of lipophilic groups, PEG or prosthetic groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “peptide-derived aldehyde (or ketone)” or “aldehyde (or ketone) derived from a peptide” is intended to indicate a peptide to which an aldehyde or ketone functional group has been covalently attached, or a peptide on which an aldehyde or ketone functional group has been generated. The preparation of peptide-derived aldehydes is well known to those skilled in the art, and any of these known procedures may be used to prepare the peptide-derived aldehyde required for the realization of the invention disclosed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the present context, the term “alkyl” is intended to indicate a straight or branched saturated monovalent hydrocarbon radical. The term “alkylene” indicates the corresponding diradical. A “lower alkyl” is an alkyl having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, also denoted as C\n1-6\n-alkyl.

Such properties could be solubility, tissue- and organ distribution, lipophilicity, susceptibility to degradation by various proteases, affinity to plasma proteins, such as albumin, functional in vivo half-life, plasma in vivo half-life, mean residence time, clearance, immunogenicity, and renal filtration. It is well-known in the art, that several types of chemical groups may have such property-modifying effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “functional in vivo half-life” is used in its normal meaning, i.e., the time at which 50% of the biological activity of the peptide, for instance growth hormone, or conjugated peptide, for instance growth hormone, is still present in the body/target organ, or the time at which the activity of the peptide, for instance growth hormone, or peptide, for instance growth hormone, conjugate is 50% of its initial value. As an alternative to determining functional in vivo half-life, “in vivo plasma half-life” may be determined, i.e., the time at which 50% of the peptide, for instance growth hormone, or peptide, for instance growth hormone, conjugate circulate in the plasma or bloodstream prior to being cleared. Determination of plasma half-life is often more simple than determining functional half-life and the magnitude of plasma half-life is usually a good indication of the magnitude of functional in vivo half-life. Alternative terms to plasma half-life include serum half-life, circulating half-life, circulatory half-life, serum clearance, plasma clearance, and clearance half-life.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMeasurement of in vivo plasma half-life may be carried out in a number of ways as described in the literature. An increase in in vivo plasma half-life may be quantified as a decrease in clearance (CL) or as an increase in mean residence time (MRT). Conjugated peptide, for instance growth hormone, of the present invention for which the CL is decreased to less than 70%, such as less than 50%, such than less than 20%, such than less than 10% of the CL of the parent peptide as determined in a suitable assay is said to have an increased in vivo plasma half-life. Conjugated peptide, for instance growth hormone, of the present invention for which MRT is increased to more than 130%, such as more than 150%, such as more than 200%, such as more than 500% of the MRT of the parent peptide in a suitable assay is said to have an increased in vivo plasma half-life. Clearance and mean residence time can be assessed in standard pharmacokinetic studies using suitable test animals. It is within the capabilities of a person skilled in the art to choose a suitable test animal for a given peptide. Tests in human, of course, represent the ultimate test. Suitable text animals include normal, Sprague-Dawley male rats, mice and cynomolgus monkeys. Typically the mice and rats are in injected in a single subcutaneous bolus, while monkeys may be injected in a single subcutaneous bolus or in a single iv dose. The amount injected depends on the test animal. Subsequently, blood samples are taken over a period of one to five days as appropriate for the assessment of CL and MRT. The blood samples are conveniently analysed by ELISA techniques.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “immunogenicity” of a compound refers to the ability of the compound, when administered to a human, to elicit a deleterious immune response, whether humoral, cellular, or both. In any human sub-population, there may exist individuals who exhibit sensitivity to particular administered peptides. Immunogenicity may be measured by quantifying the presence of antibodies against the peptide and/or peptide responsive T-cells in a sensitive individual, using conventional methods known in the art. In one embodiment the conjugated GH of the present invention exhibit a decrease in immunogenicity in a sensitive individual of at least about 10%, preferably at least about 25%, more preferably at least about 40% and most preferably at least about 50%, relative to the immunogenicity for that individual of the parent GH. In another aspect, immunogenicity may refer to the typical response in a population of similar subjects, such as the typical response in a patient population in a clinical trial.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “protease protection” or “protease protected” as used herein is intended to indicate that the conjugated peptide, for instance growth hormone, of the present invention is more resistant to the plasma peptidase or proteases than is the parent peptide. Protease and peptidase enzymes present in plasma are known to be involved in the degradation of circulating proteins and peptides, such as for instance circulating peptide hormones, such as growth hormone. The conjugated peptides of the present invention may also be more resistant to degradation by proteases present in certain tissues and organs, for instance the proteases present in the lung, and the conjugated peptides would thus be better suited for pulmonal or nasal delivery than the corresponding unconjugated peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResistance of a peptide to degradation by for instance dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV (DPPIV) is determined by the following degradation assay: Aliquots of the peptide (5 nmol) are incubated at 37° C. with 1 μL of purified dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV corresponding to an enzymatic activity of 5 mU for 10-180 minutes in 100 μL of 0.1 M triethylamine-HCl buffer, pH 7.4. Enzymatic reactions are terminated by the addition of 5 μL of 10% trifluoroacetic acid, and the peptide degradation products are separated and quantified using HPLC analysis. One method for performing this analysis is: The mixtures are applied onto a Vydac C18 widepore (30 nm pores, 5 μm particles) 250×4.6 mm column and eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with linear stepwise gradients of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (0% acetonitrile for 3 min, 0-24% acetonitrile for 17 min, 24-48% acetonitrile for 1 min) according to Siegel et al., Regul. Pept. 79, 93-102 (1999) and Mentlein et al. Eur. J. Biochem. 214, 829-35 (1993). Peptides and their degradation products may be monitored by their absorbance at 220 nm (peptide bonds) or 280 nm (aromatic amino acids), and are quantified by integration of their peak areas related to those of standards. The rate of hydrolysis of a peptide by dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV is estimated at incubation times which result in less than 10% of the peptide being hydrolysed. The resistance to other plasma proteases or peptidases may be determined in similar ways. In one embodiment the rate of hydrolysis of the peptide, for instance growth hormone, conjugate is less than 70%, such as less than 40%, such as less than 10% of that of the parent peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe most abundant protein component in circulating blood of mammalian species is serum albumin, which is normally present at a concentration of approximately 3 to 4.5 grams per 100 mL of whole blood. Serum albumin is a blood protein of approximately 70,000 daltons which has several important functions in the circulatory system. It functions as a transporter of a variety of organic molecules found in the blood, as the main transporter of various metabolites such as fatty acids and bilirubin through the blood, and, owing to its abundance, as an osmotic regulator of the circulating blood. Serum albumin has a half-life of more than one week, and one approach to increasing the plasma half-life of peptides has been to conjugate to the peptide a group that binds to serum albumin. Albumin binding property may be determined as described in J. Med. Chem., 43, 1986-1992 (2000), which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the property modified by the property-modifying group is the functional in vivo half-life of the peptide compound. In a further embodiment the functional in vivo half-life of the peptide compound is increased as compared to the peptide compound without the property-modifying group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “increased” as used in connection with the functional in vivo half-life or plasma half-life is used to indicate that the relevant half-life of the peptide, for instance growth hormone, conjugate is statistically significantly increased relative to that of the parent peptide, as determined under comparable conditions. For instance the relevant half-life may be increased by at least about 25%, such as by at lest about 50%, for instance by at least about 100%, 150%, 200%, 250%, or 500%. In one embodiment the compounds of the present invention exhibit an increase in half-life of at least about 5 h, preferably at least about 24 h, more preferably at least about 72 h, and most preferably at least about 7 days, relative to the half-life of the parent GH.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the property modified by the property-modifying group is the in vivo plasma half-life of the peptide compound. In a further embodiment the in vivo plasma half-life of the peptide is increased as compared to the peptide compound without the property-modifying group. In a further embodiment the in vivo plasma half-life of the peptide is increased by 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, 10 hours, 1 days, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days, 7 days, 8 days, 9 days, 10 days, 11 days, 12 days, 13 days, 14 days, 15 days, 16 days, 17 days, 18 days, 19 days, 20 days, 21 days, 22 days, 23 days, 24 days, 25 days, 26 days, 27 days, 28 days, 29 days, or 30 days.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment R\n3 \nrepresents a linear or branched polymer or oligomer, optionally substituted with acidic or negatively charged functional groups (such as for instance carboxyl groups, tetrazolyl groups, acylsulfonyl groups, phosphonyl groups, boronic acid groups, phosphates, sulfates, etc), with basic or cationic functional groups (e.g. amino groups, ammonium groups, phosphonium groups), or with combinations thereof; or R\n3 \nrepresents a linear or branched C\n10\n-C\n90 \nalkyl group, optionally substituted with acidic or negatively charged functional groups (e.g. carboxyl groups, tetrazolyl groups, acylsulfonyl groups, phosphonyl groups, boronic acid groups, phosphates, sulfates, etc), with basic or cationic functional groups (e.g. amino groups, ammonium groups, phosphonium groups), or with combinations thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “polymer” as used herein is intended to indicate a large molecule consisting of structural units and repeating units connected by covalent chemical bonds. Polymers are distinguished from other molecules in the repetition of many identical, similar, or complementary molecular subunits, also known as monomers in these chains. The monomers are small molecules of low to moderate molecular weight, and are linked to each other by polymerization. Instead of being identical, similar monomers can have varying chemical substituents. The differences between monomers can affect properties such as solubility, flexibility, and strength. Polymers may be organic or inorganic. Examples of polymers for use with the present invention are linear or branched polyethylene glycol (PEG), poloxamer, poly(lactic acid), polylactide-glycolide copolymers, oligosaccharide, peptides, proteins, and linear or branched oligosaccharides selected from such as cellulose, starch, hyaluronic acid, agar, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl starch or pentosan, or combinations thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “oligomer” as used herein is intended to indicate a large molecule consisting of structural units and repeating units connected by covalent chemical bonds and which consists of a relatively small, known number of monomer units, in contrast to a polymer which consists of a large, unknown number of monomers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment R\n3 \nrepresents a linear or branched polyethylene glycol (PEG), poloxamer, poly(lactic acid), poly(lactide)-glycolide copolymer, oligosaccharide, peptides, proteins, or combinations thereof, optionally substituted with acidic or negatively charged functional groups, with basic or cationic functional groups, or with combinations thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “polyethylene glycol”, “Peg” or “PEG” (poly(ethylene glycol) means a polydisperse or monodisperse diradical of the structure\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein n is an integer larger than 1, and its molecular weight is between approximately 100 and approximately 1,000,000 Da.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “mPEG” or “mPeg” means a polydisperse or monodisperse radical of the structure\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein m is an integer larger than 1. Thus, an mPEG wherein m is 90 has a molecular weight of 3991 Da, i.e. approximately 4 kDa. Likewise, an mPEG with an average molecular weight of 20 kDa has an average m of 454. Due to the process for producing mPEG these molecules often have a distribution of molecular weights. This distribution is described by the polydispersity index.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDue to this distribution of m, mPEG with a molecular weight of 20 kDa may also be referred to as MeO—(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)\n400-500\n, mPEG with a molecular weight of 30 kDa may also be referred to as MeO—(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)\n600-700\n, and mPEG with a molecular weight of 40 kDa may also be referred to as MeO—(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)\n850-950\n. The heavier mPEG chains may be difficult to prepare as a single chain molecule, and they are thus made as branched mPEG. Notably, mPEG with a molecular weight of 40 kDa may be achieved with as a branched mPEG comprising to arms of 20 kDa each.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “polydispersity index” as used herein means the ratio between the weight average molecular weight and the number average molecular weight, as known in the art of polymer chemistry (see for instance “Polymer Synthesis and Characterization”, J. A. Nairn, University of Utah, 2003). The polydispersity index is a number which is greater than or equal to one, and it may be estimated from Gel Permeation Chromatographic data. When the polydispersity index is 1, the product is monodisperse and is thus made up of compounds with a single molecular weight. When the polydispersity index is greater than 1 it is a measure of the polydispersity of that polymer, i.e. how broad the distribution of polymers with different molecular weights is.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe use of for example “mPEG20000” in formulas, compound names or in molecular structures indicates an mPEG residue wherein mPEG is polydisperse and has a molecular weight of approximately 20 kDa.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe polydispersity index typically increases with the molecular weight of the PEG or mPEG. When reference is made to 20 kDa PEG and in particular 20 kDa mPEG it is intended to indicate a compound (or in fact a mixture of compounds) with a polydisperisty index below 1.06, such as below 1.05, such as below 1.04, such as below 1.03, such as between 1.02 and 1.03. When reference is made to 30 kDa PEG and in particular 30 kDa mPEG it is intended to indicate a compound (or in fact a mixture of compounds) with a polydisperisty index below 1.06, such as below 1.05, such as below 1.04, such as below 1.03, such as between 1.02 and 1.03. When reference is made to 40 kDa PEG and in particular 40 kDa mPEG it is intended to indicate a compound (or in fact a mixture of compounds) with a polydisperisty index below 1.06, such as below 1.05, such as below 1.04, such as below 1.03, such as between 1.02 and 1.03\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment R\n3 \nrepresents a linear or branched C\n10\n-C\n90 \nalkyl group, optionally substituted with acidic or negatively charged functional groups (e.g. carboxyl groups, tetrazolyl groups, acylsulfonyl groups, phosphonyl groups, boronic acid groups, phosphates, sulfates, etc), with basic or cationic functional groups (e.g. amino groups, ammonium groups, phosphonium groups), or with combinations thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn formula (I), Prot designates a peptide monoradical, that is a peptide having an unpaired electron. The unpaired electron may be present anywhere in the peptide, but will primarily be obtainable by removing a hydrogen atom from an NH group. In one embodiment the Prot radical is formed by the formal removal of a hydrogen atom from the N-terminal amino group. In one embodiment the Prot radical is formed by the formal removal of a hydrogen atom from an amino acid side chain.

A “lower cycloalkyl” is an cycloalkyl having from three to six carbon atoms, also denoted as C\n1-6\n-cycloalkyl. C\n1-6\n-cycloalkyl groups include for instance cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, 2-methyl-cyclopentyl, and cyclohexyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment Prot represents a peptide-derived radical generated by the formal removal of a hydrogen atom from an amino group (—NH\n2\n) of a peptide or protein, and wherein said amino group is the N-terminal amino group of the peptide, a side-chain amino group of lysine residue in the peptide, or a side-chain amino group of glutamine or asparagine (CONH\n2\n) residue in the peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment Prot represents a growth hormone-derived radical.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “growth hormone” or “GH” is intended to indicate a protein, which exhibits growth hormone activity as determined in assay I herein, or, when used in connection with structural formulas, a radical derived from such protein. hGH indicates the human growth hormone.

In one embodiment, the Prot radical is formed by the formal removal of a hydrogen atom from the side-chain aminocarbonyl group (H\n2\nN—CO—) of the glutamine at the position corresponding to position 141 in SEQ ID No. 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the growth hormone part of the growth hormone-derived radical is a variant of hGH, wherein a variant is understood to be the compound obtained by substituting one or more amino acid residues in the hGH sequence with another natural or unnatural amino acid; and/or by adding one or more natural or unnatural amino acids to the hGH sequence; and/or by deleting one or more amino acid residue from the hGH sequence, wherein any of these steps may optionally be followed by further derivatization of one or more amino acid residues, for instance by pegylation resulting in a di- or multi-pegylated growth hormone variant. In particular, such substitutions are conservative in the sense that one amino acid residue is substituted by another amino acid residue from the same group, i.e. by another amino acid residue with similar properties. Amino acids may conveniently be divided in the following groups based on their properties: Basic amino acids (such as arginine, histidine and lysine), acidic amino acids (such as glutamic acid and aspartic acid), polar amino acids (such as glutamine, histidine, cysteine and asparagine), hydrophobic amino acids (such as leucine, isoleucine, proline, methionine and valine), aromatic amino acids (such as phenylalanine, tryptophan, tyrosine) and small amino acids (such as glycine, alanine, serine and threonine).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the peptide may be extended with up to about 100 amino acid residues at the N-terminal as compared to the parent peptide. Such an N-terminally extended peptide may be described by the formula Z-XX-Prot, wherein Z represent serine or threonine, XX represents any sequence of 1-50 amino acids, and Prot represents the parent peptide. In one embodiment Z represents serine. In one embodiment XX represents a sequence with up to 40, such as up to 20, such as up to 10, such as up to 5, such as 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 amino acid residues. In one embodiment the peptide is hGH extended with up to 100 amino acid residues at the N-terminal as compared to SEQ ID No. 1. In particular, said extension is up to 50, such as up to 40, such as up to 20, such as up to 10, such as up to 5, such as 1, 2 or 3 amino acid residues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the peptide has at least 80%, such as at least 85%, such as at least 90%, such as at least 95% identity with the amino acid sequence in SEQ ID No. 1. In one embodiment said identity is coupled to at least 20%, such as at least 40%, such as at least 60%, such as at least 80% of the growth hormone activity of hGH as determined in assay I herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “identity” as known in the art, refers to a relationship between the sequences of two or more peptides, as determined by comparing the sequences. In the art, “identity” also means the degree of sequence relatedness between peptides, as determined by the number of matches between strings of two or more amino acid residues. “Identity” measures the percent of identical matches between the smaller of two or more sequences with gap alignments (if any) addressed by a particular mathematical model or computer program (i.e., “algorithms”). Identity of related peptides can be readily calculated by known methods. Such methods include, but are not limited to, those described in Computational Molecular Biology, Lesk, A. M., ed., Oxford University Press, New York, 1988; Biocomputing: Informatics and Genome Projects, Smith, D. W., ed., Academic Press, New York, 1993; Computer Analysis of Sequence Data, \nPart\n 1, Griffin, A. M., and Griffin, H. G., eds., Humana Press, New Jersey, 1994; Sequence Analysis in Molecular Biology, von Heinje, G., Academic Press, 1987; Sequence Analysis Primer, Gribskov, M. and Devereux, J., eds., M. Stockton Press, New York, 1991; and Carillo et al., SIAM J. Applied Math. 48, 1073 (1988).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred methods to determine identity are designed to give the largest match between the sequences tested. Methods to determine identity are described in publicly available computer programs. Preferred computer program methods to determine identity between two sequences include the GCG program package, including GAP (Devereux et al., Nucl. Acid. Res. 12, 387 (1984); Genetics Computer Group, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wis.), BLASTP, BLASTN, and FASTA (Altschul et al., J. Mol. Biol. 215, 403-410 (1990)). The BLASTX program is publicly available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and other sources (BLAST Manual, Altschul et al. NCB/NLM/NIH Bethesda, Md. 20894; Altschul et al., supra). The well known Smith Waterman algorithm may also be used to determine identity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, using the computer algorithm GAP (Genetics Computer Group, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wis.), two peptides for which the percent sequence identity is to be determined are aligned for optimal matching of their respective amino acids (the “matched span”, as determined by the algorithm). A gap opening penalty (which is calculated as 3.times. the average diagonal; the “average diagonal” is the average of the diagonal of the comparison matrix being used; the “diagonal” is the score or number assigned to each perfect amino acid match by the particular comparison matrix) and a gap extension penalty (which is usually 1/10 times the gap opening penalty), as well as a comparison matrix such as PAM 250 or BLOSUM 62 are used in conjunction with the algorithm. A standard comparison matrix (see Dayhoff et al., Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure, vol. 5, supp. 3 (1978) for the PAM 250 comparison matrix; Henikoff et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89, 10915-10919 (1992) for the BLOSUM 62 comparison matrix) is also used by the algorithm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred parameters for a peptide sequence comparison include the following:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlgorithm: Needleman et al., J. Mol. Biol. 48, 443-453 (1970); Comparison matrix: BLOSUM 62 from Henikoff et al., PNAS USA 89, 10915-10919 (1992); Gap Penalty: 12, Gap Length Penalty: 4, Threshold of Similarity: 0.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe GAP program is useful with the above parameters. The aforementioned parameters are the default parameters for peptide comparisons (along with no penalty for end gaps) using the GAP algorithm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment Prot represents an antibody-derived radical. In one embodiment Prot represents a radical derived from a fragment of an antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “antibody” is intended to indicate an immunoglobulin molecule or a derivative of either thereof, which has the ability to specifically bind to an antigen under typical physiological conditions for significant periods of time such as at least about 30 minutes, at least about 45 minutes, at least about one hour, at least about two hours, at least about four hours, at least about 8 hours, at least about 12 hours, about 24 hours or more, about 48 hours or more, about 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or more days, etc., or any other relevant functionally-defined period (such as a time sufficient to induce, promote, enhance, and/or modulate a physiological response associated with antibody binding to the antigen). The term antibody also includes diabodies and single chain antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, although the two domains of the Fv fragment, V\nL \nand V\nH\n, are coded for by separate genes, they may be joined, using recombinant methods, by a synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a single peptide chain in which the V\nL \nand V\nH \nregions pair to form monovalent molecules (known as single chain antibodies or single chain Fv (scFv), see for instance Bird et al., Science 242, 423-426 (1988) and Huston et al., PNAS USA 85, 5879-5883 (1988)). Such single chain antibodies are encompassed within the term antibody unless otherwise noted or clearly indicated by context. Other forms of single chain antibodies, such as diabodies are included within the term antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt also should be understood that the term antibody also generally includes polyclonal antibodies, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), antibody-like polypeptides, such as chimeric antibodies and humanized antibodies, and anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies to antibodies. An antibody as generated can possess any isotype.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “immunoglobulin” refers to a class of structurally related glycoproteins consisting of two pairs of polypeptide chains, one pair of light (L) low molecular weight chains and one pair of heavy (H) chains, all four inter-connected by disulfide bonds. The structure of immunoglobulins has been well characterized. See for instance Fundamental Immunology Ch. 7 (Paul, W., ed., 2nd ed. Raven Press, N.Y. (1989)). Briefly, each heavy chain typically is comprised of a heavy chain variable region (abbreviated herein as V\nH\n) and a heavy chain constant region. The heavy chain constant region typically is comprised of three domains, \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1, \nC\n \n \n \nH\n2, and \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3. Each light chain typically is comprised of a light chain variable region (abbreviated herein as V\nL\n) and a light chain constant region. The light chain constant region typically is comprised of one domain, C\nL\n. The V\nH \nand V\nL \nregions may be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability (or hypervariable regions which may be hypervariable in sequence and/or form of structurally defined loops), also termed complementarity determining regions (CDRs), interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed framework regions (FRs). Each V\nH \nand V\nL \nis typically composed of three CDRs and four FRs, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus in the following order: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4 (see also Chothia and Lesk J. Mol. Biol. 196, 901-917 (1987)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “fragment of an antibody” or “antibody-fragment” is intended to indicate a fragment of an antibody which fragment retains the ability to specifically bind to an antigen. Examples of binding fragments encompassed within the term “antibody” include (i) a Fab fragment, a monovalent fragment consisting of the V\nL\n, V\nH\n, C\nL \nand \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 domains; (ii) F(ab)\n2 \nand F(ab′)\n2 \nfragments, bivalent fragments comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; (iii) a Fd fragment consisting essentially of the V\nH \nand \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 domains; (iv) a Fv fragment consisting essentially of the V\nL \nand V\nH \ndomains of a single arm of an antibody, (v) a dAb fragment (Ward et al., Nature 341, 544-546 (1989)), which consists essentially of a V\nH \ndomain; and (vi) an isolated complementarity determining region (CDR). The antibody fragments may be provided by any known technique, such as enzymatic cleavage, peptide synthesis, and recombinant techniques.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of structural formulas for compounds of formula I comprise:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-limiting examples of compounds of formula (I) comprise:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nand pharmaceutically acceptable salts, prodrugs and solvates thereof, wherein GH represents a radical formed from a growth hormone, for instance human growth hormone, wherein the GH radical is formed by removal of one hydrogen atom from the N-terminal amino group. These compounds can be prepared by periodate-mediated oxidation of Ser-GH (growth hormone extended at the N-terminus with one serine), followed by condensation of the resulting aldehyde with a 4-aminobenzamide and reduction of the resulting imine with NaCNBH\n3 \nor another suitable reducting agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-limiting examples of compounds of formula (I) comprise:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nand pharmaceutically acceptable salts, prodrugs and solvates thereof, wherein hGH(40) represents a radical formed by the formal removal of one hydrogen atom from the side-chain aminocarbonyl group (H\n2\nN—CO—) of glutamine at position 40 in human growth hormone (hGH). These compounds can be prepared by transglutaminase-mediated transamination of hGH with 1,3-diamino-2-propanol, followed by periodate-mediated oxidation to an aldehyde of the formula H—CO—CH\n2\n-hGH(40), followed by imine-formation with a 4-aminobenzamide and reduction of the resulting imine with NaCNBH\n3 \nor another suitable reducting agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-limiting examples of compounds of formula (I) comprise:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nand pharmaceutically acceptable salts, prodrugs and solvates thereof, wherein hGH(141) represents a radical formed by removal of one hydrogen atom from the side-chain aminocarbonyl group (H\n2\nN—CO—) of glutamine at position 141 in human growth hormone (hGH). These compounds can be prepared by transglutaminase-mediated transamination of hGH with 1,3-diamino-2-propanol, followed by periodate-mediated oxidation to an aldehyde of the formula H—CO—CH\n2\n-hGH(141), followed by imine-formation with a 4-aminobenzamide and reduction of the resulting imine with NaCNBH\n3 \nor another suitable reducting agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNaCNBH\n3 \nis mentioned herein as an example of a suitable reducing agent. However, a number of other reagents may be considered as alternatives to NaCNBH\n3 \nas reducing agent for the conversion of imines into secondary amines. Thus, imines derived from oxidized carbohydrates and proteins have been reduced in aqueous solution with the commercially available adduct of borane (BH\n3\n) and pyridine (Hashimoto et al., J. Biochem. 123, 468-478 (1998); Yoshida and Lee, Carbohydr. Res 251, 175-186 (1994)). Related reagents are adducts of borane and dimethylsulfide, phosphines, phosphites, substituted pyridines, pyrimidines, imidazoles, pyrazoles, thiazoles, sulfides, ethers, and the like. Further alternatives to NaCNBH\n3 \nare catalytic hydrogenation (heterogeneous or homogeneous), NaBH\n4\n, (Ehrenfreund-Kleinmann et al., Biomaterials 23, 1327-1335 (2002); Zito and Martinez-Carrion, J. Biol. Chem. 255, 8645-8649 (1980)), NaHB(OAc)\n3 \n(Drummond et al., \nProteomics\n 1, 304-310 (2001)), NADPH (the reduced form of NADP, nicotineamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) or related dihydropyridines (Itoh et al., Tetrahedron Lett. 43, 3105-3108 (2002)), or mixtures of NaBH\n4 \nand AcOH. NADPH may also be used in combination with a suitable enzyme, such as glutamate dehydrogenase (Fisher et al., J. Biol. Chem. 257, 13208-13210 (1982)). Each of these reagents may require adjustment of the pH of the solution, in order to provide for a high rate of imine-reduction if compared to the rate of hydrogen-formation (hydronium ion reduction). Thus, some reagents may reduce the imine under neutral or basic reaction conditions, whereas other reagents may require more acidic reaction conditions. Furthermore, some of these reagents may require the use of cosolvents, such as formamide, NMP, acetonitrile, ethylene glycol, isopropanol, and the like, in order to improve the solubility of all reactants or in order to reduce the concentration of water, and thus the rate of hydronium ion reduction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “prodrug” includes biohydrolyzable amides and biohydrolyzable esters, acetals, aminals, thioaminals, thioacetals, and hydrazones, and also encompasses a) compounds in which the biohydrolyzable functionality in such a prodrug is encompassed in the compound according to the present invention, and b) compounds which may be oxidized or reduced biologically at a given functional group to yield drug substances according to the present invention. Examples of these functional groups include 1,4-dihydropyridine, N-alkylcarbonyl-1,4-dihydropyridine, 1,4-cyclohexadiene, tert-butyl, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “biohydrolyzable ester” is an ester of a drug substance (in casu, a compound according to the invention) which either a) does not interfere with the biological activity of the parent substance but confers on that substance advantageous properties in vivo such as duration of action, onset of action, and the like, or b) is biologically inactive but is readily converted in vivo by the subject to the biologically active principle. The advantage is, for example increased solubility or that the biohydrolyzable ester is absorbed from the gut and is transformed to a compound according to the present invention in plasma. Many examples of such are known in the art and include by way of example lower alkyl esters (for instance C\n1\n-C\n4\n-alkyl), lower acyloxyalkyl esters, lower alkoxyacyloxyalkyl esters, alkoxyacyloxy esters, alkyl acylamino alkyl esters, and choline esters.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “biohydrolyzable amide” is an amide of a drug substance (in casu, a compound according to the present invention) which either a) does not interfere with the biological activity of the parent substance but confers on that substance advantageous properties in vivo such as duration of action, onset of action, and the like, or b) is biologically inactive but is readily converted in vivo by the subject to the biologically active principle. The advantage is, for example increased solubility or that the biohydrolyzable amide is absorbed from the gut and is transformed to a compound according to the present invention in plasma. Many examples of such are known in the art and include by way of example lower alkyl amides, α-amino acid amides, alkoxyacyl amides, and alkylaminoalkylcarbonyl amides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the present context, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” is intended to indicate salts which are not harmful to the patient. Such salts include pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts, pharmaceutically acceptable metal salts, ammonium and alkylated ammonium salts. Acid addition salts include salts of inorganic acids as well as organic acids. Representative examples of suitable inorganic acids include hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, phosphoric, sulfuric, nitric acids and the like. Representative examples of suitable organic acids include formic, acetic, trichloroacetic, trifluoroacetic, propionic, benzoic, cinnamic, citric, fumaric, glycolic, lactic, maleic, malic, malonic, mandelic, oxalic, picric, pyruvic, salicylic, succinic, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, tartaric, ascorbic, pamoic, bismethylene salicylic, ethanedisulfonic, gluconic, citraconic, aspartic, stearic, palmitic, EDTA, glycolic, p-aminobenzoic, glutamic, benzenesulfonic, p-toluenesulfonic acids and the like. Further examples of pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic acid addition salts include the pharmaceutically acceptable salts listed in J. Pharm. Sci. 66, 2 (1977), which is incorporated herein by reference. Examples of metal salts include lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium salts and the like. Examples of ammonium and alkylated ammonium salts include ammonium, methylammonium, dimethylammonium, trimethylammonium, ethylammonium, hydroxyethylammonium, diethylammonium, butylammonium, tetramethylammonium salts and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “solvate” is a complex of defined stoichiometry formed by a solute and a solvent. Solvents may be, by way of example, water, ethanol, or acetic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the invention relates to methods of improving the pharmacological properties of a peptide, such as growth hormone, the method comprising preparing a conjugated peptide as described below. In particular, improving the pharmacological properties is intended to indicate an increase in the functional in vivo half-life, the plasma in vivo half-life, the mean residence time, or an decrease in the clearance as also described elsewhere herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the invention relates to a method of preparing a compound of formula (I), said method comprising the steps of\n\n \n \n \n \n \n(a) treatment of an aldehyde or ketone derived from the peptide compound with a property-modifying group-derived aniline or heteroarylamine to yield an imine or a hemiaminal,\n \n(b) treatment of this imine or hemiaminal with a suitable reducing agent to yield a secondary amine.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the property modified by the property-modifying group is the functional in vivo half-life of the peptide compound with the property-modifying group, as compared to the peptide compound without said property-modifying group. In one embodiment the functional in vivo half-life of the peptide compound is increased as compared to the peptide compound without the property-modifying group. in a further embodiment, the approximate functional in vivo half-life of the peptide is increased by 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, 10 hours, 1 days, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days, 7 days, 8 days, 9 days, 10 days, 11 days, 12 days, 13 days, 14 days, 15 days, 16 days, 17 days, 18 days, 19 days, 20 days, 21 days, 22 days, 23 days, 24 days, 25 days, 26 days, 27 days, 28 days, 29 days, or 30 days.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptide-derived aldehydes or ketones may be prepared by several routes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the peptide-derived aldehyde or ketone is prepared by periodate-mediated oxidation of a peptide containing serine or threonine as the N-terminal amino acid. Such peptide may either be a natural peptide, or may be prepared by standard genetic modification of \nE. coli \nor other suitable cells to produce the desired, recombinant variant of the peptide of interest. Alternatively, one or more amino acids comprising an N-terminal serine or threonine may be attached to the N-terminal position of a peptide, such as for instance hGH, by means of an enzyme, for instance an aminopeptidase, in the presence of a large excess of said amino acid(s). The serine or threonine added to the peptide need not be attached directly to the N-terminal amino acid residue. One or more amino acid residues may be inserted between the serine or threonine and the original N-terminus. In this embodiment, the resulting serine- or threonine-comprising peptide may be described by the formula Z-XX-Prot, such as Z-XX-hGH, wherein Z represent serine or threonine, XX represents any sequence of 1-50 amino acids, and Prot represents the peptide, for instance growth hormone. In one embodiment Z represents serine. In one embodiment XX represents a sequence with up to 40, such as up to 20, such as up to 10, such as up to 5, such as 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 amino acid residues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the peptide-derived aldehyde or ketone, is prepared by periodate-mediated oxidation of a derivative of the peptide, in which one or several of the available side-chains of asparagine or glutamine have been used to acylate an amine of the general formula H\n2\nN—CH\n2\n—CH(R\n7\n)—CH\n2\n—NH\n2\n, wherein R\n7 \nrepresents OH, SH, or NH\n2\n. Such an acylation may be accomplished selectively by treating a peptide, such as for instance hGH, with an excess of said amine and a suitable enzyme, such as a glutamyl or aspartyl transpeptidase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the peptide-derived aldehyde or ketone is prepared by periodate-mediated oxidation of a peptide compound containing a 2-aminoethanol substructure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment a peptide-derived aldehyde is prepared by periodate-mediated oxidation of a peptide transaminated enzymatically with 1,3-diamino-2-propanol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment a peptide-derived aldehyde or ketone is prepared by coupling a thiol of the general formula HS—R\n8\n—C(═O)—R\n9\n, wherein R\n8 \nrepresents an organic diradical, and R\n9 \nrepresents hydrogen or an organic radical, to one of the available tyrosine residues by means of a tyrosinase, for instance a mushroom tyrosinase, as described in the literature (S. Ito et al., J. Med. Chem. 24, 673-677 (1981)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment a peptide-derived aldehyde is prepared by coupling a thiol of the general formula HS—R\n10\n—CH(R\n11\n)—CH\n2\n—R\n12\n, wherein R\n10 \nrepresents an organic diradical, and R\n11 \nand R\n12 \nindependently of each other represents OH or NH\n2\n, by means of a tyrosinase, for instance a mushroom tyrosinase, as described in the literature (S. Ito et al., J. Med. Chem. 24, 673-677 (1981))., followed by periodate-mediated oxidation of the resulting product.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment a peptide-derived aldehyde or ketone is prepared by amide formation of the carboxy-terminal amino acid of the peptide with an unnatural α-amino acid amide, which contains a ketone or an aldehyde as side-chain functional group. Such an unnatural α-amino acid amide may be coupled with the peptide with the aid of an enzyme, such as a carboxypeptidase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment a peptide-derived aldehyde or ketone is obtained by regioselective alkylation of the N-terminal amino group with a compound comprising a moiety which subsequently can be transformed into an aldehyde or a ketone, by exploiting the lower basicity of the N-terminal amino group if compared to the lysine side-chain amino groups (see US 20040127417).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment a peptide-derived aldehyde or ketone is prepared by hydrolysis of an acetal or a hemiacetal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment a peptide-derived aldehyde or ketone is prepared by feeding a genetically modified or unmodified organism producing said peptide with an unnatural amino acid containing an aldehyde or ketone functionality, wherein said amino acid will be incorporated into the peptide, followed by isolation and purification of the peptide into which the unnatural amino acid has been incorporated. This can be, for instance, also achieved by means of a mutated tRNA synthetase, as described in the literature (Tsao et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 128, 4572-4573 (2006), and articles cited therein). Use of this method may provide control over the position at which the property-modifying group is inserted as the unnatural amino acid will be incorporated at a certain codon, the position of which can be chosen as desired. In one embodiment said unnatural amino acid is (acetylphenyl)alanine or (formylphenyl)alanine. In one embodiment the mRNA encoding the peptide comprises at least one codon encoding phenylalanine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptide part of the peptide-derived aldehyde or ketone may be any peptide, for which the conjugation to a property-modifying group is desirable. The peptide may thus be a therapeutically effective peptide. There are myriads of therapeutically effective and interesting peptides in the scientific literature and the patent literature, and it is well-known that property-modification of such peptides may provide therapeutical benefits or other benefits. For instance will an increase in functional in vivo half-life be interesting for a number of these peptides, but there is also other examples of interesting properties to be modified as described elsewhere herein. The person skilled in the art is quite capable of determining which peptides would benefit from a derivatization according to the present invention. The methods and compounds of the invention are thus not limited by the nature of the peptide chosen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the peptide is a growth hormone. In one embodiment the peptide is human growth hormone. In one embodiment the peptide is human growth hormone (hGH) which comprises the amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID No. 1. In one embodiment the growth hormone part of the growth hormone-derived radical is a variant of hGH as described elsewhere herein. In one embodiment the peptide is growth hormone, such as human growth hormone, extended with up to about 100 amino acid residues at the N-terminal as compared to the parent peptide as described elsewhere herein. In one embodiment the peptide is a growth hormone, for instance human growth hormone, such as a human growth hormone having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID No. 1, which growth hormone has been N-terminally extended with one residue, wherein this residue is serine or threonine. In one embodiment the peptide is has at least 80%, such as at least 85%, such as at least 90%, such as at least 95% identity with the amino acid sequence in SEQ ID No. 1. In one embodiment said identity is coupled to at least 20%, such as at least 40%, such as at least 60%, such as at least 80% of the growth hormone activity of hGH as determined in assay I herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the growth hormone peptide is derivatized with the aldehyde or ketone functionality in the position corresponding to position 40 in SEQ ID No. 1 and in another embodiment, the growth hormone peptide is derivatized with the aldehyde or ketone functionality in the position corresponding to position 141 in SEQ ID No. 1. This regioselective derivatization may be obtained by use of a suitable method as described above, for instance by transglutaminase-mediated coupling of hGH with 1,3-diamino-2-propanol, followed by periodate-mediated oxidation of the transaminated hGH to the corresponding aldehyde. In one embodiment GH is converted into an aldehyde by periodate-mediated oxidation of Ser-GH.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment Prot represents an antibody-derived radical. In one embodiment Prot represents a radical derived from a fragment of an antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptide part of the peptide-derived aldehyde or ketone may be prepared in a number of different ways depending on the nature of the peptide, such as for instance synthesis using standard protein synthesis techniques. In one embodiment however, the peptide is expressed in a suitable host after incorporation of a suitable nucleic acid construct into said host.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein the term “nucleic acid construct” is intended to indicate any nucleic acid molecule of cDNA, genomic DNA, synthetic DNA or RNA origin. The term “construct” is intended to indicate a nucleic acid segment which may be single- or double-stranded, and which may be based on a complete or partial nucleotide sequence encoding a peptide of interest. The construct may optionally contain other nucleic acid segments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nucleic acid construct of the invention encoding the peptide of interest may suitably be of genomic or cDNA origin, for instance obtained by preparing a genomic or cDNA library and screening for DNA sequences coding for all or part of the peptide by hybridization using synthetic oligonucleotide probes in accordance with standard techniques (cf. J. Sambrook, E. F. Fritsch, and T. Maniatus, 1989, Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 2d edition, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.). In one embodiment the DNA sequence encoding the peptide, such as a growth hormone, is of human origin, i.e. derived from a human genomic DNA or cDNA library. In particular, the DNA sequence may be of human origin, for instance cDNA from a particular human organ or cell type or a gene derived from human genomic DNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nucleic acid construct encoding the peptide may also be prepared synthetically by established standard methods, for instance the phosphoamidite method described by Beaucage and Caruthers, Tetrahedron Letters 22, 1859-1869 (1981), or the method described by Matthes et al., \nEMBO Journal\n 3, 801-805 (1984). According to the phosphoamidite method, oligonucleotides are synthesized, for instance in an automatic DNA synthesizer, purified, annealed, ligated and cloned in suitable vectors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, the nucleic acid construct may be of mixed synthetic and genomic, mixed synthetic and cDNA or mixed genomic and cDNA origin prepared by ligating fragments of synthetic, genomic or cDNA origin (as appropriate), the fragments corresponding to various parts of the entire nucleic acid construct, in accordance with standard techniques.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nucleic acid construct may also be prepared by polymerase chain reaction using specific primers, for instance as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,683,202 or Saiki et al., Science 239, 487-491 (1988).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the nucleic acid construct is a DNA construct which term will be used as an example of a nucleic acid construct in the following.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe DNA construct encoding the peptide of interest may be inserted into a recombinant vector. The recombinant vector into which the DNA construct is inserted may be any vector which may conveniently be subjected to recombinant DNA procedures, and the choice of vector will often depend on the host cell into which it is to be introduced. Thus, the vector may be an autonomously replicating vector, i.e. a vector which exists as an extrachromosomal entity, the replication of which is independent of chromosomal replication, for instance a plasmid. Alternatively, the vector may be one which, when introduced into a host cell, is integrated into the host cell genome and replicated together with the chromosome(s) into which it has been integrated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe vector may be an expression vector in which the DNA sequence encoding the peptide of interest is operably linked to additional segments required for transcription of the DNA. In general, the expression vector is derived from plasmid or viral DNA, or may contain elements of both. The term “operably linked” indicates that the segments are arranged so that they function in concert for their intended purposes, for instance transcription initiates in a promoter and proceeds through the DNA sequence coding for the peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe promoter may be any DNA sequence which shows transcriptional activity in the host cell of choice and may be derived from genes encoding proteins either homologous or heterologous to the host cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of suitable promoters for directing the transcription of the DNA encoding a peptide, such as growth hormone, in mammalian cells are the SV40 promoter (Subramani et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 1, 854-864 (1981)), the MT-1 (metallothionein gene) promoter (Palmiter et al., Science 222, 809-814 (1983)) or the \nadenovirus\n 2 major late promoter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn example of a suitable promoter for use in insect cells is the polyhedrin promoter (U.S. Pat. No. 4,745,051; Vasuvedan et al., FEBS Lett. 311, 7-11 (1992)), the P10 promoter (J. M. Vlak et al., J. Gen. Virology 69, 765-776 (1988), the \nAutographa californica \npolyhedrosis virus basic protein promoter (EP 397 485), the baculovirus immediate \nearly gene\n 1 promoter (U.S. Pat. No. 5,155,037; U.S. Pat. No. 5,162,222), or the baculovirus 39K delayed-early gene promoter (U.S. Pat. No. 5,155,037; U.S. Pat. No. 5,162,222).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of suitable promoters for use in yeast host cells include promoters from yeast glycolytic genes (Hitzeman et al., J. Biol. Chem. 255, 12073-12080 (1980); Alber and Kawasaki, J. Mol. Appl. Gen. 1, 419-434 (1982)) or alcohol dehydrogenase genes (Young et al., in Genetic Engineering of Microorganisms for Chemicals (Hollaender et al, eds.), Plenum Press, New York, 1982), or the TPI1 (U.S. Pat. No. 4,599,311) or ADH2-4-c (Russell et al., Nature 304, 652-654 (1983)) promoters.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of suitable promoters for use in filamentous fungus host cells are, for instance, the ADH3 promoter (McKnight et al., The EMBO J. 4, 2093-2099 (1985)) or the tpiA promoter. Examples of other useful promoters are those derived from the gene encoding \nA. oryzae \nTAKA amylase, \nRhizomucor miehei \naspartic proteinase, \nA. niger \nneutral α-amylase, \nA. niger \nacid stable α-amylase, \nA. niger \nor \nA. awamori \nglucoamylase (gluA), \nRhizomucor miehei \nlipase, \nA. oryzae \nalkaline protease, \nA. oryzae \ntriose phosphate isomerase or \nA. nidulans \nacetamidase. Preferred are the TAKA-amylase and gluA promoters.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of suitable promoters for use in bacterial host cells include the promoter of the \nBacillus stearothermophilus \nmaltogenic amylase gene, the \nBacillus licheniformis \nalpha-amylase gene, the \nBacillus amyloliquefaciens \nBAN amylase gene, the \nBacillus subtilis \nalkaline protease gen, or the \nBacillus pumilus \nxylosidase gene, or by the phage Lambda P\nR \nor P\nL \npromoters or the \nE. coli \nlac, trp or tac promoters.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe DNA sequence encoding the peptide, such as a growth hormone, may also, if necessary, be operably connected to a suitable terminator, such as the human growth hormone terminator (Palmiter et al., op. cit.) or (for fungal hosts) the TPI1 (Alber and Kawasaki, op. cit.) or ADH3 (McKnight et al., op. cit.) terminators. The vector may further comprise elements such as polyadenylation signals (for instance from SV40 or the \nadenovirus\n 5 Elb region), transcriptional enhancer sequences (for instance the SV40 enhancer) and translational enhancer sequences (for instance the ones encoding adenovirus VA RNAs).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe recombinant vector may further comprise a DNA sequence enabling the vector to replicate in the host cell in question. An example of such a sequence (when the host cell is a mammalian cell) is the SV40 origin of replication.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the host cell is a yeast cell, suitable sequences enabling the vector to replicate are the yeast plasmid 2μ replication genes REP 1-3 and origin of replication.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the host cell is a bacterial cell, sequences enabling the vector to replicate are DNA polymerase III complex encoding genes and origin of replication.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe vector may also comprise a selectable marker, for instance a gene the product of which complements a defect in the host cell, such as the gene coding for dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) or the \nSchizosaccharomyces pombe \nTPI gene (described by P. R. Russell, Gene 40, 125-130 (1985), or one which confers resistance to a drug, for instance ampicillin, kanamycin, tetracyclin, chloramphenicol, neomycin, hygromycin or methotrexate. For filamentous fungi, selectable markers include amdS, pyrG, argB, niaD and sC.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo direct the peptide into the secretory pathway of the host cells, a secretory signal sequence (also known as a leader sequence, prepro sequence or pre sequence) may be provided in the recombinant vector. The secretory signal sequence is joined to the DNA sequence encoding the peptide in the correct reading frame. Secretory signal sequences are commonly positioned 5′ to the DNA sequence encoding the peptide. The secretory signal sequence may be that which is normally associated with the peptide or may be from a gene encoding another secreted peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor secretion from yeast cells, the secretory signal sequence may encode any signal peptide which ensures efficient direction of the expressed peptide into the secretory pathway of the cell. The signal peptide may be naturally occurring signal peptide, or a functional part thereof, or it may be a synthetic peptide. Suitable signal peptides have been found to be the α-factor signal peptide (cf. U.S. Pat. No. 4,870,008), the signal peptide of mouse salivary amylase (cf. O. Hagenbuchle et al., Nature 289, 643-646 (1981)), a modified carboxypeptidase signal peptide (cf. L. A. Valls et al., Cell 48, 887-897 (1987)), the yeast BAR1 signal peptide (cf. WO 87/02670), or the yeast aspartic protease 3 (YAP3) signal peptide (cf. M. Egel-Mitani et al., \nYeast\n 6, 127-137 (1990)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor efficient secretion in yeast, a sequence encoding a leader peptide may also be inserted downstream of the signal sequence and uptream of the DNA sequence encoding the peptide. The function of the leader peptide is to allow the expressed peptide to be directed from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus and further to a secretory vesicle for secretion into the culture medium (i.e. exportation of the peptide across the cell wall or at least through the cellular membrane into the periplasmic space of the yeast cell). The leader peptide may be the yeast α-factor leader (the use of which is described in for instance U.S. Pat. No. 4,546,082, EP 16 201, EP 123 294, EP 123 544 and EP 163 529). Alternatively, the leader peptide may be a synthetic leader peptide, which is to say a leader peptide not found in nature. Synthetic leader peptides may, for instance, be constructed as described in WO 89/02463 or WO 92/11378.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor use in filamentous fungi, the signal peptide may conveniently be derived from a gene encoding an \nAspergillus \nsp. amylase or glucoamylase, a gene encoding a \nRhizomucor miehei \nlipase or protease or a \nHumicola lanuginosa \nlipase. The signal peptide is preferably derived from a gene encoding \nA. oryzae \nTAKA amylase, \nA. niger \nneutral α-amylase, \nA. niger \nacid-stable amylase, or \nA. niger \nglucoamylase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor use in insect cells, the signal peptide may conveniently be derived from an insect gene (cf. WO 90/05783), such as the lepidopteran \nManduca sexta \nadipokinetic hormone precursor signal peptide (cf. U.S. Pat. No. 5,023,328).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe procedures used to ligate the DNA sequences coding for the peptide of interest, the promoter and optionally the terminator and/or secretory signal sequence, respectively, and to insert them into suitable vectors containing the information necessary for replication, are well known to persons skilled in the art (cf., for instance, Sambrook et al., op.cit.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe host cell into which the DNA construct or the recombinant vector is introduced may be any cell which is capable of producing the encoded peptide and includes bacteria, yeast, fungi and higher eukaryotic cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of bacterial host cells which, on cultivation, are capable of producing GH are grampositive bacteria such as strains of \nBacillus\n, such as strains of \nB. subtilis, B. licheniformis, B. lentus, B. brevis, B. stearothermophilus, B. alkalophilus, B. amyloliquefaciens, B. coagulans, B. circulans, B. lautus, B. megatherium \nor \nB. thuringiensis\n, or strains of \nStreptomyces\n, such as \nS. lividans \nor \nS. murinus\n, or gramnegative bacteria such as \nEcherichia coli\n. The transformation of the bacteria may be effected by protoplast transformation or by using competent cells in a manner known per se (cf. Sambrook et al., supra).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen expressing a peptide in bacteria such as \nE. coli\n, the peptide may be retained in the cytoplasm, typically as insoluble granules (known as inclusion bodies), or may be directed to the periplasmic space by a bacterial secretion sequence. In the former case, the cells are lysed and the granules are recovered and denatured after which the peptide is refolded by diluting the denaturing agent. In the latter case, the peptide may be recovered from the periplasmic space by disrupting the cells, for instance by sonication or osmotic shock, to release the contents of the periplasmic space and recovering the peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of suitable mammalian cell lines are the COS (ATCC CRL 1650), BHK (ATCC CRL 1632, ATCC CCL 10), CHL (ATCC CCL39) or CHO (ATCC CCL 61) cell lines. Methods of transfecting mammalian cells and expressing DNA sequences introduced in the cells are described in for instance Kaufman and Sharp, J. Mol. Biol. 159, 601-621 (1982); Southern and Berg, J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1, 327-341 (1982); Loyter et al., PNAS USA 79, 422-426 (1982); Wigler et al., Cell 14, 725 (1978); Corsaro and Pearson, \nSomatic Cell Genetics\n 7, 603 (1981), Graham and van der Eb, Virology 52, 456 (1973); and Neumann et al., EMBO J. 1, 841-845 (1982).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of suitable yeast cells include cells of \nSaccharomyces \nspp. or \nSchizosaccharomyces \nspp., in particular strains of \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae \nor \nSaccharomyces kluyveri\n. Methods for transforming yeast cells with heterologous DNA and producing heterologous peptides therefrom are described, for instance in U.S. Pat. No. 4,599,311, U.S. Pat. No. 4,931,373, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,870,008, 5,037,743, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,845,075, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Transformed cells are selected by a phenotype determined by a selectable marker, commonly drug resistance or the ability to grow in the absence of a particular nutrient, for instance leucine. A suitable vector for use in yeast is the POT1 vector disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,931,373. The DNA sequence encoding a peptide of the invention may be preceded by a signal sequence and optionally a leader sequence, for instance as described above. Further examples of suitable yeast cells are strains of \nKluyveromyces\n, such as \nK. lactis, Hansenula\n, for instance \nH. polymorpha\n, or \nPichia\n, for instance \nP. pastoris \n(cf. Gleeson et al., J. Gen. Microbiol. 132, 3459-3465 (1986); U.S. Pat. No. 4,882,279).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of other fungal cells are cells of filamentous fungi, for instance \nAspergillus \nspp., \nNeurospora \nspp., \nFusarium \nspp. or \nTrichoderma \nspp., in particular strains of \nA. oryzae, A. nidulans \nor \nA. niger\n. The use of \nAspergillus \nspp. for the expression of peptides is described in, for instance, EP 272 277 and EP 230 023. The transformation of \nF. oxysporum \nmay, for instance, be carried out as described by Malardier et al., Gene 78, 147-156 (1989).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen a filamentous fungus is used as the host cell, it may be transformed with the DNA construct, conveniently by integrating the DNA construct in the host chromosome to obtain a recombinant host cell. This integration is generally considered to be an advantage as the DNA sequence is more likely to be stably maintained in the cell. Integration of the DNA constructs into the host chromosome may be performed according to conventional methods, for instance by homologous or heterologous recombination.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTransformation of insect cells and production of heterologous peptides therein may be performed as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,745,051; U.S. Pat. No. 4,879,236; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,155,037; 5,162,222; EP 397,485) all of which are incorporated herein by reference. The insect cell line used as the host may suitably be a \nLepidoptera \ncell line, such as \nSpodoptera frugiperda \ncells or \nTrichoplusia ni \ncells (cf. U.S. Pat. No. 5,077,214). Culture conditions may suitably be as described in, for instance, WO 89/01029 or WO 89/01028, or any of the aforementioned references.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe transformed or transfected host cell described above is then cultured in a suitable nutrient medium under conditions permitting the expression of the peptide of interest, after which the resulting peptide is recovered from the culture.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe medium used to culture the cells may be any conventional medium suitable for growing the host cells, such as minimal or complex media containing appropriate supplements. Suitable media are available from commercial suppliers or may be prepared according to published recipes (for instance in catalogues of the American Type Culture Collection). The peptide produced by the cells may then be recovered from the culture medium by conventional procedures including separating the host cells from the medium by centrifugation or filtration, precipitating the proteinaceous components of the supernatant or filtrate by means of a salt, for instance ammonium sulphate, purification by a variety of chromatographic procedures, for instance ion exchange chromatography, gelfiltration chromatography, affinity chromatography, or the like, dependent on the specific peptide in question.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe conjugated peptides, such as growth hormones obtainable by use of a method according to the invention used may also be derivatized by other means, if so desired. Such additional derivatization may be performed before, during or after use of the steps of the method of the invention. It is within the skill of a person skilled in the art to determine the timing of such additional derivatisation. The peptide used may also already be conjugated to a property-modifying group at one or more further positions in addition to the site or sites to be conjugated according to the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the property-modifying group-derived aniline or heteroarylamine is of the formula\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein R\n1\n, R\n2\n, and R\n3 \nare as defined above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment R\n2 \nrepresents a bond, —C(═O)—, —C(═O)—NH—, or\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the property modified by the property-modifying group is the functional in vivo half-life of the peptide compound. In a further embodiment the functional in vivo half-life of the peptide compound is increased as compared to the peptide compound without the property-modifying group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the approximate functional in vivo half-life of the peptide is increased by 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, 10 hours, 1 days, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days, 7 days, 8 days, 9 days, 10 days, 11 days, 12 days, 13 days, 14 days, 15 days, 16 days, 17 days, 18 days, 19 days, 20 days, 21 days, 22 days, 23 days, 24 days, 25 days, 26 days, 27 days, 28 days, 29 days, or 30 days.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the property modified by the property-modifying group is the in vivo plasma half-life of the peptide compound. In a further embodiment the in vivo plasma half-life of the peptide is increased as compared to the peptide compound without the property-modifying group.

The term “aggregate formation” is intended to indicate a physical interaction between the peptide molecules that results in formation of oligomers, which may remain soluble, or large visible aggregates that precipitate from the solution. The term “during storage” is intended to indicate a liquid pharmaceutical composition or composition once prepared, is not immediately administered to a subject. Rather, following preparation, it is packaged for storage, either in a liquid form, in a frozen state, or in a dried form for later reconstitution into a liquid form or other form suitable for administration to a subject. The term “dried form” is intended to indicate the liquid pharmaceutical composition or composition is dried either by freeze drying (i.e., lyophilization; see, for example, Williams and Polli J. Parenteral Sci. Technol. 38, 48-59 (1984)), spray drying (see Masters (1991) in Spray-Drying Handbook (5th ed; Longman Scientific and Technical, Essez, U.K.), pp. 491-676; Broadhead et al. Drug Devel. Ind. Pharm. 18, 1169-1206 (1992); and Mumenthaler et al. Pharm. Res. 11, 12-20 (1994)), or air drying (Carpenter and \nCrowe Cryobiology\n 25, 459-470 (1988); and Roser Biopharm. 4, 47-53 (1991)). In one embodiment, said agent is an amino acid base. The term “amino acid base” is intended to indicate an amino acid or a combination of amino acids, where any given amino acid is present either in its free base form or in its salt form. Where a combination of amino acids is used, all of the amino acids may be present in their free base forms, all may be present in their salt forms, or some may be present in their free base forms while others are present in their salt forms. In one embodiment amino acids to use in preparing the compositions of the invention are those carrying a charged side chain, such as arginine, lysine, aspartic acid, and glutamic acid. Any stereoisomer (i.e., L or D isomer, or mixtures thereof) of a particular amino acid (methionine, histidine, arginine, lysine, isoleucine, aspartic acid, tryptophan, threonine and mixtures thereof) or combinations of these stereoisomers or glycine or an organic base such as but not limited to imidazole, may be present in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention so long as the particular amino acid or organic base is present either in its free base form or its salt form. In one embodiment the L-stereoisomer of an amino acid is used. In one embodiment the L-stereoisomer is used. Compositions of the invention may also be formulated with analogues of these amino acids. The term “amino acid analogue” is intended to indicate a derivative of the naturally occurring amino acid that brings about the desired effect of decreasing aggregate formation by the peptide during storage of the liquid pharmaceutical compositions of the invention. Suitable arginine analogues include, for example, aminoguanidine, ornithine and N-monoethyl L-arginine, suitable methionine analogues include ethionine and buthionine and suitable cysteine analogues include S-methyl-L cysteine. As with the other amino acids, the amino acid analogues are incorporated into the compositions in either their free base form or their salt form. In one embodiment of the invention the amino acids or amino acid analogues are used in a concentration, which is sufficient to prevent or delay aggregation of the peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the pharmaceutical composition further comprises methionine (or other sulphuric amino acids or amino acid analogous) to inhibit oxidation of methionine residues to methionine sulfoxide when the peptide acting as the therapeutic agent is a peptide comprising at least one methionine residue susceptible to such oxidation. The term “inhibit” is intended to indicate minimal accumulation of methionine oxidized species over time. Inhibiting methionine oxidation results in greater retention of the peptide in its proper molecular form. Any stereoisomer of methionine (L or D isomer) or any combinations thereof may be used. The amount to be added should be an amount sufficient to inhibit oxidation of the methionine residues such that the amount of methionine sulfoxide is acceptable to regulatory agencies. Typically, this means that the composition contains no more than about 10% to about 30% methionine sulfoxide. Generally, this can be obtained by adding methionine such that the ratio of methionine added to methionine residues ranges from about 1:1 to about 1000:1, such as 10:1 to about 100:1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the pharmaceutical composition further comprises a stabilizer selected from the group of high molecular weight polymers or low molecular compounds. In one embodiment the stabilizer is selected from polyethylene glycol (for instance PEG 3350), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyvinylpyrrolidone, carboxy-/hydroxycellulose or derivates thereof (for instance HPC, HPC-SL, HPC-L and HPMC), cyclodextrins, sulphur-containing substances as monothioglycerol, thioglycolic acid and 2-methylthioethanol, and different salts (for instance. sodium chloride). Each one of these specific stabilizers constitutes an alternative embodiment of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA pharmaceutical composition of the invention may also comprise additional stabilizing agents, which further enhance stability of a therapeutically active peptide therein. Stabilizing agents include, but are not limited to, methionine and EDTA, which protect the peptide against methionine oxidation, and a nonionic surfactant, which protects the peptide against aggregation associated with freeze-thawing or mechanical shearing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the pharmaceutical composition further comprises a surfactant.

Each one of these specific surfactants constitutes an alternative embodiment of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe use of a surfactant in pharmaceutical compositions is well-known to the skilled person. For convenience reference is made to Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 20\nth \nedition, 2000.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is possible that other ingredients may be present in a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. Such additional ingredients may include wetting agents, emulsifiers, antioxidants, bulking agents, tonicity modifiers, chelating agents, metal ions, oleaginous vehicles, proteins (for instance human serum albumin, gelatine or other proteins) and a zwitterion (for instance an amino acid such as betaine, taurine, arginine, glycine, lysine and histidine). Such additional ingredients, of course, should not adversely affect the overall stability of the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions containing a growth hormone conjugate according to the present invention may be administered to a patient in need of such treatment at several sites, for example, at topical sites, for example, skin and mucosal sites, at sites which bypass absorption, for example, administration in an artery, in a vein, in the heart, and at sites which involve absorption, for example, administration in the skin, under the skin, in a muscle or in the abdomen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdministration of pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention may be through several routes of administration, for example, lingual, sublingual, buccal, in the mouth, oral, in the stomach and intestine, nasal, pulmonary, for example, through the bronchioles and alveoli or a combination thereof, epidermal, dermal, transdermal, vaginal, rectal, ocular, for examples through the conjunctiva, uretal, and parenteral to patients in need of such a treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be administered in several dosage forms, for example, as solutions, suspensions, emulsions, microemulsions, multiple emulsion, foams, salves, pastes, plasters, ointments, tablets, coated tablets, rinses, capsules, for example, hard gelatine capsules and soft gelatine capsules, suppositories, rectal capsules, drops, gels, sprays, powder, aerosols, inhalants, eye drops, ophthalmic ointments, ophthalmic rinses, vaginal pessaries, vaginal rings, vaginal ointments, injection solution, in situ transforming solutions, for example in situ gelling, in situ setting, in situ precipitating, in situ crystallization, infusion solution, and implants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions of the invention may further be compounded in, or attached to, for example through covalent, hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, a drug carrier, drug delivery system and advanced drug delivery system in order to further enhance stability of the GH conjugate, increase bioavailability, increase solubility, decrease adverse effects, achieve chronotherapy well known to those skilled in the art, and increase patient compliance or any combination thereof. Examples of carriers, drug delivery systems and advanced drug delivery systems include, but are not limited to, polymers, for example cellulose and derivatives, polysaccharides, for example dextran and derivatives, starch and derivatives, poly(vinyl alcohol), acrylate and methacrylate polymers, polylactic and polyglycolic acid and block co-polymers thereof, polyethylene glycols, carrier proteins, for example albumin, gels, for example, thermogelling systems, for example block co-polymeric systems well known to those skilled in the art, micelles, liposomes, microspheres, nanoparticulates, liquid crystals and dispersions thereof, L2 phase and dispersions there of, well known to those skilled in the art of phase behaviour in lipid-water systems, polymeric micelles, multiple emulsions, self-emulsifying, self-microemulsifying, cyclodextrins and derivatives thereof, and dendrimers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions of the invention are useful in the composition of solids, semisolids, powder and solutions for pulmonary administration of GH conjugate, using, for example a metered dose inhaler, dry powder inhaler and a nebulizer, all being devices well known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions of the invention are specifically useful in the composition of controlled, sustained, protracting, retarded, and slow release drug delivery systems. More specifically, but not limited to, compositions are useful in composition of parenteral controlled release and sustained release systems (both systems leading to a many-fold reduction in number of administrations), well known to those skilled in the art. Even more preferably, are controlled release and sustained release systems administered subcutaneous. Without limiting the scope of the invention, examples of useful controlled release system and compositions are hydrogels, oleaginous gels, liquid crystals, polymeric micelles, microspheres, nanoparticles,\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods to produce controlled release systems useful for compositions of the invention include, but are not limited to, crystallization, condensation, co-crystallization, precipitation, co-precipitation, emulsification, dispersion, high pressure homogenisation, encapsulation, spray drying, microencapsulating, coacervation, phase separation, solvent evaporation to produce microspheres, extrusion and supercritical fluid processes. General reference is made to Handbook of Pharmaceutical Controlled Release (Wise, D. L., ed. Marcel Dekker, New York, 2000) and Drug and the Pharmaceutical Sciences vol. 99: Protein Composition and Delivery (MacNally, E. J., ed. Marcel Dekker, New York, 2000).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParenteral administration may be performed by subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal or intravenous injection by means of a syringe, optionally a pen-like syringe. Alternatively, parenteral administration may be performed by means of an infusion pump. A further option is a composition which may be a solution or suspension for the administration of the GH conjugate in the form of a nasal or pulmonal spray. As a still further option, the pharmaceutical compositions containing the GH conjugate of the invention can also be adapted to transdermal administration, for instance by needle-free injection or from a patch, optionally an iontophoretic patch, or transmucosal, for instance buccal, administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “stabilized composition” refers to a composition with increased physical stability, increased chemical stability or increased physical and chemical stability.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “physical stability” of a peptide composition as used herein refers to the tendency of the peptide to form biologically inactive and/or insoluble aggregates of the peptide as a result of exposure of the peptide to thermo-mechanical stresses and/or interaction with interfaces and surfaces that are destabilizing, such as hydrophobic surfaces and interfaces. Physical stability of the aqueous peptide compositions is evaluated by means of visual inspection and/or turbidity measurements after exposing the composition filled in suitable containers (for instance cartridges or vials) to mechanical/physical stress (for instance agitation) at different temperatures for various time periods. Visual inspection of the compositions is performed in a sharp focused light with a dark background. The turbidity of the composition is characterized by a visual score ranking the degree of turbidity for instance on a scale from 0 to 3 (a composition showing no turbidity corresponds to a \nvisual score\n 0, and a composition showing visual turbidity in daylight corresponds to visual score 3). A composition is classified physical unstable with respect to peptide aggregation, when it shows visual turbidity in daylight. Alternatively, the turbidity of the composition can be evaluated by simple turbidity measurements well-known to the skilled person. Physical stability of the aqueous peptide compositions can also be evaluated by using a spectroscopic agent or probe of the conformational status of the peptide. The probe is preferably a small molecule that preferentially binds to a non-native conformer of the peptide. One example of a small molecular spectroscopic probe of peptide structure is Thioflavin T. Thioflavin T is a fluorescent dye that has been widely used for the detection of amyloid fibrils. In the presence of fibrils, and perhaps other peptide configurations as well, Thioflavin T gives rise to a new excitation maximum at about 450 nm and enhanced emission at about 482 nm when bound to a fibril peptide form. Unbound Thioflavin T is essentially non-fluorescent at the wavelengths.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther small molecules may be used as probes of the changes in peptide structure from native to non-native states. For instance the “hydrophobic patch” probes that bind preferentially to exposed hydrophobic patches of a peptide. The hydrophobic patches are generally buried within the tertiary structure of a peptide in its native state, but become exposed as a peptide begins to unfold or denature. Examples of these small molecular, spectroscopic probes are aromatic, hydrophobic dyes, such as antrhacene, acridine, phenanthroline or the like. Other spectroscopic probes are metal-amino acid complexes, such as cobalt metal complexes of hydrophobic amino acids, such as phenylalanine, leucine, isoleucine, methionine, and valine, or the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “chemical stability” of the peptide compositions as used herein refers to the ability of said peptide to withstand chemical reactions involving the breaking of covalent bonds or the formation of new covalent bonds in the peptide structure leading to formation of chemical degradation products with potential less biological potency and/or potential increased immunogenic properties compared to the native peptide structure. Various chemical degradation products can be formed depending on the type and nature of the native peptide and the environment to which the peptide is exposed. When conjugated to a suitable group, the peptides of the present invention may be significantly more chemically stable than the corresponding unconjugated peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMost peptides are prone to deamidation, a process in which the side chain amide group in glutaminyl or asparaginyl residues is hydrolysed to form a free carboxylic acid. Other degradation pathways involves formation of high molecular weight transformation products where two or more peptide molecules are covalently bound to each other through transamidation and/or disulfide interactions leading to formation of covalently bound dimer, oligomer and polymer degradation products (Stability of Protein Pharmaceuticals, Ahern. T. J. & Manning M. C., Plenum Press, New York 1992). Oxidation (of for instance methionine residues) can be mentioned as another variant of chemical degradation. The chemical stability of the peptide composition can be evaluated by measuring the amount of the chemical degradation products at various time-points after exposure to different environmental conditions (the formation of degradation products can often be accelerated by for instance increasing temperature). The amount of each individual degradation product is often determined by separation of the degradation products depending on molecule size and/or charge using various chromatography techniques (for instance SEC-HPLC and/or RP -HPLC).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHence, as outlined above, a “stabilized composition” refers to a composition with increased physical stability, increased chemical stability or increased physical and chemical stability. In general, a composition must be stable during use and storage (in compliance with recommended use and storage conditions) until the expiration date is reached.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the pharmaceutical composition comprising the growth hormone conjugate is stable for more than 6 weeks of usage and for more than 3 years of storage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment than 4 weeks of usage and for more than 3 years of storage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the pharmaceutical composition comprising the growth hormone conjugate is stable for more than 4 weeks of usage and for more than two years of storage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the pharmaceutical composition comprising the growth hormone conjugate is stable for more than 2 weeks of usage and for more than two years of storage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs stated, compounds of formula (I) wherein Prot represents growth hormone and which exert growth hormone activity (or pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds) may as such be used in the treatment of diseases or states which will benefit from an increase in the amount of circulating growth hormone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConsequently, the present invention provides a compound of the present invention for use in therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides a method of treating a disease, condition or disorder benefiting from an increase in the level of circulating growth hormone, the method comprising the administration of a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention to a patient in need thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides a method for the treatment of growth hormone deficiency (GHD); Turner Syndrome; Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS); Noonan syndrome; Down syndrome; chronic renal disease, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis; cystic fibrosis, HIV-infection in children receiving HAART treatment (HIV/HALS children); short children born short for gestational age (SGA); short stature in children born with very low birth weight (VLBW) but SGA; skeletal dysplasia; hypochondroplasia; achondroplasia; idiopathic short stature (ISS); GHD in adults; fractures in or of long bones, such as tibia, fibula, femur, humerus, radius, ulna, clavicula, matacarpea, matatarsea, and digit; fractures in or of spongious bones, such as the scull, base of hand, and base of food; patients after tendon or ligament surgery in for instance hand, knee, or shoulder; patients having or going through distraction oteogenesis; patients after hip or discus replacement, meniscus repair, spinal fusions or prosthesis fixation, such as in the knee, hip, shoulder, elbow, wrist or jaw; patients into which osteosynthesis material, such as nails, screws and plates, have been fixed; patients with non-union or mal-union of fractures; patients after osteatomia, for instance from tibia or 1\nst \ntoe; patients after graft implantation; articular cartilage degeneration in knee caused by trauma or arthritis; osteoporosis in patients with Turner syndrome; osteoporosis in men; adult patients in chronic dialysis (APCD); malnutritional associated cardiovascular disease in APCD; reversal of cachexia in APCD; cancer in APCD; chronic abstractive pulmonal disease in APCD; HIV in APCD; elderly with APCD; chronic liver disease in APCD, fatigue syndrome in APCD; Crohn's disease; impaired liver function; males with HIV infections; short bowel syndrome; central obesity; HIV-associated lipodystrophy syndrome (HALS); male infertility; patients after major elective surgery, alcohol/drug detoxification or neurological trauma; aging; frail elderly; osteo-arthritis; traumatically damaged cartilage; erectile dysfunction; fibromyalgia; memory disorders; depression; traumatic brain injury; traumatic spinal cord injury; subarachnoid haemorrhage; very low birth weight; metabolic syndrome; glucocorticoid myopathy; or short stature due to glucucorticoid treatment in children, the method comprising administering to a patient in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a compound according to formula (I).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “treatment” and “treating” is intended to indicate the management and care of a patient for the purpose of combating a condition, a disease or a disorder. The term is intended to include the full spectrum of treatments for a given condition from which the patient is suffering, such as administration of the active compound to alleviate the symptoms or complications, to delay the progression of the disease, disorder or condition, to alleviate or relief the symptoms and complications, and/or to cure or eliminate the disease, disorder or condition as well as to prevent the condition, wherein prevention is to be understood as the management and care of a patient for the purpose of combating the disease, condition, or disorder and includes the administration of the active compounds to prevent the onset of the symptoms or complications. The patient to be treated is preferably a mammal, in particular a human being, but it may also include animals, such as dogs, cats, cows, sheep and pigs. The term “therapeutically effective amount” of a compound is intended to indicate an amount sufficient to cure, alleviate or partially arrest the clinical manifestations of a given disease and its complications. An amount adequate to accomplish this is defined as “therapeutically effective amount”.

After drying in vacuum overnight the residue was transferred with DCM to a smaller vial, concentrated, and dissolved in water (0.66 ml)+AcOH (0.66 ml). This solution was used for the pegylation of oxidized Ser-hGH.\n\n\n \n(D) Oxidation of Ser-hGH to glyoxalyl-hGH\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following solutions were prepared:\n\n \n \n \nBuffer A: triethanolamine (270 mg, 1.8 mmol), 3-methylthiopropanol (580 mg, 5.46 mmol), water (40 ml).\n \nBuffer B: 3-methylthiopropanol (1.2 g)+water (80 ml).\n \nPeriodate: NalO\n4 \n(48.1 mg, 0.225 mmol)+water (1.0 ml).\n \n\n\n \n \n \nSerhGH (50 mg, 2.3 μmol) was dissolved in buffer A (5.0 ml), and the periodate solution (0.5 ml) was added.

The resulting solution was mixed with a solution of 1,3-diaminopropan-2-ol (378 mg, 4 mmol) in phosphate buffer (50 mM, 1 ml, pH 8.0) and the pH was adjusted to 8.0 with dilute hydrochloric acid. A solution of transglutaminase (TGase, 18 mg, ˜40 U) dissolved in phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 8.0, 1 ml) was added and the volume was adjusted to 20 ml by addition of phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 8.0), what led to a concentration of 1,3-diaminopropan-2-ol of 0.2 M. The resulting solution was incubated for 4 h at 37° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe temperature was then lowered to room temperature and N-ethylmaleimide was added to a final concentration of 1 mM. After 1 h the mixture was diluted with 10 volumes of tris buffer (50 mM, pH 8.5).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe solution was applied to a \nMonoQ\n 10/100 GL column (Amersham Biosciences cat. No. 17-5167-01) preequilibrated with eluant A (50 mM tris, pH 8.5). Elution was performed at a flow of 2.5 ml/min with a gradient of 0% to 100% of eluant B (50 mM tris, 0.2 M NaCl, pH 8.5) in eluant A over 63 min. Fractions were collected based on UV absorption at 280 nm and Maldi-Tof analysis was performed on selected fractions. The fractions corresponding to the largest peak giving the expected molecular weight according to Maldi-Tof mass spectrometry were pooled. This pool contained a mixture of hGH and N\n∈141\n—(2-hydroxy-3-aminopropyl) hGH in a ratio 60:40, as determined by CE; method A, and by peptide mapping experiments as described in WO2005070468.\n\n\n \n(B) Oxidation of hGH Transaminated with 1,3-diamino-2-propanol\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following solutions were prepared:\n\n \n \n \nBuffer B: 3-methylthiopropanol (1.2 g+water (80 ml).\n \nPeriodate: NalO\n4 \n(48.1 mg, 0.225 mmol)+water (1.0 ml).\n \n\n\n \n \n \nTo a solution of hGH transaminated with 1,3-diamino-2-propanol (55 mg (2.5 μmol) transaminated +45 mg unmodified hGH) in a triethanolamine-buffer (4.7 ml) was added 3-methylthiopropanol (70 μl) and then the periodate solution (0.55 ml). After 20 min the mixture was diluted with buffer B and dialyzed 4 times with buffer B. The residue was diluted with buffer B to 0.6 ml and distributed equally into two vials.\n\n\n \n(C) Reductive Amination of Oxidized, Transaminated hGH with 4-aminobenzoyl mPeg(40 k)\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo 4-(Boc-amino)benzoyl mPeg(40 k) (75 mg, 1.88 μmol) was added DCM (10 ml) and TFA (10 ml). After 30 min the mixture was concentrated, and the residue coevaporated twice with EtOH. After drying overnight in vacuo the residue was redissolved in a mixture of water (0.5 ml) and AcOH (0.5 ml, 8.3 mmol).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe content of one vial of oxidized, transaminated hGH (see (B)) was diluted with NMP (0.3 ml) and added to the PEG solution. One hour later the NaCNBH\n3\n-solution (0.05 ml of a solution of NaCNBH\n3 \n(22 mg, 0.35 mmol; Mwt: 62.8 g/mol) dissolved in water (0.5 ml; c=700 mM) and AcOH (0.015 ml); this solution was prepared just before use) was added. After 66 h the mixture was neutralized by addition to a mixture of triethanolamine (1.7 g, 11.4 mmol) and water (2 ml), and the product was purified by chromatography; 9 mg of the title compound was obtained.\n\n\n \nPharmacological Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nAssay (I) BAF-3 GHR Assay to Determine Growth Hormone Activity\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe BAF-3 cells (a murine pro-B lymphoid cell line derived from the bone marrow) were originally IL-3 dependent for growth and survival. IL-3 activates JAK-2 and STAT which are the same mediators GH is activating upon stimulation. After transfection of the human growth hormone receptor the cell line was transformed into a growth hormone-dependent cell line. This clone could be used to evaluate the effect of different growth hormone samples on the survival of the BAF-3 GHR.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe BAF-3 GHR cells were grown in starvation medium (culture medium without growth hormone) for 24 h at 37° C., 5% CO\n2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cells were washed and resuspended in starvation medium and seeded in plates. 10 μl of growth hormone compound or human growth hormone in different concentrations or control was added to the cells, and the plates were incubated for 68 h at 37° C., 5% CO\n2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlamarBlue® was added to each well and the cells were incubated for further 4 h. AlamarBlue® is a redox indicator, which is reduced by reactions innate to cellular metabolism and, therefore, provides an indirect measure of viable cell number.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFinally, the metabolic activity of the cells was measured in a fluorescence plate reader. The absorbance in the samples was expressed in % of cells not stimulated with growth hormone compound or control, and from the concentration-response curves the activity (amount of a compound that stimulates the cells with 50%) could be calculated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe data for the compounds described in the examples may be found in Table 1.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelative in vitro potency of different hGH derivatives\n\n\n\n\n\n\nin the BAF hGH-receptor (hGH-R) assay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nRatio [EC50 compound/\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound\n\n\nEC50 (nM)\n\n\nEC50 hGH]\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhGH (LUOS079)\n\n\n0.02 ± 0.005\n\n\n1 (defined)\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncompound of example 1\n\n\n0.23 ± 0.022\n\n\n10 ± 1\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncompound of example 2\n\n\n0.42 ± 0.05 \n\n\n19 ± 3\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nValues are expressed as Mean ± SD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAssay for Determining In Vitro Stability\n\n\n \n \n \nSolutions of compounds of the invention in various buffers are incubated at 20-40° C. for 1 d to 30 d.

The hypophysectomised rat is a well known and recognised animal model of growth hormone deficiency, where no production of growth hormone occurs after the surgical removal of the pituitary gland. This also leads to low circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) another important clinical feature of growth hormone deficiency in humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe hypophysectomy was performed on 4 week old male rats weighing 90-100 g. The animals entered the study 3-4 weeks after the surgery weighing 100-110 g. Animals with a body weight gain of more than 10% during the 3-4 weeks after surgery were not allowed to enter the study.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSixty hypophysectomised Sprague Dawley rats were randomly allocated to six dosing groups with ten animals in each group. One group received vehicle only and served as an untreated control group. The remaining five groups received 1, 5, 15, 50 and 150 nmol compound of example 2 respectively as a single subcutaneous dose in the neck. The body weight was measured daily between 8-10 am for one week. The data are presented as gain in body weight compared to the day of dosing (Day 0) for 7 days and is presented in \nFIG. 1\n."

Description\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to the area of novel analogues of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, pharmaceutical compositions containing said compounds, and the use of said compounds as GIP-receptor agonists or antagonists for treatment of GIP-receptor mediated conditions, such as non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and obesity.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND ART\n\n\n \n \n \nGlucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (“GIP”, also known as “gastric inhibitory polypeptide”; SEQ ID NO:1) is a 42-residue peptide secreted by enteroendorine K-cells of the small intestine into the bloodstream in response to oral nutrient ingestion. GIP inhibits the secretion of gastric acid, and it has been shown to be a potent stimulant for the secretion of insulin from pancreatic beta cells after oral glucose ingestion (the “incretin effect”) (Creutzfeldt, W., et al., 1979, \nDiabetologia, \n16:75-85).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInsulin release induced by the ingestion of glucose and other nutrients is due to both hormonal and neural factors (Creutzfeldt, W., et al., 1985, \nDiabetologia, \n28:565-573). Several gastrointestinal regulatory peptides have been proposed as incretins, and among these candidates, only GIP and glucagon-like peptide 1 (“GLP-1”) appear to fulfill the requirements to be considered physiological stimulants of postprandial insulin release (Nauck, et al., 1989, \nJ. Clin. Endorinol. Metab., \n69:654-662). It has been shown that the combined effects of GIP and GLP-1 are sufficient to explain the full incretin effect of the enteroinsular axis (Fehmann, H. C., et al., 1989, \nFEBS Lett., \n252:109-112).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs is well known to those skilled in the art, the known and potential uses of GIP are varied and multitudinous. Thus, the administration of the compounds of this invention for purposes of eliciting an agonist effect can have the same effects and uses as GIP itself. These varied uses of GIP may be summarized as follows: treating a disease selected from the group consisting of \ntype\n 1 diabetes, \ntype\n 2 diabetes (Visboll, T., 2004, \nDan. Med. Bull., \n51:364-70), insulin resistance (WO 2005/082928), obesity (Green, B. D., et al., 2004, \nCurrent Pharmaceutical Design, \n10:3651-3662), metabolic disorder (Gault, V. A., et al., 2003, \nBiochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., \n308:207-213), central nervous system disease, neurodegenerative disease, congestive heart failure, hypoglycemia, and disorders wherein the reduction of food intake and weight loss are desired. In pancreatic islets, GIP not only enhances insulin secretion acutely, but it also stimulates insulin production through enhancement of proinsulin transcription and translation (Wang, et al., 1996, \nMol. Cell. Endocrinol., \n116:81-87) and enhances the growth and survival of pancreatic beta cells (Trumper, et al., 2003 \nDiabetes, \n52:741-750). In addition to effects on the pancreas to enhance insulin secretion, GIP also has effects on insulin target tissues directly to lower plasma glucose: enhancement of glucose uptake in adipose (Eckel, et al., 1979, \nDiabetes, \n28:1141-1142) and muscle (O'Harte, et al., 1998, \nJ. Endocrinol., \n156:237-243), and inhibition of hepatic glucose production (Elahi, D., et al., 1986, \nCan. J. Physiol. Pharmacol., \n65:A18).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, a GIP receptor antagonist in accordance with the present invention inhibits, blocks or reduces glucose absorption from the intestine of an animal. In accordance with this observation, therapeutic compositions containing GIP antagonists may be used in patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus to improve tolerance to oral glucose in mammals, such as humans, to prevent, inhibit or reduce obesity by inhibiting, blocking or reducing glucose absorption from the intestine of the mammal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe use of unmodified GIP as a therapeutic, however, is limited by the short in vivo half-life of about 2 minutes (Said and Mutt, 1970, \nScience, \n169:1217-1218). In serum, both incretins, GIP and GLP-1, are degraded by dipeptidyl peptidase IV (“DPPIV”). Improving the stability of GIP to proteolysis not only maintains the activity of GIP at its receptor but, more importantly, prevents the production of GIP fragments, some of which act as GIP receptor antagonists (Gault, et al., 2002, \nJ. Endocrinol., \n175:525-533). Reported modifications have included protection of the N-terminus of GIP from proteolysis by DPPIV through modification of the N-terminal tyrosine (O'Harte, et al., 2002, \nDiabetologia, \n45:1281-1291), mutation of the alanine at position 2 (Hinke, et al., 2002, \nDiabetes, \n51:656-661), mutation of glutamic acid at position 3 (Gault, et al., 2003, \nBiochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., \n308:207-213), and mutation of alanine at position 13 (Gault, et al., 2003, \nCell Biol. International, \n27:41-46),\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following patent applications have been filed related to the effects of GIP analogues on the function of various target organs and their potential use as therapeutic agents:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPCT publication WO 00/58360 discloses peptidyl analogues of GIP which stimulate the release of insulin. In particular, this application discloses specific peptidyl analogues comprising at least 15 amino acid residues from the N-terminal end of GIP(1-42), e.g., an analogue of GIP containing exactly one amino acid substitution or modification at \n \n \npositions\n \n \n 1, 2 and 3, such as [Pro\n3\n]GIP(1-42).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPCT publication WO 98/24464 discloses an antagonist of GIP consisting essentially of a 24-amino acid polypeptide corresponding to positions 7-30 of the sequence of GIP, a method of treating non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and a method of improving glucose tolerance in a non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPCT publication WO 03/082898 discloses C-terminal truncated fragments and N-terminal modified analogues of GIP, as well as various GIP analogues with a reduced peptide bond or alterations of the amino acids close to the DPPIV-specific cleavage site. This application further discloses analogues with different linkers between potential receptor binding sites of GIP. The compounds of this application are alleged to be useful in treating GIP-receptor mediated conditions, such as non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and obesity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere exists a need for improved analogues of GIP, which are stable in formulation and have long plasma half-life in vivo resulting from decreased susceptibility to proteolysis and decreased clearance while maintaining binding affinity to a GIP receptor to elicit respective agonistic or antagonistic effects. Moreover, among other therapeutic effects of the compounds of the present invention as illustrated herein, tighter control of plasma glucose levels may prevent long-term diabetic complications, thereby providing an improved quality of life for patients.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention relates to peptide variants of GIP of the following formula

For this particular step, 2 molar equivalents of Fmoc-HN—X\n2\n—COOH, HBTU and HOBt and 10 molar equivalents of DIPEA are used. The coupling time is about 8 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the synthesis of a GIP analogue of this invention containing A5c, A6c, and/or Aib, the coupling time is 2 hrs for these residues and the residue immediately following them.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe substituents R\n2 \nand R\n3 \nof the above generic formula can be attached to the free amine of the N-terminal amino acid A\n1 \nby standard methods known in the art. For example, alkyl groups, e.g., (C\n1\n-C\n30\n)alkyl, can be attached using reductive alkylation. Hydroxyalkyl groups, e.g., (C\n1\n-C\n30\n)hydroxyalkyl, can also be attached using reductive alkylation wherein the free hydroxyl group is protected with a tert-butyl ester. Acyl groups, e.g., —C(O)X\n3\n, can be attached by coupling the free acid, e.g., —X\n3\nCOOH, to the free amine of the N-terminal amino acid by mixing the completed resin with 3 molar equivalents of both the free acid and diisopropylcarbodiimide in methylene chloride for about one hour. If the free acid contains a free hydroxyl group, e.g., 3-fluoro-4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, then the coupling should be performed with an additional 3 molar equivalents of HOBT.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following examples describe synthetic methods for making a peptide of this invention, which methods are well-known to those skilled in the art. Other methods are also known to those skilled in the art. The examples are provided for the purpose of illustration and are not meant to limit the scope of the present invention in any manner.\n\n\n \nExample 15 \n\n\n[A6c\n7\n, Cys(Psu)\n42\n]hGIP(1-42)-OH\n\n\n \n \n \nSolid-phase peptide synthesis was used to assemble the peptide using microwave-assisted Fmoc Chemistry on a Liberty Peptide Synthesizer (CEM; Matthews, N.C., USA) at the 0.1 mmole scale. Pre-loaded Fmoc-Cys(Trt)-Wang resin (0.59 mmole/g; Novabiochem, San Diego, Calif., USA) was used to generate the C-terminal acid peptide. The resin (0.17 g) was placed in a 50 ml conical tube along with 15 ml of dimethylformamide (DMF) and loaded onto a resin position on the synthesizer. The resin was then quantitatively transferred to the reaction vessel via the automated process. The standard Liberty synthesis protocol for 0.1 mmole scale synthesis was used. This protocol involves deprotecting the N-terminal Fmoc moiety via an initial treatment with 7 ml of 20% piperidine, containing 0.1M N-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT), in DMF. The initial deprotection step was for 30 seconds with microwave power (45 watts, maximum temperature of 75° C.), and nitrogen bubbling (3 seconds on/7 seconds off). The reaction vessel was then drained and a second piperidine treatment, identical to the first treatment, except that it was for a 3-minute duration. The resin was then drained and thoroughly washed with DMF several times. The protected amino acid, Fmoc-Thr(tBu)-OH, prepared as 0.2M stock solution in DMF, was then added (2.5 ml, 5 eq.), followed by 1.0 ml of 0.45M (4.5 eq.) HBTU [2-(1H-benzo-triazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosaphate] in DMF. This was followed by the addition of 0.5 ml of 2M (10 eq.) DIPEA (diisopropylethylamine) in NMP (N-methylpyrrollidinone). The coupling step was performed for 5 minutes using 20 watts of microwave power, a max temperature of 75° C., and the same rate of nitrogen bubbling.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing the initial coupling step the reaction vessel was drained to waste and the coupling step repeated. \nCycle\n 2 was then initiated similar to \ncycle\n 1. All amino acids were introduced similarly and a double-coupling strategy was employed throughout the entire sequence. Cycles 1-3, 19-20, 25-26, and 30-39 contained a capping procedure immediately following the coupling step. Capping was performed by adding 7 ml of 0.5M acetic anhydride, containing 0.015M HOBT in NMP, along with 2 ml of the 2M DIPEA solution using a multi-step microwave protocol: 50 watts of power for 30 seconds (65° C. max temperature), followed by 30 seconds of microwave power off, followed by a second round of 30 seconds of microwave power on (50 watts), and then again 30 seconds of no microwave power. The resin was then drained and thoroughly washed with DMF. The following amino acids (Advanced Chemtech, Louisville, Ky., USA) were used: Cycle 1: Fmoc-Thr(OtBu)-OH; Cycle 2: Fmoc-Ile-OH; Cycle 3: Fmoc-Asn(Trt)-OH; Cycle 4: Fmoc-His(Trt)-OH; Cycle 5: Fmoc-Lys(Boc)-OH; Cycle 6: Fmoc-Trp(Boc)-OH; Cycle 7: Fmoc-Asp(OtBu)-OH; Cycle 8: Fmoc-Asn(Trt)-OH; Cycle 9: Fmoc-Lys(Boc)-OH; Cycle 10: Fmoc-Lys(Boc)-OH; Cycle 11: Fmoc-Gly-OH; Cycle 12: Fmoc-Lys(Boc)-OH; Cycle 13: Fmoc-Gln(Trt)-OH; Cycle 14: Fmoc-Ala-OH; Cycle 15: Fmoc-Leu-OH; Cycle 16: Fmoc-Leu-OH; Cycle 17: Fmoc-Trp(Boc)-OH; Cycle 18: Fmoc-Asn(Trt)-OH; Cycle 19: Fmoc-Val-OH; Cycle 20: Fmoc-Phe-OH; Cycle 21: Fmoc-Asp(OtBu)-OH; Cycle 22: Fmoc-Gln(Trt)-OH; Cycle 23: Fmoc-Gln(Trt)-OH; Cycle 24: Fmoc-His(Trt)-OH; Cycle 25: Fmoc-Ile-OH; Cycle 26: Fmoc-Lys(Boc)-OH; Cycle 27: Fmoc-Asp(OtBu)-OH; Cycle 28: Fmoc-Met-OH; Cycle 29: Fmoc-Ala-OH; Cycle 30: Fmoc-Ile-OH; Cycle 31: Fmoc-Tyr(tBu)-Ser(psiMe,Me,Pro)-OH; Cycle 32: Fmoc-Asp(OtBu)-OH; Cycle 33: Fmoc-Ser(tBu)-OH; Cycle 34: Fmoc-A6c-OH. Cycle 35: Fmoc-Phe-OH; Cycle 36: Fmoc-Gly-Thr(psiMe,Me,Pro)-OH; Cycle 37: Fmoc-Glu(OtBu)-OH; Cycle 38: Fmoc-Ala-OH; and Cycle 39: Fmoc-Tyr(tBu)-OH. The coupling protocol for Fmoc-His(Trt)-OH was a slightly modified version of the standard protocol. The microwave power was off for the first 2 minutes, followed by 4 minutes with microwave power on (20 watts; max temperature of 50° C.). Once the peptide backbone was complete, standard piperidine treatment was used to remove the N-terminal Fmoc group. The resin was then thoroughly washed with DMF and then transferred back to the 50 ml conical tube using DMF as the transfer solvent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe resin was deprotected and cleaved from the resin via treatment with 5 ml of the following reagent: 5% TIS, 2% water, 5% (w/v) dithiothrieitol (DTT), 88% TFA, and allowed to mix for 3.5 hours. The filtrate was collected into 45 ml of cold anhydrous ethyl ether. The precipitate was pelleted for 10 minutes at 3500 RPM in a refrigerated centrifuge. The ether was decanted, and the peptide re-suspended in fresh ether. The ether workup was performed a total of 2 times. Following the last ether wash the peptide was allowed to air dry to remove residual ether. The peptide pellet was resuspended in 8 ml of acetonitrile (Acn) followed by 8 ml of de-ionized water, and allowed to fully dissolve. The peptide solution was then analyzed by mass spectrometry. Mass analysis employing electrospray ionization identified a main product containing a mass of 4970.7 Daltons; corresponding to the linear product. The crude product (approximately 500 mg) was analysed by HPLC, employing a 250×4.6 mm C18 column (Phenomenex; Torrance, Calif., USA) using a gradient of 2-80% acetonitrile (0.1% TFA) over 30 minutes. The crude peptide was then derivatized with N-propylmaleimide (Pma) to generate the propylsuccinimide (Psu) derivative on the Cysteine side chain. The crude linear peptide was brought up in water, adjusted to pH 6.5 with ammonium carbonate, at 5 mg/ml. Five equivalents of Pma was added with constant stirring for 30 seconds. Excess Pma was quenched using 5 eq. of dithiothreitol (DTT). The derivatized peptide solution was then analyzed by mass spectrometry. Mass analysis identified a main product containing a mass of 5109.7 Daltons; corresponding to the desired Psu derivatized product. The product was then purified via preparative HPLC using a similar gradient as before. The purified product was analyzed by HPLC for purity (96.60%) and mass spectrometry (5108.9 Daltons) and subsequently lyophilized. Following lyophillization, 10.3 mg of purified product was obtained representing a 2% yield.\n\n\n \nExample 18 \n\n\n[A6c\n7\n, Orn\n35\n(N—C(O)—(CH\n2\n)\n12\n—CH\n3\n)]hGIP(1-42)-OH \n\n\n \n \n \nSolid-phase peptide synthesis was used to assemble the peptide using microwave-assisted Fmoc Chemistry on a Liberty Peptide Synthesizer (CEM; Matthews, N.C., USA) at the 0.1 mmole scale.

The coupling protocol for Fmoc-His(Trt)-OH was a slightly modified version of the standard protocol. The microwave power was off for the first 2 minutes, followed by 4 minutes with microwave power on (20 watts; max temperature of 50° C.). Once the peptide backbone was complete, the resin was treated with 12 ml of 1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)/5% triisopropylsilane (TIS) in dichloromethane (DCM) for 5 minutes and a N\n2 \nsparge rate of 5 seconds on and 10 seconds off. The resin was then drained and again treated with the 1% TFA/5% TIS in DCM solution for 5 minutes. This was performed a total of 7 times to effectively remove the Mtt moiety from the ornithine side chain. The resin was thoroughly washed with DCM several times, and then treated with the standard piperidine treatment in order to neutralize residual TFA salt on the δN of ornithine. Myristic acid, (CH\n3\n—(CH\n2\n)\n12\n—COOH; Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo., USA) prepared as a 0.2M solution in DMF, was coupled to the ornithine side chain using the standard amino acid coupling protocol.

In Vitro hGIP Receptor Binding Assay\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMembranes for in vitro receptor binding assays were prepared by homogenizing the CHO-K1 clonal cells expressing the human recombinant GIP receptor, with a Brinkman Polytron (setting 6, 15 sec), in ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl and then subjected to two centrifugations at 39,000 g for 10 minutes, with a resuspension in fresh buffer in between. For the assay, aliquots of the washed membrane preparations were incubated (100 minutes at 25° C. with 0.05 nM [\n125\nI]GIP (approximately 2200 Ci/mmol) in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.1 mg/ml bacitracin, and 0.1% BSA. The final assay volume was 0.5 ml. The incubations were terminated by rapid filtration through GF/C filters (pre-soaked in 0.5% polyethylenimine) using a Brandel filtration manifold. Each tube and filter were then washed three times with 5-ml aliquots of ice-cold buffer. Specific binding was defined as the total radioligand bound minus that bound in the presence of 1000 nM GIP. In vitro hGIP receptor binding data for the compounds exemplified herein are given in Table 2.\n\n\n \nB. Human and Rat Plasma Half-Life Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nGIP peptide (50 \nμL\n 1 mg/ml) was added to 450 μL plasma (human or rat), vertexed briefly and incubated at 37° C. 50 μL was removed at various times, like at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 24, 32, 48, 56, 72 hours, mixed with 5 μL formic acid and 150 μL acetonitrile in a microcentrifuge tube, vertexed, and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 10K rpm. The supernatant was transferred to an injection vial and analyzed by LC-MS. The LC-MS system consisted of an API4000 mass spectrometer with an ESI probe. Positive ion mode and full scan detection were used.

Determination of Cyclic AMP Stimulation\n\n\n \n \n \n1×105 CHO-K1 cells expressing the human recombinant GIP receptor or RIN-5F insulinoma cells were seeded overnight into 24-well cell culture plates (Corning Incorporate, Corning, N.Y., USA). For the assay, the cells were preincubated in 500 μl of Hanks balanced salt solution (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo., USA) with 0.55 mM IBMX (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo., USA) adjusted to pH 7.3 for 10 minutes. GIP or its analogs was then added at a concentration of 100 nM. Following a 30-minute incubation at 37° C., the plates were placed on ice and 500 μl of ice-cold absolute ethanol was added to stop the reaction. The contents of the wells were collected, spun at 2,700 g for 20 minutes at 4° C. to remove cellular debris. The cAMP levels in the supernatants were determined by radioimmunoassay (New England Nuclear, Boston, Mass., USA).\n\n\n \nD. Determination of In Vivo Insulin Secretion in Normal Rats\n\n\n \n \n \nMale Sprague Dawley rats with a body weight of approximately 275-300 g were used as experimental subjects. The day prior to the treatment, right atrial cannulae were implanted via the jugular vein under chlorohydrate. Each cannula was filled with 100 u/ml heparin saline and tied. The rats were fasted for approximately 18 hours prior to dosing with the compound or the vehicle (saline/0.25% BSA). The day of the experiment, aliquots of compound were thawed, brought to room temperature and vortexed thoroughly. A careful check was made for any sign of compound coming out of solution. 10 minutes prior to compound/glucose injection, a 500 μl blood sample was withdrawn and replaced with an equal volume of heparinized saline (10 u/ml). At \ntime\n 0, a 500 μl blood sample was withdrawn through the cannula. Next, either the vehicle or the appropriate dose of the compound was injected into the cannula and pushed in with the glucose (1 g/kg) or vehicle solution. Finally, 500 μl of volume of heparinized saline (10 u/ml) was used to push in the remaining glucose through the cannula. Additional 500 μl blood samples were withdrawn at 2.5, 5, 10, and 20-minute post-glucose dosing; each immediately followed by a bolus, iv injection of 500 μl heparinized saline (10 u/ml) through the cannula. The plasma was collected from the blood samples by centrifugation, and stored at −20° C. until assay for insulin content.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 1\n shows the in vivo effects of the compounds of Examples 1-7 and the native GIP on insulin release of Sprague Dawley rats.

Examples of such salts include, but are not limited to, those formed with organic acids (e.g., acetic, lactic, maleic, citric, malic, ascorbic, succinic, benzoic, methanesulfonic, toluenesulfonic, or pamoic acid), inorganic acids (e.g., hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, or phosphoric acid), and polymeric acids (e.g., tannic acid, carboxymethyl cellulose, polylactic, polyglycolic, or copolymers of polylactic-glycolic acids). A typical method of making a salt of a peptide of the present invention is well known in the art and can be accomplished by standard methods of salt exchange. Accordingly, the TFA salt of a peptide of the present invention (the TFA salt results from the purification of the peptide by using preparative HPLC, eluting with TFA containing buffer solutions) can be converted into another salt, such as an acetate salt by dissolving the peptide in a small amount of 0.25 N acetic acid aqueous solution. The resulting solution is applied to a semi-prep HPLC column (Zorbax, 300 SB, C-8). The column is eluted with (1) 0.1N ammonium acetate aqueous solution for 0.5 hrs, (2) 0.25N acetic acid aqueous solution for 0.5 hrs, and (3) a linear gradient (20% to 100% of solution B over 30 minutes) at a flow rate of 4 ml/min (solution A is 0.25N acetic acid aqueous solution; solution B is 0.25N acetic acid in acetonitrile/water, 80:20). The fractions containing the peptide are collected and lyophilized to dryness.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dosage of active ingredient in the compositions of this invention may be varied; however, it is necessary that the amount of the active ingredient be such that a suitable dosage form is obtained. The selected dosage depends upon the desired therapeutic effect, on the route of administration, and on the duration of the treatment. In general, an effective dosage for the activities of this invention is in the range of 1×10\n−7 \nto 200 mg/kg/day, preferably 1×10\n−4 \nto 100 mg/kg/day, which can be administered as a single dose or divided into multiple doses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of this invention can be administered by oral, parenteral (e.g., intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous or subcutaneous injection, or implant), nasal, vaginal, rectal, sublingual, or topical routes of administration, and can be formulated with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers to provide dosage forms appropriate for each route of administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is admixed with at least one inert pharmaceutically acceptable carrier such as sucrose, lactose, or starch. Such dosage forms can also comprise, as is normal practice, additional substances other than such inert diluents, e.g., lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. Tablets and pills can additionally be prepared with enteric coatings.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiquid dosage forms for oral administration include, without limitation, pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups, elixirs, and the like, containing inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as water. Besides such inert diluents, compositions can also include adjuvants, such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, and sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreparations according to this invention for parenteral administration include, without limitation, sterile aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, suspensions, emulsions, and the like. Examples of non-aqueous solvents or vehicles include propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils, such as olive oil and corn oil, gelatin, and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Such dosage forms may also contain adjuvants such as preserving, wetting, emulsifying, and dispersing agents. They may be sterilized by, for example, filtration through a bacteria-retaining filter, by incorporating sterilizing agents into the compositions, by irradiating the compositions, or by heating the compositions. They can also be manufactured in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved in sterile water, or some other sterile injectable medium immediately before use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which may contain, in addition to the active substance, excipients such as coca butter or a suppository wax.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions for nasal or sublingual administration are also prepared with standard excipients well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, a compound of this invention can be administered in a sustained release composition such as those described in the following patents and patent applications.
