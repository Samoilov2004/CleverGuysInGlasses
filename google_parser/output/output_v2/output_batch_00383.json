Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention is directed to human antibodies that bind to KDR, that block binding of KDR to vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), and that neutralize activation of KDR. The antibodies are used for treating neoplastic diseases and hyperproliferative disorders and can be used alone or in combination with other VEGFR antagonists and with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antagonists.\n\n\n \n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAngiogenesis is a highly complex process of developing new blood vessels that involves the proliferation and migration of, and tissue infiltration by capillary endothelial cells from pre-existing blood vessels, cell assembly into tubular structures, joining of newly forming tubular assemblies to closed-circuit vascular systems, and maturation of newly formed capillary vessels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAngiogenesis is important in normal physiological processes including embryonic development, follicular growth, and wound healing, as well as in pathological conditions such as tumor growth and in non-neoplastic diseases involving abnormal neovascularization, including neovascular glaucoma (\nFolkman, J. and Klagsbrun, M., Science, 235:442-7 (1987\n). Other disease states include but are not limited to, neoplastic diseases, including but not limited to solid tumors, atherosclerosis and other inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, and ophthalmological conditions such as diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration. Conditions or diseases to which persistent or uncontrolled angiogenesis contribute have been termed angiogenic dependent or angiogenic associated diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne means for controlling such diseases and pathological conditions comprises restricting the blood supply to those cells involved in mediating or causing the disease or condition, for example, by occluding blood vessels supplying portions of organs in which tumors are present. Such approaches require the site of the tumor to be identified and are generally limited to treatment to a single site, or a small number of sites. An additional disadvantage of direct mechanical restriction of a blood supply is that collateral blood vessels develop, often quite rapidly, restoring the blood supply to the tumor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther approaches have focused on the modulation of factors that are involved in the regulation of angiogenesis. While usually quiescent, vascular endothelial proliferation is highly regulated, even during angiogenesis. VEGF is a factor that has been implicated as a regulator of angiogenesis \nin vivo\n (\nKlagsbrun, M. and D'Amore, P., Annual Rev. Physiol., 53: 217-39 (1991\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn endothelial-cell specific mitogen, VEGF, acts as an angiogenesis inducer by specifically promoting the proliferation of endothelial cells. It is a homodimeric glycoprotein consisting of two 23 kD subunits. Four different monomeric isoforms of VEGF resulting from alternative splicing of mRNA have been identified. These include two membrane bound forms (VEGF206 and VEGF189) and two soluble forms (VEGF165 and VEGF121). VEGF165 is the most abundant isoform in all human tissues except placenta.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVEGF is expressed in embryonic tissues (\nBreier et al., Development, 114:521-32 (1992\n)), macrophages, and proliferating epidermal keratinocytes during wound healing (\nBrown et al., J. Exp. Med 176:1375-9 (1992\n)), and may be responsible for tissue edema associated with inflammation (\nFerrara et al., Endocr. Rev., 13:18-32 (1992\n)). \nIn situ\n hybridization studies have demonstrated high levels of VEGF expression in a number of human tumor lines including glioblastoma multiforme, hemangioblastoma, other central nervous system neoplasms and AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma (\nPlate, K. et al., Nature, 359:845-8 (1992\n); \nPlate, K. et al., Cancer Res., 53:5822-7 (1993\n); \nBerkman, R. et al., J. Clin. Invest., 91:153-9 (1993\n); \nNakamura, S. et al., AIDS Weekly,13 (1) (1992\n)). High levels of VEGF expression has also been found in atherosclerotic lesions, plaques and in inflammatory cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVEGF mediates its biological effect through high affinity VEGF receptors which are selectively expressed on endothelial cells during, for example, embryogenesis (\nMillauer, B. et al. Cell, 72:835-46 (1993\n)) and tumor formation, and which have been implicated in modulating angiogenesis and tumor growth. These receptors comprise a tyrosine kinase cytosolic domain that initiates the signaling pathway involved in cell growth.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVEGF receptors typically are class \nIII\n receptor-type tyrosine kinases characterized by having several, typically 5 or 7, immunoglobulin-like loops in their amino-terminal extracellular receptor ligand-binding domains (\nKaipainen et al., J. Exp. Med., 178:2077-88 (1993\n)). The other two regions include a transmembrane region and a carboxy-terminal intracellular catalytic domain interrupted by an insertion of hydrophilic interkinase sequences of variable lengths, called the kinase insert domain (\nTerman et al., Oncogene, 6:1677-83 (1991\n)). VEGF receptors include fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor (flt-1), or VEGFR-1, sequenced by \nShibuya et al., Oncogene, 5:519-24 (1990\n), kinase insert domain-containing receptor/fetal liver kinase (KDR/flk-1), or VEGFR-2, described in \n \nWO 92/14248, filed February 20, 1992\n \n, and \nTerman et al., Oncogene, 6:1677-83 (1991\n) and sequenced by \nMatthews et al., Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA, 88:9026-30 (1991\n), although other receptors can also bind VEGF. Another tyrosine kinase receptor, VEGFR-3 (flt-4), binds the VEGF homologues VEGF-C and VEGF-D and is important in the development of lymphatic vessels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRelease of VEGF by a tumor mass stimulates angiogenesis in adjacent endothelial cells. When VEGF is expressed by the tumor mass, endothelial cells adjacent to the VEGF+ tumor cells will up-regulate expression of VEGF receptors, e.g., VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2. It is generally believed that KDR/VEGFR-2 is the main VEGF signal transducer that results in endothelial cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, tube formation, increase of vascular permeability, and maintenance of vascular integrity. VEGFR-1 possesses a much weaker kinase activity, and is unable to generate a mitogenic response when stimulated by VEGF, although it binds to VEGF with an affinity that is approximately 10-fold higher than KDR. VEGFR-1 has also been implicated in VEGF and placenta growth factor (P1GF) induced migration of monocytes and macrophages and production of tissue factor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHigh levels of VEGFR-2, for example, are expressed by endothelial cells that infiltrate gliomas (Plate, K. et al. (1992)), and are specifically upregulated by VEGF produced by human glioblastomas (Plate, K. et al. (1993)). The finding of high levels of VEGR-2 expression in glioblastoma associated endothelial cells (GAEC) suggests that receptor activity is induced during tumor formation, since VEGFR-2 transcripts are barely detectable in normal brain endothelial cells, indicating generation of a paracrine VEGF/VEGFR loop. This upregulation is confined to the vascular endothelial cells in close proximity to the tumor. Blocking VEGF activity with neutralizing anti-VEGF monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) results in inhibition of the growth of human tumor xenografts in nude mice (\nKim, K. et al. Nature, 362:841-4 (1993\n)), suggesting a direct role for VEGF in tumor-related angiogenesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, VEGFR antagonists have been developed to treat vascularized tumors and other angiogenic diseases. These have included neutralizing antibodies that block signaling by VEGF receptors expressed on vascular endothelial cells to reduce tumor growth by blocking angiogenesis through an endothelial-dependent paracrine loop. See, e.g., \n \nU.S. Patent No. 6,365,157 (Rockwell et al.\n \n), \n \nWO 00/44777 (Zhu et al.\n \n), \n \nWO 01154723 (Kerbel\n \n); \n \nWO 01/74296 (Witte et al.\n \n), \n \nWO 01/90192 (Zhu\n \n), \n \nWO 03/002144 (Zhu\n \n), and \n \nWO 03/000183 (Carmeliet et al.\n \n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVEGF receptors have also been found on some non-endothelial cells, such as tumor cells producing VEGF, wherein an endothelial-independent autocrine loop is generated to support tumor growth. For example, VEGF is almost invariably expressed by all established leukemic cell lines and freshly isolated human leukemias. Further, VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-1 are expressed by certain human leukemias. \nFielder et al., Blood 89:1870-5 (1997\n); \nBellamy et al., Cancer Res. 59728-33 (1999\n). It has been demonstrated that a VEGF/human VEGFR-2 autocrine loop mediates leukemic cell survival and migration \nin vivo.\n \nDias et al., J. Clin. Invest. 106:511-21 (2000\n) ; and \n \nWO 01/74296 (Witte et al.\n \n). Similarly, VEGF production and VEGFR expression also have been reported for some solid tumor cell lines \nin vitro.\n (See, \nSato, K. et al., Tohoku J. Exp. Med., 185: 173-84 (1998\n) ; \nIshii, Y., Nippon Sanka Fujinka Gakkai Zasshi,:47: 133-40 (1995\n); and \nFerrer, F.A. et al, Urology, 54:567-72 (1999\n)). It has further been demonstrated that VEGFR-1 Mabs inhibit an autocrine VEGFR/human VEGFR-1 loop in breast carcinoma cells. \nWu, et al., \"\nMonoclonal antibody against VEGFR1 inhibits flt1-positive DU4475 human breast tumor growth by a dual mechanism involving anti-angiogenic and tumor cell growth inhibitory activities,\n\" AACR NCI EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics, Oct. 29-Nov. 2, 2001, Abstract #7\n .\n\n\nLu et al (International Journal of Cancer, NY; USA; Vol. 97, Jan 2002, pages 393-399\n) reports isolated high-affinity human Fab fragments directed against KDR from an antibody phage library.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere remains a need for agents which inhibit VEGF receptor activity to treat or prevent VEGF-receptor dependent diseases or conditions, by inhibiting, for example, pathogenic angiogenesis or tumor growth through inhibition of the paracrine and/or autocrine VEGF/ VEGFR loop.\n\n\n \n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides human antibodies, and portions thereof that bind to KDR, block binding of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to KDR, and neutralize activation of KDR, as defined by the claims.\n\nThe invention provides an isolated antibody or fragment thereof which binds selectively to human kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR), wherein the antibody or fragment thereof comprises complementarity determining regions represented by SEQ ID NO: 81 at CDRL1; SEQ ID NO: 82 at CDRL2; SEQ ID NO: 83 at CDRL3; SEQ ID NO: 13 at CDRH1; SEQ ID NO: 14 at CDRH2; and SEQ ID NO: 15 at CDRH3.\n\nPreferably an antibody or fragment thereof according to the invention comprises a light chain variable domain represented by SEQ ID NO: 53 and a heavy chain variable domain represented by SEQ ID NO: 24.\n\nAn antibody or fragment thereof according to the invention is preferably selected from the group consisting of a single chain antibody, a Fab, a single chain Fv, a diabody, and a triabody.\n\nFurther aspects of the invention relate to an isolated polynucleotide which comprises a nucleotide sequence that encodes an antibody or fragment of the invention, an expression vector comprising a polynucleotide of SEQ ID NO: 52 and a recombinant host cell comprising said expression vector.\n\nThe antibodies are used for treating neoplastic diseases, including, for example, solid and non-solid tumors.

The antibodies comprise human V\nH\n and V\nL\n framework regions (FWs) as well as human complementary determining regions (CDRs). Preferably, the entire V\nH\n and V\nL\n variable domains are human or derived from human sequences. For example, a variable domain of the invention may be obtained from a peripheral blood lymphocyte that contains a rearranged variable region gene. Alternatively, variable domain portions, such as CDR and FW regions, may be derived from different human sequences. In another example, a human V\nH\n variable domain is encoded by a human V\nH\n gene segment and a synthetic sequence for the CDR3H region (i.e., a synthetic D\nH\n-J\nH\n gene segment. Likewise, a human V\nL\n variable domain may be encoded by a human V\nL\n gene segment and a synthetic sequence for the CDR3L region (i.e., a synthetic J\nL\n gene segment).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies of the present invention also include those for which binding characteristics have been improved by direct mutation, methods of affinity maturation, phage display, or chain shuffling. Affinity and specificity may be modified or improved by mutating CDRs and screening for antigen binding sites having the desired characteristics (see, e.g., \nYang et al, J. Mol. Biol., 254: 392-403 (1995\n)). CDRs are mutated in a variety of ways. One way is to randomize individual residues or combinations of residues so that in a population of otherwise identical antigen binding sites, all twenty amino acids are found at particular positions. Alternatively, mutations are induced over a range of CDR residues by error prone PCR methods (see, e.g., \nHawkins et al., J. Mol. Biol., 226: 889-896 (1992\n)). For example, phage display vectors containing heavy and light chain variable region genes may be propagated in mutator strains of \nE. coli\n (see, e.g., \nLow et al., J. Mol. Biol., 250: 359-368 (1996\n)). These methods of mutagenesis are illustrative of the many methods known to one of skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies bind to KDR and neutralize activation, for example, by blocking receptor dimerization and/or VEGF binding. Antibodies of the invention can be used to neutralize VEGFR activation \nin vitro\n or \nin vivo.\n by binding to an extracellular domain of a VEGF receptor. Extracellular domains of a VEGF receptor include, for example, a ligand-binding domain on an extracellular portion of the receptor. \nIn vivo\n, the antibodies inhibit angiogenesis, and/or reduce tumor growth.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies are proteins that recognize and bind to a specific antigen or substance. The antibodies of the present invention bind KDR at least as strongly as the natural ligand. Affinity, represented by the equilibrium constant for the dissociation of an antigen with an antibody (\nKd\n), measures the binding strength between an antigenic determinant and an antibody binding site. Avidity is the measure of the strength of binding between an antibody with its antigen. Avidity is related to both the affinity between an epitope with its antigen binding site on the antibody, and the valence of the antibody. Valency refers to the number of antigen binding sites which an immunoglobulin has for a particular epitope. For example, a monovalent antibody has one binding site for a particular epitope. An antigenic determinant, or epitope, is the site on an antigen at wich a given antibody binds. Typical values of K are 10\n5\n to 10\n11\n liters/mol. Any K less than 10\n4\n liters/mol is considered to indicate binding which is nonspecific. The reciprocal of K is designated as K\nd\n. (K\nd\n also may be referred to as the dissociation constant.) The lesser the value of the K\nd\n, the stronger the binding strength between an antigenic determinant and the antibody binding site.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe natural ligand of KDR is human VEGF. VEGF binds KDR with an affinity (K\nd\n) of about 0.93 nM In order to hinder the binding of VEGF with KDR, an anti-KDR antibody should bind KDR at least as strongly as VEGF. In other words, the anti-KDR antobody needs to successfully compete with VEGF with respect to binding KDR. An antibody with a K\nd\n of at most 5 nM is considered to bind as strongly as the natural ligand. The antibodies of the invention preferably bind KDR with an affinity of at most about 4 nM, more preferably with an affinity of at most about 3 nM, most preferably with an affinity of at most about 2 nM, and optimally with an affinity of at most about 1 nM. The avidity of bivalent antibodies will, of course, be greater than the affinity. Bivalent antibodies preferably bind KDR with an avidity greater than 0.5 nM, more preferably greater than 0.25 nM, and optimally greater than 0.1 nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies of the invention neutralize KDR (See Examples.) In this specification, neutralizing a receptor means diminishing and/or inactivating the intrinsic kinase activity of the receptor to transduce a signal. A reliable assay for KDR neutralization is the inhibition of receptor phosphorylation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention is not limited by any particular mechanism of KDR neutralization. The mechanism followed by one antibody is not necessarily the same as that followed by another. Some possible mechanisms include preventing binding of the VEGF ligand to the extracellular binding domain of the KDR, and preventing dimerization or oligomerization of receptors. Other mechanisms cannot, however, be ruled out.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies of the invention include, but are not limited to, naturally occurring antibodies, bivalent fragments such as (Fab')\n2\n, monovalent fragments such as Fab, single chain antibodies, single chain Fv (scFv), single domain antibodies, multivalent single chain antibodies, diabodies, triabodies, and the like that bind specifically with antigens.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMonovalent single chain antibodies (i.e., scFv) include an antibody variable heavy chain fragment (V\nH\n) linked to an antibody variable light-chain fragment (V\n1\n) by a peptide linker which allows the two fragments to associate to form a functional antigen binding site (see, for example \n \nU.S. Pat. No. 4,946,778 (Ladner et al.\n \n), \n \nWO 88/09344, (Huston et al.\n \n). \n \nWO 92/01047 (McCafferty et al.\n \n) describes the display of scFv fragments on the surface of soluble recombinant genetic display packages, such as bacteriophage. A single chain antibody with a linker (L) can be represented as V\nL\n-L-V\nH\n or V\nH\n-L-V\nL\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach domain of the antibodies of this invention may be a complete antibody heavy or light chain variable domain, or it may be a functional equivalent or a mutant or derivative of a naturally occuring domain, or a synthetic domain constructed, for example, in vitro using a technique such as one described in \n \nWO 93/11236 (Griffiths et al.\n \n). For instance, it is possible to join together domains corresponding to antibody variable domains which are missing at least one amino acid. The important characterizing feature is the ability of each domain to associate with a complementary domain to form an antigen binding site. Accordingly, the terms \"variable heavy/light chain fragment\" should not be construed to exclude variants which do not have a material effect on how the invention works.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFunctional equivalents of the invention include polypeptides with amino acid sequences substantially the same as the amino acid sequence of the variable or hypervariable regions of the full length KDR antibodies. \"Substantially the same\" amino acid sequence is defined herein as a sequence with at least 70%, preferably at least about 80%, and more preferably at least about 90% homology to another amino acid sequence, as determined by the FASTA search method in accordance with \nPearson and Lipman, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85, 2444-8 (1988\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSingle domain antibodies have a single variable domain that is capable of efficiently binding antigen. Examples of antibodies wherein binding affinity and specificity are contributed primarily by one or the other variable domain are known in the art. See, e.g., \nJeffrey, P.D. et al., Proc. Nat.l. Acad. Sci. USA 90:10310-4 (1993\n), which discloses an anti-digoxin antibody which binds to digoxin primarily by the antibody heavy chain. Accordingly, single antibody domains can be identified that bind well to VEGF receptors. Such antibody domains can be obtained, for example, from naturally occurring antibodies, or Fab or scFv phage display libraries. It is understood that, to make a single domain antibody from an antibody comprising a V\nH\n and a V\nL\n domain, certain amino acid substitutions outside the CDR regions may be desired to enhance binding, expression or solubility. For example, it may be desirable to modify amino acid residues that would otherwise be buried in the V\nH\n-V\nL\n interface.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore recently, antibodies that are homodimers of heavy chains have been discovered in camelids (camels, dromedaries and llamas). These heavy chain antibodies are devoid of light chains and the first constant domain. (See, e.g., \nMuyldermans, S., 2001, J. Biotechnol. 74:277-302\n) The reduced-size antigen binding fragments are well expressed in bacteria, bind to antigen with high affinity, and are very stable. Phage display libraries of single domain antibodies (\ni.e\n., having a single variable domain that can be a light chain or a heavy chain variable domain) can be produced and screened in the same manner as scFv and Fab libraries. Scaffolds for such single domain antibodies can be modified mouse or human variable domains. It is noted that single antibody domains can bind antigen in a variety of antigen binding modes. That is, the primary antibody-antigen interactions are not limited to amino acid residues corresponding to CDRs of V\nH\n-V\nL\n containing antibodies, and consideration can be given to binding interactions outside of CDR residues when optimizing the binding characteristics of such antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSingle chain antibodies lack some or all of the constant domains of the whole antibodies from which they are derived. Therefore, they may overcome some of the problems associated with the use of whole antibodies. For example, single-chain antibodies tend to be free of certain undesired interactions between heavy-chain constant regions and other biological molecules. Additionally, single-chain antibodies are considerably smaller than whole antibodies and may have greater permeability than whole antibodies, allowing single-chain antibodies to localize and bind to target antigen-binding sites more efficiently. Also, single chain antibodies can be produced on a relatively large scale in prokaryotic cells, thus facilitating their production. Furthermore, the relatively small size of single-chain antibodies makes them less likely to provoke an unwanted immune response in a recipient than whole antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptide linkers used to produce the single chain antibodies may be flexible peptides selected to assure that the proper three-dimensional folding of the V\nL\n and V\nH\n domains may occur once they are linked so as to maintain the target molecule binding-specificity of the full length anti-KDR antibody. Generally, the carboxyl terminus of the V\nL\n or V\nH\n sequence may be covalently linked by such a peptide linker to the amino acid terminus of a complementary V\nH\n or V\nL\n sequence. The linker is generally 10 to 50 amino acid residues. Preferably, the linker is 10 to 30 amino acid residues. More preferably the linker is 12 to 30 amino acid residues. Most preferably is a linker of 15 to 25 amino acid residues. An example of such linker peptides include (Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser)\n3\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSingle chain antibodies, each having one V\nH\n and one V\nL\n domain covalently linked by a first peptide linker, can be covalently linked by at least one more peptide linker to form a multivalent single chain antibody. Multivalent single chain antibodies allow for the construction of antibody fragments which have the specificity and avidity of whole antibodies, but lack the constant regions of the full length Antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMultivalent antibodies may be monospecific or multispecific. The term specificity refers to the number of different types of antigenic determinants to which a particular antibody can bind. If the antibody binds to only one type of antigenic determinant, the antibody is monospecific. If the antibody binds to different types of antigenic determinants then the antibody is multispecific.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, a bispecific multivalent single chain antibody allows for the recognition of two different types of epitopes. The epitopes may both be on KDR. Alternatively, one epitope may be on KDR, and the other epitope may be on another antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach chain of a multivalent single chain antibody includes a variable light-chain fragment and a variable heavy-chain fragment, and is linked by a peptide linker to at least one other chain. The peptide linker is composed of at least fifteen amino acid residues. The maximum number of amino acid residues is about one hundred. In a preferred embodiment, the number of V\nL\n and V\nH\n domains is equivalent Preferably, the peptide linker (L\n1\n) joining the V\nH\n and V\nL\n domains to form a chain and the peptide linker (L\n2\n joining two or more chains to form a multivalent scFv have substantially the same amino acid sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, a bivalent single chain antibody can be represented as follows: V\nL\n-L\n1\n-V\nH\n-L\n2\n-V\nL\n-L\n1\n-V\nH\n; or V\nL\n-L\n1\n-V\nH\n-L\n2\n-V\nH\n-L\n1\n-V\nH\n; or V\nH\n-L\n1\n-V\nL\n-L\n2\n-V\nH\n-L\n1\n-V\nL\n; or V\nH\n-L\n1\n-V\nL\n-L\n2\n-V\nL\n-L\n1\n-V\nH\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMultivalent single chain antibodies which are trivalent or greater have one or more antibody fragments joined to a bivalent single chain antibody by additional peptide linkers. One example of a trivalent single chain antibody is:\n\n\n\n        V\nL\n-L\n1\n-V\nH\n-L\n2\n-V\nL\n-L\n1\n-V\nH\n-L\n2\n-V\nL\n-L\n1\n-V\nH\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo single chain antibodies can be combined to form a diabody, also known as a bivalent dimer. Diabodies have two chains and two binding sites, and may be monospecific or bispecific. Each chain of the diabody includes a V\nH\n domain connected to a V\nL\n domain. The domains are connected with linkers that are short enough to prevent pairing between domains on the same chain, thus driving the pairing between complementary domains on different chains to recreate the two antigen-binding sites. Accordingly, one chain of a bispecific diabody comprises V\nH\n of a first specificity and V\nL\n of a second specificity, whereas the second chain comprises V\nH\n of the second specificity and V\nL\n of the first specificity. The peptide linker includes at least five amino acid residues and no more than ten amino acid residues, e.g. (Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser), (Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser)\n2\n. (SEQ ID NO:19.) The diabody structure is rigid and compact. The antigen-binding sites are at opposite ends of the molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThree single chain antibodies can be combined to form triabodies, also known as trivalent trimers. Triabodies are constructed with the amino acid terminus of a V\nL\n or V\nH\n domain directly fused to the carboxyl terminus of a V\nL\n or V\nH\n domain, i.e., without any linker sequence. The triabody has three Fv heads with the polypeptides arranged in a cyclic, head-to-tail fashion. A possible conformation of the triabody is planar with the three binding sites located in a plane at an angle of 120 degrees from one another. Triabodies may be monospecific, bispecific or trispecific.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably the antibodies of this invention contain all six complementarity determining regions of the whole antibody, although antibodies containing fewer than all of such regions, such as three, four or five CDRs, are also fictional.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo minimize the immunogenicity of antibodies that bind to VEGF receptors, the present invention provides antibodies which comprise human variable and constant domain sequences. The antibodies are derived from a human source and bind to an extacellular domain ofKDR and neutralize activation of the receptor. DNA encoding human antibodies may be prepared by recombining DNA encoding human constant regions and DNA encoding variable regions derived from humans. For example, antibodies of the invention can be obtained by screening libraries consisting of combinations of human light chain and heavy chain variable domains. The nucleic acids from which the antibodies are expressed can be somatically mutated, or be germline sequences derived from naive B cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDNA encoding human antibodies may be prepared by recombining DNA encoding human constant regions and variable regions, other than the CDRs, derived substantially or exclusively from the corresponding human antibody regions and DNA encoding CDRs derived from a human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable sources of DNAs that encode fragments of antibodies include any cell, such as hybridomas and spleen cells, that express the full length antibody. Another source is single chain antibodies produced from a phage display library as is known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies of this invention may be or may combine members of any immunoglobulin class, such as IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, or IgE, and the subclasses thereof\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe protein used to identify VEFGR binding antibodies of the invention is usually KDR, and is normally limited to the extracellular domain ofKDR. The KDR extracellular domain may be free or conjugated to another molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the examples below high affinity anti-KDR antibodies, which block VEGF binding to KDR, were isolated from a phage display library constructed from human heavy chain and light chain variable region genes. Over 90% of recovered clones after three rounds of selection are specific to KDR. The binding affinities for KDR of the screened Fabs are in the nM range, which are as high as those of several bivalent anti-KDR monoclonal antibodies produced using hybridoma technology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies of this invention may be fused to additional amino acid residues. Such residues may be a peptide tag, perhaps to facilitate isolation, or they may be a signal sequence for secretion of the polypeptide from a host cell upon synthesis. Suitably, secretory leader peptides are used, being amino acids joined to the N-terminal end of a polypeptide to direct movement of the polypeptide out of the cytosol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides nucleic acids which comprise a sequence encoding a polypeptide according to the invention, and diverse repertoires of such nucleic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies of the invention neutralize activation of KDR One measure of KDR neutralization is inhibition of the tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor. Tyrosine kinase inhibition can be determined using well-known methods. The antibodies of the present invention generally cause inhibition or regulation of phosphorylation events. Accordingly, phosphorylation assays are useful in determining antibodies useful in the context of the present invention. Tyrosine kinase inhibition may be determined by measuring the autophosphorylation level of recombinant kinase receptor, and/or phosphorylation of natural or synthetic substrates. Phosphorylation can be detected, for example, using an antibody specific for phosphotyrosine in an ELISA assay or on a western blot Some assays for tyrosine kinase activity are described in \nPanek et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Thera, 283: 1433-44 (1997\n) and \nBatley et aL, Life Sci., 62: 143-50 (1998\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, methods for detection of protein expression can be utilized, wherein the proteins being measured are regulated by KDR tyrosine kinase activity. These methods include immunohistochemistry (IHC) for detection of protein expression, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for detection of gene amplification, competitive radioligand binding assays, solid matrix blotting techniques, such as Northern and Southern blots, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and ELISA. See, e.g., \nGrandis et al., Cancer, 78:1284-92. (1996\n); \nShimizu et al., Japan J. Cancer Res., 85:567-71 (1994\n); \nSauter et al., Am. J. Path., 148:1047-53 (1996\n); \nCollins, Glia, 15:289-96 (1995\n); \nRadinsky et al., Clin. Cancer Res., 1:19-31 (1995\n); \nPetrides et al., Cancer Res., 50:3934-39 (1990\n); \nHoffmann et al., Anticancer Res., 17:4419-26 (1997\n); \nWikstrand et aL, Cancer Res., 55:3140-48 (1995\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nIn vivo\n assays can also be utilized. For example, receptor Tyrosine kinase inhibition can be observed by mitogenic assays using cell lines stimulated with receptor ligand in the presence and absence of inhibitor. For example, HUVEC cells (ATCC) stimulated with VEGF can be used to assay VEGFR inhibition. Another method involves testing for inhibition of growth of VEGF-expressing tumor cells, using for example, human tumor cells injected into a mouse. See, \n \nU.S. Patent No. 6,365,157 (Rockwell et al.\n \n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the methods of the present invention, a therapeutically effective amount of an antibody of the invention is administered to a mammal in need thereof. The term \"administering\" as used herein means delivering the antibodies of the present invention to a mammal by any method that may achieve the result sought. They may be administered, for example, intravenously or intramuscularly. Although human antibodies of the invention are particularly useful for administration to humans, they may be administered to other mammal as well. The term \"mammal\" as used herein is intended to include, but is not limited to, humans, laboratory animals, domestic pets and farm animals. \"Therapeutically effective amount\" means an amount of antibody of the present invention that, when administered to a mammal, is effective in producing the desired therapeutic effect, such as inhibiting kinase activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile not intended to be bound to any particular mechanism, the diseases and conditions which may be treated or prevented by the present methods include, for example, those in which pathogenic angiogenesis or tumor growth is stimulated through a VEGFR paracrine and/or autocrine loop.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNeutralization of activation of a VEGF receptor in endothelial or non-endothelial cells, such as tumor cells, may be performed \nin vitro\n or \nin vivo\n. Neutralizing VEGF activation of a VEGF receptor in a sample of VEGF-receptor expressing cells comprises contacting the cells with an antagonist, e.g., an antibody, of the invention. The cells are contacted \nin vitro\n with the antagonist, e.g., the antibody, before, simultaneously with, or after, adding VEGF to the cell sample.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nIn vivo,\n an antibody of the invention is contacted with a VEGF receptor by administration to a mammal, preferably a human. An \nin vivo\n neutralization method is useful for inhibiting tumor growth, angiogenesis associated with tumor growth, or other pathologic condition associated with angiogenesis, in a mammal. Accordingly, the antibodies of the invention are anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor immunotherapeutic agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTumors which may be treated include primary tumors and metastatic tumors, as well as refractory tumors. Refractory tumors include tumors that fail to respond or are resistant to treatment with chemotherapeutic agents alone, antibodies alone, radiation alone or combinations thereof. Refractory tumors also encompass tumors that appear to be inhibited by treatment with such agents, but recur up to five years, sometimes up to ten years or longer after treatment is discontinued.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies of the present invention are useful for treating tumors that express VEGF receptors, especially KDR Such tumors are characteristically sensitive to VEGF present in their environment, and may further produce and be stimulated by VEGF in an autocrine stimulatory loop. The method is therefore effective for treating a solid or non-solid tumor that is not vascularized, or is not yet substantially vascularized. Examples of solid tumors which may be accordingly treated include breast carcinoma, lung carcinoma, colorectal carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, glioma and lymphoma. Some examples of such tumors include epidermoid tumors, squamous tumors, such as head and neck tumors, colorectal tumors, prostate tumors, breast tumors, lung tumors, including small cell and non-small cell lung tumors, pancreatic tumors, thyroid tumors, ovarian tumors, and liver tumors. Other examples include Kaposi's sarcoma, CNS neoplasms, neuroblastomas, capillary hemangioblastomas, meningiomas and cerebral metastases, melanoma, gastrointestinal and renal carcinomas and sarcomas, rhabdomyosarcoma, glioblastoma, preferably glioblastoma multiforme, and leiomyosarcoma. Examples of vascularized skin cancers for which the antagonists of this invention are effective include squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma and skin cancers that can be treated by suppressing the growth of malignant keratinocytes, such as human malignant keratinocytes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of non-solid tumors include leukemia, multiple myeloma and lymphoma. Some examples of leukemias include acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), erythrocytic leukemia or monocytic leukemia. Some examples of lymphomas include Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExperimental results described below demonstrate that antibodies of the invention specifically block VEGF induced stimulation of KDR (VEGFR-2) in leukemia cells. \nIn\n vivo studies also described below show that the antibodies were able to significantly inhibit tumor growth in nude mice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA cocktail of VEGF receptor antagonists, e.g., monoclonal antibodies, provides an especially efficient treatment for inhibiting the growth of tumor cells. The cocktail may include non-antibody VEGFR antagonists and may have as few as 2, 3 or 4 receptor antagonists, and as many as 6, 8 or 10.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect of the invention, anti-KDR antibodies are used to inhibit angiogenesis. VEGFR stimulation of vascular endothelium is associated with angiogenic diseases and vascularization of tumors. Typically, vascular endothelium is stimulated in a paracrine fashion by VEGF from other sources (\ne.g\n., tumor cells).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, the human anti-KDR antibodies are effective for treating subjects with vascularized tumors or neoplasms or angiogenic diseases. Such tumors and neoplasms include, for example, malignant tumors and neoplasms, such as blastomas, carcinomas or sarcomas, and highly vascular tumors and neoplasms. Cancers that may be treated by the methods of the present invention include, for example, cancers of the brain, genitourinary tract, lymphatic system, stomach, renal, colon, larynx and lung and bone. Nonlimiting examples further include epidermoid tumors, squamous tumors, such as head and neck tumors, colorectal tumors, prostate tumors, breast tumors, lung tumors, including lung adenocarcinoma and small cell and non-small cell lung tumors, pancreatic tumors, thyroid tumors, ovarian tumors, and liver tumors. The method is also used for treatment of vascularized skin cancers, including squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, and skin cancers that can be treated by suppressing the growth of malignant keratinocytes, such as human malignant keratinocytes. Other cancers that can be treated include Kaposi's sarcoma, CNS neoplasms (neuroblastomas, capillary hemangioblastomas, meningiomas and cerebral metastases), melanoma, gastrointestinal and renal carcinomas and sarcomas, rhabdomyosarcoma, glioblastoma, including glioblastoma multiforme, and leiomyosarcoma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA further aspect of the present invention includes methods of treating or preventing pathologic conditions characterized by excessive angiogenesis, involving, for example, vascularization and/or inflammation, such as atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), neovascular glaucoma, proliferative retinopathy including proliferative diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, hemangiomas, angiofibromas, and psoriasis. Other nonlimiting examples of non-neoplastic angiogenic disease are retinopathy of prematurity (retrolental fibroplastic), corneal graft rejection, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, Chron's disease, autoimmune nephritis, primary biliary cirrhosis, acute pancreatitis, allograph rejection, allergic inflammation, contact dermatitis and delayed hypersensitivity reactions, inflammatory bowel disease, septic shock, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, cognition defects induced by neuronal inflammation, Osler-Weber syndrome, restinosis, and fungal, parasitic and viral infections, including cytomegaloviral infections.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe identification of such disease is well within the ability and knowledge of one skilled in the art. For example, human individuals who are either suffering from a clinically significant neoplastic or angiogenic disease or who are at risk of developing clinically significant symptoms are suitable for administration of the present VEGF receptor antibodies. A clinician skilled in the art can readily determine, for example, by the use of clinical tests, physical examination and medical/family history, if an individual is a candidate for such treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMoreover, included is use of the present antibodies \nin vivo\n and \nin vitro\n for investigative or diagnostic methods, which are well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present anti-KDR antibodies can be administered for therapeutic treatments to a patient suffering from a tumor or angiogenesis associated pathologic condition in an amount sufficient to prevent, inhibit, or reduce the progression of the tumor or pathologic condition. Progression includes, e.g, the growth, invasiveness, metastases and/or recurrence of the tumor or pathologic condition. An amount adequate to accomplish this is defined as a therapeutically effective dose. Amounts effective for this use will depend upon the severity of the disease and the general state of the patient's own immune system. Dosing schedules will also vary with the disease state and status of the patient, and will typically range from a single bolus dosage or continuous infusion to multiple administrations per day (e.g., every 4-6 hours), or as indicated by the treating physician and the patient's condition. It should be noted, however, that the present invention is not limited to any particular dose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-KDR antibodies can be administered in combination with one or more other antineoplastic agents. For examples of combination therapies, see, \ne\n.\ng\n., \n \nU.S. Patent No. 6,217,866 (Schlessinger et aL\n \n) (Anti-EGFR antibodies in combination with antineoplastic agents); \n \nWO 99/60023 (Waksal et al.\n \n) (Anti-EGFR antibodies in combination with radiation). Any suitable antineoplastic agent can be used, such as a chemotherapeutic agent or radiation. Examples of chemotherapeutic agents include, but are not limited to, cisplatin, doxorubicin, paclitaxel, irinotecan (CPT-11), topotecan or a combination thereof. When the antineoplastic agent is radiation, the source of the radiation can be either external (external beam radiation therapy - EBRT) or internal (brachytherapy - BT) to the patient being treated. The dose of antineoplastic agent administered depends on numerous factors, including, for example, the type of agent, the type and severity tumor being treated and the route of administration of the agent. It should be emphasized, however, that the present invention is not limited to any particular dose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, anti-KDR antibodies of the invention may be administered with antibodies that neutralize other receptors involved in tumor growth or angiogenesis. One example of such a receptor is the VEGFR-1/Flt-1 receptor. In an embodiment of the invention, an anti-KDR antibody is used in combination with a receptor antagonist that binds specifically to VEGF-1. Particularly preferred are antigen-binding proteins that bind to the extracellular domain of VEGFR-1 and block binding by one or both of its ligands, VEGF and PIGF, and/or neutralize VEGF-induced or P1GF-induced activation of VEGFR-1. For example, mAb 6.12 is a scFv that binds to soluble and cell surface-expressed VBGFR-1. ScFv 6.12 comprises the V\nL\n and V\nH\n domains of mouse monoclonal antibody mAb 6.12. A hybridoma cell line producing mAb 6.12 has been deposited as ATCC number PTA-3344 under the provisions of the Budapest Treaty on the International Recognition of the Deposit of Microorganisms for the Purposes of Patent Procedure and the regulations thereunder (Budapest Treaty).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother example of such a receptor is EGFR. In an embodiment of the present invention, an anti-KDR antibody is used in combination with an EGFR antagonist. An EGFR antagonist can be an antibody that binds to EGFR or a ligand of EGFR and inhibits binding of EGFR to its ligand. Ligands for EGFR include, for example, EGF, TGF-α amphiregulin, heparin-binding EGF (HB-EGF) and betarecullulin. EGF and TGF-α are thought to be the main endogenous ligands that result in EGFR-mediated stimulation, although TGF-α has been shown to be more potent in promoting angiogenesis. It should be appreciated that the EGFR antagonist can bind externally to the extracellular portion of EGFR, which may or may not inhibit binding of the ligand, or internally to the tyrosine kinase domain. Examples of EGFR antagonists that bind EGFR include, without limitation, biological molecules, such as antibodies (and functional equivalents thereof) specific for EGFR, and small molecules, such as synthetic kinase inhibitors that act directly on the cytoplasmic domain of EGFR.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther examples of growth factor receptors involved in tumorigenesis are the receptors for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGFR), insulin-like growth factor (IGFR), nerve growth factor (NGFR), and fibroblast growth factor (FGFR).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an additional alternative embodiment, the VEGFR antagonist can be administered in combination with one or more suitable adjuvants, such as, for example, cytokines (IL-10 and IL-13, for example) or other immune stimulators. \nSee, e.g.,\n Larrivée et al., supra. It should be appreciated, however, that administration of only an anti-KDR antibody is sufficient to prevent, inhibit, or reduce the progression of the tumor in a therapeutically effective manner.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a combination therapy, the anti-KDR antibody is administered before, during, or after commencing therapy with another agent, as well as any combination thereof, i.e., before and during, before and after, during and after, or before, during and after commencing the antineoplastic agent therapy. For example, the anti-KDR antibody may be administered between 1 and 30 days, preferably 3 and 20 days, more preferably between 5 and 12 days before commencing radiation therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the present invention, any suitable method or route can be used to administer anti-KDR antibodies of the invention, and optionally, to coadminister antineoplastic agents and/or antagonists of other receptors. Routes of administration include, for example, oral, intravenous, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, or intramuscular administration. The dose of antagonist administered depends on numerous factors, including, for example, the type of antagonists, the type and severity tumor being treated and the route of administration of the antagonists. It should be emphasized, however, that the present invention is not limited to any particular method or route of administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is noted that an anti-KDR antibody can be administered as a conjugate, which binds specifically to the receptor and delivers a toxic, lethal payload following ligand-toxin internalization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is understood that the anti-KDR antibodies of the invention, where used in a mammal for the purpose of prophylaxis or treatment, will be administered in the form of a composition additionally comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include, for example, one or more of water, saline, phosphate buffered saline, dextrose, glycerol, ethanol and the like, as well as combinations thereof Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers may further comprise minor amounts of auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents, preservatives or buffers, which enhance the shelf life or effectiveness of the binding proteins. The compositions of the injection may, as is well known in the art, be formulated so as to provide quick, sustained or delayed release of the active ingredient administration to the mammal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso provided are kits for inhibiting tumor growth and/or angiogenesis comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a human anti-KDR antibody. The kits can further contain any suitable antagonist of, for example, another growth factor receptor involved in tumorigenesis or angiogenesis (e.g., VBGPR-1/Flt-1, BGFR, PDGFR, IGFR, NGFR, FGFR, etc, as described above). Alternatively, or in addition, the kits can further comprise an antineoplastic agent. Examples of suitable antineoplastic agents in the context of the present invention have been described herein. The kits can further comprise an adjuvant, examples have also been described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn anti-KDR antibody of the invention can be chemically or biosynthetically linked to one or more antineoplastic or antiangiogenic agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther contemplates are anti-KDR antibodies to which target or reporter moieties are linked. Target moieties are first members of binding pairs. Antineoplastic agents, for example, are conjugated to second members of such pairs and are thereby directed to the site where the anti-KDR antibody is bound. A common example of such a binding pair is adivin and biotin. Biotin is conjugated to an anti-KDR antibody, and thereby provides a target for an antineoplastic agent or other moiety which is conjugated to avidin or streptavidin. Alternatively, biotin or another such moiety is linked to an anti-KDR antibody of the invention and used as a reporter, for example in a diagnostic system where a detectable signal-producing agent is conjugated to avidin or\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, the present receptor antagonists thus can be used \nin vivo\n and \nin vitro\n for investigative, diagnostic, prophylactic, or treatment methods, which are well known in the art.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe Examples and reference Examples which follow are set forth to aid in understanding the invention but are not intended to, and should not be construed to, limit its scope in any way. The Examples do not include detailed descriptions of conventional methods, such as those employed in the construction of vectors and plasmids, the insertion of genes encoring polypeptides into such vectors and plasmids, or the introduction of plasmids into host cells. Such methods are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art and are described in numerous publications including\n Sambrook, J., and Russell, D.W. (2001) Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 3rd edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press\n.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample I.

The soluble fusion proteins, KDR-alkaline phosphatase (AP), its immunoglobulin (Ig) domain-deletion variants, and Flk-1-AP, were expressed in stably transfected NIH 3T3 and purified from cell culture supernatants by affinity chromatography using immobilized monoclonal antibody to AP as described by \nLu et al., J.

The amplified phage preparation was blocked with 1/6 volume of 18% milk/PB8 at RT for 1h and added to Maxi-sorp 96-well microtiter plates (Nunc) coated with KDR-AP or AP (1µg/ml x 100 µl). After incubation at RT for 1h the plates were washed 3 times with PBST and incubated with a rabbit anti-M13 phage-HRP conjugate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). The plates were washed 5 times, TMB peroxidase substrate (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) added, and the absorbance at 450 nm read using a microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).\n\n\n \n\n\nExample I(c). \nDNA\n BstN I pattern analysis \nand\n nucleotide \nsequencing.\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe diversity of the anti-KDR Fab clones after each round of selection was analyzed by restriction enzyme digestion patterns (i.e., DNA fingerprints). The Fab gene insert of individual clones was PCR amplified using primers: PUC19 reverse, 5' AGCGGATAACAATTTCACACAGG 3'; and fdtet seq, 5' GTCGTCTTTCCAGACGTTAGT 3'. The amplified product was digested with a frequent-cutting enzyme, \nBstN\n I, and analyzed on a 3% agarose geL DNA sequences of representative clones from each digestion pattern were determined by dideoxynucleotide sequencing.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample I(d). \nExpression and purification of soluble Fab fragments.\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nPlasmids of individual clones were used to transform a nonsuppressor \nE\n. \ncoli\n host HB2151. Expression of the Fab fragments in HB2151 was induced by culturing the cells in 2YTA medium containing 1 mM isopropyl-1-tbio-β-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG, Sigma) at 30°C. A periplasmic extract of the cells was prepared by resuspending the cell pellet in 25 mM Tris (pH 7.5) containing 20% (w/v) sucrose, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 0.1 mM PMSF, followed by incubation at 4°C with gentle shaking for 1 h. After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 min, the soluble Fab protein was purified from the supernatant by affinity chromatography using a Protein G column followed the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).\n\n\n \n\n\nExample I(e). \nSelection of human anti-KDR Fab from phage display library.\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA large human Fab phage display library containing 3.7 x 10\n10\n clones (\nDeHaard et al., J. Biol. Chem. 274: 18218-30 (1999\n)) was used for the selection. The library consists of PCR-amplified antibody variable light chain genes and variable heavy chain genes fused to human constant light chain genes (κ and λ) and DNA encoding the IgGl \nheavy chain C\n \n \n \nH\n1 domain, respectively. Both heavy and light chain constructs are preceded by a signal sequence - \npel\nB for the light chain and gene III signal sequence for the heavy chain. Heavy chain constructs further encode a portion of the gene III protein for phage display, a hexahistidine tag, and an 11 amino-acid-long c-myc tag, followed by an amber codon (TAG). The hexahistidine and c-myc tags can be used for purification or detection. The amber codon allows for phage display using suppressor hosts (such as TG1 cells) or production of Fab fragments in soluble form when transformed into a nonsupressor host (such as HB2151 cells).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe library stock was grown to log phase, rescued with M13-KO7 helper phage and amplified overnight in 2YTAK medium (2YT containing 100 µg/ml of ampicillin and 50 µg/ml of kanamycin) at 30°C. The phage preparation was precipitated in 4% PEG/0.5M NaCl, resuspended in 3% fat-free milk/PBS containing 500 µg/ml of AP protein and incubated at 37°C for 1 h to capture phage displaying anti-AP Fab fragments and to block other nonspecific binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nKDR-AP (10 µg/ml in PBS) coated Maxisorp Star tubes (Nunc, Rosklide, Denmark) were first blocked with 3% milk/PBS at 37°C for 1h, and then incubated with the phage preparation at RT for 1 h. The tubes were washed 10 times with PBST (PBS containing 0.1 % Twee-20) followed by 10 times with PBS. Bound phage were eluted at RT for 10 min with 1 ml of a freshly prepared solution of 100 mM triethylamine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The eluted phage were incubated with 10 ml of mid-log phase TG1 cells at 37°C for 30 min stationary and 30 min shaking. The infected TG1 cells were pelleted and plated onto several large 2YTAG plates and incubated overnight at 30°C. All the colonies grown on the plates were scraped into 3 to 5 ml of 2YTA medium, mixed with glycerol (10% final concentration), aliquoted and stored at -70°C. For the next round selection, 100 µl of the phage stock was added to 25 ml of 2YTAG medium and grown to mid-log phase. The culture was rescued with M13K07 helper phage, amplified, precipitated, and used for selection followed the procedure described above, with reduced concentrations of KDR-AP immobilized on the immunotube and increased number of washes after the binding process.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA total of three rounds of selection were performed on immobilized KDR, with varying protein concentrations and number of washings after the initial binding process. After each round selection, 93 clones were randomly picked and tested by phage ELISA for binding to KDR. Seventy out of the 93 clones (75%) picked after the second selection, and greater than 90% of the recovered clones after the third selection were positive in KDR binding, suggesting a high efficiency of the selection process. DNA segments encoding the Fab from all the 70 binders identified in the second selection were amplified, digested with \nBstN\n I, and compared for fingerprint patterns. A total of 42 different patterns were observed, indicating an excellent diversity of the isolated anti-KDR Fab. Cross-reactivity examination demonstrated that 19 out of the 42 antibodies were specific KDR-binders, whereas the rest 23 antibodies bound to both KDR and its murine homologue, Flk-1. Further selection was achieved with a competitive VEGF-binding assay in which the binding of soluble KDR to immobilized VEGF in the presence or absence of the anti-KDR Fab fragments was determined. The assay identified four Fab clones that were capable of blocking the binding between VEGF and KDR. Three were KDR-specific binders and one cross-reacted with Flk-1. DNA fingerprinting and sequencing analysis confirmed that all four KDR/VBGF blocking antibodies were different (\nFig. 1A\n) with unique DNA and amino acid sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino acid sequences for CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 of V\nH\n and V\nL\n for the four reference example clones are given in Table 1.\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable 1- CDR sequences af selected KDR-trinding human Fabs\n \n \n \n \nClone\n \nCDR1\n \nCDR2\n \nCDR3\n \n \n \nLight Chain\n \n \n \n \nD2C6\n \nRASQSVSSYLA\n\n(SEQ ID NO:1)\n \nDSSNRAT\n\n(SEQ ID NO:2)\n \nLQHNTFPFT\n\n(SEQ ID NO:3)\n \n \n \nD2H2\n \nRASQGISSRLA\n\n(SBQ ID NO:4)\n \nAASSLQT\n\n(SEQ ID NO:5)\n \nQQANRFPPT\n\n(SEQ ID NO:6)\n \n \n \nDIH4\n \nAGTTTDLTYYDLVS\n\n(SEQ ID NO:7)\n \nDGNKRPS\n\n(SEQ ID NO:8)\n \nNSYVSSRFYV\n\n(SBQ ID NO:9)\n \n \n \nD1F7\n \nSGBTSWGTNTAN\n\n(SEQ ID NO:10\n \nNNNQRPS\n\n(SEQ ID NO:11)\n \nAAWDDSLNGHWV\n\n(SEQ ID NO:12)\n \n \n \n \n \n \nHeavy Chain\n \n \n \n \nD2C6\n \nGFTFSSYSMN\n\n(SEQ M NO:13)\n \nSISSSSSYIYYADSVKG\n\n(SBQ ID NO:14)\n \nVTDAFDI\n\n(SEQ ID NO:15)\n \n \n \nD2H2\n \nGFTFSSYSMN\n\n(SEQ ID NO:13)\n \nSISSSSSYIYYADSVKG\n\n(SEQ ID NO:14)\n \nVTDAFDI\n\n(SEQ ID NO:15)\n \n \n \nD1H4\n \nGFTFSSYSMN (SBQ\n\nID NO:13)\n \nSISSSSSYIYYADSVKG\n\n(SEQ ID NO:14)\n \nVTDAFDI\n\n(SEQ ID NO:15)\n \n \n \nD1F7\n \nGGTFSSYAIS\n\n(SEQ ID NO:16)\n \nGGHFIFGTANYAQKFQG\n\n(SEQ ID NO:17)\n \nGYDYYDSSGVASPPDY\n\n(SEQ ID NO:18\n \n \n \n \n \nComplete sequences for the V\nH\n and V\nL\n chains are presented in the Sequence Listing.

The plates were then incubated at RT for 1 h with 100 µl of a rabbit anti-human Fab antibody-HRP conjugate (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory Inc., West Grove, PA). The plates were washed and developed following the procedure described above for the phage ELISA In a competitive KDR/VEGF blocking assay, various amounts of Fab proteins were mixed with a fixed amount of KDR-AP (100 ng) and incubated at RT for 1 h. The mixtures were then transferred to 96-well microtiter plates precoated with VBGF\n165\n (200 ng/well) and incubated at RT for an additional 2 h, after which the plates were washed 5 times and the substrate for AP (p-nitophenyl phosphate, Sigma) was added. Absorbance at 405mn was measured to quantify the bound KDR-AP molecules (8). IC\n50\n, \ni.e\n, the Fab protein concentration required for 50% inhibition of KDR binding to VEGF, was then calculated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe four VEGF-blocking clones (D2C6, D2H2, D1H4. D1F7) were expressed as soluble Fab and purified from periplasmic extracts of \nE\n. \ncoli\n by Protein G affinity chromatography. The yield of purified Fab proteins of these clones ranged from 60 to 400 µg / liter culture. SDS-PAGE analysis of each purified Fab preparation yielded a single protein band with expected molecular size (\nFig. 1B\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFig 2\n shows the dose-dependent binding of the anti-KDR Fab fragments to immobilized receptor as assayed by a direct binding ELISA. Clone D2C6 and D2H2 are more efficient binders, followed by clone D1H4 and D1F7. All four Fabs also block KDR binding to immobilized VEGF (\nFig. 2B\n). The antibody concentrations required for 50% of Inhibition of KDR binding to VEGF are approximately 2 nM for clones D2C6, D2H2, and D1H4 and 20 nM for clone D1F7. Only clone D1F7 blocks VEGF from binding to Flk-1 (\nFig. 2C\n), with an IC\n50\n of approximately 15 nM.\n\n\n \n\n\nReference Example II(b). \nBIAcore analysis of the soluble scFv\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe binding kinetics of soluble Fab proteins to KDR were measured by surface plasmon resonance using a DIAcore biosensor (Pharmacis Biosensor). KDR-AP fusion protein was immobilized onto a sensor chip and soluble Fab proteins were injected at concentrations ranging from 1.5 nM to 100 nM. Sensorgrams were obtained at each concentration and were evaluated using a grogram, BIA Evaluation 2.0, to determine the rate constants \nkon\n and \nkoff\n. K\nd\n was calculated from the ratio of rate constants \nkofflkon.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll three KDR-specific Fab fragments bind to immobilized receptor with \nKd\n of 2 to 4 nM (Table 3). The cross-reactive clone, D1F7, has a \nKd\n of \n45\n nM, which is about 10- to 15-fold weaker than those of the KDR-specific clones. It is noteworthy that, although the overall \nKd\n for the three KDR-specific Fab fragments are similar, the individual binding kinetics, i.e., the \nkon\n and \nkoff\n, for these antibodies are quite different, e.g., D2C6 possesses the fastest on-rate, while D1H4 has the slowest off-rate (Table 3).\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable 3 - Binding kinetics of the four neutralizing human anti-KDR Fab fragments\n \n \n \n \nClone\n \n \nkon\n (10\n4\n M\n-1\nS\n-1\n)\n \n \nkoff\n (10\n-4\nS\n-1\n)\n \nKd(nM)\n \n \n \n \nHu-2C6 Fab\n \n27.3±8.6*\n \n5.38±0.54\n \n1.97\n \n \n \nHu-2H2 Fab\n \n12.4±29\n \n4,87±0.18\n \n3.93\n \n \n \nHu-1H4 Fab\n \n5.55±0.59\n \n1.53±0.22\n \n2.76\n \n \n \nHu-1F7 Fab\n \n4.14±1.21\n \n18.7±2.12\n \n45.2\n \n \n \n \n \n*All numbers are determined by BIAcore analysis and represent the mean ± SE from at least three separate determinations.\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\nReference Example II(c). \nBinding epitope mapping\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe production of KDR extracellular Ig-like domain deletion variants has been previously described (Lu et al. (2000)). In an epitope-mapping assay, full length KDR-AP, Ap fusions of two KDR Ig-domain deletion variants, and Flk-1-AP were first immobilized onto a 96-well plate (Nunc) using a rabbit anti-AP antibody (DAKO-immunoglobulins Glostrup, Denmark) as the capture reagent. The plate was then incubated with various anti-KDR Fab proteins at RT for 1 h, followed by incubation with a rabbit anti-human Fab anbbody-MP conjugate. The plate was washed and developed as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe binding epitopes of the anti-KDR Fab fragments were mapped using the full-length KDR and two KDR Ig domain-deletion variants. KDR(1-3) is a KDR variant containing the first three N-terminal Ig domains. KDR(3) is a variant containing only the third Ig domain. As shown in \nFig. 3\n, clones D2C6 and D1H4 bind equally well to KDR, KDR(1-3) and KDR3), thus locating their binding epitope(s) within \nIg domain\n 3. Clones D2H2 and D1F7 bind much more efficiently to full-length KDR and RDR(1-3), indicating a broader binding epitope(s) within \nKDR Ig domains\n 1 to 3. Only clone DIF7 cross-reacts with Flk-1.\n\n\n \n\n\nReference Example II(d). \nAnti-mitogenic assay.\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nHUVEC (5x10\n3\n cells/well) were plated onto 96-well tissue culture plates (Wallach, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) in 200 µl of BBM-2 medium without VEGF, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) or epidermal growth factor (EGF) and incubated at 37°C for 72 h. Various amounts of Fab proteins were added to duplicate wells and pre-incubated at 37°C for 1 h, after which VEGF\n165\n was added to a final concentration of 16 ng/mL After 18 h of incubation, 0.25 µCi of [\n3\nH]TdR (Amersham) was added to each well and incubated for an additional 4 h. The cells were washed once with PBS, trypsinized and harvested onto a glass filter (Printed Filtermat A, Walach) with a cell harvester (Harvester 96, MACH III, TOMTEC, Orange, CT). The membrane was washed three times with H\n2\nO and air-dried. Scintillation fluid was added and DNA incorporated radioactivity was determined on a scintillation counter (Wallach, Model 1450 Microbeta Scintillation Counter).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ability of human anti-KDR Fab to block VEGF-stimulated mitogenic activity on HUVEC is shown in \nFig. 4\n. All four human Fab fragments inhibited VEGF induced DNA synthesis in HUVEC in a dose-dependent manner. The Fab concentration that inhibited 50% (EC\n50\n) of VEGF-stimulated [\n3\nH]-TdR incorporation in HUVEC, is approximately 0.5 nM for clones D2C6 and D1H4, 0.8 nM for clone D2H2, and 15 nM for clone D1F7. Controls included VEGF only (1500 cpm) and plain medium (60 cpm). Duplicate wells were assayed. The data shown are representative of at least three separate experiments.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample II(e). \nLeukemia migration assay.\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nHL60 and HEL cells were washed three times with serum-free plain RPMI 1640 medium and suspended in the medium at 1 x 10\n6\n/m1. Aliquots of 100 µl cell suspension were added to either 3-µm-pore transwell inserts for HL60 cells, or 8-µm-pore transwell inserts for HEL cells (Costar®, Coming Incorporated, Corning, NY) and incubated with the anti-KDR Fab proteins (5 µg/ml) for 30 min at 37°C. The inserts were then placed into the wells of 24-well plates containing 0.5 ml of serum-free RPMI 1640 with or without VEGF\n165\n. The migration was carried out at 37°C, 5% CO\n2\n for 16-18 h for HL60 cells, or for 4 h for HEL cells. Migrated cells were collected from the lower compartments and counted with a Coulter counter (Model Z1, Coulter Electronics Ltd., Luton, England).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVEGF induced migration of HL60 and HEL cells in a dose-dependent manner with maximum stimulation achieved at 200 ng/ml (\nFig. 5A\n). All the anti-KDR Fab fragments significantly inhibited VEGF-stimulated migration of HL60 and HEL cells (\nFig. 5B\n). As a control, a Fab fragment of C225, an antibody directed against BGF receptor, did not show significant inhibitory effect in this assay.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample III. Production of IgG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample III(a). \nConstruction of vectors for expression of IgG.\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nSeparate vectors for expression of IgG light chain and heavy chains were constructed. Cloned V\nL\n genes were digested and ligated into the vector pKN100 (MRC. Cloned V\nH\n genes were digested and ligated into the vector pGID105 containing the human IgG I (γ) heavy chain constant domain. pKN100 and pGID105 are available from the MRC, Constructs were examined by restriction enzyme digestion and verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. In both cases, expression is under control of the HCMV promoter and terminated by an artificial termination sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe assembled heavy and light chain genes were then cloned into Lonza GS expression vectors pEE6.1 and pEE12.1. Heavy and light chain vectors were recombined into a single vectors for stable transfection of CHO cells and NSO cells. Transfected cells were cultured in glutamine minus medium and expressed antibodies at levels as high as 1g/L.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample III(b). \nProduction and characterization of human and-KDR IgG.\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nBoth IMC-2C6 and IMC-1121 were produced in stably transfected NS0 cell lines grown under serum-free conditions, and were purified from batch cell culture using Protein A affinity chromatography. The purity of the antibody preparations were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the concentrations were determined by ELISA, using an anti-human Fc antibody as the capturing agent and an anti-human κ chain antibody-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate as the detection agent A clinical grade antibody, IMC-C225, was used as the standard for calibration. The endotoxin level of each antibody preparations was examined to ensure the products were free of endotxin contamination.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-KDR antibodies were assessed for KDR binding and blocking of VBGF binding. In the direct binding assay, various amounts of antibodies were added to KDR-coated 96-well Maxi-sorp microtiter plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) and incubated at room temperature (RT) for 1 h, after which the plates were washed 3 times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20. The plates were then incubated at RT for 1 h with 100 µl of a rabbit anti-human IgG Fc-HRP conjugate (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory Inc., West Grove, PA). The plates were washed and developed as above. Human antibodies IMC-2C6 and IMC-1121 were compared with IMC-1C11 (a mouse antibody specific for KDR) and IMC-C225 a chimeric antibody specific for EGFR). The anti-KDR antibodies bind to KDR in a dose-dependent manner, with IMC-1121 being the strongest binder (\nFig. 6A\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe efficacy of the anti-KDR antibodies for blocking KDR from binding to VBGF was measured with a competition assay. Various amounts of antibodies were mixed with a fixed amount of KDR-AP (100 ng) and incubated at RT for 1 h. The mixtures were then transferred to 96-well microtiter plates precoated with VBQF\n165\n (200 ng/well) and incubated at RT for an additional 2 h, after which the plates were washed 5 times and the substrate for AP (p-nitrophanyl phosphate, Sigma) was added, followed by reading the absorbance at 405 nm to quantify the bound KDR-AP molecules. IC\n50\n, \ni.e.,\n the antibody concentration required for 50% inhibition of KDR binding to VEGF, was then calculated. The anti-KDR antibodies strongly blocked KDR from binding to VBGF (\nFig. 6B\n), with similar potency. The IC\n50\n is approximately 0.8 to 1.0 nM for all three antibodies. The control antibody, IMC-C225 (anti-human EGFR) does not bind KDR, and does not block KDR/VEGF interaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody affinity or avidity was determined by BIAcore analysis, as above. The binding kinetics, \ni.e\n., the association rate constant (\nkon\n) and the dissociation rate constant (\nkoff\n), of the anti-KDR antibodies were measured and the dissociation constant \nK\nd\n \n was calculated (Table 4).\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable 4 - Binding kinetics of anti-KDR antibodies\n \n \n \n \nAntibody\n \n \nkon\n (10\n4\n M\n-1\nS\n-1\n)\n \n \nkoff\n(10\n-4\nS\n-1\n)\n \nKd(nM)\n \n \n \n \nreference p1C11 scFv\n \n7.7±2.1*\n \n1.0±0.09\n \n1.4+0.3\n \n \n \nreference IMC-1C11\n \n13.4±2.9\n \n0.37±0.13\n \n0.27±0.06\n \n \n \nreference Hu-2C6 Fab\n \n17.1±5.7\n \n5.5±0.76\n \n3.6±1.7\n \n \n \nreference IMC-2C6 IgG\n \n21.2.±8.1\n \n0.43±0.03\n \n0.20±0.01\n \n \n \nHu-1121 Fab\n \n29.6±7.3\n \n0.31±0.06\n \n0.11±0.02\n \n \n \nIMC-1121 IgG\n \n47.9±2.4\n \n0.25±0.04\n \n0.05±0.01\n \n \n \n \n \n* All numbers are determined by BIAcora analysis and represent the mean ± SE from at least three separate determinations.\n \n \n \n \n\nIMC-1C11 binds to immobilized KDR with a dissociation constant (\nKd\n) of 0.27 nM, about 5-fold higher than its Fab counterpart. The \nKd\n for IMC-2C6 is 0.2 nM, which is about 18-fold higher than that of the monovalent Hu-2C6 Fab, mainly due to an improvement in the off-rate. Affinity maturation of Hu-2C6 led to Hu-1121 Fab with a 33-fold improvement in \nKd\n (from 3.6 nM to 0.11 nM). Converting Hu-1121 Fab into bivalent IgG, IMC-1121, resulted in about 2-fold increase in overall binding avidity.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample III(c). \nInhibition of VEGF binding to cells and VEGF-stimulated mitogenesis of HUVBC.\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn a cell-based radioimmunoassay, various amounts of anti-KDR antibodies were mixed with a fixed amount (2 ng) of \n125\nI labeled VEGF\n165\n (R & D Systems) and added to a 80-90% confluent monolayer of HUVEC grown in a 96-well microtiter plate. The plate was incubated at RT for 2 h, washed 5 times with cold PBS, and the amounts of radioactivity that bound to the endothelial cells were counted. As shown in \nFig. 7A\n, anti-KDR antibodies competed efficiency with radiolabeled VBGF for binding to HUVEC. The data represent the means ± SD for triplicate determinations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies also blocked VEGF-stimulated HUVEC mitogenesis in a dose-dependent manner (\nFig. 7B\n). As described above for Fabs, various amounts of the anti-KDR antibodies were first pre-incubated with growth factor-starved HUVEC (5 x 10\n3\n cells/well) at 37°C for 1 h, after which VEGF165 was added to a final concentration of 16 ng/ml. After 18 h of incubation, 0.25 µCi of [\n3\nH]-TdR (Amersham) was added to each well and incubated for an additional 4 h. The cells were washed, harvested, and DNA incorporated radioactivity was determined on a scintillation counter. IMC-1121, the antibody with the highest affinity, is the most efficacious inhibitor with an ED50, \ni.e\n., the concentration that results in 50% of inhibition of [\n3\nH]-TdR incorporation, of about 0.7 nM, in comparison to that of 1.5 nM for both IMC-1C11 and IMC-2C6.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample IV. Inhibition of Leukemian Cells and Leukemia Progression\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample IV(a). \nExpression of VEGF and BDR by leukemia cells.\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nWe examined VEGF and KDR expression, by RT-PCR, in three myeloid leukemia cell lines: HL60 (promyelocytic); HEL (megakaryocytic); and U937 (histiocytic). The following primers were used to amplify VEGF, Flt-1, KDR and the internal control, α-actin: VEGF forward: 5'-TCGGGCCTCCGAAACCATGA-3' (SEQ ID NO:86), and reverse: 5'-CCTGGTGAGAGATCTGGTTC-3' (SEQ ID NO:87); Flt-1 forward: 5'-TTTGTGATTTTGGCCTTGC-3' (SEQ ID NO:88), and reverse: 5'-CAGGCTCATGAACTTGAAAGC-3' (SEQ ID NO:89); KDR forward: 5'-GTGACCAACATGGAGTCGTG-3' (SEQ ID NO:90), and reverse: 5'-CCAGAGATTCCATGCCACTT-3' (SEQ ID NO:91); α-actin forward: 5'-TCATGTTTGAGACCTTCAA-3' (SEQ ID NO:92), and reverse: 5'-GTCTTTGCGGATGTCCACG-3' (SEQ ID NO:93). The PCR products were analyzed on a 1% agarose gel. As shown in \nFig. 8A\n, all three lines are positive for VEGF expression, and HL60 and HEL, but not U937, are also positive for KDR expression. The three cell lines are also positive for Flt-1 expression as detected by RT-PCT (not shown).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVEGF production was examined for the three leukemia cell lines cultured under either 10% FCS or serum-free conditions. The leukemia cells were collected, washed with plain RPMI 1640 medium and seeded in 24-well plates at density of 5 x 10\n5\n/ml, with or without the addition of 10% FCS. The cells were cultured at 37°C for 72 hr, after which total numbers of cells were counted using a Coulter counter (Model Z1, Coulter Electronics Ltd., Luton, England) and the VEGF concentration in the supernatant was determined using an ELISA kit (Biosource International, Camarillo, CA). The leukemia cells secrete significant amount of VEGF when cultured \nin vitro\n (\nFig. 8B\n), and both HL60 and U937 cells produced more VEGF under serum-starving conditions.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample IV(b). \nInhibition of VEGF-induced leukemia cell migration.\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nLeukemia cell migration assays, as described in Example \nII(e),\n were performed with the three leukemia cell lines. The migration was carried out for 16-18 h for HL60 cells, or for 4 h for HEL and U937 cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll three leukemia cell lines migrate in response to VEGF (\nFig. 9\n). Incubation with anti-KDR antibodies inhibited, in a dose-dependent manner, VEGF-induced migration of HL60 and HEL cells (\nFig. 9A and 9B\n), but had no effect on migration of U937 cells that does not express KDR (\nFig. 9C\n). The VEGF-induced migration of U937 cells was, however, efficiently inhibited by an anti-human Flt-1 antibody, Mab 612 (\nFig. 9C\n). As expected, the anti-EGFR antibody, IMC-C225, showed no effect on VEGF-induced migration of human leukemia cells.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample IV(b). \nInhibition of leukemia growth in vivo.\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n6 to 8-week-old sex-matched (female) NOD-SCID mice were used in all the experiments. The mice were irradiated with 3.5 Gy from a \n137\nCs gamma-ray source at a dose rate of about 0.9 Gy/min and intravenously inoculated with 2 x 10\n7\n HL60 cells. Three days after tumor inoculation, groups of 7 to 9 mice were treated twice weekly with various doses of IMC-1C11, IMC-2C6 or IMC-1121 antibodies via intraperitoneal injection. Mice were observed daily for signs of toxicity and recorded for time of survival. For statistical analysis, the non-parametric one-tailed Mann-Whitney Rank Sum test was used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll untreated mice died within 17 days (\nFig. 10\n, mean time of survival, 14 ± 3 days). At this high tumor load, treatment with IMC-1 C11 at 200 µg/mouse/injection moderately increased the survival but all mice died within 35 days (mean survival: 21 ± 7 days; median survival 19 days, respectively. p = 0.03 compared to the control group). IMC-2C6, given at the same dose of 200 µg/mouse/injection, significantly prolonged the mouse survival to 34 ± 12 days (median = 29 days. p < 0.01 compared to the control and p = 0.01 compared to the IMC-1C11-treated group). The antibody with the highest affinity, IMC-1121, demonstrated a much stronger anti-leukemia effect, particularly with respect to IMC- 1C11. The mice treated with IMC-1121 survived 63 ± 12 days (median = 60 days. p < 0.001 compared to both IMC-1C11 and IMC-2C6-treated groups). At a lower antibody dose tested (100 µg/mouse/injection), IMC-1121 was also more efficacious. Mice treated with the lower dose of IMC-1121 survived 46 ± 16 days (median = 41 days). No overt toxicities were observed in any of the antibody-treated animals throughout the course of the experiment.\n\n\n \nSEQUENCE LISTING\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n<110> ImClone Systems

No. 60/831,749, filed on Jul. 18, 2006, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety, including all figures, sequences and tables.\n\n\n \nGOVERNMENT SUPPORT\n\n\n \n \n \nThe subject matter of this application has been supported in part by U.S. Government Support under NIH GM66137 and NSF EF0304569. Accordingly, the U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nMolecular biomarkers are crucial for diagnosis of diseases and for predicting disease development. Potentially, some biomarkers can also be the targets of therapeutic agents for tumor-specific drug delivery in cancer treatments. Depending on the location, cancer markers can be present in the serum, such as the classic prostate-specific antigen (PSA) for prostate cancer (M. J. Barry, \nN. Engl. J. Med. \n344, 1373 (2001)), or expressed directly on cells, such as the Her-2 receptor in breast cancer tumors (S. M. Pupa, E. Tagliabue, S. Menard, A. Anichini, \nJ. Cell Physiol. \n205, 10 (2005)). While the serum biomarkers have the advantage of simplifying cancer diagnosis in the form of blood tests, the cellular markers can be indispensable for cancer cell detection, whole-body tumor imaging, and targeted drug delivery.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDespite the enormous research efforts in the development of cancer biomarkers, a very limited number of molecules have been identified as effective markers for tumors. In fact, the only molecule approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as tumor biomarker is PSA, which has been around for more than a decade (S. K. Chatterjee, B. R. Zetter, \nFuture Oncol. \n1, 37 (2005)). Previously, a biomarker would be considered ideal if it has high specificity, which means only the patients with the specific tumor will show the presence of the marker; and high sensitivity, which implies that most patients with such tumor should have this marker. However, it has been increasingly recognized that heterogeneity exists among individual patients, and even patients with the same type of cancer can have very different responses to cancer tests and therapies. This calls for personalized biomarkers to match the right patients for reliable cancer diagnosis and guided treatments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecent developments in biomarker discovery include genomic and proteomic approaches. The advances in DNA microarray technology have enabled mapping of gene expressions in tumor cells. By comparing to normal cells, differences in mRNA levels can be identified and linked to corresponding protein products, which form unique molecular signatures for the discovery of potential tumor markers. However, variants in the molecular signatures identified for similar biological systems have been observed among reports from different research groups (W. S. Dalton, S. H. Friend, \nScience \n312,1165 (2006)). The main reasons behind this are likely insufficient number of samples and non-standardized technology platforms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilarly, proteomic approaches, often involving separation of serum proteins or whole-cell protein content, coupled with mass spectrometry based protein identification, can directly elucidate differences in protein expressions between tumor and normal samples (E. F. Petricoin et al., \nLancet \n359, 572 (2002), G. Zhou et al., \nProteomics \n5, 3814 (2005)). Though powerful in identifying biomarkers at the whole genome or proteome level, both approaches require the development of additional molecular probes for the markers before clinical diagnosis can be benefited practically and economically. In fact, these probes are essential in many applications of biomarkers such as whole-body imaging for specific tumors and targeted drug delivery. It is noteworthy that while these methods have been used for biomarker discovery for some time, the number of biomarkers identified and widely accepted is still very limited.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn relation to the need for simpler, expedient methods for the discovery and development of disease-specific biomarkers, a need exists for cancer-specific molecular probes. Specifically, multiple cancer-specific molecular probes are needed to report unique fingerprints of the tumor cells, especially given the complexity and diversity of cancer diseases, even those cancers in the same category (Alizadeh A. A. et al. Distinct types of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma identified by gene expression profiling. \nNature \n403, 503-511 (2000)). Identification and understanding of the molecular basis of diseased cells assist in providing reliable approaches toward effective diagnosis and treatments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEven though many antibodies are available to recognize cellular markers, they were not intended for comprehensive recognition of molecular features of specific diseased cells, but rather individually developed at different times for various purposes. In fact, systematic production of a panel of antibodies for molecular differentiation of cancer cells is very difficult. For most diseases, there is a lack of reliable molecular probes that are specific enough to recognize subtle molecular differences among closely related diseases (Espina, V., Geho, D., Mehta, A. I., Petricoin, E. F. 3rd, Liotta, L. A., & Rosenblatt, K. P. (2005) \nCancer Invest. \n23, 36-46).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are molecular-level differences between any two given types of cells such as normal vs. tumor cells. How to find out these differences and then use these differences to produce a full understanding of the molecular basis of diseases is critically important in molecular medicine. Despite the variety of clinical parameters used to classify human malignancies today, patients receiving similar diagnosis can have markedly different clinical courses and responses to treatments. This is believed to be due to subtle differences among patients that are not detectable using current technologies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBehaviors of diseased cells are known to be originated from molecular compositions of the cells, and molecular heterogeneity within individual cancer diagnostic categories is already evident in complex genetic and proteomic alterations, thus differences at the molecular level should be used as a reliable way to differentiate cancer cells from normal cells, and even cancers in the same category. The profiling of these molecular characteristics should have a great potential in pinpointing cancer identity and providing personalized treatments. However, identification of molecular fingerprints of cancers remains extremely challenging, not to mention the development of corresponding molecular probes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCancers, as well as many other diseases, are originated from the mutations of human genes. As noted above, such genetic alterations result in not only different behaviors of the diseased cells, but also changes of the cells at the morphological and molecular levels. Traditionally, cancers are diagnosed mostly based on the morphology of tumor tissues or cells. However, these morphologic features are difficult to be used to carry out early cancer diagnosis, or to evaluate the complex molecular alterations that lead to cancer progression (Luo. J., Isaacs, W. B., Trent, J. M. & Duggan, D. J. (2003) \nCancer Invest. \n21, 937-949., Espina, V., Geho, D., Mehta, A. I., Petricoin, E. F. 3rd, Liotta, L. A., & Rosenblatt, K. P. (2005) \nCancer Invest. \n23, 36-46). Therefore, molecular characteristics, especially at the proteomic level, should be used to classify cancers because of the direct connection between genetic features and protein expression. Cancer diagnosis based on molecular features can be highly specific and extremely sensitive when incorporated with proper signal transduction and amplification mechanisms. Nonetheless, identification of molecular signatures of a particular cancer remains a great challenge if not impossible, which is reflected by the fact that very few biomarkers are available for effective cancer diagnosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCurrently, diagnosis of leukemia is commonly based on morphologic evaluation supplemented by immunophenotype analysis (Belov, L., dela Vega, O., dos Remedios, C. G., Mulligan, S. P. & Christopherson, R. Immunophenotyping of leukemias using a cluster of differentiation antibody microarray. \nCancer Res. \n61, 4483-4489 (2001)). The expression of CD antigens on leukocytes is determined by flow cytometry with monoclonal antibodies. However, these antigens are usually expressed on both neoplastic cells and normal hematopoietic cells, and could not accurately reflect the molecular features of the cancer cells. In fact, no panels of monoclonal antibodies are available to reliably distinguish tumor cells from their normal counterparts. This is due to the technical difficulties in systematic development of antibodies for unknown surface biomarkers. To understand the molecular basis of cancers, novel approaches are needed to systematically generate new probes recognizing molecular signatures of cancers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMolecular level differences are present between any two given types of cells, such as normal vs. tumor cells, \ntumor cell type\n 1 \nvs. type\n 2. These differences possess great significance in helping understand the biological processes and mechanisms of diseases. They could also be highly useful for disease diagnosis, prevention and therapy. However, identifying molecular differences between any two types of cells is not an easy task with current technologies. For example, discovery of unknown molecular features of diseased cells using molecular probes is almost impractical because, most of today's methodologies rely on known biomarkers for the development of corresponding molecular probes, which has been proved insufficient for addressing many emerging medical problems. Even if the molecular level differences can be identified, there is still a need to validate that the specific differences are indeed meaningful and vital for the desired biomedical property or the disease before any real clinical applications can be benefited.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecently, aptamers have been suggested as being suitable for use in developing probes having high affinity and selectivity for target molecules. Aptamers are single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), RNA, or modified nucleic acids. They have the ability to bind specifically to their targets, which range from small organic molecules to proteins (Osborne, S. E. & Ellington, A. D. (1997) \nChem. Rev. \n97, 349-370, Nutiu, R. & Li, Y. (2005) \nAngew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. \n44, 1061-1065, Wilson, D. S. & Szostak, J. W. (1999) \nAnnu. Rev. Biochem. \n68, 611-647). The basis for target recognition is the tertiary structures formed by the single-stranded oligonucleotides (Breaker, R. R. (2004) \nNature \n432, 838-845). Aptamers are obtained through an in vitro selection process known as SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential enrichment) (Ellington, A. D. & Szostak, J. W. (1990) \nNature \n346, 818-822, Tuerk, C. & Gold, L. (1990) \nScience \n249, 505-510), in which aptamers are selected from a library of random sequences of synthetic DNA or RNA by repetitive binding of the oligonucleotides to target molecules. Aptamers have had many important applications in bioanalysis, biomedicine and biotechnology (Fang, X., Sen, A., Vicens, M. & Tan, W. (2003) \n \nChemBioChem\n \n4, 829-834, Guo, K., Wendel, H. P., Scheideler, L., Ziemer, G. & Scheule, A. M. (2005) \nJ. Cell. Mol. Med. \n9, 731-736, Yang, C. J., Jockusch, S., Vicens, M., Turro, N. & Tan, W. (2005) \nProc. Natl. \n \nAcad Sci. USA\n \n \n102, 102, 17278-83, Liu, J. W. & Lu, Y. (2006) \nAngew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl \n45, 90-94).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSelection of aptamers is through a process termed SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) (A. D. Ellington, J. W. Szostak, \nNature \n355, 850 (1992)). Targets of aptamers are usually pure molecules such as proteins and small molecules. Recently, more complex biological species, such as red blood cells membrane and single protein on live trypanosomes, were also used as the targets in SELEX (B. J. Hicke et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n276, 48644 (2001), D. A. Daniels, H. Chen, B. J. Hicke, K. M. Swiderek, L. Gold, \nPro Natl Acad Sci. USA. \n100, 15416 (2003), C. Wang et al., \nJ. Biotechnol. \n102, 15 (2003), K. N. Morris, K. B. Jensen, C. M. Julin, M. Weil, L. Gold, \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA., \n95, 2902 (1998), M. Homann, H. U. Goringer, \nNucleic Acids Res., \n27, 2006 (1999), M. Blank, T. Weinschenk, M. Priemer, H. Schluesener, \nJ. Bio. Chem., \n276,16464 (2001)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMost aptamers reported so far have been selected using simple targets, such as a purified protein. Recently, aptamer-selection against complex targets, such as red blood cell membranes and endothelial cells, was also demonstrated (Morris, K. N. Jensen, K. B., Julin, C. M., Weil, M. & Gold, L. (1998) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n95, 2902, Blank, M., Weinschenk, T., Priemer, M., & Schluesener, H. (2001) \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n276, 16464-16468, Daniels, D. A., Chen, H., Hicke, B. J., Swiderek, K. M. & Gold, L. (2003) \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA. \n100, 15416-21, Wang, C., Zhang, M., Yang, G., Zhang, D., Ding, H., Wang, H., Fan, M., Shen, B., & Shao, N. (2003) \nJ. Biotechnol. \n102, 15-22). Compared to molecular probes currently available for biomarker recognition, aptamers are emerging candidates with ample potential due to their high specificity, low molecular weight, easy and reproducible production, versatility in application, and easy discovery and manipulation (Jayasena, S. D. (1999) \nClin. Chem. \n45, 1628-1650). Currently the application of aptamers towards medical research and application is limited due to the lack of aptamers for systems of medical relevance.\n\n\n \nBRIEF SUMMARY\n\n\n \n \n \nThe subject invention provides methods for identifying cell biomarkers using highly specific and/or selective oligonucleotide ligands. The subject invention also discloses methods for producing such oligonucleotide ligands for use in identifying cell biomarkers. In certain related embodiments, the ligands are derived from an in vitro evolution process called SELEX (Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) and can be synthesized in large scale by DNA synthesizer easily. Biomarkers of interest are subsequently captured in cell lysate by these oligonucleotide ligands, which are bound to a biotin-tag, and the resultant complexes are easily immobilized on a magnetic solid support using streptavidin coated magnetic beads.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to the subject invention, the biomarkers discovered by this method are highly specific markers for certain cancer cells. They can be used as diagnosis reagents for all kinds of diseases, as targets for drug discovery, and as reagents for scientific research. Further, such biomarkers can be used in bioassays for diagnosis, therapeutically agents, the new discovery of diseases; etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn related embodiments, DNA aptamers are developed directly from tumor cells to function as highly specific and selective probes. These probes are tagged with biotin and subsequently bound to surface targets of leukemia cells to facilitate the discovery of potential new biomarkers via magnetic strategies. In certain embodiments, aptamers highly specific for a T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cell line are selected in accordance with the subject invention. Such T-ALL-aptamers have high affinity and excellent specificity. These molecular probes were utilized with magnetic strategies (biotin-labeling, streptavidin coated magnetic beads, and magnetic support stand) to capture and purify cancer cell membrane targets for the identification of disease biomarkers. Using the disclosed methods, a trans-membrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase 7 (PTK7) was identified to be the target of a T-ALL specific aptamer. The finding of high expression of PTK7 on T-ALL cells and the simultaneous development of an excellent aptamer probe for it assists in practical and reliable diagnosis of related leukemia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, a novel strategy for preparing highly specific and selective molecular probes to a biomarker on a cell membrane is provided. In contrast to the conventional concept of biomarker/molecular probe discovery that requires prior knowledge regarding the target biomarker, the molecular probes of the subject invention are generated without any prior knowledge of possible biomarkers. The rationale behind this strategy is that molecular differences exist between any two given types of cells. Finding these differences generates personalized cell-specific molecular signatures for effective disease diagnosis and therapy as well as basic studies. Moreover, the resultant probes of the invention are highly useful for biomarker discovery as the specific binding sites for these molecules must be disease specific, generating the opportunity for biomarker elucidation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a related embodiment, the present invention provides a cell-based strategy (cell-SELEX) that generates a group of aptamers (designer DNA/RNA probes) that can specifically recognize an individual cancer cell type, without having prior knowledge about the cancer biomarker. These probes are then utilized to facilitate extraction, purification, and identification of the membrane biomarkers on the cancer cells. The identification of the membrane targets is realized through magnetized collection and separation and analysis via routine affinity chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Upon discovery of the cancer-specific biomarkers of the invention, aptamer probes (or antibodies) are generated for the recognition of these biomarkers for diagnosis of the corresponding disease, which greatly expedites the clinical application of the newly discovered biomarkers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the subject application, a group of new aptamers are provided for the recognition of minute molecular differences among leukemia patient samples. An easy and fast cell-based selection was used to evolve aptamers directly from leukemia cell lines. The selected aptamers have high affinity and specificity for the target cells, and can recognize closely related cells from real patient samples. Binding of the aptamers to the clinical samples formed distinct patterns. Leukemia patients pre-determined by antibodies to be in the same category were found to be different based on the aptamer-recognition profiles. Because of the direct connection between aptamer binding and cell surface target expression, the aptamers provided solid evidences of subtle molecular differences between closely related diseased cells. These subtle differences would be essential for not only accurate disease diagnosis, but also efficient personalized therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention described below provides each of these advantages, among others, which will be apparent to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n\n \n \n \nThe file of this patent contains at least one drawing executed in color.

The methods of the invention use highly specific and/or selective biotin-labeled oligonucleotide ligands in combination with magnetic strategies for isolating and identifying biomarkers of interest. Specific magnetic strategies include the use of streptavidin coated magnetic beads that would bind to the biotin-labeled oligonucleotide ligands and magnetic support for collecting the magnetically-bound comlexes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the oligonucleotide ligands are firstly generated by whole-cell based SELEX technique. Such ligands can recognize target cells with high affinity and specificity and can distinguish cells that are closely related to target cells even in patient samples. The targets of these oligonucleotide ligands are significant biomarkers for certain cells. These important biomarkers are captured by forming complexes with biotin-labeled oligonucleotide ligands and collecting the complexes using magnetic streptavidin beads, whereupon the captured biomarkers are analyzed to identify the biomarkers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalysis of biomarkers include HPLC-Mass Spectroscopy analysis, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, flow cytometry, and the like. The identified biomarkers can be used for pathological diagnosis and therapeutic applications. Using the disclosed methods, highly specific biomarkers of any kinds of cells, in particular cancer cells, can easily be identified without prior knowledge of the existence of such biomarkers.\n\n\n \nBiomarker Identification and Development\n\n\n \n \n \nUsing cell-based aptamer selection (Cell-SELEX), a novel strategy for identifying biomarkers is presented which utilizes the differences at the molecular level between any two types of cells for the identification of molecular signatures on the surface of targeted cells. In certain specific embodiments, a group of aptamers has been generated for the specific recognition of leukemia cells. The selected aptamers can bind to target cells with an equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) in the nM to pM range. The cell-based selection process is simple, fast, straightforward and reproducible, and, most importantly, can be done without prior knowledge of target molecules. The selected aptamers can specifically recognize target leukemia cells mixed with normal human bone marrow aspirates, and can also identify cancer cells closely related to the target cell line in real clinical specimens. The cell-based aptamer selection holds a great promise in developing specific molecular probes for cancer diagnosis and cancer biomarker discovery.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo find cancer-specific cell membrane biomarkers, a modified SELEX method was used to generate aptamers against whole leukemia cells. Briefly, a T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cell line CCRF-CEM was incubated with a DNA library containing around 10\n15 \nsingle-stranded random DNA sequences (D. Shangguan et al., \nProc. Natl. \nAcari Sci. USA\n \n103, (2006)). Sequences bound to the target cells were collected while the unbound sequences were washed away. The collected sequences then went through a counter-selection process where they were incubated with a control cell line (Ramos, a B-cell lymphoma cell line). Following that, the unbound DNAs were eluted and PCR amplified to form a new DNA pool. The counter-selection step is designed to make sure only the sequences that bind to the target cells but not the control cells will be enriched. The new DNA pool, with a better affinity for the target cells than the initial library, was incubated with the target cells again to start a new cycle of selection and counter-selection. This process was repeated for up to 20 cycles until a DNA pool with high affinity and good selectivity for the target cells was obtained.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProgress of the enrichment of the aptamer candidates was monitored using both flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. The final DNA pool was sequenced and a panel of aptamer sequences were determined. One of the aptamers with the highest affinity and specificity for the CCRF-CEM leukemia cells was named sgc8. Sgc8 was tested on normal bone marrow cell and a variety of Hematopoietic cancer cells including patient samples. Most of the leukemia cells closely related to the CCRF-CEM cells showed significant sgc8 binding, while almost all of the lymphoma cells and cells in normal bone marrow had negligible fluorescence from dye-labeled sgc8 (data not shown). This level of selectivity clearly indicates the presence of a highly specific molecular marker on the membrane of these leukemia cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following example illustrates a procedure for practicing the invention. This example should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention in any way. All percentages are by weight and all solvent mixture proportions are by volume unless otherwise noted.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 1 \n\n\nMaterials\n\n\nCell Lines and Reagents\n\n\n \n \n \nCCRF-CEM (CCL-119, T-cell lines, human acute lymphoblastic leukemia), Ramos, (CRL-1596, B-cell line, human Burkitt's lymphoma), Toledo (CRL-2631, B-cell line, human diffuse large cell lymphoma), Sup-T1(CRL-1942, T-cell lines, human lymphoblastic leukemia), Jurkat (TIB-152, human acute T cell leukemia), Molt-4 (CRL-1582, T-cell lines, human acute lymphoblastic leukemia), were obtained from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection). NB-4 (acute promyelocytic leukemia) was obtained from the Department of Pathology, University of Florida). All the cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (ATCC) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (heat inactivated, GIBCO) and 100 IU/mL penicillin-Streptomycin (Cellgro). Cells were washed before and after incubation with wash buffer (4.5 g/L glucose and 5 mM MgCl\n2 \nin Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline with calcium chloride and magnesium chloride (Sigma)). Binding buffer used for selection was prepared by adding yeast tRNA (0.1 mg/mL) (Sigma) and BSA (1 mg/mL) (Fisher) into wash buffer to reduce background binding. Monoclonal anti-PTK7 antibody conjugated to R-phycocrythrin (PE) was purchased from Miltenyi Biotec Inc (Auburn, Calif., USA). Magnetic streptavidin beads were purchased from Dynal biotech ASA (Oslo, Norway). \nHomo sapiens \nPTK7 transcript variant PTK7-1 transfection-ready DNA was purchased from OriGene Technologies, Inc (Rockville, Md., USA). Cell Line Nucleofector Kit V was purchased from Amaxa Inc (Gaithersburg, Md., USA).\n\n\n \nOligodeoxynucleotide Probe Synthesis\n\n\n \n \n \nBiotin-Rb1 (B-TACCCCTTTAATCCCAAACCC (SEQ ID NO:3), B denotes biotin), a non binding sequence, Biotin-sgc8c (Biotin-S-S-S-S-ATCTAACTGCTGCGCCGCCGGGAAAATACTGTACGGTTAGA (SEQ ID NO:4), S denotes an 18-atom ethylene glycol spacer), and Biotin-sgc3b (Biotin-S-S-ACTTATTCAATTCCTGTGGGAAGGCTATAGAGGGGCCAGTCTATGAATAAG) (SEQ ID NO:5) were synthesized according to the standard phosphoramidite chemistry on an ABI 3400 synthesizer. Oligonucleotide building blocks were obtained from Glen Research Corporation (Virginia, USA). Purification was performed twice for each oligonucleotide using RP-HPLC with the DMT-on mode on a Varian HPLC system.\n\n\n \nBiomarker Purification and Identification\n\n\n \n \n \n4×10\n8 \nCCRF-CEM cells were washed three times at 4° C. with PBS buffer, and lysed in 5 mL of hypotonic buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitors (0.1 mM PMSF, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin)] at 4° C. for 30 min. After centrifugation, the debris were washed with 5 ml of hypotonic buffer for 3 times and dissolved in 1.5 mL of lysis buffer (PBS containing 5 mM MgCl\n2 \nand 1% Triton X-100) at 4° C. for 30 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with 150 pmole non-binding sequences Biotin-Rb1 in the presence of 1000-fold excess of 88mer random DNA sequence library (150 nmol) as a nonspecific competitor at 4° C. for 30 min, the protein-DNA complex was captured by incubating with 2 mg (200 μl) magnetic streptavidin beads at 4° C. for 15 min, and collected on a magnet stand. The resulting supernatant was incubated with 150 pmole Biotin-sgc8c at 4° C. for 30 min, and the protein-sgc8c complex was captured by incubating with 2 mg (200 μl) magnetic streptavidin beads at 4° C. for 15 min and collected on a magnet stand. The resulting supernatant was incubated with 150 pmole Biotin-sgc3b at 4° C. for 30 min, the protein-sgc3b complex was captured by incubating with 2 mg (200 μl) \nmagnetic streptavidin beads\n 4° C. for 15 min, and collected on a magnet stand. The collected magnetic beads were washed with 1 ml PBS containing 5 mM MgCl\n2 \nfor 4 times. The proteins was eluted by heating in 30 μl loading buffer and analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) stained with Colloidal Blue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe aptamer-purified protein bands were excised and digested in situ, and analyzed by QSTAR LC-MS/MS and MASCOT® database search at the Protein Chemistry Core Facility, University of Florida.\n\n\n \nFlow Cytometric Analyses\n\n\n \n \n \n5×10\n5 \ncells were incubated with excess anti-PTK7-PE and/or 200 nM FITC-labeled aptamer sgc8 in 200 μL of binding buffer (PBS containing 5 mM MgCl\n2\n, 4.5 g/L glucose, 0.1 mg/mL yeast tRNA, 1 mg/mL BSA and 20% FBS) on ice for 30 min. Cells were washed twice with 0.7 ml of binding buffer (with 0.1% NaN\n2\n), and suspended in 0.3 ml of binding buffer (with 0.1% NaN\n2\n). The fluorescence was determined with a FACScan cytometer (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, Calif.) and 30000 events were measured for each cell sample. The FITC-labeled un-enriched ssDNA library and PE-labeled IgG were used as negative controls.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor competition experiments, 5×10\n5 \ncells were incubated with 2 μM unlabeled sgc8 in binding buffer on ice for 20 min, then anti-PTK7-PE was added and incubated for 30 min. After wash, the fluorescence of anti-PTK7-PE was determined with a FACScan cytometer and compared with that without the addition of sgc8.\n\n\n \nPTK7 Gene Transfection\n\n\n \n \n \n2-4 μg of plasmid DNA containing full length cDNA of PTK7 (Vector: pCMV6-XL4) was transfected into 2×10\n6 \nRamos and Toledo cells following the protocols of Cell Line Nucleofector Kit V. Positive control with vector pmaxGFP and 2 negative controls were used to assess the transfection efficiency. The transfected cells were analyzed by flow cytometry after 20 hour.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe target of sgc8 was previously proven to be a membrane protein since the CEM cells completely lost binding to sgc8 after being treated with trypsin or proteinase K (D. Shangguan et al., \nProc. Natl. \nAcad. Sci. USA\n \n103, (2006)), although the identity of the biomarker was still unknown. Following that, efforts were carried out to identify the target of sgc8 as provided in Example 1 above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs described in detail above, CEM cells were lysed and the membrane content was dissolved in PBS buffer containing surfactant. An optimized and truncated DNA sequence of sgc8, sgc8c, which had identical binding properties as sgc8, was previously labeled with a biotin tag at the 5′-end and incubated with the solubilized membrane proteins. The binding complex of sgc8 and its target was then extracted using streptavidin coated magnetic beads. After wash, the streptavidin beads, along with the captured proteins, were heated in the loading buffer of SDS-PAGE and the eluted proteins underwent subsequent separation by SDS-PAGE (\nFIG. 4\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy comparing to control experiments, characteristic protein bands on the gel captured by sgc8 were digested and supplied to LC-MS/MS QSTAR analysis. MASCOT® database search was used to assign possible protein candidates to the MS results. Among the list of protein hits, PTK7-5 (an isoform of protein tyrosine kinase 7) received most attention because of several reasons.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFirst, it is a transmembrane receptor. Second, the size of the PTK7 (118 kD) correlates very well with the molecular weight obtained from the protein band on the SDS-PAGE gel. Also known as colon carcinoma kinase-4 (CCK-4), PTK7 was reported to have an increased expression level in metastatic colon carcinoma (K. Mossie et al., \nOncogene \n11, 2179 (1995)). It was also found to play a role in regulating planar cell polarity in vertebrates (X. Lu et al., \nNature \n430, 93 (2004)). PTK7 is believed to be important in the signaling mechanism during cancer development and metastasis (J. W. Jung, W. S. Shin, J. Song, S. T. Lee, \nGene \n328, 75 (2004)). However, its exact function is not clear, and there are no reports that have linked PTK7 over-expression to T-ALL cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe presence of PTK7 on the CEM cells was first confirmed using the anti-PTK7 antibody labeled with a phycoerythrin (PE) dye (\nFIG. 1\n). To evaluate the interaction between sgc8 and PTK7, excess unlabeled sgc8 was used to compete with anti-PTK7-PE for CEM cell binding. Interestingly, flow cytometry results showed no obvious change in anti-PTK7-PE binding (\nFIG. 5\n), indicating there was no competition between sgc8 and anti-PTK7. To further investigate the possibility of co-binding of sgc8 and the antibody on PTK7, the aptamer was labeled with a FITC fluorophore and incubated with CEM cells along with anti-PTK7-PE. A flow cytometry analysis of the cells was then conducted and the resultant dot plot is shown in \nFIG. 1\n. Fluorescence signals from the FITC and PE channels displayed a linear relationship. An immediate fact drawn from the linearity is that cells with higher PTK7 expression also have better binding to sgc8. A possible explanation would be that sgc8-FITC and anti-PTK7-PE can bind to two different sites of the extracellular domain of PTK7 simultaneously, or sgc8-FITC can bind to a molecule that is tightly associated with. PTK7.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nControl experiments were performed by exchanging anti-PTK7-PE or sgc8-FITC with a different antibody or aptamer, or using a different cell line. In any of these cases, the linearity was not seen (\nFIG. 1\n). On the other hand, a few cell lines previously tested to have sgc8 binding gave a very similar linear relationship between FITC and PE signals from sgc8 and anti-PTK7 respectively (\nFIG. 2\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional experiments were performed to confirm the target of sgc8. The Ramos cells, which did not show any binding to sgc8 as shown in \nFIG. 3\n, were transfected with cDNA of PTK7-1. The transfected Ramos cells were tested with FITC-labeled sgc8 and anti-PTK7-PE by flow cytometry (\nFIG. 3\n). About 10% of the Ramos cells were found to express PTK7 after transfection. The transfection also resulted in sgc8 binding of the cells and a very similar linear relationship between FITC and PE signals as previously seen on CEM cells. Another cell line, Toledo cells, which had no interaction with sgc8, was subject to the same transfection procedures, and gave similar results as for Ramos cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrevious results with clinical patient samples revealed considerable levels of specific sgc8 binding to leukemia cells closely related to CCRF-CEM cells. Other reports also demonstrated that PTK7 was highly expressed on acute myeloid leukemia samples (C. Muller-Tidow et al., \nClin. Cancer Res. \n10, 1241 (2004)). Therefore, a link between PTK7 over-expression and leukemia is clearly implied. Discovery of a commonly up-regulated molecular marker on these cells and the development of an excellent aptamer probe for it may lead to effective and reliable diagnosis, as well as cell-specific delivery of therapeutic agents. Previously, a biomarker would be considered ideal if it has high specificity, which means only the patients with the specific tumor will show the presence of the marker; and high sensitivity, which implies that most patients with such tumor should have this marker. However, it has been increasingly recognized that heterogeneity exists among individual patients, and even patients with the same type of cancer can have very different responses to cancer tests and therapies. This calls for personalized biomarkers to match the right patients for reliable cancer diagnosis and guided treatments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe strategy of the present invention provides a simple way to achieve discovery of personalized biomarkers that are specific for cells from one patient, thus facilitating the on-going efforts toward personalized medicine. Instead of trying to elucidate all possible molecular fingerprints of whole cells, the cell-SELEX based approach focuses on finding highly expressed molecular differences on cell membranes, which could result in a significantly improved efficiency for the identification of clinically practical biomarkers. In addition, the integration of probe selection and biomarker discovery reduces the time gap between laboratory results and clinical application.\n\n\n \nProbe Development\n\n\n \n \n \nThe most significant advantage of the present invention's methods for producing highly specific and/or selective probes is that the resultant probes recognize subtle molecular level differences among targets in their native state without prior knowledge about disease biomarkers. In certain embodiments, aptamer probes are generated using a modified cell-based SELEX selection process (referred to herein as the cell-SELEX process). Instead of using single molecular target, the cell-SELEX process uses whole cells as targets to select aptamers that can distinguish target cells from control cells (see \nFIG. 6\n). A counter-selection strategy is employed to isolate DNA sequences that only interact with the target cells but not the control cells. Through this process, a group of cell-specific aptamers can be selected in a relatively short period (4-6 weeks) without knowing which target molecules are present on the cell surface and without knowing which target molecules might play the most important role in cancer development.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrior to the subject invention, there was no easy way to produce molecular probes in such a short time for an unknown target. In most diseases, the differences at the molecular level are not readily apparent or the problem is just too complicated to use one or a few biomarkers for the identification of a disease. The subject cell-SELEX process for producing personalized molecular probes generates molecular probes that are able to recognize the native states of multiple biomarkers, generating a molecular level understanding of diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with the methods described herein, many aptamers with high affinity and specificity for the molecular features on the membrane of the cancer cells were obtained, six of them are listed in Table 1.

The binding assays with the cells were conducted in a flow cytometer.

Subpopulations of bone marrow cells were identified in the flow cytometer by their side scatter properties and the expression levels of CD45, CD7, CD10, CD19 and CD45 reported by corresponding antibodies. The following cell types were identified: mature B cells, immature B-cells, CD3(+) T-cells, lymphocytes, monocytes, granulocytes, nucleated erythrocytes and early precursors (blast region).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in Table 2 below, aptamer sgd5 only recognized its target cells and a few B-cell lines. All of the cultured T-cell leukemia cell lines were identified by all aptamers except sgd5 with relatively high fluorescence intensity, which was expected as they were selected from a T-cell leukemia cell line. Aptamers sgc8, sgc3, sgd3, sgd5 had almost no binding to either the normal hematopoietic cells in the human bone marrow samples or most B-cells, showing good selectivity toward T-cells. Further inspection showed that aptamers sgc4 and sgd2 were able to recognize many different cell samples including most B-cell lines and some bone marrow cells, indicating the presence of common binding entities on these cells. Combination of the selected aptamers has constructed distinct patterns for different tumor cells, revealing the potential of using aptamers to define molecular signatures of tumors.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAptamers binding to cultured cells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nsgc8\n\n\nsgc3\n\n\nsgc4\n\n\nsgd2\n\n\nsgd3\n\n\nsgd5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT-cell\n\n\nCCRF-CEM, Pre T ALL\n\n\n+++\n\n\n++\n\n\n++++\n\n\n++++\n\n\n++\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nleukemia\n\n\nMolt-4, pre T ALL\n\n\n++++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n++++\n\n\n++++\n\n\n++++\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSup-T1, Pre-T ALL.\n\n\n++++\n\n\n+\n\n\n++++\n\n\n++++\n\n\n++\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nJurkat, Pre-T ALL\n\n\n++++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n++++\n\n\n++++\n\n\n++++\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB-cell\n\n\nSUP-B15, pre-B ALL, Ph+\n\n\n+\n\n\n0\n\n\n++\n\n\n+\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nleukemia\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB-cell\n\n\nU266, plasmacytoma\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmyeloma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB-cell\n\n\nRamos, Burkitt lymphoma\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n++++\n\n\n++++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlymphoma\n\n\nToledo, Diffuse large B cell lymphoma\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n++++\n\n\n++++\n\n\n+\n\n\n++\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFollicular large B cell lymphoma\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n+\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMo2058, Mantle cell lymphoma\n\n\n0\n\n\n++\n\n\n++\n\n\n0\n\n\n+\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAML\n\n\nNB-4 (APL)\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n+++\n\n\n++++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nKasumi-1\n\n\n++\n\n\n0\n\n\n++++\n\n\n++++\n\n\n+\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBone\n\n\nCD3 (+) T cells\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmarrow\n\n\nmature B cells\na\n \n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nImmature B cells\nb\n \n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n+\n\n\n+\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGranulocytes\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMonocytes\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n+\n\n\n+\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nErythrocytes\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n++\n\n\n++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBlast\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n+\n\n\n+\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n++++: >85%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+++: 60-85%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n++: 35-60%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+: 10-35%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0: <10%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAML: acute myeloid leukemia; ALL: acute lymphoblastic leukemia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the flow cytometry analysis, a threshold based on fluorescence intensity of FITC was chosen so that 99 percent of cells incubated with the FITC-labeled unselected DNA library would have fluorescence intensity below it.

The results, shown in Table 3 below, clearly demonstrate an effective detection of targets on the cell membranes in patient samples by the selected aptamers. This recognition was not due to non-specific interactions or random binding. All the lymphoma cases showed no or very low binding, in agreement with the fact that the mature lymphoma cells often do not share the same receptors with the immature leukemia cells. Moreover, the aptamers obviously had much stronger binding with the T-ALL cases than others did as expected since the aptamers were selected for the CCRF-CEM cells, a T-ALL cell line. Aptamer binding patterns corresponded well with general categories pre-defined by antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCells from cancer patients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatient's samples\n\n\nsgc8\n\n\nsgc3\n\n\nsgc4\n\n\nsgd2\n\n\nsgd3\n\n\nsgd5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT-ALL (T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT ALL 1\n\n\n++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT ALL 2\n\n\n++\n\n\n+\n\n\n+++\n\n\n++\n\n\n+\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT ALL 3\n\n\n+\n\n\n+\n\n\n++++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT ALL 4\n\n\n+\n\n\n+\n\n\n++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT ALL 5\n\n\n+\n\n\n+\n\n\n++\n\n\n+\n\n\n+\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT ALL 6\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n+\n\n\n+\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT ALL 7\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n++\n\n\n++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB-ALL (B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB ALL 1\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n++\n\n\n++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB ALL 2\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n++\n\n\n++\n\n\n0\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB ALL 3\n\n\n++\n\n\n0\n\n\n++\n\n\n++\n\n\n0\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAML (acute myeloid leukemia)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAML 1\n\n\n+\n\n\n+\n\n\n++\n\n\n+\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAML 2\n\n\n+\n\n\n0\n\n\n++\n\n\n+\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAML 3\n\n\n+\n\n\n0\n\n\n+\n\n\n+\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAML 4\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n++++\n\n\n++++\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAML 5\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n+\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAML 6\n\n\n+\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOthers clinical samples\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1, T-cell lymphoma\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\nND\n\n\nND\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2, follicular\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlymphoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3, B-cell lymphoma\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4, T-cell\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlymphoma,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5, B cell lymphoma\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6, plasma cell\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n+\n\n\n+\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nneoplasm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the flow cytometry analysis, a threshold based on fluorescence intensity of FITC was chosen so that 99 percent of cells incubated with the FITC-labeled unselected DNA library would have fluorescence intensity below it.

While there is no clear explanation for such differences presently, they precisely reflect the complex nature of the disease. In addition to general categorization of the leukemia defined by antibodies, the aptamer analyses were able to provide extra and valuable information as the direct evidence for the subtle molecular differences among the same type of cancers. It is well known that diseases of the same category could have very different responses to specific treatments (Alizadeh A. A. et al. Distinct types of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma identified by gene expression profiling. \nNature \n403, 503-511 (2000), Espina, V., Geho, D., Mehta, A. I., Petricoin, E. F. 3rd, Liotta, L. A., & Rosenblatt, K. P. (2005) \nCancer Invest. \n23, 36-46), but rarely confirmation at the molecular level was offered to classify such dissimilarities. This is partially due to the difficulties in generating effective probes for molecular signatures of diseases using current technologies. In contrast, the cell-SELEX process of the subject invention produces a panel of aptamers quickly and at low cost even when there is no information about disease biomarkers. The resulting aptamers can be used successfully in differentiating closely related cancers. The production of a similar panel of antibodies is almost impossible.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAptamers directly evolved from tumor cells in accordance with the subject invention can effectively detect various diseases, including leukemia, in patient samples, and even recognize the subtle molecular level differences among (leukemia) patients. The results of experiments conducted to that effect, as seen in Example 2, offer clear evidence that cell-based aptamer selection can be a valuable approach for generating aptamer probes to obtain molecular signature of individual patient samples, forming the foundation for personalized medicine and leading to early diagnosis and highly effective therapy with minimum side effects. Combined with features of aptamers such as chemical-synthesis-based production, low molecular weight, easy modification and long-term stability, the cell-SELEX process of the present invention provides a promising solution for many challenges facing modern medicine. The selected aptamers can also be employed to isolate the disease-specific protein targets to facilitate discovery of clinically important cellular biomarkers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following example illustrates a procedure for practicing the invention. This example should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention in any way. All percentages are by weight and all solvent mixture proportions are by volume unless otherwise noted.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 2 \n\n\nCell-SELEX:\n\n\n \n \n \nCell-based SELEX procedure (Aptamer selection): The cell-SELEX procedure is schematically shown in \nFIG. 6\n. Synthesized ssDNA library was incubated with target cells. After washing, the bound DNAs were eluted by heating. The collected DNAs were then incubated with negative cells for counter-selection in order to remove the sequences binding to coexisting molecules on both cells. After centrifugation, the supernatant was collected and the selected DNA pool was amplified by PCR. The PCR products were separated into ssDNAs for next round selection. After the DNA pool reached certain cell-binding affinity, the enriched pool was cloned and sequenced. Aptamers were identified from the sequenced pool. These aptamers have Kd in the range of nM to pM: sgc3: 1.97 nM, sgc4: 26.6 nM, sgc8: 0.8 nM, sgd2: 7.2 nM, sgd3: 3.58 nm, and sgd5: 70.8 nM. Aptamer sgd5 was selected from Toledo cells, a human diffuse large B cell lymphoma cell line. All the other aptamers were from CCRF-CEM cells, a human precursor T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line.\n\n\n \nCell Lines.\n\n\n \n \n \nCCRF-CEM (CCL-119, T-cell lines, human acute lymphoblastic leukemia), Ramos, (CRL-1596. B-cell line, human Burkitt's lymphoma), Toledo (CRL-2631, B-cell line, human diffuse large cell lymphoma), Jurkat (TIB-152, human acute T cell leukemia), Molt-4 (CRL-1582, T-cell lines, human acute lymphoblastic leukemia), Sup-T1 (CRL-1942, T-cell lines, human lymphoblastic leukemia), U266 (TIB-196, B-lymphocyte, human myeloma, plasmacytoma), SUP-B15 (CRL-1929, B-lymphoblast, human acute lymphoblastic leukemia) were obtained from ATCC. All the cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (ATCC) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (BSA) (heat inactivated, GIBCO) and 100 IU/mL penicillin-Streptomycin (Cellgro).\n\n\n \nFlow Cytometry Profiling of Leukemia Cells.\n\n\n \n \n \nFITC labeled aptamers were mixed with PE or PerCP labeled antibodies of CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, CD10, CD19, and CD45 respectively, and incubated with 5×10\n5 \nCCRF-CEM cells and/or 5×10\n5 \ncells in human bone marrow aspirates in 200 μL binding buffer (Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline with calcium chloride, magnesium chloride 4.5 g/L glucose, yeast tRNA (0.1 mg/mL) and BSA (1 mg/mL)) for 50 min. Cells were washed twice with 0.7 ml of binding buffer (with 0.1% NaN2), and suspended in 0.4 ml of binding buffer (with 0.1% NaN2). The fluorescence was determined with a FACScan cytometer (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry systems, San Jose, Calif.) by counting 30000 or 100000 events. The FITC-labeled unselected ssDNA library was used as negative control. A threshold gate based on fluorescence intensity of FITC was set such that 99 percent of negative control cells are below it. The results were expressed as the percentage of cells stained by aptamers with FITC fluorescence above the threshold. Table 2 shows the results of using the aptamers to profile different leukemia cell lines.\n\n\n \nFlow Cytometry Profiling of Patient Samples.\n\n\n \n \n \nFresh human lymphoid tissues, bone marrow and peripheral blood samples were from the Hematopathology service, the Department of pathology, University of Florida. Tissue cell suspensions were prepared by mincing the tissue with scalpels in RPMI media, and filtering through a wire mesh screen (#80 mesh). Erythrocytes in the peripheral blood and bone marrow cell suspensions were lysed with ammonium chloride lysing solution (BD Biosciences) for 10 min at room temperature at a volume ratio of 1:9 (sample:lysing) solution. After incubation, cells were pelleted by centri fugation (500 g for 5 min at room temperature). The cells were washed twice in a PBS solution containing 0.1% NaN3, and then resuspended in RPMI medium with 10% FCS and antibiotics. These cells were incubated with aptamers and analyzed by flow cytometry as described above.\n\n\n \nCell-SELEX for Enrichment of Apatmer Candidates for Target Cells.\n\n\n \n \n \nThe process of the subject cell-SELEX is illustrated in \nFIG. 7\n, and the detailed procedures are provided in the experimental section. Two hematopoietic tumor cell lines were chosen as a model system for aptamer selection because they are well studied and consist of relatively homogeneous tumor cells. In addition, flow cytometry analysis can be easily carried out to monitor the selection process and to evaluate the selected aptamers for their capability of recognizing target cells. Cultured precursor T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell line, CCRF-CEM, was used as targets for aptamer selection. A B-cell line from human Burkitt's lymphoma, Ramos, was used as the negative control to reduce collection of DNA sequences that could bind to common surface molecules present on both types of cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDuring selection, a library of single-stranded DNAs that contained a 52-mer random sequence region flanked by two 18-mer PCR primer sequences was used. The library was incubated with the target cells to allow binding to take place. Then the cells were washed and the DNA sequences bound to the cell surface were eluted. The collected sequences were then allowed to interact with excess negative control cells and only the DNA sequences remained free in the supernatant were collected and amplified for the next round selection. After multi-round selection, the subtraction process efficiently reduced the DNA sequences that bound to the control cells, while those target-cell-specific aptamer candidates were enriched.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe progress of the selection process was monitored using flow cytometry. DNA products collected after each round were labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) dye and incubated with live cells. The fluorescence intensity of the labeled cells measured by the flow cytometry analysis represented binding capacity of the enriched DNA pool to the cells. With increasing number of selection cycles, steady increases in fluorescence intensity on the CCRF-CEM cells (target cells) were observed (\nFIG. 8A\n), indicating that DNA sequences with better binding affinity to the target cells were enriched. Nevertheless, there was no significant change in fluorescence intensity on the Ramos cells (control cells). These results indicate that the DNA probes specifically recognizing unique surface targets on CCRF-CEM cells were isolated. The specific binding of the selected pools to the target cells was further confirmed by confocal imaging (\nFIG. 8B\n). After incubation with tetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) dye-labeled aptamer pool, the CEM cells presented very bright fluorescence on the periphery of cells, while the Ramos cells displayed weak fluorescence.\n\n\n \nIdentification of Aptamers for the Target Cells.\n\n\n \n \n \nUsually it took about 20 rounds to achieve excellent enrichment of aptamer candidates. The highly enriched aptamer pools were cloned and sequenced by a high-throughput Genome Sequencing method. The sequences were grouped based on the homology of the DNA sequences of individual clones with each group containing very similar sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwenty sequences were chosen for further characterization because they were highly abundant in their family. The binding assays of the selected sequences with target cells were performed using flow cytometry. Thirteen sequences revealed obvious binding to CCRF-CEM cells. Moreover, the binding was not interfered by the addition of 1000 folds of starting DNA library. Except aptamers such as sgd2, sgc4 and its homologue sgc4a, which could recognize both CCRF-CEM and Ramos cells, other aptamers only recognized the target cell line, CCRF-CEM. Ten aptamers were confirmed to have high affinity for CCRF-CEM cells with calculated equilibrium dissociation constants (Kds) in the nM to pM range and their Kds are listed in Table 4 below. CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, CD45 are the surface antigens expressed on CCRF-CEM cells, and none of the tested aptamer sequences showed any evidence of competition with antibodies against these antigens. This indicates that the aptamers may interact with unique surface binding entities.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE 4\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSequences and Kds of the selected aptamers:\n \n \n \n5′-ATA CCA GCT TAT TCA ATT-(center random \n \n \n \nsequence)-AGA TAG TAA GTG CAA TCT-3′\n \n \n \n \n \nSequence \n \nCenter\n \nKd\n \n \n \nname\n \nsequence*\n \n(nM)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsgc3\n \nCCTGTGGGAAGGCTATAGAGGGGCCAGT\n \n 1.97 ± 0.29\n \n \n \n \n \nCTATGAA\nTAAGATGGCGGACTAATGTGT\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA\n (SEQ ID NO: 6)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsgc6\n \nCCTGTGGGAAGGCTATAGAGGGGCCA \n \n 8.76 ± 0.62\n \n \n \n \n \nGTCTATGAA\nCAAGATGGTTGATCCGT\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(SEQ ID NO: 7)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsgd3\n \nAGGGGGAGCTTGCGCGCATCAAGGTG \n \n 3.58 ± 0.58\n \n \n \n \n \nCTAAACGAAAGCCTCATGGCTTCTAT\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(SEQ ID NO: 8)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsgc4\n \nCGAGTGCGGATGCAAACGCCAGACAGG\n \n26.6 ± 2.1\n \n \n \n \n \nGGGACAGG\nAGATAAGAATAGCGTGATG\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(SEQ ID NO: 9)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsgc4a\n \nCGAGTGCGGATGCAAACG\n \n229 ± 38\n \n \n \n \n \nCCAGACAGGGGGACAGG \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(SEQ ID NO: 10)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsgc5\n \nACCGACGACGAACTATCTATCA\n \n113 ± 41\n \n \n \n \n \nCTATCTTACACATCATACCTCG \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(SEQ ID NO: 11)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsgc7\n \nACCGCAGCGACTATCTCGACTACATT \n \n144 ± 75\n \n \n \n \n \nACTAGCTTATACTCCGATCATCTCT\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(SEQ ID NO: 12)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsgc8\n \nAGTCACACTTAGAGTTCTA\nA\nCTGCTG \n \n 0.80 ± 0.09\n \n \n \n \n \nCGCCGCCGGGAAAATACTGTACGG\nT\nT\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(SEQ ID NO: 13\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsga16\n \nAGTCACACTTAGAGTTCTA\nG\nCTGCTG \n \n 5.00 ± 0.52\n \n \n \n \n \nCGCCGCCGGGAAAATACTGTACGG\nA\nT\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(SEQ ID NO: 14)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSgd2\n \nGAGTGAAGCAAGGATGCAACCTCGGC \n \n 7.21 ± 0.89\n \n \n \n \n \nTCCAACCCGTGAGAGTCGCGAAACTC\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(SEQ ID NO: 15)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nThe full-length sequences include two primer hybridization sites and the center random sequence.\n\n\n\n \nCell-SELEX Generates High Affinity Molecular Probes for Target Cells.\n\n\n \n \n \nThe individual aptamers were tested. As shown in \nFIGS. 9A and 9B\n, aptamers sga16 (Kd=5.00±0.52 nM) and its homologues sgc8 (Kd=0.80±0.09 nM) can specifically recognize the CCRF-CEM cells with high affinity. The specificity of both aptamers was also observed directly using confocal imaging. Intense fluorescence from sga16 bound on the CCRF-CEM cell surface was observed, while the Ramos cells had no obvious fluorescence. These results have clearly demonstrated the great potential of using aptamer sga16 and sgc8 as excellent molecular probes for CCRF-CEM cell recognition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is worth noting that some of the selected aptamers can identify binding entities expressed only by a small subset of target cells. Sequences sgc3 (Kd=1.97±0.29 nM), sgc6 (Kd=8.76±0.62 nM) and sgd3 (Kd=3.58±0.58 nM) were found to bind only to a small population of the CCRF-CEM cells (about 20%-40% of the cells) (the second peak in \nFIG. 10A\n and yellow area in \nFIG. 10C\n) with high affinity, but they did not bind to Ramos cells. Sgc3 and sgc6 are in fact homologues, while sequence sgd3 is very different from them. Confocal imaging also confirmed that aptamer sgc3 strongly bound to a subset of CCRF-CEM cells (\nFIG. 10B\n). These sgc3-labeled cells showed the same forward scatter and side scatter properties as the rest of sgc3-negative cells in flow cytometry assays, indicating they were viable cells. The sgc3-labeled cells were immunophenotyped and it was confirmed that these cells were CD5-positve and CD7-positive neoplastic T cells rather than other cell contamination (\nFIG. 10C\n). On the other hand, the sgc3-binding CCRF-CEM cells were CD3-negative, implying that they might represent a unique differentiation stage or phase of cell cycles.\n\n\n \nThe Selected Aptamers Can be Used for Highly Specific Recognition of Target Cells in Real Biological Samples.\n\n\n \n \n \nTo test the feasibility of the selected aptamers as probes for specific molecular recognition, FITC-labeled aptamers (sgc8, sgc3, sgd3, sgc4, sgd2) and monoclonal antibodies were used to detect CCRF-CEM leukemia cells mixed with normal human bone marrow aspirates. The human bone marrow aspirates consisted of mature and immature granulocytes, nucleated erythrocytes, monocytes, mature and immature B cells, and T cells. As expected, sgc8, sgc3 and sgd3 only recognized cultured leukemia T cells (CCRF-CEM) (\nFIG. 11\n), and did not bind to normal CD3-positive T cells or any other bone marrow cells. Aptamers sgc4 and sgd2 slightly hound to mature and immature B cells, a subset of CD3-positive T cells, nucleated erythrocytes from the human bone marrow, and cultured leukemia T cells (CCRF-CEM) (data not shown).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAptamers (sgc8, sgc3, sgd3, sgc4, sgd2) were all found to recognize other T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines, Sup-T1, Molt-4, and Jurkat, but not all of them could bind to cultured B-cells and AML cells (Table 5 below). Recognition of tumor cells in real clinical samples by the these aptamers was also tested. Patient's bone marrow aspirates were examined with FITC-labeled aptamers and monoclonal antibodies. The results (Table 5) revealed that none of aptamers (sgc8, sgc3, sgd3, sgc4, sgd2) could recognize the cancer cells from B-cell lymphoma patient, but all of them were able to bind the cancer cells from T cell ALL patient (\nFIG. 12\n), which were closely related to the CCRF-CEM target cells used in the subject cell-SELEX process. It can be seen that aptamers that specifically bind to the CCRF-CEM target cells could also recognize cells closely related to the target cell line even in real clinical samples. The capability of the aptamers selected in the subject cell-SELEX process for molecular diagnosis in clinical practice is clearly demonstrated here.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing aptamers to recognize cancer cells\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCell line\n\n\nsgc8\n\n\nsgc3\n\n\nsgc4\n\n\nsgd2\n\n\nsgd3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCultured\n\n\nMolt-4 (T cell-ALL)\n\n\n++++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n++++\n\n\n++++\n\n\n++++\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncell lines\n\n\nSup-T1 (T cell-ALL)\n\n\n++++\n\n\n+\n\n\n++++\n\n\n++++\n\n\n++\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nJurkat (T cell-ALL)\n\n\n++++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n++++\n\n\n++++\n\n\n++++\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSUP-B15 (B cell-All)\n\n\n+\n\n\n0\n\n\n++\n\n\n+\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nU266 (B-cell myeloma)\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nToledo (B-\ncell\n \n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n++++\n\n\n++++\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nlymphoma)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMo2058 (B-\ncell\n \n\n\n0\n\n\n++\n\n\n++\n\n\n0\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nlymphoma)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNB-4 (AML, APL)\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n+++\n\n\n++++\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCells from\n\n\nTALL\n\n\n++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\n\npatients\n\n\nLarge B-\ncell lymphoma\n \n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA threshold based on fluorescence intensity of FITC in the flow cytometry analysis was chosen so that 99 percent of cells incubated with the FITC-labeled unselected DNA library would have fluorescence intensity below it. When FITC-labeled aptamer was allowed to interact with the cells, the percentage of the cells with fluorescence above the set threshold was used to evaluate the binding capacity of the aptamer to the cells. 0: <10% +: 10-35%, ++: 35-60%, +++: 60-85%, ++++: >85%; AML: acute myeloid leukemia; ALL: acute lymphoblastic leukemia, APL: acute promyelocytic leukemia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nThe Binding Sites of the Aptamers on the Target Cells are Most Likely Proteins.\n\n\n \n \n \nTo have a preliminary test whether the targets of the aptamers are membrane proteins on the cell surface, CCRF-CEM cells were treated with proteinases such as trypsin and proteinase K for a short time before adding the aptamer to these treated cells. As shown in \nFIG. 13\n, after treating the cells with trypsin or proteinase K for 10 minutes, aptamer sgc8, sgc3, and sgd3 lost their binding to these cells, while the interactions of aptamer sgd2 and sgd4 with the cells were not affected. It can be deduced that the binding entities of aptamer sgc8, sgc3 and sgd3 had been removed by the proteinases, indicating the target molecules were most likely membrane proteins. Interestingly, the targets of aptamers sgd2 and sgc4 were clearly not affected by the proteinases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to the subject invention, a cell-based SELEX strategy is provided to generate a panel of aptamers as useful molecular probes to reveal the molecular level differences between any two types of cells. The selected aptamers have then been used for the specific recognition of diseased cells. Molecular differences between the target and control cells could be easily isolated, providing an effective approach to the discovery of molecular signatures of many other diseases. More importantly, detailed knowledge of the distinct targets on the cell surface is not needed prior to the selection, which could greatly simplify the process of molecular probe development.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe entire selection process of the subject invention is simple, fast, reproducible and straightforward, and the selected aptamers can specifically bind to target cells with Kds in the nM to pM range. Some of the aptamers can recognize a small subset of the target cells. Target cells mixed with normal human bone marrow aspirate can be readily distinguished. In addition, cancer cells from clinical patients' specimens, which are closely related to the target cells were also recognized by the selected aptamers. Furthermore, the aptamers can be employed to isolate the disease-specific protein targets to facilitate discovery of clinically important biomarkers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy developing specific probes for molecular signatures on cancer cell surface in accordance with the subject invention, the user is afforded the ability to define tumors, create tailored treatment regime for more “personalized” medicine, monitor the response to therapy, and detect minimal residual diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following example illustrates a procedure for practicing the invention. This example should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention in any way. All percentages are by weight and all solvent mixture proportions are by volume unless otherwise noted.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 3 \n\n\nCell Lines and Buffers\n\n\n \n \n \nCCRF-CEM (CCL-119, T-cell lines, human acute lymphoblastic leukemia), Ramos, (CRL-1596, B-cell line, human Burkitt's lymphoma), Toledo (CRL-2631, B-cell line, human diffuse large cell lymphoma), Sup-T1(CRL-1942, T-cell lines, human lymphoblastic leukemia), Jurkat (TIB-152, human acute T cell leukemia), Molt-4 (CRL-1582, T-cell lines, human acute lymphoblastic leukemia), SUP-B15 (CRL-1929, B-lymphoblast, human acute lymphoblastic leukemia) and U266 (TIB-196, B-lymphocyte, human myeloma, plasmacytoma) were obtained from ATCC (American Type Culture collection). Mo2058 (Mantle-cell lymphoma, Epstein-Barr Virus-positive cell line) and NB-4 (acute promyelocytic leukemia) were obtained from Department of Pathology, University of Florida). All the cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (ATCC) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (heat inactivated, GIBCO) and 100 IU/mL penicillin-Streptomycin (Cellgro). Cells were washed before and after incubation with wash buffer (4.5 g/L glucose and 5 mM MgCl\n2 \nin Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline with calcium chloride and magnesium chloride (Sigma)). Binding buffer used for selection was prepared by adding yeast tRNA (0.1 mg/mL) (Sigma) and BSA (1 mg/mL) (Fisher) into wash buffer to reduce background binding. Antibodies against CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7 and CD45 were purchased from BD Biosciences. Trypsin and proteinase K were purchased from Fisher biotech.\n\n\n \nSELEX Library and Primers\n\n\n \n \n \nHPLC purified library contained a central randomized sequence of 52 nucleotides (nt) flanked by two 18-nt primer hybridization sites (SEQ ID NOS:1-2) (5′-ATA CCA GCT TAT TCA ATT (SEQ ID NO:1)-52-nt-AGA TAG TAA GTG CAA TCT-(SEQ ID NO:2)3′). A fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled 5′-primer (5′-FITC-ATA CCA OCT TAT TCA ATT (SEQ ID NO:16)-3′) or a tetramethylrhodamine anhydride (TAMRA)-labeled 5′-primer (5′-TMR-ATA CCA GCT TAT TCA ATT (SEQ id NO:17)-3′); and a triple biotinylated (trB) 3′-primer (5′-trB-AGA TTG CAC TTA CTA TCT (SEQ ID NO:18)-3′) were used in the PCR reactions for the synthesis of double-labeled, double-stranded. DNA molecules. After denaturing in alkaline condition (0.2 M NaOH), the FITC-conjugated sense ssDNA strand was separated from the biotinylated anti-sense ssDNA strand with streptavidin-coated sepharose beads (Amersham Bioscience) and used for next round selection. The selection process was monitored using flow cytometry.\n\n\n \nSELEX Procedures\n\n\n \n \n \nThe procedures of selection were as follows: ssDNA pool (200 pmol) dissolved in 400 μL binding buffer was denatured by heating at 95° C. for 5 min and cooled on ice for 10 min before binding. Then the ssDNA pool was incubated with 1-2×10\n6 \nCCRF-CEM cells (target cells) on ice for 1 hour. After washing, the bound DNAs were eluted by heating at 95° C. for 5 min in 300 μL of binding buffer. The eluted DNAs were then incubated with Ramos cells (negative cells, 5-fold excess than CCRF-CEM cells) on ice for counter-selection for 1 hour. After centrifugation, the supernatant was desalted and then amplified by PCR with FITC- or biotin-labeled primers (10-20 cycles of 0.5 min at 94° C., 0.5 min at 46° C., and 0.5 min at 72° C., followed by 5 min at 72° C.; the Taq-polymerase and dNTPs were obtained from Takara). The selected sense ssDNA was separated from the biotinylated anti-sense ssDNA strand by streptavidin-coated sepharose beads (Amersham Bioscience). For the first round selection, the amount of initial ssDNA pool was 10 nmol, dissolved in 1 mL binding buffer; and the counter selection step was eliminated. In order to acquire aptamers with high affinity and specificity, the wash strength was enhanced gradually by extending wash time (from 1 min to 10 min), increasing the volume of wash buffer (from 0.5 mL to 5 mL) and the number of washes (from 3-5). Additionally, 20% FBS and 50-300 fold molar excess genomic DNA were added to the incubation solution. After 20 rounds of selection, selected ssDNA pool was PCR-amplified using unmodified primers and cloned into \nEscherichia coli \nusing the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). Cloned sequences were determined by the Genome Sequencing Services Laboratory at the University of Florida.\n\n\n \nFlow Cytometric Analysis\n\n\n \n \n \nTo monitor the enrichment of aptamer candidates after selection, FITC-labeled ssDNA pool was incubated with 2×10\n5 \nCCRF-CEM cells or Ramos cells in 200 μL of binding buffer containing 20% FBS on ice for 50 min. Cells were washed twice with 0.7 ml of binding buffer (with 0.1% NaN\n2\n), and suspended in 0.4 ml of binding buffer (with 0.1% NaN\n2\n). The fluorescence was determined with a FACScan cytometer (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, Calif.) by counting 30000 events. The FITC-labeled unselected ssDNA library was used as negative control.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe binding affinity of aptamers was determined by incubating CCRF-CEM cells (5×10\n5\n) with varying concentrations of FITC-labeled aptamer in 500 μL volume of binding buffer containing 20% FBS on ice for 50 min in the dark. Cells were then washed twice with 0.7 ml of the binding buffer with 0.1% sodium azide, suspended in 0.4 ml of binding buffer with 0.1% sodium azide, and subjected to flow cytometric analysis within 30 min. The FITC-labeled unselected ssDNA library was used as negative control to determine nonspecific binding. All the experiments for binding assay were repeated 2-4 times. The mean fluorescence intensity of target cells labeled by aptamers was used to calculate for specific binding by subtracting the mean fluorescence intensity of non-specific binding from unselected library DNAs (Davis, K. A., Abrams, B., Lin, Y. & Jayasena, S. D. (1996) \nNucleic. Acids. Res. \n24, 702-706, Davis, K. A., Lin, Y., Abrams, B. & Jayasena, S. D. (1998) \nNucleic. Acids. Res. \n26, 3915-3924). The equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) of the aptamer-cell interaction were obtained by fitting the dependence of fluorescence intensity of specific binding on the concentration of the aptamers to the equation Y=BmaxX/(Kd+X) using the SigmaPlot software (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, Calif.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo test the feasibility of using aptamers for recognition of cancer cells in real biological samples, FITC labeled aptamers were mixed with PE or PerCP labeled antibodies of CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, CD19, and CD45 respectively, and incubated with 2×10\n5 \ncancer cells and/or 2×10\n5 \ncells in human bone marrow aspirates. After washing as described above, the fluorescence was determined with a FACScan cytometer (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, Calif.).\n\n\n \n \nConfocal Imaging of Cell Bound with Aptamer\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor confocal imaging, the selected ssDNA pools or aptamers were labeled with TAMRA. Cells were incubated with 50 pmol TMR-labeled ssDNA in 100 μL of binding buffer containing 20% FBS on ice for 50 min. Other treatment steps were the same as described in the flow cytometry selection. 20 μL of cell suspension bound with TAMRA-labeled ssDNA was dropped on a thin glass slide placed above a 60× objective on the confocal microscope and then covered with a cover slip. Imaging of the cells was performed on an Olympus FV500-IX81 confocal microscope (Olympus America Inc., Melville, N.Y.). A 5 mW 543 nM He—Ne laser was the excitation source for TAMRA throughout the experiments. The objective used for imaging was a PLAPO60XO3PH 60× oil immersion objective with a numerical aperture of 1.40 from Olympus (Melville, N.Y.).\n\n\n \nProteinase Treatment for Cells\n\n\n \n \n \n5×10\n6 \nof CCRF-CEM cells were washed with 2 ml PBS, then incubateded with 1 mL of 0.05% Trypsin/0.53 mM EDTA in HBSS or 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K in PBS at 37□ for 2 min and 10 mM. FBS was then added to quench with the proteinases. After washing with 2 ml binding buffer, the treated cells were used for aptamer binding assay as described in the flow cytometric analysis section.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll patents, patent applications, provisional applications, and publications referred to or cited herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety, including all figures and tables, to the extent they are not inconsistent with the explicit teachings of this specification.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt should be understood that the examples and embodiments described herein are for illustrative purposes only and that various modifications or changes in light thereof will be suggested to persons skilled in the art and are to be included within the spirit and purview of this application."
