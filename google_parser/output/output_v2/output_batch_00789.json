No. 60/906,387, filed Mar. 12, 2007, and additionally (ii) claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/192,261, filed Sep. 16, 2008 and to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/227,399, filed Jul. 21, 2009, the disclosures all of which are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nFIELD\n\n\nThis invention provides (among other things) chemically modified opioid agonists that possess certain advantages over opioid agonists lacking the chemical modification. The chemically modified opioid agonists described herein relate to and/or have application(s) in (among others) the fields of drug discovery, pharmacotherapy, physiology, organic chemistry and polymer chemistry.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nOpioid agonists, such as morphine, have long been used to treat patients suffering from pain. Opioid agonists exert their analgesic and other pharmacological effects through interactions with opioid receptors, of which, there are three main classes: mu (μ) receptors, kappa (κ) receptors, and delta (δ) receptors. Most of the clinically used opioid agonists are relatively selective for mu receptors, although opioid agonists typically have agonist activity at other opioid receptors (particularly at increased concentrations).\n\n\nOpioids exert their effects by selectively inhibiting the release of neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine, norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, and substance P.\n\n\nPharmacologically, opioid agonists represent an important class of agents employed in the management of pain. Unfortunately, the use of opioid agonists is associated with the potential for abuse. In addition, oral administration of opioid agonists often results in significant first pass metabolism. Furthermore, administration of opioid agonists results in significant CNS-mediated effects, such as slowed breathing, which can result in death. Thus, a reduction of any one of these or other characteristics would enhance their desirability as therapeutic drugs.\n\n\nThe present disclosure seeks to address these and other needs in the art by providing (among other things) a conjugate of a water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer and a opioid agonist.\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\nIn one or more embodiments of the invention, a compound is provided, the compound comprising a residue of an opioid agonist covalently attached (preferably via a stable linkage) to a water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer.\n\n\nIn one or more embodiments of the invention, a compound is provided, the compound comprising a residue of a kappa opioid agonist covalently attached (preferably via a stable linkage) to a water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer [wherein it is understood that a kappa opioid agonist (i) is preferentially selective for kappa opioid receptors over both mu opioid receptors and delta opioid receptors within the same mammalian species, and (ii) will have agonist activity at the kappa receptor].\n\n\nIn one or more embodiments of the invention, a compound is provided, the compound comprising a residue of a mu opioid agonist covalently attached (preferably via a stable linkage) to a water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer [wherein it is understood that a kappa opioid agonist (i) is preferentially selective for mu opioid receptors over both kappa opioid receptors and delta opioid receptors within the same mammalian species, and (ii) will have agonist activity at the mu receptor].\n\n\nIn one or more embodiments of the invention, a compound is provided, the compound comprising a residue of an opioid agonist covalently attached via a stable linkage to a water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer, wherein the opioid agonist has a structure encompassed by the following formula:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein:\n\n\n\nR\n1 \nis H or an organic radical [such as methyl, ethyl and —C(O)CH\n3\n];\n\n\nR\n2 \nis H or OH;\n\n\nR\n3 \nis H or an organic radical;\n\n\nR\n4 \nis H or an organic radical;\n\n\nthe dotted line (“---”) represents an optional double bond;\n\n\nY\n1 \nis O (oxygen) or S; and\n\n\nR\n5 \nis selected from the group consisting of\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n(without regard to stereochemistry), wherein R\n6 \nis an organic radical [including —C(O)CH\n3\n].\n\n\n\nIn one or more embodiments of the invention, a compound is provided, the compound comprising a residue of an opioid agonist covalently attached via a stable or degradable linkage to a water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer, wherein the opioid agonist is selected from the group consisting of asimadoline, bremazocine, enadoline, ethylketocyclazocine, GR89,696, ICI204448, ICI197067, PD117,302, nalbuphine, pentazocine, quadazocine (WIN 44, 441-3), salvinorin A, spiradoline, TRK-820, U50488, and U69593.\n\n\nIn one or more embodiments of the invention, a composition is provided, the composition comprising:\n\n\n(i) a compound comprising a residue of an opioid agonist covalently attached via a stable linkage to a water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer; and\n\n\n(ii) optionally, a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.\n\n\nIn one or more embodiments of the invention, a dosage form is provided, the dosage form comprising a compound comprising a residue of an opioid agonist covalently attached via a stable linkage to a water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer.\n\n\nIn one or more embodiments of the invention, a method is provided, the method comprising covalently attaching a water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer to an opioid agonist.\n\n\nIn one or more embodiments of the invention, a method is provided, the method comprising administering a compound comprising a residue of an opioid agonist covalently attached via a stable linkage to a water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer.\n\n\nIn one or more embodiments of the invention, a method is provided, the method comprising binding (e.g., selectively binding) mu opioid receptors, wherein said binding is achieved by administering a compound comprising a residue of an opioid agonist covalently attached to a water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer.

Conjugates belonging to the following conjugate series: mPEG\n2-7,9\n-O-morphine were evaluated.\n\n\n \nFIG. 5\n is a graph showing percent writhing per total number of mice, n, in the study group, versus dose of mPEG\nn\n-O-hydroxycodone conjugate administered in an analgesic assay for evaluating the extent of reduction or prevention of visceral pain in mice as described in detail in Example 18. Morphine was used as a control; unconjugated parent molecule, oxycodone, was also administered to provide an additional point of reference. Conjugates belonging to the following conjugate series: mPEG\n1-4, 6, 7, 9\n-O-hydroxycodone were evaluated.\n\n\n \nFIG. 6\n is a graph showing percent writhing per total number of mice, n, in the study group, versus dose of mPEG\nn\n-O-codeine conjugate administered in an analgesic assay for evaluating the extent of reduction or prevention of visceral pain in mice as described in detail in Example 18. Morphine was used as a control; unconjugated parent molecule, codeine, was also administered to provide an additional point of reference. Conjugates belonging to the following conjugate series: mPEG\n3-7, 9\n-O-codeine were evaluated.\n\n\n \nFIGS. 7-9\n are plots indicating the results of a hot plate latency analgesic assay in mice as described in detail in Example 19. Specifically, the figures correspond to graphs showing latency (time to lick hindpaw), in seconds versus dose of compound. \nFIG. 7\n provides results for mPEG\n1-5\n-O-hydroxycodone conjugates as well as for unconjugated parent molecule; \nFIG. 8\n provides results for mPEG\n1-5\n-O-morphine conjugates as well for unconjugated parent molecule; and \nFIG. 9\n provides results for mPEG\n2-5\n, 9-O-codeine conjugates as well as for the parent molecule.

Typically, an unfiltered aqueous preparation of a “water-soluble” oligomer transmits at least 75%, more preferably at least 95%, of the amount of light transmitted by the same solution after filtering. It is most preferred, however, that the water-soluble oligomer is at least 95% (by weight) soluble in water or completely soluble in water. With respect to being “non-peptidic,” an oligomer is non-peptidic when it has less than 35% (by weight) of amino acid residues.\n\n\nThe terms “monomer,” “monomeric subunit” and “monomeric unit” are used interchangeably herein and refer to one of the basic structural units of a polymer or oligomer. In the case of a homo-oligomer, a single repeating structural unit forms the oligomer. In the case of a co-oligomer, two or more structural units are repeated—either in a pattern or randomly—to form the oligomer. Preferred oligomers used in connection with present the invention are homo-oligomers. The water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer typically comprises one or more monomers serially attached to form a chain of monomers. The oligomer can be formed from a single monomer type (i.e., is homo-oligomeric) or two or three monomer types (i.e., is co-oligomeric).\n\n\nAn “oligomer” is a molecule possessing from about 2 to about 50 monomers, preferably from about 2 to about 30 monomers. The architecture of an oligomer can vary. Specific oligomers for use in the invention include those having a variety of geometries such as linear, branched, or forked, to be described in greater detail below.\n\n\n“PEG” or “polyethylene glycol,” as used herein, is meant to encompass any water-soluble poly(ethylene oxide). Unless otherwise indicated, a “PEG oligomer” (also called an oligoethylene glycol) is one in which substantially all (and more preferably all) monomeric subunits are ethylene oxide subunits. The oligomer may, however, contain distinct end capping moieties or functional groups, e.g., for conjugation. Typically, PEG oligomers for use in the present invention will comprise one of the two following structures: “—(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)\nn\n—” or “—(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)\nn-1\nCH\n2\nCH\n2\n—,” depending upon whether the terminal oxygen(s) has been displaced, e.g., during a synthetic transformation. For PEG oligomers, “n” varies from about 2 to 50, preferably from about 2 to about 30, and the terminal groups and architecture of the overall PEG can vary. When PEG further comprises a functional group, A, for linking to, e.g., a small molecule drug, the functional group when covalently attached to a PEG oligomer does not result in formation of (i) an oxygen-oxygen bond (—O—O—, a peroxide linkage), or (ii) a nitrogen-oxygen bond (N—O, O—N).\n\n\nAn “end capping group” is generally a non-reactive carbon-containing group attached to a terminal oxygen of a PEG oligomer. Exemplary end capping groups comprise a C\n1-5 \nalkyl group, such as methyl, ethyl and benzyl), as well as aryl, heteroaryl, cyclo, heterocyclo, and the like. For the purposes of the present invention, the preferred capping groups have relatively low molecular weights such as methyl or ethyl. The end-capping group can also comprise a detectable label. Such labels include, without limitation, fluorescers, chemiluminescers, moieties used in enzyme labeling, colorimetric labels (e.g., dyes), metal ions, and radioactive moieties.\n\n\n“Branched”, in reference to the geometry or overall structure of an oligomer, refers to an oligomer having two or more polymers representing distinct “arms” that extend from a branch point.\n\n\n“Forked” in reference to the geometry or overall structure of an oligomer, refers to an oligomer having two or more functional groups (typically through one or more atoms) extending from a branch point.\n\n\nA “branch point” refers to a bifurcation point comprising one or more atoms at which an oligomer branches or forks from a linear structure into one or more additional arms.\n\n\nThe term “reactive” or “activated” refers to a functional group that reacts readily or at a practical rate under conventional conditions of organic synthesis. This is in contrast to those groups that either do not react or require strong catalysts or impractical reaction conditions in order to react (i.e., a “nonreactive” or “inert” group).\n\n\n“Not readily reactive,” with reference to a functional group present on a molecule in a reaction mixture, indicates that the group remains largely intact under conditions that are effective to produce a desired reaction in the reaction mixture.\n\n\nA “protecting group” is a moiety that prevents or blocks reaction of a particular chemically reactive functional group in a molecule under certain reaction conditions. The protecting group will vary depending upon the type of chemically reactive group being protected as well as the reaction conditions to be employed and the presence of additional reactive or protecting groups in the molecule. Functional groups which may be protected include, by way of example, carboxylic acid groups, amino groups, hydroxyl groups, thiol groups, carbonyl groups and the like. Representative protecting groups for carboxylic acids include esters (such as a p-methoxybenzyl ester), amides and hydrazides; for amino groups, carbamates (such as tert-butoxycarbonyl) and amides; for hydroxyl groups, ethers and esters; for thiol groups, thioethers and thioesters; for carbonyl groups, acetals and ketals; and the like. Such protecting groups are well-known to those skilled in the art and are described, for example, in T. W. Greene and G. M. Wuts, \nProtecting Groups in Organic Synthesis\n, Third Edition, Wiley, New York, 1999, and references cited therein.\n\n\nA functional group in “protected form” refers to a functional group bearing a protecting group. As used herein, the term “functional group” or any synonym thereof encompasses protected forms thereof.\n\n\nA “physiologically cleavable” or “hydrolyzable” or “degradable” bond is a relatively labile bond that reacts with water (i.e., is hydrolyzed) under ordinary physiological conditions. The tendency of a bond to hydrolyze in water under ordinary physiological conditions will depend not only on the general type of linkage connecting two central atoms but also on the substituents attached to these central atoms. Such bonds are generally recognizable by those of ordinary skill in the art. Appropriate hydrolytically unstable or weak linkages include but are not limited to carboxylate ester, phosphate ester, anhydrides, acetals, ketals, acyloxyalkyl ether, imines, orthoesters, peptides, oligonucleotides, thioesters, and carbonates.\n\n\nAn “enzymatically degradable linkage” means a linkage that is subject to degradation by one or more enzymes under ordinary physiological conditions.\n\n\nA “stable” linkage or bond refers to a chemical moiety or bond, typically a covalent bond, that is substantially stable in water, that is to say, does not undergo hydrolysis under ordinary physiological conditions to any appreciable extent over an extended period of time. Examples of hydrolytically stable linkages include but are not limited to the following: carbon-carbon bonds (e.g., in aliphatic chains), ethers, amides, urethanes, amines, and the like. Generally, a stable linkage is one that exhibits a rate of hydrolysis of less than about 1-2% per day under ordinary physiological conditions. Hydrolysis rates of representative chemical bonds can be found in most standard chemistry textbooks.\n\n\nIn the context of describing the consistency of oligomers in a given composition, “substantially” or “essentially” means nearly totally or completely, for instance, 95% or greater, more preferably 97% or greater, still more preferably 98% or greater, even more preferably 99% or greater, yet still more preferably 99.9% or greater, with 99.99% or greater being most preferred of some given quantity.\n\n\n“Monodisperse” refers to an oligomer composition wherein substantially all of the oligomers in the composition have a well-defined, single molecular weight and defined number of monomers, as determined by chromatography or mass spectrometry. Monodisperse oligomer compositions are in one sense pure, that is, substantially comprising molecules having a single and definable number of monomers rather than several different numbers of monomers (i.e., an oligomer composition having three or more different oligomer sizes). A monodisperse oligomer composition possesses a MW/Mn value of 1.0005 or less, and more preferably, a MW/Mn value of 1.0000. By extension, a composition comprised of monodisperse conjugates means that substantially all oligomers of all conjugates in the composition have a single and definable number (as a whole number) of monomers rather than a distribution and would possess a MW/Mn value of 1.0005, and more preferably, a MW/Mn value of 1.0000 if the oligomer were not attached to the residue of the opioid agonist. A composition comprised of monodisperse conjugates can include, however, one or more nonconjugate substances such as solvents, reagents, excipients, and so forth.\n\n\n“Bimodal,” in reference to an oligomer composition, refers to an oligomer composition wherein substantially all oligomers in the composition have one of two definable and different numbers (as whole numbers) of monomers rather than a distribution, and whose distribution of molecular weights, when plotted as a number fraction versus molecular weight, appears as two separate identifiable peaks. Preferably, for a bimodal oligomer composition as described herein, each peak is generally symmetric about its mean, although the size of the two peaks may differ. Ideally, the polydispersity index of each peak in the bimodal distribution, Mw/Mn, is 1.01 or less, more preferably 1.001 or less, and even more preferably 1.0005 or less, and most preferably a MW/Mn value of 1.0000. By extension, a composition comprised of bimodal conjugates means that substantially all oligomers of all conjugates in the composition have one of two definable and different numbers (as whole numbers) of monomers rather than a large distribution and would possess a MW/Mn value of 1.01 or less, more preferably 1.001 or less and even more preferably 1.0005 or less, and most preferably a MW/Mn value of 1.0000 if the oligomer were not attached to the residue of the opioid agonist. A composition comprised of bimodal conjugates can include, however, one or more nonconjugate substances such as solvents, reagents, excipients, and so forth.\n\n\nAn “opioid agonist” is broadly used herein to refer to an organic, inorganic, or organometallic compound typically having a molecular weight of less than about 1000 Daltons (and typically less than 500 Daltons) and having some degree of activity as a mu and/or kappa agonist. Opioid agonists encompass oligopeptides and other biomolecules having a molecular weight of less than about 1000.\n\n\nA “biological membrane” is any membrane, typically made from specialized cells or tissues, that serves as a barrier to at least some foreign entities or otherwise undesirable materials. As used herein a “biological membrane” includes those membranes that are associated with physiological protective barriers including, for example: the blood-brain barrier (BBB); the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier; the blood-placental barrier; the blood-milk barrier; the blood-testes barrier; and mucosal barriers including the vaginal mucosa, urethral mucosa, anal mucosa, buccal mucosa, sublingual mucosa, rectal mucosa, and so forth. Unless the context clearly dictates otherwise, the term “biological membrane” does not include those membranes associated with the middle gastro-intestinal tract (e.g., stomach and small intestines).\n\n\nA “biological membrane crossing rate,” as used herein, provides a measure of a compound's ability to cross a biological membrane (such as the membrane associated with the blood-brain barrier). A variety of methods can be used to assess transport of a molecule across any given biological membrane. Methods to assess the biological membrane crossing rate associated with any given biological barrier (e.g., the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, the blood-placental barrier, the blood-milk barrier, the intestinal barrier, and so forth), are known in the art, described herein and/or in the relevant literature, and/or can be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\nA “reduced rate of metabolism” in reference to the present invention, refers to a measurable reduction in the rate of metabolism of a water-soluble oligomer-small molecule drug conjugate as compared to rate of metabolism of the small molecule drug not attached to the water-soluble oligomer (i.e., the small molecule drug itself) or a reference standard material. In the special case of “reduced first pass rate of metabolism,” the same “reduced rate of metabolism” is required except that the small molecule drug (or reference standard material) and the corresponding conjugate are administered orally. Orally administered drugs are absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract into the portal circulation and must pass through the liver prior to reaching the systemic circulation. Because the liver is the primary site of drug metabolism or biotransformation, a substantial amount of drug can be metabolized before it ever reaches the systemic circulation. The degree of first pass metabolism, and thus, any reduction thereof, can be measured by a number of different approaches. For instance, animal blood samples can be collected at timed intervals and the plasma or serum analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry for metabolite levels. Other techniques for measuring a “reduced rate of metabolism” associated with the first pass metabolism and other metabolic processes are known in the art, described herein and/or in the relevant literature, and/or can be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art. Preferably, a conjugate of the invention can provide a reduced rate of metabolism reduction satisfying at least one of the following values: at least about 30%; at least about 40%; at least about 50%; at least about 60%; at least about 70%; at least about 80%; and at least about 90%. A compound (such as a small molecule drug or conjugate thereof) that is “orally bioavailable” is one that preferably possesses a bioavailability when administered orally of greater than 25%, and preferably greater than 70%, where a compound's bioavailability is the fraction of administered drug that reaches the systemic circulation in unmetabolized form.\n\n\n“Alkyl” refers to a hydrocarbon chain, typically ranging from about 1 to 20 atoms in length. Such hydrocarbon chains are preferably but not necessarily saturated and may be branched or straight chain, although typically straight chain is preferred. Exemplary alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, 1-methylbutyl, 1-ethylpropyl, 3-methylpentyl, and the like. As used herein, “alkyl” includes cycloalkyl when three or more carbon atoms are referenced. An “alkenyl” group is an alkyl of 2 to 20 carbon atoms with at least one carbon-carbon double bond.\n\n\nThe terms “substituted alkyl” or “substituted C\nq-r \nalkyl” where q and r are integers identifying the range of carbon atoms contained in the alkyl group, denotes the above alkyl groups that are substituted by one, two or three halo (e.g., F, Cl, Br, I), trifluoromethyl, hydroxy, C\n1-7 \nalkyl (e.g., methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, butyl, t-butyl, and so forth), C\n1-7 \nalkoxy, C\n1-7 \nacyloxy, C\n3-7 \nheterocyclic, amino, phenoxy, nitro, carboxy, carboxy, acyl, cyano. The substituted alkyl groups may be substituted once, twice or three times with the same or with different substituents.\n\n\n“Lower alkyl” refers to an alkyl group containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and may be straight chain or branched, as exemplified by methyl, ethyl, n-butyl, i-butyl, t-butyl. “Lower alkenyl” refers to a lower alkyl group of 2 to 6 carbon atoms having at least one carbon-carbon double bond.\n\n\n“Non-interfering substituents” are those groups that, when present in a molecule, are typically non-reactive with other functional groups contained within the molecule.\n\n\n“Alkoxy” refers to an —O—R group, wherein R is alkyl or substituted alkyl, preferably C\n1\n-C\n20 \nalkyl (e.g., methoxy, ethoxy, propyloxy, benzyl, etc.), preferably C\n1\n-C\n7\n.\n\n\n“Pharmaceutically acceptable excipient” or “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” refers to component that can be included in the compositions of the invention in order to provide for a composition that has an advantage (e.g., more suited for administration to a patient) over a composition lacking the component and that is recognized as not causing significant adverse toxicological effects to a patient.\n\n\nThe term “aryl” means an aromatic group having up to 14 carbon atoms. Aryl groups include phenyl, naphthyl, biphenyl, phenanthrenyl, naphthacenyl, and the like. “Substituted phenyl” and “substituted aryl” denote a phenyl group and aryl group, respectively, substituted with one, two, three, four or five (e.g. 1-2, 1-3 or 1-4 substituents) chosen from halo (F, Cl, Br, I), hydroxy, hydroxy, cyano, nitro, alkyl (e.g., C\n1-6 \nalkyl), alkoxy (e.g., C\n1-6 \nalkoxy), benzyloxy, carboxy, aryl, and so forth.\n\n\nAn “aromatic-containing moiety” is a collection of atoms containing at least aryl and optionally one or more atoms. Suitable aromatic-containing moieties are described herein.\n\n\nFor simplicity, chemical moieties are defined and referred to throughout primarily as univalent chemical moieties (e.g., alkyl, aryl, etc.). Nevertheless, such terms are also used to convey corresponding multivalent moieties under the appropriate structural circumstances clear to those skilled in the art. For example, while an “alkyl” moiety generally refers to a monovalent radical (e.g., CH\n3\n—CH\n2\n—), in certain circumstances a bivalent linking moiety can be “alkyl,” in which case those skilled in the art will understand the alkyl to be a divalent radical (e.g., —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—), which is equivalent to the term “alkylene.” (Similarly, in circumstances in which a divalent moiety is required and is stated as being “aryl,” those skilled in the art will understand that the term “aryl” refers to the corresponding divalent moiety, arylene). All atoms are understood to have their normal number of valences for bond formation (i.e., 4 for carbon, 3 for N, 2 for O, and 2, 4, or 6 for S, depending on the oxidation state of the S).\n\n\n“Pharmacologically effective amount,” “physiologically effective amount,” and “therapeutically effective amount” are used interchangeably herein to mean the amount of a water-soluble oligomer-small molecule drug conjugate present in a composition that is needed to provide a threshold level of active agent and/or conjugate in the bloodstream or in the target tissue. The precise amount will depend upon numerous factors, e.g., the particular active agent, the components and physical characteristics of the composition, intended patient population, patient considerations, and the like, and can readily be determined by one skilled in the art, based upon the information provided herein and available in the relevant literature.\n\n\nA “difunctional” oligomer is an oligomer having two functional groups contained therein, typically at its termini. When the functional groups are the same, the oligomer is said to be homodifunctional. When the functional groups are different, the oligomer is said to be heterobifunctional.\n\n\nA basic reactant or an acidic reactant described herein include neutral, charged, and any corresponding salt forms thereof.\n\n\nThe term “patient,” refers to a living organism suffering from or prone to a condition that can be prevented or treated by administration of a conjugate as described herein, typically, but not necessarily, in the form of a water-soluble oligomer-small molecule drug conjugate, and includes both humans and animals.\n\n\n“Optional” or “optionally” means that the subsequently described circumstance may but need not necessarily occur, so that the description includes instances where the circumstance occurs and instances where it does not.\n\n\nAs indicated above, the present invention is directed to (among other things) a compound comprising a residue of an opioid agonist covalently attached via a stable or degradable linkage to a water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer.\n\n\nIn one or more embodiments of the invention, a compound is provided, the compound comprising a residue of an opioid agonist covalently attached via a stable or degradable linkage to a water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer, wherein the opioid agonist has a structure encompassed by the following formula:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein;\n\n\n\nR\n1 \nis H or an organic radical [such as methyl, ethyl and —C(O)CH\n3\n];\n\n\nR\n2 \nis H or OH;\n\n\nR\n3 \nis H or an organic radical;\n\n\nR\n4 \nis H or an organic radical;\n\n\nthe dotted line (“---”) represents an optional double bond;\n\n\nY\n1 \nis O or S; and\n\n\nR\n5 \nis selected from the group consisting of\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n(without regard to stereochemistry), wherein R\n6 \nis an organic radical [including C(O)CH\n3\n]. Exemplary R\n3 \ngroups include lower alkyl such as methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, and the like, as well as the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn one or more embodiments of the invention, a compound is provided, the compound comprising a residue of an opioid agonist covalently attached via a stable or degradable linkage to a water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer, wherein the opioid agonist has a structure encompassed by the following formula:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein:\n\n\n\nN* is nitrogen;\n\n\nAr is selected from the group consisting of cyclohexyl, phenyl, halophenyl, methoxyphenyl, aminophenyl, pyridyl, furyl and thienyl;\n\n\nAlk is selected from the group consisting of ethylene and propylene;\n\n\nR\nII \nis selected from the group consisting of lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, dimethylamino, cyclopropyl, 1-pyrrolidyl, morpholino (preferably lower alkyl such as ethyl);\n\n\nR\nII′\n is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, methyl and methoxy; and\n\n\nR\nII″\n is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and an organic radical (preferably lower alkyl).\n\n\nWith respect to Formula II, it will be understood that, depending on the conditions, one or both of the amines—but more typically, the amine marked with an asterisk (“N*”) in Formula II—can be protonated.\n\n\nExamples of specific opioid agonists include those selected from the group consisting acetorphine, acetyldihydrocodeine, acetyldihydrocodeinone, acetylmorphinone, alfentanil, allylprodine, alphaprodine, anileridine, benzylmorphine, bezitramide, buprenorphine, butorphanol, clonitazene, codeine, desomorphine, dextromoramide, dezocine, diampromide, diamorphone, dihydrocodeine, dihydromorphine, dimenoxadol, dimepheptanol, dimethylthiambutene, dioxaphetyl butyrate, dipipanone, eptazocine, ethoheptazine, ethylmethylthiambutene, ethylmorphine, etonitazene, etorphine, dihydroetorphine, fentanyl and derivatives, heroin, hydrocodone, hydroxycodone, hydromorphone, hydroxypethidine, isomethadone, ketobemidone, levorphanol, levophenacylmorphan, lofentanil, meperidine, meptazinol, metazocine, methadone, metopon, morphine, myrophine, narceine, nicomorphine, norlevorphanol, normethadone, nalorphine, nalbuphine, normorphine, norpipanone, opium, oxycodone, oxymorphone, papavereturn, pentazocine, phenadoxone, phenomorphan, phenazocine, phenoperidine, piminodine, piritramide, propheptazine, promedol, properidine, propoxyphene, sufentanil, tilidine, and tramadol. In certain embodiments, the opioid agonist is selected from the group consisting of hydrocodone, morphine, hydromorphone, oxycodone, codeine, levorphanol, meperidine, methadone, oxymorphone, buprenorphine, fentanyl, dipipanone, heroin, tramadol, nalbuphine, etorphine, dihydroetorphine, butorphanol, levorphanol.\n\n\nIt is believed that an advantage of the compounds of the present invention is their ability to retain some degree of opioid agonist activity while also exhibiting a decrease in metabolism and/or resulting in a decrease of CNS-mediated effects associated with the corresponding opioid agonist in unconjugated form. Although not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the oligomer-containing conjugates described herein—in contrast to the unconjugated “original” opioid agonist—are not metabolized as readily because the oligomer serves to reduce the overall affinity of the compound to substrates that can metabolize opioid agonists. In addition (and again, not wishing to be bound by theory), the extra size introduced by the oligomer—in contrast to the unconjugated “original” opioid agonist—reduces the ability of the compound to cross the blood-brain barrier.\n\n\nUse of oligomers (e.g., from a monodisperse or bimodal composition of oligomers, in contrast to relatively impure compositions) to form the conjugates of the invention can advantageously alter certain properties associated with the corresponding small molecule drug. For instance, a conjugate of the invention, when administered by any of a number of suitable administration routes, such as parenteral, oral, transdermal, buccal, pulmonary, or nasal, exhibits reduced penetration across the blood-brain barrier. It is preferred that the conjugate exhibit slowed, minimal or effectively no crossing of the blood-brain barrier, while still crossing the gastro-intestinal (GI) walls and into the systemic circulation if oral delivery is intended. Moreover, the conjugates of the invention maintain a degree of bioactivity as well as bioavailability in their conjugated form in comparison to the bioactivity and bioavailability of the compound free of all oligomers.\n\n\nWith respect to the blood-brain barrier (“BBB”), this barrier restricts the transport of drugs from the blood to the brain. This barrier consists of a continuous layer of unique endothelial cells joined by tight junctions. The cerebral capillaries, which comprise more than 95% of the total surface area of the BBB, represent the principal route for the entry of most solutes and drugs into the central nervous system,\n\n\nFor compounds whose degree of blood-brain barrier crossing ability is not readily known, such ability can be determined using a suitable animal model such as an in situ rat brain perfusion (“RBP”) model as described herein. Briefly, the RBP technique involves cannulation of the carotid artery followed by perfusion with a compound solution under controlled conditions, followed by a wash out phase to remove compound remaining in the vascular space. (Such analyses can be conducted, for example, by contract research organizations such as Absorption Systems, Exton, Pa.). More specifically, in the RBP model, a cannula is placed in the left carotid artery and the side branches are tied off. A physiologic buffer containing the analyte (typically but not necessarily at a 5 micromolar concentration level) is perfused at a flow rate of about 10 mL/minute in a single pass perfusion experiment. After 30 seconds, the perfusion is stopped and the brain vascular contents are washed out with compound-free buffer for an additional 30 seconds. The brain tissue is then removed and analyzed for compound concentrations via liquid chromatograph with tandem mass spectrometry detection (LC/MS/MS). Alternatively, blood-brain barrier permeability can be estimated based upon a calculation of the compound's molecular polar surface area (“PSA”), which is defined as the sum of surface contributions of polar atoms (usually oxygens, nitrogens and attached hydrogens) in a molecule. The PSA has been shown to correlate with compound transport properties such as blood-brain barrier transport. Methods for determining a compound's PSA can be found, e.g., in, Ertl, P., et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n2000, 43, 3714-3717; and Kelder, J., et al, \nPharm. Res. \n1999, 16, 1514-1519.\n\n\nWith respect to the blood-brain barrier, the water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer-small molecule drug conjugate exhibits a blood-brain barrier crossing rate that is reduced as compared to the crossing rate of the small molecule drug not attached to the water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer. Preferred exemplary reductions in blood-brain barrier crossing rates for the compounds described herein include reductions of: at least about 30%; at least about 40%; at least about 50%; at least about 60%; at least about 70%; at least about 80%; or at least about 90%, when compared to the blood-brain barrier crossing rate of the small molecule drug not attached to the water-soluble oligomer. A preferred reduction in the blood-brain barrier crossing rate for a conjugate is at least about 20%.\n\n\nAs indicated above, the compounds of the invention include a residue of an opioid agonist. Assays for determining whether a given compound (regardless of whether the compound is in conjugated form or not) can act as an agonist on a mu receptor or a kappa receptors are described infra.\n\n\nIn some instances, opioid agonists can be obtained from commercial sources. In addition, opioid agonists can be obtained through chemical synthesis. Synthetic approaches for preparing opioid agonists are described in the literature and in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,628,962, 2,654,756, 2,649,454, and 2,806,033.\n\n\nEach of these (and other) opioid agonists can be covalently attached (either directly or through one or more atoms) to a water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer.\n\n\nSmall molecule drugs useful in the invention generally have a molecular weight of less than 1000 Da. Exemplary molecular weights of small molecule drugs include molecular weights of: less than about 950; less than about 900; less than about 850; less than about 800; less than about 750; less than about 700; less than about 650; less than about 600; less than about 550; less than about 500; less than about 450; less than about 400; less than about 350; and less than about 300.\n\n\nThe small molecule drug used in the invention, if chiral, may be in a racemic mixture, or an optically active form, for example, a single optically active enantiomer, or any combination or ratio of enantiomers (i.e., scalemic mixture). In addition, the small molecule drug may possess one or more geometric isomers. With respect to geometric isomers, a composition can comprise a single geometric isomer or a mixture of two or more geometric isomers. A small molecule drug for use in the present invention can be in its customary active form, or may possess some degree of modification. For example, a small molecule drug may have a targeting agent, tag, or transporter attached thereto, prior to or after covalent attachment of an oligomer. Alternatively, the small molecule drug may possess a lipophilic moiety attached thereto, such as a phospholipid (e.g., distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine or “DSPE,” dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine or “DPPE,” and so forth) or a small fatty acid. In some instances, however, it is preferred that the small molecule drug moiety does not include attachment to a lipophilic moiety.\n\n\nThe opioid agonist for coupling to a water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer possesses a free hydroxyl, carboxyl, thio, amino group, or the like (i.e., “handle”) suitable for covalent attachment to the oligomer. In addition, the opioid agonist can be modified by introduction of a reactive group, preferably by conversion of one of its existing functional groups to a functional group suitable for formation of a stable covalent linkage between the oligomer and the drug.\n\n\nAccordingly, each oligomer is composed of up to three different monomer types selected from the group consisting of: alkylene oxide, such as ethylene oxide or propylene oxide; olefinic alcohol, such as vinyl alcohol, 1-propenol or 2-propenol; vinyl pyrrolidone; hydroxyalkyl methacrylamide or hydroxyalkyl methacrylate, where alkyl is preferably methyl; α-hydroxy acid, such as lactic acid or glycolic acid; phosphazene, oxazoline, amino acids, carbohydrates such as monosaccharides, saccharide or mannitol; and N-acryloylmorpholine. Preferred monomer types include alkylene oxide, olefinic alcohol, hydroxyalkyl methacrylamide or methacrylate, N-acryloylmorpholine, and α-hydroxy acid. Preferably, each oligomer is, independently, a co-oligomer of two monomer types selected from this group, or, more preferably, is a homo-oligomer of one monomer type selected from this group.\n\n\nThe two monomer types in a co-oligomer may be of the same monomer type, for example, two alkylene oxides, such as ethylene oxide and propylene oxide. Preferably, the oligomer is a homo-oligomer of ethylene oxide. Usually, although not necessarily, the terminus (or termini) of the oligomer that is not covalently attached to a small molecule is capped to render it unreactive. Alternatively, the terminus may include a reactive group. When the terminus is a reactive group, the reactive group is either selected such that it is unreactive under the conditions of formation of the final oligomer or during covalent attachment of the oligomer to a small molecule drug, or it is protected as necessary. One common end-functional group is hydroxyl or —OH, particularly for oligoethylene oxides.\n\n\nThe water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer (e.g., “POLY” in various structures provided herein) can have any of a number of different geometries. For example, it can be linear, branched, or forked. Most typically, the water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer is linear or is branched, for example, having one branch point. Although much of the discussion herein is focused upon poly(ethylene oxide) as an illustrative oligomer, the discussion and structures presented herein can be readily extended to encompass any of the water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomers described above.\n\n\nThe molecular weight of the water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer, excluding the linker portion, is generally relatively low. Exemplary values of the molecular weight of the water-soluble polymer include: below about 1500; below about 1450; below about 1400; below about 1350; below about 1300; below about 1250; below about 1200; below about 1150; below about 1100; below about 1050; below about 1000; below about 950; below about 900; below about 850; below about 800; below about 750; below about 700; below about 650; below about 600; below about 550; below about 500; below about 450; below about 400; below about 350; below about 300; below about 250; below about 200; and below about 100 Daltons.\n\n\nExemplary ranges of molecular weights of the water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer (excluding the linker) include: from about 100 to about 1400 Daltons; from about 100 to about 1200 Daltons; from about 100 to about 800 Daltons; from about 100 to about 500 Daltons; from about 100 to about 400 Daltons; from about 200 to about 500 Daltons; from about 200 to about 400 Daltons; from about 75 to 1000 Daltons; and from about 75 to about 750 Daltons.\n\n\nPreferably, the number of monomers in the water-soluble non-peptidic oligomer falls within one or more of the following ranges: between about 1 and about 30 (inclusive); between about 1 and about 25; between about 1 and about 20; between about 1 and about 15; between about 1 and about 12; between about 1 and about 10. In certain instances, the number of monomers in series in the oligomer (and the corresponding conjugate) is one of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8. In additional embodiments, the oligomer (and the corresponding conjugate) contains 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20 monomers. In yet further embodiments, the oligomer (and the corresponding conjugate) possesses 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 or 30 monomers in series. Thus, for example, when the water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer includes CH\n3\n—(OCH\n2\nCH\n2\n)\nn\n—, “n” is an integer that can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 or 30, and can fall within one or more of the following ranges: between about 1 and about 25; between about 1 and about 20; between about 1 and about 15; between about 1 and about 12; between about 1 and about 10.\n\n\nWhen the water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 monomers, these values correspond to a methoxy end-capped oligo(ethylene oxide) having a molecular weights of about 75, 119, 163, 207, 251, 295, 339, 383, 427, and 471 Daltons, respectively. When the oligomer has 11, 12, 13, 14, or 15 monomers, these values correspond to methoxy end-capped oligo(ethylene oxide) having molecular weights corresponding to about 515, 559, 603, 647, and 691 Daltons, respectively.\n\n\nWhen the water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer is attached to the opioid agonist (in contrast to the step-wise addition of one or more monomers to effectively “grow” the oligomer onto the opioid agonist), it is preferred that the composition containing an activated form of the water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer be monodispersed. In those instances, however, where a bimodal composition is employed, the composition will possess a bimodal distribution centering around any two of the above numbers of monomers. Ideally, the polydispersity index of each peak in the bimodal distribution, Mw/Mn, is 1.01 or less, and even more preferably, is 1.001 or less, and even more preferably is 1.0005 or less. Most preferably, each peak possesses a MW/Mn value of 1.0000. For instance, a bimodal oligomer may have any one of the following exemplary combinations of monomer subunits: 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, 1-5, 1-6, 1-7, 1-8, 1-9, 1-10, and so forth; 2-3, 2-4, 2-5, 2-6, 2-7, 2-8, 2-9, 2-10, and so forth; 3-4, 3-5, 3-6, 3-7, 3-8, 3-9, 3-10, and so forth; 4-5, 4-6, 4-7, 4-8, 4-9, 4-10, and so forth; 5-6, 5-7, 5-8, 5-9, 5-10, and so forth; 6-7, 6-8, 6-9, 6-10, and so forth; 7-8, 7-9, 7-10, and so forth; and 8-9, 8-10, and so forth.\n\n\nIn some instances, the composition containing an activated form of the water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer will be trimodal or even tetramodal, possessing a range of monomers units as previously described. Oligomer compositions possessing a well-defined mixture of oligomers (i.e., being bimodal, trimodal, tetrainodal, and so forth) can be prepared by mixing purified monodisperse oligomers to obtain a desired profile of oligomers (a mixture of two oligomers differing only in the number of monomers is bimodal; a mixture of three oligomers differing only in the number of monomers is trimodal; a mixture of four oligomers differing only in the number of monomers is tetramodal), or alternatively, can be obtained from column chromatography of a polydisperse oligomer by recovering the “center cut”, to obtain a mixture of oligomers in a desired and defined molecular weight range.\n\n\nIt is preferred that the water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer is obtained from a composition that is preferably unimolecular or monodisperse. That is, the oligomers in the composition possess the same discrete molecular weight value rather than a distribution of molecular weights. Some monodisperse oligomers can be purchased from commercial sources such as those available from Sigma-Aldrich, or alternatively, can be prepared directly from commercially available starting materials such as Sigma-Aldrich. Water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomers can be prepared as described in Chen Y., Baker, G. L., J. Org. Chem., 6870-6873 (1999), WO 02/098949, and U.S. Patent Application Publication 2005/0136031.\n\n\nWhen present, the spacer moiety (through which the water-soluble, non-peptidic polymer is attached to the opioid agonist) may be a single bond, a single atom, such as an oxygen atom or a sulfur atom, two atoms, or a number of atoms. A spacer moiety is typically but is not necessarily linear in nature. The spacer moiety, “X” is preferably hydrolytically stable, and is preferably also enzymatically stable. Preferably, the spacer moiety “X” is one having a chain length of less than about 12 atoms, and preferably less than about 10 atoms, and even more preferably less than about 8 atoms and even more preferably less than about 5 atoms, whereby length is meant the number of atoms in a single chain, not counting substituents. For instance, a urea linkage such as this, R\noligomer\n—NH—(C═O)—NH—R′\ndrug\n, is considered to have a chain length of 3 atoms (—\nN\nH—\nC\n(O)—\nN\nH—). In selected embodiments, the spacer moiety linkage does not comprise further spacer groups.\n\n\nIn some instances, the spacer moiety “X” comprises an ether, amide, urethane, amine, thioether, urea, or a carbon-carbon bond. Functional groups such as those discussed below, and illustrated in the examples, are typically used for forming the linkages. The spacer moiety may less preferably also comprise (or be adjacent to or flanked by) spacer groups, as described further below.\n\n\nMore specifically, in selected embodiments, a spacer moiety, X, may be any of the following: “—” (i.e., a covalent bond, that may be stable or degradable, between the residue of the small molecule opioid agonist and the water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer), —C(O)O—, —OC(O)—, —CH\n2\n—C(O)O—, —CH\n2\n—OC(O)—, —C(O)O—CH\n2\n—, —OC(O)—CH\n2\n, —O—, —NH—, —S—, —C(O)—, C(O)—NH, NH—C(O)—NH, O—C(O)—NH, —C(S)—, —CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —O—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—O—, —O—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—O—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—O—, —O—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—O—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—O—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—O—, —O—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—O—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—O—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—O—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—O—, —C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—, —C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—C(O)—NH—, —C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—C(O)—NH—, —C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—C(O)—NH —, —NH—C(O)—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—NH—C(O)—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—NH—C(O)—CH\n2\n—, —NH—C(O)—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—NH—C(O)—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—NH—C(O)—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n, —C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—, —C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —O—C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—, —O—C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —NH—CH\n2\n—, —NH—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—NH—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—NH—CH\n2\n—, —C(O)—CH\n2\n—, —C(O)—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—C(O)—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—C(O)—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—C(O)—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—C(O)—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—NH—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—NH—C(O)—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—NH—C(O)—CH\n2\n—, bivalent cycloalkyl group, —N(R\n6\n)—, R\n6 \nis H or an organic radical selected from the group consisting of alkyl, substituted alkyl, alkenyl, substituted alkenyl, alkynyl, substituted alkynyl, aryl and substituted aryl.\n\n\nFor purposes of the present invention, however, a group of atoms is not considered a spacer moiety when it is immediately adjacent to an oligomer segment, and the group of atoms is the same as a monomer of the oligomer such that the group would represent a mere extension of the oligomer chain.\n\n\nThe linkage “X” between the water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer and the small molecule is typically formed by reaction of a functional group on a terminus of the oligomer (or one or more monomers when it is desired to “grow” the oligomer onto the opioid agonist) with a corresponding functional group within the opioid agonist. Illustrative reactions are described briefly below. For example, an amino group on an oligomer may be reacted with a carboxylic acid or an activated carboxylic acid derivative on the small molecule, or vice versa, to produce an amide linkage. Alternatively, reaction of an amine on an oligomer with an activated carbonate (e.g. succinimidyl or benzotriazyl carbonate) on the drug, or vice versa, forms a carbamate linkage. Reaction of an amine on an oligomer with an isocyanate (R—N═C═O) on a drug, or vice versa, forms a urea linkage (R—NH—(C═O)—NH—R′). Further, reaction of an alcohol (alkoxide) group on an oligomer with an alkyl halide, or halide group within a drug, or vice versa, forms an ether linkage. In yet another coupling approach, a small molecule having an aldehyde function is coupled to an oligomer amino group by reductive amination, resulting in formation of a secondary amine linkage between the oligomer and the small molecule.\n\n\nA particularly preferred water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer is an oligomer bearing an aldehyde functional group. In this regard, the oligomer will have the following structure: CH\n3\nO—(CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—O)\nn\n—(CH\n2\n)\np\n—C(O)H, wherein (n) is one of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 and (p) is one of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. Preferred (n) values include 3, 5 and 7 and preferred (p) values 2, 3 and 4. In addition, the carbon atom alpha to the —C(O)H moiety can optionally be substituted with alkyl.\n\n\nTypically, the terminus of the water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer not bearing a functional group is capped to render it unreactive. When the oligomer does include a further functional group at a terminus other than that intended for formation of a conjugate, that group is either selected such that it is unreactive under the conditions of formation of the linkage “X,” or it is protected during the formation of the linkage “X.”\n\n\nAs stated above, the water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer includes at least one functional group prior to conjugation. The functional group typically comprises an electrophilic or nucleophilic group for covalent attachment to a small molecule, depending upon the reactive group contained within or introduced into the small molecule. Examples of nucleophilic groups that may be present in either the oligomer or the small molecule include hydroxyl, amine, hydrazine (—NHNH\n2\n), hydrazide (—C(O)NHNH\n2\n), and thiol. Preferred nucleophiles include amine, hydrazine, hydrazide, and thiol, particularly amine. Most small molecule drugs for covalent attachment to an oligomer will possess a free hydroxyl, amino, thio, aldehyde, ketone, or carboxyl group.\n\n\nExamples of electrophilic functional groups that may be present in either the oligomer or the small molecule include carboxylic acid, carboxylic ester, particularly imide esters, orthoester, carbonate, isocyanate, isothiocyanate, aldehyde, ketone, thione, alkenyl, acrylate, methacrylate, acrylamide, sulfone, maleimide, disulfide, iodo, epoxy, sulfonate, thiosulfonate, silane, alkoxysilane, and halosilane. More specific examples of these groups include succinimidyl ester or carbonate, imidazoyl ester or carbonate, benzotriazole ester or carbonate, vinyl sulfone, chloroethylsulfone, vinylpyridine, pyridyl disulfide, iodoacetamide, glyoxal, dione, mesylate, tosylate, and tresylate (2,2,2-trifluoroethanesulfonate).\n\n\nAlso included are sulfur analogs of several of these groups, such as thione, thione hydrate, thioketal, is 2-thiazolidine thione, etc., as well as hydrates or protected derivatives of any of the above moieties (e.g. aldehyde hydrate, hemiacetal, acetal, ketone hydrate, hemiketal, ketal, thioketal, thioacetal).\n\n\nAn “activated derivative” of a carboxylic acid refers to a carboxylic acid derivative which reacts readily with nucleophiles, generally much more readily than the underivatized carboxylic acid. Activated carboxylic acids include, for example, acid halides (such as acid chlorides), anhydrides, carbonates, and esters. Such esters include imide esters, of the general form —(CO)O—N[(CO)—]\n2\n; for example, N-hydroxysuccinimidyl (NHS) esters or N-hydroxyphthalimidyl esters. Also preferred are imidazolyl esters and benzotriazole esters. Particularly preferred are activated propionic acid or butanoic acid esters, as described in co-owned U.S. Pat. No. 5,672,662. These include groups of the form —(CH\n2\n)\n2-3\nC(═O)O-Q, where Q is preferably selected from N-succinimide, N-sulfosuccinimide, N-phthalimide, N-glutarimide, N-tetrahydrophthalimide, N-norbornene-2,3-dicarboximide, benzotriazole, 7-azabenzotriazole, and imidazole.\n\n\nOther preferred electrophilic groups include succinimidyl carbonate, maleimide, benzotriazole carbonate, glycidyl ether, imidazoyl carbonate, p-nitrophenyl carbonate, acrylate, tresylate, aldehyde, and orthopyridyl disulfide.\n\n\nThese electrophilic groups are subject to reaction with nucleophiles, e.g. hydroxy, thio, or amino groups, to produce various bond types. Preferred for the present invention are reactions which favor formation of a hydrolytically stable linkage. For example, carboxylic acids and activated derivatives thereof, which include orthoesters, succinimidyl esters, imidazolyl esters, and benzotriazole esters, react with the above types of nucleophiles to form esters, thioesters, and amides, respectively, of which amides are the most hydrolytically stable. Carbonates, including succinimidyl, imidazolyl, and benzotriazole carbonates, react with amino groups to form carbamates. Isocyanates (R—N═C═O) react with hydroxyl or amino groups to form, respectively, carbamate (RNH—C(O)—OR′) or urea (RNH—C(O)—NHR′) linkages. Aldehydes, ketones, glyoxals, diones and their hydrates or alcohol adducts (i.e. aldehyde hydrate, hemiacetal, acetal, ketone hydrate, hemiketal, and ketal) are preferably reacted with amines, followed by reduction of the resulting imine, if desired, to provide an amine linkage (reductive amination).\n\n\nSeveral of the electrophilic functional groups include electrophilic double bonds to which nucleophilic groups, such as thiols, can be added, to form, for example, thioether bonds. These groups include maleimides, vinyl sulfones, vinyl pyridine, acrylates, methacrylates, and acrylamides. Other groups comprise leaving groups that can be displaced by a nucleophile; these include chloroethyl sulfone, pyridyl disulfides (which include a cleavable S—S bond), iodoacetamide, mesylate, tosylate, thiosulfonate, and tresylate. Epoxides react by ring opening by a nucleophile, to form, for example, an ether or amine bond. Reactions involving complementary reactive groups such as those noted above on the oligomer and the small molecule are utilized to prepare the conjugates of the invention.\n\n\nIn some instances the opioid agonist may not have a functional group suited for conjugation. In this instance, it is possible to modify the “original” opioid agonist so that it does have the desired functional group. For example, if the opioid agonist has an amide group, but an amine group is desired, it is possible to modify the amide group to an amine group by way of a Hofmann rearrangement, Curtius rearrangement (once the amide is converted to an azide) or Lossen rearrangement (once amide is concerted to hydroxamide followed by treatment with tolyene-2-sulfonyl chloride/base).\n\n\nIt is possible to prepare a conjugate of small molecule opioid agonist bearing a carboxyl group wherein the carboxyl group-bearing small molecule opioid agonist is coupled to an amino-terminated oligomeric ethylene glycol, to provide a conjugate having an amide group covalently linking the small molecule opioid agonist to the oligomer. This can be performed, for example, by combining the carboxyl group-bearing small molecule opioid agonist with the amino-terminated oligomeric ethylene glycol in the presence of a coupling reagent, (such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or “DCC”) in an anhydrous organic solvent.\n\n\nFurther, it is possible to prepare a conjugate of a small molecule opioid agonist bearing a hydroxyl group wherein the hydroxyl group-bearing small molecule opioid agonist is coupled to an oligomeric ethylene glycol halide to result in an ether (—O—) linked small molecule conjugate. This can be performed, for example, by using sodium hydride to deprotonate the hydroxyl group followed by reaction with a halide-terminated oligomeric ethylene glycol.\n\n\nIn another example, it is possible to prepare a conjugate of a small molecule opioid agonist bearing a ketone group by first reducing the ketone group to form the corresponding hydroxyl group. Thereafter, the small molecule opioid agonist now bearing a hydroxyl group can be coupled as described herein.\n\n\nIn still another instance, it is possible to prepare a conjugate of a small molecule opioid agonist bearing an amine group. In one approach, the amine group-bearing small molecule opioid agonist and an aldehyde-bearing oligomer are dissolved in a suitable buffer after which a suitable reducing agent (e.g., NaCNBH\n3\n) is added. Following reduction, the result is an amine linkage formed between the amine group of the amine group-containing small molecule opioid agonist and the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde-bearing oligomer.\n\n\nIn another approach for preparing a conjugate of a small molecule opioid agonist bearing an amine group, a carboxylic acid-bearing oligomer and the amine group-bearing small molecule opioid agonist are combined, typically in the presence of a coupling reagent (e.g., DCC). The result is an amide linkage formed between the amine group of the amine group-containing small molecule opioid agonist and the carbonyl of the carboxylic acid-bearing oligomer.\n\n\nExemplary conjugates of the opioid agonists of Formula I include those having the following structure:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein each of R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, the dotted line (“---”), Y\n1 \nand R\n5 \nis as previously defined with respect to Formula I, X is a spacer moiety and POLY is a water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer.\n\n\n\nAdditional exemplary conjugates of the opioid agonists of Formula I include those having the following structure:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein each of R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, the dotted line (“---”), and Y\n1 \nis as previously defined with respect to Formula I, X is a spacer moiety and POLY is a water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer.\n\n\n\nFurther additional exemplary conjugates of the opioid agonists of Formula I include those having the following structure:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein each of R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, Y\n1 \nand R\n5 \nis as previously defined with respect to Formula I, X is a spacer moiety and POLY is a water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer.\n\n\n\nStill further exemplary conjugates of the opioid agonists of Formula I include those having the following structure:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein each of R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, Y\n1 \nand R\n5 \nis as previously defined with respect to Formula I, X is a spacer moiety and POLY is a water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer.\n\n\n\nAdditional exemplary conjugates of the opioid agonists of Formula I include those having the following structure:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein each of R\n1\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, the dotted line (“---”), Y\n1 \nand R\n5 \nis as previously defined with respect to Formula I, X is a spacer moiety and POLY is a water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer.\n\n\n\nAdditional exemplary conjugates are encompassed by the following formulae:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein, when present, each of R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, the dotted line (“---”), Y\n1 \nand R\n5 \nis as previously defined with respect to Formula I, and the variable “n” is an integer from 1 to 30.\n\n\nExemplary conjugates of the opioid agonists of Formula II include those having the following structure:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein:\n\n\n\nN* is nitrogen;\n\n\nAr is selected from the group consisting of cyclohexyl, phenyl, halophenyl, methoxyphenyl, aminophenyl, pyridyl, furyl and thienyl;\n\n\nAlk is selected from the group consisting of ethylene and propylene;\n\n\nR\nII \nis selected from the group consisting of lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, dimethylamino, cyclopropyl, 1-pyrrolidyl, morpholino (preferably lower alkyl such as ethyl);\n\n\nR\nII′\n is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, methyl and methoxy;\n\n\nR\nII″\n is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and an organic radical (preferably lower alkyl);\n\n\nX is a linker (e.g., a covalent bond “—” or one or more atoms);

and\n\n\nPOLY is a water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer.\n\n\nThe conjugates of the invention can exhibit a reduced blood-brain barrier crossing rate. Moreover, the conjugates maintain at least about 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, or more of the bioactivity of the unmodified parent small molecule drug.\n\n\nWhile it is believed that the full scope of the conjugates disclosed herein have been described, an optimally sized oligomer can be determined as follows.\n\n\nFirst, an oligomer obtained from a monodisperse or bimodal water soluble oligomer is conjugated to the small molecule drug. Preferably, the drug is orally bioavailable, and on its own, exhibits a non-negligible blood-brain barrier crossing rate. Next, the ability of the conjugate to cross the blood-brain barrier is determined using an appropriate model and compared to that of the unmodified parent drug. If the results are favorable, that is to say, if, for example, the rate of crossing is significantly reduced, then the bioactivity of conjugate is further evaluated. Preferably, the compounds according to the invention maintain a significant degree of bioactivity relative to the parent drug, i.e., greater than about 30% of the bioactivity of the parent drug, or even more preferably, greater than about 50% of the bioactivity of the parent drug.\n\n\nThe above steps are repeated one or more times using oligomers of the same monomer type but having a different number of subunits and the results are compared.\n\n\nFor each conjugate whose ability to cross the blood-brain barrier is reduced in comparison to the non-conjugated small molecule drug, its oral bioavailability is then assessed. Based upon these results, that is to say, based upon the comparison of conjugates of oligomers of varying size to a given small molecule at a given position or location within the small molecule, it is possible to determine the size of the oligomer most effective in providing a conjugate having an optimal balance between reduction in biological membrane crossing, oral bioavailability, and bioactivity. The small size of the oligomers makes such screenings feasible, and allows one to effectively tailor the properties of the resulting conjugate. By making small, incremental changes in oligomer size, and utilizing an experimental design approach, one can effectively identify a conjugate having a favorable balance of reduction in biological membrane crossing rate, bioactivity, and oral bioavailability. In some instances, attachment of an oligomer as described herein is effective to actually increase oral bioavailability of the drug.\n\n\nFor example, one of ordinary skill in the art, using routine experimentation, can determine a best suited molecular size and linkage for improving oral bioavailability by first preparing a series of oligomers with different weights and functional groups and then obtaining the necessary clearance profiles by administering the conjugates to a patient and taking periodic blood and/or urine sampling. Once a series of clearance profiles have been obtained for each tested conjugate, a suitable conjugate can be identified.\n\n\nAnimal models (rodents and dogs) can also be used to study oral drug transport. In addition, non-in vivo methods include rodent everted gut excised tissue and Caco-2 cell monolayer tissue-culture models. These models are useful in predicting oral drug bioavailability.\n\n\nTo determine whether the opioid agonist or the conjugate of an opioid agonist and a water-soluble non-peptidic oligomer has activity as mu opioid receptor agonist, it is possible to test such a compound. For example, K\nD \n(binding affinity) and B\nmax \n(receptor number) can be determined using an approach modified from that described in Malatynska et al. (1995) NeuroReport 6:613-616. Briefly, human mu receptors can be recombinantly expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. The radioligand [\n3\nH]-diprenorphine (30-50 Ci/mmol) with a final ligand concentration of [0.3 nM] can be used. Naloxone is used as a non-specific determinate [3.0 nM], a reference compound and positive control. Reactions are carried out in 50 mM TRIS-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 5 mM MgCl\n2\n, at 25° C. for 150 minutes. The reaction is terminated by rapid vacuum filtration onto glass fiber filters. Radioactivity trapped onto filters is determined and compared to control values in order to ascertain any interactions of test compound with the cloned mu binding site.\n\n\nSimilar testing can be performed for kappa opioid receptor agonist. See, for example, Lahti et al. (1985) Eur. Jrnl. Pharmac. 109:281-284; Rothman et al. (1992) Peptides 13:977-987; Kinouchi et al. (1991) Eur. Jrnl. Pharmac. 207:135-141. Briefly, human kappa receptors can be obtained from guinea pig cerebellar membranes. The radioligand [\n3\nH]-U-69593 (40-60 Ci/mmol) with a final ligand concentration of [0.75 nM] can be used. U-69593 is used as a non-specific determinate [1.0 μM], a reference compound and positive control. Reactions are carried out in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) at 30° C. for 120 minutes. The reaction is terminated by rapid vacuum filtration onto glass fiber filters. Radioactivity trapped onto filters is determined and compared to control values in order to ascertain any interactions of test compound with the cloned kappa binding site.\n\n\nThe conjugates described herein include not only the conjugates themselves, but the conjugates in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt as well. A conjugate as described herein can possess a sufficiently acidic group, a sufficiently basic group, or both functional groups, and, accordingly, react with any of a number of inorganic bases, and inorganic and organic acids, to form a salt. Acids commonly employed to form acid addition salts are inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like, and organic acids such as p-toluenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, oxalic acid, p-bromophenyl-sulfonic acid, carbonic acid, succinic acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, acetic acid, and the like.

Such bases useful in preparing the salts of this invention thus include sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, and the like.\n\n\nThe present invention also includes pharmaceutical preparations comprising a conjugate as provided herein in combination with a pharmaceutical excipient. Generally, the conjugate itself will be in a solid form (e.g., a precipitate), which can be combined with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient that can be in either solid or liquid form.\n\n\nExemplary excipients include, without limitation, those selected from the group consisting of carbohydrates, inorganic salts, antimicrobial agents, antioxidants, surfactants, buffers, acids, bases, and combinations thereof.\n\n\nA carbohydrate such as a sugar, a derivatized sugar such as an alditol, aldonic acid, an esterified sugar, and/or a sugar polymer may be present as an excipient. Specific carbohydrate excipients include, for example: monosaccharides, such as fructose, maltose, galactose, glucose, D-mannose, sorbose, and the like; disaccharides, such as lactose, sucrose, trehalose, cellobiose, and the like; polysaccharides, such as raffinose, melezitose, maltodextrins, dextrans, starches, and the like; and alditols, such as mannitol, xylitol, maltitol, lactitol, xylitol, sorbitol (glucitol), pyranosyl sorbitol, myoinositol, and the like.\n\n\nThe excipient can also include an inorganic salt or buffer such as citric acid, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, sodium sulfate, potassium nitrate, sodium phosphate monobasic, sodium phosphate dibasic, and combinations thereof.\n\n\nThe preparation may also include an antimicrobial agent for preventing or deterring microbial growth. Nonlimiting examples of antimicrobial agents suitable for the present invention include benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, cetylpyridinium chloride, chlorobutanol, phenol, phenylethyl alcohol, phenylmercuric nitrate, thimersol, and combinations thereof.\n\n\nAn antioxidant can be present in the preparation as well. Antioxidants are used to prevent oxidation, thereby preventing the deterioration of the conjugate or other components of the preparation. Suitable antioxidants for use in the present invention include, for example, ascorbyl palmitate, butylated hydroxyanisole, butylated hydroxytoluene, hypophosphorous acid, monothioglycerol, propyl gallate, sodium bisulfite, sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate, sodium metabisulfite, and combinations thereof.\n\n\nA surfactant may be present as an excipient. Exemplary surfactants include: polysorbates, such as “\nTween\n 20” and “\nTween\n 80,” and pluronics such as F68 and F88 (both of which are available from BASF, Mount Olive, N.J.); sorbitan esters; lipids, such as phospholipids such as lecithin and other phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines (although preferably not in liposomal form), fatty acids and fatty esters; steroids, such as cholesterol; and chelating agents, such as EDTA, zinc and other such suitable cations.\n\n\nPharmaceutically acceptable acids or bases may be present as an excipient in the preparation. Nonlimiting examples of acids that can be used include those acids selected from the group consisting of hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, phosphoric acid, citric acid, malic acid, lactic acid, formic acid, trichloroacetic acid, nitric acid, perchloric acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, fumaric acid, and combinations thereof. Examples of suitable bases include, without limitation, bases selected from the group consisting of sodium hydroxide, sodium acetate, ammonium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonium acetate, potassium acetate, sodium phosphate, potassium phosphate, sodium citrate, sodium formate, sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, potassium fumerate, and combinations thereof.\n\n\nThe amount of the conjugate in the composition will vary depending on a number of factors, but will optimally be a therapeutically effective dose when the composition is stored in a unit dose container. A therapeutically effective dose can be determined experimentally by repeated administration of increasing amounts of the conjugate in order to determine which amount produces a clinically desired endpoint.\n\n\nThe amount of any individual excipient in the composition will vary depending on the activity of the excipient and particular needs of the composition. Typically, the optimal amount of any individual excipient is determined through routine experimentation, i.e., by preparing compositions containing varying amounts of the excipient (ranging from low to high), examining the stability and other parameters, and then determining the range at which optimal performance is attained with no significant adverse effects.\n\n\nGenerally, however, the excipient will be present in the composition in an amount of about 1% to about 99% by weight, preferably from about 5%-98% by weight, more preferably from about 15-95% by weight of the excipient, with concentrations less than 30% by weight most preferred.\n\n\nThese foregoing pharmaceutical excipients along with other excipients and general teachings regarding pharmaceutical compositions are described in “Remington: The Science & Practice of Pharmacy”, 19\nth \ned., Williams & Williams, (1995), the “Physician's Desk Reference”, 52\nnd \ned., Medical Economics, Montvale, N.J. (1998), and Kibbe, A. H., Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, 3\nrd \nEdition, American Pharmaceutical Association, Washington, D.C., 2000.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions can take any number of forms and the invention is not limited in this regard. Exemplary preparations are most preferably in a form suitable for oral administration such as a tablet, caplet, capsule, gel cap, troche, dispersion, suspension, solution, elixir, syrup, lozenge, transdermal patch, spray, suppository, and powder.\n\n\nOral dosage forms are preferred for those conjugates that are orally active, and include tablets, caplets, capsules, gel caps, suspensions, solutions, elixirs, and syrups, and can also comprise a plurality of granules, beads, powders or pellets that are optionally encapsulated. Such dosage forms are prepared using conventional methods known to those in the field of pharmaceutical formulation and described in the pertinent texts.\n\n\nTablets and caplets, for example, can be manufactured using standard tablet processing procedures and equipment. Direct compression and granulation techniques are preferred when preparing tablets or caplets containing the conjugates described herein. In addition to the conjugate, the tablets and caplets will generally contain inactive, pharmaceutically acceptable carrier materials such as binders, lubricants, disintegrants, fillers, stabilizers, surfactants, coloring agents, and the like. Binders are used to impart cohesive qualities to a tablet, and thus ensure that the tablet remains intact. Suitable binder materials include, but are not limited to, starch (including corn starch and pregelatinized starch), gelatin, sugars (including sucrose, glucose, dextrose and lactose), polyethylene glycol, waxes, and natural and synthetic gums, e.g., acacia sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulosic polymers (including hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, methyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, ethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, and the like), and Veegum. Lubricants are used to facilitate tablet manufacture, promoting powder flow and preventing particle capping (i.e., particle breakage) when pressure is relieved. Useful lubricants are magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, and stearic acid. Disintegrants are used to facilitate disintegration of the tablet, and are generally starches, clays, celluloses, algins, gums, or crosslinked polymers. Fillers include, for example, materials such as silicon dioxide, titanium dioxide, alumina, talc, kaolin, powdered cellulose, and microcrystalline cellulose, as well as soluble materials such as mannitol, urea, sucrose, lactose, dextrose, sodium chloride, and sorbitol. Stabilizers, as well known in the art, are used to inhibit or retard drug decomposition reactions that include, by way of example, oxidative reactions.\n\n\nCapsules are also preferred oral dosage forms, in which case the conjugate-containing composition can be encapsulated in the form of a liquid or gel (e.g., in the case of a gel cap) or solid (including particulates such as granules, beads, powders or pellets). Suitable capsules include hard and soft capsules, and are generally made of gelatin, starch, or a cellulosic material. Two-piece hard gelatin capsules are preferably sealed, such as with gelatin bands or the like.\n\n\nIncluded are parenteral formulations in the substantially dry form (typically as a lyophilizate or precipitate, which can be in the form of a powder or cake), as well as formulations prepared for injection, which are typically liquid and requires the step of reconstituting the dry form of parenteral formulation. Examples of suitable diluents for reconstituting solid compositions prior to injection include bacteriostatic water for injection, \ndextrose\n 5% in water, phosphate-buffered saline, Ringer's solution, saline, sterile water, deionized water, and combinations thereof.\n\n\nIn some cases, compositions intended for parenteral administration can take the form of nonaqueous solutions, suspensions, or emulsions, each typically being sterile. Examples of nonaqueous solvents or vehicles are propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils, such as olive oil and corn oil, gelatin, and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate.\n\n\nThe parenteral formulations described herein can also contain adjuvants such as preserving, wetting, emulsifying, and dispersing agents. The formulations are rendered sterile by incorporation of a sterilizing agent, filtration through a bacteria-retaining filter, irradiation, or heat.\n\n\nThe conjugate can also be administered through the skin using conventional transdermal patch or other transdermal delivery system, wherein the conjugate is contained within a laminated structure that serves as a drug delivery device to be affixed to the skin. In such a structure, the conjugate is contained in a layer, or “reservoir,” underlying an upper backing layer. The laminated structure can contain a single reservoir, or it can contain multiple reservoirs.\n\n\nThe conjugate can also be formulated into a suppository for rectal administration. With respect to suppositories, the conjugate is mixed with a suppository base material which is (e.g., an excipient that remains solid at room temperature but softens, melts or dissolves at body temperature) such as coca butter (theobroma oil), polyethylene glycols, glycerinated gelatin, fatty acids, and combinations thereof. Suppositories can be prepared by, for example, performing the following steps (not necessarily in the order presented): melting the suppository base material to form a melt; incorporating the conjugate (either before or after melting of the suppository base material); pouring the melt into a mold; cooling the melt (e.g., placing the melt-containing mold in a room temperature environment) to thereby form suppositories; and removing the suppositories from the mold.\n\n\nThe invention also provides a method for administering a conjugate as provided herein to a patient suffering from a condition that is responsive to treatment with the conjugate. The method comprises administering, generally orally, a therapeutically effective amount of the conjugate (preferably provided as part of a pharmaceutical preparation). Other modes of administration are also contemplated, such as pulmonary, nasal, buccal, rectal, sublingual, transdermal, and parenteral. As used herein, the term “parenteral” includes subcutaneous, intravenous, intra-arterial, intraperitoneal, intracardiac, intrathecal, and intramuscular injection, as well as infusion injections.\n\n\nIn instances where parenteral administration is utilized, it may be necessary to employ somewhat bigger oligomers than those described previously, with molecular weights ranging from about 500 to 30K Daltons (e.g., having molecular weights of about 500, 1000, 2000, 2500, 3000, 5000, 7500, 10000, 15000, 20000, 25000, 30000 or even more).\n\n\nThe method of administering may be used to treat any condition that can be remedied or prevented by administration of the particular conjugate. Those of ordinary skill in the art appreciate which conditions a specific conjugate can effectively treat. The actual dose to be administered will vary depend upon the age, weight, and general condition of the subject as well as the severity of the condition being treated, the judgment of the health care professional, and conjugate being administered. Therapeutically effective amounts are known to those skilled in the art and/or are described in the pertinent reference texts and literature. Generally, a therapeutically effective amount will range from about 0.001 mg to 1000 mg, preferably in doses from 0.01 mg/day to 750 mg/day, and more preferably in doses from 0.10 mg/day to 500 mg/day.\n\n\nThe unit dosage of any given conjugate (again, preferably provided as part of a pharmaceutical preparation) can be administered in a variety of dosing schedules depending on the judgment of the clinician, needs of the patient, and so forth. The specific dosing schedule will be known by those of ordinary skill in the art or can be determined experimentally using routine methods. Exemplary dosing schedules include, without limitation, administration five times a day, four times a day, three times a day, twice daily, once daily, three times weekly, twice weekly, once weekly, twice monthly, once monthly, and any combination thereof. Once the clinical endpoint has been achieved, dosing of the composition is halted.\n\n\nOne advantage of administering the conjugates of the present invention is that a reduction in first pass metabolism may be achieved relative to the parent drug. Such a result is advantageous for many orally administered drugs that are substantially metabolized by passage through the gut. In this way, clearance of the conjugate can be modulated by selecting the oligomer molecular size, linkage, and position of covalent attachment providing the desired clearance properties. One of ordinary skill in the art can determine the ideal molecular size of the oligomer based upon the teachings herein. Preferred reductions in first pass metabolism for a conjugate as compared to the corresponding nonconjugated small drug molecule include: at least about 10%, at least about 20%, at least about 30; at least about 40; at least about 50%; at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80% and at least about 90%.\n\n\nThus, the invention provides a method for reducing the metabolism of an active agent. The method comprises the steps of: providing monodisperse or bimodal conjugates, each conjugate comprised of a moiety derived from a small molecule drug covalently attached by a stable linkage to a water-soluble oligomer, wherein said conjugate exhibits a reduced rate of metabolism as compared to the rate of metabolism of the small molecule drug not attached to the water-soluble oligomer; and administering the conjugate to a patient. Typically, administration is carried out via one type of administration selected from the group consisting of oral administration, transdermal administration, buccal administration, transmucosal administration, vaginal administration, rectal administration, parenteral administration, and pulmonary administration.\n\n\nAlthough useful in reducing many types of metabolism (including both Phase I and Phase II metabolism) can be reduced, the conjugates are particularly useful when the small molecule drug is metabolized by a hepatic enzyme (e.g., one or more of the cytochrome P450 isoforms) and/or by one or more intestinal enzymes.\n\n\nAll articles, books, patents, patent publications and other publications referenced herein are incorporated by reference in their entireties. In the event of an inconsistency between the teachings of this specification and the art incorporated by reference, the meaning of the teachings in this specification shall prevail.\n\n\nEXPERIMENTAL\n\n\nIt is to be understood that while the invention has been described in conjunction with certain preferred and specific embodiments, the foregoing description as well as the examples that follow are intended to illustrate and not limit the scope of the invention. Other aspects, advantages and modifications within the scope of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art to which the invention pertains.\n\n\nAll chemical reagents referred to in the appended examples are commercially available unless otherwise indicated.

Cells were plated in 24 well plates at a density of 0.2-0.3* 10\n6 \ncells/well and washed with assay buffer containing 50 mM Tris.HCl and 5 mM MgCl\n2 \n(pH 7.4). Competition binding assays were conducted in whole cells incubated with increasing concentrations of test compounds in the presence of appropriate concentration of radioligand. 0.5 nM \n3\nH Naloxone, 0.5 nM \n3\nH Diprenorphine and 0.5 nM \n3\nH DPDPE were used as the competing radioligands for mu, kappa and delta receptors respectively. Incubations were carried out for two hours at room temperature using triplicate wells at each concentration. At the end of the incubation, cells were washed with 50 mM Tris HCl (pH 8.0), solubilized with NaOH and bound radioactivity was measured using a scintillation counter.\n\n\nSpecific binding is determined by subtraction of the cpm bound in the presence of 50-100× excess of cold ligand. Binding data assays were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 4.0 and IC50 is generated by non-linear regression from dose-response curves. Ki values were calculated using the Cheng Prusoff equation using the Kd values from saturation isotherms as follows: Ki=IC50/(1+[Ligand]/Kd).\n\n\nPEG conjugates of nalbuphine retain binding affinity to opioid receptors. Table 1 shows the binding affinity (Ki, in nM) for PEG conjugates of nalbuphine at the mu, delta and kappa opioid receptors. The loss in binding affinity following PEG conjugation is less than 15-fold that of parent nalbuphine at all three receptor subtypes. See Table I. PEG conjugation results in a 10-15 fold loss in binding affinity at the mu and kappa opioid receptors, but not at the delta opioid receptors. Binding affinity at the delta opioid receptor is comparable or even greater in some cases, than that of parent nalbuphine. See \nFIG. 1\n. The differential change in binding affinity at the three opioid receptor subtypes implies that the receptor selectivity of the nalbuphine conjugates is altered compared to the parent nalbuphine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBinding Activities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nKi at KAPPA\n\n\nFold vs\n\n\nKi at MU\n\n\nFold vs\n\n\nKi at DELTA\n\n\nFold vs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nreceptors\n\n\nNalbuphine\n\n\nReceptors\n\n\nNalbuphine\n\n\nReceptors\n\n\nNalbuphine\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMolecule\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\nat KAPPA\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\nAt MU\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\nAt DELTA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNalbuphine\n\n\n25.95\n\n\n1\n\n\n14.31\n\n\n1\n\n\n318.85\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3-O-mPEG\nn\n-\n\n\n—\n\n\n—\n\n\n—\n\n\n—\n\n\n—\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNalbuphine*\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n6-O-mPEG\n3\n-\n\n\n218.1\n\n\n8.40\n\n\n27.41\n\n\n1.92\n\n\n163.30\n\n\n0.51\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNalbuphine\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n6-O-mPEG\n4\n-\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n17.54\n\n\n1.23\n\n\n148.90\n\n\n0.47\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNalbuphine\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n6-O-mPEG\n5\n-\n\n\n35.56\n\n\n1.37\n\n\n35.09\n\n\n2.45\n\n\n147.70\n\n\n0.46\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNalbuphine\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n6-O-mPEG\n6\n-\n\n\n246.9\n\n\n9.51\n\n\n44.28\n\n\n3.09\n\n\n130.00\n\n\n0.41\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNalbuphine\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n6-O-mPEG\n7\n-\n\n\n346.1\n\n\n13.34\n\n\n77.94\n\n\n5.45\n\n\n313.80\n\n\n0.98\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNalbuphine\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n6-O-mPEG\n8\n-\n\n\n282.2\n\n\n10.87\n\n\n79.55\n\n\n5.56\n\n\n167.50\n\n\n0.53\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNalbuphine\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n6-O-mPEG\n9\n-\n\n\n186.1\n\n\n7.17\n\n\n122.30\n\n\n8.55\n\n\n157.70\n\n\n0.49\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNalbuphine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n*The “3-O-mPEG\nn\n-nalbuphine” series of molecules prepared in Example 1 showed no detectable binding activity; molecules wherein a water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer is covalently attached at the 3-O position are believed to have value when, for example, the covalent linkage is a degradable form of linkage.

PEG-nalbuphine conjugates are full agonists at kappa opioid receptors and antagonists at mu opioid receptors, similar to the pharmacological profile of nalbuphine. The EC\n50 \nof 6-O-mPEG\n3\n-Nalbuphine was similar to that of nalbuphine at the kappa opioid receptor, suggesting no loss of efficacy at this PEG size. Beyond a PEG size of 3, the efficacy of the PEG-nalbuphine conjugates at the kappa opioid receptor decreased as a function of PEG size, as indicated by the increase in EC\n50 \nvalues of 6-O-mPEG\n6\n-Nalbuphine, and 6-O-mPEG\n9\n-Nalbuphine. PEG-nalbuphines appeared to have an antagonist potency at the mu opioid receptor comparable to that of the parent nalbuphine. At the delta opioid receptor, 6-O-mPEG\n9\n-Nalbuphine, acted as a weak antagonistic, however, nalbuphine, 6-O-mPEG\n3\n-Nalbuphine, 6-O-mPEG\n6\n-Nalbuphine, had no effect at the delta opioid receptor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPEG-nalbuphine Conjugates Retain the in vitro\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPharmacological Properties of Parent Nabuphine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFunctional Assay GTP-γS Binding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nKappa\n\n\nMu\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAgonist\n\n\nAntagonist\n\n\nDelta\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMolecule\n\n\nEC50 (nM)\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNalbuphine\n\n\n25.1\n\n\n752\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n6-O-mPEG\n3\n-Nalbuphine\n\n\n26.80\n\n\n398.0\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6-O-mPEG\n6\n-Nalbuphine\n\n\n164.00\n\n\n284.0\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6-O-mPEG\n9\n-Nalbuphine\n\n\n485.00\n\n\n1010.0\n\n\n8970.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 9\n\n\nIn Vitro Permeability\n\n\nThe in vitro permeability of PEG-nalbuphine conjugates was measured using a bi-directional transport assay in Caco-2 cells. PEG-nalbuphine conjugates were added at a concentration of 10 μM to either the apical or basolateral compartment of Caco-2 monolayers and incubated for two hours. At the end of the incubation, the concentrations in the apical and basolateral compartments were measured using LC-MS. Permeability was calculated as Papp=J/A.Co, where Papp is the apparent permeability in cm/s, J is the flux in moles/s, A is the surface area of the insert in cm\n2 \nand Co is the initial concentration in moles/cm\n3\n.\n\n\n \nFIG. 2A\n shows the in vitro apparent permeability of PEG-nalbuphine conjugates measured in Caco-2 cells in the A-B (apical-basolateral) and B-A (basolateral-apical) direction. A-B permeability, and to a lesser extent, B-A permeability decrease with increasing PEG chain length. The A-B permeability, which represents mucosal-serosal transport in vivo is greater than 1*10\n−6 \ncm/s for all compounds, indicating that nalbuphine and PEG-nalbuphine conjugates are likely to be well absorbed orally.\n\n\n \nFIG. 2B\n shows the efflux ratio of PEG-nalbuphine conjugates, calculated as a ratio of B-A/A-B permeabilities. An efflux ratio greater than unity is a reflection of an asymmetry in transport in the apical-basolateral directions and suggests a role for transporters in the overall permeability. The efflux ratio for the parent nalbuphine is close to unity, indicating that it is not a likely substrate for transporters. However, 6-O-mPEG\n5\n-Nalbuphine, 6-O-mPEG\n6\n-Nalbuphine, 6-O-mPEG\n7\n-Nalbuphine, 6-O-mPEG\n8\n-Nalbuphine, and 6-O-mPEG\n9\n-Nalbuphine have an efflux ratio greater than 3, and hence are likely substrates for efflux transporters in Caco-2 cells.\n\n\nExample 10\n\n\nIn vivo Brain Penetration of PEG-Nalbuphine Conjugates\n\n\nThe ability of the PEG-nalbuphine conjugates to cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) and enter the CNS was measured using the brain:plasma ratio in rats. Briefly, rats were injected intravenously with 25 mg/kg of nalbuphine, PEG-nalbuphine conjugate or atenolol. An hour following injection, the animals were sacrificed and plasma and the brain were collected and frozen immediately. Following tissue and plasma extractions, concentrations of the compounds in brain and plasma were measured using LC-MS/MS. The brain:plasma ratio was calculated as the ratio of measured concentrations in the brain and plasma. Atenolol, which does not cross the BBB was used as a measure of vascular contamination of the brain tissue.\n\n\n \nFIG. 3\n shows the ratio of brain:plasma concentrations of PEG-nalbuphine conjugates. The brain:plasma ratio of nalbuphine was 2.86:1, indicating a nearly 3 fold greater concentration of nalbuphine in the brain compared to the plasma compartment. PEG conjugation significantly reduced the entry of nalbuphine into the CNS as evidenced by a lower brain:plasma ratio of the PEG-nalbuphine conjugates. Conjugation with 3 PEG units reduced the brain:plasma ratio to 0.23:1, indicating that the concentration of 6-O-mPEG\n3\n-Nalbuphine in brain was approximately 4 fold less than that in the plasma. 6-O-mPEG\n6\n-Nalbuphine and 6-O-mPEG\n9\n-Nalbuphine were significantly excluded from the CNS, since their brain:plasma ratios were not significantly different from the vascular marker, atenolol.\n\n\nExample 11\n\n\nPreparation of Oligomer-Fentanyl Conjugates\n\n\nmPEG\nn\n-O-fentanyl conjugates can be prepared following the approaches schematically shown below. Conventional organic synthetic techniques are used in carrying out the synthetic approaches.\n\n\nAn exemplary approach for preparing the following structures, where the PEG oligomer is positioned, i.e., covalently attached, at the N-(1-(2-phenylethyl)piperidin-4-yl)phenyl group:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[wherein mPEG\nn \nis —(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)\nn\n—CH\n3 \nand n is an integer from 1 to 9], is provided below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the above approach, the starting material is a (haloethyl)hydroxybenzene, where the hydroxy group forms the point of attachment for the PEG oligomer. The (haloethyl)hydroxybenzene, i.e., (bromoethyl)hydroxybenzene, is reacted with a mesylated or halogenated activated mPEG oligomer, thereby forming the desired PEG-oligomer modified (haloethyl)benzene intermediate. This intermediate is then reacted with piperidin-4-one in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst; the bromo group reacts at the piperidine-4-one nitrogen to form a next intermediate, 1-(mPEG\nolig\n-phenylethyl)piperidine-4-one. The ketone functionality is then reduced in the presence of a reducing agent such as sodium borohydride, and converted to an amino group, i.e., N-phenyl-piperidin-4-amine, by reaction with aniline. Finally, the secondary amino group is converted to a tertiary aniline by reaction with propionyl chloride to form the desired product as indicated in the scheme above.\n\n\nThe subject mPEG\nn\n-O-fentanyl conjugates having the PEG oligomer positioned at the N-(1-(2-phenylethyl)piperidin-4-yl)phenyl group were synthesized using a reaction scheme that was slightly modified from Scheme 11-A above as illustrated in Scheme 11-B below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above approach employs tosyl (p-toluenesulfonate) leaving groups at various steps in the synthesis. The desired PEG-oligomer conjugates (n=1 to 9) were assembled by reacting di-tosylated 3-(2-hydroxyethyl)phenol with N-phenyl-N-(piperidin-4-yl)propionamide to form N-(1-(3-hydroxyphenylethyl)piperidin-4-yl)-N-phenylpropionamide, in tosylated form, followed by removal of the tosyl group. The PEG-oligomer group was then introduced into the molecules at the phenyl hydroxyl position by reaction of N-(1-(3-hydroxyphenylethyl)piperidin-4-yl)-N-phenylpropionamide with a molar excess of mPEG\nolig\n-tosylate to form the desired mPEG\nn\n-O-fentanyl conjugates. Ratios of reactants and reaction conditions generally employed are provided in the reaction scheme above.\n\n\nAn exemplary approach for providing the following structures, where the PEG oligomer is positioned, i.e., covalently attached, at the N-phenyl group, is set forth below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above exemplary approach for forming an mPEG\nn\n-O-fentanyl conjugate having the PEG oligomer positioned at the N-phenyl ring starts with, e.g., 2-bromoethylbenzene, as the starting material. The 2-bromoethylbenzene is reacted with piperidin-4-one in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst to thereby form the resulting 1-phenethylpiperidin-4-one. The 1-phenethylpiperidin-4-one is coupled to mPEG\nolig\n-substituted aniline, which is prepared by taking N-protected hydroxyaniline and reacting it with activated mPEG oligomer, such as bromomethoxyPEG\nolig \nor mPEG\noligo \nmesylate, followed by removal of the protecting group (see step (b) above). As indicated in reaction step (c) above, 1-phenethylpiperidin-4-one is reacted with mPEG\nolig\n-substituted aniline in the presence of a reducing agent to convert the keto group into an amine to form the intermediate, 1-phenylethylpiperidin-4-ylamino-mPEG\nolig\nobenzene. Finally, the secondary amino group is converted to a tertiary amine by reaction with propionyl chloride to form the desired product as indicated in the scheme above.\n\n\nThe subject mPEG\nn\n-O′-fentanyl conjugates having the PEG oligomer positioned at the N-phenyl group were synthesized using a reaction scheme that was slightly modified from Scheme 11-C above as illustrated in Scheme 11-D below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs indicated in Scheme 11-D above, the desired mPEG\nn\n-O-fentanyl conjugates were prepared by first reacting 1-phenethylpiperidin-4-one with 3-aminophenol under reducing conditions to thereby convert the keto functionality into an amine, i.e., by reaction with the amino group of 3-aminophenol. The product, 3-(1-phenethylpiperidin-4-ylamino)phenol, was then reacted with propionic anhydride in the presence of base (e.g., triethyl amine) and dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) under conditions effective to form N-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-N-(1-phenethylpiperidin-4-yl)propionamide. Finally, introduction of the oligomeric PEG functionality was carried out by reacting the precursor, N-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-N-(1-phenethylpiperidin-4-yl)propionamide, with a molar excess of mPEG\noligo\ntosylate under coupling conditions effective to form the desired conjugates.

A biphasic mixture resulted upon addition: yellow solid on the bottom and clear supernatant. The ice bath was removed and the reaction was allowed to warm to room temperature overnight. At this point it was dissolved in water, extracted with CHCl\n3 \n(3×50 mL), washed with 0.1M HCl/\nbrine mixture\n 2×50 mL, followed by \nbrine\n 50 mL.

The mixture was made acidic with 1M HCl to result in clear biphasic solution. The organic phase was split off and the aqueous phase was carefully brought to pH 9.30 (monitored by a pH meter) using the same solution of K\n2\nCO\n3 \nas above. A white suspension resulted again. The heterogeneous mixture was extracted with DCM (5×25 ml) and an insoluble white solid contaminated both the organic and aqueous layers. The organic layer was dried with MgSO\n4\n, filtered and rotary evaporated to yield 160 mg of morphine free base (56% recovery).

To the resulting suspension was added 60 μl (0.52 mmol) of MEMCl and the mixture allowed to react at room temperature. It was sampled after one hour (38% nominal conversion, additional peaks at 1.69 min and 2.28 min), three hours (40% nominal conversion, additional peak at 1.72 min (M+1=493.2)), four and one-half hours (56% nominal conversion, additional peak at 1.73 min), and twenty-three hours (>99% nominal conversion, additional peak at 1.79 min—about 23% of the product peak by height in UV\n254\n); thereafter, the reaction was quenched with MeOH, evaporated, extracted with EtOAc to give 160 mg of clear oil.\n\n\nThe same reaction was repeated starting with 2 g (5.3 mmol) of morphine sulfate hydrate, 2.2 g (16 mmol, 3 eq) of K\n2\nCO\n3\n, 1.2 ml (10.5 mmol, 2 eq) of MEMCl in 100 ml of solvent mixture. Sampling occurred after two hours (61% nominal conversion, extra peak at 1.72 min (M+1=492.8)), after one day (80% nominal conversion, extra peak at 1.73 min), after three days (85% nominal conversion, only small impurities, 12 min gradient run), and after six days (91% conversion); thereafter, the reaction was quenched, evaporated, extracted with EtOAc, purified on combi-flash using a 40 g column, DCM:\nMeOH\n 0 to 30% mobile phase. Three peaks (instead of two) were identified, wherein the middle peak was collected, 1.15 g (58% yield) of light yellow oil, UV\n254 \npurity about 87%.\n\n\nConjugation of MEM-Protected Morphine to Provide a MEM-Protected Morphine Conjugate\n\n\nThe general approach for conjugating MEM-protected morphine with a water-soluble oligomer to provide a MEM-protected morphine PEG-oligomer conjugate is schematically shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo a solution of toluene/DMF (2:1 mixture, 10 volumes total) was charged MEM-morphine free base followed by NaH (4-6 eq) and then PEG\nn\nOMs (1.2-1.4 eq.), previously prepared. The reaction mixture was heated to 55-75° C. and was stirred until reaction completion was confirmed by LC-MS analysis (12-40 hours depending on PEG chain length). The reaction mixture was quenched with methanol (5 volumes) and the reaction mixture was evaporated to dryness in vacuo. The residue was redissolved in methanol (3 volumes) and was chromatographed using a Combiflash system (0-40% MeOH/DCM). The fractions containing large amounts of product were collected, combined and evaporated to dryness. This material was then purified by RP-HPLC to give the products as yellow to orange oils.\n\n\nDeprotection of MEM-Protected Morphine Conjugate to Provide a Morphine Conjugate\n\n\nThe general approach for deprotecting a MEM-protected morphine conjugate to provide a morphine conjugate is schematically shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo a solution of MEM-protected morphine conjugate TFA salt suspended in DCM (8 volumes) was charged 6 volumes of 2M HCl in diethyl ether. The reaction mixture was allowed to stir at room temperature for two hours and was then evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. The oily residue was dissolved in MeOH (8 volumes), filtered through glass wool and then evaporated under reduced pressure to give a thick orange to yellow oil in quantitative yield. Compounds made by this method include: α-6-mPEG\n3\n-O-morphine (Compound A, n=3) 217 mg of HCl salt 97% pure (95% by UV254; 98% by ELSD); α-6-mPEG\n4\n-O-morphine (Compound A, n=4) 275 mg of HCl salt 98% pure (97% by UV254; 98% by ELSD); α-6-mPEG\n5\n-O-morphine (Compound A, n=5) 177 mg of HCl salt 95% pure (93% by UV254; 98% by ELSD); α-6-mPEG\n6\n-O-morphine (Compound A, n=6) 310 mg of HCl salt 98% pure (98% by UV254; 99% by ELSD); α-6-mPEG\n7\n-O-morphine (Compound A, n=7) 541 mg of HCl salt 96% pure (93% by UV254; 99% by ELSD); and α-6-mPEG-O\n9\n-morphine (Compound A, n=9) 466 mg of HCl salt 98% pure (97% by UV254; 99% by ELSD). Additionally, morphine conjugates having a single PEG monomer attached, α-6-mPEG\n1\n-O-morphine (Compound A, n=1), 124 mg of HCl salt, 97% pure (95% pure by UV\n254\n; 98% by ELSD); as well as α-6-mPEG\n2\n-O-morphine (Compound A, n=2), 485 mg of HCl salt, 97% pure (95% pure by UV\n254\n; 98% by ELSD) were similarly prepared.\n\n\nExample 16\n\n\nPreparation of mPEG\nn\n-O-Codeine Conjugates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe general approach for conjugating codeine with an activated sulfonate ester of a water-soluble oligomer (using mPEG\n3\nOMs as a representative oligomer) to provide a codeine conjugate is schematically shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCodeine (30 mg, 0.1 mmol) was dissolved in toluene/DMF (75:1) solvent mixture followed by addition of HO—CH\n2\nCH\n2\nOCH\n2\nCH\n2\nOCH\n2\nCH\n2\nOMs (44 ml, 2 eq) and NaH (60% suspension in mineral oil, 24 mg, 6 eq). The resulting homogeneous yellow solution was heated to 45° C. After one hour, the reaction showed 11% conversion (extra peak at 2.71 min, 12 min run), after eighteen hours, the reaction showed 7% conversion (extra peak at 3.30 min, 12 min run), and after 24 hours, the reaction showed 24% conversion (multitude of extra peaks, two tallest ones are 1.11 min and 2.79 min). At this point, an additional 16 mg of NaH was added and heating continued for six hours, after which, an additional 16 mg of NaH was added followed by continued heating over sixty-six hours. Thereafter, no starting material remained, and analysis revealed many extra peaks, the two tallest ones corresponding to 2.79 min and 3 min (product peak is the second tallest among at least 7 peaks).\n\n\nThis synthesis was repeated using 10× scale wherein 30 ml of solvent mixture was used. After eighteen hours, analysis revealed 71% nominal conversion with additional peaks in the UV (one tall peak at 3.17 min and many small ones; wherein the desired peak corresponded to 3.43 min in UV). Thereafter, 80 mg (2 mmol) of NaH was added followed by continued heating. After three hours, analysis revealed 85% nominal conversion (several extra peaks, main 3.17 min). Reaction mixture was diluted with water, extracted with EtOAc (3×, combined organic layer washed with brine, dried over MgSO\n4\n, filtered and rotary evaporated) to give yellow oil (no sm in LC-MS, 90% pure by ELSD, 50% pure by UV—major impurity at 3.2 min). The crude product was dissolved in DCM, applied to a small cartridge filled with 230-400 mesh SiO\n2\n, dried, eluted on a Combi-flash via a 4 g pre-packed column cartridge with solvent A=DCM and solvent B=MeOH, \ngradient\n 0 to 30% of B. Analysis revealed two peaks of poor symmetry: a small leading peak and a larger peak with a tail. LC-MS was used to analyze fractions, wherein none were identified as containing pure product. Combined fractions that contained any product (tt#22-30) yielded, following solvent evaporation, 150 mg (34% yield) of impure product (LC-MS purity at 3.35 min by UV254, wherein about 25% represented the main impurities 3.11 min, 3.92 min, 4.32 min, 5.61 min of a 12 min run). A second purification by HPLC (solvent A=water, 0.1% TFA; solvent B=acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA) employing a gradient corresponding to 15-60% B, 70 min, 10 ml/min) resulted in poor separation from adjacent peaks. Only two fractions were clean enough and gave 21 mg of TFA salt (>95% pure, 4.7% yield). Three additional fractions both before and after the desired product-containing fractions (for a total of six additional fractions were combined to give 70 mg of about 50% pure product as TFA salts.\n\n\nUsing this same approach, other conjugates differing by the number of ethylene oxide units (n=4, 5, 6, 7, and 9) were made using these NaH conditions outlined above.\n\n\nConverstion of Codeine-Oligomer Conjugate TFA Salts to Codeine-Oligomer HCl Salts.\n\n\nThe general approach for converting codeine-oligomer TFA salts to codeine-oligomer HCl salts is schematically shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo a solution of codeine-oligomer conjugate TFA salt suspended in DCM (8 volumes) was charged 6 volumes of 2M HCl in diethyl ether. The reaction mixture was allowed to stir at room temperature for two hours and was then evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. The oily residue was dissolved in MeOH (8 volumes), filtered through glass wool and then evaporated under reduced pressure to give a thick orange to yellow oil in quantitative yield. Following this general procedure, the following compounds were synthesized:\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n3\n-O-codeine (Compound B, n=3) 235 mg of HCl salt, 98% pure;\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n4\n-O-codeine (Compound B, n=4) 524 mg of HCl salt, 98% pure;\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n5\n-O-codeine (Compound B, n=5) 185 mg of HCl salt, 98% pure+119 mg of HCl salt 97% pure, α-6-mPEG\n6\n-O-codeine (Compound B, n=6) 214 mg of HCl salt, 97% pure;\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n7\n-O-codeine (Compound B, n=7) 182 mg of HCl salt, 98% pure;\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n9\n-O-codeine (Compound B, n=9) 221 mg of HCl salt, 97% pure;\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n1\n-O-codeine (Compound B, n=1) 63 mg of HCl salt, 90% pure; and\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n2\n-O-codeine (Compound B, n=2) 178 mg of HCl salt, 90% pure.\n\n\nExample 17\n\n\nPreparation of mPFG\nn\n-O-Hydroxycodone Conjugates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe general approach for conjugating hydroxycodone with an activated sulfonate ester of a water-soluble oligomer (using “mPEG\nn\nOMs” as a representative oligomer) to provide a hydroxycodone conjugate is schematically shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReduction of Oxycodone to α-6-hydroxycodone: To a solution of oxycodone free base in dry THF under nitrogen cooled at −20° C., was added a 1.0 M THF solution of potassium tri-sec-butylborohydride over 15 minutes. The solution was stirred at −20° C. under nitrogen for 1.5 hours and then water (10 mL) was added slowly. The reaction mixture was stirred another 10 minutes at −20° C. and then allowed to warm to room temperature. All solvents were removed under reduced pressure and CH\n2\nCl\n2 \nwas added to the remaining residue. The CH\n2\nCl\n2 \nphase was extracted with a 0.1 N HCl/NaCl water solution and the combined 0.1 N HCl solution extracts were washed with CH\n2\nCl\n2\n, then Na\n2\nCO\n3 \nwas added to adjust the pH=8. The solution was extracted with CH\n2\nCl\n2\n. The CH\n2\nCl\n2 \nextracts were dried over anhydrous Na\n2\nSO\n4\n. After removing the solvent under reduced pressure, the desired α-6-HO-3-hydroxycodone was obtained.\n\n\nConjugation of mPEG\nn \nOMs to α-6-hydroxycodone: To a solution of Toluene/DMF (2:1 mixture, 10 volumes total) was charged hydroxycodone (prepared as set forth in the preceding paragraph) followed by NaH (4 eq) and then mPEG\nn\nOMs (1.3 e.). The reaction mixture was heated to 60-80° C. and was stirred until reaction completion was confirmed by LC-MS analysis (12-40 hours depending on PEG chain length). The reaction mixture was quenched with methanol (5 volumes) and the reaction mixture was evaporated to dryness in vacuo. The residue was re-dissolved in methanol (3 volumes) and was chromatographed using Combiflash (0-40% MeOH/DCM). The fractions containing large amounts of product were collected, combined and evaporated to dryness. This material was then purified by RP-HPLC to provide the final products as yellow to orange oils.\n\n\nConversion of Hydroxycodone Conjugate TFA Salts to Hydroxycodone Conjugate HCl Salts\n\n\nTo a solution of hydroxycodone conjugate TFA salt suspended in DCM (8 volumes) was charged 6 volumes of 2M HCl in diethyl ether. The reaction mixture was allowed to stir at room temperature for two hours and was then evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. The oily residue was dissolved in MeOH (8 volumes), filtered through glass wool and then evaporated under reduced pressure to give a thick orange to yellow oil in quantitative yield.

Each animal was given an IP injection of an irritant (phenylquinone, PQ) that induces “writhing” which may include: contractions of the abdomen, twisting and turning of the trunk, arching of the back, and the extension of the hindlimbs. Each animal was given an IP injection of PQ (1 mg/kg PQ, 0.1 mL/10 g bodyweight). After the injection, the animals were returned to their observation enclosure and their behavior was observed.

There were 3 rats/group. All animals were food fasted overnight. Prior to dosing the rats were weighed, the tails and cage cards were labeled for identification and the doses were calculated. Anesthesia was induced and maintained with 3.0-5.0% isoflurane. The JVC and CAC were externalized, flushed with HEP/saline (10 IU/mL HEP/mL saline), plugged, and labeled to identify the jugular vein and carotid artery. The predose sample was collected from the JVC. When all of the animals had recovered from anesthesia and the predose samples were processed, the animals for intravenous group were dosed, intravenously (IV) via the JVC using a 1 mL syringe containing the appropriate test article, the dead volume of the catheter was flushed with 0.9% saline to ensure the animals received the correct dose and oral group animals were treated orally via gavage.\n\n\nFollowing a single IV dose, blood samples were collected at 0 (pre-dose collected as described above), 2, 10, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 240 minutes and following oral dose, blood samples were collected 0 (pre-dose collected as described above), 15, 30, 60, 120, 240 and 480 minutes via the carotid artery catheter and processed as stated in the protocol.

concentrations and exposures as compared to oxycodone. PEGs with \n \n \n \nchain lengths\n \n \n \n 3, 5, 7 and 9 showed higher mean exposure (AUC) while PEG6 showed comparable mean exposure (AUC) and PEGs with \n \n \nchain lengths\n \n \n 1, 2 or 4 showed slightly lower mean exposure (AUC). The compounds having a PEG length greater than 5 showed trends of lower clearance, higher volume of distribution at steady state, increase in elimination half life values, with increasing PEG length.\n\n\nOral administration of PEGylated hydroxycodone with varying oligomeric PEG-lengths (PEG1 to PEG9) resulted in improvement in plasma exposure with the exception of hydroxycodone covalently attached to PEG1 and to PEG3. Oral bioavailability was highest for hydroxycodone covalently attached to mPEG6, 55.3%) followed by mPEG5-hydroxycodone and mPEG7-hydroxycodone with 37.6% and 28.1%, respectively. The elimination half-life values showed a trend of increasing with increase in PEG-length.\n\n\nExample 22\n\n\nIV and PO Pharmacokinetics of mPEG\nn\n-O-Morphine Conjugates\n\n\nA pharmacokinetic study was conducted in Sprague-Dawley rats as described in Example 20 above.

The objective was to determine the pharmacokinetics of the parent compound and its various oligomer conjugates administered both intravenously and orally.\n\n\nA summary of plasma PK parameters following IV (1 mg/kg) and PO (5 mg/kg) routes for morphine, mPEG\n1\n-O-morphine, mPEG\n2\n-O-morphine, mPEG\n3\n-O-morphine, mPEG\n4\n-O-morphine, mPEG\n5\n-O-morphine, mPEG\n6\n-O-morphine, mPEG\n7\n-O-morphine, mPEG\n9\n-O-morphine, are shown in Table 6 and Table 7, respectively.\n\n\nFor the intravenous group: \nFIG. 12\n shows the mean plasma concentration-time profiles for the above mPEG\nn\n-O-morphine conjugates after 1.0 mg/kg intravenous administration to rats.

There was a clear trend of increase in mean AUC with increase in PEG-length of 5 onwards, with 10-fold higher mean AUC for the PEG9-morphine compound as compared to non-conjugated morphine. The mean half-life and mean residence time also increased with increase in PEG-length. The lower mean clearance values were consistent with observed higher mean AUC values.\n\n\nMean volume of distribution estimated for steady state, immediately decreased by 5-fold with the introduction of single PEG, and reached a constant value at PEG-\nlength\n 5. Overall, PEGylation appeared to increase the elimination t\n1/2 \nand lower the tissue distribution of morphine.\n\n\nBased upon the oral data, administration of PEGylated morphine conjugates with varying PEG-lengths (PEG1 to PEG9) resulted in a reduction in oral bioavailability compared to morphine. The reduction in bioavailability appeared to be related to the absorption component rather than metabolism component for these PEG-conjugates. Among the PEG-conjugates, the conjugate with PEG-\nlength\n 4 showed maximum F-value (22.1%) while conjugates with shorter or longer PEG-length showed a clear trend of loss in absorption.\n\n\nIn this study, morphine F % value was 3-fold higher than literature value of 15% at 7.5 mg/kg (J. Pharmacokinet. Biopharm. 1978, 6:505-19). The reasons for this higher exposure are not known.\n\n\nExample 23\n\n\nIV and PO Pharmacokinetics of mPEG\nn\n-O-Codeine Conjugates\n\n\nA pharmacokinetic study was conducted in Sprague-Dawley rats as described in Example 20 above. Compounds administered were mPEG\nn\n-O-codeine conjugates where n=1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9, as well as the parent compound, codeine (n=0). The objective was to determine the pharmacokinetics of the parent compound, i.e., codeine, and its various oligomer conjugates administered both intravenously and orally.\n\n\nA summary of plasma PK parameters following IV (1 mg/kg) and PO (5 mg/kg) routes for codeine, mPEG\n1\n-O-codeine, mPEG\n2\n-O-codeine, mPEG\n3\n-O-codeine, mPEG\n4\n-O-codeine, mPEG\n5\n-O-codeine, mPEG\n6\n-O-codeine,

PEGylation of codeine with varying oligomeric PEG-lengths (PEG1 to PEG9) improved exposure (mean AUC) only slightly and moderate improvement (approximately 4-fold) was observed for the PEG-6 conjugate. Both clearance and volume of distribution decreased for this PEG-conjugate by 4-fold. Conjugates with PEG-\n \nlengths\n \n 7 and 9 showed longer mean t\n1/2 \nvalues, however, mean clearance and mean volume of distribution (Vss) were decreased for both for both the PEG7- and PEG9-codeine conjugates.\n\n\nFor the oral data, oral bioavailability for codeine is very low (F=0.52%). Oral bioavailability appeared to increase with increase in PEG-length from 2 onwards, reaching maximum with 32% bioavailability for the codeine conjugate with PEG-\nlength\n 6, decreasing thereafter. In general, mean t\n1/2 \nand mean residence values increased with PEG-length. There was no difference in time to reach peak concentrations (Tmax=15 min) amongst all the compounds tested, suggesting that absorption was rapid and the absorption rate was not altered.\n\n\nExample 24\n\n\nIn-Vitro Binding of mPEG\nn\n-O-Opioid Conjugates to Opioid Receptors\n\n\nThe binding affinities of the various PEG-opioid conjugates (mPEG\nn\n-O-morphine, mPEG\nn\n-O-codeine, and mPEG\nn\n-O-hydroxycodone) was measured in vitro in membrane preparations prepared from CHO cells that heterologously express the cloned human mu, kappa or delta opioid receptors. Radioligand displacement was measured using scintillation proximity assays (SPA).\n\n\nBriefly, serial dilutions of the test compounds were placed in a 96-well plate to which were added SPA beads, membrane and radioligand. The assay conditions for each opioid receptor subtype are described in Table 10 below. The plates were incubated for 8 hours-overnight at room temperature, spun at 1000 rpm to pellet the SPA beads, and radioactivity was measured using the TopCount® microplate Scintillation counter. Specific binding at each concentration of test compound was calculated by subtracting the non-specific binding measured in the presence of excess cold ligand. IC\n50 \nvalues were obtained by non-linear regression of specific binding versus concentration curves and Ki values were calculated using Kd values that were experimentally pre-determined for each lot of membrane preparations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssay conditions for opioid receptor binding assays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXPERIMENTAL\n\n\n \n\n\nKAPPA OPIOID\n\n\nDELTA OPIOID\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVARIABLE\n\n\nMU OPIOID RECEPTOR\n\n\nRECEPTOR\n\n\nRECEPTOR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPA beads\n\n\nPVT-WGA PEI Type A\n\n\nPVT-WGA (GE\n\n\nPVT-WGA PEI Type B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(GE Healthcare, Cat. #\n\n\nHealthcare, Cat.\n\n\n(GE Healthcare, Cat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRPNQ0003)\n\n\n#RPNQ0001)\n\n\n#RPNQ0004)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRadioligand;\n\n\nDAMGO, [Tyrosyl-3,5-\n\n\nU-69,593, [Phenyl-3,4-\n\n\nNaltrindole, [5′,7′-3H]-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConcentration\n\n\n3H(N)]-(Perkin Elmer,\n\n\n3H]-(Perkin Elmer, Cat.\n\n\n(Perkin Elmer, Cat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCat. # NET-902); 6 nM\n\n\n#NET-952); 10 nM\n\n\n#NET-1065); 3 nM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-specific\n\n\nCTAP\n\n\nnor-Binaltorphimine\n\n\nSNC80\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbinding control\n\n\n \n\n\n(nor-BNI)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nBuffer\n \n\n\n50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5\n\n\n50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5\n\n\n50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5 mM MgCl2;\n\n\n5 \nmM MgCl2\n \n\n\n \n5 mM MgCl2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1 mM EDTA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReceptor and\n\n\nRecombinant human mu\n\n\nRecombinant human\n\n\nRecombinant human delta\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsource\n\n\nopioid receptor expressed\n\n\nkappa opioid receptor\n\n\nopioid receptor expressed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nin CHO-K1 host cell\n\n\nexpressed in Chem-1 host\n\n\nin Chem-1 host cell\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nmembranes (Perkin Elmer,\n\n\ncell membranes\n\n\nmembranes (Millipore,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCat. #ES-542-M)\n\n\n(Millipore, Cat.\n\n\nCat. #HTS100M).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n#HTS095M)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe binding affinities of the oligomeric PEG conjugates of morphine, codeine and hydroxycodone are shown in Table 11. Overall, all of the conjugates displayed measurable binding to the mu-opioid receptor, consistent with the known pharmacology of the parent molecules. For a given PEG size, the rank order of mu-opioid binding affinity was PEG-morphine>PEG-hydroxycodone>PEG-codeine. Increasing PEG size resulted in a progressive decrease in the binding affinity of all PEG conjugates to the mu opioid receptor compared to unconjugated parent molecule. However, the PEG-morphine conjugates still retained a high binding affinity that was within 15× that of parent morphine. The mu-opioid binding affinities of PEG-hydroxycodones were 20-50 fold lower than those of the PEG-morphine conjugates. Codeine and its PEG conjugates bound with very low affinity to the mu opioid receptor. PEG-morphine conjugates also bound to the kappa and delta opioid receptors; the rank order of selectivity was mu>kappa>delta. Binding affinities of codeine and hydroxycodone conjugates to the kappa and delta opioid receptors were significantly lower than that at the mu-opioid receptor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBinding affinities of the PEG-opioid conjugates to opioid receptors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nKI (NM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nKappa\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMu opioid\n\n\nopioid\n\n\nDelta opioid\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMPOUND\n\n\nreceptor\n\n\nreceptor\n\n\nreceptor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMorphine\n\n\n8.44\n\n\n118.38\n\n\n4,297\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n1\n-O-Morphine\n\n\n15.72\n\n\n444.54\n\n\n2,723\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n2\n-O-Morphine\n\n\n21.97\n\n\n404.33\n\n\n2,601\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n3\n-O-Morphine\n\n\n50.66\n\n\n575.98\n\n\n6,176\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n4\n-O-Morphine\n\n\n23.11\n\n\n438.88\n\n\n3,358\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n5\n-O-Morphine\n\n\n39.40\n\n\n557.54\n\n\n2,763\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n6\n-O-Morphine\n\n\n72.98\n\n\n773.56\n\n\n2,595\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n7\n-O-Morphine\n\n\n56.86\n\n\n669.56\n\n\n2,587\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n9\n-O-Morphine\n\n\n111.05\n\n\n1253.71\n\n\n5,783\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOxycodone\n\n\n133.48\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n1\n-O-Hydroxycodone\n\n\n653.90\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n2\n-O-Hydroxycodone\n\n\n631.76\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n3\n-O-Hydroxycodone\n\n\n775.19\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n4\n-O-Hydroxycodone\n\n\n892.70\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n5\n-O-Hydroxycodone\n\n\n1862.14\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n6\n-O-Hydroxycodone\n\n\n1898.30\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n7\n-O-Hydroxycodone\n\n\n1607.19\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n9\n-O-Hydroxycodone\n\n\n3616.60\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCodeine\n\n\n1,953\n\n\n28,067\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n1\n-O-Codeine\n\n\n1821.51\n\n\n54669.89\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n2\n-O-Codeine\n\n\n1383.07\n\n\n22603.05\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n3\n-O-Codeine\n\n\n4260.21\n\n\n36539.78\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n4\n-O-Codeine\n\n\n2891.36\n\n\n96978.61\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n5\n-O-Codeine\n\n\n2427.13\n\n\n59138.22\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n6\n-O-Codeine\n\n\n14202.77\n\n\n>160,000\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n7\n-O-Codeine\n\n\n9963.93\n\n\n108317.50\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n9\n-O-Codeine\n\n\n9975.84\n\n\n72246.23\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN/A indicates that Ki values could not be calculated since a 50% inhibition of binding was not achieved at the highest concentration of compound tested.\n\n\nExample 25\n\n\nIn-Vitro Efficacy of mPEG\nn\n-O-Opioid Conjugates to Inhibit cAMP Formation\n\n\nThe efficacy of the various PEG-opioid conjugates was measured by their ability to inhibit cAMP formation following receptor activation. Studies were conducted in CHO cells heterologously expressing the cloned human mu, kappa or delta opioid receptors. cAMP was measured using a cAMP HiRange homogenous time-resolved fluorescence assay (HTRF Assay), that is based on a competitive immunoassay principle (Cisbio, Cat.#62AM6PEC).\n\n\nBriefly, suspensions of cells expressing either the mu, kappa or delta opioid receptors were prepared in buffer containing 0.5 mM isobutyl-methyl xanthine (IBMX). Cells were incubated with varying concentrations of PEG-opioid conjugates and 3 μM forskolin for 30 minutes at room temperature. cAMP was detected following a two-step assay protocol per the manufacturer's instructions and time resolved fluorescence was measured with the following settings: 330 nm excitation; 620 nm and 665 nm emission; 380 nm dichroic mirror. The 665 nm/620 nm ratio is expressed as Delta F % and test compound-related data is expressed as a percentage of average maximum response in wells without forskolin. EC\n50 \nvalues were calculated for each compound from a sigmoidal dose-response plot of concentrations versus maximum response. To determine if the compounds behaved as full or partial agonists in the system, the maximal response at the highest tested concentrations of compounds were compared to that produced by a known full agonist.\n\n\nThe EC\n50 \nvalues for inhibition of cAMP formation in whole cells are shown in Table 12. Oligomeric PEG conjugates of morphine, codeine and hydroxycodone were full agonists at the mu opioid receptor, albeit with varying efficacies. Morphine and its conjugates were the most potent of the three series of opioids tested, while the PEG hydroxycodone and PEG codeine conjugates displayed significantly lower efficacies. A progressive decrease in the efficacy of the PEG-morphine conjugates was observed with increasing PEG size, however the conjugates retained mu-agonist potency to within 40× of parent. In contrast to the effect at the mu opioid receptor, morphine and PEG-morphine conjugates behaved as weak partial agonists at the kappa opioid receptor, producing 47-87% of the maximal possible response. EC\n50 \nvalues could not be calculated for the codeine and hydroxycodone conjugates at the kappa and delta opioid receptors since complete dose-response curves could not be generated with the range of concentrations tested (up to 500 μM).\n\n\nOverall, the results of the receptor binding and functional activity indicate that the PEG-opioids are mu agonists in vitro.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn vitro efficacies of PEG-opioid conjugates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMU OPIOID\n\n\nKAPPA OPIOID\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRECEPTOR\n\n\nRECEPTOR\n\n\nDELTA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nEC\n50\n,\n\n\n% max\n\n\nEC\n50\n,\n\n\n% max\n\n\nOPIOID\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMPOUND\n\n\nnM\n\n\neffect\n\n\nnM\n\n\neffect\n\n\nRECEPTOR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMorphine\n\n\n28.5\n\n\n102\n\n\n624\n\n\n69\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n1\n-O-Morphine\n\n\n85.0\n\n\n91\n\n\n1,189\n\n\n81\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n2\n-O-Morphine\n\n\n93.3\n\n\n91\n\n\n641\n\n\n87\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n3\n-O-Morphine\n\n\n270\n\n\n100\n\n\n4,198\n\n\n82\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n4\n-O-Morphine\n\n\n128\n\n\n100\n\n\n3,092\n\n\n77\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n5\n-O-Morphine\n\n\n157\n\n\n95\n\n\n2,295\n\n\n71\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n6\n-O-Morphine\n\n\n415\n\n\n98\n\n\n3,933\n\n\n62\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n7\n-O-Morphine\n\n\n508\n\n\n90\n\n\n4,237\n\n\n57\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n9\n-O-Morphine\n\n\n1,061\n\n\n87\n\n\n4,417\n\n\n47\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOxycodone\n\n\n478\n\n\n95\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHydroxycodone\n\n\n3,162\n\n\n \n\n\nN/A\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n1\n-O-Hydroxycodone\n\n\n3,841\n\n\n102\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n2\n-O-Hydroxycodone\n\n\n5,005\n\n\n101\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n3\n-O-Hydroxycodone\n\n\n2,827\n\n\n108\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n4\n-O-Hydroxycodone\n\n\n3,715\n\n\n109\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n5\n-O-Hydroxycodone\n\n\n5,037\n\n\n108\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n6\n-O-Hydroxycodone\n\n\n12,519\n\n\n102\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n7\n-O-Hydroxycodone\n\n\n7,448\n\n\n101\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n9\n-O-Hydroxycodone\n\n\n17,948\n\n\n95\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCodeine\n\n\n10,418\n\n\n81\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n 3\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n1\n-O-Codeine\n\n\n8,574\n\n\n80\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n51\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n2\n-O-Codeine\n\n\n5,145\n\n\n75\n\n\n40,103\n\n\n59\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n3\n-O-Codeine\n\n\n19,740\n\n\n91\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n49\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n4\n-O-Codeine\n\n\n22,083\n\n\n99\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n61\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n5\n-O-Codeine\n\n\n23,235\n\n\n95\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n60\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n6\n-O-Codeine\n\n\n97,381\n\n\n80\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n21\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n7\n-O-Codeine\n\n\n44,729\n\n\n75\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n48\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα-6-mPEG\n9\n-O-Codeine\n\n\n48,242\n\n\n80\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n61\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 26\n\n\nBrain:Plasma Ratios of mPEG\nn\n-O-Opioid Conjugates\n\n\nThe ability of oligomeric mPEG-O-morphine, mPEG-O-codeine and mPEG-O-hydroxycodone conjugates to cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) and enter the CNS (central nervous system) was assessed by measuring the brain:plasma ratio in rats subsequent to IV administration.\n\n\nBriefly, groups of 3 rats were injected intravenously (i.v) with 5 mg/kg each of morphine, mPEG\nn\n-O-morphine conjugate, codeine and m-PEG\nn\n-O-codeine conjugates. PEG-2,3 and 4-oxycodone conjugates were administered at 10 mg/kg i.v. and oxycodone and the other PEG sizes of oxycodone conjugates were administered at 1 mg/kg (i.v). The doses of the oxycodone conjugates had to be adjusted to allow for the detection of sufficient concentrations in brain tissue. Atenolol, which does not cross the BBB, was used as a measure of vascular contamination of the brain tissue and was administered at a concentration of 10 mg/kg to a separate group of rats. An hour following injection, the animals were sacrificed and plasma and the brain were collected and frozen immediately. Following tissue and plasma extractions, concentrations of the compounds in brain and plasma were measured using LC-MS/MS. The brain:plasma ratio was calculated as the ratio of measured concentrations in the brain and plasma. The results are shown in \nFIGS. 16A-C\n.\n\n\n \nFIGS. 16A\n, \n16\nB, and \n16\nC show the brain:plasma ratios of various oligomeric mPEG\nn\n-O-morphine, mPEG\nn\n-O-codeine, and PEG\nn\n-O-hydroxycodone conjugates, respectively. The brain:plasma ratio of atenolol is shown in each figure to provide a basis for comparison. PEG-conjugation results in a decrease in the brain:plasma ratio of all conjugates compared to their respective unconjugated parent molecule, which in the case of hydroxycodone is oxycodone. Only PEG-1-morphine displayed a greater brain:plasma ratio than its parent, morphine.\n\n\nExample 27\n\n\nTime-Course of Brain and Plasma Concentrations of Various Exemplary mPEG\nn\n-O-Opioid Conjugates\n\n\nExperiments were conducted to determine the concentrations of various oligomeric PEG-opioid conjugates in brain and plasma over time following IV administration.\n\n\nThe experimental methodology and concentrations used were the same as those used for the single time point experiments described in Example 26, however, the brains and plasma were harvested at various differing time points.\n\n\nAll PEG-hydroxycodone conjugates were administered at 10 mg/kg iv, while the oxycodone parent was administered at 1 mg/kg iv. The data for the brain and plasma concentrations versus time for the various PEG-opioid conjugates administered is shown in \nFIGS. 17A-H\n (morphine series), \nFIGS. 18A-H\n (codeine series), and \nFIGS. 19A-H\n (oxycodone/hydroxycodone series).\n\n\nThe data demonstrate that the maximal increase in brain concentrations for all parent molecules and oligomeric PEG-conjugates occurs at the earliest time point, i.e., 10 minutes following iv injection. PEG conjugation results in a significant reduction in the brain concentrations and with the larger PEG conjugates (≧PEG-4), the brain concentrations remain relatively low and steady over time."

Description\n\n\n\n\nPRIORITY TO RELATED APPLICATION(S)\n\n\nThis application claims the benefit of European Patent Application No. 09153162.4, filed Feb. 19, 2009, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nReceptors for the major inhibitory neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), are divided into two main classes: (1) GABA A receptors, which are members of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily and (2) GABA B receptors, which are members of the G-protein linked receptor family. The GABA A receptor complex which is a membrane-bound heteropentameric protein polymer is composed principally of α, β and γ subunits.\n\n\nPresently a total number of 21 subunits of the GABA A receptor have been cloned and sequenced. Three types of subunits (α, β and γ) are required for the construction of recombinant GABA A receptors which most closely mimic the biochemical, electrophysiological and pharmacological functions of native GABA A receptors obtained from mammalian brain cells. There is strong evidence that the benzodiazepine binding site lies between the α and γ subunits. Among the recombinant GABA A receptors, α1β2γ2 mimics many effects of the classical type-I BzR subtypes, whereas α2β2γ2, α3β2γ2 and α5β2γ2 ion channels are termed type-II BzR.\n\n\nIt has been shown by McNamara and Skelton in Psychobiology, 1993, 21:101-108 that the benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist β-CCM enhance spatial learning in the Morris watermaze. However, β-CCM and other conventional benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonists are proconvulsant or convulsant which prevents their use as cognition enhancing agents in humans. In addition, these compounds are non-selective within the GABA A receptor subunits, whereas a GABA A α5 receptor partial or full inverse agonist which is relatively free of activity at GABA A α1 and/or α2 and/or α3 receptor can be used to provide a medicament which is useful for enhancing cognition with reduced or without proconvulsant activity. It is also possible to use GABA A α5 inverse agonists which are not free of activity at GABA A α1 and/or α2 and/or α3 receptor but which are functionally selective for α5 containing subunits. However, inverse agonists which are selective for GABA A α5 subunits and are relatively free of activity at GABA A α1, α2 and α3 receptor are preferred.\n\n\nLiterature has been published to establish the link between GABA A α5 subunits and the therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of various diseases of the Central Nervous System, like Neuroscience Letts., 2005, 381, 108-13, Neuropsychobiology, 2001, 43(3), 141-44, Amer.

Additional asymmetric centres can be present depending upon the nature of the various substituents on the molecule. Each such asymmetric centre will independently produce two optical isomers and it is intended that all of the possible optical isomers and diastereomers in mixtures and as pure or partially purified compounds are included within this invention. The present invention is meant to comprehend all such isomeric forms of these compounds. The independent syntheses of these diastereomers or their chromatographic separations can be achieved as known in the art by appropriate modification of the methodology disclosed herein. Their absolute stereochemistry can be determined by the x-ray crystallography of crystalline products or crystalline intermediates which are derivatized, if necessary, with a reagent containing an asymmetric centre of known absolute configuration. If desired, racemic mixtures of the compounds can be separated so that the individual enantiomers are isolated. The separation can be carried out by methods well known in the art, such as the coupling of a racemic mixture of compounds to an enantiomerically pure compound to form a diastereomeric mixture, followed by separation of the individual diastereomers by standard methods, such as fractional crystallization or chromatography.\n\n\nIn the embodiments, where optically pure enantiomers are provided, the term “optically pure enantiomer” means that the compound contains >90% of the desired isomer by weight, preferably >95% of the desired isomer by weight, or more preferably >99% of the desired isomer by weight, said weight percent based upon the total weight of the isomer(s) of the compound. Chirally pure or chirally enriched compounds can be prepared by chirally selective synthesis or by separation of enantiomers. The separation of enantiomers can be carried out on the final product or alternatively on a suitable intermediate. Separation of enantiomers can be performed by chromatography on a chiral stationary phase, e.g. on a Chiralcel OD or a Chiralpak AD column, with an eluent compatible with the stationary phase like a hydrocarbon as pentanes, hexanes or heptanes mixed with a low alcohol as ethanol, n-propanol or isopropanol, preferred are heptane/isopropanol or heptane/ethanol mixtures.\n\n\nIsotopically-labelled compounds of formula I, including compounds of formula I isotopically-labelled to be detectable by PET or SPECT, also fall within the scope of the invention. The same applies to compounds of formula I labelled with [\n13\nC]—, [\n14\nC]—, [\n3\nH]—, [\n18\nF]—, [\n125\nI]— or other isotopically enriched atoms, suitable for receptor binding or metabolism studies.\n\n\nThe term “pharmaceutical composition” encompasses a product comprising specified ingredients in pre-determined amounts or proportions, as well as any product that results, directly or indirectly, from combining specified ingredients in specified amounts. Preferably it encompasses a product comprising one or more active ingredients, and an optional carrier comprising inert ingredients, as well as any product that results, directly or indirectly, from combination, complexation or aggregation of any two or more of the ingredients, or from dissociation of one or more of the ingredients, or from other types of reactions or interactions of one or more of the ingredients.\n\n\nThe following table lists abbreviations used within the present document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nabbreviations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbrine\n\n\nwater saturated with sodium chloride\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuLi\n\n\nbutyl lithium\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDCM\n\n\ndichloromethane\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIAD\n\n\ndiisopropyl azodicarboxylate\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDEAD\n\n\ndiethyl azodicarboxylate\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDMF\n\n\nN,N-dimethylformamide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEI\n\n\nelectron ionization\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHCl\n\n\nhydrochloride\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKCl, CaCl\n2\n, MgCl\n2\n \n\n\npotassium chloride, calcium chloride,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nmagnesium chloride\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiOH, NaOH\n\n\nlithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMe\n3\nAl\n\n\ntrimethylaluminium\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeOH, EtOH\n\n\nmethanol, ethanol\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMS\n\n\nmass spectrum\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNMO\n\n\nN-Methylmorpholin-N-oxid\n\n\n\n\n\n\non\n\n\novernight\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPCC\n\n\npyridinium chlorochromate\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPET\n\n\nPositrons-Emissions-Computer-Tomography\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrt\n\n\nroom temperature\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeignette's salt\n\n\npotassium sodium tartrate\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPECT\n\n\nSingle-Photon-Emissions-Computer-Tomography\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTBD\n\n\n1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec-5-ene\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHF\n\n\ntetrahydrofuran\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTris\n\n\ntris(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions, methods of using, and methods of preparing the aforementioned compounds.\n\n\nWhile the present invention has been described with reference to the specific embodiments thereof, it should be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes can be made and equivalents can be substituted without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention.

Compounds of the present invention are ligands for GABA A receptors containing the α5 subunit and are therefore useful in therapy where cognition enhancement is required.\n\n\nThe compounds were investigated in accordance with the test given hereinafter:\n\n\nMembrane Preparation and Binding Assay\n\n\nThe affinity of compounds at GABA A receptor subtypes was measured by competition for [3H]flumazenil (85 Ci/mmol; Roche) binding to HEK293 cells expressing rat (stably transfected) or human (transiently transfected) receptors of composition α1β3γ2, α2β3γ2, α3β3γ2 and α5β3γ2.\n\n\nCell pellets were suspended in Krebs-tris buffer (4.8 mM KCl, 1.2 mM CaCl\n2\n, 1.2 mM MgCl\n2\n, 120 mM NaCl, 15 mM Tris; pH 7.5; binding assay buffer), homogenized by polytron for ca. 20 sec on ice and centrifuged for 60 min at 4° C. (50000 g; Sorvall, rotor: SM24=20000 rpm). The cell pellets were re-suspended in Krebs-tris buffer and homogenized by polytron for ca. 15 sec on ice. Protein was measured (Bradford method, Bio-Rad) and aliquots of 1 mL were prepared and stored at −80° C.\n\n\nRadioligand binding assays were carried out in a volume of 200 mL (96-well plates) which contained 100 mL of cell membranes, [\n3\nH]flumazenil at a concentration of 1 nM for α1, α2 and α3 subunits and 0.5 nM for α5 subunits and the test compound in the range of 10-10\n−3\n×10\n−6 \nM. Nonspecific binding was defined by 10\n−5 \nM diazepam and typically represented less than 5% of the total binding. Assays were incubated to equilibrium for 1 hour at 4° C. and harvested onto GF/C uni-filters (Packard) by filtration using a Packard harvester and washing with ice-cold wash buffer (50 mM Tris; pH 7.5). After drying, filter-retained radioactivity was detected by liquid scintillation counting. Ki values were calculated using Excel-Fit (Microsoft) and are the means of two determinations.\n\n\nThe compounds of the accompanying examples were tested in the above described assay, and the preferred compounds were found to possess a Ki value for displacement of [\n3\nH]flumazenil from α5 subunits of the rat GABA A receptor of 100 nM or less. Most preferred are compounds with a Ki (nM)<35. In a preferred embodiment the compounds of the invention are binding selective for the α5 subunit relative to the α1, α2 and α3 subunit.
