In most mammals, including humans and mice, antibodies are constructed from paired heavy and light polypeptide chains. Each chain is made up of individual immunoglobulin (Ig) domains, and thus the generic term immunoglobulin is used for such proteins. Each chain is made up of two distinct regions, referred to as the variable and constant regions. The light and heavy chain variable regions show significant sequence diversity between antibodies, and are responsible for binding the target antigen. The constant regions show less sequence diversity, and are responsible for binding a number of natural proteins to elicit important biochemical events. In humans there are five different classes of antibodies including IgA (which includes subclasses IgA1 and IgA2), IgD, IgE, IgG (which includes subclasses IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4), and IgM. The distinguishing features between these antibody classes are their constant regions, although subtler differences may exist in the V region. \nFigure 1\n shows an IgG1 antibody, used here as an example to describe the general structural features of immunoglobulins. IgG antibodies are tetrameric proteins composed of two heavy chains and two light chains. The IgG heavy chain is composed of four immunoglobulin domains linked from N- to C-terminus in the order V\nH\n-Cγ1-Cγ2-Cγ3, referring to the heavy chain variable domain, \nconstant gamma\n 1 domain, \nconstant gamma\n 2 domain, and \nconstant gamma\n 3 domain respectively. The IgG light chain is composed of two immunoglobulin domains linked from N- to C-terminus in the order V\nL\n-C\nL\n, referring to the light chain variable domain and the light chain constant domain respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe variable region of an antibody contains the antigen binding determinants of the molecule, and thus determines the specificity of an antibody for its target antigen. The variable region is so named because it is the most distinct in sequence from other antibodies within the same class. The majority of sequence variability occurs in the complementarity determining regions (CDRs). There are 6 CDRs total, three each per heavy and light chain, designated V\nH\n CDR1, V\nH\n CDR2, V\nH\n CDR3, V\nL\n CDR1, V\nL\n CDR2, and V\nL\n CDR3. The variable region outside of the CDRs is referred to as the framework (FR) region. Although not as diverse as the CDRs, sequence variability does occur in the FR region between different antibodies. Overall, this characteristic architecture of antibodies provides a stable scaffold (the FR region) upon which substantial antigen binding diversity (the CDRs) can be explored by the immune system to obtain specificity for a broad array of antigens. A number of high-resolution structures are available for a variety of variable region fragments from different organisms, some unbound and some in complex with antigen. The sequence and structural features of antibody variable regions are well characterized (\nMorea et al., 1997, Biophys Chem 68:9-16\n; \nMorea et al., 2000, Methods 20:267-279\n), and the conserved features of antibodies have enabled the development of a wealth of antibody engineering techniques (\nMaynard et al., 2000, Annu Rev Biomed Eng 2:339-376\n). For example, it is possible to graft the CDRs from one antibody, for example a murine antibody, onto the framework region of another antibody, for example a human antibody. This process, referred to in the art as \"humanization\", enables generation of less immunogenic antibody therapeutics from nonhuman antibodies. Fragments comprising the variable region can exist in the absence of other regions of the antibody, including for example the antigen binding fragment (Fab) comprising V\nH\n-Cγ1 and V\nH\n-C\nL\n, the variable fragment (Fv) comprising V\nH\n and V\nL\n, the single chain variable fragment (scFv) comprising V\nH\n and V\nL\n linked together in the same chain, as well as a variety of other variable region fragments (\nLittle et al., 2000, Immunol Today 21:364-370\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Fc region of an antibody interacts with a number of Fc receptors and ligands, imparting an array of important functional capabilities referred to as effector functions. For IgG the Fc region, as shown in \nFigure 1\n, comprises Ig domains Cγ2 and Cγ3 and the N-terminal hinge leading into Cγ2. An important family of Fc receptors for the IgG class are the Fc gamma receptors (FcγRs). These receptors mediate communication between antibodies and the cellular arm of the immune system (\nRaghavan et al., 1996, Annu Rev Cell Dev Biol 12:181-220\n; \nRavetch et al., 2001, Annu Rev Immunol 19:275-290\n). In humans this protein family includes FcγRI (CD64), including isoforms FcγRIa, FcγRIb, and FcγRIc; FcγRII (CD32), including isoforms FcγRIIa (including allotypes H131 and R131), FcγRIIb (including FcγRIIb-1 and FcγRIIb-2), and FcγRIIc; and FcγRIII (CD16), including isoforms FcγRIIIa (including allotypes V158 and F158) and FcγRIIIb (including allotypes FcγRIIIb-NA1 and FcγRIIIb-NA2) (\nJefferis et al., 2002, Immunol Lett 82:57-65\n). These receptors typically have an extracellular domain that mediates binding to Fc, a membrane spanning region, and an intracellular domain that may mediate some signaling event within the cell. These receptors are expressed in a variety of immune cells including monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, eosinophils, mast cells, platelets, B cells, large granular lymphocytes, Langerhans' cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and γγ T cells. Formation of the Fc/FcγR complex recruits these effector cells to sites of bound antigen, typically resulting in signaling events within the cells and important subsequent immune responses such as release of inflammation mediators, B cell activation, endocytosis, phagocytosis, and cytotoxic attack. The ability to mediate cytotoxic and phagocytic effector functions is a potential mechanism by which antibodies destroy targeted cells. The cell-mediated reaction wherein nonspecific cytotoxic cells that express FcγRs recognize bound antibody on a target cell and subsequently cause lysis of the target cell Is referred to as antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) (\nRaghavan et al., 1996, Annu Rev Cell Dev Biol 12:181-220\n; \nGhetie et al., 2000, Annu Rev Immunol 18:739-766\n \n;\n \nRavetch et al., 2001, Annu Rev Immunol 19:275-290\n). The cell-mediated reaction wherein nonspecific cytotoxic cells that express FcγRs recognize bound antibody on a target cell and subsequently cause phagocytosis of the target cell is referred to as antibody dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis (ADCP). A number of structures have been solved of the extracellular domains of human FcγRs, including FcγRIIa (\npdb accession code\n 1 H9V)(\nSondermann et al., 2001, J Mol Biol 309:737-749\n) (pdb accession code 1FCG)(\nMaxwell et al., 1999, Nat Struct Biol 6:437-442\n), FcγRIIb (pdb accession code 2FCB)(\nSondermann et al., 1999, Embo J 18:1095-1103\n); and FcγRIIIb (\npdb accession code\n 1 E4J)(\nSondermann et al., 2000, Nature 406:267-273\n.). All FcγRs bind the same region on Fc, at the N-terminal end of the Cγ2 domain and the preceding hinge, shown in \nFigure 2\n. This Interaction is well characterized structurally (\nSondermann et al., 2001, J Mol Biol 309:737-749\n), and several structures of the human Fc bound to the extracellular domain of human FcγRIIIb have been solved (\npdb accession code\n 1 E4K)(\nSondermann et al., 2000, Nature 406:267-273\n.) (pdb accession codes 1IIS and 1IIX)(\nRadaev et al., 2001, J Biol Chem 276:16469-16477\n), as well as has the structure of the human IgE Fc/Fc□RI□ complex (\npdb accession code\n 1 F6A)(\nGarman et al., 2000, Nature 406:259-266\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe different IgG subclasses have different affinities for the FcγRs, with IgG1 and IgG3 typically binding substantially better to the receptors than IgG2 and IgG4 (\nJefferis et al., 2002, Immunol Lett 82:57-65\n)\n.\n All FcγRs bind the same region on IgG Fc, yet with different affinities: the high affinity binder FcγRI has a Kd for IgG1 of 10\n-8\n M\n-1\n, whereas the low affinity receptors FcγRII and FcγRIII generally bind at 10\n-6\n and 10\n-5\n respectively. The extracellular domains of FcγRIIIa and FcγRIIIb are 96% identical, however FcγRIIIb does not have a intracellular signaling domain. Furthermore, whereas FcγRI, FcγRIIa/c, and FcγRIIIa are positive regulators of immune complex-triggered activation, characterized by having an intracellular domain that has an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM), FcγRIIb has an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) and is therefore inhibitory. Thus the former are referred to as activation receptors, and FcγRIIb is referred to as an inhibitory receptor. The receptors also differ in expression pattern and levels on different immune cells. Yet another level of complexity is the existence of a number of FcγR polymorphisms in the human proteome. A particularly relevant polymorphism with clinical significance is V158/F158 FcγRIIIa. Human IgG1 binds with greater affinity to the V158 allotype than to the F158 allotype. This difference in affinity, and presumably its effect on ADCC and/or ADCP, has been shown to be a significant determinant of the efficacy of the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab (Rituxan®, a registered trademark of IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation). Patients with the V158 allotype respond favorably to rituximab treatment; however, patients with the lower affinity F158 allotype respond poorly (\nCartron et al., 2002, Blood 99:754-758\n). Approximately 10-20% of humans are V158/V158 homozygous, 45% are V158/F158 heterozygous, and 35-45% of humans are F158/F158 homozygous (\nLehrnbecher et al., 1999, Blood 94:4220-4232\n; \nCartron et a/., 2002, Blood 99:754-758\n). Thus 80-90% of humans are poor responders, that is they have at least one allele of the F158 FcγRIIIa.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn overlapping but separate site on Fc, shown in \nFigure 1\n, serves as the interface for the complement protein C1q. In the same way that Fc/FcγR binding mediates ADCC, Fc/C1 q binding mediates complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). C1q forms a complex with the serine proteases C1r and C1s to form the C1 complex. C1q is capable of binding six antibodies, although binding to two IgGs is sufficient to activate the complement cascade. Similar to Fc interaction with FcγRs, different IgG subclasses have different affinity for C1 q, with IgG1 and IgG3 typically binding substantially better to the FcγRs than IgG2 and IgG4 (\nJefferis et al., 2002, Immunol Lett 82:57-65\n). There is currently no structure available for the Fc/C1q complex; however, mutagenesis studies have mapped the binding site on human IgG for C1q to a region involving residues D270, K322, K326, P329, and P331, and E333 (\nIdusogie et al., 2000, J Immunol 164:4178-4184\n; \nIdusogie et al., 2001, J Immunol 166:2571-2575\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA site on Fc between the Cγ2 and Cγ3 domains, shown in \nFigure 1\n, mediates Interaction with the neonatal receptor FcRn, the binding of which recycles endocytosed antibody from the endosome back to the bloodstream (\nRaghavan et al., 1996, Annu Rev Cell Dev Biol 12:181-220\n; \nGhetie et al., 2000, Annu Rev Immunol 18:739-766\n). This process, coupled with preclusion of kidney filtration due to the large size of the full length molecule, results in favorable antibody serum half-lives ranging from one to three weeks. Binding of Fc to FcRn also plays a key role in antibody transport. The binding site for FcRn on Fc is also the site at which the bacterial proteins A and G bind. The tight binding by these proteins is typically exploited as a means to purify antibodies by employing protein A or protein G affinity chromatography during protein purification. Thus the fidelity of this region on Fc is important for both the clinical properties of antibodies and their purification. Available structures of the rat Fc/FcRn complex (\nMartin et al., 2001, Mol Cell 7:867-877\n), and of the complexes of Fc with proteins A and G (\nDeisenhofer, 1981, Biochemistry 20:2361-2370\n; \nSauer-Eriksson et al., 1995, Structure 3:265-278\n; \nTashiro et al., 1995, Curr Opin Struct Biol 5:471-481\n) provide insight into the interaction of Fc with these proteins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA key feature of the Fc region is the conserved N-linked glycosylation that occurs at N297, shown in \nFigure 1\n. This carbohydrate, or oligosaccharide as it is sometimes referred, plays a critical structural and functional role for the antibody, and is one of the principle reasons that antibodies must be produced using mammalian expression systems. While not wanting to be limited to one theory, it is believed that the structural purpose of this carbohydrate may be to stabilize or solubilize Fc, determine a specific angle or level of flexibility between the Cγ3 and Cγ2 domains, keep the two Cγ2 domains from aggregating with one another across the central axis, or a combination of these. Efficient Fc binding to FcγR and C1q requires this modification, and alterations in the composition of the N297 carbohydrate or its elimination affect binding to these proteins (\nUmaña et al., 1999, Nat Biotechnol 17:176-180\n \n;\n \n Davies et al., 2001, Biotechnol Bioeng 74:288-294\n; \nMimura et al., 2001, J Biol Chem 276:45539-45547\n.; \nRadaev et al., 2001, J Biol Chem 276:16478-16483\n; \nShields et al., 2001, J Biol Chem 276:6591-6604\n; \nShields et al., 2002, J Biol Chem 277:26733-26740\n; \nSimmons et al., 2002, J Immunol Methods 263:133-147\n). Yet the carbohydrate makes little if any specific contact with FcγRs (\nRadaev et al., 2001, J Biol Chem 276:16469-16477\n), indicating that the functional role of the N297 carbohydrate in mediating Fc/FcγR binding may be via the structural role it plays In determining the Fc conformation. This is supported by a collection of crystal structures of four different Fc glycoforms, which show that the composition of the oligosaccharide impacts the conformation of Cγ2 and as a result the Fc/FcγR interface (\nKrapp et al., 2003, J Mol Biol 325:979-989\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe features of antibodies discussed above - specificity for target, ability to mediate immune effector mechanisms, and long half-life in serum - make antibodies powerful therapeutics. Monoclonal antibodies are used therapeutically for the treatment of a variety of conditions including cancer, inflammation, and cardiovascular disease. There are currently over ten antibody products on the market and hundreds in development. In addition to antibodies, an antibody-like protein that is finding an expanding role in research and therapy is the Fc fusion (\nChamow et al., 1996, Trends Biotechnol 14:52-60\n; \nAshkenazi et al., 1997, Curr Opin Immunol 9:195-200\n). An Fc fusion is a protein wherein one or more polypeptides is operably linked to Fc. An Fc fusion combines the Fc region of an antibody, and thus its favorable effector functions and pharmacokinetics, with the target-binding region of a receptor, ligand, or some other protein or protein domain. The role of the latter is to mediate target recognition, and thus it is functionally analogous to the antibody variable region. Because of the structural and functional overlap of Fc fusions with antibodies, the discussion on antibodies in the present invention extends directly to Fc fusions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDespite such widespread use, antibodies are not optimized for clinical use. Two significant deficiencies of antibodies are their suboptimal anticancer potency and their demanding production requirements. These deficiencies are addressed by the present invention\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are a number of possible mechanisms by which antibodies destroy tumor cells, including anti-proliferation via blockage of needed growth pathways, intracellular signaling leading to apoptosis, enhanced down regulation and/or turnover of receptors, CDC, ADCC, ADCP, and promotion of an adaptive immune response (\nCragg et al., 1999, Curr Opin Immunol 11:541-547\n; \nGlennie et al., 2000, Immunol Today 21:403-410\n). Anti-tumor efficacy may be due to a combination of these mechanisms, and their relative importance in clinical therapy appears to be cancer dependent. Despite this arsenal of anti-tumor weapons, the potency of antibodies as anti-cancer agents is unsatisfactory, particularly given their high cost. Patient tumor response data show that monoclonal antibodies provide only a small improvement in therapeutic success over normal single-agent cytotoxic chemotherapeutics. For example, just half of all relapsed low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients respond to the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab (\nMcLaughlin et al., 1998, J Clin Oncol 16:2825-2833\n). Of 166 clinical patients, 6% showed a complete response and 42% showed a partial response, with median response duration of approximately 12 months. Trastuzumab (Herceptin®, a registered trademark of Genentech), an anti-HER2/neu antibody for treatment of metastatic breast cancer, has less efficacy. The overall response rate using trastuzumab for the 222 patients tested was only 15%, with 8 complete and 26 partial responses and a median response duration and survival of 9 to 13 months (\nCobleigh et al., 1999, J Clin Oncol 17:2639-2648\n)\n.\n Currently for anticancer therapy, any small improvement in mortality rate defines success. Thus there is a significant need to enhance the capacity of antibodies to destroy targeted cancer cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA promising means for enhancing the anti-tumor potency of antibodies is via enhancement of their ability to mediate cytotoxic effector functions such as ADCC, ADCP, and CDC. The importance of FcγR-mediated effector functions for the anti-cancer activity of antibodies has been demonstrated in mice (\nClynes et al., 1998, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 95:652-656\n; \nClynes et al., 2000, Nat Med 6:443-446\n), and the affinity of interaction between Fc and certain FcγRs correlates with targeted cytotoxicity in cell-based assays (\nShields et al., 2001, J Biol Chem 276:6591-6604\n; \nPresta et al., 2002, Biochem Soc Trans 30:487-490\n; \nShields et al., 2002, J Biol Chem 277:26733-26740\n). Additionally, a correlation has been observed between clinical efficacy in humans and their allotype of high (V158) or low (F158) affinity polymorphic forms of FcγRIIIa (\nCartron et al., 2002, Blood 99:754-758\n). Together these data suggest that an antibody with an Fc region optimized for binding to certain FcγRs may better mediate effector functions and thereby destroy cancer cells more effectively in patients. The balance between activating and inhibiting receptors is an important consideration, and optimal effector function may result from an Fc with enhanced affinity for activation receptors, for example FcγRI, FcγRIIa/c, and FcγRIIIa, yet reduced affinity for the inhibitory receptor FcγRIIb. Furthermore, because FcγRs can mediate antigen uptake and processing by antigen presenting cells, enhanced Fc/FcγR affinity may also improve the capacity of antibody therapeutics to elicit an adaptive immune response.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMutagenesis studies have been carried out on Fc towards various goals, with substitutions typically made to alanine (referred to as alanine scanning) or guided by sequence homology substitutions (\nDuncan et al., 1988, Nature 332:563-564\n; \nLund et al., 1991, J Immunol 147:2657-2662\n; \nLund et al., 1992, Mol Immunol 29:53-59\n; \nJefferis et al., 1995, Immunol Lett 44:111-117\n; \nLund et al., 1995, Faseb J 9:115-119\n; \nJefferis et al., 1996, Immunol Lett 54:101-104\n; \nLund et al., 1996, J Immunol 157:4963-4969\n; \nArmour et al., 1999, Eur J Immuno/ 29:2613-2624\n; \nShields et al., 2001, J Biol Chem 276:6591-6604\n; \nJefferis et al., 2002, Immunol Lett 82:57-65\n) (\n \nUS 5,624,821\n \n; \n \nUS 5,885,573\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 00/42072\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 99/58572\n \n). The majority of substitutions reduce or ablate binding with FcγRs. However some success has been achieved at obtaining Fc variants with higher FcγR affinity. (See for example \n \nUS 5,624,821\n \n, and \n \nPCT WO 00/42072\n \n). For example, Winter and colleagues substituted the human amino acid at position 235 of mouse IgG2b antibody (a glutamic acid to leucine mutation) that increased binding of the mouse antibody to human FcγRI by100-fold (\nDuncan et al., 1988, Nature 332:563-564\n) (\n \nUS 5,624,821\n \n). Shields \net al.\n used alanine scanning mutagenesis to map Fc residues important to FcγR binding, followed by substitution of select residues with non-alanine mutations (\nShields et al., 2001, J Biol Chem 276:6591-6604\n; \nPresta et al., 2002, Biochem Soc Trans 30:487-490\n) (\n \nPCT WO 00/42072\n \n). Several mutations disclosed in this study, including S298A, E333A, and K334A, show enhanced binding to the activating receptor FcγRIIIa and reduced binding to the inhibitory receptor FcγRIIb. These mutations were combined to obtain double and triple mutation variants that show additive improvements in binding. The best variant disclosed in this study is a S298A/E333A/K334A triple mutant with approximately a 1.7-fold increase in binding to F158 FcγRIIIa, a 5-fold decrease in binding to FcγRIIb, and a 2.1-fold enhancement in ADCC.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnhanced affinity of Fc for FcγR has also been achieved using engineered glycoforms generated by expression of antibodies in engineered or variant cell lines (\nUmaña et a/., 1999, Nat Biotechnol 17:176-180\n; \nDavies et al., 2001, Biotechnol Bioeng 74:288-294\n; \nShields et a/., 2002, J Biol Chem 277:26733-26740\n; \nShinkawa et al., 2003, J Biol Chem 278:3466-3473\n). This approach has generated substantial enhancements of the capacity of antibodies to bind FcγRIIIa and to mediate ADCC. Although there are practical limitations such as the growth efficiency of the expression strains under large scale production conditions, this approach for enhancing Fc/FcγR affinity and effector function Is promising. Indeed, coupling of these alternate glycoform technologies with the Fc variants of the present invention may provide additive or synergistic effects for optimal effector function.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough there is a need for greater effector function, for some antibody therapeutics reduced or eliminated effector function may be desired. This is often the case for therapeutic antibodies whose mechanism of action involves blocking or antagonism but not killing of the cells bearing target antigen. In these cases depletion of target cells is undesirable and can be considered a side effect. For example, the ability of anti-CD4 antibodies to block CD4 receptors on T cells makes them effective anti-inflammatories, yet their ability to recruit FcγR receptors also directs immune attack against the target cells, resulting In T cell depletion (\nReddy et al., 2000, J Immunol 164:1925-1933\n). Effector function can also be a problem for radiolabeled antibodies, referred to as radioconjugates, and antibodies conjugated to toxins, referred to as immunotoxins. These drugs can be used to destroy cancer cells, but the recruitment of immune cells via Fc interaction with FcγRs brings healthy immune cells in proximity to the deadly payload (radiation or toxin), resulting in depletion of normal lymphoid tissue along with targeted cancer cells (\nHutchins et al., 1995, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 92:11980-11984\n; \nWhite et al., 2001, Annu Rev Med 52:125-145\n). This problem can potentially be circumvented by using IgG isotypes that poorly recruit complement or effector cells, for example IgG2 and IgG4. An alternate solution is to develop Fc variants that reduce or ablate binding (\nAlegre et al., 1994, Transplantation 57:1537-1543\n; \nHutchins et al., 1995, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 92:11980-11984\n; \nArmour et al., 1999, Eur J Immunol 29:2613-2624\n; \nReddy et al., 2000, J Immunol 164:1925-1933\n; \nXu et al., 2000, Cell Immunol 200:16-26\n; \nShields et al., 2001, J Biol Chem 276:6591-6604\n) (\n \nUS 6,194,551\n \n; \n \nUS 5,885,573\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 99/58572\n \n). A critical consideration for the reduction or elimination of effector function is that other important antibody properties not be perturbed. Fc variants should be engineered that not only ablate binding to FcγRs and/or C1q, but also maintain antibody stability, solubility, and structural integrity, as well as ability to interact with other important Fc ligands such as FcRn and proteins A and G.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention addresses another major shortcoming of antibodies, namely their demanding production requirements (\nGarber, 2001, Nat Biotechnol 19:184-185\n; \nDove, 2002, Nat Biotechnol 20:777-779\n). Antibodies must be expressed in mammalian cells, and the currently marketed antibodies together with other high-demand biotherapeutics consume essentially all of the available manufacturing capacity. With hundreds of biologics in development, the majority of which are antibodies, there is an urgent need for more efficient and cheaper methods of production. The downstream effects of insufficient antibody manufacturing capacity are three-fold. First, it dramatically raises the cost of goods to the producer, a cost that is passed on to the patient. Second, it hinders industrial production of approved antibody products, limiting availability of high demand therapeutics to patients. Finally, because clinical trials require large amounts of a protein that is not yet profitable, the insufficient supply impedes progress of the growing antibody pipeline to market.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternative production methods have been explored in attempts at alleviating this problem. Transgenic plants and animals are being pursued as potentially cheaper and higher capacity production systems (\nChadd et al., 2001, Curr Opin Biotechnol 12:188-194\n). Such expression systems, however, can generate glycosylation patterns significantly different from human glycoproteins. This may result in reduced or even lack of effector function because, as discussed above, the carbohydrate structure can significantly impact FcγR and complement binding. A potentially greater problem with nonhuman glycoforms may be immunogenicity; carbohydrates are a key source of antigenicity for the immune system, and the presence of nonhuman glycoforms has a significant chance of eliciting antibodies that neutralize the therapeutic, or worse cause adverse immune reactions. Thus the efficacy and safety of antibodies produced by transgenic plants and animals remains uncertain. Bacterial expression is another attractive solution to the antibody production problem. Expression in bacteria, for example \nE. coli,\n provides a cost-effective and high capacity method for producing proteins. For complex proteins such as antibodies there are a number of obstacles to bacterial expression, including folding and assembly of these complex molecules, proper disulfide formation, and solubility, stability, and functionality in the absence of glycosylation because proteins expressed in bacteria are not glycosylated. Full length unglycosylated antibodies that bind antigen have been successfully expressed in \nE. coli\n (\nSimmons et al., 2002, J Immunol Methods 263:133-147\n), and thus, folding, assembly, and proper disulfide formation of bacterially expressed antibodies are possible in the absence of the eukaryotic chaperone machinery. However the ultimate utility of bacterially expressed antibodies as therapeutics remains hindered by the lack of glycosylation, which results in lack effector function and may result in poor stability and solubility. This will likely be more problematic for formulation at the high concentrations for the prolonged periods demanded by clinical use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn aglycosylated Fc with favorable solution properties and the capacity to mediate effector functions would be significantly enabling for the alternate production methods described above. By overcoming the structural and functional shortcomings of aglycosylated Fc, antibodies can be produced in bacteria and transgenic plants and animals with reduced risk of immunogenicity, and with effector function for clinical applications in which cytotoxicity is desired such as cancer. The present invention describes the utilization of protein engineering methods to develop stable, soluble Fc variants with effector function. Currently, such Fc variants do not exist in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn summary, there is a need for antibodies with enhanced therapeutic properties. Engineering of optimized or enhanced Fc variants is a promising approach to meeting this need. Yet a substantial obstacle to engineering Fc variants with the desired properties is the difficulty in predicting what amino acid modifications, out of the enormous number of possibilities, will achieve the desired goals, coupled with the inefficient production and screening methods for antibodies. Indeed one of the principle reasons for the incomplete success of the prior art is that approaches to Fc engineering have thus far involved hit-or-miss methods such as alanine scans or production of glycoforms using different expression strains. In these studies, the Fc modifications that were made were fully or partly random in hopes of obtaining variants with favorable properties. The present invention provides a variety of engineering methods, many of which are based on more sophisticated and efficient techniques, which may be used to overcome these obstacles in order to develop Fc variants that are optimized for the desired properties. The described engineering methods provide design strategies to guide Fc modification, computational screening methods to design favorable Fc variants, library generation approaches for determining promising variants for experimental investigation, and an array of experimental production and screening methods for determining the Fc variants with favorable properties.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides Fc variants that are optimized for a number of therapeutically relevant properties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is an object of the present invention to provide novel Fc positions at which amino acid modifications may be made to generate optimized Fc variants.

The present invention describes any amino acid modification at any of said novel Fc positions in order to generate an optimized Fc variant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is a further object of the present invention to provide Fc variants that have been screened computationally.

In this way, computational screening serves as a prelude to or surrogate for experimental screening, and thus said computationally screened Fc variants are considered novel.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is a further object of the present invention to provide Fc variants that have been characterized using one or more of the experimental methods described herein.

Antibody structure and function. Shown is a model of a full length human IgG1 antibody, modeled using a humanized Fab structure from \npdb accession code\n 1 CE1 (\nJames et al., 1999, J Mol Biol 289:293-301\n) and a human IgG1 Fc structure from \npdb accession code\n 1 DN2 (\nDeLano et al., 2000, Science 287;1279-1283\n). The flexible hinge that links the Fab and Fc regions is not shown. IgG1 is a homodimer of heterodimers, made up of two light chains and two heavy chains. The Ig domains that comprise the antibody are labeled, and include V\nL\n and C\nL\n for the light chain, and V\nH\n, Cgamma1 (Cγ1), Cgamma2 (Cγ2), and Cgamma3 (Cγ3) for the heavy chain. The Fc region is labeled. Binding sites for relevant proteins are labeled, including the antigen binding site in the variable region, and the binding sites for FcγRs, FcRn, C1q, and proteins A and G in the Fc region.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2\n. The Fc/FcγRIIIb \ncomplex structure\n 1 IIS. Fc is shown as a gray ribbon diagram, and FcγRIIIb is shown as a black ribbon. The N297 carbohydrate is shown as black sticks.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 3\n. The amino acid sequence of the heavy chain of the antibody alemtuzumab (Campath®, a registered trademark of Ilex Pharmaceuticals LP), illustrating positions numbered sequentially (2 lines above the amino acid sequence) and positions numbered according to the EU index as in Kabat (2 lines below the amino acid sequence. The approximate beginnings of Ig domains VH1, Cγ1, the hinge, Cγ2, and Cγ3 are also labeled above the sequential numbering. Polymorphisms have been observed at a number of Fc positions, including but not limited to \nKabat\n 270, 272, 312, 315, 356, and 358, and thus slight differences between the presented sequence and sequences in the prior art may exist.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 4\n. Experimental library residues mapped onto the Fc/FcγRIIIb \ncomplex structure\n 1 IIS. Fc is shown as a gray ribbon diagram, and FcγRIIIb is shown as a black ribbon. Experimental library residues are shown as black ball and sticks. The N297 carbohydrate is shown as black sticks.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 5\n. The human IgG1 Fc sequence showing positions relevant to the design of the Fc variant experimental library. The sequence includes the hinge region, domain Cγ2, and domain Cγ3. Residue numbers are according to the EU index as in Kabat. Positions relevant to the experimental library are underlined. Because of observed polymorphic mutations at a number of Fc positions, slight differences between the presented sequence and sequences in the literature may exist.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 6\n. Expression of Fc variant and wild type (WT) proteins of alemtuzumab in 293T cells. Plasmids containing alemtuzumab heavy chain genes (WT or variants) were co-transfected with plasmid containing the alemtuzumab light chain gene. Media were harvested 5 days after transfection. For each transfected sample, 10ul medium was loaded on a SDS-PAGE gel for Western analysis. The probe for Western was peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, catalog # 109-035-088). WT: wild type alemtuzumab; 1-10: alemtuzumab variants. H and L indicate antibody heavy chain and light chain, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 7\n. Purification of alemtuzumab using protein A chromatography. WT alemtuzumab proteins was expressed in 293T cells and the media was harvested 5 days after transfection. The media were diluted 1:1 with PBS and purified with protein A (Pierce, Catalog # 20334). O: original sample before purification; FT: flow through; E: elution; C: concentrated final sample. The left picture shows a Simple Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gel, and the right shows a western blot labeled using peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti human IgG.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 8\n. Production of deglycosylated antibodies. Wild type and variants of alemtuzumab were expressed in 293T cells and purified with protein A chromatography. Antibodies were incubated with peptide-N-glycosidase (PNGase F) at 37°C for 24h. For each antibody, a mock treated sample (-PNGase F) was done in parallel. WT: wild-type alemtuzumab; #15, #16, #17, #18, #22: alemtuzumab variants F241 E/F243R/V262E/V264R, F241 E/F243Q/V262T/V264E, F241 R/F243Q/V262T/V264R, F241 E/F243Y/V262T/V264R, and I332E respectively. The faster migration of the PNGase F treated versus the mock treated samples represents the deglycosylated heavy chains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 9\n. Alemtuzumab expressed from 293T cells binds its antigen. The antigenic CD52 peptide, fused to GST, was expressed in \nE\n. \ncoli\n BL21 (DE3) under IPTG induction. Both uninduced and induced samples were run on a SDS-PAGE gel, and transferred to PVDF membrane. For western analysis, either alemtuzumab from Sotec (□-CD52, Sotec) (final concentration 2.5ng/ul) or media of transfected 293T cells (Campath, Xencor) (final alemtuzumab concentration approximately 0.1-0.2ng/ul) were used as primary antibody, and peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti human IgG was used as secondary antibody. M: pre-stained marker; U: un-induced sample for GST-CD52; I: induced sample for GST-CD52.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 10\n. Expression and purification of extracellular region of human V158 FcγRIIIa. Tagged FcγRIIIa was transfected in 293T cells, and media containing secreted FcγRIIIa were harvested 3 days later and purified using affinity chromatography. 1: media; 2: flow through; 3: wash; 4-8: serial elutions. Both simple blue-stained SDS-PAGE gel and western result are shown. For the western blot, membrane was probed with anti-GST antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 11\n. Binding to human V158 FcγRIIIa by select alemtuzumab Fc variants from the experimental library as determined by the AlphaScreen™ assay, described in Example 2. In the presence of competitor antibody (Fc variant or WT alemtuzumab) a characteristic inhibition curve is observed as a decrease in luminescence signal. Phosphate buffer saline (PBS) alone was used as the negative control. These data were normalized to the maximum and minimum luminescence signal provided by the baselines at low and high concentrations of competitor antibody respectively. The curves represent the fits of the data to a one site competition model using nonlinear regression. These fits provide IC50s for each antibody, illustrated for WT and S239D by the dotted lines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigures 12\n. AlphaScreen™ assay showing binding of select alemtuzumab Fc variants to human FcγRIIb. The data were normalized, and the curves represent the fits of the data to a one site competition model.

Such definitions are meant to encompass grammatical equivalents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \n\"ADCC\"\n or \"\nantibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity\"\n as used herein is meant the cell-mediated reaction wherein nonspecific cytotoxic cells that express FcγRs recognize bound antibody on a target cell and subsequently cause lysis of the target cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \"\nADCP\n\" or \nantibody dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis\n as used herein is meant the cell-mediated reaction wherein nonspecific cytotoxic cells that express FcγRs recognize bound antibody on a target cell and subsequently cause phagocytosis of the target cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \"\namino acid modification\"\n herein is meant an amino acid substitution, insertion, and/or deletion in a polypeptide sequence. The preferred amino acid modification herein is a substitution. **TT\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \"\nantibody\n\" herein is meant a protein consisting of one or more polypeptides substantially encoded by all or part of the recognized immunoglobulin genes. The recognized immunoglobulin genes, for example in humans, include the kappa (□), lambda (□), and heavy chain genetic loci, which together comprise the myriad variable region genes, and the constant region genes mu (□), delta (□), gamma (γ), sigma (□), and alpha (□) which encode the IgM, IgD, IgG, IgE, and IgA isotypes respectively. Antibody herein is meant to include full length antibodies and antibody fragments, and may refer to a natural antibody from any organism, an engineered antibody, or an antibody generated recombinantly for experimental, therapeutic, or other purposes as further defined below. Thus, \"antibody\" includes both polyclonal and monoclonal antibody (mAb). Methods of preparation and purification of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies are known in the art and e.g., are described in \nHarlow and Lane, Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual (New York: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1988\n). As outlined herein, \"antibody' specifically includes Fc variants described herein, \"full length\" antibodies including the Fc variant fragments described herein, and Fc variant fusions to other proteins as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nn some embodiments, antibodies can be neutralizing or inhibitory, or stimulatory, and in preferred embodiments, as described herein, the stimulatory activity is measured by an increase in affinitiy of a variant antibody to a receptor, as compared to either the parent antibody (e.g. when a non-naturally occurring variant is used as the starting point for the computation analysis herein), or to the original wild-type antibody. Accordingly, by \"neutralization,\" \"neutralize,\" \"neutralizing\" and grammatical equivalents herein is meant to inhibit or lessen the biological effect of the antibody, in some cases by binding (e.g. competitively) to a antigen and avoiding or decreasing the biological effect of binding, or by binding that results in decreasing the biological effect of binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"antibody\" include antibody fragments, as are known in the art, such as Fab, Fab', F(ab')2, Fcs or other antigen-binding subsequences of antibodies, such as, single chain antibodies (Fv for example), chimeric antibodies, etc., either produced by the modification of whole antibodies or those synthesized de novo using recombinant DNA technologies. Particularly preferred are Fc variants as described herein. The term \"antibody\" further comprises polyclonal antibodies and mAbs which can be agonist or antagonist antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies of the invention specifically bind to Fc receptors, as outlined herein. By \"specifically bind\" herein is meant that the LC antibodies have a binding constant in the range of at least 10\n-4\n - 10\n-6\n M\n-1\n, with a preferred range being 10\n-7\n - 10\n-9\n M\n-1\n.\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the antibodies of the invention are humanized. Using current monoclonal antibody technology one can produce a humanized antibody to virtually any target antigen that can be identified [\nStein, Trends Blotechnol. 15:88-90 (1997\n)]. Humanized forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies are chimeric molecules of immunoglobulins, immunoglobulin chains or fragments thereof (such as Fv, Fc, Fab, Fab', F(ab')2 or other antigen-binding subsequences of antibodies) which contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. Humanized antibodies include human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues form a complementary determining region (CDR) of the recipient are replaced by residues from a CDR of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat or rabbit having the desired specificity, affinity and capacity. In some instances, Fv framework residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Humanized antibodies may also comprise residues which are found neither in the recipient antibody nor in the imported CDR or framework sequences. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. The humanized antibody optimally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin [\nJones et al., Nature 321:522-525 (1986\n); \nRiechmann et al., Nature 332:323-329 (1988\n); and \nPresta, Curr. Op. Struct. Biol. 2:593-596 (1992\n)]. Methods for humanizing non-human antibodies are well known in the art. Generally, a humanized antibody has one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source which is non-human. These non-human amino acid residues are often referred to as import residues, which are typically taken from an import variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co-workers [Jones et al., supra; Riechmann et al., supra; and \nVerhoeyen et al., Science, 239:1534-1536 (1988\n)], by substituting rodent CDRs or CDR sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Additional examples of humanized murine monoclonal antibodies are also known in the art, e.g., antibodies binding human protein C [\nO'Connor et al., Protein Eng. 11:321-8 (1998\n)], \ninterleukin\n 2 receptor [\nQueen et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U.S.A. 86:10029-33 (1989\n]), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [\nCarter et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89:4285-9 (1992\n)]. Accordingly, such humanized antibodies are chimeric antibodies (\n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,816,567\n \n), wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non-human species. In practice, humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some CDR residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment, the antibodies of the invention are based on human sequences, and are thus human sequences are used as the \"base\" sequences, against which other sequences, such as rat, mouse and monkey sequences. In order to establish homology to primary sequence or structure, the amino acid sequence of a precursor or parent Fc is directly compared to the human Fc sequence outlined herein. After aligning the sequences, using one or more of the homology alignment programs described herein (for example using conserved residues as between species), allowing for necessary insertions and deletions in order to maintain alignment (i.e., avoiding the elimination of conserved residues through arbitrary deletion and insertion), the residues equivalent to particular amino acids in the primary sequence of human Fc are defined. Alignment of conserved residues preferably should conserve 100% of such residues. However, alignment of greater than 75% or as little as 50% of conserved residues is also adequate to define equivalent residues (sometimes referred to herein as \"corresponding residues\").\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEquivalent residues may also be defined by determining homology at the level of tertiary structure for an Fc fragment whose tertiary structure has been determined by x-ray crystallography. Equivalent residues are defined as those for which the atomic coordinates of two or more of the main chain atoms of a particular amino acid residue of the parent or precursor (N on N, CA on CA, C on C and O on O) are within 0.13 nm and preferably 0.1 nm after alignment. Alignment is achieved after the best model has been oriented and positioned to give the maximum overlap of atomic coordinates of non-hydrogen protein atoms of the Fc variant fragment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecifically included within the definition of \"antibody\" are aglycosylated antibodies. By \"\naglycosylated antibody\"\n as used herein is meant an antibody that lacks carbohydrate attached at position 297 of the Fc region, wherein numbering is according to the EU system as in Kabat. The aglycosylated antibody may be a deglycosylated antibody, that is an antibody for which the Fc carbohydrate has been removed, for example chemically or enzymatically. Alternatively, the aglycosylated antibody may be a nonglycosylated or unglycosylated antibody, that is an antibody that was expressed without Fc carbohydrate, for example by mutation of one or residues that encode the glycosylation pattern or by expression in an organism that does not attach carbohydrates to proteins, for example bacteria.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecifically included within the definition of \"antibody\" are full-length antibodies that contain an Fc variant portion. .By \n\"full length antibody\"\n herein is meant the structure that constitutes the natural biological form of an antibody, including variable and constant regions. For example, in most mammals, including humans and mice, the full length antibody of the IgG class is a tetramer and consists of two identical pairs of two immunoglobulin chains, each pair having one light and one heavy chain, each light chain comprising immunoglobulin domains V\nL\n and C\nL\n, and each heavy chain comprising immunoglobulin domains V\nH\n, Cγ1, Cγ2, and Cγ3. In some mammals, for example in camels and Ilamas, IgG antibodies may consist of only two heavy chains, each heavy chain comprising a variable domain attached to the Fc region. By \"\nIgG\n\" as used herein is meant a polypeptide belonging to the class of antibodies that are substantially encoded by a recognized immunoglobulin gamma gene. In humans this class comprises IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4. In mice this class comprises IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \"\namino acid\"\n and \"\namino acid identity\"\n as used herein is meant one of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids or any non-natural analogues that may be present at a specific, defined position. By \"protein\" herein is meant at least two covalently attached amino acids, which includes proteins, polypeptides, oligopeptides and peptides. The protein may be made up of naturally occurring amino acids and peptide bonds, or synthetic peptidomimetic structures, i.e. \"analogs\", such as peptoids (see \nSimon et al., PNAS USA 89(20):9367 (1992\n)) particularly when LC peptides are to be administered to a patient. Thus \"amino acid\", or \"peptide residue\", as used herein means both naturally occurring and synthetic amino acids. For example, homophenylalanine, citrulline and noreleucine are considered amino acids for the purposes of the invention. \"Amino acid\" also includes imino acid residues such as proline and hydroxyproline. The side chain may be in either the (R) or the (S) configuration. In the preferred embodiment, the amino acids are in the (S) or L-configuration. If non-naturally occurring side chains are used, non-amino acid substituents may be used, for example to prevent or retard in vivo degradation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \"\ncomputational screening method\"\n herein is meant any method for designing one or more mutations in a protein, wherein said method utilizes a computer to evaluate the energies of the interactions of potential amino acid side chain substitutions with each other and/or with the rest of the protein. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, evaluation of energies, referred to as energy calculation, refers to some method of scoring one or more amino acid modifications. Said method may involve a physical or chemical energy term, or may involve knowledge-, statistical-, sequence-based energy terms, and the like. The calculations that compose a computational screening method are herein referred to as \"\ncomputational screening calculations\".\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \n\"effector function\"\n as used herein is meant a biochemical event that results from the interaction of an antibody Fc region with an Fc receptor or ligand. Effector functions include but are not limited to ADCC, ADCP, and CDC. By \n\"effector cell\"\n as used herein is meant a cell of the immune system that expresses one or more Fc receptors and mediates one or more effector functions. Effector cells include but are not limited to monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, eosinophils, mast cells, platelets, B cells, large granular lymphocytes, Langerhans' cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and γγ T cells, and may be from any organism including but not limited to humans, mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys. By \n\"library\"\n herein is meant a set of Fc variants in any form, including but not limited to a list of nucleic acid or amino acid sequences, a list of nucleic acid or amino acid substitutions at variable positions, a physical library comprising nucleic acids that encode the library sequences, or a physical library comprising the Fc variant proteins, either in purified or unpurified form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \"\nFc\n\", \n\"Fc region\"\n, \nFC polypeptide\"\n, etc. as used herein is meant an antibody as defined herein that includes the polypeptides comprising the constant region of an antibody excluding the first constant region immunoglobulin domain. Thus Fc refers to the last two constant region immunoglobulin domains of IgA, IgD, and IgG, and the last three constant region immunoglobulin domains of IgE and IgM, and the flexible hinge N-terminal to these domains. For IgA and IgM Fc may include the J chain. For IgG, as illustrated in \nFigure 1\n, Fc comprises immunoglobulin domains Cgamma2 and Cgamma3 (Cγ2 and Cγ3) and the hinge between Cgamma1 (Cy1) and Cgamma2 (Cγ2). Although the boundaries of the Fc region may vary, the human IgG heavy chain Fc region is usually defined to comprise residues C226 or P230 to its carboxyl-terminus, wherein the numbering is according to the EU index as in Kabat. Fc may refer to this region In isolation, or this region in the context of an antibody, antibody fragment, or Fc fusion. An Fc may be an antibody, Fc fusion, or an protein or protein domain that comprises Fc. Particularly preferred are Fc variants, which are non-naturally occurring variants of an Fc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \"\nFc fusion\"\n as used herein is meant a protein wherein one or more polypeptides is operably linked to Fc. Fc fusion is herein meant to be synonymous with the terms \"immunoadhesin\", \"Ig fusion\", \"Ig chimera\", and \"receptor globulin\" (sometimes with dashes) as used in the prior art (\nChamow et al., 1996, Trends Biotechnol 14:52-60\n; \nAshkenazi et al., 1997, Curr Opin Immunol 9:195-200\n). An Fc fusion combines the Fc region of an immunoglobulin with a fusion partner, which in general can be any protein, including, but not limited to, the target-binding region of a receptor, an adhesion molecule, a ligand, an enzyme, or some other protein or protein domain. The role of the non-Fc part of an Fc fusion is to mediate target binding, and thus it is functionally analogous to the variable regions of an antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \n\"Fc gamma receptor\"\n or \"\nFcγR\n\" as used herein is meant any member of the family of proteins that bind the IgG antibody Fc region and are substantially encoded by the FcγR genes. In humans this family includes but is not limited to FcγRI (CD64), including isoforms FcγRIa, FcγRIb, and FcγRIc; FcγRII (CD32), including isoforms FcγRIIa (including allotypes H131 and R131), FcγRIIb (including FcγRIIb-1 and FcγRIIb-2), and FcγRIIc; and FcγRIII (CD16), including isoforms FcγRIIIa (including allotypes V158 and F158) and FcγRIIIb (including allotypes FcγRIIIb-NA1 and FcγRIIIb-NA2) (\nJefferis et al., 2002, Immunol Lett 82:57-65\n), as well as any undiscovered human FcγRs or FcγR isoforms or allotypes. An FcγR may be from any organism, including but not limited to humans, mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys. Mouse FcγRs include but are not limited to FcγRI (CD64), FcγRII (CD32), FcγRIII (CD16), and FcγRIII-2 (CD16-2), as well as any undiscovered mouse FcγRs or FcγR isoforms or allotypes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \n\"Fc ligand\"\n as used herein is meant a molecule, preferably a polypeptide, from any organism that binds to the Fc region of an antibody to form an Fc-ligand complex. Fc ligands include but are not limited to FcγRs, FcγRs, FcγRs, FcRn, C1q, C3, mannan binding lectin, mannose receptor, \nstaphylococcal\n protein A, \nstreptococcal\n protein G, and viral FcγR. Fc ligands may include undiscovered molecules that bind Fc\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \"\nIgG\n\" as used herein is meant a polypeptide belonging to the class of antibodies that are substantially encoded by a recognized immunoglobulin gamma gene. In humans this class comprises IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4. In mice this class comprises IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG3. By \n\"immunoglobulin (Ig)\n\" herein is meant a protein consisting of one or more polypeptides substantially encoded by immunoglobulin genes. Immunoglobulins include but are not limited to antibodies. Immunoglobulins may have a number of structural forms, including but not limited to full length antibodies, antibody fragments, and individual immunoglobulin domains. By \n\"immunoglobulin (Ig) domain\"\n herein is meant a region of an immunoglobulin that exists as a distinct structural entity as ascertained by one skilled in the art of protein structure. Ig domains typically have a characteristic □-sandwich folding topology. The known Ig domains in the IgG class of antibodies are V\nH\n, Cγ1, Cγ2, Cγ3, V\nL\n, and C\nL\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \"\nparent polypeptide\n\" or \n\"precursor polypeptide\"\n (including Fc parent or precursors) as used herein is meant a polypeptide that is subsequently modified to generate a variant. Said parent polypeptide may be a naturally occurring polypeptide, or a variant or engineered version of a naturally occurring polypeptide. Parent polypeptide may refer to the polypeptide itself, compositions that comprise the parent polypeptide, or the amino acid sequence that encodes it. Accordingly, by \n\"parent Fc polypeptide\"\n as used herein is meant an unmodified Fc polypeptide that is modified to generate a variant, and by \"\nparent antibody\"\n as used herein is meant an unmodified antibody that is modified to generate a variant antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs outlined above, certain positions of the Fc molecule can be altered. By \n\"position\n\" as used herein is meant a location in the sequence of a protein. Positions may be numbered sequentially, or according to an established format, for example the EU index as in Kabat. For example, position 297 is a position in the human antibody IgG1. Corresponding positions are determined as outlined above, generally through alignment with other parent sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \"residue\" as used herein is meant a position in a protein and its associated amino acid identity. For example, Daragine 297 (also referred to as N297, also referred to as N297) is a residue in the human antibody IgG1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \n\"target antigen\"\n as used herein is meant the molecule that is bound specifically by the variable region of a given antibody. A target antigen may be a protein, carbohydrate, lipid, or other chemical compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \n\"target cell\"\n as used herein is meant a cell that expresses a target antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \n\"variable region\"\n as used herein is meant the region of an immunoglobulin that comprises one or more Ig domains substantially encoded by any of the V□, V□, and/or V\nH\n genes that make up the kappa, lambda, and heavy chain immunoglobulin genetic loci respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \"\nvariant polypeptide\"\n as used herein is meant a polypeptide sequence that differs from that of a parent polypeptide sequence by virtue of at least one amino acid modification. Variant polypeptide may refer to the polypeptide itself, a composition comprising the polypeptide, or the amino sequence that encodes it. Preferably, the variant polypeptide has at least one amino acid modification compared to the parent polypeptide, e.g. from about one to about ten amino acid modifications, and preferably from about one to about five amino acid modifications compared to the parent. The variant polypeptide sequence herein will preferably possess at least about 80% homology with a parent polypeptide sequence, and most preferably at least about 90% homology, more preferably at least about 95% homology. Accordingly, by \n\"Fc variant\n\" as used herein is meant an Fc sequence that differs from that of a parent Fc sequence by virtue of at least one amino acid modification. An Fc variant may only encompass an Fc region, or may exist in the context of an antibody, Fc fusion, or other polypeptide that is substantially encoded by Fc. Fc variant may refer to the Fc polypeptide itself, compositions comprising the Fc variant polypeptide, or the amino acid sequence that encodes it.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor all positions discussed in the present invention, numbering of an immunoglobulin heavy chain is according to the EU index (\nKabat et al., 1991, Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed., United States Public Health Svice, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda\n). The \"EU index as in Kabat\" refers to the residue numbering of the human IgG1 EU antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Fc variants of the present invention may be optimized for a variety of properties. Properties that may be optimized include but are not limited to enhanced or reduced affinity for an FcγR. In a preferred embodiment, the Fc variants of the present invention are optimized to possess enhanced affinity for a human activating FcγR, preferably FcγRI, FcγRIIa, FcγRIIc, FcγRIIIa, and FcγRIIIb, most preferably FcγRIIIa. In an alternately preferred embodiment, the Fc variants are optimized to possess reduced affinity for the human inhibitory receptor FcγRIIb. These preferred embodiments are anticipated to provide antibodies and Fc fusions with enhanced therapeutic properties in humans, for example enhanced effector function and greater anti-cancer potency. In an alternate embodiment, the Fc variants of the present invention are optimized to have reduced or ablated affinity for a human FcγR, including but not limited to FcγRI, FcγRIIa, FcγRIIb, FcγRIIc, FcγRIIIa, and FcγRIIIb. These embodiments are anticipated to provide antibodies and Fc fusions with enhanced therapeutic properties in humans, for example reduced effector function and reduced toxicity. Preferred embodiments comprise optimization of Fc binding to a human FcγR, however in alternate embodiments the Fc variants of the present invention possess enhanced or reduced affinity for FcγRs from nonhuman organisms, including but not limited to mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys. Fc variants that are optimized for binding to a nonhuman FcγR may find use in experimentation. For example, mouse models are available for a variety of diseases that enable testing of properties such as efficacy, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics for a given drug candidate. As is known in the art, cancer cells can be grafted or injected Into mice to mimic a human cancer, a process referred to as xenografting. Testing of antibodies or Fc fusions that comprise Fc variants that are optimized for one or more mouse FcγRs, may provide valuable information with regard to the efficacy of the antibody or Fc fusion, its mechanism of action, and the like. The Fc variants of the present invention may also be optimized for enhanced functionality and/or solution properties in aglycosylated form. In a preferred embodiment, the aglycosylated Fc variants of the present invention bind an Fc ligand with greater affinity than the aglycosylated form of the parent Fc polypeptide. Said Fc ligands include but are not limited to FcγRs, C1q, FcRn, and proteins A and G, and may be from any source including but not limited to human, mouse, rat, rabbit, or monkey, preferably human. In an alternately preferred embodiment, the Fc variants are optimized to be more stable and/or more soluble than the aglycosylated form of the parent Fc polypeptide. An Fc variant that Is engineered or predicted to display any of the aforementioned optimized properties is herein referred to as an \n\"optimized Fc variant\".\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Fc variants of the present invention may be derived from parent Fc polypeptides that are themselves from a wide range of sources. The parent Fc polypeptide may be substantially encoded by one or more Fc genes from any organism, including but not limited to humans, mice, rats, rabbits, camels, Ilamas, dromedaries, monkeys, preferably mammals and most preferably humans and mice. In a preferred embodiment, the parent Fc polypeptide composes an antibody, referred to as the parent antibody. The parent antibody may be fully human, obtained for example using transgenic mice (\nBruggemann et al., 1997, Curr Opin Biotechnol 8:455-458\n) or human antibody libraries coupled with selection methods (\nGriffiths et al., 1998, Curr Opin Biotechnol 9:102-108\n). The parent antibody need not be naturally occurring. For example, the parent antibody may be an engineered antibody, including but not limited to chimeric antibodies and humanized antibodies (\nClark, 2000, Immunol Today 21:397-402\n). The parent antibody may be an engineered variant of an antibody that is substantially encoded by one or more natural antibody genes. In one embodiment, the parent antibody has been affinity matured, as is known in the art. Alternatively, the antibody has been modified in some other way, for example as described in \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/339788, filed on March 3, 2003\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Fc variants of the present invention may be substantially encoded by immunoglobulin genes belonging to any of the antibody classes. In a preferred embodiment, the Fc variants of the present invention find use in antibodies or Fc fusions that comprise sequences belonging to the IgG class of antibodies, including IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4. In an alternate embodiment the Fc variants of the present invention find use in antibodies or Fc fusions that comprise sequences belonging to the IgA (including subclasses IgA1 and IgA2), IgD, IgE, IgG, or IgM classes of antibodies. The Fc variants of the present invention may comprise more than one protein chain. That is, the present invention may find use in an antibody or Fc fusion that is a monomer or an oligomer, including a homo- or hetero-oligomer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Fc variants of the present invention may be combined with other Fc modifications, including but not limited to modifications that alter effector function. Such combination may provide additive, synergistic, or novel properties in antibodies or Fc fusions. In one embodiment, the Fc variants of the present invention may be combined with other known Fc variants (\nDuncan et al., 1988, Nature 332:563-564\n; \nLund et al., 1991, J Immunol 147:2657-2662\n; \nLund et al., 1992, Mol Immunol 29:53-59\n; \nAlegre et al., 1994, Transplantation 57:1537-1543\n; \nHutchins et al., 1995, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 92:11980-11984\n; \nJefferis et al., 1995, Immunol Lett 44:111-117\n; \nLund et al., 1995, Faseb J 9:115-119\n; \nJefferis et al., 1996, Immunol Lett 54:101-104\n; \nLund et al., 1996, J Immunol 157:4963-4969\n; \nArmour et al., 1999, Eur J Immunol 29:2613-2624\n; \nIdusogie et al., 2000, J Immunol 164:4178-4184\n; \nReddy et al., 2000, J Immunol 164:1925-1933\n; \nXu et al., 2000, Cell Immunol 200:16-26\n; \nIdusogie et al., 2001, J Immunol 166:2571-2575\n; \nShields et al., 2001, J Biol Chem 276:6591-6604\n; \nJefferis et al., 2002, Immunol Lett 82:57-65\n; \nPresta et al., 2002, Biochem Soc Trans 30:487-490\n) (\n \nUS 5,624,821\n \n; \n \nUS 5,885,573\n \n; \n \nUS 6,194,551\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 00/42072\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 99/58572\n \n). In an alternate embodiment, the Fc variants of the present invention are incorporated into an antibody or Fc fusion that comprises one or more engineered glycoforms. By \n\"engineered glycoform\"\n as used herein is meant a carbohydrate composition that is covalently attached to an Fc polypeptide, wherein said carbohydrate composition differs chemically from that of a parent Fc polypeptide. Engineered glycoforms may be useful for a variety of purposes, including but not limited to enhancing or reducing effector function. Engineered glycoforms may be generated by any method, for example by using engineered or variant expression strains, by co-expression with one or more enzymes, for example □1-4- N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnTIII), by expressing an Fc polypeptide in various organisms or cell lines from various organisms, or by modifying carbohydrate(s) after the Fc polypeptide has been expressed. Methods for generating engineered glycoforms are known in the art, and include but are not limited to (\nUmaña et al., 1999, Nat Biotechno/ 17:176-180\n; \nDavies et al., 2001, Biotechnol Bioeng 74:288-294\n; \nShields et al., 2002, J Biol Chem 277:26733-26740\n; \nShinkawa et al., 2003, J Biol Chem 278:3466-3473\n) \n \nUS 6,602,684\n \n; \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/277,370\n \n; \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/113,929\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 00/61739A1\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 01/29246A1\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 02/31140A1\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 02/30954A1\n \n; Potelligent™ technology (Biowa, Inc., Princeton, N.J.); GlycoMAb™ glycosylation engineering technology (GLYCART biotechnology AG, Zürich, Switzerland)). Engineered glycoform typically refers to the different carbohydrate or oligosaccharide; thus an Fc polypeptide, for example an antibody or Fc fusion, may comprise an engineered glycoform. Alternatively, engineered glycoform may refer to the Fc polypeptide that comprises the different carbohydrate or oligosaccharide. Thus combinations of the Fc variants of the present invention with other Fc modifications, as well as undiscovered Fc modifications, are contemplated with the goal of generating novel antibodies or Fc fusions with optimized properties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Fc variants of the present invention may find use in an antibody. By \n\"antibody of the present invention\"\n as used herein is meant an antibody that comprises an Fc variant of the present invention. The present invention may, in fact, find use in any protein that comprises Fc, and thus application of the Fc variants of the present invention is not limited to antibodies. The Fc variants of the present invention may find use in an Fc fusion. By \"Fc \nfusion of the present invention\"\n as used herein refers to an Fc fusion that comprises an Fc variant of the present invention. Fc fusions may comprise an Fc variant of the present invention operably linked to a cytokine, soluble receptor domain, adhesion molecule, ligand, enzyme, peptide, or other protein or protein domain, and include but are not limited to Fc fusions described in \n \nUS 5,843,725\n \n; \n \nUS 6,018,026\n \n; \n \nUS 6,291,212\n \n; \n \nUS 6,291,646\n \n; \n \nUS 6,300,099\n \n; \n \nUS 6,323,323\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 00/24782\n \n; and in (\nChamow et al., 1996, Trends Biotechnol 14:52-60\n \n;\n \nAshkenazi et al., 1997, Curr Opin Immunol 9:195-200\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVirtually any antigen may be targeted by the antibodies and fusions of the present invention, including but are not limited to the following list of proteins, subunits, domains, motifs, and epitopes belonging to the following list of proteins: CD2; CD3, CD3E, CD4, CD11, CD11a, CD14, CD16, CD18, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD23, CD25, CD28, CD29, CD30, CD32, CD33 (p67 protein), CD38, CD40, CD40L, CD52, CD54, CD56, CD80, CD147, GD3, IL-1, IL-1R, IL-2, IL-2R, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-6R, IL-8, IL-12, IL-15, IL-18, IL-23, interferon alpha, Interferon beta, interferon gamma; TNF-alpha, TNFbeta2, TNFc, TNFalphabeta, TNF-RI, TNF-RII, FasL, CD27L, CD30L, 4-1 BBL, TRAIL, RANKL, TWEAK, APRIL, BAFF, LIGHT, VEGI, OX40L, TRAIL Receptor-1, A1 Adenosine Receptor, Lymphotoxin Beta Receptor, TACI, BAFF-R, EPO; LFA-3, ICAM-1, ICAM-3, EpCAM, integrin beta1, integrin beta2, integrin alpha4/beta7, integrin alpha2, integrin alpha3, integrin alpha4, integrin alpha5, integrin alpha6, integrin alphav, alphaVbeta3 integrin, FGFR-3, Keratinocyte Growth Factor, VLA-1, VLA-4, L-selectin, anti-Id, E-selectin, HLA, HLA-DR, CTLA-4, T cell receptor, B7-1, B7-2, VNRintegrin, TGFbeta1, TGFbeta2, eotaxin1, BLyS (B-lymphocyte Stimulator), complement C5, IgE, factor VII, CD64, CBL, NCA 90, EGFR (ErbB-1), Her2/neu (ErbB-2), Her3 (ErbB-3), Her4 (ErbB-4), Tissue Factor, VEGF, VEGFR, endothelin receptor, VLA-4, Hapten NP-cap or NIP-cap, T cell receptor alpha/beta, E-selectin, digoxin, placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) and testicular PLAP-like alkaline phosphatase, transferrin receptor, Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), CEACAM5, HMFG PEM, mucin MUC1, MUC18, Heparanase I, human cardiac myosin, tumor-associated glycoprotein-72 (TAG-72), tumor-associated antigen CA 125, Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), High molecular weight melanoma-associated antigen (HMW-MAA), carcinoma-associated antigen, Gcoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa), tumor-associated antigen expressing Lewis Y related carbohydrate, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) gH envelope glycoprotein, HIV gp120, HCMV, respiratory syncital virus RSV F, RSVF Fgp, VNRintegrin, IL-8, cytokeratin tumor-associated antigen, Hep B gp120, CMV, gpIIbIIIa, HIV IIIB gp120 V3 loop, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) Fgp, Herpes simplex virus (HSV) gD glycoprotein, HSV gB glycoprotein, HCMV gB envelope glycoprotein, and \nClostridium perfringens\n toxin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne skilled in the art will appreciate that the aforementioned list of targets refers not only to specific proteins and biomolecules, but the biochemical pathway or pathways that comprise them. For example, reference to CTLA-4 as a target antigen implies that the ligands and receptors that make up the T cell co-stimulatory pathway, including CTLA-4, B7-1, B7-2, CD28, and any other undiscovered ligands or receptors that bind these proteins, are also targets. Thus target as used herein refers not only to a specific biomolecule, but the set of proteins that interact with said target and the members of the biochemical pathway to which said target belongs. One skilled in the art will further appreciate that any of the aforementioned target antigens, the ligands or receptors that bind them, or other members of their corresponding biochemical pathway, may be operably linked to the Fc variants of the present invention in order to generate an Fc fusion. Thus for example, an Fc fusion that targets EGFR could be constructed by operably linking an Fc variant to EGF, TGF□, or any other ligand, discovered or undiscovered, that binds EGFR. Accordingly, an Fc variant of the present invention could be operably linked to EGFR in order to generate an Fc fusion that binds EGF, TGF□, or any other ligand, discovered or undiscovered, that binds EGFR. Thus virtually any polypeptide, whether a ligand, receptor, or some other protein or protein domain, including but not limited to the aforementioned targets and the proteins that compose their corresponding biochemical pathways, may be operably linked to the Fc variants of the present invention to develop an Fc fusion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA number of antibodies and Fc fusions that are approved for use, in clinical trials, or in development may benefit from the Fc variants of the present invention. Said antibodies and Fc fusions are herein referred to as \"clinical \nproducts and candidates\".\n Thus in a preferred embodiment, the Fc variants of the present invention may find use in a range of clinical products and candidates. For example, a number of antibodies that target CD20 may benefit from the Fc variants of the present invention. For example the Fc variants of the present invention may find use in an antibody that is substantially similar to rituximab (Rituxan®, IDEC/Genentech/Roche) (see for example \n \nUS 5,736,137\n \n), a chimeric anti-CD20 antibody approved to treat Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; HuMax-CD20, an anti-CD20 currently being developed by Genmab, an anti-CD20 antibody described in \n \nUS 5,500,362\n \n, AME-133 (Applied Molecular Evolution), hA20 (Immunomedics, Inc.), and HumaLYM (Intracel). A number of antibodies that target members of the family of epidermal growth factor receptors, including EGFR (ErbB-1), Her2/neu (ErbB-2), Her3 (ErbB-3), Her4 (ErbB-4), may benefit from the Fc variants of the present invention. For example the Fc variants of the present invention may find use in an antibody that is substantially similar to trastuzumab (Herceptin®, Genentech) (see for example \n \nUS 5,677,171\n \n), a humanized anti-Her2/neu antibody approved to treat breast cancer; pertuzumab (rhuMab-2C4, Omnitarg™), currently being developed by Genentech; an anti-Her2 antibody described in \n \nUS 4,753,894\n \n; cetuximab (Erbitux®, Imclone) (\n \nUS 4,943,533\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 96/40210\n \n), a chimeric anti-EGFR antibody in clinical trials for a variety of cancers; ABX-EGF (\n \nUS 6,235,883\n \n), currently being developed by Abgenix/Immunex/Amgen; HuMax-EGFr (\n \nUSSN 10/172,317\n \n), currently being developed by Genmab; 425, EMD55900, EMD62000, and EMD72000 (Merck KGaA) (\n \nUS 5558864\n \n; \nMurthy et al. 1987, Arch Biochem Biophys. 252(2):549-60\n; \nRodeck et al., 1987, J Cell Biochem. 35(4):315-20\n; \nKettleborough et al., 1991, Protein Eng. 4(7):773-83\n); ICR62 (Institute of Cancer Research) (\n \nPCT WO 95/20045\n \n; \nModjtahedi et al., 1993, J.

constrained to their precise composition. The Fc variants of the present invention may be incorporated into the aforementioned clinical candidates and products, or into antibodies and Fc fusions that are substantially similar to them. The Fc variants of the present invention may be incorporated into versions of the aforementioned clinical candidates and products that are humanized, affinity matured, engineered, or modified in some other way. Furthermore, the entire polypeptide of the aforementioned clinical products and candidates need not be used to construct a new antibody or Fc fusion that incorporates the Fc variants of the present invention; for example only the variable region of a clinical product or candidate antibody, a substantially similar variable region, or a humanized, affinity matured, engineered, or modified version of the variable region may be used. In another embodiment, the Fc variants of the present invention may find use in an antibody or Fc fusion that binds to the same epitope, antigen, ligand, or receptor as one of the aforementioned clinical products and candidates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Fc variants of the present invention may find use in a wide range of antibody and Fc fusion products. In one embodiment the antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention is a therapeutic, a diagnostic, or a research reagent, preferably a therapeutic. Alternatively, the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention may be used for agricultural or industrial uses. In an alternate embodiment, the Fc variants of the present invention compose a library that may be screened experimentally. This library may be a list of nucleic acid or amino acid sequences, or may be a physical composition of nucleic acids or polypeptides that encode the library sequences. The Fc variant may find use in an antibody composition that is monoclonal or polyclonal. In a preferred embodiment, the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention are used to kill target cells that bear the target antigen, for example cancer cells. In an alternate embodiment, the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention are used to block, antagonize, or agonize the target antigen, for example for antagonizing a cytokine or cytokine receptor. In an alternately preferred embodiment, the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present Invention are used to block, antagonize, or agonize the target antigen and kill the target cells that bear the target antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Fc variants of the present invention may be used for various therapeutic purposes. In a preferred embodiment, the Fc variant proteins are administered to a patient to treat an antibody-related disorder. A \n\"patient\"\n for the purposes of the present invention includes both humans and other animals, preferably mammals and most preferably humans. Thus the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention have both human therapy and veterinary applications. In the preferred embodiment the patient is a mammal, and in the most preferred embodiment the patient is human. The term \"\ntreatment\n\" in the present invention is meant to include therapeutic treatment, as well as prophylactic, or suppressive measures for a disease or disorder. Thus, for example, successful administration of an antibody or Fc fusion prior to onset of the disease results in treatment of the disease. As another example, successful administration of an optimized antibody or Fc fusion after clinical manifestation of the disease to combat the symptoms of the disease comprises treatment of the disease. \"Treatment\" also encompasses administration of an optimized antibody or Fc fusion protein after the appearance of the disease in order to eradicate the disease. Successful administration of an agent after onset and after clinical symptoms have developed, with possible abatement of clinical symptoms and perhaps amelioration of the disease, comprises treatment of the disease. Those \"\nin need of treatment\"\n include mammals already having the disease or disorder, as well as those prone to having the disease or disorder, including those in which the disease or disorder is to be prevented. By \"\nantibody related disorder\"\n or \"\nantibody responsive disorder\"\n or \"\ncondition\n\" or \"\ndisease\n\" herein are meant a disorder that may be ameliorated by the administration of a pharmaceutical composition comprising an antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention. Antibody related disorders include but are not limited to autoimmune diseases, immunological diseases, infectious diseases, inflammatory diseases, neurological diseases, and oncological and neoplastic diseases including cancer.

For instance, radiation therapy may be administered to patients having head and neck cancer for about 6 to about 7 weeks. Optionally, the radiation therapy may be administered as a single dose or as multiple, sequential doses. The skilled medical practitioner can determine empirically the appropriate dose or doses of radiation therapy useful herein. In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, the antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention and one or more other anti-cancer therapies are employed to treat cancer cells \nex vivo.\n It is contemplated that such \nex vivo\n treatment may be useful in bone marrow transplantation and particularly, autologous bone marrow transplantation. For instance, treatment of cells or tissue(s) containing cancer cells with antibody or Fc fusion and one or more other anti-cancer therapies, such as described above, can be employed to deplete or substantially deplete the cancer cells prior to transplantation in a recipient patient. It is of course contemplated that the antibodies and Fc fusions of the invention can be employed in combination with still other therapeutic techniques such as surgery.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an alternate embodiment, the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention are administered with a cytokine.

Carbon-14-labeled 1-isothiocyanatobenzyl-3-methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid (MX-DTPA) is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See \n \nPCT WO 94/11026\n \n. The linker may be a cleavable linker facilitating release of the cytotoxic drug in the cell. For example, an acid-labile linker, peptidase-sensitive linker, dimethyl linker or disulfide-containing linker (\nChari et al., 1992, Cancer Research 52: 127-131\n) may be used. Alternatively, the antibody or Fc fusion is operably linked to the therapeutic agent, e.g. by recombinant techniques or peptide synthesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChemotherapeutic agents that may be useful for conjugation to the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention have been described above. In an alternate embodiment, the antibody or Fc fusion is conjugated or operably linked to a toxin, including but not limited to small molecule toxins and enzymatically active toxins of bacterial, fungal, plant or animal origin, including fragments and/or variants thereof. Small molecule toxins include but are not limited to calicheamicin, maytansine (\n \nUS 5,208,020\n \n), trichothene, and CC1065. In one embodiment of the invention, the antibody or Fc fusion is conjugated to one or more maytansine molecules (e.g. about 1 to about 10 maytansine molecules per antibody molecule). Maytansine may, for example, be converted to May-SS-Me which may be reduced to May-SH3 and reacted with modified antibody or Fc fusion (\nChari et al., 1992, Cancer Research 52: 127-131\n) to generate a maytansinoid-antibody or maytansinoid-Fc fusion conjugate. Another conjugate of interest comprises an antibody or Fc fusion conjugated to one or more calicheamicin molecules. The callcheamicin family of antibiotics are capable of producing doublestranded DNA breaks at sub-picomolar concentrations. Structural analogues of calicheamicin that may be used include but are not limited to γ\n1\n \n1\n, □\n2\n \n1\n, □\n3\n, N-acetyl-γ\n1\n \n1\n, PSAG, and Θ\n1\n \n1\n, (\nHinman et al., 1993, Cancer Research 53:3336-3342\n; \nLode et al., 1998, Cancer Research 58:2925-2928\n) (\n \nUS 5,714,586\n \n; \n \nUS 5,712,374\n \n; \n \nUS 5,264,586\n \n; \n \nUS 5,773,001\n \n). \nDolastatin\n 10 analogs such as auristatin E (AE) and monomethylauristatin E (MMAE) may find use as conjugates for the Fc variants of the present invention (\nDoronina et al., 2003, Nat Biotechnol 21(7):778-84\n \n;\n \nFrancisco et al., 2003 Blood 102(4):1458-65\n).

In an alternate embodiment, the antibody or Fc fusion is conjugated or operably linked to an enzyme In order to employ Antibody Dependent Enzyme Mediated Prodrug Therapy (ADEPT). ADEPT may be used by conjugating or operably linking the antibody or Fc fusion to a prodrug-activating enzyme that converts a prodrug (e.g. a peptidyl chemotherapeutic agent, see \n \nPCT WO 81/01145\n \n) to an active anti-cancer drug. See, for example, \n \nPCT WO 88/07378\n \n and \n \nUS 4,975,278\n \n. The enzyme component of the lmmunoconjugate useful for ADEPT includes any enzyme capable of acting on a prodrug in such a way so as to covert it into its more active, cytotoxic form.

Alternatively, antibodies with enzymatic activity, also known in the art as \"abzymes\", can be used to convert the prodrugs of the Invention into free active drugs (see, for example, \nMassey, 1987, Nature 328: 457-458\n). Antibody-abzyme and Fc fusion-abzyme conjugates can be prepared for delivery of the abzyme to a tumor cell population. Other modifications of the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention are contemplated herein. For example, the antibody or Fc fusion may be linked to one of a variety of nonproteinaceous polymers, e.g., polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, polyoxyalkylenes, or copolymers of polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions are contemplated wherein an antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention and and one or more therapeutically active agents are formulated. Formulations of the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention are prepared for storage by mixing said antibody or Fc fusion having the desired degree of purity with optional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients or stabilizers (\nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed.,1980\n), in the form of lyophilized formulations or aqueous solutions. Acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, acetate, and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl orbenzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugars such as sucrose, mannitol, trehalose or sorbitol; sweeteners and other flavoring agents; fillers such as microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, corn and other starches; binding agents; additives; coloring agents; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g. Zn-protein complexes); and/or non-ionic surfactants such as TWEEN™, PLURONICS™ or polyethylene glycol (PEG). In a preferred embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition that comprises the antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention is in a water-soluble form, such as being present as pharmaceutically acceptable salts, which is meant to include both acid and base addition salts. \"Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt\" refers to those salts that retain the biological effectiveness of the free bases and that are not biologically or otherwise undesirable, formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid and the like, and organic acids such as acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid and the like. \"Pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts\" include those derived from inorganic bases such as sodium, potassium, lithium, ammonium, calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, copper, manganese, aluminum salts and the like.

The formulations to be used for \nin vivo\n administration are preferrably sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes or other methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies and Fc fusions disclosed herein may also be formulated as immunoliposomes. A liposome is a small vesicle comprising various types of lipids, phospholipids and/or surfactant that is useful for delivery of a therapeutic agent to a mammal. Liposomes containing the antibody or Fc fusion are prepared by methods known In the art, such as described in \nEpstein et al., 1985, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 82:3688\n; \nHwang et al., 1980, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 77:4030\n; \n \nUS 4,485,045\n \n; \n \nUS 4,544,545\n \n; and \n \nPCT WO 97/38731\n \n. Liposomes with enhanced circulation time are disclosed in \n \nUS 5,013,556\n \n. The components of the liposome are commonly arranged in a bilayer formation, similar to the lipid arrangement of biological membranes. Particularly useful liposomes can be generated by the reverse phase evaporation method with a lipid composition comprising phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol and PEG-derivatized phosphatidylethanolamine (PEG-PE). Liposomes are extruded through filters of defined pore size to yield liposomes with the desired diameter. A chemotherapeutic agent or other therapeutically active agent is optionally contained within the liposome (\nGabizon et al., 1989, J National Cancer Inst 81:1484\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies, Fc fusions, and other therapeutically active agents may also be entrapped in microcapsules prepared by methods including but not limited to coacervation techniques, interfacial polymerization (for example using hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsules, or poly-(methylmethacylate) microcapsules), colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules), and macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed., 1980\n. Sustained-release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymer, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g. films, or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides (\n \nUS 3,773,919\n \n), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma ethyl-L-glutamate, nondegradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT™ (which are injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), poly-D-(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid, and ProLease® (commercially available from Alkermes), which is a microsphere-based delivery system composed of the desired bioactive molecule incorporated into a matrix of poly-DL-lactide-co-glycolide (PLG).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe concentration of the therapeutically active antibody or Fc fusion of the present Invention in the formulation may vary from about 0.1 to 100 weight %. In a preferred embodiment, the concentration of the antibody or Fc fusion is in the range of 0.003 to 1.0 molar. In order to treat a patient, a therapeutically effective dose of the antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention may be administered. By \"therapeutically effective dose\" herein is meant a dose that produces the effects for which it is administered. The exact dose will depend on the purpose of the treatment, and will be ascertainable by one skilled in the art using known techniques. Dosages may range from 0.01 to 100 mg/kg of body weight or greater, for example 0.1, 1, 10, or 50 mg/kg of body weight, with 1 to 10mg/kg being preferred. As is known in the art, adjustments for antibody or Fc fusion degradation, systemic versus localized delivery, and rate of new protease synthesis, as well as the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, drug interaction and the severity of the condition may be necessary, and will be ascertainable with routine experimentation by those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdministration of the pharmaceutical composition comprising an antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention, preferably In the form of a sterile aqueous solution, may be done in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, orally, subcutaneously, intravenously, intranasally, intraotically, transdermally, topically (e.g., gels, salves, lotions, creams, etc.), intraperitoneally, intramuscularly, intrapulmonary (e.g., AERx® inhalable technology commercially available from Aradigm, or Inhance™ pulmonary delivery system commercially available from Inhale Therapeutics), vaginally, parenterally, rectally, or intraocularly. In some instances, for example for the treatment of wounds, inflammation, etc., the antibody or Fc fusion may be directly applied as a solution or spray. As is known in the art, the pharmaceutical composition may be formulated accordingly depending upon the manner of introduction.\n\n\n \nEngineering Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides engineering methods that may be used to generate Fc variants. A principal obstacle that has hindered previous attempts at Fc engineering is that only random attempts at modification have been possible, due in part to the inefficiency of engineering strategies and methods, and to the low-throughput nature of antibody production and screening. The present invention describes engineering methods that overcome these shortcomings. A variety of design strategies, computational screening methods, library generation methods, and experimental production and screening methods are contemplated. These strategies, approaches, techniques, and methods may be applied individually or in various combinations to engineer optimized Fc variants.\n\n\n \n\n\nDesign Strategies\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe most efficient approach to generating Fc variants that are optimized for a desired property is to direct the engineering efforts toward that goal. Accordingly, the present invention teaches design strategies that may be used to engineer optimized Fc variants. The use of a design strategy is meant to guide Fc engineering, but is not meant to constrain an Fc variant to a particular optimized property based on the design strategy that was used to engineer it. At first thought this may seem counterintuitive; however its validity is derived from the enormous complexity of subtle interactions that determine the structure, stability, solubility, and function of proteins and protein-protein complexes. Although efforts can be made to predict which protein positions, residues, interactions, etc. are important for a design goal, often times critical ones are not predictable. Effects on protein structure, stability, solubility, and function, whether favorable or unfavorable, are often unforeseen. Yet there are Innumerable amino acid modifications that are detrimental or deleterious to proteins. Thus often times the best approach to engineering comes from generation of protein variants that are focused generally towards a design goal but do not cause detrimental effects. In this way, a principal objective of a design strategy may be the generation of quality diversity. At a simplistic level this can be thought of as stacking the odds in one's favor. As an example, perturbation of the Fc carbohydrate or a particular domain-domain angle, as described below, are valid design strategies for generating optimized Fc variants, despite the fact that how carbohydrate and domain-domain angles determine the properties of Fc is not well understood. By reducing the number of detrimental amino acid modifications that are screened, i.e. by screening quality diversity, these design strategies become practical. Thus the true value of the design strategies taught in the present invention is their ability to direct engineering efforts towards the generation of valuable Fc variants. The specific value of any one resulting variant is determined after experimentation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne design strategy for engineering Fc variants is provided in which interaction of Fc with some Fc ligand is altered by engineering amino acid modifications at the interface between Fc and said Fc ligand. Fc ligands herein may include but are not limited to FcγRs, C1q, FcRn, protein A or G, and the like. By exploring energetically favorable substitutions at Fc positions that impact the binding interface, variants can be engineered that sample new interface conformations, some of which may improve binding to the Fc ligand, some of which may reduce Fc ligand binding, and some of which may have other favorable properties. Such new interface conformations could be the result of, for example, direct interaction with Fc ligand residues that form the interface, or indirect effects caused by the amino acid modifications such as perturbation of side chain or backbone conformations. Variable positions may be chosen as any positions that are believed to play an important role in determining the conformation of the interface. For example, variable positions may be chosen as the set of residues that are within a certain distance, for example 5 Angstroms (Å), preferrably between 1 and 10 Å, of any residue that makes direct contact with the Fc ligand.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn additional design strategy for generating Fc variants is provided in which the conformation of the Fc carbohydrate at N297 is optimized. Optimization as used in this context is meant to includes conformational and compositional changes in the N297 carbohydrate that result in a desired property, for example increased or reduced affinity for an FcγR. Such a strategy is supported by the observation that the carbohydrate structure and conformation dramatically affect Fc/FcγR and Fc/C1q binding (\nUmaña et al., 1999, Nat Biotechnol 17:176-180\n; \nDavies et al., 2001, Biotechnol Bioeng 74:288-294\n; \nMimura et al., 2001, J Biol Chem 276:45539-45547\n.; \nRadaev et al., 2001, J Biol Chem 276:16478-16483\n; \nShields et al., 2002, J Biol Chem 277:26733-26740\n; \nShinkawa et al., 2003, J Biol . Chem 278:3466-3473\n). However the carbohydrate makes no specific contacts with FcγRs. By exploring energetically favorable substitutions at positions that interact with carbohydrate, a quality diversity of variants can be engineered that sample new carbohydrate conformations, some of which may improve and some of which may reduce binding to one or more Fc ligands. While the majority of mutations near the Fc/carbohydrate Interface appear to alter carbohydrate conformation, some mutations have been shown to alter the glycosylation composition (\nLund et al., 1996, J Immunol 157:4963-4969\n; \nJefferis et al., 2002, Immunol Lett 82:57-65\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother design strategy for generating Fc variants is provided in which the angle between the Cγ2 and Cγ3 domains is optimized Optimization as used in this context is meant to describe conformational changes in the Cγ2-Cγ3 domain angle that result in a desired property, for example increased or reduced affinity for an FcγR. This angle is an important determinant of Fc/FcγR affinity (\nRadaev et al., 2001, J Biol Chem 276:16478-16483\n), and a number of mutations distal to the Fc/FcγR interface affect binding potentially by modulating it (\nShields et al., 2001, J Biol Chem 276:6591-6604\n). By exploring energetically favorable substitutions positions that appear to play a key role in determining the Cγ2-Cγ3 angle and the flexibility of the domains relative to one another, a quality diversity of variants can be designed that sample new angles and levels of flexibility, some of which may be optimized for a desired Fc property.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother design strategy for generating Fc variants is provided in which Fc is reengineered to eliminate the structural and functional dependence on glycosylation. This design strategy involves the optimization of Fc structure, stability, solubility, and/or Fc function (for example affinity of Fc for one or more Fc ligands) in the absence of the N297 carbohydrate. In one approach, positions that are exposed to solvent in the absence of glycosylation are engineered such that they are stable, structurally consistent with Fc structure, and have no tendency to aggregate. The Cγ2 is the only unpaired Ig domain in the antibody (see \nFigure 1\n). Thus the N297 carbohydrate covers up the exposed hydrophobic patch that would normally be the interface for a protein-protein interaction with another Ig domain, maintaining the stability and structural integrity of Fc and keeping the Cγ2 domains from aggregating across the central axis. Approaches for optimizing aglycosylated Fc may involve but are not limited to designing amino acid modifications that enhance aglycoslated Fc stability and/or solubility by incorporating polar and/or charged residues that face inward towards the Cγ2-Cγ2 dimer axis, and by designing amino acid modifications that directly enhance the aglycosylated Fc/FcγR interface or the interface of aglycosylated Fc with some other Fc ligand.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn additional design strategy for engineering Fc variants is provided in which the conformation of the Cγ2 domain is optimized Optimization as used in this context is meant to describe conformational changes in the Cγ2 domain angle that result in a desired property, for example increased or reduced affinity for an FcγR. By exploring energetically favorable substitutions at Cγ2 positions that impact the Cγ2 conformation, a quality diversity of variants can be engineered that sample new Cγ2 conformations, some of which may achieve the design goal. Such new Cγ2 conformations could be the result of, for example, alternate backbone conformations that are sampled by the variant. Variable positions may be chosen as any positions that are believed to play an important role in determining C□2 structure, stability, solubility, flexibility, function, and the like. For example, Cγ2 hydrophobic core residues, that is Cγ2 residues that are partially or fully sequestered from solvent, may be reengineered. Alternatively, noncore residues may be considered, or residues that are deemed important for determining backbone structure, stability, or flexibility.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn additional design strategy for Fc optimization is provided in which binding to an FcγR, complement, or some other Fc ligand is altered by modifications that modulate the electrostatic interaction between Fc and said Fc ligand. Such modifications may be thought of as optimization of the global electrostatic character of Fc, and include replacement of neutral amino acids with a charged amino acid, replacement of a charged amino acid with a neutral amino acid, or replacement of a charged amino acid with an amino acid of opposite charge (i.e. charge reversal). Such modifications may be used to effect changes in binding affinity between an Fc and one or more Fc ligands, for example FcγRs. In a preferred embodiment, positions at which electrostatic substitutions might affect binding are selected using one of a variety of well known methods for calculation of electrostatic potentials. In the simplest embodiment, Coulomb's law is used to generate electrostatic potentials as a function of the position in the protein. Additional embodiments include the use of Debye-Huckel scaling to account for ionic strength effects, and more sophisticated embodiments such as Poisson-Boltzmann calculations. Such electrostatic calculations may highlight positions and suggest specific amino acid modifications to achieve the design goal. In some cases, these substitutions may be anticipated to variably affect binding to different Fc ligands, for example to enhance binding to activating FcγRs while decreasing binding affinity to inhibitory FcγRs.\n\n\n \n\n\nComputational Screening\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA principal obstacle to obtaining valuable Fc variants is the difficulty in predicting what amino acid modifications, out of the enormous number of possibilities, will achieve the desired goals. Indeed one of the principle reasons that previous attempts at Fc engineering have failed to produce Fc variants of significant clinical value is that approaches to Fc engineering have thus far involved hit-or-miss approaches. The present invention provides computational screening methods that enable quantitative and systematic engineering of Fc variants. These methods typically use atomic level scoring functions, side chain rotamer sampling, and advanced optimization methods to accurately capture the relationships between protein sequence, structure, and function. Computational screening enables exploration of the entire sequence space of possibilities at target positions by filtering the enormous diversity which results. Variant libraries that are screened computationally are effectively enriched for stable, properly folded, and functional sequences, allowing active optimization of Fc for a desired goal. Because of the overlapping sequence constraints on protein structure, stability, solubility, and function, a large number of the candidates in a library occupy \"wasted\" sequence space. For example, a large fraction of sequence space encodes unfolded, misfolded, incompletely folded, partially folded, or aggregated proteins. This is particularly relevant for Fc engineering because Ig domains are small beta sheet structures, the engineering of which has proven extremely demanding (\nQuinn et al., 1994, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 91:8747-8751\n; \nRichardson et al., 2002, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 99:2754-2759\n). Even seemingly harmless substitutions on the surface of a beta sheet can cause severe packing conflicts, dramatically disrupting folding equilibrium (\nSmith et al., 1995, Science 270:980-982\n); incidentally, alanine is one of the worst beta sheet formers (\nMinor et al., 1994, Nature 371:264-267\n). The determinants of beta sheet stability and specificity are a delicate balance between an extremely large number of subtle interactions. Computational screening enables the generation of libraries that are composed primarily of productive sequence space, and as a result increases the chances of identifying proteins that are optimized for the design goal. In effect, computational screening yields an increased hit-rate, thereby decreasing the number of variants that must be screened experimentally. An additional obstacle to Fc engineering is the need for active design of correlated or coupled mutations. For example, the greatest Fc/FcγR affinity enhancement observed thus far is S298A/E333A/K334A, obtained by combining three better binders obtained separately in an alanine scan (\nShields et al., 2001, J Biol Chem 276:6591-6604\n). Computational screening is capable of generating such a three-fold variant in one experiment instead of three separate ones, and furthermore is able to test the functionality of all 20 amino acids at those positions instead of just alanine. Computational screening deals with such complexity by reducing the combinatorial problem to an experimentally tractable size.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nComputational screening, viewed broadly, has four steps: 1) selection and preparation of the protein template structure or structures, 2) selection of variable positions, amino acids to be considered at those positions, and/or selection of rotamers to model considered amino acids, 3) energy calculation, and 4) combinatorial optimization. In more detail, the process of computational screening can be described as follows. A three-dimensional structure of a protein is used as the starting point. The positions to be optimized are identified, which may be the entire protein sequence or subset(s) thereof. Amino acids that will be considered at each position are selected. In a preferred embodiment, each considered amino acid may be represented by a discrete set of allowed conformations, called rotamers. Interaction energies are calculated between each considered amino acid and each other considered amino acid, and the rest of the protein, including the protein backbone and invariable residues. In a preferred embodiment, interaction energies are calculated between each considered amino acid side chain rotamer and each other considered amino acid side chain rotamer and the rest of the protein, including the protein backbone and invariable residues. One or more combinatorial search algorithms are then used to identify the lowest energy sequence and/or low energy sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment, the computational screening method used is substantially similar to Protein Design Automation® (PDA®) technology, as is described in \n \nUS 6,188,965\n \n; \n \nUS 6,269,312\n \n; \n \nUS 6,403,312\n \n; \n \nUSSN 09/782,004\n \n; \n \nUSSN 09/927,790\n \n; \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/218,102\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 98/07254\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 01/40091\n \n; and \n \nPCT WO02/25588\n \n. In another preferred embodiment, a computational screening method substantially similar to Sequence Prediction Algorithm™ (SPA™) technology is used, as is described in (\nRaha et al., 2000, Protein Sci 9:1106-1119\n), \n \nUSSN 09/877,695\n \n, and \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/071,859\n \n. In another preferred embodiment, the computational screening methods described in \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/339788, filed on March 3,2003\n \n, entitled \"ANTIBODY OPTIMIZATION\", are used. In some embodiments, combinations of different computational screening methods are used, including combinations of PDA® technology and SPA™ technology, as well as combinations of these computational methods in combination with other design tools. Similarly, these computational methods can be used simultaneously or sequentially, in any order.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA template structure is used as input into the computational screening calculations. By \"\ntemplate structure\"\n herein is meant the structural coordinates of part or all of a protein to be optimized. The template structure may be any protein for which a three dimensional structure (that is, three dimensional coordinates for a set of the protein's atoms) is known or may be calculated, estimated, modeled, generated, or determined. The three dimensional structures of proteins may be determined using methods including but not limited to X-ray crystallographic techniques, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques, \nde novo\n modeling, and homology modeling. If optimization is desired for a protein for which the structure has not been solved experimentally, a suitable structural model may be generated that may serve as the template for computational screening calculations. Methods for generating homology models of proteins are known in the art, and these methods find use in the present invention. See for example, \nLuo, et al. 2002, Protein Sci 11: 1218-1226\n, \nLehmann & Wyss, 2001, Curr Opin Biotechno/ 12(4):371-5\n \n.;\n \nLehmann et al., 2000, Biochim Biophys Acta 1543(2):408-415\n; \nRath & Davidson, 2000, Protein Sci, 9(12):2457-69\n; \nLehmann et al., 2000, Protein Eng 13(1):49-57\n; \nDesjarlais & Berg, 1993, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 90(6):2256-60\n; \nDesjarlais & Berg, 1992, Proteins 12(2):101-4\n; \nHenikoff & Henikoff, 2000, Adv Protein Chem 54:73-97\n; \nHenikoff & Henikoff, 1994, J Mol Biol 243(4):574-8\n; \nMorea et al., 2000, Methods 20:267-269\n. Protein/protein complexes may also be obtained using docking methods. Suitable protein structures that may serve as template structures include, but are not limited to, all of those found in the Protein Data Base compiled and serviced by the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB, formerly the Brookhaven National Lab).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe template structure may be of a protein that occurs naturally or is engineered. The template structure may be of a protein that is substantially encoded by a protein from any organism, with human, mouse, rat, rabbit, and monkey preferred. The template structure may comprise any of a number of protein structural forms. In a preferred embodiment the template structure comprises an Fc region or a domain or fragment of Fc. In an alternately preferred embodiment the template structure comprises Fc or a domain or fragment of Fc bound to one or more Fc ligands, with an Fc/FcγR complex being preferred. The Fc in the template structure may be glycosylated or unglycosylated. The template structure may comprise more than one protein chain. The template structure may additionally contain nonprotein components, including but not limited to small molecules, substrates, cofactors, metals, water molecules, prosthetic groups, polymers and carbohydrates. In a preferred embodiment, the template structure is a plurality or set of template proteins, for example an ensemble of structures such as those obtained from NMR. Alternatively, the set of template structures is generated from a set of related proteins or structures, or artificially created ensembles. The composition and source of the template structure depends on the engineering goal. For example, for enhancement of human Fc/FcγR affinity, a human Fc/FcγR complex structure or derivative thereof may be used as the template structure. Alternatively, the uncomplexed Fc structure may be used as the template structure. If the goal is to enhance affinity of a human Fc for a mouse FcγR, the template structure may be a structure or model of a human Fc bound to a mouse FcγR.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe template structure may be modified or altered prior to design calculations. A variety of methods for template structure preparation are described in \n \nUS 6,188,965\n \n; \n \nUS 6,269,312\n \n; \n \nUS 6,403,312\n \n; \n \nUSSN 09/782,004\n \n; \n \nUSSN 09/927,790\n \n; \n \nUSSN 09/877,695\n \n; \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/071,859\n \n, \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/218,102\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 98/07254\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 01/40091\n \n; and \n \nPCT WO 02/25588\n \n. For example, in a preferred embodiment, explicit hydrogens may be added if not included within the structure. In an alternate embodiment, energy minimization of the structure is run to relax strain, including strain due to van der Waals clashes, unfavorable bond angles, and unfavorable bond lengths. Alternatively, the template structure is altered using other methods, such as manually, including directed or random perturbations. It is also possible to modify the template structure during later steps of computational screening, including during the energy calculation and combinatorial optimization steps. In an alternate embodiment, the template structure is not modified before or during computational screening calculations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOnce a template structure has been obtained, variable positions are chosen. By \"\nvariable position\"\n herein is meant a position at which the amino acid identity is allowed to be altered in a computational screening calculation. As is known in the art, allowing amino acid modifications to be considered only at certain variable positions reduces the complexity of a calculation and enables computational screening to be more directly tailored for the design goal. One or more residues may be variable positions in computational screening calculations. Positions that are chosen as variable positions may be those that contribute to or are hypothesized to contribute to the protein property to be optimized, for example Fc affinity for an FcγR, Fc stability, Fc solubility, and so forth. Residues at variable positions may contribute favorably or unfavorably to a specific protein property. For example, a residue at an Fc/FcγR interface may be involved in mediating binding, and thus this position may be varied in design calculations aimed at improving Fc/FcγR affinity. As another example, a residue that has an exposed hydrophobic side chain may be responsible for causing unfavorable aggregation, and thus this position may be varied in design calculations aimed at improving solubility. Variable positions may be those positions that are directly involved in interactions that are determinants of a particular protein property. For example, the Fc□R binding site of Fc may be defined to include all residues that contact that particular FγcR. By \"\ncontact\n\" herein is meant some chemical interaction between at least one atom of an Fc residue with at least one atom of the bound FcγR, with chemical interaction including, but not limited to van der Waals interactions, hydrogen bond interactions, electrostatic interactions, and hydrophobic interactions. In an alternative embodiment, variable positions may include those positions that are indirectly involved in a protein property, i.e. such positions may be proximal to residues that are known to or hypothesized to contribute to an Fc property. For example, the FcγR binding site of an Fc may be defined to include all Fc residues within a certain distance, for example 4 - 10 Å, of any Fc residue that is in van der Waals contact with the FcγR. Thus variable positions in this case may be chosen not only as residues that directly contact the FcγR, but also those that contact residues that contact the FcγR and thus influence binding indirectly. The specific positions chosen are dependent on the design strategy being employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne or more positions in the template structure that are not variable may be floated. By \"\nfloated position\n\" herein is meant a position at which the amino acid conformation but not the amino acid identity is allowed to vary in a computational screening calculation. In one embodiment, the floated position may have the parent amino acid identity. For example, floated positions may be positions that are within a small distance, for example 5 Å, of a variable position residue. In an alternate embodiment, a floated position may have a non-parent amino acid identity. Such an embodiment may find use in the present invention, for example, when the goal is to evaluate the energetic or structural outcome of a specific mutation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPositions that are not variable or floated are fixed. By \"\nfixed position\n\" herein is meant a position at which the amino acid identity and the conformation are held constant in a computational screening calculation. Positions that may be fixed include residues that are not known to be or hypothesized to be involved in the property to be optimized. In this case the assumption is that there is little or nothing to be gained by varying these positions. Positions that are fixed may also include positions whose residues are known or hypothesized to be important for maintaining proper folding, structure, stability, solubility, and/or biological function. For example, positions may be fixed for residues that interact with a particular Fc ligand or residues that encode a glycosylation site in order to ensure that binding to the Fc ligand and proper glycosylation respectively are not perturbed. Likewise, if stability is being optimized, it may be beneficial to fix positions that directly or indirectly interact with an Fc ligand, for example an Fc□R, so that binding is not perturbed. Fixed positions may also include structurally important residues such as cysteines participating in disulfide bridges, residues critical for determining backbone conformation such as proline or glycine, critical hydrogen bonding residues, and residues that form favorable packing interactions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe next step in computational screening is to select a set of possible amino acid identities that will be considered at each particular variable position. This set of possible amino acids is herein referred to as \"\nconsidered amino acids\n\" at a variable position. \"\nAmino acids\n\" as used herein refers to the set of natural 20 amino acids and any nonnatural or synthetic analogues. In one embodiment, all 20 natural amino acids are considered. Alternatively, a subset of amino acids, or even only one amino acid is considered at a given variable position. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, there is a computational benefit to considering only certain amino acid identities at variable positions, as it decreases the combinatorial complexity of the search. Furthermore, considering only certain amino acids at variable positions may be used to tailor calculations toward specific design strategies. For example, for solubility optimization of aglycosylated Fc, it may be beneficial to allow only polar amino acids to be considered at nonpolar Fc residues that are exposed to solvent in the absence of carbohydrate. Nonnatural amino acids, including synthetic amino acids and analogues of natural amino acids, may also be considered amino acids. For example see \nChin et al., 2003, Science, 301(5635):964-7\n; and \nChin et al., 2003, Chem Biol.10(6):511-9\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA wide variety of methods may be used, alone or in combination, to select which amino acids will be considered at each position. For example, the set of considered amino acids at a given variable position may be chosen based on the degree of exposure to solvent. Hydrophobic or nonpolar amino acids typically reside in the interior or core of a protein, which are inaccessible or nearly inaccessible to solvent. Thus at variable core positions it may be beneficial to consider only or mostly nonpolar amino acids such as alanine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, and methionine. Hydrophilic or polar amino acids typically reside on the exterior or surface of proteins, which have a significant degree of solvent accessibility. Thus at variable surface positions it may be beneficial to consider only or mostly polar amino acids such as alanine, serine, threonine, aspartic acid, asparagine, glutamine, glutamic acid, arginine, lysine and histidine. Some positions are partly exposed and partly buried, and are not clearly protein core or surface positions, in a sense serving as boundary residues between core and surface residues. Thus at such variable boundary positions it may be beneficial to consider both nonpolar and polar amino acids such as alanine, serine, threonine, aspartic acid, asparagine, glutamine, glutamic acid, arginine, lysine histidine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, and methionine. Determination of the degree of solvent exposure at variable positions may be by subjective evaluation or visual inspection of the template structure by one skilled in the art of protein structural biology, or by using a variety of algorithms that are known in the art. Selection of amino acid types to be considered at variable positions may be aided or determined wholly by computational methods, such as calculation of solvent accessible surface area, or using algorithms that assess the orientation of the C□-C□ vectors relative to a solvent accessible surface, as outlined in \n \nUS 6,188,965\n \n; \n \n6,269,312\n \n; \n \nUS 6,403,312\n \n; \n \nUSSN 09/782,004\n \n; \n \nUSSN 09/927,790\n \n; \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/218,102\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 98/07254\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 01/40091\n \n; and \n \nPCT WO 02/25588\n \n. In one embodiment, each variable position may be classified explicitly as a core, surface, or boundary position or a classification substantially similar to core, surface, or boundary.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an alternate embodiment, selection of the set of amino acids allowed at variable positions may be hypothesis-driven. Hypotheses for which amino acid types should be considered at variable positions may be derived by a subjective evaluation or visual inspection of the template structure by one skilled in the art of protein structural biology. For example, if it is suspected that a hydrogen bonding interaction may be favorable at a variable position, polar residues that have the capacity to form hydrogen bonds may be considered, even if the position is in the core. Likewise, if it is suspected that a hydrophobic packing interaction may be favorable at a variable position, nonpolar residues that have the capacity to form favorable packing interactions may be considered, even if the position is on the surface. Other examples of hypothesis-driven approaches may involve issues of backbone flexibility or protein fold. As is known in the art, certain residues, for example proline, glycine, and cysteine, play important roles in protein structure and stability. Glycine enables greater backbone flexibility than all other amino acids, proline constrains the backbone more than all other amino acids, and cysteines may form disulfide bonds. It may therefore be beneficial to include one or more of these amino acid types to achieve a desired design goal. Alternatively, it may be beneficial to exclude one or more of these amino acid types from the list of considered amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an alternate embodiment, subsets of amino acids may be chosen to maximize coverage. In this case, additional amino acids with properties similar to that in the template structure may be considered at variable positions. For example, if the residue at a variable position in the template structure is a large hydrophobic residue, additional large hydrophobic amino acids may be considered at that position. Alternatively, subsets of amino acids may be chosen to maximize diversity. In this case, amino acids with properties dissimilar to those in the template structure may be considered at variable positions. For example, if the residue at a variable position in the template is a large hydrophobic residue, amino acids that are small, polar, etc. may be considered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs is known in the art, some computational screening methods require only the identity of considered amino acids to be determined during design calculations. That is, no information is required concerning the conformations or possible conformations of the amino acid side chains. Other preferred methods utilize a set of discrete side chain conformations, called rotamers, which are considered for each amino acid. Thus, a set of rotamers may be considered at each variable and floated position. Rotamers may be obtained from published rotamer libraries (see for example, \nLovel et al., 2000, Proteins: Structure Function and Genetics 40:389-408\n; \nDunbrack & Cohen, 1997, Protein Science 6:1661-1681\n; \nDeMaeyer et al., 1997, Folding and Design 2:53-66\n; \nTuffery et al., 1991, J Biomol Struct Dyn 8:1267-1289\n, \nPonder & Richards, 1987, J Mol Biol 193:775-791\n). As is known in the art, rotamer libraries may be backbone-independent or backbone-dependent. Rotamers may also be obtained from molecular mechanics or \nab initio\n calculations, and using other methods. In a preferred embodiment, a flexible rotamer model is used (see \nMendes et al., 1999, Proteins: Structure, Function, and Genetics 37:530-543\n). Similarly, artificially generated rotamers may be used, or augment the set chosen for each amino acid and/or variable position. In one embodiment, at least one conformation that is not low in energy is included in the list of rotamers. In an alternate embodiment, the rotamer of the variable position residue in the template structure is included in the list of rotamers allowed for that variable position. In an alternate embodiment, only the identity of each amino acid considered at variable positions is provided, and no specific conformational states of each amino acid are used during design calculations. That is, use of rotamers is not essential for computational screening.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExperimental information may be used to guide the choice of variable positions and/or the choice of considered amino acids at variable positions. As is known in the art, mutagenesis experiments are often carried out to determine the role of certain residues in protein structure and function, for example, which protein residues play a role in determining stability, or which residues make up the interface of a protein-protein interaction. Data obtained from such experiments are useful in the present invention. For example, variable positions for Fc/FcγR affinity enhancement could involve varying all positions at which mutation has been shown to affect binding. Similarly, the results from such an experiment may be used to guide the choice of allowed amino acid types at variable positions. For example, if certain types of amino acid substitutions are found to be favorable, similar types of those amino acids may be considered. In one embodiment, additional amino acids with properties similar to those that were found to be favorable experimentally may be considered at variable positions. For example, if experimental mutation of a variable position at an Fc/FcγR interface to a large hydrophobic residue was found to be favorable, the user may choose to include additional large hydrophobic amino acids at that position in the computational screen. As is known in the art, display and other selection technologies may be coupled with random mutagenesis to generate a list or lists of amino acid substitutions that are favorable for the selected property. Such a list or lists obtained from such experimental work find use in the present invention. For example, positions that are found to be invariable in such an experiment may be excluded as variable positions in computational screening calculations, whereas positions that are found to be more acceptable to mutation or respond favorably to mutation may be chosen as variable positions. Similarly, the results from such experiments may be used to guide the choice of allowed amino acid types at variable positions. For example, if certain types of amino acids arise more frequently in an experimental selection, similar types of those amino acids may be considered. In one embodiment, additional amino acids with properties similar to those that were found to be favorable experimentally may be considered at variable positions. For example, if selected mutations at a variable position that resides at an Fc/FcγR interface are found to be uncharged polar amino acids, the user may choose to include additional uncharged polar amino acids, or perhaps charged polar amino acids, at that position.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSequence information may also be used to guide choice of variable positions and/or the choice of amino acids considered at variable positions. As is known in the art, some proteins share a common structural scaffold and are homologous in sequence. This information may be used to gain insight into particular positions in the protein family. As is known in the art, sequence alignments are often carried out to determine which protein residues are conserved and which are not conserved. That is to say, by comparing and contrasting alignments of protein sequences, the degree of variability at a position may be observed, and the types of amino acids that occur naturally at positions may be observed. Data obtained from such analyses are useful in the present invention. The benefit of using sequence information to choose variable positions and considered amino acids at variable positions are several fold. For choice of variable positions, the primary advantage of using sequence information is that insight may be gained into which positions are more tolerant and which are less tolerant to mutation. Thus sequence information may aid in ensuring that quality diversity, i.e. mutations that are not deleterious to protein structure, stability, etc., is sampled computationally. The same advantage applies to use of sequence information to select amino acid types considered at variable positions. That is, the set of amino acids that occur in a protein sequence alignment may be thought of as being pre-screened by evolution to have a higher chance than random for being compatible with a protein's structure, stability, solubility, function, etc. Thus higher quality diversity is sampled computationally. A second benefit of using sequence information to select amino acid types considered at variable positions is that certain alignments may represent sequences that may be less immunogenic than random sequences. For example, if the amino acids considered at a given variable position are the set of amino acids which occur at that position in an alignment of human protein sequences, those amino acids may be thought of as being pre-screened by nature for generating no or low immune response if the optimized protein is used as a human therapeutic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe source of the sequences may vary widely, and include one or more of the known databases, including but not limited to the Kabat database (\nJohnson & Wu, 2001, Nucleic Acids Res 29:205-206\n; \nJohnson & Wu, 2000, Nucleic Acids Res 28:214-218\n), the IMGT database (IMGT, the international ImMunoGeneTics information system®; \nLefranc et al., 1999, Nucleic Acids Res 27:209-212\n; \nRuiz et al., 2000 Nucleic Acids Re. 28:219-221\n; \nLefranc et al., 2001, Nucleic Acids Res 29:207-209\n; \nLefranc et al., 2003, Nucleic Acids Res 31:307-310\n), and VBASE, SwissProt, GenBank and Entrez, and EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database. Protein sequence information can be obtained, compiled, and/or generated from sequence alignments of naturally occurring proteins from any organism, including but not limited to mammals. Protein sequence information can be obtained from a database that is compiled privately. There are numerous sequence-based alignment programs and methods known in the art, and all of these find use in the present invention for generation of sequence alignments of proteins that comprise Fc and Fc ligands.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOnce alignments are made, sequence information can be used to guide choice of variable positions. Such sequence information can relate the variability, natural or otherwise, of a given position. Variability herein should be distinguished from variable position. Variability refers to the degree to which a given position in a sequence alignment shows variation in the types of amino acids that occur there. Variable position, to reiterate, is a position chosen by the user to vary in amino acid identity during a computational screening calculation. Variability may be determined qualitatively by one skilled in the art of bioinformatics. There are also methods known in the art to quantitatively determine variability that may find use in the present invention. The most preferred embodiment measures Information Entropy or Shannon Entropy. Variable positions can be chosen based on sequence information obtained from closely related protein sequences, or sequences that are less closely related.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe use of sequence information to choose variable positions finds broad use in the present invention. For example, if an Fc/FcγR interface position in the template structure is tryptophan, and tryptophan is observed at that position in greater than 90% of the sequences in an alignment, it may be beneficial to leave that position fixed. In contrast, if another interface position is found to have a greater level of variability, for example if five different amino acids are observed at that position with frequencies of approximately 20% each, that position may be chosen as a variable position. In another embodiment, visual inspection of aligned protein sequences may substitute for or aid visual inspection of a protein structure. Sequence information can also be used to guide the choice of amino acids considered at variable positions. Such sequence information can relate to how frequently an amino acid, amino acids, or amino acid types (for example polar or nonpolar, charged or uncharged) occur, naturally or otherwise, at a given position. In one embodiment, the set of amino acids considered at a variable position may comprise the set of amino acids that is observed at that position in the alignment. Thus, the position-specific alignment information is used directly to generate the list of considered amino acids at a variable position in a computational screening calculation. Such a strategy is well known in the art; see for example \nLehmann & Wyss, 2001, Curr Opin Biotechnol 12(4):371-5\n; \nLehmann et al., 2000, Biochim Biophys Acta 1543(2):408-415\n; \nRath & Davidson, 2000, Protein Sci, 9(12):2457-69\n; \nLehmann et al., 2000, Protein Eng 13(1):49-57\n; \nDesjarlais & Berg, 1993, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 90(6):2256-60\n; \nDesjarlais & Berg, 1992, Proteins 12(2):101-4\n; \nHenikoff & Henikoff, 2000, Adv Protein Chem 54:73-97\n; \nHenikoff & Henikoff, 1994, J Mol Biol 243(4):574-8\n. In an alternate embodiment, the set of amino acids considered at a variable position or positions may comprise a set of amino acids that is observed most frequently in the alignment. Thus, a certain criteria is applied to determine whether the frequency of an amino acid or amino acid type warrants its inclusion in the set of amino acids that are considered at a variable position. As is known in the art, sequence alignments may be analyzed using statistical methods to calculate the sequence diversity at any position in the alignment and the occurrence frequency or probability of each amino acid at a position. Such data may then be used to determine which amino acids types to consider. In the simplest embodiment, these occurrence frequencies are calculated by counting the number of times an amino acid is observed at an alignment position, then dividing by the total number of sequences in the alignment. In other embodiments, the contribution of each sequence, position or amino acid to the counting procedure is weighted by a variety of possible mechanisms. In a preferred embodiment, the contribution of each aligned sequence to the frequency statistics is weighted according to its diversity weighting relative to other sequences in the alignment. A common strategy for accomplishing this is the sequence weighting system recommended by Henikoff and Henikoff (\nHenikoff & Henikoff, 2000, Adv Protein Chem 54:73-97\n; \nHenikoff & Henikoff, 1994, J Mol Biol 243:574-8\n \n.\n In a preferred embodiment, the contribution of each sequence to the statistics is dependent on its extent of similarity to the target sequence, i.e. the template structure used, such that sequences with higher similarity to the target sequence are weighted more highly. Examples of similarity measures include, but are not limited to, sequence identity, BLOSUM similarity score, PAM matrix similarity score, and BLAST score. In an alternate embodiment, the contribution of each sequence to the statistics is dependent on its known physical or functional properties. These properties include, but are not limited to, thermal and chemical stability, contribution to activity, and solubility. For example, when optimizing aglycosylated Fc for solubility, those sequences in an alignment that are known to be most soluble (for example see \nEwert et al., 2003, J Mol Bio/325:531-553\n)\n,\n will contribute more heavily to the calculated frequencies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRegardless of what criteria are applied for choosing the set of amino acids in a sequence alignment to be considered at variable positions, use of sequence information to choose considered amino acids finds broad use in the present invention. For example, to optimize Fc solubility by replacing exposed nonpolar surface residues, considered amino acids may be chosen as the set of amino acids, or a subset of those amino acids which meet some criteria, that are observed at that position in an alignment of protein sequences. As another example, one or more amino acids may be added or subtracted subjectively from a list of amino acids derived from a sequence alignment in order to maximize coverage. For example, additional amino acids with properties similar to those that are found in a sequence alignment may be considered at variable positions. For example, if an Fc position that is known to or hypothesized to bind an FcγR is observed to have uncharged polar amino acids in a sequence alignment, the user may choose to include additional uncharged polar amino acids in a computational screening calculation, or perhaps charged polar amino acids, at that position.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nin one embodiment, sequence alignment information is combined with energy calculation, as discussed below. For example, pseudo energies can be derived from sequence information to generate a scoring function. The use of a sequence-based scoring function may assist in significantly reducing the complexity of a calculation. However, as is appreciated by those skilled in the art, the use of a sequence-based scoring function alone may be inadequate because sequence information can often indicate misleading correlations between mutations that may in reality be structurally conflicting. Thus, in a preferred embodiment, a structure-based method of energy calculation is used, either alone or in combination with a sequence-based scoring function. That is, preferred embodiments do not rely on sequence alignment information alone as the analysis step.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnergy calculation refers to the process by which amino acid modifications are scored. The energies of interaction are measured by one or more scoring functions. A variety of scoring functions find use in the present invention for calculating energies. Scoring functions may include any number of potentials, herein referred to as the energy terms of a scoring function, including but not limited to a van der Waals potential, a hydrogen bond potential, an atomic solvation potential or other solvation models, a secondary structure propensity potential, an electrostatic potential, a torsional potential, and an entropy potential. At least one energy term is used to score each variable or floated position, although the energy terms may differ depending on the position, considered amino acids, and other considerations. In one embodiment, a scoring function using one energy term is used. In the most preferred embodiment, energies are calculated using a scoring function that contains more than one energy term, for example describing van der Waals, solvation, electrostatic, and hydrogen bond interactions, and combinations thereof. In additional embodiments, additional energy terms include but are not limited to entropic terms, torsional energies, and knowledge-based energies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of scoring functions are described in \n \nUS 6,188,965\n \n; \n \nUS 6,269,312\n \n; \n \nUS 6,403,312\n \n; \n \nUSSN 09/782,004\n \n; \n \nUSSN 09/927,790\n \n; \n \nUSSN 09/877,695\n \n; \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/071,859\n \n, \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/218,102\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 98/07254\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 01/40091\n \n; and \n \nPCT WO 02/25588\n \n. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, scoring functions need not be limited to physico-chemical energy terms. For example, knowledge-based potentials may find use in the computational screening methodology of the present invention. Such knowledge-based potentials may be derived from protein sequence and/or structure statistics including but not limited to threading potentials, reference energies, pseudo energies, homology-based energies, and sequence biases derived from sequence alignments. In a preferred embodiment, a scoring function is modified to include models for immunogenicity, such as functions derived from data on binding of peptides to MHC (Major Htocompatability Complex), that may be used to identify potentially immunogenic sequences (see for example \n \nUSSN 09/903,378\n \n; \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/039,170\n \n; \n \n \nUSSN\n 60/222,697\n \n; \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/339788\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 01/21823\n \n; and \n \nPCTWO 02/00165\n \n). In one embodiment, sequence alignment information can be used to score amino acid substitutions. For example, comparison of protein sequences, regardless of whether the source of said proteins is human, monkey, mouse, or otherwise, may be used to suggest or score amino acid mutations in the computational screening methodology of the present invention. In one embodiment, as is known in the art, one or more scoring functions may be optimized or \"trained\" during the computational analysis, and then the analysis re-run using the optimized system. Such altered scoring functions may be obtained for example, by training a scoring function using experimental data. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, a number of force fields, which are comprised of one or more energy terms, may serve as scoring functions. Force fields include but are not limited to \nab initio\n or quantum mechanical force fields, semi-empirical force fields, and molecular mechanics force fields. Scoring functions that are knowledge-based or that use statistical methods may find use in, the present invention. These methods may be used to assess the match between a sequence and a three-dimensional protein structure, and hence may be used to score amino acid substitutions for fidelity to the protein structure. In one embodiment, molecular dynamics calculations may be used to computationally screen sequences by individually calculating mutant sequence scores.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are a variety of ways to represent amino acids in order to enable efficient energy calculation. In a preferred embodiment, considered amino acids are represented as rotamers, as described previously, and the energy (or score) of interaction of each possible rotamer at each variable and floated position with the other variable and floated rotamers, with fixed position residues, and with the backbone structure and any non-protein atoms, is calculated. In a preferred embodiment, two sets of interaction energies are calculated for each side chain rotamer at every variable and floated position: the interaction energy between the rotamer and the fixed atoms (the \"singles\" energy), and the interaction energy between the variable and floated positions rotamer and all other possible rotamers at every other variable and floated position (the \"doubles\" energy). In an alternate embodiment, singles and doubles energies are calculated for fixed positions as well as for variable and floated positions. In an alternate embodiment, considered amino acids are not represented as rotamers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn important component of computational screening is the identification of one or more sequences that have a favorable score, i.e. are low in energy. Determining a set of low energy sequences from an extremely large number of possibilities is nontrivial, and to solve this problem a combinatorial optimization algorithm is employed. The need for a combinatorial optimization algorithm is illustrated by examining the number of possibilities that are considered in a typical computational screening calculation. The discrete nature of rotamer sets allows a simple calculation of the number of possible rotameric sequences for a given design problem. A backbone of length n with m possible rotamers per position will have m\" possible rotamer sequences, a number that grows exponentially with sequence length. For very simple calculations, it is possible to examine each possible sequence in order to identify the optimal sequence and/or one or more favorable sequences. However, for a typical design problem, the number of possible sequences (up to 10\n80\n or more) is sufficiently large that examination of each possible sequence is intractable. A variety of combinatorial optimization algorithms may then be used to identify the optimum sequence and/or one or more favorable sequences. Combinatorial optimization algorithms may be divided into two classes: (1) those that are guaranteed to return the global minimum energy configuration if they converge, and (2) those that are not guaranteed to return the global minimum energy configuration, but which will always return a solution. Examples of the first class of algorithms include but are not limited to Dead-End Elimination (DEE) and Branch & Bound (B&B) (including Branch and Terminate) (\nGordon & Mayo, 1999, Structure Fold Des 7:1089-98\n). Examples of the second class of algorithms include, but are not limited to, Monte Carlo (MC), self-consistent mean field (SCMF), Boltzmann sampling (\nMetropolis et al., 1953, J Chem Phys 21:1087\n), simulated annealing (\nKirkpatrick et al., 1983, Science, 220:671-680\n), genetic algorithm (GA), and Fast and Accurate Side-Chain Topology and Energy Refinement (FASTER) (\nDesmet, et al., 2002, Proteins, 48:31-43\n). A combinatorial optimization algorithm may be used alone or in conjunction with another combinatorial optimization algorithm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the present invention, the strategy for applying a combinatorial optimization algorithm is to find the global minimum energy configuration. In an alternate embodiment, the strategy is to find one or more low energy or favorable sequences. In an alternate embodiment, the strategy is to find the global minimum energy configuration and then find one or more low energy or favorable sequences. For example, as outlined in \n \nUSSN 6,269,312\n \n, preferred embodiments utilize a Dead End Elimination (DEE) step and a Monte Carlo step. In other embodiments, tabu search algorithms are used or combined with DEE and/or Monte Carlo, among other search methods (see \nModern Heuristic Search Methods, edited by V.J. Rayward-Smith et al., 1996, John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\n; \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/218,102\n \n; and \n \nPCT WO 02/25588\n \n). In another preferred embodiment, a genetic algorithm may be used; see for example \n \nUSSN 09/877,695\n \n and \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/071,859\n \n. As another example, as is more fully described in \n \nUS 6,188,965\n \n; \n \nUS 6,269,312\n \n; \n \nUS 6,403,312\n \n; \n \nUSSN 09/782,004\n \n; \n \nUSSN 09/927,790\n \n; \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/218,102\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 98/07254\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 01/40091\n \n; and \n \nPCT WO 02/25588\n \n, the global optimum may be reached, and then further computational processing may occur, which generates additional optimized sequences. In the simplest embodiment, design calculations are not combinatorial. That is, energy calculations are used to evaluate amino acid substitutions individually at single variable positions. For other calculations it is preferred to evaluate amino acid substitutions at more than one variable position. In a preferred embodiment, all possible interaction energies are calculated prior to combinatorial optimization. In an alternatively preferred embodiment, energies may be calculated as needed during combinatorial optimization.\n\n\n \n\n\nLibrary generation\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides methods for generating libraries that may subsequently be screened experimentally to single out optimized Fc variants. By \"\nlibrary\n\" as used herein is meant a set of one or more Fc variants. Library may refer to the set of variants in any form. In one embodiment, the library is a list of nucleic acid or amino acid sequences, or a list of nucleic acid or amino acid substitutions at variable positions. For example, the examples used to illustrate the present invention below provide libraries as amino acid substitutions at variable positions. In one embodiment, a library is a list of at least one sequence that are Fc variants optimized for a desired property. For example see, \nFilikov et al., 2002, Protein Sci 11:1452-1461\n and \nLuo et al., 2002, Protein Sci 11:1218-1226\n. In an alternate embodiment, a library may be defined as a combinatorial list, meaning that a list of amino acid substitutions is generated for each variable position, with the implication that each substitution is to be combined with all other designed substitutions at all other variable positions. In this case, expansion of the combination of all possibilities at all variable positions results in a large explicitly defined library. A library may refer to a physical composition of polypeptides that comprise the Fc region or some domain or fragment of the Fc region. Thus a library may refer to a physical composition of antibodies or Fc fusions, either in purified or unpurified form. A library may refer to a physical composition of nucleic acids that encode the library sequences. Said nucleic acids may be the genes encoding the library members, the genes encoding the library members with any operably linked nucleic acids, or expression vectors encoding the library members together with any other operably linked regulatory sequences, selectable markers, fusion constructs, and/or other elements. For example, the library may be a set of mammalian expression vectors that encode Fc library members, the protein products of which may be subsequently expressed, purified, and screened experimentally. As another example, the library may be a display library. Such a library could, for example, comprise a set of expression vectors that encode library members operably linked to some fusion partner that enables phage display, ribosome display, yeast display, bacterial surface display, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe library may be generated using the output sequence or sequences from computational screening. As discussed above, computationally generated libraries are significantly enriched in stable, properly folded, and functional sequences relative to randomly generated libraries. As a result, computational screening increases the chances of identifying proteins that are optimized for the design goal. The set of sequences in a library is generally, but not always, significantly different from the parent sequence, although in some cases the library preferably contains the parent sequence. As is known In the art, there are a variety of ways that a library may be derived from the output of computational screening calculations. For example, methods of library generation described in \n \nUS 6,403,312\n \n; \n \nUSSN 09/782,004\n \n; \n \nUSSN 09/927,790\n \n; \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/218,102\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 01/40091\n \n; and \n \nPCT WO 02/25588\n \n find use in the present invention. In one embodiment, sequences scoring within a certain range of the global optimum sequence may be included in the library. For example, all sequences within 10 kcal/mol of the lowest energy sequence could be used as the library. In an alternate embodiment, sequences scoring within a certain range of one or more local minima sequences may be used. In a preferred embodiment, the library sequences are obtained from a filtered set. Such a list or set may be generated by a variety of methods, as is known in the art, for example using an algorithm such as Monte Carlo, B&B, or SCMF. For example, the top 10\n3\n or the top 10\n5\n sequences in the filtered set may comprise the library. Alternatively, the total number of sequences defined by the combination of all mutations may be used as a cutoff criterion for the library. Preferred values for the total number of recombined sequences range from 10 to 10\n20\n, particularly preferred values range from 100 to 10\n9\n. Alternatively, a cutoff may be enforced when a predetermined number of mutations per position is reached. In some embodiments, sequences that do not make the cutoff are included in the library. This may be desirable In some situations, for instance to evaluate the approach to library generation, to provide controls or comparisons, or to sample additional sequence space. For example, the parent sequence may be included in the library, even if it does not make the cutoff.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nClustering algorithms may be useful for classifying sequences derived by computational screening methods into representative groups. For example, the methods of clustering and their application described in \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/218,102\n \n and \n \nPCT WO 02/25588\n \n, find use in the present invention. Representative groups may be defined, for example, by similarity. Measures of similarity include, but are not limited to sequence similarity and energetic similarity. Thus the output sequences from computational screening may be clustered around local minima, referred to herein as clustered sets of sequences. For example, sets of sequences that are close in sequence space may be distinguished from other sets. In one embodiment, coverage within one or a subset of clustered sets may be maximized by including In the library some, most, or all of the sequences that make up one or more clustered sets of sequences. For example, it may be advantageous to maximize coverage within the one, two, or three lowest energy clustered sets by including the majority of sequences within these sets in the library. In an alternate embodiment, diversity across clustered sets of sequences may be sampled by including within a library only a subset of sequences within each clustered set. For example, all or most of the clustered sets could be broadly sampled by including the lowest energy sequence from each clustered set in the library.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSequence information may be used to guide or filter computationally screening results for generation of a library. As discussed, by comparing and contrasting alignments of protein sequences, the degree of variability at a position and the types of amino acids which occur naturally at that position may be observed. Data obtained from such analyses are useful in the present invention. The benefits of using sequence information have been discussed, and those benefits apply equally to use of sequence information to guide library generation. The set of amino acids that occur in a sequence alignment may be thought of as being pre-screened by evolution to have a higher chance than random at being compatible with a protein's structure, stability, solubility, function, and immunogenicity. The variety of sequence sources, as well as the methods for generating sequence alignments that have been discussed, find use in the application of sequence information to guiding library generation. Likewise, as discussed above, various criteria may be applied to determine the importance or weight of certain residues in an alignment. These methods also find use in the application of sequence information to guide library generation. Using sequence information to guide library generation from the results of computational screening finds broad use in the present invention. In one embodiment, sequence information is used to filter sequences from computational screening output. That is to say, some substitutions are subtracted from the computational output to generate the library. For example the resulting output of a computational screening calculation or calculations may be filtered so that the library includes only those amino acids, or a subset of those amino acids that meet some criteria, for example that are observed at that position in an alignment of sequences. In an alternate embodiment, sequence information is used to add sequences to the computational screening output. That is to say, sequence information is used to guide the choice of additional amino acids that are added to the computational output to generate the library. For example, the output set of amino acids for a given position from a computational screening calculation may be augmented to include one or more amino acids that are observed at that position in an alignment of protein sequences. In an alternate embodiment, based on sequence alignment information, one or more amino acids may be added to or subtracted from the computational screening sequence output in order to maximize coverage or diversity. For example, additional amino acids with properties similar to those that are found in a sequence alignment may be added to the library. For example, if a position is observed to have uncharged polar amino acids in a sequence alignment, additional uncharged polar amino acids may be included in the library at that position.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLibraries may be processed further to generate subsequent libraries. In this way, the output from a computational screening calculation or calculations may be thought of as a primary library. This primary library may be combined with other primary libraries from other calculations or other libraries, processed using subsequent calculations, sequence information, or other analyses, or processed experimentally to generate a subsequent library, herein referred to as a secondary library. As will be appreciated from this description, the use of sequence information to guide or filter libraries, discussed above, is itself one method of generating secondary libraries from primary libraries. Generation of secondary libraries gives the user greater control of the parameters within a library. This enables more efficient experimental screening, and may allow feedback from experimental results to be interpreted more easily, providing a more efficient design/experimentation cycle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are a wide variety of methods to generate secondary libraries from primary libraries. For example, \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/218,102\n \n and \n \nPCT WO 02/25588\n \n, describes methods for secondary library generation that find use in the present invention. Typically some selection step occurs in which a primary library is processed in some way. For example, in one embodiment a selection step occurs wherein some set of primary sequences are chosen to form the secondary library. In an alternate embodiment, a selection step is a computational step, again generally including a selection step, wherein some subset of the primary library is chosen and then subjected to further computational analysis, including both further computational screening as well as techniques such as \n\"in silico\"\n shuffling or recombination (see, for example \n \nUS 5,830,721\n \n; \n \nUS 5,811,238\n \n; \n \nUS 5,605,793\n \n; and \n \nUS 5,837,458\n \n, error-prone PCR, for example using modified nucleotides; known mutagenesis techniques including the use of multi-cassettes; and DNA shuffling (\nCrameri et al., 1998, Nature 391:288-291\n; \nCoco et al., 2001, Nat Biotechnol 19:354-9\n \n;\n \nCoco et al., 2002, Nat Biotechnol, 20:1246-50\n), heterogeneous DNA samples (\n \nUS 5,939,250\n \n); ITCHY (\nOstermeier et al., 1999, Nat Biotechnol 17:1205-1209\n); StEP (\nZhao et al., 1998, Nat Biotechnol 16:258-261\n)\n,\n GSSM (\n \nUS 6,171,820\n \n and \n \nUS 5,965,408\n \n); \nin vivo\n homologous recombination, ligase assisted gene assembly, end-complementary PCR, profusion (\nRoberts & Szostak, 1997, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 94:12297-12302\n); yeast/bacteria surface display (\nLu et al., 1995, Biotechnology 13:366-372\n); \nSeed & Aruffo, 1987, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 84(10):3365-3369\n; \nBoder & Wittrup, 1997, Nat Biotechnol 15:553-557\n). In an alternate embodiment, a selection step occurs that is an experimental step, for example any of the library screening steps below, wherein some subset of the primary library is chosen and then recombined experimentally, for example using one of the directed evolution methods discussed below, to form a secondary library. In a preferred embodiment, the primary library is generated and processed as outlined in \n \nUS 6,403,312\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGeneration of secondary and subsequent libraries finds broad use in the present invention. In one embodiment, different primary libraries may be combined to generate a secondary or subsequent library. In another embodiment, secondary libraries may be generated by sampling sequence diversity at highly mutatable or highly conserved positions. The primary library may be analyzed to determine which amino acid positions in the template protein have high mutational frequency, and which positions have low mutational frequency. For example, positions in a protein that show a great deal of mutational diversity in computational screening may be fixed in a subsequent round of design calculations. A filtered set of the same size as the first would now show diversity at positions that were largely conserved in the first library. Alternatively, the secondary library may be generated by varying the amino acids at the positions that have high numbers of mutations, while keeping constant the positions that do not have mutations above a certain frequency.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis discussion is not meant to constrain generation of libraries subsequent to primary libraries to secondary libraries. As will be appreciated, primary and secondary libraries may be processed further to generate tertiary libraries, quaternary libraries, and so on. In this way, library generation is an iterative process. For example, tertiary libraries may be constructed using a variety of additional steps applied to one or more secondary libraries; for example, further computational processing may occur, secondary libraries may be recombined, or subsets of different secondary libraries may be combined. In a preferred embodiment, a tertiary library may be generated by combining secondary libraries. For example, primary and/or secondary libraries that analyzed different parts of a protein may be combined to generate a tertiary library that treats the combined parts of the protein. In an alternate embodiment, the variants from a primary library may be combined with the variants from another primary library to provide a combined tertiary library at lower computational cost than creating a very long filtered set. These combinations may be used, for example, to analyze large proteins, especially large multi-domain proteins, of which Fc is an example. Thus the above description of secondary library generation applies to generating any library subsequent to a primary library, the end result being a final library that may screened experimentally to obtain protein variants optimized for a design goal. These examples are not meant to constrain generation of secondary libraries to any particular application or theory of.operation for the present invention. Rather, these examples are meant to illustrate that generation of secondary libraries, and subsequent libraries such as tertiary libraries and so on, is broadly useful in computational screening methodology for library generation.\n\n\n \n\n\nExperimental Production and Screening\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides methods for producing and screening libraries of Fc variants. The described methods are not meant to constrain the present invention to any particular application or theory of operation. Rather, the provided methods are meant to illustrate generally that one or more Fc variants or one or more libraries of Fc variants may be produced and screened experimentally to obtain optimized Fc variants. Fc variants may be produced and screened in any context, whether as an Fc region as precisely defined herein, a domain or fragment thereof, or a larger polypeptide that comprises Fc such as an antibody or Fc fusion. General methods for antibody molecular biology, expression, purification, and screening are described in \nAntibody Engineering, edited by Duebel & Kontermann, Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, 2001\n; and \nHayhurst & Georgiou, 2001, Curr Opin Chem Biol 5:683-689\n; \nMaynard & Georgiou, 2000, Annu Rev Biomed Eng 2:339-76\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the present invention, the library sequences are used to create nucleic acids that encode the member sequences, and that may then be cloned into host cells, expressed and assayed, if desired. Thus, nucleic acids, and particularly DNA, may be made that encode each member protein sequence. These practices are carried out using well-known procedures. For example, a variety of methods that may find use in the present invention are described in \nMolecular Cloning - A Laboratory Manual, 3rd Ed. (Maniatis, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York, 2001\n), and \nCurrent Protocols in Molecular Biology (John Wiley & Sons\n). As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the generation of exact sequences for a library comprising a large number of sequences is potentially expensive and time consuming. Accordingly, there are a variety of techniques that may be used to efficiently generate libraries of the present invention. Such methods that may find use in the present invention are described or referenced in \n \nUS 6,403,312\n \n; \n \nUSSN 09/782,004\n \n; \n \nUSSN 09/927,790\n \n; \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/218,102\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 01/40091\n \n; and \n \nPCT WO 02/25588\n \n. Such methods include but are not limited to gene assembly methods, PCR-based method and methods which use variations of PCR, ligase chain reaction-based methods, pooled oligo methods such as those used in synthetic shuffling, error-prone amplification methods and methods which use oligos with random mutations, classical site-directed mutagenesis methods, cassette mutagenesis, and other amplification and gene synthesis methods. As is known in the art, there are a variety of commercially available kits and methods for gene assembly, mutagenesis, vector subcloning, and the like, and such commercial products find use in the present invention for generating nucleic acids that encode Fc variant members of a library.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Fc variants of the present invention may be produced by culturing a host cell transformed with nucleic acid, preferably an expression vector, containing nucleic acid encoding the Fc variants, under the appropriate conditions to induce or cause expression of the protein. The conditions appropriate for expression will vary with the choice of the expression vector and the host cell, and will be easily ascertained by one skilled in the art through routine experimentation. A wide variety of appropriate host cells may be used, including but not limited to mammalian cells, bacteria, insect cells, and yeast. For example, a variety of cell lines that may find use in the present invention are described in the ATCC® cell line catalog, available from the American Type Culture Collection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment, the Fc variants are expressed in mammalian expression systems, including systems in which the expression constructs are introduced into the mammalian cells using virus such as retrovirus or adenovirus. Any mammalian cells may be used, with human, mouse, rat, hamster, and primate cells being particularly preferred. Suitable cells also include known research cells, including but not limited to Jurkat T cells, NIH3T3, CHO, COS, and 293 cells. In an alternately preferred embodiment, library proteins are expressed in bacterial cells. Bacterial expression systems are well known in the art, and include \nEscherichia coli\n (\nE. coli\n)\n, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus cremoris,\n and \nStreptococcus lividans.\n In alternate embodiments, Fc variants are produced in insect cells or yeast cells. In an alternate embodiment, Fc variants are expressed \nin vitro\n using cell free translation systems. In vitro translation systems derived from both prokaryotic (e.g. \nE\n. \ncoli\n) and eukaryotic (e.g. wheat germ, rabbit reticulocytes) cells are available and may be chosen based on the expression levels and functional properties of the protein of interest. For example, as appreciated by those skilled in the art, \nin vitro\n translation is required for some display technologies, for example ribosome display. In addition, the Fc variants may be produced by chemical synthesis methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nucleic acids that encode the Fc variants of the present invention may be incorporated into an expression vector in order to express the protein. A variety of expression vectors may be utilized for protein expression. Expression vectors may comprise self-replicating extra-chromosomal vectors or vectors which integrate into a host genome. Expression vectors are constructed to be compatible with the host cell type. Thus expression vectors which find use in the present invention include but are not limited to those which enable protein expression in mammalian cells, bacteria, insect cells, yeast, and in \nin vitro\n systems. As is known in the art, a variety of expression vectors are available, commercially or otherwise, that may find use in the present invention for expressing Fc variant proteins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExpression vectors typically comprise a protein operably linked with control or regulatory sequences, selectable markers, any fusion partners, and/or additional elements. By \"\noperably linked\n\" herein is meant that the nucleic acid is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. Generally, these expression vectors include transcriptional and translational regulatory nucleic acid operably linked to the nucleic acid encoding the Fc variant, and are typically appropriate to the host cell used to express the protein. In general, the transcriptional and translational regulatory sequences may include promoter sequences, ribosomal binding sites, transcriptional start and stop sequences, translational start and stop sequences, and enhancer or activator sequences. As is also known in the art, expression vectors typically contain a selection gene or marker to allow the selection of transformed host cells containing the expression vector. Selection genes are well known in the art and will vary with the host cell used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFc variants may be operably linked to a fusion partner to enable targeting of the expressed protein, purification, screening, display, and the like. Fusion partners may be linked to the Fc variant sequence via a linker sequences. The linker sequence will generally comprise a small number of amino acids, typically less than ten, although longer linkers may also be used. Typically, linker sequences are selected to be flexible and resistant to degradation. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, any of a wide variety of sequences may be used as linkers. For example, a common linker sequence comprises the amino acid sequence GGGGS. A fusion partner may be a targeting or signal sequence that directs Fc variant protein and any associated fusion partners to a desired cellular location or to the extracellular media. As is known in the art, certain signaling sequences may target a protein to be either secreted into the growth media, or into the periplasmic space, located between the inner and outer membrane of the cell. A fusion partner may also be a sequence that encodes a peptide or protein that enables purification and/or screening. Such fusion partners include but are not limited to polyhistidine tags (His-tags) (for example H\n6\n and H\n10\n or other tags for use with Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC) systems (e.g. Ni\n+2\n affinity columns)), GST fusions, MBP fusions, Strep-tag, the BSP biotinylation target sequence of the bacterial enzyme BirA, and epitope tags which are targeted by antibodies (for example c-myc tags, flag-tags, and the like). As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, such tags may be useful for purification, for screening, or both. For example, an Fc variant may be purified using a His-tag by immobilizing it to a Ni\n+2\n affinity column, and then after purification the same His-tag may be used to immobilize the antibody to a Ni\n+2\n coated plate to perform an ELISA or other binding assay (as described below). A fusion partner may enable the use of a selection method to screen Fc variants (see below). Fusion partners that enable a variety of selection methods are well-known in the art, and all of these find use in the present invention. For example, by fusing the members of an Fc variant library to the gene III protein, phage display can be employed (\nKay et al., Phage display of peptides and proteins: a laboratory manual, Academic Press, San Diego, CA, 1996\n; \nLowman et al., 1991, Biochemistry 30:10832-10838\n; \nSmith, 1985, Science 228:1315-1317\n). Fusion partners may enable Fc variants to be labeled. Alternatively, a fusion partner may bind to a specific sequence on the expression vector, enabling the fusion partner and associated Fc variant to be linked covalently or noncovalently with the nucleic acid that encodes them. For example, \n \nUSSN 09/642,574\n \n; \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/080,376\n \n; \n \nUSSN 09/792,630\n \n; \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/023,208\n \n; \n \nUSSN 09/792,626\n \n; \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/082,671\n \n; \n \nUSSN 09/953,351\n \n; \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/097,100\n \n; \n \n \nUSSN\n 60/366,658\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 00/22906\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 01/49058\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 02/04852\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 02/04853\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 02/08023\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 01/28702\n \n; and \n \nPCT WO 02/07466\n \n describe such a fusion partner and technique that may find use in the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe methods of introducing exogenous nucleic acid into host cells are well known in the art, and will vary with the host cell used. Techniques include but are not limited to dextran-mediated transfection, calcium phosphate precipitation, calcium chloride treatment, polybrene mediated transfection, protoplast fusion, electroporation, viral or phage infection, encapsulation of the polynucleotide(s) in liposomes, and direct microinjection of the DNA into nuclei. In the case of mammalian cells, transfection may be either transient or stable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment, Fc variant proteins are purified or isolated after expression. Proteins may be isolated or purified in a variety of ways known to those skilled in the art. Standard purification methods include chromatographic techniques, including ion exchange, hydrophobic interaction, affinity, sizing or gel filtration, and reversed-phase, carried out at atmospheric pressure or at high pressure using systems such as FPLC and HPLC. Purification methods also include electrophoretic, immunological, precipitation, dialysis, and chromatofocusing techniques.\n\nUltrafiltration and diafiltration techniques, in conjunction with protein concentration, are also useful. As is well known in the art, a variety of natural proteins bind Fc and antibodies, and these proteins can find use in the present invention for purification of Fc variants. For example, the bacterial proteins A and G bind to the Fc region. Likewise, the bacterial protein L binds to the Fab region of some antibodies, as of course does the antibody's target antigen. Purification can often be enabled by a particular fusion partner. For example, Fc variant proteins may be purified using glutathione resin if a GST fusion is employed, Ni\n+2\n affinity chromatography if a His-tag is employed, or immobilized anti-flag antibody if a flag-tag is used. For general guidance in suitable purification techniques, see \nProtein Purification: Principles and Practice, 3rd Ed., Scopes, Springer-Verlag, NY, 1994\n. The degree of purification necessary will vary depending on the screen or use of the Fc variants. In some instances no purification is necessary. For example in one embodiment, if the Fc variants are secreted, screening may take place directly from the media. As is well known in the art, some methods of selection do not involve purification of proteins. Thus, for example, if a library of Fc variants is made into a phage display library, protein purification may not be performed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFc variants may be screened using a variety of methods, including but not limited to those that use \nin vitro\n assays, \nin vivo\n and cell-based assays, and selection technologies. Automation and high-throughput screening technologies may be utilized in the screening procedures. Screening may employ the use of a fusion partner or label. The use of fusion partners has been discussed above. By \"labeled\" herein is meant that the Fc variants of the invention have one or more elements, isotopes, or chemical compounds attached to enable the detection in a screen. In general, labels fall into three classes: a) immune labels, which may be an epitope incorporated as a fusion partner that is recognized by an antibody, b) isotopic labels, which may be radioactive or heavy isotopes, and c) small molecule labels, which may include fluorescent and colorimetric dyes, or molecules such as biotin that enable other labeling methods. Labels may be incorporated into the compound at any position and may be incorporated \nin vitro\n or \nin vivo\n during protein expression.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment, the functional and/or biophysical properties of Fc variants are screened in an \nin vitro\n assay. \nIn vitro\n assays may allow a broad dynamic range for screening properties of interest. Properties of Fc variants that may be screened include but are not limited to stability, solubility, and affinity for Fc ligands, for example Fc□Rs. Multiple properties may be screened simultaneously or individually. Proteins may be purified or unpurified, depending on the requirements of the assay. In one embodiment, the screen is a qualitative or quantitative binding assay for binding of Fc variants to a protein or nonprotein molecule that is known or thought to bind the Fc variant. In a preferred embodiment, the screen is a binding assay for measuring binding to the antibody's or Fc fusions' target antigen. In an alternately preferred embodiment, the screen is an assay for binding of Fc variants to an Fc ligand, including but are not limited to the family of Fc□Rs, the neonatal receptor FcRn, the complement protein C1q, and the bacterial proteins A and G. Said Fc ligands may be from any organism, with humans, mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys preferred. Binding assays can be carried out using a variety of methods known in the art, including but not limited to FRET (Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer) and BRET (Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer) -based assays, AlphaScreen™ (Amplified Luminescent Proximity Homogeneous Assay), Scintillation Proximity Assay, ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay), SPR (Surface Plasmon Resonance, also known as BIACORE®), isothermal titration calorimetry, differential scanning calorimetry, gel electrophoresis, and chromatography including gel filtration. These and other methods may take advantage of some fusion partner or label of the Fc variant. Assays may employ a variety of detection methods including but not limited to chromogenic, fluorescent, luminescent, or isotopic labels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe biophysical properties of Fc variant proteins, for example stability and solubility, may be screened using a variety of methods known in the art. Protein stability may be determined by measuring the thermodynamic equilibrium between folded and unfolded states. For example, Fc variant proteins of the present invention may be unfolded using chemical denaturant, heat, or pH, and this transition may be monitored using methods including but not limited to circular dichroism spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, absorbance spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, calorimetry, and proteolysis. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the kinetic parameters of the folding and unfolding transitions may also be monitored using these and other techniques. The solubility and overall structural integrity of an Fc variant protein may be quantitatively or qualitatively determined using a wide range of methods that are known in the art. Methods which may find use in the present invention for characterizing the biophysical properties of Fc variant proteins include gel electrophoresis, chromatography such as size exclusion chromatography and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, ultraviolet absorbance spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry, differential scanning calorimetry, analytical ultra-centrifugation, dynamic light scattering, proteolysis, and cross-linking, turbidity measurement, filter retardation assays, immunological assays, fluorescent dye binding assays, protein-staining assays, microscopy, and detection of aggregates via ELISA or other binding assay. Structural analysis employing X-ray crystallographic techniques and NMR spectroscopy may also find use. In one embodiment, stability and/or solubility may be measured by determining the amount of protein solution after some defined period of time. In this assay, the protein may or may not be exposed to some extreme condition, for example elevated temperature, low pH, or the presence of denaturant. Because function typically requires a stable, soluble, and/or well-folded/structured protein, the aforementioned functional and binding assays also provide ways to perform such a measurement. For example, a solution comprising an Fc variant could be assayed for its ability to bind target antigen, then exposed to elevated temperature for one or more defined periods of time, then assayed for antigen binding again. Because unfolded and aggregated protein is not expected to be capable of binding antigen, the amount of activity remaining provides a measure of the Fc variant's stability and solubility.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment, the library is screened using one or more cell-based or \nin vivo\n assays. For such assays, Fc variant proteins, purified or unpurified, are typically added exogenously such that cells are exposed to individual variants or pools of variants belonging to a library. These assays are typically, but not always, based on the function of an antibody or Fc fusion that comprises the Fc variant; that is, the ability of the antibody or Fc fusion to bind a target antigen and mediate some biochemical event, for example effector function, ligand/receptor binding inhibition, apoptosis, and the like. Such assays often involve monitoring the response of cells to antibody or Fc fusion, for example cell survival, cell death, change in cellular morphology, or transcriptional activation such as cellular expression of a natural gene or reporter gene. For example, such assays may measure the ability of Fc variants to elicit ADCC, ADCP, or CDC. For some assays additional cells or components, that is in addition to the target cells, may need to be added, for example example serum complement, or effector cells such as peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs), NK cells, macrophages, and the like. Such additional cells may be from any organism, preferably humans, mice, rat, rabbit, and monkey. Antibodies and Fc fusions may cause apoptosis of certain cell lines expressing the antibody's target antigen, or they may mediate attack on target cells by immune cells which have been added to the assay. Methods for monitoring cell death or viability are known in the art, and include the use of dyes, immunochemical, cytochemical, and radioactive reagents. For example, caspase staining assays may enable apoptosis to be measured, and uptake or release of radioactive substrates or fluorescent dyes such as alamar blue may enable cell growth or activation to be monitored. In a preferred embodiment, the DELFIA® EuTDA-based cytotoxicity assay (Perkin Elmer, MA) is used. Alternatively, dead or damaged target cells may be monitoried by measuring the release of one or more natural intracellular proteins, for example lactate dehydrogenase. Transcriptional activation may also serve as a method for assaying function in cell-based assays. In this case, response may be monitored by assaying for natural genes or proteins which may be upregulated, for example the release of certain interleukins may be measured, or alternatively readout may be via a reporter construct. Cell-based assays may also involve the measure of morphological changes of cells as a response to the presence of an Fc variant. Cell types for such assays may be prokaryotic or eukaryotic, and a variety of cell lines that are known in the art may be employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, cell-based screens are performed using cells that have been transformed or transfected with nucleic acids encoding the Fc variants. That is, Fc variant proteins are not added exogenously to the cells. For example, in one embodiment, the cell-based screen utilizes cell surface display. A fusion partner can be employed that enables display of Fc variants on the surface of cells (\nWitrrup, 2001, Curr Opin Biotechnol, 12:395-399\n). Cell surface display methods that may find use in the present invention include but are not limited to display on bacteria (\nGeorgiou et al., 1997, Nat Biotechnol 15:29-34\n \n;\n \nGeorgiou et al., 1993, Trends Biotechnol 11:6-10\n; \nLee et al., 2000, Nat Biotechnol 18:645-648\n \n;\n \nJun et al., 1998, Nat Biotechnol 16:576-80\n)\n,\n yeast (\nBoder & Wittrup, 2000, Methods Enzymol 328:430-44\n \n;\n \nBoder & Wittrup, 1997, Nat Biotechnol 15:553-557\n)\n,\n and mammalian cells (\nWhitehorn et al., 1995, Bio/technology 13:1215-1219\n). In an alternate embodiment, Fc variant proteins are not displayed on the surface of cells, but rather are screened intracellularly or in some other cellular compartment. For example, periplasmic expression and cytometric screening (\nChen et al., 2001, Nat Biotechnol 19: 537-542\n), the protein fragment complementation assay (\nJohnsson & Varshavsky, 1994, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 91:10340-10344\n.; \nPelletier et al., 1998, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 95:12141-12146\n), and the yeast two hybrid screen (\nFields & Song, 1989, Nature 340:245-246\n) may find use in the present invention. Alternatively, if a polypeptide that comprises the Fc variants, for example an antibody or Fc fusion, imparts some selectable growth advantage to a cell, this property may be used to screen or select for Fc variants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs is known in the art, a subset of screening methods are those that select for favorable members of a library. Said methods are herein referred to as \"\nselection methods\"\n, and these methods find use in the present invention for screening Fc variant libraries. When libraries are screened using a selection method, only those members of a library that are favorable, that is which meet some selection criteria, are propagated, isolated, and/or observed. As will be appreciated, because only the most fit variants are observed, such methods enable the screening of libraries that are larger than those screenable by methods that assay the fitness of library members individually. Selection is enabled by any method, technique, or fusion partner that links, covalently or noncovalently, the phenotype of an Fc variant with its genotype, that is the function of an Fc variant with the nucleic acid that encodes it. For example the use of phage display as a selection method is enabled by the fusion of library members to the gene III protein. In this way, selection or isolation of variant proteins that meet some criteria, for example binding affinity for an FcγR, also selects for or isolates the nucleic acid that encodes it. Once isolated, the gene or genes encoding Fc variants may then be amplified. This process of isolation and amplification, referred to as panning, may be repeated, allowing favorable Fc variants in the library to be enriched. Nucleic acid sequencing of the attached nucleic acid ultimately allows for gene identification.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of selection methods are known in the art that may find use in the present invention for screening Fc variant libraries. These include but are not limited to phage display (\nPhage display of peptides and proteins: a laboratory manual, Kay et al., 1996, Academic Press, San Diego, CA, 1996\n; \nLowman et al., 1991, Biochemistry 30:10832-10838\n; \nSmith, 1985, Science 228:1315-1317\n) and its derivatives such as selective phage infection (\nMalmborg et al., 1997, J Mol Biol 273:544-551\n), selectively infective phage (\nKrebber et al., 1997, J Mol Biol 268:619-630\n), and delayed infectivity panning (\nBenhar et al., 2000, J Mol Biol 301:893-904\n), cell surface display (\nWitrrup, 2001, Curr Opin Biotechnol, 12:395-399\n) such as display on bacteria (\nGeorgiou et al., 1997, Nat Biotechnol 15:29-34\n; \nGeorgiou et al., 1993, Trends Biotechnol 11:6-10\n; \nLee et al., 2000, Nat Biotechnol 18:645-648\n; \nJun et al., 1998, Nat Biotechnol 16:576-80\n)\n,\n yeast (\nBoder & Wittrup, 2000, Methods Enzymol 328:430-44\n \n;\n \nBoder & Wittrup, 1997, Nat Biotechnol 15:553-557\n), and mammalian cells (\nWhitehom et al., 1995, Bio/technology 13:1215-1219\n), as well as \nin vitro\n display technologies (\nAmstutz et al., 2001, Curr Opin Biotechnol 12:400-405\n) such as polysome display (\nMattheakis et al., 1994, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 91:9022-9026\n), ribosome display (\nHanes et al., 1997, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 94:4937-4942\n), mRNA display (\nRoberts & Szostak, 1997, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 94:12297-12302\n; \nNemoto et al., 1997, FEBS Lett 414:405-408\n), and ribosome-inactivation display system (\nZhou et al., 2002, J Am Chem Soc 124, 538-543\n)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther selection methods that may find use in the present invention include methods that do not rely on display, such as \nin vivo\n methods including but not limited to periplasmic expression and cytometric screening (\nChen et al., 2001, Nat Biotechnol 19:537-542\n), the protein fragment complementation assay (\nJohnsson & Varshavsky, 1994, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 91:10340-10344\n; \nPelletier et al., 1998, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 95:12141-12146\n), and the yeast two hybrid screen (\nFields & Song, 1989, Nature 340:245-246\n) used in selection mode (\nVisintin et al., 1999, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 96:11723-11728\n). In an alternate embodiment, selection is enabled by a fusion partner that binds to a specific sequence on the expression vector, thus linking covalently or noncovalently the fusion partner and associated Fc variant library member with the nucleic acid that encodes them. For example, \n \nUSSN 09/642,574\n \n; \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/080,376\n \n; \n \nUSSN 09/792,630\n \n; \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/023,208\n \n; \n \nUSSN 09/792,626\n \n; \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/082,671\n \n; \n \nUSSN 09/953,351\n \n; \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/097,100\n \n; \n \n \nUSSN\n 60/366,658\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 00/22906\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 01/49058\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 02/04852\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 02/04853\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 02/08023\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 01/28702\n \n; and \n \nPCT WO 02/07466\n \n describe such a fusion partner and technique that may find use in the present invention. In an alternative embodiment, \nin vivo\n selection can occur if expression of a polypeptide that comprises the Fc variant, such as an antibody or Fc fusion, imparts some growth, reproduction, or survival advantage to the cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA subset of selection methods referred to as \"directed evolution\" methods are those that include the mating or breading of favorable sequences during selection, sometimes with the incorporation of new mutations. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, directed evolution methods can facilitate identification of the most favorable sequences In a library, and can increase the diversity of sequences that are screened. A variety of directed evolution methods are known in the art that may find use in the present invention for screening Fc variant libraries, including but not limited to DNA shuffling (\n \nPCT WO 00/42561 A3\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 01/70947 A3\n \n), exon shuffling (\n \nUS 6,365,377\n \n; \nKolkman & Stemmer, 2001, Nat Biotechnol 19:423-428\n)\n,\n family shuffling (\nCrameri et al., 1998, Nature 391:288-291\n; \n \nUS 6,376,246\n \n), RACHITT™ (\nCoco et al., 2001, Nat Biotechnol 19:354- 359\n; \n \nPCT WO 02/06469\n \n), STEP and random priming of \nin vitro\n recombination (\nZhao et al., 1998, Nat Biotechnol 16:258-261\n; \nShao et al., 1998, Nucleic Acids Res 26:681-683\n), exonuclease mediated gene assembly (\n \nUS 6,352,842\n \n; \n \nUS 6,361,974\n \n), Gene Site Saturation Mutagenesis™ (\n \nUS 6,358,709\n \n), Gene Reassembly™ (\n \nUS 6,358,709\n \n), SCRATCHY (\nLutz et al., 2001, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 98:11248-11253\n), DNA fragmentation methods (\nKikuchi et al., Gene 236:159-167\n), single-stranded DNA shuffling (\nKikuchi et al., 2000, Gene 243:133-137\n), and AMEsystem™ directed evolution protein engineering technology (Applied Molecular Evolution) (\n \nUS US 5,824,514\n \n; \n \nUS 5,817,483\n \n; \n \nUS 5,814,476\n \n; \n \nUS 5,763,192\n \n; \n \nUS 5,723,323\n \n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe biological properties of the antibodies and Fc fusions that comprise the Fc variants of the present invention may be characterized in cell, tissue, and whole organism experiments. As is know in the art, drugs are often tested in animals, including but not limited to mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, cats, pigs, and monkeys, in order to measure a drug's efficacy for treatment against a disease or disease model, or to measure a drug's pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and other properties. Said animals may be referred to as disease models. Therapeutics are often tested in mice, including but not limited to nude mice, SCID mice, xenograft mice, and transgenic mice (including knockins and knockouts). For example, an antibody or Fc fusion of the present invention that is intended as an anti-cancer therapeutic may be tested in a mouse cancer model, for example a xenograft mouse. In this method, a tumor or tumor cell line is grafted onto or injected into a mouse, and subsequently the mouse is treated with the therapeutic to determine the ability of the antibody or Fc fusion to reduce or inhibit cancer growth. Such experimentation may provide meaningful data for determination of the potential of said antibody or Fc fusion to be used as a therapeutic. Any organism, preferably mammals, may be used for testing. For example because of their genetic similarity to humans, monkeys can be suitable therapeutic models, and thus may be used to test the efficacy, toxicity, pharmacokinetics, or other property of the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention. Tests of the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention in humans are ultimately required for approval as drugs, and thus of course these experiments are contemplated. Thus the antibodies and Fc fusions of the present invention may be tested in humans to determine their therapeutic efficacy, toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and/or other clinical properties.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\n \n \n \nExamples are provided below to illustrate the present invention. These examples are not meant to constrain the present invention to any particular application or theory of operation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor all positions discussed in the present invention, numbering is according to the EU index as in Kabat (\nKabat et al., 1991, Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed., United States Public Health Svice, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda\n). Those skilled in the art of antibodies will appreciate that this convention consists of nonsequential numbering in specific regions of an Immunoglobulin sequence, enabling a normalized reference to conserved positions in immunoglobulin families. Accordingly, the positions of any given immunoglobulin as defined by the EU index will not necessarily correspond to its sequential sequence. \nFigure 3\n shows the sequential and EU index numbering schemes for the antibody alemtuzumab in order to illustrate this principal more clearly. It should also be noted that polymorphisms have been observed at a number of Fc positions, including but not limited to \nKabat\n 270, 272, 312, 315, 356, and 358, and thus slight differences between the presented sequence and sequences in the scientific literature may exist.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExample 1. Computational Screening and Design of Fc Libraries Computational screening calculations were carried out to design optimized Fc variants. Fc variants were computationally screened, constructed, and experimentally investigated over several computation/experimention cycles. For each successive cycle, experimental data provided feedback into the next set of computational screening calculations and library design. All computational screening calculations and library design are presented in Example 1. For each set of calculations, a table is provided that presents the results and provides relevant information and parameters.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral different structures of Fc bound bound to the extracellular domain of Fc□Rs served as template structures for the computational screening calculations. Publicly available Fc/FcγR complex structures included \npdb accession code\n 1 E4K (\nSondermann et al., 2000, Nature 406:267-273\n.), and pdb accession codes 1IIS and 1IIX (\nRadaev et al., 2001, J Biol Chem 276:16469-16477\n). The extracellular regions of Fc□RIIIb and FcyRIIIa are 96% identical, and therefore the use of the Fc/FcγRIIIb structure is essentially equivalent to use of FcyRIIIa. Nonetheless, for some calculations, a more precise Fc/Fc□RIIIa template structure was constructed by modeling a D129G mutation in the 1IIS and 1 E4K structures (referred to as D129G 1IIS and \nD129G\n 1 E4K template structures). In addition, the structures for human Fc bound to the extracellular domains of human FcγRIIb, human F158 Fc□RIIIa, and mouse FcγRIII were modeled using standard methods, the available Fc□R sequence information, the aforementioned Fc/FcγR structures, as well as structural information for unbound complexes (\npdb accession code\n 1 H9V)(\nSondermann et al., 2001, J Mol Biol 309:737-749\n) (\npdb accession code\n 1 FCG)(\nMaxwell et al., 1999, Nat Struct Biol 6:437-442\n), Fc□RIIb (pdb accession code 2FCB)(\nSondermann et al., 1999, Embo J 18:1095-1103\n), and Fc□RIIIb (pdb accession code 1E4J)(\nSondermann et al., 2000, Nature 406:267-273\n.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVariable positions and amino acids to be considered at those positions were chosen by visual inspection of the aforementioned Fc/FcγR and FcγR structures, and using solvent accessibility information and sequence information. Sequence information of Fcs and FcγRs was particularly useful for determining variable positions at which substitutions may provide distinguishing affinities between activating and Inhibitory receptors. Virtually all Cγ2 positions were screened computationally. The Fc structure is a homodimer of two heavy chains (labeled chains A and B in the 1IIS, 1IIX, and 1 E4K structures) that each include the hinge and C□2-C□3 domains (shown in \nFigure 2\n). Because the Fc□R (labeled chain C in the 1IIS, 1IIX, and 1 E4K structures) binds asymmetrically to the Fc homodimer, each chain was often considered separately in design calculations. For some calculations, Fc and/or Fc□R residues proximal to variable position residues were floated, that is the amino acid conformation but not the amino acid identity was allowed to vary in a protein design calculation to allow for conformational adjustments. These are indicated below the table for each set of calculations when relevant. Considered amino acids typically belonged to either the Core, Core XM, Surface, Boundary, Boundary XM, or All 20 classifications, unless noted otherwise. These classifications are defined as follows: Core = alanine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, and methionine; Core XM = alanine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan; Surface = alanine, serine, threonine, aspartic acid, asparagine, glutamine, glutamic acid, arginine, lysine and histidine; Boundary = alanine, serine, threonine, aspartic acid, asparagine, glutamine, glutamic acid, arginine, lysine, histidine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, and methionine; Boundary XM = Boundary = alanine, serine, threonine, aspartic acid, asparagine, glutamine, glutamic acid, arginine, lysine, histidine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan; All 20 = all 20 naturally occurring amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe majority of calculations followed one of two general types of computational screening methods. In one method, the conformations of amino acids at variable positions were represented as a set of backbone-independent side chain rotamers derived from the rotamer library of Dunbrack & Cohen (\nDunbrack et al., 1997, Protein Sci 6:1661-1681\n). The energies of all possible combinations of the considered amino acids at the chosen variable positions were calculated using a force field containing terms describing van der Waals, solvation, electrostatic, and hydrogen bond interactions, and the optimal (ground state) sequence was determined using a Dead End Elimination (DEE) algorithm. As will be appreciated by those In the art, the predicted lowest energy sequence is not necessarily the true lowest energy sequence because of errors primarily in the scoring function, coupled with the fact that subtle conformational differences in proteins can result in dramatic differences in stability. However, the predicted ground state sequence is likely to be close to the true ground state, and thus additional favorable diversity can be explored by evaluating the energy of sequences that are close in sequence space and energy around the predicted ground state. To accomplish this, as well as to generate a diversity of sequences for a library, a Monte Carlo (MC) algorithm was used to evaluate the energies of 1000 similar sequences around the predicted ground state. The number of sequences out of the 1000 sequence set that contain that amino acid at that variable position is referred to as the occupancy for that substitution, and this value may reflect how favorable that substitution is. This computational screening method is substantially similar to Protein Design Automation® (PDA®) technology, as described in \n \nUS 6,188,965\n \n; \n \nUS 6,269,312\n \n; \n \nUS 6,403,312\n \n; \n \nUSSN 09/782,004\n \n; \n \nUSSN 09/927,790\n \n; \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/218,102\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 98/07254\n \n; \n \nPCT WO 01/40091\n \n; and \n \nPCT WO 02/25588\n \n, and for ease of description, is referred to as PDA® technology throughout the examples. Tables that present the results of these calculations provide for each variable position on the designated chain (column 1) the amino acids considered at each variable position (column 2), the WT Fc amino acid identity at each variable position (column 3), the amino acid identity at each variable position in the DEE ground state sequence (column 4), and the set of amino acids and corresponding occupancy that are observed in the Monte Carlo output (column 5).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther calculations utilized a genetic algorithm (GA) to screen for low energy sequences, with energies being calculated during each round of \"evolution\" for those sequences being sampled. The conformations of amino acids at variable and floated positions were represented as a set of side chain rotamers derived from a backbone-independent rotamer library using a flexible rotamer model (\nMendes et al., 1999, Proteins 37:530-543\n). Energies were calculated using a force field containing terms describing van der Waals, solvation, electrostatic, and hydrogen bond interactions. This calculation generated a list of 300 sequences which are predicted to be low in energy. To facilitate analysis of the results and library generation, the 300 output sequences were clustered computationally into 10 groups of similar sequences using a nearest neighbor single linkage hierarchical clustering algorithm to assign sequences to related groups based on similarity scores (\nDiamond, 1995, Acta Cryst D51:127-135\n). That is, all sequences within a group are most similar to all other sequences within the same group and less similar to sequences in other groups. The lowest energy sequence from each of these ten clusters are used as a representative of each group, and are presented as results. This computational screening method is substantially similar to Sequence Prediction Algorithm™ (SPA™) technology, as described in (\nRaha et al., 2000, Protein Sci 9:1106-1119\n); \n \nUSSN 09/877,695\n \n; and \n \n \nUSSN\n 10/071,859\n \n, and for ease of description, is referred to as SPA™ technology throughout the examples.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nComputational screening was applied to design energetically favorable Interactions at the Fc/Fc□R interface at groups of variable positions that mediate or potentially mediate binding with Fc□R. Because the binding interface involves a large number of Fc residues on the two different chains, and because Fc□Rs bind asymmetrically to Fc, residues were grouped in different sets of interacting variable positions, and designed in separate sets of calculations. In many cases these sets were chosen as groups of residues that were deemed to be coupled, that is the energy of one or more residues is dependent on the identity of one or more other residues. Various template structures were used, and in many cases calculations explored substitutions on both chains. For many of the variable position sets, calculations were carried out using both the PDA® and SPA™ technology computational screening methods described. The results of these calculations and relevant parameters and information are presented in Tables 1 - 30 below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTables that present the results of these calculations provide for each variable position on the designated chain (column 1) the amino acids considered at each variable position (column 2), the WT Fc amino acid identity at each variable position (column 3), and the amino acid identity at the variable positions for the lowest energy sequence from each cluster group (columns 4-13). Tables 1-59 are broken down into two sets, as labeled below, PDA@ and SPA™ technology. \nColumn\n 4 of the PDA® tables show the frequency of each residue that occurs in the top 1000 sequences during that PDA® run. Thus, in the first row of Table 1, at position 328, when run using boundary amino acids as the set of variable residues for that position, L occurred 330 times in the top 1000 sequence, M occurred 302 times, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, included within the compositions of the invention are antibodies that have any of the listed amino acid residues in the listed positions, either alone or in any combination (note preferred combinations are listed in the claims, the summary and the figures). One preferred combination is the listed amino acids residues in the listed positions in a ground state (sometimes referred to herein as the \"global solution\", as distinguished from the wild-type). Similarly, residue positions and particular amino acids at those residue positions may be combined between tables.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor SPA™ technology tables, such as Table 4, \ncolumn\n 4 is a SPA™ run that results in a protein with the six listed amino acids at the six listed positions (\ne.g. column\n 4 is a single protein with a wild-type sequence except for 239E, 265G, 267S, 269Y, 270T and 299S. Thus, each of these individual proteins are included within the invention. In addition, combinations between SPA™ proteins, both within tables and between tables, are also included.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, each table shows the presence or absence of carbohydrate, but specifically included are the reverse sequences; e.g. Table 1 is listed for an aglycosylated variant, but these same amino acid changes can be done on a glycosylated variant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, each table lists the template structure used, as well as \"floated\" residues; for example, Table 2 used a PDA® run that floated C120, C132 and C134.\n\n \n \nTable 1\n \n \n \n \n \nPosition\n \n \n \nConsidered Amino Acids\n \n \n \nWT\n \n \n \nGround State\n \n \n \nSequences Around Ground State\n \n \n \n \n \n328 A\n \nBoundary\n \nL\n \nL\n \nL:330 M:302 E:111 K:62 A:45 Q:39 D:36 S:30 T:28 N:10 R:7\n \n \n \n332 A\n \nSurface\n \nI\n \nR\n \nR:247 K:209 Q:130 H:95 E:92 T:59 D:51 N:51 S:42 A:24\n \n \n \n328 B\n \nBoundary\n \nL\n \nL\n \nL:321 M:237 T:166 K:73 R:72 S:55 Q:20 D:17 E:13 A:12 V:10 N:4\n \n \n \n332 B\n \nSurface\n \nI\n \nE\n \nE:269 Q:180 R:145 K:111 D:97 T:78 N:65 S:28 A:14 H:13\n \n \n \n \n \nPDA® technology, 1IIS template structure;

The N297 carbohydrate covers up the exposed hydrophobic patch that would normally be the interface for a protein-protein interaction with another Ig domain, maintaining the stability and structural integrity of Fc and keeping the Cγ2 domains from aggregating across the central axis. Key residues for design are F241, F243, V262, and V264, which reside behind the carbohydrate on Cγ2, in addition to residues such as L328, 1332, and 1336, which are exposed nonpolar residues facing inward towards the opposed Cγ2 domain, that were considered in previously presented calculations. The importance of these Cγ2 residues is supported by noting that the corresponding residues in the Cγ3 domain by sequence alignment either mediate the nonpolar interaction between the two Cγ3 domains or are buried in the Cγ3 core. The results of these design calculations are presented in Table 53.\n\n \n \nTable 53\n \n \n \n \n \nPosition\n \n \n \nConsidered Amino Acids\n \n \n \nWT\n \n \n \nGround State\n \n \n \nSequences Around Ground State\n \n \n \n \n \n241 A\n \nSurface\n \nF\n \nE\n \nE:190 R:172 K:138 H:117 T:93 Q:91 D:85 S:49 N:49 A:16\n \n \n \n243 A\n \nSurface\n \nF\n \nR\n \nR:190 H:164 Q:152 E:149 K:92 T:71 D:64 N:58 S:42 A:18\n \n \n \n262 A\n \nSurface\n \nV\n \nD\n \nD:416 E:164 N:138 Q:87 T:83 R:44 S:32 K:24 A:11 H:1\n \n \n \n264 A\n \nSurface\n \nV\n \nH\n \nR:368 H:196 K:147 E:108 Q:68 T:34 N:33 D:25 S:15 A:6\n \n \n \n \n \nPDA® technology; 1 IIS template structure; - carbohydrate\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a final set of calculations, a SPA™ computational screening method was applied to evaluate the replacement of all chosen variable positions with all 20 amino acids. The lowest energy rotamer conformation for all 20 amino acids was determined, and this energy was defined as the energy of substitution for that amino acid at that variable position. These calculations thus provided an energy of substitution for each of the 20 amino acids at each variable position. These data were useful for a variety of design goals aimed at both glycosylated and aglycosylated Fc, including optimization of Fc/FcγR affinity, Fc stability, Fc solubility, carbohydrate conformation, and hinge conformation. Furthermore, because these calculations provide energies for both favorable and unfavorable substitutions, they guide substitutions that may enable differential binding to activating versus inhibitory FcγRs. Various template structures were used, and calculations explored substitutions on both chains. The results of these calculations and relevant parameters and information are presented in Tables 54 - 59 below. \nColumn\n 1 lists the variable positions on chain A and B of the 1 IIS template structure. \nColumn\n 2 lists the wild-type amino acid identity at each variable position. The remaining 20 columns provide the energy for each of the natural 20 amino acids (shown in the top row). All substitutions were normalized with respect to the lowest energy substitution, which was set to 0 energy. For example in Table 54, for L235 on chain A, serine is the lowest energy substitution, and L235A is 0.9 kcal/mol less stable than L235S. Extremely high energies were set to 20 kcal/mol for energies between 20 - 50 kcal/mol, and 50 kcal/mold for energies greater than 50 kcal/mol. Favorable substitutions may be considered to be the lowest energy substitution for each position, and substitutions that have small energy differences from the lowest energy substitution, for example substitutions within 1-2, 1-3, 1-5, or 1-10 kcal/mol.\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results of the design calculations presented above in Tables 1 - 59 were used to construct a series of Fc variant libraries for experimental production and screening. Experimental libraries were designed in successive rounds of computational and experimental screening. Design of subsequent Fc libraries benefitted from feedback from prior libraries, and thus typically comprised combinations of Fc variants that showed favorable properties in the previous screen. The entire set of Fc variants that were constructed and experimentally tested is shown in Table 60. In this table, \nrow\n 1 lists the variable positions, and the rows that follow indicate the amino acids at those variable positions for WT and the Fc variants. For example, \nvariant\n 18 has the following four mutations: F241 E, F243Y, V262T, and V264R. The variable position residues that compose this set of Fc variants are illustrated structurally in \nFigure 3\n, and are presented in the context of the human IgG1 Fc sequence in \nFigure 4\n.\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\nExample 2: Experimental production and screening of Fc libraries\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe majority of experimentation on the Fc variants was carried out in the context of the anti-cancer antibody alemtuzumab (Campath®, a registered trademark of Ilex Pharmaceuticals LP). Alemtuzumab binds a short linear epitope within its target antigen CD52 (\nHale et al., 1990, Tissue Antigens 35:118-127\n; \nHale, 1995, Immunotechnology 1:175-187\n). Alemtuzumab has been chosen as the primary engineering template because its efficacy is due in part to its ability to recruit effector cells (\nDyer et a/., 1989, Blood 73:1431-1439\n; \nFriend et al., 1991, Transplant Proc 23:2253-2254\n; \nHale et al., 1998, Blood 92:4581-4590\n; \nGlennie et al., 2000, Immunol Today 21:403-410\n), and because production and use of its antigen in binding assays are relatively straightforward, In order to evaluate the optimized Fc variants of the present invention in the context of other antibodies, select Fc variants were evaluated in the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab (Rituxan®, a registered trademark of IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation), and the anti-Her2 antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin®, a registered trademark of Genentech). The use of alemtuzumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab for screening purposes is not meant to constrain the present invention to any particular antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe IgG1 full length light (V\nL\n-C\nL\n) and heavy (V\nH\n-Cγ1-Cγ2-Cγ3) chain antibody genes for alemtuzumab, rituximab, and trastuzumab were constructed with convenient end restriction sites to facilitate subcloning. The genes were ligated into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1Zeo (Invitrogen). The V\nH\n-Cγ1-Cγ2-Cγ3 clone in pcDNA3.1zeo was used as a template for mutagenesis of the Fc region. Mutations were introduced into this clone using PCR-based mutagenesis techniques. Fc variants were sequenced to confirm the fidelity of the sequence. Plasmids containing heavy chain gene (V\nH\n-Cγ1-Cγ2-Cγ3) (wild-type or variants) were co-transfected with plasmid containing light chain gene (V\nL\n-C\nL\n) into 293T cells. Media were harvested 5 days after transfection. Expression of immunoglobulin was monitored by screening the culture supernatant of transfectomas by western using peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, catalog # 109-035-088). \nFigure 6\n shows expression of wild-type alemtuzumab and \nvariants\n 1 through 10 in 293T cells. Antibodies were purified from the supernatant using protein A affinity chromatography (Pierce, Catalog # 20334. \nFigure 7\n shows results of the protein purification for WT alemtuzumab. Antibody Fc variants showed similar expression and purification results to WT. Some Fc variants were deglycosylated in order to determine their solution and functional properties in the absence of carbohydrate. To obtain deglycosylated antibodies, purified alemtuzumab antibodies were incubated with peptide-N-glycosidase (PNGase F) at 37°C for 24h. \nFigure 8\n presents an SDS PAGE gel confirming deglycosylation for several Fc variants and WT alemtuzumab.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to confirm the functional fidelity of alemtuzumab produced under these conditions, the antigenic CD52 peptide, fused to GST, was expressed in E.coli BL21 (DE3) under IPTG induction. Both un-induced and induced samples were run on a SDS PAGE gel, and transferred to PVDF membrane. For western analysis, either alemtuzumab from Sotec (final concentration 2.5ng/ul) or media of transfected 293T cells (final alemtuzumab concentration about 0.1-0.2ng/ul) were used as primary antibody, and peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti human IgG was used as secondary antibody. \nFigure 9\n presents these results. The ability to bind target antigen confirms the structural and functional fidelity of the expressed alemtuzumab. Fc variants that have the same variable region as WT alemtuzumab are anticipated to maintain a comparable binding affinity for antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to screen for Fc/FcγR binding, the extracellular regions of human V158 FcγRIIIa, human F158 FcγRIIIa, human FcγRIIb, human FcγRIIa, and mouse FcγRIII, were expressed and purified. \nFigure 10\n presents an SDS PAGE gel that shows the results of expression and purification of human V158 FcγRIIIa. The extracellular region of this receptor was obtained by PCR from a clone obtained from the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC:22630). The receptor was fused with glutathione S-Transferase (GST) to enable screening. Tagged Fc□RIIIa was transfected in 293T cells, and media containing secreted Fc□RIIIa were harvested 3 days later and purified. For western analysis, membrane was probed with anti-GST antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBinding affinity to Fc□RIIIa and FcγRIIb was measured for all designed Fc variants using an AlphaScreen™ assay (Amplified Luminescent Proximity Homogeneous Assay (ALPHA), PerkinElmer, Wellesley, MA), a bead-based non-radioactive luminescent proximity assay. Laser excitation of a donor bead excites oxygen, which if sufficiently close to the acceptor bead generates a cascade of chemiluminescent events, ultimately leading to fluorescence emission at 520-620 nm. The AlphaScreen™ assay was applied as a competition assay for screening Fc variants. WT alemtuzumab antibody was biotinylated by standard methods for attachment to streptavidin donor beads, and GST-tagged FcγR was bound to glutathione chelate acceptor beads. In the absence of competing Fc variants, WT antibody and FcγR interact and produce a signal at 520-620 nm. Addition of untagged Fc variant competes with the WT Fc/FcγR interaction, reducing fluorescence quantitatively to enable determination of relative binding affinities. All Fc variants were screened for V158 FcγRIIIa binding using the AlphaScreen™ assay. Select Fc variants were subsequently screened for binding to FcγRIIb, as well as other FcγRs and Fc ligands.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 11\n shows AlphaScreen™ data for binding to human V158 FcγRIIIa by select Fc variants. The binding data were normalized to the maximum and minimum luminescence signal provided by the baselines at low and high concentrations of competitor antibody respectively. The data were fit to a one site competition model using nonlinear regression, and these fits are represented by the curves in the figure. These fits provide the \ninhibitory concentration\n 50% (IC50) (i.e. the concentration required for 50% inhibition) for each antibody, illustrated by the dotted lines in \nFigure 11\n, thus enabling the relative binding affinities of Fc variants to be quantitatively determined. Here, WT alemtuzumab has an IC50 of (4.63x10\n-9\n)x(2) = 9.2 nM, whereas S239D has an IC50 of (3.98x10\n-10\n)x(2) = 0.8 nM. Thus S239D alemtuzumab binds 9.2 nM / 0.8 nM = 11.64-fold more tightly than WT alemtuzumab to human V158 FcγRIIIa. Similar calculations were performed for the binding of all Fc variants to human V158 FcγRIIIa. Select Fc variants were also screened for binding to human Fc□RIIb, and examples of these AlphaScreen™ binding data are shown in \nFigure 12\n. Table 61 presents the fold-enhancement or fold-reduction relative to the parent antibody for binding of Fc variants to human V158 FcγRIIIa (column 3) and human FcγRIIb (column 4), as determined by the AlphaScreen™ assay. For these data, a fold above 1 indicates an enhancement in binding affinity, and a fold below 1 indicates a reduction in binding affinity relative to WT Fc. All data were obtained in the context of alemtuzumab, except for those indicated with an asterix (*), which were tested in the context of trastuzumab.\n\n \n \nTable 61\n \n \n \n \n \nVariant\n \n \n

Table 61 provides Fc variants that bind more tightly to FcγRIIIa, and thus are candidates for improving the effector function of antibodies and Fc fusions. These include a number of variants that comprise substitutions at 239, 264, 330, and 332. \nFigure 13\n shows AlphaScreen™ binding data for some of these Fc variants. The majority of these Fc variants provide substantially greater FcγRIIIa binding enhancements over S298A/E333A/K334A.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough the majority of Fc variants were screened in the context of the antibody alemtuzumab, select Fc variants were also screened in the context of rituximab and trastuzumab. AlphaScreen™ data for binding of select Fc variants to human V158 FcγRIIIa in the context of rituximab and trastuzumab are shown in \nFigures 14\n and \n15\n respectively. The results indicate that the Fc variants display consistent binding enhancements regardless of the antibody context, and thus the Fc variants of the present invention are broadly applicable to antibodies and Fc fusions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFc variants have been obtained that show differentially enhanced binding to FcγRIIIa over FcγRIIb. As discussed, optimal effector function may result from Fc variants wherein affinity for activating FcγRs is greater than affinity for the inhibitory FcγRIIb. AlphaScreen™ data directly comparing binding to FcγRIIIa and FcγRIIb for two Fc variants with this specificity profile are shown in \nFigures 16a and 16b\n. This concept can be defined quantitatively as the fold-enhancement or - reduction of the activating FγR (Table 61, column 3) divided by the fold-enhancement or -reduction of the inhibitory FcγR (Table 61, column 4), herein referred to as the \nFcγRIIIIa-fold:FcγRIIb-fold ratio.\n This value provided in \nColumn\n 5 in Table 61. Table 61 shows that Fc variants provide this specificity profile, with a FcγRIIIa-fold:FcγRIIb-fold ratio as high as 86:1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome of the most promising Fc variants of the present invention for enhancing effector function have both substantial increases in affinity for FcγRIIIa and favorable FcγRIIIa-fold:FcγRIIb-fold ratios. These include, for example, S239D/I332E (FcγRIIIa-fold = 56, FcγRIIIa-fold:FcγRIIb-fold = 3), S239D/A330Y/I332E (FcγRIIIa-fold =130), S239D/A330L/I332E (FcγRIIIa-fold = 139, FcγRIIIa-fold:FcγRIIb-fold = 18), and S239D/S29BA/I332E (FcγRIIIa-fold = 295, FcγRIIIa-fold:FcγRIIb-fold = 48). \nFigure 17\n shows AlphaScreen™ binding data for these and other Fc variants to human V158 FcγRIIIa.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBecause there are a number of FcγRs that contribute to effector function, it may be worthwhile to additionally screen Fc variants against other receptors. \nFigure 18\n shows AlphaScreen™ data for binding of select Fc variants to human R131 FcγRIIa. As can be seen, those aforementioned variants with favorable binding enhancements and specificity profiles also show enhanced binding to this activating receptor. The use of FcγRIIIa, FcγRIIb, and FcγRIIc for screening is not meant to constrain experimental testing to these particular FcγRs; other FcγRs are contemplated for screening, including but not limited to the myriad isoforms and allotypes of FcγRI, FcγRII, and FcγRIII from humans, mice, rats, monkeys, and the like, as previously described.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTaken together, the FcγR binding data provided in \nFigures 11 - 18\n and Table 61 indicate that a number of substitions at \n \npositions\n \n 234, 235, 239, 240, 243, 264, 266, 325, 328, 330, and 332 are promising candidates for improving the effector function of antibodies and Fc fusions. Because combinations of some of these substitutions have typically resulted in additive or synergistic binding improvements, it is anticipated that as yet unexplored combinations of the Fc variants provided in Table 61 will also provide favorable results. Thus all combinations of the Fc variants in Table 61 are contemplated. Likewise, combinations of any of the Fc variants in Table 61 with other discovered or undiscovered Fc variants may also provide favorable properties, and these combinations are also contemplated. Furthermore, it is anticipated from these results that other substitutions at \n \npositions\n \n 234, 235, 239, 240, 243, 264, 266, 325, 328, 330, and 332 may also provide favorable binding enhancements and specificities, and thus substitutions at these positions other than those presented in Table 61 are contemplated.\n\n\n \n \nExample 4: Reduced binding to Fc\nγ\nRs\n \n\n\n \n \n \nAs discussed, although there is a need for greater effector function, for some antibody therapeutics, reduced or eliminated effector function may be desired. Several Fc variants in Table 61 substantially reduce or ablate FcγR binding, and thus may find use in antibodies and Fc fusions wherein effector function is undesirable. AlphaScreen™ binding data for some examples of such variants are shown in \nFigures 19a and 19b\n. These Fc variants, as well as their use In combination, may find use for eliminating effector function when desired, for example in antibodies and Fc fusions whose mechanism of action involves blocking or antagonism but not killing of the cells bearing target antigen.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 5: Aglycosylated Fc variants\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAs discussed, one goal of the current experiments was to obtain optimized aglycosylated Fc variants. Several Fc variants provide significant progress towards this goal. Because it is the site of glycosylation, substitution at N297 results in an aglycosylated Fc. Whereas all other Fc variants that comprise a substitution at N297 completely ablate FcγR binding, N297D/I332E has significant binding affinity for FcγRIIIa, shown in Table 61 and illustrated in \nFigure 20\n. The exact reason for this result is uncertain in the absence of a high-resolution structure for this variant, although the computational screening predictions suggest that it is potentially due to a combination of new favorable Fc/FcγR interactions and favorable electrostatic properties. Indeed other electrostatic substitutions are envisioned for further optimization of aglycosylated Fc. Table 61 shows that other aglycosylated Fc variants such as S239D/N297D/I332E and N297D/A330Y/I332E provide binding enhancements that bring affinity for FcγRIIIa within 0.28- and 0.43-fold respectively of glycosylated WT alemtuzumab. Combinations of these variants with other Fc variants that enhance FcγR binding are contemplated, with the goal of obtaining aglycosylated Fc variants that bind one or more FcγRs with affinity that is approximately the same as or even better than glycosylated parent Fc. An additional set of promising Fc variants provide stability and solubility enhancements in the absence of carbohydrate. Fc variants that comprise substitutions at positions 241, 243, 262, and 264, positions that do not mediate FγR binding but do determine the interface between the carbohydrate and Fc, ablate FγR binding, presumably because they perturb the conformation of the carbohydrate. In deglycosylated form, however, Fc variants F241 E/F243R/V262E/V264R, F241 E/F243Q/V262T/V264E, F241R/F243Q/V262T/V264R, and F241 E/F243YN262TN264R show stronger binding to FcγRIIIa than In glycosylated form, as shown by the AlphaScreen™ data in \nFigure 21\n. This result indicates that these are key positions for optimization of the structure, stability, solubility, and function of aglycosylated Fc. Together these results suggests that protein engineering can be used to restore the favorable functional and solution properties of antibodies and Fc fusions in the absence of carbohydrate, and pave the way for aglycosylated antibodies and Fc fusions with favorable solution properties and full functionality that comprise substitutions at these and other Fc positions.\n\n\n \n \nExample 6. Affinity of Fc variants for polymorphic forms of Fc\nγ\nRIIIa\n \n\n\n \n \n \nAs discussed above, an important parameter of Fc-mediated effector function is the affinity of Fc for both V158 and F158 polymorphic forms of FcγRIIIa. AlphaScreen™ data comparing binding of select variants to the two receptor allotypes are shown in \nFigure 22a\n (V158 FcγRIIIa) and \nFigure 22b\n (F158 FcγRIIIa). As can be seen, all variants improve binding to both FcγRIIIa allotypes. These data indicate that those Fc variants of the present invention with enhanced effector function will be broadly applicable to the entire patient population, and that enhancement to clinical efficacy will potentially be greatest for the low responsive patient population who need it most.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe FcγR binding affinities of these Fc variants were further investigated using Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden). SPR is a sensitive and extremely quantitative method that allows for the measurement of binding affinities of protein-protein interactions, and has been used to effectively measure Fc/FcγR binding (\nRadaev et al., 2001, J Biol Chem 276:16478-16483\n). SPR thus provides an excellent complementary binding assay to the AlphaScreen™ assay. His-tagged V158 FcγRIIIa was immobilized to an SPR chip, and WT and Fc variant alemtuzumab antibodies were flowed over the chip at a range of concentrations. Binding constants were obtained from fitting the data using standard curve-fitting methods. Table 62 presents dissociation constants (Kd) for binding of select Fc variants to V158 FcγRIIIa and F158 FcγRIIIa obtained using SPR, and compares these with IC50s obtained from the AlphaScreen™ assay. By dividing the Kd and IC50 for each variant by that of WT alemtuzumab, the fold-improvements over WT (Fold) are obtained.\n\n \n \nTable 62\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSPR V158 Fc\nγ\nRIIIa\n \n \n \nSPR F158 Fc\nγ\nRIIIa\n \n \n \nAlphaScreen™ V158 Fc\nγ\nRIIIa\n \n \n \nAlphaScreen™ F158 Fc\nγ\nRIIIa\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nKd (nM)\n \n \n \nFold\n \n \n \nKd (nM)\n \n \n \nFold\n \n \n \nIC50 (nM)\n \n \n \nFold\n \n \n \nIC50 (nM)\n \n \n \nFold\n \n \n \n \n \n \nWT\n \n \n68\n \n \n \n730\n \n \n \n6.4\n \n \n \n17.2\n \n \n \n \n \n \nV264I\n \n \n64\n \n1.1\n \n550\n \n1.3\n \n4.5\n \n1.4\n \n11.5\n \n1.5\n \n \n \n \nI332E\n \n \n31\n \n2.2\n \n72\n \n10.1\n \n1.0\n \n6.4\n \n2.5\n \n6.9\n \n \n \n \nV264I/\nI332E\n \n \n \n17\n \n4.0\n \n52\n \n14.0\n \n0.5\n \n12.8\n \n1.1\n \n15.6\n \n \n \n \nS298A\n \n \n52\n \n1.3\n \n285\n \n2.6\n \n2.9\n \n2.2\n \n12.0\n \n1.4\n \n \n \n \nS298A/\nE333A/ K334A\n \n \n \n39\n \n1.7\n \n156\n \n4.7\n \n2.5\n \n2.6\n \n7.5\n \n2.3\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe SPR data corroborate the improvements to FcγRIIIa affinity observed by AlphaScreen™ assay. Table 62 further indicates the superiority of V264I/I332E and 1332E over S298A and S298A/E333A/K334A; whereas S298A/E333A/K334A improves Fc binding to V158 and F158 FcγRIIIa by 1.7-fold and 4.7-fold respectively, I332E shows binding enhancements of 2.2-fold and 10.1-fold respectively, and V264I/I332E shows binding enhancements of 4.0-fold and 14-fold respectively. Also worth noting is that the affinity of V264I/I332E for F158 FcγRIIIa (52 nM) is better than that of WT for the V158 allotype (68 nM), suggesting that this Fc variant, as well as those with even greater improvements in binding, may enable the clinical efficacy of antibodies for the low responsive patient population to achieve that currently possible for high responders. The correlation between the SPR and AlphaScreen™ binding measurements are shown in \nFigures 23a - 23d\n. \nFigures 23a and 23b\n show the Kd - IC50 correlations for binding to V158 FcγRIIIa and F158 FcγRIIIa respectively, and \nFigures 23c and 23d\n show the fold-improvement correlations for binding to V158 FcγRIIIa and F158 FcγRIIIa respectively. The good fits of these data to straight lines (r\n2\n = 0.9, r\n2\n = 0.84, r\n2\n = 0.98, and r\n2\n = 0.90) support the accuracy the AlphaScreen™ measurements, and validate its use for determining the relative Fc□R binding affinities of Fc variants.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 7. ADCC of Fc variants\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn order to determine the effect on effector function, cell-based ADCC assays were performed on select Fc variants. ADCC was measured using the DELFIA® EuTDA-based cytotoxicity assay (Perkin Elmer, MA) with purified human peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) as effector cells. Target cells were loaded with BATDA at 1x10\n6\n cells/ml, washed 4 times and seeded into 96-well plate at 10,000 cells/well. The target cells were then opsonized using Fc variant or WT antibodies at the indicated final concentration. Human PBMCs were added at the indicated fold-excess of target cells and the plate was incubated at 37°C for 4 hrs. The co-cultured cells were centrifuged at 500xg, supernatants were transferred to a separate plate and incubated with Eu solution, and relative fluorescence units were measured using a Packard Fusion™ reader (Packard Biosciences, IL). Samples were run in triplicate to provide error estimates (n=3, +/- S.D.). PBMCs were allotyped for the V158 or F158 FcγRIIIa allotype using PCR.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nADCC assays were run on Fc variant and WT alemtuzumab using DoHH-2 lymphoma target cells. \nFigure 24a\n is a bar graph showing the ADCC of these proteins at 10 ng/ml antibody. Results show that alemtuzumab Fc variants I332E, V2641, and I332E/V264I have substantially enhanced ADCC compared to WT alemtuzumab, with the relative ADCC enhancements proportional to their binding improvements to FcγRIIIa as indicated by AlphaScreen™ assay and SPR. The dose dependence of ADCC on antibody concentration is shown in \nFigure 24b\n. These data were normalized to the minimum and maximum fluorescence signal provided by the baselines at low and high concentrations of antibody respectively. The data were fit to a sigmoidal dose-response model using nonlinear regression, represented by the curve in the figure. The fits enable determination of the \neffective concentration\n 50% (EC50) (i.e. the concentration required for 50% effectiveness), which provides the relative enhancements to ADCC for each Fc variant. The EC50s for these binding data are analogous to the IC50s obtained from the AlphaScreen™ competition data, and derivation of these values is thus analogous to that described in Example 2 and \nFigure 11\n. In \nFigure 24b\n, the log(EC50)s, obtained from the fits to the data, for WT, V264I/I332E, and S239D/I332E alemtuzumab are 0.99, 0.60, and 0.49 respectively, and therefore their respective EC50s are 9.9, 4.0, and 3.0. Thus V264I/I332E and S239E/I332E provide a 2.5-fold and 3.3-fold enhancement respectively in ADCC over WT alemtuzumab using PBMCs expressing heterozygous V158/F158 FcγRIIIa. These data are summarized in Table 63 below.\n\n \n \nTable 63\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nlog(EC50)\n \n \n \nEC50 (ng/ml)\n \n \n \nFold Improvement Over WT\n \n \n \n \n \n \nWT\n \n \n0.99\n \n9.9\n \n \n \n \n \n \nV264I/I332E\n \n \n0.60\n \n4.0\n \n2.5\n \n \n \n \nS239D/I332E\n \n \n0.49\n \n3.0\n \n3.3\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to determine whether these ADCC enhancements are broadly applicable to antibodies, select Fc variants were evaluated in the context of rituximab and trastuzumab. ADCC assays were run on V2641/1332E, WT, and S298A/D333A/K334A rituximab using WIL2-S lymphoma target cells. \nFigure 25a\n presents a bar graph showing the ADCC of these proteins at 1 ng/ml antibody. Results indicate that V264I/I332E rituximab provides substantially enhanced ADCC relative to WT rituximab, as well as superior ADCC to S298A/D333A/K334A, consistent with the FcγRIIIa binding improvements observed by AlphaScreen™ assay and SPR. \nFigure 25b\n shows the dose dependence of ADCC on antibody concentration. The EC50s obtained from the fits of these data and the relative fold-improvements in ADCC are provided in Table 64 below. As can be seen V264I/I332E rituximab provides an 11.3-fold enhancement in EC50 over WT for PBMCs expressing homozygous F158/F158 FcγRIIIa. The greater improvements observed for rituximab versus alemtuzumab are likely due to the use of homozygous F158/F158 FcγRIIIa rather than heterozygous V158/F158 FcγRIIIa PBMCs, as well as potentially the use of different antibodies and target cell lines.\n\n \n \nTable 64\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nlog(EC50)\n \n \n \nEC50 (ng/ml)\n \n \n \nFold Improvement Over WT\n \n \n \n \n \n \nWT\n \n \n0.23\n \n1.7\n \n \n \n \n \n \nS298A/E333A/K334A\n \n \n-0.44\n \n0.37\n \n4.6\n \n \n \n \nV264I/I332E\n \n \n-0.83\n \n0.15\n \n11.3\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nADCC assays were run on Fc variant and WT trastuzumab using two breast carcinoma target cell lines BT474 and Sk-Br-3. \nFigure 26a\n shows a bar graph illustrating ADCC at 1 ng/ml antibody. Results indicate that V264I and V264I/I332E trastuzumab provide substantially enhanced ADCC compared to WT trastuzumab, with the relative ADCC enhancements proportional to their binding improvements to FcγRIIIa as indicated by AlphaScreen™ assay and SPR. \nFigure 26b\n shows the dose dependence of ADCC on antibody concentration. The EC50s obtained from the fits of these data and the relative fold-improvements in ADCC are provided In Table 65 below. Significant ADCC improvements are observed for I332E trastuzumab when combined with A330L and A330Y.\n\n \n \nTable 65\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nlog(EC50)\n \n \n \nEC50 (ng/ml)\n \n \n \nFold Improvement Over WT\n \n \n \n \n \n \nWT\n \n \n1.1\n \n11.5\n \n \n \n \n \n \n1332E\n \n \n0.34\n \n2.2\n \n5.2\n \n \n \n \nA330Y/I332E\n \n \n-0.04\n \n0.9\n \n12.8\n \n \n \n \nA330L/I332E\n \n \n0.04\n \n1.1\n \n10.5\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 26c\n shows another set of dose response ADCC data at variable antibody concentrations for trastuzumab variants.

Results show that trastuzumab Fc variants S239D/I332E, S239D/S298A/I332E, S239D/A330Y/I332E, and S239D/A330L/I332E/ provide substantial ADCC enhancements relative to WT trastuzumab and S298A/E333A/K334A; consistent with the FcγR binding data observed by the AlphaScreen™ assay and SPR. S239D/A330L/I332E trastuzumab shows the largest increase in effector function observed thus far, providing an approximate 50-fold enhancement in EC50 over WT for PBMCs expressing homozygous F158/F158 FcγRIIIa.\n\n \n \nTable 66\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nlog(EC50)\n \n \n \nEC50 (ng/ml)\n \n \n \nFold Improvement Over WT\n \n \n \n \n \n \nWT\n \n \n0.45\n \n2.83\n \n \n \n \n \n \nS298A/E333A/K334A\n \n \n-0.17\n \n0.67\n \n4.2\n \n \n \n \nS239D/I332E\n \n \n-0.18\n \n0.66\n \n4.3\n \n \n \n \nS239D/A330Y/I332E\n \n \n-0.29\n \n0.51\n \n5.5\n \n \n \n \nS239D/S298A/I332E\n \n \n-0.52\n \n0.30\n \n9.4\n \n \n \n \nS239D/A330L/I332E\n \n \n-1.22\n \n0.06\n \n47.2\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\nExample 8. Complement binding and activation by Fc variants\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nComplement protein C1q binds to a site on Fc that is proximal to the FcγR binding site, and therefore it was prudent to determine whether the Fc variants have maintained their capacity to recruit and activate complement. The AlphaScreen™ assay was used to measure binding of select Fc variants to the complement protein C1q. The assay was carried out with biotinylated WT alemtuzumab antibody attached to streptavidin donor beads as described in Example 2, and using C1q coupled directly to acceptor beads. Binding data of select Fc variants shown in \nFigure 27a\n indicate that C1q binding is uncompromised. Cell-based CDC assays were also performed on select Fc variants to investigate whether Fc variants maintain the capacity to activate complement. Amar Blue was used to monitor lysis of Fc variant and WT rituximab-opsonized WIL2-S lymphoma cells by human serum complement (Quidel, San Diego, CA). The results shown in \nFigure 27b\n for select Fc variants indicate that CDC is uncompromised.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 9. Protein A binding by Fc variants\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAs discussed, bacterial protein A binds to the Fc region between the C□2 and C□3 domains, and is frequently employed for antibody purification. The AlphaScreen™ assay was used to measure binding of select Fc variants to the protein A using biotinylated WT alemtuzumab antibody attached to streptavidin donor beads as described in Example 2, and using protein A coupled directly to acceptor beads. The binding data shown in \nFigure 28\n for select Fc variants indicate that the capacity of the Fc variants to bind protein A is uncompromised. These results suggest that affinity of the Fc variants for other Fc ligands that bind the same site on Fc as protein A, such as the neonatal Fc receptor FcRn and protein G, are also unaffected.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 10. Capacity of Fc variants to bind mouse Fc□Rs\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nOptimization of Fc to nonhuman Fc□Rs may be useful for experimentally testing Fc variants in animal models. For example, when tested in mice (for example nude mice, SCID mice, xenograft mice, and/or transgenic mice), antibodies and Fc fusions that comprise Fc variants that are optimized for one or more mouse Fc□Rs may provide valuable information with regard to efficacy, mechanism of action, and the like. In order to evaluate whether the Fc variants of the present invention may be useful in such experiments, affinity of select Fc variants for mouse FcγRIII was measured using the AlphaScreen™ assay. The AlphaScreen™ assay was carried out using biotinylated WT alemtuzumab attached to streptavidin donor beads as described in Example 2, and GST-tagged mouse FcγRIII bound to glutathione chelate acceptor beads, expressed and purified as described in Example 2. These binding data are shown in \nFigure 29\n. Results show that some Fc variants that enhance binding to human FcγRIIIa also enhance binding to mouse FcγRIII. This result indicates that the Fc variants of the present invention, or other Fc variants that are optimized for nonhuman FcγRs, may find use in experiments that use animal models.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 11. Validation of Fc variants expressed in CHO cells\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nWhereas the Fc variants of the present invention were expressed in 293T cells for screening purposes, large scale production of antibodies is typically carried out by expression in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell lines. In order to evaluate the properties of CHO-expressed Fc variants, select Fc variants and WT alemtuzumab were expressed in CHO cells and purified as described in Example 2. \nFigure 30\n shows AlphaScreen™ data comparing binding of CHO- and 293T- expressed Fc variant and WT alemtuzumab to human V158 FcγRIIIa. The results indicate that the Fc variants of the present invention show comparable FcγR binding enhancements whether expressed in 293T or CHO.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 12. Therapeutic application of Fc variants\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA number of Fc variants described in the present invention have significant potential for improving the therapeutic efficacy of anticancer antibodies. For illustration purposes, a number of Fc variants of the present invention have been incorporated into the sequence of the antibody rituximab. The WT rituximab light chain and heavy chain, described in \n \nUS 5,736,137\n \n, are provided in \nFigures 31a\n and 32b. The improved anti-CD20 antibody sequences are provided in \nFigure 31c\n. The improved anti-CD20 antibody sequences comprise at least non-WT amino acid selected from the group consisting of X\n1\n, X\n2\n, X\n3\n, X\n4\n, X\n5\n, and X\n6\n. These improved anti-CD20 antibody sequences may also comprise a substitution Z\n1\n. The use of rituximab here is solely an example, and is not meant to constrain\n\napplication of the Fc variants to this antibody or any other particular antibody or Fc fusion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll references are herein expressly incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhereas particular embodiments of the invention have been described above for the purposes of illustration, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that numerous variations of the details may be made without departing from the invention as described in the claims.\n\nThe following numbered paragraphs (paras.) contain further statements of various aspects of the present invention:\n\n \n \n \n1.

Description\n\n\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to the use of a compound in the preparation of a medicament for treating an HIV-infected mammal, in combination with an antiviral agent selected from the group consisting of ritonavir, indinavir, and saquinavir.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe development of drug resistance is one of the most perplexing challenges in the field of medicine. One of the most common causes of drug failure in the treatment of diseases involving replicating biological entities, for example, cancer and infectious diseases, is the emergence of drug resistance. One of the most dramatic and tragic examples of drug resistance can be found in connection with the antiviral therapy of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAIDS is a fatal disease, reported cases of which have increased dramatically within the past several years. Estimates of reported cases in the very near future also continue to rise dramatically.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe AIDS virus was first identified in 1983. It has been known by several names and acronyms. It is the third known T-lymphocyte virus (HTLV-III), and it has the capacity to replicate within cells of the immune system, causing profound cell destruction. The AIDS virus is a retrovirus, a virus that uses reverse transcriptase during replication. This particular retrovirus is also known as lymphadenopathy-associated virus (LAV), AIDS-related virus (ARV) and, most recently, as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Two distinct families of HIV have been described to date, namely HIV-1 and HIV-2. The acronym HIV will be used herein to refer to HIV viruses generically.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecifically, HIV is known to exert a profound cytopathic effect on the CD4+ helper/inducer T-cells, thereby severely compromising the immune system. HIV infection also results in neurological deterioration and, ultimately, in the death of the infected individual.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe field of viral chemotherapeutics has developed in response to the need for agents effective against retroviruses, in particular HIV. For example anti-retroviral agents, such as 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (AZT), 2'3'-dideoxycytidine (ddC), and 2'3'-dideoxyinosine (ddI) are known to inhibit reverse transcriptase. There also exist antiviral agents that inhibit transactivator protein. Nucleoside analogs, such as AZT, are currently available for antiviral therapy. Although very useful, the utility of AZT and related compounds is limited by toxicity and insufficient therapeutic indices for fully adequate therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRetroviral protease inhibitors also have been identified as a class of anti-retroviral agents. Retroviral proteases processes polyprotein precursors into viral structural proteins and replicative enzymes. This processing is essential for the assembly and maturation of fully infectious virions. Accordingly, the design of protease inhibitors remains an important therapeutic goal in the treatment of AIDS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe use of HIV protease inhibitors, in combination with agents that have different antiretroviral mechanisms (e.g., AZT, ddI and ddT), also has been described. For example, synergism against HIV-1 has been observed between certain C\n2\n symmetric HIV inhibitors and AZT (\nKageyama et al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., 36, 926-933 (1992\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNumerous classes of potent peptidic inhibitors of protease have been designed using the natural cleavage site of the precursor polyproteins as a starting point. These inhibitors typically are peptide substrate analogs in which the scissile P\n1\n-P\n1\n' amide bond has been replaced by a non-hydrolyzable isostere with tetrahedral geometry (\nMoore et al, Perspect. Drug Dis. Design, 1, 85 (1993\n); \nTomasselli et al., Int. J. Chem. Biotechnology, 6 (1991\n); \nHuff, J. Med. Chem., 34, 2305 (1991\n) ; \nNorbeck et al., Ann. Reports Med. Chem., 26, 141 (1991\n); and \nMeek, J. Enzyme Inhibition, 6, 65 (1992\n)). Although these inhibitors are effective in preventing the retroviral protease from functioning, the inhibitors suffer from some distinct disadvantages. Generally, peptidomimetics often make poor drugs, due to their potential adverse pharmacological properties, i.e., poor oral absorption, poor stability and rapid metabolism (\nPlattner et al, Drug Discovery Technologies, Clark et al., eds., Ellish Horwood, Chichester, England (1990\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe design of the HIV-1 protease inhibitors based on the transition state mimetic concept has led to the generation of a variety of peptide analogs highly active against viral replication \nin vitro\n (\nErickson et al, Science, 249, 527-533 (1990\n); \nKramer et al., Science, 231, 1580-1584 (1986\n); \nMcQuade et al., Science, 247, 454-456 (1990\n); \nMeek et al., Nature (London), 343, 90-92 (1990\n); and \nRoberts et al., Science, 248, 358-361 (1990\n)). These active agents contain a non-hydrolyzable, dipeptidic isostere, such as hydroxyethylene (McQuade et al., supra; \nMeek et al., Nature (London), 343, 90-92 (1990\n); and \nVacca et al., J. Med. Chem., 34, 1225-1228 (1991\n)) or hydroxyethylamine (\nGhosh et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 8, 687-690 (1998\n); \nGhoah et al., J. Med. Chem., 36, 292-295 (1993\n)); \nRich et al., J. Med. Chem., 33, 1285-1288 (1990\n); and \nRoberts et al., Science, 248, 358-361 (1990\n)) as an active moiety that mimics the putative transition state of the aspartic protease-catalyzed reaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo-fold (C\n2\n) symmetric inhibitors of HIV protease represent another class of potent HIV protease inhibitors, which were created by Erickson et al., on the basis of the three-dimensional symmetry of the enzyme active site (Erickson et al. (1990), \nsupra).\n Typically, however, the usefulness of currently available HIV protease inhibitors in the treatment of AIDS has been limited by relatively short plasma half-life, poor oral bioavailability, and the technical difficulty of scale-up synthesis (Meek et al. (1992), supra).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a continuing effort to address the problem of short plasma half-life and poor bioavailability, new HIV protease inhibitors have been identified. For example, HIV protease inhibitors incorporating the 2,5-diamino-3,4-disubstituted-1,6-diphenylhexane isostere are described in \nGhosh et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 8, 687-690 (1998\n) and \n \nU.S. Patent Nos. 5,728,718 (Randad et al.\n \n). HIV protease inhibitors, which incorporate the hydroxyethylamine isostere, are described in \n \nU.S. Patent Nos. 5,502,060 (Thompson et al.\n \n), \n \n5,703,076 (Talley et al.\n \n), and \n \n5,475,027 (Talley et al.\n \n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecent studies, however, have revealed the emergence of mutant strains of HIV, in which the protease is resistant to the C\n2\n symmetric inhibitors (\nOtto et al., PNAS USA, 90, 7543 (1993\n) ; \nHo et al., J. Virology, 68, 2016-2020 (1994\n); and \nKaplan et al., PNAS USA, 91, 5597-5601 (1994\n)). In one study, the most abundant mutation found in response to a C\n2\n symmetry based inhibitor was Arg to Gln at position 8 (R8Q), which strongly affects the S\n3\n/S\n3\n, subsite of the protease binding domain. In this study, the shortening of the P\n3\n/P\n3\n, residues resulted in inhibitors that were equipotent towards both wild-type and R8Q mutant proteases (\nMajer et al., 13th American Peptide Symposium, Edmonton, Canada (1993\n)). Inhibitors have been truncated to P\n2\n/P\n2\n, without significant loss of activity (\nLyle et al., J. Med. Chem., 34, 1230 (1991\n); and \nBone et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 113, 9382 (1991\n)). These results suggest that inhibitors can be truncated and yet maintain the crucial interaction necessary for strong binding. The benefits of such an approach include the elimination of two or more peptide bonds, the reduction of molecular weight, and the diminishment of the potential for recognition by degradative enzymes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore recently, new mutant strains of HIV have emerged that are resistant to multiple, structurally diverse, experimental and chemotherapeutic retroviral protease inhibitors, Such multidrug-resistant HIV strains are typically found in infected patients, who had undergone treatment with a combination of HIV protease inhibitors or a series of different HIV protease inhibitors. The number of reported cases of patients infected with multidrug-resistant HIV is rising dramatically. Tragically for these patients, the available options for AIDS chemotherapy and/or HIV management is severely limited or is, otherwise, completely nonexistent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDrug resistance is unfortunately the most common reason for drug failures generally. One of the most dramatic examples of drug failure due to resistance is in HIV therapy. Once HIV resistance is obtained to first-line therapy, the chances of future success are greatly diminished because of the development of multidrug cross resistance. Other diseases involving infectious agents (e.g., viruses, bacteria, protozoa, and prions) or other disease-causing cells (e.g., tumor cells) present similar challenges in that drug resistance is a primary cause of drug failure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn view of the foregoing problems, there exists a need to determine whether a mutant will be capable of replicating in the presence of a drug. There also exists a need for a method of predicting whether drug resistance is likely to emerge in a disease involving a replicating biological entity. There is also a need for a method of devising a long-term therapeutic regimen that minimize the likelihood that resistance will occur in a disease involving a replicating biological entity. Moreover, there is a need for a method of preventing or inhibiting the development of drug resistance in such diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides such methods.

The \"vitality\" of a biochemical target of a mutant replicating biological entity relative to the \"vitality\" of its predecessor's biochemical target is defined herein as the \"biochemical fitness.\"\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Vitality\" as utilized herein describes the ability of a particular biomolecular \"target\" (i.e., a biochemical species intended to be inhibited by a particular inhibitor) to perform its biochemical function in the presence of the inhibitor. Biochemical vitality is a function of at least two variables: the ability of a particular inhibitor to inhibit a biochemical target of the replicating biological entity in question, and the ability of the cell's biochemical target to inherently perform its biochemical function (irrespective of an inhibitor). Biochemical vitality also can include other factors that effect the ability of a biochemical target to perform its biochemical function in the presence of the inhibitor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe biochemical target in question can include, for example, a biochemical species with one or more known or unknown biological functions. The biochemical target can be, for example, a biochemical species having one or more specific biochemical function, or it can be a biochemical species that effects or influences a biochemical function directly or indirectly. Suitable biochemical targets include, for example, enzymes, proteins, oligomers, receptors, and the like. Suitable enzymes include, for example, reverse transcriptases, proteases (e.g., retroviral proteases, plasmepsins, and the like), methylases, oxidases, esterases, acyl transferases, and the like. Suitable enzymes also include, for example, viral and non-viral helicases, topoisomerases, DNA gyrases, DNA and RNA polymerases, parasite-encoded proteases, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable proteins include, for example, proteins that incorporate a conformational change as a major functional requirement, and the like. Examples of such proteins include HIV gp41 and other fusogenic viral proteins and peptides, topoisomerases, and all DNA enzymes, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable oligomers include, for example, oligomers that require oligomerization in order to perform their biochemical function. Examples of such oligomers include HIV protease, retroviral fusion proteins, peptides, HIV gp 41, viral and non-viral membrane fusion proteins, tumor suppressor proteins (e.g., p53, and the like) prions, ribosomes, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ability of a particular inhibitor to inhibit a biochemical target of a particular replicating biological entity can be determined by any suitable method and/or can be obtained from any suitable source. The ability of a particular inhibitor to inhibit a biochemical function of a replicating biological entity can be determined, for example, on the basis of a measurable property, or a measurable relationship of properties, that correlate with the ability of the inhibitor to inhibit the target. Suitable methods for determining the ability of the inhibitor to inhibit the target include, for example, assays, and the like. In some instances, the ability of the inhibitor to inhibit the target can be obtained from one or more suitable sources, for example, assay data from a database, a textbook, or the literature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the biochemical target is a protein, the ability of an inhibitor to inhibit the protein can be determined, for example, by obtaining the equilibrium dissociation constant (K\nd\n) of drug binding to the target where drug binding interferes with the function of the protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the biochemical target is an enzyme, the ability of an inhibitor to inhibit the enzyme can be determined, for example, by obtaining the inhibition constant (K\ninh\n), or the like. The inhibition constant can be in terms of drug inhibition constant for the effect of the drug on substrate catalysis (e.g., K\n1\n) or dissociation constant for drug binding (e.g., K\nd\n) where drug binding correlates with inhibition of enzyme function.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the biochemical target is an oligomer, the ability of an inhibitor to inhibit the oligomer can be determined, for example, by obtaining the equilibrium dissociation constant (K\nd\n) for drug binding where drug binding interferes with oligomerization of the target.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere the biochemical target is a protein that requires a conformational change for its function, use ability of an inhibitor two inhibit the conformational change can be determined, for example, by obtaining the equilibrium dissociation constant (K\nd\n) for drug binding where drug binding interferes with the conformational change of the target.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the biochemical target is a protein that is required to bind to a ligand, macromolecule, or macromolecular complex to perform its biochemical function, the ability of an inhibitor to inhibit the protein function can be determined by obtaining the equilibrium dissociation constant (K\nd\n) four drug binding where drug binding interferes with ligand binding, macromolecule binding, or macromolecular complex binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the biochemical target is a nucleic acid binding protein, the ability of an inhibitor to inhibit the nucleic acid binding protein's function can be determined by obtaining the equilibrium dissociation constant (K\nd\n) for drug binding where drug binding interferes with nucleic acid binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVitality also is a function of the biochemical target's ability to inherently perform its biochemical function (irrespective of an inhibitor). The biochemical target's ability to inherently perform its biochemical function can be determined by any suitable method and/or can be obtained from any suitable source. The biochemical target's ability to inherently perform its biochemical function can be determined, for example, on the basis of a measurable property, or measurable relationship of properties, that correlates with the ability of the biochemical target's ability to inherently perform its biochemical function. Suitable methods for determining the biochemical target's ability to inherently perform its biochemical function include, for example, biochemical assays, and the like. In some instances, the ability of a cell's biochemical target to inherently perform its biochemical function can be obtained from one or more suitable sources, for example, assay data from a database, a textbook, or the literature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the biochemical target is an enzyme, the ability of the enzyme to inherently perform its biochemical function can be determined, for example, by determining the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. For example, the catalytic efficiency for enzymes that exhibit Michaelis-Menten kinetics can be determined by obtaining the k\ncat\n/K\nM\n ratio, or by a similar method, wherein k\ncat\n is the catalytic rate and K\nM\n is the Michaelis constant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the biochemical target is a protein, the ability of the protein to inherently perform its biochemical function can be determined, for example, by obtaining the equilibrium constant (K\neq\n) for the biochemical function of the protein, or the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the biochemical target is an oligomer, the ability of an inhibitor to perform its biological function can be determined, for example, by obtaining the equilibrium constant (K\neq\n) that is associated with oligomerization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere the biochemical target is a protein that requires a conformational change for its function, the ability of the target to perform its function can be determined, for example, by obtaining the equilibrium constant (K\neq\n) associated with conformational change.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the biochemical target is a protein that is required to bind to a ligand to perform its function, the ability of the target to perform its function can be determined, for example, by obtaining the equilibrium dissociation constant (K\nd\n) for ligand binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the biochemical target is a nucleic acid binding protein, the ability of an inhibitor to perform its function can be determined by obtaining the equilibrium dissociation constant (K\nd\n) for nucleic acid binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be appreciated that vitality also can be a function of other factors that effect the ability of a biochemical target to perform its biochemical function in the presence of the inhibitor. If the biochemical target is a dimeric species, for example, other factors that influence biochemical vitality might include the ability of the species to dimerize in the presence and/or in the absence of the inhibitor. If, by way of example, a mutation causes the dimerization rate to become a factor in the biochemical function of the biochemical target of the mutant relative to its predecessor's, then dimerization rate can be included in the vitality determination.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe biochemical vitalities of a mutant replicating biological entity and its predecessor, when compared, describes the biochemical fitness of the target of the mutant cell. It has been found that the biochemical fitness relates to the biological fitness of the mutant in the presence of the inhibitor. When the value for the biochemical vitality of the target of the mutant exceeds the value for the biochemical vitality of the target of a predecessor of the mutant, the target of the mutant has greater biochemical fitness in the presence of the inhibitor. In such cases, the mutant replicating biological entity is favored over the predecessor and resistance to the inhibitor that is used to treat the predecessor is likely to develop.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBiochemical vitality can be determined in many different ways that suitably relate the various factors relating to the biochemical vitality of the target. For example, a mathematical function may be used to relate the various factors. By way of illustration, when the biochemical target is an enzyme, the vitality can be determined as a function of K\ninh\n (e.g., K\ni\n or K\nd\n) and enzymatic or catalytic efficiency (e.g., K\ncat\n/K\nM\n). Vitality can be determined as the product of K\ninh\n and enzymatic efficiency, for example, (K\ninh\n) x (catalytic efficiency), or (K\ni\n) x (catalytic efficiency) or (K\nd\n) (catalytic efficiency). Alternatively, vitality can be determined, for example, as the log of the product of K\ninh\n and enzymatic efficiency, for example, log [(K\ninh\n) x (catalytic efficiency)], or log [(K\ni\n) x (catalytic efficiency)] or log [(K\nd\n) x (catalytic efficiency)]. Similarly, for enzymes that exhibit Michaelis-Menten kinetics, vitality can be determined as a function of K\ninh\n (e.g., K\ni\n or K\nd\n) and the k\ncat\n/K\nM\n ratio. For example, vitality can be determined as the product of K\ninh\n and k\ncat\n/K\nM\n, e.g., (K\ninh\n) x (k\ncat\n/K\nM\n), wherein K\ninh\n is K\ni\n or K\nd\n. Alternatively, vitality can be determined, for example, as the log of the product of K\ninh\n and k\ncat\n/K\nM\n, e.g., log [(K\ninh\n) x (K\ncat\n/K\nM\n)], wherein K\ninh\n is K\ni\n or K\nd\n. In a preferred embodiment, the biochemical targets is an enzyme and the vitality is (K\ni\n) x (k\ncat\n/K\nM\n), or log [(K\ni\n) x (k\ncat\n/K\nM\n)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Fitness,\" unless otherwise indicated, means biochemical fitness. \"Biochemical fitness\" as utilized herein is a value that represents the vitality of a biochemical target of a mutant replicating biological entity relative to the vitality the biochemical target of its predecessor. Biochemical fitness is determined by comparing the vitality of a biochemical target of a mutant replicating biological entity relative to that of its predecessor. Any suitable comparison of the vitality of a biochemical target of a mutant replicating biological entity relative to that of its predecessor can be used in the determination of fitness. For example, biochemical fitness can be determined as the difference between the biochemical vitality of a biochemical targets of a predecessor (biochemical vitality\npred\n) and the biochemical vitality of the biochemical target of a particular mutant replicating biological entity that can evolve from the predecessor (biochemical vitality\nmut\n), e.g., (biochemical vitality\nmut\n) - (biochemical vitality\npred\n). If biochemical fitness is determined on the basis of this difference, then a positive value indicates that the mutant has a higher fitness relative to its predecessor in the presence of the inhibitor, whereas a negative value indicates that the mutant is less fit relative to its predecessor. A value of zero indicates that the fitness of the mutant and the predecessor ace equal. A higher positive value indicates a greater chance that resistance to the inhibitor will emerge, whereas a higher negative value indicates a lower chance that resistance to the inhibitor will emerge.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, and preferably, fitness can be determined as the quotient of two biochemical vitalities, for example, as the quotient of a biochemical targets of a particular mutant replicating biological entity and the biochemical vitality of the biochemical target of a predecessor, e.g., \n \n \nfitness\n \n=\n \n \n \nvitality\n \nmut\n \n \n \nvitality\n \npred\n \n \n \n.\n \n \n \n If fitness is determined on the basis of this quotient, then a value greater than one indicates that the mutant has a higher fitness relative to its predecessor, in the presence of the inhibitor. A value of one indicates that the fitness of the mutant and the predecessor are equal. A value less than one indicates that the mutant is less fit relative to its predecessor. A higher value indicates a greater chance that resistance to the inhibitor/drug will emerge, whereas a lower value indicates a lower chance that resistance to the inhibitor/drug will emerge. A value less than one indicates that the mutant will not emerge in the presence of the inhibitor/drug.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, fitness can be determined as the log of the quotient of two biochemical vitalities, for example, as the log of the quotient of a biochemical target of a particular mutant replicating biological entity and the biochemical vitality of the biochemical target of a predecessor, e.g., \n \n \nfitness\n \n=\n \nlog\n \n \n \n \nvitality\n \nmut\n \n \n \nvitality\n \npred\n \n \n \n \n.\n \n \n \n If fitness is determined on the basis of this log, then a value greater than zero indicates that the mutant has a higher fitness relative to its predecessor, in the presence of the inhibitor. A negative value indicates that the mutant is less fit relative to its predecessor. A value of zero indicates that the fitness of the mutant and the predecessor are equal. A higher positive value indicates a greater chance that resistance to the inhibitor/drug will emerge, whereas a lower positive value indicates a lower chance that resistance to the inhibitor/drug will emerge. A negative value indicates that the mutant will not emerge in the presence of the inhibitor/drug.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFitness can be determined in the presence of any suitable compound that inhibits a biochemical target from performing its biological function. The inhibitor, for example, can be a compound that inhibits an enzyme. Suitable enzyme inhibitors include, for example, protease inhibitors, reverse transcriptase inhibitors, DNA polymerase inhibitors, methylase inhibitors, oxidase inhibitors, esterase inhibitors, acyl transferase inhibitors, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable protease inhibitors include, for example, viral protease inhibitors, plasmepsin inhibitors, and cathepsin D inhibitors. In a preferred embodiment, the inhibitor is a viral protease inhibitor, more preferably a retroviral protease inhibitor, still more preferably an HIV-1 or an HIV-2 protease inhibitor, and most preferably and HIV-1 protease inhibitor. Exemplary HIV-1 protease inhibitors include, for example, saquinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir, and HIV-1 protease inhibitors that are undergoing clinical trials, e.g., tipranavir (PNU-140690).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable plasmepsin inhibitors include, for example, inhibitors of plasmepsin I or II, including inhibitors of plasmepsin I or II that have antimalarial activity. Suitable inhibitors of cathepsin D include, for example, cathepsin D inhibitors that inhibit cathepsin D in primary breast cancer tissues, including cathepsin D inhibitors that inhibit cathepsin D in primary breast cancer tissues and would be expected to lower the risk of metastasis and/or shorter relapse-free survival in breast cancer patients. \nSee, e.g.,\n \nGulnik et al., J. Mol. Biol., 227, 265-270 (1992\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable reverse transcriptase inhibitors include, for example, retroviral reverse transcriptase inhibitors, e.g., AZT, 3TC, ddI, ddC, D4T, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable protein inhibitors include, for example, compounds that inhibit a conformational change in a protein, and the like. Suitable oligomerization inhibitors include, for example, T-20 peptide inhibitor of HIV-1 fusion and other compounds that inhibit oligomers from oligomerizing on a cell surface or within a cell membrane.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFitness in the presence of an inhibitor can be determined for a biological entity that produces or includes a biological target of the inhibitor. The biological entity is preferably a replicating biological entity, for example, a virus, a parasite, or a cell, preferably a disease-causing cell. Disease-causing replicating biological entities include, for example, tumor cells, cancer cells, and infectious organisms (e.g., fungi, protozoa, bacteria, and the like) and prions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCancer cells include, for example, cells associated with breast cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer, and the like. Fitness can be determined for a rapidly growing tumor cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFungi include, for example, candida albicans, and the like. Protozoa include, for example, trypanosome species, schistosomial species, malarial protozoa, e.g., Plasmodium species. Plasmodium species include, for example, Plasmodium Falciparum, Plasmodium ovale, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae, and the like. Bacteria include, for example, Helicobacter pylori; Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureas, Bacillus anthrax, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Hemophilus influenza, and the like. Viruses include, for example, retroviruses (e.g., HIV-1 and HIV-2), herpes viruses, cytomegaloviruses, influenza viruses, epstein-barr virus (EBV), Kaposi's sarcoma herpes virus (KSHV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), human papillomavirus (HPV), euhovirus, picornaviruses, rhinoviruses, poliovirus, coxsackie virus, meaeles, mumps, human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV-1), rubella, rotaviruses, yellow fever virus, ebola virus, and other pathogenic viruses, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReplicating biological entities also include multicellular organisms, for example, infectious microorganisms, e.g., helminths. Helminths include, for example, hookworms (e.g., ancylostoma duodenale) strongyloides stercoralis, fasciola hepatica, trichuris trichiura, trichinella spiralis, taenia solium, taenia saginata, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is believed that drug resistance is the evolutionary result of fitness-based selection of mutant cells/microorganisms in the presence of a drug (or any compound that has biological activity). The emergence (or non-emergence) of drug resistance in a disease caused by a disease-causing replicating biological entity can be predicted by determining the fitness of a biochemical target of a mutant in the presence of the drug. Thus, the emergence (or non-emergence) of drug resistance can be predicted on the basis of biochemical fitness.

Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include, for example, aqueous and nonaqueous, isotonic sterile injection solutions, which can contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostates, and solutes that render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient, and aqueous and nonaqueous sterile suspensions that can include suspending agents, solubilizers, thickening agents, stabilisers, and preservatives. The sterile injectable preparation can be a solution or a suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in water or 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that can be employed, for example, are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides.

Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions can be prepared from sterile powders, granules, and tablets of the kind previously described.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny suitable dosage level can be employed in the pharmaceutical compositions. The dose administered to an animal, particularly a human, in the context of the present invention should be sufficient to effect a prophylactic or therapeutic response in the animal over a reasonable time frame. The amount of active ingredient that can be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. The size of the dose also will be determined by the existence, nature, and extent of any adverse side-effects that might accompany the administration of a particular composition. Suitable doses and dosage regimens for the prevention of drug resistance can be determined by comparisons to antiretroviral chemotherapeutic agents that are known to inhibit the proliferation of a retrovirus in an infected individual. The preferred dosage is the amount that results in the inhibition of the emergence of mutant drug-resistant retroviruses, particularly the emergence of multidrug-resistant retroviral HIV, without significant side effects. In proper doses and with suitable administration of certain compounds, a wide range of antiretroviral chemotherapeutic compositions are possible. A suitable dose includes a dose or dosage which would be insufficient to completely suppress the growth of a wild-type or predecessor virus, but would be sufficient to inhibit or effectively suppress the growth of a mutant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe individual daily dosages for combinations with an antiviral agent selected from the group consisting of titonavir, indinavir and saquinavir can range from about one-fifth of the minimally recommended clinical dosages to the maximum recommended levels for the entities when they are given singly.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA method of preventing the emergence of multidrug-resistant retroviruses in an HIV-infected mammal may be provided which method comprises administering to the mammal a multidrug resistance-inhibiting effective amount of a compound of the present invention, so as to inhibit the emergence of a multidrug-resistant retrovirus in the mammal. The dose administered to an animal, particularly a human in the context of the present invention, should be sufficient to effect a therapeutic response in the animal over a reasonable time frame. The dose will be determined by the strength of the particular composition employed and the condition of the animal, as well as the body weight of the animal to be treated. The size of the dose will also be determined by the existence, mature, and extent of any adverse side-effects that might accompany the administration of a particular compound. Other factors which effect the specific dosage include, for example, bioavailability, metabolic profile, and the pharmacodynamics associated with the particular compound to be administered in a particular patient. One skilled in the art will recognize that the specific dosage level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including, for example, the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, CD4 count, the potency of the active compound with respect to the particular mutant retroviral strain to be inhibited, and the severity of the symptoms presented prior to or during the course of therapy. What constitutes a resistance-inhibiting effective amount can be determined, in part, by use of one or more of the assays described herein, particularly the fitness assay of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne skilled in the art will appreciated that suitable methods of administering compounds and pharmaceutical compositions are available, and, although more than one route can be used to administer a particular composition, a particular route can provide a more immediate and/or more effective reaction than another route.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNumerous compounds have been identified that exhibit potent antiretrovisal activity, in particular retroviral protease activity, against wild-type HIV. However, among the fifteen currently FDA-approved antiretroviral agents which are all known potent inhibitors of wild-type HIV, five of which are potent inhibitors of wild-type HIV protease, none of these compounds have the ability to prevent the emergence of drug-resistance mutations that are associated with high level cross resistance. Thus, these inhibitors do not have the ability to suppress the sufficiently fit mutant retroviruses that can (and almost certainly will) emerge under the selection pressure of these inhibitors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSurprisingly, it has been discovered that compound 32 (shown in \nFigure 3A\n), which is a potent wild-type HIV inhibitors, possesses remarkably potent and unprecedented broad-spectrum inhibitory activity against a panel of recombinant mutant HIV protease targets. These enzymes represent the key or primary resistance mutations, most of which occur in the active site region. Based on this finding, the compound was tested against a panel of drug resistant mutant patient isolates of HIV and was found to possess broad spectrum antiviral activity against a wide range of clinically isolated, multiply drug-resistant, human immunodeficiency viruses. Other compounds described herein showed similar activity. The mutant viruses were obtained from infected humans who had received several antiviral drugs. Although applicants do not wish to abound by any one particular theory, it is believed that the combination of the bicyclic ligand (vii) with isostere (vi) gives the antiretroviral compounds of the present invention the unique ability to bind to the active site of the mutant proteases of multiply drug-resistant human immunodeficiency viruses generally, which trait has heretofore not been reported with respect to any known chemotherapeutic and/or experimental HIV protease inhibitor. A wild-type preliminary screen was utilized to determine the antiretroviral activity of analogs against wild-type HIV. It is predicted that compounds of Formula (I), which have potent antiretroviral or protease-inhibitory activity against wild-type HIV, also will be potent inhibitors of drug-resistance, even multiple drug-resistance, in wild-type HIV, or even a mutant thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe resistance-inhibiting compounds of the present invention can be synthesized by any suitable method known in the art. The preferred synthesis method is generally illustrated in \nFigure 4\n, which is an representation of the synthetic approach to preparing a preferred series of compounds, wherein a compound of Formula (I) is synthesized in several steps starting from azidoepoxide (i), wherein R\n1\n-R\n17\n, m, n, p, Q, W, X, y, and z are defined as above. Referring to \nFigure 4\n, amine (ii) is nucheophilically added to azidoepoxide (i), providing aminoalcohol (iii). The amine functional group of aminoalcohol (iii) is then reacted with intermediate (iv), wherein L represents a Leaving group (e.g., halogen, N-oxysuccinimide), which can be displaced by the amine of aminoalcohol (iii), to provide azide (v). Reduction of azide (v), or, when R\n5\n is not hydrogen, reductive amination with aldehyde R\n5\nCH=O, provides intermediate (vi), which is subsequently coupled with activated bicyclic ligand (vii), to provide -compounds of Formula I. Of course, it will be appreciated by a person of ordinary skill in the art that there are combinations of substituents, functional groups, R-groups, and the like, which are reactive under particular reaction conditions, and require the utilization of an appropriate protecting group or groups, which are known in the art, to ensure that the desired synthetic transformation will take place without the occurrence of undesired side reactions. For example, possible substituents at R\n5\n (e.g., NH\n2\n) can be competitive nucleophiles requiring the attachment of an appropriate protecting group thereon (e.g., benzyloxycarbonyl, tert-butoxycarbonyl) in order obtain proper selectivity in the ring opening of epoxide (i) with amine (ii).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigures 1-3B\n illustrate the synthesis of a preferred series of compounds for use in the method of preventing the emergence of resistance in accordance with the present invention. \nFigure 1\n, which is a synthetic scheme for the synthesis of a particular sulfonamide, illustrates the synthesis of a preferred isosteric core, particularly, the sulfonamide isosteric core represented by \naminosulfonamide\n 15. With reference to \nFigure 1\n, \naminosulfonamide core\n 15 can be synthesized by initially providing \nazidoepoxide\n 11 and subjecting it to nucleophilic addition with \namine\n 12 to give \naminoalcohol\n 13, which is subsequently converted to \nsulfonamide\n 14 by reaction with 4-methoxybenzenesulfonyl chloride. The azide group of 14 is then reduced to provide \naminosulfonamide\n 15, which can be used as a core for synthesizing numerous multidrug-resistant retroviral protease inhibitors of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2\n, which is a reaction scheme detailing the preparation of bicyclic alcohols, illustrates the synthesis of a preferred series of bicyclic ligands, particularly bis-tetrahydrofurans 25 and 26. With reference to \nFigures 2\n, \ndihydrofuran\n 21 is treated with N-iodosuccinimide in the presence of propargyl alcohol to give \niodoether\n 22, which is cyclized to methylene-substituted bis-\ntetrahydrofuran\n 23. Ozonolysis of the exo-methylene residue of 23, followed by reduction, provides bicyclic \nracemic alcohol\n 24, which is resolved to give, separately, \nbicyclic alcohol\n 25 and its \nenantiomeric acetate ester\n 26, which ester group of 26 is subsequently hydrolyzed to afford \nenantiomer\n 27.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigures 3A and 3B\n, which are reaction schemes describing the preparation of two protease inhibitors, illustrate the preparation of two preferred multidrug-resistant HIV protease inhibitors of the present invention.

Based on this fitness profile, it is believed that drug resistant viruses containing the characteristic mutations assayed herein will not emerge from the wild-type in the presence of \ncompound\n 32.\n\n\n \nExample 14\n\n\n \n \n \nThis example illustrates the potent and broad-spectrum multidrug-resistant antiretroviral activity of an exemplary compound of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nCompound\n 32, shown in \nFigure 3A\n, was tested side-by-side with four other known HIV-1 protease inhibitors against various wild-type HIV-1 strains (HIV-1\nBRS104pre\n, HIV-1\nLAI\n, and HIV-1\nBAL\n), and mutant multidrug-resistant HIV-1 strains clinically isolated from eight different patients who had received numerous antiviral drugs, either singly or in combination.

For example, compound 32 exhibits nanomolar and sub-nanomolar potency against all the multidrug-resistant strains tested, whereas Ritonavir, a reasonably potent wild-type inhibitor, is virtually inactive toward the resistant viruses. Moreover, \ncompound\n 32 is about 9 to about 150 times more potent against the multidrug-resistant viruses than Saquinavir, one of the most potent known compounds against known multidrug-resistant strains of HIV-1. Patients with viral plasma loads greater than 10,000 RNA copies/mm\n3\n are at risk for developing fatal AIDS complications. There are no effective therapeutic options currently available for these patients infected with these multidrug resistant viruses. \nCompound\n 32 and analogs thereof are predicted to be potent in preventing the selection of these viral strains in vivo.\n\n\n \nExample 15\n\n\n \n \n \nThis example demonstrates the wild-type antiretroviral activity of the compounds of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is predicted that the activity of the present inventive compounds against wild-type HIV protease correlates with of antiretroviral activity against multidrug-resistant HIV.

The plasma blood levels of \ncompound\n 32 were measured over a 24 h period after oral administration.

Although applicants do not wish to abound by any one particular theory, it is believed that the non-peptide structure of the compounds of the present invention make them less prone to biological (e.g., enzymatic) degradation, and thereby contribute to their prolonged blood levels after oral administration. From these data, the compounds of the prevent invention are predicted to have excellent oral bioavailability in humans, and maintain therapeutically significant blood levels over prolonged periods after oral administration.\n\n\n \nExample 17\n\n\n \n \n \nThis example demonstrates the influence of human protein binding on the antiviral activity of \ncompound\n 32. Several potent and orally bioavailable HIV protease inhibitors failed to have in vivo antiviral efficacy. These failures have been ascribed, but not definitively proven, to be due to excessive binding to human plasma proteins, particularly serum albumin and AAG. The protein binding against human alpha acid glycoprotein (AAG, 10 µM) and against human serum albumin (HAS, 300 µM) were compared for \ncompound\n 32 and amprenavir, a structurally related analog that is an FDA approved drug. The results are shown in Table 6.\n\n \nTable 6\n \n \n \n \n \n \nIC\n50\n (µM)\n \n \n \nCompound\n \n(-)\n \n \nAAG\n \n \nAlb\n \n \n \n \n \n \n32\n \n0.0015.(1X)\n \n0.0022 (1.5X)\n \n0.003 (2X)\n \n \n \namprenavir\n \n0.029 (1X)\n \n0.18 (6X)\n \n0.021 (1X)\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese data demonstrate that the presence of AAG and HAS in physiologically excessive amounts does not adversely affect the antiviral activity of \ncompound\n 32. From these data, the affinity of \ncompound\n 32 for human AAG and HSA is predicted to be actually lower than that for amprenavir, a known drug. From these data, the compounds of the present invention are expected to have excellent in vivo efficacy in humans, and maintain therapeutically significant levels over prolonged periods of time.\n\n\n \nExample 18\n\n\n \n \n \nThis example describe the inhibitory activity of compounds 35 (\nFig. 5A\n), 36 (Fig. SB), 37 (\nFig. 5C\n) and 38 (\nFig. 5D\n).

other well-known inhibitors. These mutant viruses represent a panel of the most broadly cross resistant clinical isolates known to date based on their resistance to therapeutically used HIV protease inhibitors. \nCompound\n 32 was consistently potent against all of the clinically isolated mutant viruses tested, and was significantly more potent against these multidrug resistant viruses than the comparative drugs which are currently used in human HIV-1 therapy. \nCompound\n 32 was ten to one-thousand times more potent against these viruses than even saquinavir, one of the most potent known compounds against multidrug-resistant HIV-1. Based on the high potency, it is believed that these mutants will not only be inhibited, but also that these mutants would not be able to emerge if the compound is administered to a patient infected with a predecessor virus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile this invention has been described with an emphasis upon preferred embodiments, it will be obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art that variations of the preferred embodiments may be used and that it is intended that the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein. Accordingly, this invention includes all modifications as defined by the following claims."
