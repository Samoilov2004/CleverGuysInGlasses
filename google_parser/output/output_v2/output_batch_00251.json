Description\n\n\n\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\nThis application is a continuation of International Application No. PCT/US2005/014487 filed on Apr. 27, 2005 which is incorporated herein by reference in its' entirety which also claims the benefit of priority of U.S. Provisional Appln. No. 60/566,557 filed on Apr. 29, 2004.\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThis invention relates generally to compounds and compositions for the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) disorders such as schizophrenia, Parkinsons' Disease, addiction, depression and the like. More specifically, the present invention relates to novel compounds which are selective dopamine agonists which turn on or enhance adenylate cyclase-linked receptors. These compounds are useful for treating the aforementioned disorders characterized by abnormal dopamine levels.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nDopamine is an ubiquitous neurotransmitter found in the central nervous system (CNS) as well as in the peripheral nervous system of mammals. In the CNS, it is involved with motor function, perception, cognition, attention, arousal, motivation and emotion. In the peripheral nervous system, it is involved, for example, in the control of blood to the kidneys and in autonomic ganglion transmission.\n\n\nIt is now generally recognized that dopamine receptors in the CNS exist as five different receptors, designated as D1 through D5. Additionally, they are further classified as to whether they fall into the D1-like or D2-like family of receptors based upon their pharmacological differences. Accordingly, D1 and D5 are considered part of the D1 family of receptors, whereas D2, D3 and D4 are considered part of the D2 family.\n\n\nDopamine imbalance is believed to play a key role in a number of CNS-related disorders such as schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, drug abuse, eating disorders and depression.\n\n\nD1 receptors are positively linked to adenylate cyclase and are found in all areas of the human brain, with the frontal cortex and the substantia nigra pars compact a particularly rich with D1 receptors. D1 receptors are also found in the periphery, and have been identified in kidney and heart tissue. As such, disease states attributed to aberrations of the dopamine neuronal network could possibly be treated by drugs, which are selective for the D1 receptor. And, of particular interest are a class of drugs that would act as selective agonists at D1 receptors.\n\n\nFor instance D1 selective agonists have shown utility in treating Parkinson's disease. The loss of striatal dopamine within the basal ganglia, the region of the mammalian brain that is involved with motor control, has been established as the fundamental deficit in Parkinson's disease and primary to the etiology of that disease state. This deficiency is addressed via dopamine replacement therapy, primarily with L-DOPA (3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine), which is converted to dopamine within the brain. Other compounds that act as agonists at the dopamine receptor have also been used to treat Parkinson's disease. Bromocriptine, the most widely used direct-acting dopamine agonist for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, is often administered with L-DOPA in order to lower dosages of the latter required to achieve the desired therapeutic response. Bromocriptine alone has been shown to relieve Parkinson's disease symptoms in some early Parkinson's disease patients, allowing for a delay in the onset of L-DOPA therapy. Chronic L-DOPA use is associated with a number of serious side effects and limitations, such as the development of dyskinesias, severe response fluctuations (on-off phenomenon) and diminishing efficacy during treatment.\n\n\nAnti-schizophrenic drugs are postulated to exert their effects by blocking the dopamine receptors (i.e., acting as receptor antagonists), and consequently preventing excess receptor stimulation (G. P. Reynolds, TIPS, 13:116-121, 1992). However, these antipsychotic agents frequently produce undesirable side effects, the most common of which are the extrapyramidal effects that include bizarre involuntary movements and Parkinson-like states, as well as sedation and hypotension. Because of these often-severe side effects and the high incidence of patients unresponsive to dopamine blocking drugs, novel and improved therapies continue to be sought.\n\n\nOne complement to dopamine receptor antagonists for the treatment of schizophrenia has included the use of low doses of dopamine agonists, such as apomorphine and bromocriptine, which have been reported to produce antipsychotic effects, possibly due to preferential activation of dopamine presynaptic receptors resulting in decreased dopaminergic activity (M. Del Zompo et al, Progress in Brain Research, 65:41-48, 1986 and H. Y. Meltzer, Drug Development Research, 9:23-40, 1986). In addition, the dopamine D1-selective agonist, SKF 38393, when used in conjunction with the antipsychotic drug, haloperidol, a D2 antagonist, has been shown to ameliorate the undesired side effects of the haloperidol (M. Davidson et al., Arch Gen. Psychiatry, 47:190-191, 1990).\n\n\nThere is evidence that dopamine plays a role in the brain reward system. For example, animals trained to self-administer cocaine will increase their consumption of this drug after treatment with either a D1 or a D2 receptor antagonist, presumably in order to maintain the elevated dopamine levels responsible for the drug's euphorigenic and reinforcing properties (D. R. Britton et al, Pharmacology Biochemistry & Behavior, 39:911-915, 1991). The D1 agonist, SKF 38393, has also been reported to decrease food intake by rats, presumably by direct action of the drug on neural feeding mechanisms. Because of this interrelationship between dopamine and reward, dopaminergic agents would be useful for the treatment of substance abuse and other addictive behavior disorders, including cocaine addiction (A. L. Chausmer et al. Psychopharmacology, 159:145-153, 2002) nicotine addiction and eating disorders.\n\n\nAffective disorders, the most common psychiatric disorders in adults, are characterized by changes in mood as the primary clinical manifestation, and result from a reduction in the central nervous system of certain biogenic amine neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin. Currently available antidepressants work primarily by raising biogenic amine neurotransmitter levels, either by inhibiting their uptake or preventing their metabolism. No antidepressant drug to date, however, can substitute for electroconvulsive shock therapy for the treatment of severe, suicidal depression. Currently available drugs for treating affective disorders unfortunately suffer from delayed onset of action, poor efficacy, anticholinergic effects at therapeutic doses, cardiotoxicity, convulsions and the possibility of overdosing. A large number of clinically depressed individuals remain refractory to currently available therapies. A role for direct-acting dopamine agonists in antidepressant therapy has been suggested based on the effects observed for several dopamine agonists in various animal models (R. Muscat et al., Biological Psychiatry, 31:937-946, 1992).\n\n\nA role for dopamine has also been established in cognition and attention mechanisms. Animal studies support the role of dopamine in attention-related behaviors involving search and exploratory activity, distractibility, response rate, discriminability and the switching of attention. Treatment of cognitive impairment and attention deficit disorders via dopamine-based therapy has been proposed and is under active investigation (A. Nieoullon, Progress in Neurobiology, 67:53-58 (2002) and T. Sawaguchi and P. S. Goldman-Rakic, Science, 252:947-940 (1991); and P. S. Goldman-Rakic et al., Science, 287:2020-2022 (2000)).\n\n\nIn addition, dopamine has been identified with a number of effects in the periphery, and has been used in the treatment of shock, congestive heart failure and acute renal failure. Stimulation of the peripheral D1 receptors causes vasodilation, particularly in the renal and mesenteric vascular beds where large numbers of these receptors are found. The utility of dopamine has been limited, however, by its ability to cause vasoconstriction at higher concentrations, presumably due to its secondary effects on adrenergic receptors, and by its emetic effects due to peripheral D2 stimulation. Agents selective for the peripheral D1 receptors appear to offer significant advantages over treatments used currently for these and other related disorders (M. F. Lokhandwala, Drug Development Research, 113:123-124 (1987)).\n\n\nCertain compounds within the scope of the present invention are generically disclosed and claimed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,004,982, the entire disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. For example, certain (4-piperidinyl)-1H-2-benzopyrans) were disclosed therein to be useful as antipsychotics. The present invention represents single enatiomers of piperidinylisochromans as dopamine agonists.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nA compound of formula I\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein\n\n\nR\n1 \nis selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, phenoxycarbonyl, C\n1-6\nalkoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, naphthyloxycarbonyl, phenylcarbamoyl, phenylcarbamoylC\n1-6\nalkyl, biphenylcarbamoyl, phenylC\n1-6\nalkylcarbamoyl, naphthylcarbamoylC\n1-6\nalkyl, N-phenyl-NâC\n1-6\nalkycarbamoyl, C\n1-6\nalkyl and C\n1-6\ndialkylcarbamoyl, C\n2-6\nalkenyl and C\n2-6\ndialkenylcarbamoyl, diphenylcarbamoyl, heteroarylcarbamoylC\n1-6\nalkyl, phenylcarbonyl, biphenylcarbonyl, C\n1-6\nalkylcarbonyl, morpholinylcarbonyl, piperidinylcarbonyl, pyrrolidinylcarbonyl, phenothiazinylcarbonyl, phenylsulfonyl, diphenylsulfonyl, naphthylsulfonyl, C\n1-10\nalkylsulfonyl, naphthyl C\n1-6\nalkylsulfonyl, C\n1-6\nperfluoroalkylsulfonyl, diphenylC\n1-6\nalkylsulfonyl, benzenesulfonyl, C\n1-6\ndialkylaminosulfonyl, diphenylC\n1-6\nalkyl, benzyl, phenylC\n2-6\nalkyl, naphthylC\n1-6\nalkyl; C\n3-6\ncycloalkylC\n1-6\nalkyl, phenylC\n1-6\nalkenyl, heteroarylC\n1-6\nalkyl, Î±-carboxybenzyl, phenylcarbonylC\n1-6\nalkyl, hydroxyC\n1-6\nalkyl, biphenylC\n1-6\nalkyl, C\n1-6\nalkyl, phenoxyphenylC\n1-6\nalkyl, phenylureaC\n1-6\nalkyl, indanyl, wherein benzyl and phenyl are optionally substituted with one or two substituents each independently selected from the group consisting of C\n1-6\nalkyl, C\n1-6\nperfluoroalkyl, halogen, hydroxy, C\n1-6\nalkoxy and nitro, and wherein heteroaryl is thiophenyl, benzothiophenyl, furanyl, benzofuranyl, tetrahydroquinolyl, tetrahydroisoquinolyl, indolyl, imidazolyl, benzimidazolyl, pyridinyl, isothiazolyl, benzisothiazolyl, isoxazolyl, benzisoxazolyl, isoquinolyl, or quinolyl wherein heteroaryl is optionally substituted with one or two substituents each independently selected from the group C\n1-6\nalkyl, halogen, hydroxy, benzyl and C\n1-6\nalkoxy,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein\n\n\nR is hydrogen or benzyl\n\n\nY is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, C\n1-6\nalkyl, C\n1-6\nperfluoroalkyl, halogen, hydroxy, C\n1-6\nalkoxy and nitro;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR\n2 \nand R\n3 \nare the same or different and independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, C\n1-6\nalkyl, C\n1-6\nalkylcarbonyl, formyl, C\n2-6\nalkenyl, C\n3-6\ncycloalkylC\n1-6\nalkyl and R\n2\n, R\n3 \ntaken together can form a ring of from 2-5 carbon atoms;\n\n\nR\n4 \nis selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, C\n1-4\nalkyl, and C\n1-6\nalkylcarbonyl;\n\n\nX is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and C\n1-6\nalkyl; and\n\n\nn is an integer 1, 2 or 3,\n\n\na stereoisomer or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe present invention also comprises a pharmaceutical composition comprising the compound of formula I and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, a method of treating a patient for abnormal dopamine levels, in particular Parkinson's Disease, by administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of the compound formula I.\n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe terms as used herein have the following meanings:\n\n\nAs used herein, the expression âC\n1-6 \nalkylâ used alone or in combination with other terms means an alkyl (or alkylene as appropriate), straight or branched-chain and includes methyl and ethyl groups, and straight-chained or branched propyl, butyl, pentyl and hexyl groups.

comprising administering to a patient in need of such treatment a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula I.\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention may be prepared by the synthetic routes described below in the Schemes or by other methods, which may be apparent to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Scheme A the synthesis of the key intermediate of formula 7 is depicted. In step A1 the N,P-acetal of formula 1 formation of which is described by M. Journet, et al., \nTetrahedron Letters\n, (1998), 39, 1717-1720, is reacted in a Horner-Emmons type reaction with a base in the presence of an appropriately substituted aromatic aldehyde of the formula 2 in a suitable solvent followed by acidic workup to produce the pyridinyl ketone of formula 3. The reaction is typically run in alcoholic solvents or mixtures of alcohols and ethereal solvents. Alcohols such as ethanol, isopropanol or methanol may be used optionally with ethereal solvents such as tetrahydrofuran or diethyl ether. Suitable bases, for example, would be alkali metal carbonates such as Na\n2\nCO\n3\n, K\n2\nCO\n3 \nand Cs\n2\nCO\n3\n.\n\n\nIn Scheme A step A2 the stereoselective reduction of compound of the formula 3 to give the chiral alcohol of the compound of the formula 4 is accomplished by reaction of the ketone 3 with an suitable chiral reducing reagent. Reduction of the ketone 3 stereoselectively to the desired (S) pyridyl alcohol 4 may be effected by methods well known to those skilled in the art, for instance, optically active reducing agents such a diisopinocampheylchloroborane, (DIP-Chlorideâ¢), Î²-isopinocampheyl-9-borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane, (Alpine-Boraneâ¢) and aluminum complexes derived from 1,1â²-binaphthyl-2,2â²-diol (BINAL-H), constitute one class. Another approach utilizes an optically active catalyst such as 2,2â²-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1â²-binaphthyl-ruthenium acetate with hydrogen or oxazaborolidines in the presence of borane-tetrahydrofuran (THF) complex or catecholborane. A discussion of enatioselective reduction of ketones can be found in Smith, M. B. and March, J., \nMarch's Advanced Organic Chemistry\n, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 2001, pp. 1200-1201. The reduction can be accomplished in a variety of organic solvents with or without the addition of a Lewis acid such as BF\n3\n.Et\n2\nO, which may complex with the pyridine nitrogen and thus require less reducing agent. Suitable organic solvents are ethereal solvents such as ether or THF, hydrocarbon solvents such as pentane, hexane and the like or chlorinated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane, chloroform or 1,2-dichloroethane. The reaction can be carried out at ambient or below ambient temperatures, for example, â60Â° C. to 25Â° C.\n\n\nIn step A4 the chiral pyridinyl alcohol of formula 4 is reduced to the piperidinyl alcohol of compound of the formula 5 by catalytic hydrogenation, a method that is well-known in the art. Suitable catalysts are platinum oxide, palladium, ruthenium, rhodium and nickel. The reaction is normally performed in an alcoholic solvent such as methanol, ethanol, propanol and isopropanol with the optional addition of a mineral acid such as HCl, or in an organic acid such as acetic or propionic acid or mixtures thereof. The reaction can be run at a temperature of between room temperature and 175Â° C. and at pressures of between 30-2000 p.s.i. of hydrogen.\n\n\nIn step A5 reaction of the alcohol 19 with the formamide acetal 6 results in the formation of the isochroman intermediate 7. The reaction is run in the presence of a Lewis acid as catalyst in a suitable organic solvent at from about â10Â° C. to. Examples of suitable Lewis acids are boron trifluoride etherate and trimethylsilyl triflate. Suitable organic solvents include ethereal solvents such as ether and tetrahydrofuran or chlorinated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane, chloroform and 1,2-dichloroethane. The reaction can be carried out at ambient or below ambient temperatures, for example, â10Â° C. to 25Â° C. See U.S. Pat. No. 6,004,982, issued Dec. 21, 1999, incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompounds of formula I wherein R\n1 \nis diphenylC\n1-6\nalkyl, benzyl, phenylC\n2-6\nalkyl, C\n3-6\ncycloalkylC\n1-6\nalkyl, phenylC\n1-6\nalkylene heteroarylC\n1-6\nalkyl, phenylcarbonylC\n1-6\nalkyl, phenylcarbamoylC\n1-6\nalkyl, biphenylC\n1-6\nalkyl, C\n1-6\nalkyl and indanyl may be prepared according to the sequence illustrated in Scheme B. Accordingly, in step B1 compound of formula 7 is reacted with an aldehyde in the presence of a suitable borohydride and a suitable solvent to effect a reductive amination resulting in the compound of formula 8. Suitable borohydrides are for example sodium borohydride, sodium triacetoxy borohydride, sodium cyanoborohydride and sodium borohydride in conjunction with titanium isopropoxide may be used. Suitable solvents for the reaction are halogen containing solvents such dichloromethane, chloroform and dichloroethane, alcoholic solvents such as methanol, ethanol and isopropanol, ethereal solvents such as diethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran and acetonitrile. The reaction temperature is not critical but typically the reaction is run at from 0Â° C. to ambient temperature.\n\n\nAs further illustrated in Scheme B compound 8 can undergo further reactions to give other desired derivatives. In step B2 the formyl group of compound 8 may be cleaved to produce the primary amine, the compound of formula 9. The cleavage can be effected by acid or base hydrolysis, methods well known to those skilled in the art. For instance, the formyl group may be removed by refluxing with dilute hydrochloric acid a water miscible organic solvent, or hydrolysis effected by heating in the presence of an aqueous alkaline metal hydroxide solution with a water miscible cosolvent.\n\n\nIn step B3 cleavage of the phenol ether compound 9 (where R\n4 \nis C\n1\n-C\n4\nalkyl) to the compound of formula 10, can be readily accomplished by reaction of compound 9 with a suitable Lewis acid in a suitable organic solvent. Suitable Lewis acids are boron trihalides and aluminum trihalides, for instance boron tribromide, boron trichloride, aluminum tribromide and aluminum trichloride. Suitable organic solvents are alkylhalides such as dichloromethane, chloroform and dichloroethane, and aromatic solvents such as benzene, toluene and xylenes. Typically, the reaction can be run from â10Â° C. to the reflux temperature of the organic solvent\n\n\nAlternatively, in step B4 compound 10 can also be obtained from the compound 8 directly by concomitant cleavage of the arylalkyl ether, and the formyl group by the reaction of compound 10 with a suitable mineral acid optionally with a quantity of a suitable organic acid. Suitable mineral acids are concentrated hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid and hydroiodic acid and suitable organic acids are acetic, trifluoroacetic and propionic acid. The reaction temperature may vary from about ambient to reflux temperature of the reaction medium.\n\n\nIn step B5 preparation of the methylamino compound of formula 11 may be conveniently accomplished by reduction of the formamide group of the compound of the formula 8. Reduction can be readily accomplished by treatment of the formamide with an appropriate metal hydride or borohydride in a suitable organic solvent.

Suitable inert organic solvents are hydrohalocarbon solvents such as dichloromethane, aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene and the like and acetonitrile. The reaction may be carried out at a suitable temperature such as within the range of 0Â° C. to room temperature.\n\n\nIn step D4 concomitant displacement of the resin and functionalization of the piperidine nitrogen is effected to produce the compound of the formula 18. In a two-step procedure, the resin bound isochroman of formula 17 is first reacted with a diphenylalkyl halide, benzyl halide, phenylalkyl halide, alkylcycloalkylalkyl, halide, phenylalkylenealkyl halide, heteroarylalkyl halide, phenylcarbonyalkyl halide, hydroxyalkyl halide, biphenyalkyl halide, alkyl halide, indanyl halide in the presence of a suitable solvent followed by treatment of the intermediate quaternized salt with a suitable base in a suitable solvent to produce the N-substituted intermediate 18.

Cleavage of the arylalkyl ether to yield compounds of formula 33 may be accomplished as described in Scheme B, step B4.\n\n\nThe invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising one or more of the compounds according to this invention in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Preferably these compositions are in unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills, capsules, powders, granules, sterile parenteral solutions or suspensions, metered aerosol or liquid sprays, drops, ampoules, auto-injector devices or suppositories; for oral, parenteral, intranasal, sublingual or rectal administration, or for administration by inhalation or insufflation. Alternatively, the compositions may be presented in a form suitable for once-weekly or once-monthly administration; for example, an insoluble salt of the active compound, such as the decanoate salt, may be adapted to provide a depot preparation for intramuscular injection. An erodible polymer containing the active ingredient may be envisaged. For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the principal active ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical carrier, e.g. conventional tableting ingredients such as corn starch, lactose, sucrose, sorbitol, talc, stearic acid, magnesium stearate, dicalcium phosphate or gums, and other pharmaceutical diluents, e.g. water, to form a solid preformulation composition containing a homogeneous mixture of a compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. When referring to these preformulation compositions as homogeneous, it is meant that the active ingredient is dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition may be readily subdivided into equally effective unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills and capsules. This solid preformulation composition is then subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type described above containing from 0.1 to about 500 mg of the active ingredient of the present invention. Flavored unit dosage forms contain from 1 to 100 mg, for example 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50 or 100 mg, of the active ingredient. The tablets or pills of the novel composition can be coated or otherwise compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged action. For example, the tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former. The two components can be separated by an enteric layer which serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permits the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of materials can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials including a number of polymeric acids and mixtures of polymeric acids with such materials as shellac, cetyl alcohol and cellulose acetate.\n\n\nThe liquid forms in which the novel compositions of the present invention may be incorporated for administration orally or by injection include aqueous solutions, suitably flavored syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions, and flavored emulsions with edible oils such as cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut oil or peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles. Suitable dispersing or suspending agents for aqueous suspensions include synthetic and natural gums such as tragacanth, acacia, alginate, dextran, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone or gelatin.\n\n\nIn the treatment of various disease states as described herein, a suitable dosage level is about 0.01 to 250 mg/kg per day, preferably about 0.05 to 100 mg/kg per day, and especially about 0.05 to 20 mg/kg per day. The compounds may be administered on a regimen of 1 to 4 times per day.\n\n\nBIOLOGICAL EXAMPLES\n\n\nThe following test protocols are used to ascertain the biological properties of the compounds of this invention.\n\n\n[\n3\nH]-SCH-23390 Binding to Cloned Human Dopamine D\n1 \nReceptors\n\n\nPurpose:\n\n\nDetermination of relative binding affinity of potential neuropsychiatric and other agents for the human dopamine D\n1 \nreceptor.\n\n\nProcedure:\n\n\nA.

Cells were maintained in Ham's F12+10% Fetal Bovine Serum+Penicillin/Streptomycin (100 U/ml/100 Î¼g/ml)+G418 (400 Î¼g/ml) medium and were split using Trypsin-EDTA (1 ml/plate, room temperature for Ë2 min. or until cells have lifted off plates).\n\n\n2. Stock plates were subcultured into 90 large plates over 2 weeks, and 1.5 large plates were split into one roller bottle (90 ml of culture medium per roller bottle).\n\n\n3. Plates are incubated at 37Â° C.+5% CO\n2 \nfor Ë3 days or until cells were confluent. Cells are spun at 30-40% motor speed in the Forma incubator.\n\n\nStorage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCells are harvested by mechanical scraping, washed using PBS collected in 250 ml Corning polypropylene centrifuge tubes, spun down and resuspended in dH\n2\nO (final volume per harvest approximately 60 ml). Protein determination is made according to the method of Lowry (Biorad DC Assay Kit). Following the determination of the protein concentration, the protein is diluted into distilled water with 10% DMSO to the appropriate volume based on expression levels (B\nmax\n). The concentrated protein is aliquoted into 1.5 ml screw top eppendorf tubes and placed into a â80Â° C. freezer.\n\n\nAssay Requirement: 1 cryovial per two 96 well plates\n\n\n[\n3\nH]-Ligand: [N-methyl-\n3\nH]-Spiroperidol (60-90 Ci/mmol) at 0.4 nM (NEN-856)\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nK\nD\n=0.08 nM\n\n\nMaterials: S(â)-Eticlopride (Research Biochemicals Int.

Raw signals generated by cAMP standard wells, without cells, are averaged at each cAMP concentration and converted to % B/B\no \nby dividing the raw signal at each cAMP concentration by the raw signal with no cAMP added.\n \n2. These values are used to generate a standard curve by plotting cAMP concentration versus % B/B\no\n.\n \n3. Raw data for each compound at each concentration is also converted to % B/B. by the same method.\n \n4. These values are then converted to pmol cAMP/mL using the standard curve.\n \n5. These cAMP values are then averaged across the three replicates for each compound concentration.\n \n6. This value is then take as a percentage between the basal stimulated cells (cells alone), and stimulated cells (cells with a saturating amount of a known D1 agonist.) This generates a percent stimulation for each compound at each concentration.\n \n7. This data is plotted as compound concentration versus percent stimulation, and a line is fit to the data points.\n \n8. The concentration at which half-maximal stimulation occurs is reported as the EC\n50\n.\n\n\nThe percent stimulation at which the curve plateaus is compared to the maximum stimulation of the natural agonist Dopamine, and reported as the % Maximal Dopamine stimulation.\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nTable 2 describes the intrinsic activity in the adenylate cyclase assay, indicating the compounds act as agonists
