This invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds. The compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of this invention are particularly well suited for inhibiting ICE activity and consequently, may be advantageously used as agents against interleukin-1-(“IL-1”), apoptosis-, interferon gamma inducing factor-(“IGIF”) and interferon-γ-(“IFN-γ”) mediated, diseases, including inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, destructive bone, proliferative disorders, infectious diseases and degenerative diseases. This invention also relates to methods for inhibiting ICE activity, and decreasing IGIF production and IFN-γ production and methods for treating interleukin-1-, apoptosis-, IGIF- and IFN-γ-mediated diseases using the compounds and compositions of this invention. This invention also relates to methods of preparing N-acylamino compounds.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nInterleukin 1 (“IL-1”) is a major pro-inflammatory and immunoregulatory protein that stimulates fibroblast differentiation and proliferation, the production of prostaglandins, collagenase and phospholipase by synovial cells and chondrocytes, basophil and eosinophil degranulation and neutrophil activation. Oppenheim, J. H. et al, \nImmunology Today, \n7, pp. 45-56 (1986), As such, it is involved in the pathogenesis of chronic and acute inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. For example, in rheumatoid arthritis, IL-1 is both a mediator of inflammatory symptoms and of the destruction of the cartilage proteoglycan in afflicted joints. Wood, D. D, et al., \nArthritis Rheum. \n26, 975, (1983); Pettipher, E. J. et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. UNITED STATES OF AMERICA \n71, 295 (1986); Arend, W. P, and Dayer, J. M., \nArthritis Rheum, \n38, 151 (1995), IL-1 is also a highly potent bone resorption agent. Jandiski, J. J., \nJ. Oral Path \n17, 145 (1988); Dewhirst, F. E. et al., \nJ. Immunol. \n8, 2562 1985). It is alternately referred to as “osteoclast activating factor” in destructive bone diseases such as osteoarthritis and multiple myeloma. Bataille, R. et al., \nInt. J. Clin. Lab. Res. \n21(4), 283 (1992). In certain proliferative disorders, such as acute myelogenous leukemia and multiple myeloma, IL-1 can promote tumor cell growth and adhesion. Bani, M. R., \nJ. Natl. Cancer Inst. \n83, 123 (1991); Vidal-Vanaclocha, F., \nCancer Res. \n54, 2667 (1994). In these disorders, IL-1 also stimulates production of other cytokines such as IL-6, which can modulate tumor development (Tartour et al., \nCancer Res. \n54, 6243 (1994). IL-1 is predominantly produced by peripheral blood monocytes as part of the inflammatory response and exists in two distinct agonist forms, IL-1α and IL-1β. Mosely, B. S. et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci., \n84, pp. 4572-4576 (1987); Lonnemann, G. et al., \nEur. J. Immunol., \n19, pp. 1531-1536 (1989).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIL-1β is synthesized as a biologically inactive precursor, pIL-1β. pIL-\n1β lacks a conventional leader sequence and is not processed by a signal peptidase. March, C. J.,\n \nNature, \n315, pp. 641-647 (1985). Instead, pIL-1β is cleaved by interleukin-1β converting enzyme (“ICE”) between Asp-116 and Ala-117 to produce the biologically active C-terminal fragment found in human serum and synovial fluid. Sleath, P. R., et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem., \n265, pp. 14526-14528 (1992); A. D. Howard et al., \nJ. Immunol\n., 147, pp. 2964-2969 (1991). ICE is a cysteine protease localized primarily in monocytes. It converts precursor IL-1β to the mature form. Black, R. A. et al., \nFEBS Lett., \n247, pp. 386-390 (1989); Kostura, M. J. et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, \n86, pp. 5227-5231 (1989). Processing by ICE is also necessary for the transport of mature IL-1β through the cell membrane.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nICE, or its homologs, also appears to be involved in the regulation of programmed cell death or apoptosis. Yuan, J. et al., \nCell, \n75, pp. 641-652 (1993), Miura, M. et al., \nCell, \n75, pp. 653-660 (1993); Nett-Fiordalisi, M. A., et al., \nJ. Cell Biochem., \n17B, p. 117 (1993). In particular, ICE or ICE homologs are thought to be associated with the regulation of apoptosis in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Marx, J. and M. Baringa, \nScience, \n259, pp. 760-762 (1993); Gagliardini, V. et al., \nScience, \n263, pp. 826-828 (1994). Therapeutic applications for inhibition of apoptosis may include treatment of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke, myocardial infarction, spinal atrophy, and aging.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nICE has been demonstrated to mediate apoptosis (programmed cell death) in certain tissue types. Steller, H., \nScience, \n267, p. 1445 (1995); Whyte, M. and Evan, G., \nNature, \n376, p. 17 (1995); Martin, S. J. and Green, D. R., \nCell, \n82, p. 349 (1995); Alnemri, E. S., et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem., \n270, p. 4312 (1994); Yuan, \nJ. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol., \n7, p. 211 (1995). A transgenic mouse with a disruption of the ICE gene is deficient in Fas-mediated apoptosis (Kuida, K. et al., \nScience \n267, 2000 (1995)). This activity of ICE is distinct from its role as the processing enzyme for pro-IL1β. It is conceivable that in certain tissue types, inhibition of ICE may not affect secretion of mature IL-1β, but may inhibit apoptosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnzymatically active ICE has been previously described as heterodimer composed of two subunits, p20 and p10 (20 kDa and 10 kDa molecular weight, respectively). These subunits are derived from a 45 kDa proenzyme (p45) by way of a p30 form, through an activation mechanism that is autocatalytic. Thornberry, N. A. et al., \nNature, \n356, pp. 768-774 (1992). The ICE proenzyme has been divided into several functional domains: a prodomain (p14), a p22/20 subunit, a polypeptide linker and a p10 subunit. \nThornberry et al.\n, supra; Casano et al., \nGenomics, \n20, pp. 474-481 (1994).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFull length p45 has been characterized by its cDNA and amino acid sequences. PCT patent applications WO 91/15577 and WO 94/00154. The p20 and p10 cDNA and amino acid sequences are also known. \nThornberry et al\n., supra. Murine and rat ICE have also been sequences and cloned. They have high amino acid and nucleic acid sequence homology to human ICE. Miller, D. K., et al., \nAnn. N.Y. Acad. Sci., \n696, pp. 133-148 (1993); Molineaux, S. M. et al., \nProc. Nat. Acad. Sci., \n90, pp. 1809-1813 (1993). The three-dimensional structure of ICE has been determined at atomic resolution by X-ray crystallography. Wilson, K. P., et al., \nNature, \n370, pp. 270-275 (1994). The active enzyme exists as a tetramer of two p20 and two p10 subunits.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, there exist human homologs of ICE with sequence similarities in the active site regions of the enzymes. Such homologs include TX (or ICE\nrel-II \nor ICH-2) (Faucheu, et al., \nEMBO J., \n14, p. 1914 (1995); Kamens J., et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem., \n270, p. 15250 (1995); Nicholson et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem., \n270 15870 (1995)), TY (or ICE\nrel-III\n) (Nicholson et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem., \n270, p. 15870 (1995); ICH-1 (or Nedd-2) (Wang, L. et al., \nCell, \n78, p. 739 (1994)), MCH-2, (Fernandes-Alnemri, T. et al., \nCancer Res., \n55, p. 2737 (1995), CPP32 (or YAMA or apopain) (Fernandes-Alnemri, T. et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem., \n269, p. 30761 (1994); Nicholson, D. W. et al., \nNature, \n376, p. 37 (1995)), and CMH-1 (or MCH-3) (Lippke, et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem\n., (1996); Fernandes-Alnemri, T. et al., \nCancer Res\n., (1995)). Each of these ICE homologs, as well as ICE itself, is capable of inducing apoptosis when overexpressed in transfected cell lines. Inhibition of one or more of these homologs with the peptidyl ICE inhibitor Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-chloromethylketone results in inhibition of apoptosis in primary cells or cell lines. Lazebnik et al., \nNature, \n371, p. 346 (1994). The compounds described herein are also capable of inhibiting one or more homologs of ICE (see Example 5). Therefore, these compounds may be used to inhibit apoptosis in tissue types that contain ICE homologs, but which do not contain active ICE or produce mature IL-1β.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInterferon-gamma inducing factor (IGIF) is an approximately 18-kDa polypeptide that stimulates T-cell production of interferon-gamma (IFN-65). IGIF is produced by activated Kupffer cells and macrophases in vivo and is exported out of such cells upon endotoxin stimulation. Thus, a compound that decreases IGIF production would be useful as an inhibitor of such T-cell stimulation which in turn would reduce the levels of IFN-γ production by those cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIFN-γ is a cytokine with immunomodulatory effects on a variety of immune cells. In particular, IFN-γ is involved in macrophage activation and Thi cell selection (F. Belardelli, \nAPMIS, \n103, p. 161 (1995)). IFN-γ exerts its effects in part by modulating the expression of genes through the STAT and IRF pathways (C. Schindler and J. E. Darnell, \nAnn. Rev. Biochem., \n64, p. 621 (1995); T. Taniquchi, \nJ. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol., \n121, p. 516 (1995)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMice lacking IFN-γ or its receptor have multiple defects in immune cell function and are resistant to endotoxic shock (S. Huang et al., \nScience, \n259, p. 1742 (1993); D. Dalton et al., \nScience, \n259, p. 1739 (1993); B. D. Car et al., \nJ. Exp. Med., \n179, p. 1437 (1994)). Along with IL-12, IGIF appears to be a potent inducer of IFN-γ production by T cells (H. Okamura et al., \nInfection and Immunity, \n63 p. 3966 (1995); H. Okamura et al., \nNature, \n378, p. 88 (1995); S. Ushio et al., \nJ. Immunol., \n156, p. 4274 (1996)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIFN-γ has been shown to contribute to the pathology associated with a variety of inflammatory, infectious and autoimmune disorders and diseases. Thus, compounds capable of decreasing IFN-γ production would be useful to ameliorate the effects of IFN-γ related pathologies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe biological regulation of IGIF and thus IFN-γ has not been elucidated. It is known that IGIF is synthesized as a precursor protein, called “pro-IGIF”. It has been unclear, however, how pro-IGIF is cleaved and whether its processing has biological importance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, compositions and methods capable of regulating the conversion of pro-IGIF to IGIF would be useful for decreasing IGIF and IFN-γ production in vivo, and thus for ameliorating the detrimental effects of these proteins which contribute to human disorders and diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, ICE and other members of the ICE/CED-3 family have not previously been linked to the conversion of pro-IGIF to IGIF or to IFN-γ production in vivo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nICE inhibitors represent a class of compounds useful for the control of inflammation or apoptosis or both. Peptide and peptidyl inhibitors of ICE have been described. PCT patent applications WO 91/15577; WO 93/05071; WO 93/09135; WO 93/14777 and WO 93/16710; and \nEuropean patent application\n 0 547 699. Such peptidyl inhibitors of ICE has bean observed to block the production of mature IL-1β in a mouse model of inflammation (vide infra) and to suppress growth of leukemia cells in vitro (Estrov et al., \nBlood \n84, 380a (1994)). However, due to their peptidic nature, such inhibitors are typically characterized by undesirable pharmacologic properties, such as poor cellular penetration and cellular activity, poor oral absorption, poor stability and rapid metabolism, Plattner, J. J. and D. W. Norbeck, in \nDrug Discovery Technologies\n, C. R. Clark and W. H. Moos, Eds. (Ellis Horwood, Chichester, England, 1990), pp. 92126. This has hampered their development into effective drugs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-peptidyl compounds have also been reported to inhibit ICE in vitro. PCT patent application WO 95/26958; U.S. Pat. No. 5,552,400; Dolle at al., \nJ. Med. Chem., \n39, pp. 2438-2440 (1996); However, it is not clear whether these compounds have the appropriate pharmacological profile to be therapeutically useful.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, current methods for the preparation of such compounds are not advantageous. These methods use tributyltin hydride, a toxic moisture sensitive reagent. Thus, these methods are inconvenient to carry out, pose a health risk and create toxic-waste disposal problems. Furthermore, it is difficult to purify compounds prepared by these methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, the need exists for compounds that can effectively inhibit the action of ICE in vivo, for use as agents for preventing and treating chronic and acute forms of IL-1-mediated diseases, apoptosis-, IGIF-, or IFN-γ-mediated diseases, as well as inflammatory, autoimmune, destructive bone, proliferative, infectious, or degenerative diseases. The need also exists for methods of preparing such compounds.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides novel classes of compounds, and pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof, that are useful as inhibitors of ICE. These compounds can be used alone or in combination with other therapeutic or prophylactic agents, such as antibiotics, immunomodulators or other anti-inflammatory agents, for the treatment or prophylaxis of diseases mediated by IL-1, apoptosis, IGIF or IFN-γ. According to a preferred embodiment, the compounds of this invention are capable of binding to the active site of ICE and inhibiting the activity of that enzyme. Additionally, they have improved cellular potency, improved pharmacokinetics, and/or improved oral bioavailability compared to peptidyl ICE inhibitors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is a principal object of this invention to provide novel classes of compounds which are inhibitors of ICE represented by formulas:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwherein the various substituents are described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is a further object of this invention to provide a process of preparing N-acylamino compounds by coupling a carboxylic acid with an alloc-protected amine.\n\n\n \n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFIG. 1A\n ICE cleaves pro-IGIF in vivo. Cell lysates from Cos cells transfected with the various indicated expression plasmids or controls were analyzed for the presence of IGIF by separating proteins by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-IGIF antisera (\nLane\n 1, mock transfected cells; \nlane\n 2, pro-IGIF alone; lanes 3-12, pro-IGIF in combination with ICE, ICE-C285S, CPP32, CPP32-C163S, CMH-1, CMH-1-C186S, Tx, Tx-C258S, respectively). Mobilities of pro-IGIF and the 18-kDa mature IGIF are indicated on the right. Molecular weight markers in kDa are shown on the left (Example 23).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 1B\n ICE cleaves pro-IGIF at the authentic processing site in vitro as shown by Coomassie blue staining of proteolytic reaction products separated by SDS-PAGE (Example 23). The proteases and inhibitors used were: \nLane\n 1, buffer control; lane , 0.1 nM ICE; \n \nlane\n \n 3, 1 nM ICE; \n \n \nlanes\n \n \n 4 and 5, 1 nM ICE with 10 nM Cbz-Val-Ala-Asp-[(2,6-dicholorobenzoyl)oxy]methyl ketone and 100 nM Ac-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-aldehyde, respectively; \n \n \nlanes\n \n \n 6 and 7, 15 nM CPP32 with and without 400 nM Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde (D. W. Nicholson et al., \nNature, \n376, p. 37 (1995)), respectively; \n \nlane\n \n 8, 100 nM CMH-1; \n \nlane\n \n 9, 10 units/ml granzyme B; and M, molecular weight markers in kDa.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 1C\n ICE cleavage converts inactive pro-IGIF to active IGIF which induces IFN-γ production in Thl helper cells. Uncleaved (Pro-IGIF), ICE-cleaved (Pro-IGIF/ICE), CPP32-cleaved (Pro-IGIF/CPP32), and recombinant mature IGIF (rIGIF) were incubated with A.E7 Thl cells at 12 ng/ml (open bar) and 120 ng/ml (hatched bar) for eighteen hours and the levels of IFN-γ released into the culture medium assayed by ELISA (Example 23). A.E7 cells cultured with buffer, ICE alone (ICE) or CPP32 alone (CPP32) were assayed similarly for negative controls. The numbers represent the average of three determinations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 2A\n Mature IGIF (18-kDa) is produced by Cos cells co-transfected with pro-IGIF and ICE-expressing plasmids. Cell lystates (left) and conditioned medium (right) from Cos cells transfected with a pro-IGIF expression plasmid in the absence (−) or present of an expression plasmid encoding wild type (ICE) or inactive mutant (ICE-C285S) ICE. Transfected cells were metabolically labeled with \n38\nS-methionine, proteins from cell lystates and conditioned medium immunoprecipitated with anti-IGIF antisera and separated by SDS-PAGE (Example 24). Mobilities of pro-IGIF and the 18-kDa mature IGIF are indicated on the right. Molecular weight markers in kDa are shown on the left.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 2B\n IFN-γ inducing activity is detected in Cos cells co-transfected with pro-IGIF and ICE-expressing plasmids. Cell lysates (hatched bar) and conditioned medium (open bar) from Cos cells transfected with a pro-IGIF expression plasmid in the absence (Pro-IGIF) or presence (Pro-IGIF/ICE) of an expression plasmid encoding wild type (ICE) were assayed for IFN-γ levels (ng/ml) by ELISA. Cos cells transfected with buffer (Mock) or an ICE-expressing plasmid alone (ICE) served as negative controls (Example 24).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 3A\n Kupffer cells from mice lacking ICE are defective in the export of IGIF. Kupffer cells from wild type mice (ICE +/+) or ICE-deficient mice homozygous for an ICE mutation (ICE−/−) were isolated and primed with LPS for three hours. The levels of immunoreactive IGIF polypeptides in the conditioned media (ng/ml) of wild type cells were measured by ELISA (Example 25). N.D. (not detectable) indicates that the IGIF concentration was less than 0.1 ng/ml.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 3B\n Kupffer cells from mice lacking ICE are defective in the export of mature IGIF. Kupffer cells from wild type mice (ICE +/+) or ICE deficient mice homozygous for an ICE mutation (ICE −/−) were isolated and primed with LPS for three hours. Primed cells were metabolically labeled with \n35\nS-methionine, proteins from cell lystates and conditioned medium immunoprecipitated with anti-IGIF antisera and separated by SDS-PAGE (Example 25). Mobilities of pro-IGIF and the 18-kDa mature IGIF are indicated on the right. Molecular mass markers in kDa are shown on the left.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 3C\n Serum from ICE-deficient mice contains reduced levels of IGIF. Serum samples from wild type mice (ICE +/+) or ICE deficient mice homozygous for an ICE mutation (ICE −/−) were assayed for IGIF levels (ng/ml) by ELISA (Example 25).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 3D\n Serum from ICE-deficient mice contains reduced levels of IFN-γ. Serum samples from wild type mice (ICE +/+) or ICE deficient mice homozygous for an ICE mutation (ICE −/−) were assayed for IFN-γ levels (ng/ml) by ELISA (Example 25).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 4\n Serum IFN-γlevels are significantly reduced in ICE-deficient mice after an acute challenge with LPS (Example 26). Serum samples from wild type mice (filled squares) or ICE-deficient mice (filled circles) were assayed for IFN-γ levels (ng/ml) by ELISA as a function of time (hours) after LPS challenge. Temperatures of the animals during the time course in degrees Celcius is shown for wild type mice (open squares) or ICE-deficient mice (open circles).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 5\n The ICE inhibitor AcYVAD-aldehyde (AcYVAD-CHO), inhibits LPS-stimulated IL-1β and IFN-γ synthesis by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Percent (%) inhibition as a function of inhibitor concentration (μM) is shown for IL-1β (open squares) and IFN-γ (open diamonds) synthesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 6\n \nCompound\n 214e inhibits IL-1β production in LPS-challenged mice. Serum samples from CD1 mice were assayed for IL-1β levels (pg/ml) by ELISA after LPS challenge. \nCompound\n 214e was administered by intraperitoneal (IP) injection one hour after LPS challenge. Blood was collected seven hours after LPS challenge (see Example 7).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 7\n Compound 217a inhibits IL-1β production in LPS-challenged mice. Serum samples from CD1 mice were assayed for IL-1β levels (pg/ml) by ELISA after LPS challenge. \nCompound\n 217e was administered by intraperitoneal (IP) injection one hour after LPS challenge. Blood was collected seven hours after LPS challenge (see Example 7).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 8\n \nCompound\n 214e, but not compound 217e, inhibits IL-1β production in LPS-challenged mice when administered by oral gavage. This assay measures oral absorption under similar conditions as those described for \nFIGS. 6 and 7\n. These results indicates the 214e is potentially orally active as an ICE inhibitor (see Example 7).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 9\n \nCompound\n 214e and analogs of 214e also inhibit IL-1β production after IP administration. These results were obtained in the assay described for \nFIGS. 6 and 7\n and Example 7.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 10\n \nCompound\n 214e, and analogs of 214e, also inhibit IL-1β production after oral (PO) administration. These results were obtained in the assay described for \nFIGS. 6 and 7\n and Example 7.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 11\n \nCompounds\n 302 and 304a show detectable blood levels when administered orally (50 mg/kg, in 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose) to mice. Blood samples were collected at 1 and 7 hours after dosing. \nCompounds\n 302 and 304a are prodrugs of 214e and are metabolized to 214e in vivo. \nCompound\n 214e shows no blood levels above 0.10 μg/ml when administered orally (Example 8).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 12\n Compound 412f blocks the progression of type II collagen-induced arthritis in male DBA/1J mice (Wooley, P.

Compound 412f was administered twice a day (10, 25 and 50 mg/kg), approximately 7 h apart, by oral gavage. Inflammation was measured on the Arthritis Severity Score on a 1 to 4 scale of increasing severity. The scores of the two front paws were added to give the final score (see Example 21).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 13\n Compound 412d blocks the progression of type II collagen-induced arthritis in male DBA/1J mice.

ICE inhibition may be determined using the methods described and incorporated by reference herein. The skilled practitioner realizes that an in vivo ICE inhibitor is not necessarily an in vitro ICE inhibitor.

Wiley & Sons, NY, N.Y., 1991.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “substitute” refers to the replacement of a hydrogen atom in a compound with a substituent group. In the present invention, those hydrogen atoms which form a part of a hydrogen bonding moiety which is capable of forming a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of Arg-341 or ICE or the carbonyl oxygen of Ser-339 of ICE are excluded from substitution. These excluded hydrogen atoms include those which comprise an —NH— group which is alpha to a —CO— group and are depicted as —NH— rather than an X group or some other designation in the following diagrams: (a) through (t), (v) through (z).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “straight chain” refers to a contiguous unbranching string of covalently bound atoms.

Lower values of K\ni \nreflect higher effectiveness. The K\ni \nvalue is a derived by fitting experimentally determined rate data to standard enzyme kinetic equations (see I. H. Segel, \nEnzyme Kinetics\n, Wiley-Interscience, 1975).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “patient” as used in this application refers to any mammal, especially humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutically effective amount” refers to an amount effective in treating or ameliorating an IL-1-, apoptosis-, IGIF- or IFN-γ-mediated disease in a patient. The term “prophylactically effective amount” refers to an amount effective in preventing or substantially lessening IL-1-, apoptosis-, IGIF or IFN-γ mediated diseases in a patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or adjuvant” refers to a non-toxic carrier or adjuvant that may be administered to a patient, together with a compound of this invention, and which does not destroy the pharmacological activity thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable derivative” means any pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, or salt of such ester, of a compound of this invention or any other compound which, upon administration to a recipient, is capable of providing (directly or indirectly) a compound of this invention or an anti-ICE active metabolite or residue thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of this invention include, for example, those derived from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic and organic acids and bases. Examples of suitable acids include hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, nitric, perchloric, fumaric, maleic, phosphoric, glycolic, lactic, salicylic, succinic, toluene-p-sulfonic, tartaric, acetic, citric, methanesulfonic, formic, benzoic, malonic, naphthalene-2-sulfonic and benzenesulfonic acids. Other acids, such as oxalic, while not in themselves pharmaceutically acceptable, may be employed in the preparation of salts useful as intermediates in obtaining the compounds of the invention and their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts. Salts derived from appropriate bases include alkali metal (e.g., sodium), alkaline earth metal (e.g., magnesium), ammonium and N-(C\n1-4 \nalkyl)\n4\n \n+\n salts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis invention also envisions the “quaternization” of any basic nitrogen-containing groups of the compounds disclosed herein. The basic nitrogen can be quaternized with any agents known to those of ordinary skill in the art including, for example, lower alkyl halides, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl chloride, bromides and iodides; dialkyl sulfates including dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl and diamyl sulfates; long chain halides such as decyl, lauryl, myristyl and stearyl chlorides, bromides and iodides; and aralkyl halides including benzyl and phenethyl bromides. Water or oil-soluble or dispersible products may be obtained by such quaternization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ICE inhibitors of this invention may contain one or more “asymmetric” carbon atoms and thus may occur as racemates and racemic mixtures, single enantiomers, diastereomeric mixtures and individual diastereomers. All such isomeric forms of these compounds are expressly included in the present invention. Each stereogenic carbon may be of the R or S configuration. Although specific compounds and scaffolds exemplified in this application may be depicted in a particular stereochemical configuration, compounds and scaffolds having either the opposite stereochemistry at any given chiral center or mixtures thereof are also envisioned.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ICE inhibitors of this invention may comprise ring structures which may optionally be substituted at carbon, nitrogen or other atoms by various substituents. Such ring structures may be singly or multiply substituted. Preferably, the ring structures contain between 0 and 3 substituents. When multiply substituted, each substituent may be picked independently of any other substituent as long as the combination of substituents results in the formation of a stable compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCombinations of substituents and variables envisioned by this invention are only those that result in the formation of stable compounds. The term “stable”, as used herein, refers to compounds which possess stability sufficient to allow manufacture and administration to a mammal by methods known in the art. Typically, such compounds are stable at a temperature of 40° C. or less, in the absence of moisture or other chemically reactive conditions, for at least a week.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubstituents may be represented in various forms. These various forms are known to the skilled practitioner and may be used interchangeably. For example, a methyl substituent on a phenyl ring may be represented in any of the following forms:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious forms of substituents such as methyl are used herein interchangeably.\n\n\n \nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIn order that the invention herein described may be more fully understood, the following detailed

Nos. 08/575,641 and 08/598,332 the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of this invention have a molecular weight of less than or equal to about 700 Daltons, and more preferably between about 400 and 600 Daltons. These preferred compounds may be readily absorbed by the bloodstream of patients upon oral administration. This oral availability makes such compounds excellent agents for orally-administered treatment and prevention regimens against IL-1-, apoptosis-, IGIF- or IFN-γ mediated diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt should be understood that the compounds of this invention may exist in various equilibrium forms, depending on conditions including choice of solvent, pH, and others known to the practitioner skilled in the art. All such forms of these compounds are expressly included in the present invention. In particular, many of the compounds of this invention, especially those which contain aldehyde or ketone groups in R\n3 \nand carboxylic acid groups in T, may take hemi-ketal for hemi-acetal) or hydrated forms. For example, compounds of embodiment (A) may take the forms depicted below:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDepending on the choice of solvent and other conditions known to the practitioner skilled in the art, compounds of this invention may also take acyloxy ketal, acyloxy acetal, ketal or acetal form:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, it should be understood that the equilibrium forms of the compounds of this invention may include tautomeric forms. All such forms of these compounds are expressly included in the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt should be understood that the compounds of this invention may be modified by appropriate functionalities to enhance selective biological properties. Such modifications are known in the art and include those which increase biological penetration into a given biological system (e.g., blood, lymphatic system, central nervous system), increase oral availability, increase solubility to allow administration by injection, alter metabolism and alter rate of excretion. In addition, the compounds may be altered to pro-drug form such that the desired compound is created in the body of the patient as the result of the action of metabolic or other biochemical processes on the pro-drug. Such pro-drug forms typically demonstrate little or no activity in in vitro assays. Some example of pro-drug forms include ketal, acetal, oxime, imine, and hydrazone forms of compounds which contain ketone or aldehyde groups, especially where they occur in the R\n3 \ngroup of the compounds of this invention. Other examples of pro-drug forms include the hemi-ketal, hemi-acetal, acyloxy ketal, acyloxy acetal, ketal, and acetal forms that are described in EQ1 and EQ2.\n\n\n \nICE and TX Cleave and Thereby Activate Pro-IGIF\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ICE protease was identified previously by virtue of its ability to process inactive pro-IL-1β to mature active IL-1β, a pro-inflammatory molecule, in vitro and in vivo. Here we show that ICE and its close homologue TX (Caspase-4, C. Faucheu et al., \nEMBO, \n14, p. 1914 (1995)) can proteolytically cleave inactive pro-IGIF. This processing step is required to convert pro-IGIF to its active mature form, IGIF. Cleavage of pro-IGIF by ICE, and presumably by TX, also facilitates the export of IGIF out of cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe first used transient co-expression of plasmids transfected into Cos cells to determine whether any known members of the ICE/CEO-3 protease family can process pro-IGIF to IGIF in cultured cells (Example 23) (\nFIG. 1A\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 1A\n demonstrated that ICE cleaves pro-IGIF in Cos cells co-transfected with plasmids that express pro-IGIF in the presence of active ICE. Cos cells were transfected with an expression plasmid for pro-IGIF alone (lane 2) or in combination with the indicated expression plasmids encoding wild type or inactive mutants of ICE/CEO-3 family of proteases (lanes 3-12). Cell lystates were prepared and analyzed for the presence of IGIF protein by immunoblotting with an anti-IGIF antiserum. \nLane\n 1 contained lystates from mock transfected cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCo-expression of pro-IGIF with ICE or TX resulted in the cleavage of pro-IGIF into a polypeptide similar in size to the naturally-occurring 18-kDa mature IGIF. This processing event is blocked by single point mutations that alter the catalytic cysteine residues and thus inactivate ICE and TX (Y. Gu et al., \nEMBO, \n14, p. 1923 (1995)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCo-expression with CPP32 (Caspase-3), a protease involved in programmed cell death (T. Fernandes-Alnemri et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem., \n269, p. 30761 (1994); D. W. Nicholson et al., \nNature, \n376, p. 37 (1995), resulted in the cleavage of pro-IGIF into a smaller polypeptide, while co-expression with CMH-1 (Caspase-7), a close homolog of CPP32 (J. A. Lippke et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem., \n271, p. 1825 (1996)), failed to cleave pro-IGIF to any significant extent. Thus, ICE and TX appear to be capable of cleaving pro-IGIF into a polypeptide similar in size to the naturally-occurring 18-kDa IGIF.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe next examined the ability of these cysteine proteases to cleave pro-IGIF in vitro using a purified, recombinant (His)\n6\n-tagged pro-IGIF as a substrate (Example 23).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 1B\n demonstrates that pro-IGIF is cleaved in vitro by ICE. Purified recombinant (His)\n6\n-tagged pro-IGIF (2 μg) was incubated with the indicated cysteine protease in the presence or absence of ICE or CPP32 inhibitors as described in Example 23. The cleavage products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nICE cleaved the 24 kDa pro-IGIF into two polypeptides of approximately 18-kDa and 6-kDa. N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the ICE cleavage products indicated that the 18-kDa polypeptide contains the same N-terminal amino acid residues (Asn-Phe-Gly-Arg-Leu) as the naturally occurring IGIF. This shows that ICE cleaves pro-IGIF at the authentic processing site (Asp35-Asn36) (H. Okamura et al., \nInfection and Immunity, \n63, p. 3966 (1995); H. Okamura et al., \nNature, \n378, p. 88 (1995)). N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the CPP32 cleavage products indicated that CPP32 cleaved pro-IGIF at Asp69-Ile70.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis cleavage by ICE of pro-IGIF is highly specific with a catalytic efficiently (k\ncat\n/K\nM\n) of 1.4×10\n7 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1 \n(K\nM\n=0.6±0.1 μM; k\ncat\n=8.6±0.3 s\n−1\n) and is inhibited by specific ICE inhibitors (Ac-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-aldehyde) and Cbz-Val-Ala-Asp-[(2,6-dichlorobenzoyl)oxy]methylketone, (N. A. Thornberry et al., \nNature, \n356, p. 768 (1992); R. E. Dolle et al., \nJ. Med. Chem., \n37, p. 563 (1994)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 1C\n demonstrates that ICE cleavage in vitro activates pro-IGIF. Uncleaved pro-IGIF, ICE- or CPP32-cleaved products of pro-IGIF, or recombinant mature IGIF (rIGIF) were each added to A.E7 cell cultures to a final concentration of 12 ng/ml or 120 ng/ml (see, Example 23). Eighteen hours later, IFN-γ in the cultural medium was quantified by ELISA. While the uncleaved pro-IGIF had no detectable IFN-γ inducing activity, ICE-cleaved pro-IGIF was active in inducing IFN-γ production in Thl cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLike ICE, the ICE homolog TX also cleaved pro-IGIF into similarly sized polypeptides. However, its catalytic efficiency was about two orders of magnitude lower than that shown for ICE.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConsistent with the observations from the Cos cell experiments above, CPP32 cleaved pro-IGIF at a different site (Asp69-Ile70) and the resulting polypeptides had little IFN-γ inducing activity (\nFIG. 1C\n). CMH-1 and granzyme B each failed to cleave pro-IGIF to any significant extent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTogether, these results demonstrates that, both in Cos cells and in vitro, ICE and TX are capable of processing the inactive pro-IGIF precursor at the authentic maturation site to generate a biologically active IGIF molecule.\n\n\n \nProcessing of Pro-IGIF by ICE Facilitates Its Export\n\n\n \n \n \nIGIF is produced by activated Kupffer cells and macrophages in vivo and is exported out of the cells upon stimulation by endotoxin (H. Okamura et al., \nInfection and Immunity, \n63, p. 3966 (1995); H. Okamura et al., \nNature, \n378, p. 88 (1995). We used the Cos cell co-expression system (Example 23) to examine whether the intracellular cleavage of pro-IGIF by ICE would facilitates the export of mature IGIF from the cell. Such is the case for pro-IL-1β when it is cleaved by ICE into active IL-1β (N. A. Thornberry et al., \nNature, \n356, p. 768 (1992)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn \nFIG. 2A\n, Cos cells transfected with an expression plasmid for pro-IGIF alone (\nlanes\n 2 and 6) or in combination with an expression plasmid encoding wild type (\nlanes\n 3 and 7) or inactive mutant ICE (\nlanes\n 4 and 8) were metabolically labeled with \n35\nS-methionine (see, Example 24). Cell lysates (left) and conditioned medium (right) were immunoprecipitated with an anti-IGIF antiserum. The immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography (\nFIG. 2A\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn 18-kDa polypeptide corresponding in size to mature IGIF was detected in the conditioned medium of Cos cells co-expressing pro-IGIF and ICE, while Cos cells co-expression pro-IGIF and an inactive ICE mutant (ICE-C285S), or pro-IGIF alone (−) exported only very low levels of pro-IGIF and no detectable mature IGIF. We estimate that about 10% of the mature IGIF was exported from co-transfected cells, while greater than 99% of pro-IGIF was retained within the cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe also measured the presence of IFN-γ inducing activity in cell lysates and in the conditioned medium of the above transfected cells (see, Example 24). IFN-γ inducing activity was detected in both cell lystates and the conditioned medium of Cos cells co-expressing pro-IGIF and ICE, but not in cells expressing either pro-IGIF or ICE alone (\nFIG. 2B\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese results indicate that ICE cleavage of pro-IGIF facilitates the export of mature, active IGIF from cells.\n\n\n \nPro-IGIF is a Physiological Substrate of ICE In Vivo\n\n\n \n \n \nTo study the role of ICE in the proteolytic activation and export of IGIF under physiological conditions, we examined the processing of pro-IGIF and export of mature IGIF from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated Kupffer cells harvested from Propiobacterium acnes-elicited wild type and ICE deficient (ICE−/−)mice (Example 25).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFIG. 3A\n, Kupffer cells from ICE−/−mice are defective in the export of IGIF. Kupffer cell lysates of wild type and ICE−/− mice contained similar amounts of IGIF as determined by ELISA. IGIF, however, could be detected only in the conditioned medium of wild type but not of the ICE−/− cells. Thus, ICE-deficient (ICE−/−) mice synthesize pro-IGIF, but fail to export it as extracellular pro-or mature IGIF.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo determine whether ICE-deficient (ICE−/−) mice process intracellular pro-IGIF but fail to export IGIF, Kupffer cells from wild type and ICE−/− mice were metabolically labeled with \n35\nS-methionine and IGIF immunoprecipitation experiments were performed on cell lysates and conditioned media as described in Example 25. These experiments demonstrated that unprocessed pro-IGIF was present in both wild type and ICE−/− Kupffer cells. However, the 18-kDa mature IGIF was present only in the conditioned medium of wild type and not ICE−/− Kupffer cells (\nFIG. 3B\n). This shows that active ICE is required in cells for the export of processed IGIF out of the cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, conditioned medium from wild type but not from ICE−/− Kupffer cells contained IFN-γ inducing activity that was not attributed to the action of IL-12 because it was insensitive to a neutralizing anti-IL-12 antibody. The absence of IGIF in the conditioned medium of ICE−/− Kupffer cells is consistent with the finding in Cos cells that the processing of pro-IGIF by ICE is required for the export of active IGIF.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIGS. 3C and 3D\n show that, in vivo, ICE−/− mice have reduced serum levels of IGIF and IFN-γ respectively. Wild type (ICE+/+) and ICE−/− mice (n=3) primed with heat-inactivated \nP. acnes \nwere challenged with LPS (Example 26), and the levels of IGIF (\nFIG. 3C\n) and IFN-γ (\nFIG. 3D\n) in the sera of challenged mice were measured by ELISA three hours after LPS challenge (Example 25).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe sera of ICE−/− mice stimulated by \nP. acnes \nand LPS contained reduced levels of IGIF (\nFIG. 3C\n) and no detectable IFN-γ inducing activity in the presence of an anti-IL-12 antibody. The reduced serum levels of IGIF likely accounts for the significantly lower levels of IFN-γ in the sera of ICE−/− mice (\nFIG. 3D\n), because we have observed no significant difference in the production of IL-12 in ICE−/− mice under these conditions. Consistent with this interpretation is the finding that non-adherent splenocytes from wild type and ICE−/− mice produced similar amounts of IFN-γ when stimulated with recombinant active IGIF is not due to any apparent defect in the T cells of the ICE−/− mice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTaken together, these results establish a critical role for ICE in processing the IGIF precursor and in the export of active IGIF both in vitro and in vivo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo examine in more detail the relationship between serum levels of IFN-γ and ICE activity in vivo, a time course after challenge of wild type and ICE-deficient mice with LPS was performed (Example 26) (\nFIG. 4\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 4\n shows a time course increase of serum IFN-γ in wild type mice, with sustained levels of ≧17 ng/ml occurring from 9-18 hrs after LPS challenge. As predicted by the experiments discussed above, serum IFN-γ levels were significantly lower in ICE−/− mice, with a maximum of 2 ng/ml achieved over the same time period, which is approximately 15% of the level observed in wild type mice (\nFIG. 4\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnimals were also observed for clinical signs of sepsis and body temperature was measured at 4-hour intervals in wild type and ICE−/− mice challenged with 30 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg LPS (ICE−/− only). Results in \nFIG. 4\n show that wild type mice experienced a significant decrease in body temperature (from 36° C. to 26° C.) within 12 hours of LPS challenge. Signs of clinical sepsis were evident and all animals expired within 24-28 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn contrast, ICE−/− mice challenged with 30 mg/kg LPS experienced only a 3°-4° C. decrease in body temperature with minimal signs of distress and with no observed lethality. ICE−/− mice challenged with 100 mg/kg LPS experienced clinical symptoms, a decrease in body temperature, and mortality similar to wild type mice at the 30 mg/kg LPS dose.\n\n\n \nThe ICE Inhibitor Ac-YVAD-CHO is an Equipotent Inhibitor or IL-1β and IFN-γ Production\n\n\n \n \n \nSince the processing and secretion of biologically active IGIF is mediated by ICE, we compared the activity of a reversible ICE inhibitor (Ac-YVAD-CHO) on IL-1β and IFN-γ production in a peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) assay (Examples 27).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults in \nFIG. 5\n show a similar potency for the ability of the Ac-YVAD-CHO ICE inhibitor to decrease IL-1β and IFN-γ production in human PBMCs, with an IC\n50 \nof 2.5 μM for each. Similar results were obtained in studies with wild type mouse splenocytes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese findings provide additional evidence that pro-IGIF is a physiological substrate for ICE and suggest that ICE inhibitors will be useful tools for controlling physiological levels of IGIF and IFN-γ.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn summary, we have found that ICE controls IGIF and IFN-γ levels in vivo and in vitro and that ICE inhibitors can decrease levels of IGIF and IFN-γ in human cells. These results have been described in co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 08/712,878, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \nComposition and Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions and methods of this invention will be useful for controlling IL-1, IGIF and IFN-γ levels in vivo. The methods and compositions of this invention will thus be useful for treating or reducing the advancement, severity of effects of IL-1, IGIF- and IFN-γ-mediated conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of this invention are effective legands of ICE. Accordingly, these compounds are capable of targeting and inhibiting events in IL-1-, apoptosis-, IGIF-, and IFN-γ-mediated diseases, and, thus, the ultimate activity of that protein in inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, destructive bone, proliferative disorders, infectious diseases, and degenerative diseases. For example, the compounds of this invention inhibit the conversion of precursor IL-1β to mature IL-1β by inhibiting ICE. Because ICE is essential for the production of mature IL-1, inhibition of that enzyme effectively blocks initiation of IL-1-mediated physiological effects and symptoms, such as inflammation, by inhibiting the production of mature IL-1. Thus, by inhibiting IL-1β precursor activity, the compounds of this invention effectively function as IL-1 inhibitors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilarly, compounds of this invention inhibit the conversion of precursor IGIF to mature IGIF. Thus, by inhibiting IGIF productions, the compounds of this invention effectively function as inhibitors of IFN-γ production.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, one embodiment of this invention provides a method for decreasing IGIF production in a subject comprising the step of administering to the subject a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of an ICE inhibitor and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother embodiment of this invention provides a method for decreasing IFN-γ production in a subject comprising the step of administering to the subject a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of an ICE inhibitor and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the methods of this invention comprise the step of administering to a subject a pharmaceutical composition comprising an inhibitor of an ICE-related protease that is capable of cleaving pro-IGIF to active IGIF, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. One such ICE-related protease is TX, as described above. This invention thus provides methods and pharmaceutical compositions for controlling IGIF and IFN-γ levels by administering a TX inhibitor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther ICE-related proteases capable of processing pro-IGIF into an active IGIF form may also be found. Thus it is envisioned that inhibitors of those enzymes may be identified by those of skill in the art and will also fall within the scope of this invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of this invention may be employed in a conventional manner for the treatment of diseases which are mediated by IL-1, apoptosis, IGIF or IFN-γ. Such methods of treatment, their dosage levels and requirements may be selected by those of ordinary skill in the art from available methods and techniques. For example, a compound of this invention may be combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant for administration to a patient suffering from an IL-1-, apoptosis-, IGIF- or IFN-γ-mediated disease in a pharmaceutically acceptable manner and in an amount effective to lessen the severity of that disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the compounds of this invention may be used in compositions and methods for treating or protecting individuals against IL-1-, apoptosis-, IGIF- or IFN-γ-mediated diseases over extended periods of time. The compounds may be employed in such compositions either alone or together with other compounds of this invention in a manner consistent with the conventional utilization of ICE inhibitors in pharmaceutical compositions.

Enzyme Assay with UV-visible Substrate\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis assay is run using an Succinyl-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-pNitroanilide substrate. Synthesis of analogous substrates is described by L. A. Reiter (Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 43, 87-96 (1994)). The assay mixture contains:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n65\n\n\nμl\n\n\nbuffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM DTT, 0.1% CHAPS @ pH 8.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nμl\n\n\nICE (50 nM final concentration to give a rate of ~1 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nmOD/min)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nμl\n\n\nDMSO/\nInhibitor mixture\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\n \nμl\n \n\n\n400 μm Substrate (80 μM final concentration)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n100\n\n\nμl\n\n\ntotal reaction volume\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe visible ICE assay is run in a 96-well microtiter plate. Buffer, ICE and DMSO (if inhibitor is present) are added to the wells in the order listed. The components are left to incubate at room temperature for 15 minutes starting at the time that all components are present in all wells. The microtiter plate reader is set to incubate at 37° C. After the 15 minute incubation, substrate is added directly to the wells and the reaction is monitored by following the release of the chromophore (pNA) at 405-603 nm at 37° C. for 20 minutes. A linear fit of the data is performed and the rate is calculated in mOD/min. DMSO is only present during experiments involving inhibitors, buffer is used to make up the volume to 100 μl in the other experiments.\n\n\n \n \n2. Enzyme Assay with Fluorescent Substrate\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis assay is run essentially according to Thornberry et al. (Nature 356: 768-774 (1992)), using substrate 17 referenced in that article. The substrate is: Acetyl-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC). The following components are mixed:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n65 \n\n\nμl\n\n\nbuffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM DTT, 0.1% CHAPS @ pH 8.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nμl\n\n\nICE (2-10 nM final concentration)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nμl\n\n\nDMSO/\ninhibitor solution\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\n \nμl\n \n\n\n150 μM Substrate (30 μM final)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n100\n\n\nμl\n\n\ntotal reaction volume\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe assay is run in a 96 well microtiter plate. Buffer and ICE are added to the wells. The components are left to incubate at 37° C. for 15 minutes in a temperature-controlled wellplate. After the 15 minute incubation, the reaction is started by adding substrate directly to the wells and the reaction is monitored @37° C. for 30 minutes by following the release of the AMC fluorophore using an excitation wavelength for 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. A linear fit of the data for each well is performed and a rate is determined in fluorescence units per second.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor determination of enzyme inhibition constants (K\ni\n) or the mode of inhibition (competitive, uncompetitive or noncompetitive), the rate data determined in the enzyme assays at varying inhibitor concentrations are computer-fit to standard enzyme kinetic equations (see I. H. Segel, \nEnzyme Kinetics\n, Wiley-Interscience, 1975).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe determination of second order rate constants for irreversible inhibitors was performed by fitting the fluorescence vs time data to the progress equations of Morrison. Morrison, J. F., \nMol. Cell, Biophys., \n2, pp. 347-368 (1985). Thornberry et al. have published a description of these methods for measurement of rate constants of irreversible inhibitors of ICE. Thornberry, N. A., et al. \nBiochemistry, \n33, pp. 3923-3940 (1994). For compounds where no prior complex formation can be observed kinetically, the second order rate constants (k\ninact\n) are derived directly from the slope of the linear plots of k\nobs \nvs. (I). For compounds where prior complex formation to the enzyme can be detected, the hyperbolic plots of k\nobs \nvs. (I) are fit to the equation for saturation kinetics to first generate K\ni \nand k′. The second order rate constant k\ninact \nis then given by k′/K\ni\n.\n\n\n \n3. PBMC Cell Assay\n\n\nIL-1β Assay with a Mixed Population of Human Peripheral blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) or Enriched Adherent Mononuclear Cells\n\n\n \n \n \nProcessing of pre-IL-1β by ICE can be measured in cell culture using a variety of cell sources. Human PBMC obtained from healthy donors provides a mixed population of lymphocyte subtypes and mononuclear cells that produce a spectrum of interleukins and cytokines in response to many classes of physiological stimulators. Adherent mononuclear cells from PBMC provides an enriched source of normal monocytes for selective studies of cytokine production by activated cells.\n\n\n \nExperiment Procedure\n\n\n \n \n \nAn initial dilution series of test compound in DMSO or ethanol is prepared, with a subsequent dilution into RPMI-10% FBS media (containing 2 mM L-glutamine, 10 mM HEPES, 50 U and 50 ug/ml pen/strep) respectively to yield drugs at 4× the final test concentration containing 0.4% DMSO or 0.4% ethanol. The final concentration of DMSO is 0.1% for all drug dilutions. A concentration titration which brackets the apparent K\ni \nfor a test compound determined in an ICE inhibition assay is generally used for the primary compound screen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally 5-6 compound dilutions are tested and the cellular component of the assay is performed in duplicate, with duplicate ELISA determinations on each cell culture supernatant.\n\n\n \nPBMC Isolation and IL-1 Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nBuffy coat cells isolated from one pint human blood (yielding 40-45 ml final volume plasma plus cells) are diluted with media to 80 ml and LeukoPREP separation tubes (Becton Dickinson) are each overlaid with 10 ml of cell suspension. After 15 min centrifugation at 1500-1800×g, the plasma/media layer is aspirated and then the mononuclear cell layer is collected with a Pasteur pipette and transferred to a 15 ml conical centrifuge tube (Corning). Media is added to bring the volume to 15 ml, gently mix the cells by inversion and centrifuge at 300×g for 15 min. Resuspend the PBMC pellet in a small volume of media, count cells and adjust to 6×10\n6 \ncells/ml.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the cellular assay, 1.0 ml of the cell suspension is added to each well of a 24-well flat bottom tissue culture plate (Corning), 0.5 ml test compound dilution and 0.5 ml LPS solution (Sigma #L-3012; 20 ng/ml solution prepared in complete RPMI media; \nfinal LPS concentration\n 5 ng/ml). The 0.5 ml additions of test compound and LPS are usually sufficient to mix the contents of the wells. Three control mixtures are run per experiment, with either LPS alone, solvent vehicle control, and/or additional media to adjust the final culture volume to 2.0 ml. The cell cultures are incubated for 16-18 hr at 37° C. in the presence of 5% CO\n2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt the end of the incubation period, cells are harvested and transferred to 15 ml conical centrifuge tubes. After centrifugation for 10 min at 200×g, supernatants are harvested and transferred to 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes. It may be noted that the cell pellet may be utilized for a biochemical evaluation of pre-IL-1β and/or mature IL-1β content in cytosol extracts by western blotting or ELISA with pre-IL-1β specific antisera.\n\n\n \nIsolation of Adherent Mononuclear Cells\n\n\n \n \n \nPBMC are isolated and prepared as described above. Media (1.0 ml) is first added to wells followed by 0.5 ml of the PBMC suspension. After a one hour incubation, plates are gently shaken and nonadherent cells aspirated from each well. Wells are then gently washed three times with 1.0 ml of media and final resuspended in 1.0 ml media. The enrichment for adherent cells generally yields 2.5-3.0×10\n5 \ncells per well. The addition of test compounds, LPS, cell incubation conditions and processing of supernatants proceeds as described above.\n\n\n \nELISA\n\n\n \n \n \nWe have used Quantikine kits (R&D Systems) for measurement of mature IL-1β. Assays are performed according to the manufacturer's directions. Mature IL-1β levels of about 1-3 ng/ml in both PBMC and adherent mononuclear cell positive controls are observed. ELISA assays are performed on 1:5, 1:10 and 1:20 dilutions of supernatants from LPS-positive controls to select the optimal dilution for supernatants in the test panel.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe inhibitory potency of the compounds can be represented by an IC\n50 \nvalue, which is the concentration of inhibitor at which 50% of mature IL-1β is detected in the supernatant as compared to the positive controls.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe skilled practitioner realizes that values obtained in cell assays, such as those described herein, can depend on multiple factors, such as cell type, cell source, growth conditions and the like.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 2\n\n\nPharmacokinetic Studies in the Mouse\n\n\n \n \n \nPeptidyl ICE inhibitors are cleared rapidly with clearance rates greater than 100 μ/min/kg.

M. J. Free, R. A. Jaffee; ‘Cannulation techniques for the collection blood and other bodily fluids’; in: \nAnimal Models\n; p. 480-495; N. J. Alexander, Ed.; Academic Press; (1978). Drug (10 mg/ml) was administered via the jugular vein in a vehicle usually consisting of: propylene glycol/saline, containing 100 mM sodium bicarbonate in a 1:1 ratio.

The complexity of this assay system, with its full complement of lymphoid and inflammatory cell types, spectrum of plasma proteins and red blood cells is an ideal in vitro representation of human in vivo physiologic conditions.\n\n\n \nMaterials:\n\n\n \n \n \nPyrogen-free syringes (˜30 cc)\n\n\nPyrogen-free sterile vacuum tubes containing\n\n\nlyophilized Na\n2\nEDTA (4.5 mg/10 ml tube)\n\n\nHuman whole blood sample (˜30-50 cc)\n\n\n1.5 ml eppendorf tubes\n\n\nTest compound stock solutions (˜25 mM in DMSO or other solvent)\n\n\nEndotoxin-free sodium chloride solution (0.9%) and HBSS\n\n\nLipolysaccharide (Sigma: Cat.# L-3012) stock solution at 1 mg/ml in HBSS\n\n\nIL-1β ELISA Kit (R & D Systems; Cat # DLB50) TNFα ELISA Kit (R & D Systems; Cat # DTA50) Water bath or incubator\n\n\n\n \nWhole Blood Assay Experimental Procedure:\n\n\n \n \n \nSet incubator or water bath at 30° C. Aliquot 0.25 ml of blood into 1.5 ml eppendorf tubes. Note: be sure to invert the whole blood sample tubes after every two aliquots. Differences in replicates may result if the cells sediment and are not uniformly suspended. Use of a positive displacement pipette will also minimize differences between replicate aliquots.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrepare drug dilutions in sterile pyrogen-free saline by serial dilution. A dilution series which brackets the apparent K\ni \nfor a test compound determined in an ICE inhibition assay is generally used for the primary compound screen. For extremely hydrophobic compounds, we have prepared compound dilutions in fresh plasma obtained from the same blood donor or in PBS-containing 5% DMSO to enhance solubility.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdd 25 μl test compound dilution or vehicle control and gently mix the sample. Then add 5.0 μl LPS solution (250 ng/ml stocked prepared fresh: 5.0 ng/ml final concentration LPS), and mix again. Incubate the tubes at 30° C. in a water bath for 16-18 hr with occasional mixing. Alternatively, the tubes can be placed in a rotator set at 4 rpm for the same incubation period. This assay should be set up in duplicate or triplicate with the following controls: negative control—no LPS; positive control—no test inhibitor; vehicle control—the highest concentration of DMSO or compound solvent used in the experiment. Additional saline is added to all control tubes to normalize volumes for both control and experimental whole blood test samples.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter the incubation period, whole blood samples are centrifuged for 10 minutes at ˜2000 rpm in the microfuge, plasma is transferred to a fresh microfuge tube and centrifuged at 1000×g to pellet residual platelets if necessary. Plasma samples may be stored frozen at −70° C. prior to assay for cytokine levels by ELISA.\n\n\n \nELISA:\n\n\n \n \n \nWe have used R & D Systems (614 McKinley Place N.E. Minneapolis, Minn. 55413) Quantikine kits for measurement of IL-1β and TNF-α. The assays are performed according to the manufacturer's directions. We have observed IL-1β levels of ˜1-5 ng/ml in positive controls among a range of individuals. A 1:200 dilution of plasma for all samples has been sufficient in our experiments for ELISA results to fail on the linear range of the ELISA standard curves. It may be necessary to optimize standard dilutions if you observe differences in the whole blood assay. Nerad, J. L. et al., \nJ.

Isolation of ICE Homologs\n\n\n \n \n \nExpression of TX in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system. We have subcloned Tx cDNA (Faucheu et al., supra 1995) into a modified pVL1393 transfer vector, co-transfected the resultant plasmid (pVL1393/TX) into insect cells with viral DNA and identified the recombinant baculovirus. After the generation of high titer recombinant virus stock, the medium was examined for TX activity using the visible ICE assay. Typically, infection of \nSpodoptera frugiperda \n(Sf9) insect cells at an MOI of 5 with recombinant virus stock resulted in a maximum expression after 48 hours of 4.7 μg/ml. ICE was used as a standard in the assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmino terminal T7 tagged versions of ICE or TX were also expressed. Designed originally to assist the identification and purification of the recombinant proteins, the various constructs have also allowed examination of different levels of expression and of the relative levels of apoptosis experienced by the different homologs. Apoptosis in the infected Sf9 cells (examined using a Trypan Blue exclusion assay) was increased in the lines expression ICE or TX relative to cells infected with the viral DNA alone.\n\n\n \n \nExpression and purification of N-terminally (His)\n6\n-tagged CPP32 in \nE. Coli\n. A cDNA encoding a CPP32 (Fernandes-Alnemri et al, supra 1994) polypeptide starting at Ser (29) was PCR amplified with primers that add in frame XhoI sites to both the 5′ and 3′ ends of the cDNA and the resulting XhoI fragment ligated into a Xho 1-cut pET-15b expression vector to create an in frame fusion with (his)\n6 \ntag at the n-terminus of the fusion protein. The predicted recombinant protein starts with the amino acid sequence of MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHMLE, where LVPRGS represents a thrombin cleavage site, followed by CPP32 starting at Ser (29). \nE. coli \nBL21 (DE3) carrying the plasmid were grown to log phase at 30° C. and were then induced with 0.8 mM IPTG. Cells were harvested two hours after IPTG addition. Lysates were prepared and soluble proteins were purified by Ni-agarose chromatography. All of the expressed CPP32 protein was in the processed form. N-terminal sequencing analysis indicated that the processing occurred at the authentic site between Asp (175) and Ser (176). Approximately 50 μg of CPP32 protein from 200 ml culture. As determined by active site titration, the purified proteins were fully active. The protease preparation were also very active in vitro in cleaving PARP as well as the synthetic DEVD-AMC substrate (Nicholson et al, supra 1995).\n\n\n \n2. Inhibition of ICE Homologs\n\n\n \n \n \nThe selectivity of a panel of reversible inhibitors for ICE homologs is depicted in Table 1. ICE enzyme assays were performed according to Wilson et al (supra 1994) using a YVAD-AMC substrate (Thornberry et al, supra 1992). Assay of TX activity was performed using the ICE substrate under identical conditions to ICE. Assay of CPP32 was performed using a DEVD-AMC substrate (Nicholson et al., supra 1995). In general, there is low selectivity between ICE and TX for a wide range of scaffolds. None of the synthetic ICE compounds tested are effective inhibitors of CPP32.

Results in \nFIG. 8\n show that 214e, but not 217e when administered orally inhibited IL-1β secretion, suggesting potential for oral efficacy of ICE inhibitors as anti-inflammatory agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe efficacy of analogs of 214e were also evaluated in LPS challenged mice after IP administration (\nFIG. 9\n) and PO administration (\nFIG. 10\n).\n\n\n \n \nTable 3 % Inhibition of IL-β production by analogs of 214e in LPs-challenged mice after PO and IP administration (50 mg/kg).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPO %\n\n\nIP %\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCompound\n \n \nInhibition\n\n\nInhibition\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 214e\n\n\n75\n\n\n78\n\n\n\n\n\n\n265\n\n\n27\n\n\n30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n416\n\n\n52\n\n\n39\n\n\n\n\n\n\n434\n\n\n80\n\n\n74\n\n\n\n\n\n\n438\n\n\n13\n\n\n40\n\n\n\n\n\n\n442\n\n\n10\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2002 \n\n\n—\n\n\n78\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison of 214e Prodrugs for\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEfficacy in LPS Challenged Mice:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime Course Inhibition of IL-1β Production\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTime of Compound Administration\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(relative to time of LPS challenge,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPO, 50 mg/kg\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound\n\n\n−2 hr\n\n\n−1 \nhr\n \n\n\n0 hr\n\n\n+1 \nhr\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n 214e\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n   55%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n39*\n\n\n—*\n\n\n 80*\n\n\n 75*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n43*\n\n\n 44*\n\n\n 48*\n\n\n 11*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—*\n\n\n—*\n\n\n—*\n\n\n 47*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n 304a\n\n\n30 \n\n\n33\n\n\n68\n\n\n37\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2100e\n\n\n49 \n\n\n54\n\n\n94\n\n\n66\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2100a\n\n\n8\n\n\n71\n\n\n67\n\n\n58\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n 213e\n\n\n0\n\n\n48\n\n\n41\n\n\n89\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n 302\n\n\n0\n\n\n27\n\n\n21\n\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2100c\n\n\n0\n\n\n 0\n\n\n85\n\n\n40\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2100d\n\n\n42 \n\n\n35\n\n\n52\n\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2100b\n\n\n0\n\n\n 0\n\n\n47\n\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2001\n\n\n~63 \n\n\n~62 \n\n\n~57 \n\n\n~54 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n64*\n\n\n 62*\n\n\n 58*\n\n\n 55*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Values obtained in subsequent assays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 8\n\n\nMeasurement of Blood Levels of Prodrugs of 214e\n\n\n \n \n \nMice were administered a p.o. dose of \ncompounds\n 302 and 304a (50 mg/kg) prepared in 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose. blood samples were collected at 1 and 7 hours after dosing.

Synthesis of 614. TentaGel S® NH\n2 \nresin (0.16 mmol/g, 10.0 g) was placed in a sintered glass funnel and washed with dimethylformamide (3×50 mL). 10% (v/v) diisopropylethylamine (DIEA) in dimethylformamide (2×50 mL) and finally with dimethylformamide (4×50 mL). Sufficient dimethylformamide was added to the resin to obtain a slurry followed by 400 (1.42 g, 2.4 mmol, prepared from (3S) 3-(fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl)-4-oxobutryic acid t-butyl ester according to A. M. Murphy et. al. \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc., \n114, 3156-3157 (1992)), 1-hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate (HOBT H\n2\nO; 0.367 g, 2.4 mmol), O-benzotriazole-N,N,N,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU; 0.91 g, 2.4 mmol), and DIEA (0.55 mL, 3.2 mmol). The reaction mixture was agitated overnight at room temperature using a wrist arm shaker. The resin was isolated on a sintered glass funnel by suction filtration and washed with dimethylformamide (3×50 mL). Unreacted amine groups were then capped by reacting the resin with 20% (v/v) acetic anhydride/dimethylformamide (2×25 mL) directly in the funnel (10 min/wash). The resin was washed with dimethylformamide (3×50 mL) and dichloromethane (3×50 mL) prior to drying overnight in vacuo to yield 614 (11.0 g, quantitative yield).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStep B. Synthesis of 616. Resin 614 (3.0 g, 0.16 mmol/g, 0.48 mol) was swelled in a sintered glass funnel by washing with dimethylformamide (3×15 mL). The Fmoc protecting group was then cleaved with 25% (v/v) piperidine/dimethylformamide (15 mL) for 10 min (intermittent stirring) and then for 20 min with fresh piperidine reagent (15 ml). The resin was then washed with dimethylformamide (3×15 ml), followed by N-methypyrrolidone (2×15 mL). After transferring the resin to a 100 mL flask, N-methypyrrolidone was added to obtain a slurry followed by 603u (0.736 g, 0.72 mmol), HOBT′H\n2\nO (0.112 g, 0.73 mmol), HBTU (0.27 g, 0.73 mmol) and DIEA (0.26 mL, 1.5 mmol). The reaction mixture was agitated overnight at room temperature using a wrist arm shaker. The resin work-up and capping with 20% (v/v) acetic anhydride in dimethylformamide were performed as described for 614 to yield 616 (3.13 g, quantitative yield).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStep C. Synthesis of 617. This compound was prepared from resin 616 (0.24 g, 0.38 mmol) using an Advanced ChemTech 396 Multiple Peptide synthesizer. The automated cycles consisted of a resin wash with dimethylformamide (3×1 mL), deprotection with 25% (v/v) piperidine in dimethylformamide (1 mL) for 3 min followed by fresh reagent (1 mL) for 10 min to yield resin 617. The resin was washed with dimethylformamide (3×1 mL) and N-methypyrrolidone (3×1 mL).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nStep D. Method\n 1. (624). Resin 617 was acylated with a solution of 0.4M thiophene-3-carboxylic acid and 0.4M HOBT in N-methypyrrolidone (1 mL), a solution of 0.4M HBTU in N-methylpyrrolidone (0.5 mL) and a solution of 1.6M DIEA in N-methypyrrolidone (0.35 mL) and the reaction was shaken for 2 hr at room temperature. The acylation step was repeated. Finally, the resin was washed with dimethylformamide (3×1 mL), dichloromethane (3×1 mL) and dried in vacuo. The aldehyde was cleaved from the resin and globally deprotected by treatment with 95% TFA/5% H2O (v/v, 1.5 mL) for 30 min at room temperature. After washing the resin with cleavage reagent (1mL), the combined filtrates were added to cold 1:1 ether:pentane (12 mL) and the resulting precipitate was isolated by centrifugation and decantation. The resulting pellet was dissolved in 10% acetonitrile/90% H2O/0.1% TFA (15 mL) and lyophilized to obtain crude 624 as a white powder. The compound was purified by semi-prep RP-HPLC with a Rainin Microsorb™ C18 column (5 u, 21.4×250 mm), eluting with a linear acetonitrile gradient (5%-45%) containing 0.1% TFA (v/v) over 45 min at 12 mL/min. Fractions containing the desired product were pooled and lyophilized to provide 624 (10.0 mg, 54%).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStep D. Method 1A. Synthesis of 627.

Chick sternum Type II collagen (4 mg/kg in 10 mM acetic acid) was emulsified with an equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA) by repeated passages (400) between two 10 ml glass syringes with a \ngauge\n 16 double-hub needle. Mice were immunized by intradermal injection (50 μl; 100 μl CII per mouse) of \ncollagen emulsion\n 21 days later at the contra-lateral side of the tail base. Drugs were administered twice a day (10, 25 and 50 mg/kg) by oral gavage approximately 7 h apart. Vehicles used included ethanol/PEG/water, β-cyclodextrin, labrosol/water or cremophor/water. Drug treatments were initiated within 2 h of the CII booster immunization. Inflammation was scored on a 1 to 4 scale of increasing severity on the two front paws and the scores are added to give the final score.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults in the \nFIGS. 12\n, \n13\n and \n14\n show prodrugs 412f, 412d and 696a inhibit inflammation in collagen-induced arthritis in mice after oral administration.

Blood samples were drawn from the carotid artery at 0.25, 0.50, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 hours after dosing, centrifuged to plasma and stored at −70° C. until analysis. Aldehyde concentrations were determined using an enzymatic assay. Pharmacokinetic analysis of data was performed by non-linear regression using RStrip (MicroMath Software, UT). Drug availability values were determined as follows: (AUC of drug after oral prodrug dosing/AUC of drug after i.v. dosing of drug)×(dose i.v./dose p.o.)×100%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults in Table 21 show that prodrugs 412f, 412d and 696a give significant blood levels of drug and have good drug availability when dosed orally.

Okamura et al., Nature, 378, p. 88 (1995) was ligated into the mammalian expression vector pCDLSRα (Y. Takebe et al., \nMol. Cell Biol., \n8, p. 466 (1988)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, plasmids (3 μg) encoding active ICE (above), or the three ICE-related enzymes TX, CPP32, and CMH-1 in the pCDLSRα expression vector (C. Faucheu et al., \nEMBO, \n14, p. 1914 (1995); Y. Gu et al., \nEMBO, \n14, p. 1923 (1995); J. A. Lippke et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem., \n271, p. 1825 (1996), were transfected into subconfluent monolayers of Cos cells in 35-mm dishes using the DEAE-dextran method (Y. Gu et al., \nEMBO J., \n14, p. 1923 (1995)). Twenty-four hours later, cells were lysed and the lysates subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using an antiserum specific for IGIF (H. Okamura et al., \nNature, \n378, p. 88 (1995).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolymerase chain reaction was used to introduce Nde I sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the murine pro-IGIF cDNA using the following primers: GGAATTCCATATGGCTGCCATGTCAGAAGAC (forward) and GGTTAACCATATGCTAACTTTGATGTAAGTTAGTGAG (reverse). The resulting NdeI fragment was ligated into \nE. coli \nexpression vector pET-15B (Novagen) at the NdeI site to create a plasmid that directs the synthesis of a polypeptide of 213 amino acids consisting of a 21-residue peptide (MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHM, where LVPRGS represents a thrombin cleavage site) fused in-frame to the N-terminus of pro-IGIF at Ala2, as confirmed by DNA sequencing of the plasmid and by N-terminal sequencing of the expressed proteins. \nE. coli \nstrain BL21 (DE3) carrying the plasmid was induced with 0.8 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside for 1.5 hours at 37° C., harvested, and lysed by microfluidization (Microfluidic, Watertown, Mass.) in Buffer A. (20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 300 mM NaCl, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin). Lysates were cleaved by centrifugation at 100,000×g for 30 min. (His)6-tagged pro-IGIF protein was then purified from the supernatant by Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) chromatography under conditions recommended by the manufacturer.\n\n\n \n \nIn Vitro pro-IGIF Cleavage Reactions\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn vitro cleavage reactions (30 μl) contained 2 μg of purified pro-IGIF and various concentrations of the purified proteases in a buffer containing 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF and 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin and were incubated for 1 hour at 37° C. Conditions for cleavage by granzyme B were as described previously (Y. Gu et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem., \n271, p. 10816 (1996). Cleavage products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 16% gels and Coomassie Blue staining, and were subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing using an ABI automated peptide sequencer under conditions recommended by the manufacturer.\n\n\n \nKinetic Parameters of IGIF Cleavage by ICE\n\n\n \n \n \nthe kinetic parameters (k\ncat\n/K\nM\n, K\nM\n, and k\ncat\n) for IGIF cleavage by ICE were determined as follows. \n35\nS-methionine-labeled pro-IGIF (3000 cpm, prepared by in vitro transcription and translation using, the TNT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) and pro-IGIF cDNA in a pSP73 vector as template) were incubated in reaction mixtures of 60 μl containing 0.1 to 1 nM recombinant ICE and 190 nM to 12 μM of unlabeled pro-IGIF for 8-10 min at 37° C. cleavage product concentrations were determined by SDS-PAGE and PhosphoImager analyses. The Kinetic parameters were calculated by nonlinear regression fitting of the rate vs. concentration data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the program Enzfitter (Biosoft).\n\n\n \nIFN-γ Induction Assays\n\n\n \n \n \nA.E7 Th1 cells (H. Quill and R. H. Schwartz, \nJ. Immunol., \n138, p. 3704 (1987)) (1.3×10\n5 \ncells in 0.15 ml Click's medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol and 50 units/ml IL-2) in 96-well plates were treated with IGIF for 18-20 hours and the culture supernatant were assayed for IFN-γ by ELISA (Endogen, Cambridge, Mass).\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 24\n\n\nProcessing of pro-IGIF by ICE In Cos Cells\n\n\n \n \n \nCos cells were transfected with various expression plasmid combinations as described in Example 23. Transfected Cos cells (3.5×10\n5 \ncells in a 35-nm dish) were labeled for 7 hours with 1 ml of methionine-free DMEM containing 2.5% normal DMEM, 1% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 300 μCi/ml \n35\nS-methionine (\n35\nS-Express Protein Labeling-Mix, New England Nuclear). Cell lysates (prepared in 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mM N-ethylmaleimide, 1 mM PMSF, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptine) or conditioned medium were immunoprecipitated with an antiIGIF antibody that recognizes both the precursor and the mature forms of IGIF (H. Okamura et al., \nNature, \n378, p. 88 (1995)). Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and fluorography (\nFIG. 2A\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe also measured the presence of IFN-γ inducing activity in the cell lysates and the conditioned media of transfected cells (\nFIG. 2B\n). Transfected Cos cells (3.5×10\n5 \ncells in a 35-nm dish) were grown in 1 ml medium for 18 hours. Media was harvested and used at 1:10 final dilution in the IFN-γ induction assay (Example 23). Cos cell pellets from the same transfection were lysed in 100 μl of 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, by freeze-\nthawing\n 3 times. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation as described above and were used at a 1:10 dilution in the assay.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 25\n\n\nIGIF is a Physiological Substrate of ICE\n\n\n \n \n \nWild type (ICE+/+) and ICE −/− mice were primed with heat-inactivated \nP. acnes\n, and Kupffer cells were isolated from these \nmice\n 7 days after priming and were then challenged with 1 μg/ml LPS for 3 hours. The amounts of IGIF in the conditioned media were measured by ELISA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWild type of ICE-deficient mice were injected intraperitoneally with heat-killed \np. acens \nas described (H. Okamura et al., \nInfection and Immunity, \n63, p. 3966 (1995)). Kupffer cells were prepared seven days later according to Tsutsui et al. (H. Tsutsui et al., \nHepato\n-\nGastroenterol., \n39, p. 553 (1992)) except a nycodenz gradient was used instead of metrizamide. For each experiment, Kupffer cells from 2-3 animals were pooled and cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1 μg/ml LPS. Cell lysates and conditioned medium were prepared 3 hours later.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nKupffer cells from wild type and ICE−/− mice were metabolically labeled with \n35\nS-methionine as for Cos cells (described above in Example 24) except that methionine-free RPMI 1640 was used in place of DMEM. IGIF immunoprecipitation experiments were performed on cell lysates and conditioned media and immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography as described in Example 23. See \nFIG. 3\n.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 26\n\n\nInduction of IFN-γ Production In Vivo\n\n\n \n \n \nLPS mixed with 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose in PBS, pH 7.4, was administered to mice by interperitoneal injection (30 mg/kg LPS) in a dose volume of 10 ml/kg. Blood was collected every 3 h for 24 h from groups of three ICE-deficient or wild type mice. Serum IFN-γ levels were determined by ELISA (Endogen).\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 27\n\n\nIGIF and IFN-γ Inhibition Assays\n\n\n \n \n \nInhibition of IGIF processing by ICE inhibitors was measured in ICE inhibition assays as described herein (see Example 1 and Table 22).\n\n\n \nHuman PBMC Assays\n\n\n \n \n \nHuman buffy coat cells were obtained from blood donors and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated by centrifugation in LeukoPrep tubes (Becton-Dickinson, Lincoln Park, N.J.). PBMC were added (3×10\n6\n/well) to 24 well Corning tissue culture plates and after 1 hr incubation at 37° C., non-adherent cells were removed by gently washing. Adherent mononuclear cells were stimulated with LPS (1 μg/ml) with or without ICE inhibitor in 2 ml RPMI-1640-10% FBS. After 16-18 hr incubation at 37° C., IGIF and IFN-γ were quantitated in culture supernatants by ELISA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, we obtained the following data for compound 412 of this invention using the methods described herein.

After 10 minutes, the above reaction mixture is optionally concentrated, the a solution of acid A-I or A-II in CH\n2\nCl\n2 \n(or DMF, or CH\n2\nCl\n2\n:DMF (1:1)) is added followed by addition of HOBT (1.1 equivalent) and EDC (1.1 equivalent). The resulting reaction mixture is allowed to stir at \nambient temperature\n 1 hour-48 hours to provide coupled products C-I or C-II.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious nucleophilic scavengers may be used in the above process. Merzouk and Guibe, \nTetrahedron Letters, \n33, pp. 477-480 (1992); Guibe and Balavoine, \nJournal of Organiz Chemistry, \n52, pp. 4984-4993. (1987)). Preferred nucleophilic scavengers that may be used include: dimedone, morpholine, trimethylsilyl dimethylamine and dimethyl barbituric acid. More preferred nuclophilic scavengers are trimethylsilyl dimethylamine (2-5 equivalents) and dimethyl barbituric (5-50 equivalents). When the nucleophilic scavenger is trimethylsilyl dimethylamine, the above reaction mixture must be concentrated prior to addition of A-I or A-II.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther compounds of this invention may be prepared by hydrolyzing compounds represented by C-I and C-II to compounds represented by H-I and H-II as described in the following scheme:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nThe hydrolysis may be carried out under various conditions, provided that the condition include an acid and H\n2\nO.

Synthesis of 401. TentaGel S® NH\n2 \nresin (0.25 mmol/g, 5.25 g) was placed in a sintered glass shaker vessel and washed with dimethylacetamide (3×15 mL). Compound 400 (1.36 g, 2.3 mmol) was dissolved in DMA (10 mL) and O-benzotriazole-N,N,N,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU; 0.88 g, 2.3 mmol), and DIEA (0.8 mL, 4.6 mmol) were added. The solution was transferred to the resin and a further 5 mL DMA added. The reaction mixture was agitated for 1.5 h at room temperature using a wrist arm shaker. The resin was filtered and washed with dimethylacetamide (4×15 mL).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStep B. Synthesis of 1102. Resin 401 was deprotected with 20% (v/v) piperidine/dimethylacetamide (15 mL) for 10 min (shaking) and then for 10 min with fresh piperidine reagent (15 ml). The resin was then washed with dimethylacetamide (6×15 ml), followed by N-methypyrrolidone (2×25 mL).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompound 1101 (0.979 g, 2.11 mmol) was dissolved in dimethylacetamide (8 mL). HBTU (0.81 g, 2.1 mmol) and DIEA (0.75 mL, 4.3 mmol) were added and the solution added to the resin, followed by dimethylacetamide (4 mL). The reaction mixture was agitated for 2 h at room temperature using a wrist arm shaker. The resin work-up was performed as described for 401 to yield 1102.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStep C. Synthesis of 1103. This compound was prepared from resin 1102 (0.040 mmol) using an Advanced ChemTech 396 Multiple Peptide synthesizer. The automated cycles consisted of a resin wash with dimethylformamide (2×1 mL), deprotection with 25% (v/v) piperidine in dimethylformamide (1 mL) for 3 min followed by fresh reagent (1 mL) for 10 min to yield resin 1103. The resin was washed with dimethylformamide (3×1 mL) and N-methypyrrolidone (3×1 mL).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResin 1103 was acylated with a solution of 0.4M carboxylic acid and 0.4M HOBT in N-methypyrrolidone (0.5 mL), a solution of 1.6M DIEA in N-methypyrrolidone (0.25 mL) and the reaction was shaken for 2 hr at room temperature. The acylation step was repeated. Finally, the resin was washed with N-methylpyrrolidone (1×1 mL), dimethylformamide (4×1 mL), dichloromethane (5×1 mL) and dried in vacuo. The aldehyde was cleaved from the resin and globally deprotected by treatment with 95% TFA/5% H\n2\nO (v/v, 1.5 mL) for 30 min at room temperature. After washing the resin with cleavage reagent (1 mL), the combined filtrates were added to cold 1:1 ether:hexane (10 mL) and the resulting precipitate was isolated by centrifugation and decantation. The resulting pellet was dissolved in 10% acetonitrile/90% H\n2\nO/0.1% TFA (5 mL) and lyophilized to obtain crude 1105-1125 as a white powder. The compound was purified by semi-preparative RP-HPLC with a Rainin Microsorb™ C18 column (5 μ, 21.4×250 mm) eluting with a linear acetonitrile gradient (8%-48%) containing 0.1% TFA (v/v) over 30 min at 12 mL/min.

Synthesis of 401. \nTentaGel\n 5® NH\n2 \nresin (0.25 mmol/g, 6.8 g) was placed in a glass shaker vessel and washed with dimethylacetamide (3×20 mL). To a solution of 400 (1.70 g, 2.9 mmol, prepared from (3S) 3-(fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl)-4-oxobutryic acid t-butyl ester according to A. M. Murphy et al. \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc., \n114, 3156-3157 (1992)) in dimethylacetamide (15 mL) was added O-benzotriazole-N,N,N,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU; 1.09 g, 2.9 mmol), and DIEA (1.0 mL, 5.7 mmol). The solution was added to the resin, followed by dimethylacetamide (5 mL). The reaction mixture was agitated for 3 h at room temperature using a wrist arm shaker. The resin was isolated by suction filtration and washed with dimethylacetamide (6×20 mL). A sample of resin (7.4 mg) was thoroughly washed with 50% methanol in dichloromethane and dried under suction. Deprotection of the Fmoc group using 20% piperidine in dimethylacetamide (10.0 mL) and UV analysis of the solution revealed a substitution of 0.19 mmol g\n−1\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStep B. Synthesis of 903. Resin 401 was deprotected with 20% (v/v) piperidine/dimethylacetamide (20 mL) for 10 min (shaking) and then for 10 min with fresh piperidine reagent (20 ml). The resin was then washed with dimethylacetamide (6×20 ml). A solution of 902 (1.52 g, 2.81 mmol) was treated with HBTU (1.07 g, 2.83 mmol) and DIEA (1.0 mL, 5.7 mmol) and transferred to the resin, followed by dimethylacetamide (5 mL). The reaction mixture was agitated for 2.5 h at room temperature using a wrist arm shaker. The resin was isolated by suction filtration and washed with dimethylacetamide (4×20 mL) and dichloromethane (4×20 mL), and dried under nitrogen purge. Resin substitution was performed as described for 401 and determined to be 0.169 mmol g\n−1\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStep C. Synthesis of 905. Resin 903 (7.54 g, 1.27 mmol) and dimedone (2.19 g, 15.6 mmol) were placed in a 100 mL round bottomed flask and freshly distilled anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (60 mL) was added. Tetrakis (triphenylphosphine)palladium (0) (0.32 g, 0.28 mmol) was added and the nitrogen blanketed, sealed reaction was agitated for 15 h on a wrist action shaker. The resin was filtered, washed with dimethylacetamide (4×20 mL), dichloromethane (4×20 mL) and dimethylacetamide (1×20 mL). Sufficient dimethylacetamide was added to the resin to obtain a slurry followed by pyridine (1.5 mL, 18.5 mmol) and a solution of 904 (5.5 mmol) in dichloromethane (10 mL). The reaction was shaken under nitrogen for 8 h, then filtered. The resin was washed with dimethylacetamide (5×20 mL) and dichloromethane (5×20 mL).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStep D. Synthesis of 906. This compound was prepared from resin 905 (0.24 g, 0.038 mmol) using an Advanced ChemTech 396 Multiple Peptide synthesizer. The automated cycles consisted of a resin wash with dimethylformamide (3×1 mL), deprotection with 25% (v/v) piperidine in dimethylformamide (1 mL) for 10 min followed by fresh reagent (1 mL) for 20 min to yield resin 906. The resin was washed with dimethylformamide (3×1 mL) and N-methypyrrolidone (3×1 mL).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStep E. (910-922) Resin 906 was acylated with a solution of 0.4M carboxylic acid and 0.4M HOBT in N-methypyrrolidone (0.5 mL), a solution of 0.4M HBTU in N-methylpyrrolidone (0.5 mL) and a solution of 1.6M DIEA in N-methypyrrolidone (0.25 mL) and the reaction was shaken for 2 hr at room temperature. The resin was washed with N-methylpyrrolidone (1×1 mL), dimethylformamide (4×1 mL), 50% methanol in dichloromethane (5×1 mL) and dried in air. The aldehyde was cleaved from the resin and globally deprotected by treatment with 95% TFA/5% H\n2\nO (v/v, 1.5 mL) for 30 min at room temperature. After washing the resin with cleavage reagent (2×1 mL), the combined filtrates were added to cold 1:1 ether:hexane (35 mL) and the resulting precipitate was isolated by centrifugation and decantation. The resulting pellet was dissolved in acetonitrile (0.5 mL) and H\n2\nO (0.5 mL) and filtered through 0.45 micron microcentrifuge filters. The compound was purified by semi-preparative RP-HPLC with a Rainin Microsorb® C18 column (5 μ, 21.4×250 mm) eluting with a linear acetonitrile gradient (10%-50%) containing 0.1% TFA (v/v) over 30 min at 12 mL/min.

Description\n\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nI. Angiogenesis\n\n\n \n \n \nAngiogenesis, also called neovascularization, involves the formation of sprouts from preexistent blood vessels and their invasion into surrounding tissue. During angiogenesis, vascular endothelial cells re-enter the cell cycle, degrade underlying basement membrane, and migrate to form new capillary sprouts. These cells then differentiate, and mature vessels are formed. This process of growth and differentiation is regulated by a balance of pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors. A related process, vasculogenesis, involves the differentiation of endothelial cells and angioblasts that are already present throughout a tissue, and their subsequent linking together to form blood vessels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAngiogenesis occurs extensively during development, and also occurs in the healthy body during wound healing in order to restore blood flow to tissues after injury or insult. Angiogenesis, however, has also been implicated in the development of certain diseases, including cancer and tumor formation. Indeed, the quantity of blood vessels in a tumor tissue is a strong negative prognostic indicator in breast cancer (Weidner et al., \nJ. Natl. Cancer Inst. \n84:1875-1887, 1992), prostate cancer (Weidner et al., \nAm. J. Pathol. \n143:401-409, 1993), brain tumors (Li et al., \nLancet \n344:82-86, 1994), and melanoma (Foss et al., \nCancer Res. \n56:2900-2903, 1996). Angiogenesis has also recently been implicated in other disease states in many areas of medicine, including rheumatology, dermatology, cardiology and ophthalmology. In particular, undesirable or pathological tissue-specific angiogenesis has been associated with certain specific disease states including, for example, rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, psoriasis, diabetic retinopathy, and macular degeneration. (See, e.g., Fan et al., \nTrends Pharmacol. Sci. \n16:57, 1995; Folkman, \nNature Med. \n1:27, 1995.) Furthermore, the alteration of vascular permeability is thought to play a role in both normal and pathological physiological processes (Cullinan-Bove et al., \nEndocrinol. \n133:829, 1993; Senger et al., \nCancer and Metastasis Reviews \n12:303, 1993). Although the angiogenic process in each of these diseases is likely to share many features with developmental angiogenesis and tumor angiogenesis, each may also have unique aspects conferred by the influence of surrounding cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMultiple molecular mediators of angiogenesis have been identified including basic and acidic fibroblast growth factors (aFGF, bFGF), transforming growth factors alpha and beta (TGFα, TGFβ), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), angiogenin, platelet-derived endothelial cell, growth factor (PD-ECGF), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Other stimulators implicated in angiogenesis include angiopoietin-1, Del-1, follistatin, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), leptin, midkine, placental growth factor, pleiotrophin (PTN), progranulin, proliferin, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). In addition, control of angiogenesis is further mediated by a number of negative regulators of angiogenesis produced by the body including angioarrestin, angiostatin (plasminogen fragment), antiangiogenic antithrombin III, cartilage-derived inhibitor (CDI), CD59 complement fragment, endostatin (collagen XVIII fragment), fibronectin fragment, gro-beta, heparinases, heparin hexasaccharide fragment, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), interferon alpha/beta/gamma, interferon inducible protein (IP-10), interleukin-12, kringle 5 (plasminogen fragment), metalloproteinase inhibitors (TIMPs), 2-methoxyestradiol, placental ribonuclease inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor, platelet factor-4 (PF4), prolactin 16 kD fragment, proliferin-related protein (PRP), retinoids, tetrahydrocortisol-S, thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), vasculostatin, and vasostatin (calreticulin fragment).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmong these angiogenic regulators, VEGF appears to play a key role as a positive regulator of the abnormal angiogenesis accompanying tumor growth (reviewed in Brown et al., \nControl of Angiogenesis \n(Goldberg and Rosen, eds., 1996); Birkhauser et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n271:603-606, 1996). Furthermore, recently the role of the PDGF family of signaling molecules has been under investigation, since it appears to play a role in the formation, expansion and proper function of perivascular cells, sometimes referred to as mural cells, e.g., vascular smooth muscle, mesangial cells, and pericytes.\n\n\n \nII. VEGF-A\n\n\n \n \n \nVEGF-A (polynucleotide and polypeptide sequences shown in SEQ ID NOs: 1 and 2, respectively) is a secreted, disulfide-linked homodimeric glycoprotein belonging to the VEGF/PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor) group of the cystine-knot superfamily of hormones and extracellular signaling molecules (see Vitt et al., \nMol. Endocrinol., \n15:681-694, 2001), which are all characterized by the presence of eight conserved cysteine residues forming the typical cystine-knot structure (named after cystine, a dimer of two cysteines linked by a disulfide bond). Five human VEGF-A isoforms of 121, 145, 165, 189 or 206 amino acids in length (VEGF-A\n121-206\n), encoded by distinct mRNA splice variants, have been described, all of which are capable of stimulating mitogenesis in endothelial cells. These isoforms differ in biological activity, receptor specificity, and affinity for cell surface- and extracellular matrix-associated heparan-sulfate proteoglycans, which behave as low affinity receptors for VEGF-A: VEGF-A\n121 \ndoes not bind to either heparin or heparan-sulfate; VEGF-A\n145 \nand VEGF-A\n165 \n(GenBank Acc. No. M32977) are both capable of binding to heparin; and VEGF-A\n189 \nand VEGF-A\n206 \nshow the strongest affinity for heparin and heparan-sulfates. VEGF-A\n121\n, VEGF-A\n145\n, and VEGF-A\n165 \nare secreted in a soluble form, although most of VEGF-A\n165 \nis confined to cell surface and extracellular matrix proteoglycans, whereas VEGF-A\n189 \nand VEGF-A\n206 \nremain associated with extracellular matrix. Both VEGF-A\n189 \nand VEGF-A\n206 \ncan be released by treatment with heparin or heparinase, indicating that these isoforms are bound to extracellular matrix via proteoglycans. Cell-bound VEGF-A\n180 \ncan also be cleaved by proteases such as plasmin, resulting in release of an active soluble VEGF-A\n110\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMost tissues that express VEGF-A are observed to express several VEGF-A isoforms simultaneously, although VEGF-A\n121 \nand VEGF-A\n165 \nare the predominant forms, whereas VEGF-A\n206 \nis rarely detected (see Ferrara, \nJ. Mol. Med. \n77:527-543, 1999). VEGF-A\n145 \ndiffers in that it is primarily expressed in cells derived from reproductive organs (see Neufeld et al., \nFASEB J. \n13:9-22, 1999). Human VEGF-A\n165\n, the most abundant and biologically active form, is glycosylated at Asn74 and is typically expressed as a 46 kDa homodimer of 23 kDa subunits.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFour cell-surface receptors that interact with VEGF-A have been identified. These include VEGFR-1/Flt-1 (fins-like tyrosine kinase-1; GenBank Acc. No. X51602; De Vries et al., \nScience \n255:989-991, 1992); VEGFR-2/KDR/Flk-1 (kinase insert domain containing receptor/fetal liver kinase-1; GenBank Acc. Nos. X59397 (Flk-1) and L04947 (KDR); Terman et al., \nBiochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. \n187:1579-1586, 1992; Matthews et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n88:9026-9030, 1991); neuropilin-1 (Gen Bank Acc.

Cell Res. \n253:117-130, 1999.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVEGF-A-driven angiogenesis has a major role in the pathogenesis of diverse human diseases, including cancer, eye disorders, and rheumatoid arthritis. See Carmeliet et al., \nNature \n407:249-257, 2000. Recognition of the importance of VEGF-A for the development of several important classes of cancer recently culminated in the approval of AVASTIN™, a humanized monoclonal antibody to VEGF-A, for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. See Ferrara et al., \nNat. Rev. Drug Discov. \n2004, 3:391-400, 2004. Similarly, the importance of VEGF-A in the pathogenesis of neovascular ocular disorders is reflected in the recent approval of LUCENTIS™, a humanized monoclonal antibody fragment, for the treatment of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD).\n\n\n \nIII. PDGFRβ\n\n\n \n \n \nPDGFRβ (platelet-derived growth factor receptor β; polynucleotide and polypeptide sequences shown in SEQ ID NOs. 3 and 4, respectively) is one of two structurally related cell surface receptor tyrosine kinases (PDGFRα and PDGFRβ) mediating the biological activities of various platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) isoforms—PDGF-A, -B, -C, and -D. PDGFs belong to the PDGF/VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) family, which, as previously indicated, is characterized by the presence of eight conserved cysteine residues forming the typical cystine-knot structure. Two forms of the PDGF-A chain, containing 196 and 211 amino acid residues resulting from differential splicing of the transcript, are synthesized, dimerized, proteolytically processed in the N-terminus, and secreted from the cell as a ˜30 kDa dimer (Bonthron et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n85:1492-1496, 1988; Rorsman et al., \nMol. Cell. Biol. \n8:571-577, 1988). The PDGF-B chain encoding 241 amino acid residues is dimerized, processed by additional proteolysis, and secreted as a 24 kDa dimer (Ostman et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n263:16202-16208, 1988; Ostman et al., \nJ. Cell. Biol. \n118:509-519, 1992). The A and B chains are capable of forming both homodimers and heterodimers with each other (PDGF-AA, -BB, and -AB). The full-length PDGF-C and -D proteins contain 345 and 370 amino acid residues respectively, and both have a unique two-domain structure with a N-terminal CUB domain and a C-terminal PDGF/VEGF domain. Proforms of PDGF C and D are secreted as an approximately 85 kDa homodimer after cleavage of the N-terminal 22 signal peptide residues. Whereas secreted PDGF-AA, -BB, and -AB can readily activate their cell surface receptors, proteolytic removal of the CUB domain is required for the growth factor domain of PDGF-CC and -DD homodimers to activate the cell surface receptors\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBoth PDGFRs (PDGFRα and PDGFRβ) contain five extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembrane domain, a juxtamembrane domain, splitted kinase domains, a kinase insert domain, and a cytoplasmic tail. These two receptors share 31% identity in the ligand binding domain, 27% identity in the kinase insert and 28% identity in the C-terminus, whereas they are 85% and 75% identical in the two halves of the kinase insert domain (Matsui et al., 1989; Rosenkranz and Kazlauskas, 1999). The three dimeric PDGF receptors (αα, αβ, ββ) mediate PDGF isoform-specific signal transduction. PDGF-AA effectively activates only PDGFRαα, PDGF-AB can activate either PDGFRαα or PDGFRαβ, while PDGF-BB activates all three dimeric PDGF receptors (see Claesson-Welsh et al., \nMol. Cell. Biol. \n8:3476-3486, 1988; Matsui et al., \nScience \n243:800-804, 1989; Claesson-Welsh, \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n269, 32023-32026, 1994). The growth factor domain of PDGF-CC activates both PDGFRαα and PDGFRαβ, and the growth factor domain of PDGF-DD activates PDGFRββ and PDGFRαβ (see Li et al., \nNature Cell. Biol. \n2:302-309, 2000; Bergsten et al., \nNature Cell. Biol. \n3:512-516, 2001; Gilbertson et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n276:27406-27414, 2001; LaRochelle et al., \nNat. Cell. Biol. \n3:517-521, 2001).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPDGFs produced by endothelial cells in vessels promote recruitment and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells/pericyte progenitors expressing PDGFR (Betsholtz et al., 2001). Chemotactic and mitogenic activities mediated by the PDGF/PDGFR paracrine signaling loop are crucial for the formation, branching and maintenance of blood vessels. As in embryogenesis, PDGF plays a critical role for angiogenesis in human tumors. Tumor angiogenesis, required for tumor outgrowth and metastasis, is a complex and highly regulated process involving many different cell types and extracellular factors. Endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells are the major components of blood vessels, and VEGF/PDGF super family members are among the critical mediators of tumor angiogenesis. Clinical studies revealed a correlation between vascular counts and expression frequency of VEGF and PDGF in tumors (Anan et al., \nSurgery \n119:333-339, 1996). PDGFs directly and indirectly stimulate the angiogenic processes. PDGF released by the tumor cells induce migration of endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMC), and also stimulate proliferation of these cells, suggesting a direct role of PDGFs in angiogenesis (Thommen et al., \nJ. Cell. Biochem. \n64:403-413, 1997). PDGFs were shown to induce transcription and secretion of VEGF-A by PDGFR expressing endothelial cells, suggesting an indirect role for PDGF induced angiogenesis (Wang et al., \nCancer Res. \n59:1464-1472, 1999). PDGFs also mediate the paracrine signaling loop between endothelial cells and vSMC/pericytes during tumor angiogenic processes. While PDGF-BB, -AB, and the growth factor domain of PDGF-CC induce indistinguishable angiogenic responses in mouse cornea assay, PDGF-AA (which binds to PDGFRαα but not PDGFRαβ or PDGFRββ) stimulates only a weak response (Cao et \nFASEB J. \n16:1575-1583, 2002). This suggests that PDGFRα and PDGFR may differently regulate angiogenic processes, and points to the PDGFRβ subunit in particular as an important mediator of PDGF-induced angiogenesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPDGF receptor signaling has been linked to various processes in the disease states described above, including autocrine growth factor signaling in tumor cells, tumor and ocular angiogenesis and recruitment of regulation of stromal cells, namely fibroblasts in the tumor, or ocular disease tissues. Expression of almost all ligands of the PDGF family in NIH3T3 cells leads to transformation of the cell to a cancerous phenotype (Reviewed in Ostman and Heldin, \nAdv in Can Res \n97:247-74, 2007). In support of this, co-expression of various PDGF ligands and receptors have been demonstrated in multiple diseases, including various cancers (reviewed in Ostman \nCytokine and Growth Factor Rev \n15:275-86, 2004). Furthermore, mutational activation of PDGF or PDGF receptors have now been shown to be associated with different malignancies, including dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP), gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) and Bcr-Abl-negative chronic myeloid leukemias (reviewed in Ostman and Heldin, \nAdv. Cancer Res. \n97:247-74, 2007). The PDGF family has also been shown to play a significant role in tumor angiogenesis, especially with respect to recruitment of pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells to the tumor and ocular vasculature. These mural cells (pericytes and smooth muscle cells) are thought to provide a supportive framework for growing vascular endothelial cells. PDGFRβ has been shown to be essential for the recruitment of pericytes to tumor vasculature and for the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells to pericytes (Song et al., \nNat. Cell Biol. \n7:870-79, 2005; Bergers et al., \nNeuro. Oncol. \n7:452-64, 2005). PDGFR antagonists have shown to inhibit angiogenesis by not only inhibiting pericyte recruitment but also by reducing endothelial cell coverage within tumors (Bergers et al., \nJ. Clin. Invest. \n111:1287-95, 2003). Furthermore, PDGF and PDGF receptors are expressed significantly in tumor stroma, namely fibroblast cells within various cancers and multiple experiments have demonstrated a critical role for PDGF-BB and PDGFRβ and PDGFRα receptors in stromal cell recruitment within tumors (reviewed in Ostman and Heldin, \nAdv. Cancer Res. \n97:247-74, 2007). A series of recent studies indicate a function of these receptors in controlling tumor transvascular transport. Multiple pieces of evidence now support a role for PDGF and PDGFR in controlling interstitial fluid pressure (IFP), a key parameter determining transvascular transport. Most solid tumors are characterized by high IFP leading to decreased convection rate across capillary walls and there reduced uptake of drugs (chemotherapy) by tumors. PDGF receptor antagonists have shown to reduce tumor IFP and thereby allowing for increased drug uptake within tumors, leading to better anti-tumor efficacy (Pietras et al., \nCancer Res. \n62:5476-84, 2002; Pietras et al., \nCancer Res. \n61:2929-34, 2001). PDGFR antagonists therefore provide a method to inhibit multiple processes within the tumor vasculature, including autocrine effects on tumor cells, angiogenesis and affecting IFP mediated by tumor stroma. Combinations with other drugs, namely anti-angiogenec inhibitors like VEGF antagonists and/or chemotherapy may provide additional benefit to cancer patients.\n\n\n \nIV. Inhibition of VEGF and PDGF Pathways\n\n\n \n \n \nAlthough anti-angiogenic therapies, including AVASTIN™, have been approved for various cancers (and LUCENTIS™ for AMD), efficacy is moderate and patients eventually progress. One factor limiting efficacy is the presence of other angiogenic pathways that are not inhibited by these therapies. In mouse models, it has recently been demonstrated that PDGFRβ-expressing pericytes are found in tumors treated with VEGF antagonists and these provide a framework for newly formed endothelial cells to grow within the tumors (Mancuso et al., \nJ. Clin. Invest. \n116:2610-21, 2006). Inhibiting both the VEGF and PDGFR pathways may provide additive or synergistic angiogenesis inhibition in disease settings and, in cancer, may provide for enhanced delivery of chemotherapeutics by normalizing vessels and IFP.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nScientific evidence supports this therapeutic approach. Data that shows co-targeting both PDGFR and VEGFR signaling more effectively inhibits growth of endothelial vessels and is more effective at inhibiting tumor growth in preclinical disease models. In a spontaneous pancreatic tumor model (RIP-Tag), Bergers and colleagues demonstrated that combination with a VEGF inhibitor (SU5416) and a PDGF inhibitor (SU6668 or imatinib) inhibited growth of pancreatic adenocarcinomas when administered late during tumor progression (IT or RT), whereas VEGF inhibition alone was only effective when used in early disease settings (PT and IT) (Bergers et al., \nJ. Clin. Invest. \n111:1287-95, 2003). The decrease in tumor growth was associated with a decrease in tumor associated endothelial cells and pericytes and inhibition of angiogenesis. Similarly, in a pancreatic xenograft model (BxPC-3), treatment with both anti-PDGFRβ and VEGFR2 antibodies showed significant anti-tumor effects when compared to monotherapy treatment regimens (Shen et al., \nBiochem Biophys Res Commun \n357:1142-47, 2007). Pietras and colleagues further demonstrated that efficacy was substantially higher in the Rip-Tag pancreatic model when anti-VEGF and anti-PDGF therapies were combined together with chemotherapy (Pietras and Hanahan, \nJ. Clin. Oncol. \n23:939-52, 2005). Combination efficacy has also been demonstrated in ovarian carcinoma xenograft models combing PDGFR and VEGFR inhibitors (Lu et al., \nClin. Cancer Res. \n13:4209-17, 2007). These data provide strong proof-of-concept rationale for targeting both pathways in oncology. Furthermore, combination targeting of these pathways also has shown to inhibit neovascularization in a rodent eye model (Jo et al., \nAm. J. Pathol. \n168:2036-53, 2006), providing preclinical support for possible efficacy in ocular disease indications, including AMD.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the present invention provides an antibody that specifically binds to the extracellular domain of PDGFRβ and neutralizes PDGFRβ activity.

As used herein, the following terms and phrases have the meanings ascribed to them unless specified otherwise.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “polypeptide” is a polymer of amino acid residues joined by peptide bonds, whether produced naturally or synthetically. Polypeptides of less than about 10 amino acid residues are commonly referred to as “peptides.”\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “protein” is a macromolecule comprising one or more polypeptide chains. A protein may also comprise non-peptidic components, such as carbohydrate groups. Carbohydrates and other non-peptidic substituents may be added to a protein by the cell in which the protein is produced, and will vary with the type of cell. Proteins are defined herein in terms of their amino acid backbone structures; substituents such as carbohydrate groups are generally not specified, but may be present nonetheless.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “amino-terminal” and “carboxyl-terminal” are used herein to denote positions within polypeptides. Where the context allows, these terms are used with reference to a particular sequence or portion of a polypeptide to denote proximity or relative position. For example, a certain sequence positioned carboxyl-terminal to a reference sequence within a polypeptide is located proximal to the carboxyl terminus of the reference sequence, but is not necessarily at the carboxyl terminus of the complete polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “nucleic acid” or “nucleic acid molecule” refers to polynucleotides, such as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA), oligonucleotides, fragments generated by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and fragments generated by any of ligation, scission, endonuclease action, and exonuclease action. Nucleic acid molecules can be composed of monomers that are naturally-occurring nucleotides (such as DNA and RNA), or analogs of naturally-occurring nucleotides (e.g., α-enantiomeric forms of naturally-occurring nucleotides), or a combination of both. Modified nucleotides can have alterations in sugar moieties and/or in pyrimidine or purine base moieties. Sugar modifications include, for example, replacement of one or more hydroxyl groups with halogens, alkyl groups, amines, and azido groups, or sugars can be functionalized as ethers or esters. Moreover, the entire sugar moiety can be replaced with sterically and electronically similar structures, such as aza-sugars and carbocyclic sugar analogs. Examples of modifications in a base moiety include alkylated purines and pyrimidines, acylated purines or pyrimidines, or other well-known heterocyclic substitutes. Nucleic acid monomers can be linked by phosphodiester bonds or analogs of such linkages. Analogs of phosphodiester linkages include phosphorothioate, phosphorodithioate, phosphoroselenoate, phosphorodiselenoate, phosphoroanilothioate, phosphoranilidate, phosphoramidate, and the like. The term “nucleic acid molecule” also includes so-called “peptide nucleic acids,” which comprise naturally-occurring or modified nucleic acid bases attached to a polyamide backbone. Nucleic acids can be either single stranded or double stranded.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “antagonist” denotes a compound that reduces the activity of another compound in a biological setting. Thus, a VEGF-A antagonist is a compound that reduces the biological activity of VEGF-A, and a PDGFRβ antagonist is compound that reduces the biological activity of PDGFRβ. Since the activities of both VEGF-A and PDGFRβ are dependent on the interactions of multiple molecules (including ligand, receptor, and signal transducers), antagonists can reduce the activity by acting directly on VEGF-A or PDGFRβ, or by acting on another molecule in the cognate biological pathway. For example, a PDGFRβ antagonist can reduce PDGFRβ activity by, e.g., binding to the receptor itself, by binding to one of its ligands, by interfering with receptor dimerization, or by interfering with receptor phosphorylation. Antagonists include, without limitation, antibodies, soluble receptors, and non-proteinaceous compounds that bind to a ligand or its receptor, or otherwise interfering with ligand-receptor interactions and/or other receptor functions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “antibody” is used herein to denote proteins produced by the body in response to the presence of an antigen and that bind to the antigen, as well as antigen-binding fragments and engineered variants thereof. Hence, the terms “antibody” and “antibodies” include polyclonal antibodies, affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies, monoclonal antibodies, and antigen-binding antibody fragments, such as F(ab′)\n2 \nand Fab fragments. Genetically engineered intact antibodies and fragments, such as chimeric antibodies, humanized antibodies, single-chain Fv fragments, single-chain antibodies, diabodies, minibodies, linear antibodies, multivalent or multispecific hybrid antibodies, and the like are also included. Thus, the term “antibody” is used expansively to include any protein that comprises an antigen binding site of an antibody and is capable of binding to its antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “genetically engineered antibodies” means antibodies wherein the amino acid sequence has been varied from that of a native antibody. Because of the relevance of recombinant DNA techniques in the generation of antibodies, one need not be confined to the sequences of amino acids found in natural antibodies; antibodies can be redesigned to obtain desired characteristics. The possible variations are many and range from the changing of just one or a few amino acids to the complete redesign of, for example, the variable or constant region. Changes in the constant region will, in general, be made in order to improve or alter characteristics, such as complement fixation, interaction with cells and other effector functions. Typically, changes in the variable region will be made in order to improve the antigen binding characteristics, improve variable region stability, or reduce the risk of immunogenicity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “antigen-binding site of an antibody” is that portion of an antibody that is sufficient to bind to its antigen. The minimum such region is typically a variable domain or a genetically engineered variant thereof. Single-domain binding sites can be generated from camelid antibodies (see Muyldermans and Lauwereys, \nJ. Mol. Recog. \n12:131-140, 1999; Nguyen et al., \nEMBO J. \n19:921-930, 2000) or from V\nH \ndomains of other species to produce single-domain antibodies (“dAbs”; see Ward et al., \nNature \n341:544-546, 1989; U.S. Pat. No. 6,248,516 to Winter et al.). In certain variations, an antigen-binding site is a polypeptide region having only 2 complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of a naturally or non-naturally (e.g., mutagenized) occurring heavy chain variable domain or light chain variable domain, or combination thereof (see, e.g., Pessi et al., \nNature \n362:367-369, 1993; Qiu et al., \nNature Biotechnol. \n25:921-929, 2007). More commonly, an antigen-binding site of an antibody comprises both a heavy chain variable domain and a light chain variable domain that bind to a common epitope. Within the present invention, a molecule that “comprises an antigen-binding site of an antibody” may further comprise one or more of a second antigen-binding site of an antibody (which may bind to the same or a different epitope or to the same or a different antigen), a peptide linker, an immunoglobulin constant domain, an immunoglobulin hinge, an amphipathic helix (see Pack and Pluckthun, \nBiochem. \n31:1579-1584, 1992), a non-peptide linker, an oligonucleotide (see Chaudri et al., \nFEBS Letters \n450:23-26, 1999), and the like, and may be a monomeric or multimeric protein. Examples of molecules comprising an antigen-binding site of an antibody are known in the art and include, for example, Fv fragments, single-chain Fv fragments (scFv), Fab fragments, diabodies, minibodies, Fab-scFv fusions, bispecific (scFv)-4-IgG, and bispecific (scFv)\n2\n-Fab. (See, e.g., Hu et al., \nCancer Res. \n56:3055-3061, 1996; Atwell et al., \nMolecular Immunology \n33:1301-1312, 1996; Carter and Merchant, \nCurr. Opin. Biotechnol. \n8:449-454, 1997; Zuo et al., \nProtein Engineering \n13:361-367, 2000; and Lu et al., \nJ. Immunol. Methods \n267:213-226, 2002.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “immunoglobulin” refers to a protein consisting of one or more polypeptides substantially encoded by immunoglobulin gene(s). One form of immunoglobulin constitutes the basic structural unit of an antibody. This form is a tetramer and consists of two identical pairs of immunoglobulin chains, each pair having one light and one heavy chain. In each pair, the light and heavy chain variable regions are together responsible for binding to an antigen, and the constant regions are responsible for the antibody effector functions. Immunoglobulins typically function as antibodies in a vertebrate organism. Five classes of immunoglobulin protein (IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD, and IgE) have been identified in higher vertebrates. IgG comprises the major class; it normally exists as the second most abundant protein found in plasma. In humans, IgG consists of four subclasses, designated IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4. The heavy chain constant regions of the IgG class are identified with the Greek symbol γ. For example, immunoglobulins of the IgG1 subclass contain a γ1 heavy chain constant region. Each immunoglobulin heavy chain possesses a constant region that consists of constant region protein domains (C\nH\n1, hinge, C\nH\n2, and C\nH\n3; IgG3 also contains a C\nH\n4 domain) that are essentially invariant for a given subclass in a species. DNA sequences encoding human and non-human immunoglobulin chains are known in the art. (See, e.g., Ellison et al., \nDNA \n1:11-18, 1981; Ellison et al., \nNucleic Acids Res. \n10:4071-4079, 1982; Kenten et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n79:6661-6665, 1982; Seno et al., \nNuc. Acids Res. \n11:719-726, 1983; Riechmann et al., \nNature \n332:323-327, 1988; Amster et al., \nNuc. Acids Res. \n8:2055-2065, 1980; Rusconi and Kohler, \nNature \n314:330-334, 1985; Boss et al., \nNuc.

Evol. \n22:195-208, 1985; Kindsvogel et al., \nDNA \n1:335-343, 1982; Breiner et al., \nGene \n18:165-174, 1982; Kondo et al., \nEur. J Immunol. \n23:245-249, 1993; and GenBank Accession No. J00228.) For a review of immunoglobulin structure and function see Putnam, \nThe Plasma Proteins\n, Vol V, Academic Press, Inc., 49-140, 1987; and Padlan, \nMol. Immunol. \n31:169-217, 1994. The term “immunoglobulin” is used herein for its common meaning, denoting an intact antibody, its component chains, or fragments of chains, depending on the context.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFull-length immunoglobulin “light chains” (about 25 Kd or 214 amino acids) are encoded by a variable region gene at the NH\n2\n-terminus (encoding about 110 amino acids) and a by a kappa or lambda constant region gene at the COOH-terminus. Full-length immunoglobulin “heavy chains” (about 50 Kd or 446 amino acids) are encoded by a variable region gene (encoding about 116 amino acids) and a gamma, mu, alpha, delta, or epsilon constant region gene (encoding about 330 amino acids), the latter defining the antibody's isotype as IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, or IgE, respectively. Within light and heavy chains, the variable and constant regions are joined by a “J” region of about 12 or more amino acids, with the heavy chain also including a “D” region of about 10 more amino acids. (See generally Fundamental Immunology (Paul, ed., Raven Press, N.Y., 2nd ed. 1989), Ch. 7).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn immunoglobulin “Fv” fragment contains a heavy chain variable domain (V\nH\n) and a light chain variable domain (V\nL\n), which are held together by non-covalent interactions. An immunoglobulin Fv fragment thus contains a single antigen-binding site. The dimeric structure of an Fv fragment can be further stabilized by the introduction of a disulfide bond via mutagenesis. (See Almog et al., \nProteins \n31:128-138, 1998.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the terms “single-chain Fv” and “single-chain antibody” refer to antibody fragments that comprise, within a single polypeptide chain, the variable regions from both heavy and light chains, but lack constant regions. In general, a single-chain antibody further comprises a polypeptide linker between the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains, which enables it to form the desired structure that allows for antigen binding. Single-chain antibodies are discussed in detail by, for example, Pluckthun in \nThe Pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibodies\n, vol. 113 (Rosenburg and Moore eds., Springer-Verlag, New York, 1994), pp. 269-315. (See also WIPO Publication WO 88/01649; U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,946,778 and 5,260,203; Bird et al., \nScience \n242:423-426, 1988.) Single-chain antibodies can also be bi-specific and/or humanized.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “Fab fragment” contains one light chain and the C\nH\n1 and variable regions of one heavy chain. The heavy chain of a Fab fragment cannot form a disulfide bond with another heavy chain molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “Fab′ fragment” contains one light chain and one heavy chain that contains more of the constant region, between the C\nH\n1 and C\nH\n2 domains, such that an interchain disulfide bond can be formed between two heavy chains to form a F(ab′)\n2 \nmolecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “F(ab′)\n2 \nfragment” contains two light chains and two heavy chains containing a portion of the constant region between the C\nH\n1 and C\nH\n2 domains, such that an interchain disulfide bond is formed between two heavy chains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn immunoglobulin “Fc fragment” (or Fc domain) is the portion of an antibody that is responsible for binding to antibody receptors on cells and the C1q component of complement. Fc stands for “fragment crystalline,” the fragment of an antibody that will readily form a protein crystal. Distinct protein fragments, which were originally described by proteolytic digestion, can define the overall general structure of an immunoglobulin protein. As originally defined in the literature, the Fc fragment consists of the disulfide-linked heavy chain hinge regions, C\nH\n2, and C\nH\n3 domains. However, more recently the term has been applied to a single chain consisting of C\nH\n3, C\nH\n2, and at least a portion of the hinge sufficient to form a disulfide-linked dimer with a second such chain. For a review of immunoglobulin structure and function, see Putnam, \nThe Plasma Proteins\n, Vol. V (Academic Press, Inc., 1987), pp. 49-140; and Padlan, \nMol. Immunol. \n31:169-217, 1994. As used herein, the term Fc includes variants of naturally occurring sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn immunoglobulin light or heavy chain variable region consists of a “framework” region interrupted by three hypervariable regions. Thus, the term “hypervariable region” refers to the amino acid residues of an antibody that are responsible for antigen binding. The hypervariable region comprises amino acid residues from a “Complementarity Determining Region” or “CDR” (e.g., in human, residues 24-34 (L1), 50-56 (L2), and 89-97 (L3) in the light chain variable domain and residues 31-35 (H1), 50-65 (H2) and 95-102 (H3) in the heavy chain variable domain (amino acid sequence numbers based on the EU index; see Kabat et al., \nSequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, \n5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991)) and/or those residues from a “hypervariable loop” (in human, residues 26-32 (L1), 50-52 (L2) and 91-96 (L3) in the light chain variable domain and 26-32 (H1), 53-55 (H2) and 96-101 (H3) in the heavy chain variable domain; Chothia and Lesk, \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n196: 901-917, 1987) (both of which are incorporated herein by reference). “Framework Region” or “FR” residues are those variable domain residues other than the hypervariable region residues as herein defined. The sequences of the framework regions of different light or heavy chains are relatively conserved within a species. Thus, a “human framework region” is a framework region that is substantially identical (about 85% or more, usually 90-95% or more) to the framework region of a naturally occurring human immunoglobulin. The framework region of an antibody, that is the combined framework regions of the constituent light and heavy chains, serves to position and align the CDR's. The CDR's are primarily responsible for binding to an epitope of an antigen. CDRs L1, L2, and L3 of the V\nL \ndomain are also referred to herein, respectively, as LCDR1, LCDR2, and LCDR3; CDRs H1, H2, and H3 of the V\nH \ndomain are also referred to herein, respectively, as HCDR1, HCDR2, and HCDR3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Chimeric antibodies” are antibodies whose light and heavy chain genes have been constructed, typically by genetic engineering, from immunoglobulin variable and constant region genes belonging to different species. For example, the variable segments of the genes from a mouse monoclonal antibody may be joined to human constant region-encoding segments (e.g., human gamma 1 or gamma 3 heavy chain genes, and human kappa light chain genes). A therapeutic chimeric antibody is thus a hybrid protein, typically composed of the variable or antigen-binding domains from a mouse antibody and the constant domains from a human antibody, although other mammalian species may be used. Specifically, a chimeric antibody is produced by recombinant DNA technology in which all or part of the hinge and constant regions of an immunoglobulin light chain, heavy chain, or both, have been substituted for the corresponding regions from another animal's immunoglobulin light chain or heavy chain. In this way, the antigen-binding portion of the parent monoclonal antibody is grafted onto the backbone of another species' antibody. Chimeric antibodies may be optionally “cloaked” with a human-like surface by replacement of exposed residues, the result of which is a “veneered antibody.”\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “human antibody” includes an antibody that has an amino acid sequence of a human immunoglobulin and includes antibodies isolated from human immunoglobulin libraries or from animals transgenic for one or more human immunoglobulin genes and that do not express endogenous immunoglobulins, as described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,939,598 to Kucherlapati et al.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “humanized immunoglobulin” refers to an immunoglobulin comprising a human framework region and one or more CDR's from a non-human (e.g., a mouse or rat) immunoglobulin. The non-human immunoglobulin providing the CDR's is called the “donor” and the human immunoglobulin providing the framework is called the “acceptor.” Constant regions need not be present, but if they are, they must be substantially identical to human immunoglobulin constant regions, i.e., at least about 85-90%, preferably about 95% or more identical. Hence, all parts of a humanized immunoglobulin, except possibly the CDR's, are substantially identical to corresponding parts of natural human immunoglobulin sequences. In some instances, humanized antibodies may retain non-human residues within the human variable region framework domains to enhance proper binding characteristics (e.g., mutations in the frameworks may be required to preserve binding affinity when an antibody is humanized). A “humanized antibody” is an antibody comprising a humanized light chain and a humanized heavy chain immunoglobulin. For example, a humanized antibody would not encompass a typical chimeric antibody as defined above because, e.g., the entire variable region of a chimeric antibody is non-human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “bispecific” or “bifunctional” antibody is a hybrid antibody having two different heavy/light chain pairs and two different binding sites. Bispecific antibodies may be produced by a variety of methods including, but not limited to, fusion of hybridomas or linking of Fab′ fragments. See, e.g., Songsivilai & Lachmann, \nClin. Exp. Immunol. \n79:315-321, 1990; Kostelny et al., \nJ. Immunol. \n148:1547-1553, 1992.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “bivalent antibody” other than a “multispecific” or “multifunctional” antibody, in certain embodiments, is an antibody comprising two binding sites having identical antigenic specificity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “diabodies” refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites, which fragments comprise a heavy chain variable domain (V\nH\n) connected to a light chain variable domain (V\nL\n) in the same polypeptide chain (V\nH\n-V\nL\n). By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain, the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen-binding sites. Diabodies are described more fully in, for example, EP 404,097; WO 93/11161; and Hollinger et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n90:6444-6448, 1993.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “minibody” refers herein to a polypeptide that encodes only 2 complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of a naturally or non-naturally (e.g., mutagenized) occurring heavy chain variable domain or light chain variable domain, or combination thereof. Examples of minibodies are described by, e.g., Pessi et al., \nNature \n362:367-369, 1993; and Qiu et al., \nNature Biolechnol. \n25:921-929, 2007.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “linear antibodies” refers to the antibodies described in Zapata et al., \nProtein Eng. \n8:1057-1062, 1995. Briefly, these antibodies comprise a pair of tandem Fd segments (V\nH\n-C\nH1\n-V\nH\n-C\nH1\n) which form a pair of antigen binding regions. Linear antibodies can be bispecific or monospecific.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “monoclonal antibody” as used herein is not limited to antibodies produced through hybridoma technology. The term “monoclonal antibody” refers to an antibody that is derived from a single clone, including any eukaryotic, prokaryotic, or phage clone, and not the method by which it is produced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “parent antibody” as used herein refers to an antibody which is encoded by an amino acid sequence used for the preparation of the variant. Preferably, the parent antibody has a human framework region and, if present, has human antibody constant region(s). For example, the parent antibody may be a humanized or human antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “variant” anti-PDGFRβ or anti-VEGF-A antibody, refers herein to a molecule which differs in amino acid sequence from a “parent” anti-PDGFRβ or anti-VEGF-A antibody amino acid sequence by virtue of addition, deletion and/or substitution of one or more amino acid residue(s) in the parent antibody sequence. In the preferred embodiment, the variant comprises one or more amino acid substitution(s) in one or more hypervariable region(s) of the parent antibody. For example, the variant may comprise at least one, e.g., from about one to about ten, and preferably from about two to about five, substitutions in one or more hypervariable regions of the parent antibody. Ordinarily, the variant will have an amino acid sequence having at least 75% amino acid sequence identity with the parent antibody heavy or light chain variable domain sequences, more preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 85%, more preferably at least 90%, and most preferably at least 95%. Identity or homology with respect to this sequence is defined herein as the percentage of amino acid residues in the candidate sequence that are identical with the parent antibody residues, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity. None of N-terminal, C-terminal, or internal extensions, deletions, or insertions into the antibody sequence shall be construed as affecting sequence identity or homology. The variant retains the ability to bind human PDGFRβ or VEGF-A and preferably has properties which are superior to those of the parent antibody. For example, the variant may have a stronger binding affinity, enhanced ability to inhibit PDGFRβ-induced or VEGF-A-induced biological activity (e.g., angiogenesis). To analyze such properties, one should compare a Fab form of the variant to a Fab form of the parent antibody or a full length form of the variant to a full length form of the parent antibody, for example, since it has been found that the format of an anti-PDGFRβ or anti-VEGF-A antibody impacts its activity in the biological activity assays disclosed herein. The variant antibody of particular interest herein is one which displays about at least a 3 fold, 5 fold, 10 fold, 20 fold, or 50 fold, enhancement in biological activity when compared to the parent antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “epitope” includes any protein determinant capable of specific binding to an immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor. Epitopic determinants usually consist of chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids or sugar side chains and usually have specific three dimensional structural characteristics, as well as specific charge characteristics. More specifically, the term “PDGFRβ epitope” or “VEGF-A epitope” as used herein refers to a portion of the PDGFRβ or VEGF-A polypeptide having antigenic or immunogenic activity in an animal, preferably in a mammal, and most preferably in a mouse or a human. An epitope having immunogenic activity is a portion of a PDGFRβ or VEGF-A polypeptide that elicits an antibody response in an animal. An epitope having antigenic activity is a portion of a PDGFRβ or VEGF-A polypeptide to which an antibody immunospecifically binds as determined by any method well known in the art, for example, by immunoassays. Antigenic epitopes need not necessarily be immunogenic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “cloning vector” is a nucleic acid molecule, such as a plasmid, cosmid, or bacteriophage, that has the capability of replicating autonomously in a host cell. Cloning vectors typically contain one or a small number of restriction endonuclease recognition sites that allow insertion of a nucleic acid molecule in a determinable fashion without loss of an essential biological function of the vector, as well as nucleotide sequences encoding a marker gene that is suitable for use in the identification and selection of cells transformed with the cloning vector. Marker genes typically include genes that provide tetracycline resistance or ampicillin resistance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “expression” refers to the biosynthesis of a product encoded by a nucleic acid. For example, in the case of nucleic acid segment encoding a polypeptide of interest, expression involves transcription of the nucleic acid segment into mRNA and the translation of mRNA into one or more polypeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “expression unit” and “expression cassette” are used interchangeably herein and denote a nucleic acid segment encoding a polypeptide of interest and capable of providing expression of the nucleic acid segment in a host cell. An expression unit typically comprises a transcription promoter, an open reading frame encoding the polypeptide of interest, and a transcription terminator, all in operable configuration. In addition to a transcriptional promoter and terminator, an expression unit may further include other nucleic acid segments such as, e.g., an enhancer or a polyadenylation signal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “expression vector,” as used herein, refers to a nucleic acid molecule, linear or circular, comprising one or more expression units. In addition to one or more expression units, an expression vector may also include additional nucleic acid segments such as, for example, one or more origins of replication or one or more selectable markers. Expression vectors are generally derived from plasmid or viral DNA, or may contain elements of both.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWith regard to proteins as described herein, reference to amino acid residues corresponding to those specified by SEQ ID NO includes post-translational modifications of such residues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “neovascularization” and “angiogenesis” are used interchangeably herein. Neovascularization and angiogenesis refer to the generation of new blood vessels into cells, tissue, or organs. The control of angiogenesis is typically is typically altered in certain disease states and, in many case, the pathological damage associated with the disease is related to altered or unregulated angiogenesis. Persistent, unregulated angiogenesis occurs in a variety of disease states, including those characterized by the abnormal growth by endothelial cells, and supports the pathological damage seen in these conditions including leakage and permeability of blood vessels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “neovascular disorder” are used herein refers to any disease or disorder having a pathology that is mediated, at least in part, by increased or unregulated angiogenesis activity. Examples of such diseases or disorders include various cancers comprising solid tumors (e.g., pancreatic cancer, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST)) as well as certain ocular diseases involving neovascularization (“neovascular ocular disorders”). Such diseases or disorders are particularly amenable to certain treatment methods for inhibition angiogenesis, as described further herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Neovascular ocular disorder,” as used herein, refers to a neovascular disorder involving the eye of a patient (i.e., a disease or disorder having a pathology that is mediated, at least in part, by increased or unregulated angiogenesis activity in the eye of the patient). Examples of neovascular ocular disorders amenable to treatment in accordance with the present invention include age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, iris neovascularization, neovascular glaucoma, proliferative vitroretinopathy, optic disc neovascularization, corneal neovascularization, vitreal neovascularization, pannus, pterygium, macular edema, diabetic macular edema, vascular retinopathy, retinal degeneration, uveitis, and inflammatory diseases of the retina.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “effective amount,” in the context of treatment of a neovascular disorder by administration of a PDGFRβ and/or VEGF-A antagonist to a subject as described herein, refers to an amount of such agent that is sufficient to inhibit angiogenesis in the subject so as to inhibit the occurrence or ameliorate one or more symptoms of the neovascular disorder. An effective amount of an agent is administered according to the methods of the present invention in an “effective regime.” The term “effective regime” refers to a combination of amount of the agent being administered and dosage frequency adequate to accomplish treatment or prevention of the disease or disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “patient” or “subject,” in the context of treating a disease or disorder as described herein, includes mammals such as, for example, humans and other primates. The term also includes domesticated animals such as, e.g., cows, hogs, sheep, horses, dogs, and cats.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo amino acid sequences have “100% amino acid sequence identity” if the amino acid residues of the two amino acid sequences are the same when aligned for maximal correspondence. Similarly, two nucleotide sequences have “100% nucleotide sequence identity” if the nucleotide residues of the two nucleotide sequences are the same when aligned for maximal correspondence. Sequence comparisons can be performed using standard software programs such as those included in the LASERGENE bioinformatics computing suite, which is produced by DNASTAR (Madison, Wis.). Other methods for comparing two nucleotide or amino acid sequences by determining optimal alignment are well-known to those of skill in the art. (See, e.g., Peruski and Peruski, \nThe Internet and the New Biology: Tools for Genomic and Molecular Research \n(ASM Press, Inc. 1997); Wu et al. (eds.), “Information Superhighway and Computer Databases of Nucleic Acids and Proteins,” in \nMethods in Gene Biotechnology \n123-151 (CRC Press, Inc. 1997); Bishop (ed.), \nGuide to Human Genome Computing \n(2nd ed., Academic Press, Inc. 1998).) Two nucleotide or amino acid sequences are considered to have “substantially similar sequence identity” or “substantial sequence identity” if the two sequences have at least 80%, at least 90%, or at least 95% sequence identity relative to each other.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPercent sequence identity is determined by conventional methods. See, e.g., Altschul et al., \nBull. Math. Bio. \n48:603, 1986, and Henikoff and Henikoff, \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n89:10915, 1992. For example, two amino acid sequences can be aligned to optimize the alignment scores using a gap opening penalty of 10, a gap extension penalty of 1, and the “BLOSUM62” scoring matrix of Henikoff and Henikoff, supra, as shown in Table 1 (amino acids are indicated by the standard one-letter codes). The percent identity is then calculated as: ([Total number of identical matches]/[length of the longer sequence plus the number of gaps introduced into the longer sequence in order to align the two sequences])(100).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBLOSUM62 Scoring Matrix\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nA\n\n\nR\n\n\nN\n\n\nD\n\n\nC\n\n\nQ\n\n\nE\n\n\nG\n\n\nH\n\n\nI\n\n\nL\n\n\nK\n\n\nM\n\n\nF\n\n\nP\n\n\nS\n\n\nT\n\n\nW\n\n\nY\n\n\nV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n\n4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\n−1\n\n\n5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nN\n\n\n−2\n\n\n0\n\n\n6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nD\n\n\n−2\n\n\n−2\n\n\n1\n\n\n6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n0\n\n\n−3\n\n\n−3\n\n\n−3\n\n\n9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ\n\n\n−1\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n−3\n\n\n5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nE\n\n\n−1\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n2\n\n\n−4\n\n\n2\n\n\n5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nG\n\n\n0\n\n\n−2\n\n\n0\n\n\n−1\n\n\n−3\n\n\n−2\n\n\n−2\n\n\n6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nH\n\n\n−2\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n−1\n\n\n−3\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n−2\n\n\n8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\n−1\n\n\n−3\n\n\n−3\n\n\n−3\n\n\n−1\n\n\n−3\n\n\n−3\n\n\n−4\n\n\n−3\n\n\n4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nL\n\n\n−1\n\n\n−2\n\n\n−3\n\n\n−4\n\n\n−1\n\n\n−2\n\n\n−3\n\n\n−4\n\n\n−3\n\n\n2\n\n\n4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nK\n\n\n−1\n\n\n2\n\n\n0\n\n\n−1\n\n\n−3\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n−2\n\n\n−1\n\n\n−3\n\n\n−2\n\n\n5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nM\n\n\n−1\n\n\n−1\n\n\n−2\n\n\n−3\n\n\n−1\n\n\n0\n\n\n−2\n\n\n−3\n\n\n−2\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n−1\n\n\n5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nF\n\n\n−2\n\n\n−3\n\n\n−3\n\n\n−3\n\n\n−2\n\n\n−3\n\n\n−3\n\n\n−3\n\n\n−1\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n−3\n\n\n0\n\n\n6\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nP\n\n\n−1\n\n\n−2\n\n\n−2\n\n\n−1\n\n\n−3\n\n\n−1\n\n\n−1\n\n\n−2\n\n\n−2\n\n\n−3\n\n\n−3\n\n\n−1\n\n\n−2\n\n\n−4\n\n\n7\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nS\n\n\n1\n\n\n−1\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n−1\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n−1\n\n\n−2\n\n\n−2\n\n\n0\n\n\n−1\n\n\n−2\n\n\n−1\n\n\n4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nT\n\n\n0\n\n\n−1\n\n\n0\n\n\n−1\n\n\n−1\n\n\n−1\n\n\n−1\n\n\n−2\n\n\n−2\n\n\n−1\n\n\n−1\n\n\n−1\n\n\n−1\n\n\n−2\n\n\n−1\n\n\n1\n\n\n5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nW\n\n\n−3\n\n\n−3\n\n\n−4\n\n\n−4\n\n\n−2\n\n\n−2\n\n\n−3\n\n\n−2\n\n\n−2\n\n\n−3\n\n\n−2\n\n\n−3\n\n\n−1\n\n\n1\n\n\n−4\n\n\n−3\n\n\n−2\n\n\n11\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nY\n\n\n−2\n\n\n−2\n\n\n−2\n\n\n−3\n\n\n−2\n\n\n−1\n\n\n−2\n\n\n−3\n\n\n2\n\n\n−1\n\n\n−1\n\n\n−2\n\n\n−1\n\n\n3\n\n\n−3\n\n\n−2\n\n\n−2\n\n\n2\n\n\n7\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\n0\n\n\n−3\n\n\n−3\n\n\n−3\n\n\n−1\n\n\n−2\n\n\n−2\n\n\n−3\n\n\n−3\n\n\n3\n\n\n1\n\n\n−2\n\n\n1\n\n\n−1\n\n\n−2\n\n\n−2\n\n\n0\n\n\n−3\n\n\n−1\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThose skilled in the art appreciate that there are many established algorithms available to align two amino acid sequences. The “FASTA” similarity search algorithm of Pearson and Lipman is a suitable protein alignment method for examining the level of identity shared by an amino acid sequence disclosed herein and a second amino acid sequence. The FASTA algorithm is described by Pearson and Lipman, \nProc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA \n85:2444, 1988, and by Pearson, \nMeth. Enzymol. \n183:63, 1990. Briefly, FASTA first characterizes sequence similarity by identifying regions shared by the query sequence (e.g., residues 25-266 of SEQ ID NO:2) and a test sequence that have either the highest density of identities (if the ktup variable is 1) or pairs of identities (if ktup=2), without considering conservative amino acid substitutions, insertions, or deletions. The ten regions with the highest density of identities are then rescored by comparing the similarity of all paired amino acids using an amino acid substitution matrix, and the ends of the regions are “trimmed” to include only those residues that contribute to the highest score. If there are several regions with scores greater than the “cutoff” value (calculated by a predetermined formula based upon the length of the sequence and the ktup value), then the trimmed initial regions are examined to determine whether the regions can be joined to form an approximate alignment with gaps. Finally, the highest scoring regions of the two amino acid sequences are aligned using a modification of the Needleman-Wunsch-Sellers algorithm (Needleman and Wunsch, \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n48:444, 1970; Sellers, \nSIAM J. Appl. Math. \n26:787, 1974), which allows for amino acid insertions and deletions. Illustrative parameters for FASTA analysis are: ktup=1, gap opening penalty=10, gap extension penalty=1, and substitution matrix=BLOSUM62. These parameters can be introduced into a FASTA program by modifying the scoring matrix file (“SMATRIX”), as explained in Appendix 2 of Pearson, \nMeth. Enzymol. \n183:63, 1990.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFASTA can also be used to determine the sequence identity of nucleic acid molecules using a ratio as disclosed above. For nucleotide sequence comparisons, the ktup value can range between one to six, preferably from three to six, most preferably three, with other parameters set as described above.\n\n\n \n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFIGS. 1A-1C\n illustrate the amino acid sequences of certain immunoglobulin Fc polypeptides.

Overview\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention addresses a need in the art to provide more therapeutics to treat neovascular disorders, including cancers and ocular neovascular disorders. Specifically, the present invention provides VEGF-A and PDGFRβ antagonists, particularly neutralizing anti-VEGF-A and anti-PDGFRβ antibodies, that inhibit signaling through VEGF-A receptors and PDGFRβ. Inhibition of angiogenic signals through VEGF-A and/or PDGFRβ using such antagonists are useful for treatment of various disorders having a pathology characterized at least in part by neovascularization. For example, inhibition of angiogenic signals through VEGF-A and/or PDGFRβ in and around tumors reduces the tumor's ability to vascularize, grow, and metastasize. In addition, inhibition of angiogenic signals through VEGF-A and/or PDGFRβ reduces neovascularization characteristic of various ocular diseases, including, for example, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy, proliferative vitroretinopathy (PVR), iris neovascularization, and neovascular glaucoma. As described herein, VEGF-A and PDGFRβ antagonists of the invention are particularly effective when in combination. Accordingly, in certain preferred embodiments, the invention provides bispecific agents, including bispecific antibodies, that are capable of neutralizing both VEGF-A and PDGFRβ, as well as related methods for using such bispecific agents for treatment of angiogenesis-related disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVEGF-A antagonists for use within the present invention include molecules that bind to VEGF-A or a VEGF-A receptor and thereby reduce the activity of VEGF-A on cells that express the receptor such as, e.g., VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, neuropilin-1, and/or neuropilin-2. In particular, VEGF-A antagonists include anti-VEGF-A antibodies. Other suitable VEGF-A antagonists include soluble VEGF-A receptors comprising a VEGFR extracellular domain, as well as small molecule antagonists capable of inhibiting the interaction of VEGF-A with its receptor or otherwise capable in inhibiting VEGF-A-induced intracellular signaling through a VEGF-A receptor. In addition, binding proteins based on non-antibody scaffolds may be employed. (See, e.g., Koide et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n284:1141-1151, 1998; Hosse et al. \nProtein Sci. \n15:14-27, 2006, and references therein.) Preferred VEGF-A antagonists for use within the invention include antibodies that specifically bind to VEGF-A, including bispecific antibodies that also comprise a binding site for PDGFRβ. Antibodies that are specific for VEGF-A bind at least the soluble secreted forms of VEGF-A, and preferably also bind cell surface-associated forms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPDGFRβ antagonists for use within the present invention include molecules that bind to PDGFRβ or its ligands and thereby reduce the activity of PDGF on cells that express the receptor. Ligands for PDGFRβ include PDGF-B, PDGF-C, and PDGF-D. In particular, PDGFRβ antagonists include anti-PDGFRβ antibodies. Other suitable PDGFRβ antagonists include antibodies against PDGFRβ ligands (i.e., antibodies against PDGF-B, PDGF-C, and/or PDGF-D), soluble PDGFRβ, and small molecule antagonists capable of inhibiting the interaction of PDGFRβ with its ligands or otherwise capable of inhibiting intracellular signaling through PDGFRβ. In addition, binding proteins based on non-antibody scaffolds may be employed. (See, e.g., Koide et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n284:1141-1151, 1998; Hosse et al., \nProtein Sci. \n15:14-27, 2006, and references therein.) Preferred PDGFRβ antagonists for use within the invention include antibodies that specifically bind to PDGFRβ, including bispecific antibodies that also comprise a binding site for VEGF-A.\n\n\n \nII. Anti-PDGFRβ Antibodies, Anti-VEGF-A Antibodies, and Related Bispecific Binding Compositions\n\n\n \n \n \nIn certain preferred embodiments, VEGF-A and/or PDGFRβ antagonists in accordance with the present invention are antibodies that specifically bind to VEGF-A (residues 27-191 SEQ ID NO:2) and/or the extracellular domain of PDGFRβ (residues 33-531 of SEQ ID NO:4). Particularly preferred antibodies of the invention neutralize the biological activity of VEGF-A, PDGFRβ, or both VEGF-A and PDGFRβ.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies are considered to be specifically binding if (1) they exhibit a threshold level of binding activity, and (2) they do not significantly cross-react with control polypeptide molecules. For example, a threshold level of binding is determined if an anti-VEGF-A antibody binds to a VEGF-A polypeptide, peptide or epitope with an affinity at least 10-fold greater than the binding affinity to a control (non-VEGF-A) polypeptide. It is preferred that antibodies used within the invention exhibit a binding affinity (K\na\n) of 10\n6 \nM\n−1 \nor greater, preferably 10\n7 \nM\n−1 \nor greater, more preferably 10\n8 \nM\n−1 \nor greater, and most preferably 10\n9 \nM\n−1 \nor greater. The binding affinity of an antibody can be readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art, commonly by surface plasmon resonance using automated equipment. Other methods are known in the art, for example Scatchard analysis (Scatchard, \nAnn. NY Acad. Sci. \n51:660-672, 1949).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies of the present invention comprise or consist of portions of intact antibodies that retain antigen-binding specificity. Suitable antibodies include, for example, fully human antibodies; humanized antibodies; chimeric antibodies; antibody fragments such as, e.g., Fab, Fab′, F(ab)\n2\n, F(ab′)\n2 \nand Fv antibody fragments; single chain antibodies; and monomers or dimers of antibody heavy or light chains or mixtures thereof. Preferred antibodies of the invention are monoclonal antibodies. Antibodies comprising a light chain may comprise kappa or lambda light chain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, antibodies of the invention include intact immunoglobulins of any isotype including IgA, IgG, IgE, IgD, or IgM (including subtypes thereof). Intact immunoglobulins in accordance with the present invention preferably include intact IgG (e.g., intact IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1, or IgA2).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for preparing and isolating polyclonal antibodies, monoclonal antibodies, and antigen-binding antibody fragments thereof are well known in the art. See, e.g., \nCurrent Protocols in Immunology\n, (Cooligan et al. eds., John Wiley and Sons, Inc. 2006); Sambrook et al., \nMolecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual \n(Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 2nd ed. 1989); and \nMonoclonal Hybridoma Antibodies: Techniques and Applications \n(Hurrell ed., CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, Fla., 1982). Antigen binding fragments, including scFv, can be prepared using phage display libraries according to methods known in the art. Phage display can also be employed for the preparation of binding proteins based on non-antibody scaffolds (Koide et al., supra.). Methods for preparing recombinant human polyclonal antibodies are disclosed by Wiberg et al., \nBiotechnol Bioeng. \n94:396-405, 2006; Meijer et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n358:764-772, 2006; Haurum et al., U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2002/0009453; and Haurum et al., U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2005/0180967. As will be evident to persons of ordinary skill in the art, these methods are equally applicable to production of antibodies against VEGF-A, VEGF-A receptors, PDGFRβ, and PDGF ligands.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs would be evident to one of ordinary skill in the art, polyclonal antibodies for use within the present invention can be generated by inoculating any of a variety of warm-blooded animals such as horses, cows, goats, sheep, dogs, chickens, rabbits, mice, and rats with an immunogenic polypeptide or polypeptide fragment. The immunogenicity of an immunogenic polypeptide can be increased through the use of an adjuvant, such as alum (aluminum hydroxide) or Freund's complete or incomplete adjuvant. Polypeptides useful for immunization also include fusion polypeptides, such as fusions of VEGF-A, PDGFRβ, or a portion thereof with an immunoglobulin polypeptide or with maltose binding protein. The polypeptide immunogen may be a full-length molecule or a portion thereof. If the polypeptide portion is hapten-like, it may be advantageously joined or linked to a macromolecular carrier (such as keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), bovine serum albumin (BSA) or tetanus toxoid) for immunization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, antibodies can be screened against known polypeptides related to the antibody target (e.g., orthologs, paralogs, or sequence variants of, for example, VEGF-A or PDGFRβ) to isolate a population of antibodies that is highly specific for binding to the target protein or polypeptide. Such highly specific populations include, for example, antibodies that bind to human VEGF-A but not to mouse VEGF-A. Such a lack of cross-reactivity with related polypeptide molecules is shown, for example, by the antibody detecting a VEGF-A polypeptide but not known, related polypeptides using a standard Western blot analysis (\nCurrent Protocols in Molecular Biology \n(Ausubel et al. eds., Green and Wiley and Sons, NY 1993)) or ELISA (enzyme immunoassay) (\nImmunoassay, A Practical Guide \n(Chan ed., Academic Press, Inc. 1987)). In another example, antibodies raised to a VEGF-A polypeptide are adsorbed to related polypeptides adhered to insoluble matrix; antibodies that are highly specific to the VEGF-A polypeptide will flow through the matrix under the proper buffer conditions. Screening allows isolation of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies non-cross-reactive to known, closely related polypeptides (Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual (Harlow and Lane eds., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press 1988); \nCurrent Protocols in Immunology \n(Cooligan et al. eds., National Institutes of Health, John Wiley and Sons, Inc. 1995). Screening and isolation of specific antibodies is well known in the art. See \nFundamental Immunology \n(Paul ed., Raven Press 1993); Getzoff et al., \nAdv. in Immunol. \n43:1-98, 1988\n; Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice \n(Goding ed., Academic Press Ltd. 1996); Benjamin et al., \nAnn. Rev. Immunol. \n2:67-101, 1984.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNative monoclonal antibodies (“mAbs”) can be prepared, for example, by immunizing subject animals (e.g., rats or mice) with a purified immunogenic protein or fragment thereof. In a typical procedure, animals are each given an initial intraperitoneal (IP) injection of the purified protein or fragment, typically in combination with an adjuvant (e.g., Complete Freund's Adjuvant or RIBI Adjuvant (available from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.)) followed by booster IP injections of the purified protein at, for example, two-week intervals. Seven to ten days after the administration of the third booster injection, the animals are bled and the serum is collected. Additional boosts can be given as necessary. Splenocytes and lymphatic node cells are harvested from high-titer animals and fused to myeloma cells (e.g., mouse SP2/0 or Ag8 cells) using conventional methods. The fusion mixture is then cultured on a feeder layer of thymocytes or cultured with appropriate medium supplements (including commercially available supplements such as Hybridoma Fusion and Cloning Supplement; Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, Ind.). About 10 days post-fusion, specific antibody-producing hybridoma pools are identified using standard assays (e.g., ELISA). Positive pools may be analyzed further for their ability to block or reduce the activity of the target protein. Positive pools are cloned by limiting dilution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain aspects, the invention also includes the use of multiple monoclonal antibodies that are specific for different epitopes on a single target molecule. Use of such multiple antibodies in combination can reduce carrier effects seen with single antibodies and may also increase rates of clearance via the Fc receptor and improve ADCC. Two, three, or more monoclonal antibodies can be used in combination.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino acid sequence of a native antibody can be varied through the application of recombinant DNA techniques. Thus, antibodies can be redesigned to obtain desired characteristics. Modified antibodies can provide, for example, improved stability and/or therapeutic efficacy relative to its non-modified form. The possible variations are many and range from the changing of just one or a few amino acids to the complete redesign of, for example, the variable or constant region. Changes in the constant region will, in general, be made in order to improve or alter characteristics, such as complement fixation, interaction with membranes, and other effector functions. Examples of engineered constant region sequences are shown in \nFIGS. 1A-1C\n (SEQ ID NOs:492 and 532-535). Typically, changes in the variable region will be made in order to improve the antigen binding characteristics, improve variable region stability, or reduce the risk of immunogenicity. Phage display techniques can also be employed. See, e.g., Huse et al., \nScience \n246:1275-1281, 1989; Ladner et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,571,698.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor therapeutic antibodies for use in humans, it is usually desirable to humanize non-human regions of an antibody according to known procedures. Methods of making humanized antibodies are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,530,101; 5,821,337; 5,585,089; 5,693,762; and 6,180,370. Typically, a humanized anti-PDGFRβ or anti-VEGF-A antibody comprises the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of a mouse donor immunoglobulin and heavy chain and light chain frameworks of a human acceptor immunoglobulin. Often, framework residues in the human framework regions will be substituted with the corresponding residue from the CDR donor antibody to alter, preferably improve, antigen binding. These framework substitutions are identified by methods well known in the art, e.g., by modeling of the interactions of the CDR and framework residues to identify framework residues important for antigen binding and sequence comparison to identify unusual framework residues at particular positions. (See, e.g., Queen et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,089; Riechmann et al., \nNature \n332:323, 1988).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-humanized chimeric antibodies can also be used therapeutically (e.g., in immunosuppressed patients). Accordingly, in some variations, an antibody in accordance with the present invention is a chimeric antibody derived, inter alia, from a non-human anti-PDGFRβ or anti-VEGF-A antibody. Preferably, a chimeric antibody comprises a variable region derived from a mouse or rat antibody and a constant region derived from a human so that the chimeric antibody has a longer half-life and is less immunogenic when administered to a human subject. Methods for producing chimeric antibodies are known in the art. (See e.g., Morrison, \nScience \n229:1202, 1985; Oi et al., \nBioTechniques \n4:214, 1986; Gillies et al., \nJ. Immunol. Methods \n125:191-202, 1989; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,807,715; 4,816,567; and 4,816,397.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also encompasses fully human antibodies such as those derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of ovarian, breast, renal, colorectal, lung, endometrial, or brain cancer patients. Such cells may be fused with myeloma cells, for example, to form hybridoma cells producing fully human antibodies against PDGFRβ or VEGF-A. Human antibodies can also be made in transgenic, non-human animals, commonly mice. See, e.g., Tomizuka et al., U.S. Pat. No. 7,041,870. In general, a nonhuman mammal is made transgenic for a human heavy chain locus and a human light chain locus, and the corresponding endogenous immunoglobulin loci are inactivated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies of the present invention may be specified in terms of an epitope or portion of a VEGF-A or PDGFRβ polypeptide that they recognize or specifically bind. An epitope or polypeptide portion may be specified, e.g., by N-terminal and C-terminal positions of the epitope or other portion of the VEGF-A polypeptide shown in SEQ ID NO:2 or of the PDGFRβ polypeptide shown in SEQ ID NO:4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies of the invention have binding affinities that include a dissociation constant (K\nd\n) less than 5×10\n−2 \nM, less than 10\n−2\nM, less than 5×10\n−3 \nM, less than 10\n−3 \nM, less than 5×10\n−4 \nM, less than 10\n−4 \nM, less than 5×10\n−5 \nM, less than 10\n−5 \nM, less than 5×10\n−6 \nM, less than 10\n−6 \nM, less than 5×10\n−7 \nM, less than 10\n−7 \nM, less than 5×10\n−8 \nM, less than 10\n−8 \nM, less than 5×10\n−9 \nM, less than 10\n−9 \nM, less than 5×10\n−1\n° M, less than 10\n−10 \nM, less than 5×10\n−11 \nM, less than 10\n−11 \nM, less than 5×10\n−12 \nM, less than 10\n−12 \nM, less than 5×10\n−13 \nM, less than 10\n−13 \nM, less than 5×10\n−14 \nM, less than 10\n−14 \nM, less than 5×10\n−15 \nM, or less than 10\n−15 \nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies of the present invention further include derivatives that are modified, e.g., by the covalent attachment of any type of molecule to the antibody such that covalent attachment does not prevent the antibody from binding to its epitope. Suitable modifications include, for example, fucosylation, glycosylation, acetylation, pegylation, phosphorylation, and amidation. The antibodies and derivatives thereof may themselves by derivatized by known protecting/blocking groups, proteolytic cleavage, linkage to a cellular ligand or other proteins, and the like. In some embodiments of the invention, at least one heavy chain of the antibody is fucosylated. In particular variations, the fucosylation is N-linked. In some certain preferred embodiments, at least one heavy chain of the antibody comprises a fucosylated, N-linked oligosaccharide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies of the present invention may be used alone or as immunoconjugates with a cytotoxic agent. In some embodiments, the agent is a chemotherapeutic agent. In other embodiments, the agent is a radioisotope such as, for example, Lead-212, Bismuth-212, Astatine-211, Iodine-131, Scandium-47, Rhenium-186, Rhenium-188, Yttrium-90, Iodine-123, Iodine-125, Bromine-77, Indium-111, or a fissionable nuclide such as Boron-10 or an Actinide. In yet other embodiments, the agent is a toxin or cytotoxic drug such as, for example, ricin, modified \nPseudomonas \nenterotoxin A, calicheamicin, adriamycin, 5-fluorouracil, an auristatin (e.g., auristatin E), maytansin, or the like. Methods of conjugation of antibodies and antibody fragments to such agents are known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies of the present invention include variants having single or multiple amino acid substitutions, deletions, additions, or replacements relative to a reference antibody (e.g., a reference antibody having VL and/or VH sequences as shown in Table 2 or Table 4), such that the variant retains one or more biological properties of the reference antibody (e.g., block the binding of PDGFRβ and/or VEGF-A to their respective counter-structures (a PDGF ligand or VEGF-A receptor), block the biological activity of PDGFRβ and/or VEGF-A, binding affinity). The skilled person can produce variants having single or multiple amino acid substitutions, deletions, additions, or replacements. These variants may include, for example: (a) variants in which one or more amino acid residues are substituted with conservative or nonconservative amino acids, (b) variants in which one or more amino acids are added to or deleted from the polypeptide, (c) variants in which one or more amino acids include a substituent group, and (d) variants in which the polypeptide is fused with another peptide or polypeptide such as a fusion partner, a protein tag or other chemical moiety, that may confer useful properties to the polypeptide, such as, for example, an epitope for an antibody, a polyhistidine sequence, a biotin moiety, and the like. Antibodies of the invention may include variants in which amino acid residues from one species are substituted for the corresponding residue in another species, either at the conserved or nonconserved positions. In another embodiment, amino acid residues at nonconserved positions are substituted with conservative or nonconservative residues. The techniques for obtaining these variants, including genetic (suppressions, deletions, mutations, etc.), chemical, and enzymatic techniques, are known to the person having ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also encompasses bispecific antibodies that bind to both PDGFRβ and VEGF-A. Such bispecific PDGFRβ/VEGF-A antibodies are described further herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary antibodies that bind to PDGFRβ and VEGF-A have been identified by screening a phage display library. Methods of screening by phage display are described in detail in standard reference texts, such as Babas, \nPhage Display: A Laboratory Manual \n(Cold Spring Harbor Lab Press, 2001) and Lo, Benny K. C., A., \nAntibody Engineering \n(2004). Such phage display libraries can be used to display expressed proteins on the surface of a cell or other substance such that the complementary binding entity can be functionally isolated. In one such phage display library, the antibody light-chain variable region and a portion of the heavy-chain variable region are combined with synthetic DNA encoding human antibody sequences, which are then displayed on phage and phagemid libraries as Fab antibody fragments (Dyax® Human Antibody Libraries, Dyax Corp., Cambridge, Mass.). Thus, the variable light and heavy chain fragments of antibodies can be isolated in a Fab format. These variable regions can then be manipulated to generate antibodies, including antigen-binding fragments, such as scFvs, bispecific scFvs, and multispecific, multifunctional antagonists to PDGFRβ and/or VEGF-A.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsing this technology, the variable regions of exemplary Fabs have been identified for their characteristics of binding and/or neutralizing either PDGFRβ or VEGF-A in assays described herein. (See Examples, infra.) These variable regions were manipulated to generate various binding entities, including scFvs that bind and/or neutralize PDGFRβ or VEGF-A. Tables 2 and 4 below show nucleotide and amino acid SEQ ID NO. designations for anti-PDGFRβ and anti-VEGF-A antibody clusters identified for their ability to bind and neutralize either PDGFRβ and VEGF-A, while Tables 3 and 5 list the amino acid residue positions corresponding to the framework and CDR regions of the anti-PDGFRβ and anti-VEGF-A antibodies listed in Tables 2 and 4.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEQ ID NO.

In other embodiments, the CDRs or the V\nL \nand V\nH \ndomains of an anti-VEGF-A scFv are those of an anti-VEGF-A antibody selected from c636, c868, c1039, c1092, c1111, c1135, c1270, c1410, c1476, c1155, c752, c870, c1036, c1094, c1044, and c1257.

Additionally, scFvs may be provided in any of a variety of bispecific antibody formats such as, for example, tandem scFv (tascFv), bi-single chain Fv (biscFv), and whole monoclonal antibody with a single chain Fv (scFv) fused to the carboxyl terminus (biAb) (see infra).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain aspects, an anti-PDGFRβ or anti-VEGF-A antibody as described herein is provided as a bispecific binding composition. As used herein, the term “bispecific binding composition” refers to a composition capable of specifically binding to at least two different target molecules via at least two binding entities having different binding specificities. The binding entities may be, for example, a protein (e.g., antibody or soluble receptor) or small molecule. The binding entities of a bispecific binding composition may be or may not be physically linked.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, a bispecific binding composition of the invention neutralizes both PDGFRβ and a biological activity of a second target molecule and comprises an anti-PDGFRβ antibody as described herein. In other embodiments, a bispecific binding composition of the invention neutralizes both VEGF-A and a biological activity of a second target molecule and comprises an anti-VEGF-A antibody as described herein. Preferred bispecific binding compositions in accordance with the present invention are those capable of neutralizing both PDGFRβ and VEGF-A. Accordingly, in particular variations, a bispecific binding composition comprises an anti-PDGFRβ antibody as described herein and a second binding entity capable of neutralizing the activity of VEGF-A. In other variations, a bispecific binding composition comprises an anti-VEGF-A antibody as described herein and a second binding entity capable of neutralizing the activity of PDGFRβ Particularly preferred bispecific binding compositions in accordance with the present invention comprise a both an anti-PDGFRβ antibody as described herein and an anti-VEGF-A antibody as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, two or more different entities of a bispecific binding composition are linked via linker to form a multimer (e.g., a dimer). For example, in the case of a bispecific binding composition comprising a fusion of at least two polypeptide components (e.g., an anti-PDGFRβ antibody and another polypeptide component; or an anti-VEGF-A antibody and another polypeptide component), a peptide linker sequence may be employed to separate, for example, the polypeptide components by a distance sufficient to ensure that each polypeptide folds into its secondary and tertiary structures. Fusion proteins may generally be prepared using standard techniques, including chemical conjugation. Fusion proteins can also be expressed as recombinant proteins in an expression system by standard techniques. Suitable linkers are further described herein, infra.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA linker can be naturally-occurring, synthetic, or a combination of both. For example, a synthetic linker can be a randomized linker, e.g., both in sequence and size. In one aspect, the randomized linker can comprise a fully randomized sequence, or optionally, the randomized linker can be based on natural linker sequences. The linker can comprise, for example, a non-polypeptide moiety (e.g., a polynucleotide), a polypeptide, or the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA linker can be rigid, or alternatively, flexible, or a combination of both. Linker flexibility can be a function of the composition of both the linker and the subunits that the linker interacts with. The linker joins two selected binding entities (e.g., two separate polypeptides or proteins, such as two different antibodies) and maintains the entities as separate and discrete. The linker can allow the separate, discrete domains to cooperate yet maintain separate properties such as multiple separate binding sites for the same target in a multimer or, for example, multiple separate binding sites for different targets in a multimer. In some cases, a disulfide bridge exists between two linked binding entities or between a linker and a binding entity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChoosing a suitable linker for a specific case where two or more binding entities are to be connected may depend on a variety of parameters including, e.g., the nature of the binding entities, the structure and nature of the target to which the bispecific composition should bind, and/or the stability of the linker (e.g., peptide linker) towards proteolysis and oxidation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParticularly suitable linker polypeptides predominantly include amino acid residues selected from Glycine (Gly), Serine (Ser), Alanine (Ala), and Threonine (Thr). For example, the peptide linker may contain at least 75% (calculated on the basis of the total number of residues present in the peptide linker), such as at least 80%, at least 85%, or at least 90% of amino acid residues selected from Gly, Ser, Ala, and Thr. The peptide linker may also consist of Gly, Ser, Ala and/or Thr residues only. The linker polypeptide should have a length that is adequate to link two binding entities in such a way that they assume the correct conformation relative to one another so that they retain the desired activity, such as binding to a target molecule as well as other activities that may be associated with such target binding (e.g., agonistic or antagonistic activity for a given biomolecule).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA suitable length for this purpose is, e.g., a length of at least one and typically fewer than about 50 amino acid residues, such as 2-25 amino acid residues, 5-20 amino acid residues, 5-15 amino acid residues, 8-12 amino acid residues or 11 residues. Other suitable polypeptide linker sizes may include, e.g., from about 2 to about 15 amino acids, from about 3 to about 15, from about 4 to about 12, about 10, about 8, or about 6 amino acids. The amino acid residues selected for inclusion in the linker polypeptide should exhibit properties that do not interfere significantly with the activity or function of the polypeptide multimer. Thus, the peptide linker should, on the whole, not exhibit a charge that would be inconsistent with the activity or function of the multimer, or interfere with internal folding, or form bonds or other interactions with amino acid residues in one or more of the domains that would seriously impede the binding of the multimer to the target in question.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe use of naturally occurring as well as artificial peptide linkers to connect polypeptides into novel linked fusion polypeptides is well-known in the art. (See, e.g., Hallewell et al, \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n264, 5260-5268, 1989; Alfthan et al., \nProtein Eng. \n8, 725-731, 1995; Robinson and Sauer, \nBiochemistry \n35, 109-116, 1996; Khandekar et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n272, 32190-32197, 1997; Fares et al., \nEndocrinology \n139, 2459-2464, 1998; Smallshaw et al., \nProtein Eng. \n12, 623-630, 1999; U.S. Pat. No. 5,856,456.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne example where the use of peptide linkers is widespread is for production of single-chain antibodies where the variable regions of a light chain (V\nL\n) and a heavy chain (V\nH\n) are joined through an artificial linker, and a large number of publications exist within this particular field. A widely used peptide linker is a 15mer consisting of three repeats of a Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser amino acid sequence ((Gly\n4\nSer)\n3\n) (SEQ ID NO:539). Other linkers have been used, and phage display technology, as well as selective infective phage technology, has been used to diversify and select appropriate linker sequences (Tang et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n271, 15682-15686, 1996; Hennecke et al., \nProtein Eng. \n11, 405-410, 1998). Peptide linkers have been used to connect individual chains in hetero- and homo-dimeric proteins such as the T-cell receptor, the lambda Cro repressor, the P22 phage Arc repressor, IL-12, TSH, FSH, IL-5, and interferon-γ. Peptide linkers have also been used to create fusion polypeptides. Various linkers have been used, and, in the case of the Arc repressor, phage display has been used to optimize the linker length and composition for increased stability of the single-chain protein (see Robinson and Sauer, \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n95, 5929-5934, 1998).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStill another way of obtaining a suitable linker is by optimizing a simple linker (e.g., (Gly\n4\nSer)\nn\n) through random mutagenesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs discussed above, it is generally preferred that the peptide linker possess at least some flexibility. Accordingly, in some variations, the peptide linker contains 1-25 glycine residues, 5-20 glycine residues, 5-15 glycine residues, or 8-12 glycine residues. Particularly suitable peptide linkers typically contain at least 50% glycine residues, such as at least 75% glycine residues. In some embodiments, a peptide linker comprises glycine residues only.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain variations, the peptide linker comprises other residues in addition to the glycine. Preferred residues in addition to glycine include Ser, Ala, and Thr, particularly Ser. One example of a specific peptide linker includes a peptide linker having the amino acid sequence Gly\nx\n-Xaa-Gly\ny\n-Xaa-Gly\nz \n(SEQ ID NO:540), wherein each Xaa is independently selected from Alanine (Ala), Valine (Val), Leucine (Leu), Isoleucine (Ile), Methionine (Met), Phenylalanine (Phe), Tryptophan (Trp), Proline (Pro), Glycine (Gly), Serine (Ser), Threonine (Thr), Cysteine (Cys), Tyrosine (Tyr), Asparagine (Asn), Glutamine (Gln), Lysine (Lys), Arginine (Arg), Histidine (His), Aspartate (Asp), and Glutamate (Glu), and wherein x, y, and z are each integers in the range from 1-5. In some embodiments, each Xaa is independently selected from the group consisting of Ser, Ala, and Thr. In a specific variation, each of x, y, and z is equal to 3 (thereby yielding a peptide linker having the amino acid sequence Gly-Gly-Gly-Xaa-Gly-Gly-Gly-Xaa-Gly-Gly-Gly (SEQ ID NO:541), wherein each Xaa is selected as above).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some cases, it may be desirable or necessary to provide some rigidity into the peptide linker: This may be accomplished by including proline residues in the amino acid sequence of the peptide linker. Thus, in another embodiment, a peptide linker comprises at least one proline residue in the amino acid sequence of the peptide linker. For example, a peptide linker can have an amino acid sequence wherein at least 25% (e.g., at least 50% or at least 75%) of the amino acid residues are proline residues. In one particular embodiment of the invention, the peptide linker comprises proline residues only.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a peptide linker is modified in such a way that an amino acid residue comprising an attachment group for a non-polypeptide moiety is introduced. Examples of such amino acid residues may be a cysteine or a lysine residue (to which the non-polypeptide moiety is then subsequently attached). Another alternative is to include an amino acid sequence having an in vivo N-glycosylation site (thereby attaching a sugar moiety (in vivo) to the peptide linker). An additional option is to genetically incorporate non-natural amino acids using evolved tRNAs and tRNA synthetases (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication 2003/0082575) into a polypeptide binding entity or peptide linker. For example, insertion of keto-tyrosine allows for site-specific coupling to an expressed polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain variations, a peptide linker comprises at least one cysteine residue, such as one cysteine residue. For example, in some embodiments, a peptide linker comprises at least one cysteine residue and amino acid residues selected from the group consisting of Gly, Ser, Ala, and Thr. In some such embodiments, a peptide linker comprises glycine residues and cysteine residues, such as glycine residues and cysteine residues only. Typically, only one cysteine residue will be included per peptide linker'. One example of a specific peptide linker comprising a cysteine residue includes a peptide linker having the amino acid sequence Gly\nn\n-Cys-Gly\nm\n, (SEQ ID NO:542), wherein n and m are each integers from 1-12, e.g., from 3-9, from 4-8, or from 4-7. In a specific variation, such a peptide linker has the amino acid sequence GGGGG-C-GGGGG (SEQ ID NO:543).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs previously noted, in certain embodiments, a bispecific binding composition comprises an anti-PDGFRβ antibody and an anti-VEGF-A antibody. In some such embodiments, the anti-PDGFRβ and anti-VEGF-A antibodies are covalently linked (e.g., via a peptide linker) to form a bispecific antibody. In some variations, the bispecific antibody comprises an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region such as, for example, an Fc fragment. Particularly suitable Fc fragments include, for example, Fc fragments comprising an Fc region modified to reduce or eliminate one or more effector functions (e.g., Fc5, having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:492).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, in some embodiments, a bispecific antibody that neutralizes both PDGFRβ and VEGF-A in accordance with the present invention comprises an antigen-binding region of an anti-PDGFRβ antibody as described herein and an antigen-binding region of an anti-VEGF-A antibody as described herein. In certain embodiments, a bispecific antibody comprises a first antigen-binding region having anti-PDGFRβ CDRs of consensus family A as listed in Table 6 and a second antigen-binding region having anti-VEGF-A CDRs of consensus family B or C as listed in Table 6. In other embodiments, a bispecific antibody comprises a first antigen-binding region having the CDRs of an anti-PDGFRβ antibody listed in Table 2 and a second antigen-binding region having the CDRs of an anti-VEGF-A antibody listed in Table 4: In particular variations, a bispecific antibody comprises a first antigen-binding region having the V\nL \nand V\nH \ndomains of an anti-PDGFRβ antibody listed in Table 2 and a second antigen-binding region having the V\nL \nand V\nH \ndomains of an anti-VEGF-A antibody listed in Table 4. In specific variations, the CDRs or the V\nL \nand V\nH \ndomains of the first antigen-binding region are those of an anti-PDGFRβ antibody selected from c597, c600, c941, c949, c975, c1035, and c613; and the CDRs or the V\nL \nand V\nH \ndomains of the second antigen-binding region are those of an anti-VEGF-A antibody selected from c636, c868, c1039, c1092, c1111, c1135, c1270, c1410, c1476, c1155, c752, c870, c1036, c1094, c1044, and c1257. In certain preferred embodiments, a bispecific antibody in accordance with the present invention is a tandem single chain Fv (tascFv), bi-single chain Fv (biscFv), or a whole monoclonal antibody with a single chain Fv (scFv) fused to the carboxyl terminus (biAb).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the tascFv molecule, two scFv molecules are constructed such that one scFv is amino terminal to the other one in a tandem configuration. This can be done in each orientation. Tandem scFv molecules can be prepared with a linker between the scFv entities. In some embodiments, the linker is a Gly-Ser linker comprising a series of glycine and serine residues, and optionally including additional amino acids. In other embodiments, the linker is a lambda stump, kappa stump, or a CHI stump, each of which are derived from the native sequence just after the V region in the Fab. The tascFv can be further constructed as fusion protein to contain a Fc component (“tascFv Fc”). In some such embodiments, such an Fc fragment comprises an Fc region modified to reduce or eliminate one or more effector functions (e.g., Fc5, having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:492).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe biscFv molecule is not a tandem configuration. Rather, it has a scFv at the N terminus and another at the C terminus of an Fc (“biscFv Fc”). These molecules can be made with the N terminal scFv directly fused to the Fc hinge and with either a short or a long linker at the C terminus connecting to the second scFv. These linkers are typically Gly-Ser linkers. In some embodiments, the Fc fragment comprises an Fc region modified to reduce or eliminate one or more effector functions (e.g., Fc5, having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:492). In certain variations, a biscFv in accordance with the present invention comprises an N-terminal anti-PDGFRβ scFv and a C-terminal anti-VEGF-A scFv. In particular variations, the anti-PDGFRβ scFv comprises an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO:603 (c941.1 scFv) and SEQ ID NO:605 (c1035.1 scFv); and the anti-VEGF-A scFv comprises an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO:608 (c868.1 scFv), SEQ ID NO:610 (c870.1 scFv), and SEQ ID NO:12 (c1039.1 scFv). In some specific variations, a biscFv in accordance with the present invention has an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of residues 20-770 of SEQ ID NO:618 (c941.1-c868.1 biscFv); residues 20-768 of SEQ ID NO:620 (c941.1-c870.1 biscFv); residues 20-773 of SEQ ID NO:622 (c941.1-c1039.1 biscFv); residues 20-770 of SEQ ID NO:624 (c1035.1-c868.1 biscFv); residues 20-768 of SEQ ID NO:626 (c1035.1-c870.1 biscFv); and residues 20-773 of SEQ ID NO:628 (c1035.1-c1039.1 biscFv). A biscFv as above may further include a secretory signal sequence such as shown, for example, in residues 1-19 of SEQ ID NO:614, residues 1-19 of SEQ ID NO:616, or residues 1-19 of SEQ ID NO:618.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe biAb molecule is also not a tandem format. It comprises a whole monoclonal antibody with a scFv fused to the C terminus of the heavy chain. These molecules can be made, for example, by converting one scFv back to a light chain (kappa or lambda) and a gamma1 heavy chain with the second scFv connected by either a short or long Gly-Ser linker. These molecules can be made with a whole anti-PDGFRβ monoclonal antibody fused to an anti-VEGF-A scFv or, alternatively, with a whole anti-VEGF-A monoclonal antibody fused to an anti-PDGFRβ scFv. In some particular embodiments, a biAb in accordance with the present invention comprises a whole anti-PDGFRβ monoclonal antibody (IgG1) with the C-terminal end of the heavy chain fused to an anti-VEGF-A scFv comprising an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO:498 (c1111.1 scFv), SEQ ID NO:500 (c870.1 scFv), SEQ ID NO:502 (c1092.1 scFv), SEQ ID NO:504 (c1039.1 scFv), SEQ ID NO:506 (c868.1 scFv), SEQ ID NO:508 (c1081.1 scFv), SEQ ID NO:607 (c868.1 scFv), SEQ ID NO:609 (c870.1 scFv), or SEQ ID NO:611 (c1039.1 scFv). In some such variations, the anti-PDGFRβ antibody has the V\nL \nand V\nH \ndomains of anti-PDGFRβ antibody c597 (SEQ ID NOs:6 and 8, respectively). In some specific variations, a biAb in accordance with the present invention comprises a first polypeptide having the amino acid sequence shown in residues 20-239 of SEQ ID NO:537 or SEQ ID NO:614 (c597.1 or c600.1 light chain) and a second polypeptide having an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of residues 20-734 of SEQ ID NO:512 (c597.1 IgG1 heavy chain with C-terminal fusion to c1111.1 scFv); residues 20-727 of SEQ ID NO:514 (c597.1 IgG1 heavy chain with C-terminal fusion to c870.1 scFv); residues 20-733 of SEQ ID NO:516 (c597.1 IgG1 heavy chain with C-terminal fusion to c1092.1 scFv); residues 20-733 of SEQ ID NO:518 (c597.1 IgG1 heavy chain with C-terminal fusion to c1039.1 scFv); residues 20-730 of SEQ ID NO:20 (c597.1 IgG1 heavy chain with C-terminal fusion to c868.1 scFv); residues 20-731 of SEQ ID NO:22 (c597.1 IgG1 heavy chain with C-terminal fusion to c1081.1 scFv); residues 20-729 of SEQ ID NO:630 (c597.1 IgG1.1 heavy chain with C-terminal fusion to c868.1 scFv); residues 20-727 of SEQ ID NO:632 (c597.1 IgG1.1 heavy chain with C-terminal fusion to c870.1 scFv); residues 20-732 of SEQ ID NO:634 (c597.1 IgG1.1 heavy chain with C-terminal fusion to c1039.1 scFv); residues 20:729 of SEQ ID NO:636 (c600.1 IgG1.1 heavy chain with C-terminal fusion to c868.1 scFv); residues 20-727 of SEQ ID NO:638 (c600.1 IgG1.1 heavy chain with C-terminal fusion to c870.1 scFv); and residues 20-732 of SEQ ID NO:640 (c600.1 IgG1.1 heavy chain with C-terminal fusion to c1039.1 scFv). A first and/or second biAb polypeptide as above may further include a secretory signal sequence such as shown, for example, in residues 1-19 of SEQ ID NO:614, residues 1-19 of SEQ ID NO:616, or residues 1-19 of SEQ ID NO:618.\n\n\n \nIII. Nucleic Acids, Host Cells, and Methods for Producing Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention also includes nucleic acids encoding the heavy chain and/or light chain of the antibodies of the invention. Nucleic acids of the invention include nucleic acids having a region that is substantially identical to a V\nL\n- and/or V\nH\n-encoding polynucleotide as listed in Table 2 or 4, supra. In certain embodiments, a nucleic acid in accordance with the present invention has at least 80%, typically at least about 90%, and more typically at least about 95% or at least about 98% identity to a V\nL\n- and/or V\nH\n-encoding polynucleotide as listed in Table 2 or 4. Nucleic acids of the invention also include complementary nucleic acids. In some instances, the sequences will be fully complementary (no mismatches) when aligned. In other instances, there may be up to about a 20% mismatch in the sequences. In some embodiments of the invention are provided nucleic acids encoding both a heavy chain and a light chain of an antibody of the invention. The nucleic acid sequences provided herein can be exploited using codon optimization, degenerate sequence, silent mutations, and other DNA techniques to optimize expression in a particular host, and the present invention encompasses such sequence modifications.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, in some aspects, the present invention provides one or more polynucleotide(s) (e.g., DNA or RNA) that encode an anti-PDGFRβ and/or anti-VEGF-A antibody as described herein. In some embodiments, a polynucleotide of the present invention encodes an anti-PDGFRβ antibody, such as, for example, an anti-PDGFRβ scFv. In other embodiments, a polynucleotide encodes an anti-VEGF-A antibody such as, for example, an anti-VEGF-A scFv. In some variations, a polynucleotide of the present invention encodes a bispecific antibody that binds and neutralizes both PDGFRβ and VEGF-A. In particular variations, the encoded bispecific antibody is a tascFv, biscFv, or biAb. Those skilled in the art will readily recognize that, in view of the degeneracy of the genetic code, considerable sequence variation is possible among these polynucleotide molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolynucleotide molecules comprising a polynucleotide sequence provided herein are propagated by placing the molecule in a vector. Viral and non-viral vectors are used, including plasmids. The choice of plasmid will depend on the type of cell in which propagation is desired and the purpose of propagation. Certain vectors are useful for amplifying and making large amounts of the desired DNA sequence. Other vectors are suitable for expression in cells in culture. Still other vectors are suitable for transfer and expression in cells in a whole animal or person. The choice of appropriate vector is well within the skill of the art. Many such vectors are available commercially. The partial or full-length polynucleotide is inserted into a vector typically by means of DNA ligase attachment to a cleaved restriction enzyme site in the vector. Alternatively, the desired nucleotide sequence can be inserted by homologous recombination in vivo. Typically this is accomplished by attaching regions of homology to the vector on the flanks of the desired nucleotide sequence. Regions of homology are added by ligation of oligonucleotides, or by polymerase chain reaction using primers comprising both the region of homology and a portion of the desired nucleotide sequence, for example.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor expression, an expression cassette or system may be employed. To express a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide disclosed herein, a nucleic acid molecule encoding the polypeptide, operably linked to regulatory sequences that control transcriptional expression in an expression vector, is introduced into a host cell. In addition to transcriptional regulatory sequences, such as promoters and enhancers, expression vectors can include translational regulatory sequences and a marker gene which is suitable for selection of cells that carry the expression vector. The gene product encoded by a polynucleotide of the invention is expressed in any convenient expression system, including, for example, bacterial, yeast, insect, amphibian and mammalian systems. Suitable vectors and host cells are described, e.g., in U.S. Pat. No. 5,654,173. In the expression vector, the polypeptide-encoding polynucleotide is linked to a regulatory sequence as appropriate to obtain the desired expression properties. These can include promoters, enhancers, terminators, operators, repressors, and inducers. The promoters can be regulated (e.g., the promoter from the steroid inducible pIND vector (Invitrogen)) or constitutive (e.g., promoters from CMV, SV40, Elongation Factor, or LTR sequences). In some situations it may be desirable to use conditionally active promoters, such as tissue-specific or developmental stage-specific promoters. These are linked to the desired nucleotide sequence using the techniques described above for linkage to vectors. Any techniques known in the art can be used. Accordingly, the expression vector will generally provide a transcriptional and translational initiation region, which may be inducible or constitutive, where the coding region is operably linked under the transcriptional control of the transcriptional initiation region, and a transcriptional and translational termination region.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn expression cassette (“expression unit”) may be introduced into a variety of vectors, e.g., plasmid, BAC, YAC, bacteriophage such as lambda, P1, M13, etc., plant or animal viral vectors (e.g., retroviral-based vectors, adenovirus vectors), and the like, where the vectors are normally characterized by the ability to provide selection of cells comprising the expression vectors. The vectors may provide for extrachromosomal maintenance, particularly as plasmids or viruses, or for integration into the host chromosome. Where extrachromosomal maintenance is desired, an origin sequence is provided for the replication of the plasmid, which may be low- or high copy-number. A wide variety of markers are available for selection, particularly those which protect against toxins, more particularly against antibiotics. The particular marker that is chosen is selected in accordance with the nature of the host, where in some cases, complementation may be employed with auxotrophic hosts. Introduction of the DNA construct may use any convenient method, including, e.g., conjugation, bacterial transformation, calcium-precipitated DNA, electroporation, fusion, transfection, infection with viral vectors, biolistics, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, proteins for use within the present invention can be produced in genetically engineered host cells according to conventional techniques. Suitable host cells are those cell types that can be transformed or transfected with exogenous DNA and grown in culture, and include bacteria, fungal cells, and cultured higher eukaryotic cells (including cultured cells of multicellular organisms), particularly cultured mammalian cells. Techniques for manipulating cloned DNA molecules and introducing exogenous DNA into a variety of host cells are disclosed by Sambrook et al., \nMolecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual \n(2nd ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989), and Ausubel et al., supra.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, for recombinant expression of an anti-VEGF-A and/or anti-PDGFRβ antibody, an expression vector may encode a heavy and/or light chain thereof, or a heavy and/or light chain variable domain, operably linked to a promoter. An expression vector may include, for example, the nucleotide sequence encoding the constant region(s) of the antibody molecule (see, e.g., PCT Publication WO 86/05807; PCT Publication WO 89/01036; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,122,464), and the variable domain(s) of the antibody may be cloned into such a vector for expression of the entire heavy and/or light chain. The expression vector is transferred to a host cell by conventional techniques, and the transfected cells are then cultured by conventional techniques to produce the anti-VEGF-A and/or anti-PDGFRβ antibody. In certain embodiments for the expression of double-chained antibodies, the heavy and light chains are co-expressed from separate vectors in the host cell for expression of the entire immunoglobulin molecule. In other embodiments for the expression of double-chained antibodies, the heavy and light chains are co-expressed from separate expression units in the same vector in the host cell for expression of the entire immunoglobulin molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain variations, a bispecific antibody against both VEGF-A and PDGFRβ is expressed. In some such variations, where the antigen binding sites for both an anti-VEGF-A antibody and an anti-PDGFRβ antibody are present on a single polypeptide chain (such as, e.g., in the case of a tascFv or biscFv), an expression vector includes an expression unit comprising a transcription promoter, a nucleic acid segment encoding the polypeptide chain, and a transcription terminator, all in operable configuration. In specific embodiments for expression of a biscFv, the polypeptide encoded by the nucleic acid segment comprises an amino acid selected from the group consisting of residues 20-770 of SEQ ID NO:618 (c941.1-c868.1 biscFv); residues 20-768 of SEQ ID NO:620 (c941.1-c870.1 biscFv); residues 20-773 of SEQ ID NO:622 (c941.1-c1039.1 biscFv); residues 20-770 of SEQ ID NO:624 (c1035.1-c868.1 biscFv); residues 20-768 of SEQ ID NO:626 (c1035.1-c870.1 biscFv); and residues 20-773 of SEQ ID NO:628 (c1035.1-c1039.1 biscFv).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other variations, where the bispecific antibody includes at least two different polypeptide chains to form a molecule having both anti-VEGF-A and anti-PDGFRβ antigen binding sites (such as, e.g., in the case of a biAb), separate expression units, each capable of expressing one of the polypeptide chains, may be used. For co-expression within a host cell, such separate expression units may be present on separate expression vectors or, alternatively, a single vector. For example, in some embodiments for expression of a biAb comprising (i) an immunoglobulin light chain and (ii) an immunoglobulin γ heavy chain with an scFv fused at the carboxyl-terminus (IgG-scFv fusion), an expression vector includes first and second expression units, wherein the first expression unit comprises, in operable combination, a first transcription promoter, a first DNA segment encoding the immunoglobulin light chain, and a first transcription terminator; and wherein the second expression unit comprises, in operable combination, a second transcription promoter, a second DNA segment encoding the IgG-scFv fusion, and a second transcription terminator. In some alternative embodiments for expression of a biAb as above, the first and second expression units are present on separate expression vectors. The DNA segments encoding the immunoglobulin light chain and IgG-scFv fusion, whether on the same vector or separate vectors, may be co-expressed within a host cell to produce the biAb. In some specific embodiments for expression of a biAb, the first DNA segment encodes an immunoglobulin light chain comprising the amino acid sequence as shown in residues 20-239 of SEQ ID NO:537, and the second DNA segment encodes an IgG-scFv fusion comprising an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of amino acid residues 20-729 of SEQ ID NO:630, amino acid residues 20-732 of SEQ ID NO:634, amino acid residues 20-729 of SEQ ID NO:636, and amino acid residues 20-732 of SEQ ID NO:640. In other specific embodiments for expression of a biAb, the first DNA segment encodes an immunoglobulin light chain comprising the amino acid sequence as shown in residues 20-239 of SEQ ID NO:537, and the second DNA segment encodes an IgG-scFv fusion comprising an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of amino acid residues 20-727 of SEQ ID NO:632 and amino acid residues 20-727 of SEQ ID NO:638.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo direct a recombinant protein into the secretory pathway of a host cell, a secretory signal sequence (also known as a leader sequence, prepro sequence or pre sequence) is provided in the expression vector. The secretory signal sequence may be that of the native form of the recombinant protein, or may be derived from another secreted protein (e.g., t-PA; see U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,655) or synthesized de novo. The secretory signal sequence is operably linked to the protein-encoding DNA sequence, i.e., the two sequences are joined in the correct reading frame and positioned to direct the newly synthesized polypeptide into the secretory pathway of the host cell. Secretory signal sequences are commonly positioned 5′ to the DNA sequence encoding the polypeptide of interest, although certain signal sequences may be positioned elsewhere in the DNA sequence of interest (see, e.g., Welch et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,037,743; Holland et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,143,830). In particular variations, a secretory signal sequence for use in accordance with the present invention has an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of residues 1-19 of SEQ ID NO:614, residues 1-19 of SEQ ID NO:616, and residues 1-19 of SEQ ID NO:618; exemplary nucleotide sequences coding for these amino acid sequences are shown, respectively, in residues 1-57 of SEQ ID NO:613, residues 1-57 of SEQ ID NO:615, and residues 1-57 of SEQ ID NO:617.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCultured mammalian cells are suitable hosts for production of recombinant proteins for use within the present invention. Methods for introducing exogenous DNA into mammalian host cells include calcium phosphate-mediated transfection (Wigler et al., \nCell \n14:725, 1978; Corsaro and Pearson, \nSomatic Cell Genetics \n7:603, 1981: Graham and Van der Eb, \nVirology \n52:456, 1973), electroporation (Neumann et al., \nEMBO J. \n1:841-845, 1982), DEAE-dextran mediated transfection (Ausubel et al., supra), and liposome-mediated transfection (Hawley-Nelson et al., \nFocus \n15:73, 1993; Ciccarone et al., \nFocus \n15:80, 1993). The production of recombinant polypeptides in cultured mammalian cells is disclosed by, for example, Levinson et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,713,339; Hagen et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,784,950; Palmiter et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,579,821; and Ringold, U.S. Pat. No. 4,656,134. Examples of suitable mammalian host cells include African green monkey kidney cells (Vero; ATCC CRL 1587), human embryonic kidney cells (293-HEK; ATCC CRL 1573), baby hamster kidney cells (BHK-21, BHK-570; ATCC CRL 8544, ATCC CRL 10314), canine kidney cells (MDCK; ATCC CCL 34), Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1; ATCC CCL61; CHO DG44; CHO DXB11 (Hyclone, Logan, Utah); see also, e.g., Chasin et al., \nSom. Cell. Molec. Genet. \n12:555, 1986)), rat pituitary cells (GH1; ATCC CCL82), HeLa S3 cells (ATCC CCL2.2), rat hepatoma cells (H-4-II-E; ATCC CRL 1548) SV40-transformed monkey kidney cells (COS-1; ATCC CRL 1650) and murine embryonic cells (NIH-3T3; ATCC CRL 1658). Additional suitable cell lines are known in the art and available from public depositories such as the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va. Strong transcription promoters can be used, such as promoters from SV-40 or cytomegalovirus. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,956,288. Other suitable promoters include those from metallothionein genes (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,579,821 and 4,601,978) and the adenovirus major late promoter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDrug selection is generally used to select for cultured mammalian cells into which foreign DNA has been inserted. Such cells are commonly referred to as “transfectants.” Cells that have been cultured in the presence of the selective agent and are able to pass the gene of interest to their progeny are referred to as “stable transfectants.” Exemplary selectable markers include a gene encoding resistance to the antibiotic neomycin, which allows selection to be carried out in the presence of a neomycin-type drug, such as G-418 or the like; the gpt gene for xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase, which permits host cell growth in the presence of mycophenolic acid/xanthine; and markers that provide resistance to zeocin, bleomycin, blastocidin, and hygromycin (see, e.g., Gatignol et al., \nMol. Gen. Genet. \n207:342, 1987; Drocourt et al., \nNucl. Acids Res. \n18:4009, 1990). Selection systems can also be used to increase the expression level of the gene of interest, a process referred to as “amplification.” Amplification is carried out by culturing transfectants in the presence of a low level of the selective agent and then increasing the amount of selective agent to select for cells that produce high levels of the products of the introduced genes. An exemplary amplifiable selectable marker is dihydrofolate reductase, which confers resistance to methotrexate. Other drug resistance genes (e.g., hygromycin resistance, multi-drug resistance, puromycin acetyltransferase) can also be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther higher eukaryotic cells can also be used as hosts, including insect cells, plant cells and avian cells. The use of \nAgrobacterium rhizogenes \nas a vector for expressing genes in plant cells has been reviewed by Sinkar et al., \nJ. Biosci\n. (Bangalore) 11:47-58, 1987. Transformation of insect cells and production of foreign polypeptides therein is disclosed by Guarino et al., U.S. Pat.

See King and Possee, \nThe Baculovirus Expression System: A Laboratory Guide \n(Chapman & Hall, London); O'Reilly et al., \nBaculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual \n(Oxford University Press, New York 1994); and \nBaculovirus Expression Protocols. Methods in Molecular Biology \n(Richardson ed., Humana Press, Totowa, N.J., 1995). Recombinant baculovirus can also be produced through the use of a transposon-based system described by Luckow et al. (\nJ. Virol. \n67:4566-4579, 1993). This system, which utilizes transfer vectors, is commercially available in kit form (BAC-TO-BAC kit; Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, Md.). The transfer vector (e.g., PFASTBAC1; Life Technologies) contains a Tn7 transposon to move the DNA encoding the protein of interest into a baculovirus genome maintained in \nE. coli \nas a large plasmid called a “bacmid.” See Hill-Perkins and Possee, \nJ. Gen. Virol. \n71:971-976, 1990; Bonning et al., \nJ. Gen. Virol. \n75:1551-1556, 1994; and Chazenbalk and Rapoport, \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n270:1543-1549, 1995. In addition, transfer vectors can include an in-frame fusion with DNA encoding a polypeptide extension or affinity tag as disclosed above. Using techniques known in the art, a transfer vector containing a protein-encoding DNA sequence is transformed into \nE. coli \nhost cells, and the cells are screened for bacmids which contain an interrupted lacZ gene indicative of recombinant baculovirus. The bacmid DNA containing the recombinant baculovirus genome is isolated, using common techniques, and used to transfect \nSpodoptera frugiperda \ncells, such as Sf9 cells. Recombinant virus that expresses the protein or interest is subsequently produced. Recombinant viral stocks are made by methods commonly used in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor protein production, the recombinant virus is used to infect host cells, typically a cell line derived from the fall armyworm, \nSpodoptera frugiperda \n(e.g., Sf9 or Sf21 cells) or \nTrichoplusia ni \n(e.g., HIGH FIVE cells; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). See generally Glick and Pasternak, \nMolecular Biotechnology, Principles \n& \nApplications of Recombinant DNA \n(ASM Press, Washington, D.C., 1994). See also U.S. Pat. No. 5,300,435. Serum-free media are used to grow and maintain the cells. Suitable media formulations are known in the art and can be obtained from commercial suppliers. The cells are grown up from an inoculation density of approximately 2-5×10\n5 \ncells to a density of 1-2×10\n6 \ncells, at which time a recombinant viral stock is added at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 to 10, more typically near 3. Procedures used are generally described in available laboratory manuals (see, e.g., King and Possee, supra; O'Reilly et al., supra; Richardson, supra).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFungal cells, including yeast cells, can also be used within the present invention. Yeast species of particular interest in this regard include \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae, Pichia pastoris\n, and \nPichia methanolica\n. Methods for transforming \nS. cerevisiae \ncells with exogenous DNA and producing recombinant polypeptides therefrom are disclosed by, for example, Kawasaki, U.S. Pat. No. 4,599,311; Kawasaki et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,931,373; Brake, U.S. Pat. No. 4,870,008; Welch et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,037,743; and Murray et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,845,075. Transformed cells are selected by phenotype determined by the selectable marker, commonly drug resistance or the ability to grow in the absence of a particular nutrient (e.g., leucine). An exemplary vector system for use in \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae \nis the POT1 vector system disclosed by Kawasaki et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,931,373), which allows transformed cells to be selected by growth in glucose-containing media. Suitable promoters and terminators for use in yeast include those from glycolytic enzyme genes (see, e.g., Kawasaki, U.S. Pat. No. 4,599,311; Kingsman et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,615,974; and Bitter, U.S. Pat. No. 4,977,092) and alcohol dehydrogenase genes. See also U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,990,446; 5,063,154; 5,139,936; and 4,661,454. Transformation systems for other yeasts, including \nHansenula polymorpha, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Kluyveromyces lactis, Kluyveromyces fragilis, Ustilago maydis, Pichia pastoris, Pichia methanolica, Pichia guillermondii\n, and \nCandida maltosa \nare known in the art. See, e.g., Gleeson et al., \nJ. Gen. Microbiol. \n132:3459-3465, 1986; Cregg, U.S. Pat. No. 4,882,279; and Raymond et al., \nYeast \n14:11-23, 1998. \nAspergillus \ncells may be utilized according to the methods of McKnight et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,935,349. Methods for transforming \nAcremonium chrysogenum \nare disclosed by Sumino et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,162,228. Methods for transforming \nNeurospora \nare disclosed by Lambowitz, U.S. Pat. No. 4,486,533. Production of recombinant proteins in \nPichia methanolica \nis disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,716,808; 5,736,383; 5,854,039; and 5,888,768.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProkaryotic host cells, including strains of the bacteria \nEscherichia coli, Bacillus\n, and other genera are also useful host cells within the present invention. Techniques for transforming these hosts and expressing foreign DNA sequences cloned therein are well known in the art (see, e.g., Sambrook et al., supra). When expressing a recombinant protein in bacteria such as \nE. coli\n, the protein may be retained in the cytoplasm, typically as insoluble granules, or may be directed to the periplasmic space by a bacterial secretion sequence. In the former case, the cells are lysed, and the granules are recovered and denatured using, for example, guanidine isothiocyanate or urea. The denatured protein can then be refolded and dimerized by diluting the denaturant, such as by dialysis against a solution of urea and a combination of reduced and oxidized glutathione, followed by dialysis against a buffered saline solution. In the alternative, the protein may be recovered from the cytoplasm in soluble form and isolated without the use of denaturants. The protein is recovered from the cell as an aqueous extract in, for example, phosphate buffered saline. To capture the protein of interest, the extract is applied directly to a chromatographic medium, such as an immobilized antibody or heparin-Sepharose column. Secreted proteins can be recovered from the periplasmic space in a soluble and functional form by disrupting the cells (by, for example, sonication or osmotic shock) to release the contents of the periplasmic space and recovering the protein, thereby obviating the need for denaturation and refolding. Antibodies, including single-chain antibodies, can be produced in bacterial host cells according to known methods. See, e.g., Bird et al., \nScience \n242:423-426, 1988; Huston et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n85:5879-5883, 1988; and Pantoliano et al., \nBiochem. \n30:10117-10125, 1991.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTransformed or transfected host cells are cultured according to conventional procedures in a culture medium containing nutrients and other components required for the growth of the chosen host cells. A variety of suitable media, including defined media and complex media, are known in the art and generally include a carbon source, a nitrogen source, essential amino acids, vitamins and minerals. Media may also contain such components as growth factors or serum, as required. The growth medium will generally select for cells containing the exogenously added DNA by, for example, drug selection or deficiency in an essential nutrient which is complemented by the selectable marker carried on the expression vector or co-transfected into the host cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVEGF-A and PDGFRβ antagonist proteins are purified by conventional protein purification methods, typically by a combination of chromatographic techniques. See generally \nAffinity Chromatography Principles \n& \nMethods \n(Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology, Uppsala, Sweden, 1988); Scopes, \nProtein Purification: Principles and Practice \n(Springer-Verlag, New York 1994). Proteins comprising an immunoglobulin heavy chain polypeptide can be purified by affinity chromatography on immobilized protein A. Additional purification steps, such as gel filtration, can be used to obtain the desired level of purity or to provide for desalting, buffer exchange, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies can be purified from cell culture media by known methods, such as affinity chromatography using conventional columns and other equipment. In a typical procedure, conditioned medium is harvested and may be stored at 4° C. for up to five days. To avoid contamination, a bacteriostatic agent (e.g., sodium azide) is generally added. The pH of the medium is lowered (typically to Ph ˜5.5), such as by the addition of glacial acetic acid dropwise. The lower pH provides for optimal capture of IgG via a protein G resin. The protein G column size is determined based on the volume of the conditioned medium. The packed column is neutralized with a suitable buffer, such as 35 mM NaPO\n4\n, 120 mM NaCl pH 7.2. The medium is then passed over the neutralized protein g resin at a flow rate determined by both the volume of the medium and of the column size. The flowthrough is retained for possible additional passes over the column. The resin with the captured antibody is then washed into the neutralizing buffer. The column is eluted into fractions using an acidic elution buffer, such as 0.1M glycine, pH 2.7 or equivalent. Each fraction is neutralized, such as with 2M tris, pH 8.0 at a 1:20 ratio tris:glycine. Protein containing fractions (e.g., based on A\n280\n) are pooled. The pooled fractions are buffer exchanged into a suitable buffer, such as 35 mM NaPO\n4\n, 120 mM NaCl pH 7.2 using a desalting column. Concentration is determined by A\n280 \nusing an extinction coefficient of 1.44. Endotoxin levels may be determined by LAL assay. Purified protein may be stored frozen, typically at −80° C.\n\n\n \nIV. Methods of Treatment\n\n\n \n \n \nA. General\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the present invention provides methods of inhibiting angiogenesis, particularly methods for treatment of diseases or disorders associated with angiogenesis. Generally, such methods include administering to a subject a PDGFRβ and/or VEGF-A antagonist in an amount effective to inhibit angiogenesis. More particularly, for therapeutic use, the PDGFRβ and/or VEGF-A antagonist is administered to a subject suffering from, or at an elevated risk of developing, a disease or disorder characterized by increased angiogenesis (a “neovascular disorder”). Neovascular disorders amenable to treatment in accordance with the present invention include, for example, cancers characterized by solid tumor growth (e.g., pancreatic cancer, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST)) as well as various neovascular ocular disorders (e.g., age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, iris neovascularization, and neovascular glaucoma). Other neovascular disorders amenable to treatment in accordance with the present invention include, for example, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, atherosclerosis, chronic inflammation, lung inflammation, preeclampsia, pericardial effusion (such as that associated with pericarditis), and pleural effusion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments comprising the use of a PDGFRβ antagonist, the PDGFRβ antagonist is an anti-PDGFRβ antibody as described herein. In some such variations, the anti-PDGFRβ antibody is used in combination with a VEGF-A antagonist, such as, for example, a neutralizing antibody that specifically binds to VEGF-A or to a VEGF-A receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments comprising the use of a VEGF-A antagonist, the VEGF-A antagonist is an anti-VEGF-A antibody as described herein. In some such variations, the anti-VEGF-A antibody is used in combination with a PDGFRβ antagonist, such as, for example, a neutralizing antibody that specifically binds to PDGFRβ or to a PDGF ligand (e.g., PDGF-B or PDGF-D).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn preferred variations, both a PDGFRβ and a VEGF-A antagonist are used. Particularly preferred are the use of a neutralizing anti-PDGFRβ antibody as described herein in combination with a neutralizing anti-VEGF-A antibody as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn each embodiments comprising the use of an PDGFRβ antagonists in combination with a VEGF-A antagonist, the PDGFRβ antagonists and VEGF-A antagonist may be administered either simultaneously or separately (e.g., at different times and/or at separate administration sites). Accordingly, in certain variations comprising the simultaneous administration of a PDGFRβ antagonist and a VEGF-A antagonist, the method includes administration of a bispecific binding composition comprising (a) an antibody that specially binds to the extracellular domain of PDGFRβ and neutralizes PDGFRβ activity and (b) an antibody that specifically binds to VEGF-A and neutralizes VEGF-A activity. In particularly preferred embodiments, administration of the PDGFRβ antagonist and the VEGF-A antagonist comprises administering a bispecific antibody that binds to and neutralizes both PDGFRβ and VEGF-A. In certain embodiments comprising separate administration of a PDGFRβ antagonists and a VEGF-A antagonist, the PDGFRβ antagonist and VEGF-A antagonist are administered sequentially. In such embodiments, the administration of each agent can be by the same or different methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn each of the embodiments of the treatment methods described herein, the PDGFRβ and/or VEGF-A antagonist is delivered in a manner consistent with conventional methodologies associated with management of the disease or disorder for which treatment is sought. In accordance with the disclosure herein, an effective amount of the antagonists is administered to a subject in need of such treatment for a time and under conditions sufficient to prevent or treat the disease or disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubjects for administration antagonists as described herein include patients at high risk for developing a particular disease or disorder associated with angiogenesis as well as patients presenting with an existing neovascular disorder. In certain embodiments, the subject has been diagnosed as having the disease or disorder for which treatment is sought. Further, subjects can be monitored during the course of treatment for any change in the disease or disorder (e.g., for an increase or decrease in clinical symptoms of the disease or disorder). Also, in some variations, the subject does not suffer from another disease or disorder requiring treatment that involves inhibiting either or both of the PDGFRβ and VEGF-A pathways.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn prophylactic applications, pharmaceutical compositions or medicants are administered to a patient susceptible to, or otherwise at risk of, a particular disease in an amount sufficient to eliminate or reduce the risk or delay the outset of the disease. In therapeutic applications, compositions or medicants are administered to a patient suspected of, or already suffering from such a disease in an amount sufficient to cure, or at least partially arrest, the symptoms of the disease and its complications. An amount adequate to accomplish this is referred to as a therapeutically- or pharmaceutically-effective dose or amount. In both prophylactic and therapeutic regimes, agents are usually administered in several dosages until a sufficient response (e.g., inhibition of inappropriate angiogenesis activity) has been achieved. Typically, the response is monitored and repeated dosages are given if the desired response starts to fade.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo identify subject patients for treatment according to the methods of the invention, accepted screening methods may be employed to determine risk factors associated with specific neovascular disorders or to determine the status of an existing disorder identified in a subject. Such methods can include, for example, determining whether an individual has relatives who have been diagnosed with a particular disease. Screening methods can also include, for example, conventional work-ups to determine familial status for a particular disease known to have a heritable component. For example, various cancers are also known to have certain inheritable components. Inheritable components of cancers include, for example, mutations in multiple genes that are transforming (e.g., Ras, Raf, EGFR, cMet, and others), the presence or absence of certain HLA and killer inhibitory receptor (KIR) molecules, or mechanisms by which cancer cells are able to modulate immune suppression of cells like NK cells and T cells, either directly or indirectly (see, e.g., Ljunggren and Malmberg, \nNature Rev. Immunol. \n7:329-339, 2007; Boyton and Altmann, \nClin. Exp. Immunol. \n149:1-8, 2007). Toward this end, nucleotide probes can be routinely employed to identify individuals carrying genetic markers associated with a particular disease of interest. In addition, a wide variety of immunological methods are known in the art that are useful to identify markers for specific diseases. For example, various ELISA immunoassay methods are available and well-known in the art that employ monoclonal antibody probes to detect antigens associated with specific tumors. Screening may be implemented as indicated by known patient symptomology, age factors, related risk factors, etc. These methods allow the clinician to routinely select patients in need of the methods described herein for treatment. In accordance with these methods, inhibition of angiogenesis may be implemented as an independent treatment program or as a follow-up, adjunct, or coordinate treatment regimen to other treatments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor administration, the PDGFRβ and/or VEGF-A antagonist is formulated as a pharmaceutical composition. A pharmaceutical composition comprising a PDGFRβ and/or VEGF-A antagonist can be formulated according to known methods to prepare pharmaceutically useful compositions, whereby the therapeutic molecule is combined in a mixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. A composition is said to be a “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” if its administration can be tolerated by a recipient patient. Sterile phosphate-buffered saline is one example of a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Other suitable carriers are well-known to those in the art. (See, e.g., Gennaro (ed.), \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences \n(Mack Publishing Company, 19th ed. 1995).) Formulations may further include one or more excipients, preservatives, solubilizers, buffering agents, albumin to prevent protein loss on vial surfaces, etc. Monospecific antagonists can be individually formulated or provided in a combined formulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA pharmaceutical composition comprising a PDGFRβ and/or VEGF-A antagonist is administered to a subject in an effective amount. According to the methods of the present invention, an antagonist may be administered to subjects by a variety of administration modes, including, for example, by intramuscular, subcutaneous, intravenous, intra-atrial, intra-articular, parenteral, intranasal, intrapulmonary, transdermal, intrapleural, intrathecal, and oral routes of administration. For pharmaceutical use for treatment of neovascular ocular disorders, the PDGFRβ and/or VEGF-A antagonists are typically formulated for intravitreal injection according to conventional methods. For prevention and treatment purposes, an antagonist may be administered to a subject in a single bolus delivery, via continuous delivery (e.g., continuous transdermal delivery) over an extended time period, or in a repeated administration protocol (e.g., on an hourly, daily, or weekly basis).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “therapeutically effective amount” of a composition is that amount that produces a statistically significant effect, such as a statistically significant reduction in disease progression or a statistically significant improvement in organ function. The exact dose will be determined by the clinician according to accepted standards, taking into account the nature and severity of the condition to be treated, patient traits, etc. Determination of dose is within the level of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDetermination of effective dosages in this context is typically based on animal model studies followed up by human clinical trials and is guided by determining effective dosages and administration protocols that significantly reduce the occurrence or severity of the subject disease or disorder in model subjects. Effective doses of the compositions of the present invention vary depending upon many different factors, including means of administration, target site, physiological state of the patient, whether the patient is human or an animal, other medications administered, whether treatment is prophylactic or therapeutic, as well as the specific activity of the composition itself and its ability to elicit the desired response in the individual. Usually, the patient is a human, but in some diseases, the patient can be a nonhuman mammal. Typically, dosage regimens are adjusted to provide an optimum therapeutic response, i.e., to optimize safety and efficacy. Accordingly, a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount is also one in which any undesired collateral effects are outweighed by beneficial effects of inhibiting angiogenesis. For administration of a PDGFRβ and/or VEGF-A antagonist, a dosage typically ranges from about 0.1 μg to 100 mg/kg or 1 μg/kg to about 50 mg/kg, and more usually 10 μg to 5 mg/kg of the subject's body weight. In more specific embodiments, an effective amount of the agent is between about 1 μg/kg and about 20 mg/kg, between about 10 μg/kg and about 10 mg/kg, or between about 0.1 mg/kg and about 5 mg/kg. Dosages within this range can be achieved by single or multiple administrations, including, e.g., multiple administrations per day or daily, weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly administrations. For example, in certain variations, a regimen consists of an initial administration followed by multiple, subsequent administrations at weekly or bi-weekly intervals. Another regimen consists of an initial administration followed by multiple, subsequent administrations at monthly or bi-monthly intervals. Alternatively, administrations can be on an irregular basis as indicated by monitoring of NK cell activity and/or clinical symptoms of the disease or disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDosage of the pharmaceutical composition may be varied by the attending clinician to maintain a desired concentration at a target site. For example, if an intravenous mode of delivery is selected, local concentration of the agent in the bloodstream at the target tissue may be between about 1-50 nanomoles of the composition per liter, sometimes between about 1.0 nanomole per liter and 10, 15, or 25 nanomoles per liter depending on the subject's status and projected measured response. Higher or lower concentrations may be selected based on the mode of delivery, e.g., trans-epidermal delivery versus delivery to a mucosal surface. Dosage should also be adjusted based on the release rate of the administered formulation, e.g., nasal spray versus powder, sustained release oral or injected particles, transdermal formulations, etc. To achieve the same serum concentration level, for example, slow-release particles with a release rate of 5 nanomolar (under standard conditions) would be administered at about twice the dosage of particles with a release rate of 10 nanomolar.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA pharmaceutical composition comprising a PDGFRβ and/or VEGF-A antagonist can be furnished in liquid form, in an aerosol, or in solid form. Liquid forms, are illustrated by injectable solutions, aerosols, droplets, topological solutions and oral suspensions. Exemplary solid forms include capsules, tablets, and controlled-release forms. The latter form is illustrated by miniosmotic pumps and implants. (See, e.g., Bremer et al., \nPharm. Biotechnol. \n10:239, 1997; Ranade, “Implants in Drug Delivery,” in \nDrug Delivery Systems \n95-123 (Ranade and Hollinger, eds., CRC Press 1995); Bremer et al., “Protein Delivery with Infusion Pumps,” in \nProtein Delivery: Physical Systems \n239-254 (Sanders and Hendren, eds., Plenum Press 1997); Yewey et al., “Delivery of Proteins from a Controlled Release Injectable Implant,” in \nProtein Delivery: Physical Systems \n93-117 (Sanders and Hendren, eds., Plenum Press 1997).) Other solid forms include creams, pastes, other topological applications, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiposomes provide one means to deliver therapeutic polypeptides to a subject, e.g., intravenously, intraperitoneally, intrathecally, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, or via oral administration, inhalation, or intranasal administration. Liposomes are microscopic vesicles that consist of one or more lipid bilayers surrounding aqueous compartments. (See, generally, Bakker-Woudenberg et al., \nEur. J. Clin. Microbial. Infect. Dis. \n12 (Suppl 1):S61, 1993; Kim, \nDrugs \n46:618, 1993; Ranade, “Site-Specific Drug Delivery Using Liposomes as Carriers,” in \nDrug Delivery Systems \n3-24 (Ranade and Hollinger, eds., CRC Press 1995).) Liposomes are similar in composition to cellular membranes and as a result, liposomes can be administered safely and are biodegradable. Depending on the method of preparation, liposomes may be unilamellar or multilamellar, and liposomes can vary in size with diameters ranging from 0.02 μm to greater than 10 μm. A variety of agents can be encapsulated in liposomes: hydrophobic agents partition in the bilayers and hydrophilic agents partition within the inner aqueous space(s). (See, e.g., Machy et al., \nLiposomes In Cell Biology And Pharmacology \n(John Libbey 1987); Ostro et al., \nAmerican J. Hosp. Pharm. \n46:1576, 1989.) Moreover, it is possible to control the therapeutic availability of the encapsulated agent by varying liposome size, the number of bilayers, lipid composition, as well as the charge and surface characteristics of the liposomes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiposomes can adsorb to virtually any type of cell and then slowly release the encapsulated agent. Alternatively, an absorbed liposome may be endocytosed by cells that are phagocytic. Endocytosis is followed by intralysosomal degradation of liposomal lipids and release of the encapsulated agents (see Scherphof et al., \nAnn. N.Y. Acad. Sci. \n446:368, 1985). After intravenous administration, small liposomes (0.1 to 1.0 μm) are typically taken up by cells of the reticuloendothelial system, located principally in the liver and spleen, whereas liposomes larger than 3.0 μm are deposited in the lung. This preferential uptake of smaller liposomes by the cells of the reticuloendothelial system has been used to deliver chemotherapeutic agents to macrophages and to tumors of the liver.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe reticuloendothelial system can be circumvented by several methods including saturation with large doses of liposome particles, or selective macrophage inactivation by pharmacological means (see Claassen et al., \nBiochim. Biophys. Acta \n802:428, 1984). In addition, incorporation of glycolipid- or polyethelene glycol-derivatized phospholipids into liposome membranes has been shown to result in a significantly reduced uptake by the reticuloendothelial system (see Allen et al., \nBiochim. Biophys. Acta \n1068:133, 1991; Allen et al., \nBiochim. Biophys. Acta \n1150:9, 1993).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiposomes can also be prepared to target particular cells or organs by varying phospholipid composition or by inserting receptors or counter-receptors into the liposomes. For example, liposomes, prepared with a high content of a nonionic surfactant, have been used to target the liver. (See, e.g., Japanese Patent 04-244,018 to Hayakawa et al.; Kato et al., \nBiol. Pharm. Bull \n16:960, 1993.) These formulations were prepared by mixing soybean phospatidylcholine, α-tocopherol, and ethoxylated hydrogenated castor oil (HCO-60) in methanol, concentrating the mixture under vacuum, and then reconstituting the mixture with water. A liposomal formulation of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) with a soybean-derived sterylglucoside mixture (SG) and cholesterol (Ch) has also been shown to target the liver. (See Shimizu et al., \nBiol. Pharm. Bull \n20:881, 1997.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, various targeting counter-receptors can be bound to the surface of the liposome, such as antibodies, antibody fragments, carbohydrates, vitamins, and transport proteins. For example, for targeting to the liver, liposomes can be modified with branched type galactosyllipid derivatives to target asialoglycoprotein (galactose) receptors, which are exclusively expressed on the surface of liver cells. (See Kato and Sugiyama, \nCrit. Rev. Ther. Drug Carrier Syst. \n14:287, 1997; Murahashi et al., \nBiol. Pharm. Bull. \n20:259, 1997.) In a more general approach to tissue targeting, target cells are prelabeled with biotinylated antibodies specific for a counter-receptor expressed by the target cell. (See Harasym et al., \nAdv. Drug Deliv. Rev. \n32:99, 1998.) After plasma elimination of free antibody, streptavidin-conjugated liposomes are administered. In another approach, targeting antibodies are directly attached to liposomes. (See Harasym et al., supra.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolypeptides and antibodies can be encapsulated within liposomes using standard techniques of protein microencapsulation. (See, e.g., Anderson et al., \nInfect. Immun. \n31:1099, 1981; Anderson et al., \nCancer Res. \n50:1853, 1990; Cohen et al., \nBiochim. Biophys. Acta \n1063:95, 1991; Alving et al. “Preparation and Use of Liposomes in Immunological Studies,” in \nLiposome Technology \n(Vol. III) 317 (Gregoriadis, ed., CRC Press, 2nd ed. 1993); Wassef et al., \nMeth. Enzymol. \n149:124, 1987.) As noted above, therapeutically useful liposomes may contain a variety of components. For example, liposomes may comprise lipid derivatives of poly(ethylene glycol). (See Allen et al., \nBiochim. Biophys. Acta \n1150:9, 1993.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDegradable polymer micro spheres have been designed to maintain high systemic levels of therapeutic proteins. Micro spheres are prepared from degradable polymers such as poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLG), polyanhydrides, poly (ortho esters), nonbiodegradable ethylvinyl acetate polymers, in which proteins are entrapped in the polymer. (See, e.g., Gombotz and Pettit, \nBioconjugate Chem. \n6:332, 1995; Ranade, “Role of Polymers in Drug Delivery,” in \nDrug Delivery Systems \n51-93 (Ranade and Hollinger, eds., CRC Press 1995); Roskos and Maskiewicz, “Degradable Controlled Release Systems Useful for Protein Delivery,” in \nProtein Delivery: Physical Systems \n45-92 (Sanders and Hendren, eds., Plenum Press 1997); Bartus et al., \nScience \n281:1161, 1998; Putney and Burke, \nNature Biotechnology \n16:153, 1998; Putney, \nCurr. Opin. Chem. Biol. \n2:548, 1998.) Polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated nanospheres can also provide carriers for intravenous administration of therapeutic proteins. (See, e.g., Gref et al., \nPharm. Biotechnol. \n10:167, 1997.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther dosage forms can be devised by those skilled in the art, as shown by, e.g., Ansel and Popovich, \nPharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems \n(Lea & Febiger, 5th ed. 1990); Gennaro (ed.), \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences \n(Mack Publishing Company, 19th ed. 1995), and Ranade and Hollinger, \nDrug Delivery Systems \n(CRC Press 1996).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions as described herein may also be used in the context of combination therapy. The term “combination therapy” is used herein to denote that a subject is administered at least one therapeutically effective dose of a PDGFRβ and/or VEGF-A antagonist and another therapeutic agent. The PDGFRβ and/or VEGF-A antagonist may be, for example, a bispecific binding composition that binds and neutralizes both PDGFRβ and VEGF-A. In particularly preferred variations, the bispecific binding composition is a bispecific antibody as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, in the context of cancer immunotherapy, compositions having PDGFRβ and/or VEGF-A antagonist activity can be used as an angiogenesis inhibition agent in combination with chemotherapy or radiation. PDGFRβ and/or VEGF-A antagonists can work in synergy with conventional types of chemotherapy or radiation. PDGFRβ and/or VEGF-A antagonists can further reduce tumor burden and allow more efficient killing by the chemotherapeutic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions of the present invention demonstrating angiogenesis inhibiting activity can also be used in combination with immunomodulatory compounds including various cytokines and co-stimulatory/inhibitory molecules. These could include, but are not limited to, the use of cytokines that stimulate anti-cancer immune responses. For instance, the combined use of IL-2 and IL-12 shows beneficial effects in T-cell lymphoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and lung cancer. (See Zaki et al., \nJ. Invest. Dermatol. \n118:366-71, 2002; Li et al., \nArch. Otolaryngol. Head Neck Surg. \n127:1319-24, 2001; Hiraki et al., \nLung Cancer \n35:329-33, 2002.) In addition, PDGFRβ and/or VEGF-A antagonists could be combined with reagents that co-stimulate various cell surface molecules found on immune-based effector cells, such as the activation of CD137. (See Wilcox et al., \nJ. Clin. Invest. \n109:651-9, 2002) or inhibition of CTLA4 (Chambers et al., \nAnn. Rev. Immunol. \n19:565-94, 2001). Alternatively, PDGFRβ and/or VEGF-A antagonists could be used with reagents that induce tumor cell apoptosis by interacting with TRAIL-related receptors. (See, e.g., Takeda et al., \nJ. Exp. Med. \n195:161-9, 2002; Srivastava, \nNeoplasia \n3:535-46, 2001.) Such reagents include TRAIL ligand, TRAIL ligand-Ig fusions, anti-TRAIL antibodies, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other variations, a PDGFRβ and/or VEGF-A antagonist is used in combination with a monoclonal antibody therapy that does not specifically target angiogenesis. Such combination therapy is particularly useful for treatment of cancer, in which the use of monoclonal antibodies, particularly antibodies directed against tumor-expressed antigens, is becoming a standard practice for many tumors including breast cell carcinoma (trastuzumab or HERCEPTIN®) and colon carcinoma (cetuximab or ERBITUX®).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions may be supplied as a kit comprising a container that comprises a therapeutic compositions as described herein. A therapeutic composition can be provided, for example, in the form of an injectable solution for single or multiple doses, or as a sterile powder that will be reconstituted before injection. Alternatively, such a kit can include a dry-powder disperser, liquid aerosol generator, or nebulizer for administration of a therapeutic composition. Such a kit may further comprise written information on indications and usage of the pharmaceutical composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nB. Cancer Treatment\n\n\n \n \n \n \n1. Types of Cancer\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCancers amenable to treatment in accordance with the present invention include cancers characterized by the presence of solid tumors. As previously discussed, the quantity of blood vessels in a tumor tissue is a strong negative prognostic indicator for cancers involving solid tumor formation, (see, e.g., Weidner et al., (1992), supra; Weidner et al., (1993), supra; Li et al., supra; Foss et al., supra), and both the VEGF and PDGF family of signaling molecules appear to play key roles in the development of new blood vessels associated with solid tumors.

For example, in some embodiments, the cancer to be treated in accordance with the present invention is selected from the following: a cancer of the head and neck (e.g., a cancer of the oral cavity, orophyarynx, nasopharynx, hypopharynx, nasal cavity or paranasal sinuses, larynx, lip, or salivary gland); a lung cancer (e.g., non-small cell lung cancer, small cell carcinoma, or mesothelimia); a gastrointestinal tract cancer (e.g., colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, esophageal cancer, or anal cancer); gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST); pancreatic adenocarcinoma; pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma; a cancer of the small intestine; a cancer of the liver or biliary tree (e.g., liver cell adenoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, hemangiosarcoma, extrahepatic or intrahepatic cholangiosarcoma, cancer of the ampulla of vater, or gallbladder cancer); a breast cancer (e.g., metastatic breast cancer or inflammatory breast cancer); a gynecologic cancer (e.g., cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, peritoneal carcinoma, vaginal cancer, vulvar cancer, gestational trophoblastic neoplasia, or uterine cancer, including endometrial cancer or uterine sarcoma); a cancer of the urinary tract (e.g., prostate cancer; bladder cancer; penile cancer; urethral cancer, or kidney cancer such as, for example, renal cell carcinoma or transitional cell carcinoma, including renal pelvis and ureter); testicular cancer; a cancer of the central nervous system (CNS) such as an intracranial tumor (e.g., astrocytoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, glioblastoma, oligodendroglioma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma, ependymoma, primary CNS lymphoma, medulloblastoma, germ cell tumor, pineal gland neoplasm, meningioma, pituitary tumor, tumor of the nerve sheath (e.g., schwannoma), chordoma, craniopharyngioma, a chloroid plexus tumor (e.g., chloroid plexus carcinoma); or other intracranial tumor of neuronal or glial origin) or a tumor of the spinal cord (e.g., schwannoma, meningioma); an endocrine neoplasm (e.g., thyroid cancer such as, for example, thyroid carcinoma, medullary cancer, or thyroid lymphoma; a pancreatic endocrine tumor such as, for example, an insulinoma or glucagonoma; an adrenal carcinoma such as, for example, pheochromocytoma; a carcinoid tumor; or a parathyroid carcinoma); a skin cancer (e.g., squamous cell carcinoma; basal cell carcinoma; Kaposi's sarcoma; or a malignant melanoma such as, for example, an intraocular melanoma); a bone cancer (e.g., a bone sarcoma such as, for example, osteosarcoma, osteochondroma, or Ewing's sarcoma); multiple myeloma; a chloroma; a soft tissue sarcoma (e.g., a fibrous tumor or fibrohistiocytic tumor); a tumor of the smooth muscle or skeletal muscle; a blood or lymph vessel perivascular tumor (e.g., Kaposi's sarcoma); a synovial tumor; a mesothelial tumor; a neural tumor; a paraganglionic tumor; an extraskeletal cartilaginous or osseous tumor; and a pluripotential mesenchymal tumor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some variations, the cancer to be treated is a childhood cancer such as, for example, brain cancer, neuroblastoma, Wilm's tumor (nephroblastoma), rhabdomyosarcoma, retinoblastoma, or hepatoblastoma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other variations, the cancer is an immunotherapeutically sensitive cancer such as, for example, melanoma, kidney cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, or lung cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome of the cancers listed above, including some of the relevant animal models for evaluating the effects of PDGFRβ and/or VEGF-A antagonist on tumor responses, are discussed in further detail below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \na. Melanoma\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuperficial spreading melanoma is the most common type of melanoma. About 7 out of 10 (70%) are this type. They occur mostly in middle-aged people. The most common place in women is on the legs, while in men it is more common on the trunk, particularly the back. They tend to start by spreading out across the surface of the skin: this is known as the radial growth phase. If the melanoma is removed at this stage there is a very high chance of cure. If the melanoma is not removed, it will start to grow down deeper into the layers of the skin. There is then a risk that it will spread in the bloodstream or lymph system to other parts of the body. Nodular melanoma occurs most often on the chest or back. It is most commonly found in middle-aged people. It tends to grow deeper into the skin quite quickly if it is not removed. This type of melanoma is often raised above the rest of the skin surface and feels like a bump. It may be very dark brown-black or black. Lentigo maligna melanoma is most commonly found on the face, particularly in older people. It grows slowly and may take several years to develop. Acral melanoma is usually found on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet or around the toenails. Other very rare types of melanoma of the skin include amelanotic melanoma (in which the melanoma loses its pigment and appears as a white area) and desmoplastic melanoma (which contains fibrous scar tissue). Malignant melanoma can start in parts of the body other than the skin but this is very rare. The parts of the body that may be affected are the eye, the mouth, under the fingernails (known as subungual melanoma) the vulval or vaginal tissues, or internally.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMost melanomas start with a change in the appearance of normal skin. This can look like an abnormal new mole. Less than a third develop in existing moles. It can be difficult to tell the difference between a mole and a melanoma, but the following checklist can be used to help. It is known as the ABCD list. Asymmetry—Ordinary moles are usually symmetrical in shape. Melanomas are likely to be irregular or asymmetrical. Border—Moles usually have a well-defined regular border. Melanomas are more likely to have an irregular border with jagged edges. Colour—Moles are usually a uniform brown. Melanomas tend to have more than one colour. They may be varying shades of brown mixed with black, red, pink, white or a bluish tint. Diameter—Moles are normally no bigger than the blunt end of a pencil (about 6 mm across). Melanomas are usually more than 7 mm in diameter. Normal moles can be raised up from the skin and/or may be hairy. Itching, crusting or bleeding may also occur in melanomas—these are less common signs but should not be ignored (cancerbacup internet website). The effects of a PDGFRβ and/or VEGF-A antagonist on tumor response can be evaluated in a murine melanoma model similar to that described in Hermans et al., \nCancer Res. \n63:8408-13, 2003; Ramont et al., \nExp. Cell Res. \n29:1-10, 2003; Safwat et al., \nJ. Exp. Ther. Oncol. \n3:161-8, 2003; and Fidler, Nat New Biol. 242:148-9, 1973.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nb. Renal Cell Carcinoma\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRenal cell carcinoma, a form of kidney cancer that involves cancerous changes in the cells of the renal tubule, is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults. Why the cells become cancerous is not known. A history of smoking greatly increases the risk for developing renal cell carcinoma. Some people may also have inherited an increased risk to develop renal cell carcinoma, and a family history of kidney cancer increases the risk. People with von Hippel-Lindau disease, a hereditary disease that affects the capillaries of the brain, commonly also develop renal cell carcinoma. Kidney disorders that require dialysis for treatment also increase the risk for developing renal cell carcinoma. The first symptom is usually blood in the urine. Sometimes both kidneys are involved. The cancer metastasizes or spreads easily, most often to the lungs and other organs, and about one-third of patients have metastasis at the time of diagnosis (Medline Plus Medical Encyclopedia Internet website). The effects of an a PDGFRβ and/or VEGF-A antagonist on tumor response can be evaluated in a murine renal cell carcinoma model similar to that described in Sayers et al., \nCancer Res. \n50:5414-20, 1990; Salup et al., \nImmunol. \n138:641-7, 1987; and Luan et al., \nTransplantation \n73:1565-72, 2002.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nc. Cervical Cancer\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cervix is the neck of the uterus that opens into the vagina. Cervical cancer, also called cervical carcinoma, develops from abnormal cells on the surface of the cervix. Cervical cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting women. Cervical cancer is usually preceded by dysplasia, precancerous changes in the cells on the surface of the cervix. These abnormal cells can progress to invasive cancer. Once the cancer appears it can progress through four stages. The stages are defined by the extent of spread of the cancer. The more the cancer has spread, the more extensive the treatment is likely to be. There are 2 main types of cervical cancer: (1) Squamous type (epidermoid cancer): This is the most common type, accounting for about 80% to 85% of cervical cancers. This cancer may be caused by sexually transmitted diseases. One such sexual disease is the human papillomavirus, which causes venereal warts. The cancerous tumor grows on and into the cervix. This cancer generally starts on the surface of the cervix and may be diagnosed at an early stage by a Pap smear. (2) Adenocarcinoma: This type of cervical cancer develops from the tissue in the cervical glands in the canal of the cervix. Early cervical cancer usually causes no symptoms. The cancer is usually detected by a Pap smear and pelvic exam. This is why you should start having Pap smears and pelvic exams as soon as you become sexually active. Healthy young women who have never been sexually active should have their first annual pelvic exam by age 18. Later stages of cervical cancer cause abnormal vaginal bleeding or a bloodstained discharge at unexpected times, such as between menstrual periods, after intercourse, or after menopause. Abnormal vaginal discharge may be cloudy or bloody or may contain mucus with a bad odor. Advanced stages of the cancer may cause pain (University of Michigan Health System Internet website). The effects of a PDGFRβ and/or VEGF-A antagonist on tumor response can be evaluated in a murine cervical cancer model similar to that described in Ahn et al., \nHum. Gene Ther. \n14:1389-99, 2003; Hussain et al., \nOncology \n49:237-40, 1992; and Sengupta et al., \nOncology \n48:258-61, 1991.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nd. Head and Neck Tumors\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMost cancers of the head and neck are of a type called carcinoma (in particular squamous cell carcinoma). Carcinomas of the head and neck start in the cells that form the lining of the mouth, nose, throat or ear, or the surface layer covering the tongue. However, cancers of the head and neck can develop from other types of cells. Lymphoma develops from the cells of the lymphatic system. Sarcoma develops from the supportive cells which make up muscles, cartilage or blood vessels. Melanoma starts from cells called melanocytes, which give colour to the eyes and skin. The symptoms of a head and neck cancer will depend on where it is—for example, cancer of the tongue may cause some slurring of speech. The most common symptoms are an ulcer or sore area in the head or neck that does not heal within a few weeks; difficulty in swallowing, or pain when chewing or swallowing; trouble with breathing or speaking, such as persistent noisy breathing, slurred speech or a hoarse voice; a numb feeling in the mouth; a persistent blocked nose, or nose bleeds; persistent earache, ringing in the ear, or difficulty in hearing; a swelling or lump in the mouth or neck; pain in the face or upper jaw; in people who smoke or chew tobacco, pre-cancerous changes can occur in the lining of the mouth, or on the tongue. These can appear as persistent white patches (leukoplakia) or red patches (erythroplakia). They are usually painless but can sometimes be sore and may bleed (Cancerbacup Internet website). The effects of a PDGFRβ and/or VEGF-A antagonist on tumor response can be evaluated in a murine head and neck tumor model similar to that described in Kuriakose et al., \nHead Neck \n22:57-63, 2000; Cao et al., \nClin. Cancer Res. \n5:1925-34, 1999; Hier et al., \nLaryngoscope \n105:1077-80, 1995; Braakhuis et al., \nCancer Res. \n51:211-4, 1991; Baker, \nLaryngoscope \n95:43-56, 1985; and Dong et al., \nCancer Gene Ther. \n10:96-104, 2003.\n\n\n \n \n \n \ne. Brain Cancer\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTumors that begin in brain tissue are known as primary tumors of the brain. Primary brain tumors are named according to the type of cells or the part of the brain in which they begin. The most common primary brain tumors are gliomas. They begin in glial cells. There are many types of gliomas. (1) Astrocytoma—The tumor arises from star-shaped glial cells called astrocytes. In adults, astrocytomas most often arise in the cerebrum. In children, they occur in the brain stem, the cerebrum, and the cerebellum. A grade III astrocytoma is sometimes called an anaplastic astrocytoma. A grade IV astrocytoma is usually called a glioblastoma multiforme. (2) Brain stem glioma—The tumor occurs in the lowest part of the brain. Brain stem gliomas most often are diagnosed in young children and middle-aged adults. (3) Ependymoma—The tumor arises from cells that line the ventricles or the central canal of the spinal cord. They are most commonly found in children and young adults. (4) Oligodendroglioma—This rare tumor arises from cells that make the fatty substance that covers and protects nerves. These tumors usually occur in the cerebrum. They grow slowly and usually do not spread into surrounding brain tissue. They are most common in middle-aged adults. The symptoms of brain tumors depend on tumor size, type, and location. Symptoms may be caused when a tumor presses on a nerve or damages a certain area of the brain. They also may be caused when the brain swells or fluid builds up within the skull. These are the most common symptoms of brain tumors: Headaches (usually worse in the morning); Nausea or vomiting; Changes in speech, vision, or hearing; Problems balancing or walking; Changes in mood, personality, or ability to concentrate; Problems with memory; Muscle jerking or twitching (seizures or convulsions); and Numbness or tingling in the arms or legs (National Cancer Institute's Internet website). The effects of a PDGFRβ and/or VEGF-A antagonist on tumor response can be evaluated in a glioma animal model similar to that described in Schueneman et al., \nCancer Res. \n63:4009-16, 2003; Martinet et al., \nEur. J. Surg. Oncol. \n29:351-7, 2003; Bello et al., \nClin. Cancer Res. \n8:3539-48, 2002; Ishikawa et al., \nCancer Sci. \n95:98-103, 2004; Degen et al., \nJ. Neurosurg. \n99:893-8, 2003; Engelhard et al., \nNeurosurgery \n48:616-24, 2001; Watanabe et al., \nNeurol. Res. \n24:485-90, 2002; and Lumniczky et al., \nCancer Gene Ther. \n9:44-52, 2002.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nf. Thyroid Cancer\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPapillary and follicular thyroid cancers account for 80 to 90 percent of all thyroid cancers. Both types begin in the follicular cells of the thyroid. Most papillary and follicular thyroid cancers tend to grow slowly. If they are detected early, most can be treated successfully. Medullary thyroid cancer accounts for 5 to 10 percent of thyroid cancer cases. It arises in C cells, not follicular cells. Medullary thyroid cancer is easier to control if it is found and treated before it spreads to other parts of the body. Anaplastic thyroid cancer is the least common type of thyroid cancer (only 1 to 2 percent of cases). It arises in the follicular cells. The cancer cells are highly abnormal and difficult to recognize. This type of cancer is usually very hard to control because the cancer cells tend to grow and spread very quickly. Early thyroid cancer often does not cause symptoms. But as the cancer grows, symptoms may include: A lump, or nodule, in the front of the neck near the Adam's apple; Hoarseness or difficulty speaking in a normal voice; Swollen lymph nodes, especially in the neck; Difficulty swallowing or breathing; or Pain in the throat or neck (National Cancer Institute's Internet website). The effects of a PDGFRβ and/or VEGF-A antagonist on tumor response can be evaluated in a murine or rat thyroid tumor model similar to that described in Quidville et al., \nEndocrinology \n145:2561-71, 2004 (mouse model); Cranston et al., \nCancer Res. \n63:4777-80, 2003 (mouse model); Zhang et al., \nClin Endocrinol \n(\nOxf\n). 52:687-94, 2000 (rat model); and Zhang et al., \nEndocrinology \n140:2152-8, 1999 (rat model).\n\n\n \n \n \n \ng. Liver Cancer\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are two different types of primary liver cancer. The most common kind is called hepatoma or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and arises from the main cells of the liver (the hepatocytes). This type is usually confined to the liver, although occasionally it spreads to other organs. It occurs mostly in people with a liver disease called cirrhosis. There is also a rarer sub-type of hepatoma called Fibrolamellar hepatoma, which may occur in younger people and is not related to previous liver disease. The other type of primary liver cancer is called cholangiocarcinoma or bile duct cancer, because it starts in the cells lining the bile ducts. Most people who develop hepatoma usually also have a condition called cirrhosis of the liver. This is a fine scarring throughout the liver which is due to a variety of causes including infection and heavy alcohol drinking over a long period of time. However, only a small proportion of people who have cirrhosis of the liver develop primary liver cancer. Infection with either the hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus can lead to liver cancer, and can also be the cause of cirrhosis, which increases the risk of developing hepatoma. People who have a rare condition called haemochromatosis, which causes excess deposits of iron in the body, have a higher chance of developing hepatoma. Thus, the PDGFRβ and/or VEGF-A antagonists of the present invention may be used to treat, prevent, inhibit the progression of, delay the onset of, and/or reduce the severity or inhibit at least one of the conditions or symptoms associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. The hepatocellular carcinoma may or may not be associated with an hepatitis (e.g., hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and hepatitis D) infection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effects of a PDGFRβ and/or VEGF-A antagonist on tumor response can be evaluated in a hepatocellular carcinoma transgenic mouse model, which includes the overexpression of transforming growth factor-α (TFG-α) alone (Jhappan et al., \nCell, \n61:1137-1146, 1990; Sandgren et al., \nMol. Cell. Biol., \n13:320-330, 1993; Sandgren et al., \nOncogene \n4:715-724, 1989; and Lee et al., \nCancer Res. \n52:5162:5170, 1992) or in combination with c-myc (Murakami et al., \nCancer Res., \n53:1719-1723, 1993), mutated H-ras (Saitoh et al., \nOncogene \n5:1195-2000, 1990), hepatitis B viral genes encoding HbsAg and HBx (Toshkov et al., \nHepatology \n20:1162-1172, 1994; Koike et al., \nHepatology \n19:810-819, 1994), SV40 large T antigen (Sepulveda et al., \nCancer Res. \n49:6108-6117, 1989; Schirmacher et al., \nAm. J. Pathol., \n139:231-241, 1991) and FGF 19 (Nicholes et al., \nAmerican Journal of Pathology, \n160:2295-2307, 2002).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nh. Lung Cancer\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effects of a PDGFRβ and/or VEGF-A antagonist on tumor response can be evaluated in a human small/non-small cell lung carcinoma xenograft model. Briefly, human tumors are grafted into immunodeficient mice and these mice are treated with a PDGFRβ and/or VEGF-A antagonist alone or in combination with other agents which can be used to demonstrate the efficacy of the treatment by evaluating tumor growth (Nemati et al., \nClin Cancer Res. \n6:2075-86, 2000; and Hu et al., \nClin. Cancer Res. \n10:7662-70, 2004).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n2. Endpoints and Anti-tumor Activity for Solid Tumors\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile each protocol may define tumor response assessments differently, the RECIST (Response evaluation Criteria in solid tumors) criteria is currently considered to be the recommended guidelines for assessment of tumor response by the National Cancer Institute (see Therasse et al., \nJ. Natl. Cancer Inst. \n92:205-216, 2000). According to the RECIST criteria tumor response means a reduction or elimination of all measurable lesions or metastases. Disease is generally considered measurable if it comprises lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension as >20 mm with conventional techniques or ≧10 mm with spiral CT scan with clearly defined margins by medical photograph or X-ray, computerized axial tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or clinical examination (if lesions are superficial). Non-measurable disease means the disease comprises of lesions<20 mm with conventional techniques or <10 mm with spiral CT scan, and truly non-measurable lesions (too small to accurately measure). Non-measureable disease includes pleural effusions, ascites, and disease documented by indirect evidence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe criteria for objective status are required for protocols to assess solid tumor response. Representative criteria include the following: (1) Complete Response (CR), defined as complete disappearance of all measurable disease; no new lesions; no disease related symptoms; no evidence of non-measurable disease; (2) Partial Response (PR) defined as 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions (3) Progressive Disease (PD), defined as 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions or appearance of any new lesion; (4) Stable or No Response, defined as not qualifying for CR, PR, or Progressive Disease. (See Therasse et al., supra.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional endpoints that are accepted within the oncology art include overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), objective response rate (ORR), time to progression (TTP), and progression-free survival (PFS) (see \nGuidance for Industry: Clinical Trial Endpoints for the Approval of Cancer Drugs and Biologics\n, April 2005, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, FDA, Rockville, Md.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \n3. Combination Cancer Therapy\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs previously discussed, in certain embodiments, a PDGFRβ and/or VEGF-A antagonist is used in combination with a second agent for treatment of a neovascular disorder. When used for treating cancer, antagonists of the present invention may be used in combination with conventional cancer therapies such as, e.g., surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or combinations thereof. In certain aspects, other therapeutic agents useful for combination cancer therapy with a PDGFRβ and/or VEGF-A antagonist include other anti-angiogenic agents. In some other aspects, other therapeutic agents useful for combination therapy with a PDGFRβ and/or VEGF-A antagonist include an antagonist of other factors that are involved in tumor growth such as, for example, EGFR, ErbB2 (Her2), ErbB3, ErbB4, or TNF. In some aspects, a PDGFRβ and/or VEGF-A antagonist is co-administered with a cytokine (e.g., a cytokine that stimulates an immune response against a tumor). Exemplary combination therapies particularly amenable for treatment of cancer are described in further detail below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \na. Antibodies Targeting Tumor-Associated Antigens in Combination with PDGFRβ and/or VEGF-A Antagonist\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody therapy has been particularly successful in cancer treatment because certain tumors either display unique antigens, lineage-specific antigens, or antigens present in excess amounts relative to normal cells. One of the mechanisms associated with the anti-tumor activity of monoclonal antibody therapy is antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In ADCC, monoclonal antibodies bind to a target cell (e.g., cancer cell) and specific effector cells expressing receptors for the monoclonal antibody (e.g., NK cells, monocytes, granulocytes) bind the monoclonal antibody/target cell complex resulting in target cell death. In certain variations of the present invention, a PDGFRβ and/or VEGF-A antagonist is co-administered with a monoclonal antibody against a tumor-associated antigen. The dose and schedule of the MAbs is based on pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic properties ascribed to the specific antibody co-administered, and should optimize these effects, while minimizing any toxicity that may be associated with administration of a PDGFRβ and/or VEGF-A antagonist.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCombination therapy with a PDGFRβ and/or VEGF-A antagonist and a monoclonal antibody against a tumor-associated antigen may be indicated when a first line treatment has failed and may be considered as a second line treatment. The present invention also provides using the combination as a first line treatment in patient populations that are newly diagnosed and have not been previously treated with anticancer agents (“de novo patients”) and patients that have not previously received any monoclonal antibody therapy (“naïve patients”).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA PDGFRβ and/or VEGF-A antagonist is also useful in combination therapy with monoclonal antibodies against tumor-associated antigens in the absence of any direct antibody-mediated ADCC of tumor cells. For example, antibodies that block an inhibitory signal in the immune system can lead to augmented immune responses. Examples include (1) antibodies against molecules of the B7R family that have inhibitory function such as, cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), programmed death-1 (PD-1), B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA); (2) antibodies against inhibitory cytokines like IL-10, TGFβ; and (3) antibodies that deplete or inhibit functions of suppressive cells like anti-CD25 or CTLA-4. For example, anti-CTLA4 MAbs in both mice and humans are thought to either suppress function of immune-suppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs) or inhibit the inhibitory signal transmitted through binding of CTLA-4 on T cells to B7-1 or B7-2 molecules on APCs or tumor cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTable 8 is a non-exclusive list of monoclonal antibodies approved or being tested for which combination therapy with a PDGFRβ and/or VEGF-A antagonist is possible.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonoclonal Antibody Therapies for Use in Combination with PDGFRβ and/or VEGF-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Antagonists\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTarget\n\n\nDrug Name\n\n\nClinical Indication\n\n\nCompany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRAIL-R1\n\n\nHGS-ETR1\n\n\ncancers\n\n\nHGS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRAIL-R2\n\n\nHGS-ETR2\n\n\nsolid tumors\n\n\nHGS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCD40\n\n\nSGN40\n\n\nMM\n\n\nSeattle Genetics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHER2\n\n\nHerceptin\n\n\nBreast cancer\n\n\nGenentech\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEGF-R\n\n\nABX-EGF\n\n\nCRC, NSCLC, RCC\n\n\nAbgenix\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEGF-R\n\n\nEMD72000\n\n\nsolid tumors\n\n\nMerck\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEGF-R\n\n\nMDX-214\n\n\nEGF-R-positive tumors\n\n\nMedarex\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEGF-R\n\n\nErbitux\n\n\nCRC\n\n\nImclone\n\n\n\n\n\n\nα5β3 integrin\n\n\nVitaxin\n\n\npsoriasis, prostate cancer\n\n\nAME/Lilly\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCD152\n\n\nCTLA-4\n\n\ncancers\n\n\nMedarex\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCD49e\n\n\nIntegrin α5\n\n\ncancers\n\n\nProtein Design Labs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMUC18 (TIM-like)\n\n\nABX-MA1\n\n\nmelanoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTAG-72 Mucin\n\n\nAnatumomab\n\n\ncancers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCD3\n\n\nEcromeximab\n\n\nmelanoma\n\n\nKyowa Hakko\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCD64 (Fc GR1)\n\n\nAntiCD64\n\n\ncancers\n\n\nMedarex\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCEA\n\n\nCEA-Cide\n\n\ncancers\n\n\nImmunomedics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpCAM\n\n\nPanorex\n\n\ncolorectal cancer\n\n\nCentocor\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLewis-Y-Ag\n\n\nSGN15\n\n\ncancers\n\n\nSeattle Genetics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nb. Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors in Combination with PDGFRβ and/or VEGF-A Antagonist\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a PDGFRβ and/or VEGF-A antagonist as described herein is used in combination with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Tyrosine kinases are enzymes that catalyze the transfer of the γ phosphate group from the adenosine triphosphate to target proteins. Tyrosine kinases can be classified as receptor and nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases. They play an essential role in diverse normal cellular processes, including activation through growth receptors and affect proliferation, survival and growth of various cell types. Additionally, they are thought to promote tumor cell proliferation, induce anti-apoptotic effects and promote angiogenesis and metastasis. In addition to activation through growth factors, protein kinase activation through somatic mutation is a common mechanism of tumorigenesis. Some of the mutations identified are in B-Raf kinase, FLt3 kinase, BCR-ABL kinase, c-KIT kinase, epidermal growth factor (EGFR) and PDGFR pathways. The Her2, VEGFR and c-Met are other significant receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) pathways implicated in cancer progression and tumorigenesis. Because a large number of cellular processes are initiated by tyrosine kinases, they have been identified as key targets for inhibitors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are small molecules that act inside the cell, competing with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for binding to the catalytic tyrosine kinase domain of both receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases. This competitive binding blocks initiation of downstream signaling leading to effector functions associated with these signaling events like growth, survival, and angiogenesis. Using a structure and computational approach, a number of compounds from numerous medical chemistry combinatorial libraries was identified that inhibit tyrosine kinases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMost TKIs are thought to inhibit growth of tumors through direct inhibition of the tumor cell or through inhibition of angiogenesis. Moreover, certain TKIs affect signaling through the VEGF family receptors, including sorafenib and sunitinib. In some cases TKIs have been shown to activate functions of dendritic cells and other innate immune cells, like NK cells. This has been recently reported in animal models for imatinib. Imatinib is a TKI that has shown to enhance killer activity by dendritic cells and NK cells (for review, see Smyth et al., \nNEJM \n354:2282, 2006).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBAY 43-9006 (sorafenib, Nexavar®) and SU11248 (sunitinib, Sutent®) are two such TKIs that have been recently approved for use in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). A number of other TKIs are in late and early stage development for treatment of various types of cancer. Other TKIs include, but are not limited to: Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec®, Novartis); Gefitinib (Iressa®, AstraZeneca); Erlotinib hydrochloride (Tarceva®, Genentech); Vandetanib (Zactima®, AstraZeneca), Tipifarnib (Zarnestra®, Janssen-Cilag); Dasatinib (Sprycel®, Bristol Myers Squibb); Lonafarnib (Sarasar®, Schering Plough); Vatalanib succinate (Novartis, Schering AG); Lapatinib (Tykerb®, GlaxoSmithKline); Nilotinib (Novartis); Lestaurtinib (Cephalon); Pazopanib hydrochloride (GlaxoSmithKline); Axitinib (Pfizer); Canertinib dihydrochloride (Pfizer); Pelitinib (National Cancer Institute, Wyeth); Tandutinib (Millennium); Bosutinib (Wyeth); Semaxanib (Sugen, Taiho); AZD-2171 (AstraZeneca); VX-680 (Merck, Vertex); EXEL-0999 (Exelixis); ARRY-142886 (Array BioPharma, AstraZeneca); PD-0325901 (Pfizer); AMG-706 (Amgen); BIBF-1120 (Boehringer Ingelheim); SU-6668 (Taiho); CP-547632 (OSI); (AEE-788 (Novartis); BMS-582664 (Bristol-Myers Squibb); JNK-401 (Celgene); R-788 (Rigel); AZD-1152 HQPA (AstraZeneca); NM-3 (Genzyme Oncology); CP-868596 (Pfizer); BMS-599626 (Bristol-Myers Squibb); PTC-299 (PTC Therapeutics); ABT-869 (Abbott); EXEL-2880 (Exelixis); AG-024322 (Pfizer); XL-820 (Exelixis); OSI-930 (OSI); XL-184 (Exelixis); KRN-951 (Kirin Brewery); CP-724714 (OSI); E-7080 (Eisai); HKI-272 (Wyeth); CHIR-258 (Chiron); ZK-304709 (Schering AG); EXEL-7647 (Exelixis); BAY-57-9352 (Bayer); BIBW-2992 (Boehringer Ingelheim); AV-412 (AVEO); YN-968D1 (Advenchen Laboratories); Midostaurin (Novartis); Perifosine (AEterna Zentaris, Keryx, National Cancer Institute); AG-024322 (Pfizer); AZD-1152 (AstraZeneca); ON-01910Na (Onconova); and AZD-0530 (AstraZeneca).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nc. Chemotherapy Combinations\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, a PDGFRβ and/or VEGF-A antagonist is administered in combination with one or more chemotherapeutic agents. Chemotherapeutic agents have different modes of actions, for example, by influencing either DNA or RNA and interfering with cell cycle replication. Examples of chemotherapeutic agents that act at the DNA level or on the RNA level are anti-metabolites (such as Azathioprine, Cytarabine, Fludarabine phosphate, Fludarabine, Gemcitabine, cytarabine, Cladribine, capecitabine 6-mercaptopurine, 6-thioguanine, methotrexate, 5-fluoroouracil and hyroxyurea); alkylating agents (such as Melphalan, Busulfan, Cis-platin, Carboplatin, Cyclophosphamide, Ifosphamide, Dacarabazine, Procarbazine, Chlorambucil, Thiotepa, Lomustine, Temozolamide); anti-mitotic agents (such as Vinorelbine, Vincristine, Vinblastine, Docetaxel, Paclitaxel); topoisomerase inhibitors (such as Doxorubincin, Amsacrine, Irinotecan, Daunorubicin, Epirubicin, Mitomycin, Mitoxantrone, Idarubicin, Teniposide, Etoposide, Topotecan); antibiotics (such as actinomycin and bleomycin); asparaginase; anthracyclines or taxanes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nd. Radiotherapy Combinations\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some variations, a PDGFRβ and/or VEGF-A antagonist is administered in combination with radiotherapy. Certain tumors can be treated with radiation or radiopharmaceuticals. Radiation therapy is generally used to treat unresectable or inoperable tumors and/or tumor metastases. Radiotherapy is typically delivered in three ways. External beam irradiation is administered at distance from the body and includes gamma rays (\n60\nCo) and X-rays. Brachytherapy uses sources, for example \n60\nCo, \n137\nCs, \n192\nIr, or \n125\nI, with or in contact with a target tissue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \ne. Hormonal Agent Combinations\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a PDGFRβ and/or VEGF-A antagonist is administered in combination with a hormone or anti-hormone. Certain cancers are associated with hormonal dependency and include, for example, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer. Hormonal-dependent cancer treatment may comprise use of anti-androgen or anti-estrogen compounds. Hormones and anti-hormones used in cancer therapy include Estramustine phosphate, Polyestradiol phosphate, Estradiol, Anastrozole, Exemestane, Letrozole, Tamoxifen, Megestrol acetate, Medroxyprogesterone acetate, Octreotide, Cyproterone acetate, Bicaltumide, Flutamide, Tritorelin, Leuprorelin, Buserelin and Goserelin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nC. Neovascular Ocular Disorders\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral ocular disorders involve alterations in angiogenesis and are amenable to treatment in accordance with the present invention. Such neovascular ocular disorders include, for example, age-related macular degeneration (e.g., “wet” age-related macular degeneration), diabetic retinopathy, iris neovascularization, neovascular glaucoma, proliferative vitroretinopathy, optic disc neovascularization, corneal neovascularization, vitreal neovascularization, pannus, pterygium, macular edema, diabetic macular edema, vascular retinopathy, retinal degeneration, uveitis, and inflammatory diseases of the retina.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, diabetic retinopathy, the third leading cause of adult blindness (accounting for almost 7% of blindness in the USA), is associated with extensive angiogenic events. Nonproliferative retinopathy is accompanied by the selective loss of pericytes within the retina, and their loss results in dilation of associated capillaries dilation and a resulting increase in blood flow. In the dilated capillaries, endothelial cells proliferate and form outpouchings, which become microaneurysms, and the adjacent capillaries become blocked so that the area of retina surrounding these microaneurysms is not perfused. Eventually, shunt vessels appear between adjacent areas of micro aneurysms, and the clinical picture of early diabetic retinopathy with micro aneurysms and areas of nonperfused retina is seen. The microaneurysms leak and capillary vessels may bleed, causing exudates and hemorrhages. Once the initial stages of background diabetic retinopathy are established, the condition progresses over a period of years, developing into proliferative diabetic retinopathy and blindness in about 5% of cases. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy occurs when some areas of the retina continue losing their capillary vessels and become nonperfused, leading to the appearance of new vessels on the disk and elsewhere on the retina. These new blood vessels grow into the vitreous and bleed easily, leading to preretinal hemorrhages. In advanced proliferative diabetic retinopathy, a massive vitreous hemorrhage may fill a major portion of the vitreous cavity. In addition, the new vessels are accompanied by fibrous tissue proliferation that can lead to traction retinal detachment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiabetic retinopathy is associated primarily with the duration of diabetes mellitus; therefore, as the population ages and diabetic patients live longer, the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy will increase. Laser therapy is currently used in both nonproliferative and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Focal laser treatment of the leaking microaneurysms surrounding the macular area reduces visual loss in 50% of patients with clinically significant macular edema. In proliferative diabetic retinopathy, panretinal photocoagulation results in several thousand tiny burns scattered throughout the retina (sparing the macular area); this treatment reduces the rate of blindness by 60 percent. Early treatment of macular edema and proliferative diabetic retinopathy prevents blindness for 5 years in 95% of patients, whereas late treatment prevents blindness in only 50 percent. Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment are essential.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother ocular disorder involving neovascularization is age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a disease that affects approximately one in ten Americans over the age of 65. AMD is characterized by a series of pathologic changes in the macula, the central region of the retina, which is accompanied by decreased visual acuity, particularly affecting central vision. AMD involves the single layer of cells called the retinal pigment epithelium that lies immediately beneath the sensory retina. These cells nourish and support the portion of the retina in contact withthem, i.e., the photoreceptor cells that contain the visual pigments. The retinal pigment epithelium lies on the Bruch membrane, a basement membrane complex which, in AMD, thickens and becomes sclerotic. New blood vessels may break through the Bruch membrane from the underlying choroid, which contains a rich vascular bed. These vessels may in turn leak fluid or bleed beneath the retinal pigment epithelium and also between the retinal pigment epithelium and the sensory retina. Subsequent fibrous scarring disrupts the nourishment of the photoreceptor cells and leads to their death, resulting in a loss of central visual acuity. This type of age-related maculopathy is called the “wet” type because of the leaking vessels and the subretinal edema or blood. The wet type accounts for only 10% of age-related maculopathy cases but results in 90% of cases of legal blindness from macular degeneration in the elderly. The “dry” type of age-related maculopathy involves disintegration of the retinal pigment epithelium along with loss of the overlying photoreceptor cells. The dry type reduces vision but usually only to levels of 20/50 to 20/100.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAMD is accompanied by distortion of central vision with objects appearing larger or smaller or straight lines appearing distorted, bent, or without a central segment. In the wet type of AMD, a small detachment of the sensory retina may be noted in the macular area, but the definitive diagnosis of a subretinal neovascular membrane requires fluorescein angiography. In the dry type, drusen may disturb the pigmentation pattern in the macular area. Drusen are excrescences of the basement membrane of the retinal pigment epithelium that protrude into the cells, causing them to bulge anteriorly; their role as a risk factor in age-related maculopathy is unclear. No treatment currently exists for the dry type of age-related maculopathy. Conventional treatments for the wet type of age-related maculopathy include laser treatment, which initially obliterates the neovascular membrane and prevents further visual loss in about 50% of patients at 18 months. By 60 months, however, only 20% still have a substantial benefit.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor pharmaceutical use in treating a neovascular ocular disorder, a PDGFRβ and/or VEGF-A antagonist are typically formulated for intravitreal injection according to conventional methods. In general, pharmaceutical formulations will include the antagonist(s) in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle, such as saline, buffered saline, 5% dextrose in water, or the like. In certain variations for ophthalmic uses, a PDGFRβ and/or VEGF-A antagonist is formulated in a phosphate buffered saline at pH 5-7.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuppression of a neovascular ocular disorder is evaluated by any accepted method of measuring whether angiogenesis is slowed or diminished. This includes direct observation and indirect evaluation such as by evaluating subjective symptoms or objective physiological indicators.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTreatment efficacy, for example, may be evaluated based on the prevention or reversal of neovascularization, microangiopathy, vascular leakage or vascular edema, or any combination thereof. Treatment efficacy for evaluating suppression of an ocular neovascular disorder may also be defined in terms of stabilizing or improving visual acuity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn determining the effectiveness of a particular therapy in treating or preventing an neovascular ocular disorder, patients may also be clinically evaluated by an ophthalmologist several days after injection and at least one-month later just prior to the next injection. ETDRS visual acuities, kodachrome photography, and fluorescein angiography are also performed monthly for the first 4 months as required by the ophthalmologist.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, in order to assess the effectiveness of PDGFRβ antagonist and/or VEGF-A antagonist therapy to treat ocular neovascularization, studies may be conducted involving the administration of either single or multiple intravitreal injections of a PDGFRβ antagonist and/or VEGF-A antagonist in patients suffering from subfoveal choroidal neovascularization secondary to age-related macular degeneration according to standard methods well known in the ophthalmologic arts. In one exemplary study, patients with subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV) secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) receive a single intravitreal injection of a PDGFRβ and/or VEGF-A antagonist. Effectiveness of the treatment is monitored, for example, by ophthalmic evaluation. Patients showing stable or improved vision three months after treatment, for example, demonstrating a 3-line or greater improvement in vision on the ETDRS chart, are taken as receiving an effective dosage of the PDGFRβ antagonist and/or VEGF-A antagonist that suppresses an ocular neovascular disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention is further illustrated by the following non-limiting examples.\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\nPanning for Antibodies that Bind VEGF-A\n\n\n \n \n \nAntibodies that bind to VEGF-A were identified by screening the Dyax Fab 310 phage library (Dyax Corp., Cambridge, Mass.). The chosen method for selection and screening of the phage-antibody libraries utilized polystyrene immunotubes (NUNC, Denmark) coated with antigen (VEGF-A\n165\n, R&D Systems). The antibodies were isolated by increasing the stringency after a few rounds of selection. The first generation of antibodies was in the Fab format. The soluble Fab antibodies were generated by MluI (#R0198S, New England Biolabs, Beverly, Mass.) enzyme digestion to remove the geneIII stump from M13 phage. The same strategy of selection, screening, and solubilizing was applied for antibodies in the scFv format.\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\nIdentification of VEGF-A-Binding Fab Clones\n\n\n \n \n \nFab clones binding VEGF-A were identified by a plate based binding assay. Costar (#9018) 96-well plates were coated with 50 μl VEGF-A (R&D Systems) or PDGF-D (SEQ ID NO:481) homodimer at 0.6 μg/ml in 0.1M NaHCO\n3\n, pH 9.6 overnight at 4° C. The next day, plates were washed three times with 0.1% Tween-20/PBS (PBST). Each well was filled with 100 μl of 2% milk (#170-6404, Bio-Rad)/PBST for one hour at RT for blocking. Assay plates were then washed three times with PBST. Each well was filled with 25 ul of 2% milk/PBST, followed by the addition of 25 ul of Fab supernatant. Wells were then mixed and incubated for one hour at RT. Plates were washed three times with PBST. For Fab detection, 50 ul of (1:4000) anti-Human Fab specific pAb-HRP (#31482, Pierce) in 2% milk/PBST was added to each well for one hour at RT. Plates were then washed three times with PBST. 50 ul of TMB (TMBW-1000-01, BioFX Laboratories) was added to each well to develop for 15 min, followed by the addition of 50 ul of stop buffer (STPR-1000-01, BioFX Laboratories) to quench the reaction. Plates were then read at 450 nm on a plate reader.\n\n\n \nExample 3\n\n\nConversion of VEGF-A-Binding sFab into scFv\n\n\n \n \n \nLambda, kappa, and heavy chain variable regions were amplified from a pool of round 2, Arm A and Arm B VEGF-A-panned Fab Dyax phage DNA in a 3 step process using primers directed against framework sequences for each subtype. The first round PCR amplifies each of the variable framework regions and adds appropriate overhangs to facilitate round 2 PCR reactions. Round 2 PCR reactions add appropriate gly/ser linker sequences to the ends of the proper round 1 PCR products and round 3 PCR reactions overlap the variable light chain lambda, variable light chain kappa, and variable heavy chain products to create scFv products in both LH and HL orientations, which were then cloned into ApaLI/NotI-digested PIMD21 phage display vector.\n\n\n \nExample 4\n\n\nIdentification sFabs and scFvs that Inhibit VEGF Binding to sVEGFR2\n\n\n \n \n \nVEGF-A Fab and scFv clones were screened by a plate-based neutralization assay. Costar (#9018) 96-well plates were coated with 100 μl of anti-human IgG Fcγ-specific antibody (#109-005-098, Jackson Immunology) at 1 μg/ml in 0.1M NaHCO\n3\n, pH 9.6 overnight at 4° C. The next day, plates were washed three times with 400 ul 0.1% Tween-20/PBS (PBST). Each well was filled with 100 μl of 1% BSA (#A3059-100G, SIGMA)/PBST for one hour at room temperature (RT) for blocking. Plates were washed three times with PBST. 100 μl of VEGFR2-Fc (SEQ ID NO:482) at 0.2 μg/ml in 1% BSA/PBST was added to each well for one hour at room temperature. Concurrently, in a separate 96 well plate (Costar 3357), 65 μl of Fab or scFv supernatant was added to 65 μl of biotinylated VEGF-A in 1% BSA/PBST at 20 ng/ml for 1 hr at room temperature. Blocked assay plates were washed three times with PBST. Each well was filled with 100 μl of supernatant/biotinylated VEGF-A complex for 1 hr at room temperature. Plates were washed three times with PBST. 100 μl of (1:4000) Streptavidin-HRP (#21124, Pierce) in 1% BSA/PBST was added to each well for one hour at room temperature. Plates were then washed three times with PBST. 100 μl of TMB (TMBW-1000-01, BioFX Laboratories) was added to each well to develop for 20 minutes, followed by the addition of 100 μl of stop buffer (STPR-1000-01, BioFX Laboratories) to quench the reaction. Plates were then read at 450 nm on a plate reader.\n\n\n \nExample 5\n\n\nMeasurement of Binding Affinities of Human VEGF Receptor-2 to the Human VEGF-A Via Surface Plasmon Resonance (Biacore)\n\n\nAffinity Determination\n\n\n \n \n \nKinetic rate constants and equilibrium dissociation constants were measured for the interaction of VEGF Receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) with the VEGF-A via surface plasmon resonance. Surface plasmon resonance allows monitoring of both association and dissociation phases during biomolecular interactions (Ohlson, J Mol Recognit, 1997). The association rate constant (k\na \n(M\n−1\ns\n−1\n)) is a value that reflects the rate of the antigen-antagonist complex formation. The dissociation rate constant (k\nd \n(s\n−1\n)) is a value that reflects the stability of this complex. By dividing the association rate constant by the dissociation rate constant (k\na\n/k\nd\n) the equilibrium association constant (K\nA \n(M\n−1\n)) is obtained. By dividing the dissociation rate constant by the association rate constant (k\nd\n/k\na\n) the equilibrium dissociation constant (K\nD \n(M)) is obtained. This value describes the binding affinity of the interaction. Interactions with the same K\nD \ncan have widely variable association and dissociation rate constants. Consequently, measuring both the k\na \nand k\nd \nhelps to more accurately describe the affinity of the interaction.\n\n\n \nMaterials and Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nA series of experiments were completed to measure the binding affinity of VEGFR-2 interaction with VEGF-A. Binding kinetics and affinity measurements were obtained using surface plasmon resonance assays using a Biacore T100™ system (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, N.J.). Methods, were programmed using Biacore T100™ Control Software, v 1.1.1. Human VEGF-A (R&D Systems) was covalently immobilized onto the CM5 sensor chip using amine coupling chemistry (EDC:NHS) to a density of approximately 200 RU. After the immobilization, remaining active sites on the flow cell were blocked with ethanolamine. Non-specific bound protein was removed by washing with 50 mM NaOH. A reference flow cell was activated and then blocked with ethanolamine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSerial 1:2 dilutions of human VEGFR-2-Fc5 ranging from 200 nM to 3.13 nM were injected over the surface and allowed to specifically bind to the VEGF-A immobilized on the sensor chip. Injections of the VEGFR-2-Fc5 concentrations were performed with an association time of 10 minutes and dissociation time of 15 minutes. Kinetic binding studies were performed with a flow rate of 30 μl/min. All binding experiments were performed at 25° C. in a buffer of 10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA 0.05% Surfactant P20, pH 7.4. Buffer injections were also performed to allow for subtraction of instrument noise and drift. Between cycles, the flow cell was washed with 10 mM Glycine, pH 1.5 to regenerate the surface. Baseline stability was assessed to ensure that the regeneration step provided a consistent binding surface throughout the sequence of injections.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nData was compiled using Biacore T100™ Evaluation software (version 1.1.1). Data was processed by subtracting reference flow cell and blank injections and baseline stability was assessed to ensure that the regeneration step provided a consistent binding surface throughout the sequence of injections. Duplicate injection curves were checked for reproducibility. Because VEGFR-2-Fc5 and VEGF-A are both dimeric molecules, the bivalent analyte model was determined to be the most appropriate and the resulting binding curves were globally fitted to this model.\n\n\n \nResults\n\n\n \n \n \nVEGFR-2 was characterized for its binding affinity for VEGF-A (results summarized in Table 9). Association rate constants (k\na \n(M\n−1\ns\n−1\n)) and dissociation rate constants (k\nd \n(s\n−1\n)) were measured. The data fit well to the bivalent interaction model. This model measures two values for both k\na \n(k\na1 \nand k\na2\n) and for k\nd \n(k\nd1 \nand k\nd2\n). The first set of values (k\na1 \nand k\nd1\n) describes the monovalent kinetics of the interaction which are reported in Table 9. The affinity reported for these samples was derived from these values, and is designated K\nD1\n. K\nD \nand K\nA \nwere calculated from the k\na \nand k\nd \nvalues. Under these assay conditions, equilibrium dissociation rate constant for VEGF-A/VEGFR-2 interaction was approximately 1.E\n−8\nM.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacterization of VEGF-A Binding Affinity for VEGFR-2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nk\na\n \n\n\nk\nd\n \n\n\nK\nD\n \n\n\nK\nA\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nInteraction\n\n\n(M\n−1\ns\n−1\n)\n\n\n(s\n−1\n)\n\n\n(M)\n\n\n(M\n−1\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nVEGF-A\n\n\n2.E+4\n\n\n2.E−4\n\n\n1.E−8\n\n\n1.E+8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nVEGFR-2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 6\n\n\nMeasurement of Dissociation Rate Constants of Interaction of Human VEGF-A Antagonists with Human VEGF-A via Surface Plasmon Resonance (Biacore)\n\n\n \n \n \nHuman VEGF-A antagonists were evaluated for their binding affinity to human VEGF-A according to their dissociation rate constants using surface plasmon resonance. Dissociation rate constants were measured for the interaction of VEGF-A antagonists with VEGF-A via surface plasmon resonance. The dissociation rate constant (k\nd\n(s\n−1\n)) is a value that reflects the stability of this complex. It is independent of the concentration and therefore suitable for screening and ranking samples with unknown concentrations.\n\n\n \nMaterials and Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nA series of experiments were completed to measure the binding affinity of VEGF-A antagonists to VEGF-A. Binding kinetics and affinity studies were performed on a Biacore T-100™ system (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, N.J.). Methods were programmed using Biacore T100™ Control Software, v 1.1.1. Human VEGF-A was covalently immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip using amine coupling chemistry (EDC:NHS) to a density of approximately 200 RU. VEGF-A was immobilized only to the active flow cell. After the immobilization procedure, remaining active sites on the flow cell were blocked with ethanolamine. Non-specifically bound protein was removed by washing with 50 mM NaOH. A reference cell was activated and then blocked with ethanolamine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe VEGF-A antagonist supernatants (selected from a Dyax phage library screening) were diluted 1:3 in running buffer, injected over the surface and allowed to specifically bind to VEGF-A on a sensor chip with an association time of 5 minutes and dissociation time of 5 minutes. Duplicate injections of 100 nM VEGFR-2-Fc5 and 100 nM anti-VEGF-A monoclonal antibody (Avastin™, Genentech) were used as positive controls. Kinetic binding studies were performed using a flow rate of 30 ul/min. All binding experiments were performed at 25° C. in running buffer of 10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA 0.05% Surfactant P20, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4. Buffer injections were also performed to allow for subtraction of instrument noise and drift.

Data was processed by subtracting reference flow cell and blank injections. Baseline stability was assessed to ensure that the regeneration step provided a consistent binding surface throughout the sequence of injections. Since the starting concentrations of the VEGF-A antagonists were unknown, resulting binding curves were globally fit to a 1:1 dissociation binding model to calculate the dissociation rate constants (k\nd \n(s\n−1\n)).\n\n\n \nResults\n\n\n \n \n \nDissociation rate analysis of VEGF-A antagonists to human VEGF-A was determined. Resulting binding curves fit well to a 1:1 dissociation model. The starting concentrations of the VEGF-A antagonists were unknown, therefore only dissociation rate constants (k\nd \n(s\n−1\n)) were reported since k\nd \nis independent of concentration. Calculated dissociation rate constants were ranked from slowest to fastest. Under these assay conditions, the VEGF-A antagonists display a large range of dissociation rate constants (1.E\n−5\n-2.E\n−2 \n(s\n−1\n)) for their interaction to VEGF-A (see Table 10). For comparison, the k\nd \nof VEGFR-2-Fc5-VEGF-A interaction was approximately 2.E\n−4 \ns\n−1 \nand anti-VEGF-A monoclonal antibody Avastin™ Fab-VEGF-A interaction was approximately 8.E\n−5 \ns\n−1\n.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDissociation Rate Constants of Interaction of\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVEGF-A Antagonists with VEGF-A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nscFvs and controls\n\n\nOff-rate [k\nd \n(s\n−1\n)]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAvastin ™\n\n\n1.E−04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLucentis ™\n\n\n2.E−05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAvastin ™ Fab\n\n\n8.E−05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nc636.1_1\n\n\n2.E−04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nc721.1_1\n\n\n2.E−04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nc721.1_2\n\n\n2.E−04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nc752.1_1\n\n\n5.E−04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nc831.1_1\n\n\n4.E−04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nc1036.1_1\n\n\n5.E−04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nc1044.1_1\n\n\n3.E−04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nc1090.1_1\n\n\n3.E−04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nc1094.1_1\n\n\n4.E−04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nc1155.1_1\n\n\n4.E−04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nc1080.1_1\n\n\n2.E−03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nc1135.1_1\n\n\n5.E−04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nc1270.1_1\n\n\n5.E−04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nc1285.1_1\n\n\n6.E−04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nc1257.1_1\n\n\n5.E−04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nc1410.1_1\n\n\n2.E−04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nc1476.1_1\n\n\n2.E−04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nc641.1_1\n\n\n7.E−04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nc648.1_1\n\n\n5.E−04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nc868.1_1\n\n\n6.E−04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nc870.1_1\n\n\n2.E−04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nc1039.1_1\n\n\n2.E−04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nc1092.1_1\n\n\n4.E−03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 7\n\n\nPurification of Proteins Derived from \nE. Coli \nPeriplasmic Fraction\n\n\n \n \n \nscFv, tandem scFv, and sFab proteins were expressed in the periplasmic space of \nE. coli \ncells. Scale of ferment ranged from 25 mL shake flask cultures to 2 L batch fed systems. \nE. coli \ncells were spun down using a centrifuge into a pellet. Wet cell pellet was completely re-suspended in periplasting buffer [0.2M Tris, 20% (w/v) sucrose, Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) pH 7.5] at a ratio of 2 mL per gram of wet cell weight. Lysozyme, an enzyme that facilitates the degradation of the cell wall may or may not be included in the procedure. To determine whether or not to use lysozyme, 500 uL of re-suspended pellet was transferred to an eppendorf tube and 30 U of Ready-Lyse lysozyme (Epicentre) per uL of periplasting buffer used was added and the suspension incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. After the incubation, the solution was checked for increased viscosity by inversion. If the solution clings to the wall of the tube, then premature cell lysis may be occurring, and the lysozyme is not included in the preparative solution. If the solution does not cling to the tube wall, then the lysozyme is included in the preparative solution. If using lysozyme, 30 U of Ready-Lyse lysozyme (Epicentre) per uL of periplasting buffer used was added and the suspension incubated at room temperature for 4-6 minutes. Ice cold water was added at a ratio of 3 mL per gram of original wet cell pellet weight and the solution incubated for at least 10 minutes but no longer than 30 minutes. The remaining spheroplasts were pelleted via centrifugation at 15,000×g (or 10,000-20,000 RPM, whichever is faster) for at least 15 minutes, but no longer than 45 minutes, at room temperature. The supernatant containing the periplasmic fraction was poured into a new vessel and adjusted to 25 mM Imidazole, 500 mM NaCl using weighed out solid. This solution was filtered through a 0.22 um filter prior to purification using a bottle top filter (Nalgene).\n\n\n \nImmobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC) Capture\n\n\n \n \n \nTraditionally, a 5 mL HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare) was used for the IMAC step, however, the column size can be scaled up or down depending on the amount of scFv target in the periplasmic fraction as determined by an analytical IMAC-SEC assay. Binding capacity of this IMAC resin has been shown to be at least 20 mg/mL of packed bed. If using columns larger than 10 mL in size, Waters Glass Columns (Millipore) with a 2 and 5 cm internal diameter were preferred. Using an appropriate chromatography station (Akta Explorer using UNICORN software 4.1 and higher [GE Healthcare] or BioCAD Sprint, 700E, or Vision using Perfusion Chromatography software version 3.00 or higher [Applied Biosystems]), the IMAC column was equilibrated in 50 mM NaPO\n4\n, 500 mM NaCl, 25 mM Imidazole pH 7.5 and the periplasmic fraction loaded over it at no faster than 190 cm/hr until depleted. Column was washed with equilibration buffer until monitors at UV A254 nm and UV A280 nm are baseline stable for at least 2 CV at a flow rate not to exceed 190 cm/hr. Bound protein was eluted competitively using 50 mM NaPO\n4\n, 500 mM NaCl, 400 mM Imidazole, pH 7.5 at no faster than 190 cm/hr. Elution fractions were assessed for protein content via UV @ A280 nm, analytical size exclusion chromatography, and SDS-PAGE.\n\n\n \nOther Chromatographic Techniques\n\n\n \n \n \nPurity of the IMAC pool was assessed by SDS-PAGE gel and analytical size exclusion chromatography (SEC). If the pool was not amenable to final clean up via SEC, other chromatographic techniques were employed to further purify the target scFv protein from residual host cell contaminants and aggregates. These conventional techniques included anion exchange, cation exchange, and hydrophobic interaction. Other affinity based approaches were also used, including, but not limited to: utilization of the c-terminal myc tag via anti-myc resin or ligand based affinity approaches using the appropriate ligand covalently coupled to a rigid bead. The utility of these other techniques were determined on a protein to protein basis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSize Exclusion Chromatography (SEC)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmount of protein as assessed by UV @ A280 nm and analytical SEC method determined the size of gel filtration column used: <1 mg=10/300 Superdex 200 GL column, 1-10 mg=16/60 Superdex 200, >10 mg=26/60 Superdex 200 (All GE Healthcare). IMAC elution pool was concentrated using 10 kD MWCO Ultracel centrifugal concentrator (Millipore) with the final concentrate volume being no more than 3% of the volume of gel filtration column used. Concentrate was injected onto column and the protein eluted isocratically at a flow rate not to exceed 76 cm/hr and no slower than 34 cm/hr. Elution fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the appropriate pool made.\n\n\n \nEndotoxin Removal\n\n\n \n \n \nFinal product specifications regarding endotoxin levels were determined by status of a particular cluster. SEC pool was concentrated to >0.25 mg/mL as determined by UV @ A280 nm using a 10 kD MWCO Ultracel centrifugal concentrator (Millipore). A Mustang E 0.22 um filter (PALL) was pre-wetted with SEC mobile phase buffer and the SEC concentrate filtered through it via manual syringe delivery system at a flow rate of ˜1 mL/min. Final filtered product was assayed for endotoxin using PTS EndoSafe system (Charles River), concentration via UV @ A280 nm, and aliquoted for storage.\n\n\n \nExample 8\n\n\nEstablishing 293/KDR/KZ136 Reporter Cell Line\n\n\n \n \n \nTo test for the ability of molecules to neutralize VEG-A\n165 \nactivity, a luciferase reporter cell line was created. 293/KDR cells, (Sibtech, Inc. Newington, Conn.), which stably-express VEGF-R2 (KDR/Flk-1), were seeded at a density of 250,000 cells/well in 6-well plates in complete medium (DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1× Sodium Pyruvate, 1× GlutaMax (Invitrogen)) and allowed to attach overnight at 37° C. in a humidified incubator at 5% CO\n2\n. The following day, cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and pKZ136 (ZymoGenetics, Inc), a plasmid containing a STAT-SRE-Luciferase cassette and neomycin selection marker using manufacturer's protocol. Signaling through VEGF-R2 will induce activation of the serum-response element (SRE) and mediate expression of luciferase. Briefly, 4 μg pKZ136 was added to 250 serum-free DMEM in one tube and 10 μl Lipofectamine 2000 reagent was added to 250 μl serum-free DMEM in another tube. Both tubes were mixed gently, incubated 5 min at room temperature (RT), and combined for 500 μl total volume. After 20 minutes at RT, complete medium was aspirated from the cells and the 500 μl Lipofectamine/DNA mix was added to the well. After 5 hours at 37° C., 5% CO\n2\n, 2 mL complete medium was added and cells were returned to the incubator and incubated overnight. The following day, medium was replaced with complete medium containing 500 μg/mL Geneticin (G418 Sulfate, Invitrogen) and selection for stable transfectants occurred in 10-14 days.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing establishment of the 293/KDR/KZ136 Geneticin-resistant cells, individual clones were isolated by limiting dilution method. Briefly, several 96-well culture plates were plated at a seeding density of 0.25 cells/well in 200 μl complete medium. After 15-20 days, wells that showed a single colony established were isolated and screened for luciferase activity in response to VEGFA-165. Isolated clones were plated in triplicate at a seeding density of 10,000 cells/well in 96-well opaque white cell-culture coated plates (Costar 1/3917) in complete medium and allowed to attach overnight. The following day, complete medium was removed by vacuum aspiration and replaced with 100 μl serum-free medium (DMEM, 1× Sodium Pyruvate, 1× GlutaMax, (Invitrogen)) and cells were serum-starved overnight. The next day, VEGF-A\n165 \nwas added at concentrations of 0.0263, 0.263, and 2.63 nM in serum-free medium and incubated at 37° C. for 4 hours. Luciferase activity was measured using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega, E1501) and a microplate luminometer (Berthold Technologies) according to manufacturer's protocol. Clone with the highest luciferase activity was designated 293/KDR/KZ136/c22 and used for screening assays.\n\n\n \nExample 9\n\n\nIdentification of Neutralizing Anti-VEGF scFvs Using the 293/KDR/KZ136/c22 VEGFA-Induced VEGF-R2 Phosphorylation Luminex Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nTo screen candidate molecules (scFv's, Fabs) for their ability to neutralize the activity of VEGFA, a cell-based luminex assay that measures phosphorylation of VEGF-R2 (KDR/Flk-1) was performed. 293/KDR/KZ136/c22 cells were plated at a density of 20,000 cells per well in 100 μl complete medium (DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1× Sodium Pyruvate, 1× GlutaMax (Invitrogen)) in clear 96-well tissue culture plates and allowed to attach overnight.

Human VEGF-A scFv was serially diluted in SFM at 500 nM, 50 nM, 5 nM, 0.5 nM, 0.05 nM, 0.005 nM, and 0.0005 nM. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were plated into 96-well flat-bottom plates in a volume of 100 μL at a density of 900-1000 cells per well. The HUVEC cells were plated for 2 days in complete EGM-2 MV media (Lonza, Walkersville, Md.) at 37° C., 5% CO\n2\n.

After about 72 hours, approximately 50 μL packed yeast cells taken from the Ura+ yeast transformants of a single plate was resuspended in 100 μL of lysis buffer (2% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA), 100 μL of Qiagen P1 buffer from a Qiagen miniprep kit (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif., catalog #27104), and 20 U of Zymolyase (Zymo Research, Orange, Calif., catalog #1001). This mixture was incubated for 30 minutes at 37° C., and the remainder of the Qiagen miniprep protocol was performed, starting with the addition of reagent P2. The DNA was eluted with 40 μL EB reagent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFifteen μL electrocompetent \nE. coli \ncells (DH112S, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) were transformed with 2 μL yeast DNA in a 0.2 cm electroporation cuvette. The cells were electropulsed at 1.75 kV, 25 μF, and 400 ohms. Following electroporation, 1 ml SOC (2% Bacto Tryptone (Difco, Detroit, Mich.), 0.5% yeast extract (Difco), 10 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl\n2\n, 10 mM MgSO\n4\n, mM glucose) was added to the cuvette. This solution was plated on two LB AMP plates (LB broth (Lennox), 1.8% Bacto Agar (Difco), 100 mg/L Ampicillin), one with 200 μL of transformants, the second with 100 μL.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIndividual clones were picked from the transformation plates, and were sequenced to identify one clone containing the correct expression construct for PDGFRβ-Fc5. Larger scale plasmid DNA was isolated using the Invitrogen mega prep kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif., catalog #457009) according to manufacturer's instructions.\n\n\n \n \nTransfection into 293F Cells\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo test for expression of PDGFRβ-Fc5, 1 million 293F cells were transiently transfected using 1 μg plasmid DNA and 1.3 μl Lipofectamine-2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif., catalog #11668-019) in 100 μl OptiMEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif., catalog #31985-070), following the Lipofectamine-2000 product procedure. The cells were grown in one well of a 12-well plate, shaking at 120 rpm, 37° C., 6% CO\n2\n. After 96 hours, medium was harvested and prepared for a Western blot assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInvitrogen materials and protocols were used for the Western blot with HRP-Goat anti-human IgG (H+L) (Jackson ImmunoResearch catalog #109-035-003) as the detection antibody. Significant expression was observed, so a large scale transfection was initiated.\n\n\n \nExample 14\n\n\nPanning for Antibodies that Bind PDGFRβ\n\n\n \n \n \nAntibodies that bind to the extracellular domain of PDGFRβ were identified by screening \nDyax Fab\n 310 and 410 phage libraries (Dyax Corp., Cambridge, Mass.). Selection and screening of the phage-antibody libraries utilized immobilized biotinylated antigen (PDGFRβ-Fc5; SEQ ID NO:486) captured on magnetic beads, Dynabeads M-280 Streptavidin (#112-06D, Invitrogen Dynal AS, Oslo, Norway). The antibodies were isolated by increasing the stringency after a few rounds of selection. The first generation of antibodies was in the Fab format. The soluble Fab antibodies were generated by MluI (#R0198S, New England Biolabs, Beverly, Mass.) enzyme digestion to remove the gene 3 from M13 phage. The same strategy of selection, screening and solubilizing was applied for antibodies in the scFv format.\n\n\n \nExample 15\n\n\nPlate-Based Binding Assay for PDGFRβ\n\n\n \n \n \nPositive clones from Fab format for PDGFRβ were screened by a plate based binding assay. Costar (#9018) 96-well plates were coated with 50 μl of anti-human IgG Fcg-specific antibody (#109-005-098, Jackson Immunology) at 1 μg/ml in 0.1M NaHCO\n3\n, pH 9.6 overnight at 4° C. The next day, plates were washed three times with 0.1% Tween-20/PBS (PBST). Each well was filled with 100 μl of 5% milk (#170-6404, Bio-Rad)/PBST for one hour at room temperature (RT) for blocking. 50 μl of either PDGFRβ-Fc5 (SEQ ID NO:486) or IL-27RA-Fc5 (SEQ ID NO:487) at 0.25 μg/ml in 2% BSA (#160069 MB Biomedicals)/PBST was added to each well for one hour at RT. Plates were washed three times with PBST. Each well was filled with 100 μl of 5% milk/PBST for one hour at RT for blocking. Assay plates were then washed three times with PBST. Each well was filled with 50 μl of Fab. Wells were then mixed and then incubated for one hour at RT. Plates were washed three times with PBST. For Fab detection, 50 μl of (1:4000) anti-Human Fab specific pAb-HRP (#31482, Pierce) in 2% BSA/PBST was added to each well for one hour at RT. Plates were then washed three times with PBST. 50 μl of TMB (TMBW-1000-01, BioFX Laboratories) was added to each well to develop for 10-20 min, followed by the addition of 50 μl of stop buffer (STPR-1000-01, BioFX Laboratories) to quench the reaction. Plates were then read at 450 nm on a plate reader.\n\n\n \nExample 16\n\n\nPDGFRβ Fab-ScFv Conversion\n\n\n \n \n \nLambda, kappa, and heavy chain variable regions were amplified from a pool of 10 round 2 PDGFRβ-panned Fab Dyax phage DNA arms in a 3 step process using primers directed against framework sequences for each subtype. The first round PCR amplifies each of the variable framework regions and adds appropriate overhangs to facilitate round 2 PCR reactions. Round 2 PCR reactions add appropriate gly/ser linker sequences to the ends of the proper round 1 PCR products and round 3 PCR reactions overlap the variable light chain lambda, variable light chain kappa and variable heavy chain products to create scFv products in both LH and HL orientations, which were then cloned into ApaLI/NotI-digested PIMD21 phage display vector.\n\n\n \nExample 17\n\n\nIdentification of Neutralizing sFab and scFv Using a Plate-Based Neutralization Assay for PDGFRβ\n\n\n \n \n \nPDGFRβ Fabs and scFvs were screened by a plate-based neutralization assay.

The next day, plates were washed three times with 0.1% Tween-20/PBS (PBST). Each well was filled with 100 μl of 5% milk (#170-6404, Bio-Rad)/PBST for one hour at room temperature (RT) for blocking. 50 μl of PDGFRβ (made in-house) at 0.25 μg/ml in 2% BSA (#160069 MB Biomedicals)/PBST was added to each well for one hour at RT. Plates were washed three times with PBST. Each well was filled with 100 μl of 5% milk/PBST for one hour at RT for blocking. Assay plates were then washed three times with PBST. Each well was filled with 50 μl of a (1:1) mixture of either Fab or scFv supernatant and biotinylated PDGF-B (SEQ ID NO:488) homodimer (PDGF-BB) at 0.0112 μg/ml in 2% BSA/PBST for one hour at RT. Plates were washed three times with PBST. 50 μl of (1:3000) Streptavidin-HRP (#21124, Pierce) in 2% BSA/PBST was added to each well for one hour at RT. Plates were then washed three times with PBST. 50 μl of TMB (TMBW-1000-01, BioFX Laboratories) was added to each well to develop for 20-30 min, followed by the addition of 50 μl of stop buffer (STPR-1000-01, BioFX Laboratories) to quench the reaction.

Surface plasmon resonance allows monitoring of both association and dissociation phases during biomolecular interactions (Ohlson, \nJ. Mal. Recognit., \n1997). The association rate constant (k\na \n(M\n−1\ns\n−1\n)) is a value that reflects the rate of the antigen-antagonist complex formation.

By dividing the association rate constant by the dissociation rate constant (k\na\n/k\nd\n) the equilibrium association constant (K\nA \n(M\n−1\n)) is obtained. By dividing the dissociation rate constant by the association rate constant (k\nd\n/k\na\n) the equilibrium dissociation constant (K\nD \n(M)) is obtained. This value describes the binding affinity of the interaction. Interactions with the same K\nc\n, can have widely variable association and dissociation rate constants.

After 48 hours cells were removed with trypsin (Gibco Laboratories, Grand Island, N.Y.)) and seeded into 100×20 mm plates in growth media (DMEM (Gibco), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-Glutamine and 1 mM sodium pyruvate plus 500 ug/ml Geneticin (Gibco) to select for stable transfectants, and were maintained in this media. After approximately one week stable cells were removed with trypsin, counted on a hemacytometer, and added to 96 well flat bottom plates (Falcon) at a density of one cell per well in a volume of 100 ul growth media plus Geneticin. After one week of growth, wells were scored for single colonies under a microscope. After additional growth cells were removed with trypsin and transferred to a new 96 well plate and allowed to become confluent. Cells were removed with 25 ul trypsin and resuspended in 75 ul growth media. Three replica plates were made, each with 30 ul of the cell mixture. Two plates were 96 well solid white (Corning Costar, Corning, N.Y.) for a luciferase assay and one was a clear 96 well plate (Falcon) for recovery of positive clones. The following day media on the white plates was replaced with serum free media.

Chamber slides are incubated at 37° and 5% CO\n2 \nfor 1-2 days until they reach approximately 75% confluency. The binding of PDGFRβ/VEGFA antagonists and control antibody are done at 4°, so all slides are placed on ice and washed one time with cold DMEM+0.1% BSA. The PDGFRβ/VEGFA antagonists and test antibody are then diluted to 1 ug/ml in binding buffer consisting of DMEM+3% BSA and Hepes buffer. Each slide is configured so that two antagonists, one control antibody and one control well for secondary antibody only are designated for each chamber slide. 500 ul/well of antagonists, control, or media only is added to each chamber slide. Following a one hour incubation, the TO slide is fixed by washing with cold PBS one time and adding 1 ml/well paraformaldehyde solution. This TO slide measures receptor expression on the cell surface and the slides incubated at 37° C. measure receptor internalization over time. The remaining slides are put in the 37° incubator and removed and fixed in a similar fashion at thirty minutes, ninety minutes, four hour and six hour time points. All slides are kept on ice after fixation. Once all of the slides have been fixed, they are washed one time with PBS and permeabilized for two minutes with −20° C. MetOH. The slides are washed again with cold PBS. From now on the staining is done at room temperature. The slides are incubated at room temperature for five minutes in 50 mM Glycine made up in PBS. The glycine is removed and washed off with PBS, and the slides are blocked in 10% normal goat serum in PBS (#S-1000, Vector Labs, Inc. Burlingame, Calif.), 500 ul/well for thirty minutes. Following the blocking step, 500 ul/well of the secondary antibodies are added to every well. \nAlexafluor\n 488 goat anti-mouse (Cat. # A11029, Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg.), or \nAlexafluor\n 488 goat anti-human (Cat. # A11013, Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg.) are diluted 1:150 in wash buffer consisting of PBS+0.1% Tween 20 and 0.1% BSA. The slides are incubated in the dark at room temperature for forty-five minutes. Each slide is washed three times by soaking in PBS for 5 minutes at room temperature. One drop of Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI stain is added to each chamber (Cat. # H-1200, Vector Labs, Inc., Burlingame Calif.) and the slides are coverslipped and examined under the fluorescent microscope. Metavue software is used to visualize the two-color staining profile.\n\n\n \nExample 28\n\n\nFcRn Binding Assay for Measuring Binding of PDGFRβ/VEGF-A Antagonists to FcRn at pH 6.0 and pH 7.4\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nTwo plates are set up with PDGFRβ/VEGFA antagonists and control antibodies: one to wash at pH 6.0 and one to wash at pH 7.4. Day 1: Two Nunc Maxisorp 96 well elisa plates (cat #44-2404) are coated with 300 ng/well NeutrAvidin (Pierce Chemical Co. cat. #31000) made up in 100 mM NaHCO\n3\n, pH 9.3. Plates are incubated at 4° C. overnight. Day 2: The plates are washed 5 times with 0.1% Tween-20/PBS (PBST). The plates are then blocked with 250 ul/well of blocking buffer containing 0.8% NaCl, 0.02% KCl, 0.102% Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 0.02% KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 1% BSA, 0.05% Polysorbate, 0.05% Proclin 300 pH 7.2, for one hour at room temperature. The plates are then washed 2 times with PBST. Each well is then coated with 150 ng of biotinylated FCRN protein (produced in-house) diluted in PBST+1% BSA. Plates are incubated at room temperature for one hour. PDGFRβ/VEGFA antagonists and control antibodies (Herceptin, for example) are diluted in 100 mM NaPO\n4\n, 0.05% Tween 20 (v/v), +0.1% BSA adjusted to pH 6.0 (pH 6.0 buffer) at concentrations ranging from 150 nM to 0.07 nM. Samples are tested in duplicate at a volume of 50 ul/well of each concentration. pH 6.0 buffer only is run as a control to determine the background levels on each plate. Plates are incubated at room temperature for two hours. After the binding step, each plate is washed in separate buffers: one plate is washed with 250 ul/well of pH 6.0 buffer, and one plate is washed with 250 ul/well of 100 mM NaPO\n4\n, 0.05% Tween 20 (v/v), 0.1% BSA adjusted to pH 7.4 (pH 7.4 buffer). Plates are incubated in wash buffers at room temperature for a total of one hour with a wash step performed every twenty minutes. Following the wash steps, the bound antibody is detected with 100 ul/well of HRP goat anti-human IgG F(ab)\n2 \nfragment Fc gamma specific secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Cat. #109-036-098). The secondary antibody is diluted 1:5,000 in the pH 6.0 buffer, and the incubation is done for one hour at room temperature. Plates are then washed 5 times with PBST. Finally, 100 ul of TMB (TMBW-1000-01, BioFX Laboratories) is added to each well, and the plates are developed at room temperature for approximately three minutes. At this point, 100 μl/well of stop buffer (STPR-100-01, BioFX Laboratories) is added to quench the reaction. The plates are read on a spectrophotometer at a wave length of 450/570 nm. OD values are examined to compare binding patterns at pH 6.0 and release patterns at pH 7.4.\n\n\n \nExample 29\n\n\nConstruction of Anti-PDGFRβ/VEGF-A Bispecific Molecule Panel\n\n\nA. Overview\n\n\n \n \n \nExemplary expression construct formats for an anti-PDGFRβ/VEGF-A bispecific molecule include tandem single chain FvFcs (tascFvFcs), bi-single chain FvFcs (biscFvFcs), and biAbs. The definitions of these molecular formats are as follows: A tascFvFc has two scFvs side by side connected by a tether and fused directly to an Fc. A biscFvFc has both an amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal scFv fused to a Fc with the carboxyl-terminal connected via a linker. Both tascFvFcs and biscFvFcs, for the purposes of this example, have an effector function minus Fc (Fc5) (SEQ ID NO:492). A biAb is a whole immunoglobulin with a carboxyl-terminal scFv connected via a linker. In the case of biAbs described in this example, the heavy chain used was an effector function minus human gamma1 (IgG1.1) and the light chain constant regions were kappa. These molecules are shown in \nFIG. 2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the purposes of describing tandem single chain Fv molecules, a tether is defined as a polypeptide that connects two single chain Fvs and the linker refers to the polypeptide that connects the two variable domains comprising a single chain Fv and to any polypeptide linking an scFv to an Fc or immunoglobulin heavy chain. The linker sequence used in the scFv molecules described in this Example is (G\n4\nS)\n5 \n(SEQ ID NO:494). The tether sequence used for tascFvFcs is typically (G\n4\nS)\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:496). The carboxyl-terminal linker used to connect scFvs to Fc in the bisc and biAb format is the same as the tether sequence for the tascFvFcs. The scFv sequences were fused to Fc5, a modified form of human gamma1 Fc that is effector minus for the biscFvFcs. The scFv sequences were fused to IgG1.1, an effector function minus whole human immunoglobulin gamma1 for the biAbs.\n\n\n \nTandem Single Chain FvFc Construction\n\n\n \n \n \nSingle chain Fv PCR fragments are each constructed by overlapping two PCR fragments, one each for the variable heavy and variable light regions with the internal overlap region in the 25mer (G\n4\nS)\n5 \nlinker.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo PCR fragments are generated, one for each scFv and assembled into tandem scFvFcs by the following method: The scFv at the 5′ end has oligo sequence overlapping mouse 26-10 VH signal sequence and with tether region between the two scFvs. The 3′ scFv has oligo sequence overlapping the tether and the Fc5 fusion partner. Each scFv fragment is assembled by PCR. The scFv fragments are assembled into a tandem scFv and inserted at the NotI site of pZMP31-ms 26-10VH-Fc5 by yeast recombination as described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe PCR amplification reaction conditions are as follows: 1 cycle, 95° C., 2 minutes; 30 cycles, 95° C., 15 seconds, followed by 55° C., 30 seconds, followed by 68° C., 1 minute per kb. The PCR reaction mixture is run on a 1% agarose gel and the DNA fragment corresponding to the expected size is extracted from the gel using the GE Healthcare Illustra GFX™ PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit (United Kingdom).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cDNAs are cloned into the vector pZMP31-ms 26-10VH-Fc5 (SEQ ID NO:648) for tandem single chain FvFcs (tascFv-Fcs) by yeast recombination. The vector pZMP31-ms 26-10VH-Fc5 is derived from pZMP31 (SEQ ID NO:647) by the addition of mouse 26-10 VH signal sequence and Fc5 with a NotI restriction site between for insertion of cDNA. pZMP31 is a mammalian expression vector containing an expression cassette having the chimeric CMV enhancer/MPSV promoter, a EcoRI site for linearization for insertion of cDNA, a poliovirus internal ribosome entry site (IRES), a DHFR cDNA, the SV40 terminator, an \nE. coli \norigin of replication, and \nS. cerevisiae \nURA3 and CEN-ARS genes. This vector is derived from pZMP21 (U.S. Pat. No. 7,262,025).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrior to recombination in yeast with the gel-extracted PCR fragments, the pZMP31-ms 26-10VH-Fc5 plasmid is digested with NotI. 100 μl of electrocompetent yeast (\nS. cerevisiae \nSF838-9D, URA-) are combined with approximately 12 μl of each gel-extracted an PCR fragments and approximately 100 ng of NotI digested pZMP31-ms 26-10VH-Fc5 vector. The mix is transferred to a 0.2 cm electroporation cuvette. The yeast/DNA mixture is electropulsed using power supply (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, Calif.) settings of 0.75 kV (5 kV/cm), co ohms, and 25 μF. Six hundred μl of 1.2 M sorbitol are added to the cuvette, and the yeast are plated in 300 μl aliquots onto two URA-D plates and incubated at 30° C. After about 72 hours, the Ura\n+\n yeast transformants from a single plate are resuspended in 1 ml H\n2\nO and spun briefly to pellet the yeast cells. The cell pellet is resuspended in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (2% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA). The 500 μl of the lysis mixture is added to an Eppendorf tube containing 250 μl acid-washed glass beads and 300 μl phenol-chloroform, is vortexed for 3 minutes, and spun for 5 minutes in an Eppendorf centrifuge at maximum speed. Three hundred μl of the aqueous phase is transferred to a fresh tube, and the DNA is precipitated with 600 μl ethanol, followed by centrifugation for 30 minutes at maximum speed. The tube is decanted and the pellet is washed with 1 mL of 70% ethanol. The tube is decanted and the DNA pellet is resuspended in 10 μl water.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTransformation of electrocompetent \nE. coli \nhost cells (DH10B, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) is done using 1 μl of the yeast DNA preparation and 20 μl of \nE. coli \ncells. The cells are electropulsed at 2.0 kV, 25 μF, and 400 ohms. Following electroporation, 1 ml SOC (2% Bacto™ Tryptone (Difco, Detroit, Mich.), 0.5% yeast extract (Difco), 10 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl\n2\n, 10 mM MgSO\n4\n, 20 mM glucose) are added and the cells are plated in 50 μl and 200 μl aliquots on two LB AMP plates (LB broth (Lennox), 1.8% Bacto™ Agar (Difco), 100 mg/L Ampicillin).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe plasmid is extracted from six \nE. coli \nclones for each construct, subjected to sequence analysis and one clone containing the correct sequence was selected for further use. Large-scale plasmid DNA is isolated using a commercially available kit (QIAGEN Plasmid Mega Kit, Qiagen, Valencia, Calif.) according to manufacturer's instructions.\n\n\n \nA.

The first PCR used a 5′ oligonucleotide which overlapped the BsrGI site in the immunoglobulin gamma1 Fc region and the 3′ oligo overlapped the (G\n4\nS)\n2 \nlinker. The second PCR fragment used a 5′ oligonucleotide that overlapped at the (G\n4\nS)\n2 \nlinker region and contained the scFv fragment.

General\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSingle chain Fv PCR fragments were each constructed by overlapping two PCR fragments, one each for the variable heavy and variable light regions with the internal overlap region in the 25mer (G\n4\nS)\n5 \nlinker.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThree PCR fragments were generated for assembly of a bi-single chain FvFc (biscFvFc) molecule. The scFv at the 5′ end had the mouse 26-10 VH signal sequence added via oligo design and overlapped with the 5′ untranslated region of the vector and with the Fc region. The second PCR fragment consisted of the Fc5 fragment, which overlapped with the linker sequence which connects the carboxyl terminal scFv to the Fc region. The 3′ scFv overlapped the linker sequence on the carboxyl terminus of the Fc and the polio virus IRES (internal ribosomal entry site).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe PCR amplification reaction conditions were as follows: 1 cycle, 95° C., 2 minutes; 30 cycles, 95° C., 15 seconds, followed by 55° C., 30 seconds, followed by 68° C., 1 minute per kb. The PCR reaction mixture was run on a 1% agarose gel and the DNA fragment corresponding to the expected size was extracted from the gel using the GE Healthcare Illustra GFX™ PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit (United Kingdom).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cDNAs were cloned into the vector pZMP31 by yeast recombination. pZMP31 is a mammalian expression vector containing an expression cassette having the chimeric CMV enhancer/MPSV promoter, a EcoRI site for linearization for insertion of cDNA, a poliovirus internal ribosome entry site (IRES), a DHFR cDNA, the SV40 terminator, an \nE. coli \norigin of replication, and \nS. cerevisiae \nURA3 and CEN-ARS genes. This vector was derived from pZMP21 (U.S. Pat. No. 7,262,025).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrior to recombination in yeast with the gel-extracted PCR fragments, the pZMP31 plasmid was digested with EcoRI. 100 μl of electrocompetent yeast (\nS. cerevisiae \nSF838-9D, URA-) were combined with approximately 12 μl of each gel-extracted PCR fragment and approximately 100 ng of EcoRI-digested pZMP31. The mix was transferred to a 0.2 cm electroporation cuvette. The yeast/DNA mixture was electropulsed using power supply (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, Calif.) settings of 0.75 kV (5 kV/cm), ∞ ohms, and 25 μF. Six hundred μl of 1.2 M sorbitol was added to the cuvette, and the yeast was plated in 300 μl aliquots onto two URA-D plates and incubated at 30° C. After about 72 hours, the Ura yeast transformants from a single plate were resuspended in 1 ml H\n2\nO and spun briefly to pellet the yeast cells. The cell pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (2% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA). The 500 μl of the lysis mixture was added to an Eppendorf tube containing 250 μl acid-washed glass beads and 300 μl phenol-chloroform, was vortexed for 3 minutes, and spun for 5 minutes in an Eppendorf centrifuge at maximum speed. Three hundred μl of the aqueous phase was transferred to a fresh tube, and the DNA was precipitated with 600 μl ethanol, followed by centrifugation for 30 minutes at maximum speed. The tube was decanted and the pellet was washed with 1 mL of 70% ethanol. The tube was decanted and the DNA pellet was resuspended in 10 μl water.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTransformation of electrocompetent \nE. coli \nhost cells (DH10B, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) was done using 1 μl of the yeast DNA preparation and 20 μl of \nE. coli \ncells. The cells were electropulsed at 2.0 kV, 25 μF, and 400 ohms. Following electroporation, 1 ml SOC (2% Bacto™ Tryptone (Difco, Detroit, Mich.), 0.5% yeast extract (Difco), 10 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl\n2\n, 10 mM MgSO\n4\n, 20 mM glucose) was added and the cells were plated in 50 μl and 200 μl aliquots on two LB AMP plates (LB broth (Lennox), 1.8% Bacto™ Agar (Difco), 100 mg/L Ampicillin).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe plasmid was extracted from six \nE. coli \nclones for each construct, subjected to sequence analysis and one clone containing the correct sequence was selected for further use. Large-scale plasmid DNA was isolated using a commercially available kit (QIAGEN Plasmid Mega Kit, Qiagen, Valencia, Calif.) according to manufacturer's instructions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n2. Construction of BiscFvFcs c941/c868, c941/c870, 941/c1039, c1035/c868, c1035/c870, and c1035/c1039\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThree PCR fragments were generated for assembly of a bi-single chain FvFc (biscFvFc) molecule. The scFv at the 5′ end was either c941.1 contained in SEQ ID NO:603 or c1035.1 contained in SEQ ID NO:605 and had the mouse 26-10 VH signal sequence added via oligo design and overlapped with the 5′ untranslated region of the vector and with the Fc region. The second PCR fragment consisted of the Fc5 fragment, which overlapped with the linker sequence which connects the carboxyl terminal scFv to the Fc region. The 3′ scFv was either c868.1 contained in SEQ ID NO:607, c870.1 contained in SEQ ID NO:609, or 1039.1 contained in SEQ ID NO:611 and overlapped the linker sequence on the carboxyl terminus of the Fc and the polio virus IRES (internal ribosomal entry site).

The 293 transfections are performed using methods known in the art. Conditioned media is harvested, sterile filtered using 0.2 gm filters and adjusted to pH 7.4. The protein is purified from the filtered media using a combination of POROS® A50 Protein A Affinity Chromatography (Applied Biosciences, Foster City, Calif.) and Superdex 200 Size Exclusion Chromatography (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, N.J.) A 4 ml POROS® A50 column (10 mm×50 mm) is pre-eluted with three column volumes (CV) of 25 mM Citrate-Phosphate (1.61 mM Sodium Citrate-23.4 mM Sodium Phosphate,) 250 mM Ammonium Sulfate pH 3 buffer and equilibrated with 20 CV 25 mM Citrate-Phosphate, 250 mM Ammonium Sulfate pH 7.4.

The filters are then blocked with 10% non-fat dry milk in 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.05% Igepal (TBS) for 15 minutes at room temperature. The nitrocellulose is quickly rinsed, and the IgG-HRP antibody (1:10,000) is added. The blots are incubated overnight at 4° C., with gentle shaking. Following the incubation, the blots are washed three times for 10 minutes each in TBS, and then quickly rinsed in H\n2\nO.

The seeding density is 100,000 cells/insert in a 250 ul volume in DMEM+hepes buffer and 0.1% BSA media. All test and control samples are run in triplicate. Following the addition of cells to the upper insert, the plate wells are filled with a 750 ul volume of test solutions and controls. Positive controls are 10% fetal bovine serum and VEGFA (R&D Systems) at 0.1-50 ng/ml. The negative control is DMEM+hepes buffer and 0.1% BSA. Test samples consist of similar concentrations of VEGFA+PDGFRβ/VEGFA antagonist at varying concentrations. The VEGFA samples (+/−PDGFRβ/VEGFA antagonist) may be made up in low concentrations of FBS. The insert plate is incubated at 37° C., 5% CO\n2 \nfor 21-23 hours. The migrated HUVEC are measured by labeling them with calcein, AM fluorescent dye (#C3100MP) Molecular Probes). Calcein AM is diluted in warm, 37° C. Hanks Basic Salt Solution at a concentration of 4 ug/ml. The diluted dye is added to each well of a new 24 well plate, 500 μl/well. The inner insert containing the cells is removed from the original plate, and the contents are flicked out into the sink, being careful not to disturb migrated cells adhered to the underside of the insert. The inserts are then placed in the wells containing the calcein dye, and the entire plate is returned to the 37° C., 5% CO\n2 \nincubator for 90 minutes. Fluorescent measurements are read from the bottom using the Cytoflour 4000 (Applied BioSystems) at excitation/emission wavelengths of 485/530 nm.

Summary\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo test efficacy of the PDGFRβ/VEGF-A bispecific antagonist, an in vitro co-culture system of endothelial cells and pericytes were established as described (Darland et al, Dev Biol 264 (2003), 275). In this co-culture, HUVECs coated on Cytodex beads are co-cultured with human mesenchymal stem cells (Lonzo) in presence of EGM-2 complete media and D551 fibroblast conditioned media in fibrin gel. Either at start of the experiment or at Day 7 of the experiment, 0.1-50 nM of control antagonist, PDGFRβ antagonist, VEGF-A antagonist or PDGFRβ/VEGF-A antagonist are added to the cultures. Cells are fixed on Day 8 after addition of antagonists using PFA. Cells are then stained by IHC using anti-smooth muscle cell actin (aSMA) or anti-PECAM antibodies to identify pericytes and endothelial cells respectively. In wells with control antagonist treatment, these cells form sprouts of endothelial cells protected by a covering of pericytes. In cells treated with VEGF-A, PDGFRβ, or PDGFRβ/VEGF-A antagonists, numbers of sprouts and length of the sprouts are reduced suggesting that the antagonist shows efficacy in this in vitro coculture model. Efficacy of PDGFRβ or PDGFRβ/VEGF-A antagonists may be further demonstrated by dissociation of pericytes from endothelial cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nB. Study Design\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOn Day 1, Cytodex-3 beads are coated with HUVECs and incubated overnight at 37° C., 5% CO\n2\n. On Day 2, HUVEC beads (200 beads/well) are embedded in fibrin gel along with human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) (40,000 cells/well) in wells of a 24 well plate. A 1:1 mixture of EGM-2 complete media and D551 fibroblast media are added to these cells along with 2 ng/mL of HGF. Medium is replaced every two days till end of the experiment. Antagonists are added to the culture at Day 2 (from start of the co-culture) or at Day 7 (after co-culture formation). Cells are fixed in 4% PFA overnight six days after addition of antagonists. Cells are stained with anti-PECAM or anti-SMA antibodies followed by secondary antibody (fluorescent conjugated). Cells are then viewed by microscope and the numbers and lengths of sprouts counted manually for a representative set of 10 beads/well. The averages for the well are then calculated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn wells with control antagonist treatment, these cells form sprouts of endothelial cells protected by a covering of pericytes. In cells treated with VEGF-A, PDGFRβ, or PDGFRβ/VEGF-A antagonists, numbers of sprouts and length of the sprouts are reduced suggesting that the antagonist shows efficacy in this in vitro co-culture model. Efficacy of PDGFRβ or PDGFRβ/VEGF-A antagonists may be also be shown by dissociation of pericytes from endothelial cells.\n\n\n \nExample 34\n\n\nChorioallantoic Membrane (CAM) Assay for Evaluating PDGFRβ/VEGF-A Antagonists In Vivo\n\n\n \n \n \nThree-day old fertilized white Leghorn eggs are cracked, and chicken embryos with intact yolks are carefully placed in 20.times.100 mm plastic Petri dishes. After six days of incubation in 3% CO\n2 \nat 37° C., a disk of methylcellulose containing at least two PDGF/VEGF molecules (such as VEGF-A and PDGF-BB) and a control monoclonal antibody or a bispecific antibody substance, and/or soluble VEGFR complexes, dried on a nylon mesh (3×3 mm) is implanted on the CAM of individual embryos to determine the influence of bispecific antibody on vascular development and potential uses thereof to inhibit vascular formation. The nylon mesh disks are made by desiccation of 10 microliters of 0.45% methylcellulose (in H\n2\nO). After 4-5 days of incubation, embryos and CAMs are examined for the formation of new blood vessels and lymphatic vessels in the field of the implanted disks by a stereoscope. Disks of methylcellulose containing PBS are used as negative controls. Antibodies that recognize both blood and lymphatic vessel cell surface molecules are used to further characterize the vessels. Inhibition of new blood vessel growth in the presence of a bispecific antibody composition relative to a control monoclonal antibody indicates efficacy of the bispecific antibody composition for treatment of angiogenesis associated disorders.\n\n\n \nExample 35\n\n\nCorneal Assay for Evaluating PDGFRβ/VEGF-A Antagonists In Vivo\n\n\n \n \n \nCorneal micropockets are created with a modified von Graefe cataract knife in both eyes of male 5- to 6-week-old C57BL6/J mice or female New Zealand white rabbits. A micropellet (0.35×0.35 mm) of sucrose aluminum sulfate (Bukh Meditec, Copenhagen, Denmark) coated with hydron polymer type NCC (IFN Science, New Brunswick, N.J.) containing various concentrations of two or more PDGF-BB/VEGF-A alone or in combination with: i) factors known to modulate vessel growth (e.g., 80 ng of FGF-2); ii) monoclonal antibody specific for one of the growth factors; or iii) a bispecific antibody composition. The pellet is positioned 0.6-0.8 mm from the limbus. After implantation, erythromycin/ophthalmic ointment is applied to the eyes. Eyes are examined by a slit-lamp biomicroscope over a course of 3-12 days. Vessel length and clock-hours of circumferential neovascularization and lymphangiogenesis are measured. Furthermore, eyes are cut into sections and are immunostained for blood vessel and/or lymphatic markers LYVE-1 (Prevo et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n276: 19420-19430, 2001), podoplanin (Breiteneder-Geleff et al., \nAm. J. Pathol. \n154: 385-94, 1999) to further characterize affected vessels. Inhibition of vessel growth in the presence of a bispecific antibody composition relative to a control antibody indicates efficacy of the bispecific antibody composition for treatment of angiogenesis associated disorders.\n\n\n \nExample 36\n\n\nA673 Rhabdomyosarcoma Model for Evaluating Efficacy of PDGFRβ/VEGF-A Antagonists Against Tumor Growth\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n \n \n \nTo test if the PDGFRβ/VEGF-A bispecific antagonist has activity on tumor growth in mice, groups of mice are injected s.c with the A673 rhabdomyosarcoma tumor on \nDay\n 0.

Tumor volume is monitored 3×/week for 5 weeks. Significantly smaller tumors in mice injected with a VEGF-A antagonist, PDGFRβ antagonist, or PDGFRβ/VEGF-A antagonist, as compared to mice injected with control reagent, indicates efficacy of the antagonist for inhibition of tumor growth. Efficacy of a PDGFRβ/VEGF-A antagonist over individual treatments with either VEGF-A antagonist or PDGFRβ antagonist alone can also be evaluated.\n\n\n \nStudy Design\n\n\n \n \n \nEight to ten-week old female C.B-17 SCID mice (Charles River Laboratories) are injected s.c. on the right flank with 2×10\n6 \nA673 cells on Day O, Starting with a tumor size of 150-200 mm\n3\n, groups of mice (n=10/group) are injected i.p. with 1 mg/Kg to 30 mg/Kg control reagent, VEGF-A antagonist, PDGFRβ antagonist or PDGFRβ/VEGF-A antagonist 1×-3×/week for 3 weeks.

The vessels that grow into the normally avascular cornea, can become well established, making this an attractive model to study vessel regression. In this example, effectiveness of PDGFRβ/VEGF-A antagonist is demonstrated using the corneal neovascularization model. To induce experimental corneal NV, male C57BL/6 mice (18-20 g; Charles River, Wilmington, Mass.) are anesthetized with intramuscular ketamine hydrochloride (25 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). NaOH (2 μl of 0.2 mM) are applied topically. The corneal and limbal epithelia are removed by applying a rotary motion parallel to the limbus using #21 blade (Feather, Osaka, Japan). After 7 days or 10 days (regression model), mice are treated with intra-peritoneal injections of 1-25 mg/kg of control reagent, VEGF-A antagonist, PDGFRβ antagonist, or PDGFRβ/VEGF-A bispecific antagonist. At day 14 or day 20 (regression model) following corneal NV induction, mice receive 20 μg/g of fluorescein-isothiocyanate coupled concanavalin A lectin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, Calif.) intravenously whilst deeply anesthetized with xylazine hydrochloride and ketamine hydrochloride. Thirty minutes later, mice eyes are enucleated, and the corneas flat-mounted. Corneal NV is visualized using fluorescence microscopy and quantified using Openlab software. The percent of cornea covered by vessels is calculated as a percentage of total corneal area. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the PDGFRβ/VEGF-A antagonists relative to control reagent, or over individual treatments with the PDGFRβ or VEGF-A antagonists alone.\n\n\n \nExample 39\n\n\nCorneal Neovascularization (Corneal NT) Model of Ocular Disease for Evaluating Efficacy of PDGFRβ/VEGF-A Antagonists Against Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)\n\n\n \n \n \nExperimental CNV is often used as a model for Age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In this model, vessels of the choroid grow through breaks in Bruch's membrane and into the retina, similar to what is observed in AMD patients. To induce experimental CNV, male C57BL/6 mice (18-20 g; Charles River, Wilmington, Mass.) are anesthetized with intramuscular ketamine hydrochloride (25 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) and the pupils are dilated with 1% tropicamide. Four burns are generated using diode laser photocoagulation (75 μm spot size, 0.1-second duration, 90 mW, Oculight SL laser, IRIDEX, Mountain View, Calif.) and a hand-held cover slide as a contact lens. Burns localized to the 3, 6, 9, and 12 o'clock positions of the posterior pole of the retina. Production of a bubble at the time of laser, which indicates rupture of Bruch's membrane, is an important factor in obtaining choroidal neovascularization, so only mice in which a bubble was produced for all four burns are included in the study. After 7 days or 14 days (regression model), mice are treated daily with an intraperitoneal injection of 1-25 mg/kg of control reagent, VEGF-A antagonist, PDGFRβ antagonist, or PDGFRβ/VEGF-A bispecific antagonist twice a day. After 7 days or 14 days (regression model) of treatment, the area of choroidal NV lesions is measured in flat-mounted choroid stained with PECAM. Flat-mounts are examined by fluorescence microscopy and quantified using Openlab software. Decrease in CNV area in the eyes treated with PDGFRβ/VEGF-A antagonist, relative to control reagent, indicates that the bispecific antagonist is a potent inhibitor of neovascularization. Decrease in CNV area in the eyes treated with PDGFRβ/VEGF-A antagonist, relative to either VEGF-A antagonist or PDGFRβ antagonist alone, indicates efficacy of the PDGFRβ/VEGF-A antagonist over the individual treatments.\n\n\n \nExample 40\n\n\nCharacterization of Anti-Hu-PDGF-Receptor-β Antagonists\n\n\n \n \n \nEpitope binning experiments were performed to determine which PDGFR-β antagonists (scFv, Fab, huIgG, msIgG) are capable of binding simultaneously to human PDGFR-β. PDGFR-β antagonists that compete for the same, or an overlapping, binding site (epitope) on the antigen are not able to bind simultaneously and are functionally grouped into a single family or “epitope bin.” PDGFR-β antagonists that do not compete for the same binding site on the antigen are able to bind simultaneously and are grouped into separate families or epitope bins. Experiments were performed using a Biacore 3000™ instrument. Biacore is only one of a variety of assay formats that are routinely used to assign panels of antibody fragments and monoclonal antibodies to epitope bins. Many references (e.g., \nThe Epitope Mapping Protocols, Methods in Molecular Biology\n, \n \nVolume\n \n 6,6 Glenn E. Morris ed.) describe alternative methods that can be used to “bin” the antibody fragments and which would be expected to provide comparable data regarding the binding characteristics of the PDGFR-β antagonists to PDGFR-β Fc5. Epitope binning experiments were performed with PDGFRβ-Fc5 (SEQ ID NO:486).\n\n\n \nMaterials and Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nEpitope binning studies were performed on a Biacore3000® system (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, N.J.). Methods were programmed using Biacore3000® Control Software v. 3.2. Polyclonal goat anti-human IgG Fc-gamma antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, Pa.) was covalently immobilized to a Biacore® CM5 sensor chip using amine coupling chemistry (EDC:NHS) to a density of 8,000 RU. After the immobilization procedure, active sites on the flow cell were blocked with ethanolamine. The non-specifically bound protein was removed by washing with 50 mM NaOH. PDGFRβ-Fc5 antigen and PDGFR-β antagonists were diluted to 5 μg/ml.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPDGFR-β Fc5 was captured on the anti-human Fc surface at approximately 250 RU. This was followed with blocking of the unoccupied Fc binding sites on the chip using whole hu-IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, Pa.). A primary PDGFR-β antagonist injected for 120 seconds at 20 μl/min and allowed to specifically bind to the captured PDGFR-β-Fc5 at the saturation level. The Biacore™ instrument measures the mass of protein bound to the sensor chip and the binding of both PDGFRβ-Fc5 and the primary binning candidate can be verified for each cycle. Following the binding of the primary PDGFR-β antagonist, a secondary PDGFR-β antagonist was injected and allowed to bind to the PDGFR-β Fc5 that is captured on the anti-human Fc surface.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll binding experiments were performed at 25° C. in a buffer of 10 mM HEPES, 500 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.05% surfactant P20, 0.01 mg/mL bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4. Buffer injections were also performed to allow for subtraction of instrument noise and drift. Between cycles, the flow cell was washed with 10 mM Glycine, pH 1.75 to remove bound PDGFRβ Fc5. Data was compiled using Biacore 3000™ Evaluation software.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe experimental results were interpreted as follows. If the secondary PDGFR-β antagonist was not capable of binding to PDGFR-β-Fc5 antigen simultaneously with the primary antagonist, it was functionally grouped into a single family or epitope bin. However, if the secondary PDGFR-β antagonist was capable of binding the antigen simultaneously with the primary antagonist by showing an increase in mass on the surface of the chip it was grouped into a separate family or epitope bin. Each PDGFR-β antagonist was tested against itself as a negative control to establish the level of the background (no-binding) signal.\n\n\n \nResults\n\n\n \n \n \nPurified PDGFR-β antagonists were characterized and assigned into epitope bins (see Table 25). The signal (RU, response units) reported by the Biacore is directly correlated to the mass on the sensor chip surface. Once the level of background signal (RU) associated with the negative controls was established (the same PDGFR-β antagonists used as both the primary and secondary antagonists), the binning results were reported as either positive or negative binding. Positive binding indicates that two different PDGFR-β antagonists are capable of binding the antigen simultaneously. Negative binding indicates that two different PDGFR-β antagonists are not capable of binding the antigen simultaneously.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe differential between positive and negative response values in this experiment was significant and allowed for an unambiguous assignment of the 8 purified PDGFR-β antagonists into two distinct families or epitope bins.

VEGF-A antagonists that compete for the same, or an overlapping, binding site (epitope) on the antigen are not able to bind simultaneously and are functionally grouped into a single family or “epitope bin.” VEGF-A antagonists that do not compete for the same binding site on the antigen are able to bind simultaneously and are grouped into separate families or epitope bins. Experiments were performed using a Biacore T100™ instrument. Biacore is only one of a variety of assay formats that are routinely used to assign panels of antibody fragments and monoclonal antibodies to epitope bins. Many references (e.g., \nThe Epitope Mapping Protocols, Methods in Molecular Biology\n, \n \nVolume\n \n 6,6 Glenn E. Morris ed.) describe alternative methods that can be used to “bin” the antibody fragments and which would be expected to provide comparable data regarding the binding characteristics of the VEGF-A antagonists to human VEGF-A. Epitope binning experiments were performed with soluble, native human VEGFA as the antigen.\n\n\n \nMaterials and Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nTwo separate epitope binning experiments were performed on a BIACORE T100™ system (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, N.J.). In both experiments, the primary VEGF-A antagonists were covalently immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip using amine coupling chemistry (EDC:NHS) to a density of approximately 800-1000 RU. After the immobilization procedure, remaining active sites on the flow cell were blocked with ethanolamine. Non-specifically bound protein was removed by washing with 50 mM NaOH. The reference cell was also activated and then blocked with ethanolamine without the VEGF-A antagonist.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the first set of experiments, secondary VEGF-A antagonists and the VEGF-A antigen were diluted to 100 nM. VEGF-A antigen was injected and allowed to specifically bind to a VEGF-A antagonist immobilized on the sensor chip. VEGF-A is a dimer, therefore there are two potential binding sites for every VEGF-A antagonist. To ensure all binding sites were occupied, the primary VEGF-A antagonist that was previously immobilized was injected over VEGF-A. Following this step, secondary VEGF-A antagonist was injected to observe simultaneous binding to VEGF-A.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a second set of binning experiments, primary VEGF-A antagonists were again covalently immobilized to separate flow cells of a BIACORE CM5 sensor chip. In this experiment however, 10 nM VEGF-A antigen was premixed with 1 mM of the secondary VEGF-A antagonists, then injected over the immobilized primary VEGF-A antagonist in a competition format.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll binding experiments were performed at 25° C. in a buffer of 10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA 0.05% Surfactant P20, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4. Buffer injections were also performed to allow for subtraction of instrument noise and drift. Between cycles, capture surface was regenerated after each injection cycle via 60 second injection of 10 mM Glycine, pH 1.5 at 50 ul/min. This removed the bound VEGF-A from the surface. Data was compiled using Biacore T100™ Evaluation software (version 1.1.1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBoth sets of experimental results were interpreted as follows. If the secondary VEGF-A antagonist was not capable of binding to VEGF-A antigen simultaneously with the primary antagonist, it was functionally grouped into a single family or epitope bin. However, if the secondary VEGF-A antagonist was capable of binding the antigen simultaneously with the primary antagonist by showing an increase in mass on the surface of the chip it was grouped into a separate family or epitope bin. Each VEGF-A antagonist was tested against itself as a negative control to establish the level of the background (no-binding) signal.\n\n\n \nResults\n\n\n \n \n \nThe purified VEGF-A antagonists were assigned into epitope bins using the binding data from the two set of experiments described above. The signal (RU, response units) reported by the BIACORE™ is directly correlated to the mass on the sensor chip surface. Once the level of background signal (RU) associated with the negative controls was established (the same VEGF-A antagonist used as both the primary and secondary antagonists), the binning results were reported as either positive or negative binding. Positive binding indicates that two different VEGF-A antagonists are capable of binding the antigen simultaneously. Negative binding indicates that two different VEGF-A antagonists are not capable of binding the antigen simultaneously.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe differential between positive and negative response values in these experiments was used to assign the VEGF-A antagonists into three families or epitope bins (see Table 26). The first epitope bin is represented by VEGF-A antagonist produced by clone c636. A second epitope bin is represented by VEGF-A antagonists c868, c1039, and c1081. Of note, when c636 was the first to interact with VEGF-A, both c868 and c1039 showed simultaneous binding. When either c868 or c1039 interacted with VEGF-A first, c636 did not show any binding, therefore c868 and c1039 are overlapping the c636 epitope. In addition, VEGF-A antagonist c870 overlapped bin #1 and bin #2. A third epitope bin is represented by VEGF-A antagonist c820 and the positive control VEGF-A antibody (mouse anti VEGF-A monoclonal antibody, R&D Systems). Both of these VEGF-A antagonists showed simultaneous binding in the presence of all the other VEGF-A antagonists. All of the antagonists tested in the binning experiments were shown to neutralize VEGF-A mitogenic activity to some degree.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpitope Bin Assignments for Neutralizing VEGF-A antagonists\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nVEGF-A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nEpitope Bin #\n\n\nantagonists\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBin#1:\n\n\nc636\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBin#2:\n\n\nc868, c1039, c1081\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBin#1/2:\n\n\nc870\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBin#3:\n\n\nc820, mouse mAb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 42\n\n\nMeasurement of Binding Affinities of Human VEGF-A Antagonists to VEGF-A Via Surface Plasmon Resonance (Biacore)\n\n\n \n \n \nMonovalent human VEGF-A antagonists produced by clones c868, c870 and c1039 were evaluated for their binding affinities to human VEGF-A using surface plasmon resonance.\n\n\n \nAffinity Determination\n\n\n \n \n \nKinetic rate constants and equilibrium dissociation constants were measured for the interaction of VEGF-A antagonists with the VEGF-A via surface plasmon resonance. The association rate constant (k\na \n(M\n−1\ns\n−1\n)) is a value that reflects the rate of the antigen-antagonist complex formation. The dissociation rate constant (k\nd \n(s\n−1\n)) is a value that reflects the stability of this complex. By dividing the association rate constant by the dissociation rate constant (k\na\n/k\nd\n) the equilibrium association constant (K\nA \n(M\n−1\n)) is obtained. By dividing the dissociation rate constant by the association rate constant (k\nd\n/k\na\n) the equilibrium dissociation constant (K\nD \n(M)) is obtained. This value describes the binding affinity of the interaction. Interactions with the same K\nD \ncan have widely variable association and dissociation rate constants. Consequently, measuring both the k\na \nand k\nd \nhelps to more uniquely describe the affinity of the interaction.\n\n\n \nMaterials and Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nA series of experiments were completed to measure the binding affinities of purified VEGF-A antagonists produced by clones c868, c870 and c1039. Binding kinetics and affinity studies were performed on a Biacore T100™ system (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, N.J.). Methods were programmed using Biacore T100™ Control Software, v 1.1.1. The VEGF-A antagonists were produced with His\n6\n/Myc epitope tags. Affinity analyses was performed by capturing VEGF-A antagonists using anti-His\n6\n/Myc antibodies immobilized on a CM5 chip. Anti-His\n6 \nand anti-Myc antibodies were mixed in 1:1 molar ratio and covalently immobilized to a CM5 sensor chip using amine coupling chemistry to a density of approximately 7500 RU. 10 nM of VEGF-A antagonists were injected on separate flow cells at 10 ul/min for 1 minute, followed with a 1 minute stabilization period. Serial 1:3 dilutions of VEGF-A from 33.3 nM-0.14 nM were injected over this surface and allowed to specifically bind to VEGF-A antagonist captured on the sensor chip. Duplicate injections of each VEGF-A concentration were performed with an association time of 5 minutes and dissociation time of 10 minutes. Kinetic binding studies were performed with a flow rate of 30 μL/min. All binding experiments were performed at 25° C. in a buffer of 10 mM HEPES, 500 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA 0.05% Surfactant P20, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4. Between cycles, the flow cell was washed with 50 mM H\n3\nPO\n4 \nto regenerate the surface. This wash step removed the captured VEGF-A antagonist from the immobilized antibody surface, and allowed for the subsequent binding of the next sample.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nData was compiled using Biacore T100™ Evaluation software (version 1.1.1). Data was processed by subtracting reference flow cell and blank injections. Baseline stability was assessed to ensure that the regeneration step provided a consistent binding surface throughout the sequence of injections. Duplicate injection curves were checked for reproducibility. Since VEGF-A antigen forms dimers, the resulting binding curves were globally fitted to the bivalent analyte interaction model.\n\n\n \nResults\n\n\n \n \n \nThree VEGFA antagonists were characterized for their binding affinity for VEGF-A (results summarized in Table 27). Association rate constants (k\na \n(M\n−1\ns\n−1\n)) and dissociation rate constants (k\nd \n(s\n−1\n)) were measured for these human VEGF-A antagonists.

This model measures two values for both k\na \n(k\na1 \nand k\na2\n) and for k\nd \n(k\nd1 \nand K\nd2\n). The first set of values (k\na1 \nand k\nd1\n) describes the monovalent kinetics of the interaction which are reported in Table 24. The affinity reported for these samples was derived from these values, and is designated K\nD1\n. K\nD \nand K\nA \nwere calculated from the k\na \nand k\nd \nvalues.

For orthotopic tumors, mice are terminated at the end of the study and tumor weighed to enable tumor load assessment.\n\n\n \nExample 50\n\n\nMouse Pancreatic Cancer Model for Evaluating Efficacy of Anti-PDGFRβ/Anti-VEGF-A Bispecific Antibody\n\n\n \n \n \nThe efficacy of an anti-PDGFRβ/anti-VEGF-A bispecific antibody in a mouse pancreatic cancer model is evaluated using the protocol developed by Mukherjee et al., \nJ. Immunol. \n165:3451-3460, 2000. Briefly, MUC1 transgenic (MUC1.Tg) mice are bred with oncogene-expressing mice that spontaneously develop tumors of the pancreas (ET mice) designated as MET. MUC1.Tg mice. ET mice express the first 127 aa of SV40 large T Ag under the control of the rat elastase promoter. Fifty percent of the animals develop life-threatening pancreatic tumors by about 21 wk of age. Cells are routinely tested by flow cytometry for the presence of MUC1. All mice are on the C57BL/6 background. Animals are sacrificed and characterized at 3-wk intervals from 3 to 24 wk. Mice are carefully observed for signs of ill-health, including lethargy, abdominal distention, failure to eat or drink, marked weight loss, pale feces, and hunched posture.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe entire pancreas is dissected free of fat and lymph nodes, weighed, and spread on bibulus paper for photography. Nodules are counted, and the pancreas is fixed in methacarn, processed for microscopy by conventional methods, step sectioned at 5 μm (about 10 sections per mouse pancreas), stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and examined by light microscopy. Tumors are obtained from MET mice at various time points during tumor progression, fixed in methacarn (60% methanol, 30% chloroform, 10% glacial acetic acid), embedded in paraffin, and sectioned for immunohistochemical analysis. MUC1 antibodies used are CT1, a rabbit polyclonal Ab that recognizes mouse and human cytoplasmic tail region of MUC1, HMFG-2, BC2, and SM-3, which have epitopes in the TR domain of MUC1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMice are treated with anti-PDGFRβ/anti-VEGF-A bispecific antibody beginning 3-14 days following tumor implantation, or when tumor engraftment and growth rate is established. Treatment levels of 0.5-5 mg/kg are administered on a daily basis for 5-14 days, and may be continued thereafter if no evidence of neutralizing antibody formation is seen.\n\n\n \nExample 51\n\n\nB16-F10 Melanoma Model for Evaluating In Vivo Anti-Tumor Effects of Anti-PDGFRβ/Anti-VEGF-A Bispecific Antibody\n\n\n \n \n \nMice (female, C57B16, 9 weeks old; Charles River Labs, Kingston, N.Y.) are divided into three groups. On \nday\n 0, B16-F10 melanoma cells (ATCC No. CRL-6475) are harvested from culture and injected intravenously, via the tail vein, to all mice (about 100,000 cells per mouse). Mice are then treated with the test article or associated vehicle by intraperitoneal injection of 0.1 ml of the indicated solution. Mice in the first group (n=24) are treated with vehicle (PBS pH 6.0), which is injected on \n \nday\n \n 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8. Mice in the second group (n=24) are treated with an anti-PDGFRβ/anti-VEGF-A bispecific antibody, which is injected at a dose of 75 μg on \n \nday\n \n 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8. Mice in the third group (n=12) are treated with the anti-PDGFRβ/anti-VEGF-A bispecific antibody, which is injected at a dose of 75 μg daily from \nday\n 0 through day 9. All of the mice are sacrificed on day 18, and lungs are collected for quantitation of tumor. Foci of tumor growth greater than 0.5 mm in diameter are counted on all surfaces of each lung lobe. In both groups of mice treated with anti-PDGFRβ/anti-VEGF-A bispecific antibody, the average number of tumor foci present on lungs is significantly reduced, compared to mice treated with vehicle. Mice treated more frequently (i.e. daily) have fewer tumor foci than mice treated on alternate days. These results indicate that treatment with anti-PDGFRβ/anti-VEGF-A bispecific antibody slowed the growth of the B16 melanoma tumors.\n\n\n \nExample 52\n\n\nEG.7 Thymoma Model for Evaluating In Vivo Anti-Tumor Effects of Anti-PDGFRβ/Anti-VEGF-A Bispecific Antibody\n\n\n \n \n \nMice (female, C57B16, 9 weeks old; Charles River Labs, Kingston, N.Y.) are divided into three groups. On \nday\n 0, EG.7 cells (ATCC No. CRL-2113) are harvested from culture and 1,000,000 cells are injected intraperitoneal in all mice. Mice are then treated with the test article or associated vehicle by intraperitoneal injection of 0.1 mL of the indicated solution. Mice in the first group (n=6) are treated with vehicle (PBS pH 6.0), which is injected on \n \nday\n \n 0, 2, 4, and 6. Mice in the second group (n=6) are treated with an anti-PDGFRβ/anti-VEGF-A bispecific antibody, which is injected at a dose of 10 μg on \n \nday\n \n 0, 2, 4, and 6. Mice in the third group (n=6) are treated with the anti-PDGFRβ/anti-VEGF-A bispecific antibody, which is injected at a dose of 75 μg on \n \nday\n \n 0, 2, 4, and 6. In both groups of mice treated with anti-PDGFRβ/anti-VEGF-A bispecific antibody, time of survival is significantly increased, compared to mice treated with vehicle. These results indicate that treatment with anti-PDGFRβ/anti-VEGF-A bispecific antibody slowed the growth of the EG.7 tumors.\n\n\n \nExample 53\n\n\nMouse Syngeneic Ovarian Carcinoma Model for Evaluating Efficacy of Anti-PDGFRβ/Anti-VEGF-A Bispecific Antibody\n\n\n \n \n \nThe effect of anti-PDGFRβ/anti-VEGF-A bispecific antibody is tested for efficacy in ovarian carcinoma using a mouse syngeneic model as described in Zhang et al., \nAm. J. of Pathol. \n161:2295-2309, 2002. Briefly, using retroviral transfection and fluorescence-activated cell sorting a C57BL6 murine ID8 ovarian carcinoma cell line is generated that stably overexpresses the murine VEGF\n164 \nisoform and the enhanced green fluorescence protein (GFP). The retroviral construct containing VEGF\n164 \nand GFP cDNAs was transfected into BOSC23 cells. The cells are analyzed by FACS cell sorting and GFP high positive cells are identified.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ID8 VEGF\n164\n/GFP transfected cells are cultured to subconfluence and prepared in a single-cell suspension in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and cold MATRIGEL (BD Biosciences, Bedford, Mass.). Six to eight week old femal C57BL6 mice are injected subcutaneously in the flank at 5×10\n6 \ncells or untransfected control cells. Alternatively, the mice can be injected intraperitoneally at 7×10\n6 \ncells or control cells. Animals are either followed for survival or sacrificed eight weeks after inoculation and evaluated for tumor growth. Mice are treated with an anti-PDGFRβ/anti-VEGF-A bispecific antibody beginning 3-14 days following tumor implantation, or when tumor engraftment and growth rate is established. Treatment levels of 0.5-5 mg/kg are administered on a daily basis for 5-14 days, and may be continued thereafter if no evidence of neutralizing antibody formation is seen.\n\n\n \nExample 54\n\n\nMouse RenCA Model for Evaluating Efficacy of Anti-PDGFRβ/Anti-VEGF-A Bispecific Antibody\n\n\n \n \n \nThe efficacy of an anti-PDGFRβ/anti-VEGF-A bispecific antibody in a renal cell carcinoma model is evaluated using BALB/c mice that have been injected with RENCA cells, a mouse renal adenocarcinoma of spontaneous origin, essentially as described in Wigginton et al., \nJ. Nat. Cancer Instit. \n88:38-43, 1996.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBriefly, BALB/c mice between eight and ten weeks are injected with RenCA cells R 1×10\n5 \ncells into the kidney capsule of the mice. Twelve days after tumor cell implantation, the mice are nepharectomized to remove primary tumors. The mice are allowed to recover from surgery, prior to administration of anti-PDGFRβ/anti-VEGF-A bispecific antibody. Mice are treated with anti-PDGFRβ/anti-VEGF-A bispecific antibody beginning 3-14 days following tumor implantation, or when tumor engraftment and growth rate is established. Treatment levels of 0.5-5 mg/kg will be administered on a daily basis for 5-14 days, and may be continued thereafter if no evidence of neutralizing antibody formation is seen. Alternatively, RenCA cells may be introduced by subcutaneous (5×10\n5 \ncells) or intravenous (1×10\n5 \ncells) injection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe mice are evaluated for tumor response as compared to untreated mice. Survival is compared using a Kaplan-Meier method, as well as tumor volume being evaluated.\n\n\n \nExample 55\n\n\nMurine Breast Cancer Model for Evaluating Efficacy of Anti-PDGFRβ/Anti-VEGF-A Bispecific Antibody\n\n\n \n \n \nThe efficacy of an anti-PDGFRβ/anti-VEGF-A bispecific antibody in a murine model for breast cancer is made using a syngeneic model as described in Colombo et al., \nCancer Research \n62:941-946, 2002. Briefly, TS/A cells which are a spontaneous mammary carcinoma for BALB/C mice. The cells are cultured for approximately one week to select for clones. The selected TS/A cells are grown and used to challenge CD-1 nu/nu BR mice (Charles River Laboratories) by injected 2×10\n2 \nTS/A cells subcutaneously into the flank of the mouse.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMice are treated with anti-PDGFRβ/anti-VEGF-A bispecific antibody beginning 3-14 days following tumor implantation, or when tumor engraftment and growth rate is established. Treatment levels of 0.5-5 mg/kg are administered on a daily basis for 5-14 days, and may be continued thereafter if no evidence of neutralizing antibody formation is seen. The tumors are excised after sacrificing the animals and analyzed for volume and using histochemistry and immunohistochemistry.\n\n\n \nExample 56\n\n\nTransfection and Production of CHO Pools for Protein Production\n\n\n \n \n \nPlasmid DNA was digested with a restriction enzyme, PvuI. To make a stable CHO pool expressing a BiscFv, 15 μg of digested plasmid DNA were transfected into CHO DXB-11 host cells following a standard electroporation protocol. The cells were allowed to recover in complete medium for two days in a shake flask at 37° C. Following recovery, the cells were transferred into selective medium supplemented with methotrexate. The cells were propagated every three to four days until they were at least 90% viable. To make a stable CHO pool expressing a BiAb, 15 μg of each digested plasmid DNA were co-transfected into CHO DXB-11 host cells following a standard electroporation protocol. The cells were allowed to recover in complete medium for two days in a shake flask at 37° C. Following recovery, the cells were transferred into complete medium supplemented with puromycin. The cells were propagated every three to four days until they were at least 80% viable. The cells were then transferred into selective medium supplemented with puromycin and methotrexate. The cells were propagated every three to four days until they were at least 90% viable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the transfected CHO DXB-11 cells reached a viability of at least 90%, the pool was assayed for recombinant protein production. The pool was seeded into production medium in a shake flask and incubated at 37° C. After six days, the culture was harvested and the supernatant was assayed for recombinant protein production by protein A HPLC.\n\n\n \nExample 57\n\n\nMeasurement of Binding Affinity of PDGFRβ/VEGF-A Bispecific Molecules for Human Monomeric PDGFRβ by Surface Plasma Resonance\n\n\n \n \n \nBispecific molecules were evaluated for binding affinity to human monomeric PDGFRβ. Association and dissociation constants were measured for the interaction of the bispecific molecules to PDGFRβ. The binding affinity was measured using these measured constants.\n\n\n \nMaterials and Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nBinding kinetics and affinity measurements were performed on a Biacore T-100™ system (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, N.J.). Methods were programmed using the Biacore T-100™ Control Software v1.1.1. All studies were done at 25° C. and samples stored at 8° C. in the autosampler. Goat anti-human IgG Fc-gamma specific antibody was immobilized onto a CM4 sensor chip using a mixture of 0.4 M EDC [N-ethyl-N′-(3-diethylamino-propyl)carbodiimide] and 0.1 M NHS(N-hydroxysuccinimide). The antibody was diluted in 10 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 to a concentration of 50 μg/mL. The density of immobilization was about 3400-3700 RU. After immobilization, the remaining cells were blocked with ethanolamine and non-specifically bound protein was removed by washing with 50 mM NaOH.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe PDGFRβ/VEGF-A bispecific molecules were diluted into HBS-EP buffer (10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20, 1 mg/mL BSA, pH 7.4) at 2 μg/mL. They were captured onto individual flow cells of goat anti-human IgG Fc-gamma CM4 chip at 10 μl/min. The density of immobilization was between 83-108 RU.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMonomeric PDGFRβ was injected over flow cells. Serial 1:3 dilutions of the analyte were made in HBS-EP buffer from 100 nM to 0.015 nM. Single injections of the concentration series performed from low to high concentrations, followed by replicate injection of the samples series. The analyte was injected at 30 μl/min for 9 minutes (association time). The dissociation time for each analyte injection was 15 minutes. Buffer injections were also made to subtract for instrument noise and drift.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nData analysis was performed with the Biacore T100 Evaluation software. Based on the binding of the monomeric analyte to the bivalent molecule, the 1:1 binding model was determined to be appropriate, and the resulting binding curves were fit to this model. The 1:1 binding model measures a single value for association constant (k\na\n) and dissociation constant (k\nd\n). The overall binding affinity (K\nD\n) was obtained by dividing the k\nd \nby k\na\n.\n\n\n \nResults\n\n\n \n \n \nThe kinetic constants obtained for the various bispecific molecules are summarized in Table 29. Bispecific molecules with common anti-PDGFRβ family groups showed similar binding affinities and the data fit well to the 1:1 binding model.

Quantity of bispecific molecule in serum was determined in the various samples using a qualified ELISA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecombinant human VEGF-A was immobilized on plastic (96 well flat-bottom plates). Serial dilutions of serum isolated from mice was generated and added to the wells coated with human VEGF-A (capture of bispecific molecules). A biotinylated anti-human IgG antibody was used to bind the Fc portion of the captured bispecific (in serum) followed by detection using streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase in conjunction with the substrate tetramethylbenzidine. A standard curve using fresh bispecific molecule was used to then calculate amount in serum.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe resulting concentration versus time profiles were subjected to noncompartmental PK analysis using WinNonlin 5.0.1 (Pharsight Inc, Mountain view, Calif.). Values for the area under the concentration versus time curves extrapolated to infinity (AUCINF) were calculated using the linear trapezoidal method with uniform weighting.\n\n\n \nResults\n\n\n \n \n \nBispecific molecule serum concentrations were quantifiable in all samples tested out to the last time point measured (504 hrs post dose). The analyses of these data are shown in Table 32. These results demonstrate that the c1035.1-c1039.1 biscFv and the c597.1-c1039.1 and c600.1-c1039.1 biAbs have serum half-lives in the range expected of Fc-containing classical antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPharmakoinetic Analysis of Bispecific Molecules Following Single Dose\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI.V.

For neutralizing activity against VEGF-A, the assay described in Example 11 was used (human VEGF-A induced luciferase activity in 293/VEGFR2 cells). For neutralizing activity against PDGFRβ, PDGF-BB-induced PDGFRβ phosphorylation assay described in Example 22 was used. As controls, freshly spiked bispecific molecules in 10% SCID serum was used to neutralize activity.\n\n\n \nResults\n\n\n \n \n \nAs shown in Table 33, serum from mice injected with bispecific molecules effectively neutralized human VEGF-A and PDGFRβ activity.

In addition, control spots of each test antibody and mouse and human IgG flanked top, bottom, and sides of each array.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA series of experiments were completed to determine the binding ability of scFvs c636, c870, c1039, and c868 against the synthetic linear peptides of human VEGF-A protein. The anti-human VEGF-A scFvs were labeled with His/Myc epitope tags. A solution of 10-100 μg/ml of the antibodies were applied to the peptide slides. Anti-His and/or anti-Myc antibodies were then applied to the slides. Signals were amplified with the Biotinylated Tyramide according to the method specified by the kit (Renaissance® TSA™ Biotin System, PerkinElmer, #NEL700A).

In this study, the JPT Peptide Microarray technology was used to evaluate five anti-PDGFR-β molecules: anti-PDGFRβ Fab c597, anti-PDGFRβ scFv c1035, anti-PDGFRβ scFv c941, anti-PDGFRβ IgG1 c600, PDGFRβ scFv c1232, and a mouse anti-PDGFRβ monoclonal antibody (E9899).\n\n\n \nMaterials and Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nRepliTope™ peptide microarray was prepared as a series of overlapping peptide fragments of human PDGFRβ (20 aa overlaps and 5 aa shifts). Both control spots and peptides were printed in three identical replicate arrays per slide for intra-plate reproducibility. All peptides and the control antibodies including the binding molecules are covalently attached by selective immobilization chemistry using the amino-function of the lysine-side chains. The control spots consisted of: human IgG, goat IgG, mouse IgG, c1035 scFv, c597 Fab and c941 scFv.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEpitope mapping was determined by detecting anti-PDGFRβ molecule binding to human PDGFRβ on RepliTope™ slides. As an additional control, a mouse anti-human PDGFRβ monoclonal antibody (E9899; +control) and anti-VEGF-A scFv (−control) were tested. Prior to running slides, each anti-PDGFRβ molecule was tested on a dot blot to determine approximate working concentrations of primary and secondary antibodies. Each experiment was run in duplicate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRepliTope™ slides were incubated for one hour with anti-PDGFRβ molecules diluted with PB. The His6 labeled anti-PDGFRβ molecules (c1035, c941, c597 and c1232) were stained with an anti-His6 secondary antibody as described in the method outline below. c600, an anti-PDGFRβ IgG1 was stained with a goat anti-human F(ab′)\n2 \nfragment Fcγ specific secondary antibody. E9899, a mouse monoclonal, was stained with a goat anti-mouse F(ab′)\n2 \nfragment Fcγ specific secondary.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing the biotinylated tyramide and strep-avidin incubations and subsequent TNT wash steps, the slides were developed with DAKO permanent red by incubating at RT until spots became visible but before background staining developed (1-30 min). Color development was stopped by rinsing with dH\n2\nO, Slides were dried with nitrogen and peptide spots were visualized with both a bright field and a fluorescent microscope.

After 48 hours, complete medium was removed by vacuum aspiration and replaced with 100 μl serum-free medium (DMEM, 1× Sodium Pyruvate, 1× GlutaMax (Invitrogen)) and incubated overnight. The following day, candidate VEGF-A neutralizing molecules were serially diluted from 200 nM down to 12 pM at 1:5 dilutions along with a non-neutralizer (medium only) in serum-free medium. To these, and equal volume of VEGF-A\n165 \nwas added at 0.54 nM for a final concentration of 0.26 nM VEGF-A and 100 nM to 6 pM neutralizing molecule or positive control.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese were incubated for 60 minutes at 37° C. Following incubation, medium was aspirated off the serum-starved cells and 100 μl of the above complexes were added and incubated at 37° C. for 4 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing 4 hour incubation, a luciferase assay was performed using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega, E1501) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, medium was aspirated and 25 μl 1× is Buffer (Promega, E153A) was added to each well. Plates were incubated for 20-30 minutes at RT to equilibrate. Luciferase activity was measured using a microplate luminometer (Berthold Technologies), 40 μl substrate injection, 1 second integration time. Data was analyzed using analytical software (Spotfire) and IC\n50 \nvalues were calculated for each candidate and control.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe act of VEGF-A\n165 \nbinding to its receptor, VEGFR2 (KDR/Flk-1), induces a signaling cascade that activates STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) and/or SRE (serum-response element), which drives transcription of the luciferase reporter gene. A decrease in luciferase activity indicates that this VEGF-A-mediated signaling is being neutralized.\n\n\n \nResults\n\n\n \n \n \nSignificant inhibition was demonstrated with a number of bispecifics screened (reported as IC\n50 \nvalues in Tables 37).

Since mVEGF-A\n164 \nwill cross-react to human VEGFR2, a human VEGFR2-based reporter system can be utilized. 293/KDR/KZ136/c22 cells were plated at a density of 20,000 cells per well in 100 μl complete medium (DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1× Sodium Pyruvate, 1× GlutaMax (Invitrogen)) in clear 96-well tissue culture plates and allowed to attach overnight.

Following incubation, medium was removed by vacuum aspiration and cells were gently washed with 100 μl ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Invitrogen). PBS was removed by vacuum aspiration and cells were lysed in 25 μl NP-40 lysis buffer (Invitrogen Cat.# FNN0021) containing 1 mM PMSF (Sigma, P-2714 in DMSO) and 1 Complete Mini tablet per 10 mL (Roche, 11836153001).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLysates were incubated for 20 minutes at 4° C. on a platform shaker and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min at 4° C. to clear lysates.

Lysates were thawed and mixed 1:5 with 80 μl Assay Diluent. Wells of a luminex vacuum filtration plated were pre-wetted with 200 μl Working Wash Solution. Diluted beads were added at 25 μl per well and washed 2× with 200 μl Working Wash Solution. Following washing, 50 μl of diluted lysate, and 50 μl of diluted detector antibody was added to each well and plates were covered in foil and incubated for 3 hours at room temperature (RT) on a platform shaker at 500 rpm. Following incubation, beads were washed 2× with 200 μl Working Wash Solution and then 100 μl of diluted Anti-Rabbit IgG-RPE was added to each well and plates were covered in foil and incubated for 30 minutes at RT on a platform shaker at 500 rpm. Following incubation, beads were washed 3× with 200 μl Working Wash Solution, and resuspended in 125 μl Working Wash Solution. Beads were resuspended for 30 seconds on a platform shaker at 500 rpm and read in Luminex-100 instrument (BioRad). Data was analyzed using analytical software (Spotfire) and IC\n50 \nvalues were calculated for each candidate and control.\n\n\n \nResults\n\n\n \n \n \nThe act of VEGF-A\n164 \nbinding to human receptor, VEGF-R2 (KDR/Flk-1), induces phosphorylation of the receptor. This luminex-based assay binds total VEGF-R2 to a fluorescently labeled bead conjugated to an anti-VEGFR2 antibody. A secondary antibody detecting phosphorylation at [pY1059] is used to detect how much VEGFR2 has been phosphorylated. As shown in Table 40 below, a number of scFvs that neutralized human VEGF-A activity also inhibited mouse VEGF activity in this assay.

After 24-48 hours, complete media was replaced with DMEM-F12 (1:1) media with 1× insulin-transferrin-selenium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.; serum-free media, SFM) and cells were incubated as before for an additional 18-24 hours. PDGFRβ-neutralizing molecules (scFvs, Fabs) or the control molecule murine PDGFRβ-human Fc chimera (R&D Systems, #1042-PR-100) were serially diluted 1:4 from 2000 nM to 0.02 nM in SFM. Serum-starved cells were incubated with 150 μl of SFM or the titrated anti-PDGFRβ molecules in SFM for 1 hour at 37° C. in 5% CO\n2\n. Cells were then pulsed with 50 μl 1.6 nM PDGF-BB (0.4 nM final concentration, EC\n80\n, 80% effective concentration) for 10 minutes at 37° C. in 5% CO\n2\n. Control wells without PDGF-BB stimulation were included. The cells were then washed with Bio-Plex Cell Wash Buffer and lysed in Lysis Buffer supplied in the assay kit according to the manufacturer's directions (BioRad, Hercules, Calif.), and the cell supernatants were frozen at −20° C. To thawed cell supernatants, 1× phospho-PDGFRβ beads were added and incubated at room temperature on a shaker for 18 h. Detection antibody was added to the washed beads and incubated at room temperature on a shaker for 30 minutes, and then streptavidin-PE was incubated with the beads at room temperature for 15 minutes. The beads were resuspended in Bio-Plex Resuspension Buffer and analyzed on a Bio-Plex array reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults: None of the analyzed scFvs or Fabs were neutralizing against mouse PDGFRβ.\n\n\n \nExample 69\n\n\nIdentification of Neutralizing BiscFv and BiAb Against PDGFRβ Using a PDGF-Induced Fibroblast Proliferation Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nTo screen bispecific candidate molecules (biscs, biAbs) for their ability to neutralize proliferation induced by PDGF-AB, -BB, -CC and -DD activation of the human PDGFRβ human dermal fibroblasts, a \n3\nH-thymidine assay was run.

Bispecific molecules (biscFvs, biAbs) or a control monoclonal antibody against PDGFRβ (E9899) were serially diluted 1:10 from 200 nM to 0.002 nM in SFM in the presence of a constant level of human PDGF-BB (0.2 nM, EC\n80\n, 80% effective concentration), human PDGF-AB (3 nM, EC80, R&D systems), human PDGF-CC (1 nM, EC\n80\n) or human PDGF-DD (0.2 nM, ED\n80\n). Serum-starved cells were incubated with 100 μl of SFM, PDGF ligands at EC\n80 \nin SFM, or the titrated anti-PDGFRβ molecules with PDGF ligands at EC\n80 \nin SFM.

The beads were resuspended in Bio-Plex Resuspension Buffer and analyzed on a Bio-Plex array reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories):\n\n\n \nResults\n\n\n \n \n \nBispecific antibodies showed potent PDGFRβ phosphorylation neutralization induced by PDGF-BB as shown by low nM IC\n50 \nvalues in Table 48 below.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 48\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBispecific Antibodies Neutralize PDGF-BB-induced\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPDGFRβ Phosphorylation in Cynomolgus Cells\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAntibody\n\n\nIC\n50 \n(nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nE9899 (anti-PDGFRβ)\n\n\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nc597-c868 biAb\n\n\n0.13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nc597-c870 biAb\n\n\n0.16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nc597-c1039 biAb\n\n\n0.09\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nc600-c868 biAb\n\n\n0.29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nc600-c870 biAb\n\n\n0.32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nc600-c1039 biAb\n\n\n0.22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nc1035-c868 biscFv\n\n\n0.11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nc1035-c870 biscFv\n\n\n0.14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nc1035-c1039 biscFv\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nc941-c868 biscFv\n\n\n0.03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nc941-c1039 biscFv\n\n\n0.03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNA—no activity detected\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 75\n\n\nInhibition of Endothelial and Pericyte Growth and Morphogenesis by the PDGFRβ/VEGF-A Antagonist in an In Vitro Co-culture Sprouting Assay\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n \n \n \nTo test efficacy of the PDGFRβ/VEGF-A bispecific antagonist, an in vitro co-culture system of endothelial cells and pericytes were established. In this co-culture, HUVECs coated on Cytodex beads are imbedded in fibrin gel together with human mesenchymal stem cells. The cells are grown in EGM-2 complete media conditioned by D551 human fibroblast. Either at start of the experiment (prophylactic setting) or on Day 8 of the experiment (therapeutic setting), control antagonist, PDGFRβ antagonist (anti-PDGFRβ antibody E9899), VEGF-A antagonist (Bevacizumab, Genentech) or PDGFRβ/VEGF-A bispecific antagonist of indicated concentration was added to the culture. Cultures were fixed 7 days after the addition of antagonists with PFA. Endothelial cells and pericytes were stained with anti-PECAM and anti-a-smooth muscle actin (αSMA) antibodies, respectively. In control wells, cells formed sprouts of endothelial cells protected by a covering of pericytes. Addition of VEGF-A antagonist resulted in reduced number and length of endothelial sprouts, whereas PDGFRβ antagonist had no effect on sprout length and number, but led to the dissociation of pericytes from the sprouts. The PDGFRβ/VEGF-A bispecific antagonist led to the dissociation of pericytes from endothelial sprouts as well as a reduced number and length of endothelial sprouts. The reduction in number and length of endothelial sprouts with PDGFRβ/VEGF-A bispecific antagonists was significantly greater than with VEGF-A antagonist alone.\n\n\n \nStudy Design\n\n\n \n \n \nOn Day 1, Cytodex-3 beads (GE healthcare) were coated with HUVECs (Lonza) at a ratio of 400 cells per bead and incubated overnight at 37° C., 5% CO\n2\n. On Day 2, HUVEC beads (100 beads/well) were embedded in fibrin gel along with human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC, Lonza, 30,000 cells/well) in wells of a 24-well tissue culture plate. A 1:1 mixture of fresh EGM-2 complete media (Lonza) and D551 fibroblast conditioned EGM-2 media were added to these cells along with 2 ng/mL of recombinant human HGF. Medium is replaced every two days till the end of the experiment. Antagonists were added to the culture on Day 2 (from start of the co-culture, prophylactic setting) or on Day 8 (after EC sprouts and pericyte covering are formed, therapeutic setting). 7 days after addition of antagonists, cells were fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4° C. Cells were stained with anti-PECAM or anti-SMA antibodies followed by secondary antibody (fluorescent conjugated). Cells were then viewed by an inverted fluorescence microscope and 6× images were captured. A representative set of 10 beads/well for each condition were chosen randomly. The total length of all the sprouts around a bead was measured in MetaMorph (version 7.1.6.0) by utilizing the angiogenesis tube formation application. Parameters were as follows: approximate min width 1 pixel, approximate max width 40 pixels, intensity above local background: 40 graylevels (prophylactic setting) or 100 graylevels (therapeutic setting).\n\n\n \nResults\n\n\n \n \n \nThe effect of PDGFRβ/VEGF-A bispecific antagonists on endothelial sprouts are summarized in FIGS. \n3\n and \n4\nA-\n4\nD. In wells with control antagonist treatment, cells formed sprouts of endothelial cells protected by a covering of pericytes. In the prophylactic setting, VEGF-A antagonist alone, PDGFRβ/VEGF-A bispecific molecules (c1035/c868 biscFv, c1035/c1039 biscFv, c597/c1039 biAb, and c600/c1039 biAb), and the combination of VEGF-A and PDGFRβ antagonists each inhibited endothelial sprouts compared to control. (See \nFIG. 3\n.) Inhibition of endothelial sprouts with PDGFRβ/VEGF-A bispecific molecules or the combination of VEGF-A and PDGFRβ, antagonists was significantly greater than with VEGF-A antagonist alone. (See id.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the therapeutic setting, VEGF-A antagonist alone and each of the PDGFRβ/VEGF-A bispecific molecules—c1035/c868 biscFv (\nFIG. 4A\n), c1035/c1039 biscFv (\nFIG. 4B\n), c597/c1039 biAb (\nFIG. 4C\n), and c600/c1039 biAb (FIG. \n4\nD)—inhibited endothelial sprouting compared to control. (The combination of VEGF-A and PDGFRβ antagonist was not tested in the therapeutic setting.) Inhibition of endothelial sprouts with PDGFRβ/VEGF-A bispecific molecules was significantly greater than with VEGF-A antagonist alone. (See \nFIGS. 4A-4D\n.)\n\n\n \nExample 76\n\n\nImmunofluorescence-Based Internalization Assay for Measuring the Effect of PDGFRβ/VEGFA Antagonists on Receptor Internalization\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n \n \n \nAntibodies and antibody-like molecules, when bound to cell-surface receptor, could mediate internalization of the receptor. PDGF-BB induces activation and internalization of the PDGFRβ. Similarly, antibodies to PDGFRβ have been shown to mediate internalization and this process contributes partially to the antagonist activity of the antibody. The ability of two PDGFRβ/VEGF-A bispecific antibodies—c1035/c1039 biscFv and c1035/c868 biscFv—to be internalized when bound to primary human pericytes was tested. Whether pre-bound human VEGF-A to one arm of the bispecific antibody would inhibit internalization mediated by the antagonist was also tested.\n\n\n \nMaterial and Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nLow passage Human Brain Vascular Pericytes (HBVP) (ScienCell Research, San Diego, Calif.) were plated at sub-confluency on 4 chamber glass Lab-TekII chamber slides (catalog #154917 Nalge Nunc, Naperville, Ill.) at volume of 500 μl/chamber in complete media (ScienCell Pericyte Media (PM) plus ScienCell supplements Fetal Bovine Serum, Pericyte Growth Supplement, and Penicillin-Streptomycin). Chamber slides were incubated at 37° C. and 5% CO\n2 \nfor 1-2 days until they reach approximately 75% confluency. The binding of PDGFRβ/VEGFA antibodies and control antibody were done at 4° C., so all slides are placed on ice and washed one time with cold DMEM+0.1% BSA. The PDGFRβ/VEGFA antibodies and test antibody were then diluted to 1 mg/ml in binding buffer consisting of DMEM+3% BSA and Hepes buffer. Each slide is configured so that two antibodies, one control antibody and one control well for secondary antibody only are designated for each chamber slide. 500 μl/well of antagonists, control, or media only is added to each chamber slide. Following a one hour incubation, the TO slide was fixed by washing with cold PBS one time and adding 1 ml/well paraformaldehyde solution. This TO slide measures receptor expression on the cell surface and the slides incubated at 37° C. measure receptor internalization over time. The remaining slides were put in the 37° C. incubator and removed and fixed in a similar fashion at thirty minutes, ninety minutes, four hour, and six hour time points. All slides were kept on ice after fixation. Once all of the slides were fixed, they were washed one time with PBS and permeabilized for two minutes with −20° C. MetOH. The slides were washed again with cold PBS. From this point forward, the staining was done at room temperature. The slides were incubated at room temperature for five minutes in 50 mM Glycine made up in PBS. The glycine was removed and washed off with PBS, and the slides were blocked in 10% normal goat serum in PBS (#S-1000, Vector Labs, Inc. Burlingame, Calif.), 500 μl/well for thirty minutes. Following the blocking step, 500 μl/well of the secondary antibodies was added to every well. \nAlexafluor\n 488 goat anti-mouse (Cat. # A11029, Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg.), or \nAlexafluor\n 488 goat anti-human (Cat. # A11013, Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg.) was diluted 1:150 in wash buffer consisting of PBS+0.1% Tween 20 and 0.1% BSA. The slides were incubated in the dark at room temperature for forty-five minutes. Each slide was washed three times by soaking in PBS for 5 minutes at room temperature. One drop of Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI stain was added to each chamber (Cat. # H-1200, Vector Labs, Inc., Burlingame Calif.), and the slides were cover-slipped and examined under the fluorescent microscope. Metavue software was used to visualize the two-color staining profile.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some experiments, the PDGFRβ/VEGF-A bispecific antibodies were preincubated with 5 nM human VEGF-A before addition to the cells. Internalization was followed as described above.\n\n\n \nResults\n\n\n \n \n \nThe c1035/c1039 and c1035/c868 bispecific antibodies were internalized efficiently as seen by the punctate staining inside the cells after incubation at 37° C. Preincubation with VEGF-A did not affect internalization of these bispecific molecules.\n\n\n \nExample 77\n\n\nFcRn Binding Assay for Measuring Binding of PDGFRβ/VEGF-A Antagonists to FcRn at pH 6.0 and pH 7.4\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n \n \n \nFcRn (neonatal receptor) is a key receptor that binds to the Fc-region of IgG. This binding induces internalization into the cells and these IgGs are then “recycled” into circulation. This is the key reason why IgGs have long half-life in serum. The ability of PDGFRβ/VEGF-A bispecific antibodies to bind FcRn in vitro at pH6.0 and release at pH7.4, as is seen in a physiological setting, was tested.\n\n\n \nMaterials and Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nTwo plates were set up with PDGFRβ/VEGFA antibodies and control antibodies: one to wash at pH 6.0 and one to wash at pH 7.4. Day 1: Two Nunc Maxisorp 96 well elisa plates (cat. #44-2404) were coated with 300 ng/well NeutrAvidin (Pierce Chemical Co. cat. #31000) made up in 100 mM NaHCO\n3\n, pH 9.3. Plates were incubated at 4° C. overnight. Day 2: The plates were washed 5 times with 0.1% Tween-20/PBS (PBST). The plates were then blocked with 250 μl/well of blocking buffer containing 0.8% NaCl, 0.02% KCl, 0.102% Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 0.02% KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 1% BSA, 0.05% Polysorbate, 0.05% Proclin 300 pH 7.2, for one hour at room temperature. The plates were then washed 2 times with PBST. Each well was then coated with 150 ng of biotinylated single chain FcRn (scFcRn) protein (amino acid residue 21-409 of SEQ ID NO:644) diluted in PBST+1% BSA. Plates were incubated at room temperature for one hour. PDGFRβ/VEGFA antibodies and control antibodies (Herceptin, for example) were diluted in 100 mM NaPO\n4\n, 0.05% Tween 20 (v/v), +0.1% BSA adjusted to pH 6.0 (pH 6.0 buffer) at concentrations ranging from 150 nM to 0.07 nM. Samples were tested in duplicate at a volume of 50 Owen of each concentration. pH 6.0 buffer only was run as a control to determine the background levels on each plate. Plates were incubated at room temperature for two hours. After the binding step, each plate was washed in separate buffers: one plate was washed with 250 μl/well of pH 6.0 buffer, and one plate was washed with 250 μl/well of 100 mM NaPO\n4\n, 0.05% Tween 20 (v/v), 0.1% BSA adjusted to pH 7.4 (pH 7.4 buffer). Plates were incubated in wash buffers at room temperature for a total of one hour with a wash step performed every twenty minutes. Following the wash steps, the bound antibody was detected with 100 μl/well of HRP goat anti-human IgG F(ab)\n2 \nfragment Fc gamma specific secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Cat. #109-036-098). The secondary antibody was diluted 1:5,000 in the pH 6.0 buffer, and the incubation is done for one hour at room temperature. Plates were then washed 5 times with PBST. Finally, 100 μl of TMB (TMBW-1000-01, BioFX Laboratories) was added to each well, and the plates were developed at room temperature for approximately three minutes. At this point, 100 μl/well of stop buffer (STPR-100-01, BioFX Laboratories) was added to quench the reaction. The plates were read on a spectrophotometer at a wave length of 450/570 nm. OD values were examined to compare binding patterns at pH 6.0 and release patterns at pH 7.4.\n\n\n \nResults\n\n\n \n \n \nAll the bispecific molecules tested (c1035/c1039 biscFv, c1035/c868 biscFv, c1035/c870 biscFv, c597/c1039 biAb, c597/c868 biAb, c597/c870 biAb, c600/c1039 biAb, c600/c870 biAb, c600/c868 biAb) bound FcRn well at pH6.0 and showed less binding (release) at pH7.4. The curves obtained were similar to that seen with the anti-VEGF-A antibody bevacizumab (Avastin®). These data show that the bispecific molecules bind to FcRn as expected for IgG-containing proteins and would be expected to have good half-lives in serum.\n\n\n \nExample 78\n\n\nInhibition of Human Glioblatoma Cells In Vivo Using Anti-PDGFRβ/Anti-VEGF-A Bispecific Antibody\n\n\n \n \n \nTo evaluate anti-tumor activity of an anti-PDGFRβ/anti-VEGF-A bispecific antibody against human glioblastoma cells in vivo, groups of BALB/c nude mice or C.B-17 SCID are injected with either U118, U251 or U87-MG glioblastoma cells on \nDay\n 0. Groups (n=10/group) of tumor bearing mice receive 5-75 μg human anti-PDGFRβ/anti-VEGF-A bispecific antibody by i.p. or peritumoral injection every other day (EOD) from Days 5-33. Tumor volume is monitored 3×/week for 6 weeks. Inhibition of tumor growth (volume or weight) by anti-PDGFRβ/anti-VEGF-A bispecific antibody suggests that the respective protein has inhibitory effects on human glioblastoma cells in vivo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStudy design: Eight-week old female BALB/c nude or C.B-17 SCID mice (Charles River Laboratories) are injected s.c. on the right flank or orthotopically into the cranial wall with 6×106 U118, U251 or U87-MG cells on \nDay\n 0. Groups of mice (n=10/group) are injected i.p. or peritumorally (for s.c model only) with 5-75 μg human an anti-PDGFRβ/anti-VEGF-A bispecific antibody from days 5-33 or when tumors reach a volume of 200 mm\n3\n. Injections are given in a total volume of 200 μl. For s.c tumors, tumor growth is monitored 3×/week for 6 weeks using caliper measurements. Tumor volume is calculated using the formula ½*(B)2*L (mm\n3\n). For orthotopic tumors, mice are terminated at the end of the study and tumor weighed to enable tumor load assessment.\n\n\n \nExample 79\n\n\nProphylactic Treatment with PDGFRβ/VEGF-A Bispecific Antibodies Inhibits Growth of A673 Rhabdomyosarcoma Cells in SCID Mice\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n \n \n \nTo test if the PDGFRβ/VEGF-A bispecific antagonist has activity on tumor growth in mice, groups of mice were injected s.c with the A673 rhabdomyosarcoma tumor on \nDay\n 0. Groups of mice (n=10/gp) mice were then injected with 0.01 mg/Kg to 10 mg/Kg control reagent, VEGF-A antagonist, PDGFRβ antagonist or PDGFRβ/VEGF-A antagonist 2×/week for 4 weeks, starting one day after tumor inoculation. Tumor volume was monitored 3×/week for 4 weeks. Significantly smaller tumors in mice injected with a VEGF-A antagonist, or PDGFRβ/VEGF-A antagonist, as compared to mice injected with control reagent, indicated efficacy of the antagonist for inhibition of tumor growth. Because the anti-PDGFRβ arm of each tested PDGFRβ/VEGF-A antagonist does not cross-react with murine PDGFRβ, this model only tests for VEGF-targeted efficacy.\n\n\n \nStudy Design\n\n\n \n \n \nEight to ten-week old female C.B-17 SCID mice (Charles River Laboratories) were injected s.c. on the right flank with 2×10\n6 \nA673 cells on Day O, Starting on Day 1, groups of mice (n=10/group) were injected i.p. with concentrations between 0.01 mg/Kg to 10 mg/Kg control reagent, VEGF-A antagonist, PDGFRβ antagonist, or PDGFRβ/VEGF-A antagonist 2×/week for 4 weeks. Tumor growth was monitored 3×/week for 4 weeks using caliper measurements. Tumor volume was calculated using the formula ½*(B)2*L (mm\n3\n).

When tumors reached a size of 200 mm\n3\n, groups of mice (n=10/gp) mice were then injected with 5 mg/Kg control reagent, VEGF-A antagonist, or PDGFRβ/VEGF-A antagonist 2×/week for a total of 5 doses. Tumor volume was monitored 3×/week. Significantly smaller tumors in mice injected with a VEGF-A antagonist, or PDGFRβ/VEGF-A antagonist, as compared to mice injected with control reagent, indicated efficacy of the antagonist for inhibition of tumor growth. Because the anti-PDGFRβ arm of each tested PDGFRβ/VEGF-A antagonist does not cross-react with murine PDGFRβ, this model only tests for VEGF-targeted efficacy.\n\n\n \nStudy Design\n\n\n \n \n \nEight to ten-week old female C.B-17 SCID mice (Charles River Laboratories) were injected s.c. on the right flank with 2×10\n6 \nA673 cells on \nDay\n 0. When tumors reached a size of 200 mm\n3\n, groups of mice (n=10/group) were injected i.p. with 5 mg/Kg control reagent, VEGF-A antagonist, or PDGFRβ/VEGF-A antagonist 2×/week for 5 doses. Tumor growth was monitored 3×/week using caliper measurements. Tumor volume was calculated using the formula 1/2*(B)2*L (mm\n3\n). At the end of the study (24 hrs after last dose), mice were terminated and tumors weighed.\n\n\n \nResults\n\n\n \n \n \nAs shown below in Table 52, bispecific antibodies significantly inhibited tumor growth compared to vehicle treated mice.

The assay detects the amount of phosphorylated PDGFRβ that is present in cell lysates. Human PDGFRβ-transfected BHK 570 E10.2 B3 cells were seeded in 96 well flat bottom plates (Falcon, Colorado Springs, Colo.) at a density of 7,500 cells per well in a volume of 100 μl in complete media at 37° C. and 5% CO\n2\n. The next day, media was removed from cells and serially diluted bispecific molecules (BiscFv and BiAb) and control monoclonal antibody to PDGFRβ (E9899) were added in serum-free assay media in a volume of 50 μl and incubated for 60 minutes at 37° C. and 5% CO\n2\n. Human PDGF-BB (0.2 nM, EC\n80\n, 80% effective concentration), human PDGF-AB (3 nM, EC\n80\n, R&D systems), human PDGF-CC (1 nM, EC\n80\n) or human PDGF-DD (0.2 nM, ED\n80\n) were added to cells in a volume of 50 μL and incubated for 10 minutes at 37° C. and 5% CO\n2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cells were then washed with Bio-Plex Cell Wash Buffer, lysed with lysing solution according to the manufacturer's directions (BioRad, Hercules, Calif.), and the cell supernatants were frozen at −20° C. To thawed cell supernatants, 1× phospho-PDGFRB beads were added and incubated at room temperature on a shaker for 18 h. Detection antibodies were added to the washed beads and incubated at room temperature on a shaker for 30 minutes, and then streptavidin-PE was incubated with the beads at room temperature for 15 minutes. The beads were resuspended in Bio-Plex Resuspension Buffer and analyzed on a Bio-Plex array reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories).\n\n\n \nResults\n\n\n \n \n \nBiscFvs and BiAbs showed potent PDGFR phosphorylation neutralization induced by various PDGF ligands as shown by low nM IC\n50 \nvalues in the tables below. These data suggest that the BiscFvs and BiAbs neutralize activity mediated through PDGFRβ/β homodimer and also due to PDGFRα/β heterodimer as these BHK cells express residual levels of bovine PDGFRα.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 53\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeutralization of PDGF-ligand-induced PDGFRβ phsophorylation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nby BiscFvs and BiAbs (IC50 - nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMolecules\n\n\nPDGF-AB\n\n\nPDGF-BB\n\n\nPDGF-CC\n\n\nPDGF-DD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE9899\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n0.05\n\n\n\n\n\n\nc1035/c1039\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n0.01\n\n\n\n\n\n\nc1035/c868\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n0.3\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n0.003\n\n\n\n\n\n\nc597/c1039\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n0.007\n\n\n\n\n\n\nc600/c1039\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n0.6\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFrom the foregoing, it will be appreciated that, although specific embodiments of the invention have been described herein for purposes of illustration, various modifications may be made without deviating from the spirit and scope of the invention.

(Not Yet Assigned), (Not Yet Assigned) and (Not Yet Assigned), all bearing the same title as the present application and filed on May 25, 2007, and Ser. No. (Not Yet Assigned) likewise bearing the same title as that of the present application and filed May 29, 2007; and the disclosures of all such applications are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties. Applicants claim the benefits of such applications under 35 U.S.C. §119(e).\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to a class of triazolopyrazine compounds capable of binding to the active site of a serine/threonine kinase, the expression of which is involved in the pathway resulting in the degradation of extra-cellular matrix (ECM), joint degeneration and diseases involving such degradation and/or inflammation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiseases involving the degradation of extra-cellular matrix include, but are not limited to, psoriatic arthritis, juvenile arthritis, early arthritis, reactive arthritis, osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, osteoporosis, muskulo skeletal diseases like tendonitis and periodontal disease, cancer metastasis, airway diseases (COPD, asthma), renal and liver fibrosis, cardiovascular diseases like atherosclerosis and heart failure, and neurological diseases like neuroinflammation and multiple sclerosis. Diseases involving primarily joint degeneration include, but are not limited to, psoriatic arthritis, juvenile arthritis, early arthritis, reactive arthritis, osteoarthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic joint degenerative disease, characterized by inflammation and destruction of the joint structures. When the disease is unchecked, it leads to substantial disability and pain due to loss of joint functionality and even premature death. The aim of an RA therapy, therefore, is not to slow down the disease but to attain remission in order to stop the joint destruction. Besides the severity of the disease outcome, the high prevalence of RA (˜0.8% of adults are affected worldwide) means a high socioeconomic impact. (For reviews on RA, we refer to Smolen and Steiner (2003); Lee and Weinblatt (2001); Choy and Panayi (2001); O'Dell (2004) and Firestein (2003)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough it is widely accepted that RA is an auto-immune disease, there is no consensus concerning the precise mechanisms driving the ‘initiation stage’ of the disease. What is known is that the initial trigger(s) does mediate, in a predisposed host, a cascade of events that leads to the activation of various cell types (B-cells, T-cells, macrophages, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, dendritic cells and others). Concomitantly, an increased production of various cytokines is observed in the joints and tissues surrounding the joint (e.g. TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1, IL-15, IL-18 and others). When the disease progresses, the cellular activation and cytokine production cascade becomes self-perpetuating. At this early stage, the destruction of joint structures is already very clear at this early stage. Thirty percent of the patients have radiographic evidence of bony erosions at the time of diagnosis and this proportion increases to 60 percent after two years.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHistological analysis of the joints of RA patients clearly evidences the mechanisms involved in the RA-associated degradative processes. This analysis shows that the main effector responsible for RA-associated joint degradation is the pannus, where the synovial fibroblast, by producing diverse proteolytic enzymes, is the prime driver of cartilage and bone erosion. A joint classically contains two adjacent bones that articulate on a cartilage layer and are surrounded by the synovial membrane and joint capsule. In the advanced RA patient, the synovium of joint increases in size to form the pannus, due to the proliferation of the synovial fibroblasts and the infiltration of mononuclear cells such as T-cells, B-cells, monocytes, macrophages and neutrophils. The pannus mediates the degradation of the adjacent cartilage, leading to the narrowing of the joint space, and has the potential to invade adjacent bone and cartilage. As bone and cartilage tissues are composed mainly of collagen type I or II, respectively, the pannus destructive and invasive properties are mediated by the secretion of collagenolytic proteases, principally the matrix metallo proteinases (MMPs). The erosion of the bone under and adjacent to the cartilage is also part of the RA process, and results principally from the presence of osteoclasts at the interface of bone and pannus. Osteoclasts are multinucleated cells that, upon adhesion to the bone tissue, form a closed compartment, within which the osteoclasts secrete proteases (Cathepsin K, MMP9) that degrade the bone tissue. The osteoclast population in the joint is abnormally increased by osteoblast formation from precursor cells induced by the secretion of the receptor activator of NFκB ligand (RANKL) by activated SFs and T-cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious collagen types have a key role in defining the stability of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Collagens type I and collagen type II, for example, are the main components of bone and cartilage, respectively. Collagen proteins typically organise into multimeric structures referred to as collagen fibrils. Native collagen fibrils are very resistant to proteolytic cleavage. Only a few types of ECM-degrading proteins have been reported to have the capacity to degrade native collagen: MMPs and Cathepsins. Among the Cathepsins, cathepsin K, which is active mainly in osteoclasts, is the best characterised. Among the MMPs, MMP1, MMP2, MMP8 MMP13 and MMP14 are known to have collagenolytic properties. The correlation between an increased expression of MMP1 by synovial fibroblasts (SFs) and the progression of the arthritic disease is well-established and is predictive for joint erosive processes (Cunnane et al., 2001). In the context of RA, therefore, MMP1 represents a highly relevant collagen degrading protein. In vitro, the treatment of cultured SFs with cytokines relevant in the RA pathology (e.g. TNF-α and IL1β) will increase the expression of MMP1 by these cells (Andreakos et al., 2003). Monitoring the levels of MMP1 expressed by SFs therefore is a relevant readout in the field of RA as it is indicative for the activation of SFs towards an erosive phenotype that, in vivo, is responsible for cartilage degradation. Inhibition of the MMP1 expression by SFs represents a valuable therapeutic approach towards the treatment of RA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe activity of the ECM-degrading proteins can also be causative or correlate with the progression of various diseases different from RA, as e.g. other diseases that involve the degradation of the joints. These diseases include, but are not limited to, psoriatic arthritis, juvenile arthritis, early arthritis, reactive arthritis, osteoarthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. Other diseases that may be treatable with compounds identified according to the present invention and using the targets involved in the expression of MMPs as described herein are osteoporosis, muscular skeletal diseases like tendonitis and periodontal disease (Gapski et al., 2004), cancer metastasis (Coussens et al., 2002), airway diseases (COPD, asthma) (Suzuki et al., 2004), lung, renal fibrosis (Schanstra et al., 2002), liver fibrosis associated with chronic hepatitis C (Reiff et al., 2005), cardio-vascular diseases like atherosclerosis and heart failure (Creemers et al., 2001), and neurological diseases like neuroinflammation and multiple sclerosis (Rosenberg, 2002). Patients suffering from such diseases may benefit from stabilizing the ECM (by protecting it from degradation).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe 471-amino acid serine/threonine kinase identified as Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase-Activated Protein Kinase 5 (MAPKAPK5 or PRAK) is expressed in a wide panel of tissues. The protein contains its catalytic domain at the N-terminal end and both a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and nuclear export signal (NES) at its C-terminal end. Endogenous MAPKAPK5 is predominantly present in the cytoplasm, but stress or cytokine activation of the cells mediates its translocation into the nucleus (New et al., 2003). This event is dependent on phosphorylation of MAPKAPK5. Thr182 is the regulatory phosphorylation site of MAPKAPK5. Although the p38α kinase is able to phosphorylate MAPKAPK5 in an overexpression setting, experiments with endogenous MAPKAPK5 do not support this hypothesis (Shi et al., 2003). MAPKAPK5 knock-out mice have been generated that are viable and fertile. The phenotype of these mice is quite different from that of mice deficient for MAPKAPK2, a MAPKAPK5 related kinase that is regulated by p38α (Shi et al., 2003). This indicates that the function of each protein is distinct and that neither kinase can compensate for the other's activity. Taken together, MAPKAPK5 and MAPKAPK2 represent distinct targets with a non-redundant role. MAPK6 (also referred to as ERK3) has recently been identified as a physiologically relevant substrate for MAPKAPK5, defining a novel signal transduction pathway (Seternes et al., 2004).\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nNSAIDS (Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) are used to reduce the pain associated with RA and improve life quality of the patients. These drugs will not, however, put a brake on the RA-associated joint destruction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCorticosteroids were found to decrease the progression of RA as detected radiographically and are used at low doses to treat part of the RA patients (30 to 60%). Serious side effects, however, are associated with long corticosteroid use (Skin thinning, osteoporosis, cataracts, hypertension, hyperlipidemia).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSynthetic DMARDs (Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs) (e.g. methotrexate, leflunomide, sulfasalazine) mainly tackle the immuno-inflammatory component of RA. As a main disadvantage, these drugs only have a limited efficacy (joint destruction is only slowed down but not blocked by DMARDs such that disease progression in the long term continues). The lack of efficacy is indicated by the fact that, on average, only 30% of the patients achieve an ACR40 score after 24 months treatment with methotrexate. This means that, according to the American College of Rheumatology, only 30% of the patients do achieve a 50% improvement of their symptoms (O'Dell et al., 1996). In addition, the precise mechanism of action of DMARDs is often unclear.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBiological DMARDs (Infliximab, Etanercept, Adalimumab, Rituximab, CTLA4-Ig) are therapeutic proteins that do inactivate cytokines (e.g. TNF-α) or cells (e.g. T-cells or B-cells) that have an important role in the RA pathophysiology (Kremer et al., 2003; Edwards et al., 2004). Although the TNF-α-blockers (Infliximab, Etanercept, Adalimumab) and methotrexate combination therapy is the most effective RA treatment currently available, it is striking that even this therapy only achieves a 50% improvement (ACR40) in disease symptoms in 50-60% of patients after 12 months therapy (St Clair et al., 2004). Some adverse events warnings for anti-TNF-α drugs exist, shedding a light on the side effects associated to this type of drugs. Increased risk for infections (tuberculosis) hematologic events and demyelinating disorders have been described for the TNF-α blockers (see also Gomez-Reino et al., 2003). Besides the serious side effects, the TNF-α blockers do also share the general disadvantages of the biological class of therapeutics, which are the unpleasant way of administration (frequent injections accompanied by infusion site reactions) and the high production cost. Newer agents in late development phase target T-cell co-stimulatory molecules and B-cells. The efficacy of these agents is expected to be similar to that of the TNF-α blockers. The fact that a variety of targeted therapies have similar but limited efficacies, suggests that there is a multiplicity of pathogenic factors for RA. This is also indicative for the deficiencies in our understanding of pathogenic events relevant to RA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe current therapies for RA are not satisfactory due to a limited efficacy (No adequate therapy exists for 30% of the patients). This calls for additional strategies to achieve remission. Remission is required since residual disease bears the risk of progressive joint damage and thus progressive disability. Inhibiting the immuno-inflammatory component of the RA disease, which represents the main target of drugs currently used for RA treatment, does not result in a blockade of joint degradation, the major hallmark of the disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUS 2005/0009832 describes substituted [1.2.4]triazolo[1,2-a]pyrazine-8-yl-amines as modulators of protein kinases, including MAPKAPK5.

Particular heteroaryl groups are those derived from thiophene, pyrrole, benzothiophene, benzofuran, indole, pyridine, quinoline, imidazole, oxazole and pyrazine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of representative heteroaryls include the following:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein each Y is selected from carbonyl, N, NR\n58\n, O, and S; and R\n58 \nis independently hydrogen, alkyl, cycloalkyl, cycloheteroalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, heteroalkyl or the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “cycloheteroalkyl” refers to a stable heterocyclic non-aromatic ring and fused rings containing one or more heteroatoms independently selected from N, O and S. A fused heterocyclic ring system may include carbocyclic rings and need only include one heterocyclic ring. Examples of heterocyclic rings include, but are not limited to, piperazinyl, homopiperazinyl, piperidinyl and morpholinyl, and are shown in the following illustrative examples:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein each X is selected from CR\n58\n \n2\n, NR\n58\n, O and S; and each Y is selected from NR\n58\n, O and S; and R\n58 \nis independently hydrogen, alkyl, cycloalkyl, cycloheteroalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, heteroalkyl or the like. These cycloheteroalkyl rings may be optionally substituted with one or more groups selected from the group consisting of acyl, acylamino, acyloxy, alkoxy, substituted alkoxy, alkoxycarbonyl, alkoxycarbonylamino, amino, substituted amino, aminocarbonyl, aminocarbonylamino, aminocarbonyloxy, aryl, aryloxy, azido, carboxyl, cyano, cycloalkyl, substituted cycloalkyl, halogen, hydroxyl, keto, nitro, thioalkoxy, substituted thioalkoxy, thioaryloxy, thioketo, thiol, alkyl-S(O)—, aryl-S(O)—, alkyl-S(O)\n2\n— and aryl-S(O)\n2\n—.

In general, a heterocyclic ring may have one to four heteroatoms so long as the heteroaromatic ring is chemically feasible and stable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Pharmaceutically acceptable” means approved by a regulatory agency of the Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopoeia or other generally recognized pharmacopoeia for use in animals, and more particularly in humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Pharmaceutically acceptable salt” refers to the non-toxic, inorganic and organic acid addition salts, and base addition salts, of compounds of the present invention, in particular they are pharmaceutically acceptable and possess the desired pharmacological activity of the parent compound. These salts can be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of compounds useful in the present invention. Such salts include: (1) acid addition salts, formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like; or formed with organic acids such as acetic acid, propionic acid, hexanoic acid, cyclopentanepropionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, lactic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, malic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, 3-(4-hydroxybenzoyl)benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, 1,2-ethane-disulfonic acid, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, 4-chlorobenzenesulfonic acid, 2-naphthalenesulfonic acid, 4-toluenesulfonic acid, camphorsulfonic acid, 4-methylbicyclo[2.2.2]-oct-2-ene-1-carboxylic acid, glucoheptonic acid, 3-phenylpropionic acid, trimethylacetic acid, tertiary butylacetic acid, lauryl sulfuric acid, gluconic acid, glutamic acid, hydroxynaphthoic acid, salicylic acid, stearic acid, muconic acid, and the like; or (2) salts formed when an acidic proton present in the parent compound either is replaced by a metal ion, e.g., an alkali metal ion, an alkaline earth ion, or an aluminum ion; or coordinates with an organic base such as ethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, N-methylglucamine and the like. Salts further include, by way of example only, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, ammonium, tetraalkylammonium, and the like; and when the compound contains a basic functionality, salts of non toxic organic or inorganic acids, such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, tartrate, mesylate, acetate, maleate, oxalate and the like. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable cation” refers to a non toxic, acceptable cationic counter-ion of an acidic functional group. Such cations are exemplified by sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, ammonium, tetraalkylammonium cations, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle” refers to a diluent, adjuvant, excipient or carrier with which a compound of the invention is administered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Preventing” or “prevention” refers to a reduction in risk of acquiring a disease or disorder (i.e., causing at least one of the clinical symptoms of the disease not to develop in a subject that may be exposed to or predisposed to the disease but does not yet experience or display symptoms of the disease).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Prodrugs” refers to compounds, including derivatives of the compounds of the invention, which have cleavable groups and become by solvolysis or under physiological conditions the compounds of the invention which are pharmaceutically active in vivo. Such examples include, but are not limited to, choline ester derivatives and the like, N-alkylmorpholine esters and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Subject” includes humans. The terms “human,” “patient” and “subject” are used interchangeably herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Treating” or “treatment” of any disease or disorder refers, in one embodiment, to ameliorating the disease or disorder (i.e., arresting or reducing the development of the disease or at least one of the clinical symptoms thereof). In another embodiment “treating” or “treatment” refers to ameliorating at least one physical parameter, which may not be discernible by the subject. In yet another embodiment, “treating” or “treatment” refers to modulating the disease or disorder, either physically, (e.g., stabilization of a discernible symptom), physiologically, (e.g., stabilization of a physical parameter), or both. In yet another embodiment, “treating” or “treatment” refers to delaying the onset of the disease or disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther derivatives of the compounds of this invention have activity in both their acid and acid derivative forms, but in the acid sensitive form often offers advantages of solubility, tissue compatibility, or delayed release in the mammalian organism (see, Bundgard, H., Design of Prodrugs, pp. 7-9, 21-24, Elsevier, Amsterdam 1985). Prodrugs include acid derivatives well know to practitioners of the art, such as, for example, esters prepared by reaction of the parent acid with a suitable alcohol, or amides prepared by reaction of the parent acid compound with a substituted or unsubstituted amine, or acid anhydrides, or mixed anhydrides. Simple aliphatic or aromatic esters, amides and anhydrides derived from acidic groups pendant on the compounds of this invention are preferred prodrugs. In some cases it is desirable to prepare double ester type prodrugs such as (acyloxy)alkyl esters or ((alkoxycarbonyl)oxy)alkylesters. Preferred are the C\n1 \nto C\n8 \nalkyl, C\n2\n-C\n8 \nalkenyl, aryl, C\n7\n-C\n12 \nsubstituted aryl, and C\n7\n-C\n12 \narylalkyl esters of the compounds of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “isotopic variant” refers to a compound that contains unnatural proportions of isotopes at one or more of the atoms that constitute such compound. For example, an “isotopic variant” of a compound can contain one or more non-radioactive isotopes, such as for example, deuterium (\n2\nH or D), carbon-13 (\n13\nC), nitrogen-15 (\n15\nN), or the like. It will be understood that, in a compound where such isotopic substitution is made, the following atoms, where present, may vary, so that for example, any hydrogen may be \n2\nH/D, any carbon may be \n13\nC, or any nitrogen may be \n15\nN, and that the presence and placement of such atoms may be determined within the skill of the art. Likewise, the invention may include the preparation of isotopic variants with radioisotopes, in the instance for example, where the resulting compounds may be used for drug and/or substrate tissue distribution studies. The radioactive isotopes tritium, i.e. \n3\nH, and carbon-14, i.e. \n14\nC, are particularly useful for this purpose in view of their ease of incorporation and ready means of detection. Further, compounds may be prepared that are substituted with positron emitting isotopes, such as \n11\nC, \n18\nF, \n15\nO and \n13\nN, and would be useful in Positron Emission Topography (PET) studies for examining substrate receptor occupancy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll isotopic variants of the compounds provided herein, radioactive or not, are intended to be encompassed within the scope of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also to be understood that compounds that have the same molecular formula but differ in the nature or sequence of bonding of their atoms or the arrangement of their atoms in space are termed “isomers”. Isomers that differ in the arrangement of their atoms in space are termed “stereoisomers”.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStereoisomers that are not mirror images of one another are termed “diastereomers” and those that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other are termed “enantiomers”. When a compound has an asymmetric center, for example, it is bonded to four different groups, a pair of enantiomers is possible. An enantiomer can be characterized by the absolute configuration of its asymmetric center and is described by the R- and S-sequencing rules of Cahn and Prelog, or by the manner in which the molecule rotates the plane of polarized light and designated as dextrorotatory or levorotatory (i.e., as (+) or (−)-isomers respectively). A chiral compound can exist as either individual enantiomer or as a mixture thereof. A mixture containing equal proportions of the enantiomers is called a “racemic mixture”.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Tautomers” refer to compounds that are interchangeable forms of a particular compound structure, and that vary in the displacement of hydrogen atoms and electrons. Thus, two structures may be in equilibrium through the movement of π electrons and an atom (usually H). For example, enols and ketones are tautomers because they are rapidly interconverted by treatment with either acid or base. Another example of tautomerism is the aci- and nitro-forms of phenylnitromethane, that are likewise formed by treatment with acid or base.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTautomeric forms may be relevant to the attainment of the optimal chemical reactivity and biological activity of a compound of interest.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of this invention may possess one or more asymmetric centers; such compounds can therefore be produced as individual (R)- or (S)-stereoisomers or as mixtures thereof. Unless indicated otherwise, the description or naming of a particular compound in the specification and claims is intended to include both individual enantiomers and mixtures, racemic or otherwise, thereof. The methods for the determination of stereochemistry and the separation of stereoisomers are well-known in the art.\n\n\n \nThe Compounds\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention is based on the discovery of that MAPKAPK5 functions in the pathway that results in the expression of MMP1, and that inhibitors of MAPKAPK5 activity, such as the compounds of the present invention, are useful for the treatment of diseases involving the abnormally high expression of MMP activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present matrix metallo proteinase inhibiting compounds of the present invention may be described generally as [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrazine-8-yl-amines substituted in the 5-position by an aryl and heteroaryl group, and an in the 8-position by an arylamino or a heteroarylamino group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore particularly, the present invention relates to compounds having matrix metallo proteinase inhibiting properties in a mammalian cell, according to formula (I):\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein:\n\n \n \n \nA and B are independently CR2R″, NR″, oxygen or sulphur;\n \nAA is CR2 or N;\n \nD is C═O, CR2R″ or NR″;\n \nE is NH or CR″R6, when k is zero, and is NH or CR″R6a, when k is one;\n \nF is sulphur, oxygen or NH;\n \nT is oxygen or NR;\n \nU, V, W and X are independently CR″R7 or NR″;\n \nY is CR″ or N;\n \nZ is hydrogen, amino, hydroxyl, lower alkoxy, carbamoyl, carboxyl, SO\n2\nRz, SO\n2\nNRRz, —NR(CO)(CH2)d-Rz, —NRRz, —(CO)—ORz, —(CO)—NR(CH2)d-Rz, or\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\nR is independently hydrogen or lower alkyl;\n\n\nR″ is H or forms a double bond with an adjacent atom;\n\n\nR1 is H;

Prodrugs are derivatives of the compounds of the invention, which have metabolically cleavable groups and become by solvolysis or under physiological conditions the compounds of the invention, which are pharmaceutically active, in vivo. A prodrug may be inactive when administered to a subject but is converted in vivo to an active compound of the invention. “Pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs” as used herein refers to those prodrugs of the compounds useful in the present invention, which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of patients with undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, and effective for their intended use of the compounds of the invention. The term “prodrug” means a compound that is transformed in vivo to yield an effective compound useful in the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate or solvate thereof. The transformation may occur by various mechanisms, such as through hydrolysis in blood. The compounds bearing metabolically cleavable groups have the advantage that they may exhibit improved bioavailability as a result of enhanced solubility and/or rate of absorption conferred upon the parent compound by virtue of the presence of the metabolically cleavable group, thus, such compounds act as pro-drugs.

Widder et al, Ed., Academic Press, 42, 309-396 (1985); A Textbook of Drug Design and Development, Krogsgaard-Larsen and H.

Roche, ed., American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987, which are incorporated herein by reference. Such examples include, but are not limited to, choline ester derivatives and the like, N-alkylmorpholine esters and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther derivatives of the compounds of this invention have activity in both their acid and acid derivative forms, but the acid sensitive form often offers advantages of solubility, tissue compatibility, or delayed release in the mammalian organism (see, Bundgard, H., Design of Prodrugs, pp. 7-9, 21-24, Elsevier, Amsterdam 1985). Prodrugs include acid derivatives well know to practitioners of the art, such as, for example, esters prepared by reaction of the parent acid with a suitable alcohol, or amides prepared by reaction of the parent acid compound with a substituted or unsubstituted amine, or acid anhydrides, or mixed anhydrides. Simple aliphatic or aromatic esters, amides and anhydrides derived from acidic groups pendant on the compounds of this invention are preferred prodrugs. In some cases it is desirable to prepare double ester type prodrugs such as (acyloxy)alkyl esters or ((alkoxycarbonyl)oxy)alkylesters. Preferred are the C\n1 \nto C\n8 \nalkyl, C\n2\n-C\n8 \nalkenyl, aryl, C\n7\n-C\n12 \nsubstituted aryl, and C\n7\n-C\n12 \narylalkyl esters of the compounds of the invention.\n\n\n \nPharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\n \n \n \nWhen employed as pharmaceuticals, the compounds of this invention are typically administered in the form of a pharmaceutical composition. Such compositions can be prepared in a manner well known in the pharmaceutical art and comprise at least one active compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, the compounds of this invention are administered in a pharmaceutically effective amount. The amount of the compound actually administered will typically be determined by a physician, in the light of the relevant circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the actual compound-administered, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, the severity of the patient's symptoms, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions of this invention can be administered by a variety of routes including oral, rectal, transdermal, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, and intranasal. Depending on the intended route of delivery, the compounds of this invention are preferably formulated as either injectable or oral compositions or as salves, as lotions or as patches all for transdermal administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions for oral administration can take the form of bulk liquid solutions or suspensions, or bulk powders. More commonly, however, the compositions are presented in unit dosage forms to facilitate accurate dosing. The term “unit dosage forms” refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient. Typical unit dosage forms include prefilled, premeasured ampules or syringes of the liquid compositions or pills, tablets, capsules or the like in the case of solid compositions. In such compositions, the furansulfonic acid compound is usually a minor component (from about 0.1 to about 50% by weight or preferably from about 1 to about 40% by weight) with the remainder being various vehicles or carriers and processing aids helpful for forming the desired dosing form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiquid forms suitable for oral administration may include a suitable aqueous or nonaqueous vehicle with buffers, suspending and dispensing agents, colorants, flavors and the like. Solid forms may include, for example, any of the following ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature: a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatin; an excipient such as starch or lactose, a disintegrating agent such as alginic acid, Primogel, or corn starch; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; a glidant such as colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening agent such as sucrose or saccharin; or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl salicylate, or orange flavoring.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInjectable compositions are typically based upon injectable sterile saline or phosphate-buffered saline or other injectable carriers known in the art. As before, the active compound in such compositions is typically a minor component, often being from about 0.05 to 10% by weight with the remainder being the injectable carrier and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTransdermal compositions are typically formulated as a topical ointment or cream containing the active ingredient(s), generally in an amount ranging from about 0.01 to about 20% by weight, preferably from about 0.1 to about 20% by weight, preferably from about 0.1 to about 10% by weight, and more preferably from about 0.5 to about 15% by weight. When formulated as a ointment, the active ingredients will typically be combined with either a paraffinic or a water-miscible ointment base. Alternatively, the active ingredients may be formulated in a cream with, for example an oil-in-water cream base. Such transdermal formulations are well-known in the art and generally include additional ingredients to enhance the dermal penetration of stability of the active ingredients or the formulation. All such known transdermal formulations and ingredients are included within the scope of this invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of this invention can also be administered by a transdermal device. Accordingly, transdermal administration can be accomplished using a patch either of the reservoir or porous membrane type, or of a solid matrix variety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above-described components for orally administrable, injectable or topically administrable compositions are merely representative. Other materials as well as processing techniques and the like are set forth in \nPart\n 8 of \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, \n17th edition, 1985, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of this invention can also be administered in sustained release forms or from sustained release drug delivery systems. A description of representative sustained release materials can be found in \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences. \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following formulation examples illustrate representative pharmaceutical compositions of this invention. The present invention, however, is not limited to the following pharmaceutical compositions.\n\n\n \nFormulation 1—Tablets\n\n\n \n \n \nA compound of the invention is admixed as a dry powder with a dry gelatin binder in an approximate 1:2 weight ratio. A minor amount of magnesium stearate is added as a lubricant. The mixture is formed into 240-270 mg tablets (80-90 mg of active amide compound per tablet) in a tablet press.\n\n\n \nFormulation 2—Capsules\n\n\n \n \n \nA compound of the invention is admixed as a dry powder with a starch diluent in an approximate 1:1 weight ratio. The mixture is filled into 250 mg capsules (125 mg of active amide compound per capsule).\n\n\n \nFormulation 3—Liquid\n\n\n \n \n \nA compound of the invention (125 mg), sucrose (1.75 g) and xanthan gum (4 mg) are blended, passed through a No. 10 mesh U.S. sieve, and then mixed with a previously made solution of microcrystalline cellulose and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (11:89, 50 mg) in water. Sodium benzoate (10 mg), flavor, and color are diluted with water and added with stirring. Sufficient water is then added to produce a total volume of 5 mL.\n\n\n \nFormulation 4—Tablets\n\n\n \n \n \nA compound of the invention is admixed as a dry powder with a dry gelatin binder in an approximate 1:2 weight ratio. A minor amount of magnesium stearate is added as a lubricant. The mixture is formed into 450-900 mg tablets (150-300 mg of active amide compound) in a tablet press.\n\n\n \n \nFormulation\n 5—Injection\n\n\n \n \n \nA compound of the invention is dissolved or suspended in a buffered sterile saline injectable aqueous medium to a concentration of approximately 5 mg/ml.\n\n\n \n \nFormulation\n 6—Topical\n\n\n \n \n \nStearyl alcohol (250 g) and a white petrolatum (250 g) are melted at about 75° C. and then a mixture of a compound of the invention (50 g) methylparaben (0.25 g), propylparaben (0.15 g), sodium lauryl sulfate (10 g), and propylene glycol (120 g) dissolved in water (about 370 g) is added and the resulting mixture is stirred until it congeals.\n\n\n \nMethods of Treatment\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present compounds are used as therapeutic agents for the treatment of conditions in mammals that are causally related or attributable to aberrant activity of MMP1 and/or MAPKAPK5. Accordingly, the compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of this invention find use as therapeutics for preventing and/or treating inflammatory diseases in mammals including humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a method of treatment aspect, this invention provides a method of treating a mammal susceptible to or afflicted with a condition associated with extra-cellular matrix (ECM) degradation, in particular arthritis, and more particularly, rheumatoid arthritis, which method comprises administering an effective amount of one or more of the compounds of the invention or a pharmaceutical composition just described.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another method of treatment aspect, the invention provides a method of treating a mammal susceptible to or afflicted with a condition associated with an abnormal cellular expression of MMP1, which comprises administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutical composition thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another method of treatment aspect, the present invention provides a method of treatment or prophylaxis of a condition characterized by abnormal matrix metallo proteinase activity, which comprises administering a therapeutically effective matrix metallo proteinase inhibiting amount of one or more of the compounds of the invention, or pharmaceutical composition thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another method of treatment aspect, this invention provides methods of treating a mammal susceptible to or afflicted with diseases and disorders which are mediated by or result in inflammation such as, for example rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, myocardial infarction, various autoimmune diseases and disorders, uveitis and atherosclerosis; itch/pruritus such as, for example psoriasis; and renal disorders method comprises administering an effective condition-treating or condition-preventing amount of one or more of the pharmaceutical compositions just described.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis invention also relates to the use of the present compounds in the manufacture of a medicament for treatment or prophylaxis of a condition prevented, ameliorated or eliminated by administration of an inhibitor of Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase-Activated \nProtein Kinase\n 5, or a condition characterised by abnormal collagenase activity, or a condition associated with ECM degradation or a condition selected from diseases involving inflammation, most preferably in for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a further aspect of the invention there is provided the present compounds for use as a pharmaceutical especially in the treatment or prevention of the aforementioned conditions and diseases. Also provided herein is the use of the present compounds in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or prevention of one of the aforementioned conditions and diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA preferred regimen of the present method comprises the administration to a subject in suffering from a disease condition characterized by inflammatory, with an effective matrix metallo-protease inhibiting amount of a compound of the present invention for a period of time sufficient to reduce the abnormal levels of extracellular matrix degradation in the patient, and preferably terminate, the self-perpetuating processes responsible for said degradation. A special embodiment of the method comprises administering of an effective matrix metallo-protease inhibiting amount of a compound of the present invention to a subject patient suffering from or susceptible to the development of rheumatoid arthritis, for a period of time sufficient to reduce or prevent, respectively, collagen and bone degradation in the joints of said patient, and preferably terminate, the self-perpetuating processes responsible for said degradation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInjection dose levels range from about 0.1 mg/kg/hour to at least 10 mg/kg/hour, all for from about 1 to about 120 hours and especially 24 to 96 hours. A preloading bolus of from about 0.1 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg or more may also be administered to achieve adequate steady state levels. The maximum total dose is not expected to exceed about 2 g/day for a 40 to 80 kg human patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the prevention and/or treatment of long-term conditions, such as inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, the regimen for treatment usually extends over many months or years, and accordingly oral dosing is preferred for patient convenience and tolerance. With oral dosing, one to five and especially two to four and typically three oral doses per day are representative regimens. Using these dosing patterns, each dose provides from about 0.01 to about 20 mg/kg of the compound of the invention, with preferred doses each providing from about 0.1 to about 10 mg/kg and especially about 1 to about 5 mg/kg.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTransdermal doses are generally selected to provide similar or lower blood levels than are achieved using injection doses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen used to prevent the onset of an inflammatory condition, the compounds of this invention will be administered to a patient at risk for developing the condition, typically on the advice and under the supervision of a physician, at the dosage levels described above. Patients at risk for developing a particular condition generally include those that have a family history of the condition, or those who have been identified by genetic testing or screening to be particularly susceptible to developing the condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of this invention can be administered as the sole active agent or they can be administered in combination with other agents, including other compounds that demonstrate the same or a similar therapeutic activity, and that are determined to safe and efficacious for such combined administration.\n\n\n \nGeneral Synthetic Procedures\n\n\n \n \n \nThe triazolo[1,5-a]pyridyl compounds of this invention can be prepared from readily available starting materials using the following general methods and procedures. It will be appreciated that where typical or preferred process conditions (i.e., reaction temperatures, times, mole ratios of reactants, solvents, pressures, etc.) are given, other process conditions can also be used unless otherwise stated. Optimum reaction conditions may vary with the particular reactants or solvent used, but such conditions can be determined by one skilled in the art by routine optimization procedures.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art, conventional protecting groups may be necessary to prevent certain functional groups from undergoing undesired reactions. The choice of a suitable protecting group for a particular functional group as well as suitable conditions for protection and deprotection are well known in the art. For example, numerous protecting groups, and their introduction and removal, are described in T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, \nProtecting Groups in Organic Synthesis\n, Second Edition, Wiley, New York, 1991, and references cited therein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following methods are presented with details as to the preparation of representative bicycloheteroaryls that have been listed hereinabove. The compounds of the invention may be prepared from known or commercially available starting materials and reagents by one skilled in the art of organic synthesis.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nGeneral\n\n\n \n \n \nAll reagents were of commercial grade and were used as received without further purification, unless otherwise stated. Commercially available anhydrous solvents were used for reactions conducted under inert atmosphere. Reagent grade solvents were used in all other cases, unless otherwise specified. Column chromatography was performed on silica gel 60 (35-70 μm). Thin layer chromatography was carried out using pre-coated silica gel F-254 plates (thickness 0.25 mm). \n1\nH NMR spectra were recorded on a \nBruker DPX\n 400 NMR spectrometer (400 MHz). Chemical shifts (δ) for \n1\nH NMR spectra are reported in parts per million (ppm) relative to tetramethylsilane (δ 0.00) or the appropriate residual solvent peak, i.e. CHCl\n3 \n(δ 7.27), as internal reference. Multiplicities are given as singlet (s), doublet (d), triplet (t), quartet (q), multiplet (m) and broad (br). Coupling constants (J) are given in Hz. Electrospray MS spectra were obtained on a Micromass platform LC/MS spectrometer. Column Used for all LCMS analysis: Waters Acquity HPLC BEH C18 1.7 μm, 2.1 mm ID×50 mm L (Part No. 186002350)). Preparative HPLC: Waters \nXBridge Prep C18\n 5 μm ODB 19 mm ID×100 mm L (Part No. 186002978). All the methods are using MeCN/H2O gradients.

Regulators of the Expression of MMP1 by Activated Primary Synovial Fibroblasts\n\n\n \n \n \nTo identify compounds that decrease the ECM-degrading activity of cells, the ECM-degrading activity of cells may be induced to allow proper detection of this activity, and to achieve a clearer read-out. In the context of RA, the cells of choice are mammalian synovial fibroblasts and the triggers that may be used to induce the ECM-degrading activity are cytokines relevant in the field of arthritis: for instance TNF-α, IL1β, IL6, OSM, IL17, and MIF1-α. This list is not comprehensive due to the plethora of cytokines potentially involved in the RA pathogenesis (Smolen and Steiner, 2003). To set up an in vitro assay that is as close as possible to the complexity of the pathology, the trigger applied should be a mixture of factors generated by contacting cytokine-producing cells relevant in the field of arthritis, such as monocytes, macrophages, T-cells, and B-cells, with a trigger. The cytokine-producing cells will respond to the contact by producing a complex and unbiased mixture of factors. If the cytokine-producing cell used is also found in a pannus, and the cytokine applied to produce this trigger is found in the synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis patients, the mixture of factors ultimately produced will contain part of the factors that are present in the joints of arthritis patients.\n\n\n \nPrinciple of the ‘MMP Assay’\n\n\n \n \n \nMatrix Metallo Proteases (MMPs) possess various physiological roles, as e.g. the maturation of other proteases, growth factors, and the degradation of extra-cellular matrix components. MMP1 is one of the members of the MMP family that is able to degrade native collagen, the main component of bone and cartilage. An increased expression of MMP1 by synovial fibroblasts (SFs) is diagnostic for the progression of the arthritic disease and is predictive for erosive processes in the joint (Cunnane et al., 2001). The expression of MMP1 by SFs can be increased by the activation of SFs with triggers relevant for rheumatoid arthritis, as cytokines like TNF-α or IL1β (Andreakos et al., 2003). Taken together, measurement of the levels of MMP1 produced by activated SFs is a readout that is highly relevant in the context of RA as this event reflects the level of activation of SFs towards an erosive phenotype as it is seen in the pannus. If a reduced expression of a candidate drug target in activated SFs leads to the reduction of MMP1 expression by these cells, the drug target is then proven to be involved in the regulation of MMP1 expression and thus considered relevant for the development of therapeutic strategies for the treatment of RA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the following examples, the development of an assay, further referred to as ‘MMP assay’, monitors the MMP1 production by synovial fibroblasts (SFs) in response to diverse activating triggers (Example 2.1). The use of this assay is then described for the validation of gene products that are considered drug targets for the development of RA therapies (Example 2.2). The validation of drug targets is performed using recombinant adenoviruses, further referred to as knock-down viruses or Ad-siRNAs, that mediate the expression in cells of shRNA's which reduce the expression levels of targeted genes by a RNAi (RNA interference)-based mechanism (see WO 03/020931). The identification of compounds modulating the activity of the validated drug targets is then described in Table 3. The use of the ‘MMP assay’ for the testing of compounds that modulate the activity of the drug targets identified is described further below.\n\n\n \nAssay Examples\n\n\nControl Viruses Used:\n\n\n \n \n \nThe control viruses used in these studies are listed below. dE1/dE2A adenoviruses are generated from these adapter plasmids by co-transfection of the helper plasmid pWEAd5Af1II-rITR.dE2A in PER.E2A packaging cells, as described in WO99/64582.\n\n\n \nNegative Control Viruses:\n\n\n \n \n \nAd5-eGFP_KD: Target sequence: GCTGACCCTGAAGTTCATC (SEQ ID NO: 1).

Various primary antibodies are tested, as well as various ELISA protocols. The following protocol is developed and validated to measure MMP1 levels in SF supernatant in 384 well plates: white Lumitrac 600 384 well plates (Greiner) are coated with 2 μg/mL anti-MMP1 antibody MAB1346 (Chemicon). The antibody is diluted in buffer 40 (1.21 g Tris base (Sigma), 0.58 g NaCl (Calbiochem) and 5 \nml\n 10% NaN\n3 \n(Sigma) in 1 L milliQ water and adjusted to pH 8.5). After overnight incubation at 4° C., plates are washed with PBS (80 g NaCl, 2 g KCl (Sigma), 11.5 g Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n.7H\n2\nO and 2 g KH\n2\nPO\n4 \nin 10 L milliQ; pH 7.4) and blocked with 100 μL/well Casein buffer (2% Casein (VWR International) in PBS). Next day, casein buffer is removed from ELISA plates and replaced by 50 μL/well EC buffer (4 g casein, 2.13 g Na\n2\nHPO\n4 \n(Sigma), 2 g bovine albumin (Sigma), 0.69 g NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n.H\n2\nO (Sigma), 0.5 g CHAPS (Roche), 23.3 g NaCl, 4 ml 0.5 M EDTA pH 8 (Invitrogen), 5 \nml\n 10% NaN\n3 \nin 1 L milliQ and adjusted to pH 7.0). 0.25 mM DTT (Sigma) is added to the thawed samples plates. After removal of the EC buffer, 20 μL of sample is transferred to the ELISA plates. After overnight incubation at 4° C. plates are washed twice with PBS and once with PBST (PBS with 0.05% Tween-20 (Sigma)) and incubated with 35 μL/well biotinylated anti-MMP1 antibody solution (R&D). This secondary antibody is diluted in buffer C (0.82 g NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n.H\n2\nO, 4.82 g Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 46.6 g NaCl, 20 g bovine albumin and 4 mL 0.5\nM EDTA pH\n 8 in 2 L milliQ and adjusted to pH 7.0) at a concentration of 5 μg/mL. After 2 h of incubation at RT, plates are washed as described above and incubated with 50 μL/well streptavidin-HRP conjugate (Biosource). Streptavidin-HRP conjugate is diluted in buffer C at a concentration of 0.25 μg/mL. After 45 min, plates are washed as described above and incubated for 5 min with 50 μL/well BM Chem ELISA Substrate (Roche). Readout is performed on the Luminoscan Ascent Luminometer (Labsystems) with an integration time of 200 msec or with an Envision reader (Perkin Elmer).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe increase of MMP1 expression by SFs upon treatment with cytokines relevant in the field of RA (TNF-α, IL1β and OSM) or a combination thereof is shown in \nFIG. 2\n as white bars. For this experiment, SFs are seeded in 96 well plates, 3,000 cells/well. 24 h later, the medium is changed to M199 medium supplemented with 1% FBS. One day after the medium change, cytokines or combinations thereof are added to the cultures, each cytokine being added to a final concentration of 25 ng/mL. 72 h after cytokine addition, the supernatant is collected and processed in the MMP1 ELISA as described in the protocol given above. In parallel with this experiment, SFs are triggered, using the same protocol, with the supernatant of THP1 cells (2-fold diluted in M199+1% FBS) treated with the same cytokines or combinations of cytokines for 48 h in M199 medium+1% FBS. MMP1 levels for these samples are shown in \nFIG. 2\n as grey bars. The induction of the MMP1 expression by SFs triggered with the supernatants of TNF-α-treated THP1 cells is stronger (>4.5 fold induction) as compared to the SFs triggered with recombinant TNF-α alone (3-fold induction) and almost equals the 5-fold induction obtained by a mixture of 3 purified cytokines (TNF-α, IL1βb, OSM). This result indicates that the supernatant of TNF-α-induced THP1 cells contains, besides TNF-α, additional pro-inflammatory factors that activate SFs towards MMP1 expression. As the role of TNF-α in the RA pathogenesis is validated (TNF-α-blockers such as Infliximab and Etanercept show some efficacy in the treatment of RA patients) and the THP-1 cells are representative for monocytes/macrophages present in the joint of RA patients, the TNF-α-based trigger mixture prepared by contacting THP-1 cells with TNF-α will contain factors present in the joints of RA patients and subsequently is relevant to RA. This TNF-α-based complex trigger, further referred to as the ‘complex trigger’, will further be used as basis for the ‘MMP assay’.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInhibition of the activation of SF by the ‘complex trigger’ is shown using dexamethasone, a potent anti-inflammatory agent that also strongly reduces collagen-induced arthritis in rodents (Yang et al., 2004) (\nFIG. 3\n). Dexamethasone is shown to dose-dependently reduce amounts of MMP1 produced by complex trigger activated SFs. SFs are seeded at a density of 3000 cells/well in 96 well plates. 24 hrs after seeding, increasing concentrations of dexamethasone are added to the cells. After overnight incubation, medium of every well is refreshed to supernatant of THP-1 cells treated with TNF-α (50% diluted in M199+0.5% FBS), and the same concentration of dexamethasone as added the day before. 48 hrs after treatment, the supernatant is collected and subjected to the MMP1 ELISA described above. The addition of dexamethasone clearly reduced the MMP1 expression by SFs, with an IC\n50 \nvalue of about 1 nM (see \nFIG. 3\n). These data show that the MMP1 expression by activated SFs can be reduced by the addition of a physiologically relevant inhibitor and represent a proof of principle for the ‘MMP assay’.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 2.2\n\n\nMAPKAPK5 Modulates SF ‘Complex Trigger’-Induced MMP1 Expression\n\n\n(A) Ad-siRNA Virus Functions to Knock Down MAPKAPK5 Expression.\n\n\n \n \n \nRecombinant adenoviruses mediating the expression of siRNA's targeting MAPKAPK5 and eGFP are generated according to the procedure described in WO03/020931. The target sequence used in the recombinant adenovirus is: CGGCACTTTACAGAGAAGC (SEQ ID NO: 5) as well as ATGATGTGTGCCACACACC (SEQ ID NO: 6). The target sequence within the eGFP mRNA used in the recombinant adenovirus is: GCTGACCCTGAAGTTCATC (SEQ ID NO: 1). These sequences are cloned into the adapter plasmid using Sap1 sites. dE1/dE2A adenoviruses are generated from these adapter plasmids by co-transfection of the helper plasmid pWEAd5Af1II-rITR.dE2A in PER.E2A packaging cells, as described in WO99/64582.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe functionality of an adenovirus targeting MAPKAPK5 is tested as follows. These adenoviruses are used to infect primary human SFs cultured in petri dishes as follows. On day 1, 500.000 SFs are seeded per petri dish. One day later, the cells are infected with Ad5-MAPKAPK5-v13_KD (1.6E9 VP/mL) or Ad5-eGFP-v5_KD (1.3E10 VP/mL) at an MOI of 4000 (based on the titers (number of virus particles per mL) defined for the viruses by Q-rt-PCR). On \nday\n 7, cells are detached from the petri dish according to standard procedure using a trypsin EDTA solution. The trypsin is then neutralized by addition of DMEM growth medium supplemented with 10% FBS. The cells are then collected by a centrifugation step (1000 rpm, 5 min). The pellet is lysed in 100 μL of fresh RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris pH7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X100, 0.1% SDS). The samples are then sonicated for 10 sec. The protein concentration of the samples is then determined using the BCA kit (Pierce, Cat No 23227) as described by the provider, using BSA as a standard. To 30 μg of cell lysate diluted to 19.5 μl in RIPA buffer, 3.5 μL of reducing agent (NuPage reducing \nagent No\n 10, Invitrogen NP0004) and 7.5 μL of sample buffer (NuPage LDS sample buffer, Invitrogen NP0007) are added. The 30 μL sample is then boiled for 5 min and loaded on a 10% polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen NP0301). To allow the estimation of the level of protein knock-down, 15 μg, 7.5 μg and 3.75 μg of the lysate of the Ad5-eGFP-v5_KD infected cells are also loaded onto the gel. The gel is then run for 2 hours at 100V in 1×MOPS/SDS NuPage running buffer (Invitrogen NP001). 10 μl of Seablue Plus Prestained standard (Invitrogen LC5925) is used to estimate protein size on the gel. The proteins on the gel are then transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Invitrogen LC2002) by a wet blotting procedure using a transfer buffer prepared by mixing 100 ml \nNupage Transfer buffer\n 20* (NP0006-1), 400 mL methanol and 1500 mL Milli Q water. Before the transfer, the membrane is first soaked in methanol and in transfer buffer. The transfer is performed at 100V for 90 minutes. The membrane is then blocked by 30 min soaking in blocking buffer (2% blocking blocking powder (Amersham, RPN 2109) prepared in PBST (PBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma, P1379)). After blocking, the immunodetection is performed using a mouse monoclonal antibody against MAPKAPK5 (BD Biosciences, Cat No 612080) diluted 250 fold in blocking buffer. After overnight incubation with this primary antibody, the membrane is washed 3 times with PBST and incubated 1 hr with the secondary antibody ((Polyclonal goat anti-mouse Ig, HRP conjugated (DAKO P0447) diluted 50000 fold in blocking buffer. The blot is then washed 3 times in PBST and the detection is performed with ECL advance (RPN2109, Amersham) on a Kodakimager according to the manufacturers instructions. The Western Blotting revealed a lower expression level of MAPKAPK5 in the Ad5-MAPKAPK5-v13_KD infected cells compared to the cells infected with the Ad5-eGFP-v5_KD negative control virus. Comparison with the diluted Ad5-eGFP-v5_KD infected samples allowed to estimate the reduction in expression to be 2-fold. Equal loading of the 30 μg samples is demonstrated by immunodetection of β-actin after removal of the MAPKAPK5 antibody by a ‘stripping procedure’ (5 minutes boiling of the membrane in PBST). Immunodetection of β-actin is performed according to the method described for MAPKAPK5 detection, but using a goat polyclonal antibody against β-actin (Santa Cruz, Cat N\no \nSC-1615) at a 1000 fold dilution as primary antibody and a rabbit anti goat antibody at a 50000 fold dilution as a secondary antibody. Results of this experiment are given in \nFIG. 4\n. Taken together, this experiment demonstrated the functionality of the Ad-siRNA virus produced to reduce the MAPKAPK5 expression levels in primary human SFs.\n\n\n \n(B) MAPKAPK5 Knock-Down Ad-siRNA Reduces SF-Induced MMP1 Expression\n\n\n \n \n \nThe efficacy of Ad5-MAPKAPK5-v13_KD virus in the ‘MMP assay’ is tested as follows. Day 1, SFs (\npassage\n 9 to 10) are seeded in 96 well plates at a density of 3000 cells per well in complete synovial growth medium (Cell Applications). One day later, the cells are infected with increasing amounts (3, 6; 9, 12 or 15 μl) of following viruses: Ad5-eGFP-v5_KD, Ad5-MAPKAPK5-v12_KD, Ad5-MAPKAPK5-v13_KD, Ad5-MMP1-v10_KD. The virus load is corrected by addition of the neutral virus Ad5-Luc-v13_KD to bring the final virus volume on the cells to 15 μL in every well. This correction guarantees that the effects observed do not result from the virus load applied to the cells. The cells are then incubated for 5 days before the activation step. This step involves the replacement, in every well, of the growth medium by 75 μL of M199 medium supplemented with 25 μL of ‘complex trigger’. 48 hrs after the activation step, the supernatant is collected and subjected to the MMP1 ELISA as described in Example 1. The results of the experiment are shown in \nFIG. 5\n. The quality of the experiment is demonstrated by the efficacy of the Ad-siRNA virus targeting MMP1 itself. This positive control virus strongly reduces the MMP1 expression by SFs, whereas the negative control virus, designed to target the expression of luciferase, does not influence the levels of MMP1 expression. Two viruses used to validate the MAPKAPK5 target (Ad5-MAPKAPK5-v12_KD and Ad5-MAPKAPK5-v13) do also lead to a clear reduction of the complex trigger induced MMP1 expression by primary human SFs. It can be concluded, from this experiment, that MAPKAPK5 represents a valuable drug target that is shown to modulate MMP1 expression in SFs. Similarly, the inhibition of MAPKAPK5 enzymatic activity by a small molecule compound is expected to reduce the ‘complex cytokine’ induced MMP1 expression in the ‘MMP assay’. The inhibition of MAPKAPK5 enzymatic activity by a small molecule compound is also predicted to reduce the degradation of the joint associated with RA.\n\n\n \n(C) In Vitro ‘MMP Assay’ Testing of Compounds Inhibiting MAPKAPK5\n\n\n \n \n \nCompounds inhibiting the MAPKAPK5 activity in a biochemical assay (i.e. cell free, using purified enzyme), are tested in the ‘MMP assay’ according to following protocol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound master stocks (all at 10 mM concentration in 100% DMSO) are diluted 10-fold in water (Distilled water, GIBCO, DNAse and RNAse free) to obtain a 1 mM intermediate work stock in 10% DMSO. This intermediate work stock is further diluted either 3-fold (or 10-fold) in 10% DMSO to obtain an intermediate work stock of 333 μM (or 100 μM) concentration, respectively, in 10% DMSO. The 1 mM as well as 333 μM (or 100 μM) intermediate work stocks are then further diluted 10-fold in 1.1% DMSO to obtain the 10× workstocks at 100 μM and 33.3 μM (or 10 μM) concentration in 2% DMSO. This 10× work stock is then diluted 10-fold in M199 medium supplemented with 1% FBS to obtain the final ‘1× compound preparation’ containing the compounds at 10 μM and 3.33 μM (or 1 μM) as well as 0.2% DMSO. These are the final conditions at which the compounds are tested on the cells. In parallel, the 10× work stock is diluted 10-fold in ‘complex trigger’ (i.e. the supernatant of TNF-α treated THP1 cells produced as described in Example 1) that is diluted 2-fold in M199 supplemented with 1% FBS to produce the ‘1× compound in 50% complex trigger preparation’.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt day 1, RASFs are seeded in 96 well plates (Flat bottom, tissue culture treated, Greiner) at a density of 3000 cells/well in complete synovial growth medium (Cell Applications). \nDay\n 5, the compounds are added to the cultured cells as follows. Medium is completely removed from the cells and replaced by 75 μL of the ‘1× compound preparations’ containing the compounds at either 10M or 3.33CM (or 1 μM) in M199 medium supplemented with 1% FBS and 0.2% DMSO. After an incubation period of 2 hours, which allows the compounds to equilibrate and enter the cells, 25 μL of the ‘1× compound in 50% complex trigger preparations’ are added to the wells on top of the ‘1× compound preparation’, in the wells containing the corresponding compounds at corresponding concentration. In this way, an 8-fold diluted complex trigger is ultimately applied to the cells. An incubation of 48 hrs is then performed and 20 μl of the cell supernatant is then processed in the MMP1 ELISA as described above, delivering raw data (RLU: relative luminescence units). Following controls are included in the experiments. A maximal signal control, in which the cells are activated by the complex trigger but only the 0.2% DMSO vehicle (and thus no compound) is added. This control indicates the maximal level of MMP1 that can be achieved in the test. A minimal signal control is also included in these experiments. Here, cells are not triggered. The medium of the cells is then changed to 100 μl M199 medium supplemented with 1% FBS at \nday\n 5. This control returns the basal MMP1 levels produced by the RASFs. The percent inhibition of the MMP1 expression achieved by the compounds is then calculated based on the RLU data returned by the ELISA with following formula: [[(maximal MMP1 levels−minimal MMP1 levels)−(MMP1 level compound X at concentration Y−minimal MMP1 levels)]/(maximal MMP1 levels−minimal MMP1 levels)]×100.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nToxicity of the compounds is assessed as follows. Day 1, SFs are seeded in white, tissue culture treated 96 well plates at a density of 3000 cells per well in 100 μL complete synovial growth medium. The compound handling, compound addition to the cells as well as activation of the cells is further performed as described above in this example for the determination of the MMP1 levels. After the 48 hrs incubation period, the medium is removed from the wells, replaced by 50 μL fresh M199 medium supplemented with 1% FBS. 50 μL of substrate (Promega Celltiter Glow cell viability kit) is then added to the wells. After an incubation period of 10 min, luminescence signal is measured. A reduction of the luminescence signal by more than 50% as compared to the maximal control wells is considered to reflect significant toxicity. No toxicity is observed for the compounds tested in the ‘MMP assay’.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt should be understood that factors such as the differential cell penetration capacity of the various compounds can contribute to discrepancies between the activity of the compounds in the in vitro biochemical and cellular MMP assays.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the purpose of Table 3 and Table 4 below, MMP1 EC\n50

by Human PBMCs\n\n\n \n \n \nHuman peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are isolated from “buffy coats” prepared from the blood of healthy volunteers, isolated essentially according to method of Bøyum (1984). In brief, buffy coat is diluted 1:1 with 1×PBS (Gibco) and 30 mL is carefully put on top of 20 mL Lymphoprep™ (Lucron Bioproducts) in 50 mL Falcon tubes. After centrifugation (35 min, 400 g, 18° C.) the mononuclear cells are collected from the white interphase and washed 3 times with 1×PBS by resuspending and centrifugation (10 min, 200 g). Isolated PBMCs are finally resuspended in RPMI 1640 (Cat. No. 21875, Gibco) that is supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Hyclone).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the assay PBMCs are seeded at 2.5E6 cells/mL in 160 μL in 96-well plates (Nunc). Serial dilution of the test compounds are made first in DMSO (Sigma) and then diluted 50-fold in M199 medium (Gibco) containing 1% heat-inactivated FBS. Compounds are further 1/10 diluted in the assay plates to obtain final DMSO concentration of 0.2%. Cells are preincubated with the compounds for 1 hr at 37° C., 5% CO\n2\n. Then, cells are stimulated with LPS (\nEscherichia coli \nserotype 026:B6, Cat. No. L2654, Sigma) that is added in a volume of 20 μL to a final concentration of 1 μg/mL and cells are further cultured for 24 hr. The plates are centrifuged and the supernatant is collected and stored at −80° C. until analysis of appropriate dilutions in ELISAs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following 384-well chemiluminescent ELISA protocol was developed to measure TNFα levels in the supernatant: White Lumitrac 600 384-well plates (Greiner) are coated with (40 μL/well) anti-TNFα capture antibody (Cat. No. 551220, BD Pharmingen) that is diluted to 1 μg/mL in 1×PBS (Gibco). After overnight incubation at 4° C., plates are washed with 1×PBS (80 g NaCl, 2 g KCl (Sigma), 11.5 g Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n.7H2O and 2 g KH\n2\nPO\n4 \nin 10 L milliQ; pH 7.4) and blocked with 100 μL/well buffer B (1×PBS containing 1% BSA (Sigma), 5% sucrose (Sigma) and 0.05% NaN\n3 \n(Sigma)). After 4 hr incubation at RT, blocking buffer is removed and plates are washed once with PBST (1×PBS with 0.05% Tween-20 (Sigma)). Then, 40 μL of sample is transferred to the ELISA plates and plates are incubated at 4° C. Next day, plates are washed 3 times (twice with PBST and once with PBS) and 35 μL/well biotinylated anti-TNFα antibody (Cat. No. 554511, BD Pharmingen) diluted first to a concentration of 250 ng/ml in buffer D (1×PBS with 1% BSA) is added. After 2 h of incubation at RT, plates are washed as described above and 35 μL/well of a 1/2000 dilution of streptavidin-HRP conjugate (Cat. No. SNN2004, Biosource) in buffer D is added. After 45 min, plates are washed as described above and incubated for 5 min with 50 μL/well BM Chemiluminescence ELISA Substrate POD (Roche). Readout is performed on the Luminoscan Ascent Luminometer (Labsystems) with an integration time of 100 msec delivering raw data (RLU: relative luminescence units). The following controls are included in the experiments, a maximal signal control, in which the cells are activated by LPS but only the 0.2% DMSO vehicle (and thus no compound) is added. This control indicates the maximal level of TNFα that can be achieved in the test. A minimal signal control is also included in these experiments. Here, cells are not triggered. This control returns the basal TNFα levels produced by the PBMCs. The percent inhibition (PIN) of the TNFα release, achieved by the compounds is then calculated based on the RLU data returned by the ELISA with following formula: 100−[((TNFα level compound X at concentration Y−minimal TNFα levels)/maximal TNFα levels−minimal TNFα levels))×100]. Where compounds are tested at 8 concentrations (1/3 serial dilution), EC50-values can be calculated by curve fitting of the means of the PIN data achieved for a compound at each test concentration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo assay the effect of compounds on the release of IL1 and IL6 by LPS stimulated PBMC cultures, appropriate dilutions of the supernatant can be measured using the same ELISA protocol as described above. Matched pair antibodies for IL1 and IL6 ELISA (all from R&D Systems) may be used as follows: anti-IL1 capture antibody (Cat. No. MAB601) used at 0.5 μg/mL, biotinylated anti-IL1 detection antibody (Cat. No. BAF201) used at 50 ng/mL; anti-IL6 capture antibody (Cat. No. MAB206) used at 1 μg/mL; biotinylated anti-IL6 detection antibody (Cat. No. BAF206) used at 50 ng/mL.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the purpose of Table 5 below, PBMC EC\n50 \nof each compound, which can be determined using the assay method described herein, is expressed as

method of treatment or prevention of rheumatoid arthritis, which comprises administering to a subject in need thereof, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound according to Formula 1.\n\n\n \n

administration of an inhibitor of Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase-Activated \nProtein Kinase\n 5, or a condition characterised by abnormal collagenase activity, or a condition selected from diseases involving inflammation, most preferably in for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdministering of the compound of the present invention to the subject patient includes both self-administration and administration by another person. The patient may be in need of treatment for an existing disease or medical condition, or may desire prophylactic treatment to prevent or reduce the risk for diseases and medical conditions affected by a disturbance in bone metabolism. The compound of the present invention may be delivered to the subject patient orally, transdermally, via inhalation, injection, nasally, rectally or via a sustained release formulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA preferred regimen of the present method comprises the administration to a subject in suffering from a disease condition characterized by inflammatory, with an effective matrix metallo-protease inhibiting amount of a compound of the present invention for a period of time sufficient to reduce the abnormal levels of extracellular matrix degradation in the patient, and preferably terminate, the self-perpetuating processes responsible for said degradation. A special embodiment of the method comprises administering of an effective matrix metallo-protease inhibiting amount of a compound of the present invention to a subject patient suffering from or susceptible to the development of rheumatoid arthritis, for a period of time sufficient to reduce or prevent, respectively, collagen and bone degradation in the joints of said patient, and preferably terminate, the self-perpetuating processes responsible for said degradation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nToxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such compounds can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Compounds that exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. While compounds that exhibit toxic side effects may be used, care should be taken to design a delivery system that targets such compounds to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage to uninfected cells and, thereby, reduce side effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any compound used in the method of the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC50 (i.e., the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA preferred therapeutically effective amount of the compound of the present invention to administer to a subject patient is about 0.1 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg administered from once to three times a day. For example, an effective regimen of the present method may administer about 5 mg to about 1000 mg of said compound of the present invention from once to three times a day. It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular subject patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular inflammatory condition. A consideration of these factors is well within the purview of the ordinarily skilled clinician for the purpose of determining the therapeutically effective or prophylactically effective dosage amount needed to prevent, counter, or arrest the progress of the condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention can be incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions suitable for administration. Such compositions typically comprise at least one compound of the invention and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used herein the language “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” is intended to include solid carriers such as lactose, magnesium stearate, terra alba, sucrose, talc, stearic acid, gelatin, agar, pectin, acacia or the like; and liquids such as vegetable oils, arachis oil and sterile water, or the like, any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like, compatible with pharmaceutical administration. This listing of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers is not to be construed as limiting. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active compound, use thereof in the compositions is contemplated. Supplementary active compounds can also be incorporated into the compositions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA pharmaceutical composition of the invention is formulated to be compatible with its intended route of administration. Examples of routes of administration include parenteral, e.g., intravenous, intradermal, subcutaneous, oral (e.g., inhalation), transdermal (topical), transmucosal, and rectal administration. Solutions or suspensions used for parenteral, intradermal, or subcutaneous application can include the following components: a sterile diluent such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils, polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents; antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; buffers such as acetates, citrates or phosphates and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. The pH can be adjusted with acids or bases, such as hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. The parenteral preparation can be enclosed in ampoules, disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. For intravenous administration, suitable carriers include physiological saline, bacteriostatic water, Cremophor ELTM (BASF, Parsippany, N.J.) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In all cases, the composition must be sterile and should be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyetheylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, 'chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as manitol, sorbitol, sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which delays absorption, for example, aluminum mono stearate and gelatin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound (e.g., a compound according to an embodiment of the invention) in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle which contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying which yields a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOral compositions generally include an inert diluent or an edible carrier. They can be enclosed in gelatin capsules or compressed into tablets. For the purpose of oral therapeutic administration, the active compound can be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of tablets, troches, or capsules. Oral compositions can also be prepared using a fluid carrier for use as a mouthwash, wherein the compound in the fluid carrier is applied orally and swished and expectorated or swallowed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutically compatible binding agents, and/or adjuvant materials can be included as part of the composition. The tablets, pills, capsules, troches and the like can contain any of the following ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature: a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatin; an excipient such as starch or lactose, a disintegrating agent such as alginic acid, Primogel, or corn starch; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate or Sterotes; a glidant such as colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening agent such as sucrose or saccharin; or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl salicylate, or orange flavoring.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor administration by inhalation, the compounds are delivered in the form of an aerosol spray from pressured container or dispenser which contains a suitable propellant, e.g., a gas such as carbon dioxide, or a nebulizer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSystemic administration can also be by transmucosal or transdermal means. For transmucosal or transdermal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art, and include, for example, for transmucosal administration, detergents, bile salts, and fusidic acid derivatives. Transmucosal administration can be accomplished through the use of nasal sprays or suppositories. For transdermal administration, the active compounds are formulated into ointments, salves, gels, or creams as generally known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds can also be prepared in the form of suppositories (e.g., with conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter and other glycerides) or retention enemas for rectal delivery.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the active compounds are prepared with carriers that will protect the compound against rapid elimination from the body, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Methods for preparation of such formulations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The materials can also be obtained commercially from Alza Corporation and Nova Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Liposomal suspensions (including liposomes targeted to infected cells with monoclonal antibodies to viral antigens) can also be used as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These can be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is especially advantageous to formulate oral or parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subject to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on the unique characteristics of the active compound and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active compound for the treatment of individuals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions can be included in a container, pack, or dispenser together with instructions for administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA compound according to an embodiment of the invention may be provided as a salt, preferably as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of compounds of formula I. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of these compounds include those derived from organic acids such as acetic acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, lactic acid, oxalic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, benzoic acid, salicylic acid, phenylacetic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulphonic acid, benzenesulphonic acid and p-toluenesulphonic acid, mineral acids such as hydrochloric and sulphuric acid and the like, giving methanesulphonate, benzenesulphonate, p-toluenesulphonate, hydrochloride and sulphate, and the like, respectively or those derived from bases such as organic and inorganic bases. Examples of suitable inorganic bases for the formation of salts of compounds for this invention include the hydroxides, carbonates, and bicarbonates of ammonia, lithium, sodium, calcium, potassium, aluminium, iron, magnesium, zinc and the like. Salts can also be formed with suitable organic bases. Such bases suitable for the formation of pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts with compounds of the present invention include organic bases which are nontoxic and strong enough to form salts. Such organic bases are already well known in the art and may include amino acids such as arginine and lysine, mono-, di-, or trihydroxyalkylamines such as mono-, di-, and triethanolamine, choline, mono-, di-, and trialkylamines, such as methylamine, dimethylamine, and trimethylamine, guanidine; N-methylglucosamine; N-methylpiperazine; morpholine; ethylenediamine; N-benzylphenethylamine; tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane; and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSalts of compounds according to an embodiment of the invention may be prepared in a conventional manner using methods well known in the art. Acid addition salts of said basic compounds may be prepared by dissolving the free base compounds according to the first or second aspects of the invention in aqueous or aqueous alcohol solution or other suitable solvents containing the required acid. Where a compound of the invention contains an acidic function, a base salt of said compound may be prepared by reacting said compound with a suitable base. The acid or base salt may separate directly or can be obtained by concentrating the solution e.g. by evaporation. The compounds of this invention may also exist in solvated or hydrated forms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the foregoing description is exemplary and explanatory in nature, and is intended to illustrate the invention and its preferred embodiments. Through routine experimentation, an artisan will recognise apparent modifications and variations that may be made without departing from the spirit of the invention. Thus, the invention is intended to be defined not by the above description, but by the following claims and their equivalents.\n\n\n \nREFERENCES\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\nChoy E H, Panayi G S. (2001).
