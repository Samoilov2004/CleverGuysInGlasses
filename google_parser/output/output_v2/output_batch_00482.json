Description\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to therapeutic peptides and proteins fused to a canine antibody Fc domain. Methods and compositions of using the same are described.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nUse of Fc fusion proteins is now a common modality for increasing the half life of given therapeutic agent in vivo. It is recognized that humans have four human IgG subclasses (namely IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4) and the Fc domains of each of these IgGs have been variously employed as part of potential therapeutic proteins. Antibody “effector functions” are biological activities attributable to an Fc region (a native sequence Fc region or amino acid sequence variant Fc region) of an antibody. Examples of antibody effector functions include C1q binding; complement dependent cytotoxicity; Fc receptor binding; antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC); phagocytosis; down regulation of cell surface receptors (e.g. B cell receptor; BCR), etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese effector functions of an antibody tend to vary depending on the native IgG subclass. For example, it is known that IgG the ADCC toxicity response to human Fc domains varies depending on the particular subclass of IgG. For example, IgG1 and IgG3 are known to induce a much larger ADCC response than IgG2 and IgG4 has lower ADCC response than IgG2-based therapeutics. It is recognized that it is desirable to minimize the ADCC toxicity response from the Fc fusion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the phylogenetic tree of the constant regions of canine, human and mouse IgG y-chains are compared, it becomes readily apparent that although there is significant sequence homology in the constant regions of subclasses within a species, there is very little homology when the constant regions are compared across species (Teng et al. Vet. Immunol. Immunopath. 80 2001, 259-270; see \nFIG. 4\n therein).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGiven that the Fc domain has important effector functions it is important to determine that a given therapeutic response of an Fc-fusion based therapeutic protein is attributable to the therapeutic protein as opposed to the Fc portion of the fusion protein. For agents that are tested in animals, it would be beneficial to characterize the fusion protein response based on Fc portions that are derived from IgGs of the species in which the response is being monitored. This is particularly important when a therapeutic agent is being tested in trials and for dosing regimens. In this regard, there is a need to create specific Fc domains that can be used for testing and treatment of a given therapeutic composition in dogs.\n\n\n \nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention described herein relates to a fusion protein comprising a therapeutic peptide or protein and a canine antibody Fc domain wherein the therapeutic peptide or protein is linked to the Fc domain directly or through a linker, wherein the Fc domain comprises a hinge region having a sequence selected from the group consisting of the hinge region of a canine IgG selected from the group consisting of canine IgGA, canine IgGB, canine IgGC and canine IgGD.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, the fusion protein of \nclaim\n \n1\n, wherein the fusion protein comprises the following formula: X-La-F:F-La-X or X-La-F:F, wherein,\n\n\n \n \n \n \nX is a therapeutic peptide; L is a linker comprising a amino acid residues; a is an integer of at least 0; “:” is a chemical association or crosslink; and F is at least a portion of a canine immunoglobulin Fc domain comprising an FcRn binding site and comprises a hinge region selected from an canine IgGA, canine IgGB, canine IgGC and canine IgGD.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn specific embodiments, the canine hinge region comprises a sequence selected from the group consisting of CTDTPPCP (SEQ ID NO:18); CPKCP (SEQ ID NO:19); FNECRCTDTPPCP (SEQ ID NO:20); PKRENGRVPRPPDCPKCP (SEQ ID NO:21); AKECECKCNCNNCPCPGCGL (SEQ ID NO:22); and PKESTCKCISPCP (SEQ ID NO:23).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe therapeutic protein may be any therapeutic protein that is to be delivered as an Fc fusion construct, exemplary embodiments contemplate the therapeutic peptide is a natiuretic peptide selected from the group consisting of ANP, BNP, Urodilatin, DNP or a biologically active sequence variant thereof.

The therapeutic peptide and the Fc region of the fusion proteins serve two distinct biological roles that contribute to efficacy of the fusion proteins. Surprisingly, linker length also influences efficacy of the fusion proteins. The fusion proteins described herein will be useful in providing an indication of the therapeutic efficacy of drugs in dogs to predict the efficacy of treatment in other animals. Alternatively, the fusion proteins of the invention also may be useful in veterinary therapies for the treatment of dogs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso provided are fusion proteins that comprise at least two therapeutic peptides or proteins separated from each other by a canine antibody Fc domain, wherein the therapeutic peptides or proteins are conjugated to the a canine antibody Fc domain directly or through a linker. It is an important feature of the present invention that the canine Fc domain comprise a hinge region of a canine IgG. The hinge region may be from the same IgG subclass as the remaining canine Fc domain or alternatively, the hinge region may be from a canine IgG that is different from the IgG from which the remainder of the Fc portion is derived. Specific examples of sequences for the canine Fc hinge sequences used in the present invention include:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCTDTPPCP (SEQ ID NO:18; Hinge from canine IgGA); CPKCP (SEQ ID NO:19; Hinge from canine IgGB); FNECRCTDTPPCP (SEQ ID NO:20; Hinge from canine IgGA); PKRENGRVPRPPDCPKCP (SEQ ID NO:21; Hinge from canine IgGB); AKECECKCNCNNCPCPGCGL (SEQ ID NO:22; Hinge from canine IgGC); and PKESTCKCISPCP (SEQ ID NO:23; Hinge from canine IgGD).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn specific embodiments the therapeutic peptide or protein is a natriuretic peptide or protein, which can be a canine natriuretic peptide or protein or a natriuretic peptide or protein from another species.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso provided herein are nucleic acid molecules that encode the therapeutic fusion proteins of the present invention, and expression vectors that comprise polynucleotide sequences encoding canine natriuretic fusion proteins, for uses that include treatment or amelioration of pathological conditions in which activation of the NPRA receptor confers a therapeutic benefit on the subject, including but not limited to diseases associated with abnormal diuretic, canine natriuretic and vasodilatory activity. Fusion proteins or nucleic acid molecules according to the invention may be present in compositions that include pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, carriers or diluents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the present invention is directed to fusion proteins that comprise one or more therapeutic peptides bound to an Fc domain by a glycine succinate linker. As contemplated herein, when a glycine succinate linker is used to link a therapeutic peptide and a canine Fc domain, the glycine residue of the linker is linked to the N-terminus of the Fc domain and the succinate moeity is linked to the C-terminus of the therapeutic peptide, and/or an amino acid linker of various length and sequence. In relation to the linker, the length and composition are necessary to achieve prolonged efficacy of the therapeutic peptide. As contemplated herein, the therapeutic peptide may be linked to the Fc domain in different orientations. In one orientation, the C-terminus of peptide is linked to the N-terminus of the Fc domain and in another orientation, the N-terminus of the peptide is linked to the N-terminus of the Fc domain. The Fc domain exists as a homodimer of the hinge, CH2 and CH3 regions of an IgG molecule, with the Fc domain beginning at the first N-terminal cysteine residue within the IgG hinge region and the homodimer is held together by two disulfide bonds in the hinge from the cysteine residues therein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further aspect, the invention comprises pharmaceutical compositions or formulation comprising pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, carriers or diluents and any of the fusion peptides described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an additional aspect, the invention is also directed to nucleic acid molecules encoding the fusion proteins disclosed herein and expression vectors expressing said proteins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention relates to methods to treat or ameliorate pathological conditions in which activation of the NPRA receptor confers a therapeutic benefit on the subject, including, but not limited to, diseases associated with abnormal diruretic, canine natriuretic and vasodilatory activity and/or in which it is desirable to induce naturesis, diuresis, vasodilation or to modulate the renin-angiotensin II and aldosterone systems. These conditions include those that may be characterized by an excess in extracellular fluid, including, but not limited to, pulmonary edema. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the invention includes methods to treat or ameliorate pathological conditions of the cardiovascular system including, but not limited to, chronic heart failure (non-ischemic), post-MI heart failure (ischemic CHF), acute MI, reperfusion injury, left ventricular dysfunction (LVD), cardiac fibrosis, diastolic heart failure, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

DEFINITIONS \n\n\n \n \n \nUnless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which the invention belongs. The terminology used in the description of the invention herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention. Headers are used for the convenience of the reader and are also not intended to be limiting of the invention. All publications, patent applications, patents, and other references mentioned herein are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety, as are the package inserts of any branded drugs referred to herein by their brand names.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used in the specification and the embodiments set forth herein, the following terms have the meanings indicated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSingular forms “a”, “an”, and “the” are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “fusion protein”, e.g. a “canine natriuretic fusion protein” as the term is used herein, refers to a protein having at least two polypeptides covalently linked, in which one polypeptide comes from one protein sequence or domain and the other polypeptide comes from another protein sequence or domain. Generally, the polypeptides of a fusion protein may be linked either directly or via a covalent linker. The term (“linker”) refers to an amino acid linker, such as a polyglycine linker, or another type of chemical linker, e.g., a glycine succinate linker, a carbohydrate linker, a lipid linker, a fatty acid linker, a polyether linker, etc. The linker may consist of at least 2, 4, 6, 9, 11, 16 or 20 amino acids in length. Alternatively, the linker may consist of at least 0, 1, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 or 30 amino acids, but may optionally be longer, e.g., between 30 and 40 amino acids in length or between 40 and 50 amino acids in length. Amino acids are selected from the 20 naturally occurring amino acids, of either isomeric form D or L, for example, glycine, alanine, proline, asparagine, glutamine, and lysine. A linker may be made up of a majority of amino acids that are sterically unhindered, such as glycine and alanine. The linker may comprise a range of lengths amino acid residues, such as for example, 6 to 11 amino acids in length, 11 to 16 amino acids in length, 16 to 20 amino acids in length, 16 to 25 amino acids in length, 20 to 30 amino acids in length, 30 to 35 amino acids in length, 35 to 40 amino acids in length, 40 to 45 amino acids in length or 45 to 50 amino acids in length. Some of these amino acids may be glycosylated. Non-peptide linkers are also possible. For example, alkyl linkers such as —NH—(CH2)S—C(O)—, wherein s=2-20 could be used. These alkyl linkers may further be substituted by any non-sterically hindering group such as lower alkyl (e.g., C1-C6) lower acyl, halogen (e.g., Cl, Br), CN, NH2, phenyl, etc. An exemplary non-peptide linker is a PEG linker, wherein the linker has a molecular weight of 100 to 5000 kD, preferably 100 to 500 kD. The peptide linkers may be altered to form derivatives in the same manner as described above. As described in the examples herein, the preferred linker of the fusion proteins of the present invention is a stretch of amino acids with the basic repeat (GGS)x or (GGS)xGG. For example, x may be an integer from 0 to 16. Although specific orientations are described in detail herein, polypeptides forming fusion proteins may be linked C-terminus to N-terminus, although they can also be linked C-terminus to C-terminus, N-terminus to N-terminus, or N-terminus to C-terminus and the polypeptides of the fusion protein can be in any order. It is also contemplated herein that the fusion proteins of the present invention may contain two peptide fusions. For example, the fusion protein may comprise one peptide flanked by two Fc domains, e.g., Fc-Canine natriuretic Peptide-Fc, where the canine natriuretic peptide is conjugated to the Fc domains directly or through a linker. As contemplated herein, when a glycine succinate linker is used to link a canine natriuretic peptide and a Fc domain, the glycine residue of the linker is linked to the N-terminus of the Fc domain and the succinate moeity is linked to the C-terminus of the canine natriuretic peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “protein” is used herein interchangeably with “polypeptide” and “peptide.”\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Nucleic acid” refers to deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides and polymers thereof in either single- or double-stranded form. The term encompasses nucleic acids containing known nucleotide analogs or modified backbone residues or linkages, which are synthetic, naturally occurring, and non-naturally occurring, which have similar binding properties as the reference nucleic acid, and which are metabolized in a manner similar to the reference nucleotides. Such analogs are familiar to one of skill in the art and include, e.g., phosphorothioates and phosphoramidates. Unless otherwise indicated, a particular nucleic acid sequence also implicitly encompasses conservatively modified variants thereof (e.g., degenerate codon substitutions) and complementary sequences, as well as the sequence explicitly indicated. As used herein, the term “nucleic acid” may also be referred to as “gene”, “cDNA”, “mRNA”, “oligonucleotide”, and “polynucleotide”.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs contemplated herein, a polynucleotide sequence comprising a fusion protein of the present invention hybridizes under stringent conditions to each of the nucleotide sequences encoding each individual polypeptide of the fusion protein. The polynucleotide sequences encoding the individual polypeptides of the fusion polypeptide therefore include conservatively modified variants, polymorphic variants, alleles, mutants, subsequences, and interspecies homologs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Amino acid” is defined herein as any naturally occurring, artificial, or synthetic amino acid in either its L or D stereoisomeric forms, unless otherwise specified. The term “residue” is used interchangeably with the term “amino acid,” and is often designated as having a particular position in a given sequence of amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Biologically active” refers to an agent having therapeutic or pharmacologic activity, such as an agonist, partial agonist or antagonist.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Effective amount” as provided herein refers to a nontoxic but sufficient amount to provide the desired therapeutic effect. As will be pointed out below, the exact amount required will vary from subject to subject, depending on age, general condition of the subject, the severity of the condition being treated, the particular biologically active agent administered, and the like. An appropriate “effective” amount in any individual case may be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art by reference to the pertinent texts and literature and/or by using routine experimentation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “Fc domain” refers to that part of an antibody derived from the stem of the “Y,” and is composed of two heavy chains that each contribute two to three constant domains (depending on the class of the antibody). The Fc region binds to various cell receptors and complement proteins, and mediates different physiological effects of antibodies. As contemplated herein, the Fc domain of any antibody which displays minimal to no effector function may be used with the present invention. These include, but are not limited to, IgG1, IgG2, IgG4 but may also include any Fc domain of any antibody, the sequence of which has been altered, according to methods familiar to one of skill in the art, to possess minimal effector activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the term “Fc domain” may be described as an IgG heavy chain comprising hinge, CH2 and CH3 regions, wherein the IgG heavy chain begins at the first N-terminal cysteine residue within the hinge region and forms a homodimer with another Fc domain at the first and second N-terminal cysteine residues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “Fc” is also used to describe part of the fusion proteins. In this context, Fc is an IgG heavy chain comprising hinge, CH2 and CH3 domains, the IgG heavy chain begins at the first N-terminal cysteine residue within the hinge region and forms a homodimer with another Fc at the first and second N-terminal cysteine residues. In other words, the N-terminal amino acid sequence of each chain of the Fc homodimer begins with CysProProCysPro (SEQ ID NO: 11) of the IgG hinge region and both Cys residues are disulfide bonded.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, a peptide is said to be “isolated” or “purified” when it is substantially free of cellular material or free of chemical precursors or other chemicals. The fusion peptides of the present invention can be purified to homogeneity or other degrees of purity. The level of purification will be based on the intended use. The critical feature is that the preparation allows for the desired function of the peptide, even if in the presence of considerable amounts of other components.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Canine natriuretic peptides” as referred to herein include the mammalian canine natriuretic factors (ANP, BNP, CNP), urodilatins and peptides analogous thereto, and analogs, active fragments, degradation products, salts, variants, derivatives and combinations thereof. Specifically, canine ANP and BNP include “canine ANP28” and “canine BNP32” are specifically contemplated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWithout being limited by any particular mode of action, as referred to herein, the pharmacokinetics of a “sustained-release, or depot formulation” may be characterized as displaying an increase in bioavailability, due to FcRn binding and recycling of FcRn-bound molecules from within acidic lysosomes back to the general circulation (V. Ghetie and E. S. Ward, Annual Rev. Immunol, 18, 739-766, (2000)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “semi-synthetic” as used herein refers to a process to synthesize the fusion proteins of the present invention comprising the use of both synthetic chemistry and recombinant techniques. For example, the Fc domain of the fusion proteins disclosed herein may be made recombinantly, while the canine natriuretic peptide and linker may be made synthetically.\n\n\n \nB. PEPTIDE MOLECULES \n\n\n \n \n \nThis invention relates to novel, biologically active fusion proteins comprised of one or more canine natriuretic peptides linked to an Fc region of IgG or other antibody from a canine source for uses that include treatment or amelioration of pathological conditions in which activation of the NPRA receptor confers a therapeutic benefit on the subject, including but not limited to diseases associated with abnormal diruretic, canine natriuretic and vasodilatory activity. Fusion proteins according to the invention may be present in compositions that include pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, carriers or diluents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention relates to fusion proteins as described herein that may have one of the following general formulas, A or B,\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein, the therapeutic peptide or protein is\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(i) is a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide and\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(ii) may be in an orientation of N′ to C of the amino acid sequence, C to N′ of the amino acid sequence or in the case of more than one therapeutic peptide, N′ to C, C to N′ or a mixture of N′ to C and C to N′; and the Fc domain is an IgG heavy chain comprising hinge, CH2 and CH3 regions, wherein the IgG heavy chain begins at the first N-terminal cysteine residue within the hinge region and forms a homodimer with another Fc domain at the first and second N-terminal cysteine residues, and wherein the Fc domain is denoted by FCAB or FCBA, wherein AB is an orientation of N′ to C of both Fc domains and BA is an orientation of C to N′ of both Fc domains.

For example, it may be selected from the group consisting of a cytokine, a ligand-binding protein, a hormone, a neurotrophin, a neutrophin receptor, a body-weight regulator, a serum protein, a clotting factor, a protease, an extracellular matrix component, an angiogenic factor, an anti-angiogenic factor, an immunoglobulin receptor, a blood factor, a cancer antigen, a statin, a growth factor, a therapeutic peptide, a non-human protein, a non-mammalian protein and a protein toxin; in specific examples, the therapeutic peptide or protein is selected from the group consisting of one or more canine ANP, canine BNP, canine urodilatin, canine DNP and a biologically active sequence variant thereof; preferably has the sequence of SEQ ID NO:8; still other exemplary therapeutic proteins include cytokine such as hematopoietic factor, interferon, interleukin and tumor necrosis factor; hematopoietic factors such as erythropoietin, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor and granulocyte colony stimulating factor; ligand-binding proteins such as CD molecule, CTLA-4, TNF receptor, and interleukin receptor\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs contemplated herein, in one aspect this invention embodies fusion proteins comprising at least one canine natriuretic peptide conjugated to the Fc domain of an antibody by way of a linker. The fusion protein may actually comprise one canine natriuretic peptide or two canine natriuretic peptides conjugated to an antibody Fc domain from a canine antibody. As described in detail below, the sequence and length of the linker employed to conjugate the peptide with the Fc domain may vary depending on whether the fusion protein comprises one or two canine natriuretic peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne aspect of the invention relates to a fusion protein having one of the following general formulas, 1 or 2,\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein, the natriuretic peptide (i) is selected from the group consisting of one or more canine ANP, canine BNP, canine urodilatin, canine DNP and a biologically active sequence variant thereof and preferably has a sequence of SEQ ID NO: 8 (ii) may be in an orientation of N′ to C of the amino acid sequence, C to N′ of the amino acid sequence or in the case of more than one canine natriuretic peptide, N′ to C, C to N′ or a mixture of N′ to C and C to N′; the linker is one or more linkers selected from the group consisting of a succinate-glycine linker (L1), a GlyGly linker (L2), a Gly(SerGlyGly)2SerGly linker (L3), a (GlyGlySer)\ny\nGlyGly linker, wherein y is 3 to 6 (L4), and 7 (L6)) (GlyGlySer)5Gly (L5) and a (GlySerGly)5Gly linker (L5a); and the Fc domain is an IgG heavy chain comprising hinge, CH2 and CH3 regions, wherein the IgG heavy chain begins at the first N-terminal cysteine residue within the hinge region and forms a homodimer with another Fc domain at the first and second N-terminal cysteine residues, and wherein the Fc domain is denoted by FCAB or FCBA, wherein AB is an orientation of N′ to C of both Fc domains and BA is an orientation of C to N′ of both Fc domains.

For Example, in either \nGeneral Formula\n 1 or \nGeneral Formula\n 2, both Fc Domains may have the sequence of SEQ ID NO:9; or both Fc domains may have a sequence of SEQ ID NO: 10, or one of the Fc domains may have a sequence of SEQ ID NO:9 and the other have a sequence of SEQ ID NO:10.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect of this invention, the fusion protein has the following formula 3,\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwherein ANP is in an orientation of N′ to C (ANP\nXY\n) of the amino acid sequence of ANP or in an orientation of C to N′ (ANP\nyx\n) of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:8; the linker is one or more linkers selected from the group consisting of L1, L2, L3, L4, L5, L5a and L6, wherein L1 is a glycine succinate linker as described herein, L2 is a GlyGly linker, L3 is a Gly(SerGlyGly)2SerGly linker, L4 is a (GlyGlySer)3GlyGly linker, L5 is a (GlyGlySer)5Gly linker, L5a is a (SerGlyGly)5Gly and L6 is a (GlyGlySer)6GlyGly linker; and Fc is (i) an IgG heavy chain comprising hinge, CH2 and CH3 regions, wherein the IgG heavy chain begins at the first N-terminal cysteine residue within the hinge region and forms a homodimer with another Fc at the first and second N-terminal cysteine residues, and (ii) is denoted by FCUB, FCIBA, FC2AB or Fc2BA, wherein Fc1 is derived from an IgG1 molecule, Fc2 is derived from a IgG2 molecule, AB is an orientation of N′ to C of the Fc and BA is an orientation of C to N′ of the Fc. The FC sequences preferably has the sequence of SEQ ID NO:9 and/or SEQ ID NO:10. For Example, in \nGeneral Formula\n 3 both Fc domains may have the sequence of SEQ ID NO:9; or both Fc domains may have a sequence of SEQ ID NO: 10, or one of the Fc domains may have a sequence of SEQ ID NO:9 and the other have a sequence of SEQ ID NO:10.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another aspect of this invention, the fusion protein has the following formula 4,\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein, ANP is in an orientation of N′ to C (ANPXY) of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:8 or in an orientation of C to N′ (ANPyx) of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:8; Linker is one or more linkers selected from the group consisting of L1, L2, L3, L4, L5, L5a, and L6 wherein L1 is a glycine succinate linker as described herein, L2 is a GlyGly linker, L3 is a Gly(SerGlyGly)2SerGly linker, L4 is a (GlyGlySer)3GlyGly linker, L5 is a (GlyGlySer)5Gly linker, L5a is a (SerGlyGly)5Gly and L6 is a (GlyGlySer)6Gly Gly linker; and Fc is (i) an IgG heavy chain comprising hinge, CH2 and CH3 regions, wherein the IgG heavy chain begins at the first N-terminal cysteine residue within the hinge region and forms a homodimer with another Fc at the first and second N-terminal cysteine residues, and (ii) is denoted by FCUB, FCIBA, FC2AB or Fc2BA, wherein Fc1 is derived from an IgG1 molecule, Fc2 is derived from a IgG2 molecule, AB is an orientation of N′ to C of the Fc and BA is an orientation of C to N′ of the Fc. Preferably, the FC sequences have the sequence of SEQ ID NO:9 and/or SEQ ID NO:10. For example, in \nGeneral Formula\n 4 both Fc domains may have the sequence of SEQ ID NO:9; or both Fc domains may have a sequence of SEQ ID NO: 10, or one of the Fc domains may have a sequence of SEQ ID NO:9 and the other have a sequence of SEQ ID NO:10.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe fusion proteins of the present invention are biologically active molecules, e.g., they are able to catalyze cGMP, but are more useful for therapeutic purposes as they possess much longer half-lives and are also less susceptible to proteolytic degradation. In addition, by exploiting FcRn mediated transport, the therapeutic fusion proteins disclosed herein may be administered by bolus injection but may display pharmacokinetic properties resembling that of a slow-release depot formulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe fusion proteins of the present invention are therapeutic peptides that are conjugated to a Fc region of canine antibody, such as a canine IgG directly or through a linker and the Fc region specifically includes a hinge region from a canine IgG. By conjugating the peptide to the Fc region of an antibody, these fusion proteins exhibit much longer half-lives than the unconjugated peptides. Selection of a canine Fc hinge region is important to the in vivo uptake of the therapeutic protein or peptide. Without being limited by any particular mode of action, the fusion proteins of the present invention may be pinocytosed and sequestered upon binding of the Fc region to the neonatal constant region fragment receptor (FcRn) and by exploiting the FcRn active carrier system, (the FcRn pathway transports maternal antibodies (IgG) across the intestinal epithelium of a newborn animal), levels of the fusion proteins disclosed herein can be protected from intracellular lysozomal degredation as well as have reduced exposure to neutral endopeptidase (NEP) or the NPR clearance receptor. The fusion protein may be recycled and represented to the circulation upon normal release from the cell. In this way, activation of the NPRA receptor all at once, such as typical after a bolus dose of ligand, may be avoided. The bioavailability of the fusion proteins of the present invention may more closely resemble a slow-release depot preparation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe FcRn receptor is expressed on the surface of endothelial cells in several different types of tissue in adult humans, including lung, kidney and intestine. Without being limited by any particular mode of action, the normal function of the FcRn receptor may be exploited as a means to administer bioactive therapeutic-Fc fusion proteins for a myriad of clinical uses. For example, in addition to methods to treat or ameliorate pathological conditions of the cardiovascular system, the fusion proteins of the present invention may be used in methods to treat diseases associated with abnormal diuretic, canine natriuretic and vasodilatory activity in which activation of the NPRA receptor confers a therapeutic benefit on the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some exemplary embodiments, the fusion proteins of the present invention may comprise any canine natriuretic peptide, including but not limited to canine ANP or canine BNP.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also contemplated that in addition to sequence variants, fragments of said peptides are included within the scope of the invention disclosed herein, where such fragments are of sufficient size to be therapeutically effective in the methods of the present invention. One of skill in the art can determine alterations in peptide length and sequence variety that does not impact biological activity and/or therapeutic effectiveness without undue experimentation. The proteins may be in the form of acidic or basic salts, or may be in a neutral form. Individual amino acid residues may also be modified by oxidation or reduction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther variants within the scope of the invention include fusion proteins in which the primary amino acid structure is modified by forming covalent or aggregative conjugates with other peptides or polypeptides, or chemical moieties such as glycosyl groups, lipids, phosphate, acetyl groups and the like. Covalent derivatives may be prepared, for example, by linking particular functional groups to amino acid side chains or at the N- or C-terminus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe fusion proteins of the present invention may or may not be glycosylated. Fusion proteins expressed in yeast or mammalian expression systems may be similar to, or slightly different in molecular weight and glycosylation pattern from the native molecules, depending upon the expression system; expression of DNA encoding polypeptides in bacteria such as \nE. coli \nprovides non-glycosylated molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, dimer constructs of the present invention have been found to possess increased in vitro potency when compared to monomer constructs. The increased potency of dimer constructs of therapeutic peptides linked to canine antibody Fc domains as described herein is particularly surprising in view of the monomeric interaction between the canine natriuretic peptide ligands (e.g., ANP, BNP, etc.) and their cell surface receptors. It would be expected that dimeric constructs as described herein would be sterically hindered from interacting with the cells and/or receptors and thus, little and/or no activity of such dimeric constructs would be predicted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, monomer constructs of the present invention have been found to possess increased in vivo serum concentrations (Cmax) when compared to dimer constructs. The increased Cmax of monomer constructs of canine natriuretic peptides linked to antibody Fc domains as described herein is surprising in view of the previous results from intravenous administration of monomeric EPO-Fc constructs that showed a lower Cmax as compared to intravenous administration of dimeric EPO-Fc constructs (see, e.g., Table 4 of U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2007/0172928).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe canine Fc domain conjugated to the therapeutic peptide(s) is preferably the Fc domain of canine IgG, including, but not limited to, IgGA, IgGB, IgGC or IgGD. However, Fc domains of other antibodies may be used if modified to possess minimal or no effector function. Canine antibody Fc domains are preferred, but other species types, wild-type forms as well as sequence variants, may be used, e.g., a recombinant Fc molecule is described in the Examples provided herein. In one aspect of this invention, the Fc domain is made up of two Fc heavy chains from IgG1 or IgG2 isotypes with the hinge residues removed down to the CPPCP sequence on each chain to allow for interchain disulfide bonding of the cysteine residues. Ideally, the fusion proteins of the present invention comprise a canine Fc domain that is able to bind to the FcRn receptor, trigger the active carrier function of this receptor and cause delivery of the fusion protein into the cell without causing an adverse ADCC toxic response. Once inside the cell, pH changes result in the release of the fusion protein from the FcRn receptor, and the fusion protein may ultimately be released from the cell back into the circulation. (Roopenian D. C. et. al. (2003) J. Immunology 170:3528-3533; Lencer, W. I. et al, Trends in Cell Biology 15(1):5-9 (2005)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe length and sequence of the amino acid linkers used to conjugate the therapeutic peptide with the canine Fc domain may be varied. Structural modeling of NPRA with canine ANP bound in relation to a canine Fc domain can be used to predict the minimum linker distance required to allow insertion of the canine Fc-fused canine ANP into the NPRA active site. The linker length should be one that minimizes steric and electrostatic repulsions between the canine natriuretic peptide and the Fc domain. For example, the desired minimal distance from the C-terminus of ANP is 12 A from the closest N-terminus of the Fc homodimer and 17 A from the other N-terminus of the Fc homodimer. Furthermore, if the Fc homodimer has only one ANP fused, (e.g., monomer) a 4 to 6 amino acid minimum linker length would suffice. With two ANP peptides bound to the Fc homodimer (e.g., dimer), and with only one ANP bound to NPRA receptor (i.e., in a 1 :1 Fc dimer :NPRA ratio) then a longer linker length e.g. of 9 amino acids for each linker may be preferred. For both ANPs to bind to NPRA (e.g., to two adjacent receptors or to 1 NPRA receptor in nonstatic, alternating fashion) then linkers with an exemplary length of 12 amino acids could be used. Increasing linker length may have beneficial effects on the properties of the fusion proteins. For example, increased linker length may allow the fusion proteins to approach the potency of the fused canine natriuretic peptide. For example, longer linker lengths (e.g., 20 amino acids in length) may increase potency of the canine natriuretic peptide (as measured by ability to induce cGMP in vitro.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, where increasing linker length increases potency of the fusion proteins. In embodiments of this invention, the potency of the fusion protein may thus be improved at a linker length of between 16 and 50 amino acids, preferably between 16 and 40 amino acids and most preferably between 16 and 30 amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLinker sequences employed in the present invention comprising (GGS)x repeats (e.g., where x is an integer from 0 to 16), may be made according to conventional synthetic, semi-synthetic, or recombinant methods (see, e.g., Evers T. H. et. al. (2006) Biochemistry, 45:13183-13192). With regard to the actual amino acid sequence of the linkers employed, typically glycines and serines are preferred, as the presence of glycines in the linker provide flexibility and serines provide solubility. A preferred linker sequence is made up of a series of repeats of these amino acids, e.g., (GGS)x-GG, for example, where x is an integer from 0 to 16, such as GGSGGSGGSGG or GGSGGSGGSGGSGGSGGSGG. This latter sequence of GGSGGSGGSGGSGGSGGSGG is particularly preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs mentioned above, the orientation of conjugation of Fc domain and therapeuitc peptide may vary. For example, the carboxy terminus of the therapeutic peptide may be linked to the amino terminus of the canine Fc domain by a normal peptide bond. Alternatively, the amino terminus of the therapeutic peptide may be linked to the amino terminus of the canine Fc domain. In the latter case, the chemistry leaves a succinate moiety in place of one amino acid of the fusion. As such, one of skill in the art will recognize that fusion proteins of the latter case may not be made recombinantly as normal peptide bonding does not take place between two amino termini. Data gathered indicate that orientation does not seem to effect the potency of a given fusion protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecific therapeutic constructs of the invention are exemplified using canine ANP fused to a canine Fc domain wherein one or more canine ANP, one or more linkers and one or more canine Fc are used. The following canine ANP-canine Fc fusion constructs are contemplated by the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn exemplary fusion construct (Construct 2), which comprises ANPXY (Construct 1), is represented by:\n\n\n \n \n \nANP\nXY\n-L4-Fc1ab\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe construct comprises ANPXY-L4-FC1AB, wherein ANPXY has a sequence of SEQ ID NO: 8, L is GGSGGSGGSGGSGGSGGSGG SEQ ID NO: 12 and FC1ab has a sequence of SEQ ID NO: 9. ANPXY-L-FC1AB is represented by SEQ ID NO: 3. When the ANPXY-L-Fc1ab construct is made recombinantly, a homodimer may be produced, for example, the ANPXY-L-FC1ab may be linked to a second ANPXY-L-FC1ab construct via a disulfide linkage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn exemplary fusion construct (Construct 3) is represented by:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nANPXY-L-FC2ab\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwherein ANPXY has a sequence of SEQ ID NO: 8, L is GGSGGSGGSGGSGGSGGSGG SEQ ID NO: 12 and FC2ab has a sequence of SEQ ID NO: 10. ANPXY-L-FC2ab is represented by SEQ ID NO: 6. When the ANPXY-L-FC2ab construct is made recombinantly, a homodimer may be produced, for example, the ANPXY-L-FC2ab may be linked to a second ANPXY-L-FC2ab construct via a disulfide linkage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother exemplary fusion construct (Construct 4) is represented by:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn this construct, the ANP YX is SEQ ID NO: 8 inverted in orientation from its C to N′ terminus, L1 is linker having a sequence of GGSGGSGGSGGSGGSGGSGG (SEQ ID NO:12) and FC1AB is SEQ ID NO: 9 or SEQ ID NO:10. The ANPYX-L1-FC1AB may be linked to a second FC1AB via a disulfide linkage and the second FC1AB may have the same sequence as the first FC1AB or may be different to the sequence of the first FC1AB\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother exemplary fusion construct (Construct 5) is represented by:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn this construct, ANP YX is SEQ ID NO: 8 inverted in orientation from its C to N′ terminus, L1 is SEQ ID NO:12 and FC1AB is SEQ ID NO: 9 or SEQ ID NO:10. The ANPYX-L1-FC1AB may be linked to a second ANP\nYX\n-L1-FC1AB construct via a disulfide linkage and FC1AB in both units may be SEQ ID NO:9, or may be SEQ ID NO:10, or may be SEQ ID NO:9 in one unit and SEQ ID NO:10 in the other.\n\n\n \nC. SYNTHESIS OF THE FUSION PROTEINS \n\n\n \n \n \nUnless otherwise indicated herein, the fusion proteins of the present invention may be made by any of a number of techniques of protein chemistry or molecular biology familiar to one of skill in the art. (See, e.g., Dawson et al., Ann. Rev. Biochem., 69:923-960, 2000.) Possible synthesis scenarios are described in the Examples provided herein and include synthetic and semi-synthetic chemical synthesis as well as recombinant methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFusion proteins may be produced using chemical methods in whole or in part and using classical or nonclassical amino acids or chemical amino acid analogs as appropriate. Techniques include solid phase chemistry (Merrifield, J. Am. Chem. Soc, 85:2149, 1964; Houghten, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:5132, 1985) and equipment for such automated synthesis of polypeptides is commercially available (e.g., Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif). Synthesized peptides can be purified using conventional methods such as high performance liquid chromatography. The composition of the synthetic fusion polypeptides may be confirmed by amino acid analysis or sequencing using techniques known to one of skill in the art. Further treatment of a synthesized protein under oxidizing conditions may also be utilized to obtain the proper native conformation. See, e.g. Kelley, R. F. & Winkler, M. E. in Genetic Engineering Principles and Methods, Setlow, J. K., ed., Plenum Press, N.Y., vol. 12, pp 1-19, 1990; Stewart, J. M. & Young, J. D. Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, 111,1984).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe fusion proteins disclosed herein may also be made by recombinant techniques involving gene synthesis, cloning and expression methodologies. These techniques are well known and are explained in, for example, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Volumes I, II, and III, 1997 (F. M. Ausubel ed.); Sambrook et al, 1989, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Second Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.; DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach, Volumes I and II, 1985 (D. N. Glover ed.); A Practical Guide to Molecular Cloning; the series, Methods in Enzymology (Academic Press, Inc.); Gene Transfer Vectors for Mammalian Cells, 1987 (J. H. Miller and M. P. Calos eds., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory); and Methods in Enzymology Vol. 154 and Vol. 155 (Wu and Grossman, and Wu, eds., respectively).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBriefly, the fusion proteins of the present invention may be made recombinantly by isolating or synthesizing nucleic acid sequences encoding any of the amino acid sequences described herein by conventional cloning or chemical synthesis methods. For example, DNA fragments coding for the different fusion protein sequences may be ligated together in-frame in accordance with conventional techniques or synthesized by conventional techniques including automated DNA synthesizers. Alternatively, PCR amplification of gene fragments can be carried out using anchor primers which give rise to complementary overhangs between two consecutive gene fragments which can subsequently be annealed and re-amplified to generate a chimeric gene sequence. The recombinant nucleic acids can further comprise other nucleotide sequences such as sequences that encode affinity tags to facilitate protein purification protocol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nucleic acid sequence encoding a fusion protein of the present invention may be ligated into a suitable expression vector capable of expressing the nucleic acid sequence in a suitable host, followed by transforming the host with the expression vector into which the nucleic acid sequence has been ligated, culturing the host under conditions suitable for expression of the nucleic acid sequence, whereby the protein encoded by the selected nucleic acid sequence is expressed by the host and purifying the protein produced. In this process, the ligating step may further contemplate ligating the nucleic acid into a suitable expression vector such that the nucleic acid is operably linked to a suitable secretory signal, whereby the amino acid sequence is secreted by the host. Suitable secretory signals for use with the present invention include but are not limited to, the mouse IgG kappa light chain signal sequence (Ho et. al. PNAS (2006) 103(25): 9637-9642).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs described above, a nucleic acid sequence encoding a fusion protein described herein may be inserted into an appropriate plasmid or expression vector that may be used to transform a host cell. In general, plasmid vectors containing replication and control sequences that are derived from species compatible with the host cell are used in connection with those hosts. The vector ordinarily carries a replication site, as well as sequences which encode proteins that are capable of providing phenotypic selection in transformed cells. For example, \nE. coli \nmay be transformed using pBR322, a plasmid derived from an \nE. coli \nspecies (Mandel, M. et al., J. Mol. Biol. 53:154, 1970). Plasmid pBR322 contains genes for ampicillin and tetracycline resistance, and thus provides easy means for selection. Other vectors include different features such as different promoters, which are often important in expression. The vectors used for mammalian expression often contain the constitutive CMV promoter that leads to high recombinant protein expression. These vectors also contain selection sequence genes that are used for the generation of stable expressing cell lines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHost cells may be prokaryotic or eukaryotic. Prokaryotes are preferred for cloning and expressing DNA sequences to produce parent polypeptides, segment substituted polypeptides, residue-substituted polypeptides and polypeptide variants. Such prokaryotic cells familiar to one skilled in the art include, but are not limited to, \nE. coli, B subtillus, \nand \nP. aeruginosa \ncell strains. In addition to prokaryotes, eukaryotic organisms, such as yeast cultures, or cells derived from multicellular organisms may be used. Vertebrate cells may also be used as useful host cell lines. Useful cells and cell lines are familiar to one of skill in the art and include, but are not limited to, HEK293 cells, HeLa cells, Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell lines, WI 38, 293, BHK, COS-7 and MDCK cell lines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also relates to isolated or purified polynucleotides that encode the canine natriuretic fusion proteins of the present invention. As discussed above, the polynucleotides of the invention which encode a fusion protein, fragments thereof, or functional equivalents thereof may be used to generate recombinant nucleic acid molecules that direct the expression of the fusion protein, fragments thereof, or functional equivalents thereof, in appropriate host cells. The fusion polypeptide products encoded by such polynucleotides may be altered by molecular manipulation of the coding sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDue to the inherent degeneracy of the genetic code, other DNA sequences which encode substantially the same or a functionally equivalent amino acid sequence, may be used in the practice of the invention for the expression of the fusion polypeptides. Such DNA sequences include those which are capable of hybridizing to the coding sequences or their complements disclosed herein under low, moderate or high stringency conditions described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAltered nucleotide sequences which may be used in accordance with the invention include deletions, additions or substitutions of different nucleotide residues resulting in a sequence that encodes the same or a functionally equivalent gene product. The gene product itself may contain deletions, additions or substitutions of amino acid residues, which result in a silent change.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nucleotide sequences of the invention may be engineered in order to alter the fusion protein coding sequence for a variety of ends, including but not limited to, alterations which modify processing and expression of the gene product. For example, mutations may be introduced using techniques which are well known in the art, e.g., to insert or delete restriction sites, to alter glycosylation patterns, phosphorylation, to create and/or destroy translation, initiation, and/or termination sequences, or to create variations in coding regions, to facilitate further in vitro modification, etc. One of skill will recognize many ways of generating alterations in a given nucleic acid construct. Such well-known methods include, e.g., site-directed mutagenesis, PCR amplification using degenerate oligonucleotides, exposure of cells containing the nucleic acid to chemical mutagenic agents or radiation, chemical synthesis of a desired oligonucleotide (e.g., in conjunction with ligation and/or cloning to generate large nucleic acids) and other well-known techniques.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPurified fusion proteins may be prepared by culturing suitable host/vector systems to express the recombinant translation products of the DNAs of the present invention, which are then purified from culture media or cell extracts. For example, supernatants from systems which secrete recombinant polypeptide into culture media may be first concentrated using a commercially available protein concentration filter, such as, e.g., an Amicon or Millipore Pellicon ultrafiltration unit. Following the concentration step, the concentrate may be applied to a suitable purification matrix. Affinity chromatography or reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) may also be used to purify the fusion proteins of the present invention.\n\n\n \nD. FORMULATIONS \n\n\n \n \n \nThe therapeutic fusion proteins of the present invention can be administered as veterinary compositions for treatment of specific diseases in animals or can be used to test dosing and efficacy of compounds in dogs as animal models. For example the compositions are for use in methods to treat or ameliorate pathological conditions in which activation of the NPRA receptor confers a therapeutic benefit on the subject, including but not limited to diseases associated with abnormal diruretic, canine natriuretic and vasodilatory activity and/or in which it is desirable to induce naturesis, diuresis, vasodilation or to modulate the renin-angiotensis II and aldosterone systems. Such pathological conditions include disorders of the cardiovascular system such as described in detail above. These conditions include those that may be characterized by an excess in extracellular fluid, including but not limited to Chronic Heart Failure (CHF) and pulmonary edema. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the invention includes methods to treat or ameliorate pathological conditions of the cardiovascular system including but not limited to, chronic heart failure (non-ischemic), post-MI heart failure (ischemic CHF), acute MI, reperfusion injury, left ventricular dysfunction (LVD), cardiac fibrosis, diastolic heart failure, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In addition, hypertensive disorders including, but not limited to hypertension, e.g., pulmonary hypertension, systolic hypertension, resistant hypertension and other cardiovascular related diseases such as diabetic nephropathy may be treated or ameliorated by the methods of the present invention. It is also contemplated herein that the fusion proteins and pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be used to provide therapeutic benefit for subjects undergoing coronary artery bypass graft procedures.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions for use in accordance with the present invention may be formulated in a conventional manner using one or more physiologically acceptable carriers or excipients for administration by various means, for example, by inhalation or insufflation (either through the mouth or the nose) or topical, oral, buccal, parenteral or rectal administration. For example, parenteral may include, intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal and epidural administration. The compounds may be administered by any convenient route, for example by infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings (e.g. oral mucosa, rectal and intestinal mucosa, etc.) and may be administered together with other biologically active agents. Administration can be systemic or local. In a preferred embodiment, it may be desirable to introduce the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention into the affected tissues by any suitable route. Pulmonary administration can also be employed, e.g., by use of an inhaler or nebulizer, and formulation with an aerosolizing agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions may further comprise a vehicle or carrier, including a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In a specific embodiment, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable” means approved by a regulatory agency of the Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or other generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in animals, and more particularly in humans. The term “carrier” refers to a diluent, adjuvant, excipient, or vehicle with which the pharmaceutical composition is administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be sterile liquids, such as water and oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like. Water is a preferred carrier when the pharmaceutical composition is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients include starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene, glycol, water, ethanol and the like. The composition, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents. These compositions can take the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsion, tablets, pills, capsules, powders, sustained release formulations and the like. The composition can be formulated as a suppository, with traditional binders and carriers such as triglycerides. Oral formulation can include standard carriers such as pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharine, cellulose, magnesium carbonate, etc. Examples of suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in “Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences” by E. W. Martin, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. The formulation should suit the mode of administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor oral administration, the pharmaceutical compositions may take the form of, for example, tablets or capsules prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as binding agents (e.g., pregelatinized maize starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose); fillers (e.g., lactose, microcrystalline cellulose or calcium hydrogen phosphate); lubricants (e.g., magnesium stearate, talc or silica); disintegrants (e.g., potato starch or sodium starch glycolate); or wetting agents (e.g., sodium lauryl sulphate). The tablets may be coated by methods well known in the art. Liquid preparations for oral administration may take the form of, for example, solutions, syrups or suspensions, or they may be presented as a dry product for constitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may be prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as suspending agents (e.g., sorbitol syrup, cellulose derivatives or hydrogenated edible fats); emulsifying agents (e.g., lecithin or acacia); non-aqueous vehicles (e.g., almond oil, oily esters, ethyl alcohol or fractionated vegetable oils); and preservatives (e.g., methyl or propyl-p-hydroxybenzoates or sorbic acid). The preparations may also contain buffer salts, flavoring, coloring and sweetening agents as appropriate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere appropriate, preparations for oral administration may be suitably formulated to give controlled release of the active compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere appropriate, for buccal administration the compositions may take the form of tablets or lozenges formulated in conventional manner.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the fusion proteins of the present invention are for administration by inhalation or insufflation (either through the mouth or the nose). As such, the compounds for use according to the present invention may be conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from pressurized packs or a nebulizer, with the use of a suitable propellant, e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges of, e.g., gelatin for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a particularly preferred embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be formulated for parenteral administration by injection, e.g., by bolus injection or continuous infusion. In addition, as contemplated herein, the fusion proteins and pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be suitable for self-injection by a subject in need thereof, e.g. long term treatment of CHF. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile pyrogen-free water, before use. For example, lyophilized protein compositions may be inhaled or reconstituted then injected in a suitable vehicle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g., containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the formulations described previously, which may exhibit pharmacokinetics similar to a slow release formulation, the compounds may also be formulated as an actual depot preparation. Such long acting formulations may be administered by implantation (for example subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, the compounds may be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, for example, as a sparingly soluble salt.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions may, if desired, be presented in a pack or dispenser device that may contain one or more unit dosage forms containing the active ingredient. The pack may for example comprise metal or plastic foil, such as a blister pack. The pack or dispenser device may be accompanied by instructions for administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions suitable for use in the invention include compositions wherein the active ingredients are contained in an effective amount to achieve the intended purpose. The determination of an effective dose is well within the capability of those skilled in the art. For example, for any compound, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially either in cell culture assays, e.g., of neoplastic cells, or in animal models, usually mice, rabbits, dogs, or pigs. The animal model may also be used to determine the appropriate concentration range and route of administration. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC50 (i.e., the concentration of the test compound that achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms). Such information can then be used to determine useful doses and routes for administration in humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA therapeutically effective dose or “effective amount” refers to that amount of active ingredient that is nontoxic but sufficient to provide the desired therapeutic effect. Therapeutic efficacy and toxicity may be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population) and LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index, and it can be expressed as the ratio, LD50/ED50. Pharmaceutical compositions that exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. The data obtained from cell culture assays and animal studies is used in formulating a range of dosage for human use. The dosage contained in such compositions is preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage varies within this range depending upon the dosage form employed, sensitivity of the subject, and the route of administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe exact dosage will be determined by the practitioner, in light of factors related to the subject that requires treatment. Dosage and administration are adjusted to provide sufficient levels of the active moiety or to maintain the desired effect. Factors that may be taken into account include the severity of the disease state, general health of the subject, age, weight, and gender of the subject, diet, time and frequency of administration, drug combination(s), reaction sensitivities, and tolerance/response to therapy. Long-acting pharmaceutical compositions may be administered every 3 to 4 days, every week, or once every two weeks depending on half-life and clearance rate of the particular formulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNormal dosage amounts may vary from 0.1 to 100,000 micrograms, up to a total dose of about 1 g, depending upon the route of administration. Guidance as to particular dosages and methods of delivery is provided in the literature and generally available to practitioners in the art. Those skilled in the art will employ different formulations for nucleotides than for proteins or their inhibitors. Similarly, delivery of polynucleotides or polypeptides will be specific to particular cells, conditions, locations, etc. Pharmaceutical formulations suitable for oral administration of proteins are described, e.g., in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,008,114; 5,505,962; 5,641,515; 5,681,811; 5,700,486; 5,766,633; 5,792,451; 5,853,748; 5,972,387; 5,976,569; and 6,051,561.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention further provides kits for use with any of the above methods.

EXAMPLES\n\n\nExample 1 \n\n\nRecombinant Canine ANP-Fc Fusion Protein Production and Characterization\n\n\n \n \n \nCanine ANP-Fc Fusion Construct Generation: Two DNA constructs (\nSEQ ID\n 1 and 4) are synthesized according to conventional oligonucleotide synthesis techniques, and subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Geneart). Each construct contains the same basic order of a mouse IgG kappa light chain signal sequence, canine ANP28 sequence, a linker sequence followed by a canine Fc gamma sequence. The mouse IgG kappa light chain signal sequence utilized is METDTLLLWVLLLWVPGSTG (accession number AAA38778-SEQ ID NO7). The canine ANP28 sequence is from the NCBI database with the accession number P07499 (SEQ ID NO8). The linker sequence encodes for a 20 aa peptide consisting of repeats of glycine and serine residues in a (GGS)\n6\nGG motif. In one construct the linker is attached to the Fc region of canine IgG-A (accession number AAL3530) while in the second construct the linker is attached to the Fc region of canine IgG-B (accession number AAL35302). The Fc regions of canine IgG-A and IgG-B isotypes [Vet Immunol and Immunopath (2001) 80(3-4): 259-270] are utilized due to their predominance in canines and their similarity in hinge structure to human IgG1 and IgG2. The Fc fusions to both IgG-A and IgG-B isotypes are generated in such a way that the hinge region is chopped down to include only two cysteine residues (CTDTPPCP (SEQ ID NO:18) for IgG-A Fc and CPKCP (SEQ ID NO:19) for IgG-B Fc) ensuring that the disulfide linkage in the hinge would be similar on the two Fc isotypes. Each construct was codon optimized for mammalian expression using standard codon tables.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMammalian Expression of the Canine ANP-Fc Fusions: The initial expression of all the canine ANP-Fc fusion constructs is done from HEK293 cell lines using a transient transfection protocol at the 1L scale. HEK293 cells are grown in FreeStyle 293 medium and transfected using the 293Fectin reagents and protocols as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Transiently transfected cells are grown in a spinner flask with agitation of 90 rpm at 37° C. and 5% CO\n2\n. The cells are monitored daily for cell density, viability, and diameter, level of glucose, lactate, glutamine and pH. The conditioned media is harvested 72-96 hours after the transfection by centrifugation at 3600 rpm for 15 minutes and is delivered fresh to purification. Expression levels are determined by SDS-PAGE and Western-blotting analysis. Once the expression levels are determined for each construct, stable pools are generated, if needed, to produce the protein required. The stable pools generation started in a flask where stable cells are selected with 400 μg/ml of G418 and then transferred into spinner. Once the cells stabilize under these conditions, cells are expanded and 5-25L runs are carried out in wave bioreactors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPurification of the Recombinant Canine ANP-Fc Fusion Proteins: All the purifications are performed at 4° C. using an AKTA system (GE Healthcare). Five milliliters of Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Sigma) are added per liter of conditioned media. A column is packed with 3-4 mL ProteinA Ceramic HyperD®F resin (Pall) per liter of conditioned media and equilibrated with 10 CV of Equilibration Buffer (1× Dulbecco's PBS without Mg/Ca, pH 7.3, Invitrogen) at 1 mL/min. Conditioned media is loaded onto the column overnight at 1-5 mL/min depending upon the volume of media. The resin is then washed, in 10 CV sequences, with Wash Buffer 1 (DPBS without Mg/Ca, pH 7.3), Wash Buffer 2 (DPBS without Mg/Ca pH 7.3+1 M NaCl), and then \nWash Buffer\n 1 again. The bound protein is eluted with 10 CV Elution Buffer (0.1 M Glycine/HCl, pH 2.5 in dH\n2\nO) at 2.5 ml/min. The 3 mL fractions are neutralized immediately with 300 μL (10% of fraction) of Neutralization Buffer (1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.0, Invitrogen). Fractions containing canine ANP-Fc fusion protein are pooled and loaded onto a column packed with Q Sepharose (GE Healthcare) anion exchange resin linked in series to column packed with S Sepharose (GE Healthcare) cation exchange resin (both columns were pre-equilibrated with 20 mM Sodium Citrate, pH 6.0). After loading the columns were washed with 10 CV of 20 mM Sodium Citrate, pH 6.0. The Q column was then disconnected from the system and the S column was eluted with a gradient up to 1 M NaCl. The canine ANP-Fc fusion containing fractions were concentrated using \nAmicon Ultra-15\n 10 kDa MWCO concentrators (Millipore) to approximately 3 mg/mL. Aliquots are flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at −80° C. Final products are characterized by SDS-PAGE (non-reduced and reduced), analytical ultracentrifugation and mass spectrometric analysis before submitted for biological function assays. Endotoxin contaminant levels are determined using the EndoSafe PTS System (Charles River Labs).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe canine ANP-Fc fusion constructs are initially produced using 1L transient mammalian expression. The expressed product is purified through a three step process (Protein A, Q anion exchange, S cation exchange) to generate high quality protein. This transient production process yields only ˜1 mg/L of ANP-Fc(CaIgG-A) fusion and 25-30 mg/L ANP-Fc(CaIgG-B) fusion that is >90% pure (SDS-PAGE). To meet the increasing protein demands stable pools were generated and large-scale wave bioreactor productions were implemented. These stable pools enabled the generation of gram quantities of the canine ANP-Fc fusions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalytical Ultracentrifugation of the Recombinant Canine ANP-Fc Fusion Proteins: Sedimentation velocity experiments are conducted to assess the purity and aggregate content of the purified canine ANP-Fc fusions. The canine ANP-Fc fusions are evaluated by sedimentation velocity in a phosphate buffered saline buffer containing 10 mM Sodium Phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.3. Samples are loaded into centrifuge cells containing double-sector charcoal-epon centerpieces and quartz windows. Data is collected using a Beckman XLI analytical ultracentrifuge at 280 nm, 50,000 rpm and 20° C. Solution densities and viscosities are measured using an automated Anton-Paar AMVn/SP3-V viscometer and DMA4500/DMA5000 densitometer at 20° C. The sedimentation data are analyzed using the program SEDFIT (v9.3b).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMass Spectroscopy Analysis of the Recombinant Canine ANP-Fc Fusions: Mass spectrometric experiments are conducted to measure intact molecular weight, to perform partial sequence validation via enzymatic digestion and peptide mapping, and to identify degradation products of the canine ANP-Fc fusions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo evaluate intact \nmolecular weight\n 2 μl of fusion protein is injected onto an Agilent Poroshell column (5 um, 1.0×75 mm) at a flow rate of 100 μl/min. The protein is eluted with a gradient from 20% to 65%A over 6 minutes [Mobile phase A is 98/2/0.1 (Water/Acetonitrile/Formic Acid) and Mobile phase B is 95/5/0.1 (Acetonitrile/Water/Formic Acid)]. The effluent is flowed into an Agilent 6210 LC/TOF mass spectrometer scanning from 600-2500 amu with a 2 second scan time. Data is deconvoluted using the Agilent TOF Protein Confirmation software to yield molecular weight(s).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe fusion proteins are digested with trypsin or Endo-LysC (8010-108) for peptide mapping and degradation analysis. Briefly, 25 μl of each sample is denatured, reduced, and alkylated. Trypsin or Endo-LysC is added, and the sample incubated overnight in a 37° C. water bath. Analysis is performed via HPLC/FTMS. The instrument generates multiple scans during the chromatographic separation at approximately 50,000 resolution. The mass of each eluting peptide is determined with an accuracy of 0.0005% relative error. Peptides predicted based on enzyme specificity are matched if the theoretical value is within 0.0005% of the experimentally determined value. The Endo-LysC data is also searched for N-terminal truncations by looking for the masses corresponding to possible amino acid deletions. Unlike trypsin, the Endo-LysC experiment allows for observation of the intact amino terminal region.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above-described characterization platform was implemented to ensure the quality of the recombinantly produced canine ANP-Fc fusions being tested. As canine ANP28 is very potent in the canine NPRA cGMP assay (EC50 ˜1 nM) monitoring the amounts of “free” ANP in all of the ANP-Fc fusion lots generated using mass spectrometric tools (intact mass and tryptic digests) was critical. These mass spectrometric analyses also allowed us to ensure that the many critical aa's and disulfide, that are necessary for functionality in the canine ANP28 structure, were intact. While the major glycosylation structures (G0, G1, and G2) were identified in the intact mass analysis, a complete glycan analysis was not performed. A mass spectrometric Endo-LysC digest protocol was also implemented to evaluate the N-terminal end of the ANP-Fc fusion peptides. Lots with >90% intact N-termini were selected for further analysis. All lots produced were found to be missing their C-terminal Lysine residue. The level of aggregation was tested by sedimentation velocity experiments in an analytical ultracentrifuge where all lots were found to contain >85% monomer.\n\n\n \nExample 2 \n\n\nGeneration of Stable Cell Lines for In Vitro NPRA Cell Assays\n\n\n \n \n \nFull-length NPRA sequence containing plasmids are purchased from OriGene Technologies, Inc. (Rockville, Md.) then subcloned into pcDNA3.1. Insert orientation and nucleotide sequence of each construct is verified by an outside vendor (SeqWright, Inc.). The pcDNA3.1-NPRA clones are transfected using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) into HEK293 cells where stable cell lines expressing NPRA are selected using G418. Clones are screened using the natriuretic peptide induced cGMP assay described below [NPRA clones are treated with ANP (Sigma)]. High cGMP producing clones are expanded. Cell lines are grown in DMEM containing, 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin, L-glutamine, 400 μg/ml of G418, and 10% FBS (Hyclone).\n\n\n \nExample 3 \n\n\nNatriuretic Peptide Fusion Protein Induced cGMP Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nNatriuretic peptides of >95% HPLC purity are obtained from Sigma. HEK293 NPRA cells grown to 90% confluence are harvested using HANKS based Cell Dissociation Medium (GIBCO). Cells are washed and resuspended at 3.3×10\n5 \ncells per mL in pre warmed Dulbecco's PBS, pH 7.4, 25 mM HEPES, 0.1% BSA, 500 μM 3-Isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) [Assay Buffer]. Assays are performed in Optiplate-96 White Opaque 96-well Microplates (Perkin Elmer). 15 μL of cell suspension is added to 15 μL of 2× fusion protein in Assay Buffer in triplicate and incubated for 20 minutes at 37° C. The cGMP concentration is measured using the HitHunter™ cGMP Assay Kit (DiscoveRx Corporation). cGMP production dose response curves are generated with a four parameter logistic equation fitted using the Levenburg Marquardt algorithm in XLfit4.2 data analysis software (ID Business Solutions, Ltd.).\n\n\n \nExample 4 \n\n\nRecombinant Canine ANP-Fc Fusion Proteins\n\n\n \n \n \nTo produce recombinant canine ANP-Fc fusion proteins mammalian expression constructs are generated. These fusion constructs are designed with common signal sequence, canine ANP28 sequence, linker sequence, and either the Fc region of canine IgG-A or IgG-B. These fusion proteins each contain a N-terminal mouse IgG kappa light chain signal sequence (SEQ ID NO7) that is cleaved off and not part of the final protein product. A 20 aa Glycine-Serine linker is utilized as Glycines add flexibility, while Serines add solubility. The Fc regions of canine IgG-A and IgG-B isotypes [Vet Immunol and Immunopath (2001) 80(3-4): 259-270] are utilized due to their predominance in canines and their similarity in hinge structure to human IgG1 and IgG2. The Fc fusions to both IgG-A and IgG-B isotypes are generated in such a way that the hinge region is chopped down to include only two cysteine residues (CTDTPPCP (SEQ ID NO:18) for IgG-A Fc and CPKCP (SEQ ID NO:19) for IgG-B Fc) ensuring that the disulfide linkage in the hinge would be similar on the two Fc isotypes. The respective DNA and protein sequences (SEQ ID NO:1-6) of the recombinant canine ANP-Fc fusions generated are detailed in \nFIG. 1\n. Expression of the canine fusion protein constructs is driven by the strong CMV promoter of the pcDNA3.1 mammalian expression vector (\nFIG. 2\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA production platform was developed for the generation of recombinant canine ANP-Fc fusions. The canine ANP-Fc fusion constructs are initially produced using 1L transient mammalian expression. The expressed product is purified through a three step process (Protein A, Q anion exchange, S cation exchange) to generate high quality protein. This transient production process yields only ˜1 mg/L of ANP-Fc(CalgG-A) fusion and 25-30 mg/L ANP-Fc(CalgG-B) fusion that is >90% pure (SDS-PAGE). To meet the increasing protein demands stable pools were generated and large-scale wave bioreactor productions were implemented. These stable pools enabled the generation of gram quantities of the canine ANP-Fc fusions. The predicted MW of the non-reduced CaANP-Fc fusion is 60.4 kDa and 59.4 kDa (IgG-A and IgG-B Fc fusion respectively), while the predicted MW of the reduced CaANP-Fc fusion is 30.2 kDa and 29.7 kDa (IgG-A and IgG-B Fc fusion respectively).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA characterization platform was implemented to ensure the quality of the recombinantly produced ANP-Fc fusions being tested. As canine ANP28 is very potent in the canine NPRA cGMP assay (EC50 ˜1 nM) monitoring the amounts of “free” ANP in all of the ANP-Fc fusion lots generated using mass spectrometric tools (intact mass and tryptic digests) was critical.

All lots produced were found to be missing their C-terminal Lysine residue. The level of aggregation was tested by sedimentation velocity experiments in an analytical ultracentrifuge where all lots were found to contain >85% monomer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOverall these processes allowed for the production of grams of recombinant protein for in vitro and in vivo analysis. Also, the final protein from these runs was found to have low amounts of aggregation (<10%), low endotoxin (<1 EU/ml) and to be intact.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe recombinantly produced canine ANP-Fc fusion constructs are tested in canine NPRA cGMP induction assays (Table 1). A representative cGMP assay data set is graphed in \nFIG. 3\n. The shifts in potency seen with the recombinant canine ANP-Fc fusion proteins are visualized by a shift in the curve to the right. The canine ANP-Fc fusions have potencies that are shifted anywhere from 10 to 20-fold from ANP28 depending on the lot tested.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE 1\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRecombinant Canine ANP-Fc fusions and cGMP \n \n \n \nInduction Response Generated on \n \n \n \nCanine NPRA Cells (ANP EC50 = 0.2 +/− 0.07 nM)\n \n \n \n \n \nSEQ\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nID\n \n \n \n \n \ncGMP EC50 (nM)\n \n \n \n NO.\n \nConstruct\n \nLot No.\n \n \nDog NPRA\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6\n \nANP\n28\n-20aa-CalgGB-Fc\n \n8760-110.3\n \n3.0 +/− 0.9\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(n = 3)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6\n \nANP\n28\n-20aa-CalgGB-Fc\n \n8760-137  \n \n2.5 +/− 0.7\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(n = 3)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6\n \nANP\n28\n-20aa-CalgGB-Fc\n \n8760-174  \n \n5.4 +/− 1.0\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(n = 3)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6\n \nANP\n28\n-20aa-CalgGB-Fc\n \n9081-51   \n \n8.3 +/− 1.7\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(n = 3)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6\n \nANP\n28\n-20aa-CalgGB-Fc\n \n9081-53   \n \n9.4 +/− 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(n = 3)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nPK studies in rats showed that these proteins had an increased half life in vivo.\n\n\n\n \nExample 5 \n\n\nPreliminary PKPD Assessment of the Canine Fusion Protein in Dogs\n\n\n \n \n \nDogs were administered a single IV dose (1 mg/kg or 17 nmol/kg) or SC dose (2.5 mg/kg or 42 nmol/kg) of ANP-caFc to assess PKPD over a period of 4 to 7 days.

The sensitivity of the ELISA used to reliably detect ANP-caFc in dog plasma was limited by having a minimum detection level in dog plasma of ˜50 nM. In order to avoid plasma matrix effects, a minimum dilution of 1:50 was required when assaying beagle plasma. The linear range of the assay, in PBS, is 100 μM to approximately 100 nM.

The criteria for dose selection was that the dose could not decrease mean arterial blood pressure more than 5-10 mmHg below baseline, and that it should increase plasma cGMP concentration approximately 1.5×-2× above baseline. The first criterion was established based on achieving a desired clinical profile, i.e., that efficacy could be demonstrated without an arterial blood pressure reduction that would place some heart failure patients potentially at risk. The 1.5×-2× increase in plasma cGMP was based on work done in paced dogs using canine BNP which demonstrated a favorable cardiorenal effect at a dose which produced this magnitude of plasma cGMP elevation (H-H Chen et al. \nJACC\n 2000; 36:1706-12). In \nstudy #\n1, a total of 5 dogs were dosed subcutaneously with vehicle, or ANP-caFc at 0.5, 1 and 2.5 mg/kg based on a modified Latin square design over a 4-week period. This dose-range was chosen because it was expected to overlap the targeted plasma cGMP elevation based on the single dose dog PK study. The dosing interval was 7 days. One animal was excluded from the final data analysis due to a failure of telemetry device during the study. ANP-caFc produced a dose-dependent increase in peak plasma levels of cGMP (3.7-, 3.5- and 6.6-fold—of vehicle day value \nFIG. 6\n), a dose-dependent peak reduction in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP; −13±5, −19±4, and −20±5 mmHg vs. vehicle—\nFIGS. 7A and 7B\n), and peak heart rate was increased (+30 ±10, +29 ±9, and +25 ±9 beats per minute—\nFIGS. 8A and 8B\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSince the MAP decreased more than 10 mmHg during the peak effect for all three doses, \nStudy #\n2 was performed with lower doses (0.05 and 0.25 mg/kg) in the same 4 dogs using a similar study design. \nStudy #\n2 revealed that the 0.25 mg/kg ANP-caFc dose produced a threshold effect for decreasing MAP (−6.6±1.6 mmHg vs. vehicle—\nFIG. 10\n), increasing heart rate (20±9 beats per minute—\nFIG. 11\n), and a moderate increase in plasma cGMP (FIG. 9). The 0.05 mg/kg dose of ANP-caFc had no effect of MAP (1.9±1.4 mmHg), HR (1.8±0.6 beats per minute), or plasma cGMP. (Urine samples were also collected for cGMP excretion measurements, however, samples were contaminated by drinking water and could not be used.)"

IL-13 is mainly produced by Th2 cells and inhibits the production of inflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF, IL-8) by LPS-stimulated monocytes. IL-13 is closely related to IL-4 with which it shares 20-25% sequence similarity at the amino acid level. (Minty et. al., \nNature, \n363(6417):248-50 (1993)). Although many activities of IL-13 are similar to those of IL-4, IL-13 does not have growth promoting effects on activated T cells or T cells clones as IL-4 does. (Zurawski et al., \nEMBO J. \n12:2663 (1993)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInterleukin-4 (IL-4) is a pleiotropic cytokine that has a broad spectrum of biological effects on B cells, T cells, and many non-lymphoid cells including monocytes, endothelial cells and fibroblasts. For example, IL-4 stimulates the proliferation of several IL-2- and IL-3-dependent cell lines, induces the expression of class II major histocompatability complex molecules on resting B cells, and enhances the secretion of IgG4 and IgE by human B cells. IL-4 is associated with a Th2-type immune response, and is produced by and promotes differentiation of Th2 cells. IL-4 has been implicated in a number of disorders, such as allergy and asthma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cell surface receptors and receptor complexes bind IL-4 and/or IL-13 with different affinities. The principle components of receptors and receptor complexes that bind IL-4 and/or IL-13 are IL-4Rα, IL-13Rα1 and IL-13Rα2. These chains are expressed on the surface of cells as monomers or heterodimers of IL-4Rα/IL-13Rα1 or IL-4Rα/IL-13Rα2. IL-4-rα monomer binds IL-4, but not IL-13. IL-13Rα1 and IL-13Rα2 monomers bind IL-13, but do not bind IL-4. IL-4Rα/IL-13Rα1 and IL-4Rα/IL-13Rα2 heterodimers bind both IL-4 and IL-13.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTh2-type immune responses promote antibody production and humoral immunity, and are elaborated to fight off extracellular pathogens. Th2 cells are mediators of 1 g production (humoral immunity) and produce IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10 and IL-13 (Tanaka, et. al., Cytokine Regulation of Humoral Immunity, 251-272, Snapper, ed., John Wiley and Sons, New York (1996)). Th2-type immune responses are characterized by the generation of certain cytokines (e.g., IL-4, IL-13) and specific types of antibodies (IgE, IgG4) and are typical of allergic reactions, which may result in watery eyes and asthmatic symptoms, such as airway inflammation and contraction of airway muscle cells in the lungs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBoth IL-4 and IL-13 are therapeutically important proteins based on their biological functions. IL-4 has been shown to be able to inhibit autoimmune disease and IL-4 and IL-13 have both shown the potential to enhance anti-tumor immune responses. Since both cytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases, inhibitors of these cytokines could provide therapeutic benefits. Accordingly, a need exists for improved agents that inhibit IL-13, and single agents that inhibit both IL-4 and IL-13.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one aspect the invention provides for the use of DOM10-53-474 (SEQ ID NO:1) to inhibit IL-13 (R130Q variant)-stimulated cell proliferation.

The ligands according to the invention in one embodiment comprise immunoglobulin variable domains which have different binding specificities, and do not contain variable domain pairs which together form a binding site for target compound (I.e., do not comprise an immunoglobulin heavy chain variable domain and an immunoglobulin light chain variable domain that together form a binding site for IL-4 or IL-13). In one embodiment each domain which has a binding site that has binding specificity for a target is an immunoglobulin single variable domain (e.g., immunoglobulin single heavy chain variable domain (e.g., V\nH\n, V\nHH\n), immunoglobulin single light chain variable domain (e.g., V\nL\n)) that has binding specificity for a desired target (e.g., IL-4, IL-13). Each polypeptide domain which has a binding site that has binding specificity for a target (e.g., IL-4, IL-13) can also comprise one or more complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of an antibody or antibody fragment (e.g., an immunoglobulin single variable domain) that has binding specificity for a desired target (e.g., IL-4, IL-13) in a suitable format, such that the binding domain has binding specificity for the target. For example, the CDRs can be grafted onto a suitable protein scaffold or skeleton, such as an affibody, a SpA scaffold, an LDL receptor class A domain, or an EGF domain. Further, the ligand can be bivalent (heterobivalent) or multivalent (heteromultivalent) as described herein. Thus, “ligands” include polypeptides that comprise two dAbs wherein each dAb binds to a different target (e.g., TL-4, IL-13). Ligands also include polypeptides that comprise at least two dAbs that bind different targets (or the CDRs of dAbs) in a suitable format, such as an antibody format (e.g., IgG-like format, scFv, Fab, Fab′, F(ab′)\n2\n) or a suitable protein scaffold or skeleton, such as an affibody, a SpA scaffold, an LDL receptor class A domain, an EGF domain, avimer and multispecific ligands as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe polypeptide domain which has a binding site that has binding specificity for a target (e.g., IL-4, IL-13) can also be a protein domain comprising a binding site for a desired target, e.g., a protein domain is selected from an affibody, a SpA domain, an LDL receptor class A domain, an avimer (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2005/0053973, 2005/0089932, 2005/0164301). If desired, a “ligand” can further comprise one or more additional moieties, that can each independently be a peptide, polypeptide or protein moiety or a non-peptidic moiety (e.g., a polyalkylene glycol, a lipid, a carbohydrate). For example, the ligand can further comprise a half-life extending moiety as described herein (e.g., a polyalkylene glycol moiety, a moiety comprising albumin, an albumin fragment or albumin variant, a moiety comprising transferrin, a transferrin fragment or transferrin variant, a moiety that binds albumin, a moiety that binds neonatal Fc receptor).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the phrase “target” refers to a biological molecule (e.g., peptide, polypeptide, protein, lipid, carbohydrate) to which a polypeptide domain which has a binding site can bind. The target can be, for example, an intracellular target (e.g., an intracellular protein target), a soluble target (e.g., a secreted protein such as IL-4, IL-13), or a cell surface target (e.g., a membrane protein, a receptor protein). In one embodiment, the target is IL-4 or IL-13.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase “immunoglobulin single variable domain” refers to an antibody variable region (V\nH\n, V\nHH\n, V\nL\n) that specifically binds a target, antigen or epitope independently of other V domains; however, as the term is used herein, an immunoglobulin single variable domain can be present in a format (e.g., hetero-multimer) with other variable regions or variable domains where the other regions or domains are not required for antigen binding by the single immunoglobulin variable domain (i.e., where the immunoglobulin single variable domain binds antigen independently of the additional variable domains). Each “immunoglobulin single variable domain” encompasses not only an isolated antibody single variable domain polypeptide, but also larger polypeptides that comprise one or more monomers of an antibody single variable domain polypeptide sequence. A “domain antibody” or “dAb” is the same as an “immunoglobulin single variable domain” polypeptide as the term is used herein. An immunoglobulin single variable domain polypeptide, is in one embodiment a mammalian immunoglobulin single variable domain polypeptide, an another embodiment human, and includes rodent immunoglobulin single variable domains (for example, as disclosed in WO 00/29004, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety) and camelid V\nHH \ndAbs. As used herein, camelid dAbs are immunoglobulin single variable domain polypeptides which are derived from species including camel, llama, alpaca, dromedary, and guanaco, and comprise heavy chain antibodies naturally devoid of light chain (V\nHH\n). Similar dAbs, can be obtained from single chain antibodies from other species, such as nurse shark. Possible ligands comprises at least two different immunoglobulin single variable domain polypeptides or at least two different dAbs. The immunoglobulin single variable domains (dAbs) described herein contain complementarity determining regions (CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3). The locations of CDRs and frame work (FR) regions and a numbering system have been defined by Kabat et al. (Kabat, E. A. et al., \nSequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest\n, Fifth Edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, U.S. Government Printing Office (1991)). The amino acid sequences of the CDRs (CDR1, CDR2, CDR3) of the V\nH \nand V\nκ\n dAbs disclosed herein will be readily apparent to the person of skill in the art based on the well known Kabat amino acid numbering system and definition of the CDRs. According to the Kabat numbering system V\nL \n(V\nκ\n or V\nλ\n) CDR1 is from position 24-34, V\nL \nCDR2 is from position 50-56, V\nL \nCDR3 is from position 89-97, and V\nH \nCDR1 is from position 31-35, V\nH \nCDR2 is from position 50-65 and V\nH \nCDR3 is from position 95-102. Heavy chain CDR-H3 have varying lengths, insertions are numbered between residue H100 and H101 with letters up to K (i.e. H100, H100A H100K, H101). Residue 103 which is the start of FR4 is almost always a W. CDRs can alternatively be determined using the system of Chothia (Chothia et al., (1989) Conformations of immunoglobulin hypervariable regions; Nature 342, p877-883), according to AbM or according to the Contact method as follows. See http://www.bioinf.org.uk/abs/ for suitable methods for determining CDRs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOnce each residue has been numbered, one can then apply the following CDR definitions (“-” means same residue numbers as shown for Kabat):\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKabat-most commonly used method based on sequence variability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(using Kabat numbering):\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCDR H1: 31-35/35A/35B\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCDR H2: 50-65\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCDR H3: 95-102\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCDR L1: 24-34\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCDR L2: 50-56\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCDR L3: 89-97\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChothia-based on location of the structural loop regions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(using Chothia numbering):\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCDR H1: 26-32\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCDR H2: 52-56\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCDR H3: 95-102\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCDR L1: 24-34\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCDR L2: 50-56\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCDR L3: 89-97\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbM-compromise between Kabat and Chothia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(using Kabat numbering):\n\n\n(using Chothia numbering):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCDR H1: 26-35/35A/35B\n\n\n26-35\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCDR H2: 50-58\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCDR H3: 95-102\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCDR L1: 24-34\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCDR L2: 50-56\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCDR L3: 89-97\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact-based on crystal structures and prediction of \n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontact residues with antigen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(using Kabat numbering):\n\n\n(using Chothia numbering):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCDR H1: 30-35/35A/35B\n\n\n30-35\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCDR H2: 47-58\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCDR H3: 93-101\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCDR L1: 30-36\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCDR L2: 46-55\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCDR L3: 89-96\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein “interleukin-4” (IL-4) refers to naturally occurring or endogenous mammalian IL-4 proteins and to proteins having an amino acid sequence which is the same as that of a naturally occurring or endogenous corresponding mammalian IL-4 protein (e.g., recombinant proteins, synthetic proteins (i.e., produced using the methods of synthetic organic chemistry)). Accordingly, as defined herein, the term includes mature IL-4 protein, polymorphic or allelic variants, and other isoforms of an IL-4 and modified or unmodified forms of the foregoing (e.g., lipidated, glycosylated). Naturally occurring or endogenous IL-4 includes wild type proteins such as mature IL-4, polymorphic or allelic variants and other isoforms and mutant forms which occur naturally in mammals (e.g., humans, non-human primates). Such proteins can be recovered or isolated from a source which naturally produces IL-4, for example. These proteins and proteins having the same amino acid sequence as a naturally occurring or endogenous corresponding IL-4, are referred to by the name of the corresponding mammal. For example, where the corresponding mammal is a human, the protein is designated as a human IL-4. Several mutant IL-4 proteins are known in the art, such as those disclosed in WO 03/038041.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein “interleukin-13” (IL-13) refers to naturally occurring or endogenous mammalian IL-13 proteins and to proteins having an amino acid sequence which is the same as that of a naturally occurring or endogenous corresponding mammalian IL-13 protein (e.g., recombinant proteins, synthetic proteins (i.e., produced using the methods of synthetic organic chemistry)). Accordingly, as defined herein, the term includes mature IL-13 protein, polymorphic or allelic variants, and other isoforms of IL-13 (e.g., produced by alternative splicing or other cellular processes), and modified or unmodified forms of the foregoing (e.g., lipidated, glycosylated). Naturally occurring or endogenous IL-13 include wild type proteins such as mature IL-13, polymorphic or allelic variants and other isoforms and mutant forms which occur naturally in mammals (e.g., humans, non-human primates). For example, as used herein IL-13 encompasses the human IL-13 variant in which Arg at \nposition\n 110 of mature human IL-13 is replaced with Gln (\nposition\n 110 of mature IL-13 corresponds to position 130 of the precursor protein) which is associed with asthma (atopic and nonatopic asthma) and other variants of IL-13. (Heinzmann et al., \nHum Mol. Genet. \n9:549-559 (2000).) Such proteins can be recovered or isolated from a source which naturally produces IL-13, for example. These proteins and proteins having the same amino acid sequence as a naturally occurring or endogenous corresponding IL-13, are referred to by the name of the corresponding mammal. For example, where the corresponding mammal is a human, the protein is designated as a human IL-13. Several mutant IL-13 proteins are known in the art, such as those disclosed in WO 03/035847.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Affinity” and “avidity” are terms of art that describe the strength of a binding interaction. With respect to the ligands of the invention, avidity refers to the overall strength of binding between the targets (e.g., first cell surface target and second cell surface target) on the cell and the ligand. Avidity is more than the sum of the individual affinities for the individual targets.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “toxin moiety” refers to a moiety that comprises a toxin. A toxin is an agent that has deleterious effects on or alters cellular physiology (e.g., causes cellular necrosis, apoptosis or inhibits cellular division).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “dose” refers to the quantity of ligand administered to a subject all at one time (unit dose), or in two or more administrations over a defined time interval. For example, dose can refer to the quantity of ligand (e.g., ligand comprising an immunoglobulin single variable domain that binds IL-4 and an immunoglobulin single variable domain that binds IL-13) administered to a subject over the course of one day (24 hours) (daily dose), two days, one week, two weeks, three weeks or one or more months (e.g., by a single administration, or by two or more administrations). The interval between doses can be any desired amount of time.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein “complementary” refers to when two immunoglobulin domains belong to families of structures which form cognate pairs or groups or are derived from such families and retain this feature. For example, a V\nH \ndomain and a V\nL \ndomain of an antibody are complementary; two V\nH \ndomains are not complementary, and two V\nL \ndomains are not complementary. Complementary domains may be found in other members of the immunoglobulin superfamily, such as the V\nα\n and V\nβ\n (or γ and δ) domains of the T-cell receptor. Domains which are artificial, such as domains based on protein scaffolds which do not bind epitopes unless engineered to do so, are non-complementary. Likewise, two domains based on (for example) an immunoglobulin domain and a fibronectin domain are not complementary.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “immunoglobulin” refers to a family of polypeptides which retain the immunoglobulin fold characteristic of antibody molecules, which contains two β sheets and, usually, a conserved disulphide bond. Members of the immunoglobulin superfamily are involved in many aspects of cellular and non-cellular interactions in vivo, including widespread roles in the immune system (for example, antibodies, T-cell receptor molecules and the like), involvement in cell adhesion (for example the ICAM molecules) and intracellular signaling (for example, receptor molecules, such as the PDGF receptor). The present invention is applicable to all immunoglobulin superfamily molecules which possess binding domains. In one embodiment, the present invention relates to antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein “domain” refers to a folded protein structure which retains its tertiary structure independently of the rest of the protein. Generally, domains are responsible for discrete functional properties of proteins, and in many cases may be added, removed or transferred to other proteins without loss of function of the remainder of the protein and/or of the domain. By single antibody variable domain is meant a folded polypeptide domain comprising sequences characteristic of antibody variable domains. It therefore includes complete antibody variable domains and modified variable domains, for example in which one or more loops have been replaced by sequences which are not characteristic of antibody variable domains, or antibody variable domains which have been truncated or comprise N- or C-terminal extensions, as well as folded fragments of variable domains which retain at least in part the binding activity and specificity of the full-length domain. Thus, each ligand comprises at least two different domains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Repertoire” A collection of diverse variants, for example polypeptide variants which differ in their primary sequence. A library that encompasses a repertoire of polypeptides in one embodiment comprises at least 1000 members.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Library” The term library refers to a mixture of heterogeneous polypeptides or nucleic acids. The library is composed of members, each of which have a single polypeptide or nucleic acid sequence. To this extent, library is synonymous with repertoire. Sequence differences between library members are responsible for the diversity present in the library. The library may take the form of a simple mixture of polypeptides or nucleic acids, or may be in the form of organisms or cells, for example bacteria, viruses, animal or plant cells and the like, transformed with a library of nucleic acids. In one embodiment, each individual organism or cell contains only one or a limited number of library members. In one embodiment, the nucleic acids are incorporated into expression vectors, in order to allow expression of the polypeptides encoded by the nucleic acids. In a possible aspect, therefore, a library may take the form of a population of host organisms, each organism containing one or more copies of an expression vector containing a single member of the library in nucleic acid form which can be expressed to produce its corresponding polypeptide member. Thus, the population of host organisms has the potential to encode a large repertoire of genetically diverse polypeptide variants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein an antibody refers to IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD or IgE or a fragment (such as a Fab, F(ab′)\n2\n, Fv, disulphide linked Fv, scFv, closed conformation multispecific antibody, disulphide-linked scFv, diabody) whether derived from any species naturally producing an antibody, or created by recombinant DNA technology; whether isolated from serum, B-cells, hybridomas, transfectomas, yeast or bacteria.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs described herein an “antigen’ is a molecule that is bound by a binding domain according to the present invention. Typically, antigens are bound by antibody ligands and are capable of raising an antibody response in vivo. It may be a polypeptide, protein, nucleic acid or other molecule. Generally, the dual-specific ligands according to the invention are selected for target specificity against two particular targets (e.g., antigens). In the case of conventional antibodies and fragments thereof, the antibody binding site defined by the variable loops (L1, L2, L3 and H1, H2, H3) is capable of binding to the antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “epitope” is a unit of structure conventionally bound by an immunoglobulin V\nH\n/V\nL \npair. Epitopes define the minimum binding site for an antibody, and thus represent the target of specificity of an antibody. In the case of a single domain antibody, an epitope represents the unit of structure bound by a variable domain in isolation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Universal framework” refers to a single antibody framework sequence corresponding to the regions of an antibody conserved in sequence as defined by Kabat (“Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest”, US Department of Health and Human Services) or corresponding to the human germline immunoglobulin repertoire or structure as defined by Chothia and Lesk, (1987) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n196:910-917. The invention provides for the use of a single framework, or a set of such frameworks, which has been found to permit the derivation of virtually any binding specificity through variation in the hypervariable regions alone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase, “half-life,” refers to the time taken for the serum concentration of the ligand to reduce by 50%, in vivo, for example due to degradation of the ligand and/or clearance or sequestration of the dual-specific ligand by natural mechanisms. The ligands of the invention are stabilized in vivo and their half-life increased by binding to molecules which resist degradation and/or clearance or sequestration. Typically, such molecules are naturally occurring proteins which themselves have a long half-life in vivo. The half-life of a ligand is increased if its functional activity persists, in vivo, for a longer period than a similar ligand which is not specific for the half-life increasing molecule. Thus a ligand specific for HSA and two target molecules is compared with the same ligand wherein the specificity to HSA is not present, that is does not bind HSA but binds another molecule. For example, it may bind a third target on the cell. Typically, the half-life is increased by 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% or more. Increases in the range of 2×, 3×, 4×, 5×, 10×, 20×, 30×, 40×, 50× or more of the half-life are possible. Alternatively, or in addition, increases in the range of up to 30×, 40×, 50×, 60×, 70×, 80×, 90×, 100×, 150× of the half life are possible.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs referred to herein, the term “competes” means that the binding of a first target to its cognate target binding domain is inhibited when a second target is bound to its cognate target binding domain. For example, binding may be inhibited sterically, for example by physical blocking of a binding domain or by alteration of the structure or environment of a binding domain such that its affinity or avidity for a target is reduced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “epitopic specificity” refers to the fine specificity of an antigen binding moiety or domain, e.g., an antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof, such as a dAb, defined by the epitope that it binds, rather than the antigen that it binds. Two ligands (e.g. dAbs) that have the same epitopic specificity bind to the same epitope.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “inhibits” means to reduce and or prevent (i.e., both partial or complete inhibition is encompassed). For example, a dAb may prevent binding of a ligand (e.g., a different dAb) to its target, or inhibit binding of a ligand (e.g., a different dAb) to its target by at least about 25%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 85%, at least about 90%, or at least about 95%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the terms “low stringency,” “medium stringency,” “high stringency,” or “very high stringency conditions” describe conditions for nucleic acid hybridization and washing. Guidance for performing hybridization reactions can be found in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, N.Y. (1989), 6.3.1-6.3.6, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Aqueous and nonaqueous methods are described in that reference and either can be used. Specific hybridization conditions referred to herein are as follows: (1) low stringency hybridization conditions in 6× sodium chloride/sodium citrate (SSC) at about 45° C., followed by two washes in 0.2×SSC, 0.1% SDS at least at 50° C. (the temperature of the washes can be increased to 55° C. for low stringency conditions); (2) medium stringency hybridization conditions in 6×SSC at about 45° C., followed by one or more washes in 0.2×SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60° C.; (3) high stringency hybridization conditions in 6×SSC at about 45° C., followed by one or more washes in 0.2×SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65° C.; and in one embodiment (4) very high stringency hybridization conditions are 0.5M sodium phosphate, 7% SDS at 65° C., followed by one or more washes at 0.2×SSC, 1% SDS at 65° C. Very high stringency conditions (4) are the possible conditions and the ones that should be used unless otherwise specified.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSequences similar or homologous (e.g., at least about 70% sequence identity) to the sequences disclosed herein are also part of the invention. In some embodiments, the sequence identity at the amino acid level can be about 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or higher. At the nucleic acid level, the sequence identity can be about 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or higher. Alternatively, substantial identity exists when the nucleic acid segments will hybridize under selective hybridization conditions (e.g., very high stringency hybridization conditions), to the complement of the strand. The nucleic acids may be present in whole cells, in a cell lysate, or in a partially purified or substantially pure form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCalculations of “homology” or “sequence identity” or “similarity” between two sequences (the terms are used interchangeably herein) are performed as follows. The sequences are aligned for optimal comparison purposes (e.g., gaps can be introduced in one or both of a first and a second amino acid or nucleic acid sequence for optimal alignment and non-homologous sequences can be disregarded for comparison purposes). In a possible embodiment, the length of a reference sequence aligned for comparison purposes is at least 30%, in one embodiment at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, 80%, 90%, 100% of the length of the reference sequence. The amino acid residues or nucleotides at corresponding amino acid positions or nucleotide positions are then compared. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same amino acid residue or nucleotide as the corresponding position in the second sequence, then the molecules are identical at that position (as used herein amino acid or nucleic acid “homology” is equivalent to amino acid or nucleic acid “identity”). The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences, taking into account the number of gaps, and the length of each gap, which need to be introduced for optimal alignment of the two sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmino acid and nucleotide sequence alignments and homology, similarity or identity, as defined herein are in one embodiment prepared and determined using the \nalgorithm BLAST\n 2 Sequences, using default parameters (Tatusova, T. A. et al., FEMS Microbiol Lett, 174:187-188 (1999)). Alternatively, the BLAST algorithm (version 2.0) is employed for sequence alignment, with parameters set to default values. BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) is the heuristic search algorithm employed by the programs blastp, blastn, blastx, tblastn, and tblastx; these programs ascribe significance to their findings using the statistical methods of Karlin and Altschul, 1990, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87(6):2264-8.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art (e.g., in cell culture, molecular genetics, nucleic acid chemistry, hybridization techniques and biochemistry). Standard techniques are used for molecular, genetic and biochemical methods (see generally, Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2d ed. (1989) Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. and Ausubel et al., Short Protocols in Molecular Biology (1999) 4th Ed, John Wiley & Sons, Inc. which are incorporated herein by reference) and chemical methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention relates to ligands that have binding specificity for IL-13 (e.g., human IL-13), and to ligands that have binding specificity for IL-4 and IL-13 (e.g., human IL-4 and human IL-13). For example, the ligand can comprise a polypeptide domain having a binding site with binding specificity for IL-13, or comprise a polypeptide domain having a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 and a polypeptide domain having a binding site with binding specificity for IL-13.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also relates to ligands that have cross-reactivity with human IL-4 and a non-human IL-4 (e.g., rhesus IL-4, cynomolgous IL-4), ligands that have cross-reactivity with human IL-13 and a non-human IL-13 (e.g., rhesus IL-13, cynomolgous IL-13), and to ligands that have binding specificity for human IL-4, human IL-13, non-human IL-4 and non-human IL-13 (e.g., rhesus IL-4, rhesus IL-13, cynomolgous IL-4 and cynomolgous IL-13).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ligands of the invention provide several advantages. For example, as described herein, the ligand can be tailored to have a desired in vivo serum half-life. Domain antibodies are much smaller than conventional antibodies, and can be administered to achieve better tissue penetration than conventional antibodies. Thus, dAbs and ligands that comprise a dAb provide advantages over conventional antibodies when administered to treat disease, such as Th2-mediated disease, asthma, allergic diseases, cancer (e.g., renal cell cancer). For example, asthma (e.g. allergic asthma) can be IgE-mediated or non-IgE-mediated, and ligands that have binding specificity for IL-13 or IL-4 and IL-13 can be administered to treat both IgE-mediated and non-IgE-mediated asthma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilarly, due to the overlap and similarity in the biological activity of IL-4 and IL-13, therapy with agents that bind and inhibit only one of these cytokines may not produce the desired effects in all circumstances. Accordingly, ligands that have binding specificity for IL-4 and IL-13 can be administered to a patient (e.g., a patient with allergic disease (e.g., allergic asthma)) to provide superior therapy using a single therapeutic agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the ligand has binding specificity for IL-13 and comprises an (at least one) immunoglobulin single variable domain with binding specificity for IL-13. In certain embodiments, the ligand has binding specificity for IL-4 and IL-13, and comprises an (at least one) immunoglobulin single variable domain with binding specificity for IL-4 and an (at least one) immunoglobulin single variable domain with binding specificity for IL-13.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ligand of the invention can be formatted as described herein. For example, the ligand of the invention can be formatted to tailor in vivo serum half-life. If desired, the ligand can further comprise a toxin or a toxin moiety as described herein. In some embodiments, the ligand comprises a surface active toxin, such as a free radical generator (e.g., selenium containing toxin) or a radionuclide. In other embodiments, the toxin or toxin moiety is a polypeptide domain (e.g., a dAb) having a binding site with binding specificity for an intracellular target. In particular embodiments, the ligand is an IgG-like format that has binding specificity for IL-4 and IL-13 (e.g., human IL-4 and human IL-13).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention relates to a ligand that has binding specificity for interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) comprising a protein moiety that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4; and a protein moiety that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-13. The ligand that has binding specificity for IL-4 and IL-13 of this aspect of the invention, can be further characterized by any one or any combination of the following: (1) the proviso that said protein moiety that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 is not an IL-4 receptor or IL-4-binding portion thereof, and said protein moiety that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-13 is not an IL-13 receptor or IL-13-binding portion thereof; (2) the proviso that said binding site with binding specificity for TL-4 and said binding site with binding specificity for IL-13 each consist of a single amino acid chain; (3) the proviso that neither said binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 nor said binding site with binding specificity for IL-13 comprise an immunoglobulin heavy chain variable domain and an immunoglobulin light chain variable domain; and (4) the proviso that said protein moiety that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 is not an antibody that binds IL-4 or an antigen-binding fragment thereof that comprises an immunoglobulin heavy chain variable domain and an immunoglobulin light chain variable domain that together form a binding site for IL-4, and said protein moiety that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-13 is not an antibody that binds IL-13 or an antigen-binding fragment thereof that comprises an immunoglobulin heavy chain variable domain and an immunoglobulin light chain variable domain that together form a binding site for IL-13.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention relates to a ligand that has binding specificity for IL-13, comprising a protein moiety that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-13. The ligand that has binding specificity for IL-13 of this aspect of the invention, can be further characterized by any one or any combination of the following: (1) the proviso that said protein moiety that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-13 is not an antibody that binds IL-13 or an antigen-binding fragment thereof that comprises an immunoglobulin heavy chain variable domain and an immunoglobulin light chain variable domain that together form a binding site for IL-13; (2) the proviso that said protein moiety that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-13 is not an IL-13 receptor or IL-13-binding portion thereof; (3) the proviso that said binding site with binding specificity for IL-13 consists of a single amino acid chain; and (4) the proviso that said binding site with binding specificity for IL-13 does not consist of an immunoglobulin heavy chain variable domain and an immunoglobulin light chain variable domain.\n\n\n \nLigand Formats\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ligand of the invention can be formatted as a monospecific, dual specific or multispecific ligand as described herein. See, also WO 03/002609, the entire teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference, regarding ligand formatting. Such dual specific ligands comprise immunoglobulin single variable domains that have different binding specificities. Such dual specific ligands can comprise combinations of heavy and light chain domains. For example, the dual specific ligand may comprise a V\nH \ndomain and a V\nL \ndomain, which may be linked together in the form of an scFv (e.g., using a suitable linker such as Gly\n4\nSer), or formatted into a bispecific antibody or antigen-binding fragment theref (e.g. F(ab′)\n2\n, Fab′, Fab fragment). The dual specific ligands do not comprise complementary V\nH\n/V\nL \npairs which form a conventional two chain antibody antigen-binding site that binds antigen or epitope co-operatively. Instead, the dual format ligands can comprise a V\nH\n/V\nL \ncomplementary pair, wherein the V domains have different binding specificities.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ligand (e.g., monospecific, dual specific ligands) may comprise one or more C\nH \nor C\nL \ndomains if desired. A hinge region domain may also be included if desired. Such combinations of domains may, for example, mimic natural antibodies, such as IgG or IgM, or fragments thereof, such as Fv, scFv, Fab or F(ab′)\n2 \nmolecules. Other structures, such as a single arm of an IgG molecule comprising V\nH\n, V\nL\n, \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 and C\nL \ndomains, are envisaged. The ligand can comprise a heavy chain constant region of an immunoglobulin (e.g., IgG (e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4) IgM, IgA, IgD or IgE) or portion thereof (e.g., Fc portion) and/or a light chain constant region (e.g., C\nλ\n, C\nκ\n). For example, the ligand can comprise CH1 of IgG1 (e.g., human IgG1), CH1 and CH2 of IgG1 (e.g., human IgG1), CH1, CH2 and CH3 of IgG1 (e.g., human IgG1), CH2 and CH3 of IgG1 (e.g., human IgG1), or CH1 and CH3 of IgG1 (e.g., human IgG1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one example, a dual specific ligand of the invention comprises only two variable domains although several such ligands may be incorporated together into the same protein, for example two such ligands can be incorporated into an IgG or a multimeric immunoglobulin, such as IgM. Alternatively, in another embodiment a plurality of dual specific ligands are combined to form a multimer. For example, two different dual specific ligands are combined to create a tetra-specific molecule. It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that the light and heavy variable regions of a dual-specific ligand of the present invention may be on the same polypeptide chain, or alternatively, on different polypeptide chains. In the case that the variable regions are on different polypeptide chains, then they may be linked via a linker, generally a flexible linker (such as a polypeptide chain), a chemical linking group, or any other method known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLigands can be formatted as bi- or multispecific antibodies or antibody fragments or into bi- or multispecific non-antibody structures. Suitable formats include, any suitable polypeptide structure in which an antibody variable domain or one or more of the CDRs thereof can be incorporated so as to confer binding specificity for antigen on the structure. A variety of suitable antibody formats are known in the art, such as, bispecific IgG-like formats (e.g., chimeric antibodies, humanized antibodies, human antibodies, single chain antibodies, heterodimers of antibody heavy chains and/or light chains, antigen-binding fragments of any of the foregoing (e.g., a Fv fragment (e.g., single chain Fv (scFv), a disulfide bonded Fv), a Fab fragment, a Fab′ fragment, a F(ab′)\n2 \nfragment), a single variable domain (e.g., V\nH\n, V\nL\n, V\nHH\n), a dAb, and modified versions of any of the foregoing (e.g., modified by the covalent attachment of polyalkylene glycol (e.g., polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, polybutylene glycol) or other suitable polymer). See, PCT/GB03/002804, filed Jun. 30, 2003, which designated the United States, (WO 2004/081026) regarding PEGylated of single variable domains and dAbs, suitable methods for preparing same, increased in vivo half life of the PEGylated single variable domains and dAb monomers and multimers, suitable PEGs, possible hydrodynamic sizes of PEGs, and possible hydrodynamic sizes of PEGylated single variable domains and dAb monomers and multimers. The entire teaching of PCT/GB03/002804 (WO 2004/081026), including the portions referred to above, are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ligand can be formatted using a suitable linker such as (Gly\n4\nSer)\nn\n, where n=from 1 to 8, (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7). If desired, ligands, including dAb monomers, dimers and trimers, can be linked to an antibody Fc region, comprising one or both of \nC\n \n \n \nH\n2 and \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 domains, and optionally a hinge region. For example, vectors encoding ligands linked as a single nucleotide sequence to an Fc region may be used to prepare such polypeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLigands and dAb monomers can also be combined and/or formatted into non-antibody multi-ligand structures to form multivalent complexes, which bind target molecules with the same antigen, thereby providing superior avidity. For example natural bacterial receptors such as SpA can been used as scaffolds for the grafting of CDRs to generate ligands which bind specifically to one or more epitopes. Details of this procedure are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,831,012. Other suitable scaffolds include those based on fibronectin and affibodies. Details of suitable procedures are described in WO 98/58965. Other suitable scaffolds include lipocallin and CTLA4, as described in van den Beuken et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n310:591-601 (2001), and scaffolds such as those described in WO 00/69907 (Medical Research Council), which are based for example on the ring structure of bacterial GroEL or other chaperone polypeptides. Protein scaffolds may be combined; for example, CDRs may be grafted on to a CTLA4 scaffold and used together with immunoglobulin V\nH \nor V\nL \ndomains to form a ligand. Likewise, fibronectin, lipocallin and other scaffolds may be combined\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of suitable methods for preparing any desired format are known in the art. For example, antibody chains and formats (e.g., monospecific, bispecific, trispecific or tetraspecific IgG-like formats, chimeric antibodies, humanized antibodies, human antibodies, single chain antibodies, homodimers and heterodimers of antibody heavy chains and/or light chains) can be prepared by expression of suitable expression constructs and/or culture of suitable cells (e.g., hybridomas, heterohybridomas, recombinant host cells containing recombinant constructs encoding the format). Further, formats such as antigen-binding fragments of antibodies or antibody chains (e.g., bispecific binding fragments, such as a Fv fragment (e.g., single chain Fv (scFv), a disulfide bonded Fv), a Fab fragment, a Fab′ fragment, a F(ab′)\n2 \nfragment), can be prepared by expression of suitable expression constructs or by enzymatic digestion of antibodies, for example using papain or pepsin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ligand can be formatted as a multispecific ligand, for example as described in WO 03/002609, the entire teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference. Such multispecific ligand possesses more than one epitope binding specificity. Generally, the multi-specific ligand comprises two or more epitope binding domains, such dAbs or non-antibody protein domain comprising a binding site for an epitope, e.g., an affibody, a SpA domain, an LDL receptor class A domain, an EGF domain, an avimer. Multispecific ligands can be formatted further as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the ligand is an IgG-like format. Such formats have the conventional four chain structure of an IgG molecule (2 heavy chains and two light chains), in which one or more of the variable regions (V\nH \nand or V\nL\n) have been replaced with a dAb or immunoglobulin single variable domain of a desired specificity. In one embodiment, each of the variable regions (2 V\nH \nregions and 2 V\nL \nregions) is replaced with a dAb or immunoglobulin single variable domain. The dAb(s) or immunoglobulin single variable domain(s) that are included in an IgG-like format can have the same specificity or different specificities. In some embodiments, the IgG-like format is tetravalent and can have one, two, three or four specificities. The IgG-like format can be bispecific and comprise, for example, a first and second dAb that have the same specificity, a third dAb with a different specificity and a fourth dAb with a different specificity from the first, second and third dAbs; or tetraspecific and comprise four dAbs that each have a different specificity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe IgG-like format can be monospecific and comprise 4 dAbs that have the specificity for IL-4 or for IL-13. The IgG-like format can be bispecific and comprise, for example, 3 dAbs that have specificity for IL-4 and another dAb that has specificity for IL-13, or bispecific and comprise, for example two dAbs that have specificity for IL-4 and two dAbs that have specificity for IL-13. The IgG-like format can be bispecific and comprise, for example, 3 dAbs that have specificity for IL-13 and another dAb that has specificity for IL-14. When the IgG-like format contains two or more dAbs that bind IL-4, the dAbs can bind to the same or different epitopes. For example, the IgG-like format can comprise two, three or four dAbs that have binding specificity for IL-4 that bind the same or different epitopes on IL-4. Similarly, when the IgG-like format contains two or more dAbs that bind IL-13, the dAbs can bind to the same or different epitopes. For example, the IgG-like format can comprise two, three or four dAbs that have binding specificity for IL-13 that bind the same or different epitopes on IL-13.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one example, the IgG-like format is a tetravalent IgG-like ligand that has binding specificity for IL-4 or IL-13 comprising two heavy chains and two light chains, wherein said heavy chains comprise the constant region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain and a single immunoglobulin variable domain that has binding specificity for IL-4 or IL-13; and said light chains comprise the constant region of an immunoglobulin light chain and a single immunoglobulin variable domain that has binding specificity for IL-4 or IL-13. The IgG-like format of this example can be further characterized by the proviso that when said heavy chains comprise a single immunoglobulin variable domain that has binding specificity for IL-4, said light chains comprise a single immunoglobulin variable domain that has binding specificity for IL-13; and when said heavy chains comprise a single immunoglobulin variable domain that has binding specificity for IL-13, said light chains comprise a single immunoglobulin variable domain that has binding specificity for IL-4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntigen-binding fragments of IgG-like formats (e.g., Fab, F(ab′)\n2\n, Fab′, Fv, scF\nv\n) can be prepared. In addition, a particular constant region or Fc portion (e.g., constant region or Fc portion of an IgG, such as IgG1 (e.g., CH1, CH2 and CH3; CH2 and CH3)), variant or portion thereof can be selected in order to tailor effector function. For example, if complement activation and/or antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) function is desired, the ligand can be an IgG1-like format. If desired, the IgG-like format can comprise a mutated constant region (variant IgG heavy chain constant region) to minimize binding to Fc receptors and/or ability to fix complement. (see e.g. Winter et al, GB 2,209,757 B; Morrison et al., WO 89/07142; Morgan et al., WO 94/29351, Dec. 22, 1994).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ligands of the invention can be formatted as a fusion protein that contains a first immunoglobulin single variable domain that is fused directly (e.g., through a peptide bond) or through a suitable linker (amino acid, peptide, polypeptide) to a second immunoglobulin single variable domain. If desired such a format can further comprise, for example, one or more immunoglobulin domains (e.g., constant region, Fc portion) and/or a half life extending moiety as described herein. For example, the ligand can comprise a first immunoglobulin single variable domain that is fused directly to a second immunoglobulin single variable domain that is fused directly to an immunoglobulin single variable domain that binds serum albumin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one example, the ligand comprises a first single immunoglobulin single variable domain, a second immunoglobulin single variable domain and an Fc portion or an immunoglobulin constant region. The first and second immunoglobulin single variable domains can each have binding specificity for IL-4 or IL-13. Accordingly, this type of ligand can contain two binding sites (be bivalent) wherein each bindng site binds IL-13 or wherein one binding site binds IL-4 and one binding site binds IL-13. For example, the ligands can have the structure V domain-V domain-IgG constant region or V domain-V domain-IgG Fc portion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally the orientation of the polypeptide domains that have a binding site with binding specificity for a target and whether the ligand comprises a linker is a matter of design choice. However, some orientations, with or without linkers, may provide better binding characteristics than other orientations. All orientations (e.g., dAb1-linker-dAb2; dAb2-linker-dAb1) are encompassed by the invention, and ligands that contain an orientation that provides desired binding characteristics can be easily identified by screening.\n\n\n \nHalf-Life Extended Formats\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ligand, and dAb monomers disclosed herein, can be formatted to extend its in vivo serum half life. Increased in vivo half-life is useful in in vivo applications of immunoglobulins, especially antibodies and most especially antibody fragments of small size such as dAbs. Such fragments (Fvs, disulphide bonded Fvs, Fabs, scFvs, dAbs) are rapidly cleared from the body, which can limit clinical applications.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA ligand can be formatted as a larger antigen-binding fragment of an antibody or as an antibody (e.g., formatted as a Fab, Fab′, F(ab)\n2\n, F(ab′)\n2\n, IgG, scFv) that has larger hydrodynamic size. Ligands can also be formatted to have a larger hydrodynamic size, for example, by attachment of a polyalkyleneglycol group (e.g. polyethyleneglycol (PEG) group, polypropylene glycol, polybutylene glycol), serum albumin, transferrin, transferrin receptor or at least the transferrin-binding portion thereof, an antibody Fc region, or by conjugation to an antibody domain. In some embodiments, the ligand (e.g., dAb monomer) is PEGylated. In one embodiment the PEGylated ligand (e.g., dAb monomer) binds IL-4 and/or IL-13 with substantially the same affinity or avidity as the same ligand that is not PEGylated. For example, the ligand can be a PEGylated ligand comprising a dAb that binds IL-4 or IL-13 with an affinity or avidity that differs from the avidity of ligand in unPEGylated form by no more than a factor of about 1000, in one embodiment no more than a factor of about 100, or no more than a factor of about 10, or with affinity or avidity substantially unchanged relative to the unPEGylated form. See, PCT/GB03/002804, filed Jun. 30, 2003, which designated the United States, (WO 2004/081026) regarding PEGylated single variable domains and dAbs, suitable methods for preparing same, increased in vivo half-life of the PEGylated single variable domains and dAb monomers and multimers, suitable PEGs, possible hydrodynamic sizes of PEGs, and possible hydrodynamic sizes of PEGylated single variable domains and dAb monomers and multimers. The entire teaching of PCT/GB03/002804 (WO 2004/081026), including the portions referred to above, are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHydrodynamic size of the ligands (e.g., dAb monomers and multimers) of the invention may be determined using methods which are well known in the art. For example, gel filtration chromatography may be used to determine the hydrodynamic size of a ligand. Suitable gel filtration matrices for determining the hydrodynamic sizes of ligands, such as cross-linked agarose matrices, are well known and readily available.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe size of a ligand format (e.g., the size of a PEG moiety attached to a dAb monomer), can be varied depending on the desired application. For example, where a ligand is intended to leave the circulation and enter into peripheral tissues, it is desirable to keep the hydrodynamic size of the ligand low to facilitate diffusion from the blood stream. Alternatively, where it is desired to have the ligand remain in the systemic circulation for a longer period of time the size of the ligand can be increased, for example by formatting as an IgG-like protein or by addition of a 30 to 60 kDa PEG moiety (e.g., linear or branched 30 kDa PEG to 40 kDa PEG, such as addition of two 20 kDa PEG moieties.) The size of the ligand format can be tailored to achieve a desired in vivo serum half-life. For example, the size of the ligand format can be tailored to control exposure to a toxin and/or to reduce side effects of toxic agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe hydrodynamic size of a ligand (e.g., dAb monomer) and its serum half-life can also be increased by conjugating or linking the ligand to a binding domain (e.g., antibody or antibody fragment) that binds an antigen or epitope that increases half-life in vivo, as described herein. For example, the ligand (e.g., dAb monomer) can be conjugated or linked to an anti-serum albumin or anti-neonatal Fc receptor antibody or antibody fragment, (e.g., an anti-SA or anti-neonatal Fc receptor dAb, Fab, Fab′ or scFv), or to an anti-SA affibody or anti-neonatal Fc receptor affibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of suitable albumin, albumin fragments or albumin variants for use in a ligand according to the invention are described in WO 2005/077042A2, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In particular, the following albumin, albumin fragments or albumin variants can be used in the present invention:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nSEQ ID NO:1 (as disclosed in WO 2005/077042A2, this sequence being explicitly incorporated into the present disclosure by reference);\n \nAlbumin fragment or variant comprising or consisting of amino acids 1-387 of SEQ ID NO:1 in WO 2005/077042A2;\n \nAlbumin, or fragment or variant thereof, comprising an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of: (a) amino acids 54 to 61 of SEQ ID NO:1 in WO 20051077042A2; (b) amino acids 76 to 89 of SEQ ID NO:1 in WO 2005/077042A2; (c) amino acids 92 to 100 of SEQ ID NO:1 in WO 2005/077042A2: (d) amino acids 170 to 176 of SEQ ID NO:1 in WO 2005/077042A2; (e) amino acids 247 to 252 of SEQ ID NO:1 in WO 2005/077042A2: (f) amino acids 266 to 277 of SEQ ID NO:1 in WO 2005/077042A2; (g) amino acids 280 to 288 of SEQ ID NO:1 in WO 2005/077042A2; (h) amino acids 362 to 368 of SEQ ID NO:1 in WO 2005/077042A2; (i) amino acids 439 to 447 of SEQ ID NO:1 in WO 2005/077042A2 (j) amino acids 462 to 475 of SEQ ID NO:1 in WO 2005/077042A2; (k) amino acids 478 to 486 of SEQ ID NO:1 in WO 2005/077042A2; and (l) amino acids 560 to 566 of SEQ ID NO:1 in WO 2005/077042A2.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nFurther examples of suitable albumin, fragments and analogs for use in a ligand according to the invention are described in WO 03/076567A2, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In particular, the following albumin, fragments or variants can be used in the present invention:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nHuman serum albumin as described in WO 03/076567A2, (e.g., in \nFIG. 3\n) (this sequence information being explicitly incorporated into the present disclosure by reference);\n \nHuman serum albumin (HA) consisting of a single non-glycosylated polypeptide chain of 585 amino acids with a formula molecular weight of 66,500 (See, Meloun, et al., \nFEBS Letters \n58:136 (1975); Behrens, et al., \nFed. Proc. \n34:591 (1975); Lawn, et al., \nNucleic Acids Research \n9:6102-6114 (1981); Minghetti, et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n261:6747 (1986));\n \nA polymorphic variant or analog or fragment of albumin as described in Weitkamp, et al., \nAnn. Hum. Genet. \n37:219 (1973);\n \nAn albumin fragment or variant as described in EP 322094, (e.g., HA(1-373), HA(1-388), HA(1-389), HA(1-369), and HA(1-419) and fragments between 1-369 and 1-419);\n \nAn albumin fragment or variant as described in EP 399666, (e.g., HA(1-177) and HA(1-200) and fragments between HA(1-X), where X is any number from 178 to 199).\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nWhere a (one or more) half-life extending moiety (e.g., albumin, transferrin and fragments and analogs thereof) is used in the ligands of the invention, it can be conjugated to the ligand using any suitable method, such as, by direct fusion to the target-binding moiety (e.g., dAb or antibody fragment), for example by using a single nucleotide construct that encodes a fusion protein, wherein the fusion protein is encoded as a single polypeptide chain with the half-life extending moiety located N- or C-terminally to the cell surface target binding moieties. Alternatively, conjugation can be achieved by using a peptide linker between moieties, (e.g., a peptide linker as described in WO 03/076567A2 or WO 2004/003019) (these linker disclosures being incorporated by reference in the present disclosure to provide examples for use in the present invention).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypically, a polypeptide that enhances serum half-life in vivo is a polypeptide which occurs naturally in vivo and which resists degradation or removal by endogenous mechanisms which remove unwanted material from the organism (e.g., human). For example, a polypeptide that enhances serum half-life in vivo can be selected from proteins from the extracellular matrix, proteins found in blood, proteins found at the blood brain barrier or in neural tissue, proteins localized to the kidney, liver, lung, heart, skin or bone, stress proteins, disease-specific proteins, or proteins involved in Fc transport.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable polypeptides that enhance serum half-life in vivo include, for example, transferrin receptor specific ligand-neuropharmaceutical agent fusion proteins (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,977,307, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference), brain capillary endothelial cell receptor, transferrin, transferrin receptor (e.g., soluble transferrin receptor), insulin, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF 1) receptor, insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF 2) receptor, insulin receptor, blood coagulation factor X, α1-antitrypsin and HNF 1α. Suitable polypeptides that enhance serum half-life also include alpha-1 glycoprotein (orosomucoid; AAG), alpha-1 antichymotrypsin (ACT), alpha-1 microglobulin (protein HC; AIM), antithrombin III (AT III), apolipoprotein A-1 (Apo A-1), apolipoprotein B (Apo B), ceruloplasmin (Cp), complement component C3 (C3), complement component C4 (C4), C1 esterase inhibitor (C1 INH), C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin (FER), hemopexin (HPX), lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)), mannose-binding protein (MBP), myoglobin (Myo), prealbumin (transthyretin; PAL), retinol-binding protein (RBP), and rheumatoid factor (RF).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable proteins from the extracellular matrix include, for example, collagens, laminins, integrins and fibronectin. Collagens are the major proteins of the extracellular matrix. About 15 types of collagen molecules are currently known, found in different parts of the body, e.g. type I collagen (accounting for 90% of body collagen) found in bone, skin, tendon, ligaments, cornea, internal organs or type II collagen found in cartilage, vertebral disc, notochord, and vitreous humor of the eye.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable proteins from the blood include, for example, plasma proteins (e.g., fibrin, α-2 macroglobulin, serum albumin, fibrinogen (e.g., fibrinogen A, fibrinogen B), serum amyloid protein A, haptoglobin, profilin, ubiquitin, uteroglobulin and β-2-microglobulin), enzymes and enzyme inhibitors (e.g., plasminogen, lysozyme, cystatin C, alpha-1-antitrypsin and pancreatic trypsin inhibitor), proteins of the immune system, such as immunoglobulin proteins (e.g., IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, IgM, immunoglobulin light chains (kappa/lambda)), transport proteins (e.g., retinol binding protein, α-1 microglobulin), defensins (e.g., beta-\ndefensin\n 1, \nneutrophil defensin\n 1, \nneutrophil defensin\n 2 and neutrophil defensin 3) and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable proteins found at the blood brain barrier or in neural tissue include, for example, melanocortin receptor, myelin, ascorbate transporter and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable polypeptides that enhance serum half-life in vivo also include proteins localized to the kidney (e.g., polycystin, type IV collagen, organic anion transporter KI, Heymann's antigen), proteins localized to the liver (e.g., alcohol dehydrogenase, G250), proteins localized to the lung (e.g., secretory component, which binds IgA), proteins localized to the heart (e.g., HSP 27, which is associated with dilated cardiomyopathy), proteins localized to the skin (e.g., keratin), bone specific proteins such as morphogenic proteins (BMPs), which are a subset of the transforming growth factor β superfamily of proteins that demonstrate osteogenic activity (e.g., BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-5, BMP-6, BMP-7, BMP-8), tumor specific proteins (e.g., trophoblast antigen, herceptin receptor, oestrogen receptor, cathepsins (e.g., cathepsin B, which can be found in liver and spleen)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable disease-specific proteins include, for example, antigens expressed only on activated T-cells, including LAG-3 (lymphocyte activation gene), osteoprotegerin ligand (OPGL; see \nNature \n402, 304-309 (1999)), OX40 (a member of the TNF receptor family, expressed on activated T cells and specifically up-regulated in human T cell leukemia virus type-I (HTLV-I)-producing cells; see \nImmunol. \n165 (1):263-70 (2000)). Suitable disease-specific proteins also include, for example, metalloproteases (associated with arthritis/cancers) including CG6512 \nDrosophila\n, human paraplegin, human FtsH, human AFG3L2, murine ftsH; and angiogenic growth factors, including acidic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-1), basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2), vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular permeability factor (VEGF/VPF), transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-α), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), angiogenin, interleukin-3 (IL-3), interleukin-8 (IL-8), platelet-derived endothelial growth factor (PD-ECGF), placental growth factor (P1GF), midkine platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF), and fractalkine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable polypeptides that enhance serum half-life in vivo also include stress proteins such as heat shock proteins (HSPs). HSPs are normally found intracellularly. When they are found extracellularly, it is an indicator that a cell has died and spilled out its contents. This unprogrammed cell death (necrosis) occurs when as a result of trauma, disease or injury, extracellular HSPs trigger a response from the immune system. Binding to extracellular HSP can result in localizing the compositions of the invention to a disease site.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable proteins involved in Fc transport include, for example, Brambell receptor (also known as FcRB). This Fc receptor has two functions, both of which are potentially useful for delivery. The functions are (1) transport of IgG from mother to child across the placenta (2) protection of IgG from degradation thereby prolonging its serum half-life. It is thought that the receptor recycles IgG from endosomes. (See, Holliger et al, \nNat Biotechnol \n15(7):632-6 (1997).)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for pharmacokinetic analysis and determination of ligand half-life will be familiar to those skilled in the art. Details may be found in Kenneth, A. et al: Chemical Stability of Pharmaceuticals: A Handbook for Pharmacists and in Peters et al, Pharmacokinetic Analysis: A Practical Approach (1996). Reference is also made to “Pharmacokinetics”, M Gibaldi & D Perron, published by Marcel Dekker, 2\nnd \nRev. ex edition (1982), which describes pharmacokinetic parameters such as t alpha and t beta half lives and area under the curve (AUC).\n\n\n \n \nLigands that Contain a Toxin Moiety or Toxin\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also relates to ligands that comprise a toxin moiety or toxin. Suitable toxin moieties comprise a toxin (e.g., surface active toxin, cytotoxin). The toxin moiety or toxin can be linked or conjugated to the ligand using any suitable method. For example, the toxin moiety or toxin can be covalently bonded to the ligand directly or through a suitable linker. Suitable linkers can include noncleavable or cleavable linkers, for example, pH cleavable linkers that comprise a cleavage site for a cellular enzyme (e.g., cellular esterases, cellular proteases such as cathepsin B). Such cleavable linkers can be used to prepare a ligand that can release a toxin moiety or toxin after the ligand is internalized.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of methods for linking or conjugating a toxin moiety or toxin to a ligand can be used. The particular method selected will depend on the toxin moiety or toxin and ligand to be linked or conjugated. If desired, linkers that contain terminal functional groups can be used to link the ligand and toxin moiety or toxin. Generally, conjugation is accomplished by reacting toxin moiety or toxin that contains a reactive functional group (or is modified to contain a reactive functional group) with a linker or directly with a ligand. Covalent bonds formed by reacting a toxin moiety or toxin that contains (or is modified to contain) a chemical moiety or functional group that can, under appropriate conditions, react with a second chemical group thereby forming a covalent bond. If desired, a suitable reactive chemical group can be added to ligand or to a linker using any suitable method. (See, e.g., Hermanson, G. T., \nBioconjugate Techniques\n, Academic Press: San Diego, Calif. (1996).) Many suitable reactive chemical group combinations are known in the art, for example an amine group can react with an electrophilic group such as tosylate, mesylate, halo(chloro, bromo, fluoro, iodo), N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester (NHS), and the like. Thiols can react with maleimide, iodoacetyl, acrylolyl, pyridyl disulfides, 5-thiol-2-nitrobenzoic acid thiol (TNB-thiol), and the like. An aldehyde functional group can be coupled to amine- or hydrazide-containing molecules, and an azide group can react with a trivalent phosphorous group to form phosphoramidate or phosphorimide linkages. Suitable methods to introduce activating groups into molecules are known in the art (see for example, Hermanson, G. T., \nBioconjugate Techniques\n, Academic Press: San Diego, Calif.

Maytansinol and maytansinol analogs are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,208,020 and 6,333,410, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. Maytansinol can be coupled to antibodies and antibody fragmetns using, e.g., an N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio)proprionate (also known as N-succinimidyl 4-(2-pyridyldithio)pentanoate (or SPP), 4-succinimidyl-oxycarbonyl-a-(2-pyridyldithio)-toluene (SMPT), N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio)butyrate (SDPB), 2 iminothiolane, or S-acetylsuccinic anhydride.

The non-immunoglobulin domain can comprise an amino acid sequence that has one or more regions that have sequence identity to one, two or three of the CDRs of an anti-IL-4 dAb described herein. For example, the non-immunoglobulin domain can have an amino acid sequence that contains at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, or at least about 90% sequence identity with CDR1, CDR2 and/or CDR3 of an anti-IL-4 dAb disclosed herein. In one embodiment, the non-immunoglobulin binding moiety comprises one, two, or three of the CDRs of DOM9-44-502 (SEQ ID NO:512), DOM9-155-5 (SEQ ID NO:605), DOM9-155-25 (SEQ ID NO:617), DOM9-1,2-155 (SEQ ID NO:292), DOM9-1,2-168 (SEQ ID NO:305), DOM9-1,2-174 (SEQ ID NO:311), DOM9-1,2-199 (SEQ ID NO:336), and DOM9-1,2-200 (SEQ ID NO:337) disclosed in WO2007/085815A2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 is substantially resistant to aggregation. For example, in some embodiments, less than about 10%, less than about 9%, less than about 8%, less than about 7%, less than about 6%, less than about 5%, less than about 4%, less than about 3%, less than about 2% or less than about 1% of the polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 aggregates when a 1-5 mg/ml, 5-10 mg/ml, 10-20 mg/ml, 20-50 mg/ml, 50-100 mg/ml, 100-200 mg/ml or 200-500 mg/ml solution of ligand or dAb in a solvent that is routinely used for drug formulation such as saline, buffered saline, citrate buffer saline, water, an emulsion, and, any of these solvents with an acceptable excipient such as those approved by the FDA, is maintained at about 22° C., 22-25° C., 25-30° C., 30-37° C., 37-40° C., 40-50° C., 50-60° C., 60-70° C., 70-80° C., 15-20° C., 10-15° C., 5-10° C., 2-5° C., 0-2° C., −10° C. to 0° C., −20° C. to −10° C., −40° C. to −20° C., −60° C. to −40° C., or −80° C. to −60° C., for a period of about time, for example, 10 minutes, 1 hour, 8 hours, 24 hours, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 4 months, 6 months, 1 year, or 2 years.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAggregation can be assessed using any suitable method, such as, by microscopy, assessing turbidity of a solution by visual inspection or spectroscopy or any other suitable method. In one embodiment, aggregation is assessed by dynamic light scattering. Polypeptide domains that have a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 that are resistant to aggregation provide several advantages. For example, such polypeptide domains that have a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 can readily be produced in high yield as soluble proteins by expression using a suitable biological production system, such as \nE. coli\n, and can be formulated and/or stored at higher concentrations than conventional polypeptides, and with less aggregation and loss of activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, the polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 that is resistant to aggregation can be produced more economically than other antigen- or epitope-binding polypeptides (e.g., conventional antibodies). For example, generally, preparation of antigen- or epitope-binding polypeptides intended for in vivo applications includes processes (e.g., gel filtration) that remove aggregated polypeptides. Failure to remove such aggregates can result in a preparation that is not suitable for in vivo applications because, for example, aggregates of an antigen-binding polypeptide that is intended to act as an antagonist can function as an agonist by inducing cross-linking or clustering of the target antigen. Protein aggregates can also reduce the efficacy of therapeutic polypeptide by inducing an immune response in the subject to which they are administered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn contrast, the aggregation resistant polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 of the invention can be prepared for in vivo applications without the need to include process steps that remove aggregates, and can be used in in vivo applications without the aforementioned disadvantages caused by polypeptide aggregates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 unfolds reversibly when heated to a temperature (Ts) and cooled to a temperature (Tc), wherein Ts is greater than the melting temperature (Tm) of the polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4, and Tc is lower than the melting temperature of the polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4. For example, a polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 can unfold reversibly when heated to 80° C. and cooled to about room temperature. A polypeptide that unfolds reversibly loses function when unfolded but regains function upon refolding. Such polypeptides are distinguished from polypeptides that aggregate when unfolded or that improperly refold (misfolded polypeptides), i.e., do not regain function.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolypeptide unfolding and refolding can be assessed, for example, by directly or indirectly detecting polypeptide structure using any suitable method. For example, polypeptide structure can be detected by circular dichroism (CD) (e.g., far-UV CD, near-UV CD), fluorescence (e.g., fluorescence of tryptophan side chains), susceptibility to proteolysis, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), or by detecting or measuring a polypeptide function that is dependent upon proper folding (e.g., binding to target ligand, binding to generic ligand). In one example, polypeptide unfolding is assessed using a functional assay in which loss of binding function (e.g., binding a generic and/or target ligand, binding a substrate) indicates that the polypeptide is unfolded.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe extent of unfolding and refolding of a polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 can be determined using an unfolding or denaturation curve. An unfolding curve can be produced by plotting temperature as the ordinate and the relative concentration of folded polypeptide as the abscissa. The relative concentration of folded polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 can be determined directly or indirectly using any suitable method (e.g., CD, fluorescence, binding assay). For example, a polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 solution can be prepared and ellipticity of the solution determined by CD. The ellipticity value obtained represents a relative concentration of folded ligand or dAb monomer of 100%. The polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 in the solution is then unfolded by incrementally raising the temperature of the solution and ellipticity is determined at suitable increments (e.g., after each increase of one degree in temperature). The polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 in solution is then refolded by incrementally reducing the temperature of the solution and ellipticity is determined at suitable increments. The data can be plotted to produce an unfolding curve and a refolding curve. The unfolding and refolding curves have a characteristic sigmoidal shape that includes a portion in which the polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 molecules is folded, an unfolding/refolding transition in which the polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 molecules is unfolded to various degrees, and a portion in which polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 is unfolded. The y-axis intercept of the refolding curve is the relative amount of refolded polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 recovered. A recovery of at least about 50%, or at least about 60%, or at least about 70%, or at least about 75%, or at least about 80%, or at least about 85%, or at least about 90%, or at least about 95% is indicative that the ligand or dAb monomer unfolds reversibly.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a possible embodiment, reversibility of unfolding of polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 is determined by preparing a polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 solution and plotting heat unfolding and refolding curves. The polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 solution can be prepared in any suitable solvent, such as an aqueous buffer that has a pH suitable to allow polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 to dissolve (e.g., pH that is about 3 units above or below the isoelectric point (pI)). The polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 solution is concentrated enough to allow unfolding/folding to be detected. For example, the ligand or dAb monomer solution can be about 0.1 μM to about 100 μM, or about 1 μM to about 10 μM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf the melting temperature (Tm) of the polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 is known, the solution can be heated to about ten degrees below the Tm (Tm-10) and folding assessed by ellipticity or fluorescence (e.g., far-UV CD scan from 200 nm to 250 nm, fixed wavelength CD at 235 nm or 225 nm; tryptophan fluorescent emission spectra at 300 to 450 nm with excitation at 298 nm) to provide 100% relative folded ligand or dAb monomer. The solution is then heated to at least ten degrees above Tm (Tm+10) in predetermined increments (e.g., increases of about 0.1 to about 1 degree), and ellipticity or fluorescence is determined at each increment. Then, the polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 is refolded by cooling to at least Tm-10 in predetermined increments and ellipticity or fluorescence determined at each increment. If the melting temperature of the polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 is not known, the solution can be unfolded by incrementally heating from about 25° C. to about 100° C. and then refolded by incrementally cooling to at least about 25° C., and ellipticity or fluorescence at each heating and cooling increment is determined. The data obtained can be plotted to produce an unfolding curve and a refolding curve, in which the y-axis intercept of the refolding curve is the relative amount of refolded protein recovered. In some embodiments, the polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for VEGF does not comprise a Camelid immunoglobulin variable domain, or one or more framework amino acids that are unique to immunoglobulin variable domains encoded by Camelid germ line antibody gene segments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 is secreted in a quantity of at least about 0.5 mg/L when expressed in \nE. coli \nor in \nPichia \nspecies (e.g., \nP. pastoris\n).

Although, polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-4 described herein can be secretable when expressed in \nE. coli \nor in \nPichia \nspecies (e.g., \nP. pastoris\n), they can be produced using any suitable method, such as synthetic chemical methods or biological production methods that do not employ \nE. coli \nor \nPichia \nspecies.\n\n\n \n \nPolypeptide Domains that Bind IL-13\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention provides polypeptide domains (e.g., dAb) that have a binding site with binding specificity for IL-13.

In other examples, the polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-13 has the epitopic specificity of a dAb selected from the group consisting of DOM10-275-78 (SEQ ID NO:6), DOM10-275-94 (SEQ ID NO:7), DOM10-275-99 (SEQ ID NO:8), DOM10-275-100 (SEQ ID NO:9) and DOM10-275-101 (SEQ ID NO:10), and optionally DOM10-53-474 (SEQ ID NO:1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-13 (e.g., a dAb) comprises an amino acid sequence that has at least about 70%, at least about 75%, at least about 80%, at least about 85%, at least about 90%, at least about 91%, at least about 92%, at least about 93%, at least about 94%, at least about 95%, at least about 96%, at least about 97%, at least about 98%, or at least about 99% amino acid sequence identity with the amino acid sequence or a dAb selected from the group consisting of DOM10-275-78 (SEQ ID NO:6), DOM10-275-94 (SEQ ID NO:7), DOM10-275-99 (SEQ ID NO:8), DOM10-275-100 (SEQ ID NO:9) and DOM10-275-101 (SEQ ID NO:10), and optionally DOM10-53-474 (SEQ ID NO:1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-13 competes with any of the dAbs disclosed herein for binding to IL-13.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-13 is an immunoglobulin single variable domain. The polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-13 can comprise any suitable immunoglobulin variable domain, and in one embodiment comprises a human variable domain or a variable domain that comprises human framework regions. In certain embodiments, the polypeptide domain that has a binding site with binding specificity for IL-13 comprises a universal framework, as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ligand of the invention (e.g., ligand that has binding specificity for IL-4 and IL-13, ligand that has binding specificity for IL-13) can comprise a non-immunoglobulin binding moiety that has binding specificity for IL-13 and inhibits a function of IL-13 (e.g., binding to receptor), wherein the non-immunoglobulin binding moiety comprises one, two or three of the CDRs of a V\nH\n, V\nL \nor V\nHH \nthat binds IL-13 and a suitable scaffold. In certain embodiments, the non-immunoglobulin binding moiety comprises CDR3 but not CDR1 or CDR2 of a V\nH\n, V\nL \nor V\nHH \nthat binds IL-13 and a suitable scaffold. In other embodiments, the non-immunoglobulin binding moiety comprises CDR1 and CDR2, but not CDR3 of a V\nH\n, V\nL \nor V\nHH \nthat binds IL-13 and a suitable scaffold. In other embodiments, the non-immunoglobulin binding moiety comprises CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 of a V\nH\n, V\nL \nor V\nHH \nthat binds IL-13 and a suitable scaffold. In one embodiment, the CDR or CDRs of the ligand of these embodiments is a CDR or CDRs of an anti-IL-13 dAb described herein. In one embodiment, the non-immunoglobulin binding moiety comprises one, two, or three of the CDRs of one of the anti-IL-13 dAbs disclosed herein. In other embodiments, the ligand (e.g., ligand that has binding specificity for IL-4 and IL-13, ligand that has binding specificity for IL-13) comprises only CDR3 of a V\nH\n, V\nL \nor V\nHH \nthat binds IL-13. The non-immunoglobulin domain can comprise an amino acid sequence that has one or more regions that have sequence identity to one, two or three of the CDRs of an anti-IL-13 dAb described herein.

Crowe, \nGene, \n101: 297-302 (1991)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acids referred to herein as “recombinant” are nucleic acids which have been produced by recombinant DNA methodology, including those nucleic acids that are generated by procedures which rely upon a method of artificial recombination, such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or cloning into a vector using restriction enzymes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the isolated and/or recombinant nucleic acid comprises a nucleotide sequence encoding a ligand, as described herein, wherein said ligand comprises an amino acid sequence that has at least about 80%, at least about 85%, at least about 90%, at least about 91%, at least about 92%, at least about 93%, at least about 94%, at least about 95%, at least about 96%, at least about 97%, at least about 98%, or at least about 99% amino acid sequence identity with the amino acid sequence of a dAb that binds IL-4 disclosed herein, or a dAb that binds IL-13 disclosed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, in some embodiments, the isolated and/or recombinant nucleic acid comprises a nucleotide sequence encoding a ligand that has binding specificity for IL-4, as described herein, wherein said ligand comprises an amino acid sequence that has at least about 80%, at least about 85%, at least about 90%, at least about 91%, at least about 92%, at least about 93%, at least about 94%, at least about 95%, at least about 96%, at least about 97%, at least about 98%, or at least about 99% amino acid sequence identity with the amino acid sequence of a dAb selected from the group consisting of those DOM9 dAbs referred to above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the isolated and/or recombinant nucleic acid comprises a nucleotide sequence encoding a ligand that has binding specificity for IL-13, as described herein, wherein said ligand comprises an amino acid sequence that has at least about 70%, at least about 75%, at least about 80%, at least about 85%, at least about 90%, at least about 91%, at least about 92%, at least about 93%, at least about 94%, at least about 95%, at least about 96%, at least about 97%, at least about 98%, or at least about 99% amino acid sequence identity with the amino acid sequence of a dAb selected from the group consisting of DOM10-275-78 (SEQ ID NO:6), DOM10-275-94 (SEQ ID NO:7), DOM10-275-99 (SEQ ID NO:8), DOM10-275-100 (SEQ ID NO:9) and DOM10-275-101 (SEQ ID NO:10), and optionally DOM10-53-474 (SEQ ID NO: 1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the isolated and/or recombinant nucleic acid comprises a nucleotice sequence encoding a ligand that has binding specificity for IL-4, as described herein, wherein said nucleotide sequence has at least about 70%, at least about 75%, at least about 80%, at least about 85%, at least about 90%, at least about 91%, at least about 92%, at least about 93%, at least about 94%, at least about 95%, at least about 96%, at least about 97%, at least about 98%, or at least about 99% nucleotide sequence identity with a nucleotide sequence encoding an anti-IL-4 dAb selected from the group consisting of the DOM9 dAbs referred to above.

Codon optimization of sequences is known in the art. In one embodiment, the nucleotide sequence is optimized for expression in a bacterial (e.g., \nE. coli \nor \nPseudomonas \nsp., e.g., \nP. fluorescens\n), mammalian (e.g., CHO) or yeast host cell (e.g., \nPicchia \nor \nSaccharomyces\n, e.g., \nP. pastoris \nor \nS. cerevisiae\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs described above, embodiments of the invention provide codon optimized nucleotide sequences encoding polypeptides and variable domains of the invention. Codon optimized sequences of about 70% identity can be produced that encode for the same variable domain (e.g., encode for DOM10-275-78 (SEQ ID NO:6), DOM10-275-94 (SEQ ID NO:7), DOM10-275-99 (SEQ ID NO:8), DOM10-275-100 (SEQ ID NO:9) and DOM10-275-101 (SEQ ID NO:10)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides a vector comprising a recombinant nucleic acid molecule of the invention. In certain embodiments, the vector is an expression vector comprising one or more expression control elements or sequences that are operably linked to the recombinant nucleic acid of the invention The invention also provides a recombinant host cell comprising a recombinant nucleic acid molecule or vector of the invention. Suitable vectors (e.g., plasmids, phagmids), expression control elements, host cells and methods for producing recombinant host cells of the invention are well-known in the art, and examples are further described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable expression vectors can contain a number of components, for example, an origin of replication, a selectable marker gene, one or more expression control elements, such as a transcription control element (e.g., promoter, enhancer, terminator) and/or one or more translation signals, a signal sequence or leader sequence, and the like. Expression control elements and a signal sequence, if present, can be provided by the vector or other source. For example, the transcriptional and/or translational control sequences of a cloned nucleic acid encoding an antibody chain can be used to direct expression.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA promoter can be provided for expression in a desired host cell. Promoters can be constitutive or inducible. For example, a promoter can be operably linked to a nucleic acid encoding an antibody, antibody chain or portion thereof, such that it directs transcription of the nucleic acid. A variety of suitable promoters for prokaryotic (e.g., lac, tac, T3, T7 promoters for \nE. coli\n) and eukaryotic (e.g., \nSimian Virus\n 40 early or late promoter, Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat promoter, cytomegalovirus promoter, adenovirus late promoter) hosts are available.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, expression vectors typically comprise a selectable marker for selection of host cells carrying the vector, and, in the case of a replicable expression vector, an origin of replication. Genes encoding products which confer antibiotic or drug resistance are common selectable markers and may be used in prokaryotic (e.g. lactamase gene (ampicillin resistance), Tet gene for tetracycline resistance) and eukaryotic cells (e.g., neomycin (G418 or geneticin), gpt (mycophenolic acid), ampicillin, or hygromycin resistance genes). Dihydrofolate reductase marker genes permit selection with methotrexate in a variety of hosts. Genes encoding the gene product of auxotrophic markers of the host (e.g., LEU2, URA3, HIS3) are often used as selectable markers in yeast. Use of viral (e.g., baculovirus) or phage vectors, and vectors which are capable of integrating into the genome of the host cell, such as retroviral vectors, are also contemplated. Suitable expression vectors for expression in mammalian cells and prokaryotic cells (\nE. coli\n), insect cells (Drosophila Schnieder S2 cells, Sf9) and yeast (\nP. methanolica, P. pastoris, S. cerevisiae\n) are well-known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable host cells can be prokaryotic, including bacterial cells such as \nE. coli, B. subtilis \nand/or other suitable bacteria; eukaryotic cells, such as fungal or yeast cells (e.g., \nPichia pastoris, Aspergillus \nsp., \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Neurospora crassa\n), or other lower eukaryotic cells, and cells of higher eukaryotes such as those from insects (e.g., \nDrosophila \nSchnieder S2 cells, Sf9 insect cells (WO 94/26087 (O'Connor)), mammals (e.g., COS cells, such as COS-1 (ATCC Accession No. CRL-1650) and COS-7 (ATCC Accession No. CRL-1651), CHO (e.g., ATCC Accession No. CRL-9096, CHO DG44 (Urlaub, G. and Chasin, L A., \nProc. Natl. Acac. Sci. USA, \n77(7):4216-4220 (1980))), 293 (ATCC Accession No. CRL-1573), HeLa (ATCC Accession No. CCL-2), CV1 (ATCC Accession No. CCL-70), WOP (Dailey, L., et al., \nJ.

(See, for example, Ausubel, F. M. et al., eds. \nCurrent Protocols in Molecular Biology\n, Greene Publishing Associates and John Wiley & Sons Inc. (1993).) In some embodiments, the host cell is an isolated host cell and is not part of a multicellular organism (e.g., plant or animal). In possible embodiments, the host cell is a non-human host cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides a method for producing a ligand (e.g., dual-specific ligand, multispecific ligand) of the invention, comprising maintaining a recombinant host cell comprising a recombinant nucleic acid of the invention under conditions suitable for expression of the recombinant nucleic acid, whereby the recombinant nucleic acid is expressed and a ligand is produced. In some embodiments, the method further comprises isolating the ligand.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following sections of W02007/085815A2, are referred to for use with the present invention and these disclosures are incorporated herein by reference as though written herein verbatim and to provide disclosure for inclusion in claims herein:\n\n\n \nPreparation of Immunoglobulin Based Ligands\n\n\n \n \n \nLibrary vector systems\n\n\n \nLibrary Construction\n\n\nCharacterisation of Ligands\n\n\nScaffolds for Use in Constructing Ligands\n\n\nSelection of the Main-chain Conformation\n\n\nDiversification of the Canonical Sequence\n\n\nDiversification of the Canonical Sequence as it Applies to Antibody Domains\n\n\nCombining Single Variable Domains\n\n\n \n \n \nDomains useful in the invention, once selected, may be combined by a variety of methods known in the art, including covalent and non-covalent methods. Possible methods include the use of polypeptide linkers, as described, for example, in connection with scFv molecules (Bird et al., (1988) Science 242:423-426). Discussion of suitable linkers is provided in Bird et al. \nScience \n242, 423-426; Hudson et al, \nJournal Immunol Methods \n231 (1999) 177-189; Hudson et al, \nProc. Nat. Acad. Sci. \n85, 5879-5883. Linkers are in one embodiment flexible, allowing the two single domains to interact. One linker example is a (Gly\n4 \nSer)\nn \nlinker, where n=1 to 8, e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5 or 7. The linkers used in diabodies, which are less flexible, may also be employed (Holliger et al., (1993) \nProc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. \n90:6444-6448). In one embodiment, the linker employed is not an immunoglobulin hinge region.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVariable domains may be combined using methods other than linkers. For example, the use of disulphide bridges, provided through naturally-occurring or engineered cysteine residues, may be exploited to stabilize V\nH\n-V\nH\n, V\nL\n-V\nL \nor V\nH\n-V\nL \ndimers (Reiter et al., (1994) \nProtein Eng. \n7:697-704) or by remodelling the interface between the variable domains to improve the “fit” and thus the stability of interaction (Ridgeway et al., (1996) \nProtein Eng. \n7:617-621; Zhu et al., (1997) \nProtein Science \n6:781-788). Other techniques for joining or stabilizing variable domains of immunoglobulins, and in particular antibody V\nH \ndomains, may be employed as appropriate.\n\n\n \nStructure of Ligands\n\n\n \n \n \nIn the case that each variable domain is selected from V-gene repertoires selected for instance using phage display technology as herein described, then these variable domains comprise a universal framework region, such that is they may be recognized by a generic ligand as herein defined. The use of universal frameworks, generic ligands and the like is described in WO99/20749.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere V-gene repertoires are used, variation in polypeptide sequence is in one embodiment located within the structural loops of the variable domains. The polypeptide sequences of either variable domain may be altered by DNA shuffling or by mutation in order to enhance the interaction of each variable domain with its complementary pair. DNA shuffling is known in the art and taught, for example, by Stemmer, 1994\n, Nature \n370: 389-391 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,297,053, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. Other methods of mutagenesis are well known to those of skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, nucleic acid molecules and vector constructs required for selection, preparation and formatting dual-specific ligands may be constructed and manipulated as set forth in standard laboratory manuals, such as Sambrook et al. (1989) \nMolecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual\n, Cold Spring Harbor, USA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe manipulation of nucleic acids useful in the present invention is typically carried out in recombinant vectors. As used herein, vector refers to a discrete element that is used to introduce heterologous DNA into cells for the expression and/or replication thereof. Methods by which to select or construct and, subsequently, use such vectors are well known to one of ordinary skill in the art. Numerous vectors are publicly available, including bacterial plasmids, bacteriophage, artificial chromosomes and episomal vectors. Such vectors may be used for simple cloning and mutagenesis; alternatively a gene expression vector is employed. A vector of use according to the invention may be selected to accommodate a polypeptide coding sequence of a desired size, typically from 0.25 kilobase (kb) to 40 kb or more in length. A suitable host cell is transformed with the vector after in vitro cloning manipulations. Each vector contains various functional components, which generally include a cloning (or “polylinker”) site, an origin of replication and at least one selectable marker gene. If the given vector is an expression vector, it additionally possesses one or more of the following: an enhancer element, a promoter, transcription, termination and signal sequences, each positioned in the vicinity of the cloning site, such that they are operatively linked to the gene encoding a dual-specific ligand according to the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBoth cloning and expression vectors generally contain nucleic acid sequences that enable the vector to replicate in one or more selected host cells. Typically in cloning vectors, this sequence is one that enables the vector to replicate independently of the host chromosomal DNA and includes origins of replication or autonomously replicating sequences. Such sequences are well known for a variety of bacteria, yeast and viruses. The origin of replication from the plasmid pBR322 is suitable for most Gram-negative bacteria, the 2 micron plasmid origin is suitable for yeast, and various viral origins (\ne.g. SV\n 40, adenovirus) are useful for cloning vectors in mammalian cells. Generally, the origin of replication is not needed for mammalian expression vectors unless these are used in mammalian cells able to replicate high levels of DNA, such as COS cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, a cloning or expression vector may contain a selection gene also referred to as selectable marker. This gene encodes a protein necessary for the survival or growth of transformed host cells grown in a selective culture medium. Host cells not transformed with the vector containing the selection gene will therefore not survive in the culture medium. Typical selection genes encode proteins that confer resistance to antibiotics and other toxins, (e.g. ampicillin, neomycin, methotrexate or tetracycline), complement auxotrophic deficiencies, or supply critical nutrients not available in the growth media.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSince the replication of vectors encoding a dual-specific ligand according to the present invention is most conveniently performed in \nE. coli\n, an \nE. coli\n-\nselectable \nmarker, for example, the β-lactamase gene that confers resistance to the antibiotic ampicillin, is of use. These can be obtained from \nE. coli \nplasmids, such as pBR322 or a pUC plasmid such as pUC18 or pUC19.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExpression vectors usually contain a promoter that is recognised by the host organism and is operably linked to the coding sequence of interest. Such a promoter may be inducible or constitutive. The term “operably linked” refers to a juxtaposition wherein the components described are in a relationship permitting them to function in their intended manner. A control sequence “operably linked” to a coding sequence is ligated in such a way that expression of the coding sequence is achieved under conditions compatible with the control sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPromoters suitable for use with prokaryotic hosts include, for example, the β-lactamase and lactose promoter systems, alkaline phosphatase, the tryptophan (trp) promoter system and hybrid promoters such as the tac promoter. Promoters for use in bacterial systems will also generally contain a Shine-Delgarno sequence operably linked to the coding sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe possible vectors are expression vectors that enable the expression of a nucleotide sequence corresponding to a polypeptide library member. Thus, selection with the first and/or second antigen or epitope can be performed by separate propagation and expression of a single clone expressing the polypeptide library member or by use of any selection display system. As described above, the possible selection display system is bacteriophage display. Thus, phage or phagemid vectors may be used, (e.g., pIT1 or pIT2). Leader sequences useful in the invention include pelB, stII, ompA, phoA, bla and pelA. One example is phagemid vectors, which have an \nE. coli\n. origin of replication (for double stranded replication) and also a phage origin of replication (for production of single-stranded DNA). The manipulation and expression of such vectors is well known in the art (Hoogenboom and Winter (1992) supra; Nissim et al. (1994) supra). Briefly, the vector contains a β-lactamase gene to confer selectivity on the phagemid and a lac promoter upstream of an expression cassette that consists (N to C terminal) of a pelB leader sequence (which directs the expressed polypeptide to the periplasmic space), a multiple cloning site (for cloning the nucleotide version of the library member), optionally, one or more peptide tags (for detection), optionally, one or more TAG stop codon and the phage protein pIII. Thus, using various suppressor and non-suppressor strains of \nE. coli \nand with the addition of glucose, iso-propyl thio-β-D-galactoside (IPTG) or a helper phage, such as VCS M13, the vector is able to replicate as a plasmid with no expression, produce large quantities of the polypeptide library member only or produce phage, some of which contain at least one copy of the polypeptide-pIII fusion on their surface.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConstruction of vectors encoding dual-specific ligands according to the invention employs conventional ligation techniques. Isolated vectors or DNA fragments are cleaved, tailored, and religated in the form desired to generate the required vector. If desired, analysis to confirm that the correct sequences are present in the constructed vector can be performed in a known fashion. Suitable methods for constructing expression vectors, preparing in vitro transcripts, introducing DNA into host cells, and performing analyses for assessing expression and function are known to those skilled in the art. The presence of a gene sequence in a sample is detected, or its amplification and/or expression quantified by conventional methods, such as Southern or Northern analysis, Western blotting, dot blotting of DNA, RNA or protein, in situ hybridisation, immunocytochemistry or sequence analysis of nucleic acid or protein molecules. Those skilled in the art will readily envisage how these methods may be modified, if desired.\n\n\n \nSkeletons\n\n\n \n \n \nSkeletons may be based on immunoglobulin molecules or may be non-immunoglobulin in origin as set forth above. Each domain of a ligand (e.g, dual-specific ligand) may be a different skeleton. Possible immunoglobulin skeletons as herein defined includes any one or more of those selected from the following: an immunoglobulin molecule comprising at least (i) the CL (kappa or lambda subclass) domain of an antibody; or (ii) the CH1 domain of an antibody heavy chain; an immunoglobulin molecule comprising the CH1 and CH2 domains of an antibody heavy chain; an immunoglobulin molecule comprising the CH1 CH2 and CH3 domains of an antibody heavy chain; or any of the subset (ii) in conjunction with the CL (kappa or lambda subclass) domain of an antibody. A hinge region domain may also be included. For example, the ligand can comprise a heavy chain constant region of an immunoglobulin (e.g., IgG (e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4) IgM, IgA, IgD or IgE) or portion thereof (e.g., Fc portion) and/or a light chain constant region (e.g., C\nλ\n, C\nκ\n). For example, the ligand can comprise CH1 of IgG1 (e.g., human IgG1), CH1 and CH2 of IgG1 (e.g., human IgG1), CHL CH2 and CH3 of IgG1 (e.g., human IgG1), CH2 and CH3 of IgG1 (e.g., human IgG1), or CH1 and CH3 of IgG1 (e.g., human IgG1). Such combinations of domains may, for example, mimic natural antibodies, such as IgG or IgM, or fragments thereof, such as Fv, scFv, Fab or F(ab′)\n2 \nmolecules. Those skilled in the art will be aware that this list is not intended to be exhaustive.\n\n\n \nProtein Scaffolds\n\n\n \n \n \nEach binding domain can comprise a protein scaffold and one or more CDRs (e.g., of the dAbs disclosed herein) which are involved in the specific interaction of the domain with one or more epitopes. In one embodiment, an epitope binding domain according to the present invention comprises three CDRs. Suitable protein scaffolds include any of those selected from the group consisting of the following: those based on immunoglobulin domains, those based on fibronectin, those based on affibodies, those based on CTLA4, those based on chaperones such as GroEL, those based on lipocallin and those based on the bacterial Fc receptors SpA and SpD. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that this list is not intended to be exhaustive. The binding domains can also comprise a protein scaffold that has a binding site that has binding specificity for a target (e.g., IL-4, IL-13), but does not contain one or more CDRs (e.g., of the dAbs disclosed herein). For example, the binding domain can be a protein scaffold that has a binding site that has binding specificity for a target selected from an affibody, an SpA domain, based on CTLA4, those based on chaperones such as GroEL, those based on lipocallin and those based on the bacterial Fc receptors SpA and SpD, an LDL receptor class A domain, an avimer (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2005/0053973, 2005/0089932, 2005/0164301).\n\n\n \nTherapeutic and Diagnostic Compositions and Uses\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention provides compositions comprising the ligands of the invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient, and therapeutic and diagnostic methods that employ the ligands or compositions of the invention. The ligands according to the method of the present invention may be employed in in vivo therapeutic and prophylactic applications, in vivo diagnostic applications and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherapeutic and prophylactic uses of ligands of the invention involve the administration of ligands according to the invention to a recipient mammal, such as a human. The ligands bind to targets with high affinity and/or avidity. In some embodiments, such as IgG-like ligands, the ligands can allow recruitment of cytotoxic cells to mediate killing of cancer cells, for example by antibody dependent cellular cytoxicity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubstantially pure ligands of at least 90 to 95% homogeneity are possible for administration to a mammal, and 98 to 99% or more homogeneity is possible for pharmaceutical uses, especially when the mammal is a human. Once purified, partially or to homogeneity as desired, the ligands may be used diagnostically or therapeutically (including extracorporeally) or in developing and performing assay procedures, immunofluorescent stainings and the like (Lefkovite and Pernis, (1979 and 1981) Immunological Methods, Volumes I and II, Academic Press, NY).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the instant application, the term “prevention” involves administration of the protective composition prior to the induction of the disease. “Suppression” refers to administration of the composition after an inductive event, but prior to the clinical appearance of the disease. “Treatment” involves administration of the protective composition after disease symptoms become manifest. Treatment includes ameliorating symptoms associated with the disease, and also preventing or delaying the onset of the disease and also lessening the severity or frequency of symptoms of the disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, the ligands, of the present invention will typically find use in preventing, suppressing or treating disease states. For example, ligands can be administered to treat, suppress or prevent a chronic inflammatory disease, allergic hypersensitivity, cancer, bacterial or viral infection, autoimmune disorders (which include, but are not limited to, Type I diabetes, asthma, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, spondylarthropathy (e.g., ankylosing spondylitis), systemic lupus erythematosus, inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis), myasthenia gravis and Behcet's syndrome, psoriasis, endometriosis, and abdominal adhesions (e.g., post abdominal surgery).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ligands of the invention may be used to treat, suppress or prevent disease, such as an allergic disease, a Th2-mediated disease, IL-13-mediated disease, IL-4-mediated disease, and/or IL-4/IL-13-mediated disease. Examples of such diseases include, Hodgkin's disease, asthma, allergic asthma, atopic dermatitis, atopic allergy, ulcerative colitis, scleroderma, allergic rhinitis, COPD, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, chronic graft rejection, bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary granuloma, progressive systemic sclerosis, schistosomiasis, hepatic fibrosis, renal cancer, Burkitt lymphoma, Hodgkins disease, non-Hodgkins disease, Sezary syndrome, asthma, septic arthritis, dermatitis herpetiformis, chronic idiopathic urticaria, ulcerative colitis, scleroderma, hypertrophic scarring, Whipple's Disease, benign prostate hyperplasia, a lung disorder in which IL-4 receptor plays a role, condition in which IL-4 receptor-mediated epithelial barrier disruption plays a role, a disorder of the digestive system in which IL-4 receptor plays a role, an allergic reaction to a medication, Kawasaki disease, sickle cell disease, Churg-Strauss syndrome, Grave's disease, pre-eclampsia, Sjogren's syndrome, autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, Barrett's esophagus, autoimmune uveitis, tuberculosis, cystic fibrosis, allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bleomycin-induced pneumopathy and fibrosis, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, adult respiratory distress syndrome, sarcoidosis, hyper IgE syndrome, idiopathic hypereosinophil syndrome, an autoimmune blistering disease, pemphigus vulgaris, bullous pemphigoid, myasthenia gravis, chronic fatigue syndrome, nephrosis).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “allergic disease” refers to a pathological condition in which a patient is hypersensitized to and mounts an immunologic reaction against a substance that is normally nonimmunogenic. Allergic disease is generally characterized by activation of mast cells by IgE resulting in an inflammatory response (e.g., local response, systemic response) that can result in symptoms as benign as a runny nose, to life-threatening anaphylactic shock and death. Examples of allergic disease include, but are not limited to, allergic rhinitis (e.g., hay fever), asthma (e.g., allergic asthma), allergic dermatitis (e.g., eczema), contact dermatitis, food allergy and urticaria (hives).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein “Th2-mediated disease” refers to a disease in which pathology is produced (in whole or in part) by an immune response (Th2-type immune response) that is regulated by CD4\n+\n Th2 T lymphocytes, which characteristically produce IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13. A Th2-type immune response is associated with the production of certain cytokines (e.g., IL-4, IL-13) and of certain classes of antibodies (e.g., IgE), and is associate with humor immunity. Th2-meidated diseases are characterized by the presence of elevated levels of Th2 cytokines (e.g., IL-4, IL-13) and/or certain classes of antibodies (e.g., IgE) and include, for example, allergic disease (e.g., allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, asthma (e.g., atopic asthma), allergic airways disease (AAD), anaphylactic shock, conjunctivitis), autoimmune disorders associated with elevated levels of IL-4 and/or IL-13 (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, host-versus-graft disease, renal disease (e.g., nephritic syndrome, lupus nephritis)), and infections associated with elevated levels of IL-4 and/or IL-13 (e.g., viral, parasitic, fungal (e.g., C. albicans) infection).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain cancers are associated with elevated levels of IL-4 and/or IL-13 or associated with IL-4-induced and/or IL-13-induced cancer cell proliferation (e.g., B cell lymphoma, T cell lymphoma, multiple myeloma, head and neck cancer, breast cancer and ovarian cancer). These cancers can be treated, suppressed or prevented using the ligand of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, the present ligands will be utilized in purified form together with pharmacologically appropriate carriers. Typically, these carriers include aqueous or alcoholic/aqueous solutions, emulsions or suspensions, and include saline and/or buffered media. Parenteral vehicles include sodium chloride solution, Ringer's dextrose, dextrose and sodium chloride and lactated Ringer's. Suitable physiologically-acceptable adjuvants, if necessary to keep a polypeptide complex in suspension, may be chosen from thickeners such as carboxymethylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gelatin and alginates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntravenous vehicles include fluid and nutrient replenishers and electrolyte replenishers, such as those based on Ringer's dextrose. Preservatives and other additives, such as antimicrobials, antioxidants, chelating agents and inert gases, may also be present (Mack (1982) \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, \n16th Edition). A variety of suitable formulations can be used, including extended release formulations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ligand of the present invention may be used as separately administered compositions or in conjunction with other agents. The ligands can be used in combination therapy with existing IL-13 therapeutics (e.g., existing IL-13 agents (for example, anti-IL-13Rα1, IL-4/13 Trap, anti-IL-13) plus IL-4 dAb, and existing IL-4 agents (for example, anti-IL-4R, IL-4 Mutein, IL-4/13 Trap) plus IL-13 dAb) and IL-13 and IL-4 antibodies (for example, WO05/0076990 (CAT), WO03/092610 (Regeneron), WO00/64944 (Genetic Inst.) and WO2005/062967 (Tanox)). The ligands can be administered and or formulated together with one or more additional therapeutic or active agents. When a ligand is administered with an additional therapeutic agent, the ligand can be administered before, simultaneously with or subsequent to administration of the additional agent. Generally, the ligand and additional agent are administered in a manner that provides an overlap of therapeutic effect. Additional agents that can be administered or formulated with the ligand of the invention include, for example, various immunotherapeutic drugs, such as cylcosporine, methotrexate, adriamycin or cisplatinum, antibiotics, antimycotics, anti-viral agents and immunotoxins. For example, when the antagonist is administered to prevent, suppress or treat lung inflammation or a respiratory disease (e.g., asthma), it can be administered in conjuction with phosphodiesterase inhibitors (e.g., inhibitors of phosphodiesterase 4), bronchodilators (e.g., beta2-agonists, anticholinergerics, theophylline), short-acting beta-agonists (e.g., albuterol, salbutamol, bambuterol, fenoterol, isoetherine, isoproterenol, levalbuterol, metaproterenol, pirbuterol, terbutaline and tornlate), long-acting beta-agonists (e.g., formoterol and salmeterol), short acting anticholinergics (e.g., ipratropium bromide and oxitropium bromide), long-acting anticholinergics (e.g., tiotropium), theophylline (e.g. short acting formulation, long acting formulation), inhaled steroids (e.g., beclomethasone, beclometasone, budesonide, flunisolide, fluticasone propionate and triamcinolone), oral steroids (e.g., methylprednisolone, prednisolone, prednisolon and prednisone), combined short-acting beta-agonists with anticholinergics (e.g., albuterol/salbutamol/ipratopium, and fenoterol/ipratopium), combined long-acting beta-agonists with inhaled steroids (e.g., salmeterol/fluticasone, and formoterol/budesonide) and mucolytic agents (e.g., erdosteine, acetylcysteine, bromheksin, carbocysteine, guiafenesin and iodinated glycerol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther suitable co-therapeutic agents that can be administed with a ligand of the invention to prevent, suppress or treat asthma (e.g., allergic asthma), include a corticosteroid (e.g., beclomethasone, budesonide, fluticasone), cromoglycate, nedocromil, beta-agonist (e.g., salbutamol, terbutaline, bambuterol, fenoterol, reproterol, tolubuterol, salmeterol, fomtero), zafirlukast, salmeterol, prednisone, prednisolone, theophylline, zileutron, montelukast, and leukotriene modifiers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ligands of the invention can be coadministered with a variety of co-therapeutic agents suitable for treating diseases (e.g., a Th-2 mediated disease, IL-4-mediated disease, IL-13-mediated disease, IL-4 and IL-13-mediated disease, cancer), including cytokines, analgesics/antipyretics, antiemetics, and chemotherapeutics.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCytokines include, without limitation, a lymphokine, tumor necrosis factors, tumor necrosis factor-like cytokine, lymphotoxin, interferon, macrophage inflammatory protein, granulocyte monocyte colony stimulating factor, interleukin (including, without limitation, interleukin-1, interleukin-2, interleukin-6, interleukin-12, interleukin-15, interleukin-18), growth factors, which include, without limitation, (e.g., growth hormone, insulin-\nlike growth factor\n 1 and 2 (IGF-1 and IGF-2), granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF), platelet derived growth factor (PGDF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and agents for erythropoiesis stimulation, e.g., recombinant human erythropoietin (Epoetin alfa), EPO, a hormonal agonist, hormonal antagonists (e.g., flutamide, tamoxifen, leuprolide acetate (LUPRON)), and steroids (e.g., dexamethasone, retinoid, betamethasone, cortisol, cortisone, prednisone, dehydrotestosterone, glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid, estrogen, testosterone, progestin).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalgesics/antipyretics can include, without limitation, (e.g., aspirin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen sodium, buprenorphine hydrochloride, propoxyphene hydrochloride, propoxyphene napsylate, meperidine hydrochloride, hydromorphone hydrochloride, morphine sulfate, oxycodone hydrochloride, codeine phosphate, dihydrocodeine bitartrate, pentazocine hydrochloride, hydrocodone bitartrate, levorphanol tartrate, diflunisal, trolamine salicylate, nalbuphine hydrochloride, mefenamic acid, butorphanol tartrate, choline salicylate, butalbital, phenyltoloxamine citrate, diphenhydramine citrate, methotrimeprazine, cinnamedrine hydrochloride, meprobamate, and the like).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntiemetics can also be coadministered to prevent or treat nausea and vomiting, e,g., suitable antiemetics include meclizine hydrochloride, nabilone, prochlorperazine, dimenhydrinate, promethazine hydrochloride, thiethylperazine, scopolamine, and the like).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChemotherapeutic agents, as that term is used herein, include, but are not limited to, for example antimicrotubule agents, (e.g., taxol (paclitaxel)), taxotere (docetaxel); alkylating agents (e.g., cyclophosphamide, carmustine, lomustine, and chlorambucil); cytotoxic antibiotics (e.g., dactinomycin, doxorubicin, mitomycin-C, and bleomycin; antimetabolites (e.g., cytarabine, gemcitatin, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil); antimiotics (e.g., vincristine vinca alkaloids (e.g., etoposide, vinblastine, and vincristine)); and others such as cisplatin, dacarbazine, procarbazine, and hydroxyurea; and combinations thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions can include “cocktails” of various cytotoxic or other agents in conjunction with ligands of the present invention, or even combinations of ligands according to the present invention having different specificities, such as ligands selected using different target antigens or epitopes, whether or not they are pooled prior to administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe route of administration of pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention may be any suitable route, such as any of those commonly known to those of ordinary skill in the art. For therapy, including without limitation immunotherapy, the ligands of the invention can be administered to any patient in accordance with standard techniques. The administration can be by any appropriate mode, including parenterally, intravenously, intramuscularly, intraperitoneally, transdermally, intrathecally, intraarticularly, via the pulmonary route, or also, appropriately, by direct infusion (e.g., with a catheter). The dosage and frequency of administration will depend on the age, sex and condition of the patient, concurrent administration of other drugs, counterindications and other parameters to be taken into account by the clinician. Administration can be local (e.g., local delivery to the lung by pulmonary administration, (e.g., intranasal administration) or local injection directly into a tumor) or systemic as indicated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ligands of this invention can be lyophilised for storage and reconstituted in a suitable carrier prior to use. This technique has been shown to be effective with conventional immunoglobulins and art-known lyophilisation and reconstitution techniques can be employed. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that lyophilisation and reconstitution can lead to varying degrees of antibody activity loss (e.g. with conventional immunoglobulins, IgM antibodies tend to have greater activity loss than IgG antibodies) and that use levels may have to be adjusted upward to compensate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions containing the ligands can be administered for prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatments. In certain therapeutic applications, an adequate amount to accomplish at least partial inhibition, suppression, modulation, killing, or some other measurable parameter, of a population of selected cells is defined as a “therapeutically-effective dose”. Amounts needed to achieve this dosage will depend upon the severity of the disease and the general state of the patient's health, but generally range from 0.005 to 5.0 mg of ligand per kilogram of body weight, with doses of 0.05 to 2.0 mg/kg/dose being more commonly used. For prophylactic applications, compositions containing the present ligands or cocktails thereof may also be administered in similar or slightly lower dosages, to prevent, inhibit or delay onset of disease (e.g., to sustain remission or quiescence, or to prevent acute phase). The skilled clinician will be able to determine the appropriate dosing interval to treat, suppress or prevent disease. When a ligand is administered to treat, suppress or prevent a disease, it can be administered up to four times per day, twice weekly, once weekly, once every two weeks, once a month, or once every two months, at a dose of, for example, about 10 mg/kg to about 80 mg/kg, about 100 mg/kg to about 80 mg/kg, about 1 mg/kg to about 80 mg/kg, about 1 mg/kg to about 70 mg/kg, about 1 mg/kg to about 60 mg/kg, about 1 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg, about 1 mg/kg to about 40 mg/kg, about 1 mg/kg to about 30 mg/kg, about 1 mg/kg to about 20 mg/kg, about 1 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg, about 10 μg/kg to about 10 mg/kg, about 10 μg/kg to about 5 mg/kg, about 10 μg/kg to about 2.5 mg/kg, about 1 mg/kg, about 2 mg/kg, about 3 mg/kg, about 4 mg/kg, about 5 mg/kg, about 6 mg/kg, about 7 mg/kg, about 8 mg/kg, about 9 mg/kg or about 10 mg/kg. In particular embodiments, the ligand is administered to treat, suppress or prevent a chronic allergic disease once every two weeks or once a month at a dose of about 10 μg/kg to about 10 mg/kg (e.g., about 10 μg/kg, about 100 μg/kg, about 1 mg/kg, about 2 mg/kg, about 3 mg/kg, about 4 mg/kg, about 5 mg/kg, about 6 mg/kg, about 7 mg/kg, about 8 mg/kg, about 9 mg/kg or about 10 mg/kg.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular embodiments, the ligand is administered to treat, suppress or prevent asthma each day, every two days, once a week, once every two weeks or once a month at a dose of about 10 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg (e.g., about 10 μg/kg, about 100 μg/kg, about 1 mg/kg, about 2 mg/kg, about 3 mg/kg, about 4 mg/kg, about 5 mg/kg, about 6 mg/kg, about 7 mg/kg, about 8 mg/kg, about 9 mg/kg or about 10 mg/kg). The ligand can also be administered at a daily dose or unit dose (e.g., to treat, suppress or prevent asthma) at a daily dose or unit dose of about 10 mg, about 9 mg, about 8 mg, about 7 mg, about 6 mg, about 5 mg, about 4 mg, about 3 mg, about 2 mg or about 1 mg.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular embodiments, the ligand of the invention is administered at a dose that provides saturation of IL-4 and/or IL-13 or a desired serum concentration in vivo. The skilled physician can determine appropriate dosing to achieve saturation, for example by titrating ligand and monitoring the amount of free binding sites on IL-4 and/or IL-13 or the serum concentration of ligand. Therapeutic regiments that involve administering a therapeutic agent to achieve target saturation or a desired serum concentration of agent are common in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTreatment or therapy performed using the compositions described herein is considered “effective” if one or more symptoms are reduced (e.g., by at least 10% or at least one point on a clinical assessment scale), relative to such symptoms present before treatment, or relative to such symptoms in an individual (human or animal model) not treated with such composition or other suitable control. Symptoms will obviously vary depending upon the disease or disorder targeted, but can be measured by an ordinarily skilled clinician or technician. Such symptoms can be measured, for example, by monitoring the level of one or more biochemical indicators of the disease or disorder (e.g., levels of an enzyme or metabolite correlated with the disease, affected cell numbers, etc.), by monitoring physical manifestations (e.g., inflammation, tumor size, etc.), or by an accepted clinical assessment scale, for example, Juniper's Asthma Qualtiy of Life Questionnaire (American Thoracic Society's 32 item assessment evaluates the quality of life with respect to activity limitations, symptoms, emotional function and exposure to environmental stimuli; Juniper, et. al., “Health-related Quality of Life in Moderate Asthma,” Chest, 116:1297-1303 (1999).), the Expanded Disability Status Scale (for multiple sclerosis), the Irvine Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (32 point assessment evaluates quality of life with respect to bowel function, systemic symptoms, social function and emotional status-score ranges from 32 to 224, with higher scores indicating a better quality of life), the Quality of Life Rheumatoid Arthritis Scale, or other accepted clinical assessment scale as known in the field. A sustained (e.g., one day or more, in one embodiment longer) reduction in disease or disorder symptoms by at least 10% or by one or more points on a given clinical scale is indicative of “effective” treatment. Similarly, prophylaxis performed using a composition as described herein is “effective” if the onset or severity of one or more symptoms is delayed, reduced or abolished relative to such symptoms in a similar individual (human or animal model) not treated with the composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA composition containing ligands according to the present invention may be utilized in prophylactic and therapeutic settings to aid in the alteration, inactivation, killing or removal of a select target cell population in a mammal. In addition, the ligands and selected repertoires of polypeptides described herein may be used extracorporeally or in vitro selectively to kill, deplete or otherwise effectively remove a target cell population from a heterogeneous collection of cells. Blood from a mammal may be combined extracorporeally with the ligands, e.g. antibodies, cell-surface receptors or binding proteins thereof whereby the undesired cells are killed or otherwise removed from the blood for return to the mammal in accordance with standard techniques.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\n \n \n \nReference is made to Examples 1 to 4 in WO2007/0858152A2 for general methodologies that are applicable to the present invention, including the assays set out in Example 2 of W02007/0858152A2, which can be used with the present invention.

Upon stimulation with IL-13 SEAP is secreted into the supernatant which is measured using a colorimetric method. Soluble dAbs were tested for their ability to block IL-13 signalling via the STAT6 pathway. Briefly, the dAb is pre-incubated with 6 ng/ml recombinant IL-13 (GSK) for one hour then added to 50000 HEKSTAT6 cells in DMEM (Gibco, Invitrogen Ltd, Paisley, UK) in a tissue culture microtitre plate. The plate is incubated for 24 hours at 37° C. 5% CO\n2\n. The culture supernatant is then mixed with QuantiBlue (Invivogen) and the absorbance read at 640 nm. Anti-IL-13 dAb activity causes a decrease in STAT6 activation and a corresponding decrease in A\n640 \ncompared to IL-13 stimulation.

The plates were washed again before the addition of 25 pg/ml IL-13 (Bender MedSystems) mixed with a dilution series of DOM10 dAb (i.e., an anti-IL-13 dAb) or IL-13. The plates were washed again before binding of IL-13 to the capture antibody was detected using biotin conjugated detection antibody (Module Set, Bender Medsystems), followed by peroxidase labelled Streptavidin (Module Set, Bender MedSystems). The plate was then incubated with TMB substrate (KPL, Gaithersburg, USA), and the reaction was stopped by the addition of HCl and the absorbance read at 450 nm. Anti-IL-13 dAb activity caused a decrease in IL-13 binding and therefore a decrease in absorbance compared with the IL-13 only control.

Genet\n. (2000) 9549-59) and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (Howard et al., \nAm. J. Resp. Cell Molec. Biol\n. (2001) 377-384). Therefore it is desirable for the anti-IL-13 dAb to also have binding affinity for this variant of the cytokine. DOM10-53-474 bound IL-13 (R130Q) and inhibited IL-13 (R130Q) stimulated proliferation in two cell assays (TF-1 & Hek-Stat6).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(DOM10-53-474)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCell Assay\n\n\nEC50 nM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHek-Stat6 (variant hIL-13 stimulation =\n\n\n0.273 (n = 4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3 ng/ml)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTF-1 (variant hIL-13 stimulation =\n\n\n0.133 (n =3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5 ng/ml)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAgonistic Activity\n\n\n \n \n \nTo determine whether DOM10-53-474 binds non-target proteins, and to ensure that no undesired cytokines/interferons are released due to agonistic activity of the dAb, DOM10-53-474 was tested for agonistic activity in a human blood assay. Each sample was titrated from 1 μM to 10 nM of DOM10-53-474 and tested in two donors, A & B. The assay was set up in duplicate (a & b) and the meso scale discovery (MSD) was performed in duplicate. The nil wells contained blood alone, (i.e. no dAb added), there were 8 nil wells for donor A and 4 for donor B. The cytokines assayed were IL-8, IL-6, TNFα, IL-10, IL-1β, IL-12p70 and IFNγ. No agonistic activity was seen with respect to IL-6, TNFα, IL-10, IL-β, IL-12p70 or IFNγ. There was a little IL-8 production at the 1 μM concentration but this was very low.\n\n\n \nSEC-MALLS\n\n\n \n \n \nThe in-solution properties of dAb proteins were determined by an initial separation on SEC (size exclusion chromatography; TSKgel G2000/3000SWXL, Tosoh Biosciences, Germany; BioSep-SEC-S2000/3000, Phenomenex, Calif., USA) and subsequent on-line detection of eluting proteinaceous material by UV (Abs280 nm), R1 (refractive index) and light scattering (laser at 685 nm). The proteins were at an initial concentration of 2 mg/mL for DOM10-275-78 and 1.4 mg/ml for DOM10-53-474, as determined by absorbance at 280 nm, and visually inspected for impurities by SDS-PAGE. The homogeneity of samples to be injected was usually >90%. 100 uL were injected onto the SEC column. The protein separation on SEC was performed at 0.5 mL/min for 45 minutes. PBS (phosphate buffered saline±10% EtOH) was used as mobile phase. The ASTRA software (Wyatt Inc; CA; USA) integrated the signals of all three detectors and allowed for the determination of the molar masses in kDa of proteins from ‘first physical principles’. Inter-run variations and data quality was assessed by running a positive control of known in-solution state with every sample batch.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor some DOM10-53 clones no reliable solution state could be assigned because the molecules bound aspecifically to the column matrix or could not be resolved using the size exclusion column. For these cases where the solution state was reliable (i.e. DOM10-53-474 and DOM10-275-78) it was shown that the DOM10-275-78 molecule is mostly a monomer in solution and 90% is eluted from the column (\nFIG. 2\n), and that for the DOM10-53-474 molecule the majority of the protein is clear monomer (\nFIG. 3\n). DOM10-53-474 eluted as a single peak with the molar mass defined as 13 kDa in the right part of the peak (monomer) but creeping up over the left part of the peak up to 18 kDa, indicating some degree of rapid self association (average mass shown in the table is 14 kDa).\n\n\n \nDSC\n\n\n \n \n \nDOM10-275-78 protein was supplied in both PBS buffer (phosphate buffered saline) filtered to yield a concentration of 2 mg/ml, and in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH7.4 at 2 mg/ml. Concentrations were determined by absorbance at 280 nm. PBS buffer and potassium phosphate buffer were used as a reference for the respective samples. DSC was performed using capillary cell microcalorimeter VP-DSC (Microcal, Mass., USA), at a heating rate of 180° C./hour. A typical scan usually was from 25-90° C. for both the reference buffer and the protein sample. After each reference buffer and sample pair, the capillary cell was cleaned with a solution of 1% Decon in water followed by PBS. Resulting data traces were analysed using Origin 7 Microcal software. The DSC trace obtained from the reference buffer was subtracted from the sample trace. The resultant traces are shown in \nFIGS. 4 AND 5\n. The precise molar concentration of the sample was entered into the data analysis routine to yield values for apparent Tm, enthalpy (ΔH) and van't Hoff enthalpy (ΔHv) values. Typically data were fitted to a non-2-state model. The DSC experiments showed that some DOM10 molecules (e.g. 10-53-474 (SEQ ID NO:1), \nFIG. 6\n, have higher melting temperatures compared to others (e.g. 10-275-78). Such properties are indicative of increased stability and indicate superior suitability, for example, for pulmonary delivery.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMolecule\n\n\nApparent Tm (° C.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDOM10-274-78 in PBS\n\n\n49.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDOM10-275-78 in\n\n\n49.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\npotassium phosphate\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDOM10-53-474 in PBS\n\n\n54.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe unfolding of DOM10-53-474 protein is irreversible, and therefore apparent Tm might be lower than the melting temperature due to some irreversible steps in the unfolding mechanism taking place before the melting point.\n\n\n \nSolubility\n\n\n \n \n \nLiquid formulations that contain high dAb concentrations are desirable for certain purposes. For example, proteins delivered therapeutically via a nebulising device may need to be at higher concentrations than would be expected for systemic delivery because not all the nebulised protein will be inhaled nor deposited in the lung. Volumes administered are also limited by the size of the reservoir in the nebuliser of interest. To this end, the solubility of both DOM10-53-474 and DOM10-275-78 was measured to determine the maximum concentration that could be achieved before incurring protein losses through aggregation and precipitation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe proteins of a known starting concentration in PBS, determined by measuring absorbance at 280 nm, and of a known volume were each applied to a \nVivaspin\n 20 centrifugal concentrating device, with a PES membrane of MWCO 3,000Da (Vivasciences) and spun in a benchtop centrifuge at 4,000 g for time intervals of between 10 and 30 mins. Ten minute time periods were used initially and these were incremented as the protein became more concentrated in order to obtain the desired reduction in volume.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter each spin the protein was removed from the device, the volume measured to the nearest 50 μl using pipettes and the concentration determined. Concentration determination was performed using the absorbance reading obtained by subtracting the absorbance measured at 320 nm from the absorbance measured at 280 nm after the sample had been centrifuged at 16,000 g to remove any precipitate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe experimental concentration was plotted against the theoretical concentration at that volume, and the maximum solubility was taken as the point at which experimental concentration diverged from theoretical as shown in \nFIG. 7\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor both proteins a concentration of 100 mg/ml was achieved before divergence and actual protein recovery was approximately 100% of the start material.\n\n\n \nNebulisation of DOM10-53-474\n\n\n \n \n \nThe nebulising device can nebulise the dAb solution into droplets, only some of which will fall within the requisite size range for pulmonary deposition (1-5 μm). The particle size of the aerosol particles were analysed by laser light scattering using the Malvern Spraytek. Two post-nebulisation samples were collected i) protein solution which remained in the reservoir and ii) aerosolized protein collected by condensation. The parameters measured to assess the nebulisation process were i) Respirable fraction−% of particle in 1-5 μm size range, this is important to determine how much dAb will reach the deep lung; ii) Particle size distribution (psd) of dAb; iii) Mean median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD)—average droplet size of nebulised dAb solution within psd. The stability of the dAb to the nebulisation process was assessed by comparing pre- and post nebulisation samples using a variety of methods, i) Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC)—which demonstrates whether the nebulisation process caused aggregation of the dAb; ii) Sandwich ELISA for binding to hIL-13.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nebulisation properties of DOM10-53-474 were investigated using both a jet nebuliser (LC+, Pari) and a vibrating mesh nebuliser (E-flow, Pari). DOM10-53-474 protein was tested in both PBS buffer (phosphate buffered saline) at a concentration of 2.6 mg/ml, and in 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH7.5, 7% (v/v) PEG1000, 1.2% (w/v) sucrose at 2.3 and 4.7 mg/ml. Nebulisation was performed for approximately 3 minutes. 100 uL of protein samples (diluted to 1 mg/mL) were injected onto the SEC (TSKgel G2000SWXL, Tosoh Biosciences, Germany) column. The protein separation on SEC was performed at 0.5 mL/min for 45 minutes. PBS (phosphate buffered saline)+10% EtOH was used as mobile phase. The detection of eluting proteinaceous material was carried by on-line detection by UV (\nAbs\n 280 nm & 215 nm). The SEC profile of the pre- and two post-nebulisation samples were identical; no peaks indicative of aggregation were seen post nebulisation, \nFIGS. 8A-F\n. The samples were analysed for binding to hIL-13 and the potency was shown to be unaffected by nebulisation, \nFIG. 9\n. The optimum MMAD is 3 μm and for deep lung delivery the desirable respirable fraction is the highest percentage of particles <5 μm. The LC+ (Pari) Jet nebuliser gives the better MMAD: MMAD values are lower when the buffer contains PEG; MMAD decreases as protein concentration increases. The LC+ (Pari) Jet nebuliser gives the higher %<5 μm: higher %<5 μm values are obtained when the buffer contains PEG; %<5 μm also increases as protein concentration increases.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\neFlow Rapid\n\n\nPari LC +\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMMAD\n\n\n \n\n\nMMAD\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormulation\n\n\n(um)\n\n\n% < 5 um\n\n\n(um)\n\n\n% < 5 um\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n25 mM NaPhosphate pH 7.5, 7%\n\n\n4.26\n\n\n60.6%\n\n\n3.98\n\n\n61.2\n%\n \n \n \n\n\nPEG\n \n \n \n 1000, 1.2% Sucrose,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3 mg/ml\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n25 mM NaPhosphate pH 7.5, 7%\n\n\n4.10\n\n\n63.8%\n\n\n3.66\n\n\n66.5\n%\n \n \n \n\n\nPEG\n \n \n \n 1000, 1.2 % Sucrose\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.7 mg/ml\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n10-53-474, PBS,\n\n\n5.20\n\n\n47.9%\n\n\n4.43\n\n\n56.6%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.6 mg/ml\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDownstream Processing and Purity Obtained\n\n\n \n \n \nA traditional method for initial capture and purification of antibodies and antibody fragments from fermenter supernatants or periplasmic fractions is using Protein A immobilised on an inert matrix. As an affinity chromatography step this has the advantage of good protein recovery and high (e.g. ˜90%) level of purity. However, there are some disadvantages. As with all forms of affinity chromatography some of the ligand can be leached from the column support matrix during the elution phase, Protein A is known to be a potential immunogen. Therefore, if Protein A is used, then any residual Protein A, leached from the column, should be removed or reduced as far as possible in subsequent chromatography steps.\n\n\n \nDOM10-275-78 Purification\n\n\n \n \n \nThe initial capture step for either fermenter supernatants or periplasmic fraction containing DOM10-275-78 was by direct loading onto Protein A Streamline resin (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in PBS. The resin was washed with 2-5 column volumes of PBS before eluting the protein with 4 column volumes of 0.1M Glycine pH3.0. At this stage the eluted protein was approximately 99% pure, containing approximately 1% of dimeric DOM10-275-78 as measured by SEC and is shown in \nFIG. 10\n. Protein recovery was virtually 100%. Residual PrA was measured using a PrA ELISA kit (Cygnus, #F400) and was determined to be between 50 to 200 ppm.\n\n\n \nResidual PrA Removal\n\n\n \n \n \nThe residual PrA was reduced using two further chromatographic steps. The eluate from the PrA step was pH adjusted to pH6.5 using 1M Tris pH8.0 and prepared for purification on hydroxyapatite type II by addition of 1% (v/v) 0.5M sodium phosphate 016.5 resulting in a final phosphate concentration of 5 mM. The PrA eluate was applied to the column which had been equilibrated with 5 mM phosphate pH6.5 and the DOM10-275-78 monomer eluted in the flow through. The dimer was bound to the column and eluted at the start of a salt gradient which was applied after the DOM10-275-78 had been recovered. The gradient ran from 0 to 1M NaCl in 5 mM phosphate pH6.5 over 30 column volumes. It was expected that the PrA would elute in this gradient although amounts were too small to be able to see by absorbance on the chromatogram. Complexes of PrA with the DOM10-275-78 eluted after the salt gradient when a 500 mM phosphate pH6.5 wash was applied to the column. An example of a typical chromatogram is shown in \nFIG. 11\n. The recovery of DOM 10-275-78 monomer after this stage was measured as 74% based on absorbance at 280 nm and the purity was 100% as measured by SEC which is shown in \nFIG. 12\n. The residual protein levels were measured and were found to have been reduced to between 0.4 and 0.56 ppm (parts per million i.e. ng/mg).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA further purification step was introduced to reduce the residual PrA even further. The eluate pool from the hydroxyapatite column was directly applied to a phenyl (HIC) column (GE Healthcare) after addition of NaCl to a final concentration of 2M. The column had been equilibrated with 25 mM phosphate pH7.4 plus 2M NaCl. The protein was eluted with a gradient from 2M NaCl to no salt over 20 column volumes as shown in the chromatogram in \nFIG. 13\n. After this step the residual PrA levels were reduced to between 0.15 to 0.19 ppm and the protein recovery was measured by absorbance at 280 nm as being 80%.\n\n\n \nExample 6\n\n\nCodon Optimization of Select Anti-IL-13 Dabs\n\n\n \n \n \nTwo anti-IL-13 dAbs were selected for codon optimization, DOM10-53-474 and DOM10-275-78. DOM10-53-474 was optimized for both \nE. coli \nexpression (once) and \nPichia pastoris \nsoluble expression (twice). DOM10-275-78 was optimized once for \nE. coli \nexpression.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe theoretical minimum percent identity of a codon optimised sequence to the wild-type dAb (i.e. maximimising the number of nucleotide changes within each degenerate codon to still encode the same amino acid sequence) for DOM10-53-474 is 57.6% and for DOM10-53-78 is 54.6%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe actual percent identity for DOM10-53-474 optimized for \nE. coli \nexpression (SEQ ID NO:3) was 79.0% sequence identity to wild-type DOM10-53-474. The actual percent identity for DOM10-53-474 optimized for \nPichia pastoris \nsoluble expression was 75.7% (SEQ ID NO:4) and 75.4% (SEQ ID NO:5).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe actual percent identity for DOM10-275-78 optimized for \nE. coli \nexpression (SEQ ID NO:16) is 75.2%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe teachings of all patents, published applications and references cited herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile this invention has been particularly shown and described with references to example embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the scope of the invention encompassed by the appended claims.\n\n\n \nSequence Correlation Table\n\n\n \n \n \nThe sequences below are presented in prior applications (number in the first bracket) and also in the present application (number in second bracket).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmino Acid sequences:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDOM10-53-474\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(SEQ ID NO:2369 in WO2007/085815A2), (SEQ ID NO: 1)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDOM 10-275-78\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(SEQ ID NO:2456 in U.S. Ser.
