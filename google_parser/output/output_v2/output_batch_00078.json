Their crystal structure and biosynthetic pathway have been elucidated (Steinmetz et al. 2004) and their biosynthesis genes have been sequenced (Hoefle et al. 2006b). \n\n\nPretubulysin, a biosynthetic precursor of the tubulysins, also has been shown to possess significant activity in its own right (Ullrich et al. 2009). (Full citations for the documents cited herein by first author or inventor and year are listed at the end of this specification.) \n\n\n[0003] The tubulysins belong to a group of naturally occurring antimitotic polypeptides and depsipeptides that includes the phomopsins, the dolastatins, and the cryptophycins (Hamel 2002). Antimitotic agents other than polypeptides or depsipeptides also exist, for example paclitaxel, the maytansines, and the epothilones. During mitosis, a cell's microtubules reorganize to form the mitotic spindle, a process requiring the rapid assembly and disassembly of the microtubule constituent proteins α- and β-tubulin. \n\n\nAntimitotic agents block this process and prevent a cell from undergoing mitosis, although at the molecular level the exact blockage mechanism may differ from one agent to another. The tubulysins prevent the assembly of the tubulins into microtubules, causing the affected cells to accumulate in the G\n2\n/M phase and undergo apoptosis (Khalil et al. 2006). Conversely, paclitaxel effects the same end result by binding to microtubules and preventing their disassembly. \n\n\n [0004] The tubulysins have a tetrapeptidyl scaffold constructed from one \n\n\nproteinogenic and three non-proteinogenic amino acid subunits: N-methylpipecolinic acid (Mep), isoleucine (He), tubuvaline (Tuv), and either tubuphenylalanine (Tup, R\nA\n equals H in formula (I) below) or tubutyrosine (Tut, R\nA\n equals OH). About a dozen naturally \n\n occurring tubulysins (named A, B, etc.) are known, the sites of structural variation among them being at residues R\nA\n, R\nB\n and R\nc\n as shown in Formula (I) and Table 1 : \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Table 1 - Naturally Occurring Tubulysins \n\n\n Tubulysin R\nA\n R\nB\n R\nc\n \n\n\n A OH 0C(=0)Me CH\n2\nOC(O)I-Bu\n\n\nB OH 0C(=0)Me CH\n2\nOC(=O)«-Pr \n\n\n C OH 0C(=0)Me CH\n2\nOC(=O)Et\n\n\nD H 0C(=0)Me CH\n2\nOC(O)J-Bu\n\n\nE H 0C(=0)Me CH\n2\nOC(=O)«-Pr \n\n\n F H 0C(=0)Me CH\n2\nOC(=O)Et\n\n\nG OH 0C(=0)Me CH\n2\nOC(=O)CH=CH\n2\n \n\n\nH H 0C(=0)Me CH\n2\nOCC=O)Me\n\n\nI OH 0C(=0)Me CH\n2\nOC(=O)Me \n\n\n U H 0C(=0)Me H \n\n\n V H OH H\n\n\nZ OH OH H \n\n\n Pretubulysin H H Me \n\n\n[0005] Kaur et al. 2006 studied the antiproliferative properties of tubulysin A and found that it was more potent than other antimitotic agents such as paclitaxel and vinblastine and was active in xenograft assays against a variety of cancer cell lines. Further, tubulysin A induced apoptosis in cancer cells but not normal cells and showed significant potential antiangiogenic properties in in vitro assays. The antimitotic properties of other tubulysins have also been evaluated and generally have been found to compare favorably against those of non-tubulysin antimitotic agents (see, e.g., Balasubramanian et al. 2009; \n\n Steinmetz et al. 2004; Wipf et al. 2004). For these reasons, there is considerable interest in the tubulysins as anti-cancer agents (see, e.g., Domling et al. 2005c; Hamel 2002). \n\n\n[0006] Numerous publications describe efforts directed at the synthesis of tubulysins, including: Balasubramanian et al. 2009; Domling et al. 2006; Hoefle et al. 2003; Neri et al. 2006; Peltier et al. 2006; Sani et al. 2007; Sasse et al. 2007; Shankar et al. 2009; \n\n\nShibue et al. 2009; and Wipf et al. 2004. Other publications describe structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies, via the preparation and evaluation of tubulysin analogs or derivatives: Balasubramanian et al. 2008 and 2009; Domling 2006; Domling et al. 2005a; Ellman et al. 2009; Hoefle et al. 2001 & 2006a; Patterson et al. 2007 & 2008; Richter 2008; Vlahov et al. 2009; Wang et al. 2007; and Wipf et al. 2007 and 2010. The SAR studies mainly explored structural variations in the Mep ring, residues R\nB\n and R\nc\n of the Tuv subunit, and the aromatic ring or aliphatic carbon chain of the Tup/Tut subunit. \n\n\n[0007] Domling et al. 2005 disclose conjugates of tubulysins with a partner molecule generically described as a polymer or a biomolecule, but with actual examples limited to polyethylene glycol (PEG) as the partner molecule. Other documents disclosing conjugates of tubulysins are Boyd et al. 2008 and 2010; Vlahov et al. 2008a, 2008b and 2010; Leamon et al. 2008 and 2009; Reddy et al. 2009; and Low et al. 2009. Leung et al. 2002 disclose polyanionic polypeptides that can be conjugated to drugs (including tubulysins) to improve their bioactivity and water solubility. \n\n\n[0008] Davis et al. 2008 and Schluep et al. 2009 disclose cyclodextrin based formulations in which tubulysins are covalently attached to a cyclodextrin via a hydrazide-disulfide linker moiety bonded to the Tup/Tut carboxyl group. \n\n\n BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n [0009] The present invention discloses novel antiproliferative compounds that are structurally related to the tubulysins, are cytotoxic or cytostatic against many cancer cells, and are believed to act by an antimitotic mechanism. These compounds can be conjugated to ligands such as antibodies for targeted delivery against cancer cells. \n\n\n[0010] In one embodiment, this invention provides a compound having a structure represented by formula (II) \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nwherein \n\n\n n is 0, 1, or 2; \n\n\n R\n1\n, R\n2\n and R\n3\n are independently H, unsubstituted or substituted C\n1\n-C\n10\n alkyl, unsubstituted or substituted C\n2\n-C\n10\n alkenyl, unsubstituted or substituted C\n2\n-C\n10\n alkynyl, unsubstituted or substituted aryl, unsubstituted or substituted heteroaryl, unsubstituted or substituted (CH\n2\n)^\n2\nO(C\n1\n-C\n10\n alkyl), unsubstituted or substituted (CH\n2\n)i-\n2\nθ(C\n2\n-Ci\n0\n alkenyl), unsubstituted or substituted (CH\n2\n)L\n2\nO(C\n2\n-C\n10\n alkynyl), (CH\n2\n)i_\n2\nOC(=O)(Ci-Ci\n0\n alkyl), unsubstituted or substituted (CH\n2\n)i-\n2\nθC(=O)(C\n2\n-Ci\n0\n alkenyl), unsubstituted or substituted (CH\n2\n)i-\n2\nθC(=O)(C\n2\n-Ci\n0\n alkynyl), unsubstituted or substituted C(K))(C\n1\n-C\n10\n alkyl), unsubstituted or substituted C(K))(C\n2\n- Ci\n0\n alkenyl), unsubstituted or substituted C(K))(C\n2\n-Ci\n0\n alkynyl), unsubstituted or substituted cycloaliphatic, unsubstituted or substituted heterocy- cloaliphatic, unsubstituted or substituted arylalkyl, or unsubstituted or substituted alkylaryl; \n\n\n R\n4\n is \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n R\n5\n is H, Ci-C\n5\n alkyl, C\n2\n-C\n5\n alkenyl, C\n2\n-C\n5\n alkynyl, CO(Ci-C\n5\n alkyl), CO(C\n2\n-C\n5\n alkenyl), or CO(C\n2\n-C\n5\n alkynyl); \n\n or a pharmaceutically acceptable ester thereof, a pharmaceutically acceptable amide thereof at the carboxyl group of R\n4\n with the α-amino group of an α-amino acid, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. \n\n\n[0011] A preferred R\n4\n is \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwith the stereochemistry at the methyl group alpha to the carboxyl being more preferably that corresponding to the natural tubulysins, that is: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [0012] This invention also provides novel intermediates useful for synthesizing compounds according to formula (II). \n\n\n [0013] In another embodiment, this invention provides a compound of this invention conjugated via a linker moiety to a ligand (preferably an antibody, more preferably a monoclonal antibody, and most preferably a human monoclonal antibody) for its selective delivery to a target cell such as a cancer cell. \n\n\n[0014] In another embodiment, there is provided a composition of matter comprising a compound of this invention and a linker moiety, suitable for conjugation to a ligand. \n\n\n[0015] In another embodiment, this invention provides a method for inhibiting the proliferation of cancer cells in a subject suffering from cancer, comprising administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of this invention or a con- jugate thereof with a ligand (particularly an antibody).

A whole antibody is a glycoprotein \n\n comprising at least two heavy (H) chains and two light (L) chains inter-connected by disulfide bonds. Each heavy chain comprises a heavy chain variable region (V\nH\n) and a heavy chain constant region comprising three domains, C\nHI\n, C\nH2\n and Cm- Each light chain comprises a light chain variable region (V\nL\n or V\nk\n) and a light chain constant region comprising one single domain, C\nL\n. The V\nH\n and V\nL\n regions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed complementarity determining regions (CDRs), interspersed with more conserved framework regions (FRs). Each V\nH\n and V\nL\n comprises three CDRs and four FRs, arranged from amino- to carboxy -terminus in the following order: FRl, CDRl, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, and FR4. The variable regions contain a binding domain that interacts with an antigen. The constant regions may mediate the binding of the antibody to host tissues or factors, including various cells of the immune system (e.g., effector cells) and the first component (CIq) of the classical complement system. An antibody is said to \"specifically bind\" to an antigen X if the antibody binds to antigen X with a K\nD\n of 5 x 10\n~8\n M or less, more preferably 1 x 10\n~8\n M or less, more preferably 6 x 10\n~9\n M or less, more preferably 3 x 10\n~9\n M or less, even more preferably 2 x 10\n~9\n M or less. The antibody can be chimeric, humanized, or, preferably, human. The heavy chain constant region can be engineered to affect glycosylation type or extent, to extend antibody half- life, to enhance or reduce interactions with effector cells or the complement system, or to modulate some other property. The engineering can be accomplished by replacement, addition, or deletion of one or more amino acids or by replacement of a domain with a domain from another immunoglobulin type, or a combination of the foregoing. \n\n\n[0039] \"Antibody fragment\" and \"antigen-binding portion\" of an antibody (or simply \"antibody portion\") mean one or more fragments of an antibody that retain the ability to specifically bind to an antigen. It has been shown that the antigen-binding function of an antibody can be performed by fragments of a full-length antibody, such as (i) a Fab fragment, a monovalent fragment consisting of the V\nL\n, V\nH\n, C\nL\n and C\nHI\n domains; (ii) a F(ab')\n2\n fragment, a bivalent fragment comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; (iii) a Fab' fragment, which is essentially an Fab with part of the hinge region (see, for example, Abbas et al., Cellular and Molecular Immunology, 6th Ed., Saunders Elsevier 2007); (iv) a Fd fragment consisting of the V\nH\n and C\nHI\n domains; (v) a Fv fragment consisting of the V\nL\n and V\nH\n domains of a single arm of an antibody, (vi) a dAb fragment (Ward et al, (1989) Nature 341:544-546), which consists of a V\nH\n \n\n domain; (vii) an isolated complementtarity determining region (CDR); and (viii) a nanobody, a heavy chain variable region containing a single variable domain and two constant domains. Furthermore, although the two domains of the Fv fragment, V\nL\n and V\nH\n, are encoded by separate genes, they can be joined, using recombinant methods, by a synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a single protein chain in which the V\nL\n and V\nH\n regions pair to form monovalent molecules (known as single chain Fv, or scFv); see, e.g., Bird et al (1988) Science 2A2Α21-426; and Huston et al (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. ScL USA 85:5879-5883,). Such single chain antibodies are also encompassed within the term \"antigen-binding portion\" of an antibody. \n\n\n[0040] An \"isolated antibody\" means an antibody that is substantially free of other antibodies having different antigenic specificities (e.g., an isolated antibody that specifically binds antigen X is substantially free of antibodies that specifically bind antigens other than antigen X). An isolated antibody that specifically binds antigen X may, however, have cross-reactivity to other antigens, such as antigen X molecules from other species. In certain embodiments, an isolated antibody specifically binds to human antigen X and does not cross-react with other (non-human) antigen X antigens. Moreover, an isolated antibody may be substantially free of other cellular material and/or chemicals. \n\n\n[0041] \"Monoclonal antibody\" or \"monoclonal antibody composition\" means a preparation of antibody molecules of single molecular composition, which displays a single binding specificity and affinity for a particular epitope. \n\n\n [0042] \"Human antibody\" means an antibody having variable regions in which both the framework and CDR regions (and the constant region, if present) are derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences. Human antibodies may include later modifications, including natural or synthetic modifications. Human antibodies may include amino acid residues not encoded by human germline immunoglobulin sequences (e.g., mutations introduced by random or site-specific mutagenesis in vitro or by somatic mutation in vivo). However, \"human antibody\" does not include antibodies in which CDR sequences derived from the germline of another mammalian species, such as a mouse, have been grafted onto human framework sequences. \n\n\n[0043] \"Human monoclonal antibody\" means an antibody displaying a single binding specificity, which has variable regions in which both the framework and CDR regions are derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences. In one embodiment, human \n\n monoclonal antibodies are produced by a hybridoma that includes a B cell obtained from a transgenic nonhuman animal, e.g., a transgenic mouse, having a genome comprising a human heavy chain transgene and a light chain transgene fused to an immortalized cell. \n\n\n[0044] \"Aliphatic\" means a straight- or branched-chain, saturated or unsaturated, non- aromatic hydrocarbon moiety having the specified number of carbon atoms (e.g., as in \"C\n3\n aliphatic,\" \"Ci-C\n5\n aliphatic,\" or \"Ci to C\n5\n aliphatic,\" the latter two phrases being synonymous for an aliphatic moiety having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms) or, where the number of carbon atoms is not explicitly specified, from 1 to 4 carbon atoms (2 to 4 carbons in the instance of unsaturated aliphatic moieties). \n\n\n[0045] \"Alkyl\" means a saturated aliphatic moiety, with the same convention for designating the number of carbon atoms being applicable. By way of illustration, Ci-C\n4\n alkyl moieties include, but are not limited to, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, isobutyl, t- butyl, 1 -butyl, 2-butyl, and the like. \n\n\n[0046] \"Alkenyl\" means an aliphatic moiety having at least one carbon-carbon double bond, with the same convention for designating the number of carbon atoms being applicable.

By way of illustration, C\n2\n-C\n4\n alkynyl groups include ethynyl (acetylenyl), propargyl (prop-2-ynyl), 1-propynyl, but-2-ynyl, and the like. \n\n\n [0048] \"Cycloaliphatic\" means a saturated or unsaturated, non-aromatic hydrocarbon moiety having from 1 to 3 rings, each ring having from 3 to 8 (preferably from 3 to 6) carbon atoms. \"Cycloalkyl\" means a cycloaliphatic moiety in which each ring is saturated. \"Cycloalkenyl\" means a cycloaliphatic moiety in which at least one ring has at least one carbon-carbon double bond. \"Cycloalkynyl\" means a cycloaliphatic moiety in which at least one ring has at least one carbon-carbon triple bond. By way of illustration, cycloaliphatic moieties include, but are not limited to, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclopentenyl, cyclohexyl, cyclohexenyl, cycloheptyl, cyclooctyl, and adamantyl. Preferred cycloaliphatic moieties are cycloalkyl ones, especially cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, and cyclohexyl. \n\n [0049] \"Heterocycloaliphatic\" means a cycloaliphatic moiety wherein, in at least one ring thereof, up to three (preferably 1 to 2) carbons have been replaced with a heteroatom independently selected from N, O, or S, where the N and S optionally may be oxidized and the N optionally may be quaternized. Similarly, \"heterocycloalkyl,\" \n\n\n\"heterocycloalkenyl,\" and \"heterocycloalkynyl\" means a cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, or cycloalkynyl moiety, respectively, in which at least one ring thereof has been so modified.

Examples are methoxy, phenoxy, methylthio, and phenylthio, respectively. \n\n\n[0051] \"Halogen\" or \"halo\" means fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine. \n\n\n [0052] \"Aryl\" means a hydrocarbon moiety having a mono-, bi-, or tricyclic ring system wherein each ring has from 3 to 7 carbon atoms and at least one ring is aromatic. The rings in the ring system may be fused to each other (as in naphthyl) or bonded to each other (as in biphenyl) and may be fused or bonded to non-aromatic rings (as in indanyl or cyclohexylphenyl). By way of further illustration, aryl moieties include, but are not limited to, phenyl, naphthyl, tetrahydronaphthyl, indanyl, biphenyl, phenanthryl, anthracenyl, and acenaphthyl. \n\n\n [0053] \"Heteroaryl\" means a moiety having a mono-, bi-, or tricyclic ring system wherein each ring has from 3 to 7 carbon atoms and at least one ring is an aromatic ring containing from 1 to 4 heteroatoms independently selected from from N, O, or S, where the N and S optionally may be oxidized and the N optionally may be quaternized.

Substituents and substitution patterns can be selected by one of ordinary skill in the art, having regard for the moiety to which the substituent is attached, to provide compounds that are chemically stable and that can be synthesized by techniques known in the art as well as the methods set forth herein. \n\n\n[0055] \"Arylalkyl,\" (heterocycloaliphatic)alkyl,\" \"arylalkenyl,\" \"arylalkynyl,\" \"biarylalkyl,\" and the like mean an alkyl, alkenyl, or alkynyl moiety, as the case may be, substituted with an aryl, heterocycloaliphatic, biaryl, etc., moiety, as the case may be, with the open (unsatisfied) valence at the alkyl, alkenyl, or alkynyl moiety, for example as in benzyl, phenethyl, N-imidazoylethyl, N-morpholinoethyl, and the like.

Polymorphic crystalline forms and solvates are also encompassed within the scope of this invention. \n\n\n COMPOUNDS \n\n\n[0064] A preferred embodiment of compounds of formula (II) is represented by formula (II-a) \n\n\n\n\n\nwherein n, R\n1\n, R\n2\n, and R\n3\n are as defined hereinabove in respect of formula (II) and R\n4a\n is \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[0065] In the compounds of formula (II-a), the subunit corresponding to Tup/Tut in the naturally occurring tubulysins has been reduced in size and lipophilicity by at least two carbons, via deletion of the two aliphatic carbon atoms immediately following the carboxylic acid group - that is, the amino group is now α- to the carboxylic acid group, instead of γ- to it. In the instance in which R\n4\n is 4-aminophenylalanine, the amine group constitutes a polar moiety that further reduces lipophilicity. SAR studies show that lipophilicity is an important factor in the biological activity of the tubulysins and their analogs or derivatives. Steinmetz et al. 2004 and Neri et al. 2006 both disclose that the more lipophilic naturally occurring tubulysins - i.e., those having a Tup subunit (R\nA\n equals H in formula I) instead of a Tut subunit (R\nA\n equals OH in formula I) - possessed greater biological activity. Further, the differences in activities were retained regardless of the size and lipophilicity of the 11-acyloxy residue (group R\nc\n in formula (I)) in the Tuv subunit (Steinmetz et al. 2004). These results indicate that a lipophilic Tup/Tut subunit is a particularly important SAR element. \n\n\n[0066] The above observations are partially corroborated in two studies by Balasubra- manian et al. In the first (Balasubramanian et al. 2008), analogs dimethylated at the carbon alpha to the carboxyl group in the Tup subunit were compared against otherwise \n\n identical analogs desmethylated at the same position. The dimethylated analogs had greater antiproliferative activity - although the in vitro tubulin inhibition IC50S were comparable - as might be expected based on their relative lipophilicities. However, this trend was not followed in the second study (Balasubramanian et al. 2009), in which three analogs (one α-carbon desmethylated, one monomethylated, and one dimethylated) were compared. There, the most active analog was the desmethylated one while the monomethylated one - i.e., with the natural Tup subunit - was by far the least active one. However, the latter analog had additional modifications elsewhere in the molecule rendering it essentially inactive, making it unclear what SAR inferences, if any, can be drawn. \n\n\n[0067] Patterson et al. 2007 and Ellman et al. 2009 compared the cytotoxicities of tubulysin D and analogs in which either only the phenethyl or the γ-carboxy group was retained in the Tup subunit. The phenethyl-retained analog was 3.6 to 13.6 times less active than tubulysin D against three cancer cell lines but when the less lipophilic γ- carboxyl group was retained, there was an even greater loss of activity, from 25.7 to 62.5 times less active. That is, the order of activity was: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Tubulysin D \n\n\n [0068] The above documents suggest, individually and in combination, that lipophilicity at the Tup locus is especially important for the biological activity of the tubulysins. Therefore, the prior art suggests that the replacement of the Tup subunit with a phenylalanine (Phe), 4-aminophenylalanine (4-NH2Phe), norvaline or other R\n4\n subunit in accordance with formula (II-a) is undesirable, as each would lead to the loss of at least two aliphatic carbons and a consequent reduction in lipophilicity at the Tup/Tut locus. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Tup Phe 4-NH\n2\nPhe Norvaline \n\n [0069] Another preferred embodiment of compounds of formula (II) is represented by formula (II-b): \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein n, R\n1\n, R\n2\n, and R\n3\n are as defined hereinabove in respect for formula (II). \n\n\nAlthough chemical formulae can be found in the literature encompassing an -NH\n2\n group in the 4-position of the Tup aromatic ring (Domling 2005a and 2005b), there has been no disclosure on how a compound having such a feature might be made. \n\n\n[0070] In formulae (II), (II-a), and (II-b), R\n1\n preferably is H, Ci-C\n5\n alkyl, C\n2\n-C\n5\n alkenyl, or C\n2\n-C\n5\n alkenyl, and is more preferably an isoleucyl residue, that is: \n\n\n\n\n\n [0071] In formulae (II), (II-a), and (II-b), R\n2\n preferably is H, Ci-C\n5\n alkyl, C\n2\n-C\n5\n alkenyl, CH\n2\nO(Ci-C\n5\n alkyl), CH\n2\nO(C\n2\n-C\n5\n alkenyl), CH\n2\nO(C=O)(Ci-C\n5\n alkyl), or\n\n\nCH\n2\nOC(=O)(C\n2\n-C\n5\n alkenyl); and more preferably is H, Me, Et, n-Pr, CH\n2\nOMe, CH\n2\nOEt,\n\n\nCH\n2\nO(n-Pr), CH\n2\nOC(=O)/-Bu, CH\n2\nOC(=O)«-Pr, CH\n2\nOC(K))CH=CH\n2\n, or \n\n\n CH\n2\nOC(=O)Me, with Me, n-Pr, CH\n2\nOMe, CH\n2\nOC(=O)i-Bu, and CH\n2\nO(n-Pr) being especially preferred. \n\n\n [0072] In formulae (II), (II-a), and (II-b), R\n3\n preferably is H, C\n1\n-C\n5\n alkyl, C\n2\n-C\n5\n alkenyl, C(O)C\n1\n-C\n5\n alkyl, or C(=O)C\n2\n-C\n5\n alkenyl; and more preferably is H, Me, Et, or\n\n\nC(O)Me. \n\n\n [0073] Preferably, in formulae (II) and (II-a), R\n4\n and R\n4a\n are: \n\n\n \n\n [0074] In formulae (II), (II-a),and (II-b), n preferably is 1 and, in the instance of formula (II), R\n5\n preferably is methyl; that is, the ring in the Mep subunit preferably is an N-methyl piperidinyl one. \n\n\n [0075] A preferred embodiment of compounds according to formula (II-a) is depicted by formula (II-a') \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere R \na\n is as defined above in respect of formula (II-a), R is H, C\n1\n-Cs alkyl, C\n2\n-C5 alkenyl, CH\n2\nO(Ci-C\n5\n alkyl), CH\n2\nO(C\n2\n-C\n5\n alkenyl), CH\n2\nO(C=O)(Ci-C\n5\n alkyl), or CH\n2\nOC(K))(C\n2\n-C\n5\n alkenyl); and R\n3\n is H, C\n1\n-C\n5\n alkyl, C\n2\n-C\n5\n alkenyl, CC=O)C\n1\n-C\n5\n alkyl, or C(=O)C\n2\n-C\n5\n alkenyl.

Preferably, R\n3\n is H, Me, Et, or C(O)Me. \n\n\n [0076] A preferred embodiment of compounds according to formula (II-b) is depicted by formula (II-b') \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere R\n2\n is H, C\n1\n-C\n5\n alkyl, C\n2\n-C\n5\n alkenyl, CH\n2\nO(Ci-C\n5\n alkyl), CH\n2\nO(C\n2\n-C\n5\n alkenyl), CH\n2\nO(C=O)(Ci-C\n5\n alkyl), or CH\n2\nOC(=O)(C\n2\n-C\n5\n alkenyl); and R\n3\n is H, C\n1\n-C\n5\n alkyl, C\n2\n- C\n5\n alkenyl, C(O)C\n1\n-C\n5\n alkyl, or C(O)C\n2\n-C\n5\n alkenyl.

Alternatively, the carboxyl group can be amidated with ammonia or an alkyl amine. \n\n [0078] In another embodiment, this invention provides a compound having a structure represented by formula (II-c) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere R\n13\n is Me, n-Pr, CH\n2\nOMe, or CH\n2\nOC(=O)CH\n2\nCH(Me)\n2\n; R\n14\n is Me or C(=O)Me; and R\n15\n is H or Ci-C\n5\n alkyl (preferably H, Me, or Et). \n\n\n [0079] In formulae (II-b), (II-b'), and (II-c) the stereochemistry at the methyl alpha to the carboxyl preferably is that corresponding to the naturally-occurring tubulysins, i.e.: \n\n\n\n\n\n [0080] In a preferred embodiment, a compound of this invention is in the form of an amide of the carboxyl group in R\n4\n (or R\n4a\n, as the case may be) with the α-amine group of an α-amino acid. The α-amino acid can be selected from the group consisting of a proteinogenic amino acid, 4-aminophenylalanine, norvaline, norleucine, and citrulline. Preferably, the α-amino acid is selected from the group consisting of alanine, norvaline, glycine, lysine, arginine, citrulline, norleucine, 4-aminophenylalanine, and phenylalanine. Also preferably, the absolute configuration of the α-amino acid is the proteinogenic one, i.e., L. In this preferred embodiment, R\n4\n (or R\n4a\n) preferably is: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [0081] Specific examples of compounds of this invention according to formula (II) include compounds (III-a) through (III-y). Some of the compounds are depicted as a pharmaceutically acceptable ester or a pharmaceutically acceptable amide of the R\n4\n carboxyl group with the α-amine group of an α-amino acid or methyl ester thereof. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n [0082] This invention also provides novel intermediates that can be utilized for the synthesis of compounds of this invention. Compounds according to formula (VIII-a) can be used for the making of compounds according to formula (II) or (II-b), as taught in the figures and examples herein. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [0083] In formula (VIII-a), R\n7\n is H or an amine protecting group and R\n8\n is H, C\n1\n-C\n10\n alkyl, C\n2\n-C\n10\n alkenyl, C\n2\n-C\n10\n alkynyl, aryl, cycloaliphatic, alkylcycloaliphatic, arylalkyl, or alkylaryl. Preferably, R\n7\n is H, Boc (ϊ-butoxycarbonyl), Troc (2,2,2-trichloroethoxy carbonyl), Bpoc ((I -methyl- l-(4-biphenyl)ethoxycarbony I)), Cbz (benzyloxy carbonyl), Aloe (allyloxycarbonyl), methyl amine, or Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl). \n\n\nPreferably, R\n8\n is H or C\n1\n-Cs alkyl (especially Me). \n\n\n [0084] Another novel intermediate useful for synthesis of compounds of this inventtion has a structure according to formula (VIII-b) The use of compounds of formula (VIII-b) to make compounds of this invention is taught in the figures and examples herein. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [0085] In formula (VIII-b), R\n9\n and R\n10\n are independently H or an amine protecting group and R\n11\n is H, Ci-Ci\n0\n alkyl, C\n2\n-C\n10\n alkenyl, C\n2\n-C\n10\n alkynyl, aryl, cycloaliphatic, alkylcycloaliphatic, arylalkyl, or alkylaryl. Preferably, R\n9\n and R\n10\n are independently selected from H, Boc, Troc, Bpoc, Cbz, Aloe, methylamine, and Fmoc. Preferably, R\n11\n is H or C\n1\n-C\n5\n alkyl (especially Me). Preferably, where R\n9\n and R\n10\n are each an amine protecting group, they are different amine protecting groups. \n\n\n [0086] Additional suitable amine protecting groups for the compounds of formula (VIII-a) and (VIII-b) are disclosed in Greene and Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic \n\n Synthesis, 3rd edition, pp. 464-653 (John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1999), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. \n\n\n CONJUGATES \n\n\n [0087] In another aspect, there is provided a conjugate comprising cytotoxic \n\n\ncompound according to this invention and a ligand, represented by formula (IV) \n\n\n [D(X\nD\n)\na\nC(X\nz\n)\nb\n]\nm\nZ (IV) where Z is ligand; D is a cytotoxic compound according to this invention; and \n\n\n-(X\nD\n)\na\nC(X\nz\n)b- are collectively referred to as a \"linker moiety\" or \"linker\" because they link Z and D. Within the linker, C is a cleavable group designed to be cleaved at the site of intended biological action of compound D; X\nD\n and X\nz\n are referred to as spacer moieties (or \"spacers\") because they space apart D and C and C and Z, respectively; \n\n\nsubscripts a and b are independently 0 or 1 (that is, the presence of X\nD\n and/or X\nz\n are optional); and subscript m is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 (preferably 1, 2, 3, or 4). D, X\nD\n, C, X\nz\n and Z are more fully defined hereinbelow. \n\n\n[0088] Ligand Z - for example an antibody - serves a targeting function. By binding to a target tissue or cell where its antigen or receptor is located, ligand Z directs the conjugate there. Preferably, the target tissue or cell is a cancer tissue or cell and the antigen or receptor is a tumor-associated antigen, that is, an antigen that is uniquely expressed by cancerous cells or is overexpressed by cancer cells, compared to non- cancerous cells. Cleavage of group C at the target tissue or cell releases compound D to exert its cytotoxic effect locally. In some instances, the conjugate is internalized into a target cell by endocytosis and cleavage takes place within the target cell. In this manner, precise delivery of compound D is achieved at the site of intended action, reducing the dosage needed. Also, compound D is normally biologically inactive (or significantly less active) in its conjugated state, thereby reducing undesired toxicity against non-target tissue or cells. As anticancer drugs are often highly toxic to cells in general, this is an important consideration. \n\n\n [0089] As reflected by the subscript m, each molecule of ligand Z can conjugate with more than one compound D, depending on the number of sites D has available for conjugation and the experimental conditions employed. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that, while each individual molecule of ligand Z is conjugated to an integer \n\n number of compounds D, a preparation of the conjugate may analyze for a non-integer ratio of compounds D to ligand Z, reflecting a statistical average. \n\n\n Ligand Z and Conjugation Thereof \n\n\n [0090] Preferably, ligand Z is an antibody. For convenience and brevity and not of limitation, the detailed subsequent discussion herein about the conjugation of ligand Z is written in the context of its being an antibody, but those skilled in the art will understand that other types of ligand Z can be conjugated, mutatis mutandis. For example, conjugates with folic acid as the ligand can target cells having the folate receptor on their surfaces (Vlahov et al. 2008a, 2008b and 2010; Leamon et al. 2009). For the same reason, the detailed discussion below is primarily written in terms of a 1 : 1 ratio of antibody Z to compound D. \n\n\n [0091] Preferably, ligand Z is an antibody against a tumor associated antigen, allowing a conjugate comprising such a ligand Z to selectively target cancer cells. \n\n\nExamples of such antigens include: mesothelin, prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), CD 19, CD22, CD30, CD70, B7H4 (also known as O8E), protein tyrosine kinase 7 (PTK7), RGl, CTLA-4, and CD44. The antibody can be animal (e.g., murine), chimeric, humanized, or, preferably, human. The antibody preferably is monoclonal, especially a monoclonal human antibody. The preparation of human monoclonal antibodies against some of the aforementioned antigens is disclosed in Korman et al., US 2009/0074660 Al (B7H4); Rao-Naik et al., US 2009/0142349 Al A2 (CD19); King et al., WO 2008/070569 A2 (CD22); Keler et al., US 7,387,776 B2 (2008) (CD30); Terrett et al., US 2009/0028872 Al (CD70); Korman et al., US 6,984,720 Bl (2006) (CTLA-4); Korman et al., US 2009/0217401 Al (PD-I); Huang et al., US 2008/0279868 Al (PSMA); Lu et al., US 2010/0034826 Al (PTK7); Harkins et al., US 7,335,748 B2(2008) (RGl); Terrett et al., WO 2009/045957 Al (mesothelin); and Xu et al., US 2010/0092484 Al (CD44); the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. \n\n\n[0092] Ligand Z can also be an antibody fragment or antibody mimetic, such as an affibody, a domain antibody (dAb), a nanobody, a unibody, a DARPin, an anticalin, a versabody, a duocalin, a lipocalin, or an avimer. \n\n\n[0093] Any one of several different reactive groups on ligand Z can be a conjugation site, including ε-amino groups in lysine residues, pendant carbohydrate moieties, car- \n\n boxylic acid groups, disulfide groups, and thiol groups. Each type of reactive group represents a trade-off, having some advantages and some disadvantages. For reviews on antibody reactive groups suitable for conjugation, see, e.g., Garnett, Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 53 (2001), 171-216 and Dubowchik and Walker, Pharmacology & Therapeutics 83 (1999), 67-123, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. \n\n\n [0094] In one embodiment, ligand Z is conjugated via a lysine ε-amino group. Most antibodies have multiple exposed lysine ε-amino groups, which can be conjugated via amide, urea, thiourea, or carbamate bonds using techniques known in the art, including modification with a heterobifunctional agent (as further described hereinbelow). \n\n\nHowever, it is difficult to control which and how many ε-amino groups react, leading to potential batch-to-batch variability in conjugate preparations. Also, conjugation may cause neutralization of a protonated ε-amino group important for maintaining the antibody's native conformation or may take place at a lysine near or at the antigen binding site, neither being a desirable occurrence. \n\n\n[0095] In another embodiment, ligand Z can be conjugated via a carbohydrate side chain, as many antibodies are glycosylated. The carbohydrate side chain can be oxidized with periodate to generate aldehyde groups, which in turn can be reacted with amines to form an imine group, such as in a semicarbazone, oxime, or hydrazone. If desired, the imine group can be converted to a more stable amine group by reduction with sodium cyanoborohydride. For additional disclosures on conjugation via carbohydrate side chains, see, e.g., Rodwell et al, Proc. Nat'l Acad. ScL USA 83, 2632-2636 (1986); the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. As with lysine ε-amino groups, there are concerns regarding reproducibility of the location of the conjugation site(s) and stoichiometry. \n\n\n[0096] In yet another embodiment, ligand Z can be conjugated via a carboxylic acid group. In one embodiment, a terminal carboxylic acid group is functionalized to generate a carbohydrazide, which is then reacted with an aldehyde-bearing conjugation moiety. See Fisch et al., Bioconjugate Chemistry 1992, 3, 147-153. \n\n\n[0097] In yet another embodiment, antibody Z can be conjugated via a disulfide group bridging a cysteine residue on antibody Z and a sulfur on the other portion of the conjugate. Some antibodies lack free thiol (sulfhydryl) groups but have disulfide groups, for example in the hinge region. In such case, free thiol groups can be generated by \n\n reduction of native disulfide groups. The thiol groups so generated can then be used for conjugation. See, e.g., Packard et al, Biochemistry 1986, 25, 3548-3552; King et al., Cancer Res. 54, 6176-6185 (1994); and Doronina et al., Nature Biotechnol. 21(7), 778- 784 (2003); the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Again, there are concerns regarding conjugation site location and stoichiometry and the possible disruption of antibody native conformation. \n\n\n [0098] A number of methods are known for introducing free thiol groups into antibodies without breaking native disulfide bonds, which methods can be practiced with a ligand Z of this invention. Depending on the method employed, it may be possible to introduce a predictable number of free sulfhydryls at predetermined locations. In one approach, mutated antibodies are prepared in which a cysteine is substituted for another amino acid. See, for example, Eigenbrot et al., US 2007/0092940 Al; Chilkoti et al., Bioconjugate Chem. 1994, 5, 504-507; Urnovitz et al., US 4,698,420 (1987); Stimmel et al., J. Biol. Chem., 275 (39), 30445-30450 (2000); Bam et al., US 7,311,902 B2 (2007); Kuan et al., J. Biol. Chem., 269 (10), 7610-7618 (1994); Poon et al., J. Biol. Chem., 270 (15), 8571-8577 (1995). In another approach, an extra cysteine is added to the C- terminus. See, e.g. Cumber et al., J. Immunol., 149, 120-126 (1992); King et al, Cancer Res., 54, 6176-6185 (1994); Li et al., Bioconjugate Chem., 13, 985-995 (2002); Yang et al., Protein Engineering, 16, 761-770 (2003); and Olafson et al., Protein Engineering Design & Selection, 17, 21-27 (2004). A preferred method for introducing free cysteines is that taught by Liu et al., WO 2009/026274 Al, in which a cysteine bearing amino acid sequence is added to the C-terminus of the heavy chain of an antibody. This method introduces a known number of cysteine residues (one per heavy chain) at a known location remote from the antigen binding site. The disclosures of the documents cited in this paragraph are all incorporated herein by reference. \n\n\n [0099] In yet another embodiment, lysine ε-amino groups can be modified with hete- robifunctional reagents such as 2-iminothiolane or N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio)- propionate (SPDP), converting an ε-amino group into a thiol or disulfide group - creating a cysteine surrogate, as it were. However, this method suffers from the same conjugation location and stoichiometry limitations associated with ε-amino groups proper. \n\n\n [00100] In yet another preferred embodiment, ligand Z is conjugated via the nucleophi- Hc addition product of a thiol group to an acceptor moiety. A preferred acceptor moiety \n\n is a maleimide group, whose reaction with an antibody thiol group is generically illustrated below. The thiol group can be a native one, or one introduced as described above. \n\n\n\n\n\n Linker -(^) \na\nC(^)\nb\n- [00101] As noted above, the linker portion of a conjugate of this invention comprises up to three elements: a cleavable group C and optional spacers X\nz\n and X\nD\n. \n\n\n[00102] Cleavable group C is a group cleavable under physiological conditions, preferably is selected such that it is relatively stable while the conjugate is in general circulation in the blood plasma, but is readily cleaved once the conjugate reaches its site of intended action, that is, near, at, or within the target cell. Preferably, the conjugate is internalized by endocytosis by a target cell upon binding of antibody Z to an antigen displayed on the surface of the target cell. Subsequently, cleavage of group C occurs in a vesicular body of the target cell (an early endosome, a late endosome, or, especially, a lysosome). \n\n\n[00103] In one embodiment, group C is a pH sensitive group. The pH in blood plasma is slightly above neutral, while the pH inside a lysosome is acidic, circa 5. Thus, a group C whose cleavage is acid catalyzed will cleave at a rate several orders of magnitude faster inside a lysosome than in the blood plasma rate. Examples of suitable acid-sensitive groups include cis-aconityl amides and hydrazones, as described in Shen et al., US 4,631,190 (1986); Shen et al., US 5,144,011 (1992); Shen et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 102, 1048-1054 (1981) and Yang et al., Proc. Natl Acad. Sci (USA), 85, 1189- 1193 (1988); the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. \n\n\n[00104] In another embodiment, group C is a disulfide. Disulfides can be cleaved by a thiol-disulfide exchange mechanism, at a rate dependent on the ambient thiol \n\n\nconcentration. As the intracellular concentration of glutathione and other thiols is higher than their serum concentrations, the cleavage rate of a disulfide will be higher intracellularly. Further, the rate of thiol-disulfide exchange can be modulated by adjustment of the steric and electronic characteristics of the disulfide (e.g., an alkyl-aryl disulfide versus an alkyl-alkyl disulfide; substitution on the aryl ring, etc.), enabling the design of disulfide linkages that have enhanced serum stability or a particular cleavage \n\n rate. For additional disclosures relating to disulfide cleavable groups in conjugates, see, e.g., Thorpe et al, Cancer Res. 48, 6396-6403 (1988); Santi et al., US 2005/0287155 Al; Ng et al., US 6,989,452 B2 (2006); Ng et al., WO 2002/096910 Al; Boyd et al., US 7,691,962 B2; and Sufi et al., WO 2008/083312 A2; the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. \n\n\n [00105] A preferred group C comprises a peptide bond that is cleaved, preferentially by a protease, at the intended site of action, as opposed to by a protease in the serum. Typically, group C comprises from 1 to 20 amino acids, preferably from 1 to 6 amino acids, more preferably from 1 to 3 amino acids. The amino acid(s) can be natural and/or unnatural α-amino acids. Natural amino acids are those encoded by the genetic code, as well as amino acids derived therefrom, e.g., hydroxyproline, γ-carboxyglutamate, citrulline, and O-phosphoserine. The term amino acid also includes amino acid analogs and mimetics. Analogs are compounds having the same general H\n2\nN(R)CHCO\n2\nH structure of a natural amino acid, except that the R group is not one found among the natural amino acids. Examples of analogs include homoserine, norleucine, methionine- sulfoxide, and methionine methyl sulfonium. An amino acid mimetic is a compound that has a structure different from the general chemical structure of an α-amino acid but functions in a manner similar to one. The term \"unnatural amino acid\" is intended to represent the \"D\" stereochemical form, the natural amino acids being of the \"L\" form. \n\n\n[00106] Preferably, group C contains an amino acid sequence that is a cleavage recognition sequence for a protease. Many cleavage recognition sequences are known in the art. See, e.g., Matayoshi et al. Science 247: 954 (1990); Dunn et al. Meth. Enzymol. 241: 254 (1994); Seidah et al. Meth. Enzymol. 244: 175 (1994); Thornberry, Meth. \n\n\nEnzymol. 244: 615 (1994); Weber et al. Meth. Enzymol. 244: 595 (1994); Smith et al. Meth. Enzymol. 244: 412 (1994); and Bouvier et al. Meth. Enzymol. 248: 614 (1995); the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. \n\n\n [00107] For conjugates that are not intended to be internalized by a cell, a group C can be chosen such that it is cleaved by a protease present in the extracellular matrix in the vicinity of the target tissue, e.g., a protease released by nearby dying cells or a tumor- associated protease. Exemplary extracellular tumor-associated proteases are matrix metalloproteases (MMP), thimet oligopeptidase (TOP) and CDlO. \n\n [00108] For conjugates that are designed to be internalized by a cell, group C preferably comprises an amino acid sequence selected for cleavage by an endosomal or lysosomal protease, especially the latter. Non-limiting examples of such proteases include cathepsins B, C, D, H, L and S, especially cathepsin B. Cathepsin B \n\n\npreferentially cleaves peptides at a sequence -AA\n2\n-AA\nX\n- where AA\n1\n is a basic or strongly hydrogen bonding amino acid (such as lysine, arginine, or citrulline) and AA is a hydrophobic amino acid (such as phenylalanine, valine, alanine, leucine, or isoleucine), for example Val-Cit (where Cit denotes citrulline) or Val-Lys. (Herein, amino acid sequences are written in the N-to-C direction, as in H\n2\nN- AA\n2\n-AA\nX\n -CO\n2\nH, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.) For additional information regarding cathepsin- cleavable groups, see Dubowchik et al, Biorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 8, 3341-3346 (1998); Dubowchik et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 8 3347-3352 (1998); and Dubowchik et al., Bioconjugate Chem. 13, 855-869 (2002); the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference. Another enzyme that can be utilized for cleaving peptidyl linkers is legumain, a lysosomal cysteine protease that preferentially cleaves at Ala-Ala-Asn. \n\n\n [00109] In one embodiment, Group C is a peptide comprising the two-amino acid sequence -AA\n2\n-AA\nX\n- wherein AA\n1\n is lysine, arginine, or citrulline and AA\n2\n is phenylalanine, valine, alanine, leucine or isoleucine. In another embodiment, C consists of a sequence of one to five amino acids, selected from the group consisting of Val-Cit, Ala- VaI, Val-Ala-Val, Lys-Lys, Ala-Asn-Val, Val-Leu-Lys, Cit-Cit, Val-Lys, \n\n\nAla-Ala-Asn, Lys, Cit, Ser, and GIu. \n\n\n [00110] The preparation and design of cleavable groups C consisting of a single amino acid is disclosed in Chen et al., US 2010/0113476 Al, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. \n\n\n[00111] Group C can also be a photocleavable one, for example a nitrobenzyl ether that is cleaved upon exposure to light. \n\n\n [00112] Group C can be bonded directly to antibody Z or compound D; that is, spacers X\nz\n and X\nD\n, as the case may be, can be absent. For example, if group C is a disulfide, one of the two sulfurs can be a cysteine residue or its surrogate on antibody Z. Or, group C can be a hydrazone bonded to an aldehyde on a carbohydrate side chain of the antibody. Or, group C can be a peptide bond formed with a lysine ε-amino group of antibody Z. In \n\n a preferred embodiment, compound D is directly bonded to group C via a peptidyl bond to a carboxyl or amine group in compound D. \n\n\n [00113] When present, spacer X\nz\n provides spatial separation between group C and antibody Z, lest the former sterically interfere with antigen binding by latter or the latter sterically interfere with cleavage of the former. Further, spacer X\nz\n can be used to confer increased solubility or decreased aggregation properties to conjugates. A spacer X\nz\n can comprise one or more modular segments, which can be assembled in any number of combinations. Examples of suitable segments for a spacer X\nz\n are: \n\n\n \n>\n H H \n5 δ\n ft \nδ\n > H \n5\n \n\n\n {— N-(CH\n2\nJ\n2-6\n-N- { {— (CH\n2\nJ\n2-6\n-C-I ?— (CH\n2\n)\n2\n.\n6\n-N— f 1-C-(CHa)\n2-6\n-N-I \nand\n h\nN\n-(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)\nr\n-CH\n2\nCH\n2\n-cH \n\n\nwhere the subscript r is 1 to 24, preferably 2 to 4. These segments can be combined to make spacers X\nz\n such as: \n\n\n ft H ft H H \nξ\n \n\n\n \\— (CH\n2\n)\n3\n-C-N-(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)\n4\n-CH\n2\nCH\n2\n-C-N-(CH\n2\n)\n2\n-N— f ft H H \n5\n \n\n\nj— (CH\n2\n)\n3\n-C-N-(CH\n2\n)\n2\n-N— J \n\n\n \n4\n H ft H \nj\n \n\n\nor i-(CH\n2\n)\n2\n_\n6\n-N-C-(CH\n2\n)\n2\n.\n6\n-N-| \n\n\n [00114] Spacer X\nD\n, if present, provides spatial separation between group C and compound D, lest the latter interfere sterically or electronically with cleavage of the former. Spacer X\nD\n also can serve to introduce additional molecular mass and chemical functionality into a conjugate. Generally, the additional mass and functionality will affect the serum half-life and other properties of the conjugate. Thus, through judicious selection of spacer groups, the serum half-live of a conjugate can be modulated. Spacer X\nD\n also can be assembled from modular segments, as described above in the context of spacer X\nz\n. \n\n\n[00115] Either spacer X\nz\n or X\nD\n, or both, can comprise a self- immolating moiety. A self- immolating moiety is a moiety that (1) is bonded to group C and either antibody Z or cytotoxin D and (2) has a structure such that cleavage from group C initiates a reaction sequence resulting in the self-immolating moiety disbonding itself from antibody Z or cytotoxin D, as the case may be. In other words, reaction at a site distal from antibody Z or cytotoxin D (cleavage from group C) causes the X\nz\n-Z or the X\nD\n-D bond to rupture as \n\n well. The presence of a self-immolating moiety is desirable in the case of spacer X\nD\n because, if, after cleavage of the conjugate, spacer X\nD\n or a portion thereof were to remain attached to cytotoxin D, the biological activity of the latter may be impaired. The use of a self-immolating moiety is especially desirable where cleavable group C is a polypeptide. \n\n\n[00116] Exemplary self-immolating moieties (i)-(v) bonded to a hydroxyl or amino group on a partner molecule D are shown below: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[00117] The self- immolating moiety is the structure between dotted lines a and b, with adjacent structural features shown to provide context. Self-immolating moieties (i) and (v) are bonded to a compound D-NH\n2\n (i.e., compound D is conjugated via an amino group), while self-immolating moieties (ii), (iii), and (iv) are bonded to a compound D-OH (i.e., compound D is conjugated via a hydroxyl or carboxyl group). Cleavage of the amide bond at dotted line b releases the amide nitrogen as an amine nitrogen, initiating a reaction sequence that results in the cleavage of the bond at dotted line a and the consequent release of D-OH or D-NH\n2\n, as the case may be.

Preferred amino acids AA are lysine, citrulline, alanine, valine, glycine, and phenylalanine. \n\n\n[00123] In formula (V-b), R\n1\n preferably is H, Ci-C\n5\n alkyl, C\n2\n-C\n5\n alkenyl, or C\n2\n-C\n5\n alkenyl, and is more preferably an isoleucyl residue, that is: \n\n\n\n\n\n [00124] In formulae (V-b) and (V-c), R\n2\n preferably is H, Ci-C\n5\n alkyl, C\n2\n-C\n5\n alkenyl,\n\n\nCH\n2\nO(Ci-C\n5\n alkyl), CH\n2\nO(C\n2\n-C\n5\n alkenyl), CH\n2\nO(C=O)(Ci-C\n5\n alkyl), or CH\n2\nOC(O)(C\n2\n-\n\n\nC\n5\n alkenyl); and more preferably is H, Me, Et, CH\n2\nOMe, CH\n2\nOEt, CH\n2\nOC(O)Z-BU,\n\n\nCH\n2\n0C(O)«-PΓ, CH\n2\nOC(=O)CH=CH\n2\n, or CH\n2\nOC(O)Me. \n\n\n [00125] In formulae (V-b) and (V-c), R\n3\n preferably is H, C\n1\n-C\n5\n alkyl, C\n2\n-C\n5\n alkenyl,\n\n\nC(=O)Ci-C\n5\n alkyl, or C(=O)C\n2\n-C\n5\n alkenyl; and more preferably is H, Me, Et, or \n\n\n C(O)Me. \n\n\n [00126] In formulae (V-b) and (V-c), R\n4'\n preferably is \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwith R\n4\n equaling \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand R , 12 equaling H, Me, or Et being especially preferred. \n\n [00127] In formula (V-b), n preferably is 1 and R\n5\n preferably is methyl; that is, the ring in the Mep subunit preferably is an N-methyl piperidinyl one. \n\n\n [00128] In another embodiment, this invention provides a compound having a structure represented by formula (V-d) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere R\n13\n is Me, n-Pr, CH\n2\nOMe, or CH\n2\nOC(=O)CH\n2\nCH(Me)\n2\n; R\n14\n is Me or C(=O)Me; and R\n15\n is H or Ci-C\n5\n alkyl (preferably H, Me, or Et); R\n16\n is a lysine ((CH\n2\n)\n4\nNH\n2\n) or citrulline ((CH\n2\n)\n3\nNHC(=O)NH\n2\n) side chain group; R\n17\n is a valine (C(Me)\n2\n) or alanine (Me) side chain group; and p is 0 or 1. \n\n\n [00129] Examples of specific cytotoxic compound-linker constructs of this invention are shown below in formulae (VI-a) through (VI-t). Compound-linker (VI-n) is especially preferred. They have a maleimide group and are ready for conjugation to an antibody via a sulfhydryl group thereon, by a procedure such as that described below. \n\n\n \n \n\n (Vl-h) \n\n\n\n\n\n(VI-k)\n\n\n\n\n\n(VI-I)\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n Preparation of Conjugates \n\n\n [00130] The following is an illustrative procedure, based on introduction of free thiol groups into an antibody by reaction of lysine ε-amino groups with 2-iminothiolane, followed by reaction with a maleimide-containing drug-linker moiety such as described above. Initially the antibody is buffer exchanged into 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 50 mM NaCl and 2 mM diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) and concentrated to 5-10 mg/mL. Thiolation is achieved through addition of 2-iminothiolane to the antibody. The amount of 2-iminothiolane to be added can be determined by a preliminary experiment and varies from antibody to antibody. In the preliminary experiment, a titration of increasing amounts of 2-iminothiolane is added to the antibody, and following incubation with the antibody for 1 h at RT (room temperature, circa 25 \n0\nC), the antibody is desalted into 50 mM pH 6.0 HEPES buffer using a SEPHADEX™ G-25 column and the number of thiol groups introduced determined rapidly by reaction with dithiodipyridine (DTDP). Reaction of thiol groups with DTDP results in liberation of thiopyridine, which can be monitored spectroscopically at 324 nm. Samples at a protein concentration of 0.5-1.0 mg/mL are typically used. The absorbance at 280 nm can be used to accurately determine the concentration of protein in the samples, and then an aliquot of each sample (0.9 mL) is incubated with 0.1 mL DTDP (5 mM stock solution in ethanol) for 10 min at RT. Blank samples of buffer alone plus DTDP are also incubated alongside. After 10 min, absorbance at 324 nm is measured and the number of thiol groups is quantitated using an extinction coefficient for thiopyridine of 19,800 M\n\"1\n. \n\n\n[00131] Typically a thiolation level of about three thiol groups per antibody is desirable. For example, with some antibodies this can be achieved by adding a 15-fold molar excess of 2-iminothiolane followed by incubation at RT for 1 h. The antibody is then incubated with 2-iminothiolane at the desired molar ratio and then desalted into conjugation buffer (50 mM pH 6.0 HEPES buffer containing 5 mM glycine and 2 mM DTPA). The thiolated material is maintained on ice while the number of thiols introduced is quantitated as described above. \n\n\n[00132] After verification of the number of thiols introduced, the drug-linker moiety is added at a 3 -fold molar excess per thiol. The conjugation reaction is allowed to proceed in conjugation buffer also containing a final concentration of 5% dimethylsulfoxide \n\n\n(DMSO), or similar alternative solvent. Commonly, the drug-linker stock solution is \n\n dissolved in 100% DMSO. The stock solution is added directly to the thiolated antibody, which has enough DMSO added to bring the final concentration to 10%, or pre-diluted in conjugation buffer containing a final concentration of 10% DMSO, followed by addition to an equal volume of thiolated antibody. \n\n\n[00133] The conjugation reaction mixture is incubated at RT for 2 h with stirring.\n\n\nFollowing incubation, the conjugation reaction mixture is centrifuged and filtered through a 0.2 μm filter. Purification of the conjugate can be achieved through chromatography using a number of methods. In one method, the conjugate is purified using size-exclusion chromatography on a SEPHACRYL™ S200 column pre-equilibrated with 50 mM pH 7.2 HEPES buffer containing 5 mM glycine and 50 mM NaCl. Chromatography is carried out at a linear flow rate of 28 cm/h. Fractions containing conjugate are collected, pooled and concentrated. In an alternative method, purification can be achieved through ion- exchange chromatography. Conditions vary from antibody to antibody and should to be optimized in each case. For example, antibody-drug conjugate reaction mix is applied to an SP-SEPHAROSE™ column pre-equilibrated in 50 mM pH 5.5 HEPES containing 5mM glycine,. The antibody conjugate is eluted using a gradient of 0-1 M NaCl in equilibration buffer at pH 5.5. Relevant fractions containing the conjugate are pooled and dialyzed against formulation buffer (50 mM pH 7.2 HEPES buffer containing 5 mM glycine and 100 mM NaCl). \n\n\n[00134] Those skilled in the art will understand that the above-described conditions and methodology are exemplary and non-limiting and that other approaches for conjugation are known in the art and usable in the present invention. \n\n\n[00135] Using the foregoing techniques, compounds of this invention were conjugated using antibodies 2A10, an anti-PSMA antibody (Huang et al, US 2009/0297438); 2H5, an anti-CD70 antibody (Terrett et al., US 2009/0028872); 1F4, an anti-CD70 antibody\n\n\n(Coccia et al., WO 2008/074004); or 6A4, an anti-mesothelin antibody (Terrett et al., WO 2009/045957). The resulting conugates may be depicted by the following formulae, where Ab represents an antibody. Those skilled in the art will understand that in these formulae the cytotoxin-antibody compound ratio is shown as 1 : 1 for simplicity, but that in actuality the ratio is usually greater, such as between 2 to 3. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS \n\n\n [00136] In another aspect, the present disclosure provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the present disclosure formulated together with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. It may optionally contain one or more additional pharmaceutically active ingredients, such as an antibody or another drug. The pharmaceutical compositions can be administered in a combination therapy with another therapeutic agent, especially another anti-cancer agent. \n\n\n [00137] The pharmaceutical composition may comprise one or more excipients. Exci- pients that may be used include carriers, surface active agents, thickening or emulsifying agents, solid binders, dispersion or suspension aids, solubilizers, colorants, flavoring agents, coatings, disintegrating agents, lubricants, sweeteners, preservatives, isotonic agents, and combinations thereof. The selection and use of suitable excipients is taught in Gennaro, ed., Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 20th Ed. (Lippincott Williams & Wilkins 2003), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. \n\n\n[00138] Preferably, a pharmaceutical composition is suitable for intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, parenteral, spinal or epidermal administration (e.g., by injection or infusion). Depending on the route of administration, the active compound may be coated in a material to protect it from the action of acids and other natural conditions that may inactivate it. The phrase \"parenteral administration\" means modes of administration other than enteral and topical administration, usually by injection, and includes, without limitation, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarterial, intrathecal, intracapsular, intraorbital, intracardiac, intradermal, intraperitoneal, transtracheal, subcutaneous, subcuticular, intraarticular, subcapsular, subarachnoid, intraspinal, epidural and intrasternal injection and infusion. Alternatively, the pharmaceutical composition can be administered via a non-parenteral route, such as a topical, epidermal or mucosal route of administration, for example, intranasally, orally, vaginally, rectally, sublingually or topically. \n\n\n[00139] Pharmaceutical compositions can be in the form of sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions. They can also be formulated in a microemulsion, liposome, or other ordered structure suitable to achieve high drug concentration. \n\n\n[00140] The amount of active ingredient which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the subject being treated and the particular mode of administration and will generally be that amount of the \n\n composition which produces a therapeutic effect. Generally, out of one hundred per cent, this amount will range from about 0.01 per cent to about ninety-nine percent of active ingredient, preferably from about 0.1 per cent to about 70 per cent, most preferably from about 1 per cent to about 30 per cent of active ingredient in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. \n\n\n [00141] Dosage regimens are adjusted to provide a therapeutic response. For example, a single bolus may be administered, several divided doses may be administered over time, or the dose may be proportionally reduced or increased as indicated by the exigencies of the situation. It is especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in do- sage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. \"Dosage unit form\" refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subjects to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic response, in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. \n\n\n[00142] The dosage ranges from about 0.0001 to 100 mg/kg, and more usually 0.01 to 5 mg/kg, of the host body weight. For example dosages can be 0.3 mg/kg body weight, 1 mg/kg body weight, 3 mg/kg body weight, 5 mg/kg body weight or 10 mg/kg body weight or within the range of 1-10 mg/kg. Exemplary treatment regimens are \n\n\nadministration once per week, once every two weeks, once every three weeks, once every four weeks, once a month, once every 3 months, or once every three to 6 months. \n\n\nPreferred dosage regimens include 1 mg/kg body weight or 3 mg/kg body weight via intravenous administration, using one of the following dosing schedules: (i) every four weeks for six dosages, then every three months; (ii) every three weeks; (iii) 3 mg/kg body weight once followed by 1 mg/kg body weight every three weeks. In some methods, dosage is adjusted to achieve a plasma antibody concentration of about 1-1000 μg/mL and in some methods about 25-300 μg /mL. \n\n\n [00143] A \"therapeutically effective amount\" of a compound of the invention preferably results in a decrease in severity of disease symptoms, an increase in frequency and duration of disease symptom- free periods, or a prevention of impairment or disability due to the disease affliction. For example, for the treatment of tumor-bearing subjects, a \"therapeutically effective amount\" preferably inhibits tumor growth by at least about\n\n\n20%, more preferably by at least about 40%, even more preferably by at least about 60%, and still more preferably by at least about 80% relative to untreated subjects. A \n\n therapeutically effective amount of a therapeutic compound can decrease tumor size, or otherwise ameliorate symptoms in a subject, which is typically a human but can be another mammal. \n\n\n [00144] The pharmaceutical composition can be a controlled or sustained release formulation, including implants, transdermal patches, and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. See, e.g., Sustained and Controlled Release Drug Delivery Systems, J.R. Robinson, ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1978. \n\n\n[00145] Therapeutic compositions can be administered via medical devices such as (1) needleless hypodermic injection devices (e.g., US 5,399,163; 5,383,851; 5,312,335; 5,064,413; 4,941,880; 4,790,824; and 4,596,556); (2) micro-infusion pumps (US \n\n\n4,487,603); (3) transdermal devices (US 4,486,194); (4) infusion apparati (US 4,447,233 and 4,447,224); and (5) osmotic devices (US 4,439,196 and 4,475,196); the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. \n\n\n [00146] In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition can be formulated to ensure proper distribution in vivo. For example, to ensure that the therapeutic compounds of the invention cross the blood-brain barrier, they can be formulated in liposomes, which may additionally comprise targeting moieties to enhance selective transport to specific cells or organs.

Bpoc ester 62a is coupled with5 carboxylic acid 63 with HATU to yield an intermediate ester that is then hydrolyzed with LiOH to produce compound 64. Hydrogenation to remove the Cbz protecting group from compound 64, followed by HATU-mediated coupling with 6-maleimidohexanoic acid and removal of the Bpoc group with acetic acid yields amino acid 65. Another HATU- mediated coupling with compound 34a (Scheme 3, Fig. 3) yields compound 66. Removal0 of the Boc protecting group with TFA affords compound 67, ready for conjugation. \n\n [00219] Yet another mode of utilizing compounds of formula (VIII-b) is shown in Scheme 12 (Fig. 10). Starting from compound 34a, HATU-mediated coupling with compound 68 affords Boc ester 69. Removal of the Boc group with TFA and hydrolysis of the ester with LiOH affords amino acid 36, which can be elaborated as shown in Scheme 4 (Fig. 4) to prepare a composition suitable for conjugation. \n\n\n Example 11 - Compound 70 \n\n\n [00220] Compound 70. Tubulysin D (made per Peltier et al. 2006; 2 mg, 2.4 umol) was dissolved in MeOH at 0 \n0\nC. To this solution was added a drop of HCl (0.1 M). After stirring the reaction mixture for overnight at RT the solution was evaporated under vacuum to give a residue that was passed through a short column (DCM:MeOH 0-10%) to give compound 70 (1.3 mg, 1.6 umol, 67%) as an oil. MS (ES+) m/z, calculated: m+1, 772.42, found, 772. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [00221] Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the general methodology of the Schemes can be adapted to make compounds of this invention other than those specifically described above. For example, compound 14 (same as compound 49) can be used to make numerous other compounds of this invention by coupling it with other replacements for the Tup subunit. As another example, by changing the reagents used with compound 9 (Scheme 1), compounds 44 and 46 (Scheme 5), variations on groups R\n2\n and R\n3\n in formula (II) beyond those specifically exemplified can be synthesized. \n\n\n Example 12 - Preparation of a Conjugate \n\n\n [00222] This example describes the preparation of a conjugate of cytotoxin-linker construct (VI-b) and anti-CD70 monoclonal antibody 2H5 (Terrett et al., US \n\n\n2009/0028872 Al; Coccia et al., WO 2008/074004 A2). It is representative of the procedure used in the preparation of other conjugates. \n\n\n [00223] Anti-CD70 antibody 2H5 at ~5 mg/mL in 20 mM sodium phosphate, 50 mM NaCl, 100 μM DTPA, pH 7.5, was thiolated with a 13-fold molar excess of 2- \n\n iminothiolane. The thiolation reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 h at RT with continuous mixing. \n\n\n [00224] Following thiolation, the antibody was buffer exchanged into conjugation buffer (50 mM HEPES, 5 mM glycine, 2 mM DTPA, pH 6.0) via a PDlO column (Sephadex G-25). The concentration of the thiolated antibody was determined at 280 nm. The thiol concentration was measured using a dithiodipyridine assay. \n\n\n[00225] A 5 mM stock of construct (VI-b) in DMSO was added at a 3-fold molar excess per thiol of antibody and mixed for 90 min at RT. Following conjugation, 100 mM N-ethylmaleimide in DMSO was added at a 10-fold molar excess of thiol per antibody to quench any unreacted thiol groups. This quenching reaction was done for one h at RT with continuous mixing. \n\n\n [00226] The anti-CD70 antibody drug conjugate was 0.2 μm filtered prior to cation- exchange chromatographic purification. The SP SEPHAROSE™ High Performance Cation Exchange column (CEX) was regenerated with 5 column volumes (CVs) of 50 mM HEPES, 5 mM glycine, IM NaCl, pH 6.0. Following regeneration, the column was equilibrated with 3 CVs of equilibration buffer (50 mM HEPES, 5 mM glycine, pH 6.0). The conjugate was loaded and the column and was washed once with the equilibration buffer. The conjugate was eluted with 50 mM HEPES, 5 mM glycine, 200 mM NaCl, pH 6.0. The eluate was collected in fractions. The column was then regenerated with 50 mM HEPES, 5 mM glycine, IM NaCl, pH 6.0 to remove protein aggregates and any unreacted (VI-b). \n\n\n [00227] Fractions containing monomeric antibody conjugate were pooled. Antibody conjugate concentration and substitution ratios were determined by measuring absorbance at 280 and 252 nm. \n\n\n[00228] The purified eluate pool was buffer exchanged into 30 mg/mL sucrose, 10 mg/mL glycine, pH 6.0, by dialysis. Dextran 40 was added to the sample at 10 mg/mL post-dialysis. The concentration and substitution ratio (SR) were determined by measuring absorbance at 280 and 252 nm. The SR was 2.2 moles of cytotoxin per mole of antibody. \n\n Example 13 - Proliferation Assays \n\n\n [00229] This example generally describes the procedures used to assay the antiproliferative activity of compounds of this invention or their conjugates. Human tumor cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), P.O. Box 1549, Manassas, VA 20108, USA, and cultured according to instruction from the ATCC. Cells were seeded at 1.0 x 10\n3\n or 1.0 x 10\n4\n cells/well in 96-well plates for 3 h for ATP assays or \n3\nH thymidine assays, respectively. 1:3 serial dilutions of free \n\n\n(unconjugated) compounds or their conjugates were added to the wells. Plates were allowed to incubate for 24 to 72 h. The H thymidine plates were pulsed with 1.0 μCi of \n3\nH-thymidine per well for the last 24 hours of the total incubation period, harvested, and read on a Top Count Scintillation Counter (Packard Instruments, Meriden, CT). ATP levels in the ATP plates were measured using the CELLTITER-GLO Luminescent Cell Viability kit following the manufacturer's manual and read on a GLOMAX\n®\n 20/20 luminometer (both from Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The EC50 values - the concen- tration at which an agent inhibits or reduces cell proliferation by 50% - were determined using PRISM™ software, version 4.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). \n\n\n Example 14 - Cytotoxin In Vitro Activity \n\n\n [00230] Using the \n3\nH thymidine or the ATP luminescence assay, or both, the activities of compounds of this invention were assayed against the following cancer cell lines: HCT-15 (colorectal cancer, multi-drug resistant (MDR)); Hep3B (liver cancer); LNCaP (prostate cancer, androgen receptor positive (AR\n+\n)); MDA-MB-231 (breast cancer, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and Her2 negative (triple negative)); A2058 (melanoma); U-87 MG (glioblastoma); NCI-H460 (NSCLC); A549 (NSCLC); HPAC (pancreatic cancer, primary); PC3 (prostate cancer, AR ); BT474 (breast cancer, Her2 highly positive (Her2hi)); SKOV3 (ovarian cancer, Her2hi); 786-0 (renal cancer); UO-31 (renal cancer, MDR); NCI-H740 (SCLC); DMS53 (SCLC); SK-BR3 (breast cancer, Her2hi); ZR-75 (breast cancer, estrogen receptor positive); OVCAR3 (ovarian cancer); HL-60 (APL); OVCAR8/Adr (ovarian cancer, MDR); CEM-Cl (ALL); Nomo-1 (AML); RPMI-8226 (MM)); Raji (lymphoma); SW-480 (colorectal cancer, metastatic); SW-620 (colorectal cancer); and H226 (lung cancer). (Not all compounds were assayed against all cell lines.) \n\n [00231] The following compounds were used as reference or comparison cytotoxins: doxorubicin (Dox), Cytotoxin CBI (a DNA minor groove alkylating agent of the cyclopropa[c]benz[e]indol-4-one class), tubulysin D (Tub D, Table 1), and the methyl ester of MMAF (\"MMAF,\"an auristatin-related compound; see Sutherland et al, J. Biol. Chem. 2006, 281 (15), 10540-10547). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [00232] Figs. 11a and lib show illustrative plots for H thymidine proliferation assays for compounds of this invention, against HL-60 and 786-0 cells, respectively, with Cytotoxin CBI and tubulysin D as comparative compounds, with an incubation period of 48 h. \n\n\n [00233] Figs. 12a and 12b show illustrative plots for ATP luminescence proliferation assays for a second set of compounds of this invention, against HL-60 and 786-0 cells, respectively, with an incubation period of 72 h. Figs. 12c and 12d show the plots for \n3\nH thymidine proliferation assays for the same set of compounds, again against HL-60 and 786-0 cells, respectively, with a 72 h incubation period. In each instance, doxorubicin was used as a comparative compound. \n\n\n [00234] Table 2 provides the data for proliferation assays using the \n3\nH thymidine method, with an incubation period of 72 h. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2 (Part 2) -

Conversely, all the conjugates of an anti-CD70 antibody were active. The conjugates of Compounds (VI-a) and (VI-b) were comparable in activity to the Compound J conjugates, a well known conjugation partner and one of whose conjugates is undergoing clinical trials. It is noteworthy that the conjugates of Compounds (VI-a) and (VI-b) exhibit very little non-specific toxicity: compare the activities of 2A10-(VI-a) and 2A10-(VI-b) against that of 2A 10-CBI. \n\n Example 16 - Conjugate In Vivo Activity \n\n\n [00239] CD70-positive human renal cancer 786-0 cells (Cat. CRL-1932 originally acquired from ATCC) were cultured in vitro per ATCC instructions. The cells were harvested, and 2.5 million cells per 200 μL of DPBS/MATRIGEL™ (1: 1) were implanted subcutaneously in the flank region of CB 17. SCID mice. Tumors were measured weekly in 3 dimensions with a Fowler Electronic Digital Caliper (Model 62379-531; Fred V. Fowler Co., Newton, MA, USA) and data were electronically recorded using \n\n\nStudyDirector software from Studylog Inc. (South San Francisco, CA, USA). Animals were checked daily for postural, grooming, and respiratory changes, as well as lethargy. Animals were also weighed weekly and euthanized if weight loss was > 20%. When tumors reached an average size of 194 mm\n3\n, groups of 6 mice each were treated with a single intraperitoneal (IP) dose of a test conjugate (e.g., 2H5-(VI-b)) and an isotype control (2A10-(VI-b)) at 0.3 μmol/kg body weight. Tumor volumes (LWH/2) and weights of mice were recorded throughout the course of each study, which were allowed to proceed for approximately 2 months post initial dosing. An Excel spreadsheet macro was used to calculate the mean, SD, and median values of tumor sizes. Data were graphed using Prism software version 4.0. \n\n\n [00240] The xenograft study results are shown in Fig. 14, where legend labels have the same meaning as in the previous Example and in Fig. 13. The data demonstrate the in vivo activity of conjugates of compounds of this invention against CD70\n+\n 786-0 cells. Both conjugates of compounds (VI-a) and (VI-b) with the anti-CD70 antibody 2H5 caused a reduction in mean tumor size to less than half over the course of the study, while, when the vehicle control or a conjugate with the anti-PSMA antibody 2A10 was administered, tumor mean volume more than doubled. \n\n\nExample 17 - Scheme 13 \n\n\n [00241] Scheme 13 (Fig. 15) shows a method for making enantiomerically pure A- nitrotubuphenylalanines (4-NO\n2\nTup) 82a and 82b, which are useful for making compounds of this invention. \n\n\n [00242] Compound 80.
