Description\n\n\n\n\nThis application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 10/972,060, filed Oct. 22, 2004, which claims the benefit of Great Britain Patent Application No. 0324763.2, filed Oct. 23, 2003. The entirety of each of these applications is incorporated by reference herein.\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to indole derivatives that antagonize prostaglandin D\n2\n, and that can be used to treat inflammatory diseases mediated by prostaglandin D\n2\n.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to the use of certain compounds in the treatment and prevention of allergic diseases such as asthma, allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis and other inflammatory diseases mediated by prostaglandin D\n2 \n(PGD\n2\n) acting at the CRTH2 receptor on cells including eosinophils, basophils and Th2 lymphocytes.\n\n\nPGD\n2 \nis an eicosanoid, a class of chemical mediator synthesised by cells in response to local tissue damage, normal stimuli or hormonal stimuli or via cellular activation pathways. Eicosanoids bind to specific cell surface receptors on a wide variety of tissues throughout the body and mediate various effects in these tissues. PGD\n2 \nis known to be produced by mast cells, macrophages and Th2 lymphocytes and has been detected in high concentrations in the airways of asthmatic patients challenged with antigen (Murray et al, (1986), \nN. Engl. J. Med \n315:800-804). Instillation of PGD\n2 \ninto airways can provoke many features of the asthmatic response including bronchoconstriction (Hardy et al, (1984) \nN. Engl. J. Med \n311:209-213; Sampson et al, (1997) \nThorax \n52:513-518) and eosinophil accumulation (Emery et al, (1989) \nJ. Appl. Physiol. \n67:959-962).\n\n\nThe potential of exogenously applied PGD\n2 \nto induce inflammatory responses has been confirmed by the use of transgenic mice overexpressing human PGD\n2 \nsynthase which exhibit exaggerated eosinophilic lung inflammation and Th2 cytokine production in response to antigen (Fujitani et al, (2002) \nJ. Immunol. \n168:443-449).\n\n\nThe first receptor specific for PGD\n2 \nto be discovered was the DP receptor which is linked to elevation of the intracellular levels of cAMP. However, PGD\n2 \nis thought to mediate much of its proinflammatory activity through interaction with a G protein-coupled receptor termed CRTH2 (chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on Th2 cells) which is expressed by Th2 lymphocytes, eosinophils and basophils (Hirai et al, (2001) \nJ. Exp. Med. \n193:255-261, and EP0851030 and EP-A-1211513 and Bauer et al, EP-A-1170594). It seems clear that the effect of PGD\n2 \non the activation of Th2 lymphocytes and eosinophils is mediated through CRTH2 since the selective CRTH2 agonists 13,14 dihydro-15-keto-PGD\n2 \n(DK-PGD\n2\n) and 15R-methyl-PGD\n2 \ncan elicit this response and the effects of PGD\n2 \nare blocked by an anti-CRTH2 antibody (Hirai et al, 2001; Monneret et al, (2003) \nJ. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. \n304:349-355). In contrast, the selective DP agonist BW245C does not promote migration of Th2 lymphocytes or eosinophils (Hirai et al, 2001; Gervais et al, (2001) \nJ. Allergy Clin. Immunol. \n108:982-988). Based on this evidence, antagonising PGD\n2 \nat the CRTH2 receptor is an attractive approach to treat the inflammatory component of Th2-dependent allergic diseases such as asthma, allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis.\n\n\nEP-A-1170594 suggests that the method to which it relates can be used to identify compounds which are of use in the treatment of allergic asthma, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, autoimmune disease, reperfusion injury and a number of inflammatory conditions, all of which are mediated by the action of PGD\n2 \nat the CRTH2 receptor.\n\n\nCompounds which bind to CRTH2 are taught in WO-A-03066046 and WO-A-03066047. These compounds are not new but were first disclosed, along with similar compounds, in GB 1356834, GB 1407658 and GB 1460348, where they were said to have anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic activity. WO-A-03066046 and WO-A-03066047 teach that the compounds to which they relate are modulators of CRTH2 receptor activity and are therefore of use in the treatment or prevention of obstructive airway diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and a number of other diseases including various conditions of bones and joints, skin and eyes, GI tract, central and peripheral nervous system and other tissues as well as allograft rejection.\n\n\nPL 65781 and JP 43-24418 also relate to indole derivatives which are similar in structure to indomethacin and, like indomethacin, are said to have anti-inflammatory and antipyretic activity. Thus, although this may not have been appreciated at the time when these documents were published, the compounds they describe are COX inhibitors, an activity which is quite different from that of the compounds of the present invention. Indeed, COX inhibitors are contraindicated in the treatment of many of the diseases and conditions, for example asthma and inflammatory bowel disease for which the compounds of the present invention are useful, although they may sometimes be used to treat arthritic conditions.\n\n\nWe have now discovered that certain indole derivatives in which the indole nitrogen is substituted with a carboxylic acid moiety are antagonists of PGD\n2 \nat the CRTH2 receptor and are useful in a method for the treatment of diseases and conditions mediated by PGD\n2 \nat the CRTH2 receptor, the method comprising administering to a patient in need of such treatment a suitable amount of one of the compounds.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nIn one aspect the invention provides compounds of general formula (I):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nwherein\n\n\nR\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3 \nand R\n4 \nare independently hydrogen, halo, C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl, —O(C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl), —CON(R\n11\n)\n2\n, —SOR\n11\n, —SO\n2\nR\n11\n, —SO\n2\nN(R\n11\n)\n2\n, —N(R\n11\n)\n2\n, —NR\n11\nCOR\n11\n, —CO\n2\nR\n11\n, —COR\n11\n, —SR\n11\n, —OH, —NO\n2 \nor —CN;\n\n\n\n\neach R\n11 \nis independently hydrogen or C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl;\n\n \n \nR\n5 \nand R\n6 \nare each independently hydrogen, or C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl or together with the carbon atom to which they are attached form a C\n3\n-C\n7 \ncycloalkyl group;\n \nR\n7 \nis hydrogen or C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl;\n \nR\n8 \nis an aromatic moiety optionally substituted with one or more substituents selected from halo, C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl, —O(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl, —CON(R\n11\n)\n2\n, —SOR\n11\n, —SO\n2\nR\n11\n, —SO\n2\nN(R\n11\n)\n2\n, —N(R\n11\n)\n2\n, —NR\n11\nCOR\n11\n, —CO\n2\nR\n11\n, —COR\n11\n, —SR\n11\n, —OH, —NO\n2 \nor —CN;\n \n\n\nwherein R\n11 \nis as defined above;\n\n \n \nR\n9 \nis hydrogen, or C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl;\n \nprovided that:\n \n\n\nR\n8 \nis not phenyl substituted with —COOH;\n\n\nwhen any two of R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3 \nand R\n4 \nare hydrogen, neither of the other two of R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3 \nand R\n4 \nis C\n3\n-C\n6 \nalkyl;\n\n\nor a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate, solvate, complex or prodrug thereof;\n\n\nwherein the compounds are useful for the treatment or prevention of allergic asthma, perennial allergic rhinitis, seasonal allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, contact hypersensitivity (including contact dermatitis), conjunctivitis, especially allergic conjunctivitis, eosinophilic bronchitis, food allergies, eosinophilic gastroenteritis, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, mastocytosis and also other PGD\n2\n-mediated diseases, for example autoimmune diseases such as hyper IgE syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, acne, multiple sclerosis, allograft rejection, reperfusion injury, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as well as, in some cases, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and osteoarthritis.\n\n\nA second aspect of the invention provides compounds of a general formula (II):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nwherein R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, R\n5\n, R\n6\n, R\n7\n, R\n8 \nand R\n9 \nare as defined for general formula (I);

However, these compounds are said to be aldose reductase inhibitors useful in the treatment of diabetes mellitus (WO-A-9950268, WO-A-0032180 and WO-A-0164205) or hypouricemic agents (WO-A-0151849). There is no suggestion in any of these documents that the compounds would be useful for the treatment of diseases and conditions mediated by PGD\n2 \nat the CRTH2 receptor. The preferred compounds described in these prior art documents mostly have a benzothiazole substituent in the position equivalent to R\n8 \nof general formula (I).\n\n\nU.S. Pat. No. 4,363,912 relates to compounds similar to those of the present invention which are said to be inhibitors of thromboxane synthetase and to be useful in the treatment of conditions such as thrombosis, ischaemic heart disease and stroke. The compounds have a pyridyl group in the position equivalent to R\n8 \nof general formula (I).\n\n\nWO-A-9603376 relates to compounds which are said to be sPLA\n2 \ninhibitors which are useful in the treatment of bronchial asthma and allergic rhinitis. These compounds all have amide or hydrazide substituents in place of the carboxylic acid derivative of the compounds of the present invention.\n\n\nJP 2001247570 relates to a method of producing a 3-benzothiazolylmethyl indole acetic acid, which is said to be an aldose reductase inhibitor.\n\n\nU.S. Pat. No. 4,859,692 relates to compounds which are said to be leukotriene antagonists useful in the treatment of conditions such as asthma, hay fever and allergic rhinitis as well as certain inflammatory conditions such as bronchitis, atopic and ectopic eczema. The compounds of this document are similar to the compounds of general formula (I), but general formula (I) specifically excludes compounds in which R\n8 \nis phenyl substituted with a —COOH group, which is the only area of overlap. Furthermore, \nJ. Med. Chem., \n6(33):1781-1790 (1990), which has the same authors as this prior patent application, teaches that compounds with an acetic acid group on the indole nitrogen do not have significant peptidoleukotriene activity. In view of this, it is most surprising that the compounds of the present invention, which all have an acetic acid group on the indole nitrogen, are useful for treating conditions such as asthma, hay fever and allergic rhinitis.\n\n\nU.S. Pat. No. 4,273,782 is directed to compounds similar to those of general formula (I), which are said to be useful in the treatment of conditions such as thrombosis, ischaemic heart disease, stroke, transient ischaemic attack, migraine and the vascular complications of diabetes. There is no mention in the document of conditions mediated by the action of PGD\n2 \nat the CRTH2 receptor. The compounds of this prior art document all have an imidazole group in the position equivalent to R\n8 \nof general formula (I).\n\n\nU.S. Pat. No. 3,557,142 relates to 3-substituted-1-indole carboxylic acids and esters which are said to be useful in the treatment of inflammatory conditions.\n\n\nWO-A-03/097598 relates to compounds which are CRTH2 receptor antagonists. They do not have an aromatic substituent in the position equivalent to R\n8 \nof general formula (I).\n\n\nCross et al, \nJ. Med. Chem. \n29:342-346 (1986) relates to a process for preparing compounds similar to those of general formula (I) from the corresponding esters similar to the compounds of general formula (II). The compounds to which it relates are said to be inhibitors of thromboxane synthetase and all have an imidazole group in the position equivalent to R\n8 \nof general formula (I).\n\n\nEP-A-0539117 relates to leukotriene antagonists which are similar in structure to the compounds of general formula (I).\n\n\nUS 2003/0153751 relates to compounds which are sPLA\n2 \ninhibitors. Although the structural formula covers compounds similar to those of general formula (I), all of the exemplified compounds have bulky substituents at the 2- and 5-positions of the indole system and are therefore very different from the compounds of the present invention.\n\n\nUS 2004/011648 discloses compounds which are similar to the compounds of general formula (I) and which are inhibitors of PAI-1. There is no suggestion that the compounds might have CRTH2 antagonist activity.\n\n\nWO 2004/058164 relates to compounds which are said to be asthma and allergic inflammation modulators. The only compounds for which activity is demonstrated are entirely different in structure from the compounds of general formula (I).\n\n\nCompounds which bind to the CRTH2 receptor are disclosed in WO-A-03/097042 and WO-A-03/097598. These compounds are indole acetic acids but in WO-A-03/097042 the indole system is fused at the 2-3 positions to a 5-7 membered carbocyclic ring. In WO-A-03/097598 there is a pyrrolidine group at the indole 3-position.\n\n\nWO-A-03/101981 and WO-A-03/101961 both relate to compound which are said to be CRTH2 antagonists but which differ in structure from the compounds of general formula (I) because there is an —S— or —SO\n2\n— group linked to the indole 3-position in place of the CH\n2 \ngroup of the compounds of general formula (I).\n\n\nIn the present specification “C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl” refers to a straight or branched saturated hydrocarbon chain having one to six carbon atoms and optionally substituted with one or more halo substituents or with one or more C\n3\n-C\n7 \ncycloalkyl groups. Examples include methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, t-butyl, n-hexyl, trifluoromethyl, 2-chloroethyl, methylenecyclopropyl, methylenecyclobutyl and methylenecyclopentyl.\n\n\n“C\n1\n-C\n4 \nalkyl” and “C\n1\n-C\n18 \nalkyl” have similar meanings except that they contain from one to four and from one to eighteen carbon atoms respectively.\n\n\nC\n3\n-C\n7 \ncycloalkyl refers to a saturated 3 to 7 membered carbocyclic ring. Examples of such groups include cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl.\n\n\nIn the present specification, “halo” refers to fluoro, chloro, bromo or iodo.\n\n\nThe terms “aromatic moiety” and “aryl” in the context of the present specification refer to an aromatic ring system having from 5 to 14 ring carbon atoms and containing up to three rings, one or more of which may be replaced by a nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur atom. Examples of aromatic moieties are benzene, pyridine, naphthalene, biphenyl, quinoline, isoquinoline, quinazoline, thiazole, benzthiazole, benzoxazole, benzimidazole, indole, indazole and imidazole ring systems.\n\n\nAppropriate pharmaceutically and veterinarily acceptable salts of the compounds of general formulae (I) and (II) include basic addition salts such as sodium, potassium, calcium, aluminium, zinc, magnesium and other metal salts as well as choline, diethanolamine, ethanolamine, ethyl diamine and other well known basic addition salts.\n\n\nWhere appropriate, pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable salts may also include salts of organic acids, especially carboxylic acids, including but not limited to acetate, trifluoroacetate, lactate, gluconate, citrate, tartrate, maleate, malate, pantothenate, adipate, alginate, aspartate, benzoate, butyrate, digluconate, cyclopentanate, glucoheptanate, glycerophosphate, oxalate, heptanoate, hexanoate, fumarate, nicotinate, pamoate, pectinate, 3-phenylpropionate, picrate, pivalate, proprionate, tartrate, lactobionate, pivolate, camphorate, undecanoate and succinate, organic sulfonic acids such as methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, 2-hydroxyethane sulfonate, camphorsulfonate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p-chlorobenzenesulfonate and p-toluenesulfonate; and inorganic acids such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, sulfate, bisulfate, hemisulfate, thiocyanate, persulfate, phosphoric and sulfonic acids.\n\n\nSalts which are not pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable may still be valuable as intermediates.\n\n\nProdrugs are any covalently bonded compounds which release the active parent drug according to general formula (I) in vivo. Examples of prodrugs include alkyl esters of the compounds of general formula (I), for example the esters of general formula (II) below.\n\n\nIf a chiral centre or another form of isomeric centre is present in a compound of the present invention, all forms of such isomer or isomers, including enantiomers and diastereoisomers, are intended to be covered herein. Compounds of the invention containing a chiral centre may be used as a racemic mixture, an enantiomerically enriched mixture, or the racemic mixture may be separated using well-known techniques and an individual enantiomer may be used alone.\n\n\nIn the compounds of general formula (I), it is preferred that, independently or in any combination:\n\n\nR\n1 \nis halo or hydrogen;\n\n\nR\n2 \nis halo or hydrogen;\n\n\nR\n3 \nis halo or hydrogen;\n\n\nR\n4 \nis halo or hydrogen.\n\n\nIn more preferred compounds, R\n1\n, R\n3 \nand R\n4 \nare hydrogen, while R\n2 \nis halo, particularly fluoro.\n\n\nIn preferred compounds of general formula (I), R\n5 \nand R\n6 \nare each independently hydrogen or C\n1\n-C\n4 \nalkyl.

Compounds of general formulae (III) and (IV) are readily available or can be prepared by methods well known to those skilled in the art.\n \n\n\nOther methods of preparing compounds of general formulae (I) and (II) are set out in WO-A-9950268 and WO-A-0151489.\n\n\nCompounds of general formula (I) are antagonists of PGD\n2 \nat the CRTH2 receptor and compounds of general formula (II) are prodrugs for compounds of general formula (I). Compounds of general formulae (I) and (II) are therefore useful in a method for the treatment of diseases and conditions mediated by PGD\n2 \nat the CRTH2 receptor, the method comprising administering to a patient in need of such treatment a suitable amount of a compound of general formula (I) or (II).\n\n\nIn a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a novel compound of general formula (I) or (II) for use in medicine, particularly for use in the treatment or prevention of diseases and conditions mediated by PGD\n2 \nat the CRTH2 receptor.\n\n\nAs mentioned above, such diseases and conditions include allergic asthma, perennial allergic rhinitis, seasonal allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, contact hypersensitivity (including contact dermatitis), conjunctivitis, especially allergic conjunctivitis, eosinophilic bronchitis, food allergies, eosinophilic gastroenteritis, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, mastocytosis and also other PGD\n2\n-mediated diseases, for example autoimmune diseases such as hyper IgE syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, acne, multiple sclerosis, allograft rejection, reperfusion injury, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as well as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and osteoarthritis.\n\n\nThe compounds of general formula (I) or (II) must be formulated in an appropriate manner depending upon the diseases or conditions they are required to treat.\n\n\nTherefore, in a further aspect of the invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising a novel compound of general formula (I) or (II) together with a pharmaceutical excipient or carrier. Other active materials may also be present, as may be considered appropriate or advisable for the disease or condition being treated or prevented.\n\n\nThe carrier, or, if more than one be present, each of the carriers, must be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient.\n\n\nThe formulations include those suitable for oral, rectal, nasal, bronchial (inhaled), topical (including eye drops, buccal and sublingual), vaginal or parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous and intradermal) administration and may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy.\n\n\nThe route of administration will depend upon the condition to be treated but preferred compositions are formulated for oral, nasal, bronchial or topical administration.\n\n\nThe composition may be prepared by bringing into association the above defined active agent with the carrier. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active agent with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then if necessary shaping the product. The invention extends to methods for preparing a pharmaceutical composition comprising bringing a novel compound of general formula (I) or (II) in conjunction or association with a pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable carrier or vehicle.\n\n\nFormulations for oral administration in the present invention may be presented as: discrete units such as capsules, sachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active agent; as a powder or granules; as a solution or a suspension of the active agent in an aqueous liquid or a non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water in oil liquid emulsion; or as a bolus etc.\n\n\nFor compositions for oral administration (e.g. tablets and capsules), the term “acceptable carrier” includes vehicles such as common excipients e.g. binding agents, for example syrup, acacia, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth, polyvinylpyrrolidone (Povidone), methylcellulose, ethylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sucrose and starch; fillers and carriers, for example corn starch, gelatin, lactose, sucrose, microcrystalline cellulose, kaolin, mannitol, dicalcium phosphate, sodium chloride and alginic acid; and lubricants such as magnesium stearate, sodium stearate and other metallic stearates, glycerol stearate stearic acid, silicone fluid, talc waxes, oils and colloidal silica. Flavouring agents such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, cherry flavouring and the like can also be used. It may be desirable to add a colouring agent to make the dosage form readily identifiable. Tablets may also be coated by methods well known in the art.\n\n\nA tablet may be made by compression or moulding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active agent in a free flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, surface-active or dispersing agent. Moulded tablets may be made by moulding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active agent.\n\n\nOther formulations suitable for oral administration include lozenges comprising the active agent in a flavoured base, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active agent in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active agent in a suitable liquid carrier.\n\n\nFor topical application to the skin, compounds of general formula (I) or (II) may be made up into a cream, ointment, jelly, solution or suspension etc. Cream or ointment formulations that may be used for the drug are conventional formulations well known in the art, for example, as described in standard text books of pharmaceutics such as the British Pharmacopoeia.\n\n\nCompounds of general formula (I) or (II) may be used for the treatment of the respiratory tract by nasal, bronchial or buccal administration of, for example, aerosols or sprays which can disperse the pharmacological active ingredient in the form of a powder or in the form of drops of a solution or suspension. Pharmaceutical compositions with powder-dispersing properties usually contain, in addition to the active ingredient, a liquid propellant with a boiling point below room temperature and, if desired, adjuncts, such as liquid or solid non-ionic or anionic surfactants and/or diluents. Pharmaceutical compositions in which the pharmacological active ingredient is in solution contain, in addition to this, a suitable propellant, and furthermore, if necessary, an additional solvent and/or a stabiliser. Instead of the propellant, compressed air can also be used, it being possible for this to be produced as required by means of a suitable compression and expansion device.\n\n\nParenteral formulations will generally be sterile.\n\n\nTypically, the dose of the compound will be about 0.01 to 100 mg/kg; so as to maintain the concentration of drug in the plasma at a concentration effective to inhibit PGD\n2 \nat the CRTH2 receptor. The precise amount of a compound of general formula (I) or (II) which is therapeutically effective, and the route by which such compound is best administered, is readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art by comparing the blood level of the agent to the concentration required to have a therapeutic effect.\n\n\nCompounds of general formula (I) or (II) may be used in combination with one or more active agents which are useful in the treatment of the diseases and conditions listed above, although these active agents are not necessarily inhibitors of PGD\n2 \nat the CRTH2 receptor.\n\n\nTherefore, the pharmaceutical composition described above may additionally contain one or more of these active agents.\n\n\nThere is also provided the use of a compound of general formula (I) or (II) in the preparation of an agent for the treatment of diseases and conditions mediated by PGD\n2 \nat the CRTH2 receptor, wherein the agent also comprises an additional active agent useful for the treatment of the same diseases and conditions.\n\n\nThese additional active agents which may have a completely different mode of action include existing therapies for allergic and other inflammatory diseases including:\n\n\nβ2 agonists such as salmeterol;\n\n\ncorticosteroids such as fluticasone;\n\n\nantihistamines such as loratidine;\n\n\nleukotriene antagonists such as montelukast;\n\n\nanti-IgE antibody therapies such as omalizumab;\n\n\nanti-infectives such as fusidic acid (particularly for the treatment of atopic dermatitis);\n\n\nanti-fungals such as clotrimazole (particularly for the treatment of atopic dermatitis);\n\n\nimmunosuppressants such as tacrolimus and particularly pimecrolimus in the case of inflammatory skin disease.\n\n\nCRTH2 antagonists may also be combined with therapies that are in development for inflammatory indications including:\n\n\nother antagonists of PGD\n2 \nacting at other receptors, such as DP antagonists;\n\n\ninhibitors of phoshodiesterase type 4 such as cilonilast;\n\n\ndrugs that modulate cytokine production such as inhibitors of TNFα converting enzyme (TACE);\n\n\ndrugs that modulate the activity of Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-5 such as blocking monoclonal antibodies and soluble receptors;\n\n\nPPAR-γ agonists such as rosiglitazone;\n\n\n5-lipoxygenase inhibitors such as zileuton.\n\n\nIn yet a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a product comprising a novel compound of general formula (I) or (II) and one or more of the agents listed above as a combined preparation for simultaneous, separate or sequential use in the treatment of a disease or condition mediated by the action of PGD\n2 \nat the CRTH2 receptor.\n\n\nThe invention will now be described in greater detail with reference to the following non limiting examples.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nPreparation of Compounds 1 to 19\n\n\n1. {3-[1-(4-Chloro-phenyl)-ethyl]-5-fluoro-2-methyl-indol-1-yl}-acetic acid ethyl ester\n\n\nTriethylsilane (0.34 ml, 2.13 mmol) and trifluoroacetic acid (0.10 ml, 1.29 mmol) were sequentially added dropwise over 1 min to a stirred solution of (5-fluoro-2-methyl-indol-1-yl)-acetic acid ethyl ester (0.10 g, 0.43 mmol) and 4-acetylchlorobenzenze (64 mg, 0.41 mmol) in 1,2-dichloroethane (2 ml) at 0° C.

The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 15 min and then the solution was adjusted to pH ˜3 with 1 M hydrochloric acid. The aqueous layer was then extracted with ethyl acetate (3×10 ml) and the combined organic extracts were washed with brine (10 ml), dried and concentrated in vacuo to give the carboxylic acid (62 mg, 92%) as a yellow solid, 8H (400 MHz, d\n6\n-DMSO) 7.76-7.69 (1H, m, Ar), 7.56 (1H, d J 8.0 Hz, Ar), 7.48 (1H, s, CH), 7.43 (1H, d J 8.3 Hz, Ar), 7.18 (1H, app t J 7.1 Hz, Ar), 7.07 (1H, app t J 7.1 Hz, Ar), 5.05 (2H, s, CH\n2\n), 4.68 (2H, s, CH\n2\n); Tr=1.94 min, m/z (ES\n+\n) (M+H)\n+ \n377.00.\n\n\nExample 3\n\n\nMeasurement of CRTH2 Antagonist Activity\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\n\nMaterials\n\n\nCalcium-3 dye was purchased from Molecular Devices (Wokingham, UK). Mono-poly resolving medium was obtained from Dainippon Pharmaceuticals (Osaka, Japan). Macs anti-CD16 microbeads were from Miltenyi biotec (Bisley, Surrey). ChemoTx plates were purchased from Neuroprobe (Gaithesburg, Md.). Poly-D-lysine coated 96-well plates were obtained from Greiner (Gloucestershire, UK). [\n3\nH]PGD\n2 \nwas from Amersham Biosciences (Buckinghamshire, UK). [\n3\nH]SQ29548 was purchased from Perkin Elmer Life Sciences (Buckinghamshire, UK). All other reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Dorset, UK), unless otherwise stated.\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nCell Culture\n\n\nChinese Hamster Ovary cells were transfected with CRTH2 or DP receptors (CHO/CRTH2 and CHO/DP) and were maintained in culture in a humidified atmosphere at 37° C. (5% CO\n2\n) in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, and 1 mg ml\n−1 \nactive G418. The cells were passaged every 2-3 days. For radioligand binding assay, cells were prepared in triple-layer flasks or in 175 cm\n2 \nsquare flasks (for membrane preparation). For calcium mobilisation assay, cells were grown in a 96 well plate 24 h prior to the assay at a density of 80,000 cells per well.\n\n\nPreparation of Cell Membranes\n\n\nMembranes were prepared either from CHO/CRTH2 and CHO/DP cells, or from platelets (as a source of TP receptors). CHO cells grown to confluency were washed with PBS and detached using a Versene solution (15 ml per flask). When the cells were grown in 175 cm\n2 \nsquare flask, they were collected by scrapping in PBS. The cell suspensions were centrifuged (1,700 rpm, 10 min, 4° C.) and resuspended in 15 ml of buffer (1×HBSS, supplemented with 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.3). Cell suspensions were then homogenised using an Ultra Turrax at setting 4-6 for 20 s. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,700 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 1 h at 4° C. The resulting pellet was resuspended in buffer and stored at −80° C. in aliquots of 200-500 μl. The protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (1976), using bovine serum albumin as standard. The platelets were washed by centrifugation at 600×g for 10 min and resuspended in ice-cold assay buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mM Glucose, 120 mM NaCl, 10 μM indomethacin) and directly centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 30 min at 4° C. The resulting pellet was treated as described above.\n\n\nRadioligand Binding Assays\n\n\n[\n3\nH]PGD\n2 \n(160 Ci/mmol) binding experiments were performed on membranes prepared as described above. Assays were performed in a final volume of 100 μl of buffer (1×HBSS/HEPES 10 mM, pH 7.3). Cell membranes (15 μg). Cell membranes 15 mg were preincubated at room temperature with varying concentration of competing ligand for 15 min. [\n3\nH]PGD\n2 \n(mol, final concentration) was then added and the incubation continued for a further one hour at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 200 μl ice-cold assay buffer to each well, followed by rapid filtration through Whatman GF/B glass fibre filters using a Unifilter Cell harvester (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and six washes of 300 μl of ice-cold buffer. The Unifilter plates were dried at room temperature for at least 1 h and the radioactivity retained on the filters was determined on a Beta Trilux counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), following addition of 40 μl of Optiphase Hi-Safe 3 (Wallac) liquid scintillation. Non specific binding was defined in the presence of 10 μM unlabelled PGD\n2\n. Assays were performed in duplicate.\n\n\nThe results of the radioligand binding experiments to the CRTH2 and DP receptors are shown in Tables 1 and 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRadioligand binding data (Ki on CRTH2 Receptor).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompounds\n\n\nKi (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound 4\n\n\n5 ± 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound 6\n\n\n9 ± 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound 8\n\n\n6 ± 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound 12\n\n\n11 ± 2 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound 13\n\n\n6 ± 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound 17\n\n\n7 ± 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound 18\n\n\n1.3 ± 0.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound 20 (lidorestat)\n\n\n886 ± 248\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRadioligand binding data (Ki on DP Receptor).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompounds\n\n\nKi (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound 4\n\n\n30440 ± 9805\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound 6\n\n\n17870 ± 7290\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound 8\n\n\n 7710 ± 1780\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound 12\n\n\n12220 ± 2250\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound 18\n\n\n 7740 ± 1442\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound 20 (lidorestat)\n\n\n3960\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe TP receptor radioligand binding was done on membranes prepared from platelets. 15-40 μg of protein were pre-incubated with varying concentrations of competing ligand for 15 min at room temperature in assay buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mM glucose, 120 mM NaCl, 10 μM indomethacin). [\n3\nH]SQ29548 (38 Ci/mmol, 10 nM final concentration) was then added and the incubation continued for a further 30 min at room temperature.

The radioactivity was determined as described above.\n\n\nAll of the compounds studied in this assay bound to the TP receptor with low affinity (Ki>1 μM).\n\n\nCompounds of general formula (I) bound to CRTH2 receptor expressed in CHO cells with a range of affinity varying from very high to moderate. In fact the Ki values determined in competition versus [\n3\nH]PGD\n2 \nvaried from 500 pM to 1 μM. Compounds of general formula (I) had no activity (or very weak activity) at the DP and TP receptors. The binding selectivity of the compounds of general formula (I) for CRTH2 receptor was greater than 200 fold for CRTH2 receptor, compared to DP and TP receptors.\n\n\nCalcium Mobilisation Assay\n\n\nCells were seeded onto poly-D-lysine coated 96-well plates at a density of 80,000 cells per well and incubated at 37° C. overnight to allow the cells to adhere. Cells were washed twice with HBSS and incubated for 1 h at 37° C. in 100 μl HBSS and 100 μl calcium-3-dye (Molecular Devices), supplemented with 4 mM probenecid. Changes in fluorescence were monitored over a 50 s time course with agonist addition at 17 s using a Flexstation (Molecular Devices).\n\n\nEffect of CRTH2 Agonists on Calcium Mobilisation in CHO—CRTH2 Cells\n\n\nPGD\n2 \ncaused a dose-dependent increase in intracellular Ca\n2+\n mobilisation in CHO/CRTH2 cells, with an EC\n50\n=2.4±0.5 nM (n=3).\n\n\nEffect of Compounds of General Formula (I) on the Calcium Mobilisation Induced by PGD\n2 \n \n\n\nPGD\n2\n-stimulated Ca\n2+\n flux was fully inhibited by the compounds of general formula (I) and the IC\n50 \nvalue for each compound in the calcium assay was comparable to its Ki value in Radioligand binding. IC\n50 \nvalues of compounds of general formula (I) varied from 5 nM to 1 μM. The results for several compounds of general formula (I) are shown in Table 3. Increasing doses of the compounds of general formula (I) caused a dose-dependent and parallel shift of the PGD\n2 \ndose response curve in CHO/CRTH2 cells, thereby indicating that the compounds are competitive CRTH2 antagonists.\n\n\nThe antagonistic effect of the compounds of general formula (I) appears to be CRTH2 selective, since no inhibitory effect was seen with ATP-stimulated Ca\n2+\n flux.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInhibition of PGD\n2\n-induced calcium flux\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompounds\n\n\nIC\n50 \n(nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound 4\n\n\n55 ± 18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound 6\n\n\n30 ± 6 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound 7\n\n\n38 ± 16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound 8\n\n\n11 ± 6 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound 10\n\n\n47 ± 8 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound 12\n\n\n108 ± 29 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound 17\n\n\n64 ± 5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound 18\n\n\n10 ± 5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound 19\n\n\n34 ± 7 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound 20 (lidorestat)\n\n\n885 ± 96 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the preferred embodiment of the invention has been illustrated and described, it will be appreciated that various changes can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention."

Description\n\n\n\n\nThis application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 10/972,060, filed Oct. 22, 2004, which claims the benefit of Great Britain Patent Application No. 0324763.2, filed Oct. 23, 2003. The entirety of each of these applications is incorporated by reference herein.\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to indole derivatives that antagonize prostaglandin D\n2\n, and that can be used to treat inflammatory diseases mediated by prostaglandin D\n2\n.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to the use of certain compounds in the treatment and prevention of allergic diseases such as asthma, allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis and other inflammatory diseases mediated by prostaglandin D\n2 \n(PGD\n2\n) acting at the CRTH2 receptor on cells including eosinophils, basophils and Th2 lymphocytes.\n\n\nPGD\n2 \nis an eicosanoid, a class of chemical mediator synthesised by cells in response to local tissue damage, normal stimuli or hormonal stimuli or via cellular activation pathways. Eicosanoids bind to specific cell surface receptors on a wide variety of tissues throughout the body and mediate various effects in these tissues. PGD\n2 \nis known to be produced by mast cells, macrophages and Th2 lymphocytes and has been detected in high concentrations in the airways of asthmatic patients challenged with antigen (Murray et al, (1986), \nN. Engl. J. Med. \n315:800-804). Instillation of PGD\n2 \ninto airways can provoke many features of the asthmatic response including bronchoconstriction (Hardy et al, (1984) \nN. Engl. J. Med. \n311:209-213; Sampson et al, (1997) \nThorax \n52:513-518) and eosinophil accumulation (Emery et al, (1989) \nJ. Appl. Physiol. \n67:959-962).\n\n\nThe potential of exogenously applied PGD\n2 \nto induce inflammatory responses has been confirmed by the use of transgenic mice overexpressing human PGD\n2 \nsynthase which exhibit exaggerated eosinophilic lung inflammation and Th2 cytokine production in response to antigen (Fujitani et al, (2002) \nJ. Immunol. \n168:443-449).\n\n\nThe first receptor specific for PGD\n2 \nto be discovered was the DP receptor which is linked to elevation of the intracellular levels of cAMP. However, PGD\n2 \nis thought to mediate much of its proinflammatory activity through interaction with a G protein-coupled receptor termed CRTH2 (chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on Th2 cells) which is expressed by Th2 lymphocytes, eosinophils and basophils (Hirai et al, (2001) \nJ. Exp. Med. \n193:255-261, and EP0851030 and EP-A-1211513 and Bauer et al, EP-A-1170594). It seems clear that the effect of PGD\n2 \non the activation of Th2 lymphocytes and eosinophils is mediated through CRTH2 since the selective CRTH2 agonists 13,14 dihydro-15-keto-PGD\n2 \n(DK-PGD\n2\n) and 15R-methyl-PGD\n2 \ncan elicit this response and the effects of PGD\n2 \nare blocked by an anti-CRTH2 antibody (Hirai et al, 2001; Monneret et al, (2003) \nJ. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. \n304:349-355). In contrast, the selective DP agonist BW245C does not promote migration of Th2 lymphocytes or eosinophils (Hirai et al, 2001; Gervais et al, (2001) \nJ. Allergy Clin. Immunol. \n108:982-988). Based on this evidence, antagonising PGD\n2 \nat the CRTH2 receptor is an attractive approach to treat the inflammatory component of Th2-dependent allergic diseases such as asthma, allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis.\n\n\nEP-A-1170594 suggests that the method to which it relates can be used to identify compounds which are of use in the treatment of allergic asthma, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, autoimmune disease, reperfusion injury and a number of inflammatory conditions, all of which are mediated by the action of PGD\n2 \nat the CRTH2 receptor.\n\n\nCompounds which bind to CRTH2 are taught in WO-A-03066046 and WO-A-03066047. These compounds are not new but were first disclosed, along with similar compounds, in GB 1356834, GB 1407658 and GB 1460348, where they were said to have anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic activity. WO-A-03066046 and WO-A-03066047 teach that the compounds to which they relate are modulators of CRTH2 receptor activity and are therefore of use in the treatment or prevention of obstructive airway diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and a number of other diseases including various conditions of bones and joints, skin and eyes, GI tract, central and peripheral nervous system and other tissues as well as allograft rejection.\n\n\nPL 65781 and JP 43-24418 also relate to indole derivatives which are similar in structure to indomethacin and, like indomethacin, are said to have anti-inflammatory and antipyretic activity. Thus, although this may not have been appreciated at the time when these documents were published, the compounds they describe are COX inhibitors, an activity which is quite different from that of the compounds of the present invention. Indeed, COX inhibitors are contraindicated in the treatment of many of the diseases and conditions, for example asthma and inflammatory bowel disease for which the compounds of the present invention are useful, although they may sometimes be used to treat arthritic conditions.\n\n\nWe have now discovered that certain indole derivatives in which the indole nitrogen is substituted with a carboxylic acid moiety are antagonists of PGD\n2 \nat the CRTH2 receptor and are useful in a method for the treatment of diseases and conditions mediated by PGD\n2 \nat the CRTH2 receptor, the method comprising administering to a patient in need of such treatment a suitable amount of one of the compounds.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nIn one aspect the invention provides compounds of general formula (I):\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein\n\n \n \nR\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3 \nand R\n4 \nare independently hydrogen, halo, C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl, —O(C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl), - —CON(R\n11\n)\n2\n, —SOR\n11\n, —SO\n2\nR\n11\n, —SO\n2\nN(R\n11\n)\n2\n, —N(R\n11\n)\n2\n, —NR\n11\nCOR\n11\n, —CO\n2\nR\n11\n, —COR\n11\n, —SR\n11\n, —OH, —NO\n2 \nor —CN;\n \n\n\neach R\n11 \nis independently hydrogen or C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl;\n\n \n \nR\n5 \nand R\n6 \nare each independently hydrogen, or C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl or together with the carbon atom to which they are attached form a C\n3\n-C\n7 \ncycloalkyl group;\n \nR\n7 \nis hydrogen or C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl;\n \nR\n8 \nis an aromatic moiety optionally substituted with one or more substituents selected from halo, C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl, —O(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl, —CON(R\n11\n)\n2\n, —SOR\n11\n, —SO\n2\nR\n11\n, —SO\n2\nN(R\n11\n)\n2\n, —N(R\n11\n)\n2\n, —NR\n11\nCOR\n11\n, —CO\n2\nR\n11\n, —COR\n11\n, —SR\n11\n, —OH, —NO\n2 \nor —CN;\n \n\n\nwherein R\n11 \nis as defined above;\n\n \n \nR\n9 \nis hydrogen, or C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl;\n\n\nprovided that:\n\n \n\n\nR\n8 \nis not phenyl substituted with —COOH;\n\n\nwhen any two of R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3 \nand R\n4 \nare hydrogen, neither of the other two of R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3 \nand R\n4 \nis C\n3\n-C\n6 \nalkyl;\n\n\nor a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate, solvate, complex or prodrug thereof;\n\n\nwherein the compounds are useful for the treatment or prevention of allergic asthma, perennial allergic rhinitis, seasonal allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, contact hypersensitivity (including contact dermatitis), conjunctivitis, especially allergic conjunctivitis, eosinophilic bronchitis, food allergies, eosinophilic gastroenteritis, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, mastocytosis and also other PGD\n2\n-mediated diseases, for example autoimmune diseases such as hyper IgE syndrome and systemic lupus erythematus, psoriasis, acne, multiple sclerosis, allograft rejection, reperfusion injury, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as well as, in some cases, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and osteoarthritis.\n\n\nA second aspect of the invention provides compounds of a general formula (II):\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, R\n5\n, R\n6\n, R\n7\n, R\n8 \nand R\n9 \nare as defined for general formula (I);

However, these compounds are said to be aldose reductase inhibitors useful in the treatment of diabetes mellitus (WO-A-9950268, WO-A-0032180 and WO-A-0164205) or hypouricemic agents (WO-A-0151849). There is no suggestion in any of these documents that the compounds would be useful for the treatment of diseases and conditions mediated by PGD\n2 \nat the CRTH2 receptor. The preferred compounds described in these prior art documents mostly have a benzothiazole substituent in the position equivalent to R\n8 \nof general formula (I).\n\n\nU.S. Pat. No. 4,363,912 relates to compounds similar to those of the present invention which are said to be inhibitors of thromboxane synthetase and to be useful in the treatment of conditions such as thrombosis, ischaemic heart disease and stroke. The compounds have a pyridyl group in the position equivalent to R\n8 \nof general formula (I).\n\n\nWO-A-9603376 relates to compounds which are said to be sPLA\n2 \ninhibitors which are useful in the treatment of bronchial asthma and allergic rhinitis. These compounds all have amide or hydrazide substituents in place of the carboxylic acid derivative of the compounds of the present invention.\n\n\nJP 2001247570 relates to a method of producing a 3-benzothiazolylmethyl indole acetic acid, which is said to be an aldose reductase inhibitor.\n\n\nU.S. Pat. No. 4,859,692 relates to compounds which are said to be leukotriene antagonists useful in the treatment of conditions such as asthma, hay fever and allergic rhinitis as well as certain inflammatory conditions such as bronchitis, atopic and ectopic eczema. The compounds of this document are similar to the compounds of general formula (I), but general formula (I) specifically excludes compounds in which R\n8 \nis phenyl substituted with a —COOH group, which is the only area of overlap. Furthermore, \nJ. Med. Chem., \n6(33):1781-1790 (1990), which has the same authors as this prior patent application, teaches that compounds with an acetic acid group on the indole nitrogen do not have significant peptidoleukotriene activity. In view of this, it is most surprising that the compounds of the present invention, which all have an acetic acid group on the indole nitrogen, are useful for treating conditions such as asthma, hay fever and allergic rhinitis.\n\n\nU.S. Pat. No. 4,273,782 is directed to compounds similar to those of general formula (I), which are said to be useful in the treatment of conditions such as thrombosis, ischaemic heart disease, stroke, transient ischaemic attack, migraine and the vascular complications of diabetes. There is no mention in the document of conditions mediated by the action of PGD\n2 \nat the CRTH2 receptor. The compounds of this prior art document all have an imidazole group in the position equivalent to R\n8 \nof general formula (I).\n\n\nU.S. Pat. No. 3,557,142 relates to 3-substituted-1-indole carboxylic acids and esters which are said to be useful in the treatment of inflammatory conditions.\n\n\nWO-A-03/097598 relates to compounds which are CRTH2 receptor antagonists. They do not have an aromatic substituent in the position equivalent to R\n8 \nof general formula (I).\n\n\nCross et al, \nJ. Med. Chem. \n29:342-346 (1986) relates to a process for preparing compounds similar to those of general formula (I) from the corresponding esters similar to the compounds of general formula (II). The compounds to which it relates are said to be inhibitors of thromboxane synthetase and all have an imidazole group in the position equivalent to R\n8 \nof general formula (I).\n\n\nEP-A-0539117 relates to leukotriene antagonists which are similar in structure to the compounds of general formula (I).\n\n\nUS 2003/0153751 relates to compounds which are sPLA\n2 \ninhibitors. Although the structural formula covers compounds similar to those of general formula (I), all of the exemplified compounds have bulky substituents at the 2- and 5-positions of the indole system and are therefore very different from the compounds of the present invention.\n\n\nUS 2004/011648 discloses compounds which are similar to the compounds of general formula (I) and which are inhibitors of PAI-1. There is no suggestion that the compounds might have CRTH2 antagonist activity.\n\n\nWO 2004/058164 relates to compounds which are said to be asthma and allergic inflammation modulators. The only compounds for which activity is demonstrated are entirely different in structure from the compounds of general formula (I).\n\n\nCompounds which bind to the CRTH2 receptor are disclosed in WO-A-03/097042 and WO-A-03/097598. These compounds are indole acetic acids but in WO-A-03/097042 the indole system is fused at the 2-3 positions to a 5-7 membered carbocyclic ring. In WO-A-03/097598 there is a pyrrolidine group at the indole 3-position.\n\n\nWO-A-03/101981 and WO-A-03/101961 both relate to compound which are said to be CRTH2 antagonists but which differ in structure from the compounds of general formula (I) because there is an —S— or —SO\n2\n— group linked to the indole 3-position in place of the CH\n2 \ngroup of the compounds of general formula (I).\n\n\nIn the present specification “C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl” refers to a straight or branched saturated hydrocarbon chain having one to six carbon atoms and optionally substituted with one or more halo substituents or with one or more C\n3\n-C\n7 \ncycloalkyl groups. Examples include methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, t-butyl, n-hexyl, trifluoromethyl, 2-chloroethyl, methylenecyclopropyl, methylenecyclobutyl and methylenecyclopentyl.\n\n\n“C\n1\n-C\n4 \nalkyl” and “C\n1\n-C\n18 \nalkyl” have similar meanings except that they contain from one to four and from one to eighteen carbon atoms respectively.\n\n\nC\n3\n-C\n7 \ncycloalkyl refers to a saturated 3 to 7 membered carbocyclic ring. Examples of such groups include cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl.\n\n\nIn the present specification, “halo” refers to fluoro, chloro, bromo or iodo.\n\n\nThe terms “aromatic moiety” and “aryl” in the context of the present specification refer to an aromatic ring system having from 5 to 14 ring carbon atoms and containing up to three rings, one or more of which may be replaced by a nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur atom. Examples of aromatic moieties are benzene, pyridine, naphthalene, biphenyl, quinoline, isoquinoline, quinazoline, thiazole, benzthiazole, benzoxazole, benzimidazole, indole, indazole and imidazole ring systems.\n\n\nAppropriate pharmaceutically and veterinarily acceptable salts of the compounds of general formulae (I) and (II) include basic addition salts such as sodium, potassium, calcium, aluminium, zinc, magnesium and other metal salts as well as choline, diethanolamine, ethanolamine, ethyl diamine and other well known basic addition salts.\n\n\nWhere appropriate, pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable salts may also include salts of organic acids, especially carboxylic acids, including but not limited to acetate, trifluoroacetate, lactate, gluconate, citrate, tartrate, maleate, malate, pantothenate, adipate, alginate, aspartate, benzoate, butyrate, digluconate, cyclopentanate, glucoheptanate, glycerophosphate, oxalate, heptanoate, hexanoate, fumarate, nicotinate, pamoate, pectinate, 3-phenylpropionate, picrate, pivalate, proprionate, tartrate, lactobionate, pivolate, camphorate, undecanoate and succinate, organic sulfonic acids such as methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, 2-hydroxyethane sulfonate, camphorsulfonate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p-chlorobenzenesulfonate and p-toluenesulfonate; and inorganic acids such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, sulfate, bisulfate, hemisulfate, thiocyanate, persulfate, phosphoric and sulfonic acids.\n\n\nSalts which are not pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable may still be valuable as intermediates.\n\n\nProdrugs are any covalently bonded compounds which release the active parent drug according to general formula (I) in vivo.

Compounds of general formulae (I) and (II) are therefore useful in a method for the treatment of diseases and conditions mediated by PGD\n2 \nat the CRTH2 receptor, the method comprising administering to a patient in need of such treatment a suitable amount of a compound of general formula (I) or (II).\n\n\nIn a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a novel compound of general formula (I) or (II) for use in medicine, particularly for use in the treatment or prevention of diseases and conditions mediated by PGD\n2 \nat the CRTH2 receptor.\n\n\nAs mentioned above, such diseases and conditions include allergic asthma, perennial allergic rhinitis, seasonal allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, contact hypersensitivity (including contact dermatitis), conjunctivitis, especially allergic conjunctivitis, eosinophilic bronchitis, food allergies, eosinophilic gastroenteritis, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, mastocytosis and also other PGD\n2\n-mediated diseases, for example autoimmune diseases such as hyper IgE syndrome and systemic lupus erythematus, psoriasis, acne, multiple sclerosis, allograft rejection, reperfusion injury, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as well as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and osteoarthritis.\n\n\nThe compounds of general formula (I) or (II) must be formulated in an appropriate manner depending upon the diseases or conditions they are required to treat.\n\n\nTherefore, in a further aspect of the invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising a novel compound of general formula (I) or (II) together with a pharmaceutical excipient or carrier. Other active materials may also be present, as may be considered appropriate or advisable for the disease or condition being treated or prevented.\n\n\nThe carrier, or, if more than one be present, each of the carriers, must be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient.\n\n\nThe formulations include those suitable for oral, rectal, nasal, bronchial (inhaled), topical (including eye drops, buccal and sublingual), vaginal or parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous and intradermal) administration and may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy.\n\n\nThe route of administration will depend upon the condition to be treated but preferred compositions are formulated for oral, nasal, bronchial or topical administration.\n\n\nThe composition may be prepared by bringing into association the above defined active agent with the carrier. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active agent with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then if necessary shaping the product. The invention extends to methods for preparing a pharmaceutical composition comprising bringing a novel compound of general formula (I) or (II) in conjunction or association with a pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable carrier or vehicle.\n\n\nFormulations for oral administration in the present invention may be presented as: discrete units such as capsules, sachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active agent; as a powder or granules; as a solution or a suspension of the active agent in an aqueous liquid or a non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water in oil liquid emulsion; or as a bolus etc.\n\n\nFor compositions for oral administration (e.g. tablets and capsules), the term “acceptable carrier” includes vehicles such as common excipients e.g. binding agents, for example syrup, acacia, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth, polyvinylpyrrolidone (Povidone), methylcellulose, ethylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sucrose and starch; fillers and carriers, for example corn starch, gelatin, lactose, sucrose, microcrystalline cellulose, kaolin, mannitol, dicalcium phosphate, sodium chloride and alginic acid; and lubricants such as magnesium stearate, sodium stearate and other metallic stearates, glycerol stearate stearic acid, silicone fluid, talc waxes, oils and colloidal silica. Flavouring agents such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, cherry flavouring and the like can also be used. It may be desirable to add a colouring agent to make the dosage form readily identifiable. Tablets may also be coated by methods well known in the art.\n\n\nA tablet may be made by compression or moulding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active agent in a free flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, surface-active or dispersing agent. Moulded tablets may be made by moulding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active agent.\n\n\nOther formulations suitable for oral administration include lozenges comprising the active agent in a flavoured base, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active agent in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active agent in a suitable liquid carrier.\n\n\nFor topical application to the skin, compounds of general formula (I) or (II) may be made up into a cream, ointment, jelly, solution or suspension etc. Cream or ointment formulations that may be used for the drug are conventional formulations well known in the art, for example, as described in standard text books of pharmaceutics such as the British Pharmacopoeia.\n\n\nCompounds of general formula (I) or (II) may be used for the treatment of the respiratory tract by nasal, bronchial or buccal administration of, for example, aerosols or sprays which can disperse the pharmacological active ingredient in the form of a powder or in the form of drops of a solution or suspension. Pharmaceutical compositions with powder-dispersing properties usually contain, in addition to the active ingredient, a liquid propellant with a boiling point below room temperature and, if desired, adjuncts, such as liquid or solid non-ionic or anionic surfactants and/or diluents. Pharmaceutical compositions in which the pharmacological active ingredient is in solution contain, in addition to this, a suitable propellant, and furthermore, if necessary, an additional solvent and/or a stabiliser. Instead of the propellant, compressed air can also be used, it being possible for this to be produced as required by means of a suitable compression and expansion device.\n\n\nParenteral formulations will generally be sterile.\n\n\nTypically, the dose of the compound will be about 0.01 to 100 mg/kg; so as to maintain the concentration of drug in the plasma at a concentration effective to inhibit PGD\n2 \nat the CRTH2 receptor. The precise amount of a compound of general formula (I) or (II) which is therapeutically effective, and the route by which such compound is best administered, is readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art by comparing the blood level of the agent to the concentration required to have a therapeutic effect.\n\n\nCompounds of general formula (I) or (II) may be used in combination with one or more active agents which are useful in the treatment of the diseases and conditions listed above, although these active agents are not necessarily inhibitors of PGD\n2 \nat the CRTH2 receptor.\n\n\nTherefore, the pharmaceutical composition described above may additionally contain one or more of these active agents.\n\n\nThere is also provided the use of a compound of general formula (I) or (II) in the preparation of an agent for the treatment of diseases and conditions mediated by PGD\n2 \nat the CRTH2 receptor, wherein the agent also comprises an additional active agent useful for the treatment of the same diseases and conditions.\n\n\nThese additional active agents which may have a completely different mode of action include existing therapies for allergic and other inflammatory diseases including:\n\n\nβ2 agonists such as salmeterol;\n\n\ncorticosteroids such as fluticasone;\n\n\nantihistamines such as loratidine;\n\n\nleukotriene antagonists such as montelukast;\n\n\nanti-IgE antibody therapies such as omalizumab;\n\n\nanti-infectives such as fusidic acid (particularly for the treatment of atopic dermatitis);\n\n\nanti-fungals such as clotrimazole (particularly for the treatment of atopic dermatitis);\n\n\nimmunosuppressants such as tacrolimus and particularly pimecrolimus in the case of inflammatory skin disease.\n\n\nCRTH2 antagonists may also be combined with therapies that are in development for inflammatory indications including:\n\n\nother antagonists of PGD\n2 \nacting at other receptors, such as DP antagonists;\n\n\ninhibitors of phosphodiesterase type 4 such as cilonilast;\n\n\ndrugs that modulate cytokine production such as inhibitors of TNFα converting enzyme (TACE);\n\n\ndrugs that modulate the activity of Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-5 such as blocking monoclonal antibodies and soluble receptors;\n\n\nPPAR-γ agonists such as rosiglitazone;\n\n\n5-lipoxygenase inhibitors such as zileuton.\n\n\nIn yet a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a product comprising a novel compound of general formula (I) or (II) and one or more of the agents listed above as a combined preparation for simultaneous, separate or sequential use in the treatment of a disease or condition mediated by the action of PGD\n2 \nat the CRTH2 receptor.\n\n\nThe invention will now be described in greater detail with reference to the following non limiting examples.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nPreparation of Compounds 1 to 19\n\n\n1. {3-[1-(4-Chloro-phenyl)-ethyl]-5-fluoro-2-methyl-indol-1-yl}-acetic acid ethyl ester\n\n\nTriethylsilane (0.34 ml, 2.13 mmol) and trifluoroacetic acid (0.10 ml, 1.29 mmol) were sequentially added dropwise over 1 min to a stirred solution of (5-fluoro-2-methyl-indol-1-yl)-acetic acid ethyl ester (0.10 g, 0.43 mmol) and 4-acetylchlorobenzenze (64 mg, 0.41 mmol) in 1,2-dichloroethane (2 ml) at 0° C.

(5% CO\n2\n) in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, and 1 mg ml\n−1 \nactive G418. The cells were passaged every 2-3 days. For radioligand binding assay, cells were prepared in triple-layer flasks or in 175 cm\n2 \nsquare flasks (for membrane preparation). For calcium mobilisation assay, cells were grown in a 96 well plate 24 h prior to the assay at a density of 80,000 cells per well.\n\n \n \n \n \nPreparation of Cell Membranes\n \n \n \n\n\nMembranes were prepared either from CHO/CRTH2 and CHO/DP cells, or from platelets (as a source of TP receptors). CHO cells grown to confluency were washed with PBS and detached using a Versene solution (15 ml per flask). When the cells were grown in 175 cm\n2 \nsquare flask, they were collected by scrapping in PBS. The cell suspensions were centrifuged (1,700 rpm, 10 min, 4° C.) and resuspended in 15 ml of buffer (1×HBSS, supplemented with 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.3). Cell suspensions were then homogenised using an Ultra Turrax at setting 4-6 for 20 s. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,700 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 1 h at 4° C. The resulting pellet was resuspended in buffer and stored at −80° C. in aliquots of 200-500 μl. The protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (1976), using bovine serum albumin as standard. The platelets were washed by centrifugation at 600×g for 10 min and resuspended in ice-cold assay buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mM Glucose, 120 mM NaCl, 10 μM indomethacin) and directly centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 30 min at 4° C.

Assays were performed in a final volume of 100 μl of buffer (1×HBSS/HEPES 10 mM, pH 7.3). Cell membranes (15 μg). Cell membranes 15 mg were preincubated at room temperature with varying concentration of competing ligand for 15 min. [\n3\nH]PGD\n2 \n(mol, final concentration) was then added and the incubation continued for a further one hour at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 200 μl ice-cold assay buffer to each well, followed by rapid filtration through Whatman GF/B glass fibre filters using a Unifilter Cell harvester (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and six washes of 300 μl of ice-cold buffer. The Unifilter plates were dried at room temperature for at least 1 h and the radioactivity retained on the filters was determined on a Beta Trilux counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), following addition of 40 μl of Optiphase Hi-Safe 3 (Wallac) liquid scintillation. Non specific binding was defined in the presence of 10 μM unlabelled PGD\n2\n.

Description\n\n\n\n\nRELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\nThis application claims the benefit of priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/055,500, filed May 23, 2008, the content of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n1. Field of the Invention\n\n\nThe present invention relates to binding proteins and antigen-binding fragments thereof that bind interleukin-21 receptor (IL-21R), in particular, human IL-21R, and their use in regulating IL-21R-associated activities. The binding proteins disclosed herein are useful in treating and/or diagnosing IL-21R-associated disorders, e.g., inflammatory disorders, autoimmune diseases, allergies, transplant rejection, hyperproliferative disorders of the blood, and other immune system disorders.\n\n\n2. Related Background Art\n\n\nAntigens initiate immune responses and activate the two largest populations of lymphocytes: T cells and B cells. After encountering antigen, T cells proliferate and differentiate into effector cells, while B cells proliferate and differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells. These effector cells secrete and/or respond to cytokines, which are small proteins (less than about 30 kDa) secreted by lymphocytes and other cell types.\n\n\nHuman IL-21 is a cytokine that shows sequence homology to IL-2, IL-4 and IL-15 (Parrish-Novak et al. (2000) \nNature \n408:57-63). Despite low sequence homology among interleukin cytokines, cytokines share a common fold into a “four-helix-bundle” structure that is representative of the family. Most cytokines bind either class I or class II cytokine receptors. Class II cytokine receptors include the receptors for IL-10 and the interferons, whereas class I cytokine receptors include the receptors for IL-2 through IL-7, IL-9, IL-11, IL-12, IL-13, and IL-15, as well as hematopoietic growth factors, leptin, and growth hormone (Cosman (1993) \nCytokine \n5:95-106).\n\n\nHuman IL-21R is a class I cytokine receptor. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences encoding human IL-21 and its receptor (IL-21R) are described in International Application Publication Nos. \nWO\n 00/053761 and WO 01/085792; Parrish-Novak et al. (2000) supra; and Ozaki et al. (2000) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n97:11439-44. IL-21R has the highest sequence homology to the IL-2 receptor β chain and the IL-4 receptor α chain (Ozaki et al. (2000) supra). Upon ligand binding, IL-21R associates with the common gamma cytokine receptor chain (γc) that is shared by receptor complexes for IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-13 and IL-15 (Ozaki et al. (2000) supra; Asao et al. (2001) \nJ. Immunol. \n167:1-5).\n\n\nIL-21R is expressed in lymphoid tissues, particularly on T cells, B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells (DC) and macrophages (Parrish-Novak et al. (2000) supra), which allows these cells to respond to IL-21 (Leonard and Spolski (2005) \nNat. Rev. Immunol. \n5:688-98). The widespread lymphoid distribution of IL-21R indicates that IL-21 plays an important role in immune regulation. In vitro studies have shown that IL-21 significantly modulates the function of B cells, CD4\n+\n and CD8\n+\n T cells, and NK cells (Parrish-Novak et al. (2000) supra; Kasaian et al. (2002) \nImmunity \n16:559-69). Recent evidence suggests that IL-21-mediated signaling can have antitumor activity (Sivakumar et al. (2004) \nImmunology \n112:177-82), and that IL-21 can prevent antigen-induced asthma in mice (Shang et al. (2006) \nCell. Immunol. \n241:66-74).\n\n\nIn autoimmunity, disruption of the IL-21 gene and injection of recombinant IL-21 have been shown to modulate the progression of experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG) and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), respectively (King et al. (2004) \nCell \n117:265-77; Ozaki et al. (2004) \nJ. Immunol. \n173:5361-71; Vollmer et al. (2005) \nJ. Immunol. \n174:2696-2701; Liu et al. (2006) \nJ. Immunol. \n176:5247-54). In these experimental systems, it has been suggested that the manipulation of IL-21-mediated signaling directly altered the function of CD8\n+\n cells, B cells, T helper cells, and NK cells.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention describes the isolation and characterization of binding proteins, for example, human antibodies and fragments thereof, that specifically bind to the human and murine IL-21R. The binding proteins described herein are derived from antibody 18A5, which is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,495,085, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein. The binding proteins of the present invention have a much greater degree of affinity to human and/or murine IL-21R than does the parental 18A5 antibody.\n\n\nThe invention provides, at least in part, IL-21R binding agents (such as binding proteins and antigen-binding fragments thereof) that bind to IL-21R, in particular, human IL-21R, with high affinity and specificity. The binding proteins, and antigen-binding fragments thereof, of the present invention are also referred to herein as “anti-IL-21R binding proteins” and “fragments thereof,” respectively. In one embodiment, the binding protein or fragment thereof reduces, inhibits, or antagonizes IL-21R activity. Such binding proteins can be used to regulate immune responses or IL-21R-associated disorders by antagonizing IL-21R activity. In other embodiments, the anti-IL-21R binding protein can be used diagnostically, or as a targeting binding protein to deliver a therapeutic or cytotoxic agent to an IL-21R-expressing cell. Thus, the anti-IL-21R binding proteins of the invention are useful in diagnosing and treating IL-21R-associated disorders, e.g., inflammatory disorders, autoimmune diseases, allergies, transplant rejection, hyperproliferative disorders, and other immune system disorders.\n\n\nAccordingly, in one aspect, the binding proteins of the invention feature an isolated binding protein (e.g., an isolated antibody) or antigen-binding fragment thereof that binds to IL-21R, in particular, human IL-21R. In certain embodiments, the anti-IL-21R binding protein (e.g., antibody) can have one or more of the following characteristics: (1) it is a monoclonal or single specificity binding protein; (2) it is a human binding protein; (3) it is an in vitro-generated binding protein; (4) it is an in vivo-generated (for example, a transgenic mouse system) binding protein; (5) it inhibits the binding of IL-21 to IL-21R; (6) it is an IgG1; (7) it binds to human IL-21R with an association constant of at least about 10\n5 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1\n; (8) it binds to murine IL-21R with an association constant of at least about 5×10\n4\nM\n−1\ns\n−1\n; (9) it binds to human IL-21R with a dissociation constant of about 10\n−3\ns\n−1 \nor less; (10) it binds to murine IL-21R with a dissociation constant of about 10\n−2\ns\n−1 \nor less; (11) it inhibits human IL-21R-mediated proliferation of human IL-21R-expressing BaF3 cells with an IC\n50 \nof about 1.75 nM or less; (12) it inhibits murine IL-21R-mediated proliferation of murine IL-21R-expressing BaF3 cells with an IC\n50 \nof about 0.5 nM or less; (13) it inhibits human IL-21R-mediated proliferation of human IL-21R-expressing TF1 cells with an IC\n50 \nof about 14.0 nM or less; (14) it inhibits IL-21-mediated proliferation of human primary B cells with an IC\n50 \nof about 1.9 nM or less; (15) it inhibits IL-21-mediated proliferation of human primary CD4\n+\n T cells with an IC\n50 \nof about 1.5 nM or less; and (16) it inhibits IL-21-mediated proliferation of murine primary CD4\n+\n T cells with an IC\n50 \nof about 5.0 nM or less.\n\n\nNonlimiting illustrative embodiments of the binding proteins of the invention (the term “binding proteins” also includes and refers to antigen-binding fragments thereof, as appropriate) are referred to herein as AbA-AbZ, and correlation of these terms with terms used in U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/055,500 is presented in Table 2A.

Additionally, the present binding proteins show improved potency in binding to and neutralizing both human and murine IL-21R as compared to 18A5 in the equivalent format (e.g., scFv or IgG). High-potency neutralization of IL-21R from both species (human and mouse) by a single binding protein has not previously been reported. The present binding proteins having a greater neutralization potency than their parental antibody may translate into higher efficacy as compared to agents previously described. In addition, the amino acid sequence of the V\nH \nand V\nL \nframework regions has been altered to match sequences encoded by human genomic sequence, thereby reducing the potential for human anti-human antibody responses in patients treated with the present binding proteins.\n\n\nDEFINITIONS\n\n\nIn order that the present invention may be more readily understood, certain terms are first defined. Additional definitions are set forth throughout the detailed description and elsewhere in the specification.\n\n\nThe term “binding protein” as used herein includes any naturally occurring, recombinant, synthetic, or genetically engineered protein, or a combination thereof, that binds an antigen, target protein, or peptide, or a fragment(s) thereof. Binding proteins of the invention can include antibodies, or be derived from at least one antibody fragment. The binding proteins can include naturally occurring proteins and/or proteins that are synthetically engineered. Binding proteins of the invention can bind to an antigen or a fragment thereof to form a complex and elicit a biological response (e.g., agonize or antagonize a particular biological activity). Binding proteins can include isolated antibody fragments, “Fv” fragments consisting of the variable regions of the heavy and light chains of an antibody, recombinant single-chain polypeptide molecules in which light and heavy chain variable regions are connected by a peptide linker (“scFv proteins”), and minimal recognition units consisting of the amino acid residues that mimic the hypervariable region. Binding protein fragments can also include functional fragments of an antibody, such as, for example, Fab, Fab′, F(ab′)\n2\n, Fc, Fd, Fd′, Fv, and a single variable domain of an antibody (dAb). The binding proteins can be double or single chain, and can comprise a single binding domain or multiple binding domains.\n\n\nBinding proteins can also include binding domain-immunoglobulin fusion proteins, including a binding domain polypeptide that is fused or otherwise connected to an immunoglobulin hinge or hinge-acting region polypeptide, which in turn is fused or otherwise connected to a region comprising one or more native or engineered constant regions from an immunoglobulin heavy chain other than CH1, for example, the CH2 and CH3 regions of IgG and IgA, or the CH3 and CH4 regions of IgE (see, e.g., Ledbetter et al., U.S. Patent Publication 2005/0136049, for a more complete description). The binding domain-immunoglobulin fusion protein can further include a region that includes a native or engineered immunoglobulin heavy chain CH2 constant region polypeptide (or CH3 in the case of a construct derived in whole or in part from IgE) that is fused or otherwise connected to the hinge region polypeptide, and a native or engineered immunoglobulin heavy chain CH3 constant region polypeptide (or CH4 in the case of a construct derived in whole or in part from IgE) that is fused or otherwise connected to the CH2 constant region polypeptide (or CH3 in the case of a construct derived in whole or in part from IgE). Typically, such binding domain-immunoglobulin fusion proteins are capable of at least one immunological activity selected from the group consisting of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, complement fixation, and/or binding to a target, for example, a target antigen. The binding proteins of the invention can be derived from any species including, but not limited to mouse, human, camel, llama, fish, shark, goat, rabbit, chicken, and bovine.\n\n\nThe term “antibody” as used herein refers to an immunoglobulin that is reactive to a designated protein or peptide or fragment thereof. Suitable antibodies include, but are not limited to, human antibodies, primatized antibodies, chimeric antibodies, monoclonal antibodies, monospecific antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, polyspecific antibodies, nonspecific antibodies, bispecific antibodies, multispecific antibodies, humanized antibodies, synthetic antibodies, recombinant antibodies, hybrid antibodies, mutated antibodies, grafted conjugated antibodies (i.e., antibodies conjugated or fused to other proteins, radiolabels, cytotoxins), and in vitro-generated antibodies. The antibody can be from any class of antibodies including, but not limited to, IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD, and IgE, and from any subclass (e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4) of antibodies. The antibody can have a heavy chain constant region chosen from, e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4. The antibody can also have a light chain chosen from, e.g., kappa (κ) or lambda (λ). The antibodies of the invention can be derived from any species including, but not limited to mouse, human, camel, llama, fish, shark, goat, rabbit, chicken, and bovine. Constant regions of the antibodies can be altered, e.g., mutated, to modify the properties of the antibody (e.g., to increase or decrease one or more of: Fc receptor binding, antibody glycosylation, the number of cysteine residues, effector cell function, or complement function). Typically, the antibody specifically binds to a predetermined antigen, e.g., an antigen associated with a disorder, e.g., an inflammatory, immune, autoimmune, neurodegenerative, metabolic, and/or malignant disorder.\n\n\nThe term “single domain binding protein” as used herein includes any single domain binding scaffold that binds to an antigen, protein, or polypeptide. Single domain binding proteins can include any natural, recombinant, synthetic, or genetically engineered protein scaffold, or a combination thereof, that binds an antigen or fragment thereof to form a complex and elicit a biological response (e.g., agonize or antagonize a particular biological activity). Single domain binding proteins may be derived from naturally occurring proteins or antibodies, or they can be synthetically engineered or produced by recombinant technology. Single domain binding proteins may be any in the art or any future single domain binding proteins, and may be derived from any species including, but not limited to mouse, human, camel, llama, fish, shark, goat, rabbit, chicken, and bovine. In some embodiments of the invention, a single domain binding protein scaffold can be derived from a variable region of the immunoglobulin found in fish, such as, for example, that which is derived from the immunoglobulin isotype known as Novel Antigen Receptor (NAR) found in the serum of shark. Methods of producing single domain binding scaffolds derived from a variable region of NAR (“IgNARs”) are described in International Application Publication No. WO 03/014161 and Streltsov (2005) \nProtein Sci. \n14(11):2901-09.\n\n\nIn other embodiments, a single domain binding protein is a naturally occurring single domain binding protein which has been described in the art as a heavy chain antibody devoid of light chains. Such single domain binding proteins are disclosed in, e.g., International Application Publication No. WO 94/004678. For clarity reasons, a variable domain binding protein that is derived from a heavy chain antibody naturally devoid of light chain is known herein as a VHH or “nanobody” to distinguish it from the conventional V\nH \nof four-chain immunoglobulins. Such a VHH molecule can be derived from antibodies raised in Camelidae species, for example in camel, llama, dromedary, alpaca, and guanaco. Other families besides Camelidae may also be used to produce heavy chain binding proteins naturally devoid of light chains. VHH molecules are approximately ten times smaller than traditional IgG molecules. They are single polypeptides and are very stable, resisting extreme pH and temperature conditions. Moreover, they are resistant to the action of proteases, which is not the case for conventional antibodies. Furthermore, in vitro expression of VHHs can produce high-yield, properly folded functional VHHs. In addition, binding proteins generated in Camelids can recognize epitopes other than those recognized by antibodies generated in vitro via antibody libraries or via immunization of mammals other than Camelids (see, e.g., International Application Publication Nos. WO 97/049805 and WO 94/004678, both hereby incorporated by reference herein).\n\n\nThe terms “antigen-binding domain” and “antigen-binding fragment” refer to a part of a binding protein that comprises amino acids responsible for the specific binding between the binding protein and an antigen. The part of the antigen that is specifically recognized and bound by the binding protein is referred to as the “epitope.” An antigen-binding domain may comprise a light chain variable region (V\nL\n) and a heavy chain variable region (V\nH\n) of an antibody; however, it does not have to comprise both. Fd fragments, for example, have two V\nH \nregions and often retain antigen-binding function of the intact antigen-binding domain. Examples of antigen-binding fragments of a binding protein include, but are not limited to: (1) a Fab fragment, a monovalent fragment having V\nL\n, V\nH\n, C\nL \nand \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 domains; (2) a F(ab′)\n2 \nfragment, a bivalent fragment having two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; (3) an Fd fragment, having two V\nH \nand one \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 domains; (4) an Fv fragment, having the V\nL \nand V\nH \ndomains of a single arm of an antibody; (5) a dAb fragment (see, e.g., Ward et al. (1989) \nNature \n341:544-46), having a V\nH \ndomain; (6) an isolated CDR; and (7) a single chain variable fragment (scFv). Although the two domains of an Fv fragment, V\nL \nand V\nH \nare coded for by separate genes, they can be joined, using recombinant methods, by a synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a single protein chain in which the V\nL \nand V\nH \nregions pair to form monovalent molecules (known as scFv) (see, e.g., Bird et al. (1988) \nScience \n242:423-26; Huston et al. (1988) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n85:5879-83). These binding domain fragments can be obtained using conventional techniques known to those with skill in the art, and the fragments are evaluated for function in the same manner as are intact binding proteins such as, for example, antibodies.\n\n\nThe term “neutralizing” refers to a binding protein or antigen-binding fragment thereof (for example, an antibody) that reduces or blocks the activity of a signaling pathway or an antigen, e.g., IL-21/IL-21R signaling pathway or IL-21R antigen.\n\n\nThe term “effective amount” refers to a dosage or amount that is sufficient to regulate IL-21R activity to ameliorate or lessen the severity of clinical symptoms or achieve a desired biological outcome, e.g., decreased T cell and/or B cell activity, suppression of autoimmunity, suppression of transplant rejection.\n\n\nThe term “human binding protein” includes binding proteins having variable and constant regions corresponding substantially to human germline immunoglobulin sequences known in the art, including, for example, those described by Kabat et al. (5th ed. 1991) \nSequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest\n, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH Publication No. 91-3242. The human antibodies of the invention may include amino acid residues not encoded by human germline immunoglobulin sequences (e.g., mutations introduced by random or site-specific mutagenesis in vitro or by somatic mutation in vivo), for example, in the CDRs, and in particular, CDR3. The human antibody can have at least one, two, three, four, five, or more positions replaced with an amino acid residue that is not encoded by the human germline immunoglobulin sequence.\n\n\nThe phrases “inhibit,” “antagonize,” “block,” or “neutralize” IL-21R activity and its cognates refer to a reduction, inhibition, or otherwise diminution of at least one activity of IL-21R due to binding an anti-IL-21R antibody, wherein the reduction is relative to the activity of IL-21R in the absence of the same antibody. The IL-21R activity can be measured using any technique known in the art. Inhibition or antagonism does not necessarily indicate a total elimination of the IL-21R biological activity. A reduction in activity may be about 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, or more.\n\n\nThe terms “interleukin-21 receptor” or “IL-21R” or the like refer to a class I cytokine family receptor, also known as MU-1 (see, e.g., U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/569,384 and U.S. Application Publication Nos. 2004/0265960; 2006/0159655; 2006/0024268; and 2008/0241098), NILR or zalpha 11 (see, e.g., International Application Publication No. WO 01/085792; Parrish-Novak et al. (2000) supra; Ozaki et al. (2000) supra), that binds to an IL-21 ligand. IL-21R is homologous to the shared β chain of the IL-2 and IL-15 receptors, and IL-4α (Ozaki et al. (2000) supra). Upon ligand binding, IL-21R is capable of interacting with a common gamma cytokine receptor chain (γc) and inducing the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 (Asao et al. (2001) supra) or STATS (Ozaki et al. (2000) supra). IL-21R shows widespread lymphoid tissue distribution. The terms “interleukin-21 receptor” or “IL-21R” or the like also refer to a polypeptide (preferably of mammalian origin, e.g., murine or human IL-21R) or, as context requires, a polynucleotide encoding such a polypeptide, that is capable of interacting with IL-21 (preferably IL-21 of mammalian origin, e.g., murine or human IL-21) and has at least one of the following features: (1) an amino acid sequence of a naturally occurring mammalian IL-21R polypeptide or a fragment thereof, e.g., an amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:2 (human—corresponding to GENBANK® (U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, Bethesda, Md.) Accession No. NP\n—\n068570) or SEQ ID NO:4 (murine—corresponding to GENBANK® Acc. No. NP\n—\n068687), or a fragment thereof; (2) an amino acid sequence substantially homologous to, e.g., at least 85%, 90%, 95%, 98%, or 99% homologous to, an amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:2 or SEQ ID NO:4, or a fragment thereof; (3) an amino acid sequence that is encoded by a naturally occurring mammalian IL-21R nucleotide sequence or fragment thereof (e.g., SEQ ID NO:1 (human—which comprises an open reading frame corresponding to the open reading frame of GENBANK® Accession No. NM\n—\n021798) or SEQ ID NO:3 (murine—which comprises an open reading frame corresponding to the open reading frame of GENBANK® Acc. No. NM\n—\n021887), or a fragment thereof); (4) an amino acid sequence encoded by a nucleotide sequence which is substantially homologous to, e.g., at least 85%, 90%, 95%, 98%, or 99% homologous to, a nucleotide sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:1 or SEQ ID NO:3 or a fragment thereof; (5) an amino acid sequence encoded by a nucleotide sequence degenerate to a naturally occurring IL-21R nucleotide sequence or a fragment thereof, e.g., SEQ ID NO:1 or SEQ ID NO:3, or a fragment thereof; or (6) a nucleotide sequence that hybridizes to one of the foregoing nucleotide sequences under stringent conditions, e.g., highly stringent conditions. In addition, other nonhuman and nonmammalian IL-21Rs are contemplated as useful in the disclosed methods.\n\n\nThe term “interleukin-21” or “IL-21” refers to a cytokine that shows sequence homology to IL-2, IL-4 and IL-15 (Parrish-Novak et al. (2000) supra), and binds to an IL-21R. Such cytokines share a common fold into a “four-helix-bundle” structure that is representative of the family. IL-21 is expressed primarily in activated CD4\n+\n T cells, and has been reported to have effects on NK, B and T cells (Parrish-Novak et al. (2000) supra; Kasaian et al. (2002) supra). Upon IL-21 binding to IL-21R, activation of IL-21R leads to, e.g., STAT5 or STAT3 signaling (Ozaki et al. (2000) supra). The term “interleukin-21” or “IL-21” also refers to a polypeptide (preferably of mammalian origin, e.g., murine or human IL-21), or as context requires, a polynucleotide encoding such a polypeptide, that is capable of interacting with IL-21R (preferably of mammalian origin, e.g., murine or human IL-21R) and has at least one of the following features: (1) an amino acid sequence of a naturally occurring mammalian IL-21 or a fragment thereof, e.g., an amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:212 (human), or a fragment thereof; (2) an amino acid sequence substantially homologous to, e.g., at least 85%, 90%, 95%, 98%, or 99% homologous to, an amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:212, or a fragment thereof; (3) an amino acid sequence which is encoded by a naturally occurring mammalian IL-21 nucleotide sequence or a fragment thereof (e.g., SEQ ID NO:211 (human), or a fragment thereof); (4) an amino acid sequence encoded by a nucleotide sequence which is substantially homologous to, e.g., at least 85%, 90%, 95%, 98%, or 99% homologous to, a nucleotide sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:211 or a fragment thereof; (5) an amino acid sequence encoded by a nucleotide sequence degenerate to a naturally occurring IL-21 nucleotide sequence or a fragment thereof; or (6) a nucleotide sequence that hybridizes to one of the foregoing nucleotide sequences under stringent conditions, e.g., highly stringent conditions.\n\n\nThe terms “IL-21R activity” and the like (e.g., “activity of IL-21R,” “IL-21/IL-21R activity”) refer to at least one cellular process initiated or interrupted as a result of IL-21R binding. IL-21R activities include, but are not limited to: (1) interacting with, e.g., binding to, a ligand, e.g., an IL-21 polypeptide; (2) associating with or activating signal transduction (also called “signaling,” which refers to the intracellular cascade occurring in response to a particular stimuli) and signal transduction molecules (e.g., gamma chain (γc) and JAK1), and/or stimulating the phosphorylation and/or activation of STAT proteins, e.g., STAT5 and/or STAT3; and (3) modulating the proliferation, differentiation, effector cell function, cytolytic activity, cytokine secretion, and/or survival of immune cells, e.g., T cells, NK cells, B cells, macrophages, regulatory T cells (Tregs) and megakaryocytes.\n\n\nAs used herein, “in vitro-generated antibody” refers to an antibody where all or part of the variable region (e.g., at least one CDR) is generated in a nonimmune cell selection (e.g., an in vitro phage display, protein chip, or any other method in which candidate sequences can be tested for their ability to bind to an antigen).\n\n\nThe term “isolated” refers to a molecule that is substantially free of its natural environment. For instance, an isolated protein is substantially free of cellular material or other proteins from the cell or tissue source from which it was derived. The term also refers to preparations where the isolated protein is sufficiently pure for pharmaceutical compositions, or is at least 70-80% (w/w) pure, at least 80-90% (w/w) pure, at least 90-95% (w/w) pure, or at least 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% (w/w) pure.\n\n\nThe phrase “percent identical” or “percent identity” refers to the similarity between at least two different sequences. This percent identity can be determined by standard alignment algorithms, for example, the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) described by Altshul et al. ((1990) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n215:403-10); the algorithm of Needleman et al. ((1970) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n48:444-53); or the algorithm of Meyers et al. ((1988) \nComput. Appl. Biosci. \n4:11-17). A set of parameters may be the Blosum 62 scoring matrix with a gap penalty of 12, a gap extend penalty of 4, and a frameshift gap penalty of 5. The percent identity between two amino acid or nucleotide sequences can also be determined using the algorithm of Meyers and Miller ((1989) \nCABIOS \n4:11-17), which has been incorporated into the ALIGN program (version 2.0), using a PAM120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12, and a gap penalty of 4. The percent identity is usually calculated by comparing sequences of similar length.\n\n\nThe term “repertoire” refers to at least one nucleotide sequence derived wholly or partially from at least one sequence encoding at least one immunoglobulin.\n\n\nThe sequence(s) may be generated by rearrangement in vivo of the V, D, and J segments of heavy chains, and the V and J segments of light chains. Alternatively, the sequence(s) can be generated from a cell in response to which rearrangement occurs, e.g., in vitro stimulation. Alternatively, part or all of the sequence(s) may be obtained by DNA splicing, nucleotide synthesis, mutagenesis, or other methods (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,565,332). A repertoire may include only one sequence or may include a plurality of sequences, including ones in a genetically diverse collection.\n\n\nThe terms “specific binding,” “specifically binds,” and the like refer to two molecules forming a complex that is relatively stable under physiologic conditions. Specific binding is characterized by a high affinity and a low-to-moderate capacity as distinguished from nonspecific binding, which usually has a low affinity with a moderate-to-high capacity. Typically, binding is considered specific when the association constant Ka is higher than about 10\n6 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1\n. If necessary, nonspecific binding can be reduced without substantially affecting specific binding by varying the binding conditions. The appropriate binding conditions, such as concentration of binding protein, ionic strength of the solution, temperature, time allowed for binding, concentration of a blocking agent (e.g., serum albumin or milk casein), etc., can be improved by a skilled artisan using routine techniques. Illustrative conditions are set forth herein, but other conditions known to the person of ordinary skill in the art fall within the scope of this invention.\n\n\nAs used herein, the terms “stringent,” “stringency,” and the like describe conditions for hybridization and washing. The isolated polynucleotides of the present invention can be used as hybridization probes and primers to identify and isolate nucleic acids having sequences identical to or similar to those encoding the disclosed polynucleotides. Therefore, polynucleotides isolated in this fashion may be used to produce binding proteins against IL-21R or to identify cells expressing such binding proteins. Hybridization methods for identifying and isolating nucleic acids include polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Southern hybridizations, in situ hybridization and Northern hybridization, and are well known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\nHybridization reactions can be performed under conditions of different stringencies. The stringency of a hybridization reaction includes the difficulty with which any two nucleic acid molecules will hybridize to one another and the conditions under which they will remain hybridized. Preferably, each hybridizing polynucleotide hybridizes to its corresponding polynucleotide under reduced stringency conditions, more preferably stringent conditions, and most preferably highly stringent conditions. Stringent conditions are known to those skilled in the art and can be found in, e.g., \nCurrent Protocols in Molecular Biology\n, John Wiley & Sons, N.Y. (1989) 6.3.1-6.3.6. Both aqueous and nonaqueous methods are described in this reference, and either can be used. One example of stringent hybridization conditions is hybridization in 6× sodium chloride/sodium citrate (SSC) at about 45° C., followed by at least one wash in 0.2×SSC/0.1% SDS at 50° C. Stringent hybridization conditions are also accomplished with wash(es) in, e.g., 0.2×SSC/0.1% SDS at 55° C., 60° C., or 65° C. Highly stringent conditions include, e.g., hybridization in 0.5 M sodium phosphate/7% SDS at 65° C., followed by at least one wash at 0.2×SSC/1% SDS at 65° C. Further examples of stringency conditions are shown in Table 1 below: highly stringent conditions are those that are at least as stringent as, for example, conditions A-F; stringent conditions are at least as stringent as, for example, conditions G-L; and reduced stringency conditions are at least as stringent as, for example, conditions M-R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHybridization Conditions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nHybrid\n\n\nHybridization\n\n\nWash\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nLength\n\n\nTemperature\n\n\nTemperature\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCondition\n\n\nHybrid\n\n\n(bp)\n1\n \n\n\nand Buffer\n2\n \n\n\nand Buffer\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n\nDNA:DNA\n\n\n>50\n\n\n65° C.; 1X SSC -or-\n\n\n65° C.;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n42° C.; 1X SSC,\n\n\n0.3X SSC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n50% formamide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB\n\n\nDNA:DNA\n\n\n<50\n\n\nT\nB\n*; 1X SSC\n\n\nT\nB\n*; 1X SSC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\nDNA:RNA\n\n\n>50\n\n\n67° C.; 1X SSC -or-\n\n\n67° C.;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n45° C.; 1X SSC,\n\n\n0.3X SSC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n50% formamide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD\n\n\nDNA:RNA\n\n\n<50\n\n\nT\nD\n*; 1X SSC\n\n\nT\nD\n*; 1X SSC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE\n\n\nRNA:RNA\n\n\n>50\n\n\n70° C.; 1X SSC -or-\n\n\n70° C.;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n50° C.; 1X SSC,\n\n\n0.3X SSC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n50% formamide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nF\n\n\nRNA:RNA\n\n\n<50\n\n\nT\nF\n*; 1X SSC\n\n\nT\nF\n*; 1X SSC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG\n\n\nDNA:DNA\n\n\n>50\n\n\n65° C.; 4X SSC -or-\n\n\n65° C.;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n42° C.; 4X SSC,\n\n\n1X SSC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n50% formamide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH\n\n\nDNA:DNA\n\n\n<50\n\n\nT\nH\n*; 4X SSC\n\n\nT\nH\n*; 4X SSC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\nDNA:RNA\n\n\n>50\n\n\n67° C.; 4X SSC -or-\n\n\n67° C.;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n45° C.; 4X SSC,\n\n\n1X SSC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n50% formamide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJ\n\n\nDNA:RNA\n\n\n<50\n\n\nT\nJ\n*; 4X SSC\n\n\nT\nJ\n*; 4X SSC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nK\n\n\nRNA:RNA\n\n\n>50\n\n\n70° C.; 4X SSC -or-\n\n\n67° C.;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n50° C.; 4X SSC,\n\n\n1X SSC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n50% formamide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL\n\n\nRNA:RNA\n\n\n<50\n\n\nT\nL\n*; 2X SSC\n\n\nT\nL\n*; 2X SSC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM\n\n\nDNA:DNA\n\n\n>50\n\n\n50° C.; 4X SSC -or-\n\n\n50° C.;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n40° C.; 6X SSC,\n\n\n2X SSC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n50% formamide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN\n\n\nDNA:DNA\n\n\n<50\n\n\nT\nN\n*; 6X SSC\n\n\nT\nN\n*; 6X SSC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO\n\n\nDNA:RNA\n\n\n>50\n\n\n55° C.; 4X SSC -or-\n\n\n55° C.;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n42° C.; 6X SSC,\n\n\n2X SSC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n50% formamide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP\n\n\nDNA:RNA\n\n\n<50\n\n\nT\nP\n*; 6X SSC\n\n\nT\nP\n*; 6X SSC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ\n\n\nRNA:RNA\n\n\n>50\n\n\n60° C.; 4X SSC -or-\n\n\n60° C.;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n45° C.; 6X SSC,\n\n\n2X SSC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n50% formamide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\nRNA:RNA\n\n\n<50\n\n\nT\nR\n*; 4X SSC\n\n\nT\nR\n*;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4X SSC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n1\nThe hybrid length is that anticipated for the hybridized region(s) of the hybridizing polynucleotides. When hybridizing a polynucleotide to a target polynucleotide of unknown sequence, the hybrid length is assumed to be that of the hybridizing polynucleotide. When polynucleotides of known sequence are hybridized, the hybrid length can be determined by aligning the sequences of the polynucleotides and identifying the region or regions of optimal sequence complementarity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n2\nSSPE (1xSSPE is 0.15M NaCl, 10 mM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, and 1.25 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) can be substituted for SSC (1xSSC is 0.15M NaCl and 15 mM sodium citrate) in the hybridization and wash buffers; washes are performed for 15 min after hybridization is complete.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT\nB\n*-T\nR\n*: The hybridization temperature for hybrids anticipated to be less than 50 base pairs in length should be 5-10° C. less than the melting temperature (T\nm\n) of the hybrid, where T\nm \nis determined according to the following equations. For hybrids less than 18 base pairs in length, T\nm\n(° C.) = 2(# of A + T bases) + 4(# of G + C bases). For hybrids between 18 and 49 base pairs in length, T\nm \n(° C.) = 81.5 + 16.6(log\n10\nNa\n+\n) + 0.41(% G + C) − (600/N), where N is the number of bases in the hybrid, and Na\n+ \nis the concentration of sodium ions in the hybridization buffer (Na\n+ \nfor 1X SSC = 0.165 M).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional examples of stringency conditions for polynucleotide hybridization are provided in Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Chs. 9 & 11, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY (1989), and Ausubel et al. eds., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Sects. 2.10 & 6.3-6.4, John Wiley & Sons, Inc. (1995), herein incorporated by reference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe isolated polynucleotides of the present invention may be used as hybridization probes and primers to identify and isolate DNAs having sequences encoding allelic variants of the disclosed polynucleotides. Allelic variants are naturally occurring alternative forms of the disclosed polynucleotides that encode polypeptides that are identical to or have significant similarity to the polypeptides encoded by the disclosed polynucleotides. Preferably, allelic variants have at least about 90% sequence identity (more preferably, at least about 95% identity; most preferably, at least about 99% identity) with the disclosed polynucleotides. The isolated polynucleotides of the present invention may also be used as hybridization probes and primers to identify and isolate DNAs having sequences encoding polypeptides homologous to the disclosed polynucleotides. These homologs are polynucleotides and polypeptides isolated from a different species than that of the disclosed polypeptides and polynucleotides, or within the same species, but with significant sequence similarity to the disclosed polynucleotides and polypeptides. Preferably, polynucleotide homologs have at least about 50% sequence identity (more preferably, at least about 75% identity; most preferably, at least about 90% identity) with the disclosed polynucleotides, whereas polypeptide homologs have at least about 30% sequence identity (more preferably, at least about 45% identity; most preferably, at least about 60% identity) with the disclosed binding proteins/polypeptides. Preferably, homologs of the disclosed polynucleotides and polypeptides are those isolated from mammalian species. The isolated polynucleotides of the present invention may additionally be used as hybridization probes and primers to identify cells and tissues that express the binding proteins of the present invention and the conditions under which they are expressed.\n\n\nThe phrases “substantially as set out,” “substantially identical,” and “substantially homologous” mean that the relevant amino acid or nucleotide sequence (e.g., CDR(s), V\nH\n, or V\nL \ndomain(s)) will be identical to or have insubstantial differences (e.g., through conserved amino acid substitutions) in comparison to the sequences which are set out. Insubstantial differences include minor amino acid changes, such as one or two substitutions in a five amino acid sequence of a specified region. In the case of antibodies, the second antibody has the same specificity and has at least about 50% of the affinity of the first antibody.\n\n\nSequences substantially identical or homologous to the sequences disclosed herein are also part of this application. In some embodiments, the sequence identity can be about 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or higher. Alternatively, substantial identity or homology exists when the nucleic acid segments will hybridize under selective hybridization conditions (e.g., highly stringent hybridization conditions), to the complement of the strand. The nucleic acids may be present in whole cells, in a cell lysate, or in a partially purified or substantially pure form.\n\n\nThe term “therapeutic agent” or the like is a substance that treats or assists in treating a medical disorder or symptoms thereof. Therapeutic agents may include, but are not limited to, substances that modulate immune cells or immune responses in a manner that complements the use of anti-IL-21R binding proteins. In one embodiment of the invention, a therapeutic agent is a therapeutic antibody, e.g., an anti-IL-21R antibody. In another embodiment of the invention, a therapeutic agent is a therapeutic binding protein, e.g., an anti-IL-21R nanobody. Nonlimiting examples and uses of therapeutic agents are described herein.\n\n\nAs used herein, a “therapeutically effective amount” of an anti-IL-21R binding protein (e.g., an antibody) refers to an amount of the binding protein that is effective, upon single or multiple dose administration to a subject (such as a human patient) for treating, preventing, curing, delaying, reducing the severity of, and/or ameliorating at least one symptom of a disorder or a recurring disorder, or prolonging the survival of the subject beyond that expected in the absence of such treatment.\n\n\nAnti-IL-21R Binding Proteins\n\n\nThe disclosure of the present application provides novel anti-IL-21R binding proteins that comprise novel antigen-binding fragments. Numerous methods known to those skilled in the art are available for obtaining binding proteins or antigen-binding fragments thereof. For example, anti-IL-21R binding proteins that comprise antibodies can be produced using recombinant DNA methods (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567). Monoclonal antibodies may also be produced by generation of hybridomas in accordance with known methods (see, e.g., Kohler and Milstein (1975) \nNature \n256:495-99). Hybridomas formed in this manner are then screened using standard methods, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and surface plasmon resonance (BIACORE™) analysis, to identify one or more hybridomas that produce an antibody that specifically binds with a particular antigen. Any form of the specified antigen may be used as the immunogen, e.g., recombinant antigen, naturally occurring forms, any variants or fragments thereof, and antigenic peptides thereof.\n\n\nOne exemplary method of making binding proteins that comprise antibodies includes screening protein expression libraries, e.g., phage or ribosome display libraries. Phage display is described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,223,409; Smith (1985) \nScience \n228:1315-17; Clackson et al. (1991) \nNature \n352:624-28; Marks et al. (1991) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n222:581-97; and International Application Publication Nos. WO 92/018619; WO 91/017271; WO 92/020791; WO 92/015679; WO 93/001288; WO 92/001047; WO 92/009690; and WO 90/002809.\n\n\nIn addition to the use of display libraries, the specified antigen can be used to immunize a nonhuman animal, e.g., a cynomolgus monkey, a chicken, or a rodent (e.g., a mouse, hamster, or rat). In one embodiment, the nonhuman animal includes at least a part of a human immunoglobulin gene. For example, it is possible to engineer mouse strains deficient in mouse antibody production with large fragments of the human Ig loci. Using the hybridoma technology, antigen-specific monoclonal binding proteins, such as antibodies, derived from the genes with the desired specificity may be produced and selected (see, e.g., XENOMOUSE™ (Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, Calif.); Green et al. (1994) \nNat. Genet. \n7:13-21; U.S. Pat. No. 7,064,244; and International Application Publication Nos. WO 96/034096 and WO 96/033735).\n\n\nIn one embodiment of the invention, the binding proteins is a monoclonal antibody that is obtained from a nonhuman animal, and then modified (e.g., humanized, deimmunized, or chimeric) using recombinant DNA techniques known in the art. A variety of approaches for making chimeric antibodies have been described (see, e.g., Morrison et al. (1985) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n81(21):6851-55; Takeda et al. (1985) \nNature \n314(6010):452-54; U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,816,567 and 4,816,397; European Application Publication Nos. \nEP\n 0 171 496 and \nEP\n 0 173 494; and United Kingdom Patent No. \nGB\n 2 177 096). Humanized binding proteins may also be produced, for example, using transgenic mice that express human heavy and light chain genes, but are incapable of expressing the endogenous mouse immunoglobulin heavy and light chain genes. Winter (U.S. Pat. No. 5,225,539) describes an exemplary CDR-grafting method that may be used to prepare the humanized binding proteins described herein. All of the CDRs of a particular human binding protein may be replaced with at least a portion of a nonhuman CDR, or only some of the CDRs may be replaced with nonhuman CDRs. It is only necessary to replace the number of CDRs required for binding of the humanized binding protein to a predetermined antigen.\n\n\nHumanized binding proteins or fragments thereof can be generated by replacing sequences of the Fv variable domain that are not directly involved in antigen binding with equivalent sequences from human Fv variable domains. Exemplary methods for generating humanized binding proteins or fragments thereof are provided by, e.g., Morrison (1985) \nScience \n229:1202-07; Oi et al. (1986) \nBioTechniques \n4:214; and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,585,089; 5,693,761; 5,693,762; 5,859,205; and 6,407,213. Those methods include isolating, manipulating, and expressing the nucleic acid sequences that encode all or part of immunoglobulin Fv variable domains from at least one of a heavy or light chain. Such nucleic acids may be obtained from a hybridoma producing an antibody against a predetermined target, as described above, as well as from other sources. The recombinant DNA encoding the humanized antibody molecule can then be cloned into an appropriate expression vector.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, a humanized binding protein is improved by the introduction of conservative substitutions, consensus sequence substitutions, germline substitutions and/or backmutations. Such altered immunoglobulin molecules can be made by any of several techniques known in the art, (see, e.g., Teng et al. (1983) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n80:7308-73; Kozbor et al. (1983) \nImmunol. Today \n4:7279; Olsson et al. (1982) \nMeth. Enzymol. \n92:3-16); International Application Publication No. WO 92/006193; and European Patent No. \nEP\n 0 239 400).\n\n\nA binding protein or fragment thereof may also be modified by specific deletion of human T cell epitopes or “deimmunization” by the methods disclosed in, e.g., International Application Publication Nos. WO 98/052976 and WO 00/034317. Briefly, the heavy and light chain variable domains of a binding protein (such as, for example, a binding protein derived from an antibody) can be analyzed for peptides that bind to MHC Class II; these peptides represent potential T cell epitopes (as defined in, e.g., International Application Publication Nos. WO 98/052976 and WO 00/034317). For detection of potential T cell epitopes, a computer modeling approach termed “peptide threading” can be applied, and in addition a database of human MHC class II binding peptides can be searched for motifs present in the V\nH \nand V\nL \nsequences, as described in International Application Publication Nos. WO 98/052976 and WO 00/034317. These motifs bind to any of the 18 major MHC Class II DR allotypes and thus, constitute potential T cell epitopes. Potential T cell epitopes detected can be eliminated by substituting small numbers of amino acid residues in the variable domains or by single amino acid substitutions. Typically, conservative substitutions are made. Often, but not exclusively, an amino acid common to a position in human germline antibody sequences may be used. Human germline sequences are disclosed in, e.g., Tomlinson et al. (1992) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n227:776-98; Cook et al. (1995) \nImmunol. Today \n16(5):237-42; Chothia et al. (1992) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n227:799-817; and Tomlinson et al. (1995) \nEMBO J. \n14:4628-38. The V BASE directory provides a comprehensive directory of human immunoglobulin variable region sequences (compiled by Tomlinson et al., MRC Centre for Protein Engineering, Cambridge, UK). These sequences can be used as a source of human sequence, e.g., for framework regions and CDRs. Consensus human framework regions can also be used, as described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,300,064.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, a binding protein can contain an altered immunoglobulin constant or Fc region. For example, binding proteins produced in accordance with the teachings herein may bind more strongly or with more specificity to effector molecules such as complement and/or Fc receptors, which can control several immune functions of the binding protein such as effector cell activity, lysis, complement-mediated activity, binding protein clearance, and binding protein half-life. Typical Fc receptors that bind to an Fc region of a binding protein (e.g., an IgG antibody) include, but are not limited to, receptors of the FcγRI, FcγRII, and FcRn subclasses, including allelic variants and alternatively spliced forms of these receptors. Fc receptors are reviewed in, e.g., Ravetch and Kinet (1991) \nAnnu. Rev. Immunol. \n9:457-92; Capel et al. (1994) \nImmunomethods \n4:25-34; and de Haas et al. (1995) \nJ. Lab. Clin. Med. \n126:330-41. For additional binding protein/antibody production techniques, see, e.g., Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual (1988) Harlow et al. eds., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. The present invention is not necessarily limited to any particular source, method of production, or other special characteristic of a binding protein or an antibody.\n\n\nBinding proteins comprising antibodies (immunoglobulins) are typically tetrameric glycosylated proteins composed of two light (L) chains of approximately 25 kDa each and two heavy (H) chains of approximately 50 kDa each. Two types of light chains, termed lambda (λ) and kappa (κ), may be found in antibodies. Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of heavy chains, immunoglobulins can be assigned to five major classes: A, D, E, G, and M, and several of these may be further divided into subclasses (isotypes), e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1, and IgA2. Each light chain includes an N-terminal variable (V) domain (V\nL\n) and a constant (C) domain (C\nL\n). Each heavy chain includes an N-terminal V domain (V\nH\n), three or four C domains (C\nH\n \n \nS\n \n), and a hinge region. The C\nH \ndomain most proximal to V\nH \nis designated as \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1. The V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains consist of four regions of relatively conserved sequences called framework regions (FR1, FR2, FR3, and FR4) that form a scaffold for three regions of hypervariable sequences, called CDRs. The CDRs contain most of the residues responsible for specific interactions of the antibody with the antigen. CDRs are referred to as CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3. CDR constituents on the heavy chain are referred to as H1, H2, and H3 (also referred to herein as CDR H1, CDR H2, and CDR H3, respectively), while CDR constituents on the light chain are referred to as L1, L2, and L3 (also referred to herein as CDR L1, CDR L2, and CDR L3, respectively).\n\n\nCDR3 is typically the greatest source of molecular diversity within the antigen-binding site. CDR H3, for example, can be as short as two amino acid residues or greater than 26 amino acids. The subunit structures and three-dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known in the art. For a review of antibody structure, see, e.g., Harlow et al. (1988) supra. One of skill in the art will recognize that each subunit structure, e.g., a C\nH\n, V\nH\n, C\nL\n, V\nL\n, CDR, and/or FR structure, comprises active fragments, e.g., the portion of the V\nH\n, V\nL\n, or CDR subunit that binds to the antigen, i.e., the antigen-binding fragment, or, e.g., the portion of the C\nH \nsubunit that binds to and/or activates, e.g., an Fc receptor and/or complement. The CDRs typically refer to the Kabat CDRs (as described in Kabat et al. (1991) supra). Another standard for characterizing the antigen binding site is to refer to the hypervariable loops as described in, e.g., Chothia et al. (1992) supra and Tomlinson et al. (1995) supra. Still another standard is the “AbM” definition used by Oxford Molecular's AbM antibody modeling software (see, generally, e.g., \nProtein Sequence and Structure Analysis of Antibody Variable Domains \nin: \nAntibody Engineering \n(2001) Duebel and Kontermann eds., Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg). Embodiments described with respect to Kabat CDRs can alternatively be implemented using similar described relationships with respect to Chothia hypervariable loops or to the AbM-defined loops.\n\n\nThe Fab fragment consists of V\nH\n-\nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 and V\nL\n-C\nL \ndomains covalently linked by a disulfide bond between the constant regions. The F\nv \nfragment is smaller and consists of V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains noncovalently linked. To overcome the tendency of noncovalently linked domains to dissociate, an scFv can be constructed. The scFv contains a flexible polypeptide that links (1) the C-terminus of V\nH \nto the N-terminus of V\nL\n, or (2) the C-terminus of V\nL \nto the N-terminus of V\nH\n. A 15-mer (Gly\n4\nSer)\n3 \npeptide, for example, may be used as a linker, but other linkers are known in the art.\n\n\nThe sequence of antibody genes after assembly and somatic mutation is highly varied, and these varied genes are estimated to encode 10\n10 \ndifferent antibody molecules (\nImmunoglobulin Genes \n(2nd ed. 1995) Jonio et al. eds., Academic Press, San Diego, Calif.).\n\n\nIn certain embodiments of the invention, the binding protein is a single domain binding protein. Single domain binding proteins include binding proteins wherein the CDRs are part of a single domain polypeptide. Examples include, but are not limited to, heavy chain binding proteins, binding proteins that are naturally devoid of light chains, single domain binding proteins derived from conventional four-chain antibodies, engineered binding proteins, and single domain protein scaffolds other than those derived from antibodies. Single domain binding proteins include any known in the art, as well as any future-determined or -learned single domain binding proteins.\n\n\nSingle domain binding proteins may be derived from any species including, but not limited to, mouse, human, camel, llama, fish, shark, goat, rabbit, chicken, and bovine. In one aspect of the invention, the single domain binding protein can be derived from a variable region of the immunoglobulin found in fish, such as, for example, that which is derived from the immunoglobulin isotype known as Novel Antigen Receptor (NAR) found in the serum of shark. Methods of producing single domain binding proteins derived from a variable region of NAR (IgNARs) are described in, e.g., International Application Publication No. WO 03/014161 and Streltsov (2005) \nProtein Sci. \n14:2901-09. Single domain binding proteins also include naturally occurring single domain binding proteins known in the art as heavy chain antibodies devoid of light chains. This variable domain derived from a heavy chain antibody naturally devoid of a light chain is known herein as a VHH, or a nanobody, to distinguish it from the conventional V\nH \nof four-chain immunoglobulins. Such a VHH molecule can be derived from antibodies raised in Camelidae species, for example, in camel, llama, dromedary, alpaca, and guanaco, and is sometimes called a camelid or camelized variable domain (see, e.g., Muyldermans (2001) \nJ. Biotechnol. \n74(4):277-302, incorporated herein by reference). Other species besides those in the family Camelidae may also produce heavy chain binding proteins naturally devoid of light chains. VHH molecules are about ten times smaller than IgG molecules. They are single polypeptides and are very stable, resisting extreme pH and temperature conditions. Moreover, they are resistant to the actions of proteases, which is not the case for conventional antibodies. Furthermore, in vitro expression of VHHs can produce high-yield, properly folded functional VHHs. In addition, binding proteins generated in camelids will recognize epitopes other than those recognized by antibodies generated in vitro via antibody libraries or via immunization of mammals other than camelids (see, e.g., International Application Publication Nos. WO 97/049805 and WO 94/004678, which are incorporated herein by reference).\n\n\nA “bispecific” or “bifunctional” binding protein is an artificial hybrid binding protein having two different heavy/light chain pairs and two different binding sites. Bispecific binding proteins can be produced by a variety of methods including fusion of hybridomas or linking of Fab′ fragments (see, e.g., Songsivilai and Lachmann (1990) \nClin. Exp. Immunol. \n79:315-21; Kostelny et al. (1992) \nJ. Immunol. \n148:1547-53). In one embodiment, the bispecific binding protein comprises a first binding domain polypeptide, such as a Fab′ fragment, linked via an immunoglobulin constant region to a second binding domain polypeptide.\n\n\nAnother binding protein according to the invention can comprise, for example, a binding domain-immunoglobulin fusion protein that includes a binding domain polypeptide that is fused or otherwise connected to an immunoglobulin hinge or hinge-acting region polypeptide, which in turn is fused or otherwise connected to a region comprising one or more native or engineered constant regions from an immunoglobulin heavy chain, other than \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1, for example, the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n2 and C\nH\n3 regions of IgG and IgA1 or the C\nH\n3 and \nC\n \n \n \nH\n4 regions of IgE (see, e.g., U.S. Application Publication No. 2005/0136049, which is incorporated by reference herein, for a more complete description). The binding domain-immunoglobulin fusion protein can further include a region that includes a native or engineered immunoglobulin \nheavy chain C\n \n \n \nH\n2 constant region polypeptide (or C\nH\n3 in the case of a construct derived in whole or in part from IgE) that is fused or otherwise connected to the hinge region polypeptide and a native or engineered immunoglobulin heavy chain C\nH\n3 constant region polypeptide (or \nC\n \n \n \nH\n4 in the case of a construct derived in whole or in part from IgE) that is fused or otherwise connected to the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n2 constant region polypeptide (or C\nH\n3 in the case of a construct derived in whole or in part from IgE). Typically, such binding domain-immunoglobulin fusion proteins are capable of at least one immunological activity selected from the group consisting of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement fixation, and/or binding to a target, for example, a target antigen, such as human IL-21R.\n\n\nBinding proteins of the invention can also comprise peptide mimetics. Peptide mimetics are peptide-containing molecules that mimic elements of protein secondary structure (see, for example, Johnson et al., \nPeptide Turn Mimetics \nin \nBiotechnology and Pharmacy \n(1993) Pezzuto et al. eds., Chapman and Hall, New York, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety). The underlying rationale behind the use of peptide mimetics is that the peptide backbone of proteins exists chiefly to orient amino acid side chains in such a way as to facilitate molecular interactions, such as those between antibody and antigen. A peptide mimetic is expected to permit molecular interactions similar to the natural molecule. These principles may be used to engineer second generation molecules having many of the natural properties of the targeting peptides disclosed herein, but with altered and potentially improved characteristics.\n\n\nOther embodiments of binding proteins useful for practicing the invention include fusion proteins. These molecules generally have all or a substantial portion of a targeting peptide, for example, IL-21R or an anti IL-21R antibody, linked at the N- or C-terminus, to all or a portion of a second polypeptide or protein. For example, fusion proteins may employ leader (or signal) sequences from other species to permit the recombinant expression of a protein in a heterologous host. For example, amino acid sequences, or nucleic acid sequences encoding amino acid sequences, of the binding proteins and antigen-binding fragments thereof of the present invention comprising a leader (or signal) sequence may be selected from SEQ ID NOs:87-109 and 239-248. Another useful fusion includes the addition of an immunologically active domain, such as a binding protein epitope, to facilitate purification of the fusion protein. Inclusion of a cleavage site at or near the fusion junction will facilitate removal of the extraneous polypeptide after purification. Other useful fusions include the linking of functional domains, such as active sites from enzymes, glycosylation domains, cellular targeting signals, or transmembrane regions. Examples of proteins or peptides that may be incorporated into a fusion protein include, but are not limited to, cytostatic proteins, cytocidal proteins, pro-apoptosis agents, anti-angiogenic agents, hormones, cytokines, growth factors, peptide drugs, antibodies, Fab fragments of antibodies, antigens, receptor proteins, enzymes, lectins, MHC proteins, cell adhesion proteins, and binding proteins. Methods of generating fusion proteins are well known to those of skill in the art. Such proteins can be produced, for example, by chemical attachment using bifunctional cross-linking reagents, by de novo synthesis of the complete fusion protein, or by attachment of a DNA sequence encoding the targeting peptide to a DNA sequence encoding the second peptide or protein, followed by expression of the intact fusion protein.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the targeting peptide, for example, IL-21R, is fused with an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region, such as an Fc fragment, which contains two constant region domains and a hinge region, but lacks the variable region (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,018,026 and 5,750,375, incorporated by reference herein). The Fc region may be a naturally occurring Fc region, or may be altered to improve certain qualities, e.g., therapeutic qualities, circulation time, reduced aggregation. Peptides and proteins fused to an Fc region typically exhibit a greater half-life in vivo than the unfused counterpart does. In addition, a fusion to an Fc region permits dimerization/multimerization of the fusion polypeptide.\n\n\nOne aspect of the present invention comprises binding proteins and antigen-binding fragments thereof that bind IL-21R. The disclosure provides novel CDRs that have been derived from human immunoglobulin gene libraries. The protein structure that is generally used to carry a CDR is an antibody heavy or light chain or a portion thereof, wherein the CDR is localized to a region associated with a naturally occurring CDR. The structures and locations of variable domains may be determined as described in Kabat et al. ((1991) supra).\n\n\nIllustrative embodiments of the binding proteins (and antigen-binding fragments thereof) of the invention are identified as AbA-AbZ, H3-H6, L1-L6, L8-L21, and L23-L25.

For example, a V\nL \ndomain may be attached at its C-terminal end to a light chain constant domain like Cκ or Cλ. Similarly, a V\nH \ndomain, or portion thereof, may be attached to all or part of a heavy chain like IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and any isotype subclass. Constant regions are known in the art (see, e.g., Kabat et al. (1991) supra). Therefore, binding proteins within the scope of this invention include V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains, or portions thereof, combined with constant regions known in the art.\n\n\nCertain embodiments comprise a V\nH \ndomain, a V\nL \ndomain, or a combination thereof, of the Fv fragment from AbA-AbZ, H3-H6, L1-L6, L8-L21, and/or L23-L25. Further embodiments comprise one, two, three, four, five or six CDRs from the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains. Binding proteins whose CDR sequence(s) are the same as, or similar to (i.e., differ insubstantially from), one or more CDR sequence(s) present within the sequences set forth in SEQ ID NOs:5-195, 213-229, and 239-248 are encompassed within the scope of the invention.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the V\nH \nand/or V\nL \ndomains may be germlined, i.e., the FR of these domains are mutated using conventional molecular biology techniques to match those produced by the germline cells. In other embodiments, the FR sequences remain diverged from the consensus germline sequences.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, mutagenesis is used to make a binding protein more similar to one or more germline sequences. This may be desirable when mutations are introduced into the FR of a binding protein (e.g., an antibody) through somatic mutagenesis or through error prone PCR. Germline sequences for the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains can be identified by performing amino acid and nucleic acid sequence alignments against the VBASE database (MRC Center for Protein Engineering, UK). VBASE is a comprehensive directory of all human germline variable region sequences compiled from over a thousand published sequences, including those in the current releases of the GENBANK® and EMBL data libraries. In some embodiments, the FRs of scFvs are mutated in conformity with the closest matches in the VBASE database and the CDR portions are kept intact.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, binding proteins of the invention specifically react with an epitope that is the same as the epitope recognized by AbA-AbZ, H3-H6, L1-L6, L8-L21, or L23-L25, such that they competitively inhibit the binding of AbA-AbZ, H3-H6, L1-L6, L8-L21, or L23-L25 to human IL-21R. Such binding proteins can be determined in competitive binding assays. In one embodiment, the association constant (K\nA\n) of these binding proteins for human IL-21R is at least 10\n5 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1\n. The binding affinity may be determined using techniques known in the art, such as ELISA, biosensor technology (such as biospecific interaction analysis) or other techniques, including those described in this application.\n\n\nIt is contemplated that binding proteins of the invention may bind other proteins, such as, for example, recombinant proteins comprising all or a portion of IL-21R.\n\n\nOne of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the disclosed binding proteins may be used to detect, measure, and/or inhibit proteins that differ somewhat from IL-21R. For example, these proteins may be homologs of IL-21R. Anti-IL-21R binding proteins are expected to bind proteins that comprise a sequence which is at least about 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, or more identical to any sequence of at least 100, 80, 60, 40, or 20 contiguous amino acids in the sequence set forth SEQ ID NOs:2 or 4.\n\n\nIn addition to sequence homology analyses, epitope mapping (see, e.g., \nEpitope Mapping Protocols \n(1996) Morris ed., Humana Press), and secondary and tertiary structure analyses can be carried out to identify specific 3D structures assumed by the presently disclosed binding proteins and their complexes with antigens. Such methods include, but are not limited to, x-ray crystallography (Engstom (1974) \nBiochem. Exp. Biol. \n11:7-13) and computer modeling of virtual representations of the present binding proteins (Fletterick et al. (1986) \nComputer Graphics and Molecular Modeling, in Current Communications in Molecular Biology\n, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.).\n\n\nThe disclosure provides a method for obtaining anti-IL-21R binding proteins. The method comprises creating binding proteins with V\nH \nand/or V\nL \nsequence(s) that are altered from those sequences disclosed herein. Such binding proteins may be derived by a skilled artisan using techniques known in the art. For example, amino acid substitutions, deletions, or additions can be introduced in FR and/or CDR regions. FR changes are usually designed to improve the stability and immunogenicity of the binding protein, while CDR changes are typically designed to increase a binding protein's affinity for its antigen. The changes that increase affinity may be tested by altering one or more CDR sequences and measuring the affinity of the binding protein for its target (see, e.g., \nAntibody Engineering \n(2nd ed. 1995) Borrebaeck ed., Oxford University Press).\n\n\nBinding proteins whose CDR sequences differ insubstantially from those set forth in or included within the sequences of SEQ ID NOs:5-195, 213-229, and 239-248 are encompassed within the scope of this invention. Typically, such an insubstantial difference(s) involves substitution of an amino acid with an amino acid having similar charge, hydrophobicity, or stereochemical characteristics. More drastic substitutions in FR regions, in contrast to CDR regions, may also be made as long as they do not adversely affect (e.g., reduce affinity by more than 50% as compared to the unsubstituted binding protein) the binding properties of the binding protein. Substitutions may also be made to germline the binding protein or stabilize its antigen binding site.\n\n\nConservative modifications will produce molecules having functional and chemical characteristics similar to those of the molecule from which such modifications are made. In contrast, substantial modifications in the functional and/or chemical characteristics of the molecules may be accomplished by selecting substitutions in the amino acid sequence that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining (1) the structure of the molecular backbone in the area of the substitution, for example, as a sheet or helical conformation, (2) the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site, and/or (3) the size of the molecule.\n\n\nFor example, a “conservative amino acid substitution” may involve a substitution of a native amino acid residue with a normative residue such that there is little or no effect on the polarity or charge of the amino acid residue at that position (see, e.g., MacLennan et al. (1998) \nActa Physiol. Scand. Suppl. \n643:55-67; Sasaki et al. (1998) \nAdv. Biophys. \n35:1-24).\n\n\nDesired amino acid substitutions (whether conservative or nonconservative) can be determined by those skilled in the art at the time such substitutions are desired. For example, amino acid substitutions can be used to identify important residues of the molecule sequence, or to increase or decrease the affinity of the molecules described herein. Exemplary amino acid substitutions include, but are not limited to, those set forth in Table 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExemplary Amino Acid Substitutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOriginal \n\n\nExemplary\n\n\nMore Conservative\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nResidues\n\n\nSubstitutions\n\n\nSubstitutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAla (A)\n\n\nVal, Leu, Ile\n\n\nVal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nArg (R)\n\n\nLys, Gln, Asn\n\n\nLys\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAsn (N)\n\n\nGln\n\n\nGln\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAsp (D)\n\n\nGlu\n\n\nGlu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCys (C)\n\n\nSer, Ala\n\n\nSer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGln (Q)\n\n\nAsn\n\n\nAsn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGly (G)\n\n\nPro, Ala\n\n\nAla\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHis (H)\n\n\nAsn, Gln, Lys, Arg\n\n\nArg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIle (I)\n\n\nLeu, Val, Met, Ala, Phe,\n\n\nLeu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNorleucine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLeu (L)\n\n\nNorleucine, Ile, Val,\n\n\nIle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMet, Ala, Phe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLys (K)\n\n\nArg,\n\n\n \nArg\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,4-diamino-butyric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nacid, Gln, Asn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMet (M)\n\n\nLeu, Phe, Ile\n\n\nLeu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPhe (F)\n\n\nLeu, Val, Ile, Ala, Tyr\n\n\nLeu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPro (P)\n\n\nAla, Gly\n\n\nGly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSer (S)\n\n\nThr, Ala, Cys\n\n\nThr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThr (T)\n\n\nSer\n\n\nSer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTrp (W)\n\n\nTyr, Phe\n\n\nTyr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTyr (Y)\n\n\nTrp, Phe, Thr, Ser\n\n\nPhe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nVal (V)\n\n\nIle, Met, Leu, Phe, Ala,\n\n\nLeu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNorleucine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, conservative amino acid substitutions also encompass nonnaturally occurring amino acid residues that are typically incorporated by chemical peptide synthesis rather than by synthesis in biological systems.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the method for making a variant V\nH \ndomain comprises adding, deleting, or substituting at least one amino acid in the disclosed V\nH \ndomains, or combining the disclosed V\nH \ndomains with at least one V\nL \ndomain, and testing the variant V\nH \ndomain for IL-21R binding or modulation of IL-21R/IL-21 activity.\n\n\nAn analogous method for making a variant V\nL \ndomain comprises adding, deleting, or substituting at least one amino acid in the disclosed V\nL \ndomains, or combining the disclosed V\nL \ndomains with at least one V\nH \ndomain, and testing the variant V\nL \ndomain for IL-21R binding or modulation of IL-21R activity.\n\n\nIn some alternative embodiments, the anti-IL-21R binding proteins can be linked to a protein (e.g., albumin) by chemical cross-linking or recombinant methods. The disclosed binding proteins may also be linked to a variety of nonproteinaceous polymers (e.g., polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, or polyoxyalkylenes) in manners set forth in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,640,835; 4,496,689; 4,301,144; 4,670,417; 4,791,192; and 4,179,337. The binding proteins can be chemically modified by covalent conjugation to a polymer, for example, to increase their half-life in blood circulation. Exemplary polymers and attachment methods are shown in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,766,106; 4,179,337; 4,495,285; and 4,609,546.\n\n\nThe disclosed binding proteins can be modified to alter their glycosylation; that is, at least one carbohydrate moiety can be deleted or added to the binding protein. Deletion or addition of glycosylation sites can be accomplished by changing amino acid sequence to delete or create glycosylation consensus sites, which are well known in the art. Another means of adding carbohydrate moieties is the chemical or enzymatic coupling of glycosides to amino acid residues of the binding protein, e.g., antibody (see, e.g., International Application Publication No. WO 87/05330 and Aplin et al. (1981) \nCRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. \n22:259-306). Removal of carbohydrate moieties can also be accomplished chemically or enzymatically (see, e.g., Hakimuddin et al. (1987) \nArch. Biochem. Biophys. \n259:52; Edge et al. (1981) \nAnal. Biochem. \n118:131; and Thotakura et al. (1987) \nMeth. Enzymol. \n138:350). Modification of carbohydrate structures may be preferable as amino acid changes in the Fc domain may enhance immunogenicity of a pharmaceutical composition (see, e.g., International Application Publication No. WO 2008/052030). For immunoglobulin molecules it has been demonstrated that attachment of N-linked carbohydrate to Asn-297 of the CH2 domain is critical for ADCC activity. Its removal enzymatically or through mutation of the N-linked consensus site results in little to no ADCC activity. In glycoproteins, carbohydrates may attach to the amide nitrogen atom in the side chain of an asparagine in a tripeptide motif Asn-X-Thr/Ser. This type of glycosylation, termed N-linked glycosylation, commences in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with the addition of multiple monosaccharides to a dolichol phosphate to form a 14-residue branched carbohydrate complex. This carbohydrate complex is then transferred to the protein by the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex. Before the glycoprotein leaves the lumen of the ER, three glucose molecules are removed from the 14-residue oligosaccharide. The enzymes ER glucosidase I, ER glucosidase II and ER mannosidase are involved in ER processing. Subsequently, the polypeptides are transported to the Golgi complex, where the N-linked sugar chains are modified in many different ways. In the cis and medial compartments of the Golgi complex, the original 14-saccharide N-linked complex may be trimmed through removal of mannose (Man) residues and elongated through addition of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNac) and/or fucose (Fuc) residues. The various forms of N-linked carbohydrates generally have in common a pentasaccharide core consisting of three mannose and two N-acetylglucosamine residues. Finally, in the trans Golgi, other GlcNac residues can be added, followed by galactose (Gal) and a terminal sialic acid (Sial). Carbohydrate processing in the Golgi complex is called “terminal glycosylation” to distinguish it from “core glycosylation,” which takes place in the ER. The final complex carbohydrate units can take on many forms and structures, some of which have two, three or four branches (termed biantennary, triantennary or tetraantennary). A number of enzymes are involved in Golgi processing, including Golgi mannosidases IA, IB and IC, GlcNAc-transferase I, Golgi mannosidase II, GlcNAc-transferase II, galactosyl transferase and sialyl transferase.\n\n\nMethods for altering the constant region of a binding protein (such as, for example, the constant region of an antibody) are known in the art. Binding proteins with altered function (e.g., altered affinity for an effector ligand such as FcR on a cell or the C1 component of complement) can be produced by replacing at least one amino acid residue in the constant portion with a different residue (see, e.g., European Application Publication No. \nEP\n 0 388 151 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,624,821 and 5,648,260). Similar types of alterations could be described that, if applied to a murine or other species of binding protein, would reduce or eliminate similar functions.\n\n\nFor example, it is possible to alter the affinity of an Fc region of a binding protein (e.g., an IgG, such as a human IgG) for FcR (e.g., Fc gamma R1) or C1q. The affinity may be altered by replacing at least one specified residue with at least one residue having an appropriate functionality on its side chain, or by introducing a charged functional group, such as glutamate or aspartate, or perhaps an aromatic nonpolar residue such as phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan or alanine (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,624,821).\n\n\nFor example, replacing residue 297 (asparagine) with alanine in the IgG constant region significantly inhibits recruitment of effector cells, while only slightly reducing (about three-fold weaker) affinity for C1q (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,624,821). The numbering of the residues in the heavy chain is that of the EU index (see Kabat et al. (1991) supra). This alteration destroys the glycosylation site, and it is believed that the presence of carbohydrate is required for Fc receptor binding. Any other substitution at this site that destroys the glycosylation site is believed to cause a similar decrease in lytic activity. Other amino acid substitutions, e.g., changing any one of residues 318 (Glu), 320 (Lys) and 322 (Lys), to Ala, are also known to abolish C1q binding to the Fc region of IgG antibodies (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,624,821).\n\n\nModified binding proteins can be produced which have a reduced interaction with an Fc receptor. For example, it has been shown that in human IgG\n3\n, which binds to the human Fc gamma R1 receptor, changing Leu 235 to Glu destroys its interaction with the receptor. Mutations on adjacent or close sites in the hinge link region of a binding protein (e.g., replacing residues 234, 235 and 237 with Ala) can also be used to affect binding protein affinity for the Fc gamma R1 receptor. The numbering of the residues in the heavy chain is based on the EU index (see Kabat et al. (1991) supra). Thus, in some embodiments of the invention, the Fc region of the binding proteins of the invention contains at least one constant region mutation, such as, for example, changing Leu to Ala at position 234 (L234A), changing Leu to Ala at position 235 (L235A), and/or changing Gly to Ala at position 237 (G237A). In one embodiment, the Fc region of the binding protein contains two constant region mutations, L234A and G237A (i.e., “double-mutant” or “DM”). In another embodiment, the Fc region of the binding protein contains three constant region mutations, L234A, L235A, and G237A (i.e., “triple-mutant” or “TM”). For example, a human IgG constant region triple-mutant is set forth in SEQ ID NO: 196.\n\n\nAdditional methods for altering the lytic activity of a binding protein, for example, by altering at least one amino acid in the N-terminal region of the CH2 domain, are described in International Application Publication No. WO 94/029351 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,624,821.\n\n\nThe binding proteins of the invention can be tagged with a detectable or functional label. These labels include radiolabels (e.g., \n131\nI and \n99\nTc), enzymatic labels (e.g., horseradish peroxidase and alkaline phosphatase), and other chemical moieties (e.g., biotin).\n\n\nThe invention may also feature an isolated binding protein or antigen-binding fragment thereof that binds to IL-21R, in particular, human IL-21R.

The nucleic acids may comprise DNA or RNA, and they may be synthetic (completely or partially) or recombinant (completely or partially). Reference to a nucleotide sequence as set out herein encompasses a DNA molecule with the specified sequence, and encompasses an RNA molecule with the specified sequence in which U is substituted for T.\n\n\nAlso contemplated are nucleic acids that comprise a coding sequence for one, two, or three CDRs, a V\nH \ndomain, a V\nL \ndomain, or combinations thereof, as disclosed herein, or a sequence substantially identical thereto (e.g., a sequence at least 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or higher identical thereto, or which is capable of hybridizing under stringent conditions to the sequences).\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the isolated nucleic acids have nucleotide sequences encoding heavy chain and light chain variable regions of an anti-IL-21R binding protein comprising at least one CDR chosen from the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NOs: 163-195, or a sequence encoding a CDR which differs by one or two or three or four amino acids from the sequences described herein.\n\n\nThe nucleic acid can encode only the light chain or the heavy chain variable region, or can encode a binding protein light or heavy chain constant region, operatively linked to the corresponding variable region. In one embodiment, the light chain variable region is linked to a constant region chosen from a kappa or a lambda constant region. The light chain constant region may also be a human kappa or lambda type. In another embodiment, the heavy chain variable region is linked to a heavy chain constant region of a binding protein isotype chosen from IgG (e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4), IgM, IgA1, IgA2, IgD, and IgE. The heavy chain constant region may be an IgG (e.g., an IgG1) isotype.\n\n\nThe nucleic acid compositions of the present invention, while often in the native sequence (of cDNA or genomic DNA or mixtures thereof), except for modified restriction sites and the like, can be mutated in accordance with standard techniques to provide gene sequences. For coding sequences, these mutations, may affect amino acid sequences as desired. In particular, nucleotide sequences substantially identical to or derived from native V, D, J, constant, switches and other such sequences described herein are contemplated (where “derived” indicates that a sequence is identical to or modified from another sequence).\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the nucleic acid differs (e.g., differs by substitution, insertion, or deletion) from that of the sequences provided (e.g., by at least one but less than 10, 20, 30, or 40 nucleotides; at least one but less than 1%, 5%, 10% or 20% of the nucleotides in the subject nucleic acid). If necessary for this analysis the sequences should be aligned for maximum homology. “Looped” out sequences from deletions or insertions, or mismatches, are considered differences. The difference may be at a nucleotide(s) encoding a nonessential residue(s), or the difference may be a conservative substitution(s).\n\n\nThe disclosure also provides nucleic acid constructs in the form of plasmids, vectors, and transcription or expression cassettes, which comprise at least one nucleic acid as described herein.\n\n\nThe disclosure further provides a host cell that comprises at least one nucleic acid construct described herein.\n\n\nAlso provided is a method of making an encoded protein(s) from a nucleic acid(s) comprising the sequence(s) described herein. The method comprises culturing host cells under appropriate conditions so they express the protein from the nucleic acid. Following expression and production, the V\nH \nor V\nL \ndomain, or specific binding member, may be isolated and/or purified using any suitable technique, and then used as appropriate. The method can also include the steps of fusing a nucleic acid encoding an scFv with nucleic acids encoding an Fc portion of a binding protein, and expressing the fused nucleic acid in a cell. The method can also include a step of germlining.\n\n\nAntigen-binding fragments, V\nH \nand/or V\nL \ndomains, and encoding nucleic acid molecules and vectors may be isolated and/or purified from their natural environment, in substantially pure or homogenous form, or, in the case of nucleic acids, free or substantially free of nucleic acids or genes of origin other than the sequence encoding a polypeptide with the require function.\n\n\nSystems for cloning and expressing polypeptides in a variety of host cells are known in the art. Cells suitable for producing binding proteins are described in, for example, Fernandez et al. (1999) \nGene Expression Systems\n, Academic Press. In brief, suitable host cells include mammalian cells, insect cells, plant cells, yeast cells, or prokaryotic cells, e.g., \nE. coli\n. Mammalian cells available in the art for heterologous polypeptide expression include lymphocytic cell lines (e.g., NSO), HEK293 cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, COS cells, HeLa cells, baby hamster kidney cells, oocyte cells, and cells from a transgenic animal, e.g., mammary epithelial cells. In other embodiments, the nucleic acids encoding the binding proteins of the invention are placed under the control of a tissue-specific promoter (e.g., a mammary-specific promoter) and the binding proteins are produced in transgenic animals. For example, the binding proteins are secreted into the milk of the transgenic animal, such as a transgenic cow, pig, horse, sheep, goat, or rodent.\n\n\nSuitable vectors may be chosen or constructed to contain appropriate regulatory sequences, including promoter sequences, terminator sequences, polyadenylation sequences, enhancer sequences, marker genes, and other sequences. The vectors may also contain a plasmid or viral backbone. For details, see, e.g., Sambrook et al., \nMolecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual \n(2nd ed. 1989) Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. Many established techniques used with vectors, including the manipulation, preparation, mutagenesis, sequencing, and transfection of DNA, are described, e.g., in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (2nd ed. 1992) Ausubel et al. eds., John Wiley & Sons.\n\n\nA further aspect of the disclosure provides a method of introducing the nucleic acid into a host cell. For eukaryotic cells, suitable transfection techniques may include calcium phosphate, DEAE-Dextran, electroporation, liposome-mediated transfection, and transduction using a retrovirus or other virus(es), e.g., vaccinia or baculovirus. For bacterial cells, suitable techniques may include calcium chloride transformation, electroporation, and transfection using bacteriophage. DNA introduction may be followed by a selection method (e.g., drug resistance) to select cells that contain the nucleic acid.\n\n\nUses of Anti-IL-21R Binding Proteins\n\n\nAnti-IL-21R binding proteins that act as antagonists to IL-21R can be used to regulate at least one IL-21R-mediated immune response, such as one or more of cell proliferation, cytokine expression or secretion, chemokine secretion, and cytolytic activity, of T cells, B cells, NK cells, macrophages, or synovial cells. Accordingly, the binding proteins of the invention can be used to inhibit the activity (e.g., proliferation, differentiation, and/or survival) of an immune or hematopoietic cell (e.g., a cell of myeloid, lymphoid, or erythroid lineage, or precursor cells thereof), and, thus, can be used to treat a variety of immune disorders and hyperproliferative disorders of the blood. Examples of immune disorders that can be treated include, but are not limited to, transplant rejection, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), allergies (for example, atopic allergy), and autoimmune diseases. Autoimmune diseases include diabetes mellitus, arthritic disorders (including rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis), spondyloarthropathy, multiple sclerosis, encephalomyelitis, myasthenia gravis, systemic lupus erythematosus, cutaneous lupus erythematosus, autoimmune thyroiditis, dermatitis (including atopic dermatitis and eczematous dermatitis), psoriasis, Sjögren's syndrome, IBD (including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), asthma (including intrinsic asthma and allergic asthma), scleroderma and vasculitis.\n\n\nCombination Therapy\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one anti-IL-21R binding protein and at least one therapeutic agent is administered in combination therapy. The therapy is useful for treating pathological conditions or disorders, such as immune and inflammatory disorders. The term “in combination” in this context means that the binding protein composition and the therapeutic agent are given substantially contemporaneously, either simultaneously or sequentially. If given sequentially, at the onset of administration of the second compound, the first of the two compounds may still be detectable at effective concentrations at the site of treatment.\n\n\nFor example, the combination therapy can include at least one anti-IL-21R binding protein, such as, for example, an anti-IL-21R antibody, coformulated with, and/or coadministered with, at least one additional therapeutic agent. The additional agents may include at least one cytokine inhibitor, growth factor inhibitor, immunosuppressant, anti-inflammatory agent, metabolic inhibitor, enzyme inhibitor, cytotoxic agent, and/or cytostatic agent. Such combination therapies may advantageously utilize lower dosages of the administered therapeutic agents, thus avoiding possible toxicities or complications associated with the various monotherapies. Moreover, the therapeutic agents disclosed herein act on pathways that differ from the IL-21/IL-21R pathway, and thus are expected to enhance and/or synergize with the effects of the anti-IL-21R binding proteins.\n\n\nAnother aspect of the present invention relates to kits for carrying out the combined administration of anti-IL-21R binding proteins with other therapeutic agents. In one embodiment, the kit comprises at least one anti-IL-21R binding protein formulated in a pharmaceutical carrier, and at least one therapeutic agent, formulated as appropriate in one or more separate pharmaceutical preparations.\n\n\nDiagnostic Uses\n\n\nThe binding proteins of the invention may also be used to detect the presence of IL-21R in biological samples. By correlating the presence or level of these proteins with a medical condition, one of skill in the art can diagnose the associated medical condition. For example, stimulated T cells increase their expression of IL-21R, and an unusually high concentration of IL-21R expressing T cells in joints may indicate joint inflammation and possible arthritis. Illustrative medical conditions that may be diagnosed by the binding proteins of this invention include, but are not limited to, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and transplant rejection.\n\n\nBinding protein-based detection methods, such as those commonly used for antibodies, are well known in the art, and include ELISA, radioimmunoassays, immunoblots, Western blots, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation, and other related techniques. The binding proteins may be provided in a diagnostic kit that incorporates at least one of these procedures to detect IL-21R. The kit may contain other components, packaging, instructions, reagents and/or other material to aid the detection of the protein and use of the kit.\n\n\nBinding proteins may be modified with detectable markers, including ligand groups (e.g., biotin), fluorophores, chromophores, radioisotopes, electron-dense reagents, or enzymes. Enzymes are detected by their activity. For example, horseradish peroxidase is detected by its ability to convert tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to a blue pigment, quantifiable with a spectrophotometer. Other suitable binding partners include biotin and avidin, IgG and protein A, and other receptor-ligand pairs known in the art.\n\n\nBinding proteins can also be functionally linked (e.g., by chemical coupling, genetic fusion, noncovalent association, or otherwise) to at least one other molecular entity, such as another binding protein (e.g., a bispecific or a multispecific binding protein), toxins, radioisotopes, cytotoxic or cytostatic agents, among others. Other permutations and possibilities are apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art, and they are considered equivalents within the scope of this invention.\n\n\nPharmaceutical Compositions and Methods of Administration\n\n\nCertain embodiments of the invention include compositions comprising the disclosed binding proteins. The compositions may be suitable for pharmaceutical use and administration to patients. The compositions comprise a binding protein of the present invention and a pharmaceutical excipient. As used herein, “pharmaceutical excipient” includes solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, etc., that are compatible with pharmaceutical administration. Use of these agents for pharmaceutically active substances is well known in the art. The compositions may also contain other active compounds providing supplemental, additional, or enhanced therapeutic functions. The pharmaceutical compositions may also be included in a container, pack, or dispenser, together with instructions for administration.\n\n\nA pharmaceutical composition of the invention is formulated to be compatible with its intended route of administration. Methods to accomplish the administration are known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Pharmaceutical compositions may be topically or orally administered, or capable of transmission across mucous membranes. Examples of administration of a pharmaceutical composition include oral ingestion or inhalation. Administration may also be intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, intracavity, subcutaneous, cutaneous, or transdermal.\n\n\nSolutions or suspensions used for intradermal or subcutaneous application typically include at least one of the following components: a sterile diluent such as water, saline solution, fixed oils, polyethylene glycol, glycerine, propylene glycol, or other synthetic solvent; antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA); buffers such as acetate, citrate, or phosphate; and tonicity agents such as sodium chloride or dextrose. The pH can be adjusted with acids or bases by methods known in the art. Such preparations may be enclosed in ampoules, disposable syringes, or multiple dose vials.\n\n\nSolutions or suspensions used for intravenous administration include a carrier such as physiological saline, bacteriostatic water, CREMOPHOR EL® (BASF Corp., Ludwigshafen, Germany), ethanol, or polyol. In all cases, the composition must be sterile and fluid for easy syringability. Proper fluidity can often be obtained using lecithin or surfactants. The composition must also be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage. Prevention of microorganisms can be achieved with antibacterial and antifungal agents, e.g., parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thimerosal, etc. In many cases, isotonic agents (sugar), polyalcohols (e.g., mannitol and sorbitol), or sodium chloride may be included in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the composition can be accomplished by adding an agent that delays absorption, e.g., aluminum monostearate or gelatin.\n\n\nOral compositions include an inert diluent or edible carrier. For the purpose of oral administration, the binding proteins can be incorporated with excipients and placed, e.g., in tablets, troches, capsules, or gelatin. Pharmaceutically compatible binding agents or adjuvant materials can be included in the composition. The compositions may contain (1) a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatin; (2) an excipient such as starch or lactose, (3) a disintegrating agent such as alginic acid, Primogel, or corn starch; (4) a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; (5) a glidant such as colloidal silicon dioxide; and/or (6) a sweetening or flavoring agent.\n\n\nThe composition may also be administered by a transmucosal or transdermal route. For example, binding proteins that comprise an Fc portion (for example, an antibody) may be capable of crossing mucous membranes in the intestine, mouth, or lungs (via Fc receptors). Transmucosal administration can be accomplished by lozenges, nasal sprays, inhalers, or suppositories. Transdermal administration can be accomplished with a composition containing ointments, salves, gels, or creams known in the art. For transmucosal or transdermal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used. For administration by inhalation, the binding proteins may be delivered in an aerosol spray from a pressured container or dispenser, which contains a propellant (e.g., liquid or gas), or a nebulizer.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the binding proteins of this invention are prepared with carriers to protect the binding proteins against rapid elimination from the body. Biodegradable polymers (e.g., ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid) are often used. Methods for the preparation of such formulations are known by those skilled in the art. Liposomal suspensions can be used as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers also. The liposomes can be prepared according to established methods known in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,522,811).\n\n\nThe binding proteins or binding protein compositions of the invention are administered in therapeutically effective amounts as described. Therapeutically effective amounts may vary with the subject's age, condition, sex, and severity of medical condition. Appropriate dosages can be determined by a physician based upon clinical indications. The binding proteins or compositions may be given as a bolus dose to maximize the circulating levels of binding proteins for the greatest length of time. Continuous infusion may also be used.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “subject” is intended to include human and nonhuman animals. Subjects may include a human patient having a disorder characterized by cells that express IL-21R, e.g., a cancer cell or an immune cell. The term “nonhuman animals” of the invention includes all vertebrates, such as nonhuman primates, sheep, dogs, cows, chickens, amphibians, reptiles, etc.\n\n\nExamples of dosage ranges that can be administered to a subject can be chosen from: 1 μg/kg to 20 mg/kg, 1 μg/kg to 10 mg/kg, 1 μg/kg to 1 mg/kg, 10 μg/kg to 1 mg/kg, 10 μg/kg to 100 μg/kg, 100 μg/kg to 1 mg/kg, 250 μg/kg to 2 mg/kg, 250 μg/kg to 1 mg/kg, 500 μg/kg to 2 mg/kg, 500 μg/kg to 1 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg to 5 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg, 15 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg to 25 mg/kg, 15 mg/kg to 25 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg to 25 mg/kg, and 20 mg/kg to 30 mg/kg (or higher). These dosages may be administered daily, weekly, biweekly, monthly, or less frequently, for example, biannually, depending on dosage, method of administration, disorder or symptom(s) to be treated, and individual subject characteristics.\n\n\nIn certain circumstances, it may be advantageous to formulate compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited for the patient. Each dosage unit contains a predetermined quantity of binding protein calculated to produce a therapeutic effect in association with the carrier. The dosage unit depends on the characteristics of the binding protein and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved.\n\n\nToxicity and therapeutic efficacy of the composition can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., determining the LD\n50 \n(the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED\n50 \n(the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD\n50\n/ED\n50\n. Binding proteins that exhibit large therapeutic indices may be less toxic and/or more therapeutically effective.\n\n\nThe data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used to formulate a dosage range in humans. The dosage of these compounds may lie within the range of circulating binding protein concentrations in the blood, which includes an ED\n50 \nwith little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage composition form employed and the route of administration. For any binding protein used in the present invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially using cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC\n50 \n(i.e., the concentration of binding protein that achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms). The effects of any particular dosage can be monitored by a suitable bioassay. Examples of suitable bioassays include DNA replication assays, transcription-based assays, gene expression assays, IL-21/IL-21R binding assays, and other immunological assays.\n\n\nThe entire contents of all references, patent applications, and patents cited throughout this application are hereby incorporated by reference herein.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nThe invention will be further illustrated in the following nonlimiting examples. These Examples are set forth to aid in the understanding of the invention but are not intended to, and should not be construed to, limit its scope in any way. The Examples do not include detailed descriptions of conventional methods that would be well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nGeneration of Binding Proteins by Phage Display\n\n\nThe scFv parental clone 18A5, described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,495,085 (incorporated by reference herein), was obtained from the CS human scFv library by standard phage display methods, using BaF3 cells expressing human IL-21R as a target in \nrounds\n 1 and 3 and biotinylated IL-21R-Fc fusion protein as a target in \nround\n 2.\n\n\nExample 2\n\n\nLibrary Construction\n\n\nPhage display libraries were based upon the parental 18A5 scFv, using a pCANTAB6 vector in which the scFv was fused at its 3′ end to the intact gene Ill. Various CDR3 sequences were derived using techniques well known in the art.\n\n\nTwo overlapping blocks of six consecutive codons were randomized in the CDR3 of the V\nH \nand the V\nL\n, producing a total of four libraries: H3B1, H3B2, L3B1, and L3B2. The following identify nucleotide and amino acid sequences, respectively: IL-21R: 18A5 V\nH\nCDR3 [SEQ ID NOs:199 and 200]; H3B1 (library size 1.40×10\n9\n) [SEQ ID NOs:201 and 202]; H3B2 (library size 1.00×10\n9\n) [SEQ ID NOs:203 and 204]; IL-21R: 18A5 V\nL\nCDR3 [SEQ ID NOs:205 and 206]; L3B1 (library size 9.00×10\n9\n) [SEQ ID NOs:207 and 208]; L3B2 (library size 6.40×10\n9\n) [SEQ ID NOs:209 and 210].\n\n\nExample 3\n\n\nPhage Selection\n\n\nAll derivatives of 18A5 were isolated from the scFv libraries above by selection of phage able to bind in solution phase to biotinylated human IL-21R extracellular domain His-Flag fusion proteins (“biotin-hIL-21R-H/F”) and biotinylated murine IL-21R extracellular domain His-Flag fusion proteins (“biotin-mIL-21R-H/F”); all procedures and techniques related to selection are well known to one of skill in the art. A total of twenty-seven anti-IL-21R scFv were isolated by phage selection procedures.\n\n\nExample 4\n\n\nLibrary Screening\n\n\nResulting binding proteins in scFv format were chosen based on their ability to compete with parental 18A5 in human IgG1 format for binding to biotin-hIL-21R-H/F and biotin-mIL-21R-H/F, to prevent the hIL-21-dependent proliferation of genetically engineered cell lines expressing human IL-21R and the mIL-21-dependent proliferation of genetically engineered cell lines expressing murine IL-21R.\n\n\nExample 4.1\n\n\nPreparation of Crude Periplasmic Material (“Peri-Preps”) for Use in Screening Assays\n\n\nDepending on the growth conditions used, scFv can be expressed in solution in the bacterial periplasmic space. To induce release of scFv into the periplasm, 96-deep-well plates containing 990 \nμl\n 2×TY media with 0.1% glucose/100 μg/ml ampicillin were inoculated from thawed glycerol stocks (one clone per well) using the QPix2 Colony picker (Genetix, New Milton, England) and grown at 37° C. (999 rpm) for about 4 hr. Cultures were induced with IPTG at a final concentration of 0.02 mM and grown overnight at 30° C. (999 rpm). The contents of the bacterial periplasm (peri-preps) were released by osmotic shock. Briefly, plates were centrifuged and pellets were resuspended in 150 μl TES periplasmic buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 8.0)/1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0)/20% Sucrose), followed by the addition of 150 μl 1:5 TES:water, and incubated on ice for 30 min. Plates were centrifuged and the scFv-containing supernatant was harvested.\n\n\nExample 4.2\n\n\nEpitope Competition Assay for Library Screening\n\n\nThose scFv able to compete with the parental 18A5 antibody for binding to human or murine IL-21R were identified from selected phage by a homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF®) assay. Purified parental 18A5 antibody was covalently modified with cryptate, a derivative of europium, according to the instructions in an HTRF® Cryptate Labeling Kit (Cisbio, Bedford, Mass.). Peri-preps of scFv were prepared as described above and diluted to 0.25% in PBS/0.4 M potassium fluoride/0.1% BSA (HTRF® buffer); then 10 μl of the mixture was transferred to the wells of black 384-shallow-well plates (Nunc, Rochester, N.Y.). Five μl of cryptate-conjugated 18A5 antibody was then added to each well, followed by 5 μl of a mixture of a 1:800 dilution of streptavidin-XL665 conjugate (Cisbio), and either 4.8 nM biotin-hIL-21R-H/F or 40 nM biotin-mIL-21R-H/F. The mixture was incubated for 2 hr at RT, and time-resolved fluorescence measurements were made (340 nm excitation, 615 nm and 665 nm emission). Competition with 18A5 antibody was indicated by a reduction in the background-corrected ratio of emission at 665 nm to emission at 615 nm.\n\n\nA total of 8280 independently isolated scFv were screened in the HTRF® assay using human IL-21R-H/F, and 376 clones able to compete with the parental 18A5 antibody for binding to biotin-hIL-21R-H/F were chosen for further analysis.\n\n\nExample 5\n\n\nDNA Sequence Analysis of Library-Derived scFv-PCR Amplification of scFv Regions for Sequencing Analysis\n\n\nThe sequences of 287 18A5-derived scFv variants with improved IL-21R binding over that of the parent 18A5 scFv molecule were determined, and the frequencies of amino acids found at each position were determined. Among the V\nH \nclones, only two (1.7%) were derived from a library which mutated the last six amino acids of, e.g., SEQ ID NO: 169 (at the C-terminus of V\nH \nCDR3), while the remainder were derived from a library which mutated the first six amino acids of, e.g., SEQ ID NO: 169. Among the V\nL \nclones, only one clone (0.6%) was derived from a library in which the last six amino acids of, e.g., SEQ ID NO: 170 (at the C-terminus of V\nL \nCDR3) were mutated, while the majority were derived from alterations in the first six amino acids of, e.g., SEQ ID NO: 170 (at the N-terminus of V\nL \nCDR3).\n\n\nPCR amplification of scFvs was carried out using VENT® DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs, Ispwich, Mass.) in HN buffer (Epicentre Biotechnologies, Madison, Wis.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Five μl of a 1:10 dilution of a stationary phase bacterial culture was used as the template for a final reaction volume of 20 μl. The cycling conditions used were a 2-min hot start at 94° C., 30 cycles of denaturation at 94° C. (1 min), primer annealing at 55° C. (2 min) and extension at 72° C.

Single colonies were grown in 20 \nml\n 2×TY medium with 0.1% glucose/100 μg/ml ampicillin in 50-ml conical tubes to mid-logarithmic phase at 37° C. with shaking at 250 rpm. Expression of scFv was induced with IPTG at a final concentration of 0.02 mM, and cultures were grown overnight at 30° C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 1 ml TES periplasmic buffer, followed by the addition of 1 ml 1:5 TES:water and incubation on ice for 30 min. Lysates were centrifuged at 3200 rpm for 10 min at 4° C., and supernatants were brought to 2 mM MgCl\n2\n. scFv were captured on Ni-NTA PHYTIPs® (PhyNexus) by repeated passage of the supernatant over the PHYTIPs® on a Perkin Elmer (Waltham, Mass.) MINITRAK™ IX liquid handling robot, followed by washing in IMAC wash buffer and elution with 200 mM imidazole, 50 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl (pH 8.0). The buffer was exchanged to PBS by three cycles of dilution 1:10 into PBS, followed by concentration on a 10,000 molecular weight cutoff filter plate (Millipore MULTISCREEN ULTRACEL™ 96-well ultrafiltration plate, Millipore, Billerica, Mass.). Samples were quantitated using a Micro BCA™ kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Rockford, Ill.) using the manufacturer's bovine serum albumin standard.\n\n\nExample 6.2\n\n\nAssays for IL-21-Dependent Proliferation of Cells Overexpressing Human or Murine IL-21R\n\n\nInhibition assays were performed with 18A5-derived binding proteins (scFv and IgG) to measure their blockade of IL-21-dependent proliferation of cell lines transfected with human or murine IL-21R. BaF3 cells, a murine pre-B cell line, and TF1 cells, a human erythroid cell line, were retrovirally transduced with IL-21R and green fluorescent protein (GFP). Cells were routinely grown in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.00036% β-mercaptoethanol. Human IL-21R-BaF3 cell cultures were supplemented with 50 ng/ml of human IL-21; murine IL-21R-BaF3 cell cultures were supplemented with 10 U/ml of IL-3; TF1 cell cultures were supplemented with 50 ng/ml of GM-CSF. Prior to assay, cells were washed 3× in assay medium lacking supplemental growth factors, resuspended in assay medium, and incubated at 37° C./5% CO\n2 \nfor 6 hr. To prepare assay plates, 5000 cells were added to the central 60 wells of a 96-well flat-bottomed white tissue culture plate (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, Mass.) in a volume of 55 μl/well. Test scFv or IgG samples were prepared by diluting the stock sample in assay medium and diluting serially three-fold. Twenty-five μl of the binding protein samples were added to the cells and incubated for 30 min at 37° C./5% CO\n2\n. Twenty μl of assay medium containing 100-400 pg/ml of human or murine IL-21 was added to each well, and the cells were incubated for an additional 48 hr. Proliferation was measured by bringing plates to RT, adding 15 μl/well CELLTITER-GLO®, incubating for 10 min at RT, and measuring luminescence with a Perkin Elmer ENVISION™ plate reader. After purification with PhyNexus IMAC tips, 108 scFv were tested for neutralization of IL-21-dependent proliferation of all three cell lines. All showed neutralization of human IL-21R-BaF3 cells, with IC\n50\ns lower than or equal to that of the parental 18A5 scFv. A subset showed strong neutralization of proliferation of murine IL-21R-BaF3 cells and human IL-21R-TF1 cells. Data from the 27 most potent clones are shown in \nFIGS. 1-3\n, and are summarized in Table 5.\n\n\n \nFIGS. 1-3\n show the neutralization of proliferation by scFv of human IL-21R-BaF3 cells (\nFIGS. 1\n \na\n-\nc\n); human IL-21R-TF1 cells (\nFIGS. 2\n \na\n-\nc\n); and murine IL-21R-BaF3 cells (\nFIGS. 3\n \na\n-\nc\n). Cells were mixed with the indicated scFv and incubated with 100 pg/ml (\nFIGS. 1-2\n) or 400 pg/ml (\nFIG. 3\n) of human IL-21.\n\n\nExample 6.3\n\n\nQuantitative Epitope Competition Assay\n\n\nPurified scFv were analyzed quantitatively for their ability to compete with the parental 18A5 antibody for binding to murine IL-21R in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Parental 18A5 antibody was coated overnight at 4° C. on 96-well Nunc MAXISORP® plates at a concentration of 0.75 μg/ml in PBS. Plates were washed 3× using PBS, and then blocked for 3 hr at RT in PBS/1% BSA/0.05% Tween-20. scFv were mixed with 36 nM biotinylated mIL-21R-H/F and incubated for 10 min at RT. Blocked plates were washed 3× with PBS, and 50 μl/well of scFv/IL-21R mixtures were transferred to the appropriate plates and incubated for 1 hr at RT. Plates were washed 5× with PBS prior to the addition of a 1:6000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, Ala.) secondary antibody to detect bound biotinylated mIL-21R-H/F. Plates were then incubated for 1 hr at RT and washed 7× with PBS. Signal was developed using 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), the reaction stopped with H\n2\nSO\n4\n, and the absorbance read at 450 nm on an ENVISION™ plate reader (Perkin Elmer). 108 scFv purified by PhyNexus IMAC tips were tested in this assay, and most competed with the parental 18A5 antibody for binding to biotinylated murine IL-21R-H/F with IC\n50\ns lower than that of the parental 18A5 scFv.

Four scFv with modified V\nH \nregions, H3, H4, H5, and H6, along with the germlined parental 18A5 V\nH \n(see below) were chosen for conversion to full-length human IgG1.\n\n\nThe V\nH \nand V\nL \namino sequences of the parental 18A5 antibody were modified so that the sequences outside the CDR regions matched the closest human germline sequences: DP67/V\nH\n4B+ (VBASE_AA:WAP00CEAZ\n—\n1) and JH1/JH4/JH5 in the case of the V\nH\n, and DPL16/V\nL\n3.1 (VBASE_AA:WAP00CEMI\n—\n1) in the case of the V\nL\n. Modifications were done by a combination of gene synthesis at GENEART (Regensburg, Germany) and site-directed changes introduced by PCR. In addition, the sequences were codon-optimized for expression in mammalian cells by GENEART using their proprietary methods.

Each light chain in the set of sixteen test sequences (germlined parental 18A5 V\nL \nand L2, L3, L6, L9, L11, L13, L14, L16, L17, L18, L19, L20, L23, L24 and L25) was paired with each heavy chain in the set of five test sequences (H3, H4, H5, and H6, along with V\nH\n \n \n—\n \nP, the germlined parental 18A5 V\nH \ndomain). Each plasmid in the pair (1.4 μg) was combined with the TRANSIT® transfection reagent (Mirus, Madison, Wis.) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and DNA:TRANSIT® reagent complexes were added to monolayers of cos-7 cells growing in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum/penicillin/streptomycin/2 mM L-glutamine in 6-well tissue culture plates. After 24 hr, the medium was changed to a serum-free medium (R1CD1), and was then collected 48 hr later. Binding proteins, now comprising full-length antibodies, were quantitated by anti-human IgG ELISA.\n\n\nExample 9.2\n\n\nActivity of Anti-IL-21R IgG in Neutralization of Cell Proliferation\n\n\nThe 80 transiently expressed IgGs in serum-free conditioned medium were tested for activity in IL-21-dependent proliferation assays in three cell lines as described above: (1) human IL-21R-BaF3 cells, (2) murine IL-21R-BaF3 cells, and (3) human IL-21R-TF1 cells. All 80 pairs showed neutralization of proliferation of human IL-21R-expressing BaF3 cells, and all pairs except those involving \nV\n \n \n \nH\n4 showed neutralization of human IL-21R-expressing TF1 cells (data not shown). All 80 pairs also showed neutralization of proliferation of murine IL-21R-expressing BaF3 cells, with the strongest neutralization generally associated with light chains paired with the parental heavy chain and the weakest neutralization generally associated with the \nV\n \n \n \nH\n4 heavy chain (data not shown).

Cells were transfected 48 hr prior to the assay. On the day of the assay, cells were washed gently 5× in PBS containing 0.9 mM CaCl\n2 \nand 0.45 mM MgCl\n2 \n(PBS/CaMg) on an automated plate washer (Titertek, Huntsville, Ala.), and blocked for 1 hr at RT in PBS/CaMg/5% nonfat dry milk. Conditioned media from transiently expressed anti-IL-21R IgGs were serially diluted in blocking buffer and added to the cells in the blocked plates for 1 hr at RT. Cells were washed 5× with PBS/CaMg and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-human IgG for 1 hr at RT. Cells were then washed 10× in PBS/CaMg and all of the wash buffer was removed. Cells were incubated with 100 μl TMB until the color reaction reached saturation, stopped with 100 μl of 0.18 M H\n2\nSO\n4\n, and read at A450 on a Perkin Elmer ENVISION™ plate reader.\n\n\nAll of the twenty-one IgGs bound to CHO cells transiently expressing human (\nFIGS. 6\n \na\n-\nc\n), rat (\nFIGS. 6\n \nd\n-\nf\n), or cynomolgus monkey (\nFIGS. 6\n \ng\n-\ni\n) IL-21R.

Anti-human-IgG, anti-murine immunoglobulin antibodies, and murine IL-21R-H/F were immobilized onto a research-grade carboxymethyl-dextran chip (CM5) using standard amine coupling. The sensor chip surface was activated with EDC/NHS for 7 min at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. The first flow cell was used as reference surface to correct for bulk refractive index, matrix effects, and nonspecific binding. Capture antibodies (7,150 resonance units (RU) of anti-human-Fc antibody (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, Calif.) on \nflow cell\n 2 and 7,500 RU of anti-murine-Fc antibody on flow cell 3) were diluted to 10 μg/ml in sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) and injected over the activated surface. Remaining activated groups were blocked with 1.0 M ethanolamine (pH 8.0). The molecular weights of the anti-human IgG and the anti-murine IgG were both 150 kD, and the molecular weight of the IL-21R monomer was 27 kD.\n\n\nConditioned media containing anti-IL-21R antibodies and antibody controls (murine anti-human IL-2Rβ and murine anti-human IL-4R(R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.); human anti-human IL-13 (Wyeth, Cambridge, Mass.)) were diluted in HBS/EP buffer supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum and injected onto all four flow cells of the BIACORE™ chip, capturing 500-700 (RU) of antibody on the species-appropriate capture antibody. Following a 5 sec washing period, 50 nM solutions of a positive control protein (murine IL-21R-H/F), two human proteins related to IL-21R (human IL-2Rβ and human sIL-4R(R&D Systems)), or an unrelated His/FLAG-tagged protein (human IL-13-H/F), were injected over the captured antibodies on the chip. The association and dissociation phases were monitored for 120 and 180 sec, respectively, followed by two 5 μl injections of glycine (pH 1.5) to regenerate a fully active capturing surface. All binding experiments were done at 25° C. in HBS/EP buffer. Blank and buffer effects were subtracted for each sensorgram using double referencing.\n\n\nAll of the anti-IL-21R antibodies tested (18A5 antibody and AbA-AbU) showed clear binding to murine IL-21R, but no binding to the IL-21R-related proteins human IL-2Rβ and human soluble IL-4R, or to the unrelated His/FLAG-tagged protein human IL-13-His/FLAG (\nFIGS. 7\n \na\n-\nc\n). Controls indicated that IL-2Rβ and human soluble IL-4R could be captured by specific anti-IL-2Rβ and anti-IL-4R antibodies (\nFIG. 7\n \nd\n).\n\n\nExample 9.5\n\n\nPurification of Transiently Expressed Antibodies\n\n\nSeven antibodies (human IgG1 triple-mutant versions: AbS, AbT, AbO, AbP, and AbU; and double-mutant versions: AbQ and AbR) were transiently expressed in cos-7 cells and purified for further analysis. In addition, three versions of AbT with human IgG tails expected to have different levels of Fc receptor binding (wild-type IgG1, IgG4, and IgG1 double-mutants) were also prepared. The TRANSIT® protocol described above was followed, except that 25 μg of each plasmid was used to transfect cells in each of eight T-175 flasks. Following the first harvest of conditioned medium, fresh R1CD1 was added and then collected after an additional 72 hr. Conditioned media were pooled and filtered on a 0.22 μm filter. Antibodies were loaded onto protein A resin, eluted with 20 mM citric acid/150 mM sodium chloride (pH 2.5), neutralized with Tris (pH 8.5), and dialyzed into PBS.\n\n\nExample 9.6\n\n\nBIACORE™ Analysis of Antibody Binding to Human and Murine IL-21R\n\n\nThe kinetics of binding of anti-IL-21R antibodies to human and murine IL-21R-H/F was tested on a BIACORE™ surface plasmon resonance instrument. Anti-human IgG antibodies (Invitrogen Corporation) were immobilized onto a research-grade carboxy-methyl-dextran chip (CM5) using standard amine coupling. The surface was activated with EDC/NHS for 7 min at a flow of 20 μl/min. The first flow cell was used as a reference surface to correct for bulk refractive index, matrix effects, and nonspecific binding. The anti-human-Fc antibody was diluted to 20 μg/ml in 10 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0), and 2950-3405 resonance units (RU) were captured on each of the four flow cells. Remaining activated groups were blocked with 1.0 M ethanolamine-HCl (pH 8.5).\n\n\nAnti-IL-21R antibodies were diluted to 0.1-0.2 μg/ml in HBS/EP buffer supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin and loaded onto the BIACORE™ chip. Following a brief washing period, solutions of 0-100 nM human IL-21R-H/F or 10-500 nM murine IL-21R-H/F were injected over the chip at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. The association phase was run for 3 min for human and murine IL-21R kinetics, and the dissociation phase was monitored for 15 min for hIL-21R and for 5 min for mIL-21R, followed by two 10 μl injections and one 30 μl injection of glycine (pH 1.5), to regenerate a fully active capturing surface. All binding experiments were done at 25° C. in HBS/EP buffer, and the sample rack was kept at 15° C. Blank and buffer effects were subtracted for each sensorgram using double referencing. Sensorgrams are shown in \nFIGS. 8\n \na\n-\nb \n(human IL-21R-His/FLAG) and \n8\n \nc\n-\nd \n(murine IL-21R-His/FLAG). Binding kinetic parameters are shown in Table 7A, and additional kinetic data from a replicate experiment are shown in Table 7B.\n\n\nIn addition, AbS and AbT were tested for binding kinetics to cynomolgus monkey IL-21R-His/FLAG by the above-described protocol. Binding profiles to human and cynomolgus monkey IL-21R-H/F were similar for both AbS and AbT (\nFIG. 9\n). \nFIG. 9\n shows cynomolgus monkey IL-21R-His/FLAG binding to AbS (\n9\n \na\n); and to AbT (\n9\n \nc\n); and human IL-21R-His/FLAG binding to AbS (\n9\n \nb\n); and AbT (\n9\n \nd\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 7A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKinetic Parameters of Anti-IL-21R Antibody Binding Human and\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMurine IL-21R-His/FLAG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHuman IL-21R\n\n\nMurine IL-21R\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nka\n\n\nkd\n\n\nKD\n\n\nka\n\n\nkd\n\n\nKD\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntibody\n\n\n(1/Ms)\n\n\n(1/s)\n\n\n(M)\n\n\n(1/Ms)\n\n\n(1/s)\n\n\n(M)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n18A5\n\n\n2.43E+05\n\n\n1.08E−03\n\n\n4.43E−09\n\n\n2.12E+05\n\n\n1.53E−02\n\n\n7.20E−08\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbO\n\n\n2.41E+05\n\n\n1.14E−04\n\n\n4.75E−10\n\n\n1.12E+05\n\n\n5.49E−03\n\n\n4.92E−08\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbP\n\n\n1.94E+05\n\n\n1.19E−04\n\n\n6.15E−10\n\n\n9.99E+04\n\n\n5.08E−03\n\n\n5.08E−08\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbQ\n\n\n4.39E+05\n\n\n9.34E−05\n\n\n2.13E−10\n\n\n3.01E+05\n\n\n2.07E−02\n\n\n6.88E−08\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbR\n\n\n1.70E+05\n\n\n9.61E−05\n\n\n5.67E−10\n\n\n7.65E+04\n\n\n4.93E−03\n\n\n6.45E−08\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbS\n\n\n1.44E+05\n\n\n2.91E−04\n\n\n2.02E−09\n\n\n1.99E+05\n\n\n3.32E−03\n\n\n1.67E−08\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbT\n\n\n1.79E+05\n\n\n6.78E−05\n\n\n3.79E−10\n\n\n2.11E+05\n\n\n3.31E−03\n\n\n1.57E−08\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbU\n\n\n1.86E+05\n\n\n8.18E−05\n\n\n4.40E−10\n\n\n9.81E+04\n\n\n4.34E−03\n\n\n4.42E−08\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 7B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKinetic Parameters of Anti-IL-21R Antibody Binding Human\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIL-21R-His/FLAG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHuman IL-21R\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nka\n\n\nkd\n\n\nKD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAntibody\n\n\n(1/Ms)\n\n\n(1/s)\n\n\n(M)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n18A5\n\n\n3.04E+05\n\n\n1.34E−03\n\n\n4.40E−09\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAbP\n\n\n2.33E+05\n\n\n1.02E−04\n\n\n4.36E−10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAbQ\n\n\n4.39E+05\n\n\n9.34E−05\n\n\n2.13E−10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAbR\n\n\n2.48E+05\n\n\n9.76E−05\n\n\n3.94E−10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAbS\n\n\n2.02E+05\n\n\n3.05E−04\n\n\n1.51E−09\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAbT\n\n\n2.73E+05\n\n\n7.42E−05\n\n\n2.72E−10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAbU\n\n\n2.38E+05\n\n\n7.83E−05\n\n\n3.29E−10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 9.7\n\n\nBIACORE™ Epitope Competition Assay\n\n\nAntibodies AbS and AbT and the parental antibody 18A5 were immobilized directly onto a CM5 BIACORE™ chip. Murine IL-21R-H/F (100 nM) was allowed to flow over the chip for 300 sec, followed by a wash (100 sec), and then a 5 μg/ml solution of either AbS, AbT, D5, or a nonneutralizing anti-mIL-21R antibody (7C2) was allowed to flow over the surface. No additional binding was observed with AbS, AbT, and D5, indicating that their binding site on mIL-21R-H/F was blocked by concurrent binding to AbS, AbT, or 18A5 antibody (\nFIG. 10\n \na\n). In contrast, the nonneutralizing control anti-IL-21R antibody 7C2 was able to bind to mIL-21R-H/F captured on AbS, AbT, or 18A5 antibody, indicating that this control antibody bound at a different epitope from the one bound by the capture antibodies.\n\n\nSimilarly, AbS and AbT did not bind to human IL-21R-H/F captured by AbS or AbT immobilized on a CM5 BIACORE™ chip, while the control anti-human IL-21R antibody (9D2) was able to bind human IL-21R-H/F captured by AbS or AbT (\nFIG. 10\n \nb\n). This observation suggested that the binding site for AbS is blocked by concurrent binding by AbT, and vice versa.\n\n\nExample 9.8\n\n\nCell-based Proliferation Assays\n\n\nPurified IgGs were tested for activity in IL-21-dependent proliferation assays in three cell lines as described above: human IL-21R-BaF3 cells, murine IL-21R-BaF3 cells, and human IL-21R-TF-1 cells. All showed strong inhibition of both human and murine IL-21R-dependent proliferation with greater potency than that of the parental 18A5 IgG (\nFIG. 11\n, Table 8). Assays were conducted on human IL-21R-BaF3 cells with 100 pg/ml of human IL-21 (\nFIG. 11\n \na\n), murine IL-21R-BaF3 cells with 200 pg/ml of murine IL-21 (\nFIG. 11\n \nb\n), and human IL-21R-TF-1 cells with 100 pg/ml of human IL-21 (\nFIG. 11\n \nc\n). \nFIG. 26\n \nd \ndepicts the results of an additional study of the effects of these antibodies on human IL-21R-BaF3 cells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeutralization of Proliferation of Human IL-21R-BaF3 Cells, Murine\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIL-21R-BaF3 Cells, and Human IL-21R-TF-1 Cells\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHuman\n\n\nMurine\n\n\nHuman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIL-21R-BaF3\n\n\nIL-21R-BaF3\n\n\nIL-21R-TF1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNeutralization\n\n\nNeutralization\n\n\nNeutralization\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntibody\n\n\nIC\n50 \n(nM)\n\n\nIC\n50 \n(nM)\n\n\nIC\n50 \n(nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n18A5\n\n\n1.71\n\n\n177.23 \n\n\n13.99 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nantibody\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbR\n\n\n0.56\n\n\n0.34\n\n\n1.63\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbS\n\n\n0.68\n\n\n0.04\n\n\n6.67\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbT\n\n\n0.30\n\n\n0.05\n\n\n2.32\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbX\n\n\n0.54\n\n\nnd\n\n\nnd\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIL21R-Fc\n\n\n0.20 (human\n\n\n0.04 (mouse\n\n\n7.22 (human\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIL-21R-Fc)\n\n\nIL-21R-Fc)\n\n\nIL-21R-Fc)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 9.9\n\n\nPrimary Human B cell Proliferation Assays\n\n\nAnti-IL-21R antibodies were tested for their ability to inhibit IL-21-dependent proliferation of primary human B cells.

The resulting population (60-80% CD19\n+\n B cells) were cultured in RPMI containing 10% FBS, 50 U/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mM L-glutamine at 1×10\n5\n/well in 96-well flat-bottom plates. B cells were pretreated with serially diluted anti-human IL-21R antibodies in a 37° C. incubator adjusted to 5% CO\n2 \nfor 30 min.

The resulting population was ˜80-90% CD4\n+\n/CD3\n+\n T cells. Enriched human CD4\n+\n T cells were activated for 3 days with anti-CD3/anti-CD28-coated microspheres in RPMI containing 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine, and HEPES in a 37° C. incubator adjusted to 5% CO\n2\n.

Popliteal, axillary, brachial, and inguinal lymph nodes and spleens from 12-week-old female BALB/C mice were collected. A single-cell suspension of the spleen cells was depleted of red blood cells using 0.16 M NH\n4\nCl in 0.017 M Tris (pH 7.4). The spleen and lymph node cells were pooled and enriched for CD8\n+\n cells using a murine T cell CD8 Subset Column Kit (R&D Systems). Murine CD8\n+\n cells (3×10\n4\n; suspended in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum and supplemented with 0.05 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM L-glutamine, 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 50 μg/ml gentamicin) were plated in 96-well, anti-mCD3 activation plates (BD Biosciences); mIL-21 (50 ng/ml) was added to all the wells.

The day before the experiment, PBMC were isolated from buffy coat by diluting the buffy coat 1:1 in PBS, layering it over FICOLL® (GE Healthcare), and centrifuging at 1200 g for 20 min. PBMCs were removed from the top of the FICOLL® layer, washed, and stimulated overnight with 10 ng/ml IL-2 and 10 ng/ml IL-12 (R&D Systems). The day of the experiment, stimulated PBMCs were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in media at 1×10\n8 \ncells/ml. BJAB cells were labeled with 0.5 μM CFSE (MOLECULAR PROBES®, Invitrogen Corporation) for 10 min at 37° C., and then washed with fetal bovine serum once and PBS twice. Cells were then plated into a 96-well flat-bottom plate at 2×10\n5 \ncells/well in 100 μl media. Fifty μl of the 4× antibodies were added to the BJAB cells, followed by 5×10\n6 \nPBMC in 50 μl, giving a final 1:25 target:effector cell ratio. Cells were incubated at 37° C. for 6 hr and stained with propidium iodide (PI) to label dead and dying cells. Killing of target cells (CFSE\n+\n) was assessed by measuring PI staining in a FACSCALIBUR™ flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Only one anti-IL-21R antibody, AbZ, which has a wild-type human IgG1 constant region, showed ADCC above the background level displayed by a control anti-IL-13 antibody that did not bind to the target cells. All antibodies with the same variable domains as AbZ, including forms with human IgG4 (AbY), and those with double-mutant (AbX) and triple-mutant (AbT) forms of human IgG1, showed only background levels of ADCC (\nFIG. 15\n). All other anti-IL-21R antibodies tested contained the triple-mutant form of human IgG1 and showed background ADCC. A positive control antibody, rituximab (RITUXAN®), induced ADCC in all experiments.\n\n\nExample 9.13\n\n\nC1q ELISA\n\n\nIn order to determine whether cell-surface binding by anti-IL-21R antibodies is likely to lead to complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), the antibodies were tested for their ability to bind to the complement component C1q in an ELISA. IL-21R antibodies and rituximab (RITUXAN®) were diluted in PBS to 5 μg/ml. Diluted antibodies (100 μl) were coated onto a COSTAR® high-binding ELISA plate (Corning Life Sciences, Lowell, Mass.) overnight at 4° C. Plates were washed 3× with PBS/Tween-20 and blocked with 200 μl of blocking buffer (0.1 M NaPO\n4\n, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.1% gelatin, 0.01% Tween) for 1 hr at RT. Human serum previously determined to contain C1q (Quidel, San Diego, Calif.) was diluted 1:50 in PBS. After 1 hr of blocking, plates were washed and 100 μl of diluted serum was added to each well and incubated for 2 hr at RT on a shaker. Following three washes, 100 μl of 0.1 μg/ml chicken polyclonal anti-human C1q antibody (AbCam, Cambridge, Mass.) was added to each well and incubated for 1 hr at RT. Plates were again washed and incubated with 100 μl of a rabbit polyclonal antibody to chicken Ig-Y—HRP diluted 1:4000 (AbCam) for 1 hr at RT. Plates were washed and developed with TMB for 5 min, followed by 50 μl of 1 M H\n2\nSO\n4 \nto stop the reaction, and then read at 450 nm. Only one anti-IL-21R antibody, AbZ, which has a wild-type human IgG1 constant region, showed C1q binding above the background level displayed by a control antibody with a triple-mutant human IgG1 constant region that had previously been shown to lack C1q binding. All antibodies with the same variable domains as AbZ, including forms with human IgG4 (AbY), and those with double-mutant (AbX) and triple-mutant (AbT) forms of human IgG1, showed only background levels of C1q binding (\nFIG. 16\n). All other anti-IL-21R antibodies tested contained the triple-mutant form of human IgG1 and showed background C1q binding.\n\n\nExample 9.14\n\n\nCytokine Competition Assay\n\n\nIn order to demonstrate that antibody AbT binds to the murine IL-21R in a manner that competes with the IL-21 cytokine, a cytokine competition assay was performed. Antibody AbT was coated at 1 μg/ml onto ELISA plates, which were then blocked with 1% BSA in PBS/0.05% Tween. Biotinylated murine IL-21R-His/FLAG (1.5 ng/ml) was added to the wells, either alone or in the presence of increasing concentrations of murine IL-21, and the binding of the receptor to the immobilized antibody was detected with HRP-conjugated streptavidin and subsequent incubation with TMB detection reagent. Mouse IL-21 was able to block the binding of mIL-21R to AbT nearly completely above 4 ng/ml, indicating that the antibody and the cytokine compete for binding to murine IL-21R (\nFIG. 27\n \na\n).\n\n\nA second assay was performed to demonstrate that antibody AbS binds to the murine IL-21R in a manner that competes with the IL-21 cytokine. Murine IL-21R-Fc was captured on ELISA plates coated with an anti-mouse IgG2a antibody. Plates were blocked with 1% BSA in PBS and washed, and varying concentrations of AbS were added to the plate in the presence of 10 μg/ml mIL-21. The binding of mIL-21 to the receptor was detected by an HRP-conjugated anti-His\n6 \nantibody, and the binding of AbS to the receptor was detected by an anti-human Ig antibody. Concentrations of AbS above approximately 2 μg/ml completely prevented binding of mIL-21 to mIL-21R-Fc, indicating that the antibody and the cytokine compete for binding to murine IL-21R (\nFIG. 27\n \nb\n).\n\n\nExample 9.15\n\n\nInhibition of Rat T Cell Proliferation by Anti-IL-21R Antibodies\n\n\nLewis female rat splenic T cells were purified to 95% CD3\n+\n using Rat T cell Enrichment Columns (RTCC-25; R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Serial dilutions of the anti-human IL-21R antibodies and isotype control protein were made in culture medium (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium containing 10% FCS, L-glutamine, beta-mercaptoethanol, nonessential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, penicillin, streptomycin, and gentamycin) in flat-bottomed 96-well tissue culture plates which had been precoated with 1 μg of anti-rat CD3 antibody (BD Pharmingen Cat#554829), followed by the addition of 5 ng/ml rat IL-21 and 20,000 CD3 T cells per well. The cells were grown for 3 days in a 10% CO\n2\n, 37° C., humidified incubator. For the last 5 hr of culture, cells were labeled with 0.5 μCi of \n3\nH-thymidine (GE Amersham Cat# TRA-120). The plates were harvested onto glass fiber filter mats by a Tomtec Mach III plate harvester and were counted on a Perkin Elmer 1450 Microbeta Counter.\n\n\nThe response of the rat T cells to 5 ng/ml rat IL-21 was 6-fold above the background response to 1 μg of anti-CD3 alone. Antibodies AbS, AbU, AbV, and AbW were able to inhibit the \n3\nH thymidine incorporation stimulated by 5 ng/ml rat IL-21 (57,000 cpm in the absence of antibody treatment; \nFIG. 28\n).

The entire contents of these applications are hereby incorporated by reference in the present application.\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThis invention relates to double-stranded ribonucleic acid (dsRNA), and its use in mediating RNA interference to inhibit the expression of the HAMP gene and the use of the dsRNA to treat pathological processes which can be mediated by down regulating HAMP, such as anemia and other diseases associated with lowered iron levels.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe discovery of the hepcidin peptide and characterisation of its gene, HAMP,\n4 \nhas led to the revision of previous models for the regulation of iron homeostasis and the realisation that the liver plays a key role in determining iron absorption from the gut and iron release from recycling and storage sites. Perhaps the most striking example has been to change the pathogenic model of HFE-related hereditary haemochromatosis from the crypt-programming model centered on the duodenal absorptive enterocyte to the hepcidin model centered on the hepatocyte.\n5,6 \nIn summary, the hepcidin model proposes that the rate of iron efflux into the plasma depends primarily on the plasma level of hepcidin; when iron levels are high the synthesis of hepcidin increases and the release of iron from enterocytes and macrophages is diminished. Conversely when iron stores drop, the synthesis of hepcidin is down-regulated and these cells release more iron.\n\n\nIn order to describe the postulated major role of hepcidin it is necessary to understand the function of ferroportin, a protein first characterised in 2000. Ferroportin is the major iron export protein located on the cell surface of enterocytes, macrophages and hepatocytes, the main cells capable of releasing iron into plasma for transport by transferrin.\n7 \n \n\n\nThe major iron recycling pathway is centered on the degradation of senescent red cells by reticuloendothelial macrophages located in bone marrow, hepatic Kupffer cells and spleen. The exit of iron from these macrophages is controlled by ferroportin. The role of the hepatocyte is central to the action of ferroportin, because the hepatocyte is proposed to sense body iron status and either release or down-regulate hepcidin, which then interacts with ferroportin to modulate the release of cellular iron. Hepcidin directly binds to ferroportin and decreases its functional activity by causing it to be internalized from the cell surface and degraded.\n8 \n \n\n\nIncreased hepcidin synthesis is thought to mediate iron metabolism in two clinically important circumstances, shown schematically in \nFIG. 1\n. In individuals who do not harbour mutations causing haemochromatosis, the hepatocyte is thought to react to either an increase in iron saturation of transferrin or to increased iron stores in hepatocytes themselves, by inducing the synthesis of hepcidin by an as yet unknown mechanism. Thus the physiological response to iron overload under normal circumstances would be the hepcidin mediated shut down of iron absorption (enterocyte), recycling (macrophage) and storage (hepatocyte).\n\n\nThe synthesis and release of hepcidin is also rapidly mediated by bacterial lipopolysaccaride and cytokine release, especially interleukin-6. Thus the hepcidin gene is an acute-phase responsive gene which is overexpressed in response to inflammation. Cytokine mediated induction of hepcidin caused by inflammation or infection is now thought to be responsible for the anaemia of chronic disease, where iron is retained by the key cells that normally provide it, namely enterocytes, macrophages and hepatocytes. Retention of iron leads to the hallmark features of the anaemia of chronic disease, low transferrin saturation, iron-restricted erythropoeisis and mild to moderate anaemia.\n9 \nThe nature of the hepcidin receptor is presently unknown, however an exciting future prospect may be the development of agents to block the receptor with the aim of treating the anaemia of chronic disease, a common often intractable clinical problem.\n\n\nDown-regulation of hepcidin synthesis results in increased iron release, which arises in the two situations shown schematically in \nFIG. 2\n. The main causes of non-HFE haemochromatosis are mutations in either ferroportin, transferrin receptor 2, hepcidin or hemojuvelin genes. Classical HFE haemochromatosis, and all types of non-HFE haemochromatosis thus far studied with the exception of ferroportin related haemochromatosis, are characterised by inappropriate hepcidin deficiency. In these circumstances, hepatocytes become iron loaded, because their uptake of transferrin bound iron from the circulation is assumed to exceed that of ferroportin mediated export. Hepcidin deficiency causes increased ferroportin mediated iron export, resulting in increased enterocyte absorption of iron and perhaps quantitatively more important, enhanced export of recycled iron onto plasma transferrin by macrophages. Hepcidin is also suppressed in thalassaemic syndromes, both β thalassaemia major and intermedia and congenital dyserythropoetic anaemic type 1, where iron absorption is inappropriately stimulated despite the presence of massive iron overload.\n10 \n \n\n\nAs shown in \nFIG. 2\n, anaemia and hypoxia both trigger a decrease in hepcidin levels. These discoveries were made in animal models and need to be further studied to show they are applicable in humans. Two animal models of anaemia in mice were used to demonstrate a dramatic decrease in hepcidin synthesis where anaemia was provoked either by excessive bleeding or haemolysis.\n11 \nThis is postulated to permit the rapid mobilisation of iron from macrophages and enterocytes necessary to allow for the increased erythropoietic activity triggered by erythropoietin release. The same study showed down-regulation of hepcidin synthesis can be triggered by hypoxia alone, and mice housed in hypobaric hypoxia chambers simulating an altitude of 5,500 m also showed a rapid decrease in hepcidin.\n\n\nIn summary, hepcidin provides a unifying hypothesis to explain the behaviour of iron in two diverse but common clinical conditions, the anaemia of chronic disease and both HFE and non-HFE haemochromatosis. The pathophysiology of hepcidin has been sufficiently elucidated to offer promise of therapeutic intervention in both of these situations. Administering either hepcidin or an agonist could treat haemochromatosis, where the secretion of hepcidin is abnormally low.\n\n \n \n1. Park C H, Valore E V, Waring A J, Ganz T.

The gene encoding the iron regulatory peptide hepcidin is regulated by anemia, hypoxia, and inflammation. J Clin Invest. 2002; 110:1037-44.\n \n\n\nThe anemia of inflammation, commonly observed in patients with chronic infections, malignancy, trauma, and inflammatory disorders, is a well-known clinical entity. Until recently, little was understood about its pathogenesis. It now appears that the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 induces production of hepcidin, an iron-regulatory hormone that may be responsible for most or all of the features of this disorder. (Andrews N C. \nJ Clin Invest. \n2004 May 1; 113(9): 1251-1253). As such, down regulation of hepcidin in anemic patients will lead to a reduction in inflammation associated with such anemia.\n\n\nRecently, double-stranded RNA molecules (dsRNA) have been shown to block gene expression in a highly conserved regulatory mechanism known as RNA interference (RNAi). WO 99/32619 (Fire et al.) discloses the use of a dsRNA of at least 25 nucleotides in length to inhibit the expression of genes in \nC. elegans\n. dsRNA has also been shown to degrade target RNA in other organisms, including plants (see, e.g., WO 99/53050, Waterhouse et al.; and WO 99/61631, Heifetz et al.), \nDrosophila \n(see, e.g., Yang, D., et al., \nCurr. Biol\n. (2000) 10: 1191-1200), and mammals (see WO 00/44895, Limmer; and DE 101 00 586.5, Kreutzer et al.). This natural mechanism has now become the focus for the development of a new class of pharmaceutical agents for treating disorders that are caused by the aberrant or unwanted regulation of a gene.\n\n\nDespite significant advances in the field of RNAi and advances in the treatment of pathological processes which can be mediated by down regulating HAMP gene expression, there remains a need for agents that can inhibit HAMP gene expression and that can treat diseases associated with HAMP gene expression such as anemia and other diseases associated with lowered iron levels.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe invention provides a solution to the problem of treating diseases that can be modulated by down regulating the proprotein hepcidin gene/protein (HAMP) by using double-stranded ribonucleic acid (dsRNA) to silence HAMP expression.\n\n\nThe invention provides double-stranded ribonucleic acid (dsRNA), as well as compositions and methods for inhibiting the expression of the HAMP gene in a cell or mammal using such dsRNA. The invention also provides compositions and methods for treating pathological conditions that can modulated by down regulating the expression of the HAMP gene, such as anemia and other diseases associated with lowered iron levels. The dsRNA of the invention comprises an RNA strand (the antisense strand) having a region which is less than 30 nucleotides in length, generally 19-24 nucleotides in length, and is substantially complementary to at least part of an mRNA transcript of the HAMP gene.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the invention provides double-stranded ribonucleic acid (dsRNA) molecules for inhibiting the expression of the HAMP gene. The dsRNA comprises at least two sequences that are complementary to each other. The dsRNA comprises a sense strand comprising a first sequence and an antisense strand comprising a second sequence. The antisense strand comprises a nucleotide sequence which is substantially complementary to at least part of an mRNA encoding HAMP, and the region of complementarity is less than 30 nucleotides in length, generally 19-24 nucleotides in length. The dsRNA, upon contacting with a cell expressing the HAMP, inhibits the expression of the HAMP gene by at least 40%.\n\n\nFor example, the dsRNA molecules of the invention can be comprised of a first sequence of the dsRNA that is selected from the group consisting of the sense sequences of Tables 1 or 3 and the second sequence is selected from the group consisting of the antisense sequences of Tables 1 or 3. The dsRNA molecules of the invention can be comprised of naturally occurring nucleotides or can be comprised of at least one modified nucleotide, such as a 2′-O-methyl modified nucleotide, a nucleotide comprising a 5′-phosphorothioate group, and a terminal nucleotide linked to a cholesteryl derivative. Alternatively, the modified nucleotide may be chosen from the group of: a 2′-deoxy-2′-fluoro modified nucleotide, a 2′-deoxy-modified nucleotide, a locked nucleotide, an abasic nucleotide, 2′-amino-modified nucleotide, 2′-alkyl-modified nucleotide, morpholino nucleotide, a phosphoramidate, and a non-natural base comprising nucleotide. Generally, such modified sequence will be based on a first sequence of said dsRNA selected from the group consisting of the sense sequences of Tables 1 or 3 and a second sequence selected from the group consisting of the antisense sequences of Tables 1 or 3.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the invention provides a cell comprising one of the dsRNAs of the invention. The cell is generally a mammalian cell, such as a human cell.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition for inhibiting the expression of the HAMP gene in an organism, generally a human subject, comprising one or more of the dsRNA of the invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or delivery vehicle. Preferable the carrier or delivery vehicle will be one that selectively targets the siRNA to the liver.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the invention provides a method for inhibiting the expression of the HAMP gene in a cell, comprising the following steps:\n\n \n \n \n \n(a) introducing into the cell a double-stranded ribonucleic acid (dsRNA), wherein the dsRNA comprises at least two sequences that are complementary to each other. The dsRNA comprises a sense strand comprising a first sequence and an antisense strand comprising a second sequence.

The invention also provides compositions and methods for treating pathological conditions and diseases that can be modulated by down regulating the expression of the HAMP gene. dsRNA directs the sequence-specific degradation of mRNA through a process known as RNA interference (RNAi).\n\n\nThe dsRNA of the invention comprises an RNA strand (the antisense strand) having a region which is less than 30 nucleotides in length, generally 19-24 nucleotides in length, and is substantially complementary to at least part of an mRNA transcript of the HAMP gene. The use of these dsRNAs enables the targeted degradation of an mRNA that is involved in sodium transport. Using cell-based and animal assays, the present inventors have demonstrated that very low dosages of these dsRNA can specifically and efficiently mediate RNAi, resulting in significant inhibition of expression of the HAMP gene. Thus, the methods and compositions of the invention comprising these dsRNAs are useful for treating pathological processes which can be mediated by down regulating HAMP, such as in the treatment of anemia and other diseases associated with lowered iron levels.\n\n\nThe following detailed description discloses how to make and use the dsRNA and compositions containing dsRNA to inhibit the expression of the target HAMP gene, as well as compositions and methods for treating diseases that can be modulated by down regulating the expression of HAMP, such as anemia and other diseases associated with lowered iron levels. The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention comprise a dsRNA having an antisense strand comprising a region of complementarity which is less than 30 nucleotides in length, generally 19-24 nucleotides in length, and is substantially complementary to at least part of an RNA transcript of the HAMP gene, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\nAccordingly, certain aspects of the invention provide pharmaceutical compositions comprising the dsRNA of the invention together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, methods of using the compositions to inhibit expression of the HAMP gene, and methods of using the pharmaceutical compositions to treat diseases that can be modulated by down regulating the expression of HAMP.\n\n\nI. Definitions\n\n\nFor convenience, the meaning of certain terms and phrases used in the specification, examples, and appended claims, are provided below. If there is an apparent discrepancy between the usage of a term in other parts of this specification and its definition provided in this section, the definition in this section shall prevail.\n\n\n“G,” “C,” “A” and “U” each generally stand for a nucleotide that contains guanine, cytosine, adenine, and uracil as a base, respectively. However, it will be understood that the term “ribonucleotide” or “nucleotide” can also refer to a modified nucleotide, as further detailed below, or a surrogate replacement moiety. The skilled person is well aware that guanine, cytosine, adenine, and uracil may be replaced by other moieties without substantially altering the base pairing properties of an oligonucleotide comprising a nucleotide bearing such replacement moiety. For example, without limitation, a nucleotide comprising inosine as its base may base pair with nucleotides containing adenine, cytosine, or uracil. Hence, nucleotides containing uracil, guanine, or adenine may be replaced in the nucleotide sequences of the invention by a nucleotide containing, for example, inosine. Sequences comprising such replacement moieties are embodiments of the invention.\n\n\nAs used herein, “HAMP” refers to the hepcidin gene or protein (also known as LEAP). mRNA sequences to HAMP are provided as human: Genbank accession NM\n—\n021175.2.\n\n\nAs used herein, “target sequence” refers to a contiguous portion of the nucleotide sequence of an mRNA molecule formed during the transcription of the HAMP gene, including mRNA that is a product of RNA processing of a primary transcription product.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “strand comprising a sequence” refers to an oligonucleotide comprising a chain of nucleotides that is described by the sequence referred to using the standard nucleotide nomenclature.\n\n\nAs used herein, and unless otherwise indicated, the term “complementary,” when used to describe a first nucleotide sequence in relation to a second nucleotide sequence, refers to the ability of an oligonucleotide or polynucleotide comprising the first nucleotide sequence to hybridize and form a duplex structure under certain conditions with an oligonucleotide or polynucleotide comprising the second nucleotide sequence, as will be understood by the skilled person. Such conditions can, for example, be stringent conditions, where stringent conditions may include: 400 mM NaCl, 40 mM PIPES pH 6.4, 1 mM EDTA, 50° C. or 70° C. for 12-16 hours followed by washing. Other conditions, such as physiologically relevant conditions as may be encountered inside an organism, can apply. The skilled person will be able to determine the set of conditions most appropriate for a test of complementarity of two sequences in accordance with the ultimate application of the hybridized nucleotides.\n\n\nThis includes base-pairing of the oligonucleotide or polynucleotide comprising the first nucleotide sequence to the oligonucleotide or polynucleotide comprising the second nucleotide sequence over the entire length of the first and second nucleotide sequence. Such sequences can be referred to as “fully complementary” with respect to each other herein. However, where a first sequence is referred to as “substantially complementary” with respect to a second sequence herein, the two sequences can be fully complementary, or they may form one or more, but generally not more than 4, 3 or 2 mismatched base pairs upon hybridization, while retaining the ability to hybridize under the conditions most relevant to their ultimate application. However, where two oligonucleotides are designed to form, upon hybridization, one or more single stranded overhangs, such overhangs shall not be regarded as mismatches with regard to the determination of complementarity. For example, a dsRNA comprising one oligonucleotide 21 nucleotides in length and another oligonucleotide 23 nucleotides in length, wherein the longer oligonucleotide comprises a sequence of 21 nucleotides that is fully complementary to the shorter oligonucleotide, may yet be referred to as “fully complementary” for the purposes of the invention.\n\n\n“Complementary” sequences, as used herein, may also include, or be formed entirely from, non-Watson-Crick base pairs and/or base pairs formed from non-natural and modified nucleotides, in as far as the above requirements with respect to their ability to hybridize are fulfilled.\n\n\nThe terms “complementary”, “fully complementary” and “substantially complementary” herein may be used with respect to the base matching between the sense strand and the antisense strand of a dsRNA, or between the antisense strand of a dsRNA and a target sequence, as will be understood from the context of their use.\n\n\nAs used herein, a polynucleotide which is “substantially complementary to at least part of” a messenger RNA (mRNA) refers to a polynucleotide which is substantially complementary to a contiguous portion of the mRNA of interest (e.g., encoding HAMP). For example, a polynucleotide is complementary to at least a part of a HAMP mRNA if the sequence is substantially complementary to a non-interrupted portion of a mRNA encoding HAMP.\n\n\nThe term “double-stranded RNA” or “dsRNA”, as used herein, refers to a complex of ribonucleic acid molecules, having a duplex structure comprising two anti-parallel and substantially complementary, as defined above, nucleic acid strands. The two strands forming the duplex structure may be different portions of one larger RNA molecule, or they may be separate RNA molecules. Where separate RNA molecules, such dsRNA are often referred to in the literature as siRNA (“short interfering RNA”). Where the two strands are part of one larger molecule, and therefore are connected by an uninterrupted chain of nucleotides between the 3′-end of one strand and the 5′ end of the respective other strand forming the duplex structure, the connecting RNA chain is referred to as a “hairpin loop”, “short hairpin RNA” or “shRNA”. Where the two strands are connected covalently by means other than an uninterrupted chain of nucleotides between the 3′-end of one strand and the 5′ end of the respective other strand forming the duplex structure, the connecting structure is referred to as a “linker”. The RNA strands may have the same or a different number of nucleotides. The maximum number of base pairs is the number of nucleotides in the shortest strand of the dsRNA minus any overhangs that are present in the duplex. In addition to the duplex structure, a dsRNA may comprise one or more nucleotide overhangs. In addition, as used in this specification, “dsRNA” may include chemical modifications to ribonucleotides, including substantial modifications at multiple nucleotides and including all types of modifications disclosed herein or known in the art. Any such modifications, as used in an siRNA type molecule, are encompassed by “dsRNA” for the purposes of this specification and claims.\n\n\nAs used herein, a “nucleotide overhang” refers to the unpaired nucleotide or nucleotides that protrude from the duplex structure of a dsRNA when a 3′-end of one strand of the dsRNA extends beyond the 5′-end of the other strand, or vice versa. “Blunt” or “blunt end” means that there are no unpaired nucleotides at that end of the dsRNA, i.e., no nucleotide overhang. A “blunt ended” dsRNA is a dsRNA that is double-stranded over its entire length, i.e., no nucleotide overhang at either end of the molecule. For clarity, chemical caps or non-nucleotide chemical moieties conjugated to the 3′ end or 5′ end of an siRNA are not considered in determining whether an siRNA has an overhang or is blunt ended.\n\n\nThe term “antisense strand” refers to the strand of a dsRNA which includes a region that is substantially complementary to a target sequence. As used herein, the term “region of complementarity” refers to the region on the antisense strand that is substantially complementary to a sequence, for example a target sequence, as defined herein. Where the region of complementarity is not fully complementary to the target sequence, the mismatches are most tolerated in the terminal regions and, if present, are generally in a terminal region or regions, e.g., within 6, 5, 4, 3, or 2 nucleotides of the 5′ and/or 3′ terminus.\n\n\nThe term “sense strand,” as used herein, refers to the strand of a dsRNA that includes a region that is substantially complementary to a region of the antisense strand.\n\n\n“Introducing into a cell”, when referring to a dsRNA, means facilitating uptake or absorption into the cell, as is understood by those skilled in the art. Absorption or uptake of dsRNA can occur through unaided diffusive or active cellular processes, or by auxiliary agents or devices. The meaning of this term is not limited to cells in vitro; a dsRNA may also be “introduced into a cell”, wherein the cell is part of a living organism. In such instance, introduction into the cell will include the delivery to the organism. For example, for in vivo delivery, dsRNA can be injected into a tissue site or administered systemically. In vitro introduction into a cell includes methods known in the art such as electroporation and lipofection.\n\n\nThe terms “silence” and “inhibit the expression of”, in as far as they refer to the HAMP gene, herein refer to the at least partial suppression of the expression of the HAMP gene, as manifested by a reduction of the amount of mRNA transcribed from the HAMP gene which may be isolated from a first cell or group of cells in which the HAMP gene is transcribed and which has or have been treated such that the expression of the HAMP gene is inhibited, as compared to a second cell or group of cells substantially identical to the first cell or group of cells but which has or have not been so treated (control cells). The degree of inhibition is usually expressed in terms of\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\nmRNA\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\nin\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\ncontrol\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\ncells\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\nmRNA\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\nin\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\ntreated\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\ncells\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\nmRNA\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\nin\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\ncontrol\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\ncells\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n·\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, the degree of inhibition may be given in terms of a reduction of a parameter that is functionally linked to HAMP gene transcription, e.g. the amount of protein encoded by the HAMP gene which is secreted by a cell, or the number of cells displaying a certain phenotype, e.g apoptosis. In principle, HAMP gene silencing may be determined in any cell expressing the target, either constitutively or by genomic engineering, and by any appropriate assay. However, when a reference is needed in order to determine whether a given dsRNA inhibits the expression of the HAMP gene by a certain degree and therefore is encompassed by the instant invention, the assay provided in the Examples below shall serve as such reference.\n\n\nFor example, in certain instances, expression of the HAMP gene is suppressed by at least about 20%, 25%, 35%, or 50% by administration of the double-stranded oligonucleotide of the invention. In some embodiments, the HAMP gene is suppressed by at least about 60%, 70%, or 80% by administration of the double-stranded oligonucleotide of the invention. In some embodiments, the HAMP gene is suppressed by at least about 85%, 90%, or 95% by administration of the double-stranded oligonucleotide of the invention. Table 2 provides a wide range of values for inhibition of expression obtained in an in vitro assay using various HAMP dsRNA molecules at various concentrations.\n\n\nAs used herein in the context of HAMP expression, the terms “treat”, “treatment”, and the like, refer to relief from or alleviation of pathological processes which can be mediated by down regulating the HAMP gene. In the context of the present invention insofar as it relates to any of the other conditions recited herein below (other than pathological processes which can be mediated by down regulating the HAMP gene), the terms “treat”, “treatment”, and the like mean to relieve or alleviate at least one symptom associated with such condition, or to slow or reverse the progression of such condition. For example, in the context of anemia and other diseases associated with lowered iron levels, treatment will involve an increase in serum iron levels. Example patient populations that can benefit from such a treatment include, but are not limited to, individuals having anemia as a result of chronic renal failure, cancer patients, patients with chronic inflammatory disease as well as patients with chronic GI bleeding, such as with chronic ulcers or colon tumors.\n\n\nAs used herein, the phrases “therapeutically effective amount” and “prophylactically effective amount” refer to an amount that provides a therapeutic benefit in the treatment, prevention, or management of pathological processes which can be mediated by down regulating the HAMP gene on or an overt symptom of pathological processes which can be mediated by down regulating the HAMP gene. The specific amount that is therapeutically effective can be readily determined by ordinary medical practitioner, and may vary depending on factors known in the art, such as, e.g. the type of pathological processes which can be mediated by down regulating the HAMP gene, the patient's history and age, the stage of pathological processes which can be mediated by down regulating HAMP gene expression, and the administration of other anti-pathological processes which can be mediated by down regulating HAMP gene expression.\n\n\nAs used herein, a “pharmaceutical composition” comprises a pharmacologically effective amount of a dsRNA and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used herein, “pharmacologically effective amount,” “therapeutically effective amount” or simply “effective amount” refers to that amount of an RNA effective to produce the intended pharmacological, therapeutic or preventive result. For example, if a given clinical treatment is considered effective when there is at least a 25% reduction in a measurable parameter associated with a disease or disorder, a therapeutically effective amount of a drug for the treatment of that disease or disorder is the amount necessary to effect at least a 25% reduction in that parameter.\n\n\nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” refers to a carrier for administration of a therapeutic agent. Such carriers include, but are not limited to, saline, buffered saline, dextrose, water, glycerol, ethanol, and combinations thereof and are described in more detail below. The term specifically excludes cell culture medium.\n\n\nAs used herein, a “transformed cell” is a cell into which a vector has been introduced from which a dsRNA molecule may be expressed.\n\n\nII. Double-Stranded Ribonucleic Acid (dsRNA)\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the invention provides double-stranded ribonucleic acid (dsRNA) molecules for inhibiting the expression of the HAMP gene in a cell or mammal, wherein the dsRNA comprises an antisense strand comprising a region of complementarity which is complementary to at least a part of an mRNA formed in the expression of the HAMP gene, and wherein the region of complementarity is less than 30 nucleotides in length, generally 19-24 nucleotides in length, and wherein said dsRNA, upon contact with a cell expressing said HAMP gene, inhibits the expression of said HAMP gene by at least 40%. The dsRNA comprises two RNA strands that are sufficiently complementary to hybridize to form a duplex structure. One strand of the dsRNA (the antisense strand) comprises a region of complementarity that is substantially complementary, and generally fully complementary, to a target sequence, derived from the sequence of an mRNA formed during the expression of the HAMP gene, the other strand (the sense strand) comprises a region which is complementary to the antisense strand, such that the two strands hybridize and form a duplex structure when combined under suitable conditions. Generally, the duplex structure is between 15 and 30, more generally between 18 and 25, yet more generally between 19 and 24, and most generally between 19 and 21 base pairs in length. Similarly, the region of complementarity to the target sequence is between 15 and 30, more generally between 18 and 25, yet more generally between 19 and 24, and most generally between 19 and 21 nucleotides in length. The dsRNA of the invention may further comprise one or more single-stranded nucleotide overhang(s). The dsRNA can be synthesized by standard methods known in the art as further discussed below, e.g., by use of an automated DNA synthesizer, such as are commercially available from, for example, Biosearch, Applied Biosystems, Inc. In a preferred embodiment, the HAMP gene is the human HAMP gene. In specific embodiments, the antisense strand of the dsRNA comprises a strand selected from the sense sequences of Tables 1 or 3 and a second sequence selected from the group consisting of the antisense sequences of Tables 1 or 3. Alternative antisense agents that target elsewhere in the target sequence provided in Tables 1 or 3 can readily be determined using the target sequence and the flanking HAMP sequence.\n\n\nIn further embodiments, the dsRNA comprises at least one nucleotide sequence selected from the groups of sequences provided in Tables 1 or 3. In other embodiments, the dsRNA comprises at least two sequences selected from this group, wherein one of the at least two sequences is complementary to another of the at least two sequences, and one of the at least two sequences is substantially complementary to a sequence of an mRNA generated in the expression of the HAMP gene. Generally, the dsRNA comprises two oligonucleotides, wherein one oligonucleotide is described as the sense strand in Tables 1 or 3 and the second oligonucleotide is described as the antisense strand in Tables 1 or 3\n\n\nThe skilled person is well aware that dsRNAs comprising a duplex structure of between 20 and 23, but specifically 21, base pairs have been hailed as particularly effective in inducing RNA interference (Elbashir et al., EMBO 2001, 20:6877-6888). However, others have found that shorter or longer dsRNAs can be effective as well. In the embodiments described above, by virtue of the nature of the oligonucleotide sequences provided in Tables 1 or 3, the dsRNAs of the invention can comprise at least one strand of a length of minimally 21 nt. It can be reasonably expected that shorter dsRNAs comprising one of the sequences of Tables 1 or 3 minus only a few nucleotides on one or both ends may be similarly effective as compared to the dsRNAs described above. Hence, dsRNAs comprising a partial sequence of at least 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, or more contiguous nucleotides from one of the sequences of Tables 1 or 3, and differing in their ability to inhibit the expression of the HAMP gene in a FACS assay as described herein below by not more than 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, or 30% inhibition from a dsRNA comprising the full sequence, are contemplated by the invention. Further dsRNAs that cleave within the target sequence provided in Tables 1 or 3 can readily be made using the HAMP sequence and the target sequence provided.\n\n\nIn addition, the RNAi agents provided in Table 1 identify a site in the HAMP mRNA that is susceptible to RNAi based cleavage. As such the present invention further includes RNAi agents that target within the sequence targeted by one of the agents of the present invention. As used herein a second RNAi agent is said to target within the sequence of a first RNAi agent if the second RNAi agent cleaves the message anywhere within the mRNA that is complementary to the antisense strand of the first RNAi agent. Such a second agent will generally consist of at least 15 contiguous nucleotides from one of the sequences provided in Table 1 coupled to additional nucleotide sequences taken from the region contiguous to the selected sequence in the HAMP gene. For example, the last 15 nucleotides of SEQ ID NO:1 (minus the added AA sequences) combined with the next 6 nucleotides from the target HAMP gene produces a single strand agent of 21 nucleotides that is based on one of the sequences provided in Table 1.\n\n\nThe dsRNA of the invention can contain one or more mismatches to the target sequence. In a preferred embodiment, the dsRNA of the invention contains no more than 3 mismatches. If the antisense strand of the dsRNA contains mismatches to a target sequence, it is preferable that the area of mismatch not be located in the center of the region of complementarity. If the antisense strand of the dsRNA contains mismatches to the target sequence, it is preferable that the mismatch be restricted to 5 nucleotides from either end, for example 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 nucleotide from either the 5′ or 3′ end of the region of complementarity. For example, for a 23 nucleotide dsRNA strand which is complementary to a region of the HAMP gene, the dsRNA generally does not contain any mismatch within the central 13 nucleotides. The methods described within the invention can be used to determine whether a dsRNA containing a mismatch to a target sequence is effective in inhibiting the expression of the HAMP gene. Consideration of the efficacy of dsRNAs with mismatches in inhibiting expression of the HAMP gene is important, especially if the particular region of complementarity in the HAMP gene is known to have polymorphic sequence variation within the population.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, at least one end of the dsRNA has a single-stranded nucleotide overhang of 1 to 4, generally 1 or 2 nucleotides. dsRNAs having at least one nucleotide overhang have unexpectedly superior inhibitory properties than their blunt-ended counterparts. Moreover, the present inventors have discovered that the presence of only one nucleotide overhang strengthens the interference activity of the dsRNA, without affecting its overall stability. dsRNA having only one overhang has proven particularly stable and effective in vivo, as well as in a variety of cells, cell culture mediums, blood, and serum. Generally, the single-stranded overhang is located at the 3′-terminal end of the antisense strand or, alternatively, at the 3′-terminal end of the sense strand. The dsRNA may also have a blunt end, generally located at the 5′-end of the antisense strand. Such dsRNAs have improved stability and inhibitory activity, thus allowing administration at low dosages, i.e., less than 5 mg/kg body weight of the recipient per day. Generally, the antisense strand of the dsRNA has a nucleotide overhang at the 3′-end, and the 5′-end is blunt. In another embodiment, one or more of the nucleotides in the overhang is replaced with a nucleoside thiophosphate.\n\n\nIn yet another embodiment, the dsRNA is chemically modified to enhance stability. The nucleic acids of the invention may be synthesized and/or modified by methods well established in the art, such as those described in “Current protocols in nucleic acid chemistry”, Beaucage, S. L. et al. (Edrs.), John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, N.Y., USA, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. Chemical modifications may include, but are not limited to 2′ modifications, modifications at other sites of the sugar or base of an oligonucleotide, introduction of non-natural bases into the olibonucleotide chain, covalent attachment to a ligand or chemical moiety, and replacement of internucleotide phosphate linkages with alternate linkages such as thiophosphates. More than one such modification may be employed.\n\n\nChemical linking of the two separate dsRNA strands may be achieved by any of a variety of well-known techniques, for example by introducing covalent, ionic or hydrogen bonds; hydrophobic interactions, van der Waals or stacking interactions; by means of metal-ion coordination, or through use of purine analogues. Generally, the chemical groups that can be used to modify the dsRNA include, without limitation, methylene blue; bifunctional groups, generally bis-(2-chloroethyl)amine; N-acetyl-N′-(p-glyoxylbenzoyl)cystamine; 4-thiouracil; and psoralen. In one embodiment, the linker is a hexa-ethylene glycol linker. In this case, the dsRNA are produced by solid phase synthesis and the hexa-ethylene glycol linker is incorporated according to standard methods (e.g., Williams, D. J., and K. B. Hall, \nBiochem\n. (1996) 35:14665-14670). In a particular embodiment, the 5′-end of the antisense strand and the 3′-end of the sense strand are chemically linked via a hexaethylene glycol linker. In another embodiment, at least one nucleotide of the dsRNA comprises a phosphorothioate or phosphorodithioate groups. The chemical bond at the ends of the dsRNA is generally formed by triple-helix bonds. Table 1 provides examples of modified RNAi agents of the invention.\n\n\nIn yet another embodiment, the nucleotides at one or both of the two single strands may be modified to prevent or inhibit the degradation activities of cellular enzymes, such as, for example, without limitation, certain nucleases. Techniques for inhibiting the degradation activity of cellular enzymes against nucleic acids are known in the art including, but not limited to, 2′-amino modifications, 2′-amino sugar modifications, 2′-F sugar modifications, 2′-F modifications, 2′-alkyl sugar modifications, uncharged backbone modifications, morpholino modifications, 2′-O-methyl modifications, and phosphoramidate (see, e.g., Wagner, \nNat. Med\n. (1995) 1:1116-8). Thus, at least one 2′-hydroxyl group of the nucleotides on a dsRNA is replaced by a chemical group, generally by a 2′-amino or a 2′-methyl group. Also, at least one nucleotide may be modified to form a locked nucleotide. Such locked nucleotide contains a methylene bridge that connects the 2′-oxygen of ribose with the 4′-carbon of ribose. Oligonucleotides containing the locked nucleotide are described in Koshkin, A. A., et al., \nTetrahedron \n(1998), 54: 3607-3630) and Obika, S. et al., \nTetrahedron Lett\n. (1998), 39: 5401-5404). Introduction of a locked nucleotide into an oligonucleotide improves the affinity for complementary sequences and increases the melting temperature by several degrees (Braasch, D. A. and D. R. Corey, \nChem. Biol\n. (2001), 8:1-7).\n\n\nConjugating a ligand to a dsRNA can enhance its cellular absorption as well as targeting to a particular tissue or uptake by specific types of cells such as liver cells. In certain instances, a hydrophobic ligand is conjugated to the dsRNA to facilitate direct permeation of the cellular membrane and or uptake across the liver cells. Alternatively, the ligand conjugated to the dsRNA is a substrate for receptor-mediated endocytosis. These approaches have been used to facilitate cell permeation of antisense oligonucleotides as well as dsRNA agents. For example, cholesterol has been conjugated to various antisense oligonucleotides resulting in compounds that are substantially more active compared to their non-conjugated analogs. See M. Manoharan \nAntisense \n& \nNucleic Acid Drug Development \n2002, 12, 103. Other lipophilic compounds that have been conjugated to oligonucleotides include 1-pyrene butyric acid, 1,3-bis-O-(hexadecyl)glycerol, and menthol. One example of a ligand for receptor-mediated endocytosis is folic acid. Folic acid enters the cell by folate-receptor-mediated endocytosis. dsRNA compounds bearing folic acid would be efficiently transported into the cell via the folate-receptor-mediated endocytosis. Li and coworkers report that attachment of folic acid to the 3′-terminus of an oligonucleotide resulted in an 8-fold increase in cellular uptake of the oligonucleotide. Li, S.; Deshmukh, H. M.; Huang, L. \nPharm. Res. \n1998, 15, 1540. Other ligands that have been conjugated to oligonucleotides include polyethylene glycols, carbohydrate clusters, cross-linking agents, porphyrin conjugates, delivery peptides and lipids such as cholesterol.\n\n\nIn certain instances, conjugation of a cationic ligand to oligonucleotides results in improved resistance to nucleases. Representative examples of cationic ligands are propylammonium and dimethylpropylammonium. Interestingly, antisense oligonucleotides were reported to retain their high binding affinity to mRNA when the cationic ligand was dispersed throughout the oligonucleotide. See M. Manoharan \nAntisense \n& \nNucleic Acid Drug Development \n2002, 12, 103 and references therein.\n\n\nThe ligand-conjugated dsRNA of the invention may be synthesized by the use of a dsRNA that bears a pendant reactive functionality, such as that derived from the attachment of a linking molecule onto the dsRNA. This reactive oligonucleotide may be reacted directly with commercially-available ligands, ligands that are synthesized bearing any of a variety of protecting groups, or ligands that have a linking moiety attached thereto. The methods of the invention facilitate the synthesis of ligand-conjugated dsRNA by the use of, in some preferred embodiments, nucleoside monomers that have been appropriately conjugated with ligands and that may further be attached to a solid-support material. Such ligand-nucleoside conjugates, optionally attached to a solid-support material, are prepared according to some preferred embodiments of the methods of the invention via reaction of a selected serum-binding ligand with a linking moiety located on the 5′ position of a nucleoside or oligonucleotide. In certain instances, an dsRNA bearing an aralkyl ligand attached to the 3′-terminus of the dsRNA is prepared by first covalently attaching a monomer building block to a controlled-pore-glass support via a long-chain aminoalkyl group. Then, nucleotides are bonded via standard solid-phase synthesis techniques to the monomer building-block bound to the solid support. The monomer building block may be a nucleoside or other organic compound that is compatible with solid-phase synthesis.\n\n\nThe dsRNA used in the conjugates of the invention may be conveniently and routinely made through the well-known technique of solid-phase synthesis. Equipment for such synthesis is sold by several vendors including, for example, Applied Biosystems (Foster City, Calif.). Any other means for such synthesis known in the art may additionally or alternatively be employed. It is also known to use similar techniques to prepare other oligonucleotides, such as the phosphorothioates and alkylated derivatives.\n\n\nTeachings regarding the synthesis of particular modified oligonucleotides may be found in the following U.S. patents: U.S. Pat.

Oligonucleotide conjugates bearing a variety of molecules such as steroids, vitamins, lipids and reporter molecules, has previously been described (see Manoharan et al., PCT Application WO 93/07883). In a preferred embodiment, the oligonucleotides or linked nucleosides of the invention are synthesized by an automated synthesizer using phosphoramidites derived from ligand-nucleoside conjugates in addition to the standard phosphoramidites and non-standard phosphoramidites that are commercially available and routinely used in oligonucleotide synthesis.\n\n\nThe incorporation of a 2′-O-methyl, 2′-O-ethyl, 2′-O-propyl, 2′-O-allyl, 2′-O-aminoalkyl or 2′-deoxy-2′-fluoro group in nucleosides of an oligonucleotide confers enhanced hybridization properties to the oligonucleotide. Further, oligonucleotides containing phosphorothioate backbones have enhanced nuclease stability. Thus, functionalized, linked nucleosides of the invention can be augmented to include either or both a phosphorothioate backbone or a 2′-O-methyl, 2′-O-ethyl, 2′-O-propyl, 2′-O-aminoalkyl, 2′-O-allyl or 2′-deoxy-2′-fluoro group. A summary listing of some of the oligonucleotide modifications known in the art is found at, for example, PCT Publication WO 200370918.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, functionalized nucleoside sequences of the invention possessing an amino group at the 5′-terminus are prepared using a DNA synthesizer, and then reacted with an active ester derivative of a selected ligand. Active ester derivatives are well known to those skilled in the art. Representative active esters include N-hydrosuccinimide esters, tetrafluorophenolic esters, pentafluorophenolic esters and pentachlorophenolic esters. The reaction of the amino group and the active ester produces an oligonucleotide in which the selected ligand is attached to the 5′-position through a linking group. The amino group at the 5′-terminus can be prepared utilizing a 5′-Amino-Modifier C6 reagent. In one embodiment, ligand molecules may be conjugated to oligonucleotides at the 5′-position by the use of a ligand-nucleoside phosphoramidite wherein the ligand is linked to the 5′-hydroxy group directly or indirectly via a linker. Such ligand-nucleoside phosphoramidites are typically used at the end of an automated synthesis procedure to provide a ligand-conjugated oligonucleotide bearing the ligand at the 5′-terminus.\n\n\nExamples of modified internucleoside linkages or backbones include, for example, phosphorothioates, chiral phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates, phosphotriesters, aminoalkylphosphotriesters, methyl and other alkyl phosphonates including 3′-alkylene phosphonates and chiral phosphonates, phosphinates, phosphoramidates including 3′-amino phosphoramidate and aminoalkylphosphoramidates, thionophosphoramidates, thionoalkylphosphonates, thionoalkylphosphotriesters, and boranophosphates having normal 3′-5′ linkages, 2′-5′ linked analogs of these, and those having inverted polarity wherein the adjacent pairs of nucleoside units are linked 3′-5′ to 5′-3′ or 2′-5′ to 5′-2′. Various salts, mixed salts and free-acid forms are also included.\n\n\nRepresentative United States patents relating to the preparation of the above phosphorus-atom-containing linkages include, but are not limited to, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,687,808; 4,469,863; 4,476,301; 5,023,243; 5,177,196; 5,188,897; 5,264,423; 5,276,019; 5,278,302; 5,286,717; 5,321,131; 5,399,676; 5,405,939; 5,453,496; 5,455,233; 5,466,677; 5,476,925; 5,519,126; 5,536,821; 5,541,306; 5,550,111; 5,563,253; 5,571,799; 5,587,361; 5,625,050; and 5,697,248, each of which is herein incorporated by reference.\n\n\nExamples of modified internucleoside linkages or backbones that do not include a phosphorus atom therein (i.e., oligonucleosides) have backbones that are formed by short chain alkyl or cycloalkyl intersugar linkages, mixed heteroatom and alkyl or cycloalkyl intersugar linkages, or one or more short chain heteroatomic or heterocyclic intersugar linkages. These include those having morpholino linkages (formed in part from the sugar portion of a nucleoside); siloxane backbones; sulfide, sulfoxide and sulfone backbones; formacetyl and thioformacetyl backbones; methylene formacetyl and thioformacetyl backbones; alkene containing backbones; sulfamate backbones; methyleneimino and methylenehydrazino backbones; sulfonate and sulfonamide backbones; amide backbones; and others having mixed N, O, S and CH\n2 \ncomponent parts.\n\n\nRepresentative United States patents relating to the preparation of the above oligonucleosides include, but are not limited to, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,034,506; 5,166,315; 5,185,444; 5,214,134; 5,216,141; 5,235,033; 5,264,562; 5,264,564; 5,405,938; 5,434,257; 5,466,677; 5,470,967; 5,489,677; 5,541,307; 5,561,225; 5,596,086; 5,602,240; 5,610,289; 5,602,240; 5,608,046; 5,610,289; 5,618,704; 5,623,070; 5,663,312; 5,633,360; 5,677,437; and 5,677,439, each of which is herein incorporated by reference.\n\n\nIn certain instances, the oligonucleotide may be modified by a non-ligand group. A number of non-ligand molecules have been conjugated to oligonucleotides in order to enhance the activity, cellular distribution or cellular uptake of the oligonucleotide, and procedures for performing such conjugations are available in the scientific literature. Such non-ligand moieties have included lipid moieties, such as cholesterol (Letsinger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1989, 86:6553), cholic acid (Manoharan et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 1994, 4:1053), a thioether, e.g., hexyl-S-tritylthiol (Manoharan et al., Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci., 1992, 660:306; Manoharan et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Let., 1993, 3:2765), a thiocholesterol (Oberhauser et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 1992, 20:533), an aliphatic chain, e.g., dodecandiol or undecyl residues (Saison-Behmoaras et al., EMBO J., 1991, 10:111; Kabanov et al., FEBS Lett., 1990, 259:327; Svinarchuk et al., Biochimie, 1993, 75:49), a phospholipid, e.g., di-hexadecyl-rac-glycerol or triethylammonium 1,2-di-O-hexadecyl-rac-glycero-3-H-phosphonate (Manoharan et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1995, 36:3651; Shea et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 1990, 18:3777), a polyamine or a polyethylene glycol chain (Manoharan et al., Nucleosides & Nucleotides, 1995, 14:969), or adamantane acetic acid (Manoharan et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1995, 36:3651), a palmityl moiety (Mishra et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 1995, 1264:229), or an octadecylamine or hexylamino-carbonyl-oxycholesterol moiety (Crooke et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 1996, 277:923). Representative United States patents that teach the preparation of such oligonucleotide conjugates have been listed above. Typical conjugation protocols involve the synthesis of oligonucleotides bearing an aminolinker at one or more positions of the sequence. The amino group is then reacted with the molecule being conjugated using appropriate coupling or activating reagents. The conjugation reaction may be performed either with the oligonucleotide still bound to the solid support or following cleavage of the oligonucleotide in solution phase. Purification of the oligonucleotide conjugate by HPLC typically affords the pure conjugate. The use of a cholesterol conjugate is particularly preferred since such a moiety can increase targeting liver cells, a site of HAMP expression.\n\n\nVector Encoded RNAi Agents\n\n\nThe dsRNA of the invention can also be expressed from recombinant viral vectors intracellularly in vivo. The recombinant viral vectors of the invention comprise sequences encoding the dsRNA of the invention and any suitable promoter for expressing the dsRNA sequences. Suitable promoters include, for example, the U6 or H1 RNA pol III promoter sequences and the cytomegalovirus promoter. Selection of other suitable promoters is within the skill in the art. The recombinant viral vectors of the invention can also comprise inducible or regulatable promoters for expression of the dsRNA in a particular tissue or in a particular intracellular environment. The use of recombinant viral vectors to deliver dsRNA of the invention to cells in vivo is discussed in more detail below.\n\n\ndsRNA of the invention can be expressed from a recombinant viral vector either as two separate, complementary RNA molecules, or as a single RNA molecule with two complementary regions.\n\n\nAny viral vector capable of accepting the coding sequences for the dsRNA molecule(s) to be expressed can be used, for example vectors derived from adenovirus (AV); adeno-associated virus (AAV); retroviruses (e.g, lentiviruses (LV), Rhabdoviruses, murine leukemia virus); herpes virus, and the like. The tropism of viral vectors can be modified by pseudotyping the vectors with envelope proteins or other surface antigens from other viruses, or by substituting different viral capsid proteins, as appropriate.\n\n\nFor example, lentiviral vectors of the invention can be pseudotyped with surface proteins from vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), rabies, Ebola, Mokola, and the like. AAV vectors of the invention can be made to target different cells by engineering the vectors to express different capsid protein serotypes. For example, an AAV vector expressing a serotype 2 capsid on a serotype 2 genome is called AAV 2/2. This serotype 2 capsid gene in the AAV 2/2 vector can be replaced by a serotype 5 capsid gene to produce an AAV 2/5 vector. Techniques for constructing AAV vectors which express different capsid protein serotypes are within the skill in the art; see, e.g., Rabinowitz J E et al. (2002), J Virol 76:791-801, the entire disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference.\n\n\nSelection of recombinant viral vectors suitable for use in the invention, methods for inserting nucleic acid sequences for expressing the dsRNA into the vector, and methods of delivering the viral vector to the cells of interest are within the skill in the art. See, for example, Dornburg R (1995), Gene Therap. 2: 301-310; Eglitis M A (1988), Biotechniques 6: 608-614; Miller A D (1990), Hum Gene Therap. 1: 5-14; Anderson W F (1998), Nature 392: 25-30; and Rubinson D A et al., Nat. Genet. 33: 401-406, the entire disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference.\n\n\nPreferred viral vectors are those derived from AV and AAV. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the dsRNA of the invention is expressed as two separate, complementary single-stranded RNA molecules from a recombinant AAV vector comprising, for example, either the U6 or H1 RNA promoters, or the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter.\n\n\nA suitable AV vector for expressing the dsRNA of the invention, a method for constructing the recombinant AV vector, and a method for delivering the vector into target cells, are described in Xia H et al. (2002), Nat. Biotech. 20: 1006-1010.\n\n\nSuitable AAV vectors for expressing the dsRNA of the invention, methods for constructing the recombinant AV vector, and methods for delivering the vectors into target cells are described in Samulski R et al. (1987), J. Virol. 61: 3096-3101; Fisher K J et al. (1996), J. Virol, 70: 520-532; Samulski R et al. (1989), J. Virol. 63: 3822-3826; U.S. Pat. No. 5,252,479; U.S. Pat. No. 5,139,941; International Patent Application No. WO 94/13788; and International Patent Application No. WO 93/24641, the entire disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference.\n\n\nIII. Pharmaceutical Compositions Comprising  dsRNA\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the invention provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a dsRNA, as described herein, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The pharmaceutical composition comprising the dsRNA is useful for treating a disease or disorder associated with the expression or activity of the HAMP gene, such as pathological processes which can be mediated by down regulating HAMP gene expression, such as anemia and other diseases associated with lowered iron levels. Such pharmaceutical compositions are formulated based on the mode of delivery. One example is compositions that are formulated for delivery to the liver via parenteral delivery.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are administered in dosages sufficient to inhibit expression of the HAMP gene. The present inventors have found that, because of their improved efficiency, compositions comprising the dsRNA of the invention can be administered at surprisingly low dosages. A dosage of 5 mg dsRNA per kilogram body weight of recipient per day is sufficient to inhibit or suppress expression of the HAMP gene and may be administered systemically to the patient.\n\n\nIn general, a suitable dose of dsRNA will be in the range of 0.01 to 5.0 milligrams per kilogram body weight of the recipient per day, generally in the range of 1 microgram to 1 mg per kilogram body weight per day. The pharmaceutical composition may be administered once daily, or the dsRNA may be administered as two, three, or more sub-doses at appropriate intervals throughout the day or even using continuous infusion or delivery through a controlled release formulation. In that case, the dsRNA contained in each sub-dose must be correspondingly smaller in order to achieve the total daily dosage. The dosage unit can also be compounded for delivery over several days, e.g., using a conventional sustained release formulation which provides sustained release of the dsRNA over a several day period. Sustained release formulations are well known in the art.\n\n\nThe skilled artisan will appreciate that certain factors may influence the dosage and timing required to effectively treat a subject, including but not limited to the severity of the disease or disorder, previous treatments, the general health and/or age of the subject, and other diseases present. Moreover, treatment of a subject with a therapeutically effective amount of a composition can include a single treatment or a series of treatments. Estimates of effective dosages and in vivo half-lives for the individual dsRNAs encompassed by the invention can be made using conventional methodologies or on the basis of in vivo testing using an appropriate animal model, as described elsewhere herein.\n\n\nAdvances in mouse genetics have generated a number of mouse models for the study of various human diseases, such as pathological processes which can be mediated by down regulating HAMP gene expression. Such models are used for in vivo testing of dsRNA, as well as for determining a therapeutically effective dose.\n\n\nAny method can be used to administer a dsRNA of the present invention to a mammal. For example, administration can be direct; oral; or parenteral (e.g., by subcutaneous, intraventricular, intramuscular, or intraperitoneal injection, or by intravenous drip). Administration can be rapid (e.g., by injection), or can occur over a period of time (e.g., by slow infusion or administration of slow release formulations).\n\n\nTypically, when treating a mammal with anemia and other diseases associated with lowered iron levels, the dsRNA molecules are administered systemically via parental means. For example, dsRNAs, conjugated or unconjugate or formulated with or without liposomes, can be administered intravenously to a patient. For such, a dsRNA molecule can be formulated into compositions such as sterile and non-sterile aqueous solutions, non-aqueous solutions in common solvents such as alcohols, or solutions in liquid or solid oil bases. Such solutions also can contain buffers, diluents, and other suitable additives. For parenteral, intrathecal, or intraventricular administration, a dsRNA molecule can be formulated into compositions such as sterile aqueous solutions, which also can contain buffers, diluents, and other suitable additives (e.g., penetration enhancers, carrier compounds, and other pharmaceutically acceptable carriers).\n\n\nIn addition, dsRNA molecules can be administered to a mammal as biologic or abiologic means as described in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,271,359. Abiologic delivery can be accomplished by a variety of methods including, without limitation, (1) loading liposomes with a dsRNA acid molecule provided herein and (2) complexing a dsRNA molecule with lipids or liposomes to form nucleic acid-lipid or nucleic acid-liposome complexes. The liposome can be composed of cationic and neutral lipids commonly used to transfect cells in vitro. Cationic lipids can complex (e.g., charge-associate) with negatively charged nucleic acids to form liposomes. Examples of cationic liposomes include, without limitation, lipofectin, lipofectamine, lipofectace, and DOTAP. Procedures for forming liposomes are well known in the art. Liposome compositions can be formed, for example, from phosphatidylcholine, dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine, dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine, dimyristoyl phosphatidylglycerol, or dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine. Numerous lipophilic agents are commercially available, including Lipofectin® (Invitrogen/Life Technologies, Carlsbad, Calif.) and Effectene™ (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif.). In addition, systemic delivery methods can be optimized using commercially available cationic lipids such as DDAB or DOTAP, each of which can be mixed with a neutral lipid such as DOPE or cholesterol. In some cases, liposomes such as those described by Templeton et al. (Nature Biotechnology, 15: 647-652 (1997)) can be used. In other embodiments, polycations such as polyethyleneimine can be used to achieve delivery in vivo and ex vivo (Boletta et al., J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 7: 1728 (1996)). Additional information regarding the use of liposomes to deliver nucleic acids can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 6,271,359, PCT Publication WO 96/40964 and Morrissey, D. et al. 2005. Nat. Biotechnol. 23(8):1002-7.\n\n\nBiologic delivery can be accomplished by a variety of methods including, without limitation, the use of viral vectors. For example, viral vectors (e.g., adenovirus and herpesvirus vectors) can be used to deliver dsRNA molecules to liver cells. Standard molecular biology techniques can be used to introduce one or more of the dsRNAs provided herein into one of the many different viral vectors previously developed to deliver nucleic acid to cells. These resulting viral vectors can be used to deliver the one or more dsRNAs to cells by, for example, infection.\n\n\ndsRNAs of the present invention can be formulated in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. A “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” (also referred to herein as an “excipient”) is a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent, suspending agent, or any other pharmacologically inert vehicle. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can be liquid or solid, and can be selected with the planned manner of administration in mind so as to provide for the desired bulk, consistency, and other pertinent transport and chemical properties. Typical pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include, by way of example and not limitation: water; saline solution; binding agents (e.g., polyvinylpyrrolidone or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose); fillers (e.g., lactose and other sugars, gelatin, or calcium sulfate); lubricants (e.g., starch, polyethylene glycol, or sodium acetate); disintegrates (e.g., starch or sodium starch glycolate); and wetting agents (e.g., sodium lauryl sulfate).\n\n\nIn addition, dsRNA that target the HAMP gene can be formulated into compositions containing the dsRNA admixed, encapsulated, conjugated, or otherwise associated with other molecules, molecular structures, or mixtures of nucleic acids. For example, a composition containing one or more dsRNA agents that target the HAMP gene can contain other therapeutic agents such as other lipid lowering agents (e.g., statins).\n\n\nMethods for Treating Diseases that can be Modulated by Down Regulating the Expression of HAMP\n\n\nThe methods and compositions described herein can be used to treat diseases and conditions that can be modulated by down regulating HAMP gene expression. For example, the compositions described herein can be used to treat anemia and other diseases associated with lowered iron levels.\n\n\nMethods for Inhibiting Expression of the HAMP Gene\n\n\nIn yet another aspect, the invention provides a method for inhibiting the expression of the HAMP gene in a mammal. The method comprises administering a composition of the invention to the mammal such that expression of the target HAMP gene is silenced. Because of their high specificity, the dsRNAs of the invention specifically target RNAs (primary or processed) of the target HAMP gene. Compositions and methods for inhibiting the expression of these HAMP genes using dsRNAs can be performed as described elsewhere herein.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the method comprises administering a composition comprising a dsRNA, wherein the dsRNA comprises a nucleotide sequence which is complementary to at least a part of an RNA transcript of the HAMP gene of the mammal to be treated. When the organism to be treated is a mammal such as a human, the composition may be administered by any means known in the art including, but not limited to oral or parenteral routes, including intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, transdermal, airway (aerosol) administration. In preferred embodiments, the compositions are administered by intravenous infusion or injection.\n\n\nUnless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. Although methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the invention, suitable methods and materials are described below. All publications, patent applications, patents, and other references mentioned herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety. In case of conflict, the present specification, including definitions, will control. In addition, the materials, methods, and examples are illustrative only and not intended to be limiting.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nGene Walking of the HAMP Gene\n\n\nDesign and in Silico Selection of siRNAs Targeting Human Hepcidin\n\n\nsiRNAs targeting either human or mouse hepcidin antimicrobial peptide (also referred to as hepcidin, official symbol: hamp, Genbank accession NM\n—\n021175.2 (human) and NM\n—\n032541.1 (mouse) were selected according to following criteria:\n\n\na) predicted highest specificity in human or mouse\n\n \n \n \n \nor\n \n \n \n\n\nb) cross-reactivity to cynomolgous monkey (\nmacaca fascicularis\n), rhesus monkey (\nmacaca mulatta\n) and chimpanzee (\npan troglodytes\n) and predicted highest specificity of siRNA antisense strand in human siRNAs with stretches of >=4 Gs in a row were excluded from the selection.\n\n\nSpecificity was predicted by fastA homology search algorithm and proprietary scripts and was defined as given, if every mRNA in the human RefSeq database (release 17, downloaded on May, 9\nth \n2006) except for hepcidin had either\n\n \n \n \n \na) at least 2 mismatches to the siRNA sense and antisense sequence positions 10 to 18 (non-seed regions), with at least 1 mismatch in \nposition\n 10 or 11 (cleavage site region) of the respective strand if only 2 mismatches were present, or\n \nb) at least 1 mismatch to the siRNA sense and antisense sequence positions 2 to 9 (seed region)\n \n \n \n\n\nPrimate sequences were assembled from genomic sequences (available on Jun. 8 2006 at QFBase, Baylor College of Medicine and NCBI) previous to the selection in order to obtain information on conserved regions with human hepcidin, which were defined as candidate target regions for the set of cross-reactive siRNAs.\n\n\nTable 1 provides an identification of siRNAs designed to selectively target the human hepcidin gene (with cross reactivity to orthologous hepcidin genes as described above).\n\n\nTable 2 provides an identification of siRNAs designed to target the mouse hepcidin gene.\n\n\ndsRNA Synthesis\n\n\nSource of Reagents\n\n\nWhere the source of a reagent is not specifically given herein, such reagent may be obtained from any supplier of reagents for molecular biology at a quality/purity standard for application in molecular biology.\n\n\nsiRNA Synthesis\n\n\nSingle-stranded RNAs were produced by solid phase synthesis on a scale of 1 μmole using an Expedite 8909 synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Applera Deutschland GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany) and controlled pore glass (CPG, 500 Å, Proligo Biochemie GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) as solid support. RNA and RNA containing 2′-O-methyl nucleotides were generated by solid phase synthesis employing the corresponding phosphoramidites and 2′-O-methyl phosphoramidites, respectively (Proligo Biochemie GmbH, Hamburg, Germany). These building blocks were incorporated at selected sites within the sequence of the oligoribonucleotide chain using standard nucleoside phosphoramidite chemistry such as described in Current protocols in nucleic acid chemistry, Beaucage, S. L. et al. (Edrs.), John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, N.Y., USA. Phosphorothioate linkages were introduced by replacement of the iodine oxidizer solution with a solution of the Beaucage reagent (Chruachem Ltd, Glasgow, UK) in acetonitrile (1%). Further ancillary reagents were obtained from Mallinckrodt Baker (Griesheim, Germany).\n\n\nDeprotection and purification of the crude oligoribonucleotides by anion exchange HPLC were carried out according to established procedures. Yields and concentrations were determined by UV absorption of a solution of the respective RNA at a wavelength of 260 nm using a spectral photometer (DU 640B, Beckman Coulter GmbH, Unterschleiβheim, Germany). Double stranded RNA was generated by mixing an equimolar solution of complementary strands in annealing buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.8; 100 mM sodium chloride), heated in a water bath at 85-90° C. for 3 minutes and cooled to room temperature over a period of 3-4 hours. The annealed RNA solution was stored at −20° C. until use.\n\n\ndsRNA Expression Vectors\n\n\nIn another aspect of the invention, HAMP specific dsRNA molecules that modulate HAMP gene expression activity are expressed from transcription units inserted into DNA or RNA vectors (see, e.g., Couture, A, et al., \nTIG\n. (1996), 12:5-10; Skillern, A., et al., International PCT Publication No. WO 00/22113, Conrad, International PCT Publication No. WO 00/22114, and Conrad, U.S. Pat. No. 6,054,299). These transgenes can be introduced as a linear construct, a circular plasmid, or a viral vector, which can be incorporated and inherited as a transgene integrated into the host genome. The transgene can also be constructed to permit it to be inherited as an extrachromosomal plasmid (Gassmann, et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n(1995) 92:1292).\n\n\nThe individual strands of a dsRNA can be transcribed by promoters on two separate expression vectors and co-transfected into a target cell. Alternatively each individual strand of the dsRNA can be transcribed by promoters both of which are located on the same expression plasmid. In a preferred embodiment, a dsRNA is expressed as an inverted repeat joined by a linker polynucleotide sequence such that the dsRNA has a stem and loop structure.\n\n\nThe recombinant dsRNA expression vectors are generally DNA plasmids or viral vectors. dsRNA expressing viral vectors can be constructed based on, but not limited to, adeno-associated virus (for a review, see Muzyczka, et al., \nCurr. Topics Micro. Immunol\n. (1992) 158:97-129)); adenovirus (see, for example, Berkner, et al., BioTechniques (1998) 6:616), Rosenfeld et al. (1991, Science 252:431-434), and Rosenfeld et al. (1992), \nCell \n68:143-155)); or alphavirus as well as others known in the art. Retroviruses have been used to introduce a variety of genes into many different cell types, including epithelial cells, in vitro and/or in vivo (see, e.g., Eglitis, et al., \nScience \n(1985) 230:1395-1398; Danos and Mulligan, \nProc.

Recombinant retroviral vectors capable of transducing and expressing genes inserted into the genome of a cell can be produced by transfecting the recombinant retroviral genome into suitable packaging cell lines such as PA317 and Psi-CRIP (Comette et al., 1991, Human Gene Therapy 2:5-10; Cone et al., 1984, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:6349). Recombinant adenoviral vectors can be used to infect a wide variety of cells and tissues in susceptible hosts (e.g., rat, hamster, dog, and chimpanzee) (Hsu et al., 1992, J. Infectious Disease, 166:769), and also have the advantage of not requiring mitotically active cells for infection.\n\n\nThe promoter driving dsRNA expression in either a DNA plasmid or viral vector of the invention may be a eukaryotic RNA polymerase I (e.g. ribosomal RNA promoter), RNA polymerase II (e.g. CMV early promoter or actin promoter or U1 snRNA promoter) or generally RNA polymerase III promoter (e.g. U6 snRNA or 7SK RNA promoter) or a prokaryotic promoter, for example the T7 promoter, provided the expression plasmid also encodes T7 RNA polymerase required for transcription from a T7 promoter. The promoter can also direct transgene expression to the pancreas (see, e.g. the insulin regulatory sequence for pancreas (Bucchini et al., 1986, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83:2511-2515)).\n\n\nIn addition, expression of the transgene can be precisely regulated, for example, by using an inducible regulatory sequence and expression systems such as a regulatory sequence that is sensitive to certain physiological regulators, e.g., circulating glucose levels, or hormones (Docherty et al., 1994, FASEB J. 8:20-24). Such inducible expression systems, suitable for the control of transgene expression in cells or in mammals include regulation by ecdysone, by estrogen, progesterone, tetracycline, chemical inducers of dimerization, and isopropyl-beta-D1-thiogalactopyranoside (EPTG). A person skilled in the art would be able to choose the appropriate regulatory/promoter sequence based on the intended use of the dsRNA transgene.\n\n\nGenerally, recombinant vectors capable of expressing dsRNA molecules are delivered as described below, and persist in target cells. Alternatively, viral vectors can be used that provide for transient expression of dsRNA molecules. Such vectors can be repeatedly administered as necessary. Once expressed, the dsRNAs bind to target RNA and modulate its function or expression. Delivery of dsRNA expressing vectors can be systemic, such as by intravenous or intramuscular administration, by administration to target cells ex-planted from the patient followed by reintroduction into the patient, or by any other means that allows for introduction into a desired target cell.\n\n\ndsRNA expression DNA plasmids are typically transfected into target cells as a complex with cationic lipid carriers (e.g. Oligofectamine) or non-cationic lipid-based carriers (e.g. Transit-TKO™). Multiple lipid transfections for dsRNA-mediated knockdowns targeting different regions of a single HAMP gene or multiple HAMP genes over a period of a week or more are also contemplated by the invention. Successful introduction of the vectors of the invention into host cells can be monitored using various known methods. For example, transient transfection. can be signaled with a reporter, such as a fluorescent marker, such as Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). Stable transfection. of ex vivo cells can be ensured using markers that provide the transfected cell with resistance to specific environmental factors (e.g., antibiotics and drugs), such as hygromycin B resistance.\n\n\nThe HAMP specific dsRNA molecules can also be inserted into vectors and used as gene therapy vectors for human patients. Gene therapy vectors can be delivered to a subject by, for example, intravenous injection, local administration (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,328,470) or by stereotactic injection (see e.g., Chen et al. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:3054-3057). The pharmaceutical preparation of the gene therapy vector can include the gene therapy vector in an acceptable diluent, or can comprise a slow release matrix in which the gene delivery vehicle is imbedded. Alternatively, where the complete gene delivery vector can be produced intact from recombinant cells, e.g., retroviral vectors, the pharmaceutical preparation can include one or more cells which produce the gene delivery system.\n\n\nThose skilled in the art are familiar with methods and compositions in addition to those specifically set out in the instant disclosure which will allow them to practice this invention to the full scope of the claims hereinafter appended.\n\n\nHAMP siRNA Screening COS-7 Cells\n\n\nCloning:\n\n\nThe cDNA sequences for human hepcidin and murine hepcidin-1 cDNA were synthesized thereby introducing a 5′-XhoI- and a 3′-NotI site and subcloned into pGA4 (Geneart AG, Regensburg, Germany). Human and mouse hepcidin were subcloned via the introduced XhoI- and NotI-sites into the multiple cloning site of the psiCheck-2 vector (Promega, Mannheim, Germany), which is located downstream of the Renilla translational stop codon. Correct subcloning was assured by sequencing (GATC Biotech, Konstanz, Germany).\n\n\nTransfections:\n\n\nDirectly before plasmid transfection, Cos-7 cells (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany) were seeded at 1.5×10\n4 \ncells/well on 96-well plates (Greiner Bio-One GmbH, Frickenhausen, Germany) in 75 μl of growth medium (Dulbecco's MEM, 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1.2 μg/ml sodium bicarbonate, 100u penicillin/100 μg/ml streptomycin, all from Biochrom AG, Berlin, Germany). 50 ng of plasmid/well were transfected with Lipofectamine-2000 (Invitrogen) as described below for the siRNAs, with the plasmid diluted in Opti-MEM to a final volume of 12.5 μl/well, prepared as a mastermix for the whole plate.\n\n\n4 h after the transfection of the plasmid, siRNA transfections were performed in quadruplicates. For each well 0.5 μl Lipofectamine-2000 (Invitrogen GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) were mixed with 12 μl Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. For the siRNA concentration being 50 nM in the 100 μl transfection volume, 1 μl of a 5 μM siRNA were mixed with 10.5 μl Opti-MEM per well, combined with the Lipofectamine-2000-Opti-MEM mixture and again incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. During that incubation time, growth medium was removed from cells and replaced by 75 μl/well of fresh medium. siRNA-Lipofectamine-2000-complexes were applied completely (25 μl each per well) to the cells and cells were incubated for 24 h at 37° C. and 5% CO\n2 \nin a humidified incubator (Heraeus GmbH, Hanau, Germany).\n\n\nCells were harvested by lysis with the appropriate buffer from the Dual-Glo Luciferase assay (Promega GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) and the assay was performed according to the kit's protocol. Values obtained from the Renilla-luciferase measurement were normalized with the respective values acquired in the Firefly-luciferase measurement as a transfection and loading control. Values acquired with siRNAs directed against the Renilla-luciferase-hepcidin fusion mRNA were normalized to the value obtained with an unspecific siRNA (directed against the neomycin resistance gene) which was set to 100%.\n\n\nEffective siRNAs from the screen were further characterized by dose response curves. Transfections of dose response curves were performed in 6-fold dilutions starting with 100 nM down to 10 fM. Mock (no siRNA) was set to 100% expression level. siRNAs were diluted with Opti-MEM to a final volume of 12.5 μl according to the above protocol. (\nFIGS. 3 and 4\n, Table 1)\n\n\nAs can be seen in \nFIGS. 3 and 4\n (summarized in Table 1), many active dsRNAs to hepcidin are identified.\n\n\nThe above screening procedure was repeated using the musine hepcidin gene as the target and the siRNAs of Table 2.\n\n\nStabilizing Modifications and Activity\n\n\nActive duplexes identified above were then remade using modified bases and linkages in order to improve stability of the duplex and protect it from exo and endoribonuclease degradation. Table 3 (and Table 2 for murine selective siRNAs) provides a listing of the duplexes made and the activities of these duplexes in the COS-7 assay described above. In Tables 2 and 3, a lower case “s” represents a phosphorothioate linkage and a lower case base, e.g. “u”, represents a 2′OMe modified base, e.g. 2′OMe-U.\n\n\nActivity is provided from a 50 nM screen (duplicates) for human siRNA in Table 3 (Table 2 for murine) and shown in \nFIG. 5\n (\nFIG. 6\n for murine). Further, IC50 values were determined as described above for several of the most active agents. The results are provided in Table 3.\n\n\nActivity of Murine Hepcidin siRNA In Vivo\n\n\nExperimental Methods\n\n\nThe efficacy of AD-10812 was determined in normal 10 week old 129s6/svEvTac mice using AD-1955 targeting luciferase as a control. These siRNAs were formulated in liposome (LNP-1) as described below and administered through i.v. bolus at a dose of 10 mg/kg (n=8). Forty eight hours after injection, the liver and serum samples were harvested. The liver Hamp1 and Hamp2 mRNA levels were determined by qRT-PCR using Hamp1 and Hamp2 specific primers and serum iron levels were determined using Feroxcine (Randox Life Sciences) and Hitachi 717 instrument.\n\n\nFormulation of siRNAs in Liposomal Particles\n\n\nThe lipidoid LNP-01.4HCl (MW 1487) (\nFIG. 7\n), Cholesterol (Sigma-Aldrich), and PEG-Ceramide C16 (Avanti Polar Lipids) were used to prepare lipid-siRNA nanoparticles. Stock solutions of each in ethanol were prepared: LNP-01, 133 mg/mL; Cholesterol, 25 mg/mL, PEG-Ceramide C16, 100 mg/mL. LNP-01, Cholesterol, and PEG-Ceramide C16 stock solutions were then combined in a 42:48:10 molar ratio. Combined lipid solution was mixed rapidly with aqueous siRNA (in sodium acetate pH 5) such that the final ethanol concentration was 35-45% and the final sodium acetate concentration was 100-300 mM. Lipid-siRNA nanoparticles formed spontaneously upon mixing. Depending on the desired particle size distribution, the resultant nanoparticle mixture was in some cases extruded through a polycarbonate membrane (100 nm cut-off) using a thermobarrel extruder (Lipex Extruder, Northern Lipids, Inc). In other cases, the extrusion step was omitted. Ethanol removal and simultaneous buffer exchange was accomplished by either dialysis or tangential flow filtration. Buffer was exchanged to phosphate buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.2.\n\n\nCharacterization of Formulations\n\n\nFormulations prepared by either the standard or extrusion-free method are characterized in a similar manner. Formulations are first characterized by visual inspection. They should be whitish translucent solutions free from aggregates or sediment. Particle size and particle size distribution of lipid-nanoparticles are measured by dynamic light scattering using a Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern, USA). Particles should be 20-300 nm, and ideally, 40-100 nm in size. The particle size distribution should be unimodal. The total siRNA concentration in the formulation, as well as the entrapped fraction, is estimated using a dye exclusion assay. A sample of the formulated siRNA is incubated with the RNA-binding dye Ribogreen (Molecular Probes) in the presence or absence of a formulation disrupting surfactant, 0.5% Triton-X100. The total siRNA in the formulation is determined by the signal from the sample containing the surfactant, relative to a standard curve. The entrapped fraction is determined by subtracting the “free” siRNA content (as measured by the signal in the absence of surfactant) from the total siRNA content. Percent entrapped siRNA is typically >85%.\n\n\nResults\n\n\nApproximately 70% reduction in Hamp1 mRNA levels and 64% increase in serum iron levels were achieved 48 h after administration of AD-10812 (\nFIG. 8\n). AD-10812 did not reduce Hamp2 mRNA levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nhepcidin siRNAs\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nhuman
