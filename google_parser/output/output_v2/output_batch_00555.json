Field of the Invention\n\n\nThe invention relates to antibodies capable of binding to tissue factor, without inhibiting normal tissue factor mediated blood coagulation, and methods of making and methods of use thereof, including in the treatment of cancer.\n\n\n2. Related Art\n\n\nTissue factor (TF) is a cell-anchored component that, together with factor VIIa, initiates blood coagulation in vivo. TF is a transmembrane glycoprotein with a 219 amino acid residue extracellular region, a 23 amino acid residue transmembrane region and a 21 amino acid residue cytoplasmic region. The extracellular region of TF has two fibronectin III-like domains and a distribution of disulfide bridges characteristic of class-II cytokine and interferon receptors. The cytoplasmic region of TF is short but contains at least one serine residue that can be phosphorylated.\n\n\nTissue factor forms a tight complex (K\nd\n˜pmol) with its native ligand-factor VIIa. In the complex, VIIa wraps around tissue factor (Banner, D. W., et al., \nNature \n380:41-46 (1996)) and forms an extensive region of contact with the tissue factor surface.\n\n\nPatients with cancer exhibit a much higher than expected incidence of thromboembolic disorders, commonly referred to as Trousseau syndrome. Many tumor types commonly associated with Trousseau syndrome, such as lung, pancreatic, breast, colon, and gastric carcinomas, stain positively for TF (Hu, T., et al., \nOncol. Res. \n6:321-327 (1994); Callander, N. S., et al., \nCancer \n70:1194-201 (1992)). Abnormally high expression of TF has been shown clinically to be associated with poor differentiation of many tumors, including colorectal carcinoma (Shigernori, C., et al., \nThromb. Haemost. \n80:894-898 (1998); Seto, S., et al., \nCancer \n88:295-301 (2000)); and non-small cell lung cancer (Sawada, M., et al., \nBr. J. Cancer \n79:472-477 (1999)). Molecular analysis of gene expression shows that TF is differentially expressed in breast cancer cells (Kirschmann, D. A., et al., \nBreast Cancer Res. Treat. \n55:127-136 (1999); Schwirzke, M., et al., \nAnticancer Res. \n19:1801-1814 (1999)).\n\n\nIn tumor tissues, TF is not only expressed on the surface of tumor cells but also on tumor associated vascular endothelial cells. TF has been shown to play an essential role in embryonic blood vessel development (Carmeliet, P., et al., \nNature \n383:73-75 (1996)). TF normally is not expressed in the endothelium. However, tumor associated vascular endothelial cells in breast cancer (Contrino, J., et al., \nNat. Med. \n2:209-215 (1996); Shoji, M., et al., \nAm. J. Pathol. \n152:399-411 (1998)), pituitary adenoma (Nishi, T., et al., \nCancer \n86:1354-1361 (1999)) and lung cancer (Shoji, M., et al., \nAm. J. Pathol. \n152:399-411 (1998); Koomagi, R. and Volm, M., \nInt. J. Cancer \n79:19-22 (1998)) have been shown to express TF. The expression of TF by tumor cells and tumor associated vascular endothelial cells was shown to be induced by tumor secreted VEGF and TNF (Bierhaus, A., et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n270:26419-26432 (1995); Zucker, S., et al., \nInt. J. Cancer \n75:780-786 (1998); Shen, B. Q., et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n276:5281-5286 (2001)).\n\n\nIn normal tissue, TF is only expressed in cells separated from blood proteins by tight endothelium and tissue barriers such as skin, and TF is normally not readily accessible to blood proteins and antibodies. However, in tumor tissues, TF of tumor associated vascular endothelial cells is exposed to blood proteins. At the same time, tumor TF is also accessible because of the leaky tumor vasculature. Tumor cells secrete matrix metalloproteases that most likely play a role in the invasion process, and may be a cause of the leakiness.\n\n\nAntibodies that bind to the TF-VIIa interaction site can inhibit TF-VIIa interaction, thus inhibiting or blocking blood coagulation. However, when large quantities of those antibodies are used for tumor therapy, effective bleeding control in patients may be compromised.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention is directed to an isolated antibody capable of binding to human tissue factor (hTF), wherein the antibody does not inhibit tissue factor (TF) mediated blood coagulation when compared to a normal plasma control.

TF is normally not accessible to blood proteins including antibodies, since TF is not usually expressed on the surface of cells that are in direct contact with blood such as the endothelium lining vessels. However, TF is expressed by many types of tumor cells including tumor associated vascular endothelial cells, where TF is exposed to blood proteins. TF is involved in embryonic blood vessel development and has been associated with tumor metastasis. Thus, TF is considered to be a potential tumor therapeutic target.\n\n\nAntibodies\n\n\nThe invention is directed to an isolated antibody capable of binding to human TF (hTF), wherein the antibody does not inhibit TF mediated blood coagulation compared to a normal plasma control. The invention is also directed to an isolated antibody capable of binding to hTF, wherein the antibody does not inhibit TF mediated blood coagulation compared to a normal plasma control and wherein the antibody can initiate one or more Fc-mediated mechanisms. Because the antibodies of the invention do not inhibit normal TF mediated blood coagulation, normal plasma clotting is not affected in patients treated with antibodies of the invention.\n\n\nAs used herein, “isolated” refers to material removed from its original environment (e.g., the natural environment if it is naturally occurring), and thus is altered “by the hand of man” from its natural state.\n\n\nThe basic antibody structural unit is known to comprise a tetramer composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one “light” (about 25 kDa) and one “heavy” chain (about 50-70 kDa). The amino-terminal portion of each chain includes a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The carboxyl-terminal portion of each chain defines a constant region primarily responsible for Fc-mediated mechanisms. Human light chains are classified as kappa and lambda light chains. Heavy chains are classified as mu, delta, gamma, alpha, or epsilon, and define the antibody's isotype as IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA, and IgE, respectively. See generally, \nFundamental Immunology\n, Ch. 7 (Paul, W., ed., 2nd ed. Raven Press, N.Y. (1989)). The variable regions of each light/heavy chain pair form the antigen binding site. Thus, an intact IgG antibody has two binding sites. Except in bifunctional or bispecific antibodies, the two binding sites are the same.\n\n\nThe variable regions all exhibit the same general structure of relatively conserved framework regions (FR) joined together by three hypervariable regions, also called complementarity determining regions or CDRs. The CDRs from the heavy and the light chains of each pair are aligned by the framework regions, enabling binding to a specific epitope. From N-terminal to C-terminal, both variable region light and heavy chains comprise the domains FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3 and FR4. The assignment of amino acids to each domain is in accordance with the definitions of Kabat, \nSequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest \n(National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1987 and 1991)); Chothia & Lesk, \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n196:901-917 (1987); or Chothia et al., \nNature \n342:878-883 (1989).\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “antibody” is intended to refer to intact immunoglobulin molecules and immunologically active portions or fragments of immunoglobulin molecules, i.e., molecules that contain an antigen binding site that immunospecifically binds an antigen. The antibody of the invention is capable of specifically binding to hTF, without inhibiting TF mediated blood coagulation compared to a normal plasma control. In certain embodiments, the antibody of the invention is capable of specifically binding to hTF, without inhibiting TF mediated blood coagulation compared to a normal plasma control, and wherein the antibody can initiate one or more Fc-mediated mechanisms\n\n\nAntibodies of the invention include, but are not limited to, intact monoclonal, multispecific, human, humanized and chimeric antibodies, modified antibodies, single chain antibodies, single-chain Fvs (scFv), disulfide-linked Fvs (sdFv), Fab fragments, F(ab′) fragments, F(ab′)\n2 \nfragments, Fv fragments, fragments produced by a Fab expression library, fragments comprising either a VL or VH domain, anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies (including, e.g., anti-Id antibodies to antibodies of the invention), intracellularly-made antibodies (i.e., intrabodies), and antigen-binding antibody fragments. The immunoglobulin molecules of the invention can be of any type (e.g., IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD, IgA and IgY), class (e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1 and IgA2) or subclass of immunoglobulin molecule. In some embodiments, the immunoglobulin is an IgG1 isotype. In other embodiments, the immunoglobulin is an IgG2 isotype. In yet other embodiments, the immunoglobulin is an IgG4 isotype. Immunoglobulins can have both heavy and light chains. An array of IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD, IgA, and IgY heavy chains can be paired with a light chain of the kappa or lambda form.\n\n\nAntibodies of the invention can also comprise the variable region(s) alone or in combination with the entirety or a portion of the following: hinge region, CH1, CH2, CH3 and/or Fc domain(s). The antibodies of the invention can be from any animal origin, including birds and mammals. In some embodiments, the antibodies are human, murine, rat, donkey, sheep, rabbit, goat, guinea pig, camel, horse, or chicken antibodies. As used herein, “human” antibodies include antibodies having the amino acid sequence of a human immunoglobulin and include antibodies isolated from human immunoglobulin libraries or from animals transgenic for one or more human immunoglobulins. Thus, it should be understood that antibodies of the invention from an animal are capable of binding to human tissue factor and do not inhibit TF mediated blood coagulation when compared to a normal plasma control. Such antibodies can initiate one or more Fc-mediated mechanisms.\n\n\nThe term “monoclonal antibody” as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that can be present in minor amounts. In contrast to conventional (polyclonal) antibody preparations that typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen and is therefore highly specific. In addition to their specificity, monoclonal antibodies are advantageous since they are synthesized by hybridoma cultures, uncontaminated by other immunoglobulins. The modifier “monoclonal” indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention can be made by the hybridoma method first described by Kohler & Milstein, \nNature \n256:495 (1975), or alternatively can be made by recombinant DNA methods (see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567 (Cabilly et al.)).\n\n\n“Chimeric” antibodies (immunoglobulins) refer to those antibodies having a portion of the heavy and/or light chain which is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567 (Cabilly et al.); Morrison et al., \nProc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA \n81:6851-6855 (1984)).\n\n\n“Humanized” forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies are chimeric immunoglobulins, immunoglobulin chains or fragments thereof (such as Fv, Fab, Fab′, F(ab′)\n2 \nor other antigen-binding sub-sequences of antibodies) which contain minimal sequence derived from a non-human immunoglobulin. For the most part, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a complementarity determining region (CDR) of the recipient are replaced by residues from a CDR of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat or rabbit having the desired specificity and affinity. In some instances, Fv framework residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, a humanized antibody can comprise residues that are found neither in the recipient antibody nor in the imported CDR or framework sequences. These modifications are made to further refine and optimize antibody performance. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin, and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally will also comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details, see, Jones et al., \nNature \n321:522-525 (1986); Reichmann et al., \nNature \n332:323-329 (1988); and Presta, \nCurr. Op. Struct. Biol. \n2:593-596 (1992).\n\n\nThe term “modified antibody” refers to an antibody that has been modified with respect to effector function, so as to enhance the effectiveness of the antibody at mediating antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and/or complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) (also known as complement-mediated cell killing). For example, cysteine residue(s) can be introduced in the Fc region, thereby allowing interchain disulfide bond formation in this region. The homodimeric antibody thus generated can have improved internalization capability and/or increased ADCC and CDC. See Caron et al., \nJ. Exp. Med. \n176:1191-1195 (1992) and Shopes, B., \nJ. Immunol. \n148: 2918-2922 (1992). Homodimeric antibodies with enhanced anti-tumor activity can also be prepared using heterobifunctional cross-linkers as described in Wolff et al., \nCancer Research \n53: 2560-2565 (1993). Alternatively, an antibody can be modified such that it has dual Fc regions and can thereby have enhanced complement-mediated lysis and ADCC capabilities. See Stevenson et al., \nAnti\n-\nCancer Drug Design \n3:219-230 (1989). Additionally, an antibody can be engineered to produce glycoforms which have altered glycosylation patterns that result in enhanced ADCC activity. See U.S. Pat. No. 6,602,684.\n\n\nA bispecific or bifunctional antibody is an artificial hybrid antibody having two different heavy/light chain pairs and two different binding sites. Bispecific antibodies can be produced by a variety of methods including fusion of hybridomas or linking of F(ab′) fragments. See, e.g., Songsivilai & Lachmann, \nClin. Exp. Immunol. \n79:315-321 (1990), Kostelny et al., \nJ. Immunol. \n148:1547 1553 (1992). In addition, bispecific antibodies can be formed as “diabodies” (Holliger et al., \nPNAS USA \n90:6444-6448 (1993)) or “Janusins” (Traunecker et al., \nEMBO J. \n10:3655-3659 (1991) and Traunecker et al., \nInt. J. Cancer Suppl. \n7:51-52 (1992)).\n\n\nThe invention is also directed to an immunoglobulin molecule comprising the heavy or light chain variable region of the antibody of the invention. The invention is further directed to an isolated anti-antibody capable of interfering with the binding of the antibody of the invention to hTF, wherein said anti-antibody does not inhibit TF mediated blood coagulation compared to a normal plasma control.\n\n\nAntibodies of the present invention can also be described or specified in terms of their cross-reactivity. In some embodiments, antibodies of the invention bind polypeptides having at least about 95%, at least about 90%, at least about 85%, at least about 80%, at least about 75%, at least about 70%, at least about 65%, at least about 60%, at least about 55%, at least about 50%, at least about 45%, or at least about 40% amino acid sequence identity to a TF polypeptide (e.g., human TF (SEQ ID NO:2)), or a fragment of the TF polypeptide. In some embodiments, antibodies of the present invention cross-react with murine, monkey, rat and/or rabbit homologs of hTF and the corresponding epitopes thereof. In other embodiments, the above-described cross-reactivity is with respect to any single specific antigenic or immunogenic polypeptide, or combination(s) of 2, 3, 4, 5, or more of specific antigenic and/or immunogenic polypeptides.\n\n\nAs known in the art, “sequence identity” between two polypeptides is determined by comparing the amino acid sequence of one polypeptide to the sequence of a second polypeptide. When discussed herein, whether any particular polypeptide is at least about 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90% or 95% identical to another polypeptide can be determined using methods and computer programs/software known in the art such as, but not limited to, the BESTFIT program (Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package, \nVersion\n 8 for Unix, Genetics Computer Group, University Research Park, 575 Science Drive, Madison, Wis. 53711). BESTFIT uses the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman, \nAdvances in Applied Mathematics \n2:482-489 (1981), to find the best segment of homology between two sequences. When using BESTFIT or any other sequence alignment program to determine whether a particular sequence is, for example, 95% identical to a reference sequence according to the present invention, the parameters are set, of course, such that the percentage of identity is calculated over the full length of the reference polypeptide sequence and that gaps in homology of up to 5% of the total number of amino acids in the reference sequence are allowed.\n\n\nThe antibodies of the invention can bind immunospecifically to a hTF polypeptide or a polypeptide fragment of hTF. In some embodiments, the antibodies of the invention bind immunospecifically to hTF. In other embodiments, the antibodies of the invention bind immunospecifically to the extracellular domain of hTF. As used herein, “extracellular domain of hTF” is intended to refer to the 219 amino acid residue portion of hTF that is localized on the outside surface of the cell (see e.g., \nFIG. 6\n, providing the nucleotide (SEQ ID NO:3) and amino acid (SEQ ID NO:4) sequences of the extracellular domain of human tissue factor with a 32 amino acid N-terminal leader sequence and a 9 amino acid C-terminus RGS-His\n6 \ntag sequence).\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the antibodies of the present invention preferentially bind to hTF. In other embodiments, the antibodies of the present invention immunospecifically bind to hTF and do not cross-react with any other antigens. The antibodies of the present invention do not inhibit TF mediated blood coagulation compared to a normal plasma control. In other embodiments, the antibodies of the invention initiate one or more Fc-mediated mechanisms.\n\n\nThe term “antigen-binding antibody fragment” is intended to refer to a molecule (e.g., a polypeptide) which is a portion or part of a polypeptide sequence as compared to a corresponding full length or native polypeptide sequence of an antibody of the invention. The portion or part of a polypeptide sequence can be at least about 10%, at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, or at least about 99% of the full length or native polypeptide sequence of a full size antibody of the invention, but which retains at least some degree of binding specificity of the full length antibody, and does not inhibit TF mediated blood coagulation compared to a normal plasma control, and optionally, initiate an Fc-mediated mechanism.\n\n\nAntigen-binding antibody fragments (including derivatives) of the antibody molecules (e.g., the VH domains and/or VL domains) described herein include, but are not limited to, fragments (including derivatives) of at least 20, at least 40, at least 60, at least 80, at least 100, at least 120, at least 140, at least 160, or more than 160 amino acids of the full length antibody, including the VH domain, VHCDR1, VHCDR2, VHCDR3, VL domain, VLCDR1, VLCDR2, or VLCDR3. The resultant antibody or antigen-binding antibody fragments can be screened for biological activity to identify fragments that retain the desired activity (e.g., the ability to bind hTF).\n\n\nBy way of a non-limiting example, an antibody can be considered to bind hTF preferentially if it binds the protein with a dissociation constant (K\nD\n) or an off rate (K\noff\n), that is less than the antibody's K\nD \nor K\noff \nfor a second antigen. In other non-limiting embodiments, an antibody can be considered to bind hTF preferentially if it binds the protein with a K\nD \nor K\noff \nthat is at least one order of magnitude less than the antibody's K\nD \nor K\noff \nfor the second antigen. In other non-limiting embodiments, an antibody can be considered to bind hTF preferentially if it binds hTF with a K\nD \nor K\noff \nthat is at least two orders of magnitude less than the antibody's K\nD \nor K\noff \nfor the second antigen.\n\n\nAntibodies of the present invention can also be described or specified in terms of their binding affinity to hTF. In some embodiments, binding affinities include those with a dissociation constant or K\nD \nless than or equal to 5×10\n−2 \nM, 10\n−2 \nM, 5×10\n−3 \nM, 10\n−3 \nM, 5×10\n−4 \nM, or 10\n−4 \nM. In other embodiments, affinities include those with a dissociation constant or K\nD \nless than or equal to 5×10\n−5 \nM, 10\n−5 \nM, 5×10\n−6 \nM, 10\n−7 \nM, 5×10\n7 \nM, 10\n7 \nM, 5×10\n−8 \nM or 10\n−8 \nM. In yet other embodiments, binding affinities include those with a dissociation constant or K\nD \nless than or equal to 5×10\n−9 \nM, 10\n−9 \nM, 5×10\n−10 \nM, 10\n−10 \nM, 5×10\n−11 \nM, 10\n−11 \nM, 5×10\n−12 \nM, 10\n−12 \nM, 5×10\n−13 \nM, 10\n−13 \nM, 5×10\n−14 \nM, 10\n−14 \nM, 5×10\n−−15 \nM, or 10\n−15 \nM.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, antibodies of the invention can bind hTF polypeptides with an off rate (K\noff\n) of less than or equal to 5×10\n−2 \nsec\n−1\n, 10\n−2 \nsec\n−1\n, 5×10\n−3 \nsec\n−1 \nor 10\n−3 \nsec\n−1\n. In other embodiments, antibodies of the invention can bind hTF polypeptides or fragments thereof with an off rate (K\noff\n) less than or equal to 5×10\n−4 \nsec\n−1\n, 10\n−4 \nsec\n−1\n, 5×10\n−5 \nsec\n−1\n, or 10\n−5 \n \nsec\n \n \n \n−1 \n5×10\n−6 \nsec\n−1\n, 10\n−6 \nsec\n−1\n, 5×10\n−7 \nsec\n−1 \nor 10\n−7 \nsec\n−1\n.\n\n\nIn some embodiments of the present invention, antibodies that immunospecifically bind to hTF can comprise a polypeptide having the amino acid sequence of any one of the heavy chains expressed by an anti-TF antibody expressing cell line of the invention and/or any one of the light chains expressed by an anti-TF antibody expressing cell line of the invention. In other embodiments of the present invention, antibodies that immunospecifically bind to hTF can comprise a polypeptide having the amino acid sequence of any one of the VH domains of a heavy chain expressed by an anti-TF antibody expressing cell line of the invention and/or any one of the VL domains of a light chain expressed by an anti-TF antibody expressing cell line of the invention. In yet other embodiments, antibodies of the present invention can comprise the amino acid sequence of a VH domain and VL domain expressed by a single anti-TF antibody expressing cell line of the invention. In other embodiments, antibodies of the present invention can comprise the amino acid sequence of a VH domain and a VL domain expressed by two different anti-TF antibody expressing cell lines of the invention. Molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antigen-binding antibody fragments of the VH and/or VL domains expressed by an anti-TF antibody expressing cell line of the invention that immunospecifically bind to hTF are also encompassed by the invention, as are nucleic acid molecules encoding these VH and VL domains, molecules, and/or fragments.\n\n\nThe present invention also provides polypeptides that comprise, or alternatively consist of, variants (including derivatives) of the antibody molecules (e.g., the VH domains and/or VL domains) described herein, which polypeptides immunospecifically bind to hTF or a fragment or variant thereof. The term “variant” refers to a molecule (e.g., a polypeptide or polynucleotide sequence) with at least one or more differences in its amino acid or nucleotide sequence as compared to a corresponding native polypeptide or DNA sequence. Amino acid sequence variants of the invention will possess at least about 70%, at least about 75%, at least about 85%, at least about 95%, or at least about 99% sequence identity with the amino acid sequence of an anti-TF antibody of the invention. Substitutional variants are those that have at least one amino acid residue in a native sequence removed and a different amino acid inserted in its place at the same position. The substitutions can be single, where only one amino acid in the molecule has been substituted, or they can be multiple, where two or more amino acids have been substituted in the same molecule. Insertional variants are those with one or more amino acids inserted immediately adjacent to an amino acid at a particular position in a native amino acid sequence connected to either the α-carboxyl or α-amino functional group of the amino acid. Deletional variants are those with one or more amino acids removed from the native amino acid sequence. Ordinarily, deletional variants will have one or two amino acids deleted in a particular region of the molecule. Standard techniques known to those of skill in the art can be used to introduce mutations into an antibody of the invention, including, for example, by site-directed mutagenesis or PCR-mediated mutagenesis of the encoding nucleic acid molecule which results in amino acid substitutions. In some embodiments, the variant (including derivatives) has less than 50 amino acid substitutions, less than 40 amino acid substitutions, less than 30 amino acid substitutions, less than 25 amino acid substitutions, less than 20 amino acid substitutions, less than 15 amino acid substitutions, less than 10 amino acid substitutions, less than 5 amino acid substitutions, less than 4 amino acid substitutions, less than 3 amino acid substitutions, or less than 2 amino acid substitutions relative to the reference polypeptide. In some embodiments, the variant polypeptide has the same immunospecificity, or binds the same epitope, as a polypeptide of the present invention.\n\n\nIt is well known in the art that polypeptides, or fragments or variants thereof, with similar amino acid sequences can have similar structure and many of the same biological activities. Thus, the invention is further directed to an isolated first antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, having an amino acid sequence at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, or at least 99% identical to a second antibody comprising an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of: (a) at least one CDR region of a VH domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF196 (deposited May 15, 2003, ATCC Deposit No. PTA-5196); (b) at least one CDR region of a VH domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF260 (deposited May 15, 2003, ATCC Deposit No. PTA-5197); (c) at least one CDR region of a VH domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF278 (deposited Dec. 3, 2003, ATCC Deposit No. PTA-5676); (d) at least one CDR region of a VH domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF277 (deposited Dec. 3, 2003, ATCC Deposit No. PTA-5675); (e) at least one CDR region of a VH domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF392 (deposited Dec. 3, 2003, ATCC Deposit No. PTA-5677); (f) at least one CDR region of a VH domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF9 (deposited Dec. 3, 2003, ATCC Deposit No. PTA-5674); (g) at least two CDR regions of a VH domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF196; (h) at least two CDR regions of a VH domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF260; (i) at least two CDR regions of a VH domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF278: (j) at least two CDR regions of a VH domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF277; (k) at least two CDR regions of a VH domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF392; (l) at least two CDR regions of a VH domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF9; (m) at least three CDR regions of a VH domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF196; (n) at least three CDR regions of a VH domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF260; (o) at least three CDR regions of a VH domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF278: (p) at least three CDR regions of a VH domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF277; (q) at least three CDR regions of a VH domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF392; (r) at least three CDR regions of a VH domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF9; (s) at least one CDR region of a VL domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF196; (t) at least one CDR region of a VL domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF260; (u) at least one CDR region of a VL domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF278; (v) at least one CDR region of a VL domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF277; (w) at least one CDR region of a VL domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF392; (x) at least one CDR region of a VL domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF9; (y) at least two CDR regions of a VL domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF196; (z) at least two CDR regions of a VL domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF260; (aa) at least two CDR regions of a VL domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF278; (bb) at least two CDR regions of a VL domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF277; (cc) at least two CDR regions of a VL domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF392; (dd) at least two CDR regions of a VL domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF9; (ee) at least three CDR regions of a VL domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF196; (ff) at least three CDR regions of a VL domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF260; (gg) at least three CDR regions of a VL domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF278; (hh) at least three CDR regions of a VL domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF277; (ii) at least three CDR regions of a VL domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF392; and (jj) at least three CDR regions of a VL domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF9. In some embodiments, the first antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, has the same immunospecificity, or binds the same epitope, as the second antibody.\n\n\nThe invention is directed to an isolated antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, having an amino acid sequence at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, or at least 95% identical to an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of: (a) a polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:6 or 8 or a polypeptide encoded by the cDNA sequence provided in ATCC Deposit No: PTA-5252 or PTA-5253, respectively (TF260VH/PUC18 or TF260VL/PUC18, respectively); (b) a polypeptide domain of SEQ ID NO:6 or 8 or the polypeptide encoded by the cDNA sequence provided in ATCC Deposit No: PTA-5252 or PTA-5253, respectively (TF260VH/PUC18 or TF260VL/PUC18, respectively); (c) a polypeptide epitope of SEQ ID NO:6 or 8 or the polypeptide encoded by the cDNA sequence provided in ATCC Deposit No: PTA-5252 or PTA-5253, respectively (TF260VH/PUC18 or TF260VL/PUC18, respectively); (d) a polypeptide which is a variant of SEQ ID NO:6 or 8; (e) a polypeptide which is a species homologue of the SEQ ID NO:6 or 8; (f) a polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:10 or 12 or a polypeptide encoded by the cDNA sequence included in ATCC Deposit No: PTA-5250 or PTA-5251, respectively (TF196VH/PUC18 or TF196VL/PUC18, respectively); (g) a polypeptide domain of SEQ ID NO:10 or 12 or the polypeptide encoded by the cDNA sequence included in ATCC Deposit No: PTA-5250 or PTA-5251, respectively (TF196VH/PUC18 or TF196VL/PUC18, respectively); (h) a polypeptide epitope of SEQ ID NO: 10 or 12 or the polypeptide encoded by the cDNA sequence included in ATCC Deposit No: PTA-5250 or PTA-5251, respectively (TF196VH/PUC18 or TF196VL/PUC18, respectively); (i) a polypeptide which is a variant of SEQ ID NO:10 or 12; (j) a polypeptide which is a species homologue of SEQ ID NO:10 or 12; (k) a polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:19 or 21 or a polypeptide encoded by the cDNA sequence provided in ATCC Deposit No: PTA-5694 or PTA-5695, respectively (TF278VHs/PUC180R TF278VLs/PUC18, respectively); (l) a polypeptide domain of SEQ ID NO:19 or 21 or the polypeptide encoded by the cDNA sequence provided in ATCC Deposit No: PTA-5694 or PTA-5695, respectively (TF278VHs/PUC180R TF278VLs/PUC18, respectively); (m) a polypeptide epitope of SEQ ID NO:19 or 21 or the polypeptide encoded by the cDNA sequence provided in ATCC Deposit No: PTA-5694 or PTA-5695, respectively (TF278VHs/PUC180R TF278VLs/PUC18, respectively); (n) a polypeptide which is a variant of SEQ ID NO:19 or 21; (o) a polypeptide which is a species homologue of the SEQ ID NO:19 or 21; (p) a polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:23 or 25; (q) a polypeptide domain of SEQ ID NO:23 or 25; (r) a polypeptide epitope of SEQ ID NO:23 or 25; (s) a polypeptide which is a variant of SEQ ID NO:23 or 25; (t) a polypeptide which is a species homologue of the SEQ ID NO:23 or 25; (u) a polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:27 or a polypeptide encoded by the cDNA sequence provided in ATCC Deposit No: PTA-5696 (TF392VHs/PUC18); (v) a polypeptide domain of SEQ ID NO:27 or the polypeptide encoded by the cDNA sequence provided in ATCC Deposit No: PTA-5696 (TF392VHs/PUC18); (w) a polypeptide epitope of SEQ ID NO:27 or the polypeptide encoded by the cDNA sequence provided in ATCC Deposit No: PTA-5696 (TF392VHs/PUC18); (x) a polypeptide which is a variant of SEQ ID NO:27; (y) a polypeptide which is a species homologue of the SEQ ID NO:27; (z) a polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:29 or 31 or a polypeptide encoded by the cDNA sequence provided in ATCC Deposit No: PTA-5692 or PTA-5693, respectively (TF9VHs/PUC18 or TF9VL/PUC18, respectively); (aa) a polypeptide domain of SEQ ID NO:29 or 31 or the polypeptide encoded by the cDNA sequence provided in ATCC Deposit No: PTA-5692 or PTA-5693, respectively (TF9VHs/PUC18 or TF9VL/PUC18, respectively); (bb) a polypeptide epitope of SEQ ID NO:29 or 31 or the polypeptide encoded by the cDNA sequence provided in ATCC Deposit No: PTA-5692 or PTA-5693, respectively (TF9VHs/PUC18 or TF9VL/PUC18, respectively); (cc) a polypeptide which is a variant of SEQ ID NO:29 or 31; and (dd) a polypeptide which is a species homologue of the SEQ ID NO:29 or 31.

In other embodiments, rapid immunization of mice at multiple sites (RIMMS) can be used. See, e.g., Kilpatrick, K. E., et al., \nHybridoma \n16:381-389 (1997). In yet other embodiments, methods of producing antibodies include, but are not limited to, hybridoma technology, EBV transformation, XenoMouse™ technology (see Green et al., \nNature Genetics \n7:13-21 (1994) and other methods discussed herein as well as through the use of recombinant DNA technology, as discussed below.\n\n\nThe antibodies of the present invention can be generated by any suitable method known in the art. Polyclonal antibodies to an antigen of interest can be produced by various procedures well known in the art. For example, a polypeptide of interest can be administered to various host animals including, but not limited to, rabbits, mice, rats, etc. to induce the production of sera containing polyclonal antibodies specific for the antigen. Various adjuvants can be used to increase the immunological response, depending on the host species, and include, but are not limited to, Freund's (complete and incomplete), mineral gels such as aluminum hydroxide, surface active substances such as lysolecithin, pluronic polyols, polyanions, peptides, oil emulsions, keyhole limpet hemocyanins, dinitrophenol, and potentially useful human adjuvants such as BCG (bacille Calmette-Guerin) and \ncorynebacterium parvum\n. Such adjuvants are also well known in the art.\n\n\nMonoclonal antibodies can be prepared using a wide variety of techniques known in the art including the use of hybridoma, recombinant, and phage display technologies, or combinations thereof. For example, monoclonal antibodies can be produced using hybridoma techniques including those known in the art and taught, for example, in Harlow et al., Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2nd ed. 1988); Hammerling, et al., in \nMonoclonal Antibodies and T\n-\nCell Hybridomas\n, Elsevier, N.Y. (1981), pp. 563-681. The term “monoclonal antibody” as used herein is not limited to antibodies produced through hybridoma technology. The term “monoclonal antibody” refers to an antibody that is derived from a single clone, including any eukaryotic, prokaryotic, or phage clone, and not the method by which it is produced.\n\n\nMethods for producing and screening for specific antibodies using hybridoma technology are routine and well known in the art. In a non-limiting example, mice can be immunized with a polypeptide of interest or a cell expressing such peptide. Once an immune response is detected, e.g., antibodies specific for the antigen are detected in the mouse serum, the mouse spleen is harvested and splenocytes isolated. The splenocytes are then fused by well known techniques to any suitable myeloma cells, e.g., mouse myeloma cells (P3×63/Ag8.653, ATCC No. CRL-1580, Manassas, Va.; SP2/0-Ag14, ATCC No. CRL-1581, Manassas, Va.; P3/NSI/1-Ag4-1 (NS-1), ATCC No. TIB-18, Manassas, Va.). Hybridomas are selected and cloned by limited dilution. The hybridoma clones are then assayed by methods known in the art for cells that secrete antibodies capable of binding a polypeptide of interest. Ascites fluid, which generally contains high levels of antibodies, can be generated by injecting mice with positive hybridoma clones.\n\n\nAccordingly, the present invention provides methods of generating monoclonal antibodies as well as antibodies produced by the method comprising culturing a hybridoma cell secreting an antibody of the invention, wherein the hybridoma is generated by fusing splenocytes or lymph node cells isolated from a mammal immunized with an antigen of the invention with myeloma cells and then screening the hybridomas resulting from the fusion for hybridoma clones that secrete an antibody able to bind a polypeptide of interest.\n\n\nHumanized antibodies can be made by a variety of methods known in the art including phage display methods using antibody libraries derived from human immunoglobulin sequences. See also U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,444,887 and 4,716,111; and PCT publications WO 98/46645, WO 98/50433, WO 98/24893, WO 98/16654, WO 96/34096, WO 96/33735, and WO 91/10741. Additionally, antibodies can be humanized using a variety of techniques known in the art including, for example, CDR-grafting (EP 239,400; PCT publication WO 91/09967; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,225,539; 5,530,101; and 5,585,089), veneering or resurfacing (EP 592,106; EP 519,596; Padlan, \nMolecular Immunology \n28(4/5):489-498 (1991); Studnicka et al., \nProtein Engineering \n7(6):805-814 (1994); Roguska., et al., PNAS 91:969-973 (1994)), and chain shuffling (U.S. Pat. No. 5,565,332).\n\n\nHuman antibodies can be produced using transgenic mice that are incapable of expressing functional endogenous immunoglobulins, but which can express human immunoglobulin genes. For example, the human heavy chain and light chain immunoglobulin gene complexes can be introduced randomly or by homologous recombination into mouse embryonic stem cells. Alternatively, nucleic acids encoding the human variable region and constant region can be introduced into mouse embryonic stem cells in addition to the human heavy and light chain genes. The mouse heavy chain and light chain immunoglobulin genes can be rendered non-functional separately or simultaneously with the introduction of human immunoglobulin loci by homologous recombination. In some embodiments, homozygous deletion of the JH region prevents endogenous antibody production. The modified embryonic stem cells are expanded and microinjected into blastocysts to produce chimeric mice. The chimeric mice are then bred to produce homozygous offspring that express human antibodies. The transgenic mice are immunized in the normal fashion with a selected antigen, e.g., all or a portion of a polypeptide of interest. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen can be obtained from the immunized, transgenic mice using conventional hybridoma technology. The human immunoglobulin transgenes harbored by the transgenic mice rearrange during B cell differentiation, and subsequently undergo class switching and somatic mutation. Thus, using such a technique, it is possible to produce therapeutically useful IgG, IgA, IgM and IgE antibodies. For an overview of this technology for producing human antibodies, see Lonberg and Huszar, \nInt. Rev. Immunol. \n13:65-93 (1995). For a detailed discussion of this technology for producing human antibodies and human monoclonal antibodies and protocols for producing such antibodies, see, e.g., PCT publications WO 98/24893; WO 92/01047; WO 96/34096; WO 96/33735; European Patent No. 0 598 877; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,413,923; 5,625,126; 5,633,425; 5,569,825; 5,661,016; 5,545,806; 5,814,318; 5,885,793; 5,916,771; 5,939,598; 6,075,181; and 6,114,598.\n\n\nCompletely human antibodies that recognize a selected epitope can be generated using a technique referred to as “guided selection.” In this approach a selected non-human monoclonal antibody, e.g., a mouse antibody, is used to guide the selection of a completely human antibody recognizing the same epitope (Jespers et al., \nBio/technology \n12:899-903 (1988)).\n\n\nExamples of techniques which can be used to produce single-chain Fvs and antibodies include those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,946,778 and 5,258,498; Huston et al., \nMethods in Enzymology \n203:46-88 (1991); Shu et al., \nPNAS \n90:7995-7999 (1993); and Skerra et al., \nScience \n240:1038-1040 (1988). Single chain antibodies are formed by linking the heavy and light chain fragments of the Fv region via an amino acid bridge, resulting in a single chain polypeptide. Techniques for the assembly of functional Fv fragments in \nE. coli \ncan also be used (Skerra et al., \nScience \n242:1038-1041 (1988)).\n\n\nIn addition, methods for producing chimeric antibodies are known in the art. See e.g., Morrison, \nScience \n229:1202 (1985); Oi et al., \nBioTechniques \n4:214 (1986); Gillies et al., \nJ. Immunol. Methods \n125:191-202 (1989); Neuberger et al., \nNature \n312:604-608 (1984); Takeda et al., \nNature \n314:452-454 (1985); U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,807,715; 4,816,567; and 4,816,397.\n\n\nOnce an antibody molecule of the invention has been produced by an animal, chemically synthesized, or recombinantly expressed, it can be purified by any method known in the art for purification of an immunoglobulin molecule, for example, by chromatography (e.g., ion exchange, affinity, and sizing column chromatography), centrifugation, differential solubility, or by any other standard technique for the purification of proteins. In addition, the antibodies of the present invention or fragments thereof can be fused to heterologous polypeptide sequences described herein or otherwise known in the art, to facilitate purification.\n\n\nNucleic Acid Molecules Encoding Antibodies and Polypeptides Thereof\n\n\nThe present invention further provides an isolated polynucleotide molecule having a nucleotide sequence encoding an antibody of the invention. In some embodiments, the isolated polynucleotide molecule comprises a nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:5, 7, 9, or 11 (as provided in TF260VH/PUC18, TF260VL/PUC18, TF196VH/PUC18, or TF196VL/PUC18, respectively, deposited Jun. 6, 2003 as ATCC Deposit Nos: PTA-5252, PTA-5253, PTA-5250, or PTA-5251, respectively, or a nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:18, 20, 26, 28, or 30 (as provided in TF278VHs/PUC18, TF278VLs/PUC18, TF392VHs/PUC18, TF9VHs/PUC18 or TF9VL/PUC18, respectively, deposited Dec. 9, 2003 as ATCC Deposit Nos: PTA-5694, PTA-5695, PTA-5696, PTA-5692, or PTA-5693, respectively), or a nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:22 or 24 or a nucleotide sequence encoding an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:6, 8, 10, 12 (as encoded by TF260VH/PUC18, TF260VL/PUC18, TF196VH/PUC18, or TF196VL/PUC18, respectively, deposited Jun. 6, 2003 as ATCC Deposit No: PTA-5252, PTA-5253, PTA-5250, or PTA-5251, respectively), 19, 21, 27, 29, 31 (as encoded by TF278VHs-PUC18, TF278VLs-PUC18, TF392VHs-PUC18, TF9VHs-PUC18 or TF9VL-PUC18, respectively, deposited on Dec. 9, 2003, as ATCC Deposit No: PTA-5694, PTA-5695, PTA-5696, PTA-5692 or PTA-5693, respectively), 23 or 25 (including degenerate variants), or fragments or variants thereof.\n\n\nThe invention is further directed to an isolated polynucleotide having a nucleotide sequence encoding a first antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, having an amino acid sequence that is at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, or at least 99% identical to the amino acid sequence of a second antibody comprising an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of: (a) at least one CDR region of a VH domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF196;

In some embodiments, the first antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, has the same immunospecificity, or binds the same epitope, as the second antibody.\n\n\nThe invention is further directed to an isolated polynucleotide having a nucleotide sequence at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, or at least 99% identical to a nucleotide sequence encoding the amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of: (a) at least one CDR region of a VH domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF196; (b) at least one CDR region of a VH domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF260; (c) at least one CDR region of a VH domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF278; (d) at least one CDR region of a VH domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF277; (e) at least one CDR region of a VH domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF392; (f) at least one CDR region of a VH domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF9; (g) at least two CDR regions of a VH domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF196; (h) at least two CDR regions of a VH domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF260; (i) at least two CDR regions of a VH domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF278; (j) at least two CDR regions of a VH domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF277; (k) at least two CDR regions of a VH domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF392; (l) at least two CDR regions of a VH domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF9; (m) at least three CDR regions of a VH domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF196; (n) at least three CDR regions of a VH domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF260; (o) at least three CDR regions of a VH domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF278; (p) at least three CDR regions of a VH domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF277; (q) at least three CDR regions of a VH domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF392; (r) at least three CDR regions of a VH domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF9; (s) at least one CDR region of a VL domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF196; (t) at least one CDR region of a VL domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF260; (u) at least one CDR region of a VL domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF278; (v) at least one CDR region of a VL domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF277; (w) at least one CDR region of a VL domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF392; (x) at least one CDR region of a VL domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF9; (y) at least two CDR regions of a VL domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF196; (z) at least two CDR regions of a VL domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF260; (aa) at least two CDR regions of a VL domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF278; (bb) at least two CDR regions of a VL domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF277; (cc) at least two CDR regions of a VL domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF392; (dd) at least two CDR regions of a VL domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF9; (ee) at least three CDR regions of a VL domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF196; (ff) at least three CDR regions of a VL domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF260; (gg) at least three CDR regions of a VL domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF278; (hh) at least three CDR regions of a VL domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF277; (ii) at least three CDR regions of a VL domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF392; and (jj) at least three CDR regions of a VL domain of the antibody expressed by hybridoma cell line TF9. In some embodiments, the isolated polynucleotide encodes an amino acid sequence which further encodes an antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, having a CDR region with the same immunospecificity, or binds the same epitope, as either a VH domain or VL domain of an antibody of the present invention.\n\n\nThe present invention is further directed to a polynucleotide molecule having a nucleotide sequence encoding an antigen-binding antibody fragment that binds to hTF without inhibiting normal TF mediated blood coagulation compared to a normal plasma control, and optionally, can initiate an Fc-mediated mechanism. The present invention is further directed to an isolated polynucleotide molecule having a nucleotide sequence that can hybridize under stringent conditions to the complement of the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:5, 7, 9, 11, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, or 30 and that encodes a polypeptide that can bind to hTF without inhibiting normal TF mediated blood coagulation compared to a normal plasma control, and optionally, can initiate an Fc-mediated mechanism. The present invention is further directed to an isolated polynucleotide molecule comprising a nucleotide sequence that has at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, or at least 99% sequence identity to any of SEQ ID NO:5, 7, 9, 11, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, or 30 and encodes a polypeptide that can bind to hTF without inhibiting normal TF mediated blood coagulation compared to a normal plasma control, and optionally, can initiate an Fc-mediated mechanism.\n\n\nAs known in the art, “sequence identity” between two nucleotide sequences is determined by comparing the nucleotide sequence of one polynucleotide molecule to the sequence of a second polynucleotide molecule. When discussed herein, whether any particular nucleotide sequence is identical to another nucleotide sequence can be determined using methods and computer programs/software known in the art such as, but not limited to, the BESTFIT program (Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package, \nVersion\n 8 for Unix, Genetics Computer Group, University Research Park, 575 Science Drive, Madison, Wis. 53711). BESTFIT uses the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman, \nAdvances in Applied Mathematics \n2:482-489 (1981), to find the best segment of homology between two sequences. When using BESTFIT or any other sequence alignment program to determine whether a particular sequence is, for example, 95% identical to a reference sequence according to the present invention, the parameters are set, of course, such that the percentage of identity is calculated over the full length of the reference polypeptide sequence and that gaps in homology of up to 5% of the total number of nucleic acids in the reference sequence are allowed.\n\n\nAs used herein “stringent conditions” refer to the ability of a first polynucleotide molecule to hybridize, and remain bound to, a second, filter-bound polynucleotide molecule in 0.5 M NaHPO\n4\n, 7% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and 1 mM EDTA at 65° C., followed by washing in 0.2×SSC/0.1% SDS at 42° C. (see Ausubel et al. (eds.), \nCurrent Protocols in Molecular Biology\n, Vol. 1, Green Publishing Associates, Inc., and John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York (1989), at p. 2.10.3).\n\n\nThe invention is also directed to a recombinant vector comprising an isolated polynucleotide of the present invention, and a host cell comprising the vector. Host cells are genetically engineered (transduced, transformed or transfected) with a vector of this invention which can be, for example, a cloning vector or an expression vector. The vector can be, for example, in the form of a plasmid, a viral particle, a phage, etc. The engineered host cells can be cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for activating promoters, selecting transformants or amplifying the genes of the present invention. The culture conditions, such as temperature, pH and the like, can be those previously used with the host cell selected for expression, and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan.\n\n\nThe invention is further directed to a method of making an antibody of the invention comprising: (a) expressing the antibody encoded by the isolated polynucleotide of the invention; and (b) recovering the antibody.\n\n\nFragments or portions of the polypeptides of the present invention can be employed for producing the corresponding full-length polypeptide by peptide synthesis; therefore, the fragments can be employed as intermediates for producing the full-length polypeptides. Fragments or portions of the polynucleotides of the present invention can be used to synthesize full-length polynucleotides of the present invention.\n\n\nThe polynucleotide molecules of the present invention can be employed for producing polypeptides by recombinant techniques. Thus, for example, a polynucleotide molecule can be included in any one of a variety of expression vectors for expressing a polypeptide. Such vectors include chromosomal, non-chromosomal and synthetic DNA sequences, e.g., derivatives of SV40; bacterial plasmids; phage DNA; baculovirus; yeast plasmids; vectors derived from combinations of plasmids and phage DNA, viral DNA such as vaccinia, adenovirus, fowl pox virus, and pseudorabies. However, any other vector can be used as long as it is replicable and viable in the host.\n\n\nThe appropriate DNA sequence can be inserted into a vector by a variety of procedures. In general, the DNA sequence is inserted into an appropriate restriction endonuclease site(s) in a vector by procedures known in the art. Such procedures and others are deemed to be within the scope of those skilled in the art.\n\n\nThe DNA sequence in the expression vector is operatively linked to an appropriate expression control sequence(s) (promoter) to direct mRNA synthesis. As representative examples of such promoters, there can be mentioned: LTR or SV40 promoter, the \nE. coli \nlac or trp, the phage lambda P\nL \npromoter and other promoters known to control expression of genes in prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells or their viruses. The expression vector also should contain a ribosome binding site for translation initiation, and a transcription terminator. The vector can also include appropriate sequences for amplifying expression, as discussed infra.\n\n\nIn addition, the expression vectors can contain one or more selectable marker genes to provide a phenotypic trait for selection of transformed host cells such as dihydrofolate reductase or neomycin resistance for eukaryotic cell culture, or tetracycline or ampicillin resistance in \nE. coli. \n \n\n\nThe vector containing the appropriate DNA sequence as hereinabove described, as well as an appropriate promoter or control sequence, can be employed to transform an appropriate host cell to permit the host cell to express the protein. Large numbers of suitable vectors and promoters are known to those of skill in the art, and are commercially available. The following vectors are provided by way of example. Bacterial: pQE70, pQE60, pQE-9 (Qiagen), pBS, pD10, phagescript, psiX174, pbluescript SK, pbsks, pNH8A, pNH16a, pNH18A, pNH46A (Stratagene); ptrc99a, pKK223-3, pKK233-3, pDR540, pRIT5 (Pharmacia). Eukaryotic: pWLNEO, pSV2CAT, pOG44, pXT1, pSG (Stratagene) pSVK3, pBPV, pMSG, pSVL (Pharmacia). However, any other plasmid or vector can be used as long as they are replicable and stable in the host.\n\n\nPromoter regions can be selected from any desired gene using CAT (chloramphenicol transferase) vectors or other vectors with selectable markers. Two appropriate vectors are PKK232-8 and PCM7. Particular named bacterial promoters include lac, lacZ, T3, T7, gpt, lambda P\nR\n, P\nL \nand trp. Eukaryotic promoters include CMV immediate early, HSV thymidine kinase, early and late SV40, LTRs from retroviruses, and mouse metallothionein-I. Selection of the appropriate vector and promoter is well within the level of ordinary skill in the art. Promoters can be derived from operons encoding glycolytic enzymes such as 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), α-factor, acid phosphatase, or heat shock proteins, among others. The heterologous structural sequence to be expressed is assembled in appropriate phase with translation initiation and termination sequences, and, if necessary, a leader sequence capable of directing secretion of translated protein into the periplasmic space or extracellular medium. Optionally, the heterologous sequence can encode a fusion protein including an N-terminal or C-terminal identification peptide imparting desired characteristics, e.g., stabilization or simplified purification of expressed recombinant product.\n\n\nIn a further embodiment, the present invention relates to host cells containing the above-described constructs. The host cell can be a higher eukaryotic cell, such as a mammalian cell, or a lower eukaryotic cell, such as a yeast cell, or the host cell can be a prokaryotic cell, such as a bacterial cell. Introduction of the construct into the host cell can be effected by any suitable techniques, such as, e.g., calcium phosphate transfection, DEAE-Dextran mediated transfection, or electroporation among others. (Davis, L., et al., \nBasic Methods in Molecular Biology\n, (1986)).\n\n\nAs representative examples of appropriate hosts, there can be mentioned: bacterial cells, such as \nE. coli, Streptomyces, Salmonella typhimurium\n; fungal cells, such as yeast; insect cells such as \nDrosophila \nand \nSpodoptera \nSf9; animal cells such as CHO, COS or Bowes melanoma; plant cells, etc. The selection of an appropriate host is deemed to be within the scope of those skilled in the art from the teachings herein. Various mammalian cell culture systems can also be employed to express recombinant protein. Examples of mammalian expression systems include the COS-7 lines of monkey kidney fibroblasts, described by Gluzman, \nCell \n23:175 (1981), and other cell lines capable of expressing a compatible vector, for example, the C127, 3T3, CHO, HeLa and BHK cell lines. Mammalian expression vectors will comprise an origin of replication, a suitable promoter and enhancer, and also any necessary ribosome binding sites, polyadenylation site, splice donor and acceptor sites, transcriptional termination sequences, and 5′ flanking nontranscribed sequences. DNA sequences derived from the SV40 splice, and polyadenylation sites can be used to provide the required nontranscribed genetic elements.\n\n\nThe constructs in host cells can be used in a conventional manner to produce the gene product encoded by the recombinant sequence. Alternatively, the polypeptides of the invention can be synthetically produced by conventional peptide synthesizers.\n\n\nMature proteins can be expressed in mammalian cells, yeast, bacteria, or other cells under the control of appropriate promoters. Cell-free translation systems can also be employed to produce such proteins using RNAs derived from the DNA constructs of the present invention. Appropriate cloning and expression vectors for use with prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts are described by Sambrook, et al., \nMolecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Second Edition\n, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., (1989).\n\n\nTranscription of the DNA encoding the polypeptides of the present invention by higher eukaryotes can be increased by inserting an enhancer sequence into the vector. Enhancers are cis-acting elements of DNA, usually about from 10 to 300 bp that act on a promoter to increase its transcription or amplifying expression. Examples include the SV40 enhancer on the late side of the \nreplication origin bp\n 100 to 270, a cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer, the polyoma enhancer on the late side of the replication origin, and adenovirus enhancers.\n\n\nFollowing transformation of a suitable host strain and growth of the host strain to an appropriate cell density, the selected promoter can be induced by appropriate means (e.g., temperature shift or chemical induction) and the cells are cultured for an additional period.\n\n\nWhere the desired protein is retained intracellularly, cells are typically harvested by centrifugation, disrupted by physical or chemical means, and the resulting crude extract retained for further purification. Microbial cells employed in expression of proteins can be disrupted by any convenient method, including freeze-thaw cycling, sonication, mechanical disruption, or use of cell lysing agents, or a combination thereof. Such methods are well known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\nThe polypeptides of the invention can be recovered and purified from recombinant cell cultures by methods including ammonium sulfate or ethanol precipitation, acid extraction, anion or cation exchange chromatography, phosphocellulose chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, affinity chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography and lectin chromatography. Protein refolding steps can be used, as necessary, in completing configuration of the mature protein. Finally, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) can be employed for final purification steps.\n\n\nThe polypeptides of the present invention can be a naturally purified product, or a product of chemical synthetic procedures, or produced by recombinant techniques from a prokaryotic or eukaryotic host (for example, by bacterial, yeast, higher plant, insect and mammalian cells in culture). Depending upon the host employed in a recombinant production procedure, the polypeptide of the present invention can be glycosylated or can be non-glycosylated. Polypeptides of the invention can also include an initial methionine amino acid residue.\n\n\nAntibody Conjugates\n\n\nAntibodies of the present invention can be used to purify, detect, and/or target hTF, including in both in vitro and in vivo diagnostic and therapeutic methods. For example, the antibodies can be useful in immunoassays for qualitatively and quantitatively measuring levels of hTF in biological samples. See, e.g., Harlow et al., \nAntibodies: A Laboratory Manual \n(Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2nd ed. 1988).\n\n\nThe antibodies of the invention include derivatives of antibodies that are modified or conjugated by the covalent attachment of any type of molecule to the antibody. For example, but not by way of limitation, the antibody derivatives include antibodies that have been modified, e.g., by glycosylation, acetylation, pegylation, phosphorylation, amidation, derivatization by known protecting/blocking groups, proteolytic cleavage, linkage to a cellular ligand or other protein, etc. Any of numerous chemical modifications can be carried out by known techniques, including, but not limited to, specific chemical cleavage, acetylation, formylation, metabolic synthesis of tunicamycin, etc. Additionally, the derivatives can contain one or more non-classical amino acids.\n\n\nAntibodies of the present invention can be used for epitope mapping to identify the epitope(s) bound by the antibody. Epitopes identified in this way can, in turn, be used as vaccine candidates, i.e., to immunize an individual to elicit antibodies against the naturally occurring forms of hTF.\n\n\nThe antibodies of the present invention can be used either alone or in combination with other compositions. The antibodies can be recombinantly fused to a heterologous polypeptide at the N- or C-terminus or chemically conjugated (including covalent and non-covalent conjugations) to polypeptides or other compositions. For example, antibodies of the present invention can be recombinantly fused or conjugated to molecules useful as labels in detection assays, or as effector molecules such as heterologous polypeptides, drugs, radionuclides, or toxins. See, e.g., PCT publications WO 92/08495; WO 91/14438; WO 89/12624; U.S. Pat. No. 5,314,995; and \nEP\n 0 396 387.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the antibody of the invention is conjugated to cytotoxic agents. A “cytotoxic agent” is any agent toxic or otherwise detrimental to cells. Examples include, but are not limited to, a radionuclide, paclitaxol, cytochalasin B, gramicidin D, ethidium bromide, emetine, mitomycin, etoposide, tenoposide, vincristine, vinblastine, colchicin, doxorubicin, daunorubicin, dihydroxy anthracin dione, mitoxantrone, mithramycin, actinomycin D, 1-dehydrotestosterone, glucocorticoids, procaine, tetracaine, lidocaine, propranolol, and puromycin and analogs or homologs thereof. Examples of radionuclides useful as cytotoxic agents include, but are not limited to, \n131\nI, \n177\nLu, \n90\nY, and \n186\nRe.\n\n\nThe present invention also encompasses antibodies of the invention conjugated to detectable agents, wherein the detectable agents can be used for diagnosis or therapeutic purposes. The antibodies can be used diagnostically to, for example, locate or monitor the development or progression of a tumor as part of a clinical testing procedure to, e.g., determine the efficacy of a given treatment regimen. Examples of detectable agents include various enzymes, prosthetic groups, fluorescent materials, luminescent materials, bioluminescent materials, radioactive materials, positron emitting metals using various positron emission tomographies, and nonradioactive paramagnetic metal ions. The detectable substance can be coupled or conjugated either directly to the antibody or indirectly, through an intermediate (such as, for example, a linker known in the art) using techniques known in the art. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,741,900 for metal ions that can be conjugated to antibodies for use as diagnostics according to the present invention. Examples of suitable enzymes include horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, beta-galactosidase, and acetylcholinesterase; examples of suitable prosthetic group complexes include streptavidin/biotin and avidin/biotin; examples of suitable fluorescent materials include umbelliferone, fluorescein, fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, dichlorotriazinylamine fluorescein, dansyl chloride and phycoerythrin; an example of a luminescent material includes luminol; examples of bioluminescent materials include luciferase, luciferin, and aequorin; and examples of suitable radioactive material include iodine (\n121\nI, \n123\nI, \n125\nI, \n131\nI), carbon (\n14\nC), sulfur (\n35\nS), tritium (\n3\nH), indium (\n111\nIn, \n112\nIn, \n113m\nIn, \n115m\nIn), technetium (\n99\nTc, \n99m\nTc), thallium (\n201\nTi), gallium (\n68\nGa, \n67\nGa), palladium (\n103\nPd), molybdenum (\n99\nMo), xenon (\n133\nXe), fluorine (\n18\nF), \n153\nSm, \n177\nLu, \n159\nGd, \n149\nPm, \n140\nLa, \n175\nYb, \n166\nHo, \n90\nY, \n47\nSc, \n186\nRe, \n188\nRe, \n142\nPr, \n105\nRh, and \n97\nRu.\n\n\nIn other embodiments, the antibody of the invention can be conjugated to a therapeutic agent. Therapeutic agents include, but are not limited to, antimetabolites (e.g., methotrexate, 6-mercaptopurine, 6-thioguanine, cytarabine, 5-fluorouracil decarbazine), alkylating agents (e.g., mechlorethamine, thioepa chlorambucil, melphalan, carmustine (BSNU) and lomustine (CCNU), cyclothosphamide, busulfan, dibromomannitol, streptozotocin, mitomycin C, and cis-dichlorodiamine platinum (II) (DDP) cisplatin), anthracyclines (e.g., daunorubicin (formerly daunomycin) and doxorubicin), antibiotics (e.g., dactinomycin (formerly actinomycin), bleomycin, mithramycin, and anthramycin (AMC)), anti-mitotic agents (e.g., vincristine and vinblastine), and radionuclides. Examples of radionuclides useful as therapeutic agents include, but are not limited to, \n131\nI, \n177\nLu, \n90\nY, and \n186\nRe.\n\n\nTechniques for conjugating such therapeutic moieties to antibodies are well-known, see, e.g., Amon et al., “Monoclonal Antibodies For Immunotargeting Of Drugs In Cancer Therapy,” in \nMonoclonal Antibodies And Cancer Therapy\n, Reisfeld et al., eds., Alan R. Liss, Inc. (1985), pp. 243-256; Hellstrom et al., “Antibodies For Drug Delivery,” in \nControlled Drug Delivery, \n2nd Ed., Robinson et al., eds., Marcel Dekker, Inc. (1987), pp. 623-653; Thorpe, “Antibody Carriers Of Cytotoxic Agents In Cancer Therapy: A Review,” in \nMonoclonal Antibodies '\n84\n: Biological And Clinical Applications\n, Pinchera et al., eds. (1985), pp. 475-506; “Analysis, Results, And Future Prospective Of The Therapeutic Use Of Radiolabeled Antibody In Cancer Therapy,” in \nMonoclonal Antibodies For Cancer Detection And Therapy\n, Baldwin et al., eds., Academic Press (1985), pp. 303-316; and Thorpe et al., “The Preparation And Cytotoxic Properties of Antibody-Toxin Conjugates,” \nImmunol. Rev. \n62:119-158 (1982).\n\n\nThe present invention encompasses antibodies of the invention recombinantly fused or chemically conjugated (including both covalent and non-covalent conjugations) to a polypeptide of interest to generate fusion proteins. The fusion does not necessarily need to be direct, but can occur through linker sequences. The antibodies of the present invention can be fused to either the N- or C-terminus of the heterologous protein (e.g., immunoglobulin Fc polypeptide or human serum albumin polypeptide). For example, antibodies can be fused to albumin, such as recombinant human serum albumin (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,876,969, \nEP\n 0 413 622, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,766,883)), resulting in a chimeric polypeptide. In other embodiments, antibodies can be fused to the mature form of human serum albumin (i.e., amino acids 1-585 of human serum albumin as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 of \nEP Patent\n 0 322 094). In other embodiments, antibodies can be fused with polypeptide fragments comprising, or alternatively consisting of, amino acid residues 1-z of human serum albumin, where z is an integer from 369 to 419, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,766,883. Antibodies fused or conjugated to polypeptides or other molecules of interest can also be used in in vitro immunoassays and purification methods using methods known in the art. See e.g., Harbor et al., supra, and PCT publication WO 93/21232; EP 439,095; Naramura et al., \nImmunol. Lett. \n39:91-99 (1994); U.S. Pat. No. 5,474,981; Gillies et al., \nPNAS \n89:1428-1432 (1992); and Fell et al., \nJ. Immunol. \n146:2446-2452 (1991).\n\n\nThe antibodies can be fused to marker sequences, such as a peptide to facilitate purification. In some embodiments, the marker amino acid sequence is a hexa-histidine peptide, such as the tag provided in a pQE vector (QIAGEN, Inc., 9259 Eton Avenue, Chatsworth, Calif., 91311), among others, many of which are commercially available. As described in Gentz et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n86:821-824 (1989), for instance, hexa-histidine provides for convenient purification of the fusion protein. Other peptide tags useful for purification include, but are not limited to, the “HA” tag, which corresponds to an epitope derived from the influenza hemagglutinin protein (Wilson et al., \n \nCell\n \n3 7:767 (1984)), and the “flag” tag (Stratagene, Calif.).\n\n\nWhile the antibody conjugates of the invention can be used for modifying a given biological response, the therapeutic agent or drug moiety is not to be construed as being limited to classical chemical therapeutic agents. For example, the drug moiety can be a protein or polypeptide possessing a desired biological activity. Such proteins can include, for example, a toxin such as abrin, ricin A, pseudomonas exotoxin, or diphtheria toxin; a protein such as tumor necrosis factor, α-interferon, β-interferon, nerve growth factor, platelet derived growth factor, tissue plasminogen activator, an apoptotic agent, e.g., TNF-alpha, TNF-beta, AIM I (see, WO 97/33899), AIM II (see, WO 97/34911), Fas Ligand (Takahashi et al., \nInt. Immunol. \n6:1567-1574 (1994)), VEGI (see, WO 99/23105), a thrombotic agent or an anti-angiogenic agent, e.g., angiostatin or endostatin; or, biological response modifiers such as, for example, lymphokines, interleukin-1 (“IL-1”), interleukin-2 (“IL-2”), interleukin-6 (“IL-6”), granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (“GM-CSF”), granulocyte colony stimulating factor (“G-CSF”), or other growth factors.\n\n\nAntibodies of the invention can also be attached to solid supports, which are useful for immunoassays or purification of the target antigen. Such solid supports include, but are not limited to, glass, cellulose, polyacrylamide, nylon, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride and polypropylene.\n\n\nAlternatively, the antibody of the invention can be conjugated to a second antibody to form an antibody heteroconjugate as described, e.g., in U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980.\n\n\nAssays for Antibody Binding\n\n\nThe antibodies of the invention can be assayed for immunospecific binding by any suitable method known in the art. The immunoassays that can be used include but are not limited to competitive and non-competitive assay systems using techniques such as BIAcore analysis, FACS (Fluorescence activated cell sorter) analysis, immunofluorescence, immunocytochemistry, Western blots, radio-immunoassays, ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay), “sandwich” immunoassays, immunoprecipitation assays, precipitin reactions, gel diffusion precipitin reactions, immunodiffusion assays, agglutination assays, complement-fixation assays, immunoradiometric assays, fluorescent immunoassays, protein A immunoassays, to name but a few. Such assays are routine and well known in the art (see e.g., Ausubel et al, eds, \nCurrent Protocols in Molecular Biology\n, Vol. 1, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York (1994)). Exemplary immunoassays are described briefly below (but are not intended by way of limitation).\n\n\nImmunoprecipitation protocols generally comprise lysing a population of cells in a lysis buffer such as RIPA buffer (1% NP-40 or Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.01 M sodium phosphate at pH 7.2, 1% Trasylol) supplemented with protein phosphatase and/or protease inhibitors (e.g., EDTA, PMSF, aprotinin, sodium vanadate), adding the antibody of interest to the cell lysate, incubating for a period of time (e.g., 1-4 hours) at 4° C., adding protein A and/or protein G sepharose beads to the cell lysate, incubating for about an hour or more at 4° C., washing the beads in lysis buffer and resuspending the beads in SDS/sample buffer. The ability of the antibody of interest to immunoprecipitate a particular antigen can be assessed by, e.g., Western blot analysis. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the binding of the antibody to an antigen and decrease the background (e.g., pre-clearing the cell lysate with sepharose beads). For further discussion regarding immunoprecipitation protocols, see e.g., Ausubel et al., eds, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York (1994), at 10.16.1.\n\n\nWestern blot analysis generally comprises preparing protein samples, electrophoresis of the protein samples in a polyacrylamide gel (e.g., 8%-20% SDS-PAGE depending on the molecular weight of the antigen), transferring the protein sample from the polyacrylamide gel to a membrane such as nitrocellulose, PVDF or nylon, blocking the membrane in blocking solution (e.g., PBS with 3% BSA or non-fat milk), washing the membrane in washing buffer (e.g., PBS-Tween 20), incubating the membrane with primary antibody (the antibody of interest) diluted in incubating buffer, washing the membrane in washing buffer, incubating the membrane with a secondary antibody (which recognizes the primary antibody, e.g., an anti-human antibody) conjugated to an enzymatic substrate (e.g., horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase) or radioactive molecule (e.g., \n32\nP or \n125\nI diluted in incubating buffer, washing the membrane in wash buffer, and detecting the presence of the antigen. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the signal detected and to reduce the background noise. For further discussion regarding Western blot protocols, see e.g., Ausubel et al., eds, \nCurrent Protocols in Molecular Biology\n, Vol. 1, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York (1994) at 10.8.1.\n\n\nELISAs comprise preparing antigen, coating the well of a 96-well microtiter plate with the antigen, adding the antibody of interest conjugated to a detectable compound such as an enzymatic substrate (e.g., horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase) to the well and incubating for a period of time, and detecting the presence of the antigen. In ELISAs the antibody of interest does not have to be conjugated to a detectable compound; instead, a second antibody (which recognizes the antibody of interest) conjugated to a detectable compound can be added to the well. Further, instead of coating the well with the antigen, the antibody can be coated to the well. In this case, a second antibody conjugated to a detectable compound can be added following the addition of the antigen of interest to the coated well. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the signal detected as well as other variations of ELISAs known in the art. For further discussion regarding ELISAs see, e.g., Ausubel et al., eds, \nCurrent Protocols in Molecular Biology\n, Vol. 1, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York (1994) at 11.2.1.\n\n\nThe binding affinity of an antibody to an antigen and the off-rate of an antibody-antigen interaction can be determined by competitive binding assays. One example of a competitive binding assay is a radioimmunoassay comprising the incubation of labeled antigen (e.g., \n3\nH or \n125\nI), or fragment or variant thereof, with the antibody of interest in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled antigen, and the detection of the antibody bound to the labeled antigen. The affinity of the antibody of interest for hTF and the binding off-rates can be determined from the data by Scatchard plot analysis. Competition with a second antibody can also be determined using radioimmunoassays. In this case, the hTF is incubated with the antibody of interest conjugated to a labeled compound (e.g., compound labeled with \n3\nH or \n125\nI in the presence of increasing amounts of an unlabeled second antibody. This kind of competitive assay between two antibodies can also be used to determine if two antibodies bind the same or different epitopes.\n\n\nBlood Coagulation\n\n\nBlood coagulation is a complex process involving three interacting components: blood vessels, blood coagulation factors, and blood platelets. Blood coagulation factors are proteins or glycoproteins present in the blood as inactive precursors. When bleeding occurs, the coagulation cascade is initiated and the inactive coagulation factors are converted to active proteases or enzymes.\n\n\nCoagulation factors are activated in sequence in the coagulation cascade, with the aid of cofactors (such as calcium, TF, and phospholipids), resulting in the eventual formation of a fibrin clot. Fibrin is a sticky, thread-like protein that is insoluble in blood and provides the foundation for platelet adhesion and blood coagulation.\n\n\nIf bleeding results from an injury outside of the vasculature (such as an abrasion or cut of the skin), the extrinsic pathway is initiated. If injury occurs within the blood vessel itself, the intrinsic pathway is activated. Many bleeding episodes activate both pathways.\n\n\nThe extrinsic coagulation pathway is triggered on the extravascular cell surface when TF is exposed to blood following some physical injury. TF is a protein that can bind to both activated and inactivated forms of factor VII. In the extrinsic pathway, a small amount of circulating activated factor VII (factor VIIa) complexes with TF following its release. This TF/factor VIIa complex initiates coagulation by converting factors IX and X to active forms.\n\n\nThis reaction is amplified by a feedback mechanism in which factors VIIa, IXa and Xa activate additional factor VII bound to TF. Factor Xa, in complex with a cofactor, factor Va, and phospholipids, continues in the cascade activating prothrombin (also known as factor II) to thrombin (also known as factor IIa). Another feedback mechanism involving thrombin works to activate factors V, VIII and XI. Factor VIIIa complexes with factor IXa on platelet surfaces to activate factor X, resulting in more local thrombin generation. Thrombin is responsible for the eventual generation of fibrin.\n\n\nIn the intrinsic pathway, circulating activated factor XII, in complex with high molecular weight kininogen and prekallikrein, comes into contact with the exposed subendothelial membrane to initiate coagulation and activate factor XI. Factor XIa complexes with calcium to activate factor IX. Factor IXa, in conjunction with factor VIIIa, calcium and phospholipids, results in the activation of factor X to factor Xa and subsequent thrombin generation. After activation of factor X, the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways merge.\n\n\nThe final step of clot formation is the conversion of plasma soluble fibrinogen to insoluble fibrin as a result of the cleavage of peptide bonds. Cleavage occurs as the result of the proteolytic enzyme thrombin, which is produced from prothrombin. Conversion of prothrombin to thrombin requires a number of proteins called clotting factors, in addition to calcium. The fibrin clot is a crosslinked matrix, which entraps the formed elements of the blood thereby sealing off the site of bleeding. Formed elements consist of platelets, white blood cells, and red blood cells.\n\n\nTF is a cell-anchored component that, together with factor VIIa, initiates blood coagulation in vivo. TF is a transmembrane glycoprotein with a 219 residue extracellular region, a 23 residue transmembrane region and a 21 residue cytoplasmic region. The extracellular region of TF has two fibronectin III-like domains and a distribution of disulfide bridges characteristic of class-II cytokine and interferon receptors. The cytoplasmic region of TF is short but contains at least one serine residue that can be phosphorylated. TF is also known as thromboplastin, factor III, and CD142.\n\n\nTF forms a tight complex (K\nd\n˜pmol) with its native ligand, i.e., factor VIIa. In the complex, VIIa wraps around TF (Banner, D. W., et al., \nNature \n380:41-46 (1996)) and forms an extensive region of contact with the TF surface. TF binds and allosterically activates factor VIIa (fVIIa) and the complex TF/fVIIa is responsible for thrombin generation via activation of factors IX and X and is the major initiator of blood clotting under physiological conditions. Antibodies that bind to the TF-VIIa interaction site can inhibit TF-VIIa interaction, thus inhibiting or blocking blood coagulation. The antibodies of the present invention bind to TF, e.g., hTF, but do not inhibit TF mediated blood coagulation compared to a normal plasma control.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “normal plasma control” means plasma pooled from normal human donors, such as that offered by George King Bio-Medical, Inc., Kansas (POOLED NORMAL PLASMA).\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the effect an antibody of the invention has on TF mediated blood coagulation can be determined using a blood clotting assay. For example, blood clotting assays known in the art, such as those described in, e.g., Morrissey, J. H., et al., \nThrombosis Research \n52:247-261 (1988), and Fang, C. H., et al., \nThrombosis and Haemostasis \n76:361-368 (1996), can be used to determine the effect of an anti-TF antibody on blood coagulation. Other blood clotting assays include, but are not limited to, one-stage prothrombin time assay (Miale J. B., \nLaboratory Medicine, Hematology\n, CN Mosbey Co., St. Louis (1977), and two-stage clotting assay (Bach et al., \nBiochemistry \n15:4007-20 (1986)) can also be used.\n\n\nAn antibody of the invention “does not inhibit TF mediated blood coagulation compared to a normal plasma control” where, in an hTF coagulation assay conducted as described in the Example section below, the clotting time of a blood sample treated with the antibody is about 150% or less, about 140% or less, about 130% or less, about 120% or less, about 110% or less, or about 100% or less of the clotting time of a normal plasma control.\n\n\nFc-Mediated Mechanisms\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the antibodies of the invention which are capable of binding to hTF without inhibiting TF mediated blood coagulation compared to a normal plasma control, can initiate one or more Fc-mediated mechanisms.\n\n\nWhen antibodies are exposed to proteolytic enzymes such as papain or pepsin, several major fragments are produced. The fragments that retain antigen-binding ability consist of the two “arms” of the antibody's Y configuration and are termed F(ab) (fragment-antigen binding) or F(ab′)\n2 \nwhich represent two Fab arms linked by disulfide bonds. The other major fragment produced constitutes the single “tail” or central axis of the Y and is termed Fc (fragment-crystalline) for its propensity to crystallize from solution. The Fc fragment of IgG, IgA, IgM, or IgD consists of dimers of the two carboxyl-terminal domains of each antibody (i.e., CH2 and CH3 in IgG, IgA and IgD, and CH3 and CH4 in IgM). The IgE Fc fragment, by contrast, consists of a dimer of its three-carboxyl-terminal heavy chain domains (C2, C3 and C4).\n\n\nThe Fc fragment contains the antibody's biologically “active site,” which enables the antibody to “communicate” with other immune system molecules or cells and thereby activate and regulate immune system defensive functions or host-mediated mechanisms. Such communication occurs when active sites within the antibody Fc region binds to molecules termed Fc receptors. Fc receptors are molecules that bind with high affinity and specificity to active sites within immunoglobulin Fc regions. Fc receptors can exist as integral membrane proteins within a cell's outer plasma membrane or can exist as free, “soluble” molecules that freely circulate in blood plasma or other body fluids.\n\n\nFor each of the five antibody classes, there are several types of Fc receptors that specifically bind to the Fc region of that class and perform distinct functions. Thus, IgE Fc receptors bind with high affinity to only IgE Fc regions or to isolated IgE Fc fragments. It is known that different types of class-specific Fc receptors exist, which recognize and bind to different locations within the Fc region. For example, certain IgG Fc receptors bind exclusively to the second constant domain of IgG (CH2), while Fc receptors mediating other immune functions bind exclusively to IgG's third constant domain (CH3). Other IgG Fc receptors bind to active sites located in both CH2 and CH3 domains and are unable to bind to a single, isolated domain.\n\n\nMany of the functions of antibodies are mediated through their interaction with Fc receptors. These receptors are found on a variety of cells including macrophages, other leukocytes, platelets and placental trophoblasts.\n\n\nAfter antibodies bind to antigens or are otherwise caused to aggregate, active sites within the Fc region are able to bind to and activate Fc receptors, providing a critical link between antibodies and the rest of the immune system. Fc binding to Fc receptors can thus be characterized as the “final common pathway” by which antibody functions are mediated. If an antigen-bound antibody does not bind to an Fc receptor, the antibody is unable to activate the other portions of the immune system and is therefore rendered functionally inactive.\n\n\nThe Fc region of the immunoglobulin binds to the Fc receptor and the complex can trigger a variety of responses depending on cell type. In the case of macrophages, the response can include phagocytosis and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). Once activated by the binding of antibody Fc region active sites, Fc receptors mediate a variety of important immune killing and regulatory functions. For example, certain IgG Fc receptors mediate direct killing of cells to which the antibody has bound via its Fab arms (antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)). Other IgG Fc receptors, when occupied by IgG, stimulate certain white blood cells to engulf and destroy bacteria, viruses, cancer cells or other entities by a process known as phagocytosis. Fc receptors on certain types of white blood cells known as B lymphocytes regulate their growth and development into antibody-secreting plasma cells.\n\n\nDepending upon the particular type of Fc receptor to which an Fc portion of an antibody or active peptide fragment thereof binds, the peptide can either initiate or inhibit immune functions. Initiation can occur if the Fc receptor is of the type that becomes activated by the act of binding to an Fc region or, alternatively, if an Fc active site peptide stimulates the receptor. The type of initiation produced can include, but is not limited to, functions directly or indirectly mediated by antibody Fc region-Fc receptor binding.\n\n\nThe ability to initiate immune system functions, including those listed above, is known to be therapeutically useful in treating diseases such as infectious diseases caused by bacteria, viruses or fingi, conditions in which the immune system is deficient due either to congenital or acquired conditions, cancer and many other afflictions of human beings or animals. Such immunostimulation is also useful to boost the body's protective cellular and antibody response to certain injected or orally administered substances administered as vaccines. This list is not intended to be all-inclusive, but merely provides representative examples of diseases or conditions in which immune stimulation has a recognized therapeutic usefulness.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “Fc-mediated mechanism” refers to the initiation of an immune response to foreign antigens, mediated through Fc receptor activation. Fc-mediated mechanisms include, but are not limited to, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC).\n\n\nIn some embodiments, where the antibody of the invention can initiate Fc-mediated mechanisms, that mechanism is antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). In yet other embodiments, the antibody of the invention can initiate complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC).\n\n\nAntibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) is a process by which natural killer cells, T lymphocytes, monocytes/macrophages and polymorphonuclear neutrophils (effector cells) are triggered to destroy foreign or infectious cells. IgG antibodies must first bind to antigens on the target cell, which sensitizes the cell for recognition by cells that mediate ADCC. Upon encounter with an IgG-sensitized target, IgG Fc receptors on cells that mediate ADCC bind to exposed Fc regions on the surface of the target cell. Such Fc receptor binding activates cells that mediate ADCC to directly lyse the target cell, causing its death. ADCC includes, but is not limited to, stimulation of phagocytosis by certain classes of white blood cells (polymorphonuclear neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages); macrophage activation; natural killer (NK) cell activity; growth and development of B and T lymphocytes and secretion by lymphocytes of lymphokines (molecules with killing or immunoregulatory activities).\n\n\nComplement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) (or complement-mediated cytotoxicity, or complement-mediated cell lysis) is another process by which foreign or infectious agents can be destroyed. An antibody interaction with a foreign antigen, forming an antibody-antigen complex, can result in a conformational change in the Fc region of the antibody. This conformational change may activate complement factor C1, thereby initiating a complement activation cascade involving complement initiation factors C1, C2, C3, and C4. The complement activation cascade terminates in the sequential interaction of C5, C6, C7, C8 and C9 forming the membrane-attack complex (MAC). MAC mediates cell lysis by disrupting the phospholipid membrane of a cell to form large pores in the cell membrane. See, e.g., Reff, M. E. et al. \nBlood \n83:435-445 (1994). In this way, the MAC complex is capable of stimulating cell death of a foreign or infectious agent containing an antigen recognized by an antibody of the invention. In addition, C3 and C4 can act as peptide mediators of inflammation, a process that results in localized vasodilation and migration of neutrophils, macrophages and other phagocytic cells. These phagocytic cells can bear Fc receptors, thereby increasing localized antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the antibody of the invention contains moderate to high Fc-mediated activity, including, but not limited to, moderate to high ADCC and/or moderate to high CDC activity. An antibody of the invention has “moderate to high” ADCC activity if at an antibody concentration of 10 μg/ml and effector cell to target cell ratio of 30, at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, or at least about 90% of target cells are lysed. An antibody of the invention has “moderate to high” CDC activity if at an antibody concentration of 10 μg/ml and in the presence of undiluted human serum or rabbit serum, at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, or at least about 90% of target cells are lysed.\n\n\nAny of the known assays in the art can be used to monitor the Fc-mediated mechanisms of the antibodies of the invention. The ability of the antibodies of the present invention to initiate one or more Fc-mediated mechanisms can be monitored in vitro or in vivo. For example, CDC activity and ADCC activity of the antibodies can be measured by the methods of Ohta et al., \nCancer Immunol. Immunother. \n36:260 (1993). Other assays include but are not limited to a \n51\nCr release assay of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and complement-mediate lysis can also be used. See \nCurrent Protocols in Immunology\n, Coligan, A. M. et al. (Eds.), Wiley & Sons, Inc. (1991), e.g., Unit 7.27; Wang, B. et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n96:1627-1632 (1999); Manches, O. et al., \nBlood \n101:949-954 (2003).\n\n\nFurthermore, Fc-mediated host responses can be monitored in vitro by conventional immunoassays, where the anti-tumor activity of the response can be determined by CDC and/or ADCC assays. The assay methodologies are well known, and are described in Handbook of Experimental Immunology, Vol. 2, Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford (1986). In addition, CDC activity and ADCC activity of humanized chimeric antibody to a cultured cancer cell line can be measured in accordance with the procedures disclosed in Menekigaku Jikken Nyumon, (Manual of Immunological Experiments) Matsuhashi et al., Gakkai Shuppan Center, Japan, 1981).\n\n\nFc-mediated mechanisms can be monitored in vivo by the development of delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions, or other in vivo or in vitro means known to those skilled in the art, including but not limited to the skin test reaction protocol, lymphocyte stimulation assays, measuring the toxicity of a subject's lymphocytes to tumor cells by using a standard radioactive release assay, by a limiting dilution assay, or by measuring plasma levels of IL-2 using standard ELISA assays.\n\n\nTherapeutic Uses\n\n\nThe present invention is also directed to a method of treating cancer in a patient, the method comprising administering to a patient in need of such treatment a therapeutically effective amount of the antibody of the invention. In some embodiments, this antibody-based therapy involves administering antibodies of the invention to an animal, more particularly a mammal, and more particularly a human patient, for treating cancer.\n\n\nA “therapeutically effective amount” is an amount of a compound that, when administered to a subject or patient for treating a condition, disorder or disease, is sufficient to elicit a cellular response that is clinically significant, without excessive levels of side effects. See, “Formulations and Therapeutic Administration” section, infra, for further details.\n\n\n“Subject” refers to any animal classified as a mammal, including humans, domestic and farm animals, and zoo, sports, and companion animals such as a household pet and other domesticated animal such as, but not limited to, cattle, sheep, ferrets, swine, horses, poultry, rabbits, goats, dogs, cats and the like. In some embodiments, companion animals are dogs and cats. In other embodiments, the subject is human.\n\n\n“Patient” refers to a subject, e.g., a human, in need of treatment of a condition, disorder or disease, e.g., cancer.\n\n\nThe terms “treat” and “treatment” refer to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures, wherein the object is to prevent, inhibit, or slow down (lessen) an undesired physiological condition, disorder or disease or obtain beneficial or desired clinical results. For purposes of this invention, beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to, alleviation of symptoms; diminishment of extent of condition, disorder or disease; stabilized (i.e., not worsening) state of condition, disorder or disease; delay in onset, or slowing, of condition, disorder or disease progression; amelioration of the condition, disorder or disease state, remission (whether partial or total); or enhancement or improvement of condition, disorder or disease. Treatment also includes, but is not limited to, eliciting a cellular response that is clinically significant, without excessive levels of side effects. Treatment also includes, but is not limited to, prolonging survival as compared to expected survival if not receiving treatment.\n\n\nTherapeutic compounds of the invention include, but are not limited to, antibodies of the invention and nucleic acids encoding antibodies of the invention. The antibodies of the invention can be used to treat disorders or conditions associated with cancer including, but not limited to, any one or more of the diseases, disorders, or conditions described herein. Antibodies of the invention can be provided in pharmaceutically acceptable compositions as known in the art or as described herein.\n\n\nThe terms “tumor” and “cancer” are used interchangeably, and, along with their grammatical variants, refer to tumors of any cell type, including carcinomas, sarcomas, lymphomas and leukemias of any human and non-human animal species including swine, cats, dogs and higher primates. The methods and compositions of the present invention are suitable for the treatment of solid tumors, which can be characterized by extensive vasculature (microvascularized tumors), including carcinomas, sarcomas and lymphomas of various cell types. Solid tumors targeted by the treatment of the present invention include, but are not limited to: cancers of head and neck, including squamous cell and epidermoid carcinomas; adenocarcinomas, including prostatic, scirrhous, and mammary adenocarcinomas; lymphosarcoma; fibrosarcoma; leiomyosarcoma; chondroma; cancer of the prostate, lung, breast, ovary, stomach, pancreas, larynx, esophagus, testes, liver, parotid, biliary tract, colon, rectum, cervix, uterus, endometrium, kidney, bladder, or thyroid; primary tumors and metastases; melanomas; glioblastoma; Kaposi's sarcoma; non-small cell lung cancer; advanced malignancies; and blood born tumors such as, e.g., leukemias.\n\n\nMalignant and metastatic conditions that can be treated with the antibodies of the invention include, but are not limited to, malignancies, solid tumors, and cancers described herein and otherwise known in the art (for a review of such disorders, see Fishman et al., \nMedicine, \n2d Ed., J. B. Lippincott Co., Philadelphia (1985)). Thus, antibodies of the invention can be useful in treating other diseases, disorders, and/or conditions, besides cancers, which involve angiogenesis. These diseases, disorders, and/or conditions include, but are not limited to: benign tumors, for example hemangiomas, acoustic neuromas, neurofibromas, trachomas, and pyogenic granulomas; artheroscleric plaques; ocular angiogenic diseases, for example, diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, macular degeneration, corneal graft rejection, neovascular glaucoma, retrolental fibroplasia, rubeosis, retinoblastoma, uvietis and Pterygia (abnormal blood vessel growth) of the eye; rheumatoid arthritis; psoriasis; delayed wound healing; endometriosis; vasculogenesis; granulations; hypertrophic scars (keloids); nonunion fractures; scleroderma; trachoma; vascular adhesions; myocardial angiogenesis; coronary collaterals; cerebral collaterals; arteriovenous malformations; ischemic limb angiogenesis; Osler-Webber Syndrome; plaque neovascularization; telangiectasia; hemophiliac joints; angiofibroma; fibromuscular dysplasia; wound granulation; Crohn's disease; and atherosclerosis.\n\n\nTreatment of metastases can be shown by the ability of the antibody of the invention to prevent tumor metastases in an animal model. For example, the spontaneous metastases model and the pulmonary metastases tumor model are metastases models known in the art. In the spontaneous metastases tumor model, an animal is subcutaneously injected with tumor cells which form a primary tumor mass. Subsequently, some of the cells of the tumor spontaneously migrate to other parts of the animal, including the lung. See Zisman, A. et al., \nCancer Research \n63:4952-59 (2003); Lev, D. C. et al., \nClin. Exp. Metas. \n20:515-23 (2003). In the pulmonary metastases tumor model, a suspension of tumor cells is injected into the tail vein a mouse and the formation of metastases in the lungs of the recipient animal is evaluated. See Tian F. et al, \nCancer Research \n63:8284-92 (2003); Ogawa, K. et al., \nInt. J. Cancer \n91:797-802 (2001). In these models, an antibody that is effective in the treatment of metastases will, upon its administration to the recipient animal, either prevent metastases from occurring or reduce the number of metastases that form as compared to the number of metastases formed in a recipient animal given a negative control.\n\n\nThe antibody of the invention can be used to treat and/or diagnose hyperproliferative diseases, disorders, and/or conditions, including neoplasms. The antibody can inhibit proliferation of the disorder through direct or indirect interactions. For example, by increasing an immune response, particularly increasing antigenic qualities of the hyperproliferative disorder or by proliferating, differentiating, or mobilizing T-cells, hyperproliferative diseases, disorders, and/or conditions can be treated, and/or diagnosed. This immune response can be increased by either enhancing an existing immune response, or by initiating a new immune response.\n\n\nExamples of hyperproliferative diseases, disorders, and/or conditions that can be treated, and/or diagnosed by the antibodies of the invention, include, but are not limited to, neoplasms located in the colon, lung, abdomen, bone, breast, digestive system, liver, pancreas, peritoneum, endocrine glands (adrenal, parathyroid, pituitary, testicles, ovary, thymus, thyroid), eye, head and neck, nervous system (central and peripheral), lymphatic system, pelvic, skin, soft tissue, spleen, thoracic, and urogenital systems.\n\n\nSimilarly, other hyperproliferative diseases, disorders, and/or conditions can be treated and/or diagnosed by antibodies of the invention. Examples of such hyperproliferative diseases, disorders, and/or conditions include, but are not limited to, hypergammaglobulinemia, lymphoproliferative diseases, disorders, and/or conditions, paraproteinemias, purpura, sarcoidosis, Sezary Syndrome, Waldenstron's Macroglobulinemia, Gaucher's Disease, histiocytosis, and any other hyperproliferative disease, besides neoplasia, located in an organ system listed above.\n\n\nThe present invention provides for treatment of diseases, disorders, and/or conditions associated with neovascularization by administration of the antibodies of the invention. The naturally occurring balance between endogenous stimulators and inhibitors of angiogenesis is one in which inhibitory influences predominate. Rastinejad et al., \nCell \n56:345-355 (1989). In those rare instances in which neovascularization occurs under normal physiological conditions, such as wound healing, organ regeneration, embryonic development, and female reproductive processes, angiogenesis is stringently regulated and spatially and temporally delimited. Under conditions of pathological angiogenesis such as that characterizing solid tumor growth, these regulatory controls fail. Unregulated angiogenesis becomes pathologic and sustains progression of many neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases. A number of serious diseases are dominated by abnormal neovascularization including solid tumor growth and metastases, arthritis, some types of eye diseases, disorders and/or conditions, and psoriasis. See, e.g., reviews by Moses et al., \nBiotech. \n9:630-634 (1991); Folkman et al., \nN. Engl. J. Med., \n333:1757-1763 (1995); Auerbach et al., \nJ. Microvasc. Res. \n29:401-411 (1985); Folkman, Advances in Cancer Research, eds. Klein and Weinhouse, Academic Press, New York (1985), pp. 175-203; Patz, \nAm. J. Opthalmol. \n94:715-743 (1982); and Folkman et al., \nScience \n221:719-725 (1983). In a number of pathological conditions, the process of angiogenesis contributes to the disease state. For example, significant data has been accumulated suggesting that the growth of solid tumors is dependent on angiogenesis. Folkman and Klagsbrun, \nScience \n235:442-447 (1987).\n\n\nAdditional ways in which the antibodies of the present invention can be used therapeutically include, but are not limited to, directed cytotoxicity of the antibody, e.g., as mediated by complement (CDC) or by effector cells (ADCC), or indirect cytotoxicity of the antibody, e.g., as immunoconjugates.\n\n\nThe antibodies of this invention can be advantageously utilized in combination with other monoclonal or chimeric antibodies, or with lymphokines or hematopoietic growth factors (such as, e.g., IL-2, IL-3 and IL-7), for example, which serve to increase the number or activity of effector cells which interact with the antibodies, or as conjugated to a cytotoxic agent such as a radioisotope or other cytotoxic agent as described above.\n\n\nThe antibodies of the invention can be administered alone or in combination with other types of treatments (e.g., radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, anti-tumor agents, and anti-retroviral agents). In some embodiments, antibodies of the invention can be administered alone or in combination with anti-retroviral agents.\n\n\nFormulations, Therapeutic Administration, and Kits\n\n\nThe invention also provides methods of treatment by administration to a subject of an effective amount of a compound, e.g., an antibody of the invention, or a pharmaceutical composition of the invention. In some embodiments, the antibody is substantially purified (e.g., substantially free from substances that limit its effect or produce undesired side-effects). The antibody can be conjugated to a cytotoxic agent.\n\n\nFormulations and methods of administration that can be employed when the compound comprises an immunoglobulin are described herein; additional appropriate formulations and routes of administration can be selected from among those described herein below.\n\n\nVarious delivery systems are known and can be used to administer the compound or pharmaceutical composition of the invention, e.g., encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, microcapsules, recombinant cells capable of expressing the compound, receptor-mediated endocytosis (see e.g., Wu and Wu, \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n262:4429-4432 (1987)), construction of a nucleic acid as part of a retroviral or other vector, etc. Methods of introduction include but are not limited to intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal, epidural, and oral routes. The compounds or compositions can be administered by any convenient route, for example, by infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings (e.g., oral mucosa, rectal and intestinal mucosa, etc.) and can be administered together with other biologically active agents. Administration can be systemic or local. In addition, it can be desirable to introduce the pharmaceutical compounds or compositions of the invention into the central nervous system by any suitable route, including intraventricular and intrathecal injection; intraventricular injection can be facilitated by an intraventricular catheter, for example, attached to a reservoir, such as an Ommaya reservoir. Pulmonary administration can also be employed, e.g., by use of an inhaler or nebulizer, and formulation with an aerosolizing agent.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, it can be desirable to administer the pharmaceutical compounds or compositions of the invention locally to the area in need of treatment; this can be achieved, for example, and not by way of limitation, by local infusion during surgery, topical application, e.g., in conjunction with a wound dressing after surgery, by injection, by means of a catheter, by means of a suppository, or by means of an implant, the implant being of a porous, non-porous, or gelatinous material, including membranes, such as sialastic membranes, or fibers. When administering a protein, including an antibody, of the invention, care must be taken to use materials to which the protein does not adsorb.\n\n\nIn other embodiments, the compound or composition can be delivered in a vesicle, in particular a liposome (see, Langer, \nScience \n249:1527-1533 (1990); Treat et al., in \nLiposomes in the Therapy of Infectious Disease and Cancer\n, Lopez-Berestein and Fidler, eds., Liss, New York (1989), pp. 353-365; Lopez-Berestein, ibid., pp. 317-327; see generally ibid.)\n\n\nIn yet other embodiments, the compound or composition can be delivered in a controlled release system. In some embodiments, a pump can be used (see Langer, supra; Sefton, \nCRC Crit. Ref. Biomed. Eng. \n14:201 (1987); Buchwald et al., \nSurgery \n88:507 (1980); Saudek et al., \nN. Engl. J. Med. \n321:574 (1989)). In other embodiments, polymeric materials can be used (see \nMedical Applications of Controlled Release\n, Langer and Wise, eds., CRC Pres., Boca Raton, Fla. (1974); \nControlled Drug Bioavailability, Drug Product Design and Performance\n, Smolen and Ball, eds., Wiley, New York (1984); Ranger and Peppas, \nJ., Macromol. Sci. Rev. Macromol. Chem. \n23:61 (1983); see also Levy et al., \nScience \n228:190 (1985); During et al, \nAnn. Neurol. \n25:351 (1989); Howard et al., \nJ. Neurosurg. \n71:105 (1989)). In yet other embodiments, a controlled release system can be placed in proximity of the therapeutic target, i.e., the brain, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose (see, e.g., Goodson, in \nMedical Applications of Controlled Release\n, supra, vol. 2, pp. 115-138 (1984)). Other controlled release systems are discussed in the review by Langer, \nScience \n249:1527-1533 (1990).\n\n\nThe present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions. Such compositions comprise a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In some embodiments, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable” means approved by a regulatory agency of the Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or other generally recognized international pharmacopeia for use in animals, and more particularly in humans. The term “carrier” refers to a diluent, adjuvant, excipient, or vehicle with which the therapeutic is administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be sterile liquids, such as water and oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like. In some embodiments, water can be used as a carrier when the pharmaceutical composition is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients include starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene, glycol, water, ethanol and the like. The composition, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents. These compositions can take the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsions, tablets, pills, capsules, powders, sustained-release formulations and the like. The composition can be formulated as a suppository, with traditional binders and carriers such as triglycerides. Oral formulation can include standard carriers such as pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharine, cellulose, magnesium carbonate, etc. Examples of suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences \nby E. W. Martin. Such compositions will contain a therapeutically effective amount of the compound, preferably in purified form, together with a suitable amount of carrier so as to provide the form for proper administration to the patient. The formulation should suit the mode of administration.\n\n\nIn other embodiments, the composition is formulated in accordance with routine procedures as a pharmaceutical composition adapted for intravenous administration to human beings. Typically, compositions for intravenous administration are solutions in sterile isotonic aqueous buffer. Where necessary, the composition can also include a solubilizing agent and a local anesthetic such as lignocaine to ease pain at the site of the injection. Generally, the ingredients are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form, for example, as a dry lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent. Where the composition is to be administered by infusion, it can be dispensed with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where the composition is administered by injection, an ampoule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients can be mixed prior to administration.\n\n\nThe amount of the compound of the invention, which will be therapeutically effective in the treatment of the disease or disorder, e.g., cancer, can be determined by standard clinical techniques. In addition, in vitro assays can optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage ranges. The precise dose to be employed in the formulation will also depend on the route of administration, and the seriousness of the disease or disorder, and should be decided according to the judgment of the practitioner and each patient's circumstances. Effective doses can be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems.\n\n\nFor antibodies, the dosage administered to a patient is typically 0.1 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg of the patient's body weight. However, for radiolabeled antibodies, the dosage administered can be lower, e.g., 0.01 mg/kg to 1 mg/kg of the patient's body weight, and for toxin-immunoconjugates, the dosage administered can be even lower, e.g., 0.001 mg/kg of the patient's body weight. In some embodiments, the dosage administered to a patient is between 0.001 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg of the patient's body weight. In other embodiments, the dosage administered to a patient is between 0.01 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg of the patient's body weight. In other embodiments, the dosage administered to a patient is between 0.1 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg of the patient's body weight. In yet other embodiments, the dosage administered to a patient is between 1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg of the patient's body weight. Generally, human antibodies have a longer half-life within the human body than antibodies from other species due to the immune response to the foreign polypeptides. Thus, lower dosages of human antibodies and less frequent administration is often possible. Further, the dosage and frequency of administration of antibodies of the invention can be reduced by enhancing uptake and tissue penetration (e.g., into the brain) of the antibodies by modifications such as, for example, lipidation.\n\n\nThe invention also provides a kit comprising the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. The kit can include one or more containers filled with one or more of the ingredients of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention. Optionally associated with such container(s) can be a notice or printed instructions.\n\n\nFor example, such printed instructions can be in a form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture, use or sale of pharmaceuticals or biological products, which notice reflects approval by the agency of the manufacture, use or sale for human administration to treat a condition such as cancer. In some embodiments, the kit further comprises printed matter, which, e.g., provides information on the use of the pharmaceutical composition to treat cancer or a pre-recorded media device which, e.g., provides information on the use of the pharmaceutical composition to treat cancer, or a planner.\n\n\n“Printed matter” can be, for example, one of a book, booklet, brochure or leaflet. The printed matter can describe the use of the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention for the treatment of cancer. Possible formats included, but are not limited to, a bullet point list, a list of frequently asked questions (FAQ) or a chart. Additionally, the information to be imparted can be illustrated in non-textual terms using pictures, graphics or other symbols.\n\n\n“Pre-recorded media device” can be, for example, a visual media device, such as a videotape cassette, a DVD (digital video disk), filmstrip, 35 mm movie or any other visual media device. Alternately, pre-recorded media device can be an interactive software application, such as a CD-ROM (compact disk-read only memory) or floppy disk. Alternately, pre-recorded media device can be, for example, an audio media device, such as a record, audiocassette or audio compact disk. The information contained on the pre-recorded media device can describe the use of the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention for the treatment of cancer.\n\n\nA “planner” can be, for example, a weekly, a monthly, a multi-monthly, a yearly, or a multi-yearly planner. The planner can be used as a diary to monitor dosage amounts, to keep track of dosages administered, or to prepare for future events wherein taking a regularly administered pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may be difficult. Alternately, the planner can be a calendar which will provide a means to monitor when a dosage has been taken and when it has not been taken. This type of planner will be particularly useful for patients having unusual schedules for administering medication to themselves. Additionally, the planner can be useful for the elderly, children, or other patient group who may administer medication to themselves and may become forgetful. One skilled in the art will appreciate the variety of planning tools that would be appropriate for use with the present invention.\n\n\nThe kit can also include a container for storing the other components of the kit. The container can be, for example, a bag, box, envelope or any other container that would be suitable for use in the present invention. Preferably, the container is large enough to accommodate each component and/or any administrative devices that may be necessary of the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. However, in some cases, it may be desirable to have a smaller container which can be hidden in a patient's pocketbook, briefcase or pocket.\n\n\nMethods of Delivering the Pharmaceutical Composition of the Present Invention to a Patient\n\n\nThe present invention is also directed to a method of delivering a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of the antibody of the present invention to a patient in need thereof, the method comprising (a) registering in a computer readable medium the identity of a physician permitted to prescribe the pharmaceutical composition; (b) providing the patient with counseling information concerning the risks attendant to the pharmaceutical composition; (c) obtaining informed consent from the patient to receive the pharmaceutical composition despite the attendant risks; (d) registering the patient in a computer readable medium after obtaining their informed consent; and (e) permitting the patient access to the pharmaceutical composition.\n\n\nThe drug delivery methods of the present invention involve, inter alia, registering in a computer readable storage medium physicians who are qualified to prescribe the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. Once registered in the computer readable storage medium, the physician can be eligible to prescribe the pharmaceutical composition to a patient in need thereof. Generally speaking, in order to become registered in the computer readable storage medium, the physician may be required to comply with various aspects of, for example, providing patient education and counseling. The registration of the physician in the computer readable storage medium can be achieved by providing the physician, for example, by mail, facsimile transmission, or on-line transmission, with a registration card or form, preferably together with educational materials concerning the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. The physician can complete the registration card or form by providing information requested therein, and the registration card or form can be returned to the manufacturer or distributor of the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention, or other authorized recipient of the registration materials, for example, by mail, facsimile transmission or on-line transmission. The physician's information in the registration card or form is then entered into the computer readable storage medium. Suitable computer readable storage media which can be employed for registration of the physicians (as well as patients, as discussed below) will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art, once in possession of the teaching of the present application.\n\n\nIn the course of examination of a patient, including a patient suffering from cancer, the physician may determine that the patient's condition can be improved by the administration of the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. Prior to prescribing the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention, the physician can counsel the patient, for example, on the various risks and benefits associated with the pharmaceutical composition. The patient can be provided full disclosure of all the known and suspected risks associated with the pharmaceutical composition. Such counseling can be provided verbally, as well as in written form. In some embodiments, the physician can provide the patient with literature materials on the pharmaceutical composition, such as product information, educational materials, and the like.\n\n\nIn addition to receiving counseling on the risks attendant to the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention, the methods of the invention further require the patient to fill out an informed consent form which is signed by the patient. Upon the completion of the informed consent form, the patient can be registered in a computer readable storage medium. The computer readable storage medium in which the patient is registered can be the same as, or different from, the computer readable storage medium in which the physician is registered.\n\n\nThe registration into one or more computer readable storage media of the physician and patient, according to the methods describe herein, provides a means to monitor and authorize access to the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. Thus, the computer readable storage medium can serve to deny access to patients who fail to abide by the methods of the present invention. In some embodiments, access to the pharmaceutical composition of the invention is in the form of a prescription, wherein the prescribing physician is registered in a computer readable storage medium, has provided counseling to the patient concerning the attendant risks of the pharmaceutical composition, and has obtained informed consent from the patient, prior to prescribing the pharmaceutical composition to the patient in need thereof.\n\n\nMethods of Educating a Consumer Regarding the Pharmaceutical Composition of the Present Invention\n\n\nThe present invention is also directed to methods of educating consumers about the use of a pharmaceutical composition of the invention, the method comprising distributing the pharmaceutical composition with consumer information at a point of sale. In some embodiments, the distribution will occur at a point of sale having a pharmacist or healthcare provider.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “consumer information” can include, but is not limited to, an English language text, non-English language text, visual image, chart, telephone recording, website, and access to a live customer service representative. In some embodiments of the present invention, consumer information will provide directions for use of the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention, appropriate age use, indications, contraindications, or warnings.

Titan one Tube RT-PCR system was from Roche (Basel, Switzerland, Cat. # 1 855 476). Ni-NTA agarose was obtained from Qiagen (CA, Cat. # 30210) and Bio-GelP60 was from Bio-Rad (CA, Cat. # 150-4161). HiTrap protein G HP columns were purchased from Amersham (Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom, Cat. # 17-0404-01). Mouse anti-human TF mAb was obtained from Calbiochem (CA, Cat. # 612161). Pooled normal human plasma was from George King Bio-Medical Inc. (KA, Cat. # 0010-1). Cell dissociation solution was from Sigma (MO, Cat. # C-5914).\n\n\nConstruction of hTF Expression Vectors\n\n\nThe human tissue factor (hTF) gene was cloned from the human breast cancer cell line SKBR3 by RT-PCR. Briefly, 1 μg of total RNA was isolated from SKBR3 cells using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen Corp., CA, Cat. # 15596018) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The isolated RNA was reverse-transcribed and amplified with primer TF4 (5′ UTR-ACGGAACCCGCTCGATCTCG (SEQ ID NO:13)) and TF5 (3′ UTR-TGCAGTAGCTCCAACAGTGC (SEQ ID NO:14)) using the Titan one Tube RT-PCR system following the manufacturer's instructions. The first PCR product was further amplified using primers TF1 (5′-ATC TGC GGA TCC ACC ATG GAG ACC CCT GCC TGG CC-3′ (SEQ ID NO:15)) and TF3 (5′-ATC TGC CTC GAG TTA ATG GTG ATG GTG ATG GTG GGA TCC TCT TTC TCT GAA TTC CCC TTT CTC CTG-3′ (SEQ ID NO:16)) to generate a hTF DNA fragment encoding the extracellular domain of hTF with a 32 amino acid N-terminal leader sequence and a 9 amino acid C-terminus RGS-His\n6 \ntag sequence (soluble hTF). The soluble hTF contained 5′ BamHI and 3′ XhoI sites for insertion into expression vectors including a His-tag at the 3′ end for protein purification. The first PCR product was also used to generate a full-length hTF gene with primers TF1 and TF2 (5′-ATC TGC CTC GAG TTA ATG GTG ATG GTG ATG GTG GGA TCC TCT TGA AAC ATT CAG TGG GGA GTT CTC-3′ (SEQ ID NO:17)). The amplified soluble hTF and full-length hTF were cloned into the pCR4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen Corp., CA) for sequence analysis. The soluble hTF (SEQ ID NO:3) and full-length hTF (SEQ ID NO:1) encoding DNA fragments were also cloned into pCEP4 and pcDNA3.1 expression vectors (Invitrogen Corp., CA).\n\n\nExpression and Purification of Soluble hTF\n\n\n3×10\n5 \ncells/well of HEK293 cells were plated in a 6-well plate one day before transfection. Cells were transfected with 1 μg of soluble hTF/pCEP4 plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine plus reagent (Invitrogen Corp., CA) for 3 hours at 37° C. according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stably transfected cells were selected by culturing cells in DMEM medium containing G418 (750 μg/ml). Soluble hTF protein was then purified from 300 ml of culture medium using a 1 ml size Ni-agarose column and eluted with linear imidazole buffer gradient (between 5 mM and 100 mM imidazole in PBS buffer). The soluble hTF containing fractions were identified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis. The soluble hTF was further purified by gel filtration chromatography to remove contaminants. Briefly, samples were concentrated to about 100 μl with a Centrifugal Filter (Millipore, Mass., Cat. # UFV4BGC25) and loaded onto a 0.7×50 cm Bio-Gel P60 column in PBS. The protein was then eluted in PBS and 0.5 ml fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The soluble hTF band was verified by standard Western blotting using a mouse anti-hTF mAb (Calbiochem, Calif., Cat. # 612161). The fractions containing soluble hTF were combined.\n\n\nPreparation of Stable Full-Length hTF Expression Cell Line\n\n\nCHO-K1 cells were transfected with the full-length hTF/pcDNA3.1 plasmid (pTF103) using Lipofectamine plus reagent following the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen Corp., CA). Clones stably expressing full-length hTF were selected in the presence of 750 μg/ml of G418 containing DMEM medium. After one week of selection, resistant cells were removed from plates with Trypsin-EDTA solution and diluted with DMEM/G418 medium to a concentration of 3 cells/ml. 100 μl aliquots of the dilution were added into each well of one 96-well plate. Single cell clones were expanded and screened by FACS using a commercial anti-TF antibody (Calbiochem, Calif., Cat. # 612161).\n\n\nImmunization and Measurement of Polyclonal, Anti-hTF IgG Response in Mice\n\n\nA protocol for the rapid immunization of mice at multiple sites (RIMMS) has been previously described by Kilpatrick, K. E., et al., \nHyhridoma \n16:381-389 (1997), and was used to generate antibodies against hTF in mice. Briefly, each of three 8-week-old, female Balb/c mice received 4 rounds of subcutaneous injections of the purified soluble hTF (10 μg/ml) over a course of 11 days at intervals of 3-5 days. For each round of immunization, the mice were anesthetized and then injected subcutaneously with the immunogen in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) at 2 sites in the nape of the neck and bilaterally at the calf and groin injecting 40-50 μl per site and in RIBI's adjuvant (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) at juxtaposed sites (lower and mid calf, thigh, and axilla), at a dose of 40-50 μl per site. Blood samples were taken prior to the priming injections and two days after the last boost and assayed in an ELISA for an antibody response to the immunogen. In the ELISA, a 96-well ELISA plate was coated with the immunogen (2 μg/ml) at 100 μl/well in PBS, pH 7.4 at 37° C. for 2 hrs. The plate was washed once with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 (PBS-T) and blocked with 1% BSA in PBS at 150 μl/well at 37° C. for 30 min. Following one wash with PBS-T, preimmune and immune sera diluted in PBS-T were added to the plate at 100 μl/well. The plate was incubated at 37° C. for 45 min and washed three times with PBS-T. Then, 100 μl of a 1:5000 dilution of goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, Ala., Cat. # 1031-05) was added to each well. Following incubation at 37° C. for 30 min., the plate was washed with PBS-T three times. The antibody binding was visualized by adding 100 μl/well of TMB-H\n2\nO\n2 \nsubstrate buffer (Pierce, Rockford, Ill.). The reaction proceeded at room temperature for 10 min and was read using an ELISA plate reader at a wavelength of 650 nm. An antibody titer was defined as the reciprocal of serum dilution at which the O.D. reading was 2-fold higher than that of an internal negative control (wells with the secondary antibody only).\n\n\nAntibodies TF278, TF277, TF392, and TF9 were generated using the same methods as described supra, except that each of the three Balb/c mice received 5 rounds of subcutaneous injections of the purified soluble hTF (10 μg/ml) over a course of 11 days at intervals of 2-4 days.\n\n\nGeneration of Hybridomas\n\n\nTwo days after the final boost, the immunized mice whose sera had ELISA titers greater than 1:10,000 were euthanized by asphyxiation with carbon dioxide. Bilateral popliteal, superficial inguinal, axillary and branchial lymph nodes were isolated and washed with fresh medium containing penicillin and streptomycin. Then, a single cell suspension was prepared from the lymph nodes in serum-free medium composed of 50% Excell-610 and 50% RPMI-1640 media. The lymph node cell suspension was washed twice with the aforementioned medium and collected by centrifugation at 400×g for 10 minutes at room temperature. In a 50-ml conical polypropylene tube, the lymph node cells were then fused with mouse myeloma cells (P3X63/Ag8.653, ATCC, Manassas, Va.) at a ratio of 2.5:1 by adding 1 ml of 50% polyethylene glycol 1500 (PEG, Roche Bioscience, Palo Alto, Calif.). The resulting PEG-cell preparation was washed once and then resuspended in hybridoma medium (HM) containing a mixture of 50:50 Excell-610 and RPMI-1640, 10% FBS, 10% Origen Cloning Factor (Igen, Rockville, Md.), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and streptomycin and 0.01 mM beta-mercaptoethanol, and distributed into flat-bottom, 96-well plates at 2×10\n5 \ncells/100 μl/well. After incubating for 18 hours at 37° C. with 7% CO\n2\n, 100 μl of HM supplemented with 2×HAT (GIBCO-BRL, Grand Island, N.Y.) was added to each well. Media were changed 96 hr later to HM supplemented with 100 μM hypoxanthine and 16 μM thymidine. After 7 to 10 days of HAT selection, the plates were examined microscopically for hybridoma growth. Hybridomas from single colonies were further expanded individually in 24-well plates and the culture supernatants were screened by ELISA for mouse IgG antibodies specific for hTF (see below).\n\n\nPrimary Screening for Anti-hTF mAbs by ELISA\n\n\nBriefly, a 96-well ELISA plate was coated with 100 μl/well of 2 μg/ml soluble hTF in PBS, pH 7.4 at 37° C. for 2 hrs. The plate was washed once with PBS-T and blocked with 150 μl/well of PBS containing 1% BSA at 37° C. for 30 min. Following washing once with PBS-T, hybridoma supernatants were added to the plate at 100 μl/well. The plate was incubated at 37° C. for 45 min and washed three times with PBS-T. Then, 100 μl of a 1:5000 dilution of goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Southern Biotechnology, Cat. # 1031-05) was added to each well. Following incubation at 37° C. for 30 min., the plate was washed with PBS-T three times. Antibody binding was visualized by adding 100 μl of TMB-H\n2\nO\n2 \nsubstrate buffer to each well. The reaction proceeded at room temperature for 10 min and was read using an ELISA plate reader at a wavelength of 650 nm. A positive reaction was defined as an O.D. reading, which was 2-fold higher than that of an internal negative control (secondary Ab alone). All ELISA positive clones were further expanded in HM and cryopreserved.\n\n\nSecondary Screening for Anti-hTF mAbs by Flow Cytometry\n\n\nCells (CHO-K1) expressing full-length hTF were dissociated with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution, washed twice in cold PBS containing 2% FBS and 0.05% NaN\n3 \n(FACS buffer) at 400×g for 10 min. and then distributed into U-bottom, 96-well microtiter plates at 0.5×10\n6 \ncell/well. The cells were centrifuged at 200×g at 4° C. for 3 min. Following removal of supernatants by aspiration, the cells were resuspended in 70 μl of hybridoma supernatant. After incubation at 4° C. for 45 min., the cells were washed twice with cold FACS buffer, 220 μl/well, by centrifugation at 200×g for 3 min and resuspended in 50 μl of 1:25 FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Southern Biotechnology). The cells were incubated at 4° C. for 30 min and then washed three times with cold FACS buffer, 220 μl/well. Finally, cells were resuspended in 0.4 ml of FACS buffer, and their fluorescence intensities were measured on a flow cytometer (FACScan, Becton Dickinson) and analyzed using Cell Quest software (Becton Dickinson). A positive clone was identified as a clone where the percent positive cells in the FACS profile was at least 3-fold higher than the profile obtained when the cells were stained only with the FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG.\n\n\nBIAcore Analysis of Anti-hTF mAbs\n\n\nBinding properties of anti-hTF mAbs were evaluated using BIAcore X. Briefly, a CM5 BIAcore biosensor chip was docked into the instrument and activated with 55 μl of 1:1 NHS/EDC at room temperature. The recombinant soluble hTF and BSA (10 μg/ml in 0.05 M acetate buffer, pH 4.5) were immobilized on the activated chips in \n \nflow cells\n \n 1 and 2, respectively. The immobilization was carried out at a flow rate of 5 μl/min until a resonance response of 1000-2000 RU was achieved. The chip was then blocked by injection of 55 μl of ethanolamine-HCl, pH 8.5 followed by 5 washes with 50 mM NaOH, 1 M NaCl. To measure the binding of anti-hTF mAbs to the soluble hTF immobilized to the chip, 30 μl of anti-hTF mAbs at varying concentrations in BIAcore running buffer (HBS-EP, Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden, Cat. #1001-08) were injected over the sensor surface at a flow rate of μl/min. Following completion of the injection phase, dissociation was monitored in BIAcore running buffer at the same flow rate for 360 seconds. The surface was regenerated between injections using 30 μl of 50 mM NaOH-1 M NaCl. Individual sensorgrams were analyzed using BIAsimulation software. Representative data are shown in Tables 3 and 4.\n\n\nPreparation of TF Membrane Extract\n\n\nCHO-K1 cells (5×10\n7\n) expressing full-length hTF were harvested with cell dissociation solution and washed once with ice-cold 1×PBS. Cells were resuspended in 2 ml of membrane extraction buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH=8.0, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM PMSF, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin) and homogenized on ice with a Tissue Tearor tissue homogenizer (Biospec Products, Inc., Bartlesville, Okla.) three times for 30 seconds each. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 1500×g for 5 min. Cell membranes were collected by centrifugation at 12,000×g for 30 minutes at 4° C. The pellets were resuspended in 1×PBS, aliquoted and stored at −20° C.\n\n\nPurification of Hybridoma IgG\n\n\nELISA and FACS positive hybridoma clones were cultured in low IgG hybridoma medium (40% RPMI1640, 40% EX-Cell Hybridoma medium, 10% low IgG FBS, 10% ORIGEN cloning factor, 2 mM L-glutamine, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate) at 37° C., in a humidified atmosphere with 7% CO\n2\n. 40 ml of culture medium containing the secreted antibody were loaded onto a 1 ml HiTrap protein G HP column and then washed with 10 ml of PBS. The bound IgG was eluted from the column with 3 ml of 0.1 M glycine, pH 3.7 and neutralized with 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 9.0. The fractions containing IgG were pooled and dialyzed in PBS.\n\n\nhTF Coagulation Assay\n\n\nAnti-coagulation activity of the hTF antibodies was determined using an assay according to Morrissey, J. H., et al., \nThrombosis Research \n52:247-261 (1988) (also known as a two stage prothrombin (2st-PT) assay), and Fang, C. H., et al., \nThrombosis and Haemostasis \n76: 361-368 (1996). Different dilutions of the hTF membrane extract were adjusted with PBS to 100 μl and pre-warmed in a 37° C. water bath for 30 minutes. 50 μl of human plasma and 50 μl of 50 mM CaCl\n2 \nsolution were then added to the mixture to initiate blood coagulation in a clear disposable plastic cuvette. Blood coagulation was monitored by measuring in 15 second intervals the absorbance at 405 nm (A\n405\n). Blood coagulation was complete when the change in the A\n405 \nreading reached less than 0.01 in 15 seconds. The hTF membrane dilution that resulted in a blood coagulation time of 180 seconds was used to test the inhibitory effect of the hTF mAbs. To test the inhibitory effect of hTF mAb on blood coagulation, hTF membrane extract was incubated with each mAb (final concentrations of 10 μg/ml to 100 μg/ml) at 37° C. for 30 min before the initiation of the blood coagulation reaction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary for Screening of Anti-hTF\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHybridomas by ELISA and FACS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNumber of Clones\n\n\nPercentage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n# of clones screened\n\n\n253\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n# of ELISA-positive clones\n\n\n102\n\n\n40.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n# of FACS-positive clones\n\n\n31\n\n\n12.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary for Individual FACS-positive Clones\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nClone ID\n\n\n% Positive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n11\n\n\n99.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n20\n\n\n99.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n28\n\n\n99.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n29\n\n\n99.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n41\n\n\n99.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n54\n\n\n98.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n75\n\n\n99.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n84\n\n\n99.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n85\n\n\n97.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n92\n\n\n73.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n120\n\n\n36.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n128\n\n\n99.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n129\n\n\n98.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n144\n\n\n99.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n169\n\n\n97.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n170\n\n\n99.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n172\n\n\n99.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n196\n\n\n99.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n199\n\n\n99.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n236\n\n\n99.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n248\n\n\n67.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n260\n\n\n99.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n109\n\n\n32.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n130\n\n\n28.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n112\n\n\n26.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n50\n\n\n25.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n68\n\n\n16.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n12\n\n\n13.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n251\n\n\n13.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n93\n\n\n11.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n190\n\n\n11.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNote:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe results were obtained by FACS screening of culture supernatants of individual hybridomas grown in 24-well plates.

Human leukocytes were isolated from peripheral blood of normal donors using a Histopaque-1077 gradient centrifugation procedure (Sigma Co., St. Louis, Mo.). The isolated leukocytes were then used as effector cells. In U-bottom, 96-well plates, tumor cells (5×10\n3\n/well) were mixed with the Histopaque-purified human leukocytes at effector-to-target (E/T) ratios of 0:1-40:1 in the absence or presence of varying concentrations of anti-human TF mAbs or a control antibody in a total volume of 120 μl of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS. The plates were incubated at 37° C. in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO\n2\n. Target cells mixed with effector cells without the testing antibody were used as negative controls. Following a 16-18 hr. incubation, 50 μl aliquots of culture supernatant were collected and assayed for lactate dehydrogenase activity in flat-bottom, 96-well plates using the Cytotox 96 Non-radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay Kit (Promega Co., Madison, Wis.) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The percentage lysis of tumor cells was calculated as follows: % Cytotoxicity=experimental release−effector spontaneous release−target spontaneous release)/(target maximum release−target spontaneous release)×100. The ADCC results for anti-TF antibodies TF260, TF278, and TF392 were expressed as mean percentage lysis ±S.D. of triplicate samples from 6-7 donors and can be found in \nFIGS. 4A-4C\n. For the ADCC assays, TF-positive SW900 and TF-negative A549 lung tumor cells were used as targets. An irrelevant human IgG1 was used as the negative antibody control. \nFIGS. 4A-4C\n demonstrate that anti-TF antibodies TF260, TF278, and TF392 cause an increase in % cytotoxicity when incubated with TF-positive cells as compared to the negative antibody control (hIgG).\n\n\nAll documents, e.g., scientific publications, patents and patent publications, recited herein are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety to the same extent as if each individual document was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Description\n\n\n\n\nGOVERNMENT INTEREST\n\n\n \n \n \nThis invention was made with government support under NIH-NCI R01 CA1 15197 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates generally to the fields of medicine and pharmaceutics. More particularly, it relates to nanoemulsions, nanoemulsion particles, and nanocapsules and methods for making and using the same.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nLimited options presently exist for the administration of certain therapeutic agents that have limited solubility in water. For example, paclitaxel is a very effective chemotherapeutic agent, but its utility is hindered by its lipophilicity and currently available formulations. One currently available formulation marketed under the trademark TAXOL comprises paclitaxel in a 50:50 (v/v) mixture of CREMOPHOR EL (polyethoxylated castor oil) and dehydrated alcohol. Serious side effects, such as hypersensitivity reactions, attributable to CREMOPHOR EL have been reported (Weiss et al., 1990). In clinical therapy, high doses of anti-histamines and glucocorticoids are co-administered with TAXOL to manage these adverse effects, but this strategy has raised the possibility of additional pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic issues with paclitaxel. To eliminate CREMOPHOR EL from the paclitaxel formulation, several alternative CREMOPHOR EL-free formulations of paclitaxel have been investigated. ABRAXANE is a CREMOPHOR EL-free paclitaxel formulation and was registered with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2005. Despite its improved clinical profile, ABRAXANE has generally not replaced TAXOL in cancer chemotherapy, mostly due to its high cost. Therefore, alternative and cost-effective parenteral formulations of paclitaxel are still needed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImproved formulations are needed for many types of poorly-water soluble and insoluble drugs. It typically is difficult or not possible to freeze-dry colloidal suspensions even in the presence of cryoprotectants without substantial disruption of the colloidal suspensions. To the inventors' knowledge, the successful lyophilization of colloidal suspensions without the use of a cryoprotectant that protects the nanoparticles from the stresses of the freezing and thawing process has not been previously performed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, the lyophilization of nanoparticles (NP), nanoemulsions or nanocapsules is thought to be even more challenging due to the existence of a very thin and fragile lipid envelope that might not withstand the mechanical stress of freezing. Even in the presence of one or more cryoprotectants, increases of particle size are likely to occur. Thus, a need exists for improved nanoemulsions, nanoemulsion particles, and nanocapsule formulations.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention overcomes limitations in the related art by providing nanoparticles, e.g., nanoemulsion particles and nanocapsules, having improved physical characteristics and stability. For example, as described in further detail below, nanoparticles were successfully lyophilized and re-hydrated without the addition of a cryoprotectant and without adversely affecting the particle size or function of the particles. Surprisingly, as shown in the below examples, instead of increasing particle size as might be expected, particle sizes were slightly reduced after lyophilization and re-hydration with a complete retention of the in vitro release properties and cytotoxicity profile.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nano-based formulations of the present invention preferably comprise liquid oil cores. Various nanoparticle compositions in some embodiments of the present invention can comprise one or more of the following: a caprylic/capric triglyceride (e.g., MIGLYOL 812 and equivalents), a polyoxyethylene 20-stearyl ether (e.g., \nBRIJ\n 78 and equivalents) and/or d-alpha-\ntocopheryl polyethylene glycol\n 1000 succinate (e.g., vitamin E TPGS and equivalents). As would be appreciated by one of skill in the art, it is anticipated that modifications to the surfactants or liquid oil phase described in the below examples can be made without adversely affecting the resulting nanoparticle or nanoemulsion compositions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the various nanoemulsion, nanoemulsion particle, and nanocapsule compositions of the present invention can be made without heating, microfluidization, extrusion, high torque mixing, or high pressure mechanical agitation.

Many modifications and other embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter set forth herein will come to mind to one skilled in the art to which the presently disclosed subject matter pertains having the benefit of the teachings presented in the foregoing descriptions and the associated Drawings. Therefore, it is to be understood that the presently disclosed subject matter is not to be limited to the specific embodiments disclosed and that modifications and other embodiments are intended to be included within the scope of the appended claims. Although specific terms are employed herein, they are used in a generic and descriptive sense only and not for purposes of limitation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThroughout this application, the term “about” is used to indicate that a value includes the inherent variation of error for the device, the method being employed to determine the value, or the variation that exists among the study subjects. Thus, the term “about,” when referring to a value is meant to encompass, but is not limited to, variations of, in some embodiments±50%, in some embodiments±20%, in some embodiments±10%, in some embodiments±5%, in some embodiments±1%, in some embodiments±0.5%, and in some embodiments±0.1% from the specified amount, as such variations are appropriate to perform the disclosed methods or employ the disclosed compositions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, when an amount, concentration, or other value or parameter is given as either a range, preferred range, or a list of upper preferable values and lower preferable values, this is to be understood as specifically disclosing all ranges formed from any pair of any upper range limit or preferred value and any lower range limit or preferred value, regardless of whether ranges are separately disclosed. Where a range of numerical values is recited herein, unless otherwise stated, the range is intended to include the endpoints thereof, and all integers and fractions within the range. It is not intended that the scope of the presently disclosed subject matter be limited to the specific values recited when defining a range.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “inhibiting,” “reducing,” or “prevention,” or any variation of these terms, when used in the claims and/or the specification includes any measurable decrease or complete inhibition to achieve a desired result.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “effective,” as that term is used in the specification and/or claims, means adequate to accomplish a desired, expected, or intended result.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe use of the word “a” or “an” when used in conjunction with the term “comprising” in the claims and/or the specification can mean “one,” but it also is consistent with the meaning of “one or more,” “at least one,” and “one or more than one.” Thus, for example, reference to “a sample” includes a plurality of samples, unless the context clearly is to the contrary (e.g., a plurality of samples), and so forth.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is contemplated that any embodiment discussed in this specification can be implemented with respect to any method or composition of the invention, and vice versa. Furthermore, compositions of the invention can be used to achieve methods of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe use of the term “or” in the claims is used to mean “and/or” unless explicitly indicated to refer to alternatives only or the alternatives are mutually exclusive, although the disclosure supports a definition that refers to only alternatives and “and/or.”\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used in this specification and claim(s), the words “comprising” (and any form of comprising, such as “comprise” and “comprises”), “having” (and any form of having, such as “have” and “has”), “including” (and any form of including, such as “includes” and “include”) or “containing” (and any form of containing, such as “contains” and “contain”) are inclusive or open-ended, i.e., are non-exclusive, and do not exclude additional, unrecited elements or method steps, except where the context requires otherwise.\n\n\n \nI. Nanoemulsions, Nanoemulsion Particles and Nanocapsules\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides nanoemulsions, nanoemulsion particles, and nanocapsules having improved physical and pharmacological properties. The nanocapsule or nanoemulsion particle compositions can comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid oil phase, a surfactant, and optionally a co-surfactant, wherein the liquid oil phase comprises a monoglyceride, a diglyceride, a triglyceride, a propylene glycol monoester, a propylene glycol diester, or a mixture of two, three, four, or more different oils.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “liquid oil phase,” as used herein, refers to an oil that is substantially liquid at room temperature (70-75° F.). Various liquid oil phases can be used with the present invention, as described herein. In certain embodiments, nanocapsules or nanoemulsion particles of the present invention can comprise a monoglyceride, a diglyceride, a triglyceride, or a monoester or diester of propylene glycol, or a mixture of two, three, four or more oils. In certain embodiments, in instances where a monoglyceride exhibits substantial hydrophilicity, it can be desirable to use the monoglyceride as a surfactant rather than a component of the liquid oil phase; in other embodiments, it can be desirable to include a substantially lipophilic monoglyceride in a liquid oil phase according to the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “semi-solid” or “quasi solid” refers to a substance that has physical properties similar to a solid in some respects (e.g., an ability to support its own weight and substantially hold its shape), but a quasi-solid also shares some properties of liquids, such as shape conformity to something applying pressure to it, or the ability to flow under pressure. Quasi-solids also are known as amorphous solids because at the microscopic scale they are disordered, unlike traditional crystalline solids. While it is anticipated that the core of a nanoparticle can comprise a semi-solid or quasi solid compound, in certain embodiments nanoparticles of the present invention do not have semi-solid or quasi solid cores. In other embodiments, under the proper conditions (e.g., sufficient cooling, and the like) nanoparticles, nanoemulsions, and/or nanocapsules of the present invention can have substantially semi-solid or quasi solid cores.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the nanocapsule or nanoemulsion particle can be lyophilized and subsequently re-hydrated without increasing the mean particle size and/or adversely affecting the potency or efficacy of a therapeutic agent (e.g., paclitaxel) present in the nanocapsules or nanoemulsion particles. The nanocapsule or nanoemulsion particle of the present invention can comprise a substantially water-insoluble or lipophilic therapeutic agent, drug, imaging agent, for example, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging agent, nucleic acid, protein, or peptide. Thermosensitive compounds also can be comprised in the nanoparticles and nanoemulsion particles of the present invention. In certain embodiments, the nanocapsules or nanoemulsion particles of the present invention can be used to overcome cancer resistance to a chemotherapeutic agent (e.g., resistance to paclitaxel by cancer cells). Certain nanocapsules or nanoemulsion particles of the present invention are stable at about 4° C. for at least five months or more.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore particularly, lipid-based particulate delivery systems, including liposomes, micelles, nanoemulsion particles and nanocapsules having a liquid core, and solid lipid nanoparticles have been developed to solubilize poorly water-soluble and lipophilic drugs. These lipid-based systems have the advantage of being comprised of bio-derived and/or biocompatible lipids that often result in lower toxicity. In general, the lipid-based systems are made from the combination of lipophilic (oil), amphiphilic (surfactant) and hydrophilic (water) excipients. Formulation approaches typically involve a highly interactive process of experimentally investigating many variables including type and amount of excipients, excipient combinations, and processes (i.e., high-pressure homogenization, microfluidization, extrusion, microemulsion precursors, and the like). Appropriate type and amount of excipients are critical variables, especially in the case of microemulsion precursors to prepare lipid-based systems. Typically, phase diagrams with the blends of different excipients are first developed using the water titration method. Then, combinations of excipients and the drug substance are further optimized for their phase behavior and thermodynamic stability (Kang et al., 2004; Bummer, 2004). However, when several surfactants and/or oils are used, construction of phase diagrams can be tedious, expensive, and time consuming. As a result and as described in further detail below, the combination of Taguchi array and/or sequential simplex optimization can be used to optimize nanoemulsion particles and nanocapsules of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, the nanoemulsion particles and nanocapsules of the present invention comprise an oil phase, a surfactant, and optionally a co-surfactant. The presently disclosed nanoemulsion particles and nanocapsules comprise substantially liquid cores and thus differ from nanoparticles having solid cores. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,153,525 discloses nanoparticles having solid cores comprising “meltable” solid lipid excipients; in contrast to these solid nanoparticles and as shown in the below examples, nanoemulsion particles and nanocapsules of the present invention preferably have a liquid oil core. Further, certain nanoemulsion particles or nanocapsules of the present invention can be lyophilized without the use of a cryoprotectant, and can be used to overcome certain forms of chemotherapeutic resistance (e.g., paclitaxel resistance).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “nanoparticle,” as used herein, refers to particles that have diameters below one micrometer in diameter and include nanoemulsion particles and nanocapsules. “Stable nanoparticles” remain largely unaffected by environmental factors, such as temperature, pH, body fluids, or body tissues. The nanoparticles can contain, or have adsorbed to or be conjugated with, many different materials for various pharmaceutical and engineering applications including, but not limited to, plasmid DNA for gene therapy and genetic vaccines, peptides and proteins or small drug molecules, magnetic substances for use as nanomagnets, lubricants, or chemical, thermal, or biological sensors. The nanoparticles preferably have a diameter of less than about 300 nanometers and more preferably the nanoparticles have a diameter of less than about 200 nanometers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, a “microemulsion” is a stable biphasic mixture of two immiscible liquids stabilized by a surfactant and usually a co-surfactant. Microemulsions are thermodynamically stable, isotropically clear, form spontaneously without excessive mixing, and have dispersed droplets in the range of about 5 nm to 140 nm. In contrast, emulsions are opaque mixtures of two immiscible liquids. Emulsions are thermodynamically unstable systems, and usually require the application of high-torque mechanical mixing or homogenization to produce dispersed droplets in the range of about 0.2 to 25 μm. Both microemulsions and emulsions can be made as water-in-oil or oil-in-water systems. Whether water-in-oil or oil-in-water systems will form is largely influenced by the properties of the surfactant. The use of surfactants that have hydrophilic-lipophilic balances (HLB) of about 3-6, including 3, 4, 5, 6 and fractions thereof, tend to promote the formation of water-in-oil microemulsions, while those with HLB values of about 8-18, including 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and fractions thereof, tend to promote the formation of oil-in-water microemulsions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMicroemulsions were first described by Hoar and Schulman in 1943 after they observed that a medium chain alcohol could be added to an emulsion to produce a clear system within a defined “window,” now referred to as a microemulsion window. A unique physical aspect of microemulsions is the very low interfacial surface tension (γ) between the dispersed and continuous phases. In a microemulsion, the small size of the dispersed droplets presents a very large interface. A thermodynamically stable microemulsion can only be made if the interfacial surface tension is low enough so that the positive interfacial energy (γA, where A equals the interfacial area) can be balanced by the negative free energy of mixing (δG\nm\n). The limiting γ value needed to produce a stable microemulsion with a dispersed droplet of 10 nm, for example, can be calculated as follows: δG\nm\n=−TδS\nm \n(where T is the temperature and the entropy of mixing δS\nm\n, is of the order of the Boltzman constant k\nB\n). Thus, k\nB\nT=4πr\n2\nγ and the limiting γ value is calculated to be k\nB\nT/4πr\n2 \nor 0.03 mN m\n−1\n. Often, a co-surfactant is required in addition to the surfactant to achieve this limiting interfacial surface tension.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to their unique properties as mentioned above, microemulsions have several advantages for use as delivery systems for pharmaceutical products, including: i) increased solubility and stability of drugs incorporated into the dispersed phase; ii) increased absorption of drugs across biological membranes; iii) ease and economy of scale-up (since expensive mixing equipment is often not needed); and iv) rapid assessment of the physical stability of the microemulsion (due to the inherent clarity of the system). For example, oil-in-water microemulsions have been used to increase the solubility of lipophilic drugs into formulations that are primarily aqueous-based (Constantinides, 1995). Both oil-in-water and water-in-oil microemulsions also have been shown to enhance the oral bioavailability of drugs, including peptides (Bhargava et al., 1987; Constantinides, 1995).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough microemulsions have many potential advantages they also have potential limitations, including: a) they are complex systems and often require more development time; b) a large number of the proposed surfactants/co-surfactants are not pharmaceutically acceptable (Constantinides, 1995); and c) the microemulsions are not stable in biological fluids due to phase inversion. Thus, the microemulsions themselves are not effective in delivering drugs intracellularly or targeting drugs to different cells in the body. Further, the development of a microemulsion involves the very careful selection and titration of the dispersed phase, the continuous phase, the surfactant and the co-surfactant. Time consuming pseudo-phase ternary diagrams involving the preparation of a large number of samples must be generated to find the existence of the “microemulsion window,” if any (Attwood, 1994). In general, a water-in-oil microemulsion typically is much easier to prepare than an oil-in-water microemulsion. The former system is useful for formulating water-soluble peptides and proteins to increase their stability and absorption while the latter system is preferred for formulating drugs with little or no aqueous solubility.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA nanoemulsion is defined as a mixture of two immiscible liquids. With nanoemulsions, an inner phase can act as an emulsifier, resulting in nanoemulsion where the inner state disperses into nano-sized droplets within the outer phase. Nanoemulsion particles can exist as water-in-oil and oil-in-water forms, where the core of the particle is either water or oil, respectively. Nanoemulsions can be thermodynamically stable particles characterized by having a very low surface tension that produces a very large surface area (Sarker, 2005; Anton et al., 2008). Nanoemulsions and nanocapsules can thus certain significant advantages (Anton et al., 2008). Nanocapsules are similar to a nanoemulsion except that the nanocapsule can have a thin solid shell or wall encasing the liquid dispersed phase. See, for example, \nFIG. 10\n, right panel.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the present invention, the nanoemulsions or nanocapsules are sometimes referenced to as a nanoparticle. Nanoemulsion particles and nanocapsules suitable for use with the presently disclosed subject matter have particle sizes less than 300 nm, preferably less than 200 nm. Generally, a nanoparticle, a nanoemulsion particle or a nanocapsule refer to a particle having at least one dimension in the range of about 1 nm to about 1000 nm, including any integer value between 1 nm and 1000 nm (including about 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 nm). In some embodiments, the nanoemulsion particle or nanocapsule is a spherical particle, or substantially spherical particle, having a core, e.g., a liquid core, diameter between about 2 nm and about 300 nm (including about 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 200, and 300 nm).

In some embodiments, the nanoemulsion particle or nanocapsule has a core diameter between about 2 nm and about 100 nm (including about 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 nm) and in some embodiments, between about 20 nm and 100 nm (including about 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, and 100 nm).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNanoparticles can be measured by a conventional technique, such as photon correlation spectroscopy or other light scattering techniques or electron microscopy with measured particles in the nano-size range. Nanoparticles of the present invention can exhibit improved drug loading, drug release rates, drug pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and/or reduced toxicities associated with the administration of a therapeutic agent.\n\n\n \nA.

MIGLYOL 810 and MIGLYOL 812 differ only in C\n8\n/C\n10 \nratio. MIGLYOL 818 (CAS Registry No. 67701-28-4) is a glycerin ester of the fractionated plant fatty acids C\n8 \nand C\n10\n, and contains about 4-5% linoleic acid. MIGLYOL 829 (CAS Registry No. 91744-56-8) is a glycerin ester of the fractionated plant fatty acids C\n8 \nand C\n10\n, combined with succinic acid.

Other oil phases that can be used with the present invention include, but are not limited to: triglyceryl monoleate, glyceryl monostearate, medium chain mono- and diglycerides, glyceryl monocaprate, glyceryl monocaprylate, decaglycerol decaoleate, triglycerol monooleate, triglycerol monostearate, polyglycerol ester of mixed fatty acids, hexaglycerol dioleate, decaglycerol mono- or dioleate, propylene glycol dicaprate, propylene glycol dicaprylate/dicaprate, glyceryl tricaprylate/caprate, glyceryl tricaprylate/caprate/laurate, glyceryl tricaprylate/caprate, triacetin, propylene glycol di-(2-ethylhexanoate), glyceryl tricaprylate/caprate/linoleate, glyceryl tricaprate, glyceryl tricaprylate, and glyceryl triundecanoate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe liquid oil phase also can comprise a naturally-derived liquid oil, such as corn oil, coconut oil, sunflower seed oil, vegetable oil, cottonseed oil, mineral oil, peanut oil, sesame oil, soybean oil, and/or olive oil. Other oils can be used with the present invention including, but not limited to, liquid fatty alcohols, liquid fatty acids, liquid fatty esters, and phospholipids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious MIGLYOL oils have been previously utilized in emulsions or nanoparticle compositions (Sadurni et al., 2005; Fresta et al., 1996; Alonso et al., 2000; EP0711556A1; EP0711557A1 (also published as U.S. Pat. No. 5,658,898); El-Laithy, 2008; Sadurni et al., 2005; DE19852245; EP0865792; Montasser et al., 2003; Alonso et al., 2000; Alonso et al., 1999; WO9904766; Hubert et al., 1989; Al Khouri et al., 1986). However, these compositions lack either the use of both a surfactant and a co-surfactant, and/or one or more physical property of nanoemulsions or nanoparticles of the present invention (e.g., ability to be lyophilized and subsequently re-hydrated while retaining an average particle size of less than about 300 nm).\n\n\n \nB. Surfactants\n\n\n \n \n \nAs used herein, a “surfactant” refers to a surface-active agent, including substances commonly referred to as wetting agents, detergents, dispersing agents, or emulsifying agents. For the purposes of this invention, it is preferred that the surfactant has an HLB value of about 6-20, including an HLB value of about 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and fractions thereof, and most preferred that the surfactant has an HLB value of about 8-18, including an HLB value of about 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and fractions thereof. The surfactant and/or co-surfactant can be non-ionic, ionic, or cationic and is selected from the group consisting of polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers, polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters, phospholipids, polyoxyethylene stearates, fatty alcohols and their derivatives, hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide, and combinations thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA surfactant used with the present invention can be chemically modified with a molecule (e.g., polyethylene glycol and polyoxyethylene) to promote increased circulation durations in the blood. Additionally, it is envisioned that the surfactants can be chemically modified with a cell-targeting ligand, such as a small molecule, peptide, protein, or carbohydrate. Surfactants of the present invention are preferably pharmaceutically acceptable surfactants that result in little or no toxicity when administered to a subject according to the present invention. Surfactants are well known in the art and can be found in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy (21\nst \nEdition) Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, or Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients (6\nth \nEdition) Edited by Raymond C. Rowe, Paul J. Sheskey, and Marian E. Quinn.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “co-surfactant” refers to a surface-active agent, including substances commonly referred to as wetting agents, detergents, dispersing agents, or emulsifying agents. It is preferred, but not required, that the co-surfactant is selected from the group consisting of: polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers, polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene stearates, fatty alcohols or their derivatives, and hexadecyltrimethyl-ammonium bromide, and combinations thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe total concentration of surfactant and/or co-surfactant present in both the oil-in-water microemulsion precursor and the cured nanoparticles system is in the range of about 0.1-50 mM, 0.5-15 mM, or 1-8 mM. For example, the surfactant concentration used in certain nanoparticles in the Examples herein below is about 4 mM (e.g., \nBRIJ\n 78=3 mM and TPGS=1 mM).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments the surfactant and/or the co-surfactant are selected from d-alpha-\ntocopheryl polyethylene glycol\n 1000 succinate (TPGS) or polyoxyethylene 20-stearyl ether (BRIJ 78). \nBRIJ\n 78 has been previously used in various emulsion compositions (Liu et al., 2008).\n\n\n \nC. Cryoprotectants\n\n\n \n \n \nA cryoprotectant can be included or excluded from a nanoemulsion particle or nanocapsule composition of the present invention, as desired. Cryoprotectants are well known in the art and can be used to protect nanoparticles from the stresses of freezing and thawing (see, e.g., Jeong et al., 2006). Cryoprotectants that can be used with the present invention include sucrose, maltose, mannitol, lactose, trehalose, dextrans, and polyvinyl pyrollidone. In certain embodiments, the inclusion of a cryoprotectant is not required in nanocapsules or nanoemulsion particles of the present invention, which can display increased stability without the presence of a cryoprotectant, e.g., during freezing or lyophilization.\n\n\n \nD. Nanoemulsion Particles and Nanocapsules Comprising Bioactive Agents\n\n\n \n \n \nThe nanoemulsion particles or nanocapsules of the present invention can comprise a bioactive agent. As used herein, the term “bioactive agent” includes, but is not limited to, any agent that has a desired effect on a living cell, tissue, or organism, or an agent that can desirably interact with a component (e.g., enzyme) of a living cell, tissue, or organism, including, but not limited to, polynucleotides, polypeptides, polysaccharides, organic and inorganic small molecules. The term “bioactive agent” encompasses both naturally occurring and synthetic bioactive agents. The term “bioactive agent” also can refer to a detection or diagnostic agent that interacts with a biological molecule to provide a detectable readout that reflects a particular physiological or pathological event. More particularly, in some embodiments, the bioactive agent can include a small molecule, a therapeutic agent, an anti-viral agent, a bacteriostatic or anti-bacterial agent, an anti-fungal agent, a cell-targeting ligand, a peptide, a protein, a carbohydrate, a diagnostic agent, and a viral or bacterial protein capable of eliciting a humoral or cellular-based immune response. For example, when the bioactive agent comprises viral protein capable of eliciting a humoral or cellular-based immune response, the presently disclosed nanocapsule or nanoemulsion particles can comprise a vaccine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, one or more bioactive agents can be substantially comprised in the liquid oil core of the nanocapsule or the nanoemulsion particle. In yet another embodiment, one or more bioactive agents can be conjugated to the surface of the presently disclosed nanocapsules or nanoemulsion particles. In some embodiments, the one or more bioactive agents can be conjugated directly to the surface of the nanocapsule or nanoemulsion particle, e.g., conjugated to the surfactant or co-surfactant. In other embodiments, the bioactive agent can be conjugated to the nanocapsule or nanoemulsion particle through a linker, for example, through a polyethylene glycol (PEG) or polyoxyethylene moiety. Further, it is contemplated that the presently disclosed nanocapsules and nanoemulsion particles can comprise more than one bioactive agent. For example, in some embodiments, a first bioactive agent, e.g., a therapeutic agent, can be substantially comprised in the liquid oil core of the nanocapsule or nanoemulsion particle, whereas a second bioactive agent, e.g., a cell-targeting ligand, can be conjugated with the surface of the nanocapsule or nanoemulsion particle. Various combinations of a plurality of bioactive agents comprised in liquid oil core and/or conjugated with the surface of the nanocapsules or nanoemulsion particles are thus encompassed by the presently disclosed subject matter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore particularly, due to the liquid oil phase present in various nanocapsules or nanoemulsion particles of the present invention, substantially water-insoluble or lipophilic bioactive agents, e.g., a therapeutic agent, can be advantageously included in nanoemulsion particles or nanocapsules of the present invention. In various embodiments, the entrapment efficiency of the therapeutic agent in the nanoemulsion particles or nanocapsules can be is at least 50%, at least 75%, at least 85%, or at least 90% in the nanocapsules or nanoemulsion particles. The therapeutic agent can be present in the nanocapsules or nanoemulsion particles at a weight ratio of at least 6% of the liquid oil phase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherapeutic agents that can be used with the nanoparticles of the present invention include chemotherapeutic agents, such as lipophilic chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., paclitaxel, and the like). As shown in the below examples, various nanocapsules or nanoemulsion particles of the present invention can be lyophilized and subsequently rehydrated without substantially affecting the potency, e.g., in vitro or in vivo cytotoxicity, of the nanocapsules or nanoemulsion particles as compared to the nanocapsules or nanoemulsion particles prior to lyophilization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, nanoparticles and nanoemulsion particles of the present invention can be used to deliver a chemotherapeutic agent to cells to overcome chemotherapeutic resistance in the cells. As described in more detail herein below in Example 9 and as exemplified in \nFIGS. 7-9\n, the presently disclosed nanoemulsion particle or nanocapsule formulations have been found to overcome P-gp mediated resistance in human cancer cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n1. Lipophilic Therapeutic Agents\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA lipophilic therapeutic agent can be included in nanoemulsion or nanocapsule compositions of the present invention. “Lipophilic or “hydrophobic,” as used herein, refers to the physical property of a substance to preferentially associate with or dissolve in organic solvents, such as octanol and/or to repel or not associate with water. Various methods for determining the hydrophobicity or lipophilicity of a substance are known in the art. For example the log\n10 \nP of a compound can be measured, wherein P is the partition coefficient (i.e., [concentration dissolved in octanol]/[concentration dissolved in water]). According to this test, when P is less than 0, the compound is considered hydrophilic; when P is greater than 0, the compound is considered hydrophobic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Hydrophilic,” as used herein, refers to the physical property of a substance to have a preferential affinity for, dissolve in, or physically associate with water. Hydrophilic interactions can involve hydrogen bonding, dipole-dipole, or a charged interaction with water. The hydrophilicity of a compound can be measured as described immediately hereinabove.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn various embodiments, the nanoemulsion, nanoemulsion particle, and/or nanocapsule compositions of the present invention can comprise or be used to deliver to a subject a lipophilic drug, a lipophilic imaging agent, and/or a lipophilic therapeutic agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n2. Anti-Cancer Agents\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNanoparticles offer an alternative delivery system for disease therapies, and nanoparticles can be particularly useful in treating cancer. Nanoparticles have the potential to control drug release rates, improve drug pharmacokinetics and biodistribution, and reduce drug toxicities. Due to their small size, nanoparticles comprising entrapped drugs can penetrate tumors due to the discontinuous and leaky nature of the microvasculature of tumors (Pasqualini et al., 2002; Hobbs et al., 1998). Also, the characteristically poor lymphatic drainage of tumors can result in slower clearance of nanoparticles that accumulate in tumors. This well known effect is referred to as the “enhanced permeability and retention” (EPR) effect (Muggia, 1999; Maeda et al., 2001).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, nanoemulsion particles and/or nanocapsules of the present invention comprise a cancer therapeutic or chemotherapeutic compound. In certain embodiments, substantially lipophilic chemotherapeutic agents can be used with the present invention and administered to a patient, e.g., parenterally. Chemotherapeutic agents that can be used with the present invention include, but are not limited to, nucleic acids (such as RNA and DNA), alkylating agents, anti-metabolites, plant alkaloids and terpenoids, vinca alkaloids, podopyllotoxin, taxanes, topoisomerase inhibitors, antitumor antibiotics, monoclonal antibodies, and hormones.\n\n\n \n \n \n \na. Paclitaxel Nanoparticles\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPaclitaxel is an example of a hydrophobic chemotherapeutic agent that can be included in nanoemulsion particles or nanocapsules of the present invention. Paclitaxel is one of the most effective anticancer agents used in the treatment of various tumors. It is a taxane that interferes with microtubule depolymerization in tumor cells resulting in an arrest of the cell cycle in mitosis followed by the induction of apoptosis. However, the high lattice energy of paclitaxel results in very limited aqueous solubility (approximately 0.7-30 μg/mL) (Mathew et al., 1992; Swindell and Krauss, 1991) contributing to only two commercialized dosage forms of injectable paclitaxel, TAXOL and ABRAXANE.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn contrast to certain commercially available forms of paclitaxel, the nanocapsules or nanoemulsion particles of the present invention preferably do not comprise polyethoxylated castor oil. Specifically, TAXOL is composed of a 50:50 (v/v) mixture of CREMOPHOR EL (polyethoxylated castor oil) and dehydrated alcohol, and serious side effects, such as hypersensitivity reactions, attributable to CREMOPHOR EL have been reported (Weiss et al., 1990). Polyethoxylated castor oil can thus be advantageously excluded in nanoemulsion particles or nanocapsules of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in the below examples, nanoparticles with liquid oil cores comprising paclitaxel display certain superior characteristics as compared to solid-core nanoparticles comprising paclitaxel. Engineering of stable solid lipid-based nanoparticles from oil-in-water (o/w) microemulsion precursors has been performed. Nanoparticles (E78 NPs) utilizing emulsifying wax (E. wax) as the lipid matrix and \nBRIJ\n 78 as the surfactant were reproducibly prepared with particle sizes less than 150 nm. These E78 NPs were found to have excellent hemocompatibility (Koziara et al., 2005) and were shown to be metabolized in vitro by horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase (HLADH)/NAD\n+\n (Dong and Mumper, 2006). Paclitaxel (PX) E78 NPs were shown to overcome Pgp-mediated tumor resistance in-vitro in a human HCT-15 colon adenocarcinoma cell line (Koziara et al., 2006) and in vivo in athymic nude mice bearing solid HCT-15 xenograft tumors (Koziara et al., 2006). However, a shortcoming of the PX E78 NPs used in the above examples was that the entrapment efficiency of paclitaxel in the NPs was only 50%, which resulted in relatively rapid in-vitro release (over 80% in 8 hr). These shortcomings were directly attributable to the relatively poor solubility of PX in the melted E. Wax.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in the below examples, the presently disclosed subject matter provides CREMOPHOR-free lipid-based paclitaxel nanoparticle formulations that: 1) use acceptable liquid oil phases having improved solvation ability for PX; 2) display a PX entrapment efficiency greater than 80% with a minimum final concentration of 150 μg/mL with over 5% drug loading; 3) result in slower release profiles of PX from nanoparticles; and 4) display comparable in vitro cytotoxicity as compared to TAXOL.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo medium-chain triglycerides, glyceryl tridodecanoate and MIGLYOL 812, were selected as the oil phases to engineer nanoparticles from o/w microemulsion precursors. Triglycerides are biocompatible/biodegradable excipients (Traul et al., 2000). It has been reported that paclitaxel has a high partition coefficient (Kp) in medium-chain triglycerides (Dhanikula et al., 2007). Glyceryl tridodecanoate is solid at room temperature, whereas MIGLYOL 812 is liquid at room temperature. Thus, the use glyceryl tridodecanoate and MIGLYOL 812 as oil phases can result in the formation of solid lipid nanoparticles and nanocapsules having a liquid core, respectively. Simplex optimization or the combination of Taguchi array and sequential simplex optimization was used to identify optimized systems based on initial response variables (criteria) of particle size and polydispersity index. Identified leads were then fully characterized for stability, entrapment efficiency, in vitro release, and cytotoxicity in human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in the below examples, Sequential Simplex Optimization has been utilized to identify promising new lipid-based paclitaxel nanoparticles having useful attributes. More particularly, to identify and optimize new nanoparticles, experimental design was performed combining Taguchi array and sequential simplex optimization. The combination of Taguchi array and sequential simplex optimization efficiently directed the design of paclitaxel nanoparticles. As shown immediately herein below, CREMOPHOR-free lipid-based paclitaxel (PX) nanoemulsion or nanocapsule formulations were produced from warmed microemulsion precursors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo optimized paclitaxel nanoparticles (NPs) were obtained: G78 NPs composed of glyceryl tridodecanoate (GT) and polyoxyethylene 20-stearyl ether (BRIJ 78), and BTM NPs composed of MIGLYOL 812, \nBRIJ\n 78 and d-alpha-\ntocopheryl polyethylene glycol\n 1000 succinate (TPGS). Both nanoparticles successfully entrapped paclitaxel at a final concentration of 150 μg/mL (over 6% drug loading) with particle sizes less than 200 nm and over 85% of entrapment efficiency. These novel paclitaxel nanoparticles were stable at 4° C. over five months and in PBS at 37° C. over 102 hours as measured by physical stability. Release of paclitaxel was slow and sustained without initial burst release. Cytotoxicity studies in MDA-MB-231 cancer cells showed that both nanoparticles have similar anticancer activities compared to TAXOL. Interestingly, PX BTM nanocapsules could be lyophilized without cryoprotectants. The lyophilized powder comprised only of PX BTM NPs in water could be rapidly rehydrated with complete retention of original physicochemical properties, in vitro release properties, and cytotoxicity profile.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nb. Other Chemotherapeutic Agents\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther chemotherapeutic agents that can be used with the present invention include: alkylating agents, cisplatin (CDDP), carboplatin, oxaliplatin, mechlorethamine, cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, anti-metabolites, plant alkaloids and terpenoids, taxanes, vinca alkaloids (e.g., vincristine, vinblastine, vinorelbine, and vindesine), podophyllotoxin, etoposide, teniposide, taxanes (e.g., docetaxel), topoisomerase inhibitors (e.g., camptothecins, such as irinotecan or topotecan; amsacrine, etoposide, etoposide phosphate, and teniposide), antitumour antibiotics (e.g., dactinomycin), hormones, steroids (e.g., dexamethasone), finasteride, tamoxifen, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRH), such as goserelin, protein-bound paclitaxel (e.g., ABRAXANE), doxorubicin, daunorubicin, mitomycin, actinomycin D, bleomycin, tumor necrosis factor (TNF; cachectin), TAXOL, carmustine, melphalan, cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, busulfan, and lomustine. 5-fluorouracil, anthocyanin, bleomycin, busulfan, camptothecin, capecitabine, carboplatin, chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, dactinomycin, estrogen receptor binding agents, etoposide (VP16), farnesyl-protein transferase inhibitors, gemcitabine, idarubicin, ifosfamide, lapatinib, lectrozole, mechlorethamine, melphalan, mitomycin, navelbine, nitrosurea, other platinum containing compounds, parthenolide, plicomycin, a polyphenolic agent derived from nature, procarbazine, raloxifene, tamoxifen, temazolomide (an aqueous form of DTIC), transplatinum, and methotrexate, or any analog or derivative variant of the foregoing. These agents or drugs are categorized by their mode of activity within a cell, for example, whether and at what stage they affect the cell cycle. Alternatively, an agent can be characterized based on its ability to directly cross-link DNA, to intercalate into DNA, or to induce chromosomal and mitotic aberrations by affecting nucleic acid synthesis. Most chemotherapeutic agents fall into the following categories: alkylating agents, antimetabolites, antitumor antibiotics, corticosteroid hormones, mitotic inhibitors, and nitrosoureas, hormone agents, miscellaneous agents, and any analog or derivative variant thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n3. Other Therapeutic Agents\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is envisioned that a wide variety of therapeutic agents can be included in nanoparticles or nanoemulsion particles of the present invention.

The purpose of experimental design is to plan and conduct experiments to extract the maximum amount of information from the collected data in the smallest number of experimental runs. Factorial design based on a response surface method has been applied to design formulations (Gohel and Amin, 1998; Bhaysar et al., 2006). However, an increase in the number of factors markedly increases the number of experiments to be carried out. The so-called Taguchi approach proposes a special set of orthogonal arrays to standardize fractional factorial designs (Roy, 2001). By this approach, the size of factorial design was reduced. As shown in \nFIG. 1\n, sequential simplex optimization is a step-wise strategy for optimization that can adjust many factors simultaneously to rapidly achieve optimal response. The optimization is preceded by moving of a geometric figure (the “simplex”). The starting simplex is composed of k+1 vertex (experiments) wherein k is the number of variables. Then, the experiments are performed one by one. The new simplex is obtained based on the results from the previous simplex and the procedure is repeated until the simplex has rotated and an optimum is encircled. The variable-size simplex algorithm is the modified simplex algorithm that allows the simplex to change its size during movement (\nFIG. 1\n). For detailed principles and applications, see Gabrielsson et al., 2002; Walters et al., 1991). Thus, this process of sequential simplex optimization allows for simultaneous formulation development and optimization.\n\n\n \nII. Methods of Making Nanoemulsions, Nanoemulsion Particles and Nanocapsules\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides methods for making nanoemulsions, nanoemulsion particles, and nanocapsules. As would be appreciated by one of skill in the art in the art, the preparation of nanoparticles typically involves the use of high-pressure homogenization, microfluidization, high torque mixing, high-pressure mechanical agitation and/or heating. In contrast to these methods, the inventors have discovered that the nanocapsules or nanoemulsion particles of the present invention can be produced without additional heating. This discovery is particularly important as it relates to the possible inclusion of thermosensitive compounds, such as proteins, nucleic acids, and the like, in the nanoemulsion particles or nanocapsules. In embodiments where heating would not be detrimental to the composition, nanoparticles of the present invention can be produced with heating without any additional high pressure mechanical agitation or high torque mixing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNanoparticles can be produced using an oil phase, a surfactant, a co-surfactant, and an aqueous solvent or a non-aqueous solvent by heating and subsequently cooling the microemulsion precursor composition. The aqueous solvent can include, for example, water, an aqueous solution comprising 10% lactose, a 150 mM NaCl aqueous solution, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the following protocol can be used to produce nanoparticles of the present invention. Nanoparticles can be prepared from warm oil in water (o/w) microemulsion precursors as previously described with some modification (Oyewumi and Mumper, 2002). Defined amounts of oil phases and surfactants can be weighed into glass vials and heated to 65° C. A desired amount of filtered and deionized (D.I.) water pre-heated at 65° C. (e.g., about 1 mL or similar volumes) can be added into the mixture of melted or liquid oils and surfactants. The mixture can be stirred for 20 min at 65° C. and then cooled to room temperature. To prepare nanoparticles containing a therapeutic agent, the therapeutic agent (e.g., paclitaxel) can be dissolved in a solvent (e.g., ethanol) and added directly to the melted or liquid oil and surfactant. The solvent, e.g., ethanol, can be removed by N\n2 \nstream prior to initiating the process described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA nanoemulsion particle or nanocapsule formulation also can be made without heating. In certain embodiments, the following protocol can be used. A liquid oil phase, surfactant, and co-surfactant (e.g., 2.5 mg of MIGLYOL 812, 1.5 mg of TPGS and 3.5 mg of BRIJ 78) can be mixed/dissolved in ethanol. The ethanol was evaporated and water (e.g., about 1 mL) can be added. The system can be mixed overnight at room temperature. In other embodiments, the following protocol can be used. A \nliquid oil phase\n 5 mg MIGLYOL 612 and 5 mg Vitamin E TPGS can be mixed/dissolved in ethanol. The ethanol can be evaporated and water (e.g., about 2 mL) can be added. The system can be mixed for 20 minutes at room temperature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn embodiments where heating is not used to produce nanocapsules or nanoemulsion particles of the present invention, admixing of an oil phase, a surfactant, and a co-surfactant can be performed at ambient temperatures (e.g., less than about 115° F., between about 65-85° F., or between about 70-75° F.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome additional time can be required for admixing the components to form nanoparticles or nanocapsules when heating is not used; however, these approaches can be advantageously used, e.g., when a practitioner wishes to include a thermosensitive compound or therapeutic agent in the nanoparticles or nanocapsules. Thermosensitive compounds and therapeutic agents are well known in the art and include various proteins, peptides, nucleic acids, and other molecules whose function can be diminished (e.g., by denaturation, and the like) due to increased temperatures. Additionally, these methods can be advantageously used for thermosensitive compounds that can include small molecules, markers, imaging agents, gene therapies, proteins, enzymes, peptides, and nucleic acids, such as RNA and/or DNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain nanoemulsion particles and nanocapsules of the present invention can be lyophilized and subsequently re-hydrated without any increases in particle size and/or without any reduction in the potency or efficacy of a therapeutic agent (e.g., paclitaxel) present in the compositions. As shown in the below examples, lyophilization of various nanoparticles of the present invention in water alone resulted in the formation of dry white cakes that were rapidly rehydrated with water within less than 15 seconds to produce clear nanoparticle suspensions, wherein the nanoparticles showed complete retention of original physicochemical properties and in vitro release properties (\nFIG. 2\n and \nFIG. 6\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn various embodiments, paclitaxel can be included in nanocapsules or nanoemulsion particles comprising an oil-phase (e.g., a mono-, di-, or triglyceride, a diester propylene glycol), a surfactant and a co-surfactant (TPGS and BRIJ 78). In various embodiments, the following relative amounts of components can be used to produce whatever final quantity of nanoparticles is desired: 450 μg paclitaxel, 7.5 mg of MIGLYOL 812, 4.5 mg of TPGS and 10.5 mg of BRIJ 78 can be mixed at 65° C., and then 1 mL water can be added; 600 μg paclitaxel, 10.0 mg of MIGLYOL 812, 6.0 mg of TPGS and 14.0 mg of BRIJ 78 can be mixed at 65° C., and then 1 mL water can be added; and 750 μg paclitaxel, 12.5 mg of MIGLYOL 812, 7.5 mg of TPGS and 17.5 mg of BRIJ 78 can be mixed at 65° C., and then 1 mL water can be added. After 20 min mixing at 65° C., the system can be cooled to room temperature. The concentration of paclitaxel in the nanocapsule suspension can be evaluated before and after filtration through a 0.2 micron filter. Thus, a 0.2 μm on-line filter possible can be used for intravenous (i.v.) injection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, preparation of long-circulating nanoemulsion particles or nanocapsules can be accomplished via the following protocol, and using the following relative amounts (i.e., the quantities can be adjusted to yield whatever final amounts of product are desired). A two (2) mL suspension can be prepared from warm o/w microemulsion precursors by adding 2.5 mg of MIGLYOL 812, 1.5 mg of TPGS and 3 mg of BRIJ 78 to a glass vial and heating to 65° C. 975 microliters of filtered and deionized (D.I.) water pre-heated at 65° C. can be added into the mixture of melted oils and surfactants. After 15 min of mixing, 25 microliters of a 8 \nmg BRIJ\n 700/mL stock solution can be added to the warm mixture and mixed for an additional 10 min. The mixture can then be cooled to room temperature and stirred for another 5 hr. \nBRIJ\n 700, also known as Steareth-100, has a polyethylene glycol (PEG) moiety (Mw of PEG about 4400) and can be added to the formulation to form sterically stabilized nanoparticles to increase circulation times in the blood.\n\n\n \nIII. Pharmaceutical Preparations\n\n\n \n \n \nThe nanocapsules or nanoemulsion particles of the present invention can be formulated for administration to a subject, e.g., a human patient, via various routes. For example, the nanocapsules or nanoemulsion particles can be formulated for parenteral, intravenous (i.v.), topical, rectal, oral, inhalation, intranasal, transdermal, or buccal administration. In certain embodiments, a substantially water insoluble or lipophilic drug can be effectively stored and administered parenterally as a nanosuspension. In other embodiments, a nanocapsule or nanoemulsion formulation can be lyophilized or produced in a spray-dried powder. The spray dried powder can subsequently be formulated in an oral dosage forms, such as a compressed tablet or a capsule-based formulation. Thus, in certain embodiments, the compositions of the present invention can be formulated for delivery via an alimentary route. In other embodiments, nanocapsules or nanoemulsion particles of the present invention can be delivered via inhalation (e.g., in an aerosol formulation and the like).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise an effective amount of one or more nanoemulsion particles or nanocapsules of the present invention and can include, in some embodiments, one or more additional agents dissolved or dispersed in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The phrases “pharmaceutical or pharmacologically acceptable” refers to molecular entities and compositions that do not produce an adverse, allergic or other untoward reaction when administered to an animal, such as, for example, a human, as appropriate. The preparation of a pharmaceutical composition that contains at least one nanoemulsion particle or nanocapsule or additional active ingredient will be known to those of skill in the art in light of the present disclosure, as exemplified by Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 21\nst \nedition, by University of the Sciences in Philadelphia, incorporated herein by reference. Moreover, for animal (e.g., human) administration, it will be understood that preparations should meet sterility, pyrogenicity, general safety and purity standards as required by, for example, by the FDA's General Biological Products Standards as provided in 21 C.F.R. part 610.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nanoemulsion particle or nanocapsule compositions can comprise different types of carriers depending on whether it is to be administered in solid, liquid or aerosol form, and whether it is required to be sterile for such routes of administration as injection. The present invention can be administered intravenously, intradermally, intracranially, transdermally, intrathecally, intraarterially, intraperitoneally, intranasally, intravaginally, intrarectally, topically, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, mucosally, orally, locally, inhalation (e.g., aerosol inhalation), injection, infusion, continuous infusion, localized perfusion bathing target cells directly, via a catheter, via a lavage, in cremes, in lipid compositions, or by other method or any combination of the forgoing as would be known to one of ordinary skill in the art (see, for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed. Mack Printing Company, 1990, incorporated herein by reference). In certain embodiments, a nanoemulsion particle or nanocapsule composition of the present invention is administered intravenously or parenterally.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther in accordance with the present invention, the composition of the present invention suitable for administration is provided in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier with or without an inert diluent. The carrier should be assimilable and includes liquid, semi-solid, i.e., pastes, or solid carriers. Except insofar as any conventional media, agent, diluent or carrier is detrimental to the recipient or to the therapeutic effectiveness of a composition contained therein, its use in an administrable composition for use in practicing the methods of the present invention is appropriate. Examples of carriers or diluents include fats, oils, water, saline solutions, lipids, liposomes, resins, binders, fillers and the like, or combinations thereof. The composition also can comprise various antioxidants to retard oxidation of one or more component. Additionally, the prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by preservatives, such as various antibacterial and antifungal agents, including, but not limited to, parabens (e.g., methylparabens, propylparabens), chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal or combinations thereof.\n\n\n \nA. Parenteral Compositions and Formulations\n\n\n \n \n \nIn further embodiments, nanoemulsion particle or nanocapsule compositions can be administered via a parenteral route. As used herein, the term “parenteral” includes routes of administration that bypass the alimentary tract. Specifically, the pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein can be administered for example, but not limited to intravenously, intradermally, intramuscularly, intraarterially, intrathecally, subcutaneous, or intraperitoneally see U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,537,514; 6,613,308; 5,466,468; 5,543,158; 5,641,515; and 5,399,363 (each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolutions of the active compounds as free base or pharmacologically acceptable salts can be prepared in water suitably mixed with a surfactant, such as hydroxypropylcellulose. Dispersions also can be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and mixtures thereof and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms. The pharmaceutical formulations suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions (U.S. Pat. No. 5,466,468, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). In all cases the formulation must be sterile and also must be fluid to the extent to facilitate easy injectability. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (i.e., glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), suitable mixtures thereof, and/or vegetable oils. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion, and by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor parenteral administration in an aqueous solution, for example, the solution should be suitably buffered if necessary and the liquid diluent first rendered isotonic with sufficient saline or glucose. These particular aqueous solutions are especially suitable for intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, and intraperitoneal administration. In this connection, sterile aqueous media that can be employed will be known to those of skill in the art in light of the present disclosure. For example, one dosage can be dissolved in isotonic NaCl solution and either added hypodermoclysis fluid or injected at the proposed site of infusion, (see for example, “Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences” 15th Edition, pages 1035-1038 and 1570-1580). Some variation in dosage will necessarily occur depending on the condition of the subject being treated. The person responsible for administration will, in any event, determine the appropriate dose for the individual subject. Moreover, for human administration, preparations should meet sterility, pyrogenicity, general safety and purity standards as required by FDA's General Biological Products Standards as provided in 21 C.F.R. part 610.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the active compounds in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various of the other ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the various sterilized active ingredients into a sterile vehicle that contains the basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum-drying and freeze-drying techniques that yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof. A powdered composition is combined with a liquid carrier, such as, e.g., water or a saline solution, with or without a stabilizing agent.\n\n\n \nB. Miscellaneous Pharmaceutical Compositions and Formulations\n\n\n \n \n \nIn other preferred embodiments of the invention, the nanoemulsion particle or nanocapsule composition can be formulated for administration via various miscellaneous routes, for example, oral, topical (i.e., transdermal) administration, mucosal administration (intranasal, vaginal, and the like) and/or inhalation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions for topical administration can include the nanoemulsion particle or nanocapsule composition formulated for a medicated application, such as an ointment, gel, paste, cream or powder. Ointments include all oleaginous, adsorption, emulsion and water-soluble based compositions for topical application, while creams and lotions are those compositions that include an emulsion base only. Topically administered medications can contain a penetration enhancer to facilitate adsorption of the active ingredients through the skin. Suitable penetration enhancers include glycerin, alcohols, alkyl methyl sulfoxides, pyrrolidones and luarocapram. Possible bases for compositions for topical application include polyethylene glycol, lanolin, cold cream and petrolatum, as well as any other suitable absorption, emulsion or water-soluble ointment base. Topical preparations also can include emulsifiers, gelling agents, and antimicrobial preservatives as necessary to preserve the active ingredient and provide for a homogenous mixture. Transdermal administration of the present invention also can comprise the use of a “patch.” For example, the patch can supply one or more active substances at a predetermined rate and in a continuous manner over a fixed period of time.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions can be delivered by eye drops, intranasal sprays, inhalation, and/or other aerosol delivery vehicles. Methods for delivering compositions directly to the lungs via nasal aerosol sprays has been described e.g., in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,756,353 and 5,804,212 (each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Likewise, the delivery of drugs using intranasal microparticle resins (Takenaga et al., 1998) and lysophosphatidyl-glycerol compounds (U.S. Pat. No. 5,725,871, specifically incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) also are well-known in the pharmaceutical arts. Likewise, transmucosal drug delivery in the form of a polytetrafluoroetheylene support matrix is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,780,045 (specifically incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “aerosol” refers to a colloidal system of finely divided solid or liquid particles dispersed in a liquefied or pressurized gas propellant. The typical aerosol of the present invention for inhalation will consist of a suspension of active ingredients in liquid propellant or a mixture of liquid propellant and a suitable solvent. Suitable propellants include hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon ethers. Suitable containers will vary according to the pressure requirements of the propellant. Administration of the aerosol will vary according to subject's age, weight and the severity and response of the symptoms.\n\n\n \nIV. Delivery of Active Agents for the Treatment of Diseases\n\n\n \n \n \nIt is anticipated that the nanocapsule and nanoemulsion particle compositions of the present invention can be used to deliver a bioactive agent, e.g., a therapeutic agent to actively or prophylactically treat a variety of diseases. For example, the nanocapsule and nanoemulsion particle compositions can comprise a drug or therapeutic agent the treatment of cancer, cardiovascular disease, depression, inflammation, diseases of the central nervous system, and/or the prevention or therapy of an infectious disease, such as a bacterial, fungal, viral, or protozoan disease, and the like. The nanocapsule and nanoemulsion particle compositions can comprise a bioactive, e.g., a vaccine, to prophylactically prevent or reduce the incidence of recurrence of a disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA. Cancer Therapies\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nanoemulsion particle or nanocapsule compositions of the present invention can be administered to a subject, such as a mammal, a rat, a mouse, a non-human animal, or a human patient, to treat a cancer. Although it is envisioned that the compositions of the present invention can be used to treat virtually any cancer, in certain embodiments, a nanoemulsion particle or nanocapsule comprising an anti-cancer compound can be administered to a subject to treat leukemia, cancer of the lymph node or lymph system, bone cancer, cancer of the mouth and esophagus, stomach cancer, colon cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, a gastric cancer, brain cancer, renal cancer, liver cancer, prostate cancer, melanoma, lung cancer, a tumor, and/or a metastasis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nB. Combination Therapies\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo increase the effectiveness of a nanocapsule or nanoemulsion particle composition comprising an anti-cancer compound, e.g., a chemotherapeutic agent, it can be desirable to combine these compositions and methods of the invention with an agent effective in the treatment of a hyperproliferative disease, such as, for example, an anti-cancer agent. An “anti-cancer” agent is capable of negatively affecting cancer in a subject, for example, by killing one or more cancer cells, inducing apoptosis in one or more cancer cells, reducing the growth rate of one or more cancer cells, reducing the incidence or number of metastases, reducing a tumor's size, inhibiting a tumor's growth, reducing the blood supply to a tumor or one or more cancer cells, promoting an immune response against one or more cancer cells or a tumor, preventing or inhibiting the progression of a cancer, or increasing the lifespan of a subject with a cancer. Anti-cancer agents include, for example, chemotherapy agents (chemotherapy), radiotherapy agents (radiotherapy), a surgical procedure (surgery), immune therapy agents (immunotherapy), genetic therapy agents (gene therapy), hormonal therapy, other biological agents (biotherapy) and/or alternative therapies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore generally, such an agent would be provided in a combined amount with a nanoemulsion particle or nanocapsule composition effective to kill or inhibit proliferation of a cancer cell. This process can involve contacting the cell(s) with an agent(s) and the nanoemulsion particle or nanocapsule composition at the same time or within a period of time wherein separate administration of the nanoemulsion particle or nanocapsule composition and an agent to a cell, tissue or organism produces a desired therapeutic benefit. This benefit can be achieved by contacting the cell, tissue, or organism with a single composition or pharmacological formulation that includes both a nanoemulsion particle or nanocapsule composition and one or more agents, or by contacting the cell with two or more distinct compositions or formulations, wherein one composition includes a nanoemulsion particle or nanocapsule composition and the other includes one or more agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “contacted” and “exposed,” when applied to a cell, tissue or organism, are used herein to describe the process by which a therapeutic construct of a nanoemulsion particle or nanocapsule composition and/or another agent, such as for example a chemotherapeutic or radiotherapeutic agent, are delivered to a target cell, tissue or organism or are placed in direct juxtaposition with the target cell, tissue or organism. To achieve cell killing or stasis, the nanoemulsion particle or nanocapsule composition and/or additional agent(s) are delivered to one or more cells in a combined amount effective to kill the cell(s) or prevent them from dividing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nanoemulsion particle or nanocapsule composition can precede, be co-current with and/or follow the other agent(s) by intervals ranging from minutes to weeks. In embodiments where the nanoemulsion particle or nanocapsule composition, and other agent(s) are applied separately to a cell, tissue or organism, one would generally ensure that a significant period of time did not expire between the time of each delivery, such that the nanoemulsion particle or nanocapsule composition and agent(s) would still be able to exert an advantageously combined effect on the cell, tissue or organism. For example, in such instances, it is contemplated that one can contact the cell, tissue or organism with two, three, four or more modalities substantially simultaneously (i.e. within less than about a minute) as the nanoemulsion particle or nanocapsule composition. In other aspects, one or more agents can be administered within of from substantially simultaneously, about 1 minute, about 5 minutes, about 10 minutes, about 20 minutes about 30 minutes, about 45 minutes, about 60 minutes, about 2 hours, about 3 hours, about 4 hours, about 5 hours, about 6 hours, about 7 hours about 8 hours, about 9 hours, about 10 hours, about 11 hours, about 12 hours, about 13 hours, about 14 hours, about 15 hours, about 16 hours, about 17 hours, about 18 hours, about 19 hours, about 20 hours, about 21 hours, about 22 hours, about 22 hours, about 23 hours, about 24 hours, about 25 hours, about 26 hours, about 27 hours, about 28 hours, about 29 hours, about 30 hours, about 31 hours, about 32 hours, about 33 hours, about 34 hours, about 35 hours, about 36 hours, about 37 hours, about 38 hours, about 39 hours, about 40 hours, about 41 hours, about 42 hours, about 43 hours, about 44 hours, about 45 hours, about 46 hours, about 47 hours, about 48 hours, about 1 day, about 2 days, about 3 days, about 4 days, about 5 days, about 6 days, about 7 days, about 8 days, about 9 days, about 10 days, about 11 days, about 12 days, about 13 days, about 14 days, about 15 days, about 16 days, about 17 days, about 18 days, about 19 days, about 20 days, about 21 days, about 1 week, about 2 weeks, about 3 weeks, about 4 weeks, about 5 weeks, about 6 weeks, about 7 weeks or about 8 weeks or more, and any range derivable therein, prior to and/or after administering the nanoemulsion particle or nanocapsule composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious combination regimens of the nanoemulsion particle or nanocapsule composition and one or more agents can be employed. Non-limiting examples of such combinations are shown below, wherein a composition of the nanoemulsion particle or nanocapsule composition is “A” and an agent is “B”:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA/B/A   B/A/B   B/B/A  A/A/B   A/B/B   B/A/A   A/B/B/B   B/A/B/B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  B/B/B/A   B/B/A/B   A/A/B/B   A/B/A/B   A/B/B/A   B/B/A/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  B/A/B/A   B/A/A/B   A/A/A/B    B/A/A/A   A/B/A/A   A/A/B/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdministration of the composition of the nanoemulsion particle or nanocapsule composition to a cell, tissue or organism can follow general protocols for the administration of chemotherapeutic agents, taking into account the toxicity, if any. It is expected that the treatment cycles would be repeated as necessary. In particular embodiments, it is contemplated that various additional agents can be applied in any combination with the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n1. Chemotherapeutic Agents\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “chemotherapy” refers to the use of drugs to treat cancer. A “chemotherapeutic agent” is used to connote a compound or composition that is administered in the treatment of cancer. One subtype of chemotherapy known as biochemotherapy involves the combination of a chemotherapy with a biological therapy. The chemotherapeutic agents described above are examples of chemotherapeutic agents that can be used with the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChemotherapeutic agents and methods of administration, dosages, and the like, are well known to those of skill in the art (see for example, the “Physicians Desk Reference”, Goodman & Gilman's “The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics”, “Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences”, and “The Merck Index, Eleventh Edition”, incorporated herein by reference in relevant parts), and can be combined with the invention in light of the disclosures herein. Some variation in dosage will necessarily occur depending on the condition of the subject being treated. The person responsible for administration will, in any event, determine the appropriate dose for the individual subject. Examples of specific chemotherapeutic agents and dose regimes also are described herein. Of course, all of these dosages and agents described herein are exemplary rather than limiting, and other doses or agents can be used by a skilled artisan for a specific patient or application. Any dosage in-between these points, or range derivable therein also is expected to be of use in the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n2. Radiotherapeutic Agents\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRadiotherapeutic agents include radiation and waves that induce DNA damage for example, y-irradiation, X-rays, proton beam therapies (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,760,395 and 4,870,287), UV-irradiation, microwaves, electronic emissions, radioisotopes, and the like. Therapy can be achieved by irradiating the localized tumor site with the above described forms of radiations. It is most likely that all of these agents affect a broad range of damaged DNA, on the precursors of DNA, the replication and repair of DNA, and the assembly and maintenance of chromosomes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRadiotherapeutic agents and methods of administration, dosages, and the like, are well known to those of skill in the art, and can be combined with the invention in light of the disclosures herein. For example, dosage ranges for X-rays range from daily doses of 50 to 200 roentgens for prolonged periods of time (3 to 4 weeks), to single doses of 2000 to 6000 roentgens. Dosage ranges for radioisotopes vary widely, and depend on the half-life of the isotope, the strength and type of radiation emitted, and the uptake by the neoplastic cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n3. Surgery\n\n\n \n \n \n \nApproximately 60% of persons with cancer will undergo surgery of some type, which includes, for example, preventative, diagnostic or staging, curative and palliative surgery. Surgery, and in particular a curative surgery, can be used in conjunction with other therapies, such as the present invention and one or more other agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCurative surgery includes resection in which all or part of cancerous tissue is physically removed, excised and/or destroyed. It is further contemplated that surgery can remove, excise or destroy superficial cancers, precancers, or incidental amounts of normal tissue. Treatment by surgery includes for example, tumor resection, laser surgery, cryosurgery, electrosurgery, and miscopically controlled surgery (Mohs' surgery). Tumor resection refers to physical removal of at least part of a tumor. Upon excision of part of all of cancerous cells, tissue, or tumor, a cavity can be formed in the body.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther treatment of the tumor or area of surgery can be accomplished by perfusion, direct injection or local application of the area with an additional anti-cancer agent. Such treatment can be repeated, for example, about every 1 day, about every 2 days, about every 3 days, about every 4 days, about every 5 days, about every 6 days, or about every 7 days, or about every 1 week, about every 2 weeks, about every 3 weeks, about every 4 weeks, or about every 5 weeks or about every 1 month, about every 2 months, about every 3 months, about every 4 months, about every 5 months, about every 6 months, about every 7 months, about every 8 months, about every 9 months, about every 10 months, about every 11 months, or about every 12 months. These treatments can be of varying dosages as well.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n4. Immunotherapeutic Agents\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn immunotherapeutic agent generally relies on the use of immune effector cells and molecules to target and destroy cancer cells. The immune effector can be, for example, an antibody specific for some marker on the surface of a tumor cell. The antibody alone can serve as an effector of therapy or it can recruit other cells to actually effect cell killing. The antibody also can be conjugated to a drug or toxin (e.g., a chemotherapeutic agent, a radionuclide, a ricin A chain, a cholera toxin, a pertussis toxin, and the like) and serve merely as a targeting agent. Such antibody conjugates are referred to immunotoxins, and are well known in the art (see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,686,072; 5,578,706; 4,792,447; 5,045,451; 4,664,911, and 5,767,072, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in their entirety). Alternatively, the effector can be a lymphocyte carrying a surface molecule that interacts, either directly or indirectly, with a tumor cell target. Various effector cells include cytotoxic T cells and NK cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect of immunotherapy, the tumor cell must bear some marker that is amenable to targeting, i.e., is not present on the majority of other cells. Many tumor markers exist and any of these can be suitable for targeting in the context of the present invention. Common tumor markers include carcinoembryonic antigen, prostate specific antigen, urinary tumor associated antigen, fetal antigen, tyrosinase (p97), gp68, TAG-72, HMFG, Sialyl Lewis Antigen, MucA, MucB, PLAP, estrogen receptor, laminin receptor, erb B and p155.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n5. Genetic Therapy Agents\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA tumor cell resistant to agents, such as chemotherapeutic agent and radiotherapeutic agents, represents a major problem in clinical oncology. One goal of current cancer research is to find ways to improve the efficacy of one or more anti-cancer agents by combining such an agent with gene therapy. For example, the herpes simplex-thymidine kinase (HS-tK) gene, when delivered to brain tumors by a retroviral vector system, successfully induced susceptibility to the antiviral agent ganciclovir (Culver, et al., 1992). In the context of the present invention, it is contemplated that gene therapy could be used similarly in conjunction with the nanoemulsion particle or nanocapsule composition and/or other agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nC. Vaccine Therapies\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe presently disclosed nanocapsules or nanoemulsion particles also can be used as a vaccine delivery system. For example, as demonstrated herein below in Example 10, the presently disclosed nanocapsules or nanoemulsion particles can comprise a viral protein capable of eliciting a humoral or cellular-based immune response.\n\n\n \nV.

The following Examples are offered by way of illustration and not by way of limitation.\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\n\nMaterials and Cell Culture\n\n\n \n \n \nPaclitaxel, glyceryl tridodecanoate, PBS, and \nTween\n 80 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, Mo., United States of America). Emulsifying wax and stearyl alcohol were purchased from Spectrum Chemicals (Gardena, Calif., United States of America). Polyoxyethylene 20-stearyl ether (BRIJ 78) was obtained from Uniqema (Wilmington, Del., United States of America). D-alpha-\ntocopheryl polyethylene glycol\n 1000 succinate (TPGS) was purchased from Eastman Chemicals (Kingsport, Tenn., United States of America). MIGLYOL 812 is a mixed caprylic (C\n8:0\n) and capric (C\n10:0\n) fatty acid triglyceride and was obtained from Sasol Germany GmbH (Witten, Germany). Dialyzers with a molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) of 8000 were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, Mo., United States of America). Microcon Y-100 with \nMWCO\n 100 kDa was purchased from Millipore (Bedford, Mass., United States of America). Ethanol USP grade was purchased from Pharmco-AAPER (Brookfield, Conn., United States of America). TAXOL was obtained from Mayne Pharma Inc. (Paramus, N.J., United States of America). The human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231, was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and was maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were cultured at 37° C. in a humidified incubator with 5% CO\n2 \nand maintained in exponential growth phase by periodic subcultivation.\n\n\n \n \nPreparation of Nanoparticles from Microemulsion Precursors\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNanoparticles were prepared from warm o/w microemulsion precursors as previously described with some modification (Oyewumi and Mumper, 2002). Defined amounts of oil phases and surfactants were weighed into glass vials and heated to 65° C. One (1) mL of filtered and deionized (D.I.) water pre-heated at 65° C. was added into the mixture of melted or liquid oils and surfactants. The mixture were stirred for 20 min at 65° C. and then cooled to room temperature. To prepare PX NPs, 150 μg of PX dissolved in ethanol was added directly to the melted or liquid oil and surfactant and ethanol was removed by N\n2 \nstream prior to initiating the process described above. Particle size and size distribution of NPs were measured using a N5 Submicron Particle Size Analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, Calif., United States of America). Ten microliters of nanoparticles were diluted with 1 mL of D.I. water to reach within the density range required by the instrument, and particle size analysis was performed at 90° light scattering at 25° C.\n\n\n \nDevelopment of Prototype Nanoparticles by Sequential Simplex Optimization\n\n\n \n \n \nBTM Nanoparticles Comprised of MIGLYOL 812, \nBRIJ\n 78 and TPGS\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMIGLYOL 812 and stearyl alcohol were chosen as oil phases, and \nBRIJ\n 78 and TPGS were selected as the surfactants. Taguchi array L-9 (3\n4\n) was first used to help set up the starting simplex for sequential simplex optimization. Three levels for each excipient and Taguchi array are presented in Table 2A. As directed by the results from Taguchi array, \n \n \ntrial\n \n \n 3, 5, and 9 were used for the starting simplex (Table 2B). Sequential simplex optimization then was performed as previously described following the variable-size simplex rules (Walters et al., 1991). Desirability functions previously developed for the simultaneous optimization of different response variables (criteria) (Derringer, 1980) were used to evaluate the results using particle size and polydispersity index (P.I.) as the response variables. The resultant particle size and P.I. were transformed to d\nsize \nand d\nP.I. \nwithin 0-1 interval, respectively\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n{\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nY\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n≤\n\n\na\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nY\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\na\n\n\n\n\n\n\nb\n\n\n-\n\n\na\n\n\n\n\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\nS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na\n\n\n<\n\n\n\n\nY\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n<\n\n\nb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nY\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n≥\n\n\nb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n1\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn Equation (1), the variable “i” indicates particle size or P.I. The limits were from a=70 nm to b=250 nm for particle size, and from a=0.05 to b=1.2 for P.I. For these optimization experiments, particle size and P.I. were given equal importance; thus, the constant s=1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe overall contribution of all responses is presented as a single D value as calculated by Equation (2):\n\n\n \n \n \n \nD\n=(\nd\n \nparticle size\n \n×d\n \nP.I.\n)\n1/2\n  Equation (2)\n\n\n\n \n \nAfter the sequential simplex optimization, MIGLYOL 812, \nBRIJ\n 78 and TPGS were chosen to form BTM NPs. Four different compositions based on the results from sequential simplex optimization were tested (Table 2C) wherein two milliliter NP formulations were prepared for each composition.\n\n\n \nG78 Nanoparticles Comprised of Glyceryl Tridodecanoate and \nBrij\n 78\n\n\n \n \n \nG78 nanoparticles were optimized using MultiSimplex software (CambridgeSoft Corporation, Cambridge, Mass., United States of America). The variable-size simplex rules also were used in this optimization, and response variables included particle size, P.I. and the peak numbers in nanoparticle distribution. The limits were from a=50 nm to b=200 nm for particle size, and from a=0.01 to b=0.4 for P.I., and from a=1 to b=2 for peak numbers. Two milliliter NP formulations were prepared for each composition.\n\n\n \nLyophilization of PX NPs\n\n\n \n \n \nTo determine the effect of lyophilization on the NPs, blank and PX NPs in the presence or absence of 5% lactose were lyophilized using a VIRTIS lyophilizer (SP Industries, Gardiner, N.Y., United States of America). Two milliliters of each sample were rapidly frozen at −40° C. and then lyophilized using a program of 7.5 h at −10° C. for primary drying and 7.5 h at 25° C. for secondary drying at 100 mTorr. The resultant lyophilized products were reconstituted in 2 mL of D.I. water using a plate shaker for 5 min. The particle sizes of reconstituted lyophilized NPs from six different batches were measured as described above.\n\n\n \nCharacterization of Paclitaxel G78 and BTM Nanoparticles\n\n\nParticle Size and Zeta Potential Measurement\n\n\n \n \n \nNanoparticles were analyzed for particle size and size distribution as described above. Ten microliters of blank NPs and PX NPs were diluted with 1 mL of D.I. water and 10 μL of PBS buffer (pH 7.4) was added for measurement of Zeta potentials using Zetasizer Nano ZEN2600 (Malvern Instruments, Worcs, United Kingdom).\n\n\n \nDetermination of Drug Loading and Entrapment Efficiency\n\n\n \n \n \nThe concentration of PX was quantified by HPLC using a Thermo Finnigan Surveyer HPLC System and an Inertsil ODS-3 column (4.6×150 mm) (GL Sciences Inc.) preceded by an Agilent guard column (Zorbax SB-\nC\n 18, 4.6×12.5 mm). The mobile phase was water-acetonitrile (40:60, v/v) at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min with PX detection at 227 nm. For the paclitaxel standard curve, paclitaxel was dissolved in methanol. To quantify PX in NPs, 1 part of PX NPs in water were dissolved in 8 parts of methanol. PX BTM NPs containing 30% of 7-epi PX was dissolved in methanol and then serially diluted in methanol to prepare the standard curve of 7-epi PX. Drug loading and entrapment efficiencies were determined by separating free PX from PX-loaded NPs using a Microcon Y-100, and then measuring PX in NP-containing supernatants as described above. To ensure mass balance, the filtrates also were assayed for PX. PX loading and PX entrapment efficiency were calculated as follows:\n\n\n \n \n \n% drug loading=[(drug entrapped in NPs)/(weight of oil)]×100% (w/w)\n\n\n\n \n \n \n% drug entrapment efficiency=[(drug entrapped in NPs)/(total drug added into NP preparation)]×100% (w/w)\n\n\n\n \nParticle Size Stability of NPs in 4° C. and 37° C.\n\n\n \n \n \nThe physical stability of G78 and BTM nanoparticle suspensions was assessed over storage at 4° C. for five months. Prior to particle size measurement, NP suspensions were allowed to equilibrate to room temperature. The stability of all NP suspensions also was assessed at 37° C. in 10 mM PBS, pH 7.4 by adding 100 μL NP suspensions to 13 mL PBS buffer with a water-bath shaker mixing at 150 rpm. At each time interval, 1 mL aliquots were removed and allowed to equilibrate to room temperature prior to particle size measurement.\n\n\n \nDSC Analysis for G78 NPs\n\n\n \n \n \nDifferential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis was performed to determine the physical state of the core (glyceryl tridodecanoate) lipid. Blank G78 or PX G78 nanoparticle suspensions were concentrated about 20-fold using Microcon Y-100 at 4° C. The concentrated NPs were: (1) analyzed by DSC immediately; or (2) transferred to an aluminum pan, which was placed in a desiccator for two days at room temperature prior to DSC analysis. As controls, bulk glyceryl tridodecanoate (5 mg), BRIJ 78 (5 mg) and the bulk mixture of glyceryl tridodecanoate (3.4 mg) and BRIJ 78 (8 mg) were placed in aluminum pans for DSC analysis (PerkinElmer, Norwalk, Conn.). Heating curves were recorded using a scan rate of 1° C./min from 15° C. to 66° C.\n\n\n \nIn-Vitro Release Studies\n\n\n \n \n \nPX release studies (n=4) were completed at 37° C. by the dialysis method using PBS with 0.1\n% Tween\n 80 as release medium. Before release studies, the solubility of PX in release medium was measured. Briefly, extra amounts of paclitaxel were added into 2 mL of release medium until saturation was attained. After centrifuge, the concentration of PX in the supernatant was determined by HPLC as described above. For release studies, one milliliter (1 mL) of PX G78 NPs was purified with a Microcon Y-100 and re-suspended into 1 mL D.I. water. The concentration of PX in re-suspended PX G78 NPs was measured by HPLC as described above. Eight hundred microliters of purified PX G78 NPs, PX BTM NPs and reconstituted lyo BTM NPs were placed into a regenerated cellulose dialysis membrane (MWCO 8000 Da) submerged in 40 mL PBS with 0.1\n% Tween\n 80, respectively, and then shaken in a water bath at a speed of 150 rpm at 37° C. Free PX also was used as a control. At predetermined times, 200 μL aliquots were taken from outside of the dialysis membrane, and replaced with 200 μL fresh media. PX was measured by HPLC as described above. Mass balance was confirmed by measuring PX concentration inside the dialysis membranes after 72 h. In addition, the particle sizes of PX NPs inside the dialysis membranes were measured when release studies were terminated (at 72 h).\n\n\n \nIn-Vitro Cytotoxicity Studies\n\n\n \n \n \nThe cytotoxicity of PX NPs was tested in human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells using the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay (Papazisis et al., 1997). Cells were seeded into 96-well plates at 1.5×10\n4 \ncells/well and cells were allowed to attach overnight. Cells were incubated for 48 h with drug equivalent concentrations ranging from 10,000 nM to 0.01 nM for TAXOL, PX-loaded NPs and blank NPs. The SRB assay was performed and IC50 values were determined. Briefly, the cell lines were fixed with cold 10% trichloroacetic acid and stained using 0.4% SRB dissolved in 1% acetic acid. The bound dye was solubilized with 10 mM tris base and the absorbance was measured at 490 nm using a microplate reader. IC50 values were calculated based on the percentage of treatment over control. All groups included three independent experiments (N=3) with triplicates (n=3) for each experiment.\n\n\n \nStatistical Analysis\n\n\n \n \n \nStatistical comparisons were made with ANOVA followed by pair-wise comparisons using Student's t test using GraphPad Prism software. Results were considered significant at 95% confidence interval (p<0.05).\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\nDevelopment of New Lipid-Based Paclitaxel Nanoparticles Using Sequential Simplex Optimization\n\n\n \n \n \nSequential Simplex Optimization was utilized to identify promising new lipid-based paclitaxel nanoparticles having useful attributes. The objective of this Example was to develop CREMOPHOR-free lipid-based paclitaxel (PX) nanoparticle formulations prepared from warm microemulsion precursors. To identify and optimize new nanoparticles, experimental design was performed combining Taguchi array and sequential simplex optimization. The combination of Taguchi array and sequential simplex optimization efficiently directed the design of paclitaxel nanoparticles. Two optimized paclitaxel nanoparticles (NPs) were obtained: (1) G78 NPs composed of glyceryl tridodecanoate (GT) and polyoxyethylene 20-stearyl ether (BRIJ 78); and (2) BTM NPs composed of MIGLYOL 812, \nBRIJ\n 78 and d-alpha-\ntocopheryl polyethylene glycol\n 1000 succinate (TPGS). Both nanoparticles successfully entrapped paclitaxel at a final concentration of 150 μg/mL (over 6% drug loading) with particle sizes less than 200 nm and over 85% of entrapment efficiency. These novel paclitaxel nanoparticles were stable at 4° C. over three months and in PBS at 37° C. over 102 hours as measured by physical stability. Release of paclitaxel was slow and sustained without initial burst release. Cytotoxicity studies in MDA-MB-231 cancer cells showed that both nanoparticles have similar anticancer activities compared to TAXOL. Interestingly, PX BTM nanocapsules could be lyophilized without cryoprotectants. The lyophilized powder comprised only of PX BTM NPs in water could be rapidly rehydrated with complete retention of original physicochemical properties, in-vitro release properties, and cytotoxicity profile.\n\n\n \nExample 3\n\n\nDevelopment of BTM Nanoparticles by Taguchi Array and Sequential Simplex Optimization\n\n\n \n \n \nIt has previously been reported that a combination of liquid and solid lipid oils enhance drug loading and stability in nanoparticles as compared to a only a solid lipid core (Muller and Radtke, 2002; Manjunath et al., 2005). In the initial development of NPs, a combination oil phase of MIGLYOL 812 (liquid oil) and stearyl alcohol (solid oil) were selected, in addition to two potential surfactants, \nBRIJ\n 78 and TPGS. Based on these four variables (excipients), Taguchi array was carried out to determine the extent of compositions to which the starting simplex could be formed efficiently.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTaguchi's orthogonal array for 3 \nlevels\n 4 variables (L-9 3\n4\n) is shown in Table 2A. As depicted in Table 2A, \n \n \ntrials\n \n \n 3, 5 and 9 gave the most promising results. Thus, the compositions of these three trials (3, 5, and 9) were used to construct the starting simplex in the sequential simplex optimization (Table 2B). As described in the methods section, there were two basic criteria for current nanoparticle formulation: particle size (<200 nm) and P.I. (<0.35). The D value from desirability functions including particle size and P.I. as response variables was used to evaluate the result of each experiment. Interestingly, the simplex (\ntrial\n 6 in Table 2B) identified an initial NP formulation that did not contain stearyl alcohol (the solid oil component), but was comprised of MIGLYOL 812, \nBRIJ\n 78 and TPGS. Thus, as directed by sequential simplex optimization, subsequent experiments focused on these three excipients. Four different compositions were used to prepare nanoparticles as shown in Table 2C. Among them, \ntrial\n 2 resulted in optimized NPs having a mean particle size of 149 nm and P.I. of 0.328. Interestingly, due to the relatively low concentration of the resulting NPs, 150 μg/mL of paclitaxel could not be entrapped into these NPs. However, when each component was increased by a factor of 2.5, the more concentrated NP formulation was able to accommodate the desired concentration of PX. This final BTM NP formulation consisted of 2.5 mg of MIGLYOL 812, 1.5 mg of TPGS and 3.5 mg of BRIJ 78 in 1 mL water with 150 μg/mL of paclitaxel.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaguchi array for the development of BTM nanoparticles.†\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nStearyl\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBRIJ 78\n\n\nTPGS\n\n\nAlcohol\n\n\nMIGLYOL 812\n\n\nParticle Size\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrial\n\n\n(mg)\n\n\n(mg)\n\n\n(mg)\n\n\n(mg)\n\n\n(nm)\n\n\nP.I.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n1.6\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n0.6\n\n\n1.4\n\n\n35\n\n\n1.210\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n1.6\n\n\n0.9\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n193.5\n\n\n0.978\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n1.6\n\n\n0.6\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n0.6\n\n\n118.4\n\n\n0.159\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n0.6\n\n\n25\n\n\n1.435\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n0.9\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n1.4\n\n\n212.9\n\n\n0.307\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n0.6\n\n\n0.6\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n282.6\n\n\n0.897\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n0.7\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n130.5\n\n\n0.826\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n0.7\n\n\n0.9\n\n\n0.6\n\n\n0.6\n\n\n315\n\n\n1.685\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n0.7\n\n\n0.6\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n1.4\n\n\n234.6\n\n\n0.355\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n†Listed are the compositions per 1 mL nanoparticle suspensions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSequential Simplex Optimization for the\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment of BTM Nanoparticles.†\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nBRIJ\n\n\n \n\n\n \nStearyl\n \n \nMIGLYOL\n\n\nParticle\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n78\n\n\nTPGS\n\n\nAlcohol\n\n\n812\n\n\nSize\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrial\n\n\nMovement\n\n\n(mg)\n\n\n(mg)\n\n\n(mg)\n\n\n(mg)\n\n\n(nm)\n\n\nP.I.\n\n\nd\nsize\n \n\n\nd\nP.I.\n \n\n\n \nD\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\\\n\n\n1.6\n\n\n0.6\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n0.6\n\n\n35.6\n\n\n0.070\n\n\n0\n\n\n0.017\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\\\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n0.9\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n1.4\n\n\n197.6\n\n\n0.449\n\n\n0.709\n\n\n0.347\n\n\n0.496\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\\\n\n\n0.7\n\n\n0.6\n\n\n0.8\n\n\n1.4\n\n\n186.3\n\n\n0.360\n\n\n0.646\n\n\n0.270\n\n\n0.417\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\\\n\n\n1.6\n\n\n0.9\n\n\n1.6\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n309.2\n\n\n1.079\n\n\n0\n\n\n0.895\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\\\n\n\n0.7\n\n\n2.1\n\n\n1.6\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n182.7\n\n\n1.028\n\n\n0.626\n\n\n0.85\n\n\n0.730\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nR (1, 2, 3, 5)\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n0\n\n\n1.1\n\n\n192.4\n\n\n0.230\n\n\n0.680\n\n\n0.157\n\n\n0.326\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n†Listed are the compositions per 1 mL nanoparticle suspensions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2C\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment of BTM nanoparticles.†\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBRIJ 78\n\n\nTPGS\n\n\nMIGLYOL 812\n\n\nParticle Size\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrial\n\n\n(mg)\n\n\n(mg)\n\n\n(mg)\n\n\n(nm)\n\n\nP.I.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n1.1\n\n\n192.4\n\n\n0.23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n1.4\n\n\n0.6\n\n\n1\n\n\n149\n\n\n0.328\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n0.9\n\n\n0.6\n\n\n1.4\n\n\n190\n\n\n0.103\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n1.5\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n309.2\n\n\n1.079\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n†Listed are the compositions per 1 mL nanoparticle suspensions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 4\n\n\nDevelopment of G78 Nanoparticles by Sequential Simplex Optimization\n\n\n \n \n \nA solid lipid, glyceryl tridodecanoate was selected as an alternative to lipid-based NPs. Glyceryl tridodecanoate was selected as a possibly direct replacement of E. Wax in the previously described E78 NPs due to the enhanced solubility of PX in glyceryl tridodecanoate. Thus, in this simplex optimization, there were two variables, glyceryl tridodecanoate (oil) and BRIJ 78 (surfactant). The initial simplex was directed by the MultiSimplex software based on the reference values of 4 mg for glyceryl tridodecanoate and 8 mg for \nBRIJ\n 78 in 2 mL water. Simplex optimization then proceeded as shown in Table 3. After 8 trials, the optimized composition reached nearly constant values in trials 9-11 of 1.6-1.9 mg for glyceryl tridodecanoate and 4-4.2 mg for \nBRIJ\n 78. Finally, \ntrial\n 11 was identified as the most optimized composition because the composition gave the smallest particle size and the formulation could easily accommodate 150 μg/mL of paclitaxel.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimplex optimization for the development of G78 nanoparticles.†\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nParticle\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nGlyceryl\n\n\nSize\n\n\n \n\n\n \nPeak\n \n \n \n\n\nTrial\n\n\nBRIJ\n \n \n \n 78\n\n\nTridodecanoate\n\n\n(nm)\n\n\nP.I.\n\n\n#\na\n \n\n\nMembership\nb\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n3.5\n\n\n1.5\n\n\n157.2\n\n\n0.3 \n\n\n2\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n4.5\n\n\n1.8\n\n\n153.5\n\n\n0.36 \n\n\n1\n\n\n4.77E−02\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n3.8\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n194.6\n\n\n0.275\n\n\n1\n\n\n1.73E−02\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n4.8\n\n\n2.8\n\n\n195.3\n\n\n0.25 \n\n\n2\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 5*\n\n\n3.8\n\n\n1.8\n\n\n161.9\n\n\n0.258\n\n\n1\n\n\n0.138\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n4.5\n\n\n1.1\n\n\n—c\n\n\n—\n\n\n—\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n4.0\n\n\n2.1\n\n\n199  \n\n\n0.282\n\n\n1\n\n\n3.03E−03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n3.3\n\n\n2.2\n\n\n—\n\n\n—\n\n\n—\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 9*\n\n\n4.2\n\n\n1.9\n\n\n161.3\n\n\n0.274\n\n\n1\n\n\n0.125\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10 \n\n\n4.0\n\n\n1.6\n\n\n156.4\n\n\n0.325\n\n\n1\n\n\n8.38E−02\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11*\n\n\n4.0\n\n\n1.7\n\n\n143.6\n\n\n0.369\n\n\n1\n\n\n4.48E−02\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n†Listed are the compositions per 1 mL nanoparticle suspensions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \na\nThe peak numbers in nanoparticle distribution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nb\nCurrent membership has the same meaning with D value in desirability functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nc\nUnable to form nanoparticles based on this composition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 5\n\n\nCharacterization of Nanoparticles\n\n\nLyophilization of BTM and G78 Nanoparticles\n\n\n \n \n \nThe lyophilization of BTM NPs and PX BTM NPs in water alone resulted in the formation of dry white cakes that were rapidly rehydrated with water within less than 15 seconds to produce clear NP suspensions wherein the NPs showed complete retention of original physicochemical properties and in-vitro release properties (\nFIG. 2\n and \nFIG. 6\n). In contrast, lyophilized G78 NPs or PX G78 NPs in the presence or absence of 5% lactose as a cryoprotectant could not be rehydrated in water and produced aggregates/agglomerates after rehydration.\n\n\n \nParticle Size and Zeta Potential\n\n\n \n \n \nAll tested nanoparticles had mean particle size diameters less than 200 nm with zeta potentials of about −6 mV regardless of PX entrapment. The entrapment of paclitaxel had no influence on the mean particle size of G78 and BTM nanoparticles (Table 4). Interestingly, rehydrated lyophilized NPs had smaller particle sizes for both blank BTM NPs and PX BTM NPs (\nFIG. 2\n).\n\n\n \nDrug Loading and Entrapment Efficiencies of Paclitaxel in Nanoparticles\n\n\n \n \n \nHPLC analysis showed that the 7-epi isomer of PX was present at about 30% when PX was formulated in NPs in water. Further analysis showed that the epimerization occurred during preparation of the PX NPs (MacEachern-Keith et al., 1997). However, epimerization at C7 is reversible and can be prevented by forming PX NPs at slightly acidic pH (Tian and Stella, 2008). The 7-epi isomer of PX did not form when PX BTM NPs were prepared in 10% lactose (pH=5) or 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH=6). The slope of the standard curve for 7-epi PX was not statistically different from that for PX (data not shown). Thus, the standard curve for PX was used to determine the total PX concentration (PX plus 7-epi PX).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe entrapment efficiencies for PX G78 NPs and PX BTM NPs were 85% and 97.5%, respectively, as shown in Table 4. The mass balance of PX was 85.4±3.3% and 102.7±2.0% (mean±SD, n=3) for PX G78 NPs and PX BTM NPs, respectively. The results showed that paclitaxel was incorporated into nanoparticles at weight ratio of over 6% of the selected lipid core. Finally, rehydrated lyophilized PX BTM NPs showed 93.1% of entrapment efficiency, which was not statistically different to that of non-lyophilized PX BTM NPs (p>0.05).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhysiochemical properties of PX G78, PX BTM, and lyo PX BTM nanoparticles (n = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n% Drug\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTheoretical\n\n\nMean\na\n \n\n\n \n\n\nZeta\n\n\nLoading\n\n\n% Drug\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLoading\n\n\nDiameter\n\n\n \n\n\nPotential\n\n\n(w/w,\n\n\nEntrapment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormulations\n\n\n(μg/mL)\n\n\n(nm)\n\n\nP.I.\n\n\n(mV)\n\n\ndrug/oil)\n\n\nEfficiency\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nPX G78 NPs\n \n\n\n150\n\n\n169.2 ± 8.1\n\n\n0.302 ± 0.027\n\n\n−6.6 ± 2.6 \n\n\n7.5\n\n\n85.4 ± 3.3\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nPX BTM NPs\n \n\n\n150\n\n\n190.5 ± 7.8\n\n\n0.279 ± 0.054\n\n\n−5.9 ± 1.78\n\n\n6\n\n\n97.5 ± 2.6\n#\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLyo \nPX BTM NPs\n \n\n\n150\n\n\n130.0 ± 7.8\n\n\n0.284 ± 0.042\n\n\n−5.1 ± 1.00\n\n\n6\n\n\n93.1 ± 4.1\n#\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \na\nThe data are presented as the mean of the mean particle size of nanoparticles in different batches ± SD (n = 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n#\np > 0.05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nPhysical Stability of Nanoparticles\n\n\n \n \n \nThe physical stability of paclitaxel nanoparticles was evaluated by monitoring changes of particle sizes at 4° C. upon long-term storage, as well as short term stability at 37° C. in PBS to simulate physiological conditions. The particle sizes of G78 and BTM nanoparticles with or without paclitaxel did not significantly change at 4° C. for five months (\nFIG. 3\n). To test stability of nanoparticles in physiological condition, G78 NPs, BTM NPs and reconstituted lyophilized BTM NPs were incubated in PBS at 37° C. for 102 h. Particle sizes of PX-loaded NPs and blank NPs slightly increased after 72 h incubation. The data for PX-loaded NPs are shown in \nFIG. 4\n, whereas the data for blank NPs are not shown.\n\n\n \nPhysical State of the Core Lipid in G78 Nanoparticles\n\n\n \n \n \nIt has been reported that glyceryl tridodecanoate (also called ‘trilaurin’) existed as super-cooled melts rather than in a solid state in nanoparticles (Bunjes et al., 1996; Siekmann and Westesen, 1994). Thus, in the presently disclosed subject matter, DSC analysis was used to determine the physical state of glyceryl tridodecanoate in G78 nanoparticles. Bulk glyceryl tridodecanoate showed the melting peak at 46° C., while \nBRIJ\n 78 had two melting peaks at 35° C. and 40° C. The concentrated blank and PX G78 NPs clearly showed an endothermal peak at 43° C. (\nFIG. 5B\n). After drying of the NPs, two other peaks at 35° C. and 40° C. appeared for blank or PX G78 NPs (\nFIG. 5A\n). The endothermal peaks of BRIJ 78 intensified after drying suggesting that \nmore BRIJ\n 78 existed in the solid state. The melting peak of glyceryl tridodecanoate in nanoparticles shifted to lower temperature and was broader compared to that of bulk material. However, the endothermic peak at 43° C. for glyceryl tridodecanoate indicated that glyceryl tridodecanoate retained a solid state in G78 nanoparticles.\n\n\n \n \nIn-Vitro Release of Paclitaxel from Nanoparticles\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPaclitaxel has been reported to have aqueous solubility of 0.7-30 μg/mL. Therefore, to maintain sink conditions, PBS with 0.1\n% Tween\n 80 was used as the release medium for the in-vitro release studies of paclitaxel. The solubility of paclitaxel in release medium at room temperature was 10.8±0.3 μg/mL (mean±SD, n=3) as measured by HPLC. Thus, for the release studies, 800 μL of PX NPs containing 150 μg/mL of paclitaxel were placed into 40 mL of release medium. The cumulative release of paclitaxel from PX NPs is shown in \nFIG. 6\n. Free PX was released completely within 4 h. For all tested PX NPs, although the initial release rates were greater between 0 and 8 h, no initial burst of PX was observed. After 8 h, the release rates were much lower. The results showed that the mean cumulative release of PX after 72 h was 40%, 50% and 53% from PX G78 NPs, PX BTM NPs and reconstituted lyophilized PX BTM NPs, respectively. Mass balance analysis for PX G78 NPs, PX BTM NPs and lyophilized PX NPs showed that 79.2±8.6%, 98.3±24.2%, and 73.4±16.6% (mean±SD, n=4) of the PX was recovered, respectively. There were no other PX degradation peaks, except for 7-epi PX, observed by HPLC during the course of the studies. Moreover, lyophilized PX BTM NPs showed the same release profile as compared to PX BTM NPs (p>0.05 at each time point). Also, the particle sizes of all tested nanoparticles did not change significantly after 72 h.\n\n\n \nIn Vitro Cytotoxicity Studies\n\n\n \n \n \nThe cytotoxicity of PX NPs was tested in human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells using the SRB assay (Table 5). PX NPs showed a clear dose-dependent cytotoxicity in MDA-MB-231 cells. There was no statistical significance in the IC50 values of PX BTM NPs and lyophilized PX BTM NPs compared to commercial TAXOL. However, the IC50 of PX G78 NPs had comparable but statistically different IC50 values compared to TAXOL. Blank NPs showed some cytotoxicity but only the paclitaxel equivalent dose of 617.3 nM and 354.6 nM of PX, which corresponds to a total NP concentration of 26.4 μg/mL and 15.1 μg/mL for blank G78 NPs and BTM NPs, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIC50 Values of Paclitaxel Nanoparticles in MDA-MB-231 Cells at 48 h\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nG78 NPs\n\n\n \nBTM NPs #\n1\n\n\n \nBTM NPs #\n2\na\n \n\n\nLyo \nBTM\n \n \nNPs #\n \n2\na\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormulations\n\n\nTAXOL\n\n\nPX NPs*\n\n\nBL NPs\n\n\nPX NPs\n#\n \n\n\nBL NPs\n##\n \n\n\nPX NPs\n#\n \n\n\nBL NPs\n##\n \n\n\nPX NPs\n#\n \n\n\nBL NPs\n##\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\n7.2 ± 2.9\n\n\n21.0 ± 1.5\n\n\n617.3 ± 356\n\n\n7.6 ± 1.2\n\n\n354.6 ± 59.0\n\n\n15.1 ± 6.8\n\n\n342.7 ± 119.6\n\n\n15.6 ± 10.6\n\n\n256.1 ± 128.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nData are presented as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments (N = 3) with triplicate (n = 3) measurements for each sample/concentration tested.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \na\nLyo \nBTM NPs #\n2 were directly lyophilized from \nBTM NPs #\n2.

Experimental design was performed combining Taguchi array and sequential simplex optimization. The combination of Taguchi array and sequential simplex optimization efficiently directed the design of paclitaxel nanoparticles. Two optimized paclitaxel nanoparticles (NPs) were obtained, G78 and BTM. G78 was found to be a solid lipid nanoparticle formulation, whereas BTM is thought to be a nanoemulsion particle or nanocapsule-based formulation. Both nanoparticles successfully entrapped paclitaxel at a final concentration of 150 μg/mL with particle sizes less than 200 nm and over 85% of entrapment efficiency. These novel paclitaxel nanoparticles were stable at 4° C. over five months and in PBS at 37° C. over 102 hours. Release of paclitaxel was slow and sustained without initial burst release. Cytotoxicity studies in MDA-MB-231 cancer cells showed that both nanoparticles have similar anticancer activities compared to TAXOL. Both formulations have been shown to overcome P-glycoprotein (P-gp) mediated resistance in human cancer cells via ATP depletion. PX BTM formulations are stable in suspension for at least 2 months at 4° C. Interestingly, it was surprisingly found that PX BTM NPs could be lyophilized without cryoprotectants. The lyophilized cakes comprised only of PX BTM NPs in water could be rapidly rehydrated with complete retention of original physicochemical properties, in-vitro release properties, and cytotoxicity profile. These nano-based formulations can be used for many different types of poorly-water soluble and insoluble drugs ideally for parenteral administration. Ideally, the BTM formulation can be lyophilized without cryoprotectants to retain all measured properties.\n\n\n \nDiscussion\n\n\n \n \n \nPaclitaxel (PX) is an important agent in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. However, the optimal clinical use of paclitaxel is limited due to its poor aqueous solubility. Commercial paclitaxel formulation, TAXOL, is generally associated with hypersensitivity reactions that results from the excipient CREMOPHOR EL in TAXOL. To overcome the problems, numerous lipid-based and CREMOPHOR EL-free paclitaxel formulations have been investigated, such as liposomes (Zhang et al., 2005), solid lipid nanoparticles (Lee et al., 2007; van Vlerken et al., 2007), micelles (Sznitowska et al., 2008; Hassan et al., 2005), emulsions (Kan et al., 1999; Constantinides et al., 2000).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the presently disclosed subject matter, two median chain triglycerides, glyceryl tridodecanoate and MIGLYOL 812, were used to investigate new lipid-based nanoparticles for paclitaxel. Relative to other candidate oil phases, these two oils have high solvation ability for PX. Glyceryl tridodecanoate has a relatively low melting point of 46° C., which theoretically facilitates the preparation of lower crystalline cores that can accommodate a greater concentration of drug (Manjunath et al., 2005). MIGLYOL 812, being a liquid, forms a reservoir-type drug delivery systems in which poorly water-soluble drugs remain dissolved inside the liquid oil core and consequently a high payload and reduced release profile can be achieved (Fresta et al., 1996; Mosqueira et al., 2000). The final optimized nanoparticles, G78 NPs and BTM NPs, successfully entrapped paclitaxel with high loading and entrapment efficiency (Table 4). However, the selection of these two alternative oil phases required the development of optimized NP formulations. To facilitate the development of optimized NP formulations, the presently disclosed subject matter uses a methodology that combined Taguchi array and sequential simplex optimization. The simplex is made of k+1 vertex. The response of the experiment in each vertex is ranked and the “worst” response is replaced by the new set of variables for the next experiment. To efficiently move the simplex, there should be limited “worst” responses in the starting simplex. As new excipients are encountered and no known compositions could be referred (Table 2A-2C), Taguchi array was first performed to explore and provide the framework of the starting simplex. The final optimization was then completed using sequential simplex optimization. \nTrial\n 6 in Table 4 identified a new nanoparticle formulation composed of the liquid oil MIGLYOL 812. After further optimization, new BTM nanoparticles were developed. For new compositions, which are referred to as E78 NPs (Table 3), the sequential simplex optimization was directly used for investigation of G78 NPs. The results for both PX NPs indicate that this new methodology combining Taguchi array and sequential simplex optimization could efficiently and effectively be used to identify optimized nanoparticles. To the knowledge of the inventors, this is the first report to use the combination of Taguchi array and sequential simplex optimization for the development of nanoparticles.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt was observed that the affinity or the solubility of the drug in the lipid core can predict the entrapment efficiency and release rate of the drug from the nanoparticles. The optimal PX BTM and G78 nanoparticles were reproducible with high drug loading, as well as slow release of PX achieving about 50% and 40% after 72 h, respectively (\nFIG. 6\n). The slow and sustained release of paclitaxel without burst release from PX BTM and PX G78 nanoparticles indicated that paclitaxel was likely not present at or near the surface of nanoparticles, but instead is present within the core of the NPs, which is consistent with the enhanced solvation ability of MIGLYOL 812 and glyceryl tridodecanoate for PX.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMoreover, entrapment of paclitaxel into nanoparticles did not change the sizes of nanoparticles. All PX NPs had particle sizes less than 200 nm, even after 102 h of incubation in PBS at 37° C. These data provide some evidence that the nanoparticles can have sufficient stability in the blood after intravenous injection (\nFIG. 4\n). Cytotoxicity studies showed that both PX G78 and BTM nanoparticles had the same or comparable anticancer activity compared to commercial TAXOL in human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Therefore, both of these identified PX NP formulation can be good candidates for ligand-mediated tumor-targeted delivery of PX.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral studies have reported that glyceryl tridodecanoate is retained in lipid-based NPs in a super-cooled liquid state. If true, this semi-stable state of glyceryl tridodecanoate will likely affect the stability of nanoparticles due to the predicted phase transition of the super-cooled core to the crystalline phase. However, the presently disclosed subject matter using DSC analysis indicates that glyceryl tridodecanoate remained as a solid state in G78 NPs (\nFIG. 5\n), suggesting that the phenomenon of super-cooled glyceryl tridodecanoate in nanoparticles might be dependent on the process and compositions (i.e., surfactant) used to prepare the nanoparticles. Blank and PX G78 nanoparticles stored as liquid suspensions at 4° C. remained stable for several months and exhibited no change in particle size. Further, neither blank nor PX G78 nanoparticles showed a change in particle sizes after 102 h of incubation in PBS at 37° C., which indicates that the presently disclosed G78 nanoparticles, made with the lower melting GT, are not adversely affected by body temperature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWithout wishing to be bound by any one particular theory, it is thought that BTM NPs comprise a novel liquid reservoir or nanocapsule-type formulation. The liquid reservoir containing paclitaxel dissolved in MIGLYOL 812 is stabilized with the polymeric surfactants BRIJ 78 and TPGS. Higher drug loading of PX BTM nanoparticles demonstrates the advantage of this nanocapsule-type formulation as compared to the solid-core type G78 NP system. The BTM NPs were spontaneously formed after cooling from the warm o/w microemulsion precursors. Further, it is thought that the BTM NPs are nanocapsules and not nanoemulsions since nanoemulsions are non-equilibrium and thermodynamically unstable systems that cannot, by definition, form spontaneously without agitation or significant mechanical/shear mixing (Solans et al., 2005).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following observation was made serendipitously during the course of the present studies. In one attempt to concentrate NP formulations to analyze for entrapped PX, NPs were lyophilized in water. The BTM NP formulations produced uniform white cakes that could be rapidly rehydrated with complete retention of the original physicochemical properties, in-vitro release properties, and cytotoxicity profile. The inventors' experience, as well as that of others, suggests that it is often difficult to freeze-dry colloidal suspensions in the presence of cryoprotectants. To the inventors' knowledge, there are few or no reports of the successful lyophilization of colloidal suspensions without the use of a cryoprotectant that protects the nanoparticles from the stresses of the freezing and thawing process. Moreover, the lyophilization of nanoemulsion particles or nanocapsules is thought to be even more challenging due to the existence of the very thin and fragile lipid envelope that typically cannot withstand the mechanical stress of freezing (Schaffazick et al., 2003; Abdelwahed et al., 2006). Even in the presence of cryoprotectants, an increase of particle size is likely to occur (Heurtault et al., 2002). In the presently disclosed subject matter, the optimal BTM nanoparticles were successfully lyophilized without cryoprotectants. The non-collapsed uniform cakes of PX BTM NPs in water alone were rehydrated and spontaneously produced particle sizes that were, in fact, slightly smaller than the original particle sizes. In addition, there was complete retention of the in-vitro release properties and cytotoxicity profile.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn conclusion, the combination of Taguchi array and sequential simplex optimization efficiently guided the development and optimization of lipid-based nanoparticulate formulation for paclitaxel. Injectable paclitaxel nanoparticles, PX G78 NPs and PX BTM NPs, were successfully prepared via a warm o/w microemulsion precursor engineering method. Both paclitaxel nanoparticles were physically stable at 4° C. over five months, and PX BTM could be lyophilized without cryoprotectants. PX G78 and PX BTM nanoparticles showed comparable or the same anticancer activity compared to TAXOL in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Therefore, the presently disclosed paclitaxel-loaded nanoparticles can be used for ligand-mediated tumor-targeted delivery of paclitaxel, for example, after intravenous injection.\n\n\n \nExample 6\n\n\nPreparation of Nanocapsule Formulations without Heating\n\n\n \n \n \nA nanoemulsion or nanocapsule formulation also was made without heating. Briefly, 2.5 mg of MIGLYOL 812, 1.5 mg of TPGS and 3.5 mg of BRIJ 78 were mixed/dissolved in ethanol. The ethanol was evaporated and 1 mL water was added. The system was mixed overnight at room temperature. The system was slightly turbid the next day. Particle size was 192 nm with a polydispersity index of 0.134.\n\n\n \nExample 7\n\n\nPreparation of Long-Circulating Nanoemulsion Particles or Nanocapsules\n\n\n \n \n \nA one (1) mL suspension was prepared from warm o/w microemulsion precursors by adding 2.5 mg of MIGLYOL 812, 1.5 mg of TPGS and 3 mg of BRIJ 78 to a glass vial and heating to 65° C. 975 microliters of filtered and deionized (D.I.) water pre-heated at 65° C. was added into the mixture of melted oils and surfactants. After 15 min of mixing, 25 microliters of an 8 \nmg BRIJ\n 700/mL stock solution was added to the warm mixture and mixed for an additional 10 min. The mixture was then cooled to room temperature and stirred for 5 hr. \nBRIJ\n 700, also known as \nSteareth\n 100, has a PEG moiety (Mw of PEG about 4400) and is added to the formulation to form sterically stabilized nanoparticles to make the formulation long circulating in the blood.\n\n\n \nExample 8\n\n\nPreparation of Concentrated Paclitaxel Nanocapsule Formulations\n\n\n \n \n \nPaclitaxel nanocapsules were made more concentrated during the manufacturing process by increasing the mass of excipients in the formulation but keeping the volume of water constant at 1 mL.\n\n\n \n3× Concentrated Paclitaxel Nanocapsules\n\n\n \n \n \n450 μg paclitaxel, 7.5 mg of MIGLYOL 812, 4.5 mg of TPGS and 10.5 mg of BRIJ 78 were mixed at 65° C., and then 1 mL water was added. After 20 min mixing at 65° C., the system was cooled to room temperature. The concentration of paclitaxel in the nanocapsule suspension before and after filtration through a 0.2 micron filter was 518.1+/−3.3 μg/mL and 504.5+/−1 μg/mL, respectively.\n\n\n \n4× Concentrated Paclitaxel Nanocapsules\n\n\n \n \n \n600 μg paclitaxel, 10.0 mg of MIGLYOL 812, 6.0 mg of TPGS and 14.0 mg of BRIJ 78 were mixed at 65° C., and then 1 mL water was added. After 20 min mixing at 65° C., the system was cooled to room temperature. The concentration of paclitaxel in the nanocapsule suspension before and after filtration through a 0.2 micron filter was 671.3+/−1.6 μg/mL and 689.6+/−1.5 μg/mL, respectively.\n\n\n \n5× Concentrated Paclitaxel Nanocapsules\n\n\n \n \n \n750 μg paclitaxel, 12.5 mg of MIGLYOL 812, 7.5 mg of TPGS and 17.5 mg of BRIJ 78 were mixed at 65° C., and then 1 mL water was added. After 20 min mixing at 65° C., the system was cooled to room temperature. The concentration of paclitaxel in the nanocapsule suspension before and after filtration through a 0.2 micron filter was 794.6+/−1.8 μg/mL and 773.7+/−1.1 μg/mL, respectively.\n\n\n \nExample 9\n\n\nMethods of BTM Formulations to Overcome P-gp Mediated Resistance in Human Cancer Cells\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following data are the IC50 values in three different human cancer cells comparing paclitaxel (PX) BTM, Blank (placebo) BTM, and TAXOL.

All groups included three independent experiments (N = 3) with triplicates (n = 3) for each experiment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo test effects of blank BTM nanocapsules on P-gp, a Calcein AM assay was performed. Calcein AM is a substrate of P-gp and is non-fluorescent. Once entering cells, calcein AM is irreversibly converted by cytosolic esterases to calcein, a non-permeable and fluorescent molecule. Thus, the increased intracellular fluorescence of calcein when P-gp-overexpressing cells were exposed to lipid-based NPs indicates the inhibition of P-gp function. In NCI/ADR-RES (resistant) cells, blank BTM nanocapsules led to a linear increase in calcein fluorescence over 1 hr (\nFIG. 7\n). Moreover, the fluorescence caused by intracellular calcein significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner when cells were treated with various doses of blank BTM nanocapsules (equivalent concentrations of PX) (\nFIG. 8\n). In stark contrast, no treatments led to increased intracellular fluorescence compared to calcein AM alone in the sensitive MDA-MB468 cells (data not shown). Under all conditions tested, the trypan blue assay confirmed that there was no significant loss of cell membrane integrity in NCI/ADR-RES and MDA-MB-468 cells. BTM nanocapsules also were found to deplete ATP in P-pg resistant NCI cells in a dose dependent manner; however, they did not deplete ATP in non P-gp-overexpressing MDA-MB-468 cells (\nFIG. 9\n).\n\n\n \nExample 10\n\n\nCoating His-Tagged Proteins on BTM NPs\n\n\n \n \n \nBTM NPs having Nickel on the surface were prepared using 1,2-di-(9Z-octadecenoyl)-sn-glycero-3-[(N-(5-amino-1-carboxypentyl)imidodiacetic acid)succinyl] (nickel salt) (DGS-NTA-Ni). \nBRIJ\n 78, Vitamin E TPGS and MIGLYOL 812 were weighed in a 7-mL scintillation vial. DGS-NTA-Ni was added as a 10 mg/mL solution in chloroform. The weight (mg/mL NPs) of each component is provided in Table 7. The vial was transferred to a water bath at 70° C. Preheated water was added to the vial and stirred for 30 min. The vial was cooled to room temperature (RT). The NPs were passed through a sepharose CL-4B column to separate unincorporated components. NPs of size 187.8±0.32 nm and zeta potential of −11.3±7.1 were obtained. Ni content of the NPs was determined using ICP-MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry). The NPs had 145.6±19.53 ng Ni/mg NPs.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponents for Coating his-tagged proteins on BTM NPs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nComponents\n\n\nWeight (mg/mL NPs)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBRIJ 78\n\n\n3.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nVit E TPGS\n\n\n1.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMIGLYOL 812\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDGS-NTA-Ni\n\n\n 12.5 μL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBinding of his-GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein) to the NPs was evaluated by incubating his-GFP with the BTM Ni-NP suspension at 4° C. overnight. Unbound GFP was separated using a sepharose CL-4B column. 480 μg NPs could completely bind 1 μg GFP.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo use the BTM NPs as a vaccine delivery system, the binding of the HIV protein his-P41 to BTM Ni-NPs was performed. The particles size of the protein bound NPs was 177.6±0.53 nm. Balb/c mice were immunized on \n \nday\n \n 0 and 14 with 0.1 mL of BTM Ni-NPs coated with his-P41. The dose levels for his-P41 were 1 μg, 0.5 μg, or 0.1 μg and the corresponding dose of NPs was 480 μg, 240 μg, or 48 μg, respectively. On day 28, mice were bled by cardiac puncture and sera were collected and analyzed for total IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a by ELISA.\n\n\n \nExample 11\n\n\nIn Vivo Anticancer \nEfficacy Study #\n1\n\n\n \n \n \nIn vivo anticancer \nefficacy study #\n1 used pegylated PX BTM NPs in resistant mouse NCI/ADR-RES xenografts.

In comparison, a marked anticancer effect of the pegylated paclitaxel BTM nanoparticles was clearly observed (\nFIG. 11\n). The tumor volume in the two tested pegylated paclitaxel BTM nanoparticles groups exhibited almost no change during the course of the study. A statistically significant difference of pegylated paclitaxel BTM nanoparticles from all other treatments was observed from \nday\n 5 and continued to the end of the study. Blank BTM nanoparticles did not show any clinical signs of toxicity even at the highest dose of 210 mg nanoparticles/kg.\n\n\n \nExample 12\n\n\nIn Vivo Anticancer \nEfficacy Study #\n2\n\n\n \n \n \nIn-vivo anticancer \nefficacy study #\n2 used pegylated PX BTM NPs in resistant mouse NCI/ADR-RES xenografts.

The left panel of \nFIG. 13\n shows TAXOL-failed mice from \nefficacy study #\n2 that were combined and then treated with PX BTM NPs. Doses and dosing schedule of PX BTM NPs to the TAXOL-failed mice are shown in the legend of \nFIG. 13\n. As depicted in \nFIG. 13\n, the treatment of TAXOL-failed mice with PX BTM NPs significantly (p<0.05) reduced tumor sizes demonstrating efficacy in treating TAXOL-failed mice. In the right panel of \nFIG. 13\n, previously PX BTM NP-treated mice were retreated with PX BTM NPs at the doses and dosing schedule shown in the legend.

The BTM-DTPA-Gd NPs were injected into nude mice bearing A549 tumors. Five hours after injection, MRI images were obtained using a 9.4T Micro-MRI. The results showed that the BTM-DTPA-Gd NPs provided positive tumor contrast (\nFIG. 14\n, panel at right) were control (\nFIG. 14\n, panel on left).\n\n\n \nExample 15\n\n\nPreparation of Nanocapsules at Room Temperature\n\n\n \n \n \nNanocapsules were prepared by adding to a glass vial, 5 mg MIGLYOL 612 and 5 mg vitamin E TPGS. The excipients were dissolved with 100 mL of ethanol and mixed, and the ethanol was then evaporated with a stream of nitrogen gas. Two (2) mL of water was then added to the vial while stirring. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 20 minutes. The formed nanocapsules had a mean size of 224.4±2.34 nm and a P.I. of 0.010±0.023 with a unimodal distribution. SDP intensity analysis showed a mean size of 228.2±35.46 nm. MIGLYOL 612, or glyceryl trihexanoate, is a shorter chain molecule and can function as both an oil phase and surfactant in this formulation.

No. 7,329,737, which claims priority to U.S. Application No. 60/598,506, filed on Aug. 3, 2004, and U.S. Application No. 60/615,721, file Oct. 4, 2004, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nHuman tissue kallikreins include hK1, a protein encoded by the KLK1 gene and sometimes referred to as pancreatic/renal kallikrein, hPRK, or GenBank® M25629 or M33105. See generally Yousef et al. (2001) Endocrine Reviews 22:184-204.\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\nThis disclosure provides, inter alia, hK1 binding proteins. An “hK1 binding protein” refers to a protein that can interact with hK1 or a fragment thereof, particularly a protease-active fragment thereof. The hK1 binding proteins include antibodies that bind to hK1 with high affinity and antibody that can inhibit hK1 enzymatic activity. HK1 binding proteins can be administered to a subject, e.g., to treat disorders such as asthma (e.g., allergic and non-allergic asthma), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, rhinitis, sinusitus, inflammatory bowel diseases (such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), immune mediated diabetes, acute pancreatitis, interstitial cystitis, and a neoplastic disorder (e.g., metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinomas or tumor angiogenesis), or other hK1-associated disorders.\n\n\nIn one aspect, the disclosure features a protein that binds to hK1 and that includes a heavy chain immunoglobulin variable domain sequence and a light chain immunoglobulin variable domain sequence. The protein can bind to or sterically occlude the active site of hK1. In one embodiment, the protein contacts one or more of the hK1 \nactive site residues\n 65, 120, or 214, or a residue within five amino acids of such residues. In one embodiment, the protein inhibits hK1 enzymatic activity. For example, the protein can inhibit hK1 with an IC50 of less than 200, 80, 50, 40, 30, 20, 10, 5, 4, 3, 2.5 or 1 nM, e.g., an IC50 of between 1 and 20 nM, and other ranges therebetween. The protein may bind to hK1 with a Kd of less than 10\n−7 \nM, 10\n−8 \nM, 5·10\n−9 \nM, 10\n−9 \nM, 10\n−10 \nM, 10\n−11 \nM, or 10\n−12 \nM., e.g., a Kd of between 10\n−8 \nM and 10\n−11 \nM, and other ranges therebetween.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the protein prevents hK1 from interacting with a protein substrate larger than 12 amino acids, e.g., high molecular weight kininogen, low molecular weight kininogen, epidermal growth factor, pro-insulin, low density lipoprotein, prorenin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, procollagenase, and/or angiotensinogen. In another embodiment, the protein prevents hK1 from interacting with a peptide substrate smaller than 12 amino acids.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the protein is unable to bind an hK1 molecule that is inactivated by aprotinin or other protein protease inhibitors such as α1-antitrypsin or kallistatin.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the protein does not evoke an immunogenic response in humans.

The first and second nucleic acid sequences can be linked or unlinked, e.g., expressed on the same or different vector, respectively. The first and second nucleic acid sequences can be components of the same molecule or can reside on different molecules (e.g., different chromosomes or plasmids).\n\n\nThe host cell can be a eukaryotic cell, e.g., a mammalian cell, an insect cell, a yeast cell, or a prokaryotic cell, e.g., \nE. coli\n. For example, the mammalian cell can be a cultured cell or a cell line. Exemplary mammalian cells include lymphocytic cell lines (e.g., NSO), CHO, COS cells, oocyte cells, and cells from a transgenic animal, e.g., mammary epithelial cell. For example, nucleic acids encoding the antibodies described herein can be expressed in a transgenic animal. In one embodiment, the nucleic acids are placed under the control of a tissue-specific promoter (e.g., a mammary specific promoter) and the antibody is produced in the transgenic animal. For example, the antibody molecule is secreted into the milk of the transgenic animal, such as a transgenic cow, pig, horse, sheep, goat or rodent.\n\n\nThe disclosure also features a method of ameliorating an hK1-associated disorder. The method includes: administering a hK1 binding protein (e.g., as described herein) to a subject in an amount effective to ameliorate the disorder or at least one symptom thereof.

In one embodiment, the protein is administered by inhalation, e.g., using a metered dose inhaler. In another embodiment, the protein is administered by subcutaneous injection.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the disclosure features method of preventing or treating an angiogenesis-associated disorder. The method includes: administering a hK1 binding protein (e.g., as described herein) to a subject in an amount effective to reduce angiogenesis and/or ameliorate an angiogenesis-associated disorder, e.g., a neoplastic disorder. For example, the disorder is a neoplastic disorder characterized by malignant tumor growth. The protein can be administered by a variety of methods, e.g., by injection, e.g., subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or intravenously. In one embodiment, the protein is administered locally to a tumor.\n\n\nThe hK1 binding protein (the first agent) can be administered in combination with a second agent that is effective for treating a neoplastic disorder. For example, the second agent modulates activity of a VEGF class growth factor, e.g., the second agent modulates activity of a VEGF or a VEGF receptor. In one embodiment, the second agent is an antibody that binds to VEGF. Other examples of second agents are provided herein.\n\n\nAs used herein, “administered in combination” means that two or more agents are administered to a subject at the same time or within an interval, such that there is overlap of an effect of each agent on the patient. Preferably, the administrations of the first and second agent are spaced sufficiently close together such that a combinatorial effect is achieved. The interval can be an interval of minutes, hours, days or weeks. Generally, the agents are concurrently bioavailable, e.g., detectable, in the subject. The first and second agents can be administered in either order. In a preferred embodiment at least one administration of one of the agents, e.g., the first agent, is made within minutes, one, two, three, or four hours, or even within one or two days of the other agent, e.g., the second agent.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the first and second agents are administered at the same time. For example, the first and second agents are co-formulated.

The protein can be in the form of an IgG or a Fab. Typically, the protein is not immunogenic in the subject, e.g., the protein includes human or effectively human frameworks and constant domains, e.g., a modified human constant domain. In one embodiment, the protein inhibits hK1. The method can include other features described herein.\n\n\nDEFINITIONS\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “antibody” refers to a protein that includes at least one immunoglobulin variable domain or immunoglobulin variable domain sequence. For example, an antibody can include a heavy (H) chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VH), and a light (L) chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VL). In another example, an antibody includes two heavy (H) chain variable regions and two light (L) chain variable regions. The term “antibody” encompasses antigen-binding fragments of antibodies (e.g., single chain antibodies, Fab fragments, F(ab′)\n2\n, a Fd fragment, a Fv fragments, and dAb fragments) as well as complete antibodies.\n\n\nThe VH and VL regions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed “complementarity determining regions” (“CDR”), interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed “framework regions” (FR). The extent of the framework region and CDR's has been precisely defined (see, Kabat, E. A., et al. (1991) \nSequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition\n, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH Publication No. 91-3242, and Chothia, C. et al. (1987) J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917). Kabat definitions are used herein. Each VH and VL is typically composed of three CDR's and four FR's, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus in the following order: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4.\n\n\nAn “immunoglobulin domain” refers to a domain from the variable or constant domain of immunoglobulin molecules. Immunoglobulin domains typically contain two β-sheets formed of about seven β-strands, and a conserved disulphide bond (see, e.g., A. F. Williams and A. N. Barclay 1988 \nAnn. Rev Immunol. \n6:381-405). The canonical structures of hypervariable loops of an immunoglobulin variable can be inferred from its sequence, as described in Chothia et al. (1992) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n227:799-817; Tomlinson et al. (1992) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n227:776-798); and Tomlinson et al. (1995) EMBO J. 14(18):4628-38.\n\n\nAs used herein, an “immunoglobulin variable domain sequence” refers to an amino acid sequence which can form the structure of an immunoglobulin variable domain. For example, the sequence may include all or part of the amino acid sequence of a naturally-occurring variable domain. For example, the sequence may omit one, two or more N- or C-terminal amino acids, internal amino acids, may include one or more insertions or additional terminal amino acids, or may include other alterations. In one embodiment, a polypeptide that includes immunoglobulin variable domain sequence can associate with another immunoglobulin variable domain sequence to form a target binding structure (or “antigen binding site”), e.g., a structure that interacts with hK1, e.g., binds to or inhibits hK1.\n\n\nThe VH or VL chain of the antibody can further include all or part of a heavy or light chain constant region, to thereby form a heavy or light immunoglobulin chain, respectively. In one embodiment, the antibody is a tetramer of two heavy immunoglobulin chains and two light immunoglobulin chains, wherein the heavy and light immunoglobulin chains are inter-connected by, e.g., disulfide bonds. The heavy chain constant region includes three domains, CH1, CH2 and CH3. The light chain constant region includes a CL domain. The variable region of the heavy and light chains contains a binding domain that interacts with an antigen. The constant regions of the antibodies typically mediate the binding of the antibody to host tissues or factors, including various cells of the immune system (e.g., effector cells) and the first component (C1q) of the classical complement system. The term “antibody” includes intact immunoglobulins of types IgA, IgG, IgE, IgD, IgM (as well as subtypes thereof). The light chains of the immunoglobulin may be of types kappa or lambda. In one embodiment, the antibody is glycosylated. An antibody can be functional for antibody-dependent cytotoxicity and/or complement-mediated cytotoxicity.\n\n\nOne or more regions of an antibody can be human or effectively human. For example, one or more of the variable regions can be human or effectively human. For example, one or more of the CDRs can be human, e.g., HC CDR1, HC CDR2, HC CDR3, LC CDR1, LC CDR2, and LC CDR3. Each of the light chain CDRs can be human. HC CDR3 can be human. One or more of the framework regions can be human, e.g., FR1, FR2, FR3, and FR4 of the HC or LC. In one embodiment, all the framework regions are human, e.g., derived from a human somatic cell, e.g., a hematopoietic cell that produces immunoglobulins or a non-hematopoietic cell. In one embodiment, the human sequences are germline sequences, e.g., encoded by a germline nucleic acid. One or more of the constant regions can be human or effectively human. In another embodiment, at least 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 92, 95, or 98% of the framework regions (e.g., FR1, FR2, and FR3, collectively, or FR1, FR2, FR3, and FR4, collectively) or the entire antibody can be human or effectively human. For example, FR1, FR2, and FR3 collectively can be at least 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 92, 95, 98, or 99% identical to a human sequence encoded by a human germline VH segment.\n\n\nAll or part of an antibody can be encoded by an immunoglobulin gene or a segment thereof. Exemplary human immunoglobulin genes include the kappa, lambda, alpha (IgA1 and IgA2), gamma (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4), delta, epsilon and mu constant region genes, as well as the myriad immunoglobulin variable region genes. Full-length immunoglobulin “light chains” (about 25 Kd or 214 amino acids) are encoded by a variable region gene at the NH2-terminus (about 110 amino acids) and a kappa or lambda constant region gene at the COOH-terminus. Full-length immunoglobulin “heavy chains” (about 50 Kd or 446 amino acids), are similarly encoded by a variable region gene (about 116 amino acids) and one of the other aforementioned constant region genes, e.g., gamma (encoding about 330 amino acids).\n\n\nThe term “antigen-binding fragment” of a full length antibody (or simply “antibody portion,” or “fragment”), as used herein, refers to one or more fragments of a full-length antibody that retain the ability to specifically bind to a target of interest. Examples of binding fragments encompassed within the term “antigen-binding fragment” of a full length antibody include (i) a Fab fragment, a monovalent fragment consisting of the VL, VH, CL and CH1 domains; (ii) a F(ab′)\n2 \nfragment, a bivalent fragment including two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; (iii) a Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CH1 domains; (iv) a Fv fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody, (v) a dAb fragment (Ward et al., (1989) \nNature \n341:544-546), which consists of a VH domain; and (vi) an isolated complementarity determining region (CDR) that retains functionality. Furthermore, although the two domains of the Fv fragment, VL and VH, are coded for by separate genes, they can be joined, using recombinant methods, by a synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a single protein chain in which the VL and VH regions pair to form monovalent molecules known as single chain Fv (scFv). See e.g., Bird et al. (1988) \nScience \n242:423-426; and Huston et al. (1988) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n85:5879-5883.\n\n\nAntibody fragments can be obtained using any appropriate technique including conventional techniques known to those with skill in the art. The term “monospecific antibody” refers to an antibody that displays a single binding specificity and affinity for a particular target, e.g., epitope. This term includes a “monoclonal antibody” or “monoclonal antibody composition,” which as used herein refer to a preparation of antibodies or fragments thereof of single molecular composition. As used herein, “isotype” refers to the antibody class (e.g., IgM or IgG1) that is encoded by heavy chain constant region genes.\n\n\nAn “effectively human” immunoglobulin variable region is an immunoglobulin variable region that includes a sufficient number of human framework amino acid positions such that the immunoglobulin variable region does not elicit an immunogenic response in a normal human. An “effectively human” antibody is an antibody that includes a sufficient number of human amino acid positions such that the antibody does not elicit an immunogenic response in a normal human.\n\n\nA “humanized” immunoglobulin variable region is an immunoglobulin variable region that is modified to include a sufficient number of human framework amino acid positions such that the immunoglobulin variable region does not elicit an immunogenic response in a normal human. Descriptions of “humanized” immunoglobulins include, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,407,213 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,693,762.\n\n\nAs used herein, “binding affinity” refers to the apparent association constant or K\na\n. The K\na \nis the reciprocal of the dissociation constant (K\nd\n). A binding protein may, for example, have a Kd of less than 10\n−5\n, 10\n−6\n, 10\n−7 \nor 10\n−8 \nM for a particular target molecule. Higher affinity binding of a binding ligand to a first target relative to a second target can be indicated by a higher K\na \n(or a smaller numerical value K\nd\n) for binding the first target than the K\na \n(or numerical value K\nd\n) for binding the second target. In such cases the binding protein has specificity for the first target (e.g., hK1) relative to the second target (e.g., a protein other than hK1, e.g., serum albumin, laminin, or a globin). Differences in binding affinity (e.g., for specificity or other comparisons) can be at least 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 50, 70, 80, 100, 500, 1000, or 10\n5 \nfold.\n\n\nBinding affinity can be determined by a variety of methods including equilibrium dialysis, equilibrium binding, gel filtration, ELISA, surface plasmon resonance, or spectroscopy (e.g., using a fluorescence assay). Exemplary conditions for evaluating binding affinity are in PBS (phosphate buffered saline) at pH 7.2 at 30° C. These techniques can be used to measure the concentration of bound and free binding protein as a function of binding protein (or target) concentration. The concentration of bound binding protein ([Bound]) is related to the concentration of free binding protein ([Free]) and the concentration of binding sites for the binding protein on the target where (N) is the number of binding sites per target molecule by the following equation:\n\n\n[Bound]=\nN\n·[Free]/((1\n/Ka\n)+[Free]).\n\n\n\nIt is not always necessary to make an exact determination of Ka, though, since sometimes it is sufficient to obtain a quantitative measurement of affinity, e.g., determined using a method such as ELISA or FACS analysis, is proportional to Ka, and thus can be used for comparisons, such as determining whether a higher affinity is, e.g., 2-fold higher, to obtain a qualitative measurement of affinity, or to obtain an inference of affinity, e.g., by activity in a functional assay, e.g., an in vitro or in vivo assay.\n\n\nAn “isolated composition” refers to a composition that is removed from at least 90% of at least one component of a natural sample from which the isolated composition can be obtained. Compositions produced artificially or naturally can be “compositions of at least” a certain degree of purity if the species or population of species of interests is at least 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 80, 90, 92, 95, 98, or 99% pure on a weight-weight basis.\n\n\nAn “epitope” refers to the site on a target compound that is bound by a binding protein (e.g., an antibody such as a Fab or full length antibody). In the case where the target compound is a protein, the site can be entirely composed of amino acid components, entirely composed of chemical modifications of amino acids of the protein (e.g., glycosyl moieties), or composed of combinations thereof. Overlapping epitopes include at least one common amino acid residue.\n\n\nCalculations of “homology” or “sequence identity” between two sequences (the terms are used interchangeably herein) are performed as follows. The sequences are aligned for optimal comparison purposes (e.g., gaps can be introduced in one or both of a first and a second amino acid or nucleic acid sequence for optimal alignment and non-homologous sequences can be disregarded for comparison purposes). The optimal alignment is determined as the best score using the GAP program in the GCG software package with a Blossum 62 scoring matrix with a gap penalty of 12, a gap extend penalty of 4, and a frameshift gap penalty of 5. The amino acid residues or nucleotides at corresponding amino acid positions or nucleotide positions are then compared. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same amino acid residue or nucleotide as the corresponding position in the second sequence, then the molecules are identical at that position (as used herein amino acid or nucleic acid “identity” is equivalent to amino acid or nucleic acid “homology”). The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences.\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the length of a reference sequence aligned for comparison purposes is at least 30%, preferably at least 40%, more preferably at least 50%, even more preferably at least 60%, and even more preferably at least 70%, 80%, 90%, 92%, 95%, 97%, 98%, or 100% of the length of the reference sequence. For example, the reference sequence may be the length of the immunoglobulin variable domain sequence.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “substantially identical” (or “substantially homologous”) is used herein to refer to a first amino acid or nucleic acid sequence that contains a sufficient number of identical or equivalent (e.g., with a similar side chain, e.g., conserved amino acid substitutions) amino acid residues or nucleotides to a second amino acid or nucleic acid sequence such that the first and second amino acid or nucleic acid sequences have (or encode proteins having) similar activities, e.g., a binding activity, a binding preference, or a biological activity. In the case of antibodies, the second antibody has the same specificity and has at least 50% of the affinity relative to the same antigen.\n\n\nSequences similar or homologous (e.g., at least about 85% sequence identity) to the sequences disclosed herein are also part of this application. In some embodiment, the sequence identity can be about 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or higher. In addition, substantial identity exists when the nucleic acid segments hybridize under selective hybridization conditions (e.g., highly stringent hybridization conditions), to the complement of the strand. The nucleic acids may be present in whole cells, in a cell lysate, or in a partially purified or substantially pure form.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “hybridizes under low stringency, medium stringency, high stringency, or very high stringency conditions” describes conditions for hybridization and washing. Guidance for performing hybridization reactions can be found in \nCurrent Protocols in Molecular Biology\n, John Wiley & Sons, N.Y. (1989), 6.3.1-6.3.6, which is incorporated by reference. Aqueous and nonaqueous methods are described in that reference and either can be used. Specific hybridization conditions referred to herein are as follows: (1) low stringency hybridization conditions in 6× sodium chloride/sodium citrate (SSC) at about 45° C., followed by two washes in 0.2×SSC, 0.1% SDS at least at 50° C. (the temperature of the washes can be increased to 55° C. for low stringency conditions); (2) medium stringency hybridization conditions in 6×SSC at about 45° C., followed by one or more washes in 0.2×SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60° C.; (3) high stringency hybridization conditions in 6×SSC at about 45° C., followed by one or more washes in 0.2×SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65° C.; and (4) very high stringency hybridization conditions are 0.5M sodium phosphate, 7% SDS at 65° C., followed by one or more washes at 0.2×SSC, 1% SDS at 65° C. Very high stringency conditions (4) are the preferred conditions and the ones that should be used unless otherwise specified. The invention includes nucleic acids that hybridize with low, medium, high, or very high stringency to a nucleic acid described herein or to a complement thereof, e.g., nucleic acids encoding a binding protein described herein. The nucleic acids can be the same length or within 30, 20, or 10% of the length of the reference nucleic acid. The nucleic acid can correspond to a region encoding an immunoglobulin variable domain sequence.\n\n\nAn hK1 binding protein may have mutations relative to a binding protein described herein (e.g., a conservative or non-essential amino acid substitutions), which do not have a substantial effect on the protein functions. Whether or not a particular substitution will be tolerated, e.g., will not adversely affect biological properties, such as binding activity can be predicted, e.g., using the method of Bowie, et al. (1990) \nScience \n247:1306-1310.\n\n\nA “conservative amino acid substitution” is one in which the amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a similar side chain. Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined in the art. These families include amino acids with basic side chains (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.g., glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine), nonpolar side chains (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine, tryptophan), beta-branched side chains (e.g., threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine). It is possible for many framework and CDR amino acid residues to include one or more conservative substitutions.\n\n\nConsensus sequences for biopolymers can include positions which can be varied among various amino acids. For example, the symbol “X” in such a context generally refers to any amino acid (e.g., any of the twenty natural amino acids or any of the nineteen non-cysteine amino acids). Other allowed amino acids can also be indicated for example, using parentheses and slashes. For example, “(A/W/F/N/Q)” means that alanine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, asparagine, and glutamine are allowed at that particular position.\n\n\nA “non-essential” amino acid residue is a residue that can be altered from the wild-type sequence of the binding agent, e.g., the antibody, without abolishing or more preferably, without substantially altering a biological activity, whereas an “essential” amino acid residue results in such a change.\n\n\nThe terms “polypeptide” or “peptide” (which may be used interchangeably) refer to a polymer of three or more amino acids linked by a peptide bond, e.g., between 3 and 60, or 30 and 300, or over 300 amino acids in length. The polypeptide may include one or more unnatural amino acids. Typically, the polypeptide includes only natural amino acids. A “protein” can include one or more polypeptide chains. Accordingly, the term “protein” encompasses polypeptides. A protein or polypeptide can also include one or more modifications, e.g., a glycosylation, amidation, phosphorylation, and so forth.\n\n\nThe term “cognate substrate” refers to a naturally occurring substrate of hK1, including naturally occurring variants thereof (e.g., splice variants, naturally occurring mutants, and isoforms).\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “common codon” refers to the most common codon representing a particular amino acid in sequences of the species of cell that is used to express the protein. “Less-common codons” are codons that occurs frequently in the particular species but are not the common codon. All codons other than common codons and less-common codons are “non-common codons”.\n\n\nAn “hK1-associated inflammatory disorder” refers to a disorder characterized by an inflammatory response mediated at least in part by hK1, e.g., the protease activity of hK1. For such disorders, a reduction in hK1 activity results in a reduced inflammatory response. Exemplary hK1-associated inflammatory disorders include asthma (e.g., allergic and non-allergic asthma), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteopathic arthritis, osteoarthritis, rhinitis, sinusitus, inflammatory bowel diseases (such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), immune mediated diabetes, acute pancreatitis, and interstitial cystitis.\n\n\nStatistical significance can be determined by any art known method. Exemplary statistical tests include: the Students T-test, Mann Whitney U non-parametric test, and Wilcoxon non-parametric statistical test. Some statistically significant relationships have a P value of less than 0.05 or 0.02. Particular binding proteins may show a difference, e.g., in specificity, binding, or biological activity, that are statistically significant (e.g., P value <0.05 or 0.02). The terms “induce”, “inhibit”, “potentiate”, “elevate”, “increase”, “decrease” or the like, e.g., which denote distinguishable qualitative or quantitative differences between two states, and may refer to a difference, e.g., a statistically significant difference, between the two states.\n\n\nUnless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. Although methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the invention, suitable methods and materials are described below. All publications, patent applications, patents, and other references mentioned herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety.\n\n\n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n\n \nFIG. 1\n. Epitope grouping by SPR. Biotinylated hK1 was captured on a streptavidin coated chip to a final ligand density of 88 RU. DX-2300 was injected over immobilized hK1 at a concentration of 50 nM followed by an injection of a second Fab at a concentration of 50 nM at a flow rate of 30 μL/min at 25° C. in PBST using a Biacore 3000 instrument. The signal at the end of the injection of DX-2300 followed by a second Fab is R1. The signal at the end of the injection of the Fab alone is R2. Panel A shows the sensorgram for a Fab (M0112-D07) that binds the same epitope as DX-2300. Panel B shows the sensorgram for a Fab (M0139-A09) that bind a different epitope as DX-2300.\n\n\n \nFIG. 2\n. Inhibition mechanism of DX-2300 (also referred to herein as “M0131-F07”). The inhibition mechanism of DX-2300 as a Fab (panel A) is shown to be competitive and to have a K\ni \nof 60±2 pM. The inhibition mechanism of DX-2300 as an IgG (panel B) is shown to be competitive and to have a K\ni \nof 39±4 pM.\n\n\n \nFIG. 3\n. Inhibition mechanisms of other hK1 inhibitors. The inhibition mechanism of M0093-F09 as a Fab (panel A) is shown to be noncompetitive and to have a K\ni \nof 1.9 nM. The inhibition mechanism of M0137-E01 as a Fab (panel B) is shown to be competitive and to have a K\ni \nof 0.9 nM.\n\n\n \nFIG. 4\n. Progress Curve Analysis of DX-2300. Kinetic progress curves (panel A) in the presence of increasing amounts of DX-2300 inhibitor were fit to the following equation to obtain kobs values, F=v\ns\n+(v\n0\n−v\ns\n)(1−exp(−k\nobs\n*t))/k\nobs\n+C, where F=fluorescence, v\ns\n=final steady state rate, v\n0\n=initial steady state rate, k\nobs\n=exponential inhibition constant, t=time in seconds, and C is a constant to account for the initial background fluorescence at t=0 seconds. In panel B the k\nobs \nvalues were plotted against inhibitor concentrations and fit to an equation for a slow, tight binder with an isomerization step: k\nobs\n=k\n6\n+(k\n5\n*[I]/(K\ni,app\n+[I])), where k\n6 \nis the reverse reaction rate constant for the enzyme-inhibitor isomerization step, k\n5 \nis the forward reaction rate constant for that step, K\ni,app \nis the apparent equilibrium inhibition constant for the formation of the initial enzyme-inhibitor complex, and [I] is the concentration of inhibitor present in the assay.\n\n\n \nFIG. 5\n. DX-2300 inhibition of kallikrein-like activity in animal urine. Kallikein-like activity in animal was measured as described above. The percent inhibition is ratio of the initial rate observed in the presence of DX-2300 (R\nihibited\n) to that observed in its absence (R\no\n) such that Percent Inhibition=100−(R\no\n−R\ninhibited\n)/R\no\n*100.\n\n\n \nFIG. 6\n. Determination of DX-2300 IC\n50 \nof kallikrein-like activity in human and sheep urine. Measurements of kallikrein activity in activated urine were performed as described above in the presence or absence of a varied concentration of DX-2300. The measured DX-2300 IC\n50 \nvalues for kallikrein-like activity in sheep urine and human urine are comparable at 2.9±1.6 nM and 3.0±0.6 nM, respectively.\n\n\n \nFIG. 7\n. Inhibition of kallikrein-like activity in human BAL from mild asthmatic patients following a rhinovirus infection. Kallikrein activity in BAL was measured in 80 μL BAL using 100 μM Pro-Phe-Arg-AMC substrate in KAL buffer (Table 4) in the presence or absence of 0.5 μM DX-2300. Prior to the addition of substrate the BAL was incubated with DX-2300 for 30 minutes at 30° C.\n\n\n \nFIG. 8\n. Effect of DX-2300 on antigen-induced airway responses in the sheep. Sheep (n=2) were administered 10 mg of DX-2300 by \ninhalation\n 12 hours and 30 minutes prior to challenge with the \nAscaris suum \nallergen. Panel A compares DX-2300 treated animals (squares) to control animals (diamonds) by measuring pulmonary resistance over 8 hours following allergen challenge. Panel B compares the airway hyper-responsiveness to carbachol administered 24 hours post challenge observed in DX-2300 treated animals to control animals. The open bars indicate the amount of carbachol required to induce \nbronchoconstriction\n 400% above baseline prior to allergen challenge. The filled bars indicate the amount of carbachol required to induce \nbronchoconstriction\n 400% above baseline 24 hours after allergen challenge.\n\n\n \nFIG. 9\n. Effect of DX-2300 on high molecular weight kininogen induced bronchoconstriction in the sheep model of asthma. The diamond symbols show bronchoconstriction in response to inhaled HMWK (100 μg) in the absence of drug. The square symbols show bronchoconstriction in response to inhaled HMWK (100 μg) in the presence of 1 mg DX-2300 inhaled. The triangles show bronchoconstriction in response to inhaled HMWK (100 μg) in the presence of 5 mg DX-2300.\n\n\n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION\n\n\nhK1\n\n\nAn exemplary hK1 protein includes the following sequence:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>sp|P06870|\nKLK1_HUMAN Kallikrein\n 1 precursor\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(EC 3.4.21.35) (Tissue kallikrein) (Kidney/\n\n\n\n\n\n\npancreas/salivary gland kallikrein) - \nHomo sapiens\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Human).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO:1021)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMWFLVLCLALSLGGTGAAPPIQSRIVGGWECEQHSQPWQAALYHFSTFQC\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGGILVHRQWVLTAAHCISDNYQLWLGRHNLFDDENTAQFVHVSESFPHPG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFNMSLLENHTRQADEDYSHDLMLLRLTEPADTITDAVKVVELPTQEPEVG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTCLASGWGSIEPENFSFPDDLQCVDLKILPNDECEKAHVQKVTDFMLCV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGHLEGGKDTCVGDSGGPLMCDGVLQGVTSWGYVPCGTPNKPSVAVRVLSY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVKWIEDTIAENS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypically the protein is a mature processed protein, e.g., a protein that includes about \namino acids\n 25 to 262, or a fragment thereof, e.g., a proteolytically active fragment thereof.\n\n\nAn hK1 protein can include one or more of the following features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSIGNAL\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n18\n\n\n18\n\n\nProbable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPROPEP\n\n\n19\n\n\n24\n\n\n6\n\n\nActivation peptide (Probable).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCHAIN\n \n\n\n25\n\n\n262\n\n\n238\n\n\n \nKallikrein\n 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACT_SITE\n\n\n65\n\n\n65\n\n\n \n\n\nCharge relay system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nACT_SITE\n \n\n\n120\n\n\n120\n\n\n \n\n\nCharge relay system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACT_SITE\n\n\n214\n\n\n214\n\n\n \n\n\nCharge relay system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCARBOHYD\n\n\n93\n\n\n93\n\n\n \n\n\nO-linked.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCARBOHYD\n\n\n102\n\n\n102\n\n\n \n\n\nN-linked (GlcNAc . . . ).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCARBOHYD\n\n\n104\n\n\n104\n\n\n \n\n\nO-linked.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCARBOHYD\n\n\n108\n\n\n108\n\n\n \n\n\nN-linked (GlcNAc . . . ).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCARBOHYD\n\n\n165\n\n\n165\n\n\n \n\n\nN-linked (GlcNAc . . . ); partial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCARBOHYD\n\n\n167\n\n\n167\n\n\n \n\n\nO-linked.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDISULFID\n\n\n31\n\n\n174\n\n\n \n\n\nBy similarity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDISULFID\n \n\n\n50\n\n\n66\n\n\n \n\n\nBy similarity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDISULFID\n\n\n153\n\n\n220\n\n\n \n\n\nBy similarity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDISULFID\n\n\n185\n\n\n199\n\n\n \n\n\nBy similarity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDISULFID\n\n\n210\n\n\n235\n\n\n \n\n\nBy similarity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn hK1 protein can also include the following exemplary variants:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVARIANT\n\n\n77\n\n\nR -> H (in dbSNP: 5515)\n\n\nVAR_014567\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n[NCBI/Ensembl].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVARIANT\n\n\n145\n\n\nQ -> E (in dbSNP: 5516)\n\n\nVAR_006625\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n[NCBI/Ensembl].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVARIANT\n\n\n186\n\n\nE -> K (in dbSNP: 5517)\n\n\nVAR_006626\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n[NCBI/Ensembl].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVARIANT\n\n\n193\n\n\nV -> E (in dbSNP: 5518)\n\n\nVAR_014568\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n[NCBI/Ensembl].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExemplary substrates for hK1 include pro-insulin, low density lipoprotein, the precursor of atrial natriuretic factor, prorenin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, procollagenase, and angiotensinogen. A hK1 binding protein described herein can be used to modulate such substrates, e.g., to reduce proteolytic cleavage of such substrates.\n\n\nAntibodies that bind to hK1 can be obtained by using hK1 as an antigen, e.g., for immunizing an animal, or as a target, e.g., for screening a library of recombinant antibodies. Peptides and fragments of hK1 can also be used.\n\n\nDisplay Libraries\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a display library is used to identify proteins that bind to hK1. A display library is a collection of entities; each entity includes an accessible protein component (e.g., a Fab or scFv) and a recoverable component (e.g., a nucleic acid) that encodes or identifies the protein component. The protein component can be of any length, e.g. from three amino acids to over 300 amino acids. In a selection, the protein component of each member of the library is contacted to hK1 and if the protein component binds to hK1, the display library member is identified, e.g., by retention on a support. The protein component can include one or more immunoglobulin variable domains or variants of another domain. Methods using immunoglobulin domains for display are described below (see, e.g., “Antibody Display Libraries”).\n\n\nRetained display library members are recovered from the support and analyzed. The analysis can include amplification and a subsequent selection under similar or dissimilar conditions. For example, positive and negative selections can be alternated. The analysis can also include determining the amino acid sequence of the protein component and purification of the protein component for detailed characterization.\n\n\nA variety of formats can be used for display libraries. Examples include the following.\n\n\nPhage Display. One format utilizes viruses, particularly bacteriophages. This format is termed “phage display.” The protein component is typically covalently linked to a bacteriophage coat protein. The linkage results form translation of a nucleic acid encoding the protein component fused to the coat protein. The linkage can include a flexible peptide linker, a protease site, or an amino acid incorporated as a result of suppression of a stop codon. Phage display is described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,223,409; Smith (1985) \nScience \n228:1315-1317; WO 92/18619; WO 91/17271; WO 92/20791; WO 92/15679; WO 93/01288; WO 92/01047; WO 92/09690; WO 90/02809; de Haard et al. (1999) \nJ. Biol.

(1992) \nHum Antibod Hybridomas \n3:81-85; Huse et al. (1989) \nScience \n246:1275-1281; Griffiths et al. (1993) \nEMBO J \n12:725-734; Hawkins et al. (1992) \nJ Mol Biol \n226:889-896; Clackson et al. (1991) \nNature \n352:624-628; Gram et al. (1992) \nPNAS \n89:3576-3580; Garrard et al. (1991) \nBio/Technology \n9:1373-1377; Rebar et al. (1996) \nMethods Enzymol. \n267:129-49; Hoogenboom et al. (1991) \nNuc Acid Res \n19:4133-4137; and Barbas et al. (1991) \nPNAS \n88:7978-7982.\n\n\nPhage display systems have been developed for filamentous phage (phage f1, fd, and M13) as well as other bacteriophage (e.g. T7 bacteriophage and lambdoid phages; see, e.g., Santini (1998) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n282:125-135; Rosenberg et al. (1996) \nInnovations \n6:1-6; Houshm et al. (1999) \nAnal Biochem \n268:363-370). The filamentous phage display systems typically use fusions to a minor coat protein, such as gene III protein, and gene VIII protein, a major coat protein, but fusions to other coat proteins such as gene VI protein, gene VII protein, gene IX protein, or domains thereof can also been used (see, e.g., WO 00/71694). In one embodiment, the fusion is to a domain of the gene III protein, e.g., the anchor domain or “stump,” (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,658,727 for a description of the gene III protein anchor domain). It is also possible to physically associate the protein being displayed to the coat using a non-peptide linkage, e.g., a non-covalent bond or a non-peptide covalent bond. For example, a disulfide bond and/or c-fos and c-jun coiled-coils can be used for physical associations (see, e.g., Crameri et al. (1993) \nGene \n137:69 and WO 01/05950).\n\n\nBacteriophage displaying the protein component can be grown and harvested using standard phage preparatory methods, e.g. PEG precipitation from growth media. After selection of individual display phages, the nucleic acid encoding the selected protein components can be isolated from cells infected with the selected phages or from the phage themselves, after amplification. Individual colonies or plaques can be picked, the nucleic acid isolated and sequenced.\n\n\nOther Display Formats. Other display formats include cell based display (see, e.g., WO 03/029456), protein-nucleic acid fusions (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,207,446), and ribosome display (See, e.g., Mattheakis et al. (1994) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n91:9022 and Hanes et al. (2000) \nNat Biotechnol. \n18:1287-92; Hanes et al. (2000) \nMethods Enzymol. \n328:404-30; and Schaffitzel et al. (1999) \nJ Immunol Methods. \n231(1-2):119-35).\n\n\nEpitope Specific Binding proteins. Display technology can also be used to obtain binding proteins, e.g., antibodies, that bind to particular epitopes of a target. Epitopes can be classified as “conformational” or “sequential”. Conformational epitopes involve amino-acid residues that have a defined relative orientation in a properly folded target even though the amino acids may be substantially separated in the sequence (e.g., separated by at least one, two, four, six, eight or ten amino acids). Sequential epitopes involve short portions of the polypeptide chain that bind an antibody whatever the folding state of the protein (e.g., native or unfolded). Binding proteins for conformational epitopes can be identified, for example, by using competing non-target molecules that lack the particular epitope or are mutated within the epitope, e.g., with alanine. Such non-target molecules can be used in a negative selection procedure as described below, as competing molecules when binding a display library to the target, or as a pre-elution agent, e.g., to capture in a wash solution dissociating display library members that are not specific to the target. In another implementation, epitope specific binding proteins are identified by eluting display library members with a competing binding protein that binds to the epitope of interest on the target molecule. Binding proteins that bind sequential epitopes can be selected, for example, using short peptides that have amino-acid sequences found in a target protein. Often binding proteins that bind to conformational epitopes also bind weakly to one or another peptide that contains some of the amino acids involved in the conformational epitope. Thus, one can select for binding to a peptide at very low stringency and then select for binding to the folded target protein.\n\n\nAffinity Maturation. In one embodiment, a binding protein that binds to a target is modified, e.g., by mutagenesis, to provide a pool of modified binding proteins. The modified binding proteins are then evaluated to identify one or more altered binding proteins which have altered functional properties (e.g., improved binding, improved stability, lengthened stability in vivo). In one implementation, display library technology is used to select or screen the pool of modified binding proteins. Higher affinity binding proteins are then identified from the second library, e.g., by using higher stringency or more competitive binding and washing conditions. Other screening techniques can also be used.\n\n\nIn some implementations, the mutagenesis is targeted to regions known or likely to be at the binding interface. If, for example, the identified binding proteins are antibodies, then mutagenesis can be directed to the CDR regions of the heavy or light chains as described herein. Further, mutagenesis can be directed to framework regions near or adjacent to the CDRs, e.g., framework regions, particular within ten, five, or three amino acids of a CDR junction. In the case of antibodies, mutagenesis can also be limited to one or a few of the CDRs, e.g., to make step-wise improvements.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, mutagenesis is used to make an antibody more similar to one or more germline sequences. One exemplary germlining method can include: identifying one or more germline sequences that are similar (e.g., most similar in a particular database) to the sequence of the isolated antibody. Then mutations (at the amino acid level) can be made in the isolated antibody, either incrementally, in combination, or both. For example, a nucleic acid library that includes sequences encoding some or all possible germline mutations is made. The mutated antibodies are then evaluated, e.g., to identify an antibody that has one or more additional germline residues relative to the isolated antibody and that is still useful (e.g., has a functional activity). In one embodiment, as many germline residues are introduced into an isolated antibody as possible.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, mutagenesis is used to substitute or insert one or more germline residues into a CDR region. For example, the germline CDR residue can be from a germline sequence that is similar (e.g., most similar) to the variable region being modified. After mutagenesis, activity (e.g., binding or other functional activity) of the antibody can be evaluated to determine if the germline residue or residues are tolerated. Similar mutagenesis can be performed in the framework regions.\n\n\nSelecting a germline sequence can be performed in different ways. For example, a germline sequence can be selected if it meets a predetermined criteria for selectivity or similarity, e.g., at least a certain percentage identity, e.g., at least 75, 80, 85, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, or 99.5% identity. The selection can be performed using at least 2, 3, 5, or 10 germline sequences. In the case of CDR1 and CDR2, identifying a similar germline sequence can include selecting one such sequence. In the case of CDR3, identifying a similar germline sequence can include selecting one such sequence, but may including using two germline sequences that separately contribute to the amino-terminal portion and the carboxy-terminal portion. In other implementations more than one or two germline sequences are used, e.g., to form a consensus sequence.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, with respect to a particular reference variable domain sequence, e.g., a sequence described herein, a related variable domain sequence has at least 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 95 or 100% of the CDR amino acid positions that are not identical to residues in the reference CDR sequences, residues that are identical to residues at corresponding positions in a human germline sequence (i.e., an amino acid sequence encoded by a human germline nucleic acid).\n\n\nIn one embodiment, with respect to a particular reference variable domain sequence, e.g., a sequence described herein, a related variable domain sequence has at least 30, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 or 100% of the FR regions are identical to FR sequence from a human germline sequence, e.g., a germline sequence related to the reference variable domain sequence.\n\n\nAccordingly, it is possible to isolate an antibody which has similar activity to a given antibody of interest, but is more similar to one or more germline sequences, particularly one or more human germline sequences. For example, an antibody can be at least 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 99.5% identical to a germline sequence in a region outside the CDRs (e.g., framework regions). Further an antibody can include at least 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 germline residues in a CDR region, the germline residue being from a germline sequence of similar (e.g., most similar) to the variable region being modified. Germline sequences of primary interest are human germline sequences. The activity of the antibody (e.g., the binding activity) can be within a factor or 100, 10, 5, 2, 0.5, 0.1, and 0.001 of the original antibody. An exemplary germline sequences include VKI-O2, VL2-1, VKIII-L2::JK2, vg3-23, V3-23::JH4, and V3-23::JK6.\n\n\nSome exemplary mutagenesis techniques include: error-prone PCR (Leung et al. (1989) \nTechnique \n1:11-15), recombination (see, e.g., U.S. Ser. No. 10/279,633), DNA shuffling using random cleavage (Stemmer (1994) \nNature \n389-391; termed “nucleic acid shuffling”), RACHITT™ (Coco et al. (2001) \nNature Biotech. \n19:354), site-directed mutagenesis (Zoller et al. (1987) \nNucl Acids Res \n10:6487-6504), cassette mutagenesis (Reidhaar-Olson (1991) \nMethods Enzymol. \n208:564-586) and incorporation of degenerate oligonucleotides (Griffiths et al. (1994) \nEMBO J \n13:3245).\n\n\nIn one example of affinity maturation the methods described herein are used to first identify a binding protein from a display library that binds an hK1 with at least a minimal binding specificity for a target or a minimal activity, e.g., an equilibrium dissociation constant for binding of less than 1 nM, 10 nM, or 100 nM. The nucleic acid sequence encoding the initial identified binding protein are used as a template nucleic acid for the introduction of variations, e.g., to identify a second binding protein that has enhanced properties (e.g., binding affinity, kinetics, or stability) relative to the initial binding protein. Alternatively, the amino-acid sequence of one or more CDRs can be used as a guide for design of a nucleic acid library that includes nucleic acids encoding the isolated sequence and many neighboring sequences. Such diversified nucleic acids can be introduced into a display vector containing the initial isolate and improved variants are selected from the library.\n\n\nOff-Rate Selection. Since a slow dissociation rate can be predictive of high affinity, particularly with respect to interactions between polypeptides and their targets, the methods described herein can be used to isolate binding proteins with a desired kinetic dissociation rate (i.e. reduced) for a binding interaction to a target.\n\n\nTo select for slow dissociating binding proteins from a display library, the library is contacted to an immobilized target. The immobilized target is then washed with a first solution that removes non-specifically or weakly bound biomolecules. Then the immobilized target is eluted with a second solution that includes a saturation amount of free target, e.g., replicates of the target that are not attached to the particle. The free target binds to biomolecules that dissociate from the target. Rebinding is effectively prevented by the saturating amount of free target relative to the much lower concentration of immobilized target.\n\n\nThe second solution can have solution conditions that are substantially physiological or that are stringent. Typically, the solution conditions of the second solution are identical to the solution conditions of the first solution. Fractions of the second solution are collected in temporal order to distinguish early from late fractions. Later fractions include biomolecules that dissociate at a slower rate from the target than biomolecules in the early fractions.\n\n\nFurther, it is also possible to recover display library members that remain bound to the target even after extended incubation. These can either be dissociated using chaotropic conditions or can be amplified while attached to the target. For example, phage bound to the target can be contacted to bacterial cells.\n\n\nSelecting and Screening for Specificity. “Selection”, in the context of a display library, refers to a process in which many members of a display library are allowed to contact the target and those that bind are recovered and propagated. The selection can be from a library having numerous members, e.g., more than 10\n10 \nmembers. “Screening”, in the context of a display library, refers to a process in which isolated members of the library are tested singly for binding to the target. Through automation, thousands of candidates may be screened in a highly parallel process. The display library selection methods described herein can include a selection process that discards display library members that bind to a non-target molecule.\n\n\nExamples of non-target molecules, e.g., for an hK1 binding antibody, include, e.g., proteases other hK1, e.g., kallikreins other than hK1, e.g., hK2, hK3 hK4, hK5, hK6, hK7, hK8, hK9, hK10, hK11, hK12, hK13, hK14, or hK15. Useful hK1 binding antibodies may be specific for a subset of kallikreins, e.g., they may interact with a plurality of kallikreins, at least one of which is hK1.\n\n\nIn one implementation, a so-called “negative selection” step is used to discriminate between the target and related non-target molecule and a related, but distinct non-target molecule. The display library or a pool thereof is contacted to the non-target molecule. Members of the sample that do not bind the non-target are collected and used in subsequent selections for binding to the target molecule or even for subsequent negative selections. The negative selection step can be prior to or after selecting library members that bind to the target molecule.\n\n\nIn another implementation, a screening step is used. After display library members are isolated for binding to the target molecule, each isolated library member is tested for its ability to bind to a non-target molecule (e.g., a non-target listed above). For example, a high-throughput ELISA screen can be used to obtain this data. The ELISA screen can also be used to obtain quantitative data for binding of each library member to the target. The non-target and target binding data are compared (e.g., using a computer and software) to identify library members that specifically bind to hK1.\n\n\nThe display library selection and screening methods described herein can include a selection or screening process that selects for display library members that bind to specific sites on the target molecule. For example, elution with high concentration of an antibody described herein selects for phage that bind to the epitope bound by such an antibody. One can screen for a phage that binds to a particular epitope of hK1 by performing ELISAs with and without a competing antibody that recognizes the epitope in the buffer.\n\n\nAntibody Display Libraries\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the display library presents a diverse pool of proteins, each of which includes at least one and typically two immunoglobulin variable domains. Display libraries are particular useful, for example, for identifying human or effectively human antibodies that recognize human antigens. Since the constant and framework regions of the antibody are human, these therapeutic antibodies may avoid themselves being recognized and targeted as antigens. The constant regions are also optimized to recruit effector functions of the human immune system. The in vitro display selection process surmounts the inability of a normal human immune system to generate antibodies against self-antigens.\n\n\nA typical antibody display library displays a protein that includes a VH domain and a VL domain. The display library can display the antibody as a Fab fragment (e.g., using two polypeptide chains) or a single chain Fv (e.g., using a single polypeptide chain). Other formats can also be used.\n\n\nAs in the case of the Fab and other formats, the displayed antibody can include a constant region as part of a light or heavy chain. In one embodiment, each chain includes one constant region, e.g., as in the case of a Fab. In other embodiments, additional constant regions are displayed.\n\n\nAntibody libraries can be constructed by a number of processes (see, e.g., de Haard et al. (1999) \nJ. Biol. Chem \n274:18218-30; Hoogenboom et al. (1998) \nImmunotechnology \n4:1-20; Hoogenboom et al. (2000) \nImmunol Today \n21:371-8; US 2003-0232333 and US 2004-0029113). Further, elements of each process can be combined with those of other processes. The processes can be used such that variation is introduced into a single immunoglobulin domain (e.g., VH or VL) or into multiple immunoglobulin domains (e.g., VH and VL). The variation can be introduced into an immunoglobulin variable domain, e.g., in the region of one or more of CDR1, CDR2, CDR3, FR1, FR2, FR3, and FR4, referring to such regions of either and both of heavy and light chain variable domains. In one embodiment, variation is introduced into all three CDRs of a given variable domain. In another preferred embodiment, the variation is introduced into CDR1 and CDR2, e.g., of a heavy chain variable domain. Any combination is feasible. In one process, antibody libraries are constructed by inserting diverse oligonucleotides that encode CDRs into the corresponding regions of the nucleic acid encoding the display protein or portion thereof. The oligonucleotides can be synthesized using a variety of subunits, e.g., monomeric nucleotides or trinucleotides. For example, Knappik et al. (2000) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n296:57-86 describe a method for constructing CDR encoding oligonucleotides using trinucleotide synthesis and a template with engineered restriction sites for accepting the oligonucleotides.\n\n\nIn another process, an animal, e.g., a rodent, is immunized with the hK1. The animal is optionally boosted with the antigen to further stimulate the response. Then spleen cells are isolated from the animal, and nucleic acid encoding VH and/or VL domains is amplified and cloned for expression in the display library.\n\n\nIn yet another process, antibody libraries are constructed from nucleic acid amplified from naïve germline immunoglobulin genes (e.g., human genes). The amplified nucleic acid includes nucleic acid encoding the VH and/or VL domain. Sources of immunoglobulin-encoding nucleic acids are described below. Amplification can include PCR, e.g., with primers that anneal to the conserved constant region, or another amplification method.\n\n\nNucleic acid encoding immunoglobulin domains or fragments thereof can be obtained from the immune cells of, e.g., a human, a primate, mouse, rabbit, camel, or rodent. Cells can be selected for a particular property. For example, B cells at various stages of maturity, including naïve B cells, can be selected.\n\n\nFluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS) can be used to sort B cells that express surface-bound IgM, IgD, or IgG molecules. Further, B cells expressing different isotypes of IgG can be isolated. B and T cells can be cultured and stimulated in vitro, e.g., by culturing with feeder cells or by adding mitogens or other modulatory reagents, such as antibodies to CD40, CD40 ligand or CD20, phorbol myristate acetate, bacterial lipopolysaccharide, concanavalin A, phytohemagglutinin or pokeweed mitogen.\n\n\nCells can also be isolated from a subject that has an immunological disorder, e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, vasculitis, Sjogren syndrome, systemic sclerosis, or anti-phospholipid syndrome. The subject can be a human, or an animal, e.g., an animal model for the human disease, or an animal having an analogous disorder. Cells can be isolated from a transgenic non-human animal that includes a human immunoglobulin locus.\n\n\nThe cells can have activated a program of somatic hypermutation. Cells can be stimulated to undergo somatic mutagenesis of immunoglobulin genes, for example, by treatment with anti-immunoglobulin, anti-CD40, and anti-CD38 antibodies (see, e.g., Bergthorsdottir et al. (2001) \nJ Immunol. \n166:2228). In another embodiment, the cells are naïve.\n\n\nThe nucleic acid encoding an immunoglobulin variable domain can be isolated from a natural repertoire by the following exemplary method. First, RNA is isolated from the immune cell. Full length (e.g., capped) mRNAs are separated (e.g. by dephosphorylating uncapped RNAs with calf intestinal phosphatase). The cap is then removed with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase and reverse transcription is used to produce the cDNAs.\n\n\nThe reverse transcription of the first (antisense) strand can be done in any manner with any suitable primer. See, e.g., de Haard et al. (1999) \nJ. Biol. Chem \n274:18218-30. The primer binding region can be constant among different immunoglobulins, e.g., in order to reverse transcribe different isotypes of immunoglobulin. The primer binding region can also be specific to a particular isotype of immunoglobulin. Typically, the primer is specific for a region that is 3′ to a sequence encoding at least one CDR. In another embodiment, poly-dT primers may be used (and may be preferred for the heavy-chain genes).\n\n\nA synthetic sequence can be ligated to the 3′ end of the reverse transcribed strand. The synthetic sequence can be used as a primer binding site for binding of the forward primer during PCR amplification after reverse transcription. The use of the synthetic sequence can obviate the need to use a pool of different forward primers to fully capture the available diversity.\n\n\nThe variable domain-encoding gene is then amplified, e.g., using one or more rounds. If multiple rounds are used, nested primers can be used for increased fidelity. The amplified nucleic acid is then cloned into a display library vector.\n\n\nAntibody Production\n\n\nSome antibodies, e.g., Fabs, can be produced in bacterial cells, e.g., \nE. coli \ncells. For example, if the Fab is encoded by sequences in a phage display vector that includes a suppressible stop codon between the display entity and a bacteriophage protein (or fragment thereof), the vector nucleic acid can be shuffled into a bacterial cell that cannot suppress a stop codon. In this case, the Fab is not fused to the gene III protein and is secreted into the media.\n\n\nAntibodies can also be produced in eukaryotic cells. In one embodiment, the antibodies (e.g., scFv's) are expressed in a yeast cell such as \nPichia \n(see, e.g., Powers et al. (2001) \nJ Immunol Methods. \n251:123-35), Hanseula, or \nSaccharomyces. \n \n\n\nIn one embodiment, antibodies, particularly full length antibodies, e.g., IgG's, are produced in mammalian cells. Exemplary mammalian host cells for recombinant expression include Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO cells) (including dhfr− CHO cells, described in Urlaub and Chasin (1980) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n77:4216-4220, used with a DHFR selectable marker, e.g., as described in Kaufman and Sharp (1982) \nMol. Biol. \n159:601-621), lymphocytic cell lines, e.g., NS0 myeloma cells and SP2 cells, COS cells, K562, and a cell from a transgenic animal, e.g., a transgenic mammal. For example, the cell is a mammary epithelial cell.\n\n\nIn addition to the nucleic acid sequence encoding the immunoglobulin domain, the recombinant expression vectors may carry additional sequences, such as sequences that regulate replication of the vector in host cells (e.g., origins of replication) and selectable marker genes. The selectable marker gene facilitates selection of host cells into which the vector has been introduced (see e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,399,216, 4,634,665 and 5,179,017). Exemplary selectable marker genes include the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene (for use in dhfr\n−\n host cells with methotrexate selection/amplification) and the neo gene (for G418 selection).\n\n\nIn an exemplary system for recombinant expression of an antibody (e.g., a full length antibody or an antigen-binding portion thereof), a recombinant expression vector encoding both the antibody heavy chain and the antibody light chain is introduced into dhfr− CHO cells by calcium phosphate-mediated transfection. Within the recombinant expression vector, the antibody heavy and light chain genes are each operatively linked to enhancer/promoter regulatory elements (e.g., derived from SV40, CMV, adenovirus and the like, such as a CMV enhancer/AdMLP promoter regulatory element or an SV40 enhancer/AdMLP promoter regulatory element) to drive high levels of transcription of the genes. The recombinant expression vector also carries a DHFR gene, which allows for selection of CHO cells that have been transfected with the vector using methotrexate selection/amplification. The selected transformant host cells are cultured to allow for expression of the antibody heavy and light chains and intact antibody is recovered from the culture medium. Standard molecular biology techniques are used to prepare the recombinant expression vector, transfect the host cells, select for transformants, culture the host cells, and recover the antibody from the culture medium. For example, some antibodies can be isolated by affinity chromatography with a Protein A or Protein G.\n\n\nFor antibodies that include an Fc domain, the antibody production system may synthesize antibodies in which the Fc region is glycosylated. For example, the Fc domain of IgG molecules is glycosylated at asparagine 297 in the CH2 domain. This asparagine is the site for modification with biantennary-type oligosaccharides. This glycosylation participates in effector functions mediated by Fcγ receptors and complement C1q (Burton and Woof (1992) \nAdv. Immunol. \n51:1-84; Jefferis et al. (1998) \nImmunol. Rev. \n163:59-76). The Fc domain can be produced in a mammalian expression system that appropriately glycosylates the residue corresponding to asparagine 297. The Fc domain can also include other eukaryotic post-translational modifications.\n\n\nAntibodies may also include modifications, e.g., that alter Fc function. For example, the human IgG1 constant region can be mutated at one or more residues, e.g., one or more of residues 234 and 237, e.g., according to the number in U.S. Pat. No. 5,648,260. Other exemplary modifications include those described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,648,260.\n\n\nAntibodies can also be produced by a transgenic animal. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,849,992 describes a method for expressing an antibody in the mammary gland of a transgenic mammal. A transgene is constructed that includes a milk-specific promoter and nucleic acids encoding the antibody of interest and a signal sequence for secretion. The milk produced by females of such transgenic mammals includes, secreted-therein, the antibody of interest. The antibody can be purified from the milk, or for some applications, used directly.\n\n\nIt is also possible to produce antibodies that bind to hK1 by immunization, e.g., using an animal, e.g., with natural, human, or partially human immunoglobulin loci. In one embodiment, the non-human animal includes at least a part of a human immunoglobulin gene. For example, it is possible to engineer mouse strains deficient in mouse antibody production with large fragments of the human Ig loci. Using the hybridoma technology, antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies derived from the genes with the desired specificity may be produced and selected. See, e.g., XenoMouse™, Green et al. Nature Genetics 7:13-21 (1994), U.S. 2003-0070185, and WO 96/34096.\n\n\nAll or part of hK1 can be used as an immunogen.\n\n\nNon-human antibodies can also be modified to include substitutions that insert human immunoglobulin sequences, e.g., consensus human amino acid residues at particular positions, e.g., at one or more of the following positions (preferably at least five, ten, twelve, or all): (in the FR of the variable domain of the light chain) 4L, 35L, 36L, 38L, 43L, 44L, 58L, 46L, 62L, 63L, 64L, 65L, 66L, 67L, 68L, 69L, 70L, 71L, 73L, 85L, 87L, 98L, and/or (in the FR of the variable domain of the heavy chain) 2H, 4H, 24H, 36H, 37H, 39H, 43H, 45H, 49H, 58H, 60H, 67H, 68H, 69H, 70H, 73H, 74H, 75H, 78H, 91H, 92H, 93H, and/or 103H (according to the Kabat numbering). See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,407,213.\n\n\nExemplary Human Antibodies\n\n\nIn one embodiment, an hK1 binding antibody described herein includes one or more human framework sequences, e.g., a human or effectively human FR1, FR2, FR3, and/or FR4 in the heavy and/or light chain variable domain sequence.\n\n\nIn one implementation the heavy chain variable domain sequence has H1 and H2 hypervariable loops have the 1-3 canonical structures according to Chothia et al. (1992) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n227:799-817; Tomlinson et al. (1992) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n227:776-798). Exemplary frameworks which are compatible with these structures include the following sequences for FR1, FR2, and FR3 respectively:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEVQLVESGGGLVQPGGSLRLSCAASGFTF WVRQAPGKGLEWVA RFTISRDNAKNSLYLQMNSLRAEDTAVYYCAR\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEVQLVESGGGLVQPGRSLRLSCAASGFTF WVRQAPGKGLEWVS RFTISRDNAKNSLYLQMNSLRAEDTALYYCAKD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nQVQLVESGGGLVKPGGSLRLSCAASGFTF WIRQAPGKGLEWVS RFTISRDNAKNSLYLQMNSLRAEDTAVYYCAR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEVQLVESGGGVVRPGGSLRLSCAASGFTF WVRQAPGKGLEWVS RFTISRDNAKNSLYLQMNSLRAEDTALYHCAR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEVQLVESGGGLVKPGGSLRLSCAASGFTF WVRQAPGKGLEWVS RFTISRDNAKNSLYLQMNSLRAEDTAVYYCAR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEVQLLESGGGLVQPGGSLRLSCAASGFTF WVRQAPGKGLEWVS RFTISRDNSKNTLYLQMNSLRAEDTAVYYCAK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nQVQLVESGGGVVQPGRSLRLSCAASGFTF WVRQAPGKGLEWVA RFTISRDNSKNTLYLQMNSLRAEDTAVYYCAK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nQVQLVESCGGVVQPGRSLRLSCAASGFTF WVRQAPGKGLEWVA RFTISRDNSKNTLYLQMNSLRAEDTAVYYCAR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nQVQLVESGGGVVQPGRSLRLSCAASGFTF WVRQAPGKGLEWVA RFTISRDNSKNTLYLQMNSLRAEDTAVYYCAK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nQVQLVESGGGVVQPGRSLRLSCAASGFTF WVRQAPGKGLEWVA RFTISRDNSKNTLYLQMNSLRAEDTAVYYCAR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEVQLVESGGVVVQPGGSLRLSCAASGFTF WVRQAPGKGLEWVS RFTISRDNSKNSLYLQMNSLRTEDTALYYCAKD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerally, frameworks from any human germline antibody sequences that are compatible with a 1-3 canonical structure can be used for the heavy chain. Similarly, light chain frameworks can be selected from compatible human germline antibody sequences for respectively light chain CDRs. Frameworks from VH or VL segments can be used for FR1, FR2, and FR3.\n\n\nTarget Protein Production\n\n\nhK1 can be produced by recombinant expression techniques, e.g., expression in \nE. coli \nor \nPichia pastoris\n. Human kallikrein hK1 can also be purified to homogeneity from urine essentially as described in Irie et al. (1986) Biochem. Int. 13, 375-382.\n\n\nBinding Assays\n\n\nELISA. Proteins, e.g., antibodies that may interact with hK1, can be evaluated for an interaction property, e.g., a binding property using an ELISA assay. For example, each protein is contacted to a microtitre plate whose bottom surface has been coated with the target, e.g., a limiting amount of the target. The plate is washed with buffer to remove non-specifically bound polypeptides. Then the amount of the protein bound to the plate is determined by probing the plate with an antibody that can recognize the polypeptide, e.g., a tag or constant portion of the polypeptide. The antibody is linked to an enzyme such as alkaline phosphatase, which produces a calorimetric product when appropriate substrates are provided. The protein can be purified from cells or assayed in a display library format, e.g., as a fusion to a filamentous bacteriophage coat. Alternatively, cells (e.g., live or fixed) that express the target molecule, e.g., hK1, can be plated in a microtitre plate and used to test the affinity of the peptides/antibodies present in the display library or obtained by selection from the display library.\n\n\nIn another version of the ELISA assay, each polypeptide of a diversity strand library is used to coat a different well of a microtitre plate. The ELISA then proceeds using a constant target molecule to query each well.\n\n\nHomogeneous Binding Assays. The binding interaction of candidate protein with a target can be analyzed using a homogenous assay, e.g., after all components of the assay are added, additional fluid manipulations are not required. For example, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) can be used as a homogenous assay (see, for example, Lakowicz et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,631,169; Stavrianopoulos, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,868,103). A fluorophore label on the first molecule (e.g., the molecule identified in the fraction) is selected such that its emitted fluorescent energy can be absorbed by a fluorescent label on a second molecule (e.g., the target) if the second molecule is in proximity to the first molecule. The fluorescent label on the second molecule fluoresces when it absorbs to the transferred energy. Since the efficiency of energy transfer between the labels is related to the distance separating the molecules, the spatial relationship between the molecules can be assessed. In a situation in which binding occurs between the molecules, the fluorescent emission of the ‘acceptor’ molecule label in the assay should be maximal. A binding event that is configured for monitoring by FRET can be conveniently measured through standard fluorometric detection means well known in the art (e.g., using a fluorimeter). By titrating the amount of the first or second binding molecule, a binding curve can be generated to estimate the equilibrium binding constant.\n\n\nAnother example of a homogenous assay is Alpha Screen (Packard Bioscience, Meriden Conn.). Alpha Screen uses two labeled beads. One bead generates singlet oxygen when excited by a laser. The other bead generates a light signal when singlet oxygen diffuses from the first bead and collides with it. The signal is only generated when the two beads are in proximity. One bead can be attached to the display library member, the other to the target. Signals are measured to determine the extent of binding.\n\n\nThe homogenous assays can be performed while the candidate protein is attached to the display library vehicle, e.g., a bacteriophage or using a candidate protein as free molecule.\n\n\nSurface Plasmon Resonance (SPR). The binding interaction of a molecule isolated from a display library and a target can be analyzed using SPR. SPR or Biomolecular Interaction Analysis (BIA) detects biospecific interactions in real time, without labeling any of the interactants. Changes in the mass at the binding surface (indicative of a binding event) of the BIA chip result in alterations of the refractive index of light near the surface (the optical phenomenon of surface plasmon resonance (SPR)). The changes in the refractivity generate a detectable signal, which are measured as an indication of real-time reactions between biological molecules. Methods for using SPR are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,640; Raether (1988) \nSurface Plasmons \nSpringer Verlag; Sjolander and Urbaniczky (1991) \nAnal. Chem. \n63:2338-2345; Szabo et al. (1995) \nCurr. Opin. Struct. Biol. \n5:699-705 and on-line resources provide by BIAcore International AB (Uppsala, Sweden).\n\n\nInformation from SPR can be used to provide an accurate and quantitative measure of the equilibrium dissociation constant (K\nd\n), and kinetic parameters, including K\non \nand K\noff\n, for the binding of a biomolecule to a target. Such data can be used to compare different biomolecules. For example, proteins encoded by nucleic acid selected from a library of diversity strands can be compared to identify individuals that have high affinity for the target or that have a slow K\noff\n. This information can also be used to develop structure-activity relationships (SAR). For example, the kinetic and equilibrium binding parameters of matured versions of a parent protein can be compared to the parameters of the parent protein. Variant amino acids at given positions can be identified that correlate with particular binding parameters, e.g., high affinity and slow K\noff\n. This information can be combined with structural modeling (e.g., using homology modeling, energy minimization, or structure determination by crystallography or NMR). As a result, an understanding of the physical interaction between the protein and its target can be formulated and used to guide other design processes.\n\n\nProtein Arrays. Polypeptides identified from the display library can be immobilized on a solid support, for example, on a bead or an array. For a protein array, each of the polypeptides is immobilized at a unique address on a support. Typically, the address is a two-dimensional address. Protein arrays are described below (see, e.g., Diagnostics).\n\n\nBiological Assays\n\n\nIn vitro biochemical assays can be used to evaluate inhibition of hK1 proteolysis. See, e.g., Bourgeois et al. (1997) \nJ. Biol. Chemistry \n272:29590-29595. Exemplary peptide substrates that can be used to monitor hK1 proteolysis include: Abz-FRSARQ-EDDnp, Abz-TFRSARQ-EDDnp, Abz-FTFRSARQ-EDDnp, Abz-AIKFFSAQ-EDDnp, Abz-VIAGRSLNPNQ-EDDnp, Abz-AMSRMSLSSFSVNRQ-EDDnp, Abz-AIKFFSRQ-EDDnp, and Abz-TFFSARQ-EDDnp, wherein Abz represents o-aminobenzoyl, and EDDnp represents N-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)ethylenediamine. The intramolecularly quenched fluorogenic peptides can be synthesized by classical solution methods; a glutamine can be positioned as the C-terminal residue. See, e.g., Hirata et al. Lett. Pept. Sci. 1, 299-308. Syntheses can be performed with Fmoc methodology using a multiple automated peptide synthesizer (PSSM-8, Shimadzu Co.). Intramolecularly quenched fluorogenic substrates can be prepared as 2 mM stock solutions in N,N-dimethylformamide and diluted with activation buffer. Substrate purity can be checked by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (TofSpec-E, Micromass) and by reverse-phase chromatography on a C18 column eluted with a 10-min linear gradient of 0-60% acetonitrile in 0.075% TFA at 2.0 ml/min.\n\n\nExemplary conditions for evaluating enzymatic kinetics are at 37° C. in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.3, containing 1 mM EDTA and 0.02% IGEPAL (previously Nonidet P-40).\n\n\nAnimal Models\n\n\nU.S. Pat. No. 5,911,988 describes an exemplary mouse model for asthma. The mouse model can be used to evaluate the ability of an hK1 binding protein that also recognizes the murine KLK1 protein. The mouse may also be modified to express hK1. The mouse is subjected to long-term repeated inhalations of allergen and can be used to evaluate the long term effect of allergic diseases in the lung, and to delineate the cells, mechanisms, molecules, and mediators involved in the induction of airway hyperresponsiveness of lung in humans.\n\n\nFemale BALB/c mice (6-8 wk) can be used and maintained under conventional conditions for the studies.\n\n\nReagents: Crystalline OVA was obtained from Pierce Chem. Co. (Rockford, Ill.) aluminum potassium sulfate (alum) from Sigma Chem. Co. (St. Louis, Mo.), pyrogen-free distilled water from Baxter, Healthcare Corporation (Deerfield, Ill.), 0.9% sodium chloride (normal saline) from Lymphomed (Deerfield, Ill.) and TRAPPSOL™ HPB-L100 (aqueous hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin; 45 wt/vol % aqueous solution) from Cyclodextrin Technologies Development, Inc. (Gainesville, Fla.).\n\n\nAllergen Immunization/Challenge Protocols: Mice received an i.p. injection of 0.2 ml (100 μg) of OVA with alum (J. Exp Med. 1996; 184: 1483-1494). Different protocols may be used. For example, mice can be anesthetized with 0.2 ml i.p. of ketamine (0.44 mg/ml)/xylazine (6.3 mg/ml) in normal saline before receiving an intranasal (i.n.) dose of 100 μg OVA in 0.05 ml normal saline and an i.n. dose of 50 μg OVA in 0.05 ml normal saline separately on different days. To evaluate an hK1 binding protein, the protein can be administered with a test dosage of the hK1 binding protein, e.g., before the intranasal dose challenge, and compared to corresponding control mice that receive a control administration that does not include the hK1 binding protein.\n\n\nHistology. The trachea and left lung (the right lung is used for bronchoalveolar lavage (“BAL”)) are obtained and fixed in 10% neutral formaldehyde solution at room temperature for 6.about.15 h. After being embedded in paraffin, the tissues are cut into 5 μm sections and can be processed with the different staining or immunolabeling further. Discombe's eosinophil staining can be used for counting the cell numbers with the counterstain of methylene blue. The eosinophil number per unit airway area (2,200 μm\n2\n) can be determined by morphometry (J. Pathol. 1992; 166: 395-404; Am Rev Respir Dis. 1993; 147:448-456). Fibrosis can be identified with the Masson's trichrome staining. Airway mucus can be identified by the following staining method: methylene blue, hematoxylin and eosin, mucicarmine, alcian blue, and alcian blue/periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) reaction (Troyer, H., “Carbohydrates” in Principles and Techniques of Histochemistry, Little, Brown and Company, Boston, Mass., 1980: 89-121; Sheehan, D. C., et al., “Carbohydrates” in Theory and Practice of Histotechnology, Battle Press, Columbus, Ohio, 1980: 159-179). Mucin can be stained with mucicarmine solution; metanil yellow counterstain was employed. Acidic mucin and sulfated mucosubstances can be stained with alcian blue, pH 2.5; nuclear fast red counterstain can also used. Neutral and acidic mucosubstances were identified by alcian blue, pH 2.5, and PAS reaction. The degree of mucus plugging of the airways (0.5-0.8 mm in diameter) can also assessed by morphometry. The percent occlusion of airway diameter by mucus was classified on a semiquantitative scale from 0 to 4+. The histologic and morphometric analyses can be performed by individuals blinded to the protocol design.\n\n\nPulmonary Function Testing. On day 28, 24 hours after the last i.n. administration of either normal saline or OVA, pulmonary mechanics to intravenous infusion of methacholine can be determined in mice in vivo by a plethysmographic method, e.g., as previously described (10, 1958; 192: 364-368; J. Appl. Physiol. 1988; 64: 2318-2323; J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1483-1494), or using modifications thereof. At the completion of pulmonary function testing, each mouse can be exsanguinated by cardiac puncture and the lung tissue with trachea can be used for the further analysis.\n\n\nBronchoalveolar Lavage. After tying off the left lung at the mainstem bronchus, the right lung can be lavaged three times with 0.4 ml of normal saline. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid cells from a 0.05-ml aliquot of the pooled sample are counted using a hemocytometer and the remaining fluid centrifuged at 4° C. for 10 minutes at 200 g. The supernatant is stored at −70° C. until eicosanoid analysis is performed. After resuspension of the cell pellet in normal saline containing 10% bovine serum albumin (“BSA”), BAL cell smears can be made on glass slides. To stain eosinophils, dried slides are stained with Discombe's diluting fluid (0.05% aqueous eosin and 5% acetone (vol/vol) in distilled water; J. Exp. Med. 1970; 131: 1271-1287) for 5-8 minutes, rinsed with water for 0.5 minutes, and counterstained with 0.07% methylene blue for 2 minutes.\n\n\nAssay of Airway Mucus Glycoproteins. Mucus glycoproteins in BAL fluid are assayed by slot blotting and PAS staining (Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 160-164; Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1995; 12: 296-306). Nitrocellulose membranes (0.2-.mu.m pore size; Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, N.H.) are wetted in distilled water and then in normal saline before placement in a Minifold II 72-well slot blot apparatus (Schleicher & Schuell). The BAL fluid samples (0.05 ml) and aliquots (0.05-0.75 l) of a stock solution (2.mu.m/ml) of human respiratory mucin glycoprotein (Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1991; 5: 71-79) are blotted onto the nitro-cellulose membranes by water suction vacuum, and mucus glycoproteins are visualized by PAS reaction. Reflectance densitometry can be performed to quantitate the PAS staining. The integrated intensity of the PAS reactivity of the BAL samples can be quantitated by comparison to the standard curve for human respiratory mucin.\n\n\nImmunocytochemistry. Monoclonal antibody: CD11c (DAB method) and Mac1 (Beringer Mannheim, ABC method with Hitomouse Kit, Zymed) can be used to identify inflammatory cell types, e.g., dendric cells, macrophages and lymphocytes, in/around the areas of vasculatures, airways and fibrosis.\n\n\nU.S. Pat. No. 6,462,020 describes an exemplary mouse model for arthritis, the induced Type II Collagen Arthritis Mouse Model. The mouse model can be used to evaluate the effect of hK1 binding proteins on the histological, radiographic and clinical appearance of induced type II collagen arthritis.\n\n\nAutoimmune diseases cause significant and chronic morbidity and disability. Arthritis in its many forms is representative of a family of autoimmune diseases. In the clinical realm, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common form of the severe arthrodysplastic disease. RA is a progressive disease.\n\n\nThe histopathology of arthritic lesions occurring in murine CIA share enormous similarities to that of RA in human patients. Murine CIA is a useful model to study potential therapeutic treatments of RA.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods Mice: DBA/1(2) male mice weighing 25 gms (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, Me. or B&K Universal, Kent Wash.) are used for this work. This strain of mouse is susceptible to CIA by the injection of heterologous type II collagen. Bovine Collagen (BC), Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) and Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant (ICFA) can be obtained from Sigma Chemical. Antigen for immunization is processed in 0.1 M acetic acid and formulated with CFA or ICFA.\n\n\nInduction of Arthritis. Immunization protocol: Mice are injected with 100 μg of type II collagen in CFA at predetermined intervals during the study period.\n\n\nThe mice are examined at predetermined intervals for the development of arthritis. Presumptive evidence of arthritis includes swelling and erythema of at least one toe joint on the front and/or rear feet on two consecutive observations.\n\n\nConfirmatory Diagnosis of Arthritis. Histological Examination of joints: The toe joints of animals sacrificed at appropriate intervals are removed, fixed, decalcified, embedded, in paraffin, sectioned, and stained for observation of general cellular and structural features and to detect cartilaginous matrix of the pannus of each joint, as appropriate. The degree of cellularity and areas of inflammation are quantified by using digitization of histological photomicrographs and applying standard area and point counting techniques as described above.\n\n\nRadiographic evaluation of toe joints is performed to detect the incidence of joint changes after immunization with type II collagen. A mammography imaging system has been modified for this work. The average area of soft tissue (pannus) of the joint is determined by analysis of computer digitized radiographs, along with changes in density of the adjacent hard tissues by comparison with internal standards included with each radiograph. To serve as a baseline control for the changing density of the hard tissues and areas of panni, additional mice are used over the same period and the density and area data compared. The significance of the differences in density and area for control and experimental mice is assessed using paired T-tests at each time point.\n\n\nArthritis Evaluation. Animals are observed daily for the onset of arthritis. An arthritis index is derived by grading the severity of involvement of each paw on a scale from 0 to 4. Scoring is based upon the degree of peri-articular erythema and edema, as well as deformity of the joints. Swelling of hind paws is also quantitated by measuring the thickness of the ankle from the medial to the lateral malledus with a constant tension caliper.\n\n\nTuohy et al. (J. Immunol. (1988) 141: 1126-1130), Sobel et al. (J. Immunol. (1984) 132: 2393-2401), and Traugott (Cell Immunol. (1989) 119: 114-129), describe experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) mouse model for multiple sclerosis. This mouse model can be used to evaluate an hK1 binding protein for modulation of a symptom of multiple sclerosis.\n\n\nPharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\nAlso featured is a composition, e.g., a pharmaceutically acceptable composition, that includes an hK1 binding protein, e.g., an hK1 binding antibody, e.g., as described herein. As used herein, “pharmaceutical compositions” encompass compounds (e.g., labeled compounds) for diagnostic (e.g., in vivo imaging) use as well as compounds for therapeutic or prophylactic use.\n\n\nAs used herein, “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like that are physiologically compatible. In one embodiment, the carrier is other than water. Preferably, the carrier is suitable for intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, parenteral, spinal or epidermal administration (e.g., by injection or infusion). Depending on the route of administration, the active compound may be coated in a material to protect the compound from the action of acids and other natural conditions that may inactivate the compound.\n\n\nA “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” refers to a salt that retains the desired biological activity of the parent compound and does not impart any undesired toxicological effects (see e.g., Berge, S. M., et al. (1977) \nJ. Pharm. Sci. \n66:1-19). Examples of such salts include acid addition salts and base addition salts. Acid addition salts include those derived from nontoxic inorganic acids, such as hydrochloric, nitric, phosphoric, sulfuric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, phosphorous and the like, as well as from nontoxic organic acids such as aliphatic mono- and dicarboxylic acids, phenyl-substituted alkanoic acids, hydroxy alkanoic acids, aromatic acids, aliphatic and aromatic sulfonic acids and the like. Base addition salts include those derived from alkaline earth metals, such as sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium and the like, as well as from nontoxic organic amines, such as N,N′-dibenzylethylenediamine, N-methylglucamine, chloroprocaine, choline, diethanolamine, ethylenediamine, procaine and the like.\n\n\nThe compositions of this invention may be in a variety of forms. These include, for example, liquid, semi-solid and solid dosage forms, such as liquid solutions (e.g., injectable and infusible solutions), dispersions or suspensions, tablets, pills, powders, liposomes and suppositories. The preferred form depends on the intended mode of administration and therapeutic application. Typical preferred compositions are in the form of injectable or infusible solutions, such as compositions similar to those used for administration of humans with antibodies. The preferred mode of administration is parenteral (e.g., intravenous, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular). In a preferred embodiment, the compound is administered by intravenous infusion or injection. In another preferred embodiment, the compound is administered by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection.\n\n\nThe phrases “parenteral administration” and “administered parenterally” as used herein means modes of administration other than enteral and topical administration, usually by injection, and includes, without limitation, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarterial, intrathecal, intracapsular, intraorbital, intracardiac, intradermal, intraperitoneal, transtracheal, subcutaneous, subcuticular, intraarticular, subcapsular, subarachnoid, intraspinal, epidural and intrasternal injection and infusion.\n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions typically must be sterile and stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage. A pharmaceutical composition can also be tested to insure it meets regulatory and industry standards for administration. For example, endotoxin levels in the preparation can be tested using the \nLimulus amebocyte \nlysate assay (e.g., using the kit from Bio Whittaker lot # 7L3790, sensitivity 0.125 EU/mL) according to the USP 24/NF 19 methods. Sterility of pharmaceutical compositions can be determined using thioglycollate medium according to the USP 24/NF 19 methods. For example, the preparation is used to inoculate the thioglycollate medium and incubated at 35° C. for 14 or more days. The medium is inspected periodically to detect growth of a microorganism.\n\n\nThe composition can be formulated as a solution, microemulsion, dispersion, liposome, or other ordered structure suitable to high drug concentration. Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle that contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying that yields a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof. The proper fluidity of a solution can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prolonged absorption of injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent that delays absorption, for example, monostearate salts and gelatin.\n\n\nExemplary methods for formulating antibodies for delivery by inhalation are described below.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, an hK1 binding antibody is formulated for subcutaneous delivery, e.g., subcutaneous injection. Subcutaneous delivery can be used to treat any disorder described herein. In one implementation, the antibody is provided as a stable lyophilized protein formulation that includes a lyoprotectant (e.g., a sugar such as sucrose or trehalose). The lyophilized formulation can be reconstituted to generate a stable reconstituted formulation having a protein concentration which is significantly higher (e.g. from about 2-40 times higher, preferably 3-10 times higher and most preferably 3-6 times higher) than the protein concentration in the pre-lyophilized formulation. In particular, while the protein concentration in the pre-lyophilized formulation may be 5 mg/mL or less, the protein concentration in the reconstituted formulation can be 50 mg/mL or more. Accordingly, the formulation can include at least about 50 mg/ml of the hK1 binding protein. Such high protein concentrations in the reconstituted formulation can be useful for subcutaneous administration.\n\n\nThe reconstituted formulation can be isotonic. It can include a preservative (such as bacteriostatic water for injection, BWFI). The reconstituted formulation may be used for a multi-use formulation. Such a formulation is useful, for example, where the patient requires frequent subcutaneous administrations of the protein to treat a chronic medical condition. The ratio of lyoprotectant to protein may, for example, be about 100-1500 mole trehalose or sucrose: 1 mole antibody. A buffer can be used to stabilize the pH of the pre-lyophilized preparation, e.g. a pH in the range of 6-8. For example, the buffer can include one or more amino acid, e.g., histidine, or other agent that buffers within the range of 6-8 or has a pKa in such range. The formulation may further include a surfactant (e.g. a polysorbate).\n\n\nThe compounds described herein can be administered by a variety of methods known in the art. For many applications, the route/mode of administration is intravenous injection or infusion. For example, for therapeutic applications, the compound can be administered by intravenous infusion at a rate of less than 30, 20, 10, 5, or 1 mg/min to reach a dose of about 1 to 100 mg/m\n2 \nor 7 to 25 mg/m\n2\n. The route and/or mode of administration will vary depending upon the desired results. In certain embodiments, the active compound may be prepared with a carrier that will protect the compound against rapid release, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants, and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Many methods for the preparation of such formulations are patented or generally known. See, e.g., \nSustained and Controlled Release Drug Delivery Systems\n, J. R. Robinson, ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1978. Pharmaceutical formulation is a well-established art, and is further described in Gennaro (ed.), Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 20\nth \ned., Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins (2000) (ISBN: 0683306472); Ansel et al., Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, 7\nth \nEd., Lippincott Williams & Wilkins Publishers (1999) (ISBN: 0683305727); and Kibbe (ed.), Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients American Pharmaceutical Association, 3\nrd \ned. (2000) (ISBN: 091733096X).\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the composition may be orally administered, for example, with an inert diluent or an assimilable edible carrier. The compound (and other ingredients, if desired) may also be enclosed in a hard or soft shell gelatin capsule, compressed into tablets, or incorporated directly into the subject's diet. For oral therapeutic administration, the compound may be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of ingestible tablets, buccal tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the like. To administer a compound by other than parenteral administration, it may be necessary to coat the compound with, or co-administer the compound with, a material to prevent its inactivation.\n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions can be administered with medical devices known in the art. For example, in a preferred embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition of the invention can be administered with a needleless hypodermic injection device, such as the devices disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,399,163, 5,383,851, 5,312,335, 5,064,413, 4,941,880, 4,790,824, or 4,596,556. Examples of well-known implants and modules useful in the present invention include: U.S. Pat. No. 4,487,603, which discloses an implantable micro-infusion pump for dispensing medication at a controlled rate; U.S. Pat. No. 4,486,194, which discloses a therapeutic device for administering medicants through the skin; U.S. Pat. No. 4,447,233, which discloses a medication infusion pump for delivering medication at a precise infusion rate; U.S. Pat. No. 4,447,224, which discloses a variable flow implantable infusion apparatus for continuous drug delivery; U.S. Pat. No. 4,439,196, which discloses an osmotic drug delivery system having multi-chamber compartments; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,475,196, which discloses an osmotic drug delivery system. Of course, many other such implants, delivery systems, and modules are also known.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the compound can be formulated to ensure proper distribution in vivo. For example, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) excludes many highly hydrophilic compounds. To ensure that the therapeutic compounds of the invention cross the BBB (if desired), they can be formulated, for example, in liposomes. For methods of manufacturing liposomes, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,522,811; 5,374,548; and 5,399,331. The liposomes may comprise one or more moieties that are selectively transported into specific cells or organs, thus enhance targeted drug delivery (see, e.g., V. V. Ranade (1989) \nJ. Clin. Pharmacol. \n29:685).\n\n\nAlso within the scope of the invention are kits comprising a composition described herein (e.g., a composition a compound that contains an hK1 binding protein and instructions for use, e.g., treatment, prophylactic, or diagnostic use. In one embodiment, the kit includes (a) the compound, e.g., a composition that includes the compound, and, optionally, (b) informational material.

However, the informational material can also be provided in other formats, such as Braille, computer readable material, video recording, or audio recording. In another embodiment, the informational material of the kit is a link or contact information, e.g., a physical address, email address, hyperlink, website, or telephone number, where a user of the kit can obtain substantive information about the compound and/or its use in the methods described herein. Of course, the informational material can also be provided in any combination of formats.\n\n\nIn addition to the compound, the composition of the kit can include other ingredients, such as a solvent or buffer, a stabilizer or a preservative, and/or a second agent for treating a condition or disorder described herein. Alternatively, the other ingredients can be included in the kit, but in different compositions or containers than the compound. In such embodiments, the kit can include instructions for admixing the compound and the other ingredients, or for using the compound together with the other ingredients.\n\n\nThe compound can be provided in any form, e.g., liquid, dried or lyophilized form. It is preferred that the compound be substantially pure and/or sterile. When the compound is provided in a liquid solution, the liquid solution preferably is an aqueous solution, with a sterile aqueous solution being preferred. When the compound is provided as a dried form, reconstitution generally is by the addition of a suitable solvent. The solvent, e.g., sterile water or buffer, can optionally be provided in the kit.\n\n\nThe kit can include one or more containers for the composition containing the compound. In some embodiments, the kit contains separate containers, dividers or compartments for the composition and informational material. For example, the composition can be contained in a bottle, vial, or syringe, and the informational material can be contained in a plastic sleeve or packet. In other embodiments, the separate elements of the kit are contained within a single, undivided container. For example, the composition is contained in a bottle, vial or syringe that has attached thereto the informational material in the form of a label. In some embodiments, the kit includes a plurality (e.g., a pack) of individual containers, each containing one or more unit dosage forms (e.g., a dosage form described herein) of the compound. For example, the kit includes a plurality of syringes, ampules, foil packets, or blister packs, each containing a single unit dose of the compound. The containers of the kits can be air tight, waterproof (e.g., impermeable to changes in moisture or evaporation), and/or light-tight.\n\n\nIn one embodiment wherein the compound contains an hK1 binding antibody, the instructions for diagnostic applications include the use of the compound to detect hK1, in vitro, e.g., in a sample, e.g., a biopsy or cells from a patient having a pulmonary disorder or other disorder described herein, or in vivo. In another embodiment, the instructions for therapeutic applications include suggested dosages and/or modes of administration in a patient with a pulmonary disorder or other disorder described herein, e.g., asthma (e.g., allergic and non-allergic asthma), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteopathic arthritis, osteoarthritis, rhinitis, sinusitus, inflammatory bowel diseases (such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), immune mediated diabetes, acute pancreatitis, interstitial cystitis or a neoplastic disorder (e.g., a metastatic disorder or tumor angiogenesis). The kit can further contain a least one additional reagent, such as a diagnostic or therapeutic agent, e.g., a diagnostic or therapeutic agent as described herein, and/or one or more additional agents to treat the disorder, formulated as appropriate, in one or more separate pharmaceutical preparations.\n\n\nTreatments\n\n\nAn hK1 binding protein can be administered to a subject, e.g., a human subject, to treat, prevent, and/or diagnose a variety of disorders, such as hK1-associated disorders and diseases characterized by unwanted or aberrant hK1 activity. Exemplary disorders include asthma (e.g., allergic and non-allergic asthma), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, rhinitis, sinusitus, inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, immune mediated diabetes, acute pancreatitis, interstitial cystitis, or other hK1-associated disorder, or a neoplastic disorder (e.g., metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinomas, tumor angiogenesis). An “hK1-associated disorder” is a disorder in which hK1 mediates at least in part, such that reducing hK1 protein levels or activity can ameliorate at least one aspect of the disorder, e.g., at least one symptom of the disorder.\n\n\nIn addition to being administered to a subject, the compound can also be administered to cells, tissues, or organs in culture, e.g. in vitro or ex vivo.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “treat” or “treatment” is defined as the application or administration of a compound, alone or in combination with one or more other agents, to a subject, e.g., a patient, or application or administration of the agent to an isolated tissue or cell, e.g., cell line, from a subject, e.g., a patient, who has a disorder (e.g., a disorder as described herein), a symptom of a disorder or a predisposition toward a disorder, with the purpose to cure, heal, alleviate, relieve, alter, remedy, ameliorate, improve or affect the disorder, the symptoms of the disorder or the predisposition toward the disorder.\n\n\nAs used herein, an amount of an hK1 binding protein effective to treat a disorder, or a “therapeutically effective amount” refers to an amount of the compound which is effective, upon single or multiple dose administration to a subject, in treating a subject, e.g., curing, alleviating, relieving or ameliorating at least one symptom of a disorder in a subject to a degree beyond that expected in the absence of such treatment. For example, the disorder can be a pulmonary disorder, e.g., a pulmonary disorder described herein.\n\n\nA “locally effective amount” refers to the amount (e.g., concentration) of the compound which is effective at detectably modulating activity of a target protein (e.g., hK1) in a tissue, e.g., in a region of the lung exposed to hK1. Evidence of modulation can include, e.g., increased amount of substrate, e.g., reduced proteolysis of the substrate.\n\n\nAs used herein, an amount of an hK1 binding protein effective to prevent a disorder, or a “a prophylactically effective amount” of the protein refers to an amount of an hK1-binding protein which is effective, upon single- or multiple-dose administration to the subject, in preventing or delaying the occurrence of the onset or recurrence of a disorder, e.g., an hK1 associated disorder.\n\n\nThe terms “induce”, “inhibit”, “potentiate”, “elevate”, “increase”, “decrease” or the like, e.g., which denote quantitative differences between two states, refer to a difference, e.g., a statistically significant difference (e.g., P<0.05, 0.02, or 0.005), between the two states.\n\n\nDosage regimens are adjusted to provide the optimum desired response (e.g., a therapeutic response). For example, a single bolus may be administered, several divided doses may be administered over time or the dose may be proportionally reduced or increased as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. It is especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subjects to be treated; each unit contains a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier.\n\n\nAn exemplary, non-limiting range for a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of a compound described herein is 0.1-20 mg/kg, more preferably 1-10 mg/kg. The compound can be administered by intravenous infusion at a rate of less than 20, 10, 5, or 1 mg/min to reach a dose of about 1 to 50 mg/m\n2 \nor about 5 to 20 mg/m\n2\n. It is to be noted that dosage values may vary with the type and severity of the condition to be alleviated. It is to be further understood that for any particular subject, specific dosage regimens should be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the compositions, and that dosage ranges set forth herein are only exemplary.\n\n\nA pharmaceutical composition may include a “therapeutically effective amount” or a “prophylactically effective amount” of a compound described herein, e.g., a compound that includes a polypeptide that binds and inhibits hK1.\n\n\nA therapeutically effective amount of the composition may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the individual, and the ability of the compound to elicit a desired response in the individual. A therapeutically effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the composition is outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “subject” is intended to include human and non-human animals. The term “non-human animals” of the invention includes all vertebrates, e.g., non-mammals (such as chickens, amphibians, reptiles) and mammals, such as non-human primates, sheep, dog, cow, pig, etc.\n\n\nThe subject method can be used on cells in culture, e.g. in vitro or ex vivo. The method can be performed on cells present in a subject, as part of an in vivo (e.g., therapeutic or prophylactic) protocol. For in vivo embodiments, the contacting step is effected in a subject and includes administering the hK1-binding protein to the subject under conditions effective to permit both binding of the protein to hK1.\n\n\nMethods of administering compounds are described in “Pharmaceutical Compositions.” Suitable dosages of the compounds used will depend on the age and weight of the subject and the particular drug used. The compounds can be used as competitive agents to inhibit, reduce an undesirable interaction, e.g., between a natural substrate and hK1.\n\n\nhK1 binding proteins may also be used to deliver a variety of payloads, for example, drugs including therapeutic drugs, a compound emitting radiation, molecules of plants, fungal, or bacterial origin, biological proteins, and mixtures thereof. An hK1 binding protein can target the payload to a region of a subject in which hK1 is localized.\n\n\nEnzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof are exemplified by diphtheria toxin A fragment, nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin, exotoxin A (from \nPseudomonas aeruginosa\n), ricin A chain, abrin A chain, modeccin A chain, α-sacrin, certain \nAleurites fordii \nproteins, certain Dianthin proteins, \nPhytolacca americana \nproteins (PAP, PAPII and PAP-S), \nMorodica charantia \ninhibitor, curcin, crotin, \nSaponaria officinalis \ninhibitor, gelonin, mitogillin, restrictocin, phenomycin, and enomycin. Procedures for preparing enzymatically active polypeptides of the immunotoxins are described in WO 84/03508 and WO 85/03508. Examples of cytotoxic moieties that can be conjugated to the antibodies include adriamycin, chlorambucil, daunomycin, methotrexate, neocarzinostatin, and platinum.\n\n\nIn the case of polypeptide toxins, recombinant nucleic acid techniques can be used to construct a nucleic acid that encodes the hK1 binding protein and the cytotoxin (or a polypeptide component thereof) as translational fusions. The recombinant nucleic acid is then expressed, e.g., in cells and the encoded fusion polypeptide isolated. The fusion protein can be physically associated with a moiety that increases the molecular weight of the compound, e.g., to stabilize half-life in vivo, and then attached to a moiety (e.g., a polymer).\n\n\nProcedures for conjugating proteins with the cytotoxic agents have been previously described. For conjugating chlorambucil with proteins, see, e.g., Flechner (1973) \nEuropean Journal of Cancer, \n9:741-745; Ghose et al. (1972) \nBritish Medical Journal, \n3:495-499; and Szekerke, et al. (1972) \nNeoplasma, \n19:211-215. For conjugating daunomycin and adriamycin to proteins, see, e.g., Hurwitz, E. et al. (1975) \nCancer Research, \n35:1175-1181 and Arnon et al. (1982) \nCancer Surveys, \n1:429-449. For preparing protein-ricin conjugates, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,414,148 and by Osawa, T., et al. (1982) \nCancer Surveys, \n1:373-388 and the references cited therein. Coupling procedures as also described in EP 226 419.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, hK1 binding antibodies are used without conjugation to another moiety, e.g., as a full length antibody.\n\n\nChronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). The hK1 binding protein can also be used to ameliorate at least one symptom of a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Emphysema, along with chronic bronchitis, is part of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is a serious lung disease and is progressive, usually occurring in elderly patients. COPD causes over-inflation of structures in the lungs known as alveoli or air sacs. The walls of the alveoli break down resulting in a decrease in the respiratory ability of the lungs. Patients with this disease may first experience shortness of breath and cough. One clinical index for evaluating COPD is the destructive index which measures a measure of alveolar septal damage and emphysema, and has been proposed as a sensitive index of lung destruction that closely reflects functional abnormalities, especially loss of elastic recoil. See, e.g., Am Rev Respir Dis 1991 July; 144(1):156-9. The compound can be used to reduce the destructive index in a patient, e.g., a statistically significant amount, e.g., at least 10, 20, 30, or 40% or at least to within 50, 40, 30, or 20% of normal of a corresponding age and gender-matched individual.\n\n\nThe composition can be formulated for inhalation or other mode of pulmonary delivery. Accordingly, the compounds described herein can be administered by inhalation to pulmonary tissue. The term “pulmonary tissue” as used herein refers to any tissue of the respiratory tract and includes both the upper and lower respiratory tract, except where otherwise indicated.\n\n\nAccordingly, hK1 binding proteins can be administered in a method of treating (e.g., reducing, ameliorating) or preventing one or more symptoms associated with a respiratory disorder, e.g., asthma (e.g., allergic and nonallergic asthma); chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); a condition involving airway inflammation, eosinophilia, fibrosis and excess mucus production, e.g., cystic fibrosis and pulmonary fibrosis.\n\n\nAsthma. Symptoms of asthma include, for example, wheezing, shortness of breath, bronchoconstriction, airway hyperreactivity, decreased lung capacity, fibrosis, airway inflammation, and mucus production). An hK1 binding protein can be used to ameliorate or prevent at least one symptom of asthma, e.g., one of the above. An hK1 binding protein can also be administered in conjunction with another agent for treating asthma, e.g., anti-IgE antibody, cromolyn sodium and nedocromil, an inhaled steroids, a leukotriene modifier, a long-acting beta-agonists, an oral steroid, and theophylline.\n\n\nRheumatoid Arthritis (RA). This disorder is characterized by inflammation in the lining of the joints and/or other internal organs. It is typically chronic, but can include flare-ups. Exemplary symptoms include inflammation of joints, swelling, difficulty moving, pain, loss of appetite, fever, loss of energy, anemia, lumps (rheumatoid nodules) under the skin, especially in areas subject to pressure (e.g., back of elbows). An hK1 binding protein can be used to ameliorate or prevent at least one symptom of rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\nAn hK1 binding protein can be administered in conjunction with another agent for treating rheumatoid arthritis, such as NSAIDs and aspirin, analgesics, and corticosteroids, help reduce joint pain, stiffness and swelling. Exemplary agents include disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as methotrexate, leflunomide, D-Penicillamine, sulfasalazine, gold therapy, minocycline, azathioprine, hydroxychloroquine (and other antimalarials), cyclosporine, Prosorba therapy, and biologic agents.\n\n\nMultiple Sclerosis (MS). Multiple sclerosis is a central nervous system disease that is characterized by inflammation and loss of myelin sheaths. Patients that have MS or clinically probable MS may be identified by criteria establishing a diagnosis of clinically definite MS as defined by the workshop on the diagnosis of MS (Poser et al., Ann. Neurol. 13:227, 1983). Briefly, an individual with clinically definite MS has had two attacks and clinical evidence of either two lesions or clinical evidence of one lesion and paraclinical evidence of another, separate lesion. Definite MS may also be diagnosed by evidence of two attacks and oligoclonal bands of IgG in cerebrospinal fluid or by combination of an attack, clinical evidence of two lesions and oligoclonal band of IgG in cerebrospinal fluid.\n\n\nPatents having MS or clinically probably MS can be administered an hK1 binding protein, e.g., an hK1 binding antibody, to ameliorate at least one symptom of MS. The hK1 binding protein can also be provided in conjunction with another agent, e.g., IFNβ-1a and IFNβ-1b; a protein that simulates myelin basic protein (e.g., a synthetic protein, e.g., glatiramer acetate, COPAXONE®); corticosteroids; or mitoxantrone.\n\n\nEffective treatment of multiple sclerosis may be examined in several different ways. Satisfying any of the following criteria evidences effective treatment. Three main criteria are used: EDSS (extended disability status scale), appearance of exacerbations or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). The EDSS is a means to grade clinical impairment due to MS (Kurtzke, Neurology 33:1444, 1983). Eight functional systems are evaluated for the type and severity of neurologic impairment. Briefly, prior to treatment, patients are evaluated for impairment in the following systems: pyramidal, cerebella, brainstem, sensory, bowel and bladder, visual, cerebral, and other. Follow-ups are conducted at defined intervals. The scale ranges from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to MS). A decrease of one full step defines an effective treatment in the context of the present invention (Kurtzke, Ann. Neurol. 36:573-79, 1994). Exacerbations are defined as the appearance of a new symptom that is attributable to MS and accompanied by an appropriate new neurologic abnormality (IFNB MS Study Group, supra). In addition, the exacerbation must last at least 24 hours and be preceded by stability or improvement for at least 30 days. Briefly, patients are given a standard neurological examination by clinicians. Exacerbations are either mild, moderate, or severe according to changes in a Neurological Rating Scale (Sipe et al., Neurology 34:1368, 1984). An annual exacerbation rate and proportion of exacerbation-free patients are determined. Therapy is deemed to be effective if there is a statistically significant difference in the rate or proportion of exacerbation-free patients between the treated group and the placebo group for either of these measurements. In addition, time to first exacerbation and exacerbation duration and severity may also be measured. A measure of effectiveness as therapy in this regard is a statistically significant difference in the time to first exacerbation or duration and severity in the treated group compared to control group. MRI can be used to measure active lesions using gadolinium-DTPA-enhanced imaging (McDonald et al. Ann. Neurol. 36:14, 1994) or the location and extent of lesions using T\n2\n-weighted techniques.\n\n\nExemplary symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis include: optic neuritis, diplopia, nystagmus, ocular dysmetria, internuclear opthalmoplegia, movement and sound phosphenes, afferent pupillary defect, paresis, monoparesis, paraparesis, hemiparesis, quadraparesis, plegia, paraplegia, hemiplegia, tetraplegia, quadraplegia, spasticity, dysarthria, muscle atrophy, spasms, cramps, hypotonia, clonus, myoclonus, myokymia, restless leg syndrome, footdrop, dysfunctional reflexes, paraesthesia, anaesthesia, neuralgia, neuropathic and neurogenic pain, l'hermitte's, proprioceptive dysfunction, trigeminal neuralgia, ataxia, intention tremor, dysmetria, vestibular ataxia, vertigo, speech ataxia, dystonia, dysdiadochokinesia, frequent micturation, bladder spasticity, flaccid bladder, detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia, erectile dysfunction, anorgasmy, frigidity, constipation, fecal urgency, fecal incontinence, depression, cognitive dysfunction, dementia, mood swings, emotional lability, euphoria, bipolar syndrome, anxiety, aphasia, dysphasia, fatigue, uhthoff's symptom, gastroesophageal reflux, and sleeping disorders.\n\n\nOsteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease. It is characterized by the breakdown of cartilage in the joint, thus causing bones to rub against each other, causing pain and loss of movement. An hK1 binding protein can be used to ameliorate or prevent at least one symptom of osteoarthritis. An hK1 binding protein can be administered in conjunction with another agent for treating osteoarthritis, such as a corticosteroid or a NSAID.\n\n\nAngiogenesis-Associated and Neoplastic Disorders\n\n\nIn one embodiment, hK1 binding proteins can be administered to a subject to modulate angiogenesis or other processes associated with neoplasia and tumor growth. hK1 binding proteins, particularly ones that inhibit hK1 enzymatic activity, may be used to block tumor angiogenesis and/or cancer cell invasion and metastasis. hK1 inhibitor antibodies are potent and selective inhibitors, and thus are ideal agents for tumor therapy.\n\n\nFor example, an hK1 binding protein can be used to reduce angiogenesis (e.g., uncontrolled or unwanted angiogenesis)—such as angiogenesis associated with vascular malformations and cardiovascular disorders (e.g., atherosclerosis, restenosis and arteriovenous malformations), chronic inflammatory diseases (e.g., diabetes mellitus, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis), aberrant wound repairs (e.g., those that are observed following excimer laser eye surgery), circulatory disorders (e.g., Raynaud's phenomenon), crest syndromes (e.g., calcinosis, esophageal and dyomotiloty), dermatological disorders (e.g., Port-wine stains, arterial ulcers, systemic vasculitis and scleroderma), or ocular disorders (e.g., blindness caused by neovascular disease, neovascular glaucoma, corneal neovascularization, trachoma, diabetic retinopathy and myopic degeneration). See, e.g., Carmeliet and Jain, 2000\n, Nature, \n407: 249-257.\n\n\nIn particular, an HK1 binding protein can be used to reduce angiogenesis associated with neoplasia, e.g., cancer and tumor growth, e.g., growth of a benign, malignant, or metastatic tumor.\n\n\nExamples of cancerous disorders include, but are not limited to, solid tumors, soft tissue tumors, and metastatic lesions. Examples include sarcomas, adenocarcinomas, and carcinomas, of the various organ systems, such as those affecting lung, breast, lymphoid, gastrointestinal (e.g., colon), and genitourinary tract (e.g., renal, urothelial cells), pharynx, prostate, ovary as well as adenocarcinomas which include malignancies such as most colon cancers, rectal cancer, renal-cell carcinoma, liver cancer, non-small cell carcinoma of the lung, pharynx, cancer of the small intestine, cancer of the esophagus and others.\n\n\nExemplary solid tumors that can be treated include: fibrosarcoma, myxosarcoma, liposarcoma, chondrosarcoma, osteogenic sarcoma, chordoma, angiosarcoma, endotheliosarcoma, lymphangiosarcoma, lymphangioendotheliosarcoma, synovioma, mesothelioma, Ewing's tumor, leiomyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, colon carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, sweat gland carcinoma, sebaceous gland carcinoma, papillary carcinoma, papillary adenocarcinomas, cystadenocarcinoma, medullary carcinoma, bronchogenic carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, hepatoma, bile duct carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, seminoma, embryonal carcinoma, Wilms' tumor, cervical cancer, testicular tumor, lung carcinoma, small cell lung carcinoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, bladder carcinoma, epithelial carcinoma, glioma, astrocytoma, medulloblastoma, craniopharyngioma, ependymoma, pinealoma, hemangioblastoma, acoustic neuroma, oligodendroglioma, meningioma, melanoma, neuroblastoma, and retinoblastoma.\n\n\nThe hK1 binding protein can also be used to treat a carcinoma, e.g., a malignancy of epithelial or endocrine tissues including respiratory system carcinomas, gastrointestinal system carcinomas, genitourinary system carcinomas, testicular carcinomas, breast carcinomas, prostatic carcinomas, endocrine system carcinomas, and melanomas. Exemplary carcinomas include adenocarcinoma, carcinomas of tissue of the cervix, lung, prostate, breast, head and neck, colon and ovary.\n\n\nThe hK1 binding protein can also be used to treat sarcomas, e.g., malignant tumors of mesenchymal derivation.\n\n\nThe method can also be used to inhibit the proliferation of hyperplastic/neoplastic cells of hematopoietic origin, e.g., arising from myeloid, lymphoid or erythroid lineages, or precursor cells thereof. For instance, the method can be used totreat various myeloid disorders including acute promyeloid leukemia (APML), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) (reviewed in Vaickus, L., 1991, \nCrit. Rev. in Oncol./Hemotol. \n11:267-297). Lymphoid malignancies which may be treated by the subject method include, but are not limited to acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), which includes B-lineage ALL and T-lineage ALL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL), hairy cell leukemia (HLL) and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM). Additional forms of malignant lymphomas include, but are not limited to, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and variants thereof, peripheral T-cell lymphomas, adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL), cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), large granular lymphocytic leukemia (LGF) and Hodgkin's disease.\n\n\nAn hK1 binding protein can be administered in combination with another agent for treating a neoplastic and/or metastatic disorder. Examples of such other agents include:\n\n\n(i) other antiangiogenic agents (for example, linomide, inhibitors of integrin α\nv\nβ\n3 \nfunction, angiostatin, razoxane);\n\n\n(ii) cytostatic agents such as antiestrogens (for example tamoxifen, toremifene, raloxifene, droloxifene, iodoxifene), progestogens (for example megestrol acetate), aromatase inhibitors (for example anastrozole, letrozole, borazole, exemestane), antihormones, antiprogestogens, antiandrogens (for example flutamide, nilutamide, bicalutamide, cyproterone acetate), LHRH agonists and antagonists (for example gosereline acetate, leuprolide), inhibitors of testosterone 5.alpha.-dihydroreductase (for example finasteride), farnesyltransferase inhibitors, anti-invasion agents (for example metalloproteinase inhibitors like marimastat and inhibitors of urokinase plasminogen activator receptor function) and inhibitors of growth factor function, (such growth factors include for example EGF, FGF, platelet derived growth factor and hepatocyte growth factor such inhibitors include growth factor antibodies, growth factor receptor antibodies such as AVASTIN® (bevacizumab) and ERBITUX® (cetuximab); tyrosine kinase inhibitors and serine/threonine kinase inhibitors); and\n\n\n(iii) antiproliferative/antineoplastic drugs and combinations thereof, as used in medical oncology, such as antimetabolites (for example antifolates like methotrexate, fluoropyrimidines like 5-fluorouracil, purine and adenosine analogues, cytosine arabinoside); Intercalating antitumour antibiotics (for example anthracyclines like doxorubicin, daunomycin, epirubicin and idarubicin, mitomycin-C, dactinomycin, mithramycin); platinum derivatives (for example cisplatin, carboplatin); alkylating agents (for example nitrogen mustard, melphalan, chlorambucil, busulphan, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide nitrosoureas, thiotepa; antimitotic agents (for example vinca alkaloids like vincristine and taxoids like TAXOL® (paclitaxel), TAXOTERE® (docetaxel) and newer microbtubule agents such as epothilone analogs, discodermolide analogs, and eleutherobin analogs); topoisomerase inhibitors (for example epipodophyllotoxins like etoposide and teniposide, amsacrine, topotecan); cell cycle inhibitors (for example flavopyridols); biological response modifiers and proteasome inhibitors such as VELCADE® (bortezomib).\n\n\nExemplary Modulators of VEGF Class Growth Factors\n\n\nA variety of agents can be used to modulate activity of VEGF class growth factors, e.g., to modulate VEGF activity (for example, by modulating activity the protein itself, its receptor, or other signalling components). Such agents can be administered in combination with a hK1 binding protein to modulate angiogenesis and treat a neoplastic and/or metastatic disorder.\n\n\nAgents can be small molecule inhibitors (e.g., compounds that do not include a peptide bond and/or compounds that are smaller than 700 Daltons molecular weight). Other agents include compounds, e.g., small molecule compounds or proteins, that bind to VEGF, VEGF-C, or receptors thereof. Still other agents modulate expression or activity of VEGF, VEGF-C, or receptors thereof.\n\n\nExemplary agents include the following:\n\n\nBevacizumab (AVASTIN®) is an antibody that binds to VEGF. Bevacizumab has been approved for the treatment of certain cancers. US 2004-0133357 describes additional antibodies that can inhibit VEGF.\n\n\nUS2003-0120038 describes soluble VEGF-receptor fragments that can have inhibitory activity. 2004-0054143 describes a small peptide fragment of VEGF which has inhibitory activity.\n\n\nA number of small molecule inhibitors of VEGF activity are known. 2004-0147449 describes VEGF-R inhibitors, including a class of compounds exemplified by 4-Chlorophenyl)[4-(4-pyridylmethyl)-phthalazin-1-yl]ammonium hydrogen succinate.\n\n\nSU5416 (semaxanib) is a small molecule inhibitor of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor-2 and KIT receptor tyrosine kinases. See, e.g., Heymach et al. Clin Cancer Res. 2004 Sep. 1; 10(17):5732-40. SU11248 is another exemplary inhibitor. See, e.g., Mendel (2003) Clin Cancer Res. 9(1):327-37.\n\n\n4-[4-(1-Amino-1-methylethyl)phenyl]-2-[4-(2-morpholin-4-yl-ethyl)phenylamino]pyrimidine-5-carbonitrile (JNJ-17029259) and related compounds in the structural class of 5-cyanopyrimidines are orally available, selective, nanomolar inhibitors of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGF-R2) and other tyrosine kinases involved in angiogenesis, such as platelet-derived growth factor receptor, fibroblast growth factor receptor, VEGF-R1, and VEGF-R3. At nanomolar levels, JNJ-17029259 can inhibit proliferation/migration, the formation of vascular sprouting in the rat aortic ring model of angiogenesis, and the development of new veins and arteries in the chorioallantoic membrane assay. See, e.g., Emanuel et al. (2004) Mol Pharmacol. 2004 September; 66(3):635-47.\n\n\nStill another small molecule inhibitor is ZD6474, which inhibits VEGF-R2 tyrosine kinase activity, but with additional inhibitory effects on other growth factors. See, e.g., Sandstrom et al. British Journal of Cancer advance online publication, 10 Aug. 2004; doi:10.1038/sj.bjc.6602108 www.bjcancer.com\n\n\nPTK787/ZK 222584 is another small molecule inhibitor VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity. (see, e.g., Thomas et al. (2003) Semin Oncol. 2003 June; 30(3 Suppl 6):32-8). Mohammadi et al. (1998) EMBO Journal Vol. 17, pp. 5896-5904, 1998 describe a molecule of the pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine class, designated PD 173074, that selectively inhibits the tyrosine kinase activities of the FGF and VEGF receptors. Administration of PD 173074 in mice can effectively block angiogenesis with no apparent toxicity.\n\n\nUS 2002-0165174 describes oligonucleotides that inhibit VEGF. Antisense oligonucleotide can be used to lower VEGF and VEGF-C levels. Such oligonucleotides can reduce cancer cell growth, e.g., mesothelioma cell growth. Antibodies to VEGF receptors (VEGFR-2) and VEGF-C (VEGFR-3) have also been observed to slowed cancer cell growth. US 2004-0138163 describes siRNAs that can inhibit VEGF. Inhibitors nucleic acids such as anti-sense oligonucleotides, siRNAs, and ribozymes can be used to modulate expression of VEGF, VEGF-C, or receptors thereof. See, e.g., Int J Cancer 2003 May 1; 104(5): 603-10.\n\n\nOther methods include killing or inhibiting cells that produce VEGF. A diphtheria toxin-VEGF fusion protein (DT-VEGF), which is highly toxic to cells that express VEGF, was inhibit proliferation mesothelioma cells. See, e.g., Blood 2001 Sep. 15; 98(6): 1904-13.\n\n\nInhibitors of VEGF class molecules are also reviewed, e.g., in Verheul et al. (2003) Drugs Today (Barc). 2003; 39 Suppl C:81-93.\n\n\nInhalation\n\n\nA composition that includes an hK1 binding antibody can be formulated for inhalation or other mode of pulmonary delivery. Accordingly, the compounds described herein can be administered by inhalation to pulmonary tissue. The term “pulmonary tissue” as used herein refers to any tissue of the respiratory tract and includes both the upper and lower respiratory tract, except where otherwise indicated. An hK1 binding antibody can be administered in combination with one or more of the existing modalities for treating pulmonary diseases.\n\n\nIn one example, the compound is formulated for a nebulizer. In one embodiment, the compound can be stored in a lyophilized form (e.g., at room temperature) and reconstituted in solution prior to inhalation.\n\n\nIt is also possible to formulate the compound for inhalation using a medical device, e.g., an inhaler. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,102,035 (a powder inhaler) and U.S. Pat. No. 6,012,454 (a dry powder inhaler). The inhaler can include separate compartments for the active compound at a pH suitable for storage and another compartment for a neutralizing buffer and a mechanism for combining the compound with a neutralizing buffer immediately prior to atomization. In one embodiment, the inhaler is a metered dose inhaler.\n\n\nThe three common systems used to deliver drugs locally to the pulmonary air passages include dry powder inhalers (DPIs), metered dose inhalers (MDIs) and nebulizers. MDIs, the most popular method of inhalation administration, may be used to deliver medicaments in a solubilized form or as a dispersion. Typically MDIs comprise a Freon or other relatively high vapor pressure propellant that forces aerosolized medication into the respiratory tract upon activation of the device. Unlike MDIs, DPIs generally rely entirely on the inspiratory efforts of the patient to introduce a medicament in a dry powder form to the lungs. Nebulizers form a medicament aerosol to be inhaled by imparting energy to a liquid solution. Direct pulmonary delivery of drugs during liquid ventilation or pulmonary lavage using a fluorochemical medium has also been explored. These and other methods can be used to deliver an hK1 binding antibody. In one embodiment, the hK1 binding antibody is associated with a polymer, e.g., a polymer that stabilizes or increases half-life of the compound.\n\n\nFor example, for administration by inhalation, an hK1 binding antibody is delivered in the form of an aerosol spray from pressured container or dispenser which contains a suitable propellant or a nebulizer. The compound may be in the form of a dry particle or as a liquid. Particles that include the compound can be prepared, e.g., by spray drying, by drying an aqueous solution of the hK1 binding antibody with a charge neutralizing agent and then creating particles from the dried powder or by drying an aqueous solution in an organic modifier and then creating particles from the dried powder.\n\n\nThe compound may be conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from pressurized packs or a nebulizer, with the use of a suitable propellant, e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a powder mix of an hK1 binding antibody and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch, if the particle is a formulated particle. In addition to the formulated or unformulated compound, other materials such as 100% DPPC or other surfactants can be mixed with the hK1 binding antibody to promote the delivery and dispersion of formulated or unformulated compound. Methods of preparing dry particles are described, for example, in PCT Publication WO 02/32406.\n\n\nAn hK1 binding antibody can be formulated for aerosol delivery, e.g., as dry aerosol particles, such that when administered it can be rapidly absorbed and can produce a rapid local or systemic therapeutic result. Administration can be tailored to provide detectable activity within 2 minutes, 5 minutes, 1 hour, or 3 hours of administration. In some embodiments, the peak activity can be achieved even more quickly, e.g., within one half hour or even within ten minutes. An hK1 binding antibody can be formulated for longer biological half-life (e.g., by association with a polymer such as PEG) can be used as an alternative to other modes of administration, e.g., such that the compound enters circulation from the lung and is distributed to other organs or to a particular target organ.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the hK1 binding antibody is delivered in an amount such that at least 5% of the mass of the polypeptide is delivered to the lower respiratory tract or the deep lung. Deep lung has an extremely rich capillary network. The respiratory membrane separating capillary lumen from the alveolar air space is very thin (≦6 μm) and extremely permeable. In addition, the liquid layer lining the alveolar surface is rich in lung surfactants. In other embodiments, at least 2%, 3%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, or 80% of the composition of an hK1 binding antibody is delivered to the lower respiratory tract or to the deep lung. Delivery to either or both of these tissues results in efficient absorption of the compound and high bioavailability. In one embodiment, the compound is provided in a metered dose using, e.g., an inhaler or nebulizer. For example, the compound is delivered in a dosage unit form of at least about 0.02, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 5, 10, 20, 40, or 50 mg/puff or more.\n\n\nThe percent bioavailability can be calculated as follows: the percent bioavailability=(AUC\nnon-invasive\n/AUC\ni.v. or s.c.\n)×(dose\ni.v. or s.c.\n/dose\nnon-invasive\n)×100.\n\n\nAlthough not necessary, delivery enhancers such as surfactants can be used to further enhance pulmonary delivery. A “surfactant” as used herein refers to a compound having a hydrophilic and lipophilic moiety, which promotes absorption of a drug by interacting with an interface between two immiscible phases. Surfactants are useful in the dry particles for several reasons, e.g., reduction of particle agglomeration, reduction of macrophage phagocytosis, etc. When coupled with lung surfactant, a more efficient absorption of the compound can be achieved because surfactants, such as DPPC, will greatly facilitate diffusion of the compound. Surfactants are well known in the art and include but are not limited to phosphoglycerides, e.g., phosphatidylcholines, L-alpha-phosphatidylcholine dipalmitoyl (DPPC) and diphosphatidyl glycerol (DPPG); hexadecanol; fatty acids; polyethylene glycol (PEG); polyoxyethylene-9-; auryl ether; palmitic acid; oleic acid; sorbitan trioleate (Span 85); glycocholate; surfactin; poloxomer; sorbitan fatty acid ester; sorbitan trioleate; tyloxapol; and phospholipids.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the surfactants for use in the compositions, including the concentrates and diluted compositions, provided herein are high-HLB (hydrophilic-lipophilic balance) surfactants. Such high-HLB surfactants generally have an HLB greater than about 10. The HLB is a measure on an arbitrary scale of the polarity of a surfactant or mixture of surfactants. In one embodiment, the compositions provided herein contain from about 3% to about 85% by weight of a high-HLB surfactant In one embodiment, the high-HLB surfactant is an ethoxylated derivative of vitamin E such as \ntocopheryl polyethylene glycol\n 1000 succinate (TPGS). TPGS has an HLB between about 15 and 19. See, e.g., US 2004-0023935\n\n\nStabilization and Retention\n\n\nIn one embodiment, an hK1 binding antibody is physically associated with a moiety that improves its stabilization and/or retention in circulation, e.g., in blood, serum, lymph, bronchoalveolar lavage, or other tissues, e.g., by at least 1.5, 2, 5, 10, or 50 fold.\n\n\nFor example, an hK1 binding antibody can be associated with a polymer, e.g., a substantially non-antigenic polymers, such as polyalkylene oxides or polyethylene oxides. Suitable polymers will vary substantially by weight. Polymers having molecular number average weights ranging from about 200 to about 35,000 (or about 1,000 to about 15,000, and 2,000 to about 12,500) can be used.\n\n\nFor example, an hK1 binding antibody can be conjugated to a water soluble polymer, e.g., hydrophilic polyvinyl polymers, e.g. polyvinylalcohol and polyvinylpyrrolidone. A non-limiting list of such polymers include polyalkylene oxide homopolymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) or polypropylene glycols, polyoxyethylenated polyols, copolymers thereof and block copolymers thereof, provided that the water solubility of the block copolymers is maintained. Additional useful polymers include polyoxyalkylenes such as polyoxyethylene, polyoxypropylene, and block copolymers of polyoxyethylene and polyoxypropylene (Pluronics); polymethacrylates; carbomers; branched or unbranched polysaccharides which comprise the saccharide monomers D-mannose, D- and L-galactose, fucose, fructose, D-xylose, L-arabinose, D-glucuronic acid, sialic acid, D-galacturonic acid, D-mannuronic acid (e.g. polymannuronic acid, or alginic acid), D-glucosamine, D-galactosamine, D-glucose and neuraminic acid including homopolysaccharides and heteropolysaccharides such as lactose, amylopectin, starch, hydroxyethyl starch, amylose, dextrane sulfate, dextran, dextrins, glycogen, or the polysaccharide subunit of acid mucopolysaccharides, e.g. hyaluronic acid; polymers of sugar alcohols such as polysorbitol and polymannitol; heparin or heparon.\n\n\nOther compounds can also be attached to the same polymer, e.g., a cytotoxin, a label, or another targeting agent, e.g., another hK1 binding antibody or an unrelated ligand. Mono-activated, alkoxy-terminated polyalkylene oxides (PAO's), e.g., monomethoxy-terminated polyethylene glycols (mPEG's); C\n1-4 \nalkyl-terminated polymers; and bis-activated polyethylene oxides (glycols) can be used for crosslinking. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,951,974\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the polymer prior to cross-linking to the ligand need not be, but preferably is, water soluble. Generally, after crosslinking, the product is water soluble, e.g., exhibits a water solubility of at least about 0.01 mg/ml, and more preferably at least about 0.1 mg/ml, and still more preferably at least about 1 mg/ml. In addition, the polymer should not be highly immunogenic in the conjugate form, nor should it possess viscosity that is incompatible with intravenous infusion, aerosolization, or injection if the conjugate is intended to be administered by such routes.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the polymer contains only a single group which is reactive. This helps to avoid cross-linking of ligand molecules to one another. However, it is within the scope herein to maximize reaction conditions to reduce cross-linking between ligand molecules, or to purify the reaction products through gel filtration or ion exchange chromatography to recover substantially homogenous derivatives. In other embodiments, the polymer contains two or more reactive groups for the purpose of linking multiple ligands to the polymer backbone. Again, gel filtration or ion exchange chromatography can be used to recover the desired derivative in substantially homogeneous form.\n\n\nThe molecular weight of the polymer can range up to about 500,000 D, and preferably is at least about 20,000 D, or at least about 30,000 D, or at least about 40,000 D. The molecular weight chosen can depend upon the effective size of the conjugate to be achieved, the nature (e.g. structure, such as linear or branched) of the polymer, and the degree of derivatization.\n\n\nA covalent bond can be used to attach an hK1 binding antibody to a polymer, for example, crosslinking to the N-terminal amino group of the ligand and epsilon amino groups found on lysine residues of the ligand, as well as other amino, imino, carboxyl, sulfhydryl, hydroxyl or other hydrophilic groups. The polymer may be covalently bonded directly to the hK1 binding antibody without the use of a multifunctional (ordinarily bifunctional) crosslinking agent. Covalent binding to amino groups is accomplished by known chemistries based upon cyanuric chloride, carbonyl diimidazole, aldehyde reactive groups (PEG alkoxide plus diethyl acetyl of bromoacetaldehyde; PEG plus DMSO and acetic anhydride, or PEG chloride plus the phenoxide of 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, activated succinimidyl esters, activated dithiocarbonate PEG, 2,4,5-trichlorophenylcloroformate or P-nitrophenylcloroformate activated PEG.) Carboxyl groups can be derivatized by coupling PEG-amine using carbodiimide. Sulfhydryl groups can be derivatized by coupling to maleimido-substituted PEG (e.g. alkoxy-PEG amine plus sulfosuccinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate) WO 97/10847 or PEG-maleimide commercially available from Shearwater Polymers, Inc., Huntsville, Ala.). Alternatively, free amino groups on the ligand (e.g. epsilon amino groups on lysine residues) can be thiolated with 2-imino-thiolane (Traut's reagent) and then coupled to maleimide-containing derivatives of PEG, e.g., as described in Pedley et al., Br. J. Cancer, 70: 1126-1130 (1994).\n\n\nFunctionalized PEG polymers that can be attached to an hK1 binding antibody are available, e.g., from Shearwater Polymers, Inc. (Huntsville, Ala.). Such commercially available PEG derivatives include, e.g., amino-PEG, PEG amino acid esters, PEG-hydrazide, PEG-thiol, PEG-succinate, carboxymethylated PEG, PEG-propionic acid, PEG amino acids, PEG succinimidyl succinate, PEG succinimidyl propionate, succinimidyl ester of carboxymethylated PEG, succinimidyl carbonate of PEG, succinimidyl esters of amino acid PEGs, PEG-oxycarbonylimidazole, PEG-nitrophenyl carbonate, PEG tresylate, PEG-glycidyl ether, PEG-aldehyde, PEG vinylsulfone, PEG-maleimide, PEG-orthopyridyl-disulfide, heterofunctional PEGs, PEG vinyl derivatives, PEG silanes, and PEG phospholides. The reaction conditions for coupling these PEG derivatives may vary depending on the hK1 binding antibody, the desired degree of PEGylation, and the PEG derivative utilized. Some factors involved in the choice of PEG derivatives include: the desired point of attachment (such as lysine or cysteine R-groups), hydrolytic stability and reactivity of the derivatives, stability, toxicity and antigenicity of the linkage, suitability for analysis, etc. Specific instructions for the use of any particular derivative are available from the manufacturer.\n\n\nThe conjugates of an hK1 binding antibody and a polymer can be separated from the unreacted starting materials, e.g., by gel filtration or ion exchange chromatography, e.g., HPLC. Heterologous species of the conjugates are purified from one another in the same fashion. Resolution of different species (e.g. containing one or two PEG residues) is also possible due to the difference in the ionic properties of the unreacted amino acids. See, e.g., WO 96/34015.\n\n\nEXAMPLE\n\n\nThe following is one exemplary strategy for identifying hK1 binding proteins, particularly hK1 inhibitors.\n\n\n1) KLK1 cDNA\n\n\nKLK1 cDNA was subcloned into expression vectors for expression in mammalian cells, \nE. coli\n, and \nP. pastoris\n. The sequence of the subcloned material was confirmed by DNA sequencing.\n\n\n2) Protein Expression in \nP. pastoris \n \n\n\n \nP. pastoris \nwere transformed with the above subcloned cDNA and clones were selected for expression of hK1 as assessed by protein gel electrophoresis and enzyme activity measurements. Optimized expression conditions were determined and protein was induced in a large \nP. pastoris \nculture volume (2 L).\n\n\n3) Protein Purification\n\n\nhK1 was purified according to Chan et al (1998) \nProtein Expr Purif, \n12(3): p. 361-70.\n\n\n4) Phage Display Selection and Screening\n\n\nBinders to recombinant hK1 have been selected from Fab phage display libraries.\n\n\nTwo strategies were employed to favor the selection of antibodies that bind at the active site of the hK1 enzyme (Figure). Active site binders compete with enzyme substrate for binding to hK1 and can inhibit hK1 proteolytic activity. Both phage display selection strategies employed the use of hK1 immobilized on beads. Beads were prepared by mixing 5 μg of biotinylated hK1 with 5 mg streptavidin coated paramagnetic beads (Dynal) in a total volume of 500 μL with phosphate buffer saline and 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) and incubating the mixture over night at 4° C. The mixture was then washed 5 times with PBST, 1 μM free biotin was added, then washed again 5 times with PBST, and finally blocked for 1 hour with 2% nonfat dry milk in PBST. The immobilization procedure resulted in complete capture of the biotinylated hK1 and yielded immobilized hK1 that was enzymatically active.\n\n\nIn the first selection strategy, phage (titer=1×10\n13 \npfu) were incubated for minutes with 0.25 mL of immobilized hK1 beads in PBST and a total volume of 1 mL. Phage that bound immobilized hK1 were extracted using a magnetic device and nonspecific phage were eluted by 12 wash cycles with PBST on an automated plate washer (Selection 1). Phage were then eluted from the extracted beads by incubation of 25 μM aprotinin, an active site inhibitor of hK1, for 2 hours, in order to obtain phage eluted from the active site of hK1. The phage eluted by aprotinin and the phage that remained on the beads were amplified according to standard procedures and were each adjusted to a titer of 1×10\n11 \npfu and then separately used as input phage for the next and final round of selection of this strategy (Round II).\n\n\nIn Round II, the two phage populations (aka two “sets”, one eluted with aprotinin, the other remaining bound after aprotinin elution) were separately added to 0.05 mL of immobilized hK1 beads, brought to a total volume of 1 mL with PBST and allowed to incubate for 5 minutes before 12 wash cycles were performed. The two “sets” from Round II were then subjected to elution with 25 μM aprotinin for 2 hours to yield a total of 4 phage populations (aka “pools”) for screening by ELISA for binding to hK1 where \nPool\n 1 was derived from the aprotinin elution of Round I and the aprotinin elution of Round II, \nPool\n 2 was derived from the aprotinin elution of Round I and the phage that remained on the beads in Round II, \nPool\n 3 was derived from the phage that remained on the beads in \nround\n 1 and those that were eluted by aprotinin in Round II, and \nPool\n 4 was derived from the phage that remained on the beads in \nround\n 1 and those that remained on the beads in Round II.\n\n\nA different strategy was invoked in \nSelection\n 2 in which phage (titer=1×10\n13 \npfu) were first depleted of non-active site hK1 binders by incubating the phage three times for 1 hour with an immobilized hK1-aprotinin complex prepared by adding 25 μM aprotinin to 0.25 mL immobilized hK1 beads and brought to a total volume of 1 mL with PBST. The depleted phage were then added to 0.25 mL immobilized hK1 beads in 1 mL for 5 minutes and 12 wash cycles with PBST were performed. The phage that remained on the beads were then amplified, adjusted to a titer of 1×10\n11 \npfu and used as input for \nRound\n 2. \n \nRound\n \n 2 and 3 were performed as described for \nround\n 1 where each round had an initial depletion step against the hK1-aprotinin complex before selection against 0.25 mL immobilized hK1 beads. This selection strategy produced one phage population (Pool 5) that was screened by ELISA for binders to hK1.\n\n\nPhage from the above five pools were assayed for their ability to bind hK1 by a soluble Fab ELISA. Prior to conducting this ELISA it was necessary to modify the phagemid DNA to permit the Fabs to be expressed without a gene III fusion. This DNA modification was done by first preparing phagemid DNA of each the five pools in \nE. coli \nTG1 cells, then performing a double DNA digest using the MluI restriction enzyme will release the DNA coding for the geneIII stump fragment. After gel purification, the vector was re-ligated (pMID21 vector without gene III stump) and electroporated into \nE. coli \nTG1 cells. Transformants were plated and colonies were picked and grown in 100 \nμL\n 2×YT in 96-well plates containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin and 0.1% glucose for about 3 hours at 30° C. Fabs were expressed upon addition of 1 mM Isopropylthio-β-galactoside (IPTG) for 16 hours at 30° C. Plates were then spun at 600 g for 10 min and 50 μL supernatant was used for the ELISA.\n\n\nThe soluble Fab ELISA was performed by first coating wells of a 96-well plate with 2 μg/mL streptavidin in 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6, overnight at 4° C. Following washing with PBST and blocking with 1% \nbovine serum albumin\n 10 ng of biotinylated hK1 was added and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Free hK1 was then removed by 5 washes with PBST. Supernatant (50 μL) from the above described Fab expression is added to the hK1 immobilized on the plate and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Unbound Fab is then removed by 7 washes with PBST and 100 μL of horse radish peroxidase conjugated anti-Fab antibody is added to the wells. Free secondary antibody is removed by seven washes with PBST and 100 μL of a colorimetric peroxidase substrate (3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine/hydrogen peroxide) is added to permit the detection of bound Fab by an increase in absorbance at 630 nm. Using this ELISA 960 expressed Fabs were analyzed for each of the 5 selection pools for a total of 4800 Fabs analyzed.\n\n\n5) DNA Sequencing\n\n\n1152 ELISA positive soluble Fabs were DNA sequenced from which 335 Fabs had distinct heavy chains.\n\n\n6) Determination of Fab Binding Affinity and Enzyme Inhibition Potency\n\n\nThe binding affinity of 335 Fabs was determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Binding constants in the range of 0.4 to greater than 100 nM were obtained (Table 1). The inhibition of enzyme activity was first screened for all 335 Fabs at a single Fab concentration of 120 nM, followed by the determination of IC50 values for a select number of Fabs (Table 1). Whether or not the Fabs for which no IC50 has been determined may or may not be enzyme inhibitors. The inhibitors may be further evaluated to determine their ability to inhibit bronchial tissue kallikrein activity present in bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid.\n\n\nIn addition, twenty four of the highest affinity Fabs found to inhibit hK1 were examined in further detail. An asterisk is used to indicate these Fabs in Table 1. These Fabs were initially identified using a combination of high-throughput SPR and enzyme inhibition screening using small quantities of Fabs purified using a novel high throughput method. Purification of larger quantities of these 24 Fabs using standard antibody purification methods permits a more accurate and detailed examination of their biochemical properties. Steady state enzyme inhibition assays were performed in black, 96 well, round bottomed microplates in a total volume of 100 μL of Reaction Buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% PEG, 0.1% Triton X-100) containing 5 nM hK1, a varied concentration of Fab and 100 μM Pro-Phe-Arg-AMC substrate. Before the addition of substrate to initiate the reaction, the hK1 and Fab were incubate in the well of the assay plate for 1 hour at 30° C. The substrate was then added and the reaction was monitored using a fluorescence plate reader (Gemini XS, Molecular Devices) using an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 mm. Initial rates of substrate hydrolysis were plotted against inhibitor concentration and fit to the standard hyperbolic equation for enzyme inhibition by nonlinear regression to provide IC\n50 \nestimates.\n\n\nSpecific exemplary antibodies are designated in the form of M0103-A01. All the names begin “M0”, hence the names are sometimes shortened by removal of the lead “M0”. The antibody name “103-A01” refers to the same antibody as does “M0103-A01”. The HC of M0103-A01 is named HC-103-A01 and the LC is named LC-103-A01.\n\n\n7) Mouse Model of Airway Inflammation Studies\n\n\nFab's can be evaluated for ability to modulate airway inflammation in a mouse model of asthma, e.g., as described in Kips et al., (2003) “Murine models of asthma” Eur. Respir. J. 22, 374-382. Fabs may also be reformatted as IgG molecules and evaluated using one or more assays described herein.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBinding

This antibody was found to inhibit both mK1 and hK1.\n\n\nSome of the exemplary antibodies described herein have sequence inter-relationships. Two antibodies that share LC, HC CDR3, or HC CDR1 and HC CDR2 are likely to bind to approximately the same site on hK1. A common HC CDR3 is especially indicative of a shared binding site. Thus, the inhibitory properties of two antibodies that share the named areas of sequence are likely to be similar. In particular, if one antibody is an inhibitor of hK1, then any antibody that shares the sequence of the first antibody is likely to also be an inhibitor.

Thus, we could change the lambda constant region to alter the expression or pharmacokinetics without changing the binding properties (such as inhibition of hK1).\n\n\nProtease Specificity of Selected Inhibitors\n\n\nSelected antibodies were tested for their ability to inhibit other proteases. Shown in Table 2 are the results of \ntesting\n 3 antibodies against 13 serine proteases besides hK1. It is evident that at the maximum tested concentration of antibody (1 μM) we observed no inhibition of any other proteases.\n\n\nProcedure. Assays were performed in black, 96 well, round bottomed microplates in a total volume of 100 μL. The enzyme, substrate, buffer and experimental conditions are listed in Tables 3 and 4. Enzyme and Fab inhibitor were incubated in the dark at room temperature for 1 hour prior to the addition of the indicated amount of substrate. The rate of enzymatic substrate hydrolysis was then monitored using the Spectramax Gemini XS fluorescence plate reader using the wavelengths listed in Table 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecificity of hK1 Antibody Inhibitors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nK\ni \n(nM)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtease\n\n\nDX-2300\n\n\nM0093-F09\n\n\nM0137-E01\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhK1\n\n\n0.039-0.06\n\n\n1.9\n\n\n0.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhK2\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhK3\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhK4\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhK5\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhK8\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman plasma\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkallikrein\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman plasmin\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman urokinase\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman trypsin\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman elastase\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman activated\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprotein kinase C\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman chymotrypsin\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman thrombin\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n>1000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of Assay Conditions Used in Protease Specificity Measurements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n[S]\n\n\n[E]\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnzyme\n\n\nSubstrate\n\n\n(μM)\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\nBuffer\n\n\nλ Ex\n\n\nλ Em\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecombinant ()\n\n\nPro-Phe-Arg-AMC\n\n\n100\n\n\n5\n\n\nKAL\n\n\n360\n\n\n460\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKallikrein\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman Urinary Kallikrein\n\n\nPro-Phe-Arg-AMC\n\n\n100\n\n\n5\n\n\nKAL\n\n\n360\n\n\n460\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1(hK1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman Tissue Kallikrein 2\n\n\nPro-Phe-Arg-AMC\n\n\n100\n\n\n5\n\n\nKAL\n\n\n360\n\n\n460\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(hK2)Pichia\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlasma Kallikrein\n\n\nPro-Phe-Arg-AMC\n\n\n100\n\n\n5\n\n\nKAL\n\n\n360\n\n\n460\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman Tissue Kallikrein 3\n\n\nMu-His-Ser-Ser-Lys-Leu-Gln-\n\n\n100\n\n\n20\n\n\nPSA\n\n\n400\n\n\n505\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(hK3, PSA)\n\n\nAFC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman Tissue Kallikrein 4\n\n\nBoc-Val-Pro-Arg-AMC\n\n\n100\n\n\n10\n\n\nKAL\n\n\n380\n\n\n460\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(hK4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman Tissue Kallikrein 5\n\n\nBoc-Val-Pro-Arg-AMC\n\n\n100\n\n\n20\n\n\nKAL\n\n\n380\n\n\n460\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(hK5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman Tissue Kallikrein 8\n\n\nBoc-Val-Pro-Arg-AMC\n\n\n100\n\n\n40\n\n\nKAL\n\n\n380\n\n\n460\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(hK8)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlasmin\n\n\nN-Suc-Ala-Phe-Lys-AMC\n\n\n100\n\n\n5\n\n\nPLA\n\n\n360\n\n\n460\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman Pancreatic Trypsin\n\n\nPro-Phe-Arg-AMC\n\n\n100\n\n\n5\n\n\nKAL\n\n\n360\n\n\n460\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman Neutrophil Elastase\n\n\nN-MS-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-AMC\n\n\n100\n\n\n5\n\n\nKAL\n\n\n360\n\n\n460\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChymotrypsin\n\n\nTrp-AMC\n\n\n100\n\n\n5\n\n\nPSA\n\n\n360\n\n\n460\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtein Kinase C\n\n\nBoc-Leu-Ser-Thr-Arg-AMC\n\n\n100\n\n\n5\n\n\nPKC\n\n\n360\n\n\n460\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUrokinase\n\n\nZ-Gly-Gly-Arg-AMC\n\n\n100\n\n\n5\n\n\nPSA\n\n\n360\n\n\n460\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThrombin\n\n\nBenzoyl-Phe-Val-Arg-AMC\n\n\n500\n\n\n5\n\n\nKAL\n\n\n350\n\n\n470\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuffer Components for Table 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKAL\n\n\n \nPSA\n \n \nPLA\n\n\nPKC\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n20 \nmM Tris\n \n\n\n50 mM HEPES\n\n\n50 mM HEPES\n\n\n20 mM Tris-Cl\n\n\n\n\n\n\npH 7.5\n\n\npH 7.5\n\n\npH 7.5\n\n\npH 8.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n150 \nmM NaCl\n \n\n\n100 mM NaCl,\n\n\n150 \nmM NaCl\n \n\n\n100 \nmM NaCl\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 mM EDTA\n\n\n0.2\n% BSA\n \n\n\n2 \nmM CaCl\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n1 mM CaCl\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.1% PEG\n\n\n \n\n\n0.1% Triton\n\n\n0.1% Triton\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.1% Triton X-100\n\n\n \n\n\nX-100\n\n\nX-100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffect of Selected Antibody Inhibitors on hK1 Kininogenase Activity\n\n\nSelect antibody inhibitors were examined to determine the effect on hK1 kininogenase activity. SDS-PAGE showed that all nine antibodies examined inhibited kininogenase activity of hK1 towards high molecular weight kininogen (HMWK). Intact HMWK migrates as a 100 kDa protein that is digested by hK1 to give a fragment that runs at approximately 60 kDa (\nlanes\n 1 and 2). All 9 of the hK1 inhibitors (\nlanes\n 4 through 12) that were tested prevented HMWK digestion. Experiments were performed by incubating 10 nM hK1 with 1 μM Ab for 3 hours at 37° C. prior to the addition of 0.1 mg/mL HMWK. HMWK was reacted with hK1 for 3 hours at 37° C. Non-reducing SDS-PAGE gels (10% acrylamide) were loaded with 1 μg HMWK and run according to standard procedures. \nLane\n 1 contains undigested HMWK, \nlane\n 2 contains digested HMWK, \nlane\n 3 contains molecular weight markers from Invitrogen, \nlane\n 4 contains HMWK+hK1+DX-2300, \nlane\n 5 contains HMWK+hK1+M0106-G12, \nlane\n 6 contains HMWK+hK1+M0111-C12, \nlane\n 7 contains HMWK+hK1+M0098-G05, \nlane\n 8 contains HMWK+hK1+M0137-E01, lane 9 contains HMWK+hK1+M0112-D03, \nlane\n 10 contains HMWK+hK1+M0102-H11, lane 11 contains HMWK+hK1+M0114-G06, \nlane\n 12 contains HMWK+hK1+M0098-E09.\n\n\nTowards LMWK it is evident that all 9 Fabs inhibited the extent of digestion. However, only DX-2300 (lane 4) and M0137-E01 (lane 8) appeared to completely inhibit LMWK digestion. The reactions were performed as described above for HMWK and the lanes contain the same contents as above except that LMWK is substituted for HMWK.\n\n\nEpitope Grouping of Selected hK1 Binding Antibodies\n\n\nSelected antibodies were grouped according to whether or not that recognize the same epitope on hK1 as DX-2300 using a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) approach (\nFIG. 1\n, Table 5). This type of information can lead to the discovery of matched pairs of antibodies for quantitative measurements hK1 in biological samples. This information is also valuable to compare antibodies to the lead inhibitor (DX-2300) and choose back up inhibitors that either share the same epitope or different epitopes as DX-2300. FIG. \n1\n shows two representative sensorgrams for a Fab (M0112-D07) that shares the same epitope as DX-2300 (panel A) and a Fab that binds a different epitope (panel B). The ratio of the SPR signal for the Fab following the injection of DX-2300 (R1) divided by the signal of the Fab alone (R2) provides an indication of which Fabs share the same epitope as DX-2300. Since the second inject of DX-2300 produces a R2/R1 ratio of 0.1, Fabs with R2/R1 ratios significantly greater than 0.1 indicate binding at a different epitope than DX-2300. Out of the 12 Fabs that were examined, only M0111-C12, M0137-E01 and M0139-A09 did not share the same epitope as DX-2300 (Table 5). The epitope of certain Fabs (M0109-F02 and M0098-E09) may partially overlap that of DX-2300, since an intermediate signal response was observed (Table 5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpitope Grouping By Surface Plasmon Resonance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFab\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSignal following\n\n\nFab Signal Alone\n\n\nRatio\n\n\nDX-2300\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFab\n\n\nDX-2300 (R1)\n\n\n(R2)\n\n\nR1/R2\n\n\nepitope?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM0093-F09\n\n\n5.9\n\n\n32.7\n\n\n0.18\n\n\nyes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM0111-C12\n\n\n38.8\n\n\n65.1\n\n\n0.60\n\n\nno\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM0137-E01\n\n\n20.8\n\n\n49.1\n\n\n0.42\n\n\nno\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM0109-F02\n\n\n9.5\n\n\n30.2\n\n\n0.31\n\n\npartial\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM0114-G06\n\n\n4.8\n\n\n27.5\n\n\n0.17\n\n\nyes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM0098-E09\n\n\n8.5\n\n\n34.8\n\n\n0.24\n\n\nyes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM0139-A09\n\n\n25.7\n\n\n40.0\n\n\n0.64\n\n\nno\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM0134-D07\n\n\n2.3\n\n\n14.7\n\n\n0.16\n\n\nyes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM0117-F04\n\n\n6.7\n\n\n29.7\n\n\n0.23\n\n\nyes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM0098-E09\n\n\n8.5\n\n\n29.9\n\n\n0.28\n\n\npartial\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM0136-A07\n\n\n5.0\n\n\n27.6\n\n\n0.18\n\n\nyes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM0112-D07\n\n\n3.0\n\n\n16.1\n\n\n0.19\n\n\nyes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM0131-F07\n\n\n3.8\n\n\n27.6\n\n\n0.1\n\n\nyes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(DX-2300)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMechanisms of hK1 Inhibition and K\ni \nDeterminations for Selected Inhibitors\n\n\nBecause the best antibodies discovered are tight binding inhibitors of hK1, the classical Michaelis-Menten approach to determine enzyme inhibition mechanisms does not apply. A method to determine the inhibition mechanism of a tight binding inhibitor has been described (R. A. Copeland, “Enzymes”, 2\nnd \nEdition, Wiley, Toronto, 2000). Tight binding inhibitors refer to those inhibitors with inhibition constants (K\ni \nvalues) that approach the minimum enzyme concentration that can be used to measure activity, which for hK1 is approximately 1 nM. The tight binding inhibition method requires one to measure the IC\n50 \nof the inhibitor at a range of different substrate concentrations. Under these conditions, an inhibitor that binds the enzyme in a manner that is competitive with respect to substrate will exhibit a linear increase in IC\n50 \nin response to substrate concentration. In contrast, IC\n50 \nvalues that do not vary with substrate concentration are indicate that the inhibitor binds the enzyme in a manner that is noncompetitive with respect to substrate. The binding of a noncompetitive inhibitor to an enzyme does not block the ability of substrate to bind enzyme but rather prevents the subsequent substrate hydrolysis step, presumably through a distortion of the catalytically important amino acids.\n\n\nDX-2300 exhibits a linear dependence of the IC\n50 \nvalue on substrate concentration (\nFIG. 2\n). Consequently, DX-2300 is a tight binding inhibitor that inhibits hK1 in a competitive manner, which indicates that its binding to hK1 prevent substrate binding. Knowledge of the inhibition mechanism also permits the determination of the inhibition constant (K\ni\n). DX-2300 has a K\ni \nvalue of 60 pM as a Fab and approximately 39 pM as an IgG.\n\n\nInhibition mechanisms and K\ni \nvalues were also determined for the selected backup antibodies, M0093-F09 and M0137-E01. As shown in \nFIG. 3A\n, M0093-F09 inhibits hK1 in a noncompetitive manner with a K\ni \nof 1.9 nM. \nFIG. 3B\n demonstrates that the backup antibody inhibitor M0137-E01 inhibits hK1 in a competitive manner with a K\ni \nof 0.9 nM.\n\n\nProgress Curve Inhibition Analysis of DX-2300\n\n\nThe time dependence of DX-2300 inhibition of hK1 was investigated using the progress curve method (R. A. Copeland, “Enzymes”, 2\nnd \nEdition, Wiley, Toronto, 2000). This method is used to characterize the kinetic step or steps that describe the interaction between inhibitor and enzyme. The progress curves shown in \nFIG. 4A\n demonstrate time dependent inhibition of hK1 by DX-2300 and the data obtained for each concentration of inhibitor were fit to provide exponential rate constants that describe the kinetics of the interaction between the enzyme and inhibitor. These rate constants (k\nobs \nvalues) when plotted against inhibitor concentration exhibit a hyperbolic dependence (\nFIG. 4B\n), which indicates that the initial complex between DX-2300 and hK1 undergoes an isomerization to form a new complex of even higher affinity.\n\n\nDX-2300 Inhibition of Kallikrein-Like Activity in Animal Urine\n\n\nTissue kallikrein (K1) has been previously shown to be excreted in urine. Kizuki, K., et al., \nAdv Exp Med Biol, \n1986. 198 Pt A:329-337; Takaoka, M., et al., \nBiochem Biophys Res Commun, \n1984. 122(3):1282-1288; Murthy, K. K., et al., \nArch Biochem Biophys, \n1986. 244(2):563-571; Stella, R. C., et al., Adv Exp Med Biol, 1989. 247B:195-200. Using synthetic peptide substrates the activity of K1 can be measured in urine. Often much of the excreted K1 is in the inactive proform so it is necessary to activate the enzyme with another protease such as trypsin or thermolysin. Prior to measuring the activity of K1 in the urine the activating enzyme is quenched using a specific inhibitor (soybean trypsin inhibitor for trypsin or phosphoramidon for thermolysin).\n\n\nFrom \nFIG. 5\n, it is evident that DX-2300 inhibits the kallikrein-like activity present in the urine of humans, sheep, dogs, monkeys, rabbits, and cows. However, it does not inhibit the kallikrein-like activity observed in rodents (mice, rats, guinea pigs, or hamsters) or from pig urine. The measured DX-2300 IC\n50 \nvalues for kallikrein-like activity in sheep urine and human urine are comparable at 2.9±1.6 nM and 3.0±0.6 nM, respectively (\nFIG. 6\n)\n\n\nProcedure. Animal urine was first buffered by the addition of a 1/10 volume of 1 M HEPES, pH 7.7 and centrifuged to remove solids. The supernatant (1 mL) was then activated by the addition of 50 μL trypsin agarose resin for 30 minutes at 37° C. The sample was then centrifuged to remove the trypsin agarose and any residual trypsin that may have leached from the resin was inactivated with 10 μM soybean trypsin inhibitor. The kallikrein activity towards the synthetic substrate Pro-Phe-Arg-AMC (100 μM [final]) in activated urine (9 μL) was measured in Ka1 buffer (Table 4) wells of a 96 well plate (100 μL total volume) in the presence or absence of 0.5 μM DX-2300. Activated urine was first incubated with DX-2300 for 30 minutes at 37° C. prior to the addition of substrate.\n\n\nInhibition of Kallikrein-Like Activity in Human Bronchial Alveolar Lavage\n\n\nTissue kallikrein 1 (hK1) has been shown to be elevated in the airways of asthmatic patients compared to healthy individuals as measured in bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL). Proud, D. et al. \nAm J Respir Cell Mol Biol, \n1993. 8(1):16-19; Christiansen, S. C., et al., \nAm Rev Respir Dis, \n1992. 145(4 Pt 1):900-905; Christiansen, S. C., et al., \nJ Clin Invest, \n1987. 79(1):188-197. DX-2300 was found to inhibit kallikrein-like activity in BAL from 4 different mildly asthmatic patients as measured using the synthetic substrate, Pro-Phe-Arg-AMC. (See \nFIG. 7\n) This synthetic substrate can be be hydrolyzed by other proteases in the BAL and is therefore not a selective substrate of kininogenase activity. Because DX-2300 has been shown to be a highly specific inhibitor of K1, it is unlikely to inhibit these other proteases in the BAL. Consequently, DX-2300 is not expected to completely inhibit the protease activity in BAL. The observation of a substantial amount of protease inhibition in BAL with such a specific inhibitor of K1 activity does confirm K1 activity is elevated from asthmatic patients.\n\n\nEffect of DX-2300 in Sheep Model of Asthma\n\n\nThe sheep model of asthma has been previously used to validate potential asthma drug targets and test agents. Forteza, R., et al., \nAm J Respir Crit Care Med, \n1996. 154(1):36-42; Rosen, S. D., et al., \nAm J Pathol, \n2005. 166(3):935-944; Scuri, M., et al., \nJ Appl Physiol, \n2002. 93(6): 1900-1906. In this model allergic sheep are challenged with \nAscaris suum \nantigen and measurements of pulmonary resistance provide an indication of the accompanying bronchoconstriction. As shown in \nFIG. 8A\n, DX-2300 slightly decreased early phase and inhibited the late phase bronchoconstriction by over 80%.\n\n\nMeasurements of the airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) in the sheep model of asthma also indicate efficacy in human patients. As shown in \nFIG. 9B\n, DX-2300 completely blocked the AHR that follows allergen challenge. AHR is measured according to how much carbachol, a chlolinergic agonist, is required to increase \nbronchoconstriction\n 400% above baseline (PC400). Following allergen challenge the airways are hyper-responsive to such an agonist so the amount require to induce the same level of bronchoconstriction is reduced. \nFIG. 9B\n demonstrates that DX-2300 blocked the development of AHR because the same amount of carbachol was required after challenge to reach the PC400 level of bronchoconstriction.\n\n\nAdministration of high molecular weight kininogen (HMWK), a K1 substrate, to sheep by inhalation results in an immediate bronchoconstriction, as measured by an increase in lung resistance. This increase is due to the generation of kinins by the airway kininogenase. The observation that DX-2300 inhibits HMWK-induced bronchoconstriction (\nFIG. 10\n) supports the observation that K1 is the major kininogenase in the airway. Christiansen, S. C., et al., \nAm Rev Respir Dis, \n1992. 145(4 Pt 1):900-905; Lauredo, I. T., et al., \nAm J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol, \n2004. 286(4):L734-40.\n\n\nCodon Optimization of DNA Encoding the Heavy and Light Chains of DX-2300\n\n\nDNA encoding the heavy and light chains of DX-2300 were both optimized for expression in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells by GENEART, experts in field, using a proprietary algorithm.

In addition, for the \nheavy chain\n 4 Procarya inhibitory motifs and 7 consensus cryptic splice donor sites were removed.

No. 11/734,984 filed Apr. 13, 2007, and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/797,504 filed May 3, 2006. The complete disclosures of the aforementioned related patent applications are hereby incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nNoxious chemical, thermal and mechanical stimuli excite peripheral nerve endings of small diameter sensory neurons (nociceptors) deriving from sensory ganglia (e.g., dorsal root, nodose and trigeminal ganglia) and initiate signals that are perceived as pain. Such nociceptive neurons (i.e., nociceptors) are crucial for the detection of harmful or potentially harmful stimuli (e.g., noxious thermal, chemical, and/or mechanical) that arise from changes in the extracellular environment during inflammatory, ischemic or otherwise traumatic conditions and that cause or have the potential to cause tissue damage (Wall, P. D., and Melzack, R., Textbook of Pain, 1994, New York: Churchill Livingstone).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNociceptors transduce noxious stimuli into membrane depolarization that leads to an action potential, its subsequent conduction to the CNS, and ultimately to the perception of pain, discomfort, etc. as well as to certain responses thereto. At the molecular level, nociception is carried out by ion channels and/or receptors. Plant-derived vanilloid compounds (e.g., capsaicin and resiniferatoxin) are known to selectively depolarize nociceptors and elicit sensations of burning pain: the sensation that is typically evoked by capsaicin-containing hot chili peppers. Therefore, capsaicin mimics the action of physiological/endogenous stimuli that activate the “nociceptive pathway”. Recent advances in pain biology have identified a receptor, called VR1 (a.k.a. capsaicin receptor or TRPV1) for vanilloids, protons and noxious heat. Because nociceptors are drivers of unwanted pain and inflammatory conditions in human beings and animals, modulation of their function is a validated strategy for palliative and other analgesic therapies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds that are modulators (competitive and non-competitive agonists or antagonists [with respect to capsaicin and/or its recognition site] and allosteric modulators) at VR1 have broad therapeutic potential, as demonstrated by the clinical usefulness of marketed, VR1-targeted pharmaceutical agents or the efficacy of VR1 modulators in animal models of disease. Furthermore, it is recognized that agonist modulators of VR1 may possess clinical utility deriving from their agonist properties, per se, and/or from their ability to produce an agonist-mediated desensitization, which would indirectly manifest as a functional antagonism. Similarly, antagonist modulators could exhibit direct antagonist (competitive or non-competitive) properties and/or indirect antagonist properties via the aforementioned desensitization mechanism. It is further recognized that positive and negative allosteric modulators may produce any or all of the aforementioned functional consequences and, as such, may also have clinical utility. Accordingly, this invention is directed to each of these types of modulators.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effective use of VR1 agonists has been demonstrated in inflammatory, neuropathic, and visceral pain states. In an experimental human pain model, dermal capsaicin pretreatment reduced the pain caused by intradermal injection of an acidic solution (Bianco, E. D.; Geppetti, P.; Zippi, P.; (solani, D.; Magini, B.; Cappugi, P. Brit J of Clin Pharmacol 1996, 41, 1-6), suggesting the benefit of VR1 agonists in the treatment of inflammatory pain. A particular role for VR1 agonists has been shown in inflammation and inflammatory pain: for example, resiniferatoxin prevented inflammatory hypersensitivity and edema induction by carrageenan (Kissin, I.; Bright, C. A.; Bradley, E. L., Jr. Anesth Analg 2002, 94, 1253-1258).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, capsaicin-containing creams (for example, Axcain® and Lidocare®) are marketed for dermal relief of pain related to diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia, indicative of the usefulness of VR1 agonists in the treatment of neuropathic pain states. Furthermore, such creams have been shown to reduce postsurgical neuropathic pain (Ellison, N., Loprinzi, C. L., Kugler, J., Hatfield, A. K., Miser, A., Sloan, J. A., Wender, D. B., Rowland, K. M., Molina, R., Cascino, T. L., Vukov, A. M., Dhaliwal, H. S, and Ghosh, C. J. Clin. Oncol. 15:2974-2980, 1997). In cancer patients, capsaicin contained in a taffy vehicle, was shown to substantially reduce oral mucositis pain caused by chemotherapy and radiation therapy (Berger, A., Henderson, M., Naadoolman, W., Duffy, V., Cooper, D., Saberski, L. and Bartoshuk, L. J. Pain Sympt. Mgmt 10:243-248, 1995.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVR1 also plays a role in the physiology of bladder emptying. VR1 is expressed by bladder sensory neurons, where it modulates bladder responsivity to liquid filling. The VR1 agonist resiniferatoxin desensitized bladder afferents in a dose-dependent manner (Avelino, A.; Cruz, F.; Coimbra, A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999, 378, 17-22), supporting its usefulness for the treatment of overactive bladder (Chancellor, M. B.; De Groat, W. C. J. Urol. (Baltimore) 1999, 162, 3-11). Indeed, intravesicular administration of capsaicin or resiniferatoxin inhibited bladder contraction in both normal and spinal cord injured rats (Komiyama, I.; Igawa, Y.; Ishizuka, O.; Nishizawa, O.; Andersson, K.-E. J. Urol. (Baltimore) 1999, 161, 314-319), indicative of the usefulness of VR1 agonists in nerve-injured incontinent patients. The effectiveness of capsaicin or resiniferatoxin treatment on incontinence in spinal cord injured patients was confirmed in a clinical study (de Seze, M.; Wiart, L.; de Seze, M.-P.; Soyeur, L.; Dosque, J.-P.; Blajezewski, S.; Moore, N.; Brochet, B.; Mazaux, J.-M.; Barat, M.; Joseph, P.-A. Journal of Urology (Hagerstown, Md., United States) 2003, 171, 251-255).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effectiveness of VR1 agonists in the reduction of elevated blood pressure is suggested by capsaicin reduction in blood pressure in SHR and WKY rats (Li, J.; Kaminski, N. E.; Wang, D. H. Hypertension 2003, 41, 757-762.). Capsaicin was also gastroprotective with respect to gastric antral ulcers (Yamamoto, H.; Horie, S.; Uchida, M.; Tsuchiya, S.; Murayama, T.; Watanabe, K. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2001, 432, 203-210).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVR1 antagonists also may be useful in the treatment of inflammatory, neuropathic and visceral pain. For example, the therapeutic utility of VR1 antagonists has been demonstrated in visceral inflammatory conditions. VR1 is elevated in colonic nerve fibers in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, and VR1 antagonists relieved pain and dysmotility (Yiangou, Y.; Facer, P.; Dyer, N. H.; Chan, C. L.; Knowles, C.; Williams, N. S.; Anand, P. Lancet 2001, 357, 1338-1339). Intestinal inflammation induced by toxin A or dextran sulfate sodium in rodents was attenuated by VR1 antagonists (McVey, D. C.; Schmid, P. C.; Schmid, H. H. O.; Vigna, S. R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003, 304, 713-722). In addition, a synthetic VR1 antagonist reduced colitis disease scores at several important endpoints, including macroscopic damage, microscopic epithelial damage, myeloperoxidase levels, and diarrhea scores, strongly supporting the therapeutic use of VR1 antagonists in inflammatory bowel diseases (Kimball, E. S.; Wallace, N. H.; Schneider, C. R.; D'Andrea, M. R.; Hornby, P. J. Neurogasteroenterology 2004, 16, 811-818). The VR1 antagonists capsazepine and BCTC reversed mechanical hyperalgesia in models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain in guinea pigs (Walker, K. M.; Urban, L.; Medhurst, S. J.; Patel, S.; Panesar, M.; Fox, A. J.; McIntyre, P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003, 304, 56-62) and rats (Pomonis, J. D.; Harrison, J. E.; Mark, L.; Bristol, D. R.; Valenzano, K. J.; Walker, K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003, 306, 387-393).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLPS-induced fever was attenuated in VR1 knock out mice (Lida, T.; Shimizu, I.; Nealen, M. L.; Campbell, A.; Caterina, M. Neurosci. Lett. 2005, 378, 28-33). VR1 agonist-induced rises in core body temperature were suppressed by capsazepine, indicative of the usefulness of VR1 antagonists in the treatment of pyresis (Ohnluki, K.; Haramizu, S.; Watanabe, T.; Yazawa, S.; Fushiki, T. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. (Tokyo) 2001, 47, 295-298).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVR1 agonists also modulate body temperature and fever. In ferret, rat and mouse, administration of resiniferatoxin-induced hypothermia (Woods, A. J.; Stock, M. J.; Gupta, A. N.; Wong, T. T. L.; Andrews, P. L. R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1994, 264, 125-133). Additionally, phase I of LPS (lipopolysaccharide)-induced fever did not occur in animals desensitized with low intraperitoneal doses of capsaicin (Romanovsky, A. A. Frontiers in Bioscience 2004, 9, 494-504).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe therapeutic potential of VR1 antagonists in inflammatory bronchial conditions is demonstrated by the finding that they antagonize capsaicin- and acid-induced bronchoconstriction (Nault, M. A.; Vincent, S. G.; Fisher, J. T. J. Physiol. 1999, 515, 567-578). Related findings demonstrate that the VR1 antagonist capsazepine attenuates anandamide-induced cough in guinea pigs (Jia, Y.; McLeod, R. L.; Wang, X.; Parra, L. E.; Egan, R. W.; Hey, J. A. Brit. J. Pharmacol. 2002, 137, 831-836).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe VR1 antagonist capsazepine was demonstrated to significantly reduce anxiety-like behaviors in rats using the elevated plus maze (Kasckow, J. W.; Mulchahey, J. J.; Geracioti, T. D. Jr. Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacol. and Biological Psychiatry 2004, 28, 291-295). Thus, VR1 antagonists may have utility in the treatment of anxiety, panic disorders, phobias or other non-adaptive stress responses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nU.S. Pat.

There is also a need for novel benzimidazole compounds that act as potent functional antagonists and/or agonists of the human and rat VR1 ion channel. Finally, there is a need for novel benzimidazoles that bind with high affinity to VR1 and also act as potent functional antagonists of the human and rat VR1 ion channel.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention is directed to a compound of Formula (I):\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nand a form thereof, wherein R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3a\n, R\n3b\n, R\n4\n, p, q, r, L and A\n1 \nare as defined herein, and their use as potent modulators of VR\n1\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention is also directed to a method for treating a VR\n1 \nion channel mediated disease in a subject in need thereof comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of a compound of Formula (I).

vanilloid VR1 ion channel, the compounds of Formula (I) are useful in methods for treating a VR1 ion channel mediated disease in a subject which disease is affected by the modulation of one or more vanilloid receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, the present invention is directed to a method of treating a VR1 ion channel mediated disease in a subject in need thereof comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of a compound of Formula (I) or a salt or solvate thereof.\n\n\n \nCompound Forms\n\n\n \n \n \nThe term “form” means, in reference to compounds of the present invention, such may exist as, without limitation, a salt, stereoisomer, tautomer, crystalline, polymorph, amorphous, solvate, hydrate, ester, prodrug or metabolite form. The present invention encompasses all such compound forms and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “isolated form” means, in reference to compounds of the present invention, that such may exist in an essentially pure state such as, without limitation, an enantiomer, a racemic mixture, a geometric isomer (such as a cis or trans stereoisomer), a mixture of geometric isomers, and the like. The present invention encompasses all such isolated forms and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain compounds of Formula (I) may exist in various stereoisomeric or tautomeric forms and mixtures thereof. The invention encompasses all such compounds and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention may be present in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts. For use in medicines, the “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” of the compounds of this invention refer to non-toxic acidic/anionic or basic/cationic salt forms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of this invention include acid addition salts which may, for example, be formed by mixing a solution of the compound according to the invention with a solution of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, acetic acid, benzoic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, carbonic acid or phosphoric acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore when the compounds of the present invention carry an acidic moiety, suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may include alkali metal salts, e.g. sodium or potassium salts; alkaline earth metal salts, e.g. calcium or magnesium salts; and salts formed with suitable organic ligands, e.g. quaternary ammonium salts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, representative pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the following: acetate, adipate, benzenesulfonate, benzoate, bicarbonate, bisulfate, bitartrate, borate, bromide, calcium, camsylate (or camphorsulphonate), carbonate, chloride, choline, clavulanate, citrate, dihydrochloride, disodium, edetate, fumarate, gluconate, glutamate, hydrabamine, hydrobromine, hydrochloride, iodide, isothionate, lactate, malate, maleate, mandelate, mesylate, nitrate, oleate, pamoate, palmitate, phosphate/diphosphate, salicylate, sodium, stearate, sulfate, succinate, tartrate, tromethane, tosylate, trichloroacetate, trifluoroacetate and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn example of the present invention includes compounds of Formula (I) and a salt form thereof wherein the salt is selected from the group consisting of disodium, hydrochloride and sodium.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention includes compounds of various isomers and mixtures thereof. The term “isomer” refers to compounds that have the same composition and molecular weight but differ in physical and/or chemical properties. Such substances have the same number and kind of atoms but differ in structure. The structural difference may be in constitution (geometric isomers) or in an ability to rotate the plane of polarized light (stereoisomers).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “optical isomer” means isomers of identical constitution that differ only in the spatial arrangement of their groups. Optical isomers rotate the plane of polarized light in different directions. The term “optical activity” means the degree to which an optical isomer rotates the plane of polarized light.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “racemate” or “racemic mixture” means an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species, wherein each of the isolated species rotates the plane of polarized light in the opposite direction such that the mixture is devoid of optical activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “enantiomer” means an isomer having a nonsuperimposable mirror image. The term “diastereomer” means stereoisomers that are not enantiomers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “chiral” means a molecule, which in a given configuration, cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. This is in contrast to achiral molecules, which can be superimposed on their mirror images.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention is considered to include the tautomeric forms of all compounds of Formula (I). In addition, for chiral embodiments of the invention, the invention is considered to include pure enantiomers, racemic mixtures, as well as mixtures of enantiomers having 0.001% to 99.99% enantiomeric excess. In addition, some of the compounds represented by Formula (I) may be prodrugs, i.e., derivatives of a drug that possess superior delivery capabilities and therapeutic value as compared to the active drug. Prodrugs are transformed into active drugs by in vivo enzymatic or chemical processes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe two distinct mirror image versions of the chiral molecule are also known as levo (left-handed), abbreviated L, or dextro (right handed), abbreviated D, depending on which way they rotate polarized light. The symbols “R” and “S” represent the configuration of groups around a stereogenic carbon atom(s).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn example of an enantiomerically enriched form isolated from a racemic mixture includes a dextrorotatory enantiomer, wherein the mixture is substantially free of the levorotatory isomer. In this context, substantially free means the levorotatory isomer may, in a range, comprise less than 25% of the mixture, less than 10%, less than 5%, less than 2% or less than 1% of the mixture according to the formula:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlevorotatory\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\nmass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlevorotatory\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\nmass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndextrorotatory\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\nmass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlevorotatory\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n×\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilarly, an example of an enantiomerically enriched form isolated from a racemic mixture includes a levorotatory enantiomer, wherein the mixture is substantially free of the dextrorotatory isomer.

In the “E” configuration, the substituents are on opposite sides in relationship to the carbon-carbon double bond. In the “Z” configuration, the substituents are oriented on the same side in relationship to the carbon-carbon double bond. The scope of the present invention is intended to include all such “E” and “Z” isomers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubstituent atoms (other than hydrogen) attached to a ring system may be in a cis or trans configuration. In the “cis” configuration, the substituents are on the same side in relationship to the plane of the ring; in the “trans” configuration, the substituents are on opposite sides in relationship to the plane of the ring.

A suitably substituted phenyl group can be appended to AA3 by a variety of coupling reactions (Suzuki, Stille) that are well known to those versed in the art. A particularly useful substitution method employs a palladium catalyzed cross-coupling Suzuki reaction (Huff, B. et. al. \nOrg. Syn. \n1997, 75: 53-60; and, Goodson, F. E. et. al. \nOrg. Synth. \n1997, 75: 61-68).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs an example, a mixture of bromobenzimidazole AA3 is reacted with a suitable phenyl boronic acid AA4 in the presence of a reagent such as cesium carbonate and a catalytic amount of a palladium catalyst such as PdCl\n2\ndppf in a solvent such as a mixture of dioxane and ethanol at elevated temperatures to give AA5. The reaction times can be reduced by carrying out this procedure at similar (about 100° C.) or lower temperatures in a microwave synthesizer. Other palladium catalysts suitable for this type of reaction include Pd(PPh\n3\n)\n4\n.\n\n\n \nReaction Scheme BB\n\n\n \n \n \nCinnamic acids, as required, can be synthesized via procedures described in reaction Scheme BB.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA solution of arylaldehyde BB1 and (carbethoxymethylene)triphenyl phosphorane in a solvent such as toluene or benzene in the presence of a base such as NaOH is stirred usually at elevated temperatures to give the corresponding cinnamate ester. The ester is hydrolyzed under standard conditions to provide the corresponding cinnamic acid BB2.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPhenylpropionic acid BB3, as required, can be synthesized from cinnamic acid BB2 by hydrogenation using a variety of standard procedures. As shown above, a mixture of BB2 in ethanol with a catalytic amount of palladium on carbon (10%) is stirred at room temperature in an atmosphere of hydrogen (50 psi) to provide acid BB3.\n\n\n \nReaction Scheme BB′\n\n\n \n \n \nReaction Scheme BB′ is a variation of Reaction Scheme BB.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReaction of aldehyde BB1 with malonic acid and a catalytic amount of piperidine in pyridine at elevated temperatures produces cinnamic acid BB2 in high yield.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAcid BB2 is converted to the acid chloride by reaction with oxalyl chloride and a catalytic amount of DMF in a solvent such as methylene chloride. The acid chloride is then heated with AA1 in acetic acid to give BB′1, which is further elaborated in place of AA3 as described in reaction Scheme AA.\n\n\n \nReaction Scheme CC\n\n\n \n \n \nReaction Scheme CC provides a method to prepare substituted 4-bromobenzene-1,2-diamine intermediates.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs an example, to a solution of a suitably substituted 4-bromoaniline CC1 in trifluoroacetic anhydride is added KNO\n3 \nportionwise at a suitable temperature. The reaction mixture may then be warmed to room temperature for optimal conversion to nitroamide CC2.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSequentially, using standard procedures, the amide is hydrolyzed and the nitro group is reduced to give bromodiamine CC3. Intermediate CC3 is further elaborated as described in reaction Scheme AA.\n\n\n \nReaction Scheme DD\n\n\n \n \n \nAn alternative synthetic sequence to produce compounds of the present invention is described in reaction Scheme DD.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA substituted bromobenzimidazole DD1 (representative of AA3 in Scheme AA) is protected (using a protecting group such as Boc), then converted to a pinicolboronate ester DD2 under standard Suzuki coupling conditions (Prieto, M. et. al., J. Org. Chem. 2004, 69: 6812-6820; McDonald, D. et. al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2005, 15: 5241-5246; and, Poon, S. F. et. al. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2004, 14, 5477-5480).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a typical procedure, a mixture of bromo-benzimidazole DD1, bis-(pinacolato)diboron, potassium carbonate and a catalytic amount of a palladium catalyst such as PdCl\n2\ndppf in DMF is heated at elevated temperatures to give boronate ester DD2. Frequently, the reaction durations can be reduced by carrying out this procedure at similar or lower temperatures in a microwave irradiation apparatus.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBoronate ester DD2 can be converted to compounds of the present invention (Boc protected DD3) by Suzuki coupling with a phenyl halide, mesylate or triflate (R\n1\n)\np\nPh-X. In this instance, borane DD2 is reacted with a suitable aryl halide, tetrakis (triphenylphosphine) palladium (0) and tri-tert-butylphosphonium tetrafluoroborate in 2M aqueous potassium carbonate in toluene at 100° C. to give the protected form of DD3. Deprotection with an acid such as TFA gives DD3.\n\n\n \nReaction Scheme EE\n\n\n \n \n \nReaction Scheme EE describes methods to prepare representative compounds of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAniline EE1 can be converted to a variety of amides, carbamates or ureas EE2 by utilizing any number of acylation methods that are commonly used by persons versed in the art. As an example, reaction of EE1 in a solvent such as THF with a substituted acid chloride and a base such as triethylamine gives the corresponding amide of EE2. As a further example, reaction of EE1 in THF with a substituted chloroformate and triethylamine gives the corresponding substituted carbamate of EE2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEE1 can be converted to sulfonamides by utilizing various sulfonylation conditions. For instance, reaction of EE1 in a solvent such as THF with an alkylsulfonyl chloride and triethylamine gives the alkylsulfonamide EE3. EE1 can be selectively, and successively substituted to give EE3. An efficient method of achieving this is via reductive alkylation with aldehydes or ketones (see Mattson, R. J. et. al. \nJ. Org. Chem. \n1990, 55, 2552-2554) and references cited therein]. In this procedure, equal amounts of EE1 and an aldehyde or ketone are stirred with titanium (IV) isopropoxide, followed the addition of sodium cyanoborohydride in a solvent such as ethanol to give substituted amine EE3.\n\n\n \nReaction Scheme FF\n\n\n \n \n \nA synthetic sequence to produce compounds of the present invention wherein L is cyclopropyl is described in reaction Scheme FF.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReaction of cinnamate ester FF1, in this case a methyl ester, with trimethylsulfonium iodide methylide in a solvent such as DMSO and sodium hydride (as exemplified by Burger, A. et. al. \nJ. Med. Chem. \n1970, 13, 33-35), gives cyclopropyl ester FF2.

An exotherm developed (about 38-40° C.), which was maintained for 30 min. Piperidine (14.202 mL, 143.58 mmol) was then added to the reaction and a second exotherm developed (T\nmax \nabout 42° C. after about 10 min.). The reaction was stirred for 30 min and then heated to 60° C. for 18 h (overnight). The reaction appeared to be complete by TLC, and was cooled to about 40° C., diluted into water (2 L; done to prevent reaction freezing), cooled to room temperature, and further diluted with water (4 L, 6 L total). The slurry was acidified to pH=2.0-3.0 with concentrated hydrochloric acid (about 675-700 mL). The material was stirred for 30 min., and a white solid was collected by filtration. The filter cake was washed with water until the filtrate was neutral (pH about 5.5-6, 2.5 L), air-dried in a Buchner funnel for 2 h, and then further dried in a vacuum oven at 60° C. overnight to provide 300.5 g (96%) of the title Compound 10a as a white solid.\n\n\n \nStep B. (E)-5-bromo-2-[2-(4-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-vinyl]-1H-benzimidazole\n\n\n \n \n \nTo a 5-L 4-neck round bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, argon inlet-argon outlet to a carbonate scrub, two stoppers, and a room temperature water bath was charged with 4-(trifluoromethyl)cinnamic acid (315 g, 1.46 mol) and dichloromethane (3.15 L) to give a slurry. To the slurry was added oxalyl chloride (151.71 mL, 1.75 mol) and DMF (1.13 mL, 14.57 mmol). Upon addition of DMF, gas evolution commenced, and the reaction was continued for about 3 h during which time a solution developed. When the reaction was complete (LC-MS), it was concentrated to dryness to give 342.4 g of 3-(4-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-acryloyl chloride Compound 10b (>100%) as a yellow oily solid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA 5-L 4-neck round bottom flask equipped with mechanical stirrer, thermocouple, air condenser with argon inlet, and a stopper was charged with 4-bromo-benzene-1,2-diamine (244 g, 1.27 mol) and acetic acid (2.13 L). To this solution was added a solution of Compound 10b (327 g, 1.39 mol) in toluene (237 mL). After this addition, the temperature spiked to 45° C. in about 30 seconds and then subsided. The reaction was then heated to 90° C. for 16 h (overnight). The reaction was cooled to 40° C., and poured into a mixed solution of EtOAc and heptane (about 1:3, 5.75 L) and a precipitate occurred. The resulting slurry was stirred for 3 h, and the solid was collected by filtration, washed with EtOAc: heptane (1:3, 3 L), and then dried in a vacuum oven (60° C.) to give 324.3 g (65%) of the title Compound 10c as a partial acetate salt.\n\n\n \nStep C. 2-(2-bromo-phenyl)-propan-2-ol\n\n\n \n \n \nA 12-Liter 4-neck flask equipped with a thermocouple, condenser, septum, addition funnel and overhead mechanical stirrer under argon was charged with methyl-2-bromobenzoate (226.5 g, 1.05 mol) and THF (1.6 L, 19.66 mol). The mixture was cooled to a temperature between 2 and 5° C. with stirring and held for 30 min. To the solution was slowly added methyl magnesium bromide in diethyl ether (3M, 1.05 L; 3.15 mol) via the addition funnel at a rate to maintain the reaction temperature below 15° C. An exotherm was observed during the addition, the reaction temperature warmed from 3 to 15° C. The addition of 1.05 L Grignard was complete in 4 h (approximate feed rate was 4.17 mL/min). The reaction mixture appeared to be off-white/yellow slurry. The reaction was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred overnight (15 h). The reaction was sampled by HPLC/TLC and showed no starting material present. The ice bath was again applied to the reaction flask and a 0.5 M HCl solution (4.5 L; 2.25 mol) was slowly added over a period of 2 h. The temperature increased dramatically from 0 to 15° C. After the quench was complete, the reaction was stirred at room temperature for 30 min. Additional 2 N HCl (500 mL; 1.00 mol) was slowly added to maintain a pH less than 6. MTBE (1 L) was added to help with the phase split. The reaction was stirred at room temperature for 1 to 2 h to dissolve the solid material into the aqueous phase (most likely Mg(OH)\n2 \nwhich is very basic). The pH must be checked and adjusted with additional acid when necessary. The phases were separated and the aqueous layer was washed with an additional 1 L MTBE (2×500 mL). The organic phases were combined, washed with NaHCO\n3 \nsolution (2×300 mL), dried over MgSO\n4\n, filtered and the filtrate was concentrated under vacuum to yield the title Compound 10d (220.83 g, 97.48% yield) as a clear yellow oil.\n\n\n \nStep D. 3,3-dimethyl-3H-benzo[c][1,2]oxaborol-1-ol\n\n\n \n \n \nA 12-Liter 4-neck round bottom flask equipped with a thermocouple, condenser, addition funnel and overhead mechanical stirrer under dry Argon was charged with anhydrous THF, (3 L) and chilled to −70 to −78° C. via a dry ice/acetone bath. n-Butyl lithium (2.5N in hexanes, 860 mL, 2.15 mol) was slowly added via addition funnel. An exotherm was observed as the temperature rose from −78 to −70° C. To the addition funnel was added a solution of Compound 10d (220 g, 979.97 mmol) in anhydrous THF (1 L). The 2-(2-bromophenyl)propan-2-ol solution was slowly added to the n-BuLi solution. The addition took 90 min in order to maintain a reaction temperature below −70° C. After the addition was complete, the reaction mixture was stirred at −70 to −75° C. for 30 min. The triethylborate (230 mL, 1.35 mol) was quickly added in 3 portions at −70° C. An exotherm was observed, the batch temperature rose from −70 to −64° C. The reaction was stirred at −70° C. and slowly warmed to room temperature over night. After the reaction was cooled to 0-5° C., the reaction was slowly quenched with 2 M HCl (1 L, 2.00 mol) added via the addition funnel while maintaining the batch temperature 0-5° C. The reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h. The aqueous phase pH was 9-10. The pH was then adjusted to acidic (4-5) with 2 M HCl (200 mL). The two phases were separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with MTBE (2×500 mL). The combined organic phases were dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solution was filtered and concentrated to yield a yellow oil. The yellow oil was diluted with MTBE (1.5 L) and washed with 1M NaOH (3×500 mL). The product containing basic aqueous phases were combined and acidified with 2 M HCl (800 mL) (the clear solution turns turbid with the addition of acid). After stirring the turbid solution for 15 min (pH=4-5) (Note 1), it was extracted with MTBE (2×500 mL). The organic phases were combined and dried over MgSO\n4\n. The solution was filtered and the filtrate was concentrated to yield the title Compound 10e as a clear yellow oil (121.78 grams, 77% yield).\n\n\n \nStep E. (E)-2-(2-{2-[2-(4-Trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-vinyl]-1H-benzimidazol-5-yl}-phenyl)-propan-2-ol\n\n\n \n \n \nA 5-L 4-neck flask equipped with a thermocouple controller, condenser, overhead mechanical stirrer, Firestone valve® and a nitrogen inlet/outlet was charged with dimethoxyethane (2 L), DI water (1 L) and sodium carbonate (230.9 g, 2.18 mol). The solution was degassed and purged with N\n2 \nthree times. Compound 10e (71.7 g, 0.35 mol) and Compound 10c (100.0 g, 0.27 mol) were added to the degassed solution. The solution was degassed and purged with N\n2 three times. PdCl\n \n2\n(dppf) (44.48 g, 54.4 mmol) was added to the solution, and the solution was degassed and purged with N\n2 \nthree times. The resulting two-phase suspension was heated to reflux for 18 h, and then cooled to room temperature. The reaction mixture was transferred to a 12-L separatory funnel, and the layers were separated. The organic layer was washed with brine (1 L). The two aqueous layers were combined and extracted with EtOAc (1 L). The combined organic layers were dried (Na\n2\nSO\n4\n), filtered, and the filtrate was concentrated to an oil. Two separate 100 g coupling reactions were combined and purified by chromatography in 10 successive chromatography runs on an ISCO preparative chromatography system (10×1.5 Kg SiO\n2\n, 5 column volumes of EtOAc, 250 mL/min flow rate). The combined fractions were transferred to two 22 L 4-neck round bottom flasks, and Silicycle Si-thiol functionalized silica gel (2 g) was added to each solution. The solutions were warmed to 40° C. and aged for 1 h. The solutions were filtered thru a medium glass funnel and washed with EtOAc (4 L) and combined. The filtrate was evaporated to a semi solid, which was transferred to a 2 L round bottom flask, to which EtOAc (0.4 L) was added. The resulting white precipitate slurry was cooled to −5° C. and stirred for 1 h. The slurry was filtered and washed twice with cold EtOAc (100 mL). The solids were dried in a vacuum oven at 40° C. for 40 h to afford 84.0 g (36.5% yield, 98.8 area % purity) of the title Compound 18 as a white solid. Anal.

The reaction mixture was cooled, and concentrated. The residue was purified by chromatography (silica gel, hexanes: EtOAc, 2:1) to provide the title Compound 18b as a yellow oil. \n1\nH-NMR (400 MHz, CDCl\n3\n) δ (ppm): 8.12 (d, 1H) 7.86 (d, 1H) 7.62-7.46 (m, 3H) 7.22 (d, 1H) 7.14 (d, 1H) 2.62 (d, 3H) 1.55 (s, 9H) 1.44 (s, 9H).\n\n\n \nStep C. 3′,4′-diamino-biphenyl-2-sulfonic acid methylamide\n\n\n \n \n \nA solution of Compound 18b (21.4 g, 0.0995 mol) in 210 mL of 4M HCl in dioxane was stirred for 4 hours. The reaction mixture was concentrated, made basic with 1M NaOH (aq), and extracted with EtOAc. The organic fraction was dried over Na\n2\nSO\n4\n, filtered, and the filtrate was concentrated to provide the title\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompound 18c as a brown oil. \n1\nH-NMR (400 MHz, CD\n3\nOD) δ (ppm): 8.00 (dd, 1H, J=1.6 and 8.0 Hz) 7.59 (dt, 1H, J=1.6 and 8.4 Hz) 7.48 (dt, 1H, J=1.2 and 8.4 Hz) 7.33 (dd, 1H, J=1.2 and 8.0 Hz) 6.79 (d, 1H, J=2.0 Hz) 6.75 (d, 1H, J=8.4 Hz) 6.68 (d, 1H, J=2.0 and 7.6 Hz) 2.93 (s, 3H) MS (ESI, pos. ion) m/z: 277.9 (M+1).\n\n\n \nStep D.

Increases in Ca\n++\n concentration were readily detected upon challenge with capsaicin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHEK293 cells expressing hVR1 were grown on poly-D-lysine coated 384 well black-walled plates (BD 354663) and 1 day later loaded with Calcium 3 Dye for 35 min at 37° C., 5% CO\n2 \nand then for 25 min at room temperature, and subsequently tested for agonist-induced increases in intracellular Ca\n2+\n levels using FLIPR™ technology. Cells were challenged with test compounds (at varying concentrations) and intracellular Ca\n2+\n was measured for 5 min prior to the addition of capsaicin to all wells to achieve a final concentration of 0.030 μM eliciting about 80% maximal response. IC\n50 \nvalues were determined from concentration-response studies, which were generated using the average of quadruplicate wells for each data point.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor those compounds tested, an IC\n50 \n(nM) value and percent inhibition value is shown in Table 2. Except where indicated, the percent inhibition values were obtained at a test concentration of 1 μM; otherwise: \n(1)\nthe test concentration was 5 μM. The percent inhibition value is provided for those compounds where an IC\n50 \nvalue was not obtained. The term “NA” means that the data is “not available” because it was not obtained for a particular compound.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCpd\n\n\n%

inflammatory pain. To assess the ability of test compounds to reverse thermal hyperalgesia, baseline response latencies on a radiant heat (RH) paw stimulator were obtained before an intraplantar injection of 100 μL (1 μg/μL) CFA (1:1 CFA:saline) in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Only withdrawal responses that were quick hind paw movements (with or without licking of the hind paw) were recorded. Paw movements associated with locomotion or a shifting of weight were not considered a withdrawal response. The stimulus intensity that produced 10-15 sec baseline withdrawal latencies was used and a maximum cutoff of 20 sec was imposed. Hypersensitivity was evaluated 24 hr after CFA. Only rats that exhibited at least a 25% reduction in response latency from baseline (i.e. hyperalgesia) were included in further analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing the post-inflammogen latency assessment, rats were orally dosed (2.5 mL/kg) with test compound (10 mg/kg) or vehicle (20% hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextran). To determine the time of peak effect, latencies were redetermined 30, 60, 100, 180 and 300 min after compound administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nData are presented as the maximal percent reversal of hypersensitivity obtained during the 300 min test, which was calculated for each animal according to the formula:\n\n\n \n \n \n% reversal=100%×(treatment response−post-inflammogen response)/(pre-inflammogen response−post-inflammogen response)\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCpd\n\n\n% Reversal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n17\n\n\n104\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n18\n\n\n133\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n22\n\n\n18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n23\n\n\n31\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n31\n\n\n72\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n47\n\n\n58\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n70\n\n\n76\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n78\n\n\n19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n114\n\n\n56\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n310\n\n\n23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n464\n\n\n65\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 4\n\n\nIncision-Induced Model of Postoperative Surgery\n\n\n \n \n \nCompounds of the present invention were tested in animal models of postoperative surgery, as previously described (Brennan, T. J. et al., \nPain, \n1996, 64: 493-501). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were anaesthetized with 2-3 isoflurane and the plantar surface of the hindpaw was sterilized using three alternating betadine and alcohol scrubs. A 1 cm longitudinal incision through the skin of the plantar paw was made using a number 10 scalpel beginning 0.5 cm from the proximal heel and extending toward the toes. The plantaris muscle was excised using a forcep and incised longitudinally. The skin was then sutured in two locations using 5-0 silk. The wound site was then covered with antibiotic ointment and the animals were returned to their individual home cages. Changes in thermal sensitivity were evaluated before surgery and 24 hr after surgery. Vehicle (20% HPβCD) or test compound was orally administered and thermal sensitivity was re-assessed 30, 60, 100, 180 and 300 min later.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nData are presented as the maximal percent reversal of hypersensitivity obtained during the 300 min test, which was calculated for each animal according to the formula:\n\n\n \n \n \n% reversal=100% (treatment response−post-inflammogen response)/(pre-inflammogen response−post-inflammogen response)\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCpd\n\n\n% Reversal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n18\n\n\n132\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile the foregoing specification teaches the principles of the present invention, with examples provided for the purpose of illustration, it will be understood that the practice of the invention encompasses all of the usual variations, adaptations and/or modifications as come within the scope of the following claims and their equivalents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll publications disclosed in the above specification are hereby incorporated by reference in full."
