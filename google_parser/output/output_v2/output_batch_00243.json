These definitions apply to the terms as they are used throughout this specification, unless otherwise limited in specific instances, either individually or as part of a larger group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"alkyl\" or \"lower alkyl\" refers to straight or branched chain hydrocarbon groups of 1 to 20 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 7 carbon atoms. The expression \"lower alkyl\" refers to unsubstituted or substituted alkyl groups of 1 to 4 carbon atoms. When a subscript is used with reference to an alkyl or other group, the subscript refers to the number of carbon atoms that the group may contain. For example, the term \"C\n0-4\nalkyl\" includes a bond and alkyl groups of 1 to 4 carbon atoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe alkyl group may be optionally substituted by one to four substituents selected from halogen, hydroxy, alkoxy, keto (=O), alkanoyl, aryloxy, alkanoyloxy, NR\na\nR\nb\n, alkanoylamino, aroylamino, aralkanoylamino, alkanoylamino, arylamino, substituted aralkanoylamino, thiol, alkylthio, arylthio, aralkylthio, alkylthiono, arylthiono, aralkylthiono, alkylsulfonyl, arylsulfonyl, aralkylsulfonyl, -SO\n2\nNR\na\nR\nb\n, nitro, cyano, -CO\n2\nH, -CONR\na\nR\nb\n, alkoxycarbonyl, aryl, guanidino and heteroaryls or heterocyclos (such as indolyl, imidazolyl, furyl, thienyl, thiazolyl, pyrrolidyl, pyridyl, pyrimidyl and the like), wherein R\na\n and R\nb\n are selected from hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, heteroaryl, heteroarylalkyl, heterocyclo, and heterocycloalkyl.

The PDE4 inhibitor useful in this invention may be any compound that is known to inhibit the PDE4 enzyme or which is discovered to act in as PDE4 inhibitor, and which is only or essentially only a PDE4 inhibitor, not compounds which inhibit to a degree of exhibiting a therapeutic effect other members of the PDE family as well as PDE4. There are at least two binding forms on human monocyte recombinant PDE4 (hPDE4) at which inhibitors bind. One explanation for these observations is that hPDE4 exists in two distinct forms. One binds the likes of rolipram and denbufylline with a high affinity while the other binds these compounds with a low affinity. The most suitable PDE4 inhibitors of for use in this invention will be those compounds which have a salutary therapeutic ratio, i.e., compounds which preferentially inhibit cAMP catalytic activity where the enzyme is in the form that binds rolipram with a low affinity, thereby reducing the side effects which apparently are linked to inhibiting the form which binds rolipram with a high affinity. Generally it is most advantageous to use a PDE4 antagonists which has an IC\n50\n ratio of about 0.1 or greater as regards the IC\n50\n for the PDE4 catalytic form which binds rolipram with a high affinity divided by the IC\n50\n for the form which binds rolipram with a low affinity. Most suitable are those PDE4 inhibitors which have an IC\n50\n ratio of greater than 0.5, and particularly those compounds having a ratio of greater than 1.0.

After incubation at room temperature for 2 hours, transfer the binding reaction onto filtration plates (UniFilter CF/C filter plate presoaked with 0.3% polyethylenimine; PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences) using Packard Cell Harvester. Wash the filter with quarter strength of PBS (1:4 dilution of regular PBS with H\n2\nO) 8 times. Air dry the filter, add 40ul MicroScint20 into each well, seal the top, and count with the TopCount. Bound radioactivity was analyzed for Ki using nonlinear regression analysis (Excel Xfit) with the Kd values for [3H]CP55,940 determined from saturation experiments.\n\n\n \n\n\nGTPgS Binding Assay\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAdd 50ul of reaction mixture containing 2ug of CB2/CHO cell membrane proteins, 10 ul WGA-PVT beads (20mg/ml), and 5 uM GDP in assay buffer (20mM HEPES pH 7.4, 100mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 10mM MgCl\n2\n, 10ug/ml saponin, 0.25%BSA, and 1uM leupeptin) into each well in 96 well white plate (Coming 3693, VWR#29444-312). Add 1ul of testing compound into test, 1ul of DMSO into basal, 1ul of 200 uM CP55,940 into 100% activation, 1ul of 1mM cold GTPγS into NSB wells, respectively. Dilute [\n35\nS]GTPγS (1:12.5 pre-diluted 1uCi/ul stock, NEG030H, NEN) 1:1350 in binding buffer and add 25ul into each well (200pM final). Incubate at RT for 90min and spin the plate at 1000rpm for 5min before counting with TopCount for 1-2 min.\n\n \n \nCB2\n \n \n \n \nExample No.\n \nStructure\n \nCB2 binding Ki (nM)\n \nCB2 GTPgS EC50 (nM)\n \n \n \n \n1\n \n \n \n \n \n \n3\n \n2.4±0.55\n \n \n \n1A\n \n \n \n \n \n \n1588\n \n—\n \n \n \n2\n \n \n \n \n \n \n0.7±0.18\n \n2.2±0.48\n \n \n \n3\n \n \n \n \n \n \n7.6±1.7\n \n4.5±1.2\n \n \n \n4\n \n \n \n \n \n \n60±26\n \n8.1±2.2\n \n \n \n5\n \n \n \n \n \n \n39±14\n \n7.8±2.5\n \n \n \n6\n \n \n \n \n \n \n2.4±1.1\n \n—\n \n \n \n7\n \n \n \n \n \n \n0.24±0.12\n \n—\n \n \n \n8\n \n \n \n \n \n \n4.2±1.6\n \n—\n \n \n \n9\n \n \n \n \n \n \n39±14\n \n—\n \n \n \n10\n \n \n \n \n \n \n50±16\n \n—\n \n \n \n11\n \n \n \n \n \n \n35±12\n \n—"
