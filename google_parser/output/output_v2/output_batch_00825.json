Field of the Invention\n\n\nThe present invention relates to binding proteins and antigen-binding fragments thereof that bind interleukin-21 receptor (IL-21R), in particular, human IL-21R, and their use in regulating IL-21R-associated activities, e.g., IL-21 effects on the levels of expression of IL-21 responsive genes. The binding proteins disclosed herein are useful in treating and/or diagnosing IL-21R-associated disorders, e.g., inflammatory disorders, autoimmune diseases, allergies, transplant rejection, hyperproliferative disorders of the blood, and other immune system disorders. The invention further provides methods for determining pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of the antibodies of the invention.\n\n\n2. Related Background Art\n\n\nAntigens initiate immune responses and activate the two largest populations of lymphocytes: T cells and B cells. After encountering antigen, T cells proliferate and differentiate into effector cells, while B cells proliferate and differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells. These effector cells secrete and/or respond to cytokines, which are small proteins (less than about 30 kDa) secreted by lymphocytes and other cell types.\n\n\nHuman IL-21 is a cytokine that shows sequence homology to IL-2, IL-4 and IL-15 (Parrish-Novak et al. (2000) \nNature \n408:57-63). Despite low sequence homology among interleukin cytokines, cytokines share a common fold into a “four-helix-bundle” structure that is representative of the family. Most cytokines bind either class I or class II cytokine receptors. Class II cytokine receptors include the receptors for IL-10 and the interferons, whereas class I cytokine receptors include the receptors for IL-2 through IL-7, IL-9, IL-11, IL-12, IL-13, and IL-15, as well as hematopoietic growth factors, leptin, and growth hormone (Cosman (1993) \nCytokine \n5:95-106).\n\n\nHuman IL-21R is a class I cytokine receptor. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences encoding human IL-21 and its receptor (IL-21R) are described in International Application Publication Nos. \nWO\n 00/053761 and WO 01/085792; Parrish-Novak et al. (2000) supra; and Ozaki et al. (2000) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n97:11439-44. IL-21R has the highest sequence homology to the IL-2 receptor β chain and the IL-4 receptor α chain (Ozaki et al. (2000) supra). Upon ligand binding, IL-21R associates with the common gamma cytokine receptor chain (γc) that is shared by receptor complexes for IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-13 and IL-15 (Ozaki et al. (2000) supra; Asao et al. (2001) \nJ. Immunol. \n167:1-5).\n\n\nIL-21R is expressed in lymphoid tissues, particularly on T cells, B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells (DC) and macrophages (Parrish-Novak et al. (2000) supra), which allows these cells to respond to IL-21 (Leonard and Spolski (2005) \nNat. Rev. Immunol. \n5:688-98). The widespread lymphoid distribution of IL-21R indicates that IL-21 plays an important role in immune regulation. In vitro studies have shown that IL-21 significantly modulates the function of B cells, CD4\n+\n and CD8\n+\n T cells, and NK cells (Parrish-Novak et al. (2000) supra; Kasaian et al. (2002) \nImmunity \n16:559-69). Recent evidence suggests that IL-21-mediated signaling can have antitumor activity (Sivakumar et al. (2004) \nImmunology \n112:177-82), and that IL-21 can prevent antigen-induced asthma in mice (Shang et al. (2006) \nCell. Immunol. \n241:66-74).\n\n\nIn autoimmunity, disruption of the IL-21 gene and injection of recombinant IL-21 have been shown to modulate the progression of experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG) and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), respectively (King et al. (2004) \nCell \n117:265-77; Ozaki et al. (2004) \nJ. Immunol. \n173:5361-71; Vollmer et al. (2005) \nJ. Immunol. \n174:2696-2701; Liu et al. (2006) \nJ. Immunol. \n176:5247-54). In these experimental systems, it has been suggested that the manipulation of IL-21-mediated signaling directly altered the function of CD8\n+\n cells, B cells, T helper cells, and NK cells.\n\n\nThus, the present invention provides novel therapeutic agents for treating, e.g., autoimmune diseases that act by blocking the IL-21 signaling pathway, i.e., anti-IL-21R antibodies. In order for a therapeutic agent, such as an anti-IL-21R antibody, to be effective in vivo, a minimum serum concentration of the anti-IL-21R antibody necessary to modulate IL-21 responses should be determined; thus a method that allows accurate determination of such minimum serum concentration is required.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention describes the isolation and characterization of binding proteins, for example, human antibodies and fragments thereof, that specifically bind to the human and murine IL-21R. The binding proteins described herein are derived from antibody 18A5, which is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,495,085, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein. The binding proteins of the present invention have a much greater degree of affinity to human and/or murine IL-21R than does the parental 18A5 antibody.\n\n\nThe invention provides, at least in part, IL-21R binding agents (such as binding proteins and antigen-binding fragments thereof) that bind to IL-21R, in particular, human IL-21R, with high affinity and specificity. The binding proteins, and antigen-binding fragments thereof, of the present invention are also referred to herein as “anti-IL-21R binding proteins” and “fragments thereof,” respectively. In one embodiment, the binding protein or fragment thereof reduces, inhibits, or antagonizes IL-21R activity. Such binding proteins can be used to regulate immune responses or IL-21R-associated disorders by antagonizing IL-21R activity. In other embodiments, the anti-IL-21R binding protein can be used diagnostically, or as a targeting binding protein to deliver a therapeutic or cytotoxic agent to an IL-21R-expressing cell. Thus, the anti-IL-21R binding proteins of the invention are useful in diagnosing and treating IL-21R-associated disorders, e.g., inflammatory disorders, autoimmune diseases, allergies, transplant rejection, hyperproliferative disorders of the blood, and other immune system disorders, as described more fully herein.\n\n\nAccordingly, in one aspect, the binding proteins of the invention feature an isolated binding protein (e.g., an isolated antibody) or antigen-binding fragment thereof that binds to IL-21R, in particular, human IL-21R.

in vitro-generated and/or multispecific (e.g., bispecific antibodies formed from at least two intact antibodies).\n\n\nOne embodiment of the invention is a method of treating or preventing an

Additionally, the present binding proteins show improved potency in binding to and neutralizing both human and murine IL-21R as compared to 18A5 in the equivalent format (e.g., scFv or IgG). High-potency neutralization of IL-21R from both species (human and mouse) by a single binding protein has not previously been reported. The present binding proteins having a greater neutralization potency than their parental antibody may translate into higher efficacy as compared to agents previously described. In addition, the amino acid sequence of the V\nH \nand V\nL \nframework regions has been altered to match sequences encoded by human genomic sequence, thereby reducing the potential for human anti-human antibody responses in patients treated with the present binding proteins.\n\n\nDEFINITIONS\n\n\nIn order that the present invention may be more readily understood, certain terms are first defined. Additional definitions are set forth throughout the detailed description and elsewhere in the specification.\n\n\nThe term “binding protein” as used herein includes any naturally occurring, recombinant, synthetic, or genetically engineered protein, or a combination thereof, that binds an antigen, target protein, or peptide, or a fragment(s) thereof. Binding proteins of the invention can include antibodies, or be derived from at least one antibody fragment. The binding proteins can include naturally occurring proteins and/or proteins that are synthetically engineered. Binding proteins of the invention can bind to an antigen or a fragment thereof to form a complex and elicit a biological response (e.g., agonize or antagonize a particular biological activity). Binding proteins can include isolated antibody fragments, “Fv” fragments consisting of the variable regions of the heavy and light chains of an antibody, recombinant single-chain polypeptide molecules in which light and heavy chain variable regions are connected by a peptide linker (“scFv proteins”), and minimal recognition units consisting of the amino acid residues that mimic the hypervariable region. Binding protein fragments can also include functional fragments of an antibody, such as, for example, Fab, Fab′, F(ab′)\n2\n, Fc, Fd, Fd′, Fv, and a single variable domain of an antibody (dAb). The binding proteins can be double or single chain, and can comprise a single binding domain or multiple binding domains.\n\n\nBinding proteins can also include binding domain-immunoglobulin fusion proteins, including a binding domain polypeptide that is fused or otherwise connected to an immunoglobulin hinge or hinge-acting region polypeptide, which in turn is fused or otherwise connected to a region comprising one or more native or engineered constant regions from an immunoglobulin heavy chain other than CH1, for example, the CH2 and CH3 regions of IgG and IgA, or the CH3 and CH4 regions of IgE (see, e.g., Ledbetter et al., U.S. Patent Publication 2005/0136049, for a more complete description). The binding domain-immunoglobulin fusion protein can further include a region that includes a native or engineered immunoglobulin heavy chain CH2 constant region polypeptide (or CH3 in the case of a construct derived in whole or in part from IgE) that is fused or otherwise connected to the hinge region polypeptide, and a native or engineered immunoglobulin heavy chain CH3 constant region polypeptide (or CH4 in the case of a construct derived in whole or in part from IgE) that is fused or otherwise connected to the CH2 constant region polypeptide (or CH3 in the case of a construct derived in whole or in part from IgE). Typically, such binding domain-immunoglobulin fusion proteins are capable of at least one immunological activity selected from the group consisting of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, complement fixation, and/or binding to a target, for example, a target antigen. The binding proteins of the invention can be derived from any species including, but not limited to mouse, rat, human, camel, llama, fish, shark, goat, rabbit, chicken, and bovine.\n\n\nThe term “antibody” as used herein refers to an immunoglobulin that is reactive to a designated protein or peptide or fragment thereof. Suitable antibodies include, but are not limited to, human antibodies, primatized antibodies, chimeric antibodies, monoclonal antibodies, monospecific antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, polyspecific antibodies, nonspecific antibodies, bispecific antibodies, multispecific antibodies, humanized antibodies, synthetic antibodies, recombinant antibodies, hybrid antibodies, mutated antibodies, grafted conjugated antibodies (i.e., antibodies conjugated or fused to other proteins, radiolabels, cytotoxins), and in vitro-generated antibodies. The antibody can be from any class of antibodies including, but not limited to, IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD, and IgE, and from any subclass (e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4) of antibodies. The antibody can have a heavy chain constant region chosen from, e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4. The antibody can also have a light chain chosen from, e.g., kappa (κ) or lambda (λ). The antibodies of the invention can be derived from any species including, but not limited to mouse, rat, human, camel, llama, fish, shark, goat, rabbit, chicken, and bovine. Constant regions of the antibodies can be altered, e.g., mutated, to modify the properties of the antibody (e.g., to increase or decrease one or more of: Fc receptor binding, antibody glycosylation, the number of cysteine residues, effector cell function, or complement function). Typically, the antibody specifically binds to a predetermined antigen, e.g., an antigen associated with a disorder, e.g., an inflammatory, immune, autoimmune, neurodegenerative, metabolic, and/or malignant disorder.\n\n\nThe term “single domain binding protein” as used herein includes any single domain binding scaffold that binds to an antigen, protein, or polypeptide. Single domain binding proteins can include any natural, recombinant, synthetic, or genetically engineered protein scaffold, or a combination thereof, that binds an antigen or fragment thereof to form a complex and elicit a biological response (e.g., agonize or antagonize a particular biological activity). Single domain binding proteins may be derived from naturally occurring proteins or antibodies, or they can be synthetically engineered or produced by recombinant technology. Single domain binding proteins may be any in the art or any future single domain binding proteins, and may be derived from any species including, but not limited to mouse, human, camel, llama, fish, shark, goat, rabbit, chicken, and bovine. In some embodiments of the invention, a single domain binding protein scaffold can be derived from a variable region of the immunoglobulin found in fish, such as, for example, that which is derived from the immunoglobulin isotype known as Novel Antigen Receptor (NAR) found in the serum of shark. Methods of producing single domain binding scaffolds derived from a variable region of NAR (“IgNARs”) are described in International Application Publication No. WO 03/014161 and Streltsov (2005) \nProtein Sci. \n14(11):2901-09.\n\n\nIn other embodiments, a single domain binding protein is a naturally occurring single domain binding protein, which has been described in the art as a heavy chain antibody devoid of light chains. Such single domain binding proteins are disclosed in, e.g., International Application Publication No. WO 94/004678. For clarity reasons, a variable domain binding protein that is derived from a heavy chain antibody naturally devoid of light chain is known herein as a VHH or “nanobody” to distinguish it from the conventional V\nH \nof four-chain immunoglobulins. Such a VHH molecule can be derived from antibodies raised in Camelidae species, for example in camel, llama, dromedary, alpaca, and guanaco. Other families besides Camelidae may also be used to produce heavy chain binding proteins naturally devoid of light chains. VHH molecules are approximately ten times smaller than traditional IgG molecules. They are single polypeptides and are very stable, resisting extreme pH and temperature conditions. Moreover, they are resistant to the action of proteases, which is not the case for conventional antibodies. Furthermore, in vitro expression of VHHs can produce high-yield, properly folded functional VHHs. In addition, binding proteins generated in Camelids can recognize epitopes other than those recognized by antibodies generated in vitro via antibody libraries or via immunization of mammals other than Camelids (see, e.g., International Application Publication Nos. WO 97/049805 and WO 94/004678, both hereby incorporated by reference herein).\n\n\nThe terms “antigen-binding domain” and “antigen-binding fragment” refer to a part of a binding protein that comprises amino acids responsible for the specific binding between the binding protein and an antigen. The part of the antigen that is specifically recognized and bound by the binding protein is referred to as the “epitope.” An antigen-binding domain may comprise a light chain variable region (V\nL\n) and a heavy chain variable region (V\nH\n) of an antibody; however, it does not have to comprise both. Fd fragments, for example, have two V\nH \nregions and often retain antigen-binding function of the intact antigen-binding domain. Examples of antigen-binding fragments of a binding protein include, but are not limited to: (1) a Fab fragment, a monovalent fragment having V\nL\n, V\nH\n, C\nL \nand \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 domains; (2) a F(ab′)\n2 \nfragment, a bivalent fragment having two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; (3) an Fd fragment, having two V\nH \nand one \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 domains; (4) an Fv fragment, having the V\nL \nand V\nH \ndomains of a single arm of an antibody; (5) a dAb fragment (see, e.g., Ward et al. (1989) \nNature \n341:544-46), having a V\nH \ndomain; (6) an isolated CDR; and (7) a single chain variable fragment (scFv). Although the two domains of an Fv fragment, V\nL \nand V\nH \nare coded for by separate genes, they can be joined, using recombinant methods, by a synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a single protein chain in which the V\nL \nand V\nH \nregions pair to form monovalent molecules (known as scFv) (see, e.g., Bird et al. (1988) \nScience \n242:423-26; Huston et al. (1988) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n85:5879-83). These binding domain fragments can be obtained using conventional techniques known to those with skill in the art, and the fragments are evaluated for function in the same manner as are intact binding proteins such as, for example, antibodies.\n\n\nThe term “neutralizing” refers to a binding protein or antigen-binding fragment thereof (for example, an antibody) that reduces or blocks the activity of a signaling pathway or an antigen, e.g., IL-21/IL-21R signaling pathway or IL-21R antigen. “An anti-product antibody,” as used herein, refers to an antibody formed in response to exogenous protein, e.g., an anti-IL-21R antibody. “A neutralizing anti-product antibody,” as used herein, refers to an anti-product antibody that blocks the in vivo activity of the exogenously introduced protein, e.g., an anti-IL-21R antibody. In some embodiments of the invention, a neutralizing anti-product antibody diminishes in vivo activity of an IL-21R antibody, e.g., in vivo pharmacodynamic (PD) activity of an IL-21R antibody (such as the ability of an anti-IL-21R antibody to modulate expression of IL-21-responsive cytokines or genes).\n\n\nThe term “effective amount” refers to a dosage or amount that is sufficient to regulate IL-21R activity to ameliorate or lessen the severity of clinical symptoms or achieve a desired biological outcome, e.g., decreased T cell and/or B cell activity, suppression of autoimmunity, suppression of transplant rejection.\n\n\nThe term “human binding protein” includes binding proteins having variable and constant regions corresponding substantially to human germline immunoglobulin sequences known in the art, including, for example, those described by Kabat et al. (5th ed. 1991) \nSequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest\n, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH Publication No. 91-3242. The human antibodies of the invention may include amino acid residues not encoded by human germline immunoglobulin sequences (e.g., mutations introduced by random or site-specific mutagenesis in vitro or by somatic mutation in vivo), for example, in the CDRs, and in particular, CDR3. The human antibody can have at least one, two, three, four, five, or more positions replaced with an amino acid residue that is not encoded by the human germline immunoglobulin sequence.\n\n\nThe phrases “inhibit,” “antagonize,” “block,” or “neutralize” IL-21R activity and its cognates refer to a reduction, inhibition, or otherwise diminution of at least one activity of IL-21R due to binding an anti-IL-21R antibody, wherein the reduction is relative to the activity of IL-21R in the absence of the same antibody. The IL-21R activity can be measured using any technique known in the art. Inhibition or antagonism does not necessarily indicate a total elimination of the IL-21R biological activity. A reduction in activity may be about 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, or more.\n\n\nThe terms “interleukin-21 receptor” or “IL-21R” or the like refer to a class I cytokine family receptor, also known as MU-1 (see, e.g., U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/569,384 and U.S. Application Publication Nos. 2004/0265960; 2006/0159655; 2006/0024268; and 2008/0241098), NILR or zalpha11 (see, e.g., International Application Publication No. WO 01/085792; Parrish-Novak et al. (2000) supra; Ozaki et al. (2000) supra), that binds to an IL-21 ligand. IL-21R is homologous to the shared β chain of the IL-2 and IL-15 receptors, and IL-4α (Ozaki et al. (2000) supra). Upon ligand binding, IL-21R is capable of interacting with a common gamma cytokine receptor chain (γc) and inducing the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 (Asao et al. (2001) supra) or STATS (Ozaki et al. (2000) supra). IL-21R shows widespread lymphoid tissue distribution. The terms “interleukin-21 receptor” or “IL-21R” or the like also refer to a polypeptide (preferably of mammalian origin, e.g., murine or human IL-21R) or, as context requires, a polynucleotide encoding such a polypeptide, that is capable of interacting with IL-21 (preferably IL-21 of mammalian origin, e.g., murine or human IL-21) and has at least one of the following features: (1) an amino acid sequence of a naturally occurring mammalian IL-21R polypeptide or a fragment thereof, e.g., an amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:2 (human—corresponding to GENBANK® (U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, Bethesda, Md.) Accession No. NP\n—\n068570) or SEQ ID NO:4 (murine—corresponding to GENBANK® Acc. No. NP\n—\n068687), or a fragment thereof; (2) an amino acid sequence substantially homologous to, e.g., at least 85%, 90%, 95%, 98%, or 99% homologous to, an amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:2 or SEQ ID NO:4, or a fragment thereof; (3) an amino acid sequence that is encoded by a naturally occurring mammalian IL-21R nucleotide sequence or fragment thereof (e.g., SEQ ID NO:1 (human—which comprises an open reading frame corresponding to the open reading frame of GENBANK® Accession No. NM\n—\n021798) or SEQ ID NO:3 (murine—which comprises an open reading frame corresponding to the open reading frame of GENBANK® Acc. No. NM\n—\n021887), or a fragment thereof); (4) an amino acid sequence encoded by a nucleotide sequence that is substantially homologous to, e.g., at least 85%, 90%, 95%, 98%, or 99% homologous to, a nucleotide sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:1 or SEQ ID NO:3 or a fragment thereof; (5) an amino acid sequence encoded by a nucleotide sequence degenerate to a naturally occurring IL-21R nucleotide sequence or a fragment thereof, e.g., SEQ ID NO:1 or SEQ ID NO:3, or a fragment thereof; or (6) a nucleotide sequence that hybridizes to one of the foregoing nucleotide sequences under stringent conditions, e.g., highly stringent conditions. In addition, other nonhuman and nonmammalian IL-21Rs are contemplated as useful in the disclosed methods.\n\n\nThe term “interleukin-21” or “IL-21” refers to a cytokine that shows sequence homology to IL-2, IL-4 and IL-15 (Parrish-Novak et al. (2000) supra), and binds to an IL-21R. Such cytokines share a common fold into a “four-helix-bundle” structure that is representative of the family. IL-21 is expressed primarily in activated CD4\n+\n T cells, and has been reported to have effects on NK, B and T cells (Parrish-Novak et al. (2000) supra; Kasaian et al. (2002) supra). Upon IL-21 binding to IL-21R, activation of IL-21R leads to, e.g., STAT5 or STAT3 signaling (Ozaki et al. (2000) supra). The term “interleukin-21” or “IL-21” also refers to a polypeptide (preferably of mammalian origin, e.g., murine or human IL-21), or as context requires, a polynucleotide encoding such a polypeptide, that is capable of interacting with IL-21R (preferably of mammalian origin, e.g., murine or human IL-21R) and has at least one of the following features: (1) an amino acid sequence of a naturally occurring mammalian IL-21 or a fragment thereof, e.g., an amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:212 (human), or a fragment thereof; (2) an amino acid sequence substantially homologous to, e.g., at least 85%, 90%, 95%, 98%, or 99% homologous to, an amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:212, or a fragment thereof; (3) an amino acid sequence that is encoded by a naturally occurring mammalian IL-21 nucleotide sequence or a fragment thereof (e.g., SEQ ID NO:211 (human), or a fragment thereof); (4) an amino acid sequence encoded by a nucleotide sequence that is substantially homologous to, e.g., at least 85%, 90%, 95%, 98%, or 99% homologous to, a nucleotide sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:211 or a fragment thereof; (5) an amino acid sequence encoded by a nucleotide sequence degenerate to a naturally occurring IL-21 nucleotide sequence or a fragment thereof; or (6) a nucleotide sequence that hybridizes to one of the foregoing nucleotide sequences under stringent conditions, e.g., highly stringent conditions.\n\n\nThe terms “IL-21R activity” and the like (e.g., “activity of IL-21R,” “IL-21/IL-21R activity”) refer to at least one cellular process initiated or interrupted as a result of IL-21R binding. IL-21R activities include, but are not limited to: (1) interacting with, e.g., binding to, a ligand, e.g., an IL-21 polypeptide; (2) associating with or activating signal transduction (also called “signaling,” which refers to the intracellular cascade occurring in response to a particular stimuli) and signal transduction molecules (e.g., gamma chain (γc) and JAK1), and/or stimulating the phosphorylation and/or activation of STAT proteins, e.g., STAT5 and/or STAT3; (3) modulating the proliferation, differentiation, effector cell function, cytolytic activity, cytokine secretion, and/or survival of immune cells, e.g., T cells, NK cells, B cells, macrophages, regulatory T cells (Tregs) and megakaryocytes; and (4) modulating expression of IL-21-responsive genes or cytokines, e.g., modulating IL-21 effects on the level of expression of, e.g., TNF, IFNγ, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, CD19, STAT3, ICAM-1, TBX21, CSF1, GZMB, PRF1, IL-2Rα, IL-21R, etc.\n\n\nAs used herein, “in vitro-generated antibody” refers to an antibody where all or part of the variable region (e.g., at least one CDR) is generated in a nonimmune cell selection (e.g., an in vitro phage display, protein chip, or any other method in which candidate sequences can be tested for their ability to bind to an antigen).\n\n\nThe term “isolated” refers to a molecule that is substantially free of its natural environment. For instance, an isolated protein is substantially free of cellular material or other proteins from the cell or tissue source from which it was derived. The term also refers to preparations where the isolated protein is sufficiently pure for pharmaceutical compositions, or is at least 70-80% (w/w) pure, at least 80-90% (w/w) pure, at least 90-95% (w/w) pure, or at least 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% (w/w) pure.\n\n\nThe phrase “percent identical” or “percent identity” refers to the similarity between at least two different sequences. This percent identity can be determined by standard alignment algorithms, for example, the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) described by Altshul et al. ((1990) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n215:403-10); the algorithm of Needleman et al. ((1970) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n48:444-53); or the algorithm of Meyers et al. ((1988) \nComput. Appl. Biosci. \n4:11-17). A set of parameters may be the Blosum 62 scoring matrix with a gap penalty of 12, a gap extend penalty of 4, and a frameshift gap penalty of 5. The percent identity between two amino acid or nucleotide sequences can also be determined using the algorithm of Meyers and Miller ((1989) \nCABIOS \n4:11-17), which has been incorporated into the ALIGN program (version 2.0), using a PAM120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12, and a gap penalty of 4. The percent identity is usually calculated by comparing sequences of similar length.\n\n\nThe term “repertoire” refers to at least one nucleotide sequence derived wholly or partially from at least one sequence encoding at least one immunoglobulin. The sequence(s) may be generated by rearrangement in vivo of the V, D, and J segments of heavy chains, and the V and J segments of light chains. Alternatively, the sequence(s) can be generated from a cell in response to which rearrangement occurs, e.g., in vitro stimulation. Alternatively, part or all of the sequence(s) may be obtained by DNA splicing, nucleotide synthesis, mutagenesis, or other methods (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,565,332). A repertoire may include only one sequence or may include a plurality of sequences, including ones in a genetically diverse collection.\n\n\nThe terms “specific binding,” “specifically binds,” and the like refer to two molecules forming a complex that is relatively stable under physiologic conditions. Specific binding is characterized by a high affinity and a low-to-moderate capacity as distinguished from nonspecific binding, which usually has a low affinity with a moderate-to-high capacity. Typically, binding is considered specific when the association constant Ka is higher than about 10\n6 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1\n. If necessary, nonspecific binding can be reduced without substantially affecting specific binding by varying the binding conditions. The appropriate binding conditions, such as concentration of binding protein, ionic strength of the solution, temperature, time allowed for binding, concentration of a blocking agent (e.g., serum albumin or milk casein), etc., can be improved by a skilled artisan using routine techniques. Illustrative conditions are set forth herein, but other conditions known to the person of ordinary skill in the art fall within the scope of this invention.\n\n\nAs used herein, the terms “stringent,” “stringency,” and the like describe conditions for hybridization and washing. The isolated polynucleotides of the present invention can be used as hybridization probes and primers to identify and isolate nucleic acids having sequences identical to or similar to those encoding the disclosed polynucleotides. Therefore, polynucleotides isolated in this fashion may be used to produce binding proteins against IL-21R or to identify cells expressing such binding proteins. Hybridization methods for identifying and isolating nucleic acids include polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Southern hybridizations, in situ hybridization and Northern hybridization, and are well known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\nHybridization reactions can be performed under conditions of different stringencies. The stringency of a hybridization reaction includes the difficulty with which any two nucleic acid molecules will hybridize to one another and the conditions under which they will remain hybridized. Preferably, each hybridizing polynucleotide hybridizes to its corresponding polynucleotide under reduced stringency conditions, more preferably stringent conditions, and most preferably highly stringent conditions. Stringent conditions are known to those skilled in the art and can be found in, e.g., \nCurrent Protocols in Molecular Biology\n, John Wiley & Sons, N.Y. (1989) 6.3.1-6.3.6. Both aqueous and nonaqueous methods are described in this reference, and either can be used. One example of stringent hybridization conditions is hybridization in 6× sodium chloride/sodium citrate (SSC) at about 45° C., followed by at least one wash in 0.2×SSC/0.1% SDS at 50° C. Stringent hybridization conditions are also accomplished with wash(es) in, e.g., 0.2×SSC/0.1% SDS at 55° C., 60° C., or 65° C. Highly stringent conditions include, e.g., hybridization in 0.5M sodium phosphate/7% SDS at 65° C., followed by at least one wash at 0.2×SSC/1% SDS at 65° C. Further examples of stringency conditions are shown in Table 1 below: highly stringent conditions are those that are at least as stringent as, for example, conditions A-F; stringent conditions are at least as stringent as, for example, conditions G-L; and reduced stringency conditions are at least as stringent as, for example, conditions M-R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHybridization Conditions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nHybrid\n\n\nHybridization\n\n\nWash\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCon-\n\n\n \n\n\nLength\n\n\nTemperature\n\n\nTemperature\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndition\n\n\nHybrid\n\n\n(bp)\n1\n \n\n\nand Buffer\n2\n \n\n\nand Buffer\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n\nDNA:DNA\n\n\n>50\n\n\n65° C.; 1X SSC -or-\n\n\n65° C.; 0.3X SSC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n42° C.; 1X SSC,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n50% formamide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB\n\n\nDNA:DNA\n\n\n<50\n\n\nT\nB\n*; 1X SSC\n\n\nT\nB\n*; 1X SSC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\nDNA:RNA\n\n\n>50\n\n\n67° C.; 1X SSC -or-\n\n\n67° C.; 0.3X SSC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n45° C.; 1X SSC,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n50% formamide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD\n\n\nDNA:RNA\n\n\n<50\n\n\nT\nD\n*; 1X SSC\n\n\nT\nD\n*; 1X SSC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE\n\n\nRNA:RNA\n\n\n>50\n\n\n70° C.; 1X SSC -or-\n\n\n70° C.; 0.3X SSC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n50° C.; 1X SSC,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n50% formamide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nF\n\n\nRNA:RNA\n\n\n<50\n\n\nT\nF\n*; 1X SSC\n\n\nT\nF\n*; 1X SSC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG\n\n\nDNA:DNA\n\n\n>50\n\n\n65° C.; 4X SSC -or-\n\n\n65° C.; 1X SSC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n42° C.; 4X SSC,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n50% formamide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH\n\n\nDNA:DNA\n\n\n<50\n\n\nT\nH\n*; 4X SSC\n\n\nT\nH\n*; 4X SSC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\nDNA:RNA\n\n\n>50\n\n\n67° C.; 4X SSC -or-\n\n\n67° C.; 1X SSC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n45° C.; 4X SSC,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n50% formamide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJ\n\n\nDNA:RNA\n\n\n<50\n\n\nT\nJ\n*; 4X SSC\n\n\nT\nJ\n*; 4X SSC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nK\n\n\nRNA:RNA\n\n\n>50\n\n\n70° C.; 4X SSC -or-\n\n\n67° C.; 1X SSC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n50° C.; 4X SSC,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n50% formamide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL\n\n\nRNA:RNA\n\n\n<50\n\n\nT\nL\n*; 2X SSC\n\n\nT\nL\n*; 2X SSC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM\n\n\nDNA:DNA\n\n\n>50\n\n\n50° C.; 4X SSC -or-\n\n\n50° C.; 2X SSC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n40° C.; 6X SSC,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n50% formamide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN\n\n\nDNA:DNA\n\n\n<50\n\n\nT\nN\n*; 6X SSC\n\n\nT\nN\n*; 6X SSC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO\n\n\nDNA:RNA\n\n\n>50\n\n\n55° C.; 4X SSC -or-\n\n\n55° C.; 2X SSC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n42° C.; 6X SSC,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n50% formamide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP\n\n\nDNA:RNA\n\n\n<50\n\n\nT\nP\n*; 6X SSC\n\n\nT\nP\n*; 6X SSC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ\n\n\nRNA:RNA\n\n\n>50\n\n\n60° C.; 4X SSC -or-\n\n\n60° C.; 2X SSC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n45° C.; 6X SSC,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n50% formamide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\nRNA:RNA\n\n\n<50\n\n\nT\nR\n*; 4X SSC\n\n\nT\nR\n*; 4X SSC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n1\nThe hybrid length is that anticipated for the hybridized region(s) of the hybridizing polynucleotides. When hybridizing a polynucleotide to a target polynucleotide of unknown sequence, the hybrid length is assumed to be that of the hybridizing polynucleotide. When polynucleotides of known sequence are hybridized, the hybrid length can be determined by aligning the sequences of the polynucleotides and identifying the region or regions of optimal sequence complementarity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n2\nSSPE (1xSSPE is 0.15M NaCl, 10 mM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, and 1.25 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) can be substituted for SSC (1xSSC is 0.15M NaCl and 15 mM sodium citrate) in the hybridization and wash buffers; washes are performed for 15 min after hybridization is complete.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT\nB\n*-T\nR\n* The hybridization temperature for hybrids anticipated to be less than 50 base pairs in length should be 5-10° C. less than the melting temperature (T\nm\n) of the hybrid, where T\nm \nis determined according to the following equations. For hybrids less than 18 base pairs in length, T\nm\n(° C.) = 2(# of A + T bases) + 4(# of G + C bases). For hybrids between 18 and 49 base pairs in length, T\nm\n(° C.) = 81.5 + 16.6(log\n10\nNa\n+\n) + 0.41(% G + C) − (600/N), where N is the number of bases in the hybrid, and Na\n+\n is the concentration of sodium ions in the hybridization buffer (Na\n+\n for 1X SSC = 0.165 M).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional examples of stringency conditions for polynucleotide hybridization are provided in Sambrook et al. (1989) Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Chs. 9 & 11, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, and Ausubel et al. eds. (1995) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology Sects. 2.10 & 6.3-6.4 John Wiley & Sons, Inc., herein incorporated by reference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe isolated polynucleotides of the present invention may be used as hybridization probes and primers to identify and isolate DNAs having sequences encoding allelic variants of the disclosed polynucleotides. Allelic variants are naturally occurring alternative forms of the disclosed polynucleotides that encode polypeptides that are identical to or have significant similarity to the polypeptides encoded by the disclosed polynucleotides. Preferably, allelic variants have at least about 90% sequence identity (more preferably, at least about 95% identity; most preferably, at least about 99% identity) with the disclosed polynucleotides. The isolated polynucleotides of the present invention may also be used as hybridization probes and primers to identify and isolate DNAs having sequences encoding polypeptides homologous to the disclosed polynucleotides. These homologs are polynucleotides and polypeptides isolated from a different species than that of the disclosed polypeptides and polynucleotides, or within the same species, but with significant sequence similarity to the disclosed polynucleotides and polypeptides. Preferably, polynucleotide homologs have at least about 50% sequence identity (more preferably, at least about 75% identity; most preferably, at least about 90% identity) with the disclosed polynucleotides, whereas polypeptide homologs have at least about 30% sequence identity (more preferably, at least about 45% identity; most preferably, at least about 60% identity) with the disclosed binding proteins/polypeptides. Preferably, homologs of the disclosed polynucleotides and polypeptides are those isolated from mammalian species. The isolated polynucleotides of the present invention may additionally be used as hybridization probes and primers to identify cells and tissues that express the binding proteins of the present invention and the conditions under which they are expressed.\n\n\nThe phrases “substantially as set out,” “substantially identical,” and “substantially homologous” mean that the relevant amino acid or nucleotide sequence (e.g., CDR(s), V\nH\n, or V\nL \ndomain(s)) will be identical to or have insubstantial differences (e.g., through conserved amino acid substitutions) in comparison to the sequences which are set out. Insubstantial differences include minor amino acid changes, such as one or two substitutions in a five amino acid sequence of a specified region. In the case of antibodies, the second antibody has the same specificity and has at least about 50% of the affinity of the first antibody.\n\n\nSequences substantially identical or homologous to the sequences disclosed herein are also part of this application. In some embodiments, the sequence identity can be about 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or higher. Alternatively, substantial identity or homology exists when the nucleic acid segments will hybridize under selective hybridization conditions (e.g., highly stringent hybridization conditions), to the complement of the strand. The nucleic acids may be present in whole cells, in a cell lysate, or in a partially purified or substantially pure form.\n\n\nThe term “therapeutic agent” or the like is a substance that treats or assists in treating a medical disorder or symptoms thereof. Therapeutic agents may include, but are not limited to, substances that modulate immune cells or immune responses in a manner that complements the use of anti-IL-21R binding proteins. In one embodiment of the invention, a therapeutic agent is a therapeutic antibody, e.g., an anti-IL-21R antibody. In another embodiment of the invention, a therapeutic agent is a therapeutic binding protein, e.g., an anti-IL-21R nanobody. Nonlimiting examples and uses of therapeutic agents are described herein.\n\n\nAs used herein, a “therapeutically effective amount” of an anti-IL-21R binding protein (e.g., an antibody) refers to an amount of the binding protein that is effective, upon single or multiple dose administration to a subject (such as a human patient) for treating, preventing, curing, delaying, reducing the severity of, and/or ameliorating at least one symptom of a disorder or a recurring disorder, or prolonging the survival of the subject beyond that expected in the absence of such treatment. In one embodiment, a therapeutically effective amount may be an amount of an anti-IL-21R binding protein that is sufficient to modulate expression of at least one IL-21-responsive cytokine or gene.\n\n\nThe term “treatment” refers to a therapeutic or preventative measure. The treatment may be administered to a subject having a medical disorder or who ultimately may acquire the disorder, in order to prevent, cure, delay, reduce the severity of, and/or ameliorate one or more symptoms of a disorder or a recurring disorder, or in order to prolong the survival of a subject beyond that expected in the absence of such treatment.\n\n\nAnti-IL-21R Binding Proteins\n\n\nThe disclosure of the present application provides novel anti-IL-21R binding proteins that comprise novel antigen-binding fragments. Numerous methods known to those skilled in the art are available for obtaining binding proteins or antigen-binding fragments thereof. For example, anti-IL-21R binding proteins that comprise antibodies can be produced using recombinant DNA methods (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567). Monoclonal antibodies may also be produced by generation of hybridomas in accordance with known methods (see, e.g., Kohler and Milstein (1975) \nNature \n256:495-99). Hybridomas formed in this manner are then screened using standard methods, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and surface plasmon resonance (BIACORE™) analysis, to identify one or more hybridomas that produce an antibody that specifically binds with a particular antigen. Any form of the specified antigen may be used as the immunogen, e.g., recombinant antigen, naturally occurring forms, any variants or fragments thereof, and antigenic peptides thereof.\n\n\nOne exemplary method of making binding proteins that comprise antibodies includes screening protein expression libraries, e.g., phage or ribosome display libraries. Phage display is described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,223,409; Smith (1985) \nScience \n228:1315-17; Clackson et al. (1991) \nNature \n352:624-28; Marks et al. (1991) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n222:581-97; and International Application Publication Nos. WO 92/018619; WO 91/017271; WO 92/020791; WO 92/015679; WO 93/001288; WO 92/001047; WO 92/009690; and WO 90/002809.\n\n\nIn addition to the use of display libraries, the specified antigen can be used to immunize a nonhuman animal, e.g., a cynomolgus monkey, a chicken, or a rodent (e.g., a mouse, hamster, or rat). In one embodiment, the nonhuman animal includes at least a part of a human immunoglobulin gene. For example, it is possible to engineer mouse strains deficient in mouse antibody production with large fragments of the human Ig loci. Using the hybridoma technology, antigen-specific monoclonal binding proteins, such as antibodies, derived from the genes with the desired specificity may be produced and selected (see, e.g., XENOMOUSE™ (Amgen, Inc., Thousand Oaks, Calif.); Green et al. (1994) \nNat. Genet. \n7:13-21; U.S. Pat. No. 7,064,244; and International Application Publication Nos. WO 96/034096 and WO 96/033735).\n\n\nIn one embodiment of the invention, the binding proteins is a monoclonal antibody that is obtained from a nonhuman animal, and then modified (e.g., humanized, deimmunized, or chimeric) using recombinant DNA techniques known in the art. A variety of approaches for making chimeric antibodies have been described (see, e.g., Morrison et al. (1985) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n81(21):6851-55; Takeda et al. (1985) \nNature \n314(6010):452-54; U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,816,567 and 4,816,397; European Application Publication Nos. \nEP\n 0 171 496 and \nEP\n 0 173 494; and United Kingdom Patent No. \nGB\n 2 177 096). Humanized binding proteins may also be produced, for example, using transgenic mice that express human heavy and light chain genes, but are incapable of expressing the endogenous mouse immunoglobulin heavy and light chain genes. Winter (U.S. Pat. No. 5,225,539) describes an exemplary CDR-grafting method that may be used to prepare the humanized binding proteins described herein. All of the CDRs of a particular human binding protein may be replaced with at least a portion of a nonhuman CDR, or only some of the CDRs may be replaced with nonhuman CDRs. It is only necessary to replace the number of CDRs required for binding of the humanized binding protein to a predetermined antigen.\n\n\nHumanized binding proteins or fragments thereof can be generated by replacing sequences of the Fv variable domain that are not directly involved in antigen binding with equivalent sequences from human Fv variable domains. Exemplary methods for generating humanized binding proteins or fragments thereof are provided by, e.g., Morrison (1985) \nScience \n229:1202-07; Oi et al. (1986) \nBioTechniques \n4:214; and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,585,089; 5,693,761; 5,693,762; 5,859,205; and 6,407,213. Those methods include isolating, manipulating, and expressing the nucleic acid sequences that encode all or part of immunoglobulin Fv variable domains from at least one of a heavy or light chain. Such nucleic acids may be obtained from a hybridoma producing an antibody against a predetermined target, as described above, as well as from other sources. The recombinant DNA encoding the humanized antibody molecule can then be cloned into an appropriate expression vector.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, a humanized binding protein is improved by the introduction of conservative substitutions, consensus sequence substitutions, germline substitutions and/or backmutations. Such altered immunoglobulin molecules can be made by any of several techniques known in the art, (see, e.g., Teng et al. (1983) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n80:7308-73; Kozbor et al. (1983) \nImmunol. Today \n4:7279; Olsson et al. (1982) \nMeth. Enzymol. \n92:3-16); International Application Publication No. WO 92/006193; and European Patent No. \nEP\n 0 239 400).\n\n\nA binding protein or fragment thereof may also be modified by specific deletion of human T cell epitopes or “deimmunization” by the methods disclosed in, e.g., International Application Publication Nos. WO 98/052976 and WO 00/034317. Briefly, the heavy and light chain variable domains of a binding protein (such as, for example, a binding protein derived from an antibody) can be analyzed for peptides that bind to MHC Class II; these peptides represent potential T cell epitopes (as defined in, e.g., International Application Publication Nos. WO 98/052976 and WO 00/034317). For detection of potential T cell epitopes, a computer modeling approach termed “peptide threading” can be applied, and in addition a database of human MHC class II binding peptides can be searched for motifs present in the V\nH \nand V\nL \nsequences, as described in International Application Publication Nos. WO 98/052976 and WO 00/034317. These motifs bind to any of the 18 major MHC Class II DR allotypes and thus, constitute potential T cell epitopes. Potential T cell epitopes detected can be eliminated by substituting small numbers of amino acid residues in the variable domains or by single amino acid substitutions. Typically, conservative substitutions are made. Often, but not exclusively, an amino acid common to a position in human germline antibody sequences may be used. Human germline sequences are disclosed in, e.g., Tomlinson et al. (1992) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n227:776-98; Cook et al. (1995) \nImmunol. Today \n16(5):237-42; Chothia et al. (1992) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n227:799-817; and Tomlinson et al. (1995) \nEMBO J. \n14:4628-38. The V BASE directory provides a comprehensive directory of human immunoglobulin variable region sequences (compiled by Tomlinson et al., MRC Centre for Protein Engineering, Cambridge, UK). These sequences can be used as a source of human sequence, e.g., for framework regions and CDRs. Consensus human framework regions can also be used, as described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,300,064.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, a binding protein can contain an altered immunoglobulin constant or Fc region. For example, binding proteins produced in accordance with the teachings herein may bind more strongly or with more specificity to effector molecules such as complement and/or Fc receptors, which can control several immune functions of the binding protein such as effector cell activity, lysis, complement-mediated activity, binding protein clearance, and binding protein half-life. Typical Fc receptors that bind to an Fc region of a binding protein (e.g., an IgG antibody) include, but are not limited to, receptors of the FcγRI, FcγRII, and FcRn subclasses, including allelic variants and alternatively spliced forms of these receptors. Fc receptors are reviewed in, e.g., Ravetch and Kinet (1991) \nAnnu. Rev. Immunol. \n9:457-92; Capel et al. (1994) \nImmunomethods \n4:25-34; and de Haas et al. (1995) \nJ. Lab. Clin. Med. \n126:330-41. For additional binding protein/antibody production techniques, see, e.g., \nAntibodies: A Laboratory Manual \n(1988) Harlow et al. eds., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. The present invention is not necessarily limited to any particular source, method of production, or other special characteristic of a binding protein or an antibody.\n\n\nBinding proteins comprising antibodies (immunoglobulins) are typically tetrameric glycosylated proteins composed of two light (L) chains of approximately 25 kDa each and two heavy (H) chains of approximately 50 kDa each. Two types of light chains, termed lambda (λ) and kappa (κ), may be found in antibodies. Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of heavy chains, immunoglobulins can be assigned to five major classes: A, D, E, G, and M, and several of these may be further divided into subclasses (isotypes), e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1, and IgA2. Each light chain includes an N-terminal variable (V) domain (V\nL\n) and a constant (C) domain (C\nL\n). Each heavy chain includes an N-terminal V domain (V\nH\n), three or four C domains (C\nH\ns), and a hinge region. The C\nH \ndomain most proximal to V\nH \nis designated as \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1. The V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains consist of four regions of relatively conserved sequences called framework regions (FR1, FR2, FR3, and FR4) that form a scaffold for three regions of hypervariable sequences, called CDRs. The CDRs contain most of the residues responsible for specific interactions of the antibody with the antigen. CDRs are referred to as CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3. CDR constituents on the heavy chain are referred to as H1, H2, and H3 (also referred to herein as CDR H1, CDR H2, and CDR H3, respectively), while CDR constituents on the light chain are referred to as L1, L2, and L3 (also referred to herein as CDR L1, CDR L2, and CDR L3, respectively).\n\n\nCDR3 is typically the greatest source of molecular diversity within the antigen-binding site. CDR H3, for example, can be as short as two amino acid residues or greater than 26 amino acids. The subunit structures and three-dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known in the art. For a review of antibody structure, see, e.g., Harlow et al. (1988) supra. One of skill in the art will recognize that each subunit structure, e.g., a C\nH\n, V\nH\n, C\nL\n, V\nL\n, CDR, and/or FR structure, comprises active fragments, e.g., the portion of the V\nH\n, V\nL\n, or CDR subunit that binds to the antigen, i.e., the antigen-binding fragment, or, e.g., the portion of the C\nH \nsubunit that binds to and/or activates, e.g., an Fc receptor and/or complement. The CDRs typically refer to the Kabat CDRs (as described in Kabat et al. (1991) supra). Another standard for characterizing the antigen-binding site is to refer to the hypervariable loops as described in, e.g., Chothia et al. (1992) supra and Tomlinson et al. (1995) supra. Still another standard is the “AbM” definition used by Oxford Molecular's AbM antibody modeling software (see, generally, e.g., \nProtein Sequence and Structure Analysis of Antibody Variable Domains \nin: \nAntibody Engineering \n(2001) Duebel and Kontermann eds., Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg). Embodiments described with respect to Kabat CDRs can alternatively be implemented using similar described relationships with respect to Chothia hypervariable loops or to the AbM-defined loops.\n\n\nThe Fab fragment consists of V\nH\n-\nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 and V\nL\n-C\nL \ndomains covalently linked by a disulfide bond between the constant regions. The F\nv \nfragment is smaller and consists of V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains noncovalently linked. To overcome the tendency of noncovalently linked domains to dissociate, an scFv can be constructed. The scFv contains a flexible polypeptide that links (1) the C-terminus of V\nH \nto the N-terminus of V\nL\n, or (2) the C-terminus of V\nL \nto the N-terminus of V\nH\n. A 15-mer (Gly\n4\nSer)\n3 \npeptide, for example, may be used as a linker, but other linkers are known in the art.\n\n\nThe sequence of antibody genes after assembly and somatic mutation is highly varied, and these varied genes are estimated to encode 10\n10 \ndifferent antibody molecules (\nImmunoglobulin Genes \n(2nd ed. 1995) Jonio et al. eds., Academic Press, San Diego, Calif.).\n\n\nIn certain embodiments of the invention, the binding protein is a single domain binding protein. Single domain binding proteins include binding proteins wherein the CDRs are part of a single domain polypeptide. Examples include, but are not limited to, heavy chain binding proteins, binding proteins that are naturally devoid of light chains, single domain binding proteins derived from conventional four-chain antibodies, engineered binding proteins, and single domain protein scaffolds other than those derived from antibodies. Single domain binding proteins include any known in the art, as well as any future-determined or -learned single domain binding proteins.\n\n\nSingle domain binding proteins may be derived from any species including, but not limited to, mouse, human, camel, llama, fish, shark, goat, rabbit, chicken, and bovine. In one aspect of the invention, the single domain binding protein can be derived from a variable region of the immunoglobulin found in fish, such as, for example, that which is derived from the immunoglobulin isotype known as Novel Antigen Receptor (NAR) found in the serum of shark. Methods of producing single domain binding proteins derived from a variable region of NAR (IgNARs) are described in, e.g., International Application Publication No. WO 03/014161 and Streltsov (2005) \nProtein Sci. \n14:2901-09. Single domain binding proteins also include naturally occurring single domain binding proteins known in the art as heavy chain antibodies devoid of light chains. This variable domain derived from a heavy chain antibody naturally devoid of a light chain is known herein as a VHH, or a nanobody, to distinguish it from the conventional V\nH \nof four-chain immunoglobulins. Such a VHH molecule can be derived from antibodies raised in Camelidae species, for example, in camel, llama, dromedary, alpaca, and guanaco, and is sometimes called a camelid or camelized variable domain (see, e.g., Muyldermans (2001) \nJ. Biotechnol. \n74(4):277-302, incorporated herein by reference). Other species besides those in the family Camelidae may also produce heavy chain binding proteins naturally devoid of light chains. VHH molecules are about ten times smaller than IgG molecules. They are single polypeptides and are very stable, resisting extreme pH and temperature conditions. Moreover, they are resistant to the actions of proteases, which is not the case for conventional antibodies. Furthermore, in vitro expression of VHHs can produce high-yield, properly folded functional VHHs. In addition, binding proteins generated in camelids will recognize epitopes other than those recognized by antibodies generated in vitro via antibody libraries or via immunization of mammals other than camelids (see, e.g., International Application Publication Nos. WO 97/049805 and WO 94/004678, which are incorporated herein by reference).\n\n\nA “bispecific” or “bifunctional” binding protein is an artificial hybrid binding protein having two different heavy/light chain pairs and two different binding sites. Bispecific binding proteins can be produced by a variety of methods including fusion of hybridomas or linking of Fab′ fragments (see, e.g., Songsivilai and Lachmann (1990) \nClin. Exp. Immunol. \n79:315-21; Kostelny et al. (1992) \nJ. Immunol. \n148:1547-53). In one embodiment, the bispecific binding protein comprises a first binding domain polypeptide, such as a Fab′ fragment, linked via an immunoglobulin constant region to a second binding domain polypeptide.\n\n\nAnother binding protein according to the invention can comprise, for example, a binding domain-immunoglobulin fusion protein that includes a binding domain polypeptide that is fused or otherwise connected to an immunoglobulin hinge or hinge-acting region polypeptide, which in turn is fused or otherwise connected to a region comprising one or more native or engineered constant regions from an immunoglobulin heavy chain, other than \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1, for example, the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n2 and \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 regions of IgG and IgA1 or the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 and \nC\n \n \n \nH\n4 regions of IgE (see, e.g., U.S. Application Publication No. 2005/0136049, which is incorporated by reference herein, for a more complete description). The binding domain-immunoglobulin fusion protein can further include a region that includes a native or engineered immunoglobulin \nheavy chain C\n \n \n \nH\n2 constant region polypeptide (or \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 in the case of a construct derived in whole or in part from IgE) that is fused or otherwise connected to the hinge region polypeptide and a native or engineered immunoglobulin \nheavy chain C\n \n \n \nH\n3 constant region polypeptide (or \nC\n \n \n \nH\n4 in the case of a construct derived in whole or in part from IgE) that is fused or otherwise connected to the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n2 constant region polypeptide (or \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 in the case of a construct derived in whole or in part from IgE). Typically, such binding domain-immunoglobulin fusion proteins are capable of at least one immunological activity selected from the group consisting of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement fixation, and/or binding to a target, for example, a target antigen, such as human IL-21R.\n\n\nBinding proteins of the invention can also comprise peptide mimetics. Peptide mimetics are peptide-containing molecules that mimic elements of protein secondary structure (see, for example, Johnson et al. \nPeptide Turn Mimetics in Biotechnology and Pharmacy \n(1993), Pezzuto et al. eds., Chapman and Hall, New York, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety). The underlying rationale behind the use of peptide mimetics is that the peptide backbone of proteins exists chiefly to orient amino acid side chains in such a way as to facilitate molecular interactions, such as those between antibody and antigen. A peptide mimetic is expected to permit molecular interactions similar to the natural molecule. These principles may be used to engineer second generation molecules having many of the natural properties of the targeting peptides disclosed herein, but with altered and potentially improved characteristics.\n\n\nOther embodiments of binding proteins useful for practicing the invention include fusion proteins. These molecules generally have all or a substantial portion of a targeting peptide, for example, IL-21R or an anti IL-21R antibody, linked at the N- or C-terminus, to all or a portion of a second polypeptide or protein. For example, fusion proteins may employ leader (or signal) sequences from other species to permit the recombinant expression of a protein in a heterologous host. For example, amino acid sequences, or nucleic acid sequences encoding amino acid sequences, of the binding proteins and antigen-binding fragments thereof of the present invention comprising leader (or signal) sequence may be selected from SEQ ID NOs:87-109 and 239-248. Another useful fusion includes the addition of an immunologically active domain, such as a binding protein epitope, to facilitate purification of the fusion protein. Inclusion of a cleavage site at or near the fusion junction will facilitate removal of the extraneous polypeptide after purification. Other useful fusions include the linking of functional domains, such as active sites from enzymes, glycosylation domains, cellular targeting signals, or transmembrane regions. Examples of proteins or peptides that may be incorporated into a fusion protein include, but are not limited to, cytostatic proteins, cytocidal proteins, pro-apoptosis agents, anti-angiogenic agents, hormones, cytokines, growth factors, peptide drugs, antibodies, Fab fragments of antibodies, antigens, receptor proteins, enzymes, lectins, MHC proteins, cell adhesion proteins, and binding proteins. Methods of generating fusion proteins are well known to those of skill in the art. Such proteins can be produced, for example, by chemical attachment using bifunctional cross-linking reagents, by de novo synthesis of the complete fusion protein, or by attachment of a DNA sequence encoding the targeting peptide to a DNA sequence encoding the second peptide or protein, followed by expression of the intact fusion protein.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the targeting peptide, for example, IL-21R, is fused with an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region, such as an Fc fragment, which contains two constant region domains and a hinge region, but lacks the variable region (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,018,026 and 5,750,375, incorporated by reference herein). The Fc region may be a naturally occurring Fc region, or may be altered to improve certain qualities, e.g., therapeutic qualities, circulation time, reduced aggregation. Peptides and proteins fused to an Fc region typically exhibit a greater half-life in vivo than the unfused counterpart does. In addition, a fusion to an Fc region permits dimerization/multimerization of the fusion polypeptide.\n\n\nOne aspect of the present invention comprises binding proteins and antigen-binding fragments thereof that bind IL-21R. The disclosure provides novel CDRs that have been derived from human immunoglobulin gene libraries. The protein structure that is generally used to carry a CDR is an antibody heavy or light chain or a portion thereof, wherein the CDR is localized to a region associated with a naturally occurring CDR. The structures and locations of variable domains may be determined as described in Kabat et al. ((1991) supra).\n\n\nIllustrative embodiments of the binding proteins (and antigen-binding fragments thereof) of the invention are identified as AbA-AbU, H3-H6, L1-L6, L8-L21, and L23-L25. DNA and amino acid sequences of the nonlimiting illustrative embodiments of the anti-IL-21R binding proteins of the invention are set forth in SEQ ID NOs:5-195, 213-229, and 239-248.

thereof. For example, a V\nL \ndomain may be attached at its C-terminal end to a light chain constant domain like Cκ or Cλ. Similarly, a V\nH \ndomain, or portion thereof, may be attached to all or part of a heavy chain like IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and any isotype subclass. Constant regions are known in the art (see, e.g., Kabat et al. (1991) supra). Therefore, binding proteins within the scope of this invention include V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains, or portions thereof, combined with constant regions known in the art.\n\n\nCertain embodiments comprise a V\nH \ndomain, a V\nL \ndomain, or a combination thereof, of the Fv fragment from AbA-AbZ, H3-H6, L1-L6, L8-L21, and/or L23-L25. Further embodiments comprise one, two, three, four, five or six CDRs from the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains. Binding proteins whose CDR sequence(s) are the same as, or similar to (i.e., differ insubstantially from), one or more CDR sequence(s) present within the sequences set forth in SEQ ID NOs:5-195, 213-229, and 239-248 are encompassed within the scope of the invention.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the V\nH \nand/or V\nL \ndomains may be germlined, i.e., the FR of these domains are mutated using conventional molecular biology techniques to match those produced by the germline cells. In other embodiments, the FR sequences remain diverged from the consensus germline sequences.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, mutagenesis is used to make a binding protein more similar to one or more germline sequences. This may be desirable when mutations are introduced into the FR of a binding protein (e.g., an antibody) through somatic mutagenesis or through error prone PCR. Germline sequences for the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains can be identified by performing amino acid and nucleic acid sequence alignments against the VBASE database (MRC Center for Protein Engineering, UK). VBASE is a comprehensive directory of all human germline variable region sequences compiled from over a thousand published sequences, including those in the current releases of the GENBANK® and EMBL data libraries. In some embodiments, the FRs of scFvs are mutated in conformity with the closest matches in the VBASE database and the CDR portions are kept intact.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, binding proteins of the invention specifically react with an epitope that is the same as the epitope recognized by AbA-AbZ, H3-H6, L1-L6, L8-L21, or L23-L25, such that they competitively inhibit the binding of AbA-AbZ, H3-H6, L1-L6, L8-L21, or L23-L25 to human IL-21R. Such binding proteins can be determined in competitive binding assays. In one embodiment, the association constant (K\nA\n) of these binding proteins for human IL-21R is at least 10\n5 \nM\n−1\ns\n−1\n. The binding affinity may be determined using techniques known in the art, such as ELISA, biosensor technology (such as biospecific interaction analysis) or other techniques, including those described in this application.\n\n\nIt is contemplated that binding proteins of the invention may bind other proteins, such as, for example, recombinant proteins comprising all or a portion of IL-21R.\n\n\nOne of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the disclosed binding proteins may be used to detect, measure, and/or inhibit proteins that differ somewhat from IL-21R. For example, these proteins may be homologs of IL-21R. Anti-IL-21R binding proteins are expected to bind proteins that comprise a sequence that is at least about 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, or more identical to any sequence of at least 100, 80, 60, 40, or 20 contiguous amino acids in the sequence set forth SEQ ID NOs:2 or 4.\n\n\nIn addition to sequence homology analyses, epitope mapping (see, e.g., \nEpitope Mapping Protocols \n(1996) Morris ed., Humana Press), and secondary and tertiary structure analyses can be carried out to identify specific 3D structures assumed by the presently disclosed binding proteins and their complexes with antigens. Such methods include, but are not limited to, x-ray crystallography (Engstom (1974) \nBiochem. Exp. Biol. \n11:7-13) and computer modeling of virtual representations of the present binding proteins (Fletterick et al. (1986) \nComputer Graphics and Molecular Modeling, in Current Communications in Molecular Biology\n, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.).\n\n\nThe disclosure provides a method for obtaining anti-IL-21R binding proteins. The method comprises creating binding proteins with V\nH \nand/or V\nL \nsequence(s) that are altered from those sequences disclosed herein. Such binding proteins may be derived by a skilled artisan using techniques known in the art. For example, amino acid substitutions, deletions, or additions can be introduced in FR and/or CDR regions. FR changes are usually designed to improve the stability and immunogenicity of the binding protein, while CDR changes are typically designed to increase a binding protein's affinity for its antigen. The changes that increase affinity may be tested by altering one or more CDR sequences and measuring the affinity of the binding protein for its target (see, e.g., \nAntibody Engineering \n(2nd ed. 1995) Borrebaeck ed., Oxford University Press).\n\n\nBinding proteins whose CDR sequences differ insubstantially from those set forth in or included within the sequences of SEQ ID NOs:5-195, 213-229, and 239-248 are encompassed within the scope of this invention. Typically, such an insubstantial difference(s) involves substitution of an amino acid with an amino acid having similar charge, hydrophobicity, or stereochemical characteristics. More drastic substitutions in FR regions, in contrast to CDR regions, may also be made as long as they do not adversely affect (e.g., reduce affinity by more than 50% as compared to the unsubstituted binding protein) the binding properties of the binding protein. Substitutions may also be made to germline the binding protein or stabilize its antigen-binding site.\n\n\nConservative modifications will produce molecules having functional and chemical characteristics similar to those of the molecule from which such modifications are made. In contrast, substantial modifications in the functional and/or chemical characteristics of the molecules may be accomplished by selecting substitutions in the amino acid sequence that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining (1) the structure of the molecular backbone in the area of the substitution, for example, as a sheet or helical conformation, (2) the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site, and/or (3) the size of the molecule.\n\n\nFor example, a “conservative amino acid substitution” may involve a substitution of a native amino acid residue with a normative residue such that there is little or no effect on the polarity or charge of the amino acid residue at that position (see, e.g., MacLennan et al. (1998) \nActa Physiol. Scand. Suppl. \n643:55-67; Sasaki et al. (1998) \nAdv. Biophys. \n35:1-24).\n\n\nDesired amino acid substitutions (whether conservative or nonconservative) can be determined by those skilled in the art at the time such substitutions are desired. For example, amino acid substitutions can be used to identify important residues of the molecule sequence, or to increase or decrease the affinity of the molecules described herein. Exemplary amino acid substitutions include, but are not limited to, those set forth in Table 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExemplary Amino Acid Substitutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOriginal\n\n\nExemplary\n\n\nMore Conservative\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nResidues\n\n\nSubstitutions\n\n\nSubstitutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAla (A)\n\n\nVal, Leu, Ile\n\n\nVal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nArg (R)\n\n\nLys, Gln, Asn\n\n\nLys\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAsn (N)\n\n\nGln\n\n\nGln\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAsp (D)\n\n\nGlu\n\n\nGlu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCys (C)\n\n\nSer, Ala\n\n\nSer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGln (Q)\n\n\nAsn\n\n\nAsn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGly (G)\n\n\nPro, Ala\n\n\nAla\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHis (H)\n\n\nAsn, Gln, Lys, Arg\n\n\nArg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIle (I)\n\n\nLeu, Val, Met, Ala, Phe,\n\n\nLeu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNorleucine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLeu (L)\n\n\nNorleucine, Ile, Val, Met,\n\n\nIle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAla, Phe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLys (K)\n\n\nArg, 1,4-diamino-butyric\n\n\nArg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nacid, Gln, Asn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMet (M)\n\n\nLeu, Phe, Ile\n\n\nLeu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPhe (F)\n\n\nLeu, Val, Ile, Ala, Tyr\n\n\nLeu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPro (P)\n\n\nAla, Gly\n\n\nGly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSer (S)\n\n\nThr, Ala, Cys\n\n\nThr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThr (T)\n\n\nSer\n\n\nSer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTrp (W)\n\n\nTyr, Phe\n\n\nTyr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTyr (Y)\n\n\nTrp, Phe, Thr, Ser\n\n\nPhe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nVal (V)\n\n\nIle, Met, Leu, Phe, Ala,\n\n\nLeu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNorleucine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, conservative amino acid substitutions also encompass nonnaturally occurring amino acid residues that are typically incorporated by chemical peptide synthesis rather than by synthesis in biological systems.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the method for making a variant V\nH \ndomain comprises adding, deleting, or substituting at least one amino acid in the disclosed V\nH \ndomains, or combining the disclosed V\nH \ndomains with at least one V\nL \ndomain, and testing the variant V\nH \ndomain for IL-21R binding or modulation of IL-21R/IL-21 activity.\n\n\nAn analogous method for making a variant V\nL \ndomain comprises adding, deleting, or substituting at least one amino acid in the disclosed V\nL \ndomains, or combining the disclosed V\nL \ndomains with at least one V\nH \ndomain, and testing the variant V\nL \ndomain for IL-21R binding or modulation of IL-21R activity.\n\n\nIn some alternative embodiments, the anti-IL-21R binding proteins can be linked to a protein (e.g., albumin) by chemical cross-linking or recombinant methods. The disclosed binding proteins may also be linked to a variety of nonproteinaceous polymers (e.g., polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, or polyoxyalkylenes) in manners set forth in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,640,835; 4,496,689; 4,301,144; 4,670,417; 4,791,192; and 4,179,337. The binding proteins can be chemically modified by covalent conjugation to a polymer, for example, to increase their half-life in blood circulation. Exemplary polymers and attachment methods are shown in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,766,106; 4,179,337; 4,495,285; and 4,609,546.\n\n\nThe disclosed binding proteins can be modified to alter their glycosylation; that is, at least one carbohydrate moiety can be deleted or added to the binding protein. Deletion or addition of glycosylation sites can be accomplished by changing amino acid sequence to delete or create glycosylation consensus sites, which are well known in the art. Another means of adding carbohydrate moieties is the chemical or enzymatic coupling of glycosides to amino acid residues of the binding protein, e.g., antibody (see, e.g., International Application Publication No. WO 87/05330 and Aplin et al. (1981) \nCRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. \n22:259-306). Removal of carbohydrate moieties can also be accomplished chemically or enzymatically (see, e.g., Hakimuddin et al. (1987) \nArch. Biochem. Biophys. \n259:52; Edge et al. (1981) \nAnal. Biochem. \n118:131; and Thotakura et al. (1987) \nMeth. Enzymol. \n138:350). Modification of carbohydrate structures may be preferable as amino acid changes in the Fc domain may enhance immunogenicity of a pharmaceutical composition (see, e.g., International Application Publication No. WO 2008/052030). For immunoglobulin molecules it has been demonstrated that attachment of N-linked carbohydrate to Asn-297 of the CH2 domain is critical for ADCC activity. Its removal enzymatically or through mutation of the N-linked consensus site results in little to no ADCC activity. In glycoproteins, carbohydrates may attach to the amide nitrogen atom in the side chain of an asparagine in a tripeptide motif Asn-X-Thr/Ser. This type of glycosylation, termed N-linked glycosylation, commences in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with the addition of multiple monosaccharides to a dolichol phosphate to form a 14-residue branched carbohydrate complex. This carbohydrate complex is then transferred to the protein by the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex. Before the glycoprotein leaves the lumen of the ER, three glucose molecules are removed from the 14-residue oligosaccharide. The enzymes ER glucosidase I, ER glucosidase II and ER mannosidase are involved in ER processing. Subsequently, the polypeptides are transported to the Golgi complex, where the N-linked sugar chains are modified in many different ways. In the cis and medial compartments of the Golgi complex, the original 14-saccharide N-linked complex may be trimmed through removal of mannose (Man) residues and elongated through addition of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNac) and/or fucose (Fuc) residues. The various forms of N-linked carbohydrates generally have in common a pentasaccharide core consisting of three mannose and two N-acetylglucosamine residues. Finally, in the trans Golgi, other GlcNac residues can be added, followed by galactose (Gal) and a terminal sialic acid (Sial). Carbohydrate processing in the Golgi complex is called “terminal glycosylation” to distinguish it from “core glycosylation,” which takes place in the ER. The final complex carbohydrate units can take on many forms and structures, some of which have two, three or four branches (termed biantennary, triantennary or tetraantennary). A number of enzymes are involved in Golgi processing, including Golgi mannosidases IA, IB and IC, GlcNAc-transferase I, Golgi mannosidase II, GlcNAc-transferase II, galactosyl transferase and sialyl transferase.\n\n\nMethods for altering the constant region of a binding protein (such as, for example, the constant region of an antibody) are known in the art. Binding proteins with altered function (e.g., altered affinity for an effector ligand such as FcR on a cell or the C1 component of complement) can be produced by replacing at least one amino acid residue in the constant portion with a different residue (see, e.g., European Application Publication No. \nEP\n 0 388 151 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,624,821 and 5,648,260). Similar types of alterations could be described that, if applied to a murine or other species of binding protein, would reduce or eliminate similar functions.\n\n\nFor example, it is possible to alter the affinity of an Fc region of a binding protein (e.g., an IgG, such as a human IgG) for FcR (e.g., Fc gamma R1) or C1q. The affinity may be altered by replacing at least one specified residue with at least one residue having an appropriate functionality on its side chain, or by introducing a charged functional group, such as glutamate or aspartate, or perhaps an aromatic nonpolar residue such as phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan or alanine (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,624,821).\n\n\nFor example, replacing residue 297 (asparagine) with alanine in the IgG constant region significantly inhibits recruitment of effector cells, while only slightly reducing (about three-fold weaker) affinity for CIq (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,624,821). The numbering of the residues in the heavy chain is that of the EU index (see Kabat et al. (1991) supra). This alteration destroys the glycosylation site, and it is believed that the presence of carbohydrate is required for Fc receptor binding. Any other substitution at this site that destroys the glycosylation site is believed to cause a similar decrease in lytic activity. Other amino acid substitutions, e.g., changing any one of residues 318 (Glu), 320 (Lys) and 322 (Lys), to Ala, are also known to abolish C1q binding to the Fc region of IgG antibodies (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,624,821).\n\n\nModified binding proteins can be produced which have a reduced interaction with an Fc receptor. For example, it has been shown that in human IgG\n3\n, which binds to the human Fc gamma R1 receptor, changing Leu 235 to Glu destroys its interaction with the receptor. Mutations on adjacent or close sites in the hinge link region of a binding protein (e.g., replacing residues 234, 235 and 237 with Ala) can also be used to affect binding protein affinity for the Fc gamma R1 receptor. The numbering of the residues in the heavy chain is based on the EU index (see Kabat et al. (1991) supra). Thus, in some embodiments of the invention, the Fc region of the binding proteins of the invention contains at least one constant region mutation, such as, for example, changing Leu to Ala at position 234 (L234A), changing Leu to Ala at position 235 (L235A), and/or changing Gly to Ala at position 237 (G237A). In one embodiment, the Fc region of the binding protein contains two constant region mutations, L234A and G237A (i.e., “double-mutant” or “DM”). In another embodiment, the Fc region of the binding protein contains three constant region mutations, L234A, L235A, and G237A (i.e., “triple-mutant” or “TM”). For example, a human IgG constant region triple-mutant is set forth in SEQ ID NO:196.\n\n\nAdditional methods for altering the lytic activity of a binding protein, for example, by altering at least one amino acid in the N-terminal region of the CH2 domain, are described in International Application Publication No. WO 94/029351 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,624,821.\n\n\nThe binding proteins of the invention can be tagged with a detectable or functional label. These labels include radiolabels (e.g., \n131\nI and \n99\nTc), enzymatic labels (e.g., horseradish peroxidase and alkaline phosphatase), and other chemical moieties (e.g., biotin).\n\n\nThe invention may also feature an isolated binding protein or antigen-binding fragment thereof that binds to IL-21R, in particular, human IL-21R.

The nucleic acids may comprise DNA or RNA, and they may be synthetic (completely or partially) or recombinant (completely or partially). Reference to a nucleotide sequence as set out herein encompasses a DNA molecule with the specified sequence, and encompasses an RNA molecule with the specified sequence in which U is substituted for T.\n\n\nAlso contemplated are nucleic acids that comprise a coding sequence for one, two, or three CDRs, a V\nH \ndomain, a V\nL \ndomain, or combinations thereof, as disclosed herein, or a sequence substantially identical thereto (e.g., a sequence at least 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or higher identical thereto, or which is capable of hybridizing under stringent conditions to the sequences).\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the isolated nucleic acids have nucleotide sequences encoding heavy chain and light chain variable regions of an anti-IL-21R binding protein comprising at least one CDR chosen from the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NOs:163-195, or a sequence encoding a CDR which differs by one or two or three or four amino acids from the sequences described herein.\n\n\nThe nucleic acid can encode only the light chain or the heavy chain variable region, or can encode a binding protein light or heavy chain constant region, operatively linked to the corresponding variable region. In one embodiment, the light chain variable region is linked to a constant region chosen from a kappa or a lambda constant region. The light chain constant region may also be a human kappa or lambda type. In another embodiment, the heavy chain variable region is linked to a heavy chain constant region of a binding protein isotype chosen from IgG (e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4), IgM, IgA1, IgA2, IgD, and IgE. The heavy chain constant region may be an IgG (e.g., an IgG1) isotype.\n\n\nThe nucleic acid compositions of the present invention, while often in the native sequence (of cDNA or genomic DNA or mixtures thereof), except for modified restriction sites and the like, can be mutated in accordance with standard techniques to provide gene sequences. For coding sequences, these mutations, may affect amino acid sequences as desired. In particular, nucleotide sequences substantially identical to or derived from native V, D, J, constant, switches and other such sequences described herein are contemplated (where “derived” indicates that a sequence is identical to or modified from another sequence).\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the nucleic acid differs (e.g., differs by substitution, insertion, or deletion) from that of the sequences provided (e.g., by at least one but less than 10, 20, 30, or 40 nucleotides; at least one but less than 1%, 5%, 10% or 20% of the nucleotides in the subject nucleic acid). If necessary for this analysis the sequences should be aligned for maximum homology. “Looped” out sequences from deletions or insertions, or mismatches, are considered differences. The difference may be at a nucleotide(s) encoding a nonessential residue(s), or the difference may be a conservative substitution(s).\n\n\nThe disclosure also provides nucleic acid constructs in the form of plasmids, vectors, and transcription or expression cassettes, which comprise at least one nucleic acid as described herein.\n\n\nThe disclosure further provides a host cell that comprises at least one nucleic acid construct described herein.\n\n\nAlso provided is a method of making an encoded protein(s) from a nucleic acid(s) comprising the sequence(s) described herein. The method comprises culturing host cells under appropriate conditions so they express the protein from the nucleic acid. Following expression and production, the V\nH \nor V\nL \ndomain, or specific binding member, may be isolated and/or purified using any suitable technique, and then used as appropriate. The method can also include the steps of fusing a nucleic acid encoding an scFv with nucleic acids encoding an Fc portion of a binding protein, and expressing the fused nucleic acid in a cell. The method can also include a step of germlining.\n\n\nAntigen-binding fragments, V\nH \nand/or V\nL \ndomains, and encoding nucleic acid molecules and vectors may be isolated and/or purified from their natural environment, in substantially pure or homogenous form, or, in the case of nucleic acids, free or substantially free of nucleic acids or genes of origin other than the sequence encoding a polypeptide with the require function.\n\n\nSystems for cloning and expressing polypeptides in a variety of host cells are known in the art. Cells suitable for producing binding proteins are described in, for example, Fernandez et al. (1999) \nGene Expression Systems\n, Academic Press. In brief, suitable host cells include mammalian cells, insect cells, plant cells, yeast cells, or prokaryotic cells, e.g., \nE. coli\n. Mammalian cells available in the art for heterologous polypeptide expression include lymphocytic cell lines (e.g., NSO), HEK293 cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, COS cells, HeLa cells, baby hamster kidney cells, oocyte cells, and cells from a transgenic animal, e.g., mammary epithelial cells. In other embodiments, the nucleic acids encoding the binding proteins of the invention are placed under the control of a tissue-specific promoter (e.g., a mammary-specific promoter) and the binding proteins are produced in transgenic animals. For example, the binding proteins are secreted into the milk of the transgenic animal, such as a transgenic cow, pig, horse, sheep, goat, or rodent.\n\n\nSuitable vectors may be chosen or constructed to contain appropriate regulatory sequences, including promoter sequences, terminator sequences, polyadenylation sequences, enhancer sequences, marker genes, and other sequences. The vectors may also contain a plasmid or viral backbone. For details, see, e.g., Sambrook et al. \nMolecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual \n(2nd ed. 1989), Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. Many established techniques used with vectors, including the manipulation, preparation, mutagenesis, sequencing, and transfection of DNA, are described, e.g., in \nCurrent Protocols in Molecular Biology \n(2nd ed. 1992) Ausubel et al. eds., John Wiley & Sons.\n\n\nA further aspect of the disclosure provides a method of introducing the nucleic acid into a host cell. For eukaryotic cells, suitable transfection techniques may include calcium phosphate, DEAE-Dextran, electroporation, liposome-mediated transfection, and transduction using a retrovirus or other virus(es), e.g., vaccinia or baculovirus. For bacterial cells, suitable techniques may include calcium chloride transformation, electroporation, and transfection using bacteriophage. DNA introduction may be followed by a selection method (e.g., drug resistance) to select cells that contain the nucleic acid.\n\n\nUses of Anti-IL-21R Binding Proteins\n\n\nAnti-IL-21R binding proteins that act as antagonists to IL-21R (e.g., binding proteins, or antigen-binding fragments thereof, of the present invention) can be used to regulate at least one IL-21R-mediated immune response, such as one or more of cell proliferation, cytokine expression or secretion, chemokine secretion, and cytolytic activity, of T cells, B cells, NK cells, macrophages, or synovial cells. Accordingly, the binding proteins of the invention can be used to inhibit the activity (e.g., proliferation, differentiation, and/or survival) of an immune or hematopoietic cell (e.g., a cell of myeloid, lymphoid, or erythroid lineage, or precursor cells thereof), and, thus, can be used to treat a variety of immune disorders and hyperproliferative disorders of the blood. Examples of IL-21R-associated disorders/immune disorders that can be treated include, but are not limited to, transplant rejection, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), allergies (for example, atopic allergy), and autoimmune diseases. Autoimmune diseases include, but are not limited to, diabetes mellitus, arthritic disorders (including rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis), spondyloarthropathy, multiple sclerosis, encephalomyelitis, myasthenia gravis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), cutaneous lupus erythematosus, autoimmune thyroiditis, dermatitis (including atopic dermatitis and eczematous dermatitis), psoriasis, Sjögren's syndrome, IBD (including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), asthma (including intrinsic asthma and allergic asthma), scleroderma and vasculitis. The binding proteins, or antigen-binding fragments thereof, of the present invention can be used in methods to treat or prevent IL-21R-associated disorders/immune disorders in subjects, e.g., in humans.\n\n\nMultiple sclerosis is a central nervous system disease that is characterized by inflammation and loss of myelin sheaths (the fatty material that insulates nerves and is needed for proper nerve function). Inflammation that results from an immune response that is dependent on IL-21/IL-21R can be treated with the binding proteins and compositions of this invention. In the experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) mouse model for multiple sclerosis (see, e.g., Tuohy et al. (1988) \nJ. Immunol. \n141:1126-30; Sobel et al. (1984) \nJ. Immunol. \n132:2393-401; and Traugott (1989) \nCell Immunol. \n119:114-29), treatment of mice with injections of an IL-21R antibody prior to (and continuously after) induction of EAE profoundly delayed the onset of the disease. The binding proteins, or antigen-binding fragments thereof, of the present invention can be used in methods to treat or prevent multiple sclerosis in subjects, e.g., in humans.\n\n\nArthritis is a disease characterized by inflammation in the joints. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most frequent form of arthritis, involving inflammation of connective tissue and the synovial membrane, a membrane that lines the joint. The inflamed synovial membrane often infiltrates the joint and damages joint cartilage and bone. Studies show that treatment of synovial cells and macrophages with IL-21 induces these cells to secrete cytokines and chemokines associated with inflammation. In the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model for rheumatoid arthritis (see, e.g., Courtenay et al. (1980) \nNature \n283:666-28; and Williams et al. (1995) \nImmunol. \n84:433-39), treatment of mice with IL-21 subsequent to CIA induction (and continuously) exacerbates the disease. Increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and more importantly, increased levels of disease resulting from immune responses that are dependent on IL-21, may be treated with the binding proteins of the invention. Similarly, the binding proteins, or antigen-binding fragments thereof, of the present invention can be used in methods to treat or prevent RA or other arthritic diseases in subjects, e.g., in humans.\n\n\nTransplant rejection is the immunological phenomenon where tissues from a donor are specifically “attacked” by immune cells of the host. The principle “attacking” cells are T cells, whose T cell receptors recognize the donor's MHC molecules as “foreign.” This recognition activates the T cell, which proliferates and secretes a variety of cytokines and cytolytic proteins that ultimately destroy the transplant. T cells in a mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR), an in vitro assay of transplant rejection, proliferate more strongly when supplemented with IL-21. MLR and transplantation models have been described in \nCurrent Protocols in Immunology \n(2nd ed. 1994) Coligan et al. eds., John Wiley & Sons (see also Kasaian et al. (2002) supra; Fulmer et al. (1963) \nAm. J. Anat. \n113:273-85; and Lenschow et al. (1992) \nScience \n257:789-92). The binding proteins, or antigen-binding fragments thereof, of the present invention can be used in methods to reduce or prevent the MLR and/or to treat or prevent transplant rejection and related diseases (e.g., GVHD) that are dependent on IL-21 in subjects, e.g., in humans.\n\n\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of autoantibodies, including antibodies to DNA, nuclear antigens, and ribonucleoproteins. These autoantibodies are associated with tissue and organ damage. The cause of SLE is unknown, but the occurrence of autoantibodies suggests inadequate inhibition of autoreactive T cells or B cells. The binding proteins, or antigen-binding fragments thereof, of the present invention can be used in methods to inhibit the IL-21-mediated activities of autoreactive T cells and B cells and/or to treat or prevent SLE or related diseases in subjects, e.g., in humans or in MRL-Fas\nlpr \nmice (a mouse model for SLE) (\nImmunologic Defects in Laboratory Animals \n(1981) Gershwin et al. eds., Plenum Press).\n\n\nThe binding proteins, or antigen-binding fragments thereof, of the present invention also can be used in methods to treat or prevent hyperproliferative disorders of the blood that are associated with aberrant activity of IL-21-responsive cells and IL-21R-responsive cells in subjects, e.g., in humans. Examples of such cells include neoplastic cells of hematopoietic origin, e.g., cells arising from myeloid, lymphoid or erythroid lineages, or precursor cells thereof. Examples of such neoplastic disorders include leukemic cancers and tumors of the blood, bone marrow (e.g., myeloma), and lymph tissue (e.g., lymphomas). In certain embodiments, the present invention is directed to the treatment of various leukemic cancers including, but not limited to, acute promyeloid leukemia (APML), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) (reviewed in Vaickus (1991) \nCrit. Rev. Oncol./Hemotol. \n11:267-97). Examples of lymphoid malignancies that may be treated by the present methods include, but are not limited to, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, which includes B-lineage ALL and T-lineage ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL), hairy cell leukemia (HCL), and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM). Additional forms of malignant lymphomas that can be treated by the present invention include, but are not limited to, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, peripheral T cell lymphomas, adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL), cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL), large granular lymphocytic leukemia (LGL), Hodgkin's lymphoma, and variants thereof.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention features a method of decreasing, inhibiting or reducing an acute phase response in a subject. An acute phase response is a response to inflammation, including the modulation of levels of acute phase proteins (e.g., C-reactive protein and serum albumin). The method includes administering to the subject an anti-IL-21R binding protein or antigen-binding fragment thereof as described herein, in an amount sufficient to decrease, inhibit or reduce the acute phase response in the subject. In one embodiment, the subject is a mammal, e.g., a human suffering from an IL-21R-associated disorder as described herein, including, e.g., respiratory disorders, inflammatory disorders and autoimmune disorders.\n\n\nCombination Therapy\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one anti-IL-21R binding protein or antigen-binding fragment thereof and at least one therapeutic agent is administered in combination therapy. The therapy is useful for treating pathological conditions or disorders, such as immune and inflammatory disorders. The term “in combination” in this context means that the binding protein composition and the therapeutic agent are given substantially contemporaneously, either simultaneously or sequentially. If given sequentially, at the onset of administration of the second compound, the first of the two compounds may still be detectable at effective concentrations at the site of treatment.\n\n\nFor example, the combination therapy can include at least one anti-IL-21R binding protein, such as, for example, an anti-IL-21R antibody, coformulated with, and/or coadministered with, at least one additional therapeutic agent. The additional agents may include at least one cytokine inhibitor, growth factor inhibitor, immunosuppressant, anti-inflammatory agent, metabolic inhibitor, enzyme inhibitor, cytotoxic agent, and/or cytostatic agent, as described in more detail below. Such combination therapies may advantageously utilize lower dosages of the administered therapeutic agents, thus avoiding possible toxicities or complications associated with the various monotherapies. Moreover, the therapeutic agents disclosed herein act on pathways that differ from the IL-21/IL-21R pathway, and thus are expected to enhance and/or synergize with the effects of the anti-IL-21R binding proteins.\n\n\nTherapeutic agents used in combination with anti-IL-21R binding proteins may be those agents that interfere at different stages in the autoimmune and subsequent inflammatory response. In one embodiment, at least one anti-IL-21R binding protein described herein may be coformulated with, and/or coadministered with, at least one cytokine and/or growth factor antagonist. The antagonists may include soluble receptors, peptide inhibitors, small molecules, ligand fusions, antibodies (that bind cytokines or growth factors, or their receptors or other cell surface molecules), and “anti-inflammatory cytokines” and agonists thereof.\n\n\nExamples of the agents that can be used in combination with the anti-IL-21R binding proteins described herein, include, but are not limited to, antagonists of at least one interleukin (e.g., IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-12, IL-13, IL-15, IL-16, IL-17, IL-18, and IL-22), cytokine (e.g., TNF-α, LT, EMAP-II, and GM-CSF), or growth factor (e.g., FGF and PDGF). The agents may also include, but are not limited to, antagonists of at least one receptor for an interleukin, cytokine, or growth factor. Anti-IL-21R binding proteins can also be combined with inhibitors (e.g., antibodies) to cell surface molecules such as CD2, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD25, CD28, CD30, CD40, CD45, CD69, CD80 (B7.1), CD86 (B7.2), CD90, or their ligands (e.g., CD154 (gp39, CD40L)), or LFA-1/ICAM-1 or VLA-4/VCAM-1 (see Yusuf-Makagiansar et al. (2002) \nMed. Res. Rev. \n22(2):146-67)). Antagonists that can be used in combination with anti-IL-21R binding proteins described herein may include antagonists of IL-1, IL-12, TNF-α, IL-15, IL-17, IL-18, IL-22, and their receptors.\n\n\nExamples of IL-12 antagonists include antibodies that bind IL-12 (see, e.g., International Application Publication No. WO 00/056772); IL-12 receptor inhibitors (e.g., antibodies to the IL-12 receptor), and soluble IL-12 receptor and fragments thereof. Examples of IL-15 antagonists include antibodies against IL-15 or its receptor, soluble fragments of the IL-15 receptor, and IL-15-binding proteins. Examples of IL-18 antagonists include antibodies to IL-18, soluble fragments of the IL-18 receptor, and IL-18 binding proteins (IL-18BP, Mallet et al. (2001) \nCirc. Res. \n28). Examples of IL-1 antagonists include Interleukin-1-Converting Enzyme (ICE) inhibitors (such as Vx740), IL-1 antagonists (e.g., IL-IRA (anakinra, Amgen)), sIL-IRII (Immunex), and anti-IL-1 receptor antibodies.\n\n\nExamples of TNF antagonists include antibodies to TNF (e.g., human TNF-α), such as D2E7 (human anti-TNF-α antibody, U.S. Pat. No. 6,258,562, HUMIRA™, BASF, Parsippany, N.J.), CDP-571/CDP-870/BAY-10-3356 (humanized anti-TNF-α antibodies, Celltech/Pharmacia), cA2 (chimeric anti-TNF-α antibody, REMICADE™, Centocor), and anti-TNF antibody fragments (e.g., CPD870). Other examples include soluble TNF receptor (e.g., human p55 or p75) fragments and derivatives, such as p55 kdTNFR-IgG (55 kD TNF receptor-IgG fusion protein, LENERCEPT™) and 75 kdTNFR-IgG (75 kD TNF receptor-IgG fusion protein, ENBREL™, Immunex; see, e.g., \nArthritis Rheumatism \n(1994) 37:S295 and \nJ. Invest. Med\n. (1996) 44:235A). Further examples include enzyme antagonists (e.g., TNF-α converting enzyme inhibitors (TACE) such as alpha-sulfonyl hydroxamic acid derivative (WO 01/055112) or N-hydroxyformamide inhibitor (\nGW\n 3333, -005, or -022)) and TNF-bp/s-TNFR (soluble TNF binding protein; see, e.g., \nArthritis Rheumatism \n(1996) 39(9):S284 and \nAm. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol\n. (1995) 268:37-42).\n\n\nIn other embodiments, the anti-IL-21R binding proteins described herein can be administered in combination with at least one of the following: IL-13 antagonists, such as soluble IL-13 receptors and/or anti-IL-13 antibodies; and IL-2 antagonists, such as IL-2 fusion proteins (e.g., DAB 486-IL-2 and/or DAB 389-IL-2, Seragen (see, e.g., \nArthritis Rheumatism \n(1993) 36:1223)) and anti-IL-2R antibodies (e.g., anti-Tac (humanized antibody, Protein Design Labs (see \nCancer Res\n. (1990) 50(5): 1495-502))). Another combination includes anti-IL-21R binding proteins in combination with nondepleting anti-CD4 inhibitors such as IDEC-CE9.1/SB 210396 (anti-CD4 antibody, IDEC/SmithKline). Yet other combinations include anti-IL-21R binding proteins with CD80 (B7.1) and CD86 (B7.2) costimulatory pathway antagonists (such as antibodies, soluble receptors, or antagonistic ligands), P-selectin glycoprotein ligand (PSGL), and/or anti-inflammatory cytokines and agonists thereof (e.g., antibodies). The anti-inflammatory cytokines may include IL-4 (DNAX/Schering, Palo Alto, Calif.), IL-10 (SCH 52000, recombinant IL-10, DNAX/Schering), IL-13, and TGF.\n\n\nIn other embodiments, at least one anti-IL-21R binding protein can be coformulated with, and/or coadministered with, at least one anti-inflammatory drug, immunosuppressant, metabolic inhibitor, and enzymatic inhibitor. Nonlimiting examples of the drugs or inhibitors that can be used in combination with the IL-21R binding proteins described herein, include, but are not limited to, at least one of: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) (such as ibuprofen, tenidap (see, e.g., \nArthritis Rheumatism \n(1996) 39(9):S280), naproxen (see, e.g., \nNeuroReport \n(1996) 7:1209-13), meloxicam, piroxicam, diclofenac, and indomethacin); sulfasalazine (see, e.g., \nArthritis Rheumatism \n(1996) 39(9):S281)); corticosteroids (such as prednisolone); cytokine suppressive anti-inflammatory drugs (CSAID); and inhibitors of nucleotide biosynthesis (such as an inhibitor of purine biosynthesis (e.g., a folate antagonist such as methotrexate) and an inhibitor of pyrimidine biosynthesis (e.g., a dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) inhibitor such as leflunomide (see, e.g., \nArthritis Rheumatism \n(1996) 39(9):S131 and \nInflammation Research \n(1996) 45:103-7)).\n\n\nExamples of additional inhibitors include at least one of: corticosteroids (oral, inhaled and local injection); immunosuppressants (such as cyclosporin and tacrolimus (FK-506)); mTOR inhibitors (such as sirolimus (rapamycin) or a rapamycin derivative (e.g., an ester rapamycin derivative such as CCI-779 (see Elit (2002) \nCurrent Opinion Investig.

Nonlimiting examples of agents for treating immune responses with which an IL-21/IL-21R antagonist can be combined include the following antibodies against cell surface molecules (e.g., CD25 (IL-2 receptor α), CD11a (LFA-1), CD54 (ICAM-1), CD4, CD45, CD28/CTLA4, CD80 (B7-1), CD86 (B7-2), or combinations thereof). In another embodiment, an anti-IL-21R binding protein is used in combination with at least one general immunosuppressive agent, such as cyclosporin A or FK506.\n\n\nAnother aspect of the present invention relates to kits for carrying out the combined administration of anti-IL-21R binding proteins with other therapeutic agents. In one embodiment, the kit comprises at least one anti-IL-21R binding protein formulated in a pharmaceutical carrier, and at least one therapeutic agent, formulated as appropriate in one or more separate pharmaceutical preparations.\n\n\nDiagnostic Uses\n\n\nThe binding proteins of the invention may also be used to detect the presence of IL-21R in biological samples. By correlating the presence or level of these proteins with a medical condition, one of skill in the art can diagnose the associated medical condition. For example, stimulated T cells increase their expression of IL-21R, and an unusually high concentration of IL-21R expressing T cells in joints may indicate joint inflammation and possible arthritis. Illustrative medical conditions that may be diagnosed by the binding proteins of this invention include, but are not limited to, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and transplant rejection.\n\n\nBinding protein-based detection methods, such as those commonly used for antibodies, are well known in the art, and include ELISA, radioimmunoassays, immunoblots, Western blots, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation, and other related techniques. The binding proteins may be provided in a diagnostic kit that incorporates at least one of these procedures to detect IL-21R. The kit may contain other components, packaging, instructions, reagents, and/or other material to aid the detection of the protein and use of the kit.\n\n\nBinding proteins may be modified with detectable markers, including ligand groups (e.g., biotin), fluorophores, chromophores, radioisotopes, electron-dense reagents, or enzymes. Enzymes are detected by their activity. For example, horseradish peroxidase is detected by its ability to convert tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to a blue pigment, quantifiable with a spectrophotometer. Other suitable binding partners include biotin and avidin, IgG and protein A, and other receptor-ligand pairs known in the art.\n\n\nBinding proteins can also be functionally linked (e.g., by chemical coupling, genetic fusion, noncovalent association, or otherwise) to at least one other molecular entity, such as another binding protein (e.g., a bispecific or a multispecific binding protein), toxins, radioisotopes, cytotoxic or cytostatic agents, among others. Other permutations and possibilities are apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art, and they are considered equivalents within the scope of this invention.\n\n\nPharmaceutical Compositions and Methods of Administration\n\n\nCertain embodiments of the invention include compositions comprising the disclosed binding proteins. The compositions may be suitable for pharmaceutical use and administration to patients. The compositions comprise a binding protein of the present invention and a pharmaceutical excipient. As used herein, “pharmaceutical excipient” includes solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, etc., that are compatible with pharmaceutical administration. Use of these agents for pharmaceutically active substances is well known in the art. The compositions may also contain other active compounds providing supplemental, additional, or enhanced therapeutic functions. The pharmaceutical compositions may also be included in a container, pack, or dispenser, together with instructions for administration.\n\n\nA pharmaceutical composition of the invention is formulated to be compatible with its intended route of administration. Methods to accomplish the administration are known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Pharmaceutical compositions may be topically or orally administered, or capable of transmission across mucous membranes. Examples of administration of a pharmaceutical composition include oral ingestion or inhalation. Administration may also be intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, intracavity, subcutaneous, cutaneous, or transdermal.\n\n\nSolutions or suspensions used for intradermal or subcutaneous application typically include at least one of the following components: a sterile diluent such as water, saline solution, fixed oils, polyethylene glycol, glycerine, propylene glycol, or other synthetic solvent; antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA); buffers such as acetate, citrate, or phosphate; and tonicity agents such as sodium chloride or dextrose. The pH can be adjusted with acids or bases by methods known in the art. Such preparations may be enclosed in ampoules, disposable syringes, or multiple dose vials.\n\n\nSolutions or suspensions used for intravenous administration include a carrier such as physiological saline, bacteriostatic water, CREMOPHOR EL® (BASF Corp., Ludwigshafen, Germany), ethanol, or polyol. In all cases, the composition must be sterile and fluid for easy syringability. Proper fluidity can often be obtained using lecithin or surfactants. The composition must also be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage. Prevention of microorganisms can be achieved with antibacterial and antifungal agents, e.g., parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thimerosal, etc. In many cases, isotonic agents (sugar), polyalcohols (e.g., mannitol and sorbitol), or sodium chloride may be included in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the composition can be accomplished by adding an agent that delays absorption, e.g., aluminum monostearate or gelatin.\n\n\nOral compositions include an inert diluent or edible carrier. For the purpose of oral administration, the binding proteins can be incorporated with excipients and placed, e.g., in tablets, troches, capsules, or gelatin. Pharmaceutically compatible binding agents or adjuvant materials can be included in the composition. The compositions may contain (1) a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatin; (2) an excipient such as starch or lactose, (3) a disintegrating agent such as alginic acid, Primogel, or corn starch; (4) a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; (5) a glidant such as colloidal silicon dioxide; and/or (6) a sweetening or flavoring agent.\n\n\nThe composition may also be administered by a transmucosal or transdermal route. For example, binding proteins that comprise an Fc portion (for example, an antibody) may be capable of crossing mucous membranes in the intestine, mouth, or lungs (via Fc receptors). Transmucosal administration can be accomplished by lozenges, nasal sprays, inhalers, or suppositories. Transdermal administration can be accomplished with a composition containing ointments, salves, gels, or creams known in the art. For transmucosal or transdermal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used. For administration by inhalation, the binding proteins may be delivered in an aerosol spray from a pressured container or dispenser, which contains a propellant (e.g., liquid or gas), or a nebulizer.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the binding proteins of this invention are prepared with carriers to protect the binding proteins against rapid elimination from the body. Biodegradable polymers (e.g., ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid) are often used. Methods for the preparation of such formulations are known by those skilled in the art. Liposomal suspensions can be used as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers also. The liposomes can be prepared according to established methods known in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,522,811).\n\n\nThe binding proteins or binding protein compositions of the invention are administered in therapeutically effective amounts as described. Therapeutically effective amounts may vary with the subject's age, condition, sex, and severity of medical condition. Appropriate dosages can be determined by a physician based upon clinical indications. The binding proteins or compositions may be given as a bolus dose to maximize the circulating levels of binding proteins for the greatest length of time. Continuous infusion may also be used.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “subject” is intended to include human and nonhuman animals. Subjects may include a human patient having a disorder characterized by cells that express IL-21R, e.g., a cancer cell or an immune cell. The term “nonhuman animals” of the invention includes all vertebrates, such as nonhuman primates, sheep, dogs, cows, chickens, amphibians, reptiles, etc.\n\n\nExamples of dosage ranges that can be administered to a subject can be\n\n\nchosen from: 1 μg/kg to 20 mg/kg, 1 μg/kg to 10 mg/kg, 1 μg/kg to 1 mg/kg, 10 μg/kg to 1 mg/kg, 10 μg/kg to 100 μg/kg, 100 μg/kg to 1 mg/kg, 250 μg/kg to 2 mg/kg, 250 μg/kg to 1 mg/kg, 500 μg/kg to 2 mg/kg, 500 μg/kg to 1 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg to 5 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg, 15 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg to 25 mg/kg, 15 mg/kg to 25 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg to 25 mg/kg, and 20 mg/kg to 30 mg/kg (or higher). These dosages may be administered daily, weekly, biweekly, monthly, or less frequently, for example, biannually, depending on dosage, method of administration, disorder or symptom(s) to be treated, and individual subject characteristics.\n\n\nIn certain circumstances, it may be advantageous to formulate compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited for the patient. Each dosage unit contains a predetermined quantity of binding protein calculated to produce a therapeutic effect in association with the carrier. The dosage unit depends on the characteristics of the binding protein and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved.\n\n\nToxicity and therapeutic efficacy of the composition can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., determining the LD\n50 \n(the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED\n50 \n(the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD\n50\n/ED\n50\n. Binding proteins that exhibit large therapeutic indices may be less toxic and/or more therapeutically effective.\n\n\nThe data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used to formulate a dosage range in humans. The dosage of these compounds may lie within the range of circulating binding protein concentrations in the blood, which includes an ED\n50 \nwith little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage composition form employed and the route of administration. For any binding protein used in the present invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially using cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC\n50 \n(i.e., the concentration of binding protein that achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms). The effects of any particular dosage can be monitored by a suitable bioassay. Examples of suitable bioassays include DNA replication assays, transcription-based assays, gene expression assays, IL-21/IL-21R binding assays, and other immunological assays.\n\n\nIn one embodiment of the invention, a dose may be formulated in an ex vivo whole blood cell assay. In such embodiment, a suitable bioassay for determining and monitoring a particular dosage includes a method of determining a minimum serum concentration of an anti-IL-21R binding protein necessary to inhibit or reduce IL-21R activity, such as modulation of expression of IL-21-responsive genes. In one embodiment of the invention, the IL-21-responsive gene is selected from the following nonlimiting list: TNF, IFNγ, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, CD19, STAT3, TBX21, CSF1, GZMB, PRF1, IL-2Rα, and IL-21R. In a preferred embodiment, the IL-21-responsive gene is selected from CD19, GZMB, IFNγ, IL-2Rα, IL6, and PRF-1. In a most preferred embodiment, the IL-21-responsive gene is IL-2Rα. Thus, the method of determining a minimum serum concentration of an anti-IL-21R antibody necessary to inhibit or reduce IL-21R activity may include determining a level of expression of more than one IL-21-responsive gene, e.g., two, three, four, five, or six IL-21-responsive genes.\n\n\nThe entire contents of all references, patent applications, and patents cited throughout this application are hereby incorporated by reference herein.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nThe invention will be further illustrated in the following nonlimiting examples. These Examples are set forth to aid in the understanding of the invention but are not intended to, and should not be construed to, limit its scope in any way. The Examples do not include detailed descriptions of conventional methods that would be well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nGeneration of Binding Proteins by Phage Display\n\n\nThe scFv parental clone 18A5, described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,495,085 (incorporated by reference herein), was obtained from the CS human scFv library by standard phage display methods, using BaF3 cells expressing human IL-21R as a target in \n \nrounds\n \n 1 and 3 and biotinylated IL-21R-Fc fusion protein as a target in \nround\n 2.\n\n\nExample 2\n\n\nLibrary Construction\n\n\nPhage display libraries were based upon the parental 18A5 scFv, using a pCANTAB6 vector in which the scFv was fused at its 3′ end to the intact gene Ill. Various CDR3 sequences were derived using techniques well known in the art.\n\n\nTwo overlapping blocks of six consecutive codons were randomized in the CDR3 of the V\nH \nand the V\nL\n, producing a total of four libraries: H3B1, H3B2, L3B1, and L3B2. The following identify nucleotide and amino acid sequences, respectively: IL-21R: 18A5 V\nH\nCDR3 [SEQ ID NOs:199 and 200]; H3B1 (library size 1.40×10\n9\n) [SEQ ID NOs:201 and 202]; H3B2 (library size 1.00×10\n9\n) [SEQ ID NOs:203 and 204]; IL-21R: 18A5 V\nL\nCDR3 [SEQ ID NOs:205 and 206]; L3B1 (library size 9.00×10\n9\n) [SEQ ID NOs:207 and 208]; L3B2 (library size 6.40×10\n9\n) [SEQ ID NOs:209 and 210].\n\n\nExample 3\n\n\nPhage Selection\n\n\nAll derivatives of 18A5 were isolated from the scFv libraries above by selection of phage able to bind in solution phase to biotinylated human IL-21R extracellular domain His-Flag fusion proteins (“biotin-hIL-21R-H/F”) and biotinylated murine IL-21R extracellular domain His-Flag fusion proteins (“biotin-mIL-21R-H/F”); all procedures and techniques related to selection are well known to one of skill in the art. A total of twenty-seven anti-IL-21R scFv were isolated by phage selection procedures.\n\n\nExample 4\n\n\nLibrary Screening\n\n\nResulting binding proteins in scFv format were chosen based on their ability to compete with parental 18A5 in human IgG1 format for binding to biotin-hIL-21R-H/F and biotin-mIL-21R-H/F, to prevent the hIL-21-dependent proliferation of genetically engineered cell lines expressing human IL-21R and the mIL-21-dependent proliferation of genetically engineered cell lines expressing murine IL-21R.\n\n\nExample 4.1\n\n\nPreparation of Crude Periplasmic Material (“Peri-Preps”) for Use in Screening Assays\n\n\nDepending on the growth conditions used, scFv can be expressed in solution in the bacterial periplasmic space. To induce release of scFv into the periplasm, 96-deep-well plates containing 990 \nμl\n 2×TY media with 0.1% glucose/100 μg/ml ampicillin were inoculated from thawed glycerol stocks (one clone per well) using the QPix2 Colony picker (Genetix, New Milton, England) and grown at 37° C. (999 rpm) for about 4 hr. Cultures were induced with IPTG at a final concentration of 0.02 mM and grown overnight at 30° C. (999 rpm). The contents of the bacterial periplasm (peri-preps) were released by osmotic shock. Briefly, plates were centrifuged and pellets were resuspended in 150 μl TES periplasmic buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 8.0)/1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0)/20% Sucrose), followed by the addition of 150 μl 1:5 TES:water, and incubated on ice for 30 min. Plates were centrifuged and the scFv-containing supernatant was harvested.\n\n\nExample 4.2\n\n\nEpitope Competition Assay for Library Screening\n\n\nThose scFv able to compete with the parental 18A5 antibody for binding to human or murine IL-21R were identified from selected phage by a homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF®) assay. Purified parental 18A5 antibody was covalently modified with cryptate, a derivative of europium, according to the instructions in an HTRF® Cryptate Labeling Kit (Cisbio, Bedford, Mass.). Peri-preps of scFv were prepared as described above and diluted to 0.25% in PBS/0.4 M potassium fluoride/0.1% BSA (HTRF® buffer); then 10 μl of the mixture was transferred to the wells of black 384-shallow-well plates (Nunc, Rochester, N.Y.). Five μl of cryptate-conjugated 18A5 antibody was then added to each well, followed by 5 μl of a mixture of a 1:800 dilution of streptavidin-XL665 conjugate (Cisbio) and either 4.8 nM biotin-hIL-21R-H/F or 40 nM biotin-mIL-21R-H/F. The mixture was incubated for 2 hr at RT, and time-resolved fluorescence measurements were made (340 nm excitation, 615 nm and 665 nm emission). Competition with 18A5 antibody was indicated by a reduction in the background-corrected ratio of emission at 665 nm to emission at 615 nm.\n\n\nA total of 8280 independently isolated scFv were screened in the HTRF® assay using human IL-21R-H/F, and 376 clones able to compete with the parental 18A5 antibody for binding to biotin-hIL-21R-H/F were chosen for further analysis.\n\n\nExample 5\n\n\nDNA Sequence Analysis of Library-Derived scFv—PCR Amplification of scFv Regions for Sequencing Analysis\n\n\nThe sequences of 287 18A5-derived scFv variants with improved IL-21R binding over that of the parent 18A5 scFv molecule were determined, and the frequencies of amino acids found at each position were determined. Among the V\nH \nclones, only two (1.7%) were derived from a library which mutated the last six amino acids of, e.g., SEQ ID NO: 169 (at the C-terminus of V\nH \nCDR3), while the remainder were derived from a library which mutated the first six amino acids of, e.g., SEQ ID NO:169. Among the V\nL \nclones, only one clone (0.6%) was derived from a library in which the last six amino acids of, e.g., SEQ ID NO:170 (at the C-terminus of V\nL \nCDR3) were mutated, while the majority were derived from alterations in the first six amino acids of, e.g., SEQ ID NO:170 (at the N-terminus of V\nL \nCDR3).\n\n\nPCR amplification of scFvs was carried out using VENT® DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs, Ispwich, Mass.) in HN buffer (Epicentre Biotechnologies, Madison, Wis.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Five μl of a 1:10 dilution of a stationary phase bacterial culture was used as the template for a final reaction volume of 20 μl. The cycling conditions used were a 2-min hot start at 94° C., 30 cycles of denaturation at 94° C. (1 min), primer annealing at 55° C. (2 min) and extension at 72° C. (1 min), followed by a final extension at 72° C. (5 min). PCR products were verified by agarose gel electrophoresis and cleaned up with ExoI/SAP (shrimp alkaline phosphatase) prior to sequencing with the M13rev primer.\n\n\nThe SEQ ID NOs for the CDR3 sequences of twenty-seven scFv are listed in Table 4. These scFv were chosen for further analysis based on assays described in Example 6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCDR3 SEQ ID NOs of Improved 18A5-derived scFv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nscFv\n\n\nHeavy CDR3\n\n\n \nLight CDR3\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH3\n \n \n \n \n\n\n165\n\n\n170\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH4\n\n\n166\n\n\n170\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH5\n\n\n167\n\n\n170\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nH6\n \n\n\n168\n\n\n170\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nL1\n \n\n\n169\n\n\n171\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nL2\n \n\n\n169\n\n\n172\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nL3\n \n\n\n169\n\n\n173\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nL4\n \n\n\n169\n\n\n174\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nL5\n \n\n\n169\n\n\n175\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nL6\n \n\n\n169\n\n\n176\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nL8\n \n\n\n169\n\n\n177\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nL9\n \n\n\n169\n\n\n178\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nL10\n\n\n169\n\n\n179\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nL11\n \n\n\n169\n\n\n180\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nL12\n\n\n169\n\n\n181\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nL13\n\n\n169\n\n\n182\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nL14\n\n\n169\n\n\n183\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nL15\n \n\n\n169\n\n\n184\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nL16\n \n\n\n169\n\n\n185\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nL17\n \n\n\n169\n\n\n186\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nL18\n \n\n\n169\n\n\n187\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nL19\n\n\n169\n\n\n188\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nL20\n\n\n169\n\n\n189\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nL21\n\n\n169\n\n\n190\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nL23\n \n\n\n169\n\n\n191\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nL24\n \n\n\n169\n\n\n192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nL25\n \n\n\n169\n\n\n193\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 6\n\n\nCharacterization of Library-Derived scFv\n\n\nExample 6.1\n\n\nPreparation of Purified scFv for Quantitative Analysis\n\n\nIndividual scFv clones were purified on a small scale by Ni-NTA purification on PHYTIP® columns (PhyNexus, Inc., San Jose, Calif.). Single colonies were grown in 20 \nml\n 2×TY medium with 0.1% glucose/100 μg/ml ampicillin in 50-ml conical tubes to mid-logarithmic phase at 37° C. with shaking at 250 rpm. Expression of scFv was induced with IPTG at a final concentration of 0.02 mM, and cultures were grown overnight at 30° C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 1 ml TES periplasmic buffer, followed by the addition of 1 ml 1:5 TES:water and incubation on ice for 30 min. Lysates were centrifuged at 3200 rpm for 10 min at 4° C., and supernatants were brought to 2 mM MgCl\n2\n. scFv were captured on Ni-NTA PHYTIPs® (PhyNexus) by repeated passage of the supernatant over the PHYTIPs® on a Perkin Elmer (Waltham, Mass.) MINITRAK™ IX liquid handling robot, followed by washing in IMAC wash buffer and elution with 200 mM imidazole, 50 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl (pH 8.0). The buffer was exchanged to PBS by three cycles of dilution 1:10 into PBS, followed by concentration on a 10,000 molecular weight cutoff filter plate (Millipore MULTISCREEN ULTRACEL 96-well ultrafiltration plate, Millipore, Billerica, Mass.). Samples were quantitated using a Micro BCA™ kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Rockford, Ill.) using the manufacturer's bovine serum albumin standard.\n\n\nExample 6.2\n\n\nAssays for IL-21-Dependent Proliferation of Cells Overexpressing Human or Murine IL-21R\n\n\nInhibition assays were performed with 18A5-derived binding proteins (scFv and IgG) to measure their blockade of IL-21-dependent proliferation of cell lines transfected with human or murine IL-21R. BaF3 cells, a murine pre-B cell line, and TF1 cells, a human erythroid cell line, were retrovirally transduced with IL-21R and green fluorescent protein (GFP). Cells were routinely grown in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.00036% β-mercaptoethanol. Human IL-21R-BaF3 cell cultures were supplemented with 50 ng/ml of human IL-21; murine IL-21R-BaF3 cell cultures were supplemented with 10 U/ml of IL-3; TF1 cell cultures were supplemented with 50 ng/ml of GM-CSF. Prior to assay, cells were washed 3× in assay medium lacking supplemental growth factors, resuspended in assay medium, and incubated at 37° C./5% CO\n2 \nfor 6 hr. To prepare assay plates, 5000 cells were added to the central 60 wells of a 96-well flat-bottomed white tissue culture plate (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, Mass.) in a volume of 55 μl/well. Test scFv or IgG samples were prepared by diluting the stock sample in assay medium and diluting serially three-fold. Twenty-five μl of the binding protein samples were added to the cells and incubated for 30 min at 37° C./5% CO\n2\n. Twenty μl of assay medium containing 100-400 pg/ml of human or murine IL-21 was added to each well, and the cells were incubated for an additional 48 hr. Proliferation was measured by bringing plates to RT, adding 15 μl/well CELLTITER-GLO®, incubating for 10 min at RT, and measuring luminescence with a Perkin Elmer ENVISION™ plate reader. After purification with PhyNexus IMAC tips, 108 scFv were tested for neutralization of IL-21-dependent proliferation of all three cell lines. All showed neutralization of human IL-21R-BaF3 cells, with IC\n50\ns lower than or equal to that of the parental 18A5 scFv. A subset showed strong neutralization of proliferation of murine IL-21R-BaF3 cells and human IL-21R-TF1 cells. Data from the 27 most potent clones are shown in \nFIGS. 1-3\n, and are summarized in Table 5.\n\n\n \nFIGS. 1-3\n show the neutralization of proliferation by scFv of human IL-21R-BaF3 cells (\nFIGS. 1\n \na\n-\nc\n); human IL-21R-TF1 cells (\nFIGS. 2\n \na\n-\nc\n); and murine IL-21R-BaF3 cells (\nFIGS. 3\n \na\n-\nc\n). Cells were mixed with the indicated scFv and incubated with 100 pg/ml (\nFIGS. 1-2\n) or 400 pg/ml (\nFIG. 3\n) of human IL-21.\n\n\nExample 6.3\n\n\nQuantitative Epitope Competition Assay\n\n\nPurified scFv were analyzed quantitatively for their ability to compete with the parental 18A5 antibody for binding to murine IL-21R in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Parental 18A5 antibody was coated overnight at 4° C. on 96-well Nunc MAXISORP® plates at a concentration of 0.75 μg/ml in PBS. Plates were washed 3× using PBS, and then blocked for 3 hr at RT in PBS/1% BSA/0.05% Tween-20. scFv were mixed with 36 nM biotinylated mIL-21R-H/F and incubated for 10 min at RT. Blocked plates were washed 3× with PBS, and 50 μl/well of scFv/IL-21R mixtures were transferred to the appropriate plates and incubated for 1 hr at RT. Plates were washed 5× with PBS prior to the addition of a 1:6000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, Ala.) secondary antibody to detect bound biotinylated mIL-21R-H/F. Plates were then incubated for 1 hr at RT and washed 7× with PBS. Signal was developed using 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), the reaction stopped with H\n2\nSO\n4\n, and the absorbance read at 450 nm on an ENVISION™ plate reader (Perkin Elmer). 108 scFv purified by PhyNexus IMAC tips were tested in this assay, and most competed with the parental 18A5 antibody for binding to biotinylated murine IL-21R-H/F with IC\n50\ns lower than that of the parental 18A5 scFv.

Four scFv with modified V\nH \nregions, H3, H4, H5, and H6, along with the germlined parental 18A5 V\nH \n(see below) were chosen for conversion to full-length human IgG1.\n\n\nThe V\nH \nand V\nL \namino sequences of the parental 18A5 antibody were modified so that the sequences outside the CDR regions matched the closest human germline sequences: DP67/VH4B+ (VBASE_AA:WAP00CEAZ\n—\n1) and JH1/JH4/JH5 in the case of the V\nH\n, and DPL16/VL3.1 (VBASE_AA:WAP00CEMI\n—\n1) in the case of the V\nL\n. Modifications were done by a combination of gene synthesis at GENEART (Regensburg, Germany) and site-directed changes introduced by PCR. In addition, the sequences were codon-optimized for expression in mammalian cells by GENEART using their proprietary methods.

Binding proteins, now comprising full-length antibodies, were quantitated by anti-human IgG ELISA.\n\n\nExample 9.2\n\n\nActivity of Anti-IL-21R IgG in Neutralization of Cell Proliferation\n\n\nThe 80 transiently expressed IgGs in serum-free conditioned medium were tested for activity in IL-21-dependent proliferation assays in three cell lines as described above: (1) human IL-21R-BaF3 cells, (2) murine IL-21R-BaF3 cells, and (3) human IL-21R-TF1 cells. All 80 pairs showed neutralization of proliferation of human IL-21R-expressing BaF3 cells, and all pairs except those involving VH4 showed neutralization of human IL-21R-expressing TF1 cells (data not shown). All 80 pairs also showed neutralization of proliferation of murine IL-21R-expressing BaF3 cells, with the strongest neutralization generally associated with light chains paired with the parental heavy chain and the weakest neutralization generally associated with the VH4 heavy chain (data not shown). Neutralization data from the most potent 21 IgG combinations (AbA-AbU) are shown in \nFIG. 5\n, and IC\n50 \ndata are summarized in Table 6.\n\n\nAssays were conducted on human IL-21R-BaF3 cells with 100 pg/ml of human IL-21 (\nFIGS. 5\n \na\n-\nc\n), human IL-21R-TF1 cells with 100 pg/ml of human IL-21 (\nFIGS. 5\n \nd\n-\nf\n), or murine IL-21R-BaF3 cells with 400 pg/ml of murine IL-21 (\nFIGS. 5\n \ng\n-\ni\n). IL-21 was added to the cells after the indicated antibodies; proliferation was measured with CELLTITER-GLO® after 48 hr. \nFIGS. 26\n \na\n-\nc \nshow additional studies demonstrating similar inhibition in the same three cell lines.\n\n\nExample 9.3\n\n\nAnti-IL-21R IgG Binding to Transiently Expressed Rat and Cynomolgus Monkey IL-21R\n\n\nA subset of binding proteins was tested for binding to rat, cynomolgus monkey, human IL-21R, or human IL-2R-γ common subunit expressed transiently on the surfaces of CHO-PA-Dukx cells. Cells were transfected 48 hr prior to the assay. On the day of the assay, cells were washed gently 5× in PBS containing 0.9 mM CaCl\n2 \nand 0.45 mM MgCl\n2 \n(PBS/CaMg) on an automated plate washer (Titertek, Huntsville, Ala.), and blocked for 1 hr at RT in PBS/CaMg/5% nonfat dry milk. Conditioned media from transiently expressed anti-IL-21R IgGs were serially diluted in blocking buffer and added to the cells in the blocked plates for 1 hr at RT. Cells were washed 5× with PBS/CaMg and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-human IgG for 1 hr at RT. Cells were then washed 10× in PBS/CaMg and all of the wash buffer was removed. Cells were incubated with 100 μl TMB until the color reaction reached saturation, stopped with 100 μl of 0.18 M H\n2\nSO\n4\n, and read at A450 on a Perkin Elmer ENVISION™ plate reader.\n\n\nAll of the twenty-one IgGs bound to CHO cells transiently expressing human (\nFIGS. 6\n \na\n-\nc\n), rat (\nFIGS. 6\n \nd\n-\nf\n), or cynomolgus monkey (\nFIGS. 6\n \ng\n-\ni\n) IL-21R. Most showed no binding above background to a control protein (human gamma (γ) common chain) transiently expressed on CHO cells, but a subset of IgGs (AbD, AbE, AbF, AbH, AbL, and AbM) bound above background at 13 nM or greater (\nFIGS. 6\n \nj\n-\n1\n).

Anti-human-IgG, anti-murine immunoglobulin antibodies, and murine IL-21R-H/F were immobilized onto a research-grade carboxymethyl-dextran chip (CM5) using standard amine coupling. The sensor chip surface was activated with EDC/NHS for 7 min at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. The first flow cell was used as reference surface to correct for bulk refractive index, matrix effects, and nonspecific binding. Capture antibodies (7,150 resonance units (RU) of anti-human-Fc antibody (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, Calif.) on \nflow cell\n 2 and 7,500 RU of anti-murine-Fc antibody on flow cell 3) were diluted to 10 μg/ml in sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) and injected over the activated surface. Remaining activated groups were blocked with 1.0 M ethanolamine (pH 8.0). The molecular weights of the anti-human IgG and the anti-murine IgG were both 150 kD, and the molecular weight of the IL-21R monomer was 27 kD.\n\n\nConditioned media containing anti-IL-21R antibodies and antibody controls (murine anti-human IL-2Rβ and murine anti-human IL-4R (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.); human anti-human IL-13 (Wyeth, Cambridge, Mass.)) were diluted in HBS/EP buffer supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum and injected onto all four flow cells of the BIACORE™ chip, capturing 500-700 (RU) of antibody on the species-appropriate capture antibody. Following a 5 sec washing period, 50 nM solutions of a positive control protein (murine IL-21R-H/F), two human proteins related to IL-21R (human IL-2Rβ and human sIL-4R(R&D Systems)), or an unrelated His/FLAG-tagged protein (human IL-13-H/F) were injected over the captured antibodies on the chip. The association and dissociation phases were monitored for 120 and 180 sec, respectively, followed by two 5 μl injections of glycine (pH 1.5) to regenerate a fully active capturing surface. All binding experiments were done at 25° C. in HBS/EP buffer. Blank and buffer effects were subtracted for each sensorgram using double referencing.\n\n\nAll of the anti-IL-21R antibodies tested (18A5 antibody and AbA-AbU) showed clear binding to murine IL-21R, but no binding to the IL-21R-related proteins human IL-2Rβ and human soluble IL-4R, or to the unrelated His/FLAG-tagged protein human IL-13-His/FLAG (\nFIGS. 7\n \na\n-\nc\n). Controls indicated that IL-2Rβ and human soluble IL-4R could be captured by specific anti-IL-2Rβ and anti-IL-4R antibodies (\nFIG. 7\n \nd\n).\n\n\nExample 9.5\n\n\nPurification of Transiently Expressed Antibodies\n\n\nSeven antibodies (human IgG1 triple-mutant versions: AbS, AbT, AbO, AbP, and AbU; and double-mutant versions: AbQ and AbR) were transiently expressed in cos-7 cells and purified for further analysis. In addition, three versions of AbT with human IgG tails expected to have different levels of Fc receptor binding (wild-type IgG1, IgG4, and IgG1 double-mutants) were also prepared. The TRANSIT® protocol described above was followed, except that 25 μg of each plasmid was used to transfect cells in each of eight T-175 flasks. Following the first harvest of conditioned medium, fresh R1CD1 was added and then collected after an additional 72 hr. Conditioned media were pooled and filtered on a 0.22 μm filter. Antibodies were loaded onto protein A resin, eluted with 20 mM citric acid/150 mM sodium chloride (pH 2.5), neutralized with Tris (pH 8.5), and dialyzed into PBS.\n\n\nExample 9.6\n\n\nBIACORE™ Analysis of Antibody Binding to Human and Murine IL-21R\n\n\nThe kinetics of binding of anti-IL-21R antibodies to human and murine IL-21R-H/F was tested on a BIACORE™ surface plasmon resonance instrument. Anti-human IgG antibodies (Invitrogen Corporation) were immobilized onto a research-grade carboxy-methyl-dextran chip (CM5) using standard amine coupling. The surface was activated with EDC/NHS for 7 min at a flow of 20 μl/min. The first flow cell was used as a reference surface to correct for bulk refractive index, matrix effects, and nonspecific binding. The anti-human-Fc antibody was diluted to 20 μg/ml in 10 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0), and 2950-3405 resonance units (RU) were captured on each of the four flow cells. Remaining activated groups were blocked with 1.0 M ethanolamine-HCl (pH 8.5).\n\n\nAnti-IL-21R antibodies were diluted to 0.1-0.2 μg/ml in HBS/EP buffer supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin and loaded onto the BIACORE™ chip. Following a brief washing period, solutions of 0-100 nM human IL-21R-H/F or 10-500 nM murine IL-21R-H/F were injected over the chip at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. The association phase was run for 3 min for human and murine IL-21R kinetics, and the dissociation phase was monitored for 15 min for hIL-21R and for 5 min for mIL-21R, followed by two 10 μl injections and one 30 μl injection of glycine (pH 1.5), to regenerate a fully active capturing surface. All binding experiments were done at 25° C. in HBS/EP buffer, and the sample rack was kept at 15° C. Blank and buffer effects were subtracted for each sensorgram using double referencing. Sensorgrams are shown in \nFIGS. 8\n \na\n-\nb \n(human IL-21R-His/FLAG) and \nFIGS. 8\n \nc\n-\nd \n(murine IL-21R-His/FLAG). Binding kinetic parameters are shown in Table 7A, and additional kinetic data from a replicate experiment are shown in Table 7B.\n\n\nIn addition, AbS and AbT were tested for binding kinetics to cynomolgus monkey IL-21R-His/FLAG by the above-described protocol. Binding profiles to human and cynomolgus monkey IL-21R-H/F were similar for both AbS and AbT (\nFIG. 9\n). \nFIG. 9\n shows cynomolgus monkey IL-21R-His/FLAG binding to AbS (\n9\n \na\n); and to AbT (\n9\n \nc\n); and human IL-21R-His/FLAG binding to AbS (\n9\n \nb\n); and AbT (\n9\n \nd\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 7A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKinetic Parameters of Anti-IL-21R Antibody Binding Human and\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMurine IL-21R-His/FLAG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHuman IL-21R\n\n\nMurine IL-21R\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntibody\n\n\nka (1/Ms)\n\n\nkd (1/s)\n\n\nKD (M)\n\n\nka (1/Ms)\n\n\nkd (1/s)\n\n\nKD (M)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n18A5\n\n\n2.43E+05\n\n\n1.08E−03\n\n\n4.43E−09\n\n\n2.12E+05\n\n\n1.53E−02\n\n\n7.20E−08\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbO\n\n\n2.41E+05\n\n\n1.14E−04\n\n\n4.75E−10\n\n\n1.12E+05\n\n\n5.49E−03\n\n\n4.92E−08\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbP\n\n\n1.94E+05\n\n\n1.19E−04\n\n\n6.15E−10\n\n\n9.99E+04\n\n\n5.08E−03\n\n\n5.08E−08\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbQ\n\n\n4.39E+05\n\n\n9.34E−05\n\n\n2.13E−10\n\n\n3.01E+05\n\n\n2.07E−02\n\n\n6.88E−08\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbR\n\n\n1.70E+05\n\n\n9.61E−05\n\n\n5.67E−10\n\n\n7.65E+04\n\n\n4.93E−03\n\n\n6.45E−08\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbS\n\n\n1.44E+05\n\n\n2.91E−04\n\n\n2.02E−09\n\n\n1.99E+05\n\n\n3.32E−03\n\n\n1.67E−08\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbT\n\n\n1.79E+05\n\n\n6.78E−05\n\n\n3.79E−10\n\n\n2.11E+05\n\n\n3.31E−03\n\n\n1.57E−08\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbU\n\n\n1.86E+05\n\n\n8.18E−05\n\n\n4.40E−10\n\n\n9.81E+04\n\n\n4.34E−03\n\n\n4.42E−08\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 7B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKinetic Parameters of Anti-IL-21R Antibody\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBinding Human IL-21R-His/FLAG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHuman IL-21R\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAntibody\n\n\nka (1/Ms)\n\n\nkd (1/s)\n\n\nKD (M)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n18A5\n\n\n3.04E+05\n\n\n1.34E−03\n\n\n4.40E−09\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAbP\n\n\n2.33E+05\n\n\n1.02E−04\n\n\n4.36E−10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAbQ\n\n\n4.39E+05\n\n\n9.34E−05\n\n\n2.13E−10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAbR\n\n\n2.48E+05\n\n\n9.76E−05\n\n\n3.94E−10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAbS\n\n\n2.02E+05\n\n\n3.05E−04\n\n\n1.51E−09\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAbT\n\n\n2.73E+05\n\n\n7.42E−05\n\n\n2.72E−10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAbU\n\n\n2.38E+05\n\n\n7.83E−05\n\n\n3.29E−10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 9.7\n\n\nBIACORE™ Epitope Competition Assay\n\n\nAntibodies AbS and AbT and the parental antibody 18A5 were immobilized directly onto a CM5 BIACORE™ chip. Murine IL-21R-H/F (100 nM) was allowed to flow over the chip for 300 sec, followed by a wash (100 sec), and then a 5 μg/ml solution of either AbS, AbT, D5, or a nonneutralizing anti-mIL-21R antibody (7C2) was allowed to flow over the surface. No additional binding was observed with AbS, AbT, and D5, indicating that their binding site on mIL-21R-H/F was blocked by concurrent binding to AbS, AbT, or 18A5 antibody (\nFIG. 10\n \na\n). In contrast, the nonneutralizing control anti-IL-21R antibody 7C2 was able to bind to mIL-21R-H/F captured on AbS, AbT, or 18A5 antibody, indicating that this control antibody bound at a different epitope from the one bound by the capture antibodies.\n\n\nSimilarly, AbS and AbT did not bind to human IL-21R-H/F captured by AbS or AbT immobilized on a CM5 BIACORE™ chip, while the control anti-human IL-21R antibody (9D2) was able to bind human IL-21R-H/F captured by AbS or AbT (\nFIG. 10\n \nb\n). This observation suggested that the binding site for AbS is blocked by concurrent binding by AbT, and vice versa.\n\n\nExample 9.8\n\n\nCell-Based Proliferation Assays\n\n\nPurified IgGs were tested for activity in IL-21-dependent proliferation assays in three cell lines as described above: human IL-21R-BaF3 cells, murine IL-21R-BaF3 cells, and human IL-21R-TF-1 cells. All showed strong inhibition of both human and murine IL-21R-dependent proliferation with greater potency than that of the parental 18A5 IgG (\nFIG. 11\n, Table 8).

The resulting population was ˜80-90% CD4\n+\n/CD3\n+\n T cells. Enriched human CD4\n+\n T cells were activated for 3 days with anti-CD3/anti-CD28-coated microspheres in RPMI containing 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine, and HEPES in a 37° C. incubator adjusted to 5% CO\n2\n.

Popliteal, axillary, brachial, and inguinal lymph nodes and spleens from 12-week-old female BALB/C mice were collected. A single-cell suspension of the spleen cells was depleted of red blood cells using 0.16 M NH\n4\nCl in 0.017 M Tris (pH 7.4). The spleen and lymph node cells were pooled and enriched for CD8\n+\n cells using a murine T cell CD8 Subset Column Kit (R&D Systems). Murine CD8\n+\n cells (3×10\n4\n; suspended in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum and supplemented with 0.05 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM L-glutamine, 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 50 μg/ml gentamicin) were plated in 96-well, anti-mCD3 activation plates (BD Biosciences); mIL-21 (50 ng/ml) was added to all the wells. The test antibodies were titered in triplicate beginning at 20 μg/ml. Cells were grown for 3 days in a 37° C./10% CO\n2 \nincubator. During the last 5 hr of culture, cells were labeled with 0.5 μCi methyl-3H-thymidine/well (GE Healthcare). The cells were harvested using a Mach III cell harvester (TomTec, Hamden, Conn.) and counted using a Trilux microbeta counter (Perkin Elmer).

The day before the experiment, PBMC were isolated from buffy coat by diluting the buffy coat 1:1 in PBS, layering it over FICOLL® (GE Healthcare) and centrifuging at 1200 g for 20 min. PBMCs were removed from the top of the FICOLL® layer, washed, and stimulated overnight with 10 ng/ml IL-2 and 10 ng/ml IL-12 (R&D Systems). The day of the experiment, stimulated PBMCs were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in media at 1×10\n8 \ncells/ml. BJAB cells were labeled with 0.5 μM CFSE (MOLECULAR PROBES®, Invitrogen Corporation) for 10 min at 37° C., and then washed with fetal bovine serum once and PBS twice. Cells were then plated into a 96-well flat-bottom plate at 2×10\n5 \ncells/well in 100 μl media. Fifty μl of the 4× antibodies were added to the BJAB cells, followed by 5×10\n6 \nPBMC in 50 μl, giving a final 1:25 target:effector cell ratio. Cells were incubated at 37° C. for 6 hr and stained with propidium iodide (PI) to label dead and dying cells. Killing of target cells (CFSE\n+\n) was assessed by measuring PI staining in a FACSCALIBUR™ flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Only one anti-IL-21R antibody, AbZ, which has a wild-type human IgG1 constant region, showed ADCC above the background level displayed by a control anti-IL-13 antibody that did not bind to the target cells. All antibodies with the same variable domains as AbZ, including forms with human IgG4 (AbY), and those with double-mutant (AbX) and triple-mutant (AbT) forms of human IgG1, showed only background levels of ADCC (\nFIG. 15\n). All other anti-IL-21R antibodies tested contained the triple-mutant form of human IgG1 and showed background ADCC. A positive control antibody, rituximab (RITUXAN®), induced ADCC in all experiments.\n\n\nExample 9.13\n\n\nC1q ELISA\n\n\nIn order to determine whether cell-surface binding by anti-IL-21R antibodies is likely to lead to complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), the antibodies were tested for their ability to bind to the complement component C1q in an ELISA. IL-21R antibodies and rituximab (RITUXAN®) were diluted in PBS to 5 μg/ml. Diluted antibodies (100 μl) were coated onto a COSTAR® high-binding ELISA plate (Corning Life Sciences, Lowell, Mass.) overnight at 4° C. Plates were washed 3× with PBS/Tween-20 and blocked with 200 μl of blocking buffer (0.1 M NaPO\n4\n, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.1% gelatin, 0.01% Tween) for 1 hr at RT. Human serum previously determined to contain C1q (Quidel, San Diego, Calif.) was diluted 1:50 in PBS. After 1 hr of blocking, plates were washed and 100 μl of diluted serum was added to each well and incubated for 2 hr at RT on a shaker. Following three washes, 100 μl of 0.1 μg/ml chicken polyclonal anti-human C1q antibody (AbCam, Cambridge, Mass.) was added to each well and incubated for 1 hr at RT. Plates were again washed and incubated with 100 μl of a rabbit polyclonal antibody to chicken Ig-Y-HRP diluted 1:4000 (AbCam) for 1 hr at RT. Plates were washed and developed with TMB for 5 min, followed by 50 μl of 1 M H\n2\nSO\n4 \nto stop the reaction, and then read at 450 nm. Only one anti-IL-21R antibody, AbZ, which has a wild-type human IgG1 constant region, showed C1q binding above the background level displayed by a control antibody with a triple-mutant human IgG1 constant region that had previously been shown to lack C1q binding. All antibodies with the same variable domains as AbZ, including forms with human IgG4 (AbY), and those with double-mutant (AbX) and triple-mutant (AbT) forms of human IgG1, showed only background levels of C1q binding (\nFIG. 16\n). All other anti-IL-21R antibodies tested contained the triple-mutant form of human IgG1 and showed background C1q binding.\n\n\nExample 9.14\n\n\nCytokine Competition Assay\n\n\nIn order to demonstrate that antibody AbT binds to the murine IL-21R in a manner that competes with the IL-21 cytokine, a cytokine competition assay was performed. Antibody AbT was coated at 1 μg/ml onto ELISA plates, which were then blocked with 1% BSA in PBS/0.05% Tween. Biotinylated murine IL-21R-His/FLAG (1.5 ng/ml) was added to the wells, either alone or in the presence of increasing concentrations of murine IL-21, and the binding of the receptor to the immobilized antibody was detected with HRP-conjugated streptavidin and subsequent incubation with TMB detection reagent. Mouse IL-21 was able to block the binding of mIL-21R to AbT nearly completely above 4 ng/ml, indicating that the antibody and the cytokine compete for binding to murine IL-21R (\nFIG. 27\n \na\n).\n\n\nA second assay was performed to demonstrate that antibody AbS binds to the murine IL-21R in a manner that competes with the IL-21 cytokine. Murine IL-21R-Fc was captured on ELISA plates coated with an anti-mouse IgG2a antibody. Plates were blocked with 1% BSA in PBS and washed, and varying concentrations of AbS were added to the plate in the presence of 10 μg/ml mIL-21. The binding of mIL-21 to the receptor was detected by an HRP-conjugated anti-His\n6 \nantibody, and the binding of AbS to the receptor was detected by an anti-human Ig antibody. Concentrations of AbS above approximately 2 μg/ml completely prevented binding of mIL-21 to mIL-21R-Fc, indicating that the antibody and the cytokine compete for binding to murine IL-21R (\nFIG. 27\n \nb\n).\n\n\nExample 9.15\n\n\nInhibition of Rat T Cell Proliferation by Anti-IL-21R Antibodies\n\n\nLewis female rat splenic T cells were purified to 95% CD3\n+\n using Rat T cell Enrichment Columns (RTCC-25; R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Serial dilutions of the anti-human IL-21R antibodies and isotype control protein were made in culture medium (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium containing 10% FCS, L-glutamine, beta-mercaptoethanol, nonessential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, penicillin, streptomycin, and gentamycin) in flat-bottomed 96-well tissue culture plates which had been precoated with 1 μg of anti-rat CD3 antibody (BD Pharmingen Cat #554829), followed by the addition of 5 ng/ml rat IL-21 and 20,000 CD3 T cells per well. The cells were grown for 3 days in a 10% CO\n2\n, 37° C., humidified incubator. For the last 5 hr of culture, cells were labeled with 0.5 μCi of \n3\nH-thymidine (GE Amersham Cat# TRA-120). The plates were harvested onto glass fiber filter mats by a Tomtec Mach III plate harvester and were counted on a Perkin Elmer 1450 Microbeta Counter.\n\n\nThe response of the rat T cells to 5 ng/ml rat IL-21 was 6-fold above the background response to 1 μg of anti-CD3 alone. Antibodies AbS, AbU, AbV, and AbW were able to inhibit the \n3\nH thymidine incorporation stimulated by 5 ng/ml rat IL-21 (57,000 cpm in the absence of antibody treatment; \nFIG. 28\n).

Rabbit IL-21R-Fc (either \nisoform\n 1 or isoform 2) was captured from conditioned medium onto ELISA plates coated with anti-mouse IgG2a. Varying concentrations of AbS were added, the plates were washed, and antibody binding was detected with an HRP-conjugated anti-human IgG antibody. AbS showed clear binding to both isoforms of rabbit IL-21R Fc (\nFIG. 29\n \na\n). When binding of AbS to rabbit IL-21R-Fc was carried out in the presence of 10% conditioned medium containing rabbit IL-21, binding of AbS to either receptor isoform was reduced by approximately 10-fold, indicating that AbS competes with rabbit IL-21 for binding to rabbit IL-21R (\nFIG. 29\n \nb\n).\n\n\nExample 10\n\n\nCharacterization of Improved IgG In Vivo\n\n\nExample 10.1\n\n\nNeutralization of IL-21R with the Anti-IL-21R Antibodies, AbS and AbT, Inhibits the Generation of IgG Antibody Responses to a T Cell-Dependent Antigen In Vivo\n\n\nIL-21 is important for B cell isotype switching to certain subclasses of IgG and differentiation to plasma cells. Thus, to determine the efficacy of the anti-IL-21R antibodies, AbS and AbT, in vivo, the ability of these antibodies to inhibit IgM and IgG antibody responses to the T cell-dependent antigen, NP-chicken gamma globulin (NP-CGG) were tested in C57BL/6 mice. Mice were treated 3×/week with 10 mg/kg anti-IL-21R antibody or isotype control beginning one day prior to immunization with NP-CGG. NP-specific IgG and IgM were detected by ELISA. NP-specific IgM and IgG antibodies were readily detected in serum of isotype control-treated animals within 7 days following immunization, and these responses increased in magnitude to day 14 (\nFIG. 30\n \nb\n). Treatment with either AbS or AbT did not affect the magnitude of IgM responses in this study. NP-specific IgG antibody responses were delayed in AbS- or AbT-treated cells, as demonstrated by a decreased response compared to isotype control on \nday\n 7. NP-specific IgG antibody responses were similar in isotype control-, AbS- and AbT-treated mice at day 14 (\nFIG. 30\n \na\n). These data show that neutralization of IL-21R in vivo using either AbS or AbT can transiently inhibit the induction of early IgG antibody responses to a T cell-dependent antigen.\n\n\nA second study testing AbS and AbT also yielded similar results (\nFIGS. 30\n \nc\n-\nf\n). NP-specific IgG responses were transiently reduced at \nday\n 7 of immunization in mice treated with either AbS or AbT, but were similar to isotype control-treated mice at later timepoints. Isotype-specific ELISAs indicated that IgG2b and IgG2c were significantly reduced by AbS and AbT compared to controls at day 7 (\nFIGS. 30\n \ne\n-\nf\n). These data show that neutralization of IL-21R in vivo using either AbS and AbT can transiently inhibit the induction of early IgG antibody responses to a T cell-dependent antigen.\n\n\nTo test the effects of IL-21R neutralization on the maintenance of established long-term humoral immunity, C57BL/6 mice were immunized with NP-CGG and rested for at least one month to allow them to generate memory B cells and long-lived plasma cells, which give rise to long-term IgG serum antibody titers. Approximately one month after immunization, mice were treated 3×/week i.p. with saline, or 10 mg/kg of either AbS or AbT, or isotype control antibody for two months. NP-specific IgG serum antibody titers were monitored every two weeks by ELISA. C57BL/6 mice had high titers of NP-specific IgG serum antibodies one month after immunization when compared to naïve C57BL/6 mice, consistent with the formation of long-term humoral immunity to NP. NP-specific IgG serum antibody titers remained stable over the course of the study in both mice treated with the isotype control antibody, and treatment with either AbS or AbT did not affect these antibody titers (\nFIG. 30\n \ng\n). Following immunization, B cells generate plasma cells (in bone marrow), which give rise to long-term serum antibody titers. At the end of the study, the number of NP-specific IgG plasma cells in the bone marrow of the mice was measured, and the cell numbers were unaffected by treatment with AbS or AbT (\nFIG. 30\n \nh\n). These data indicate that neutralization of IL-21R with AbS and AbT in this treatment regimen does not affect the maintenance of established long-term serum antibody titers.\n\n\nExample 10.2\n\n\nAnti-IL-21R Antibody Function in a Model of SLE\n\n\nThe anti-IL-21R antibodies AbS and AbT were tested for their ability to ameliorate disease in the MRL-Fas\nlpr \nmurine model of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). MRL-Fas\nlpr \nmice spontaneously develop symptoms resembling those observed in human lupus, including high titers of anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) autoantibodies in circulation, immunoglobulin and complement C3 deposits in the glomeruli, presence of lymphocytic infiltrates in the kidney and lung, and, in severe disease, proteinuria, lymphadenopathy, and skin lesions. Male MRL-Fas\nlpr \nmice were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Me.) and, starting at 12 weeks of age, were given AbS, AbT, saline, or a control anti-human IL-13 antibody with the same triple-mutant human IgG1 constant region at a dosage of 400 μg/mouse (10 mg/kg) 3×/week over 10 weeks via i.p. injection. Serum samples were taken biweekly and examined for anti-dsDNA antibodies by ELISA. Urine was collected biweekly and tested for protein (using protein test strips); neither control animals nor treated animals developed significant proteinuria. Animals were also monitored for enlarged lymph nodes and skin lesions; neither control animals nor treated animals showed abnormalities. After 10 weeks of treatment, animals were sacrificed, and kidney and brain sections were examined for Ig and C3 deposits by immunohistochemistry. Cellular infiltrations into kidney and lungs were measured by examination of H/E-stained tissue sections.\n\n\nTreatment of MRL-Fas\nlpr \nmice with the IL-21R blocking antibody AbS significantly reduced anti-dsDNA IgG serum antibody levels as compared to animals treated with saline or a control anti-human IL-13 antibody, beginning at 2 weeks post-treatment and continuing until 10 weeks post-treatment (\nFIG. 31\n). Anti-dsDNA antibodies were reduced to undetectable levels by AbS treatment in 8/10 mice at week 4 (\nFIG. 31\n \nd\n), 5/10 at week 6 (\nFIG. 31\n \ne\n), and 7/10 at week 8 (\nFIG. 31\n \nf\n), as compared to saline and IL-13 control antibody-treated animals (all control mice had detectable anti-dsDNA antibody titers). Treatment with the IL-21R blocking antibody AbT did not significantly affect anti-dsDNA IgG serum antibody levels.\n\n\n \nFIG. 31\n \na \nshows anti-dsDNA antibody titers following treatment (AbS-treated group is significantly different from both saline- and anti-IL-13-treated groups (p<0.01)). \nFIG. 31\n \nb \nshows prebleed anti-dsDNA antibody titers (saline-treated group is significantly different from AbS-, AbT-, and anti-IL-13-treated groups (p<0.01)). The AbS-treated group is significantly different from both saline- and anti-IL-13-treated groups (p<0.01) after 2 weeks of dosing (\nFIG. 31\n \nc\n); 4 weeks (\nFIG. 31\n \nd\n); 6 weeks (\nFIG. 31\n \ne\n); 8 weeks (\nFIG. 31\n \nf\n); and 10 weeks (\nFIG. 31\n \ng\n).\n\n\nTreatment with AbS also significantly reduced Ig and C3 immune complex deposition and kidney pathology as compared to anti-IL-13 antibody-treated controls (p<0.01) (\nFIGS. 32\n, \n33\n). Twelve-week-old male MRL-Fas\nlpr \nmice were treated (10 mg/kg i.p., 3×/week) with either saline (control) or the indicated triple-mutant antibodies (an anti-human IL-13 human IgG1 A234 A235 A237 mutant antibody with no reactivity to murine IL-21 was used as an isotype control). Following 10 weeks of treatment, mice were sacrificed and Ig and C3 deposits in the kidneys were identified by immunocytochemistry. \nFIG. 32\n depicts IgG deposits in kidneys of MRL-Fas\nlpr \nmice treated as indicated (in \nFIG. 32\n \nb\n, glomeruli are indicated by dashed circles, and examples of diffuse stain, indicating IgG deposits, are indicated with white arrowheads). Staining intensity was scored on a scale of 1-5 (\nFIG. 32\n \na\n). Kidney IgG deposits in animals treated with AbS were significantly lower (p<0.01) than those in IL-13 triple-mutant-treated controls. \nFIG. 33\n depicts IgM (\nFIG. 33\n \na\n) and complement C3 (\nFIG. 33\n \nb\n) deposits in kidneys of MRL-Fas\nlpr \nmice treated as indicated. Staining intensity was scored on a scale of 1-5. IgM and complement C3 deposition in the kidneys were significantly reduced (p<0.05) by AbS compared to the anti-IL-13 control antibody (\nFIG. 33\n). \nFIG. 34\n depicts deposition of IgG (\nFIG. 34\n \na\n), IgM (\nFIG. 34\n \nb\n), and C3 (\nFIG. 34\n \nc\n) in the brains of treated mice. IgG (p<0.05; \nFIG. 34\n \na\n) but not IgM (\nFIG. 34\n \nb\n) or C3 (\nFIG. 34\n \nc\n) deposits were reduced in the brains of AbS-treated mice as compared to anti-IL-13 antibody-treated controls. Staining intensity was scored on a scale of 1-5. Treatment with AbT did not reduce immune complex deposition in the kidneys or brains of MRL-Fas\nlpr \nmice (\nFIGS. 32-34\n).\n\n\nInfiltration of lymphocytes into the kidneys and lungs of MRL-Fas\nlpr \nmice was also examined histologically. Twelve-week-old male MRL-Fas\nlpr \nmice were treated (10 mg/kg i.p., 3×/week) with either saline (control) or the indicated triple-mutant antibodies. Following 10 weeks of treatment, mice were sacrificed and H/E-stained kidney and lung sections were examined for lymphocyte infiltration. Lymphocyte numbers were scored on a scale of 1-5. In the kidney, AbS but not AbT significantly reduced lymphocyte infiltration in three zones: cortex-interstitium (a support structure for the glomeruli) (\nFIG. 35\n \na\n), cortex-perivascular region (\nFIG. 35\n \nb\n), and peripelvic region (near the origin of the ureter) (\nFIG. 35\n \nc\n) (p<0.01). Both AbS and AbT treatment significantly reduced the number of lymphocytes measured in the lungs of MRL-Fas\nlpr \nmice as compared to saline-treated and anti-IL-13 antibody-treated controls (p<0.01 and p<0.05, respectively; \nFIG. 36\n).\n\n\nTaken together, these data show that treatment with AbS ameliorates lupus-like disease in MRL-Fas\nlpr \nmice, whereas treatment with AbT seemed to be less efficacious in this model of SLE. To examine the discrepancy in efficacy of AbS and AbT treatment of MRL-Fas\nlpr \nmice, sera from these mice were examined for anti-product antibody responses by ELISA. Twelve-week-old male MRL-Fas\nlpr \nmice were treated (10 mg/kg i.p.; 3×/week) with the indicated triple-mutant antibodies. Serum collected biweekly was tested by ELISA for the presence of murine antibodies capable of binding to the same human antibodies with which the mice were treated. MRL-Fas\nlpr \nmice generated anti-human antibody (MAHA) responses to all three tested antibodies as early as 2 weeks after treatment (\nFIG. 37\n \na\n). However, anti-product IgG antibody responses were more than 10-fold greater against AbT or the control antibody than against AbS (p<0.05 for AbS vs. IL-13 control). It is unlikely that the AbS CDR sequence is more immunogenic than that of AbT, as for both AbS and AbT the majority of anti-product antibodies recognized epitopes common to both molecules (\nFIG. 37\n \nb\n)\n\n\nTo examine the dose-dependency of IL-21R neutralization on disease development in the MRL-Fas\nlpr \nmodel, eight-week-old female mice were administered either AbS (10, 5 or 2.5 mg/kg doses), AbT (20 mg/kg doses) or isotype control antibody (20, 10, 5, or 2.5 mg/kg doses) i.p. 3×/week for 10 weeks. Mice were tested for anti-dsDNA serum antibodies, and examined for proteinuria, lymphadenopathy, and skin lesions every two weeks. After 10 weeks of dosing, animals were sacrificed and kidney sections were examined for immunoglobulin deposits by immunohistochemistry, and immune cell infiltrates were measured by examination of H&E-stained kidney sections.\n\n\nMRL-Fas\nlpr \nmice had detectable levels of anti-dsDNA IgG antibodies at the onset of the study, and these antibodies increased in titer over the course of the study in all treatment groups. However, treatment with AbS at all doses tested (10, 5 and 2.5 mg/kg) significantly reduced antibody titers in MRL-Fas\nlpr \nmice in a dose-dependant fashion when compared to isotype control-treated mouse serum (\nFIG. 38\n \na\n). AbT (20 mg/kg) also reduced anti-dsDNA antibody titers in these mice, but only at one time point (\nweek\n 2 of dosing) (\nFIG. 38\n \nb\n).\n\n\nTo further assess the impact of IL-21R neutralization on disease progression in MRL-Fas\nlpr \nmice, the mice were examined for clinical signs of disease. Very few of the MRL-Fas\nlpr \nmice used in this study developed skin lesions or clinically significant proteinuria, so the effects of AbS and AbT treatment on these aspects of disease could not be assessed. Treatment with AbS and AbT at all of the doses tested did not affect the development of lymphadenopathy in the study. However, IgG deposits and immune cell infiltrates were readily observed in kidneys from isotype control-treated mice, consistent with the development of lupus nephritis in these mice. Treatment with 10 mg/kg AbS significantly reduced the mean number of immune cell infiltrates and IgG deposits in the kidney, whereas treatment with 5 and 2.5 mg/kg AbS had no effect on these parameters in this study (\nFIG. 38\n \nc\n-\nd\n). Treatment with AbT at the 20 mg/kg dose increased mean number of immune cell infiltrates and did not affect IgG deposits in the kidney of MRL-Fas\nlpr \nmice in this study (\nFIG. 38\n \nc\n-\nd\n).\n\n\nExample 10.3\n\n\nIL-21R Antibodies Block Cellular Infiltration in a Murine Air Pouch Assay\n\n\nThe ability of AbS and AbT to neutralize IL-21R function in vivo was tested in a short-term murine air pouch assay. Air pouches were created by injecting 8-10 week old BALB/C mice with 3 ml of air under the dorsal skin. Three days later, pouches were reinflated. Two days after reinflation, either saline (control) or the indicated antibodies were injected i.p. at the indicated dose. Murine IL-21 (100 ng) was injected into the \nair pouch\n 24 hr after antibody injection. Six hr later, the pouches were washed out with 3 ml PBS, and total cell counts (\nFIG. 39\n \na\n), monocytes (\nFIG. 39\n \nb\n), lymphocytes (\nFIG. 39\n \nc\n), and neutrophils (\nFIG. 39\n \nd\n) were determined with a CELL-DYN® (Abbott, Abbott Park, Ill.).\n\n\nInjection of murine IL-21 into the air pouch led to a significant increase in total cells (p=0.0002), monocytes (p=0.0137), lymphocytes (p=0.0035), and neutrophils (p=0.0004) in the \nair pouch\n 6 hr later as compared to saline (\nFIG. 39\n \na\n). Treatment with either AbS or AbT led to significant reductions in cellular infiltration into the air pouch as compared to treatment with the control IgG1 (anti-IL-13). Total cellular infiltration was reduced significantly compared to the control IgG by both AbS (10 mg/kg, p=0.0031; 1 mg/kg, p=0.00426) and AbT (10 mg/kg, p=0.0198) (\nFIG. 39\n \na\n). Monocyte infiltration was significantly decreased: AbS (5 mg/kg, p=0.0031; 2 mg/kg p=0.0239; 1 mg/kg, p=0.0008) and AbT (10 mg/kg, p=0.0002; 5 mg/kg p=0.0066; 1 mg/kg, p=0.0009) (\nFIG. 39\n \nb\n). Lymphocyte infiltration was also significantly decreased: AbS (1 mg/kg, p=0.0049) and AbT (10 mg/kg, p=0.0222) (\nFIG. 39\n \nc\n). Neutrophil infiltration was significantly reduced by AbS (10 mg/kg, p=0.0032), but not AbT.\n\n\nSimilar results were obtained in a second study conducted to examine the ability of AbS and AbT in the murine air pouch model. Total cell infiltration into the air pouch was significantly reduced by AbS when administered at 10 (p=0.0113), (p=0.0027), and 2 mg/kg (p=0.029), and by AbT at 10 mg/kg (p=0.0007) (\nFIG. 39\n \ne\n).\n\n\nThe effect of AbS on cell infiltration in response to IL-21 in the rat air pouch model was also examined to determine if these antibodies could neutralize IL-21R in the rat. Pouches were created by injecting 8-week-old female S-D rats with 20 ml of air into the subcutaneous tissue of the back. Three days later, pouches were reinflated by injecting an additional 10 mL of air into the pouch. Two days later, the rats were injected with the designated amount of isotype control or AbS antibody. The next day, either saline or 1-20 μg of murine IL-21 was injected into the pouch, and six hr later the pouch contents were washed out and total cells counted using a Cell Dyne machine.\n\n\nInjection of 1 μg of murine IL-21 into the air pouch did not result in significant cell infiltration into the pouch. However, administration of 20 μg of murine IL-21 led to an increase in total cells in the \nair pouch\n 6 hr later as compared to saline, and treatment with 10 mg/kg AbS significantly reduced IL-21 mediated cell infiltration into the pouch under these conditions (p<0.05) (\nFIG. 39\n \nf\n). To determine the minimal dose of AbS that could inhibit cell infiltration into the air pouch in this rat model, additional studies were performed in which rats were administered 20 μg of murine IL-21 and either 10 mg/kg isotype control or 10, 3 or 1 mg/kg of AbS. Administration of 10 mg/kg AbS significantly reduced cell infiltration into the rat air pouch (p<0.05). A nonsignificant increase in cell infiltration into the air pouch was observed in rats treated with 3 mg/kg of AbS. Treatment with 1 mg/kg AbS significantly increased cell infiltration into the pouch compared to isotype control treated rats (p<0.05) (\nFIG. 39\n \ng\n). These observations were repeated in a second study, in which treatment with 10 mg/kg significantly reduced cell infiltration into the rat air pouch induced by 20 μg murine IL-21 (p<0.05); in this study, treatment with both 3 and 1 mg/kg AbS significantly increased cell infiltration into the pouch (p<0.05) (\nFIG. 39\n \nh\n).\n\n\nTreatment with AbS significantly increased cell infiltration into the pouch in response to IL-21 when AbS was administered at low doses (e.g., 1 mg/kg). To determine if administration of antibody alone into the pouch at low concentrations (1 mg/kg) elicited cell migration into the pouch, an additional study was performed in which rats were treated with 1 mg/kg AbS or isotype control antibody in the absence of IL-21 treatment. As observed in previous studies, administration of AbS at 10 mg/kg significantly reduced IL-21-driven cell infiltration into the pouch (p=0.0075), whereas administration of AbS at 1 mg/kg significantly increased IL-21-induced cell infiltration into the pouch (p=0.0257). Treatment with either AbS or isotype control antibody at 1 mg/kg in the absence of IL-21 treatment did not increase cell infiltration into the pouch, indicating that the increased cell infiltration into the pouch elicited by treatment with AbS at 1 mg/kg was dependent on administration of both murine IL-21 and anti-IL-21R antibody in this model (\nFIG. 39\n \ni\n).\n\n\nTo determine whether the increase in cells in the rat air pouch model was dependent on administration of the dose of murine IL-21 (20 μg), an experiment was done in which rats were treated with either 10, 20 or 40 μg murine IL-21 and either 1 or 10 mg/kg AbS. A significant inhibition of cell infiltration into the pouch was observed with 10 mg/kg AbS in response to both 10 (p=0.003) and 20 μg (p=0.003) murine IL-21. Treatment with 10 mg/kg AbS did not affect cell infiltration in response to 40 μg murine IL-21 in this study. Treatment with 1 mg/kg AbS significantly increased cell infiltration into the air pouch in response to 20 μg murine IL-21 (p=0.0454), as previously observed. However, treatment with 1 mg/kg AbS did not affect cell infiltration into rat air pouch in response to either 10 or 40 μg murine IL-21, indicating that increased cell infiltration into the rat air pouch is very specific to the dose of 1 mg/kg Abs and 20 μg murine IL-21 in this model (\nFIG. 39\n \nj\n). These data indicate that AbS can affect cell infiltration into the rat air pouch in response to murine IL-21, with inhibition of this response achieved with a dose of 10 mg/kg of AbS.\n\n\nExample 10.4\n\n\nPharmacokinetics in CD-1 Mice After Intravenous or Subcutaneous Administration of AbS\n\n\nThe serum concentrations of human anti-IL-21R antibodies were determined by qualified ELISAs as described in Table 13. The anti-IL-21R ELISA used a monomeric His-tagged IL-21R as a capture reagent and an anti-human-Fc (conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP)) as a detector reagent. The enzyme substrate, 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), was used to produce a colored endproduct to visualize the bound test article. Optical density (OD) was measured calorimetrically at a wavelength of 405 or 450 nm. Sample concentrations were determined by interpolation from a standard curve that was fit using a four-parameter equation.\n\n\nPharmacokinetic parameters were calculated based on mean concentrations. Individual concentration values below the LOQ were treated as zero for calculation of the mean and SD. The PK parameters were determined using a noncompartmental analysis module (\nModel\n 200 for i.p. and s.c. dosing and \nModule\n 201 for i.v. dosing) of the PK software package WinNonlin (version 4.1; Pharsight, Mountain View, Calif.). The program applies a model-independent approach and the standard methods described by Gibaldi and Perrier (Pharmacokinetics (2nd ed. 1982) Marcel-Dekker, Inc., New York). The area under the serum concentration vs. time curve (AUC) was calculated using the linear trapezoidal method. The slope of the apparent terminal phase was estimated by log-linear regression using at least three data points and the terminal rate constant (λ) was derived from the slope. AUC\n0-∞\n was estimated as the sum of the AUC\n0-∞\n (where t is the time of the last measurable concentration) and C\nt\n/λ. The apparent elimination half-life (t\n1/2\n) was calculated as 0.693/λ. Predictions of concentrations after a multiple dose regimens, were conducted by nonparametric superposition using WinNonlin software.\n\n\nAfter intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg of AbS to male CD-1 mice, the exposure (AUC\n0-∞\n) of AbS was 7272 μg*hr/ml. The mean concentration at the first sampling time point after intravenous administration (C\n5min\n) was 113 μg/ml. The elimination of AbS in CD-1 mice was relatively slow, as evidenced by the low total body clearance (CL) of ˜1.4 ml/hr/kg and long elimination half-life (t\n1/2\n) of 162 hr (˜6.8 days). The steady-state volume of distribution (Vd\nSS\n) was 306 ml/kg, suggesting that AbS was mainly confined to the vascular system (\nFIG. 40\n; Table 14).\n\n\nPharmacokinetics of AbS in CD-1 mice appeared linear in the 10-100 mg/kg dose range. After intravenous administration of 100 mg/kg of AbS to male CD-1 mice, AUC\n0-∞\n was 75792 μg*hr/ml, C\n5min \nwas 1160 μg/ml, CL was ˜1.3 ml/hr/kg, Vd\nSS \nwas 473 ml/kg, and elimination half-life was ˜391 hr (˜16.2 days) (\nFIG. 40\n; Table 14).\n\n\nAfter 10 mg/kg s.c. administration of AbS to CD-1 mice the absorption of AbS was slow (T\nmax \nof 48 hr) and the subcutaneous bioavailability was 81%. The mean t\n1/2 \nvalue after subcutaneous administration was ˜195 hr (˜8.1 days) and similar to that observed after 10 mg/kg intravenous administration.\n\n\nThe presence of anti-AbS antibodies was evaluated using a qualified immunoassay at 576 hr (24 days) and 672 hr (28 days) following 10 mg/kg i.v. or s.c. administration of AbS to CD-1 mice (n=8 per time point per group). An electrochemiluminescent, paramagnetic bead assay was used to detect anti-AbS antibodies. In this assay, samples were coincubated with biotinylated AbS overnight. Streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads were incubated with the mixture. After incubation with the beads, the plate was placed in the BioVeris M-\nSeries\n 384 Analyzer. A magnet was applied to capture the paramagnetic beads onto a surface electrode, and unbound reactants were washed away. The ruthenylated AbS captured on the beads was electrically excited by a voltage application, resulting in the production of light. The light was measured by photodetectors with the read-out in response units (RU).\n\n\nPositive and negative controls were also used to determine the cutpoint RU, which was defined as twice the mean RU of the negative control. Samples were initially tested in a screening format at dilutions of 1:25 and 1:75. Samples generating an RU greater than or equal to the cutpoint RU were considered positive and reanalyzed in a full-dilution series to confirm the positive result and determine the titer (the reciprocal dilution that would generate an RU equal to the cutpoint RU). For positive samples, the log of titer is reported. The minimum required dilution was 1:25, and the limit of detection was 1.40 (the log of 25). Therefore, negative samples were designated as <1.40.\n\n\nIn both i.v. and s.c. treatment groups, 5 or 6 (of 8) mice per time point per group tested positive for anti-AbS antibodies (Table 15). The majority of the mice with detectable anti-AbS antibodies had lower AbS concentrations than those observed in animals without anti-AbS antibodies; of some note, the high levels of AbS in some samples could have interfered with the detection of anti-AbS antibodies. The summary of the onset of anti-AbS antibody response across various times, and across animal species and strains/models, is shown in Table 23.\n\n\nThe presence of anti-AbS antibodies was also tested at 648 hr (27 days), 984 hr (41 days), and 1320 hr (55 days) following 100 mg/kg i.v. of AbS to CD-1 mice (n=3 per time point). None of the mice tested were positive for anti-AbS antibodies at these time points.\n\n\nExample 10.5\n\n\nPharmacokinetics in DBA and MRL-Fas\nlpr \nMice After Intraperitoneal Administration of AbS\n\n\nThe serum concentrations of human anti-IL-21R antibodies were determined by qualified ELISAs as described in Table 13. The anti-IL-21R ELISA used anti-human-Fc as a capture reagent and biotinylated anti-human-Fc as a detector reagent. Avidin-HRP, and the enzyme substrate TMB or 2,2′-azino di (3-ethyl-benzthiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS), were used to produce a colored endproduct. OD was measured calorimetrically at a wavelength of 405 or 450 nm. Sample concentrations were determined by interpolation from a standard curve that was fit using a four-parameter equation. PK parameters were calculated as noted in Example 10.4. Predictions of concentrations after a multiple dose regimens, were conducted by nonparametric superposition using WinNonlin software and assuming linear kinetics in MRL-Fas\nlpr \nand DBA mice in the 2.5-10 mg/kg dose range (single dose).\n\n\nFollowing a single i.p. dose of 8 mg/kg of AbS to male DBA mice, the maximum serum concentration (C\nmax\n) and exposure (AUC\n0-∞\n) of AbS were 62 μg/ml and 7229 μg*hr/ml, respectively. The T\nmax \nand the elimination half-life (t\n1/2\n) of AbS were 6 hr and 140 hr (˜5.8 days), respectively (\nFIG. 41\n). Out of eight animals tested, three developed anti-AbS antibody response at 672 hr, determined using the paramagnetic bead assay described in Example 10.4 (Table 12). The summary of the onset of anti-AbS antibody across various times and species/strains is shown in Table 23.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormation of Anti-AbS Antibodies After a Single 8 mg/kg i.p.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDose to DBA Mice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOnset (hr)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n408 \nhr\n \n\n\n504 \nhr\n \n\n\n576 \nhr\n \n\n\n672 \nhr\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPositive\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n0 of 8\n\n\n0 of 8\n\n\n0 of 8\n\n\n3 of 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing a single intraperitoneal dose of 10 mg/kg to female, 12-week-old MRL-Fas\nlpr \nmice, the maximum serum concentration (C\nmax\n) and exposure (AUC\n0-∞\n) of AbS were 51 μg/ml and 2798 μg*hr/ml, respectively. The T\nmax \nand the elimination half-life (t\n1/2\n) of AbS were 3 hr and 46 hr (˜1.9 days), respectively (\nFIG. 41\n).\n\n\nCompared to DBA and CD-1 mice, dose-normalized exposure of AbS appeared to be lower in MRL-Fas\nlpr \nmice (Table 14). This was not entirely unexpected, as fast elimination of normal IgG in MRL-Fas\nlpr \nmice (especially with disease symptoms) and in SLE patients has been reported (see Zhou et al. (2005) \nLupus \n4(6):458-66; Newkirk et al. (1996) \nClin. Exp. Immunol. \n106(2):259-64; Wochner (1970) \nJ. Clin. Invest. \n49(3):454-64). The hypercatabolism of mouse IgG in MRL-Fas\nlpr \nmice has been proposed to be due to the disease-induced impairment of the function of the receptor FcRn, which regulates the homeostasis of IgG (Zhou et al. (2005) supra). As AbS is a human IgG, differences in elimination of AbS at the terminal phase among the different strains of mice also may be explained, at least in part, by a differential MAHA response.\n\n\nWhen AbS was administered to MRL-Fas\nlpr \nmice i.p. at 2.5, 5, or 10 mg/kg per \ndose\n 3×/week for 10 weeks (Example 10.2), all dose groups had significant reduction in titers of anti-dsDNA antibodies compared to the isotype control (anti-human IL-13 human IgG1 triple-mutant). For the 2.5 and 10 mg/kg dose groups, steady-state trough levels of AbS were assayed by ELISA. At 2- and 4-week time points, almost all samples tested from the 2.5 mg/kg group had undetectable levels (<34 ng/ml) of AbS in the serum; one sample had very low levels (57 ng/ml). For the 10 mg/kg group, there was high interanimal variability in the AbS serum concentrations; however, median steady-state trough levels were ˜3-10 fold higher, compared to those predicted by simulations using PK data from the single dose study in MRL-Fas\nlpr \nmice (\nFIG. 42\n). When single-dose i.p. data obtained in the DBA mouse strain were used for predictions, there appeared to be an improved correlation between the observed and predicted AbS concentrations in the 10 mg/kg/dose group (\nFIG. 42\n). Without intending to be bound by theory, a possible explanation for the undetectable levels of AbS in the low-dose group is marked MAHA production triggered by multiple administration of AbS at relatively low dose levels, as week-2 serum samples from the 2.5 mg/kg/dose group were assayed for anti-AbS antibodies and all samples had very high titers above the upper limit of quantitation of 4.74 log titer units. However, in lieu of expected pharmacological action of AbS to delay and/or reduce IgG responses, it is possible that higher dosage of AbS under the multiple dose regimens would reduce MAHA response against itself, resulting in higher observed serum AbS concentrations, compared to those expected based solely on the single-dose PK data. In fact, in MRL-Fas\nlpr \nmice, MAHA response to AbS was ˜10-fold lower, compared to that to an isotype control human IgG administered via the same multiple dose regimen of 10 mg/\nkg\n 3×/week for 10 weeks (\nFIG. 37\n \na\n).\n\n\nExample 10.6\n\n\nPK of AbS in Female Cynomolgus Monkeys\n\n\nPK of AbS in female monkeys were determined following a single 10 mg/kg i.v. or s.c. administration. Individual animal and mean concentration-time profiles from this study are shown in \nFIGS. 43\n \na \nand \n43\n \nb\n, respectively, and mean PK parameters are summarized in Table 14.\n\n\nThe serum concentrations of human anti-IL-21R antibodies were determined by qualified ELISAs as described in Table 12. The anti-IL-21R ELISA used a monomeric His-tagged IL-21R as a capture reagent and an anti-human-Fc conjugated to HRP as a detector reagent, as described for CD-1 mice in Example 10.4. The serum concentration of the isotype control antibody in monkeys (anti-IL-13 antibody) was also measured by ELISA. In this assay, the recombinant human IL-13 ligand, which contains a FLAG octapeptide fusion tag, was captured by an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. The serum samples containing anti-IL-13 antibody were detected with an anti-human-Fc-HRP. The enzyme substrate ABTS was used to produce a colored endproduct to visualize the bound test article. PK parameters were calculated for each individual animal using noncompartmental methods.\n\n\nAll six female monkeys that were administered AbS at 10 mg/kg (n=3 for both i.v. and s.c. routes of administration) had a sharp drop in AbS levels in the terminal phase (at ˜408 hr post-dose), suggesting the possible formation of anti-product antibodies. The elimination half-life values in the 10 mg/kg groups were calculated with and without the time points at which a sharp concentration drop was observed.\n\n\nAfter a single 10 mg/kg i.v. administration of AbS to female cynomolgus monkeys, the mean serum clearance (CL) was 1.03 ml/hr/kg and the mean elimination half-life (t\n1/2\n) was 74 hr (˜3 days). When time points at which a sharp concentration drop was observed were excluded from calculations, the mean t\n1/2 \nestimate was ˜7.9 days. The mean steady-state volume of distribution (Vd\nSS\n) was low (˜125 ml/kg), suggesting that AbS was mainly confined to the vascular system. The mean exposure (AUC\n0-∞\n) of AbS was 9728 μg*hr/ml.\n\n\nAfter a single 100 mg/kg i.v. administration of AbS to cynomolgus monkeys, CL was ˜1.08 ml/hr/kg, t\n1/2 \nwas 279 hr (˜11.6 days), AUC\n0-∞\n was ˜92867 μg*hr/ml, and Vd\nSS \nwas ˜211 ml/kg. Thus, in general, the PK of AbS were approximately linear in the 10-100 mg/kg dose range.\n\n\nAfter 10 mg/kg s.c. administration of AbS to female monkeys, the absorption of AbS was slow (mean T\nmax \nof ˜34 hr) and the mean s.c. bioavailability was ˜43%. The mean t\n1/2 \nvalue after 10 mg/kg s.c. administration to monkeys was 52 hr (˜2.2 days), and similar to that observed after 10 mg/kg i.v. administration. When time points at which a sharp concentration drop was observed were excluded from calculations, the mean t\n1/2 \nwas 258 hr (˜10.8 days).\n\n\nAll six female monkeys that were administered AbS at 10 mg/kg had detectable anti-AbS antibodies starting at 504 hr (3 weeks) post-dose (Table 16), determined using the paramagnetic bead assay described in Example 10.4. These data are consistent with the observed sharp drop in AbS serum levels. The anti-AbS response persisted at all subsequent time points (up to 27 weeks). Thus, the anti-AbS antibody response appears to affect the PK of AbS in monkeys after a single 10 mg/kg i.v. or s.c. administration. For the 100 mg/kg i.v. dose group, 1 of 3 monkeys was positive for anti-AbS antibodies at \n \nweeks\n \n 6 and 8, with log titers of 1.8 and 4.6, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE

described in Table 17. The anti-IL-21R ELISA used a monomeric His-tagged IL-21R as a capture reagent and an anti-human-Fc (conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP)) as a detector reagent for CD-1 mice, and anti-human Fc as a capture reagent and biotinylated anti-human Fc as a detector reagent for DBA and MRL-Fas\nlpr \nmice. PK parameters were calculated as noted in Example 10.4. Predictions of concentrations after a multiple dose regimens were conducted by nonparametric superposition using WinNonlin software and assuming linear kinetics in MRL-Fas\nlpr \nand DBA mice in the 2.5-10 mg/kg dose range (single dose) for AbS and in the 8-20 mg/kg dose range (single dose) for AbT.\n\n\nAfter i.v. administration of 10 mg/kg of AbT to male CD-1 mice, the exposure (AUC\n0-∞\n) of AbT was 4551 μg*hr/ml (\nFIG. 44\n \na\n; Table 18). The mean concentration at the first sampling time point after i.v. administration (C5 min) was ˜70 μg/ml. The elimination of AbT in CD-1 mice was relatively slow, as evidenced by the low total body clearance (CL) of ˜2.2 ml/hr/kg and long elimination half-life (t\n1/2\n) of 210 hr (˜8.8 days). The steady-state volume of distribution (Vd\nSS\n) was 572 ml/kg. Following 10 mg/kg i.v. administration to mice, AbT appeared to have higher CL (˜60% increase), lower AUC\n0-∞\n (˜37% decrease) and larger Vd\nSS \n(˜87% increase), compared to the corresponding values for AbS.\n\n\nFollowing a single i.p. dose of 8 mg/kg to male DBA mice, the maximum serum concentration (C\nmax\n) and exposure (AUC\n0-∞\n) of AbT were 21 μg/ml and 3320 μg*hr/ml, respectively (\nFIG. 44\n \nc\n; Table 18). The T\nmax \nand the elimination half-life (t\n1/2\n) of AbT were 1 hr and 80 hr (˜3.3 days), respectively. After i.p. administration to DBA mice, AbT exposure and half-life were reduced ˜54% and ˜43%, respectively, compared to the corresponding PK parameters of AbS.\n\n\nFollowing a single i.p. dose of 10 mg/kg to female 12-week-old MRL-Fas\nlpr \nmice, the maximum serum concentration (C\nmax\n) and exposure (AUC\n0-∞\n) of AbT were 23 μg/ml and 957 μg*hr/ml, respectively (\nFIG. 44\n \nb\n; Table 18). The T\nmax \nand the elimination half-life (t\n1/2\n) of AbT were 6 hr and 21 hr, respectively. After i.p. administration to MRL-Fas\nlpr \nmice, AbT exposure and half-life was reduced ˜66% and ˜54%, respectively, compared to the corresponding PK parameters of AbS. At 2 weeks, the only time point for AbT at which a reduction in anti-ds DNA titers was observed, median AbT levels were 4-5-fold higher compared to those predicted by simulations using PK data from the single-dose study in MRL-Fas\nlpr \nmice and similar compared to those predicted by simulation with single-dose data obtained from DBA mice (\nFIG. 45\n). This observation is in line with that for the \nAbS\n 10 mg/kg group. Without intending to be bound by theory, a possible explanation for relatively lower levels of AbT at the 2-week time point (compared to those of AbS) and undetectable levels of AbT at later time points is marked MAHA production triggered by multiple administrations of AbT and the inability of AbT to suppress the MAHA response against itself.\n\n\nIn line with results described for AbT, dose-normalized exposure of AbT appeared to be lower in MRL-Fas\nlpr \nmice, compared to those in DBA and CD-1 mice (Table 18).\n\n\nUnlike AbS, when AbT was administered to MRL-Fas\nlpr \nmice i.p. at 10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg per \ndose\n 3×/week for 10 weeks, only limited effects on the development of disease in MRL-Fas\nlpr \nmice were observed (Example 10.2). Administration of AbT (10 mg/kg) did not result in significant reduction of titers of anti-dsDNA at all time points evaluated. Twenty mg/kg administration of AbT resulted in transient reduction in titers of anti-dsDNA at 2 weeks; however anti-dsDNA titers were not different from control at later time points (4, 6, 8, and 10 weeks) (Table 19). For the 20 mg/kg AbT group, steady-state trough levels of AbT were assayed by ELISA. There was high interanimal variability in the AbT serum concentrations; however, in general, median steady-state trough levels of AbT appeared to have an inverse correlation with the effect on median anti-dsDNA titers (Table 19). At 2 weeks, median AbT levels were ˜8-fold higher than those at 4 weeks (but still lower than median AbS levels at 2 weeks in the 10 mg/kg group). At later time points (4, 6, 8, and 10 weeks), median AbT trough levels were less than the limit of detection (˜66 ng/ml). At 2 weeks, the only time point for AbT at which a reduction in anti-dsDNA titers was observed, median AbT levels were 4-5-fold higher compared to those predicted by simulations using PK data from the single-dose study in MRL-Fas\nlpr \nmice and similar compared to those predicted by simulation with single-dose data obtained from DBA mice (\nFIG. 45\n). This observation is in line with that for the \nAbS\n 10 mg/kg group. Without intending to be bound by theory, a possible explanation for relatively lower levels of AbT at the 2-week time point (compared to those of AbS) and undetectable levels of AbT at later time points, is marked MAHA production triggered by multiple administrations of AbT and the inability of AbT to suppress the MAHA response against itself.\n\n\nExample 10.8\n\n\nPK of AbT in Cynomolgus Monkeys\n\n\nPK of AbT in female monkeys were determined following a single i.v. (10 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg) or s.c. (10 mg/kg) administration. Mean concentration-time profiles from this study were compared to those for AbS (\nFIGS. 46\n \na\n-\nb\n) and mean PK parameters are summarized in Table 18.\n\n\nThe serum concentrations of human anti-IL-21R antibodies were determined by qualified ELISAs as described in Table 17. The anti-IL-21R ELISA used a monomeric His-tagged IL-21R as a capture reagent and an anti-human-Fc conjugated to HRP as a detector reagent, as described in Example 10.6. TMB was used to produce a colored endproduct to visualize the bound test article. The serum concentration of the isotype control antibody in monkeys (anti-IL-13 antibody) was also measured by ELISA, as described in Example 10.6. PK parameters were calculated as noted in Example 10.6.\n\n\nAfter a single 10 mg/kg intravenous administration of AbT to female cynomolgus monkeys, the mean serum clearance (CL) was 7.01 ml/hr/kg and the mean elimination half-life (t\n1/2\n) was ˜2.6 days. The mean steady-state volume of distribution (Vd\nSS\n) was ˜202 ml/kg and the mean exposure (AUC\n0-∞\n) of AbT was 1476 μg*hr/ml (Table 18).\n\n\nAfter a single 100 mg/kg i.v. administration of AbT to cynomolgus monkeys, CL was ˜4.87 ml/hr/kg, t\n1/2 \nwas ˜3.7 days, AUC\n0-∞\n was ˜20955 μg*hr/ml, and Vd\nSS \nwas ˜146 ml/kg (Table 18). There was no significant difference between the mean PK parameters of AbT in monkeys after a 10 vs. 100 mg/kg single i.v. dose; thus the PK of AbT were approximately linear in the 10-100 mg/kg dose range.\n\n\nAfter a 10 mg/kg s.c. administration of AbT to monkeys, the mean T\nmax \nwas ˜6 hr and the mean subcutaneous bioavailability was ˜43%. The mean t\n1/2 \nvalue after a 10 mg/kg s.c. administration to monkeys was 63 hr (˜2.6 days), and similar to that observed after a 10 or 100 mg/kg i.v. administration (Table 18).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nELISA Summary for AbT in Mouse and Female Monkey Serum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nRange of\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSerum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nquantitation\n\n\nMinimum\n\n\n \n\n\nused for\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecies\n\n\nAssay\n\n\nAssay\n\n\n(ng/ml in 100%\n\n\nRequired\n\n\nStandard\n\n\nassay\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstrain\n\n\nCapture\n\n\nDetector\n\n\nserum)\n\n\nDilution\n\n\ncurve (ng/ml)\n\n\ndiluent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMouse\n\n\nanti-human\n\n\nanti-human\n\n\n32-500\n\n\n20\n\n\n0.78-100 (in\n\n\nS-D rat\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDBA\n\n\nIgG\n\n\nIgG-\nbiotin\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5% serum)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMouse\n\n\nanti-human\n\n\nanti-human\n\n\n66.8-1260 \n\n\n40\n\n\n0.514-102\n\n\nC57BL/6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMRL\nlpr\n \n\n\nIgG\n\n\nIgG-biotin\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(in 2.5%\n\n\nmouse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nserum)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMouse\n\n\nMonomeric\n\n\nanti-human\n\n\n45-768\n\n\n20\n\n\n1-38.4 (in 5%\n\n\nCD-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCD-1\n\n\nHis-tagged\n\n\nIgG-HRP\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nserum)\n\n\nmouse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIl-21R\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonkey\n\n\nMonomeric\n\n\nanti-human\n\n\n30-512\n\n\n20\n\n\n0.44-38.4 (in\n\n\nPooled\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(cyno)\n\n\nHis-tagged\n\n\nIgG-\nHRP\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5% serum)\n\n\ncyno\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIl-21R\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMean PK Parameters of AbT in Mice and Female Monkeys\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDose\n\n\nC\n5 min \nor\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecies\n\n\n(mg/kg),\n\n\nC\nmax\n \na\n \n\n\nT\nmax\n \n\n\nAUC\n0-∞\n \n\n\nCL\n\n\nVd\nss\n \n\n\nt\n1/2\n \n\n\nF\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstrain\n\n\nRoute\n\n\n(μg/ml)\n\n\n(hr)\n\n\n(μ * hr/ml)\n\n\n(ml/hr/kg)\n\n\n(ml/kg)\n\n\n(hr)\n\n\n(%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMouse\n \n\n\n 8, i.p.\n\n\n21\n\n\n1\n\n\n3320\n\n\n \nNA\n \n \nNA\n \n \n\n\n80\n\n\n \nND\n \n \n \n\n\nDBA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMouse\n \n \n \n \n\n\n 10, i.p.\n\n\n23\n\n\n6\n\n\n 957\n\n\n \nNA\n \n \nNA\n \n \n\n\n21\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMRL\nlpr\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMouse\n\n\n 10, i.v.\n\n\n70\n\n\nNA\n\n\n4551\n\n\n2.194\n\n\n572\n\n\n210 \n\n\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCD-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMonkey\n \n\n\n 10, i.v.\n\n\n113 ± 14\n\n\nNA\n\n\n1476 ± 312\n\n\n7.01 ± 1.68\n\n\n202 ± 44\n\n\n63 ± 24\n\n\n \nNA\n \n \n \n\n\ncyno\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n 10, s.c.\n\n\n11 ± 3\n\n\n6 ± 0\n\n\n638 ± 56\n\n\nNA\n\n\nNA\n\n\n63 ± 10\n\n\n43 ± 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n100, i.v.\n\n\n1850 ± 415\n\n\nNA\n\n\n20955 ± 3702\n\n\n4.87 ± 0.79\n\n\n146 ± 24\n\n\n88 ± 34\n\n\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedian AbS and AbT Concentrations After Multiple Dosing to\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMRL\nlpr \nMice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntibody (Dose)\n\n\n2 \nwk\n \n\n\n4 \nwk\n \n\n\n6 \nwk\n \n\n\n8 \nwk\n \n\n\n10 wk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbS (2.5 mg/kg)\n\n\n0*\n\n\n   0*\n\n\nND*\n\n\nND\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbS (10 mg/kg)\n\n\n137940*\n\n\n196887*\n\n\n198707*\n\n\n68363\n\n\n49563\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbT (20 mg/kg)\n\n\n94456*\n\n\n12765\n\n\n  0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 10.9\n\n\nPharmacokinetics of \n125\nI-D5 in DBA Mice\n\n\nThe \n125\nI-anti-murine IL-21R antibody D5-20 (“D5”) was injected intraperitoneally into nonfasted male DBA mice in a single 8 mg/kg dose. Serum samples were taken at time points from 1-576 hr, and D5 levels were quantified by measuring trichloroacetic acid (TCA)-precipitable radioactivity. The PK profile of D5 antibody after i.p. dosage to DBA mice was, in general, similar to that of the human anti-IL-21R antibodies (Table 20, \nFIG. 47\n; see also Tables 14 and 18).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPharmacookinetic Parameters of \n125\nI-D5 in Male DBA Mice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nC\nmax\n \n\n\nAUC\n0-∞\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nt\n1/2 \n(hr)\n\n\nT\nmax \n(hr)\n\n\n(μg/mL)\n\n\n(μg * hr/ml)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n125\nI-D5\n\n\n143.9\n\n\n6\n\n\n36\n\n\n5422\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 10.10\n\n\nPharmacokinetics in Sprague-Dawley Rats After Intravenous, Subcutaneous, or Intraperitoneal Administration of Anti-IL-21R Antibodies\n\n\nPK of AbS, AbT, AbV, AbU, and AbW, as well as an isotype control antibody, were examined after a single 10 mg/kg i.v. dose to S-D rats. Bioanalytical assay for quantitation of test article serum concentrations, an assay for detection of anti-AbS antibodies in rat serum, and pharmacokinetic calculations were performed as described for AbS and AbT for monkeys (Examples 10.6 and 10.8), with the following modifications: S-D serum was used as an assay diluent and LOQ for test article serum concentration assay was 45 ng/mL. For the ELISA method employed for an isotype control, an anti-human Fc antibody was used as both the capture and detector.\n\n\nFollowing a single 10 mg/kg i.v. dose to S-D rats, antibody AbS was eliminated slowly (CL ˜1.6 mL/hr/kg); albeit significantly faster (p<0.05) than that for an isotype control IgG (˜0.4 mL/hr/kg). (Table 21 and \nFIG. 48\n \na\n). All rats (n=6) had a sharp decline in AbS serum concentration, such that there was no detectable AbS at and after \nday\n 15 post-dose. This decline in AbS serum concentration was likely related to the presence of anti-AbS antibodies detected at \nday\n 15 and all subsequent time points in all six animals. It should be noted that differences in concentration-time profiles in rats between the AbS and the control IgG are not likely to be explained entirely by anti-product responses, as mean serum concentrations started to diverge as early as 24 hr post-dose and differed by more than 4-fold at the one-week time point. The concentration-time profile and PK parameters of AbV closely resembled those of AbS in rats.\n\n\nAfter a single 10 mg/kg i.v. dose to rats, AbT elimination was faster (CL ˜2.1 mL/hr/kg) and the resulting AUC\n0-∞\n was ˜2-fold lower, compared to AbS. All of six AbT-dosed rats also had a sharp decline in the serum concentrations in the terminal phase. The concentration-time profiles of AbU and AbW and PK parameters (such as AUC\n0-∞\n, AUC\n0-240hr\n, and CL) in rats were intermediate between those of AbS and AbT (\nFIG. 48\n \nb\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPharmacokinetic Properties of Anti-IL-21R Antibodies in S-D Rats\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter 10 mg/kg i.v.

Therefore, t\n1/2 \nvalues were not used for comparison of PK across constructs and are not shown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor AbS, PK in rats was also examined after 10 mg/kg s.c. and i.p. administrations, as well as at two dose levels (1 and 10 mg/mg) after i.v. administration.\n\n\nAt 168-504 hr after a single i.v., s.c., or i.p. administration to rats, there was a sharp decline in AbS levels in all animals (\nFIG. 49\n). In the i.v. and s.c. groups, AbS levels were below LOQ for the assay (45.0 ng/mL) at 360 hr through the end of the study (840 hr). In the i.p. group, there was no detectable AbS starting at 576 hr through the end of the study. Using the paramagnetic bead assay described in Examples 10.4 and 11, anti-AbS antibodies were detected in all animals for all dose groups as early as 360 hr post-dose (the first sampling time-point taken for anti-AbS antibody evaluation) and persisted through the end of the study (840 hr). Log titers for the anti-AbS response reached 4.01 to >4.74 units by the end of the study for all samples tested. Thus, the sharp decline in AbS was likely related to the formation of anti-AbS antibodies.\n\n\nAfter a single 1 or 10 mg/kg i.v. dose of AbS in rats, the average exposures (AUC\n0-∞\n) were 470±45 or 6361±845 μg·hr/mL, respectively (Table 22). The average steady-state volume of distribution (Vd\nss\n) after a single 1 or 10 mg/kg i.v. dose of AbS was low (101±24 or 191±33 mL/kg, respectively), suggesting that AbS was mainly distributed throughout the vascular space and into limited extracellular fluids after i.v. administration. The average clearance (CL) of AbS was 2.14±0.21 and 1.60±0.21 mL/hr/kg for the 1 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg i.v. doses, respectively. The average elimination half-life (t\n1/2\n) was 40±10 and 113±24 hr for the 1 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg i.v. doses, respectively. AbS PK parameters were not dose-proportional in the 1-10 mg/kg dose range after i.v. administration to rats, as the average dose-normalized exposures (AUC\n0-∞\n/dose), CL, and t\n1/2 \nwere significantly different (p<0.01, unpaired t-test) between the 1 and 10 mg/kg dose groups.\n\n\nAfter a single 10 mg/kg i.p. dose of AbS to rats, the average serum AUC\n0-∞\n was 3929±979 μg·hr/mL and the average estimated bioavailability (BA) was 62±15% (with the AUC\n0-∞\n data from the 10 mg/kg, i.v. group used for the BA calculation) (Table 22). The average serum C\nmax \nwas 31±14 μg/mL and was reached at T\nmax \nof 20±9 hr.

Briefly, ˜100-200 μg of test article were incubated for 25 min with 1-2 mCi of \n125\nI (PerkinElmer), three IODO-BEADS, and ˜100-200 μl of PBS. The reaction mixture was separated from the IODO-BEADS and transferred to a Centricon filtration device (10 kD cut-off, Millipore). The purification was performed by adding ˜5-10 ml of PBS (in aliquots of 1-2 mL) and spinning at 2,000×g until the volume in the upper chamber of the filtration device was down to ˜200-500 μl.\n\n\nThe dosing solution was prepared by combining the stock solution of unlabeled test article, the formulation buffer, and the \n125\nI tracer. The purity of the dosing solution was analyzed using reducing and nonreducing SDS-PAGE. The dosing solution was prepared once, one day prior to dosing of the first cohort of animals.\n\n\nExample 11.2\n\n\nDetermination of Radioactive Equivalent Concentrations in Serum\n\n\nTotal radioactivity (in counts per min (cpm)) in 50-100 μl of serum samples (in duplicate) was determined by gamma-counting (1480 WIZARD™, Wallac Inc., Gaithersburg, Md.). An equal volume of 20% TCA (trichloroacetic acid) was added to each aliquot, and samples were spun at ˜12,000 rpm for 10 min. TCA-soluble radioactivity in the supernatant (with the volume equal to the sample volume used for total radioactivity count) was determined by gamma-counting. TCA-precipitable radioactivity in a given sample [total cpm−2×TCA−soluble cpm], the specific activity of the dosing solution (cpm/ng), as well as the dates of the sample (t\nS \n(day)) and the dosing solution (t\nD \n(day)) measurements, were used to calculate the radioactive equivalent concentration (ng eq/ml) in a given sample using the formula: [average TCA−precipitable cpm/EXP(−0.693/60.2×(t\nS\n−t\nD\n)]/[specific activity×sample volume].\n\n\nExample 11.3\n\n\nDetermination of the Cumulative Total Count (as Percentage of Dose Count) and Free \n125\nIodine Fraction in Urine\n\n\nTotal counts were used to calculate urinary excretion (excreted cpm as % dose) for each collection period, using the formula: [100%×urine cpm/EXP(−0.693/60.2×(t\nS\n−t\nD\n))]/[specific activity×dose]. Cumulative radioactivity in the urine (cumulative excreted cpm as % dose) was defined as the sum of urinary excretions (cpm, as % dose) from \ntime\n 0 up to an indicated time point.\n\n\nTo determine the fraction of TCA-soluble radioactivity, 50 μl urine aliquots were mixed with 50 μl of normal mouse serum (resulting in 100 μl samples) and analyzed by gamma-counting. A 100 μl aliquot of 20% TCA was added to each 100 μl sample, and the 200 μl samples were spun at ˜12,000 rpm for 10 min. TCA-soluble radioactivity in the 100 μl of supernatant was determined by gamma-counting. The fraction of free iodine was obtained using the formula: [2×100%×TCA-soluble cpm in 100 μl of supernatant/total cpm in 50 μl of urine].\n\n\nExample 11.4\n\n\nBiodistribution Analysis\n\n\nTissue samples were placed into preweighed tubes, weighed to determine tissue weights in grams, and counted for total radioactivity (cpm). The quantitation of radioactive equivalent tissue concentration (ng eq/g) was based on the total radioactivity in tissues and the specific activity of the dosing solution (cpm/ng) after a correction for half-life of \n125\nI using the formula: [sample cpm/EXP(−0.693/60.2×(t\nS\n−t\nD\n)]/[specific activity×sample weight].\n\n\nTissue to serum concentration ratios (T/S) for a given tissue at a given time point were calculated using the ratio of radioactive equivalent concentration in tissue (μg eq/g) to that in serum (μg eq/ml). Total tissue counts as % dose were calculated using the formula: [100%×sample cpm/EXP(−0.693/60.2×(t\nS\n−t\nD\n)]/[specific activity×dose].\n\n\nExample 11.5\n\n\nPharmacokinetics and Biodistribution in Control and IL-21R Knockout Mice After a 2.5 mg/kg Intravenous Dose\n\n\nIn wild-type C57BL/6 (control) mice, there was a decline in mean AbS serum levels relative to those in IL-21R knockout mice, starting at 10-14 days after a single 2.5 mg/kg i.v. dose of \n125\nI-AbS (\nFIG. 50\n \nc\n). At day 14 (336 hr), 60% of controls (n=10) and 0% of IL-21R knockout mice (n=10) had undetectable or very low levels of AbS. After day 20 (480 hr), there were no detectable AbS levels in the serum of all control mice. In IL-21R knockout mice, AbS was detected in serum as late as day 36 (864 hr) post-dose, the last sampling time point. The differences in concentration-time profile of \n125\nI-AbS in control vs. IL-21R knockout appears to be due to possible differences in anti-AbS responses in these two mouse strains. At the five-week time point, about 55% (five out of nine) wild-type serum samples and none of IL-21R knock out serum samples tested positive in the anti-AbS antibody assay.\n\n\nIn control mice, the total body clearance (CL) was ˜1.3 ml/hr/kg, and the elimination half-life (t\n1/2\n) was 120 hr (˜5.0 days). In IL-21R knockout mice, CL was ˜0.7 ml/hr/kg, and t\n1/2 \nwas 256 hr (10.7 days) (Table 14). Accordingly, after a 2.5 mg/kg i.v. dose, IL-21R knockout mice had a higher serum exposure (AUC\n0-∞\n) as compared to controls (Table 14).\n\n\nIn general, for both controls and IL-21R knockout mice, the highest concentrations of \n125\nI-AbS were found in serum as compared to other tissues examined (\nFIGS. 50\n \na \nand \n50\n \nb\n; Tables 24 and 25). However, at the last tissue sampling time point (864 hr), detectable \n125\nI-AbS levels were found in tissues, but not in serum, of control mice.\n\n\nIn accordance with differences in serum levels of AbS between control and IL-21R knockout mice, radioactive equivalent concentrations of AbS in tissues were lower in controls as compared to IL-21R knockouts, starting at ˜2 weeks post-dose (\nFIG. 50\n). Likewise, tissue elimination half-lives (t\n1/2\n) were shorter in control mice (˜90-165 hr) as compared to those in tissues of IL-21R knockout mice (˜230-270 hr). Accordingly, the tissue exposures (AUC\n0-∞\n) were lower in control mice compared to IL-21R knockout mice (Table 26). Thus, after a 2.5 mg/kg i.v. dose of \n125\nI to IL-21R knockout mice, exposure in both serum and tissues was higher as compared to controls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

In fact, 4 of 4 mice at the 312 hr time point, and 4 of 4 mice at the 408 hr time point, tested positive for anti-product antibodies (with relative media titers of ˜4.01 and ˜4.43 log titer units, respectively). After a 2.5 mg/kg i.p. dose of \n125\nI, the maximum serum concentration (C\nmax\n) and exposure (AUC\n0-∞\n) of AbS were 12 μg eq/ml and 823 μg eq·hr/ml, respectively. Thus, after a single i.p. dose to MRL-Fas\nlpr \nmice, PK were approximately linear in the 2.5-10 mg/kg dose range (\nFIG. 52\n; Table 14) (see also Example 10.4). Urine counts of \n125\nI-AbS in MRL-Fas\nlpr \nmice were elevated as of the 10 day time point (\nFIG. 51\n \nb\n).\n\n\nDuring the first week following a single 2.5 mg/kg i.p. dose (likely prior to formation of anti-product antibodies), the highest concentrations of AbS were found in serum for all tissues examined. After the first week, serum concentration declined more rapidly as compared to the decline of AbS in tissue, so that T/S concentration ratios were significantly higher than 1 (Table 27), and AUC\n0-∞\n in tissues was ˜90-300 μg eq·hr/ml (Table 28). In tissue, the apparent elimination half-life (calculated based on the 24-312 hr data set) was ˜40-55 hr. Relatively low (but still detectable) levels of radioactivity persisted in tissues until the end of the study (seven weeks post-dose) (\nFIG. 51\n \na\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMean (±SD) Tissue to Serum (T/S) Radioactive Equivalent\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConcentration Ratio After a Single IP Dose of 2.5 mg/kg of \n125\nI-AbS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nto MRL-Fas\nlpr \nMice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n24 \nhr\n \n\n\n72 \nhr\n \n\n\n168 \nhr\n \n\n\n240 hr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfat\n\n\n0.321 ± 0.073\n\n\n0.233 ± 0.070\n\n\n41.125 ± 69.735\n\n\n 71.500 ± 131.496\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkidney\n\n\n0.195 ± 0.026\n\n\n0.202 ± 0.036\n\n\n9.831 ± 6.787\n\n\n56.205 ± 25.079\n\n\n\n\n\n\nliver\n\n\n0.104 ± 0.028\n\n\n0.091 ± 0.032\n\n\n8.067 ± 5.587\n\n\n16.820 ± 6.892 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nlungs\n\n\n0.177 ± 0.074\n\n\n0.159 ± 0.070\n\n\n7.621 ± 6.512\n\n\n20.127 ± 12.783\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlymph node\n\n\n0.197 ± 0.055\n\n\n0.141 ± 0.020\n\n\n5.490 ± 3.707\n\n\n22.497 ± 16.812\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskin\n\n\n0.318 ± 0.023\n\n\n0.305 ± 0.056\n\n\n12.237 ± 8.734 \n\n\n50.869 ± 59.413\n\n\n\n\n\n\nspleen\n\n\n0.166 ± 0.022\n\n\n0.105 ± 0.020\n\n\n9.648 ± 6.834\n\n\n50.418 ± 33.424\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndividual values below the limit of quantitation (LOQ, defined as 3X the background cpm) were treated as “0” for calculations of the mean and the standard deviation (SD).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT/S were not calculated for time points after 240 hr, as serum concentrations were below the limit of detection in most of the mice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExposure of \n125\nI-AbS in Tissue of MRL-Fas\nlpr \nMice Following a\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSingle 2.5 mg/kg IP Dose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAUC\n0-∞\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCmax\n\n\nTmax\n\n\nhr * μg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nμg eq/ml\n\n\nhr\n\n\neq/ml\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nfat\n\n\n2.9\n\n\n24\n\n\n255\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nkidney\n\n\n1.8\n\n\n24\n\n\n197\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nliver\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n24\n\n\n95\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nlymph node\n\n\n1.8\n\n\n24\n\n\n133\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nlung\n\n\n1.6\n\n\n24\n\n\n150\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nskin\n\n\n2.9\n\n\n24\n\n\n285\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nspleen\n\n\n1.5\n\n\n24\n\n\n161\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nserum\n \n\n\n12\n\n\n3\n\n\n823\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTissue sampling time points were: 24, 72, 168, 240, 312, 528, 864, and 1176 hr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 12\n\n\nInhibitory Properties of Anti-IL-21R Antibodies in Human Blood\n\n\nExample 12.1\n\n\nAgonistic Response of Human Whole Blood to IL-21 is Neutralized by Ex Vivo Treatment of Anti-IL-21R Antibody\n\n\nHuman whole blood was drawn by the Human Blood Donor Program in Cambridge, Mass. All human blood samples were collected in BD Vacutainer™ CPT™ cell preparation tubes. Collection tubes contained sodium heparin. Samples were maintained at ambient temperature and processed immediately. Blood was divided into 1 to 2 mL aliquots in cryovials, treated with IL-21, AbS, or control proteins. When samples were treated with both antibody and IL-21, the antibody was added immediately prior to IL-21. Samples were then incubated at 37° C. in a Form a Scientific Reach-In Incubator Model #3956 for four hr while mixed continuously at 15 RPM using the Appropriate Technical Resources Inc (ATR) Rotamix (Cat. # RKVS) rotating mixer (serial #0995-52 and #0695-36), or using the Labquake® Tube Shaker/Rotator (Cat. #400110) during the incubation. Aliquots (0.5 mL) were removed using a Gilson P1000 pipette with ART 1000E tips (Cat. #72830-042) and added to 2.0 mL microtubes (Axygen Scientific, Cat. #10011-744) containing 1.3 mL of RNAlater® supplied with the Human RiboPure™-Blood Kit (Ambion, Austin, Tex.; Cat. # AM1928) and mixed thoroughly by five complete inversions. Samples were stored at ambient temperature overnight and then frozen at −80° C. pending RNA purification.\n\n\nRNA was isolated using the Human RiboPure™-Blood Protocol (Ambion, Cat. # AM1928). The Human RiboPure™ RNA isolation procedure consists of cell lysis in a guanidinium-based solution and initial purification of the RNA by phenol/chloroform extraction, and final RNA purification by solid-phase extraction on a glass-fiber filter. The residual genomic DNA was removed according to the manufacturer's instructions for DNAse treatment using the DNA-Free™ reagents provided in the kit. For all samples, RNA quantity was determined by absorbance at 260 nm with a NanoDrop 1000 (NanoDrop, Wilmington, Del.). RNA quality was spot-checked using a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Palo Alto, Calif.). Samples were stored at −80° C. until cDNA synthesis was performed.\n\n\nAccording to the manufacturer's instructions, cDNA was reverse transcribed from total RNA using a High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (ABI, Cat. #4368814) with additional RNase inhibitor at 50 U/sample (ABI, Cat. # N808-0119). cDNA samples were stored at −20° C. until RT-PCR (real-time PCR) was performed. The amount of cDNA loaded on a Taqman® Low Density Array card was determined using the lowest RNA yield obtained within an experiment. cDNA samples were assayed on an ABI PRISM 7900 Sequence detector (Sequence Detector Software v2.2.2, Applied Biosystems) using universal thermal cycling conditions of 50° C. for 2 min, 95° C. for 10 min, then 40 cycles of 95° C. for 15 sec and 60° C. for 1 min.\n\n\nTo check for ex vivo effects of IL-21, experiments were conducted to test whether human whole blood responded to IL-21 with detectable changes in gene expression levels. Whole blood from human donors was incubated in the presence and absence of IL-21, and RNA levels were determined using TLDA cards. Two different TLDAs were used to measure RNA expression levels. The first, Human Immune TLDA (ABI, Catalog #4370573), tested 96 genes, of which 91 were detectable in stimulated human blood. PBMCs stimulated with LPS or PHA from human donor whole blood was used as a positive control. To test the upregulation of IL-21R in response to IL-21 stimulation, results were obtained using a custom designed TLDA that contained the IL-21R gene.\n\n\nData for the seven most consistent IL-21-dependent gene expression changes observed in whole blood samples of the four humans tested under the selected assay conditions are shown in Table 29. Significant responses to IL-21 were observed for IL6, IFNγ, CD19, PRF1, IL10, IL2Rα, and GNLY. Interestingly, IL-21 treatment at concentrations of 30 ng/mL, 100 ng/mL and 500 ng/mL produced similar results (Table 29).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIL-21-dependent gene expression changes in human whole blood\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsamples\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIL21\n\n\nIL21\n\n\nIL21\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(30 ng/mL)\n\n\n(100 ng/mL)\n\n\n(500 ng/mL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAverage Fold\n\n\nAverage Fold\n\n\nAverage Fold\n\n\nComposite\n\n\nComposite\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nChange\n\n\nChange\n\n\nChange\n\n\nAverage Fold\n\n\nStandard\n\n\nPaired T-test\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGene\n\n\n(2 Humans)\n\n\n(4 Humans)\n\n\n(2 Humans)\n\n\nChange\n\n\nDeviation\n\n\n(P-Value)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIL6\n\n\n20.17\n\n\n13.24\n\n\n32.14\n\n\n19.70\n\n\n22.51\n\n\n1.35E−01\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIFNG\n\n\n7.65\n\n\n6.51\n\n\n7.23\n\n\n6.97\n\n\n2.34\n\n\n5.86E−02\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCD19\n\n\n2.72\n\n\n2.78\n\n\n2.78\n\n\n2.76\n\n\n0.94\n\n\n6.09E−02\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPRF1\n\n\n2.43\n\n\n2.87\n\n\n2.72\n\n\n2.72\n\n\n1.08\n\n\n5.21E−02\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIL10\n\n\n3.17\n\n\n2.49\n\n\n2.66\n\n\n2.70\n\n\n1.26\n\n\n3.78E−02\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIL2RA\n\n\n2.82\n\n\n2.07\n\n\n2.15\n\n\n2.28\n\n\n0.86\n\n\n5.35E−02\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGNLY\n\n\n2.12\n\n\n2.07\n\n\n2.66\n\n\n2.23\n\n\n0.38\n\n\n1.76E−03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFold change was calculated by dividing RQ of treated group by RQ of control group.

All human whole blood samples were collected in BD Vacutainer™ CPT™ cell preparation tubes containing sodium heparin (Catalog #362753). Human whole blood was drawn by the Human Blood Donor Program in Cambridge, Mass. Samples were maintained at ambient temperature and, except where otherwise stated, were processed within an hour of collection. When samples were treated with immunoglobulin reagents and IL-21, the immunoglobulin reagent was added prior to addition of IL-21. Samples were incubated at 37° C. in a Form a Scientific Reach-In Incubator Model #3956 for the duration noted while mixed continuously at about 7 RPM using the Appropriate Technical Resources Inc (ATR) Rotamix (Catalog #RKVS) rotating mixer (serial #0995-52 and #0695-36), or using the Labquake® Tube Shaker/Rotator (Catalog #400110) during the incubation. Subsequently, 0.5 mL of each sample was removed and added to 2.0 mL microtubes (Axygen Scientific, Catalog #10011-744,) containing 1.3 mLs of RNAlater® which is provided with the Human RiboPure™-Blood Kit (Ambion, Catalog #AM1928), and mixed thoroughly by five complete inversions. Following procedure described in Example 12.1, samples were processed to isolate and quantify RNA yield, and synthesize cDNA; and 200 ng of cDNA was loaded onto a custom TLDA plate, comprising 24 genes (19 test genes whose RNA expression levels had been observed to change in whole human blood upon stimulation with IL-21, and 5 endogenous control genes), shown in \nFIG. 54\n.\n\n\nFor quantification of RNA expression levels, average Real-Time PCR threshold cycle (Ct) values from several endogenous controls (GAPDH, GUSB, ZNF592, and PGK1 in \nFIG. 54\n) were used as “normalizers” because the expression of these genes did not change with treatment and the genes yielded the most consistent Ct values across all samples. Average Ct values of experimental controls (no AbS and no IL-21 added) were used as “calibrators.” Expression of a gene in a given sample was calculated as Ct of gene−Ct of average of endogenous controls for that sample (ΔCt of sample). The gene expression value (ΔΔCt) was calculated as ΔCt of sample−ΔCt of “calibrator.” Relative quantification (RQ) or fold change was calculated as 2\n−ΔΔCt\n.\n\n\nIn order to determine optimal time and dose of IL-21 treatment for generation of maximal signal, whole blood samples from five healthy donors were incubated in the presence of 3.3, 10 or 30 ng/ml of IL-21 for 2, 4, 6 or 24 hr. RNA was isolated and gene expression levels measured. Significant and robust IL-21 dependent signals were obtained for six genes: IL6, IFNγ, IL2Rα, GZMB, PRF1, CD19. The optimal signal for all but CD19 was obtained at 2 hr (\nFIG. 55\n). There was little difference in the response obtained at 3.3, 10 or 30 ng/ml IL-21. Response to ex vivo IL-21 treatment was consistent between all five donors (data not shown). Based on the results obtained with these five donors, the assay conditions chosen to titrate the inhibitory effect of AbS on the ex vivo response to IL-21 were: two hr stimulation with 10 ng/ml of IL-21. The most reliable IL-21-responsive genes were GZMB, IFNγ, IL-21RA, IL-6, and PRF1.\n\n\nTo determine the dose of AbS to optimally block the effect of IL-21, samples from four individual donors were preincubated for 2 hr at the indicated concentrations of AbS and IgG\n1\nTM, both diluted in PBS, before the addition of 10 ng/ml of IL-21. Following the addition of IL-21, samples were incubated for an additional two hr.\n\n\nAddition of 0.1 μg/mL AbS resulted in full inhibition, so 0.003 μg/mL of AbS was used for subsequent experiments. AbS, but not IgG\n1\nTM, inhibited the response of all six genes tested in all four donors, as demonstrated in \nFIGS. 56\n \na\n-\nc\n.

This inhibition was reduced when the concentration of AbS was lowered to ≦0.003 μg/mL (20 pM). GZMB, IFNγ, IL-2Rα, IL-6, and PRF1 were reliable blood biomarkers of IL-21R/IL-21 and antibody activity at 2 hr; however all six genes (GZMB, IFNγ, IL-2Rα, IL-6, PRF1, and CD19) were identified as useful human blood biomarkers for IL-21R/IL-21 activity. Moreover, 10 ng/mL of IL-21 was shown to decrease gene expression of TBX-21 gene in the same assay, and this decrease was completely reversed by AbS at 0.03 μg/mL (data not shown).\n\n\nExample 13\n\n\nPK and PD of AbS and AbT in Male Cynomolgus Monkeys\n\n\nExample 13.1\n\n\nAnimal Selection for AbS and AbT Study\n\n\nAnimals used in the study were protein-naïve and selected for inclusion based on results obtained with recombinant human IL-21 stimulation in the whole blood ex vivo assay prior to dosing.\n\n\nSpecifically, for male monkeys, whole blood samples (0.5-1.5 mL) were placed in sterile, nuclease-free, 2 mL micro-centrifuge tubes (Axygen, cat. #1011-744) and treated with vehicle (10 mM L-histidine, 5% sucrose), 50 ng/mL recombinant human IL-21 (rhuIL-21), 50 ng/mL rhuIL-21 with 30 nM IgG control antibody, or 50 ng/mL rhuIL-21 with 30 nM anti-IL-21R antibody for 4 hrs at 37° C. on a platform shaker. For female monkeys, whole blood samples (0.5 mL) were treated with either vehicle or 20 ng/mL rhuIL-21. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells in the blood samples were isolated by Ficoll method according to manufacturer's instructions (GE Healthcare, Ficoll-Paque™ plus) and washed once in PBS.\n\n\nRNA isolation was performed using the RiboPure™-Blood Kit (Ambion, Cat#AM1928; males) or RNeasy kit (Qiagen, females) according to manufacturer's instructions. RNA yield was determined using a NanoDrop 1000A spectrophotometer (NanoDrop, Wilmington, Del.) and RNA quality was assessed using a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, Calif.). RNA concentration was adjusted to 28 ng/mL (males) or 20 ng/μL (females).\n\n\nFor male monkeys, synthesis of cDNA was performed using a High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif., cat. #4368814) according to manufacturer's instructions with 700 ng of RNA and gene expression analysis was performed using a Wyeth custom TLDA card (Applied Biosystems, part #4342249) designed for detection of cynomolgus monkey genes. Each cDNA synthesis reaction was mixed with \nTaqMan®\n 2×PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, cat. #430-4437), and 100 μL was loaded onto a TLDA card. TLDA cards were processed according to manufacturer instructions and amplification was performed using an ABI Prism 7900HT Sequence Detection System. Cycling parameters used for each run were as follows: 50° C. for 2 min, 95° C. for 10 min, and 40 cycles of 95° C. for 15 sec followed by 60° C. for 1 min. Cycle thresholds (CT) were calculated using Sequence Detection Software (version 2.3, Applied Biosystems).\n\n\nFor female monkeys, TaqMan quantitative RT-PCR for IL-2Rα only was performed using prequalified primers and probes to IL-2Rα (Applied Biosystems; the same IL-2Rα primers and probes as those in custom TLDA for male monkeys).\n\n\nFor both males and females, the relative quantification (RQ) of gene expression was then calculated using the delta delta Ct (ΔΔCt) method where RQ=2\n−ΔΔCt\n. Zinc finger protein 592 (ZNF592, males) or protein kinase G-1 (PKG1, females) was used as the endogenous control and the vehicle control sample was used as the calibrator for RQ calculations. Samples with RQ values greater or equal to 1.5 were considered to have gene expression higher than the corresponding vehicle control sample.\n\n\nMale monkeys whose blood showed higher expression of several immune function-related genes when stimulated ex vivo with IL-21 compared with vehicle (RQ≧1.5) were selected for inclusion in this study. The RQ values of five genes (IL-2Rα, IL-21R, PRF1, GZMB, and IL-6) for nine monkeys selected for further studies described below, represented by animal number (Animal #), are shown in Table 31. The group number (A-C) represents whether the animals selected were treated with AbS (Group A), AbT (Group B), or IgG control (Group C) in subsequent experiments. Animals 10-13 were not selected for further studies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 31\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelative Quantification (RQ) of Gene Expression Induced by Ex Vivo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddition of IL-21 to Whole Blood Obtained from Male\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCynomolgus Monkeys\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGroup;\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAnimal #\n\n\nIL-2Rα\n\n\nIL-21R\n\n\nPRF1\n\n\nGZMB\n\n\nIL-6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nA; 1\n\n\n2.8\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n2.8\n\n\n2.0\n\n\n4.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nA; 2\n\n\n3.4\n\n\n2.3\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n1.1\n\n\n1.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nA; 3\n\n\n5.5\n\n\n2.9\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n1.4\n\n\n3.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nB; 4\n\n\n4.1\n\n\n2.1\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n1.1\n\n\n4.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nB; 5\n\n\n5.3\n\n\n3.2\n\n\n2.1\n\n\n2.1\n\n\n4.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nB; 6\n\n\n2.8\n\n\n1.8\n\n\n1.8\n\n\n2.0\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nC; 7\n\n\n6.3\n\n\n1.9\n\n\n2.4\n\n\n1.9\n\n\n2.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nC; 8\n\n\n2.2\n\n\n1.8\n\n\n1.6\n\n\n1.6\n\n\n6.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nC; 9\n\n\n3.8\n\n\n2.0\n\n\n1.9\n\n\n2.2\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n10\n\n\n2.9\n\n\n1.8\n\n\n0.7\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n0.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n11\n\n\n7.7\n\n\n3.4\n\n\n2.6\n\n\n2.2\n\n\n2.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n12\n\n\n4.5\n\n\n3.6\n\n\n1.4\n\n\n1.5\n\n\n1.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n13\n\n\n2.1\n\n\n1.5\n\n\n1.1\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n1.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIL-2Rα was determined to have the largest magnitude (highest RQ) and most consistent change (highest percentage of animals that had RQ>1.5) in IL-21-induced gene expression of the genes evaluated, and was therefore considered the best single gene for assessing pharmacodynamic (PD) activity of the anti-IL-21R antibodies. Whole blood samples from all monkeys included in the in vivo study had IL-2Rα RQ values greater than 1.5 following ex vivo stimulation with IL-21. However, significant interanimal variability in IL-2Rα RQ values was observed, with values ranging from 2.8 to 6.3.\n\n\nTo obtain a larger number of samples for characterization of the distribution of the IL-2Rα response to rhuIL-21 in the ex vivo assay, blood samples were obtained from 24 additional female cynomolgus monkeys, stimulated ex vivo with rhuIL-21, and analyzed for IL-2Rα gene expression by using a quantitative RT-PCR method (IL-21R, PRF1, GZMB, and IL-6 expression was not analyzed for these monkeys). There were no noticeable differences in IL-2Rα RQ distribution between male and female monkeys (with the median±SD RQ values of 3.8±1.7 and 3.0±1.9, respectively) and subsequent analysis of IL-2Rα RQ distribution was performed using a combined data set with n=37. All cynomolgus monkeys tested had IL-2Rα RQ values greater or equal to 1.5 following ex vivo stimulation with rhuIL-21. The median IL-2Rα RQ value (n=37) was 3.2 and the range was 1.5-8.1.\n\n\nRQ values for IL-2Rα expression obtained at baseline from 37 monkeys were log-transformed and the distribution of the RQ and log {RQ} values was tested in the Shapiro-Wilk and D'Agostino & Pearson normality tests (\nGraphPad Prizm\n 5, GraphPad Software Inc). The normality hypothesis was rejected for the RQ distribution (p<0.05) but not for log {RQ} distribution (p=0.16 for the Shapiro-Wilk test; and p=0.48 for the D'Agostino & Pearson test). The log-transformed RQ values were fitted into normal distribution (R\n2\n=0.69) using \nGraphPad Prizm\n 5 software. The distribution of the IL-2Rα RQ values and log transformation (log 2) of the RQ values obtained in the ex vivo assay for all 37 monkeys (n=13 males; n=24 females) are shown in \nFIGS. 57\n \na \nand \n57\n \nb\n, respectively. The distribution of IL-2Rα RQ values appeared approximately log-normal and passed normality tests. The inclusion criterion for future pharmacodynamic (PD) studies with anti-IL-21R antibodies in cynomolgus monkeys was defined as 2.3, based on the formula: log {RQ\ncutpoint\n}=mean of the log-transformed RQ values−standard deviation of the log-transformed RQ values. Thus, animals with distribution of the IL-2Rα RQ values greater than 2.3 were considered to be good responders to IL-21 stimulation. Animals with RQ values of greater than 2.3 (˜81%; 30 of 37) were defined as good responders and were considered to satisfy the inclusion criterion for the PD study of anti-IL-21R antibodies.\n\n\nTo confirm that IL-21-induced gene expression was dependent on engagement of cynomolgus monkey IL-21R, monkey whole blood samples were incubated simultaneously with IL-21 and an anti-IL-21R antibody (AbT; 30 nM) prior to RNA isolation and gene expression analysis. As expected, ex vivo addition of AbT simultaneously with IL-21 strongly inhibited IL-21-induced gene expression changes in the whole blood assay (i.e., RQ value <1.5; \nFIG. 57\n \nc\n).\n\n\nExample 13.2\n\n\nStudy Design for In Vivo Experiments\n\n\nNine male protein-naive cynomolgus monkeys that were identified as responders to IL-21 stimulation in the ex vivo pharmacodynamic (PD) whole blood assay (described in Example 12.1), were dosed with 10 mg/kg of AbS (Group A), AbT (Group B), or IgG control antibody (Group C), with three animals per group. The dose was administered i.v. (infusion rate of ˜4 mL/min) into the saphenous vein with a dose volume of 2.5 mL/kg.\n\n\nBlood samples (˜7.0 mL) for the determination of PD activity (all three groups) were collected into tubes containing sodium citrate as the anticoagulant. Blood samples (˜3.0 mL) for the determination of serum AbS or AbT concentrations and for the evaluation of anti-product antibodies were collected into tubes without anticoagulant, allowed to clot at room temperature for approximately 15 min, and processed for serum collection by centrifugation. The sample collection schedule is shown in Table 32. After \nday\n 50, additional sampling time points were added for \n \nanimals\n \n 1 and 3 in the AbS group (Group A) to demonstrate reversibility of PD activity. \nDay\n 1, also referred to as “dose administration,” is the day on which antibodies were administered to the monkeys. “Pre-dose” refers to sample collection time prior to dose administration, and “post-dose” refers to sample collection time after dose administration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Vivo Study Design and Sample Collection in Male Cynomolgus\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonkeys\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup (Dose)\n\n\nTime\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimal #\n\n\n(days)\n\n\nSample collection\na\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA; AbS\n\n\n−13, 1 (pre-\nb \nand 5 min post-dose),\n\n\nAnimals 1-3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(10 mg/kg, IV)\n\n\n2, 8, 15, 22, 36, 50\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimals 1-3\n\n\n71, 92\nc\n \n\n\n \nAnimal\n 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n92, 106, 113, 134, 148\nc\n \n\n\nAnimal 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB; AbT\n\n\n−13, 1 (pre- and 5 min post-dose),\n\n\nAnimals 4-6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(10 mg/kg, IV)\n\n\n2, 8, 15, 22, 36\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimals 4-6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC; IgG control\n\n\n−13, 1 (pre- and 5 min post-dose),\n\n\nAnimals 7-9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(10 mg/kg, IV)\n\n\n2, 8, 15, 22, 36\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimals 7-9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \na\nFor Groups A and B, serum was collected to assay for test article concentrations and anti-product antibodies, and whole blood was collected for ex vivo PD assay.

PK studies in cynomolgus monkeys described in Example 10 indicated that following single i.v. administration, AbS was cleared markedly faster compared to AbT. In this study, extensive serum sampling required for determination of a complete set of PK parameters were not performed because of the relatively large sample volume required for the PD assay and limitations on blood volumes that could be collected from each individual cynomolgus monkey. Samples for determination of anti-IL-21R serum concentrations were taken only at those time points at which PD activity was assessed to enable correlation between the serum concentrations and PD activity for each individual animal. Thus, only elimination half-life (t\n1/2\n) was estimated based on the terminal phases of serum concentration-time profiles. The apparent t\n1/2 \nwas determined as described in Example 10.\n\n\nFollowing a single 10 mg/kg i.v. dose, AbS was eliminated slowly from male cynomolgus monkeys, with a mean apparent terminal half-life (t\n1/2\n) of ˜10.6±3.92 days (Table 33). Up until \nday\n 22, AbS serum concentrations were very similar between all three AbS-dosed animals (\nFIG. 58\n). However, at \nday\n 36 and later time points, AbS serum concentrations in \nanimal\n 2 declined rapidly (to ˜0.6 μg/mL) compared to those for \nanimals\n 1 and 3 (to ˜2 μg/mL). At \nday\n 50, \nanimal\n 2 had no detectable AbS in the serum (less than LOQ of 30 ng/mL), while \n \nanimals\n \n 1 and 3 had AbS serum concentrations of ˜0.9-1 μg/mL. Thus, the estimated t\n1/2 \nof AbS was shorter for animal 2 (˜6.2 days), compared to that for \nanimals\n 1 and 3 (˜12 and 14 days, respectively).\n\n\nAs expected based on the initial PK studies, after a single 10 mg/kg i.v. dose administration, the serum concentration of AbT declined markedly faster, compared to that of AbS (\nFIG. 58\n). All three AbS-dosed monkeys had similar concentration time-profiles and apparent t\n1/2 \nvalues (Table 33), with serum concentrations declining to relatively low levels at day 15 (<0.4 μg/mL) and to less than the LOQ at \nday\n 22. The estimated mean t\n1/2 \nof AbT was 2.3±0.16 days. AbS and AbT concentrations started to diverge as early as 24 hrs post-dose and differed by more than ten-fold at the one-week time point. These data confirmed observations from the earlier PK studies in which AbT had ˜5-7 fold faster total body clearance (CL), compared to AbS (see, e.g., Example 10).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 33\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeak and Last Detectable Concentrations and Elimination Half-Life\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter 10 mg/kg IV Administration of AbS and AbT to Male Cynomolgus\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonkeys\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nC\npeak\n \n\n\nt\n1/2\n \n\n\nC\nlast\n \n\n\nT\nlast\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGroup\n\n\nAnimal\n\n\n(μg/mL)\n\n\n(days)\n\n\n(μg/mL)\n\n\n(days)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nA (AbS)\n\n\n1\n\n\n200\n\n\n12\n\n\n0.91\n\n\n50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2\n\n\n139\n\n\n6.2\n\n\n0.56\n\n\n36\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n153\n\n\n14\n\n\n0.37\n\n\n71\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nMean\n \n\n\n164\n\n\n11\n\n\n0.61\n\n\n52\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSD\n\n\n32\n\n\n3.9\n\n\n0.27\n\n\n18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nB (AbT)\n\n\n4\n\n\n145\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n0.36\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5\n\n\n155\n\n\n2.3\n\n\n0.26\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6\n\n\n201\n\n\n2.1\n\n\n0.25\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMean\n\n\n167\n\n\n2.3\n\n\n0.29\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nSD\n \n\n\n30\n\n\n0.16\n\n\n0.06\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nC\npeak \nConcentration at 5 min (also referred to as C\n5min\n), the first sampling time point after i.v. administration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nt\n1/2 \nElimination half-life\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nT\nlast \nLast time point at which the test article concentration was above the lower limit of quantitation (LOQ = 30.0 ng/mL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nC\nlast \nConcentration at T\nlast\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 13.4\n\n\nAbS and AbT PD Response in Male Cynomolgus Monkeys\n\n\nEx vivo whole blood assay for detection of inhibition of IL-21-induced expression by anti-IL-21R antibodies was described in Example 12.1. For all nine monkeys enrolled into this study, each pre-dose and post-dose whole blood sample was divided into four 1.5 mL aliquots. First and second aliquots were treated with either recombinant human IL-21 or vehicle (a calibrator for RQ calculations), and were used to assess whether the circulating test article affected ex vivo IL-21-induced IL-2Rα gene expression (i.e., PD activity). The third aliquot was treated with IL-21 and an anti-IL-21R antibody (30 nM), and the fourth aliquot was treated with IL-21 and an IgG control antibody (negative control for the anti-IL-21R antibody). The third and fourth aliquots were used to assess whether inhibition of IL-21-induced IL-2Rα gene expression by the circulating test article in a given post-dose sample was complete (for time points at which PD activity was observed), whether the return of IL-21-induced gene expression was mediated through the IL-21R (for time points at which PD activity was later lost), and to monitor for the presence of neutralizing anti-product antibodies.\n\n\nFor AbS, full inhibition of IL-21-induced IL-2Rα gene expression (IL-2Rα RQ<1.5) was observed immediately after dose administration and persisted until at least \nday\n 22 for \nanimal\n 2 and at \nleast day\n 50 for \n \nanimals\n \n 1 and 3, when serum AbS concentrations were at or above 6 nM (0.9 μg/mL) for all three monkeys (\nFIGS. 59\n \na\n-\nc \nand Table 33). Ex vivo IL-21-induced IL-2Rα expression returned to pre-dose values (i.e., PD activity was lost) at \nday\n 92 for \n \nanimals\n \n 1 and 3, coincident with the time points at which serum concentrations were <LOQ (\nFIGS. 59\n \na \nand \nc\n). For \nanimal\n 2, PD activity was lost at \nday\n 36, when serum AbS concentration declined to a relatively low level of ˜4 nM (0.6 μg/mL). For all time points examined in this study, PD activity of AbS appeared all or none, such that there was typically either complete inhibition of IL-21-induced IL-2Rα gene expression (RQ<1.5), or a lack of inhibition (RQ similar to that in the corresponding pre-dose sample). A partial PD response was difficult to differentiate because of the intra-animal variability observed in IL-2Rα RQ values. It is possible that data points with partial PD responses for AbS would have been observed if additional sampling time points were collected at the terminal phase. The minimum concentration that was needed to maintain minimum PD activity of AbS (C\nmin\n) could not be precisely estimated, but is likely to be ˜4-6 nM.\n\n\nFor AbT, PD activity was also observed immediately after dose administration and persisted until at least day 8 (RQ<1.5), when serum AbT concentrations were at or above 1.3 μg/mL (\nFIGS. 60\n \na\n-\nc \nand Table 33). PD activity was lost (RQ>1.5) at \nday\n 15 for all three monkeys. In blood samples obtained at \nday\n 15 from \n \nanimals\n \n 5 and 6, IL-2Rα RQ values appeared similar to the corresponding pre-dose values (i.e., complete loss of PD activity) and serum AbT concentrations were less than 1.8 nM. There was a partial PD response in blood samples obtained at \nday\n 15 from \nanimal\n 4, as the observed IL-2Rα RQ value of 2.7 was less than that at pre-dose (RQ=4.8) and at the \nsubsequent day\n 22 time-point (RQ=5.3; \nFIG. 60\n \na\n). \nAnimal\n 4 also had a slightly longer estimated t\n1/2 \nand a somewhat higher AbT serum concentration at day 15 (˜2.5 nM), compared to \nanimals\n 5 and 6 (\nFIGS. 60\n \na\n-\nc\n). These data suggest that the C\nmin \nof AbT needed to maintain PD activity was approximately 2.5 nM.\n\n\nFor the isotype control group, ex vivo-added recombinant human IL-21 induced IL-2Rα gene expression in whole blood samples from all three monkeys at all time points, with noticeable intra-animal variability in the IL-2Rα RQ values (data not shown).\n\n\nIn agreement with the earlier PK studies (see Example 10), AbT had faster elimination in monkeys compared with AbS, with a mean apparent t\n1/2 \nof 10.6 and 2.3 days for AbS and AbT, respectively. At the \nday\n 15 time point, PD activity was completely or partially lost in all three AbT-dosed monkeys, while all three monkeys in the AbS dose group had relatively high serum AbS concentrations (˜6.0-7.4 μg/mL) and full PD activity. Thus, AbS had a longer duration of PD activity and a longer t\n1/2 \nin cynomolgus monkeys.\n\n\nExample 13.5\n\n\nAnti-Product Antibody Response\n\n\nAt the first time point where loss of PD activity was observed, ex vivo addition of an anti-IL-21R antibody simultaneous with rhuIL-21 inhibited the induction of IL-2Rα gene expression (RQ<1.5) in all AbS- and AbT-dosed monkeys, indicating that the return of rhuIL-21-induced gene expression was mediated through the IL-21R and that neutralizing anti-IL-21R antibodies were not present (\nFIGS. 59 and 60\n). Ex vivo addition of AbS continued to demonstrate inhibitory activity at subsequent time points collected from \n \nanimals\n \n 1 and 3. However, AbS had no ex vivo inhibitory activity at the \nday\n 50 time point from animal 2 (\nFIG. 59\n). Similarly, AbT had no ex vivo inhibitory activity at \ndays\n 22 and/or 36 collected from all animals in AbT-dosed groups (\nFIG. 60\n). These data suggested that \nanimal\n 2 in the AbS group, and all three animals (4-6) in the AbT group, had developed neutralizing anti-product antibodies.\n\n\nThe presence of neutralizing anti-AbT antibodies in AbT-dosed animals was confirmed using an orthogonal flow cytometric (FACS)-based assay. TF-1 and TF-1/rhuIL-21R (TF-1 cells transfected with rhuIL-21R) were grown in RPMI media containing 25 ng/ml huGMCSF (R&D Systems). Confluent cell cultures were centrifuged at 300 g for 10 min, resuspended in OptiMEM serum-free medium (Invitrogen Corporation) at 10\n6 \ncells/mL, and incubated at 37° C. for 2 hr. The cells were then washed in cold PBS/0.5% BSA, resuspended in ice-cold PBS buffer, and kept on ice until staining. To determine the EC\n50 \nfor AbS-biotin and AbT-biotin binding to TF-1/rhuIL-21R cells, both the parental TF-1 and the TF-1/rhuIL-21R cells (10\n5 \ncells per test) were incubated with either AbT-biotin, or IgG-biotin control using serial 3-fold dilutions (range=16-0.0002 μg/mL) on ice for 30 min, washed in PBS/0.5% BSA, and then incubated with streptavidin-allophycocyanin (APC; Invitrogen Corporation). Geometric mean fluorescent intensities (“GMFI”) of the APC channel peaks was collected on an LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using Flowjo 8.3.3 software (Treestar). Linear regression analysis of the plots was performed using \nPrism\n 4 for Macintosh v4.0b (GraphPad Software, Inc.).\n\n\nThe minimum required dilution (MRD) for testing serum samples in this assay was determined to be 1:6 in PBS/0.5% BSA. To test for inhibition of AbT-biotin to TF-1/rhuIL-21R cells (i.e. for the presence of neutralizing activity), TF-1/rhuIL-21R cells were preincubated with sera from anti-IL-21R-dosed monkeys (using a 3-fold dilution series starting at the MRD), stained with an anti-IL-21R-biotin (at the estimated EC\n50 \nconcentration), washed in PBS/0.5% BSA, stained with streptavidin-APC, and analyzed for GMFI as described above. Each serum sample was run in duplicate in two individual experiments, and the average GMFI value for the four replicates was obtained for each dilution point. The relative GMFI value for each serum sample for each dilution point was calculated using the formula [100%*average GMFI/average GMFI pre-dose]. A sample was considered positive if the relative GMFI value was less than or equal to 80% at the MRD. For positive samples, the log titer was calculated as the log [reciprocal dilution that would generate relative GMFI >80%]. Based on the MRD, log titers for negative samples were reported as <0.78 (log 6).\n\n\nAll three AbT-dosed animals tested positive in the FACS-based neutralizing antibody assay at \n \ndays\n \n 22 and 36, with log titers ranging from 2.2 to 4.1 (Table 34).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 34\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormation of Neutralizing anti-AbT Antibodies (log Titer) After\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10 mg/kg i.v.

In this assay, serum samples were coincubated with biotinylated-AbS and ruthenylated-AbS, streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads were added to the mixture, and the emitted light was detected using BioVeris technology. All three AbS-dosed monkeys were positive for anti-AbS antibodies in this assay, with log titers ranging from 1.86 to 3.43 (Table 35).

Bioanalytical assays and PK calculations were performed as described for AbS and AbT in Example 13.\n\n\nFor all compounds, there was significant interanimal variability in the terminal phase, likely related to different onset of formation of anti-product antibodies. Following a single 10 mg/kg i.v. dose to monkeys, AbV and AbS appeared to have similar mean serum concentrations and PK parameters. After a single i.v. dose to monkeys, AbV and AbS appeared to have the slowest mean CL, longest mean t\n1/2\n, and highest (dose-normalized) mean serum concentrations among all human anti-IL-21R antibodies tested. AbT had the fastest mean CL, shortest mean t\n1/2 \nand lowest (dose-normalized) mean serum concentrations among all human anti-IL-21R antibodies tested. Comparison of mean concentration profiles and PK parameters after a single i.v. dose to cynomolgus monkeys suggested that ranking of human anti-IL-21R Ab antibodies based on PK profiles was similar between the S-D rats and cynomolgus monkeys (see also Example 10.10).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 36\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPK Parameters After a Single i.v.

PD activity was lost with the washout of AbU-AbW from serum.\n\n\nExample 15\n\n\nPharmacokinetics of AbS After Intravenous Administration to Tetanus-Toxoid-Challenged Male and Female Cynomolgus Monkeys\n\n\nPK of AbS was examined after a single three weekly i.v. administration of 2 or 10 mg/kg of AbS to tetanus-toxoid-challenged cynomolgus monkeys. AbS serum concentrations and anti-AbS antibodies were monitored by specific ELISA, and PK parameters were calculated by noncompartmental analysis, as described, e.g., in Example 13.\n\n\nFollowing three weekly i.v. administrations of 2 or 10 mg/kg to monkeys, AbS concentration-time profiles and PK parameters were generally similar between the male and female monkeys in the same dose group (n=3 per sex per group). The mean concentration at 5 min after the 1\nst \ndose (C5 min) and the 3\nrd \ndose (C\nday14, 5min\n), as well as the mean exposure after the 3\nrd \ndose (AUC\nday14-day21\n) increased with the dose level. In the 2 mg/kg group, the mean C\n5 \nmin was 28.4±2.50 μg/mL, the mean C\nday14, 5min \nwas 35.7±11.0 μg/mL, and the mean AUC\nday14-day21 \nwas 1279±592 μg·hr/mL. In the 10 mg/kg group, the mean C\n5 \nmin was 120±59.9, the mean C\nday14, 5min \nwas 152±21.9 μg/mL, and the mean AUC\nday14-day21 \nwas 7700±782 μg·hr/mL. Elimination half-life (t\n1/2\n) after the third IV administration of AbS was 25.6±22.7 and 168±56.5 hr in the 2 and 10 mg/kg groups, respectively (p=0.0002) (\nFIG. 62\n).\n\n\nIn the 2 mg/kg group, AbS concentrations declined rapidly after the third i.v. administration, and all six monkeys tested positive for anti-AbS antibodies at day 28 (two weeks after the third dose) through the end of the study, in line with the relatively short t\n1/2 \n(\nFIG. 62\n \na\n). In the 10 mg/kg group, two of the six monkeys (\nSAN\n 7 and SAN 8) tested positive for anti-AbS antibodies (at \nday\n 42 or 49), and these monkeys had the shortest t\n1/2 \nvalues in the dose group, suggesting that formation of anti-AbS antibodies correlated with the t\n1/2 \nof AbS (\nFIG. 62\n \nb\n).\n\n\nExample 16\n\n\nPrediction of Pharmacokinetics of AbS and AbT in Humans after Single Administration\n\n\nTo predict the PK of AbS and AbT in humans, two approaches were used. For the first approach, it was assumed that the PK parameters (such as CL and volume of distribution) of an anti-IL-21R Ab in humans would be similar to those in cynomolgus monkeys. For the second approach, allometric scaling was used to estimate human PK parameters based on the animal data obtained from mice, rats, and cynomolgus monkeys following single i.v. administration of an anti-IL-21R antibody. Allometric scaling of CL was performed using adjustment for maximal life-span potential (MLP) for AbS and brain weight adjustments for AbT, according to the methods previously described in Mahmood (1996) \nEur. J. Drug Metab. Pharmacokinet. \n21:275-78; Mahmood and Balian (1996) \nXenobiotica \n26:887-95; Sacher, “Relation of lifespan to brain weight and body weight in mammals” in CIBA Foundation Symposium—The Lifespan of Animals (Colloquia on Aging), 115-33 (Wolstenholme G E W, O'Connor M, eds, 1959); and Hahn M E, Haber S B. (1978) \nBehav Genet., \n8:251-260. The allometric scaling data for AbS and AbT is demonstrated in \nFIGS. 63\n \na\n-\nb \nand \n64\n \na\n-\nb\n, respectively.\n\n\nCollectively, these two approaches suggested a low clearance (CL) and a small steady-state volume of distribution (Vd\nSS\n) of AbS in humans. The predicted CL of AbS would be ˜0.72-1.3 mL/hr/kg and the estimated Vd\nSS \nwould be ˜92.4-125 mL/kg. Following an i.v. dose of 1 mg/kg of AbS to a 60 kg human subject, the estimate of exposure (AUC\n0-∞\n) is 1393 μg·hr/mL, based on the CL value obtained by the allometric scaling method. For AbT, these two approaches suggested a higher CL of ˜5-8.5 mL/hr/kg and Vd\nss \nof ˜115-202 mL/hr/kg.\n\n\nExample 17\n\n\nTreatment with AbS Does Not Affect Disease in the NZBWF1/J Murine Lupus Nephritis Model\n\n\nThe anti-IL-21R antibody AbS was tested for its ability to reduce disease in a murine model of lupus, using NZBWF/1J mice. Female NZBWF1/J mice spontaneously develop symptoms resembling those observed in human lupus nephritis, including high titers of circulating IgG anti-nuclear and anti-double-stranded DNA autoantibodies, IgG deposits in the glomeruli, and proteinuria. The onset of kidney disease, as measured by the presence of protein in the urine, occurs at approximately 26 weeks of age in female NZBWF1/J mice. To examine the effects of IL-21R blockade with AbS, 26 week old female NZBWF1/J mice were administered either saline (vehicle control), CTLA-4Ig (murine IgG2a, positive control), anti-\nE. tenalla \nantibody (murine IgG2a isotype control), AbS, or a human antibody isotype control (human IgG1 antibody with triple mutation) at a dosage of 400 μg/\nmouse\n 3×/week over 10 weeks via i.p. injection. Serum samples were taken every two weeks and assayed for IgG anti-dsDNA antibodies by ELISA. Urine was collected and examined every two weeks for protein levels using Albustix (Bayer HealthCare, Tarrytown, N.Y.). All groups of animals had similar levels of proteinuria at the onset of the study, and the degree of proteinuria escalated in the saline, anti-\nE. tenella\n, and hIgG1TM control over the course of the study (\nFIG. 65\n \na\n). Treatment with CTLA-4Ig protein, which has previously been shown to ameliorate disease in this model, prevented the development of increased proteinuria in these mice. In contrast, treatment with AbS did not affect the development of proteinuria in NZBWF1/J mice when compared to control mice (\nFIG. 65\n \na\n). Similarly, treatment with CTLA-41 g significantly reduced anti-dsDNA IgG serum antibody titers in NZBWF1/J mice, where treatment with AbS did not affect the development of anti-dsDNA antibodies in these mice (\nFIG. 65\n \nb\n).\n\n\nExample 18\n\n\nEffects of Treatment with Anti-IL-21R Antibodies in a Semi-Therapeutic Collagen-Induced Arthritis (CIA) Mouse Model\n\n\nAntibodies AbS and AbT were tested for their ability to reduce disease in a murine collagen-induced arthritis model of rheumatoid arthritis. Female DBA/1 mice were immunized intradermally in the tail with 100 mg bovine collagen type II emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant, and then boosted with 100 mg bovine collagen type II emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant 21 days later at the same site. After the second immunization with bovine collagen type II, paws were examined for swelling and scored for severity on a scale of 0-16, with 0 representing no swelling and 16 indicating severe disease. Once 10% of animals in the study showed signs of disease, animals were either left untreated, or dosed 3×/week for 30 days with 8 mg/kg either murine IgG2a isotype control antibody, anti-mouse IL-21R antibody D5 (murine IgG2a antibody), mTNFRII-Fc (positive control, murine IgG2a isotype), anti-IL-13TM antibody (human IgG1 isotype control antibody), AbT, or AbS. Overall disease severity in this study was not observed to be as severe as normally observed in this model. Mean disease severity in the untreated and isotype control treated mice on the final day of the study was less than 4, on a scale of 0-16 (\nFIG. 66\n \nc\n). Additionally, although treatment with the mTNFRII-Fc positive control reduced disease in this study, statistically significant differences in disease severity were only observed between this treatment group and isotype control treated group disease on \nday\n 22 after dosing. Treatment with anti-mouse IL-21R antibody (D5) or anti-human IL-21R antibodies (AbS and AbT) also did not affect disease severity in this study (\nFIGS. 66\n \na\n-\nb\n).\n\n\nExample 19\n\n\nTesting Antibody Effects on the Formation of Amnestic Antibody Response to Tetanus Immunization in Cynomolgus Monkeys\n\n\nThe anti-IL-21R antibody AbS was examined for its effects on the development of amnestic antibody responses to tetanus immunization in cynomolgus monkeys. Nine female and nine male cynomolgus monkeys were tested for serum antibody titers to tetanus toxoid to identify tetanus-naïve animals. These animals were then administered 0.5 ml of tetanus toxoid in two equally divided (0.25 ml) doses intramuscularly, and blood was collected every 7 days for 35 days and examined for anti-tetanus IgM and IgG serum antibodies by ELISA. Forty-three days after primary immunization, groups of 3 male and 3 female cynomolgus monkeys were randomly assigned and administered either saline (vehicle), 2 mg/kg AbS, or mg/kg AbS as an i.v slow bolus into the brachial/cephalic or saphenous vein at a dose volume of 1 ml/kg (flushed with 2 ml vehicle) 1×/week for 3 weeks. Twenty-four hr after administering the first dose of AbS or vehicle, monkeys were immunized a second time with 0.5 ml of tetanus toxoid in two equally divided (0.25 ml) doses intramuscularly, and blood was collected routinely and examined for anti-tetanus IgM and IgG antibody titers by ELISA. IgM and IgG tetanus serum antibodies were detectable in both male and female cynomolgus monkeys within 14 days after the first immunization with tetanus toxoid (\nFIG. 67\n \na\n). Tetanus specific serum IgM titers did not change following secondary immunization with tetanus toxoid in any of the treatment groups. Tetanus-specific IgG serum titers were approximately 10-20 fold greater, and generated more rapidly in saline treated animals following secondary immunization, consistent with the kinetics of amnestic antibody responses (\nFIG. 67\n \nb\n). Treatment with 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg AbS did not affect the development of tetanus-specific IgG serum antibody responses in cymolgus monkeys following secondary immunization, indicating that treatment with AbS does not affect the formation of amnestic antibody responses to tetanus toxoid using this treatment protocol (\nFIG. 67\n \nb\n).\n\n\nEQUIVALENTS\n\n\nThose skilled in the art will recognize, or be able to ascertain using no more than routine experimentation, many equivalents of the specific embodiments of the invention described herein. Such equivalents are intended to be encompassed by the following claims."
