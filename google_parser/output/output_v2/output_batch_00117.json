The present invention provides a crystallized form of Estrogen Related Receptor alpha (ERR-α) in complex with a ligand that forms a thioether bond in the ligand binding pocket (LBP), methods to measure dissociation rates for ligands that form reversible covalent bonds, and methods to design ligands that form reversible covalent bonds for use as modulators of ERR-α activity.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nVarious publications, which may include patents, published applications, technical articles and scholarly articles, are cited throughout the specification in parentheses, and full citations of each may be found at the end of the specification. Each of these cited publications is incorporated by reference herein, in its entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNuclear receptors are members of a superfamily of transcription factors. The members of this family share structural similarities and regulate a diverse set of biological effects (Olefsky 2001). Ligands activate or repress these transcription factors that control genes involved in metabolism, differentiation and reproduction (Laudet and Gronmeyer 2002). Presently, the human genome project has identified about 48 members for this family and cognate ligands have been identified for about 28 of them (Giguere 1999). This protein family is composed of modular structural domains that can be interchanged within the members of the family without loss of function. A typical nuclear receptor contains a hypervariable N-terminus, a conserved DNA binding domain (DBD), a hinge region, and a conserved ligand binding domain (LBD). The function of the DBD is targeting of the receptor to specific DNA sequences (nuclear hormone response elements or NREs). The function of the LBD is recognition of its cognate ligand. Within the sequence of the nuclear receptor there are regions involved in transcriptional activation. The AF-1 domain is situated at the N-terminus and constitutively activates transcription (Rochette-Egly, Gaub et al. 1992; Rochette-Egly, Adam et al. 1997), while the AF-2 domain is embedded within the LBD and its transcriptional activation is ligand dependent (Wurtz, Bourguet et al. 1996). Nuclear receptors can exist as monomers, homodimers or heterodimers and bind to direct or inverted nucleotide repeats (Aranda and Pascual 2001; Laudet and Gronmeyer 2002).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe members of this family exist either in an activated or repressed basal biological state. The basic mechanism of gene activation involves ligand dependent exchange of co-regulatory proteins. These co-regulatory proteins are referred to as co-activators or co-repressors (McKenna, Lanz et al. 1999). A nuclear receptor in the repressed state is bound to its DNA response element and is associated with co-repressor proteins that recruit histone de-acetylases (HDACs) (Jones and Shi 2003). In the presence of an agonist there is an exchange of co-repressors with co-activators that in turn recruit transcription factors that assemble into an ATP dependent chromatin-remodeling complex. Histones are hyper-acetylated, causing the nucleosome to unfold, and repression is alleviated. The AF-2 domain acts as the ligand dependent molecular switch for the exchange of co-regulatory proteins. In the presence of an agonist the AF-2 domain undergoes a conformational transition and presents a surface on the LBD for interaction with co-activator proteins. In the absence of an agonist or in the presence of an antagonist the AF-2 domain presents a surface that promotes interactions with co-repressor proteins. The interaction surfaces on the LBD for both co-activators, and co-repressors overlap and provide a conserved molecular mechanism for gene activation or repression that is shared by the members of this family of transcription factors (Xu, Stanley et al. 2002).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNatural ligands that modulate the biological activity of nuclear receptors have been identified for only approximately one half of known nuclear receptors. Receptors for which no natural ligand has been identified are termed “orphan receptors”. The discovery of ligands or compounds that interact with an orphan receptor will accelerate the understanding of the role of the nuclear receptors in physiology and disease and facilitate the pursuit of new therapeutic approaches. A sub-class of these receptors, for which no natural ligands have been identified, is the estrogen related receptors (ERRs).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEstrogen Related Receptor alpha (ERR-α), also known as ERR-1, is an orphan receptor and was the first to be identified of the three members of the estrogen receptor related subfamily of orphan nuclear receptors (ERR-α, β, γ). The ERR subfamily is closely related to the estrogen receptors (ER-α and ER-β). ERR-α and ERR-β were first isolated by a low stringency hybridization screen (Giguere, Yang et al. 1988) followed later with the discovery of ERR-γ (Hong, Yang et al. 1999). The ERRs and ERs share sequence similarity with the highest homology observed in their DBDs, approximately 60%, and all interact with the classical DNA estrogen response element. Recent biochemical evidence suggested that the ERRs and ERs share co-regulator proteins and also target genes, including pS2, lactoferin, aromatase, and osteopontin (Hong, Yang et al. 1999; Zhang and Teng 2000; Giguere 2002; Kraus, Ariazi et al. 2002). It has been suggested that one of the main functions of ERRs is to regulate the response of estrogen responsive genes. The effects of the steroid hormone estrogen are primarily mediated in the breast, bone and endometrium, so it is reasonable to believe that compounds that interact with ERRs may find use for the treatment of bone related disease, breast cancer, and other diseases related to the reproduction system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, it has been shown that ERR-α is present in both normal and cancerous breast tissue (Ariazi, Clark et al. 2002). It has also been reported that the main function of ERR-α in normal breast tissue is that of a repressor for estrogen responsive genes. In breast cancers or cell lines that are non-estrogen responsive (ER-α negative), ERR-α has been reported to be in an activated state (Ariazi, Clark et al. 2002). Therefore compounds that interact with ERR-α may be useful agents for the treatment of breast cancer that is ER-α negative and non-responsive to classical anti-estrogenic therapy, or may be used as an adjunct agent for anti-estrogen responsive breast cancers. These agents may act as antagonists by reducing the biological activity of ERR-α in these particular tissues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRegarding bone related diseases, many post-menopausal women experience osteoporosis, a condition that has been clearly associated with a reduction of estrogen production. For example, it has been shown that reduction of estrogen levels results in increased bone loss (Turner, Riggs et al. 1994). It has also been shown that administration of estrogens to postmenopausal patients with osteoporosis has an anabolic effect on bone development (Pacifici 1996). The molecular mechanism linking estrogen receptors to bone loss is not well understood, however, since ER-α and ER-β knock-out animals have only minor skeletal defects (Korach 1994; Windahl, Vidal et al. 1999). With regard to ERR-α in bone, ERR-α expression has been shown to be regulated by estrogen (Bonnelye, Vanacker et al. 1997; Bonnelye, Merdad et al. 2001) and ERR-α expression is known to be maintained throughout stages of osteoblast differentiation. Furthermore, over-expression of ERR-α in rat calvaria osteoblasts, an accepted model of bone differentiation, resulted in an increase of bone nodule formation and treatment of rat calvaria osteoblasts with ERR-α antisense results in a decrease of bone nodule formation. ERR-α also regulates osteopontin, a protein believed to be involved in bone matrix formation. Therefore, compounds that modulate ERR-α by increasing its activity may have an anabolic effect for the regeneration of bone density and provide a benefit over current approaches that prevent bone loss. Such compounds may enhance the activity of the receptor by enhancing the association of the receptor with proteins that increase its activity or improve the stability of the receptor or by increasing the intracellular concentrations of the receptor and consequently increasing its activity. Conversely, with respect to bone diseases that are a result of abnormal bone growth, compounds that interact with ERR-α and decrease its biological activity may provide a benefit for the treatment of these diseases by retarding bone growth. Antagonism of the association of the receptor with co-activator proteins decreases the activity of the receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nERR-α is also present in cardiac, adipose, and muscle tissue and forms a transcriptionally active complex with the PGC-1 co-activator family, which are co-activators implicated in energy homeostasis, mitochondria biogenesis, hepatic gluconeogenesis and in the regulation of genes involved in fatty acid beta-oxidation (Kamei, Ohizumi et al. 2003). ERR-α regulates the expression of medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) through interactions with its promoter. MCAD is a gene involved in the initial reaction in fatty acid beta-oxidation. It is believed that in the adipose tissue, ERR-α regulates energy expenditure through the regulation of MCAD (Sladek, Bader et al. 1997; Vega and Kelly 1997). In antisense experiments in rat calvaria osteoblasts, in addition to the inhibition of bone nodule formation, there was an increase in adipocyte differentiation markers including aP2 and PPAR-γ (Bonnelye, Kung et al. 2002). An ERR-α knockout model has been described that exhibited reduced fat mass relative to the wild type. DNA chip analysis indicated that the ERR-α knockout mice have an alteration in the expression levels of genes involved in adipogenesis and energy metabolism (Luo, Sladek et al. 2003). More recently it has been shown that ERR-α regulates the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, a gene that has a protective mechanism against arteriosclerosis (Sumi and Ignarro 2003). The biochemical evidence supports the involvement of ERR-α in metabolic homeostasis and differentiation of cells into adipocytes. Therefore, compounds interacting with ERR-α may affect energy homeostasis and provide a benefit for the treatment of obesity and metabolic syndrome related disease indications, including arteriosclerosis and diabetes (Grundy, Brewer et al. 2004).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLion Bioscience AG disclosed the use of certain pyrazole derivatives as antagonists of ERR-α for treating cancer, osteoporosis, obesity, lipid disorders and cardiovascular disorders and for regulating fertility (US20060148876). Still other small molecules were also disclosed as ERR-α modulators (US20060014812; US20080221179).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere is a continuing need for new ERR-α inverse agonists that may find use in the treatment of conditions including but not limited to bone-related disease, bone formation, breast cancer (including those unresponsive to anti-estrogen therapy), cartilage formation, cartilage injury, cartilage loss, cartilage degeneration, cartilage injury, ankylosing spondylitis, chronic back injury, gout, osteoporosis, osteolytic bone metastasis, multiple myeloma, chondrosarcoma, chondrodysplasia, osteogenesis imperfecta, osteomalacia, Paget's disease, polymyalgia rheumatica, pseudogout, arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, infectious arthritis, osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis, childhood arthritis, Reiter's syndrome, repetitive stress injury, periodontal disease, chronic inflammatory airway disease, chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, metabolic syndrome, obesity, disorders of energy homeostasis, diabetes, lipid disorders, cardiovascular disorders, artherosclerosis, hyperglycemia, elevated blood glucose level, and insulin resistance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nX-ray crystal structures provide powerful tools for the rational design of ligands that can function as active agents for biologically important targets. The first crystal structure solved for ERR-α was a complex of the ERR-α ligand binding domain and a coactivator peptide from peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator-1 (PGC-1) (Kallen, Schlaeppi et al. 2004). The structure revealed that the putative ligand binding pocket (LBP) of ERR-α is almost completely occupied by side chains, in particular with the bulky side chain of Phe328. The crystal structure of ERR-α in a transcriptionally active conformation, in the absence of a ligand, provided evidence for ligand-independent transcriptional activation by ERR-α. A second ERR-α crystal structure was solved with the ligand binding domain of ERR-α (containing a C325S mutation) in complex with an inverse agonist bound in the ligand binding pocket (LBP). The C325S mutation was introduced to reduce biochemical instability problems during purification and crystallization that were determined to be associated with cysteine oxidation. (Kallen, Lattmann et al. 2007). The structure revealed a dramatic conformational change in the ERR-α LBP which created the necessary space for the ligand to bind. Due to the C325S mutation in the LBP, however, the structure left unresolved the importance of the Cys325 in designing ligands for use as modulators of ERR-α activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt has been shown that certain ligands form a covalent bond to a cysteine residue in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) ligand binding domain through a Michael addition, and that covalent binding is required for PPAR activation by the ligands (Shiraki, Kamiya et al. 2005). Covalent binding has also been demonstrated in a number of different drugs for a variety of drug targets. A few examples are briefly included below. It was proposed that targeted covalent inactivation of a variety of protein kinases may hold promise for developing treatments for a number of different diseases (US20060079494; Fry, Bridges et al. 1998; Schirmer, Kennedy et al. 2006; Wood, Shewchuk et al. 2008). Covalent binding was also demonstrated for potent and species-specific inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA synthases ((Pojer, Ferrer et al. 2006). It was shown that F-amidine and Cl-amidine irreversibly inactivate protein arginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) in a calcium-dependent manner via the specific modification of Cys645, an active site residue that is critical for catalysis. A growing body of evidence supports a role for PAD4 in the onset and progression of rheumatoid arthritis, a chronic autoimmune disorder. It was concluded that the covalent binding compounds may be useful as potential lead compounds for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (Luo, Arita et al. 2006). Even the unique properties of aspirin, the ubiquitous nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, derive from its ability to covalently modify cyclooxygenases, COX-1 and COX-2, the in vivo targets for its action (Kalgutkar, Crews et al. 1998).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides a crystallized form of a complex of the ERR-α ligand binding domain (ERR-α-LBD) with a ligand that forms a thioether bond to Cys325 of ERR-α. The diffraction pattern of the crystal is of sufficient resolution so that the three-dimensional structure of ERR-α can be determined at atomic resolution, ligand-binding sites on ERR-α can be identified, and the interactions of ligands with specific amino acid residues of ERR-α can be modeled and used to design ligands that can function as active agents. The assay methods of the present invention can be used to measure dissociation rates for ligands that form reversible covalent bonds and can function as active agents. Thus, the three-dimensional structure of the complex of the ERR-α ligand binding domain (ERR-α-LBD) with a ligand that forms a thioether bond to Cys325 and the assay methods of the present invention have applications to the design and biological characterization of ligands that function as modulators of ERR-α activity.

Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice of the present invention, the preferred methods and materials are described.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “comprising” means “including principally, but not necessarily solely”. Furthermore, variations of the word “comprising”, such as “comprise” and “comprises”, have correspondingly varied meanings.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the terms “containing”, “having” and “including” are used in their open, non-limiting sense.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “sequence” means the linear order in which monomers occur in a polymer, for example, the order of amino acids in a polypeptide or the order of nucleotides in a polynucleotide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “polypeptide”, “protein”, and “peptide” are used herein interchangeably to refer to amino acid chains in which the amino acid residues are linked by peptide bonds or modified peptide bonds. The amino acid chains can be of any length of greater than two amino acids. Unless otherwise specified, the terms “polypeptide”, “protein”, and “peptide” also encompass various modified forms thereof. Such modified forms may be naturally occurring modified forms or chemically modified forms. Examples of modified forms include, but are not limited to, glycosylated forms, phosphorylated forms, myristoylated forms, palmitoylated forms, ribosylated forms, acetylated forms, ubiquitinated forms, etc. Modifications also include intra-molecular crosslinking and covalent attachment to various moieties such as lipids, flavin, biotin, polyethylene glycol or derivatives thereof, etc. In addition, modifications may also include cyclization, branching and cross-linking. Further, amino acids other than the conventional twenty amino acids encoded by the codons of genes may also be included in a polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, a protein or nucleic acid molecule is said to be “isolated” when the protein or nucleic acid molecule is substantially separated from contaminants from the source of the protein or nucleic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “native protein” refers to a protein comprising an amino acid sequence identical to that of a protein isolated from its natural source or organism.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “amino acids” refers to the L-isomers of the naturally occurring amino acids.

For many methods, oligonucleotides of about 16-25 nucleotides in length are useful, although longer oligonucleotides of greater than about 25 nucleotides may sometimes be utilized. Some oligonucleotides can be used as “primers” for the synthesis of complimentary nucleic acid strands. For example, DNA primers can hybridize to a complimentary nucleic acid sequence to prime the synthesis of a complimentary DNA strand in reactions using DNA polymerases. Oligonucleotides are also useful for hybridization in several methods of nucleic acid detection, for example, in Northern blotting or in situ hybridization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Recombinant” refers to a nucleic acid, a protein encoded by a nucleic acid, a cell, or a viral particle, that has been modified using molecular biology techniques to something other than its natural state. For example, recombinant cells can contain nucleotide sequence that is not found within the native (non-recombinant) form of the cell or can express native genes that are otherwise abnormally, under-expressed, or not expressed at all. Recombinant cells can also contain genes found in the native form of the cell wherein the genes are modified and re-introduced into the cell by artificial means. The term also encompasses cells that contain an endogenous nucleic acid that has been modified without removing the nucleic acid from the cell; such modifications include those obtained, for example, by gene replacement, and site-specific mutation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “high stringency” as used herein refers to the conditions under which two nucleic acids may be hybridized, and may include, for example, the concentration of salts and/or detergents in a solution, the temperature of a solution that is used during the hybridization of the two nucleic acids and time period of the hybridization.

Some vectors can be introduced into a host cell allowing for replication of the vector or for expression of a protein that is encoded by the vector or construct. Vectors typically have selectable markers, for example, genes that encode proteins allowing for drug resistance, origins of replication sequences, and multiple cloning sites that allow for insertion of a heterologous sequence. Vectors are typically plasmid-based and are designated by a lower case “p” followed by a combination of letters and/or numbers. Starting plasmids disclosed herein are either commercially available, publicly available on an unrestricted basis, or can be constructed from available plasmids by application of procedures known in the art. Many plasmids and other cloning and expression vectors that can be used in accordance with the present invention are well-known and readily available to those of skill in the art. Moreover, those of skill readily may construct any number of other plasmids suitable for use in the invention.

Another desired feature of high-throughput assays is an assay design that is optimized to reduce reagent usage, or minimize the number of manipulations in order to achieve the analysis desired. Examples of high-throughput assay formats include, but are not limited to, formats that utilize 96-well, 384-well, and 1536-well plates, or “lab on a chip” microchannel chips used for liquid handling experiments. It is well known by those in the art that as miniaturization of plastic molds and liquid handling devices are advanced, or as improved assay devices are designed, greater numbers of samples can be processed using the forms of the present invention. Any high-throughput screening may be utilized to test new compounds, which are identified or designed for their ability to interact with ERR-α.

In another embodiment, the ligand identified in the method described above is selected from a database. In a preferred embodiment, the ligand identified in the method described above is designed de novo. In another preferred embodiment, the ligand identified in the method described above is designed from a known inverse agonist or other type of modulator.\n\n\n \nEngineered Forms and Fragments\n\n\n \n \n \nEngineered forms of ERR-α or fragments thereof, for instance engineered forms or fragments comprising active sites defined by two or more amino acids may be prepared by any available means including synthetic or recombinant means. Such fragments may then be used in the assays as described herein, for example, but not limited to, high-throughput assays to detect interactions between prospective ligands and the active site within the fragment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor recombinant expression or production of the forms or fragments of the invention, nucleic acid molecules encoding the form or fragment may be prepared. Nucleic acid molecules encoding engineered forms or fragments of the invention may differ in sequence because of the degeneracy in the genetic code or may differ in sequence as they encode proteins or protein fragments that differ in amino acid sequence. Homology or sequence identity between two or more such nucleic acid molecules is determined by BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) analysis using the algorithm employed by the programs blastp, blastn, blastx, tblastn and tblastx (Karlin and Altschul 1990) and (Altschul 1993), fully incorporated by reference, which are tailored for sequence similarity searching.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe approach used by the BLAST program is to first consider similar segments between a query sequence and a database sequence, then to evaluate the statistical significance of all matches that are identified and finally to summarize only those matches which satisfy a preselected threshold of significance. For a discussion of basic issues in similarity searching of sequence databases, see (Altschul, Boguski et al. 1994) which is fully incorporated by reference. The search parameters for histogram, descriptions, alignments, expect (i.e., the statistical significance threshold for reporting matches against database sequences), cutoff, matrix and filter are at the default settings. For a discussion of default scoring matrix used by blastp, blastx, tblastn, and tblastx, see (Henikoff 1992).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe encoding nucleic acid molecules of the present invention or fragments thereof (i.e., synthetic oligonucleotides) and those that are used as probes or specific primers for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or to synthesize gene sequences encoding proteins of the invention can easily be synthesized by chemical techniques, for example, the phosphotriester method of (Matteucci and Caruthers 1981) or using automated synthesis methods. In addition, larger DNA segments can readily be prepared by well-known methods, such as synthesis of a group of oligonucleotides that define various modular segments of the gene, followed by ligation of oligonucleotides to build the complete modified gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe encoding nucleic acid molecules of the present invention may further be modified so as to contain a detectable label for diagnostic and probe purposes. A variety of such labels are known in the art and can readily be employed with the encoding molecules herein described. Suitable labels include, but are not limited to, biotin, radiolabeled nucleotides and the like. A skilled artisan can employ any of the art-known labels to obtain a labeled encoding nucleic acid molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention further provides recombinant DNA molecules (rDNA) that contain a coding sequence for a protein or protein fragment as described herein. As used herein, an rDNA molecule is a DNA molecule that has been subjected to molecular manipulation. Methods for generating rDNA molecules are well known in the art, for example, see (Sambrook, Fritsch et al. 1989). In the preferred rDNA molecules, a coding DNA sequence is operably linked to expression control sequences and/or vector sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe choice of vector and expression control sequences to which one of the protein encoding sequences of the present invention is operably linked depends directly, as is well known in the art, on the functional properties desired (e.g., protein expression, and the host cell to be transformed). A vector of the present invention may be capable of directing the replication or insertion into the host chromosome, and preferably also expression, of the structural gene included in the rDNA molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExpression control elements that are used for regulating the expression of an operably linked protein encoding sequence are known in the art and include, but are not limited to, inducible promoters, constitutive promoters, secretion signals, and other regulatory elements. Preferably, the inducible promoter is readily controlled, such as being responsive to a nutrient in the host cell's medium.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention further provides host cells transformed with a nucleic acid molecule that encodes a protein or protein fragment of the present invention. The host cell can be either prokaryotic or eukaryotic. Eukaryotic cells useful for expression of a protein of the invention are not limited, so long as the cell line is compatible with cell culture methods and compatible with the propagation of the expression vector and expression of the gene product. Preferred eukaryotic host cells include, but are not limited to, insect, yeast, and mammalian cells. Preferred eukaryotic host cells include \nSpodoptera frugiperda \n(Sf9 or Sf21) insect cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTransformed host cells of the invention may be cultured under conditions that allow the production of the recombinant protein. Optionally the recombinant protein is isolated from the medium or from the cells; recovery and purification of the protein may not be necessary in some instances where some impurities may be tolerated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nKits may also be prepared with any of the above described nucleic acid molecules, proteins, protein fragments, vector and/or host cells optionally packaged with the reagents needed for a specific assay, such as those described above. In such kits, the protein, protein fragments, or other reagents may be attached to a solid support, such as glass or plastic beads.\n\n\n \nHigh-Throughput Assays\n\n\n \n \n \nCompound identification methods can be performed using conventional laboratory assay formats or in high-throughput assays, including, but not limited to, those described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmunoassays are a group of techniques used for the measurement of specific biochemical substances, commonly at low concentrations in complex mixtures such as biological fluids. The assays depend upon suitably prepared and selected antibodies with specificity and high affinity for their complementary antigens. A substance to be measured must, of necessity, be antigenic, either an immunogenic macromolecule or a haptenic small molecule. To each sample a known limited amount of specific antibody is added and the fraction of the antigen combining with it, often expressed as the bound:free ratio, is estimated by quantifying the signal from the antibody. Quantification can be achieved with a number of readily identifiable labels and used for various types of assays, including, but not limited to, radioisotopes for radioimmunoassays (RIA), fluorescent molecules for fluoroimmunoassays (FIA), stable free radicals for spin immunoassays, chemiluminescent molecules for chemiluminescent immunoassays (CLIA), colloidal gold particles for immunogold assays, and enzymes for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA common immunoassay format is the ELISA, which avoids the hazards of radiochemicals and the expense of fluorescence detection systems. Instead, an ELISA is a form of quantitative immunoassay based on the use of antibodies (or antigens) that may be linked to an insoluble carrier surface, which is then used to “capture” the relevant antigen (or antibody) the test solution. The antigen-antibody complex is then detected by measuring the activity of an appropriate enzyme that can be covalently attached to the capture antigen (or antibody) or to a subsequent “detection” antibody (or antigen). For more information on ELISA techniques, see, for example, (Crowther 1995); (Kemeny (editor) and Challacombe (editor) 1988), (Kemeny 1991), and (Ishikawa 1999).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nColorimetric assays for enzymes are methods of quantitative chemical analysis in which the concentration or amount of a compound is determined by comparing the color produced by the reaction of a reagent with both standard and test amounts of the compound, often using a colorimeter. A colorimeter is a device for measuring color intensity or differences in color intensity, either visually or photoelectrically. Standard colorimetric assays of beta-galactosidase enzymatic activity are well known to those skilled in the art, see for example, (Norton and Coffin 1985). A colorimetric assay can be performed on whole cell lysates using O-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galacto-pyranoside (ONPG, Sigma) as the substrate in a standard colorimetric beta-galactosidase assay (Sambrook, Fritsch et al. 1989). Automated colorimetric assays are also available for the detection of beta-galactosidase activity, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,733,720.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnzymatic substrates that become fluorescent after being acted upon by an enzyme generally are well known. Such fluorescent substrates typically have two components that are bound to one another through, for example, a covalent chemical bond. One component is a fluorescent molecule that is capable of fluorescing by first accepting light energy and then emitting light energy. The other component is an entity that prevents the fluorescent molecule from accepting or emitting light energy when the two components are covalently bound to one another. In the presence of an appropriate enzyme, the enzyme cleaves the covalent bond between the two components and separates one component from the other to permit the fluorescent molecule to accept and emit light energy. In other words, the enzyme frees the fluorescent molecule and allows it to fluoresce. Ideally, fluorescent substrates should be soluble and stable in aqueous buffers, should have a high affinity for the enzymes that act upon them, and should yield a strong signal upon enzymatic action (U.S. Pat. No. 5,998,593A).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDetecting fluorescence emitted from the fluorescent component of a fluorescent enzyme substrate is typically achieved in two steps. The fluorescent molecule is first excited with light energy and subsequently the fluorescence emitted from the fluorescent component is then detected. Generally, fluorescent molecules can be excited with light energy from, for example, a laser or another suitable light source. Fluorescence is detected with a device designed to detect light energy of a wavelength that is emitted by the fluorescent molecule. Such excitation and emission detection systems generally are designed to operate at particular wavelength ranges (U.S. Pat. No. 5,998,593A).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTime-resolved Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) unites TRF (Time-Resolved Fluorescence) and FRET (Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer) principles. This combination brings together the low background benefits of TRF with the homogeneous assay format of FRET. Time-resolved fluorometry (TRF) takes advantage of the unique properties of the rare earth elements called lanthanides. Specifically, lanthanides have large Stoke's shifts and extremely long emission half-lives compared to more traditional fluorophores. The commonly used lanthanides in TRF assays are samarium (Sm), europium (Eu), terbium (Tb), and dysprosium (Dy). Lanthanides are complexed with organic moieties that harvest light and transfer it to the lanthanide through intramolecular processes. FRET uses two fluorophores, a donor and an acceptor. Excitation of the donor by an energy source (e.g. flash lamp or fluorometer laser) triggers an energy transfer to the acceptor if they are within a given proximity to each other. The acceptor in turn emits light at its given wavelength. Because of this energy transfer, molecular interactions between biomolecules can be assessed by coupling each partner with a fluorescent label and detecting the level of energy transfer. More importantly acceptor emissions, as a measure of energy transfer, can be detected without the need to separate bound from unbound assay components (Klostermeier and Millar 2001).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThermofluor® assays detect small changes in the intrinsic melting temperature of proteins based on binding of ligands. Compounds that interact preferentially with the native form of the protein will increase the T\nm\n, the temperature at which half of the protein is unfolded (Pantoliano, Petrella et al. 2001). The technique monitors changes in the fluorescent intensity of dyes such as 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid (1,8-ANS). The fluorescent dyes are quenched in aqueous environments but increase in fluorescence on binding to the hydrophobic core of denatured proteins.\n\n\n \nModeling the Three-Dimensional Structure of ERR-α\n\n\n \n \n \nThe atomic coordinate data provided in Table 6, or the coordinate data derived from homologous proteins may be used to build a three-dimensional model of ERR-α. Any available computational methods may be used to build the three dimensional model. As a starting point, the X-ray diffraction pattern obtained from the assemblage of the molecules or atoms in a crystalline version of ERR-α or an ERR-α homolog can be used to build an electron density map using tools well known to those skilled in the art of crystallography and X-ray diffraction techniques. Additional phase information extracted either from the diffraction data and available in the published literature and/or from supplementing experiments may then be used to complete the reconstruction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor basic concepts and procedures of collecting, analyzing, and utilizing X-ray diffraction data for the construction of electron densities see, for example, (Campbell 1984), (Cantor and Schimmel 1980), (Brunger 1993), (Woolfson 1997), (Drenth 1999), (Tsirelson and Ozerov 1996), and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,942,428A; 6,037,117A; 5,200,910A; and 5,365,456A, each of which is herein specifically incorporated by reference in their entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor basic information on molecular modeling, see, for example, (Schlecht 1998); (Gans, Amann et al. 1996); (Cohen (editor) 1996); and (Smith 1996). U.S. patents which provide detailed information on molecular modeling include U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,906,122A; 5,030,103A; 5,583,973A; 5,612,894A; 5,994,503A; 6,071,700A; 6,075,014A; 6,075,123A; 6,080,576A; 6,093,573A, each of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.\n\n\n \nMethods of Using the Atomic Coordinates to Identify and Design Ligands of Interest\n\n\n \n \n \nThe atomic coordinates of the invention, such as those described in Table 6, or coordinates substantially identical to or homologous to those of Table 6 may be used with any available methods to prepare three dimensional models of ERR-α as well as to identify and design ERR-α ligands, inhibitors, antagonists, agonist, or inverse agonist molecules. Such a method provides the amino acid sequence and/or X-ray diffraction data in a form which allows a skilled artisan to analyze and molecular model the three-dimensional structure of ERR-α or related molecules, including a subdomain thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor instance, three-dimensional modeling may be performed using the experimentally determined coordinates derived from X-ray diffraction patterns, such as those in Table 6, for example, wherein such modeling includes, but is not limited to, drawing pictures of the actual structures, building physical models of the actual structures, and determining the structures of related subunits and ERR-α:ligand and ERR-α subunit:ligand complexes using the coordinates. Such molecular modeling can utilize known X-ray diffraction molecular modeling algorithms or molecular modeling software to generate atomic coordinates corresponding to the three-dimensional structure of ERR-α.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs described above, molecular modeling involves the use of computational methods, preferably computer assisted methods, to build realistic models of molecules that are identifiably related in sequence to the known crystal structure. It also involves modeling new small molecules bound to ERR-α starting with the structures of ERR-α and or ERR-α complexed with known ligands or other molecules. The methods utilized in ligand modeling range from molecular graphics (i.e., 3D representations) to computational chemistry (i.e., calculations of the physical and chemical properties) to make predictions about the binding of ligands or activities of ligands; to design new ligands; and to predict novel molecules, including ligands such as drugs, for chemical synthesis, collectively referred to as rational drug design.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne approach to rational drug design is to search for known molecular structures that might bind to an active site. Using molecular modeling, rational drug design programs can look at a range of different molecular structures of drugs that may fit into the active site of an enzyme, and by moving them in a three-dimensional environment it can be decided which structures actually fit the site well.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn alternative but related rational drug design approach starts with the known structure of a complex with a small molecule ligand and models modifications of that small molecule in an effort to make additional favourable interactions with ERR-α.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention includes the use of molecular and computer modeling techniques to design and select and design ligands, such as small molecule ligands that act as agonists, antagonists, inverse agonists or other therapeutic agents that interact with ERR-α. For example, the invention as herein described includes the design of ligands that act as modulators of at least one ERR-α function by binding to all, or a portion of, the active sites or other regions of ERR-α. In a preferred embodiment, the ligand binds to Cys325 of ERR-α. In another preferred embodiment the ligand is an inverse agonist. Similarly, agents that modulate at least one function of ERR-α, whether or not it is bound to another chemical entity, may be designed using the atomic coordinates of ERR-α or complexes comprising ERR-α of this invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe atomic coordinates of the present invention also provide the needed information to probe a crystal of ERR-α with molecules composed of a variety of different chemical features to determine optimal sites for interaction between candidate modulators of ERR-α activity and ERR-α. For example, high resolution X-ray diffraction data collected from crystals saturated with solvent allows the determination of where each type of solvent molecule sticks. Small molecules that bind to those sites can then be designed and synthesized and tested for their ability to modulate activity (Travis 1993).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also includes methods for computationally screening small molecule databases and libraries for chemical entities, agents, ligands, or compounds that can bind in whole, or in part, to ERR-α. In this screening, the quality of fit of such entities or compounds to the binding site or sites may be judged either by shape complementarity or by estimated interaction energy (Meng, Shoichet et al. 1992).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe design of ligands that bind to, promote or inhibit the functional activity of ERR-α according to this invention generally involves consideration of two factors. First, the compound must be capable of physically and structurally associating with ERR-α. In addition to the covalent interaction described herein, non-covalent molecular interactions important in the association of ERR-α with the ligand include hydrogen bonding, van der Waals and hydrophobic interactions. Second, the ligand must be able to assume a conformation that allows it to associate with ERR-α. Although certain portions of the ligand may not directly participate in the association with ERR-α, those portions may still influence the overall conformation of the molecule. This, in turn, may have a significant impact on binding affinities, therapeutic efficacy, drug-like qualities and potency of the ligand. Such conformational requirements include the overall three-dimensional structure and orientation of the ligand in relation to all or a portion of the active site or other region of ERR-α, or the spacing between functional groups of a ligand comprising several chemical entities that directly interact with ERR-α.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe potential, predicted, agonist, antagonist, inverse agonist, or binding effect of a ligand or other compound on ERR-α may be analyzed prior to its actual synthesis and testing by the use of computer modeling techniques. If the theoretical structure of the given ligand suggests insufficient interaction and association between it and ERR-α, synthesis and testing of the ligand may be obviated. If computer modeling indicates a strong interaction, however, the molecule may then be synthesized and tested for its ability to interact with ERR-α. In this manner, synthesis of inoperative ligand may be avoided. In some cases, inactive ligands are synthesized predicted on modeling and then tested to develop a SAR (structure-activity relationship) for compounds interacting with a specific region of ERR-α.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne skilled in the art may use one of several methods to screen chemical entities, fragments, compounds, or other agents for use as ligands based on their ability to associate with ERR-α and more particularly their ability to associate with the individual binding pockets or active sites of ERR-α. This process may begin by visual inspection of, for example, the active site on the computer screen based on the atomic coordinates of ERR-α or ERR-α complexed with a ligand. Selected chemical entities, compounds, or agents may then be positioned in a variety of orientations, or docked within an individual binding pocket of ERR-α. Docking may be accomplished using software such as QUANTA, available from Accelrys, Inc., San Diego, Calif.; and SYBYL, available for Tripos, St. Louis, Mo.; followed by energy minimization and molecular dynamics with standard molecular mechanics forcefields, such as CHARMm; available from Accelrys, Inc., San Diego, Calif.; and AMBER, University of California, San Francisco.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecialized computer programs may also assist in the process of selecting chemical entities. These include but are not limited to: GRID (Goodford 1985), available from Oxford University, Oxford, UK); MCSS (Miranker and Karplus 1991), available from Molecular Simulations, Burlington, Mass.; AUTODOCK (Goodsell and Olsen 1990), available from Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, Calif.; and DOCK (Kuntz, Blaney et al. 1982), available from University of California, San Francisco, Calif.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe use of software such as GRID, a program that determines probable interaction sites between probes with various functional group characteristics and the macromolecular surface, is used to analyze the surface sites to determine structures of similar inhibiting proteins or compounds. The GRID calculations, with suitable inhibiting groups on molecules (e.g., protonated primary amines) as the probe, are used to identify potential hotspots around accessible positions at suitable energy contour levels. The program DOCK may be used to analyze an active site or ligand-binding site and suggest ligands with complementary steric properties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOnce suitable chemical entities, compounds, or agents have been selected as potential ligands, they can be assembled into a single ligand, compound, antagonist (inhibitor), agonist (activator), or inverse agonist. Assembly may proceed by visual inspection of the relationship of the fragments to each other on the three-dimensional image. This may be followed by manual model building using software such as QUANTA or SYBYL.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUseful programs to aid in connecting the individual chemical entities, compounds, or agents include but are not limited to: CAVEAT (Bartlett, Shea et al. 1989); 3D Database systems such as MACCS-3D (Martin 1992), available from MDL Information Systems, San Leandro, Calif.; and HOOK, available from Molecular Simulations, Burlington, Mass.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral methodologies for searching three-dimensional databases to test pharmacophore hypotheses and select compounds for screening are available. These include the program CAVEAT (Bacon and Moult 1992). For instance, CAVEAT uses databases of cyclic compounds which can act as “spacers” to connect any number of chemical fragments already positioned in the active site. This allows one skilled in the art to quickly generate hundreds of possible ways to connect the fragments already known or suspected to be necessary for tight binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInstead of proceeding to build an inhibitor, activator, agonist, antagonist, or inverse agonist of ERR-α in a step-wise fashion, one chemical entity at a time as described above, such ligands may be designed as a whole or “de novo” using either an empty active site or optionally including some portion(s) of a known molecule(s). These methods include: LUDI (Bohm 1992), available from Biosym Technologies, San Diego, Calif.; LEGEND (Nishibata and Itai 1991), available from Molecular Simulations, Burlington, Mass.; and LeapFrog, available from Tripos Associates, St. Louis, Mo., USA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, the program LUDI can determine a list of interaction sites into which to place both hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic fragments. LUDI then uses a library of linkers to connect up to four different interaction sites into fragments. Then smaller “bridging” groups such as —CH2- and —COO— are used to connect these fragments. For the enzyme DHFR, the placements of key functional groups in the well-known inhibitor methotrexate were reproduced by LUDI. See also, (Rotstein and Murcko 1993).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther molecular modeling techniques may also be employed in accordance with this invention. See, e.g., (Cohen, Blaney et al. 1990). See also, (Navia and Murcko 1992).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOnce a ligand has been designed or selected by the above methods, the affinity with which that ligand may bind or associate with ERR-α may be tested and optimized by computational evaluation and/or by testing biological activity after synthesizing the compound. Ligands may interact with the ERR-α in more than one conformation that is similar in overall binding energy. In those cases, the deformation energy of binding is taken to be the difference between the energy of the free ligand and the average energy of the conformations observed when the ligand binds to ERR-α.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA ligand designed or selected as binding or associating with ERR-α may be further computationally optimized so that in its bound state it would preferably lack repulsive electrostatic interaction with ERR-α. Such non-complementary (e.g., electrostatic) interactions include repulsive charge-charge, dipole-dipole and charge-dipole interactions. Specifically, the sum of all electrostatic interactions between the compound and ERR-α when the compound is bound, preferably make a neutral or favourable contribution to the enthalpy of binding. Weak binding compounds will also be designed by these methods so as to determine SAR.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecific computer software is available in the art to evaluate compound deformation energy and electrostatic interaction. Examples of programs designed for such uses include: Gaussian 92, revision C (Frisch, Trucks et al. 1992); AMBER, University of California, San Francisco; QUANTA and CHARMm, available from Accelrys, Inc., San Diego, Calif.; and Insight II/Discover, from Biosysm Technologies Inc., San Diego, Calif., USA. Other hardware systems and software packages will be known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOnce a ligand that associates with ERR-α has been optimally selected or designed, as described above, substitutions may then be made in some of its atoms or side groups in order to improve or modify its binding properties. Generally, initial substitutions are conservative, i.e., the replacement group will have approximately the same size, shape, hydrophobicity and charge as the original group. It should, of course, be understood that components known in the art to alter conformation may be avoided. Such substituted ligands may then be analyzed for efficiency of fit to ERR-α by the same computer methods described in detail, above.\n\n\n \n \nUse of Homology Structure Modeling to Design Ligands with Modulated Binding or Activity to ERR-α.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention includes the use of the atomic coordinates and structures of ERR-α complexed with a ligand that forms a thioether bond to Cys325 of ERR-α to design modifications to starting ligands and derivatives thereof that will bind more tightly or interact more specifically to the target enzyme.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe structure of a complex between the ERR-α and the starting ligand can be used to guide the modification of that ligand to produce new ligands that have other desirable properties for applicable industrial and other uses (e.g., as pharmaceuticals), such as chemical stability, solubility or membrane permeability. (Lipinski, Lombardo et al. 1997).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBinding ligands, that act as agonists, antagonists, or inverse agonists and such that are known in the art can be diffused into or soaked with the stabilized crystals of ERR-α to form a complex for collecting X-ray diffraction data. Alternatively, ligands known and unknown in the art can be cocrystallized with ERR-α by mixing the ligand with ERR-α before crystallization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo produce custom high affinity and very specific compounds, the structure of ERR-α can be compared to the structure of a selected non-targeted molecule and a hybrid constructed by changing the structure of residues at the binding site for a ligand for the residues at the same positions of the non-target molecule. The process whereby this modeling is achieved is referred to as homology structure modeling. This is done computationally by removing the side chains from the molecule or target of known structure and replacing them with the side chains of the unknown structure put in sterically plausible positions. In this way it can be understood how the shapes of the active site cavities of the targeted and non-targeted molecules differ. This process, therefore, provides information concerning how a bound ligand can be chemically altered in order to produce compounds that will bind tightly and specifically to the desired target but will simultaneously be sterically prevented from binding to the non-targeted molecule. Likewise, knowledge of portions of the bound ligands that are facing to the solvent would allow introduction of other functional groups for additional pharmaceutical purposes. The use of homology structure modeling to design ligands that bind more tightly to the target enzyme than to the non-target enzyme has wide spread applicability.\n\n\n \nDatabases and Computer Systems\n\n\n \n \n \nAn amino acid sequence or nucleotide sequence of ERR-α and/or X-ray diffraction data, useful for computer molecular modeling of ERR-α or a portion thereof, can be provided in a variety of mediums to facilitate use thereof. In one application of this embodiment, databases comprising data pertaining to X-ray diffraction data for a complex of ERR-α and a ligand that forms a thioether bond with Cys325 of ERR-α, or at least one ERR-α subdomain thereof, is recorded on computer readable medium. A skilled artisan can readily appreciate how any of the presently known computer readable media can be used to create a manufacture comprising computer readable medium having recorded thereon data pertaining to X-ray diffraction data of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of data storage structures are available to a skilled artisan for creating a computer readable medium having recorded thereon an amino acid sequence and/or atomic coordinate/X-ray diffraction data of the present invention. The choice of the data storage structure will generally be based on the means chosen to access the stored information. In addition, a variety of data processor programs and formats can be used to store the sequence and X-ray data information of the present invention on computer readable media. The sequence information can be represented in a word processing text file, formatted in commercially-available software such as WordPerfect and MICROSOFT Word, or represented in the form of an ASCII file, stored in a database application, such as DB2, Sybase, Oracle, or the like. A skilled artisan can readily adapt any number of dataprocessor structuring formats (e.g., text file or database) in order to obtain computer readable media having recorded thereon the information of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy providing computer readable media having sequence and/or atomic coordinates based on X-ray diffraction data, a skilled artisan can routinely access the sequence and atomic coordinate or X-ray diffraction data to model a related molecule, a subdomain, mimetic, or a ligand thereof. Computer algorithms are publicly and commercially available which allow a skilled artisan to access this data provided in a computer readable medium and analyze it for molecular modeling and/or RDD (rational drug design). See, e.g., (Mary Ann Liebert (Publishers) 1995).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention further provides systems, particularly computer-based systems, which contain the sequence and/or diffraction data described herein. Such systems are designed to do structure determination and RDD for ERR-α or at least one subdomain thereof. Non-limiting examples are microcomputer workstations available from Silicon Graphics Incorporated and Sun Microsystems running UNIX based, Windows NT or IBM OS/2 operating systems.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of comparing means can also be used to compare a target sequence or target motif with the data storage means to identify structural motifs or electron density maps derived in part from the atomic coordinate/X-ray diffraction data. A skilled artisan can readily recognize that any one of the publicly available computer modeling programs can be used as the search means for the computer-based systems of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \nIntegrated Procedures which Utilize the Present Invention\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMolecular modeling is provided by the present invention for rational drug design (RDD) of mimetics and ligands that form a thioether bond with Cys325 of ERR-α. As described above, the drug design paradigm uses computer-modeling programs to determine potential mimetics and ligands which are expected to interact with sites on the protein. The potential mimetics or ligands are then screened for activity and/or binding and/or interaction. For ERR-α-related mimetics or ligands, screening methods can be selected from assays for at least one biological activity of ERR-α.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, the tools and methodologies provided by the present invention may be used in procedures for identifying and designing ligands which bind in desirable ways with the target. Such procedures utilize an iterative process whereby ligands are synthesized, tested and characterized. New ligands can be designed based on the information gained in the testing and characterization of the initial ligands and then such newly identified ligands can themselves be tested and characterized. This series of processes may be repeated as many times as necessary to obtain ligands with the desirable binding properties.\n\n\n \n \nThe following steps (1-7) serve as an example of the overall procedure:\n\n \n \n \n \n \n1. A biological activity of a target is selected.\n \n2. A ligand is identified that appears to be in some way associated with the chosen biological activity (e.g., the ligand may be an agonist, antagonist, or inverse agonist of a known activity). The activity of the ligand may be tested by in vivo and/or in vitro methods. A ligand of the present invention can be, but is not limited to, at least one selected from a lipid, a nucleic acid, a compound, a protein, an element, an antibody, a saccharide, an isotope, a carbohydrate, an imaging agent, a lipoprotein, a glycoprotein, an enzyme, a detectable probe, and antibody or fragment thereof, or any combination thereof, which can be detectably labeled as for labeling antibodies. Such labels include, but are not limited to, enzymatic labels, radioisotope or radioactive compounds or elements, fluorescent compounds or metals, chemiluminescent compounds and bioluminescent compounds. Alternatively, any other known diagnostic or therapeutic agent can be used in a method of the invention. Suitable compounds are then tested for activities in relationship to the target. Complexes between ERR-α and ligands are made either by co-crystallization or more commonly by diffusing the ligand into the crystal. X-ray diffraction data from the crystal complex are measured and a difference electron density map is calculated. This process provides the precise location of the bound ligand on the target molecule. The difference Fourier is calculated using measure diffraction amplitudes and the phases of these reflections calculated from the coordinates.\n \n3. Using the methods of the present invention, X-ray crystallography is utilized to create electron density maps and/or molecular models of the interaction of the ligand with the target molecule. The entry of the coordinates of the target into the computer programs discussed above results in the calculation of most probable structure of the macromolecule. These structures are combined and refined by additional calculations using such programs to determine the probable or actual three-dimensional structure of the target including potential or actual active or binding sites of ligands. Such molecular modeling (and related) programs useful for rational drug design of ligands or mimetics are also provided by the present invention.\n \n4. The electron density maps and/or molecular models obtained in Step 3 are compared to the electron density maps and/or molecular models of a non-ligand containing target and the observed/calculated differences are used to specifically locate the binding of the ligand on the target or subunit.\n \n5. Modeling tools, such as computational chemistry and computer modeling, are used to adjust or modify the structure of the ligand so that it can make additional or different interactions with the target. The ligand design uses computer-modeling programs which calculate how different molecules interact with the various sites of the target, subunit, or a fragment thereof. Thus, this procedure determines potential ligands or ligand mimetics.\n \n6. The newly designed ligand from Step 5 can be tested for its biological activity using appropriate in vivo or in vitro tests, including but not limited to the high-throughput screening methods discussed above. The potential ligands or mimetics are then screened for activity relating to ERR-α, or at least a fragment thereof. Such screening methods are selected from assays for at least one biological activity of the native target. The resulting ligands or mimetics, provided by methods of the present invention, are useful for treating, screening or preventing diseases in animals, such as mammals (including humans).\n \n7. Of course, each of the above steps can be modified as desired by those of skill in the art so as to refine the procedure for the particular goal in mind. Also, additional X-ray diffraction data may be collected on ERR-α, ERR-α/ligand complexes, ERR-α structural target motifs and ERR-α subunit/ligand complexes at any step or phase of the procedure. Such additional diffraction data can be used to reconstruct electron density maps and molecular models, which may further assist in the design and selection of ligands with the desirable binding attributes.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nIt is to be understood that the present invention is considered to include stereoisomers as well as optical isomers, e.g., mixtures of enantiomers as well as individual enantiomers and diastereomers, which arise as a consequence of structural asymmetry in selected compounds, ligands or mimetics of the present series.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome of the ligands disclosed or discovered by the methods herein may contain one or more asymmetric centers and thus give rise to enantiomers, diastereomers, and other stereoisomeric forms. The present invention is also meant to encompass all such possible forms as well as their racemic and resolved forms and mixtures thereof. When the ligands described or discovered herein contain olefinic double bonds or other centers of geometric asymmetry, and unless otherwise specified, it is intended to include both E and Z geometric isomers. All tautomers are intended to be encompassed by the present invention as well.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\n \n \n \nWithout further description, it is believed that one of ordinary skill in the art can, using the preceding description and the following illustrative examples, make and utilize the present invention and practice the claimed methods. The following working examples therefore, specifically point out preferred embodiments of the present invention, and are not to be construed as limiting in any way the remainder of the disclosure.\n\n\n \nProtein Cloning, Expression and Purification\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ligand binding domain of human ERR-α (amino acids 290-519 of Swiss-Prot P11474, SEQ ID NO:1) was subcloned into pDEST (Novagen) to produce a construct with a PreScission protease cleavage site for cleavage of an included N-terminal His tag (SEQ ID NO:2). The plasmid was co-transfected with linearized baculovirus DNA into \nSpodoptera frugiperda \n(Sf9) insect cells and the baculovirus was amplified and purified from plaques from a titer 1-2×10\n8 \npfu/mL. Sf9 cells were maintained in ESF 921 media (Expression Systems. LLC, Woodland, Calif.) and grown in 2 L Erlenmeyer flasks at 27° C. The insect cells at a cell density of 1.5×10\n6 \ncells/mL were infected with the baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. Cells were harvested 3 days post-infection by centrifugation at 1200×g, rinsed with PBS supplemented with protease inhibitors and stored at −80° C. until further use. Expression level of the protein was confirmed by Western blots using anti-His antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor purification, the cells containing recombinant human ERR-α were suspended in 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 M NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 0.6 mM PMSF, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol (buffer A) supplemented with Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche). The suspension was sonicated using Branson-450 sonicator and clarified by centrifugation at 100,000×g for 1 hour. The supernatant was applied onto 5 ml Ni-NTA column (QIAGEN) pre-equilibrated in buffer A. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of 50 mM imidazole in buffer A, and developed by 250 mM imidazole in buffer A. The elution fractions containing ERR-α were pooled and dialyzed O/N against 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM dithiothreitol (buffer B). After dialysis, the protein was loaded on MonoQ 10/10 (GE Healthcare) and the column was developed by 50-1000 mM linear gradient of NaCl in buffer B. The ERR-α was eluted at about 300 mM NaCl and its purity was greater than 95% as judged by SDS-PAGE. Finally, the ERR-α was concentrated to 17 mg/ml at 2× molar access of the Compound 1, and delivered for crystallization in 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.3 M NaCl, 5 mM dithiothreitol.\n\n\n \nCrystallization and Data Collection\n\n\n \n \n \nUsing a hanging drop vapor diffusion method, crystals formed at 277° K in a drop solution containing a 1:1 ratio of the solution of the ERR-α protein and Compound 1 complex and a solution containing 1.4 M ammonium sulfate, 100 mM Pipes pH 6.5 and 200 mM Na-thiocyanate. The drop was suspended over a the same solution used to make the drop, the solution containing 1.4 M ammonium sulfate, 100 mM Pipes pH 6.5 and 200 mM Na-thiocyanate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe crystals were transferred to a cryoprotectant solution containing 1.4 M ammonium sulfate, 100 mM Pipes pH 6.5, 200 mM Na-thiocyanate and 25% glycerol. The crystals were then mounted and quickly frozen by immersion in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data to a resolution of 2.0 Å were collected on a Bruker AXS Proteum 6000 detector. Diffraction data was indexed, integrated and scaled using the Proteum Processing Program suite from Bruker AXS. Under these conditions, the crystals belong to the P6522 space group, with unit cell parameters a=b=103, c=110 Å, α=β=90 and γ=120. The structure was determined by molecular replacement with CNX (Brunger, Adams et al. 1998) using the crystal structure of ERR-α in complex with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator-1 (PGC1-α, pdb id 1XB7) as the search model (Kallen, Schlaeppi et al. 2004). Model building was done using the program 0 (Jones, Zou et al. 1991) and Coot (Emsley and Cowtan 2004). Refinement and map calculations were carried out using PHENIX (Adams, Grosse-Kunstleve et al. 2002). The final structure was refined to an Rfactor of 21.1 and Rfree of 24.9. Inspection of the electron density map revealed that Compound 1 bound between helices 3 and 11 of ERR-α.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrystal and Refinement Parameters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nParameter\n\n\nBPA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nUnit cell, Å\n\n\na = b = 103.007\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nc = 110.017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nResolution, Å\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompleteness, %\n\n\n 99.92\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRmerge\n¥\n, %\n\n\n  10 (44.6)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n<I>/<\nσI\n>\n\n\n8.20 (2.18)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRfactor\n#\n, %\n\n\n21.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRfree\n¶\n, %\n\n\n24.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nValues in parenthesis refer to the highest resolution shell\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n¥\nR\nmerge \n= Σ\nhkl \nΣ\nI \n(|I\nI \n− <I>|/<I>), where I\nI \nis an individual intensity measurement and <I> is the average intensity for this reflection, with summation over all data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n#\nRfactor = Σ∥F\no\n| − |F\nc\n∥/Σ|F\no\n|.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n¶\n10% of the total reflections withheld.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nX-Ray Structure Discussion\n\n\n \n \n \nA comparison between the crystal structure of the complex of ERR-α and Compound 1 and the previously determined crystal structure of the complex of ERR-α and PGC1-α showed conserved arrangement of secondary structural elements throughout most of the structure (\nFIG. 1A\n). The excellent data quality obtained from the complex of ERR-α and Compound 1 allowed unambiguous placement of Compound 1 in the electron density (\nFIG. 2A\n). The positions of the sulfurs of Cys325 and the thiazole of Compound 1 were validated by the calculation of a sulfur anomalous map (\nFIG. 2B\n). Anomalous signal from all other cysteines and methionines throughout the protein were also observed. Secondary structure rearrangement upon Compound 1 binding included the displacement of helix 11 and helix 12. The side chains of residues F328 and F495 must move to accommodate the ligand as shown on \nFIG. 1B\n. The structure of the complex of ERR-α and Compound 1 also showed helix 12 occupying the position of the activation peptide. Some shifting was also observed on helix 3 and its side chains to make room for Compound 1 and maximize its interactions with helix 12.\n\n\n \nERR-α Covalent Modification\n\n\n \n \n \nInspection of the binding site and protein-ligand interactions revealed Compound 1 binding covalently to the protein by a thioether bond between the carbon C5 of the Compound 1 and the sulfur from Cys325. The distance between the sulfur of Cys325 and carbon C6 is 2.44 Å, consistent with a covalent bond. The double bond between C6 and C7 of the Compound 1 must reduce in order to allow C6 to covalently link the protein. A measurement of this distance is 1.55 Å, consistent with a carbon-carbon single bond distance and evidence that covalent modification occurred.\n\n\n \nOther Interactions Observed and to be Explored\n\n\n \n \n \nThe hydrophobic pocket of ERR-α presents a few polar groups within H-bond distance to Compound 1 that could be explored in further optimization to develop additional ligands. These residues include E331, R372, F382-carbonyl and L324-carbonyl (Table 2). The carbonyl of F382 hydrogen bonds (3.41 Å) with N2 in the cyano. The carbons C13 and C14 of the 3-Trifluoromethyl-benzonitrile are close enough to the carbonyl of L324 that an H-donor substitution would take advantage of the proximity to this residue. The cyano group of Compound 1 is 3.2 Å from R372, another proton donor. Substituting the cyano with an electronegative atom could potentially optimize this part of the molecule.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nList of contacts between ERR-α and Compound 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwithin a distance of 3.5Å\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource atoms\n\n\n \n\n\ntarget atoms\n\n\n \n\n\ndistance Å\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeu\n\n\n324A\n\n\nCB\n\n\n. . .\n\n\nLig\n\n\n1I\n\n\nO02\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n3.42\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeu\n\n\n324A\n\n\nO\n\n\n. . .\n\n\nLig\n\n\n1I\n\n\nC19\n\n\n. . . \n\n\n3.28\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCys\n\n\n325A\n\n\nCB\n\n\n. . .\n\n\nLig\n\n\n1I\n\n\nC06\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n3.36\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCys\n\n\n325A\n\n\nSG\n\n\n. . .\n\n\nLig\n\n\n1I\n\n\nC07\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n2.94\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n. . .\n\n\nLig\n\n\n1I\n\n\nC12\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n3.48\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n. . .\n\n\nLig\n\n\n1I\n\n\nC05\n\n\n. . . \n\n\n3.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n. . .\n\n\nLig\n\n\n1I\n\n\nC06\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n2.44\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n. . .\n\n\nLig\n\n\n1I\n\n\nC04\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n3.24\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhe\n\n\n328A\n\n\nCG\n\n\n. . .\n\n\nLig\n\n\n1I\n\n\nC14\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n3.40\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n. . .\n\n\nLig\n\n\n1I\n\n\nC15\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n3.17\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhe\n\n\n328A\n\n\nCD1\n\n\n. . .\n\n\nLig\n\n\n1I\n\n\nC14\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n3.39\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhe\n\n\n328A\n\n\nCD2\n\n\n. . .\n\n\nLig\n\n\n1I\n\n\nC15\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n3.33\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlu\n\n\n331A\n\n\nCG\n\n\n. . .\n\n\nLig\n\n\n1I\n\n\nN23\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n3.29\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArg\n\n\n372A\n\n\nNH2\n\n\n. . .\n\n\nLig\n\n\n1I\n\n\nN23\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n3.21 ***\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhe\n\n\n382A\n\n\nO\n\n\n. . .\n\n\nLig\n\n\n1I\n\n\nN23\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n3.41 *\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAla\n\n\n396A\n\n\nO\n\n\n. . .\n\n\nLig\n\n\n1I\n\n\nC01\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n3.27\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeu\n\n\n398A\n\n\nCD2\n\n\n. . .\n\n\nLig\n\n\n1I\n\n\nO02\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n3.28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n. . .\n\n\nLig\n\n\n1I\n\n\nC01\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n3.40\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVal\n\n\n491A\n\n\nCG1\n\n\n. . .\n\n\nLig\n\n\n1I\n\n\nF27\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n3.19\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhe\n\n\n495A\n\n\nCZ\n\n\n. . .\n\n\nLig\n\n\n1I\n\n\nC03\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n3.33\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n. . .\n\n\nLig\n\n\n1I\n\n\nC16\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n3.19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n. . .\n\n\nLig\n\n\n1I\n\n\nO17\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n3.33\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMet\n\n\n506A\n\n\nCE\n\n\n. . .\n\n\nLig\n\n\n1I\n\n\nC14\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n3.40\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n. . .\n\n\nLig\n\n\n1I\n\n\nC15\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n3.30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n*** indicates strong hydrogen bonds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLC/MS Experiments\n\n\n \n \n \nTo monitor the kinetics of association and dissociation for ligands that formed a complex with ERR-α by forming a covalent bond to Cys325 of ERR-α, LC/MS detection was employed. LC analysis was performed on an Agilent 1100 LC system that was in line with an Agilent MSD TOF for mass detection. Software provided by the vendor was used to deconvolute the ESI positive ion quadrupole time-of-flight spectra. To measure association rates, typically a 1 μM ERR-α solution was mixed with an equal volume of a 2 μM ligand solution. 20 uL aliquots of the mixed solutions were removed at time zero and at regular defined time intervals and diluted out in 100 μL of a 0.1% TFA, 10% CH\n3\nCN solution to quench the reaction. 50 μL samples of the diluted analyte were processed on the LC/MS instrument. Similarly, for determination of the dissociation rates, the mixed solutions of ERR-α and the ligand were first equilibrated up to one hour to allow formation of the complex. At time 0, a 20-fold excess of a competing ligand (Compound 2) was added and aliquots were removed and processed as described for the association rate experiments. Final concentrations for the ligand, ERR-α, and the competing ligand were 1 μM, 0.5 μM, and 20 μM, respectively. All experiments were carried out in buffer containing 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 200 mM KCl and 3% DMSO at 37° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the apo form of ERR-α, a mass of 27042 was detected, corresponding to an amino acid sequence where the initiator methionine is cleaved followed by N-terminal acetylation. This is the “Expected Mass” shown in Table 3. When the ERR-α protein was incubated with a ligand that formed a covalent bond to Cys325 of ERR-α, there was a time dependent increase in the mass of the protein equal to the mass of the compound+1 amu (Table 3).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nObserved mass changes for 2 ligands that formed a complex with ERR-α\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nExpected\n\n\nObserved\n\n\nMass\n\n\nLigand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound\n\n\nMass\n\n\nMass\n\n\nDifference\n\n\nMass\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound Structure\n\n\nNumber\n\n\n(daltons)\n\n\n(daltons)\n\n\n(daltons)\n\n\n(daltons)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound 1\n\n\n27042\n\n\n27461\n\n\n419\n\n\n420.0392\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound 2\n\n\n27042\n\n\n27494\n\n\n452\n\n\n453.0494\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe progress of the reaction was expressed as a fraction of the integrated areas observed for the expected mass (27042 amu) and observed mass (27042+compound amu−1) with the following expression:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprogress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nof\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreaction\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\narea\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nof\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nobserved\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\narea\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nof\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nobserved\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmass\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\narea\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nof\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexpected\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilarly for the experiments to measure dissociation rates, incubation of a complex of ERR-α and a ligand with the competing ligand resulted in a time dependent change in the mass of the complex of ERR-α and the ligand, equal to the mass difference of the ligand and the competing ligand. To standardize the experiments to measure dissociation rates for different ligands, the same competing ligand (Compound 2) was used in all experiments. The progress of the reaction was also expressed as a fraction of the area observed for the complex of ERR-α and the competing ligand over the sum of total area for the complex of ERR-α with the ligand and the complex of ERR-α with the competing ligand.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAssociation and dissociation rates for ligands were determined by fitting fractional values obtained for the progress of the reaction as a function of time using a single exponential equation\n\n\n \n \n \nprogress of reaction=e\n−kt \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nwhere k is the apparent rate constant.

The components of this homogeneous secondary assay included: the purified ERR-α protein (SEQ ID NO:2), a GST-labeled-hSRC2 co-activator polypeptide, and a fluorescent donor/acceptor pair from CIS bio international htrf/bioassays (Bedford, Mass.) using both an α-GST Europium Cryptate (Eu) label and an α\n6\nHis-XL665 (allophycocyanin) fluorophore.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor TR-FRET measurements, the reaction was buffered in 25 mM Tris pH 8, 2.5 mM Hepes, 20 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, and 0.05 mg/mL BSA (-lipids). The final concentrations of reagents were 6 nM of ERR-α protein, 6 nM GST-SRC-2 peptide, 30 nM Eu cryptate, and 7.5 nM XL665. Reactions were allowed to reach equilibrium at 25° C. for 4-18 hours before collecting data on the Analyst from LJL Biosystems (Molecular Devices Sunnyvale, Calif.). As a time-resolved method, the samples were excited at 340 nM and emission was collected for 1 ms at both 615 and 665 nm with delays of 400 and 75 μs, respectively.

Description\n\n\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\nThe present invention relates to novel α-amino acid derivatives. These derivatives have βARK-1 inhibitory activity and are useful for preventing or treating heart failure. Moreover, these derivatives also have antitumor activity, in particular, dual inhibitory activity on Aurora kinase and CDK, and are useful for cell proliferative diseases such as cancer.\n\n\nBACKGROUND ART\n\n\nG protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) is an enzyme for phosphorylation and desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) activated by an agonist. Research on the physiological functions of members of the GRK family has been conducted primarily focusing on a member of that family in the form of β adrenergic receptor kinase 1 (βARK1=GRK2) and on a member of the GPCR family in the form of β adrenergic receptor (βAR). Although there are reports suggesting that GRK is involved in the formation of the pathology of various diseases, the relationship between cardiac βAR phosphorylation and desensitization by βARK1 and the pathology of heart failure has been the subject of the greatest research.\n\n\nIn the heart of a patient with heart failure, it is well known that the expressed amount of βARK1 mRNA increases remarkably and desensitization of cardiac βAR occurs (see, for example, Non-Patent Documents 1 and 2). A similar result has been obtained in various animal models of heart failure, and it's believed that cardiac βAR phosphorylation and desensitization by βARK1 is a causative factor of exacerbating the pathology of heart failure.\n\n\nSince βARK1 is activated as a result of being translocated to the cell membrane by bonding Gβγ and the C terminal thereof, the preventive and therapeutic effects on the pathology of heart failure by inhibition of βARK1 can be examined by expressing the C terminal of βARK1 (βARKct: peptide composed of the 495th to 689th amino acids) as dominant negative βARK1 in the hearts of various heart failure animal models. For example, improvement of cardiac function by introduction of βARKct into the hearts of a rabbit post-myocardial infarction heart failure model (see, for example, Non-Patent Documents 3 and 4), the suppression of the onset of heart failure in muscle LIM protein knockout (MLP−/−) mice by crossing a dilated cardiomyopathy model in the form of MLP−/− mice with βARKct transgenic mice (see, for example, Non-Patent Document 5), the suppression of reduction of cardiac function and death in calsequestrin (CSQ) transgenic mice by crossing a dilated cardiomyopathy model n the form of CSQ transgenic mice with βARKct transgenic mice (see, for example, Non-Patent Document 6), and the suppression of death due to post-myocardial infraction heart failure in βARKct transgenic mice (see, for example, Patent Document 1) have been previously reported. Thus, βARK1 inhibitors are thought to be promising as preventives and therapeutics for heart failure.\n\n\nHowever, although there have been some reports thus far relating to compounds having βARK1 inhibitory activity (see, for example, Non-Patent Document 7 and Patent Documents 2 to 4), there have yet to be any reports relating to α-amino acid derivatives having βARK1 inhibitory activity.\n\n\nAlthough cardiotonics, β-blockers, inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme, angiotensin II antagonists and calcium antagonists and the like are currently used to treat heart failure, since cardiotonics are associated with an increased mortality rate caused by long-term administration, the effects of inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme and angiotensin II antagonists are insufficient, and β-blockers have the disadvantage of requiring hospitalized monitoring due to the negative inotropic action thereof, a drug is sought that is safer and more highly effective.\n\n\nOn the other hand, the majority of the cells of the human body do not undergo cell division except for in the case of requiring cell regeneration such as during tissue damage. However, certain limited cells such as tumor cells proliferate at a certain frequency. Such cells are referred to as being in a “cell cycle”. The cell cycle consists of four stages in a predetermined sequence, and these are referred to as the G1 stage, S stage, G2 stage and M stage. Progression of the cell cycle is precisely controlled by various kinases such as cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) and Aurora kinase. As the relationship between disruption of the cell cycle and tumor formation and proliferation has become clearer, the importance of cell cycle research has enhanced on the basis of it being potentially intimately involved in the essential nature of tumors. On the basis of this background, although research has conventionally been conducted on the manner in which the cell cycle progresses, the control mechanisms of the cell cycle and methods for inhibiting the cell cycle in order to elucidate the mechanism of tumors and develop pharmaceuticals, analysis of the cell cycle has recently become an important analytical tool in fields such as cell death, aging and regeneration as well.\n\n\nAurora kinase, which is a kind of serine-threonine kinase, is known to exist in the form of three types of subtypes (Aurora A, B and C) having high homology between the kinase domains of the C terminal. These subtypes are collectively referred to as the Aurora family. On the basis of previous research, the Aurora family has been determined to be essential for accurately controlling mitosis, including separation of the centromere in the mitosis stage and bipolar spindle formation (see, for example, Non-Patent Document 8). The relationship between Aurora kinase and tumors began with reports describing the over-expression of Aurora-A and Aurora-B in colon cancer (see, for example, Non-Patent Document 9), and were followed by reports indicating that Aurora-A is highly expressed in numerous tumors such as breast cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer, gastric cancer and pancreatic cancer. In addition, results have also been reported indicating that cancer patients in which Aurora kinase is expressed at high levels have a poor prognosis (see, for example, Non-Patent Document 10), and several Aurora kinase inhibitors are known to be currently undergoing clinical evaluation.\n\n\nCyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), which is also a serine-threonine kinase, also plays an extremely important role in regulation of the cell cycle. This kinase precisely controls the cell cycle by expressing its function as a result of forming complexes specific to the cell cycle between enzyme subunits having enzyme activity in the form of CDK1, CDK2, CDK3, CDK4 or CDK6 and activity-regulating subunits expressed specifically to the cell cycle in the form of cyclins A, B, D1, D2, D3 and E (in the present description, complexes composed of catalyst subunits in the form of CDK# and activity-regulating subunits in the form of cyclin* are represented as “CDK#/cyclin*” complexes) (see, for example, Non-Patent Document 11).\n\n\nFor example, CDK1/cyclin B complex is required for progression from the G2 stage to the M stage of the cell cycle, and is also required to complete mitosis (see, for example, Non-Patent Document 12). The CDK2/cyclin E complex controls progression from the G1 stage to the S stage (see, for example, Non-Patent Document 13). CDK3 is thought to function in progression to the G1 stage and although it was thought to be important in G1-S progression (see, for example, Non-Patent Document 14), according to more recent reports, cells not present in the cell stage (G0 cells) have been reported to function during progression to the G1 stage in order to initiate cell proliferation (see, for example, Non-Patent Document 15).\n\n\nMutation and high expression of CDK and cyclin genes have been frequently reported in numerous genes similar to the Aurora family. As a result, attention has been focused on CDK as well as an important target molecule for cancer therapy, and numerous pharmaceutical companies are proceeding with research and development of low molecular weight compounds targeting the ATP-binding region of CDK. These CDK inhibitors inhibit proliferation of tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo (see, for example, Non-Patent Document 16). Numerous CDK inhibitors are known to be currently undergoing clinical evaluations.\n\n\nAurora kinase inhibitors and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors both inhibit proliferation of tumor cells in xenograft mouse strains loaded with human tumor cells in human tumor cell lines as well. However, since human cancers are composed of genetically and biologically heterogeneous cells, sensitivity to individual antitumor agents is known to vary for each individual cell. For this reason, in order to develop highly effective antitumor agents, instead of developing Aurora kinase inhibitors and CDK inhibitors separately, it is preferable to develop drugs that simultaneously inhibit a plurality of targets relating to cell proliferation. This is supported by the fact that numerous multi-kinase inhibitors such as sunitinib maleate (SU11248 maleate: including VEGFR-1,2,3, PDGFR, KIT, Flt3 and CSFIR), imanitib mesylate (Gleevec: including Bcr-Abl kinase, C-KIT and PDGFR) and lapanitib (including EGFR and HER2) demonstrate potent clinical effects.\n\n\nThere are currently no antitumor agents that have actually been released commercially in the form of dual Aurora kinase and CDK inhibitors (referred to as “Aurora/CDK dual inhibitors” in the present description). Although the only such inhibitor currently at the pre-clinical trial stage is JNJ-7706621, since it is necessary to administer this drug by consecutive daily subcutaneous injections in order to obtain the maximum effects thereof, it is predicted to encounter difficulties in clinical application in consideration of patient QOL (see, for example, \nPatent Document\n 5 and Non-Patent Document 17). Namely, there is currently no practical therapeutic drug for use in preventing or treating cancer that has Aurora/CDK dual inhibitory activity.\n\n\nIn addition, there are numerous drugs that simultaneously inhibit Aurora kinase and CDK known to currently be in the research stage. However, compounds having a pyrazolobenzothiazole backbone have previously not been known as compounds that simultaneously inhibit Aurora kinase and CDK.\n\n\nNon-Patent Document 1: Ungerer, M. et al., Circulation 1993; 87: 454-463\n\n\nNon-Patent Document 2: Ungerer, M. et al., Cir.

βARK1\n\n\nHuman βARK1 was amplified by PCR based on the base sequence of human βARK1 mRNA registered in GenBank (Accession No. M80776) using a human leukocyte cDNA library (Gibco BRL Cat. No. 10421-022) as a template. The amplified cDNA fragment was inserted into a pBacPAK8 vector (Clontech) to construct a plasmid.\n\n\nRecombinant human βARK1 was expressed using the BacPAK Baculovirus Expression System (Clontech, Cat. No. K1601-1). 1×10\n6 \nSf-9 cells were adhered to a 35 mm dish in 2.5 mL of TMN-FH Insect Medium containing 10 vol % FBS (Pharminogen, Cat. No. PM-21227M) and cultured overnight at 27° C. On the following day, the medium was removed and 500 ng of the above plasmid, BacPAK6 viral DNA cleaved with Bsu36I (5 μL) and 1.5 mL of the same medium mixed with 4 μL of Bacfectin were added followed by culturing for 5 hours, further adding 1.5 mL of medium and subsequently culturing for 5 days. This co-transfection resulted in homologous recombination, and constructed a recombinant virus for expressing βARK1 in Sf-9 cells. The culture supernatant after 5 days was recovered and a plaque assay was carried out to isolate single plaques. These were then infected into Sf-9 cells and the resulting culture supernatant was designated as Passage 1 (1−3×10\n11 \npfu/mL). Passage 1 was added to 3×10\n7 \nSf-9 cells to a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 (pfu/cell), suspension culturing was carried out for 5 days using a spinner flask, and the resulting culture supernatant was designated as Passage 2 (4×10\n10 \npfu/mL) and used as a viral liquid for large-volume expression.\n\n\nSf-9 cells at 3×10\n9 \ncells/200 mL were infected by adding Passage 2 to an MOI of 100 followed by addition of medium to bring to a liquid volume of 2 L and further culturing for 3 days. After recovering the cells by centrifugation and washing three times with PBS, the cells were suspended in 100 mL of Lysis Buffer (20 mmol/L HEPES-HCl (pH 7.2), 5 mmol/L EDTA, 3 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)). After lysing the cells by ultrasonic treatment at low temperature, the supernatant was recovered by centrifuging (45,000×g, 15 minutes) (sup1). NaCl was added to the resulting supernatant to a final concentration of 250 mmol/L followed by ultracentrifugation (300,000×g, 60 minutes) and using the subsequent supernatant as a crude cell extract (sup2).\n\n\nPurification was carried out with reference to the literature (Benovic, J. L., Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 351-362; Kim, C. M. et al., Receptor 1993; 3: 39-55; Sohlemann, P. et al., FEBS Letters 1993; 324: 59-62). The crude cell extract was accurately brought to a volume of 400 mL with Buffer C (20 mmol/L HEPES-HCl (pH 7.2), 5 mmol/L EDTA, 0.02 vol % Triton X-100) followed by loading onto a 50 mL SP-Sepharose FF (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated with Buffer C. After washing the column with a Wash Buffer (50 mmol/L NaCl, Buffer C), the column was eluted with an NaCl concentration gradient (50 to 300 mmol/L NaCl for 125 minutes, flow rate: 4 mL/min). ETA was carried out on each fraction using anti-GRK2 antibody (Santa-Cruz Cat. No. SC-562) and the positive fractions were collected (GRK2=βARK1). This was then diluted three-fold with Buffer C and loaded on a 5 mL HiTrap Heparin column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated with Buffer C. After washing the column with Wash Buffer (100 mmol/L NaCl, Buffer C), the column was eluted with an NaCl concentration gradient (100 to 600 mmol/L NaCl for 100 minutes, flow rate: 1 mL/min). The positive fractions as determined by ETA were collected and stored in a freezer at −80° C.\n\n\n(2) Measurement of βARK1 Inhibitory Activity\n\n\nA synthetic peptide having an amino acid sequence of biotinated-RRREEEEESAAA was used in accordance with a previous report (Chen, C. Y. et al., J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7825-7831). This synthetic peptide can also be synthesized with reference to known synthesis methods (for example, Chen, C. Y. et al., J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7825-7831, Biochemistry 1991; 30: 5118-5125). 2 μl of a DMSO solution in which the test compound was diluted to as to be 26 times the final concentration was dispensed into a 96-well plate (round bottom) (Falcon 351190) (final concentration: 4 vol % DMSO). A substrate solution (1 mmol/L peptide, 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mmol/L EDTA, 7.5 mmol/L MgCl\n2\n, 80 μmol/L ATP, 0.005 vol % Triton X-100), to which was added [γ-\n33\nP]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Cat. No. AH9968) equivalent to 9.25 kBq/well, was prepared, and 25 μL of this substrate solution were added to a plate in which was dispensed a compound followed by shaking for 3 minutes. 25 μl of an enzyme solution mixed with βARK1 (20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mmol/L EDTA, 7.5 mmol/L MgCl\n2\n, 19 to 38 nmol/L βARK1, 0.005 volt Triton X-100) were then added followed by further shaking for 3 minutes to initiate the phosphorylation reaction at room temperature. After 60 minutes, 40 μl of the reaction solution were added to a Multiscreen MA-PH plate (Millipore, Cat. No. MAPH NOB10), pre-wetted with a 100 mmol/L aqueous phosphoric acid solution containing 100 μL of 0.01 vol % Triton X-100 and filled with 150 μL of the same solution, followed by shaking for 10 minutes at room temperature. After shaking for 10 minutes, aspiration filtration was carried out using the Multiscreen Vacuum Manifold followed by washing three times with 100 mmol/L aqueous phosphoric acid solution containing 180 μL of 0.01 vol % Triton X-100 to remove free [γ-\n33\nP]ATP and test compound. After removing the underdrain from a PH plate, the PH plate was dried in a 50° C. oven followed by the addition of 30 μL of SuperMix liquid scintillation cocktail (Wallac) and measuring radioactivity using the MicroBeta 1450 PLUS (Wallac) 2 hours after permeating through a phosphocellulose membrane.\n\n\nGraphPad PRISM Ver. 3.0 (GraphPad Software Inc.) was used to calculate IC\n50 \nvalues. IC\n50 \nvalues were calculated by selecting the calculation formula for non-linear regression analysis “Sigmoidal dose response” by assigning an inhibition rate of 100% for data obtained in the absence of enzyme addition or data obtained by adding a termination buffer prior to addition of enzyme to the substrate. Those results are shown in Table 2. Based on the results of Table 2, compounds of the present invention are recognized to have extremely superior βARK1 inhibitory activity. Accordingly, compounds of the present invention were suggested to be useful as preventives or therapeutics for heart failure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSynthesis\n\n\nβARK1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExample No.\n\n\nIC50 (μM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n6\n\n\n0.0040\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n16\n\n\n0.0083\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n24\n\n\n0.0080\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n30\n\n\n0.0098\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n33\n\n\n0.0078\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n35\n\n\n0.0088\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n53\n\n\n0.0020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n55\n\n\n0.0063\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n56\n\n\n0.0032\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n58\n\n\n0.0064\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n60\n\n\n0.0045\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n75\n\n\n0.0088\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n76\n\n\n0.0093\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n81\n\n\n0.0083\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n82\n\n\n0.0093\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n85\n\n\n0.0099\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n95\n\n\n0.0087\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n97\n\n\n0.0120\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n117\n\n\n0.0039\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n118\n\n\n0.0087\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n120\n\n\n0.0037\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n121\n\n\n0.0046\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n126\n\n\n0.0075\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n127\n\n\n0.0062\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n128\n\n\n0.0028\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n129\n\n\n0.0039\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n132\n\n\n0.0077\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n135\n\n\n0.0032\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n139\n\n\n0.0079\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n144\n\n\n0.0077\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n145\n\n\n0.0077\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPharmacological Test Example 2\n\n\nInhibitory Activities Against Aurora A, CDK1/Cyclin B Complex, CDK2/Cyclin E Complex and CDK3/Cyclin E Complex\n\n\nInhibitory activity against Aurora A, CDK1/Cyclin B complex, CDK2/Cyclin E complex and CDK3/Cyclin E complex were measured by in vitro kinase assay using recombinant proteins. The assays were carried out by using recombinant proteins (Upstate Inc.) for Aurora A, CDK1/Cyclin B complex, CDK2/Cyclin E complex and CDK3/Cyclin E complex (respective cat. nos. 14-511, 14-450, 14-448 and 14-487), in accordance with the procedure described in the product instructions thereof. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC\n50 \nvalues) were calculated by assigning measured values in the case of not containing a test compound to an inhibition of 0%, and assigning measured values in the case of not containing a test compound and enzyme to an inhibition of 100%.\n\n\nIC\n50 \nvalues of compounds of the present invention for Aurora A are shown in Table 3, those for CDK1/Cyclin B complex are shown in Table 4, those for CDK2/Cyclin E complex are shown in Table 5, and those for CDK3/Cyclin E complex are shown in Table 6.\n\n\nCompounds of the present invention inhibited activities of Aurora A, CDK1/Cyclin B complex, CDK2/Cyclin E complex and CDK3/Cyclin E complex. On the basis of these results, compounds of the present invention are expected to inhibit proliferation of tumor cells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInhibitory

were carried out using colon carcinoma cell line SW620 (Cat. No. CCL-227), lung carcinoma cell line NCI-H460 (Cat. No. HTB-177), prostate cancer cell line DU 145 (Cat. No. HTB-81), breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 (Cat. No. HTB26) and leukemia cell line KG-1a (Cat. No. CCL-246.1) purchased from ATCC, pancreatic cancer cell line MIAPaCa-2 (Cat. No. CRL-1420) purchased from Dainippon Pharmaceutical, and ovarian cancer cell line IGROV1 received from the Netherland Cancer Institute. The cells were cultured under the conditions recommended by the supplier for each cell line, or with respect to IGROV1, according to the method described in Cancer Res. 59: 4559-4563, 1999. Cells suspended in media were added to solutions containing the test substances at various concentrations followed by culturing in a 5% CO\n2 \nincubator at 37° C. The numbers of cells were counted 4 days later with the Cell Counting Kit-8. IC\n50 \nvalues were calculated by assigning measured values in the case of not containing a test substance to an inhibition of 0%, and assigning measured values in the case of not containing a test substance or cells to an inhibition of 100%.\n\n\nThe IC\n50 \nvalues of compounds of the present invention against 7 kinds of the cell lines are shown in Tables 7 to 13.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nProliferation Inhibitory Activity Against SW620\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSynthesis\n\n\nSW620\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExample

cancer, pancreatic cancer and leukemia cell lines in vitro. On the basis of these results, compounds of the present invention are expected to demonstrate antitumor effects in vivo as well. In addition, compounds of the present invention are expected to serve as therapeutic agents for colon cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer and leukemia.\n\n\nPharmacology Test Example 4\n\n\nEvaluation of Antitumor Activity/Mouse Xenograft Model\n\n\nEvaluations were carried out using human prostate cancer cells DU145 (Cat. No. HTB-81) and human colon cancer cells SW620 (Cat. No. CCL-227) purchased from ATCC. The cells were maintained according to the conditions recommended by ATCC. Cultured cells were recovered by trypsin treatment and after suspending in Hanks solution, DU145 cells were transplanted subcutaneously into the right inguinal region of Balb/c nude mice (Japan Charles River) using males for DU145 and females for SW620. Test compounds (compounds of synthesis examples 35, 60, 99 and 126 for DU145 and compounds of synthesis examples 35 and 126 for SW620) administered orally using a gastric tube once a day for 14 days in the case of DU145 or 17 days in the case of SW620 starting when the mean tumor volume of each group reached 200 to 250 mm\n3\n. Tumor volumes were measured twice a week and on the day following the final administration. Tumor volume (TV) was determined using the following calculation formula from the main axis (A) and minor axis (B) of the tumor:\n\n\nTV=1/2\n×A×B×B \n\n\n\n(reference: Thomas Corbett et al., In Vivo Methods for Screening and Preclinical Testing, Anticancer Drug Development Guide, Humana Press, 1997: 75-99).\n\n\n\nAs shown in \nFIGS. 1 and 2\n, compounds of the present invention inhibit tumor proliferation by oral administration in a xenograft model of human prostate cancer cells DU145 and in a xenograft model of human colon cancer cells SW620. On the basis of these results, compounds of the present invention are expected to demonstrate antitumor effects as a result of oral administration in the clinical setting as well.\n\n\nINDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY\n\n\nSince compounds of the present invention demonstrate βARK-1 inhibitory activity, they can be used as preventive and therapeutic agents for heart failure, and are useful as pharmaceuticals. Moreover, since compounds of the present invention also have antitumor activity, and particularly dual inhibitory activity against Aurora kinase and CDK, they are also useful for cell proliferative diseases such as cancer."
