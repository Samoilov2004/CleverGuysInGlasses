Description\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to pyrazole derivatives having affinity for cannabinoidergic CB1 and/or CB2 receptors, to the corresponding solvates and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and to their pharmaceutical compositions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore specifically the present invention relates to pyrazole derivatives containing a hetrocyclic thiophene ring having affinity for cannabinoidergic CB1 and/or CB2 receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCannabinoids are compounds deriving from \nsativa Canna\nbis, commonly known as marijuana. Among the at least 66 cannabinoid compounds characterizing the marijuana, tetrahydrocannabinols (THC) and Δ\n9\n-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ\n9\n-THC) in particular, are considered as the most active. The properties which have indeed led to the use of marijuana as therapeutic agent of natural origin in mammalians and in men have been connected to the above compounds. Said properties are the following: the analgesic effect, the antiinflammatory activity, the reduction of the blood and intraocular pressure, the antihemetic activity. The negative effects which are associated to the marijuana use have furthermore been correlated to tetrahydrocannabinols, with particular reference to the psychological distortion of the perception, to the motor coordination loss, to the euphory, to the sedative effect. The cannabinoid pharmacological action appears directly correlated to their affinity towards two different classes of specific receptors belonging to the \"G protein-coupled\" receptor family: CB1 receptors, located in the central nervous system besides in the peripheral tissues, and CB2 receptors, identified in the cerebellum (\nQ.J.Lu et al.; Visual Neurosci.; 2000, 17,9 1-95\n) but which mainly find in the peripheral tissues (\nM.Glass; Progr. Neuro-Psychopharmacol. & Biol. Psychiat. ; 2001, 25, 743-765\n). In the brain, the CB1 receptors are largely expressed in the hipocampus, in the cortical regions, in the cerebellum and inside the basal ganglia. Among the peripheral tissues wherein the CB1 receptors have been located, we remember testicles, small intestine, bladder, deferent duct. The CB1 receptors have furthermore been identified in the rat eye and in the human eye, in the retina and in the iris and in the ciliary body (\nA. Porcella et al.; Molecular Brain Research; 1998, 58, 240-245\n; \nA. Porcella et al.; European Journal of Neuroscience; 2000, 12, 1123-1127\n). The CB2 receptors are instead mainly located in the marginal spleen zones, in tonsils, besides in several immune system cells, as macrophages, monocytes, cells of the bone marrow, of thymus and pancreas. Other immune system cells wherein the CB2 receptors are significantly present are the T4 and T8 cells, the polymorphonucleate leucocytes, in particular the cells called natural killers and lymphocytes B.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compunds capable to interact, as agonists or antagonists, with the CB2 receptors can therefore be used in the treatment of diseases wherein immune system cells or immune disorders are involved. The activation (modulation) of the CB2 receptors is also important in the treatment of other diseases, as for example in the osteoporosis, renal ischemia treatment and in inflammatory states.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds with affinity towards the CB1 receptors can be used in the treatment of eye-diseases as glaucoma, lung-diseases as asthma and chronic bronchitis, inflammations as for example arthritis, allergies and allergic reactions as for example allergic rhinitis, contact dermatitis, allergic conjunctivitis. Such compounds can also be used in the pain treatment, in anxiety cases, in mood problems, delirium states, psychotic afflictions in general, besides for schizophrenia, depression treatment and when abuse and/or dependency substances are used (for example alcoholism and tabagism). The same compounds can also be used to contrast vomit, nausea, giddiness, especially in case of patients submitted to chemotherapy; in the treatment of neuropathies, hemicrania, stress, diseases having a psychosomatic origin, epilepsy, Tourette syndrome, Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, Alzheimer disease, senile dementia, and in case of cognitive disease and memory loss.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther applications of the compounds having affinity towards CB1 receptors are the treatment of pathologies related to the appetite (obesity, bulimia), pathologies of the gastrointestinal tract and of the bladder, cardiovascular diseases, urinary and fertility problems, neuroinflammatory pathologies as for example multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, viral encephalitis. For example some CB1 agonist active principles are successfully used in the nausea and vomit treatment associated to the chemotherapy and in the appetite stimulation in AIDS' patients. Compounds with antagonist activity towards CB1 receptors can be used for example in the treatment of psychosis, anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, obesity, neurological diseases (for example dementia, Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, epilepsy, Tourette syndrome), in memory loss, in the pain treatment, in central nervous system disease involving the neurotransmission of cannabinoids, in the treatment of gastrointestinal and/or cardiovascular troubles.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn connection with the wide pharmacological cannabinoid applications, over the last years several studies have been started to find endocannabinoids and for the synthesis of new compounds capable to selectively interact towards the two subclasses of cannabinoidergic CB1 and CB2 receptors. The researches have led on the one hand to the identification of anandamide endocannabinoids (arachidonyl ethanolamide) and 2-arachidonyl glycerol, on the other hand to the obtainment of different classes of synthesis compounds, agonists or antagonists towards the CB1 or CB2 receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe class of the compounds having agonist activity towards the CB1 receptors (cannabimimetic activity) comprises synthesis compounds having a base structure directly derived from that of Δ\n9\n-THC, as -(-)-11-OH-Δ\n8\nTHC-dimethylheptyl (HU210) and nabilone, and compounds structurally different from Δ\n9\n-THC, as aminoalkylindols of the WIN 55,212-2 series (\nM. Pacheco et al.; J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther.; 1991, 257, 1701-183\n) or as bicyclic cannabinols (non classic cannabinoids) referring to the compound CP 55,940 (\nM. Glass; Progr. Neuro-Psychopharmacol. & Biol. Psychiat.; 2001, 25, 743-765\n). The compounds having cannabimimetic activity show in vivo the following effects: hypoactivity, hypothermia, analgesia and catalepsy (\nB.R. Martin et al.; Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav.; 1991, 40, 471-478\n; \nP.B. Smith et al.; J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther.; 1994, 270, 219-227\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother class of synthesis compounds which have shown themselves particularly similar and selective towards cannabinoidergic receptors is that of the 3-pyrazole carboxylic acid derivatives. The reference compound of this class of derivatives is commonly indicated with the abbreviation SR141716A: [\nN-\npiperidino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-diclorophenyl)-4-methyl pyrazol-3-carboxyamide], described in \n \nEP 0656354\n \n. In particular the SR141716A compound has shown the following properties: a high affinity for the CB1 receptors (\nK\ni=1.98±0.36 nM), a significant selectivity towards the CB1 receptors (affinity towards the CB1 receptors about a thousand times higher than that for the CB2 receptors), capability of inhibiting the cannabinoid activity, therefore antagonist activity, in samples in vivo and in vitro (\nM. Rinaldi-Carmona et al.; FEBS Lett.; 1994, 350, 240-244\n). On the basis of the properties pointed out, besides of several clinical and preclinical studies, the SR141716A compound, lately renamed by Sanofi-Synthélabo Rimonabant®, is designed to be mainly used as antihunger active principle in the obesity treatment as well as in the tabagism treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPatent application \n \nUS 2001/0053788\n \n describes 4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole compounds as potential antagonists of the CB1 receptors.

as above, can be made by utilizing the known methods used for said treatments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular the administration of the compounds must be carried out in a sufficiently effective amount for the specific treatment. Analogously the dosages, the administration route and the posology will be established depending on the disease typology, on the pathology seriousness, on the physical conditions and characteristics of the patient (for example age, weight, response to the active principle), on the pharmacokinetics and toxicology of the compounds of formula (I) selected for the specific treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe preferred daily dosage interval is 0.01-100 mg of compound of formula (I) of the invention per Kg of body weight of mammalian to be treated. In men, the preferred daily dosage interval is 0.1-1000 mg of compound per Kg of body weight, still more preferred from 1 to 200 mg.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA further object of the present invention is the use of compounds of formula (I), comprising the isomers and the corresponding mixtures, or of the corresponding hydrates or solvates or pharmaceutically acceptable salts, radiomarked, and of the respective pharmaceutical formulations, for the identification and marking of the cannabinoidergic CB1 or CB2 receptors in mammalians or in men.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore the compounds of formula (I) containing a hydroxyl group, comprising the isomers and the corresponding mixtures, or the corresponding hydrates or solvates or pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and the respective pharmaceutical formulations, can be used to obtain ligands, possibly detectable by immunochemical methods, to be used in the isolation, purification and characterization of the CB1 or CB2 receptors and in the identification of the corresponding active sites.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following Examples are given to better understand the present invention and are not anyway limitative thereof.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 1.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparation of the ethyl ester of the 5-(5-Chloro-thiophen-2-yl)-1-(2',4'-dichloro-phenyl)-4-methyl-1\nH\n-pyrazol-3-carboxylic acid\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n1.1a) Preparation of ethyl 4-(5-chloro-thiophen-2-yl)-3-methyl-2,4-dioxy-butyrate\n\n\n \n \n \nTo a solution of 5-chloro-2-propionyl-thiophene (5.72 mmol, 1 eq) in dimethylformamide (10 ml) sodium hydride is added in dispersion in mineral oil at 60% by weight (6.87 mmoles, 1,2 eq) at a temperature of about 10°C.

To evaluate the affinity of a determined compound towards a particular receptor, a particular preparation of the tissue wherein the receptors are present is used and the tested compound is made to compete with another compound, treated so as to make it radioactive and of which the affinity for the receptor is known. The capability of the tested compound to remove the radioactive compound gives an index of the affinity by which the compound binds itself to that determined receptor. The reading of the radioactivity present in the receptor-compound complex allows furthermore to precisely calculate the compound amount bound to the receptor. By this method it is therefore possible to rapidely identify the affinity of a new compound towards a specific receptor and thus to make predictions on its pharmacological activity. By repeating the same experimental scheme it is possible to evaluate the affinity of the compound towards other kinds of receptors and thus establish the specificity degree.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe receptorial binding technique, besides being used for the screening of new molecules having a pharmacological activity, can give useful information on possible changes at a receptorial level correlated for example to a prolonged exposure to drugs and/or to particular pathologies. As a matter of fact, in these situations, changes in the amount of the receptors present or structural changes can be pointed out which alter the agonist or antagonist affinity and consequently influence the normal function of the receptors themselves.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe experimentation was carried out according to the guide lines of the European Community for the animal experimentation (EEC No. 86/609), by employing laboratory animals (rats) housed in groups of twenty for cage, under standard stalling conditions (temperature 22±2°C, relative humidity 60%, artificial lighting with a 12 hour light-dark cycle). Food and water were available \nad libitum.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe procedure used, based on the employment of the compound [\n3\nH]-CP-55,940 (New England Nuclear, Boston, MA, USA), implies the utilization of rat brain as biological tissue for the evaluation of the affinity towards the CB1 receptors and of rat spleen for the affinity determination towards the CB2 receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, the brain in toto (cerebellum excluded) and the spleen were rapidely dissected and maintained in ice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe tissue was homogenized in 15 volumes (weight/volume) of TME buffer (50 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA e 3 mM MgCl\n2\n, pH 7.4) by an Ultra-Turrax and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1086 x g in a centrifuge cooled at 4°C. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 45,000 x g for 30 min at 4°C by using a Beckman SW41 rotor and the final pellet was resuspended in 50 volumes of TME.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe obtained membranes (50-80 µg of proteins) were incubated in the presence of 1 nM di [\n3\nH]-CP55, 940 for 1 h at 30°C in a final volume of 0.5 ml of TME buffer containing 5 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin (BSA). The non specific binding was measured in the presence of CP55,940 at the 1 µM concentration. All the experiments were carried out in polypropylene test tubes pretreated with Sigma-Cote (Sigma Chemical Co. Ltd., Poole, UK) to reduce the non specific binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the building of the competitive inhibition binding curves eight different concentrations of each compound were used. As reference compounds SR141716A for the CB1 receptors and SR144528 for the CB2 receptors were utilized.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIncubation was interrupted by addition of TME buffer (at 4°C) containing 5 mg/ml of BSA and filtration under vacuum through Whatman GFC filters pretreated with 0.5% of polyethylamine (PEI) and by using a filtering apparatus (Brandell, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). Filters were washed 3 times with 5 ml of Tris HCl buffer (pH 7.4, 4°C) containing 1 mg/ml of BSA and singly placed in plastic vials containing 4 ml of liquid for scintigraphy (Ultima Gold MV, Packard).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe radioactivity present in the filters was measured by a scintillator spectrophotometer (Tricarb 2100, Packard, Meridien, USA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe protein determination was carried out by the Bradford method by using the protocol and the reactants supplied by Bio-Rad (Milano, Italia).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe experiments were carried out in triplicate and the results confirmed in five independent experiments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe affinity of the compounds towards the CB1 and CB2 receptors was expressed in Ki terms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTable 4 shows the Ki values obtained with the compounds of the present invention, examined in the test in vitro. The affinity of the compounds of the present invention is compared with that relating to the reference compounds SR144528 and SR141716A (Rimonobant®).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Table shows that the compounds of the present invention have activity on the CB1 and/or CB2 receptors comparable with that of the prior art compounds active on said receptors.\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHypothermia tests in vivo\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAs said, the compounds having cannabimimetic activity show in vivo the following effects: hypoactivity, hypothermia, analgesia and catalepsy (\nB.R.Martin et al., Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav.; 1991, 40, 471-478\n; \nP.B. Smith et al.; J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther.; 1994, 270, 219-227\n). To be able to exert the thermoregulation function, the compounds having activity towards the cannabinoidergic receptors must be capable to pass the hemato-encephalic barrier, the central site of said receptors regulating the temperature being positioned in the preoptical front nucleus of the hypothalamus (\nS.M. Rawls et al.; J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther.; 2002, 303, 395-402\n). Following treatments with CB1 agonist compounds capable to pass the hemato-encephalic barrier, the cannabimimetic activity pointed out itself by the registration of a reduction of the body temperature. In the case of CB1 antagonist compounds capable to pass the hemato-encephalic barrier, the treatment with said compounds does not imply any body temperature variation, however it implies an antagonist activity towards reference CB1 agonists as WIN 55,212-2, thus contrasting the hypothermia induced by the latter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo evaluate the activity in vivo of the compounds of general formula (I), tests were therefore carried out to evaluate the hypothermia induced as a result of treatments carried out with said compounds. Tests were carried out in the experiment animal (rat) according to the work indications by \nM.Rinaldi-Carmona et al. in FEBS Letters; 1994, 350, 240-244\n. The rectal temperature in the rat was determined by an electronic thermometer inserted at a 2 mm depth. The measurements were carried out on rats acclimated for one hour. The rectal temperature was determined before and after (from 30 to 120 minutes) the i.p. administration of the compound to be tested.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen no temperature reduction following the administration of the compound to be tested was pointed out, it was evaluated the antagonist activity of the same towards a reference CB1 agonist compound as WIN 55,212-2. For this purpose the rectal temperature measurements were carried out upon i.p. administration of the compound to be tested 30 minutes before the WIN 55,212-2 administration. The compounds capable to pass the hemato-encephalic barrier and to antagonise the CB1 agonist activity of WIN 55,212-2 are indeed capable to contrast the temperature reduction induced by the reference agonist.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach test was repeated on ten animals; the reported results are the average of the results obtained with the ten animals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Examples reported hereinafter show that the invention compounds (I) (Examples 5.1 and 5.2), having affinity towards the CB1 receptors as it has been shown in the tests in vitro of the Examples 4, are able to pass the hemato-encephalic barrier. In particular the compounds of formula (I) of the Examples 5.1 and 5.2, not having as such any effect on the body temperature, but being able to contrast the temperature reduction induced by WIN 55,212-2, are CB1 antagonists.\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 5.1\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe test was carried out with the compound of the Example 3.1c. Aqueous samples were used wherein the compound of the Example 3.1c was dispersed in water with three drops of Tween 80. Following the above procedure, treatments were carried out with doses (mg compound/kg of body weight) respectively of 0.1; 0.5; 1.0; 3.0; 6.0.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn none of the examined cases there was a reduction of the body temperature in the treated rats with respect to the physiological solution administration (38°C).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the case of the evaluation of the antagonist activity towards WIN 55,212-2 (3 mg compound/kg of body weight), substantial variations of the body temperature were instead pointed out with respect to the treatment with the only WIN 55,212-2. In particular the compound of the Example 3.1b was able to antagonize the effect of WIN 55,212-2 (CB1 agonist), contrasting the effect of the reduction of the body temperature induced by the CB1 agonist administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound of the Example 3.1b is thus capable to pass the hemato-encephalic barrier and shows a CB1 antagonist behaviour.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe temperatures detected during the experiment, from the zero time (i.p. administration of the CB1 agonist WIN 55,212-2)) up to 120 min are reported in Table 5.\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 5.2\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe Example 5.1 was repeated but with the compound of the Example 3.1d instead of that of the Example 3.1b.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs in case of the compound of the Example 3.1b, also the compound of the Example 3.1d does not cause as such any effect on the body temperature. Said compound is able to pass the hemato-encephalic barrier antagonizing the effect of the CB1 agonist WIN 55,212-2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWith none of the doses employed a reduction of the body temperature in the treated rats was indeed noticed. In the case of the evaluation of the antagonist activity towards WIN 55,212-2 (3 mg compound/kg of body weight), substantial variations of the body temperature were instead pointed out with respect to the treatment with the only WIN 55,212-2. In particular the compound of the Example 3.1d was able to antagonize the effect of WIN 55,212-2 (CB1 agonist), contrasting the effect of the reduction of the body temperature induced by the CB1 agonist administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe temperatures detected during th experiment, from zero time (i.p. administration of the CB1 agonist WIN 55,212-2) up to 120 min are reported in Table 6.\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntestinal motility tests\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTo further evaluate the activity in vivo of the compounds (I) object of the present invention, functional tests were carried out to evaluate the effect of said compounds on the rat intestinal motility. It was indeed shown the involvement of the cannabinoidergic CB1 receptors in the intestinal motility regulation in rat (\nR.G. Pertwee et al; Br. J. Pharmacol. ; 1996, 118, 2199-2205\n). In particular, the CB1 receptor agonists slacken the gastrointestinal motility; antagonist compounds of the same receptors have instead a prokinetic effect on the gastrointestinal transit (\nG. Colombo et al.; Eur. J. Pharmacol.; 1998, 344, 67-69\n; \nM.A. Casu et al.; Eur. J. Pharmacol.; 2003, 459, 97-105\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe evaluation of the constipating or prokinetic effect of the compounds was carried out by the \nUpper Gut Transit Test\n method on the basis of the procedure defined and ratified by \nY. Nagakura et al.; Eur. J. Pharmacol.; 1996, 311, 67-72\n. The method, which allows to measure the motility of the stomach and of the first intestine tract (small or little intestine), implies:\n\n \n \n \nthe administration of the compound to be tested by i.p. route;\n \nthe administration of carmine red (\nmarker\n not directly absorbable from the stomach) by intragastric route through a metal probe, after 20 minutes from the administration of the compound to be tested;\n \nthe rat sacrifice by cervical dislocation after a prefixed time (30 minutes) starting from the administration time;\n \nthe intestine explant from pylorus to the ileo-cecal valve;\n \nthe determination of the intestinal part crossed by the \nmarker;\n \n \nthe data processing to determine the percentage of crossed part with respect to the total lenght of the small intestine.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nWith respect to the control (physiological solution or carrier wherein the compounds to be tested were solubilized or dispersed), the administration of CB1 agonist compounds implies a reduction of the intestinal transit percentage; an opposite effect is noticed in case of antagonist compounds. The latter are therefore capable to cancel the constipating effect of CB1 agonist compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach test was repeated on ten animals; the results reported in the Examples are the average of the results obtained with ten animals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Examples reported hereinafter show that the invention compounds (I) are active on the gastrointestinal tract. In particular the compounds of the Examples 3.1b and 3.1d increase the intestinal transit rate and are capable to antagonize the effect of a CB1 agonist as the compound WIN 55,212-2, implying a prokinetic effect on the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 6.1\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe test was carried out with the compound of the Example 3.1b; aqueous samples were in particular used wherein the compound 3.1b was dispersed in water with three drops of Tween 80. According to the above procedure, with treatments respectively equal to 0.5 and 1.0 mg of compound/kg of body weight, the \nmarker\n has run on an average an intestinal portion equal to, respectively, 1.57 and 1.76 times the length run from the \nmarker\n in the intestine following the administration of a physiological solution containing the same amount of Tween 80.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe prokinetic effect of the compound of the Example 3.1b was evaluated also towards the constipating action of the CB1 agonist compound WIN 55,212-2. The treatment of rats with aqueous samples of WIN 55,212-2 with concentrations equal to 0.5 mg of compound/kg of body weight, has implied a covering of the intestinal transit from the \nmarker\n equal to 0.16 times the length run from the \nmarker\n in the intestine following the administration of a physiological solution containing the same above indicated amount of Tween 80. In the case of similar treatment with WIN 55,212-2 preceded by the administration of an aqueous sample of the compound of the Example 3.1b with concentration equal to 1.0 mg of compound/kg of body weight, the \nmarker\n has instead run, on an average, the same length run in the intestine following the administration of a physiological solution containing the same amount of Tween 80. The compound of the Example 3.1b, under the above conditions, was therefore capable to antagonize the constipating effect of the CB1 agonist WIN 55,212-2.\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 6.2\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe Example 6.1 was repeated but by using the compound of formula (I) of the Example 3.1d at the place of the compound of the Example 3.1b. With treatments respectively equal to 0.5 and 1.0 mg of compound/kg of body weight, the \nmarker\n has run on an average an intestinal portion respectively equal to 1.61 and to 1.74 times the length run by the \nmarker\n in the intestine following the administration of a physiological solution containing the same amount of Tween 80.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn this case also the prokinetic effect of the compound of the Example 3.1d was evaluated towards the constipating action of the CB1 agonist compound WIN 55,212-2. The rat treatment with aqueous samples of WIN 55,212-2 with concentrations equal to 0.5 mg of compound/kg of body weight, has implied a covering of the intestinal transit from the \nmarker\n equal to 0.16 times the length covered by the \nmarker\n in the intestine following the administration of a physiological solution containing the same above indicated amount of Tween 80. In case of similar treatment with WIN 55,212-2 preceded by the administration of an aqueous sample of the compound of the Example 3.1d with concentration equal to 0.5 mg of compound/kg of body weight, the \nmarker\n has instead run on an average the same length run in the intestine following the administration of a physiological solution containing the same amount of Tween 80. The compound of the Example 3.1d was thus able, under the above conditions, to antagonize the constipating effect of the CB1 agonist WIN 55,212-2.\n\n \nTABLE 4\n \n \n \nExample 4: activity in vitro of the invention compounds on the CB1 and CB2 receptors, compared with that of the reference compounds SR144528 and SR141716A\n \n \n \nCompound (Ex.)\n \nCB1 (brain) Ki (nM)\n \nCB2 (spleen) Ki (nM)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3.1b\n \n35.0±2.5\n \n476.0±3.0\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3.1c\n \n21.0±1.0\n \n270.0±5.0\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3.1d\n \n63.0±7.2\n \n699.0±21.0\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSR144528 (comp)\n \n70±10\n \n0.28±0.04\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSR141716A(comp)\n \n1.8±0.075\n \n514±30\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \nTABLE 5\n \n \n \nPharmacological Example 5.1: trend of the body temperature after administration in rat (10 animals) of WIN 55,212-2 as such or in combination with the compound of the Example 3.1b in the doses indicated in the Table.
