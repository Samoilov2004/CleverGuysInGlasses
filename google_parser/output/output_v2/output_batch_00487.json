No. 61/201,159, filed on Dec. 8, 2008; and provisional patent application, Ser. No. 61/277,279, filed on Sep. 23, 2009. The disclosure of both of these documents is hereby incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to glycosylated peptides with high affinity for the delta opioid receptors. The peptides, and compositions comprising them, are useful for treatment of pain, including nociceptive, inflammatory, neuropathic and bone and osteoporosis pain.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThroughout the history of human medicine, various compounds have been used for the relief of pain. In particular, a class of compounds of plant origin known as opiates has been used since prehistoric periods for analgesic and euphoric purposes. Even today the opiate drug morphine is used as an analgesic for significant pain, and morphine is still an important benchmark for clinical studies: Morphine is the most widely prescribed injectable opioid today, despite its narcotic side effects. The opioid derivative hydrocodone is the most commonly prescribed drug in the United States. Acute opioid toxicity from overdose can result in respiratory depression and death, whereas chronic use can lead to physical dependence, addiction, and severe opioid-induced bowel dysfunction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDespite significant side effects, opioids are the first choice for the treatment of moderate to severe pain (including inflammatory), both acute and chronic. Current analgesics, including morphine, fentanyl, oxycodone and hydrocodone act primarily at muopioid receptors (MOR). Activation of this receptor subtype is responsible for many of the side effects associated with these drugs, such as respiratory depression, constipation, addiction, dependence, and immunosuppression. These side effects limit the use of morphine and other opioids to treat both acute and chronic pain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCurrently available opioid drugs are the primary choice for the treatment of moderate to severe pain and account for over 180 million prescriptions annually in the United States. Representative opioid drugs in this list include hydrocodone, oxycodone, oxymorphone, codeine, methadone and morphine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe majority of clinically available opioids act almost exclusively at the MOR. Agonism of the MOR mediates not only the analgesic actions of this class of drugs, but also many of the side effects of opioids including respiratory depression, constipation, addiction liability, tolerance/physical dependence and immunosuppression. These side effects significantly limit the usefulness of opioid analgesics, especially in cases of non-malignant chronic pain. An additional constraint in the reliance upon MOR selective analgesics is their limited efficacy in certain inflammatory and neuropathic pain states, requiring dose escalations that further increase compound side effects. These shortcomings drive the sustained efforts to develop novel analgesics that have equivalent or better efficacy compared to conventional opioids for a variety of pain states, while limiting the side effect potential.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEndogenous opioid peptides synthesized by vertebrates in general, and mammals in particular, bind to the same receptors as the exogenous opioid molecules including morphine. The endogenous peptides are known by the generic terms endorphins, and endorphins have been subject of much discussion and research since their discovery in the 1970s. These endogenous opioids are believed to be the natural source of various euphoric experiences reported by people, including the “limner's high” and the feelings experienced by some after eating chocolate. Although the evidence about these experiences is to a large degree subjective, there is no question that endogenous opioid peptides play a critical role in the various sensory emotional motivational and cognitive functions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA related class of endogenous opioids has been isolated from amphibian skin extracts and are known as the deltorphins. Deltorphins are small peptides that display high specificity. There are both natural and synthetic deltorphins Deltorphins are well known to actively engage the opioid receptors and can produce strong analgesic effects when delivered to the brain or spinal cord. However, the use of endorphins in general, and deltorphins in particular, has not moved from the theoretical to the therapeutic reality, in large part based on difficulties in their administration and stability, and an inability to deliver the molecules across the blood brain barrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDelta Opioid Receptors (DOR) were first described in 1977 (Lord et al., 1977) and subsequently, several classes of peptide and non-peptide based molecules have been synthesized that selectively stimulate this receptor. Selective DOR molecules include the modified enkephalin analog, DPDPE (Mosberg et al., 1983), deltorphin-based peptides (Kreil et al., 1989) and analogs of BW373U86 (e.g., SNC80; Bilsky et al., 1994; Calderon et al., 1994; 2004). Preclinical efficacy studies of these compounds, along with DOR-selective antagonists, provide a convincing rationale for pursuing DOR agonists as analgesic agents. In addition, DOR knockout mice exhibit increased pain behaviors following an inflammatory or neuropathic-based insult (Gavériaux-Ruff et al., 2008; Nadal et al., 2006). Interestingly, upregulation and altered trafficking of DOR occurs following induction of various pain states in rodents (Cahill et al., 2003; 2007; Walwyn et al., 2005). DOR selective compounds also have significantly reduced the tumor burden in multiple animal models.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere is a critical need for improved opioids with high efficacy, but without the severe side effects associated with currently available therapies. Accordingly, the present invention addresses this need by using novel synthetic chemistry to generate novel compounds that have improved pharmacological properties for targeting DOR.\n\n\n \nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides novel peptides with high affinity for the delta opioid receptor (DOR), and methods for preparing and using these peptides for the treatment of conditions that involve pain, such as acute and chronic pain including inflammatory and neuropathic pain states. The invention also provides methods for delivering analgesia or relief from pain to an individual by administering to the bloodstream an effective amount of an analgesic molecule, which is a glycosylated peptide. In certain aspects, the invention comprises method of treatment of pain due to cancer. The invention also provides methods for the treatment and prevention or amelioration of neurological conditions, such as Parkinson's Disease, Alzheimer's Disease, Pick's Disease, and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, and treatment of emotional or mood disorders. In certain embodiments, the glycosylated peptides of the present invention comprise glycosylated variants of deltorphins, or closely related peptides. The glycosylated peptides of the present invention are typically between six and twelve amino acids in length, more preferably between seven and ten amino acids in length. In certain embodiments, the peptide is glycosylated with a sugar moiety selected from a monosaccharide, disaccharide or trisaccharide sugar moiety. In certain embodiments, the peptides have low affinity for one or more opioid receptors other than the DOR, such as the kappa opioid receptor (KOR) or the mu opioid receptor (MOR), or both.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the glycosylated peptides of the present invention are formulated into compositions, which compositions may be used for the treatment of neurological conditions, including conditions that involve pain, such as acute and chronic pain including inflammatory and neuropathic pain states.

The novel glycopeptides comprise a basic deltorphin scaffold, with variations in certain amino acid residues, as well as variations of saccharide moieties attached at certain amino acid residues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlycopeptides are synthesized and screened for in vitro binding, selectivity and activity at opioid receptors. High affinity (Ki<10 nM), DOR-selective compounds are identified and tested in vivo in an acute pain model and further tested in a sub-acute inflammatory pain model, both of which are sensitive to DOR agonists. These compounds will be tested upon multiple models of analgesia, including the treatment of chronic inflammatory pain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ability to synthesize glycosylated peptides is utilized to develop deltorphin-based peptides to develop novel, safe and efficacious targeted delivery of compounds for the treatment of pain and other diseases (e.g.: cancer, and inflammation). Glycosylation of the deltorphin scaffold will enhance the efficacy of this family of DOR agonists. Current data indicate that these compounds are particularly efficacious in chronic inflammatory and neuropathic pain states. This invention further comprises methods for synthesizing a library of deltorphin-based glycopeptides and obtain dosing and efficacy data in preclinical rodent models of acute and sub-acute pain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is expected that the effective doses will not be associated with traditional MOR-mediated side effects. In the unlikely event that intolerable side effects are present, then that information will be used to help guide further refinement of the synthesis of deltorphin-based glycopeptides, or alternatively, another DOR-selective scaffold. In the event that minimal activity is observed in the assay, an alternative acute/sub-acute antinociceptive assay will be employed (e.g., carrageenan) to assess potency and efficacy. The milestone will consist of the identification of a compound with antinociceptive activity and no significant gross observable side effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe abuse potential and physical dependence liability of opioid analgesics is another important area in which compounds that act at both DOR and MOR may have significant advantages.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDOR-selective agonists display potent and fully effective antinociception in a variety of pain models and different species, and many groups have pursued the DOR as a target for the treatment of chronic pain (Aceto et al., 2007; Dolle et al., 2007). Fraser and colleagues demonstrated that deltorphin II and SNC80 both produced dose-related reversal of hyperalgesia associated with CFA-induced paw inflammation (Fraser et al., 2000). DOR agonists have also produced efficacy in neuropathic and bone cancer models of pain (Brainin-Mattos et al., 2006; Holdridge & Cahill, 2007; Mika et al., 2001). ADL5859, a selective DOR agonist currently in clinical trials, was shown to be active in preclinical inflammatory and neuropathic pain models (Adolor Corp. website: www.adolor.com).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to providing analgesia, DOR agonists display fewer side effects than equivalent doses of traditional MOR agonists. Cheng and colleagues (1993) demonstrated that a deltorphin-based peptide could stimulate (rather than depress) respiration in a fetal sheep model. Extending this finding, DOR agonists were shown to reverse MOR agonist-induced respiratory depression in rats without decreasing alfentanil antinociception (Su et al., 1998). In a comparison study of morphine and SNC80, Gallantine and Meert (2005) concluded that SNC80 did not induce muscle rigidity, or block pinna and cornea reflexes, indicating the lack of MOR-mediated effects. SNC80 produced less pronounced effects on GI transit and there was also a larger separation between rotorod performance impairment and antinociception with SNC80 compared to morphine, a result that is consistent with findings using DPDPE (Franck et al., 1991).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInterestingly, DOR agonists have also been reported to reverse MOR agonist-induced rigidity (Vankova et al. 1996), a side effect that contributes to respiratory depression. In rhesus monkeys, SNC80 did not support self-administration indicating low abuse potential for the compound (Stevenson et al., 2005). There is also evidence that DOR agonists have antidepressant properties (Jutkiewicz, 2006; Torregrossa et al., 2006), a highly desirable effect given the high incidence of depression in chronic pain patients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCollectively, the preclinical pharmacology of DOR agonists supports targeted drug development efforts and several pharmaceutical companies have active programs in place. The most advanced DOR selective agonist, ADL5859 (Adolor Corp.), is currently in Phase IIa clinical trials for pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Phase I studies indicated that the compound was orally bioavailable and well-tolerated in humans. In November 2007, Adolor announced an exclusive, world-wide collaboration with Pfizer, Inc. to develop and commercialize their DOR compounds, including ADL5859 (see: www.adolor.com).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTargeted Glycosylation of Opioid Peptides. Glycosylation of proteins has significant effects on the stability and activity of protein therapeutics (Solá et al., 2007). The inventors and others have shown that glycosylation is a viable strategy for improving stability and tissue-targeted delivery of peptides (Polt et al., 1994, 2005; Susaki et al., 1999). The inventors' work initially focused on endogenous enkephalins (leucine and methionine) due to their potent analgesic effects, roughly equal affinity for DOR and MOR, and clinical studies demonstrating analgesic efficacy in morphine-tolerant cancer patients (Onofrio & Yaksh, 1983; Moulin et al., 1985). Although poor PK limited further development of the native enkephalin peptides, and initial research confirmed the hypothesis that glycosylation of this scaffold could improve stability and CNS bioavailability in preclinical models.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe opioid receptors are all GPCRs and have been effectively modeled using X-ray coordinates of other GPCRs, followed by in silico replacement of individual amino acids to obtain an accurate representation of the receptors for use in docking calculations (receptor homology modeling). This approach has been used to choose the peptide sequences and optimal sites for glycosylation and is an important component in the CarboSyn™ process. Most of the starting opioid peptide sequences have been validated by in vitro binding studies of enkephalin, deltorphin, dynorphin and endorphin peptides (Strange, 2008). Deltorphin C (deltorphin II) belongs to a family of heptapeptides isolated from skin extracts of frogs belonging to the genus \nPhyllomedusa. \nBBI has expanded its validated peptide modification algorithm and is using it to build a new library derived from the deltorphin family of peptides. Deltorphins have an almost thousand fold increase in binding preference for human DOR vs. MOR (Tancredi et al., 1991; Tomatis et al., 1997). However, limited ability of the native deltorphin peptide to cross the blood-brain barrier has prevented advancement to the clinic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInitial studies of a deltorphin peptide modified through glycosylation at the seventh residue indicated increased antinociceptive potency (4 fold greater than the initial peptide) when administered subcutaneously (sc). These data provide additional validation of glycosylation as a tool to increase the PK and efficacy of native peptides. Additional studies are planned to confirm the hypothesis that specific sugars enhance CNS delivery (and targeted CNS exclusion) of synthetic, modified glycopeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe endogenous peptide family, deltorphins, is proven to be highly delta-opioid receptor (DOR) selective. It is hypothesized that increasing the DOR selectivity of glycopeptides further enhances antinociceptive efficacy, while reducing or avoiding the side effects typically seen with MOR-selective analgesics. Thus, the novel class of compounds produced herein represent a promising new class of drugs for use in addressing the unmet needs in chronic pain, namely improved efficacy and reduced side effect liability with long-term dosing.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDELTORPHIN PEPTIDE SEQUENCES\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n2 [dX]\n\n\n3*\n\n\n4\n\n\n5\n\n\n6*\n\n\n7*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeltorphin A\n\n\nY\n\n\ndMet\n\n\nF\n\n\nH\n\n\nL\n\n\nM\n\n\nAsp-NH2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeltorphin B\n\n\nY\n\n\ndA\n\n\nF\n\n\nE\n\n\nV\n\n\nV\n\n\nGly-NH2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeltorphin C\n\n\nY\n\n\ndA\n\n\nF\n\n\nD\n\n\nV\n\n\nV\n\n\nGly-NH2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention includes the synthesis and purification of the novel deltorphin-related glycopeptides described in Tables 2, 3 and 4:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOVEL VARIANT/GLYCOSYLATED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDELTORPHINS PEPTIDE SEQUENCES\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n3*\n\n\n4\n\n\n5\n\n\n6*\n\n\n7*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCONSENSUS\n\n\nY\n\n\ndA\n\n\nF\n\n\nH\n\n\nL\n\n\nM\n\n\nD-NH2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\ndM\n\n\n \n\n\nE\n\n\nV\n\n\nV\n\n\nG-NH2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\ndV\n\n\n \n\n\nD\n\n\nI\n\n\nI\n\n\nN-NH2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nQ\n\n\nC\n\n\nD\n\n\nS-NH2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nF\n\n\nY\n\n\nL\n\n\nA-NH2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nA\n\n\nC\n\n\nK-NH2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNva\n\n\nP\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNle\n\n\nH\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nA\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nT\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNva\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n*-Site for potential glycosylation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOVEL VARIANT/GLYCOSYLATED\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDELTORPHIN A PEPTIDE \nSEQUENCES\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeltorphin A\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n1\n\n\n2 [dX]\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n5\n\n\n6\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeltorphin A1\n\n\nY\n\n\ndMet\n\n\nF\n\n\nH\n\n\nL\n\n\nM\n\n\nSer(beta-D-Glc)-NH2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeltorphin A2\n\n\nY\n\n\ndAla\n\n\nF\n\n\nH\n\n\nL\n\n\nA\n\n\nSer(beta-D-Glc)-NH2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeltorphin A3\n\n\nY\n\n\ndMet\n\n\nF\n\n\nH\n\n\nL\n\n\nM\n\n\nThr(beta-D-Glc)-NH2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeltorphin A4\n\n\nY\n\n\ndAla\n\n\nF\n\n\nH\n\n\nL\n\n\nA\n\n\nThr(beta-D-Glc)-NH2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeltorphin A5\n\n\nY\n\n\ndMet\n\n\nF\n\n\nH\n\n\nL\n\n\nM\n\n\ndSer(beta-D-Glc)-NH2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeltorphin A6\n\n\nY\n\n\ndAla\n\n\nF\n\n\nH\n\n\nL\n\n\nA\n\n\ndSer(beta-D-Glc)-NH2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOVEL VARIANT/GLYCOSYLATED\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDELTORPHIN B PEPTIDE \nSEQUENCES\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeltorphin B\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n1\n\n\n2 [dX]\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n5\n\n\n6\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeltorphin B1\n\n\nY\n\n\ndAla\n\n\nF\n\n\nE\n\n\nNva\n\n\nNva\n\n\nSer(beta-D-Glc)-NH2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeltorphin B2\n\n\nY\n\n\ndAla\n\n\nF\n\n\nE\n\n\nNle\n\n\nNle\n\n\nSer(beta-D-Glc)-NH2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeltorphin B3\n\n\nY\n\n\ndAla\n\n\nF\n\n\nE\n\n\nNva\n\n\nNva\n\n\nThr(beta-D-Glc)-NH2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeltorphin B4\n\n\nY\n\n\ndAla\n\n\nF\n\n\nE\n\n\nNle\n\n\nNle\n\n\nThr(beta-D-Glc)-NH2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeltorphin B5\n\n\nY\n\n\ndAla\n\n\nF\n\n\nE\n\n\nNva\n\n\nNva\n\n\ndSer(beta-D-Glc)-NH2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeltorphin B6\n\n\nY\n\n\ndAla\n\n\nF\n\n\nE\n\n\nNle\n\n\nNle\n\n\ndSer(beta-D-Glc)-NH2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional Compounds.

Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sixteenth Edition, E. W. Martin (Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1980) discloses various carriers used in formulating pharmaceutically acceptable compositions and known techniques for the preparation thereof. Except insofar as any conventional carrier medium is incompatible with the compounds of the invention, such as by producing any undesirable biological effect or otherwise interacting in a deleterious manner with any other component(s) of the pharmaceutically acceptable composition, its use is contemplated to be within the scope of this invention. Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include, but are not limited to, ion exchangers, alumina, aluminum stearate, lecithin, serum proteins, such as human serum albumin, buffer substances such as phosphates, glycine, sorbic acid, or potassium sorbate, partial glyceride mixtures of saturated vegetable fatty acids, water, salts or electrolytes, such as protamine sulfate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, potassium hydrogen phosphate, sodium chloride, zinc salts, colloidal silica, magnesium trisilicate, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyacrylates, waxes, polyethylene-polyoxypropylene-block polymers, wool fat, sugars; starches; cellulose and its derivatives; powdered tragacanth; malt; gelatin; talc; excipients such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; oils such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil; safflower oil; sesame oil; olive oil; corn oil and soybean oil; glycols; such a propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol; esters such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; agar; buffering agents such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; alginic acid; pyrogen-free water; isotonic saline; Ringer's solution; ethyl alcohol, and phosphate buffer solutions, as well as other non-toxic compatible lubricants such as sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate, as well as coloring agents, releasing agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the composition, according to the judgment of the formulator.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutically acceptable excipients which may be used in the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions also include, but are not limited to, inert diluents, dispersing and/or granulating agents, surface active agents and/or emulsifiers, disintegrating agents, binding agents, preservatives (e.g., antioxidants, chelating agents, antimicrobial preservatives, antifungal preservatives, alcohol preservatives, acidic preservatives, and the like), buffering agents, lubricating agents, and/or oils. Such excipients may optionally be included in the inventive formulations. Excipients such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes, coloring agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents can be present in the composition, according to the judgment of the formulator.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the composition further comprises one or more sugars. The term “sugar” as used herein refers to a natural or an unnatural monosaccharide, disaccharide, oligosaccharide, or polysaccharide, comprising one or more triose, tetrose, pentose, hexose, heptose, octose, or nonose saccharides. Sugars may include substances derived from saccharides by reduction of the carbonyl group (alditols), by oxidation of one or more terminal groups to carboxylic acids (aldonic acids), or by replacement of one or more hydroxyl group(s) by a hydrogen (deoxy sugars), an amino group (amino sugars), a thiol group (thio sugars), an acylamino group, a sulfate group, a phosphate group, or similar heteroatomic group; or any combination of the foregoing modifications. The term sugar also includes derivatives of these compounds (i.e., sugars that have been chemically modified by acylation, alkylation, and formation of glycosidic bonds by reaction of sugar alcohols with aldehydes or ketones, etc.). Sugars may be present in cyclic (oxiroses, oxetosesm furanoses, pyranoses, septanoses, octanoses, etc.) form as hemiacetals, hemiketals, or lactones; or in acyclic form. The saccharides may be ketoses, aldoses, polyols and/or a mixture of ketoses, aldoses and polyols.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary sugars include, but are not limited to glycerol, polyvinylalcohol, propylene glycol, sorbitol, ribose, arabinose, xylose, lyxose, allose, altrose, mannose, mannitol, gulose, dextrose, idose, galactose, talose, glucose, fructose, dextrates, lactose, sucrose, starches (i.e., amylase and amylopectin), sodium starch glycolate, cellulose and cellulose derivatives (i.e., methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxyethylmethyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, cellulose acetate phthalate, croscarmellose, hypomellose, and hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose), carrageenan, cyclodextrins (e.g., hydroxypropyl-gamma-CD), dextrin, polydextrose, and trehalose.

In some embodiments, the excipient is approved for use in humans and for veterinary use. In some embodiments, the excipient is approved by United States Food and Drug Administration. In some embodiments, the excipient is pharmaceutical grade. In some embodiments, the excipient meets the standards of the United States Pharmacopoeia (USP), the European Pharmacopoeia (EP), the British Pharmacopoeia, and/or the International Pharmacopoeia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe formulations of the pharmaceutical compositions described herein may be prepared by any method known or hereafter developed in the art of pharmacology. In general, such preparatory methods include the step of bringing the active ingredient (i.e., a glycosylated deltorphin variant) into association with a carrier and/or one or more other accessory ingredients, and then, if necessary and/or desirable, shaping and/or packaging the product into a desired single- or multi-dose unit.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA pharmaceutical composition of the invention may be prepared, packaged, and/or sold in bulk, as a single unit dose, and/or as a plurality of single unit doses. As used herein, a “unit dose” is discrete amount of the pharmaceutical composition comprising a predetermined amount of the active ingredient. The amount of the active ingredient is generally equal to the dosage of the active ingredient which would be administered to a subject and/or a convenient fraction of such a dosage such as, for example, one-half or one-third of such a dosage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe relative amounts of the active ingredient, the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and/or any additional ingredients in a pharmaceutical composition of the invention will vary, depending upon the identity, size, and/or condition of the subject treated and further depending upon the route by which the composition is to be administered. By way of example, the composition may comprise between 0.1% and 100% (w/w) of the active ingredient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred dosage forms include oral and parenteral dosage forms. Liquid dosage forms for oral and parenteral administration include, but are not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active ingredients, the liquid dosage forms may comprise inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethylformamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents. In certain embodiments for parenteral administration, the conjugates of the invention are mixed with solubilizing agents such as Cremophor, alcohols, oils, modified oils, glycols, polysorbates, cyclodextrins, polymers, and combinations thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInjectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may be a sterile injectable solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P. and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid are used in the preparation of injectables.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium prior to use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is often desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions for rectal or vaginal administration are typically suppositories which can be prepared by mixing the conjugates of this invention with suitable non-irritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are solid at ambient temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active ingredient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions for oral administration are typically liquid or in solid dosage forms. Compositions for oral administration may include protease inhibitors, including organic acids such as citric acid, in order to inhibit pancreatic and brush border proteases, Compositions for oral administration may additionally include absorption enhancers, such as acylcarnitine and lauroylcarnitine, to facilitate the uptake of the peptide through the lumen of the intestine into the systemic circulation by a paracellular transport mechanism. Compositions for oral administration may additionally include detergents to improve the solubility of the peptides and excipients and to decrease interactions with intestinal mucus. Solid form compositions for oral administration, such as tablets or capsules, may typically comprise an enteric coating which further protects the peptides from stomach proteases and permits passage of the tablet or capsule into the small intestine. The solid form composition may additionally comprise a subcoat such as a non-ionic polymer. Examples of preparation of such orally available formulations are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,912,014, U.S. Pat. No. 6,086,918 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,673,574. The disclosure of each of these documents is hereby incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active ingredient is mixed with at least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate and/or a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and silicic acid, b) binders such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidinone, sucrose, and acacia, c) humectants such as glycerol, d) disintegrating agents such as agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate, e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin, f) absorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds, g) wetting agents such as, for example, cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate, h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay, and i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form may comprise buffering agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolid compositions of a similar type may be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally comprise opacifying agents and can be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. Solid compositions of a similar type may be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polethylene glycols and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe active ingredients can be in micro-encapsulated form with one or more excipients as noted above. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings, release controlling coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. In such solid dosage forms the active ingredient may be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as sucrose, lactose or starch. Such dosage forms may comprise, as is normal practice, additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g., tableting lubricants and other tableting aids such a magnesium stearate and microcrystalline cellulose. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage forms may comprise buffering agents. They may optionally comprise opacifying agents and can be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDosage forms for topical and/or transdermal administration of a compound of this invention may include ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, powders, solutions, sprays, inhalants and/or patches. Generally, the active ingredient is admixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or any needed preservatives and/or buffers as may be required. Additionally, the present invention contemplates the use of transdermal patches, which often have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of an active ingredient to the body. Such dosage forms may be prepared, for example, by dissolving and/or dispensing the active ingredient in the proper medium. Alternatively or additionally, the rate may be controlled by either providing a rate controlling membrane and/or by dispersing the active ingredient in a polymer matrix and/or gel.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable devices for use in delivering intradermal pharmaceutical compositions described herein include short needle devices such as those described in U.S. Pat.

The invention can also be used to treat emotional and mood disorders, such as depression, anxiety, addiction and obsessive compulsive disorder.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 1\n\n\nSynthesis and Purification of Glycopeptides\n\n\n \n \n \nBriefly, acetate-protected glycosyl 9-fluorenylmethyloxy carbamate amino acids are synthesized using patented methods described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,470,949 and 5,767,254. Deprotection of the Schiff base glycoside esters and reprotection afford modified amino acid glycosides in excellent yield. Subsequent peptide synthesis utilizes deprotection with 30% piperidine in nonaqueous solution. Directed coupling reactions are sequential and proceed with over 98% yield per step. Additional protecting groups from the carbohydrate are removed while on a fixed resin. Cleavage from the resin is accomplished with no affect upon the glycosidic linkage of the peptide. After HPLC purification, glycopeptides are then characterized by \ni\nH NMR, \n13\nC NMR, correlation spectroscopy, total correlation spectroscopy, rotating frame nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy, and fast atom bombardment high-resolution mass spectroscopy. Using these procedures, a set of glycosylated deltorphin analogs is synthesized and purified. Each of these novel compounds is advanced into in vitro and in vivo bioassays.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 2\n\n\nRadioligand Binding Studies\n\n\n \n \n \nThe affinity and selectivity of glycosylated deltorphin analogs for the three canonical opioid receptors (MOR, DOR, and KOR-kappa) is determined biochemically using receptor binding assays. Membranes from Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells that stably express either the human mu, delta, or kappa opioid receptor are incubated with various concentrations of the drug to determine comparative inhibitory measurements and determination of receptor selectivity. Each of the novel compounds (15-20) are screened first for receptor affinity at the human DOR, MOR and Kappa opioid receptors (KOR). Those compounds which display moderate to high affinity (Ki <30 nM) and DOR selectivity (20-fold or greater over MOR) are assessed in the GTPyS assay (Example 3) in order to confirm functional agonist activity at the DOR target and are advanced to in vivo testing (Example 4).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecific methodology for opioid binding studies is as follows: Membranes are isolated from CHO cells stably expressing human MOR, DOR, or KOR. At approximately 80% confluence, the cells are harvested by the use of a cell scraper and the cells and media from the plates are centrifuged at 200×g for 10 min at 4° C. Cells are resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and are homogenized by the use of a Polytron. The membranes are centrifuged at 48,000×g for 20 min at 4° C. and then resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, at a protein concentration of 5-10 mg/ml, as determined by the Bradford method (Bradford, 1976), using bovine serum albumin as the standard and stored frozen at −80° C. until use. Cell membranes are incubated at 25° C. with the radiolabeled ligands in a final volume of 1 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Incubation times of 60 min are used for the MOR-selective peptide [3H]DAMGO and the KOR-selective ligand [3H]U69,593, and a 3-hr incubation are used with the DOR-selective antagonist [3H]naltrindole. Nonspecific binding is measured by inclusion of 10 μM naloxone. The binding is terminated by filtering the samples through Schleicher & Scheull No. 32 glass fiber filters using a Brandel 48-well cell harvester. The filters are subsequently washed three times with 3 ml of cold 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and will be counted in 2 ml of Ecoscint A scintillation fluid. For [3H]U69,593 binding, the filters are soaked in 0.1% polyethylenimine for at least 30 mM before use. IC50 values are calculated by least squares fit to a logarithm-probit analysis. Ki values of unlabeled compounds will be calculated from the equation Ki=(IC50)/1+S where S=(concentration of radioligand) (Kd of radioligand) (Cheng and Prusoff, 1973).\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 3\n\n\n[\n35\nS]GTPγS Binding Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nPeptides having at least a 20-fold higher affinity for the DOR than for the MOR and KOR receptors, and having a Ki value of 10 nM or less at the DOR are tested in the [\n35\nS] GTPγS binding assay to determine if the peptide is an agonist, antagonist, or partial agonist at the DOR. Membranes from the CHO cell lines, expressing either the MOR, DOR or KOR, will be incubated with 12 concentrations of each peptide for 60 min at 30° C. in a final volume of 0.5 mL of assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EGTA, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.5) containing 3 μM GDP and 0.08 nM [\n35\nS] GTPγS. Basal binding is determined in the presence of GDP and the absence of opioids, and nonspecific binding is determined by including 10 μM unlabeled [\n35\nS] GTPγS. The incubation is terminated by filtration under vacuum through glass fiber filters, followed by three washes with 3-ml ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Samples are allowed to equilibrate overnight and are counted in 2 ml of Ecoscint A scintillation fluid for 2 min in a liquid scintillation counter.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 4\n\n\nIn Vivo Assessment of Opioid Glycopeptides\n\n\n \n \n \nCompounds meeting the first set of criteria are screened initially for antinociceptive activity in the tail-flick assay following intracerebroventricular (icv) and intravenous (iv) routes of administration. This in vivo screening assay is sensitive to the activity of deltorphin-based peptides and is highly efficient and rapid in determining efficacy and relative potency of compounds (Bilsky et al., 1994, 2000). Testing and comparing glycosylated versus unglycosylated peptides at the two dosing routes determines the effects of glycosylation on CNS bioavailability and determines the relative potency of glycosylated compounds. In addition to efficacy, early-stage assessment of side effects is made by gross observation following dosing (e.g., locomotor stimulation and stereotypy, Straub tail/muscular rigidity, convulsions, etc.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAcute Thermal Nociception Assay. The 52° C. tail-flick assay (optimized for DOR agonist sensitivity) is used to detect in vivo opioid activity at the DOR receptor following icv and iv injection of glycopeptides (and unglycosylated parent peptides). This is a modified version of the classic tail-flick test developed by D'Amour and Smith in 1941 and is sensitive to the antinociceptive effects of deltorphin-based, DOR-selective, peptides. Mice are lightly but firmly grasped by the nape of the neck with the evaluator's thumb and fingers, and the distal half of the tail is then dipped into a bath of circulating, thermostatically controlled water. Latency to respond to the heat stimulus with vigorous flexion of the tail is measured to the nearest 0.1 s. A 10 sec cut-off is used to prevent tissue damage to the tail. Antinociception is calculated by the following formula: % Antinociception=[(Test Latency−Baseline Latency)/(10−Baseline Latency)]×100. A baseline measurement will be taken and then each mouse will be injected at t=0 minutes. Mice are retested for antinociception at regular intervals (10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120 min) after the injection. An initial dosing of 10 nmol is used for compounds based on previous research with deltorphin peptides (Bilsky et al., 1995; 2000). If the animal displays minimal response (<20% MPE) at the 10-30 min time points, testing is terminated immediately after the 30 min time point. Doses are initially adjusted up or down in ½ log increments in an effort to generate a full dose response curve (3 doses with responses in the ˜20-80% range). An upper limit of a 100 nmol (icv) or 32 mg/kg (iv) dose is put in place (or alternatively, if significant dose-limiting toxicity is observed). Compounds that elicit less than a 75% MPE at time of peak effect are not considered further for antinociceptive development, though the data is used to guide further design and synthesis efforts. Compounds that reach these criteria are advanced for further in vivo testing.\n\n\n \nExample 5\n\n\nAssessment of Opioid Glycopeptide Effects Following Different Routes of Drug Administration\n\n\n \n \n \nFor icv injections, mice are lightly anesthesized, and following an incision on the top of the skull, an icv injection is delivered 2 mm posterior to the bregma and 2 mm lateral to the midline. The injection is 3 mm deep from the skull to the lateral ventricle and a PE tubing cuff prohibits deeper injections to be made. Injection volume is kept constant at 5 ul/mouse. The mouse quickly (within 5 minutes) recovers from the anesthesia and is ready to be tested at the 10 min time-point. Mice are euthanized immediately after being tested. For iv injections, animals are briefly restrained in a Plexiglas holder and the distal portion of the tail is dipped into 42° C. warm-water for approximately 10 seconds to dilate the tail vein prior to injection. The icv and iv comparisons are important for determining potency ratios of the test compounds, as this provides a relative measure of blood brain barrier penetration with minimal confounds typically associated with other routes (e.g., gut absorption, first pass effects, etc.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds administered intravenously that elicit less than a 75% maximum possible effect (MPE) at time of peak effect are not considered appropriate for development as an antinociceptive product. Compounds which display potent and fully efficacious antinociceptive activity following both icv and iv administration are advanced to further assays and or formulated and tested for oral activity.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 6\n\n\nAssessment of Opioid Glycopeptides in a Sub-Acute Inflammatory Pain Model\n\n\n \n \n \nBased upon results from the antinociceptive screening assay as well as behavioral observations, the most promising deltorphin-based glycopeptides are assessed for efficacy and potency in a commonly used, sub-acute inflammatory pain model: hind paw injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). Injection of CFA into the rodent hind-paw produces a strong inflammatory response that peaks between 24 and 48 hrs post-injection. This assesses the effects of systemic drug administration on paw volume, tactile thresholds and thermal response latencies before and after CFA administration. A key milestone is the observation of significant efficacy in the CFA model including potential anti-allodynic, anti-hyperalgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. Careful observation of animals is conducted to determine if there are any dose-limiting side effects associated with the compound. The CFA sub-acute model is used because it provides robust inflammatory pain efficacy data.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 7\n\n\nCFA Inflammatory Pain Model\n\n\n \n \n \nFor the CFA model, rats are baselined for tactile thresholds and thermal latencies (see below). Rats receive intradermal injections of 20 μl vehicle or CFA (1 mg/ml \nMycobacterium tuberculosis, \nSigma) solution into the plantar side of one hind paw. Rats are retested for tactile thresholds and thermal latencies at 24 hrs post-CFA/vehicle administration (a time where the effects of CFA are maximal). Complete dose- and time-response curves (n=6-8 rats/group) are completed with starting doses selected from data collected in the acute antinociceptive assays.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 8\n\n\nThermal Latencies\n\n\n \n \n \nMice are habituated in Plexiglas chambers on a glass plate for ˜45 minutes. A radiant heat source (Plantar™ Analgesia Instrument, Stoelting Co.) is applied to the middle of the plantar surface of each hind paw. The latency of the animal to lift its paw is recorded automatically. The intensity of the light is calibrated to produce baseline response latencies in control mice of ˜10-12 seconds. Each evaluation is repeated twice (average taken) with an ˜5-minute interval between determinations. A cut-off time of 20 seconds is used to avoid tissue damage to the hind paw.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 9\n\n\nPaw-Withdrawal Thresholds\n\n\n \n \n \nTactile thresholds are determined by probing the hindpaw of the mouse with a series of finely calibrated von Frey filaments (Stoelting Co.). The strength of the von Frey stimuli ranges from 0.02 g to 6 g on a logarithmic scale. Mice are allowed to acclimate within Plexiglas enclosures that have mesh bottoms for ˜30 min, and then withdrawal thresholds are determined by increasing and decreasing stimulus strength until the minimal stimulus required to elicit a response is determined (“up-down” method). The paw-withdrawal threshold is estimated by the Dixon nonparametric test. The data are represented as mean withdrawal threshold±S.E.M. Paw-withdrawal baseline thresholds average ˜4.5±0.5 g and are maintained in the non-injured controls at approximately this level across repeated testing.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 10\n\n\nOsteoarthritis Model\n\n\n \n \n \nAn osteoarthritis pain model is utilized for several reasons. First, osteoarthritis represents a major chronic pain condition that has a significant health and economic burden, and for which current pharmacotherapies either lack adequate efficacy and/or are limited by side effects. Second, there are a number of well-characterized osteoarthritis pain models in rodents including the intraarticular injection of sodium iodoacetate into the knee joint. And third, enkephalin and dynorphin systems (DOR, as well MOR and KOR) are dynamically regulated in the pathology of arthritis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnimals are first base-lined for mechanical thresholds or differential weight bearing (see below). For induction of arthritis, the animals are lightly anesthetized and administered an intraarticular injection of vehicle (0.9% NaCl) or sodium iodoacetate (1 mg in 25 μl) into the right knee. Animals are reassessed for mechanical thresholds or differential weight bearing on \npost-injection days\n 3, 7 and 21. For weight-bearing measurements, animals are habituated to the apparatus (Columbus Instruments Incapacitance Tester). The holder helps align the hind paws onto the two independent scales, and if needed the paws can be gently prodded so that separate readings are taken for differential weight bearing. The apparatus is programmed to take automatic readings (each averaged over 5 seconds), with three readings averaged to give the mean for baseline and each of the time-points.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 11\n\n\nMeasuring Efficacy and Side Effects Using Animal Models\n\n\n \n \n \nData in the CFA model of inflammatory pain and the iodoacetate model of osteoarthritis pain is obtained in rats. These well-validated inflammatory pain models are used to assess compound potency and efficacy.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 12\n\n\nLocomotor Activity and Assays of Behavior and Side Effects\n\n\n \n \n \nAssays are known whereby the degree to which an animal experiences pain, physical impairment, and other behavioral aspects can be measured.

The experiments were performed with two racks filtered separately, but using the same [3H]Naltrindole stock solution, membranes and buffer. Non-specific binding was measured in the presence of 100 uM naloxone. Non-specific binding was subtracted from the control and peptide total CPM to give specific CPM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results for delta and mu receptor binding are illustrated in \nFIGS. 1\n, and \n2\n, respectively.

Of the 8 peptides synthesized and screened as described above, two (11008 and 11005) were selected for testing across a range of concentrations at all three opioid receptors. Full binding curves at delta, mu and kappa were completed and the binding data for 11008 and 11005 are presented below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods: Briefly, the peptides were tested in competition binding experiments across a wide range (0.1 nM to 10 μM) of 12 different concentrations to determine the relative affinity of the peptides for the delta, mu and kappa opioid receptors. Based on the results from the initial set of experiments, the concentration range was then narrowed so that at least 8 datum points fell on the descending portion of the inhibition curve. Compounds were tested in triplicate. Membranes from Chinese hamster ovary cells with stably expressed delta, mu or kappa opioid receptors were used. The delta-selective antagonist [\n3\nH]naltrindole was used at a final concentration of 0.2 nM, the mu-selective peptide agonist [\n3\nH]DAMGO was used at a final concentration of 0.25 nM and the kappa-selective agonist, [\n3\nH]U69,593. Nonspecific binding was measure in the presence of 100 μM naloxone. Twelve different concentrations of the peptides were used to determine the 1050 value for the delta and mu receptors, which was converted into a Ki value±S.E.M. For the kappa binding experiment, three subsequent tests were performed with the peptides at a final concentration of 10 μM to determine the percent inhibition of [\n3\nH]U69,593 binding.

Description\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to antibodies that bind ferroportin 1 (FPN1) and their use in treating anemia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIron is an essential trace element that is required for numerous cellular functions. In mammals, the supply of iron to the body is regulated to match the body's iron requirements at the level of iron absorption by duodenal enterocytes. Iron transport across the basolateral membrane of the enterocyte is thought to be mediated by ferroportin 1 (also known as iron-regulated transporter 1 (IREG-1), metal transporter protein 1 (MTP1) and SLC40A1), hereafter referred to as FPN1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFPN1 is now known to be a receptor for hepcidin, a polypeptide hormone made by the liver in response to iron stores and inflammation. Binding of mature hepcidin to FPN1 leads to the internalization and degradation of FPN1, preventing cellular iron export, and it is a major controlling factor of systemic iron homeostasis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nU.S. Pat. No. 7,166,448 discloses, inter alia, nucleotide sequences encoding human FPN1 proteins, human FPN1 proteins having iron transport function, and a rabbit polyclonal antiserum generated to a peptide consisting of the C-terminal 19 amino acids of the human FPN1. PCT International Patent Application Publication No. WO2009/094551 describes ferroportin Mabs and methods of using them for treating disorders of iron homeostasis. More specifically, WO2009/094551 describes rodent and fully human monoclonal antibodies to various epitopes of human FPN1 proteins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn view of the involvement of FPN1 in iron transport and the association of FPN1 mutations with diseases of iron homeostasis, there exists a need for therapeutically useful FPN1 antagonists that bind with high affinity to an extracellular epitope of FPN1 and, upon binding, inhibit mature hepcidin-mediated FPN1 internalization, thereby maintaining or enhancing export of iron from intracellular stores. Additionally, targeting FPN1 therapeutically with a Mab, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, with the goal of inhibiting the binding of mature hepcidin to an extracellular epitope of FPN1 must be accomplished precisely enough so that the antibody doesn't significantly perturb the efflux of cellular iron and/or induce internalization upon binding to its target. Additionally, an anti-FPN antibody intended for use in human medical therapy must exhibit sufficient pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics, including in vivo stability and/or elimination half life to allow for their therapeutic use. One or more of the anti-human FPN1 antibodies disclosed herein specifically bind human FPN1, including at least one peptide fragment thereof selected from the group consisting of:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n

In preferred embodiments, these antibodies, or antigen-binding fragments thereof, inhibit the mature human hepcidin induced-internalization and/or degradation of human FPN1, thereby increasing transport of iron out of cells in vitro and in vivo and elevating serum iron levels in vivo. For example, in preferred embodiments, the antibodies of the present invention significantly decrease mature hepcidin-induced accumulation of ferritin within Caco-2 cells, a human enterocyte cell line that endogenously expresses FPN1, in vitro (see, Example 5).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA full-length antibody as it exists naturally is an immunoglobulin molecule comprising 2 heavy chains and 2 light chains interconnected by disulfide bonds. The amino terminal portion of each chain includes a variable region of about 100-110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition via the CDRs contained therein. The carboxy-terminal portion of each chain defines a constant region primarily responsible for effector function.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “CDR” as used herein is intended to mean the non-contiguous antigen combining sites found within the variable region of both heavy and light chain polypeptides. These particular regions have been described by Kabat, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 252, 6609-6616 (1977), Kabat, et al., Sequences of protein of immunological interest, (1991), and by Chothia, et al., J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917 (1987) and by MacCallum, et al., J. Mol. Biol., 262:732-745 (1996) where the definitions include overlapping or subsets of amino acid residues when compared against each other.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe CDRs are interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed framework regions (“FR”). Each light chain variable region (LCVR) and heavy chain variable region (HCVR) is composed of three CDRs and four FRs, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus in the following order: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4. The three CDRs of the light chain are referred to as “LCDR1, LCDR2, and LCDR3” and the three CDRs of the heavy chain are referred to as “HCDR1, HCDR2, and HCDR3.” The CDRs contain most of the residues which form specific interactions with the antigen. The numbering and positioning of CDR amino acid residues within the LCVR and HCVR regions is in accordance with well-known conventions (e.g., Kabat, (1991) and/or Chothia (1987)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase “Kabat numbering” as used herein is recognized in the art and refers to a system of numbering amino acid residues which are more variable (i.e., hypervariable) than other amino acid residues in the heavy and light chain regions of an antibody (Kabat, et al., Ann.

Sci., 190:382-93 (1971); Kabat, et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH Publication No. 91-3242 (1991)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “monoclonal antibody” (Mab) refers to an antibody that is derived from a single copy or clone including, for example, any eukaryotic, prokaryotic, or phage clone, and not the method by which it is produced. Mabs of the present invention preferably exist in a homogeneous or substantially homogeneous population. Complete Mabs contain 2 heavy chains and 2 light chains. Monoclonal antibodies, or antigen-binding fragments thereof, of the present invention can be produced, for example, by recombinant technologies, phage display technologies, synthetic technologies, e.g., CDR-grafting, or combinations of such technologies, or other technologies known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the phrase “antigen-binding fragments” of Mabs include, for example, Fab fragments, Fab′ fragments, F(ab′)\n2 \nfragments, and single chain Fv fragments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “antibody”, or grammatical versions thereof, unless indicated otherwise, refers to Mabs, antigen-binding fragments thereof, as well as combinations thereof, including, for example, combinations of Fabs, and combinations of Mabs and Fabs. Additional antibodies exhibiting similar functional properties as the antibodies according to the present invention can be generated by conventional methods. For example, mice can be immunized with, for example, FPN1 expressing cells, FPN1 or fragments thereof, the resulting antibodies can be recovered and purified, and determination of whether they possess binding, pharmacokinetic, and functional properties similar to or the same as the antibodies disclosed herein can be assessed by the methods disclosed in Examples 3-14 herein below. Antigen-binding fragments can also be prepared by conventional methods well-known in the art. Methods for producing and purifying antibodies and antigen-binding fragments are also well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the phrase “specifically binds” refers to the ability of an antibody of the present invention to bind to a specified polypeptide or peptide, preferably, \nhuman ferroportin\n 1 consisting of the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1, or a specified peptide fragment thereof, with a K\nD \nless than about 1000 nM, less than about 100 nM, less than about 10 nM, less than about 1 nM, less than about 100 μM, or less than about 10 μM, as determined by affinity ELISA or SPR assays as described herein, for example, or similar assays known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, or alternatively, the phrase “specifically binds” in reference to an antibody of the present invention indicates that the ability of the antibody to bind to or detect \nhuman ferroportin\n 1 consisting of the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1, or a peptide fragment thereof, is at least about 5 times greater, at least about 10 times greater, at least about 20 times greater, at least about 50 times greater, at least about 100 times greater, at least about 200 times greater, at least about 500 times greater, or at least about 1000 times greater than its ability to bind to or detect another polypeptide (e.g., heparin) or, optionally, another specified peptide fragment of \nhuman ferroportin\n 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides an isolated polynucleotide comprising a nucleotide sequence that encodes a Mab, or antigen-binding fragment thereof.

When used herein, the term “mature hepcidin” refers to any mature, bioactive form of the hepcidin protein expressed in mammals. When used herein, the phrase “human hepcidin” refers to any form of the hepcidin protein present in humans. When used herein, the phrase “mature human hepcidin” any mature, bioactive form of the hepcidin protein known to be present in humans. Preferably, “mature human hepcidin” refers to “human hepcidin-25”, a mature form of human hepcidin having the amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 91.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “bioactivity” in reference to mature hepcidin polypeptides such as hepcidin-25 includes, but is not limited to, specific binding of mature hepcidin to its receptor FPN1, one or more FPN1-mediated functions of mature hepcidin, such as a) mature hepcidin-induced internalization and/or degradation of FPN1 (see, e.g., Nemeth, E., et al., Science, 306:2090-2093, (2004)), b) mature hepcidin regulation of FPN1-mediated i) iron efflux, ii) serum iron levels, iii) reticulocyte count, iv) red blood cell count, v) hemoglobin levels, vi) hematocrit, vii) expression levels of hepcidin polypeptides, and/or viii) tissue distribution of hepcidin polypeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase “human engineered antibodies” refers to certain antibodies disclosed herein as well as antibodies that have binding and functional properties according to the invention similar to the antibodies disclosed herein, and that have framework regions that are substantially human or fully human surrounding CDRs derived from a non-human antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, disclosed herein. “Framework region” or “framework sequence” refers to any one of \nframework regions\n 1 to 4. Human engineered antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof encompassed by the present invention include molecules wherein any one or more of \nframework regions\n 1 to 4 is substantially or fully human, i.e., wherein any of the possible combinations of individual substantially or fully \nhuman framework regions\n 1 to 4, is present. For example, this includes molecules in which \nframework region\n 1 and \nframework region\n 2, \nframework region\n 1 and \nframework region\n 3, \n \n \nframework region\n \n \n 1, 2, and 3, etc., are substantially or fully human. Substantially human frameworks are those that have at least about 80% sequence identity to a known human germline framework sequence. Preferably, the substantially human frameworks have at least about 85%, about 90%, or about 95% sequence identity to a known human germline framework sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFully human frameworks are those that are identical to a known human germline framework sequence. Human framework germline sequences can be obtained from ImMunoGeneTics (IMGT) via their website http://imgt.cines.fr, or from \nThe Immunoglobulin Facts Book \nby Marie-Paule Lefranc and Gerard Lefranc, Academic Press, 2001, ISBN 012441351. For example, germline light chain frameworks can be selected from the group consisting of: All, A17, A18, A19, A20, A27, A30, L1, L11, L12, L2, L5, L15, L6, L8, O12, O2, and O8, and germline heavy chain framework regions can be selected from the group consisting of: VH2-5, VH2-26, VH2-70, VH3-20, VH3-72, VH1-46, VH3-9, VH3-66, VH3-74, VH4-31, VH1-18, VH1-69, VI-13-7, VH3-11, VH3-15, VH3-21, VH3-23, VH3-30, VH3-48, VH4-39, VH4-59, and VH5-51. Preferably, germline light chain frameworks are selected from the group consisting of O2, O18, and L12, L1 and germline heavy chain framework regions are selected from the group consisting of VH1-69, VH1-18, or VH1-46. More preferably, germline light chain frameworks are selected from the group consisting of O2 and L1, and germline heavy chain frameworks are selected from the group consisting of VH1-69 and VH1-18. Most preferably, the germline light chain framework is O2 and the germline heavy chain framework region is VH1-69.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the human engineered antibodies disclosed herein, human engineered antibodies exhibiting similar functional properties as the antibodies according to the present invention can be generated using several different methods. The antibodies specifically disclosed herein can be used as templates or parent antibodies to prepare additional antibodies. In one approach, the CDRs of a parent antibody are grafted into a human framework that has a high sequence identity with the parent antibody framework. The sequence identity of the new framework will generally be at least about 80%, at least about 85%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, or at least about 99% identical to the sequence of the corresponding framework in the parent antibody. This grafting may result in a reduction in binding affinity compared to that of the parent antibody. If this is the case, the framework can be back-mutated to the parent framework at certain positions based on specific criteria disclosed by Queen, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA., 88:2869 (1991).

Biol. 168:595-620 (1983); and the method of Winter and co-workers (Jones, et al., Nature 321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann, et al., Nature, 332:323-327 (1988); and Verhoeyen, et al., Science, 239:1534-1536 (1988).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe identification of residues to consider for back-mutation can be carried out as follows:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen an amino acid falls under the following category, the framework amino acid of the human germ-line sequence that is being used (the “acceptor framework”) is replaced by a framework amino acid from a framework of the parent antibody (the “donor framework”):\n\n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the amino acid in the human framework region of the acceptor framework is unusual for human frameworks at that position, whereas the corresponding amino acid in the donor immunoglobulin is typical for human frameworks at that position;\n \n(b) the position of the amino acid is immediately adjacent to one of the CDRs; or\n \n(c) any side chain atom of a framework amino acid is within about 5-6 angstroms (center-to-center) of any atom of a CDR amino acid in a three dimensional immunoglobulin model.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nWhen each of the amino acids in the human framework region of the acceptor framework and a corresponding amino acid in the donor framework is generally unusual for human frameworks at that position, such amino acid can be replaced by an amino acid typical for human frameworks at that position. This back-mutation criterion enables one to recover the activity of the parent antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother approach to generating human engineered antibodies exhibiting similar functional properties to the antibodies disclosed herein involves randomly mutating amino acids within the grafted CDRs without changing the framework, and screening the resultant molecules for binding affinity and other functional properties that are as good as or better than those of the parent antibodies. Single mutations can also be introduced at each amino acid position within each CDR, followed by assessing the effects of such mutations on binding affinity and other functional properties. Single mutations producing improved properties can be combined to assess their effects in combination with one another.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, a combination of both of the foregoing approaches is possible. After CDR grafting, one can back-mutate specific framework regions in addition to introducing amino acid changes in the CDRs. This methodology is described in Wu, et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n294:151-162 (1999). Preferably, amino acid substitution within the frameworks is restricted to one, two, or three positions within any one or more of the light chain and/or heavy chain framework regions disclosed herein (i.e., framework regions shown in \nFIGS. 2-5\n). Preferably, amino acid substitution within the CDRs is restricted to one, two, or three positions within any one or more of the three light chain and/or heavy chain CDRs. Combinations of the various changes described within the framework regions and the CDRs are also contemplated herein. In particular embodiments of this aspect of the invention, all light and heavy chain variable region framework regions of such human engineered Mabs, or antigen-binding fragments thereof, are fully human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTables 1A and 1B below depict the CDR amino acid sequences and consensus amino acid sequences of preferred antibodies, or antigen-binding fragments thereof, of the present invention.

By the phrase “combination therapy” or “in combination with” it is meant an anti-FPN1 Mab, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, of the present invention is administered separately, simultaneously, or sequentially with another agent intended to increase serum iron levels, increase hematocrits, increase hemoglobin levels, reducing the need for transfusions, and/or improving the functional status, productivity, and quality of life of anemic patients as compared to the administration of the anti-FPN1 Mab, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, alone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, an anti-FPN1 Mab, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, disclosed herein may be administered in lieu of ESA therapy in patients intolerant or unresponsive to ESA therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase “erythropoiesis stimulating agent” or “erythropoiesis stimulator” means a compound that directly or indirectly causes activation of the erythropoietin receptor, for example, by binding to and causing dimerization of the receptor or by stimulating endogenous erythropoietin expression. ESAs include erythropoietin and variants, analogs, or derivatives thereof that bind to and activate erythropoietin receptor; antibodies that bind to erythropoietin receptor and activate the receptor; or peptides that bind to and activate erythropoietin receptor; or small organic chemical compounds, optionally less than about 1000 Daltons in molecular weight, that bind to and activate erythropoietin receptor. ESAs include, but are not limited to, epoetin alfa, epoetin beta, epoetin delta, epoetin omega, epoetin iota, epoetin zeta, and analogs thereof, pegylated erythropoietin, carbamylated erythropoietin, mimetic peptides (including EMP1/hematide), mimetic antibodies and HIF inhibitors (see U.S. Patent Publication No. 2005/0020487). Exemplary ESAs include erythropoietin, darbepoetin, erythropoietin agonist variants, and peptides or antibodies that bind and activate erythropoietin receptor including compounds reported in U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2003/0215444 and 2006/0040858 as well as erythropoietin molecules or variants or analogs thereof also known in the art. Erythropoietin includes, but is not limited to, a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 88. The term “epoetin”, includes, but is not limited to, epoetin alfa, epoetin beta, epoetin delta, epoetin omega, epoetin iota, epoetin gamma, epoetin zeta, and the like. Additionally, an epoetin also includes any of the aforementioned epoetins which are chemically modified, e.g., with one or more water-soluble polymers such as, e.g., polyethylene glycol (including PEG-EPO-beta). Exemplary sequences, manufacture, purification and use of recombinant human erythropoietin are described in a number of patent publications, including, but not limited to, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,703,008 and 4,667,016. Exemplary sequences, manufacture, purification and use of darbepoetin and other erythropoietin analogs are described in a number of patent publications, including Strickland et al., 91/05867, and PCT International Patent Application Publications Nos. WO 95/05465, WO 00/24893, and WO 01/81405. Derivatives of naturally occurring or analog polypeptides include those which have been chemically modified, for example, to attach water soluble polymers (e.g., pegylated), radionuclides, or other diagnostic or targeting or therapeutic moieties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “erythropoietic activity” means activity to stimulate erythropoiesis as demonstrated in an in vivo assay, for example, the exhypoxic, polycythemic mouse assay (see, e.g., Cotes and Bangham, Nature, 191:1065 (1961)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “epitope” refers to that portion of any molecule capable of being recognized by and bound by an antibody at one or more of the antibody's antigen-binding regions. Epitopes often consist of a chemically active surface grouping of molecules such as amino acids or sugar side chains, and have specific three dimensional structural characteristics as well as specific charge characteristics. The human FPN1 epitopes disclosed herein are presented in the context of the primary amino acid structure of FPN1 (SEQ ID NO: 1). However, some of the epitopes may be discontinuous rather than continuous as the amino acid residues, rather than being in continuous peptide linkage, may be in spatial proximity to each other as a consequence of the tertiary or quaternary structure of FPN1 and their resultant presentation on the surface of this molecule. Preferably, an anti-FPN1 Mab, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, of the present invention binds human FPN1 consisting of the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:1 at an epitope comprising or consisting essentially of or consisting of an amino acid or amino acids localized to the amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 9.

The terms “disorder”, “condition” and “disease” are used interchangeably herein and include chronic and acute mature hepcidin-promoted disorders, including, but not limited to, anemia including, but not limited to, anemia of chronic disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “anemia of chronic disease” refers to any anemia that develops as a result of, for example, extended infection, inflammation, and neoplastic disorders. The anemia which develops is often characterized by a shortened red blood cell life span and sequestration of iron in macrophages, which results in a decrease in the amount of iron available to make new red blood cells. Conditions associated with anemia of chronic disease include, but are not limited to, chronic bacterial endocarditis, osteomyelitis, rheumatic fever, ulcerative colitis, and neoplastic disorders. Further conditions include other diseases and disorders associated with infection, inflammation, and neoplasms, including, for example, inflammatory infections (e.g., pulmonary abscess, tuberculosis), inflammatory noninfectious disorders (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythrematosus, Crohn's disease, hepatitis, inflammatory bowel disease), and various cancers, tumors, and malignancies (e.g., carcinoma, sarcoma, lymphoma). Anemia of chronic disease is associated with hypoferremia and reticuloendothelial cell iron sequestration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInflammatory cytokines are potent inducers of hepcidin expression, and hepcidin excess may play a key role in the pathogenesis of anemia in these patients (Weiss, et al., N. Engl. J. Med., 352:1011-1023 (2005); Pigeon. et al., J. Biol. Chem. 276:7811-7819 (2001); Nicolas, et al., J. Clin. Invest. 110:1037-1044 (2002); Nemeth, et al., J. Clin. Invest. 113:1271-1276 (2004); Nemeth, et al., Blood, 101:2461-2463 (2003); Lee, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA., 102:1906-1910 (2005)). Inflammatory mediators such as IL-6 may regulate hepcidin expression through STAT3 (Wrighting, et al., Blood, 108:3204-3209 (2006); Verga Falzacappa, et al., Blood, 109:353-358 (2007); Pietrangelo et al., Gastroenterology, 132:294-300 (2007)). The data presented herein provide in vivo evidence that anti-FPN1 Mabs of the present invention increase serum iron levels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso provided by the present invention are methods of treating anemia comprising the administration of anti-FPN1 Mabs, or antigen-binding fragments thereof, of the present invention. In some embodiments, the method of treating anemia comprises the step of administering a pharmaceutical composition comprising an anti-FPN1 Mab, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, to a subject at risk for or exhibiting pathologies as described herein, e.g., anemia disorders, using standard administration techniques.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase “effective amount” as used herein refers to an amount necessary (at dosages and for periods of time and for the means of administration) to achieve the desired therapeutic result. An effective amount of the antibody may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, gender, and weight of the individual, and the ability of the antibody or antibody portion to elicit a desired response in the individual. An effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effect of the antibody, are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn effective amount is at least the minimal amount, but less than a toxic amount, of an active agent which is necessary to impart therapeutic benefit to a subject. Stated another way, an effective amount or therapeutically effective amount of an antibody of the invention is an amount which, in mammals, preferably humans, (i) increases serum iron levels, reticulocyte count, red blood cell count, hemoglobin, and/or hematocrit, or (ii) treats a disorder wherein the presence of mature hepcidin causes or contributes to an undesirable pathological effect, or (iii) decreases mature hepcidin bioactivity resulting in a beneficial therapeutic effect in a mammal, preferably a human, including, but not limited to, having anemia including, but not limited to, anemia of chronic disease, including, but not limited to, anemia resulting from infection, inflammation, and/or cancer. An effective amount of an antibody of the invention may be administered in a single dose or in multiple doses. Furthermore, an effective amount of an antibody of the invention may be administered in multiple doses of amounts that would be less than an effective amount if not administered more than once.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs is well known in the medical arts, dosages for any one subject depends upon many factors, including the patient's size, body surface area, age, the particular compound to be administered, gender, time and route of administration, general health, and other drugs being administered concurrently. Dose may further vary depending on the type and severity of the disease. A typical dose can be, for example, in the range of about 1 mg to about 100 mg; preferably, about 2 mg to about 100 mg; more preferably, about 5 mg to about 100 mg; even more preferably, about 5 mg to about 50 mg, even more preferably, about 5 mg to about 25 mg; even more preferably, about 5 mg to about 20 mg; even more preferably, about 5 mg to about 15 mg; however, doses below or above this exemplary range are envisioned, especially considering the aforementioned factors. A daily parenteral dosage regimen can be from about 10 μg/kg to about 100 mg/kg, preferably, from about 100 μg/kg to about 100 mg/kg, more preferably, from about 1 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg, even more preferably, from about 1 mg/kg to about 30 mg/kg, even more preferably, from about 3 mg/kg to about 30 mg/kg, or most preferably from about 3 mg/kg to about 30 mg/kg. Progress may be monitored by periodic assessment, and the dose adjusted accordingly.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese suggested amounts of anti-FPN1 antibody are subject to a great deal of therapeutic discretion. The key factor in selecting an appropriate dose and scheduling is the result obtained. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated, the clinical condition of the individual patient, the cause of the disorder, the site of delivery of the antibody, the particular type of antibody, the method of administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to medical practitioners.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies of the present invention can be used as medicaments in human medicine, administered by a variety of routes. Most preferably, such compositions are for parenteral administration. Such pharmaceutical compositions can be prepared by methods well known in the art. See, e.g., \nRemington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, \n19\nth \ned. (1995), Gennaro, A., et al., Mack Publishing Co. Accordingly, this invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising one or more antibodies of the invention in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, or excipients. In a particular embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition further comprises one or more other therapeutic agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term parenteral as used herein includes intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, rectal, vaginal, or intraperitoneal administration. Parenteral delivery by intravenous infusion or intravenous, intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous injection is preferred. Subcutaneous injection is most preferred. Suitable vehicles for such injections are well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical composition typically must be sterile and stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage in the container provided, including e.g., a sealed vial, syringe or other delivery device, e.g., a pen. Therefore, pharmaceutical compositions may be sterile filtered after making the formulation, or otherwise made microbiologically acceptable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn antibody of the invention can be incorporated into a pharmaceutical composition suitable for administration to a human subject. An antibody of the invention may be administered to a human subject alone or in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or diluent in single or multiple doses. Such pharmaceutical compositions are designed to be appropriate for the selected mode of administration, and pharmaceutically acceptable diluents, carrier, and/or excipients such as dispersing agents, buffers, surfactants, preservatives, solubilizing agents, isotonicity agents including but not limited to sodium chloride, stabilizing agents and the like are used as appropriate. Said compositions can be designed in accordance with conventional techniques disclosed in, for example, \nRemington, The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, \n19\nth \nEdition, Gennaro, Ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa. (1995) which provides a compendium of formulation techniques as are generally known to practitioners. Suitable carriers for pharmaceutical compositions include any material which, when combined with an antibody of the invention, retains the molecule's activity and is non-reactive with the subject's immune system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “subject” and “patient” used interchangeably herein, refer to a mammal, preferably, a human. In certain embodiments, the patient has a disorder that would benefit from a decreased level of mature hepcidin, a decrease in mature hepcidin bioactivity, and/or an increase in serum iron level, reticulocyte count, red blood cell count, hemoglobin, and/or hematocrit.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdministration of a FPN1 antibody compound alone may be useful in patients intolerant to one or more ESAs, either at any dose or only at high doses, due to, for example, undesirable side effects. A FPN1 Mab, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, of the present invention administered alone or in combination with an ESA, may also be useful in ESA-resistant patients who are incapable of reaching their hematocrit goals with ESAs alone, either at conventional or high doses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA FPN1 Mab, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, of the present invention may also be administered when combination drug therapy, including the use of ESAs, is inadequate in allowing patients to reach their hematocrit goals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides the use of a monoclonal antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof, of the present invention for the manufacture of a medicament for increasing serum iron levels, reticulocyte count, red blood cell count, hemoglobin, and/or hematocrit in a human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides the use of the monoclonal antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof in the manufacture of a medicament for use in combination therapy for increasing serum iron levels, reticulocyte count, red blood cell count, hemoglobin, and/or hematocrit in a human, wherein said medicament is to be administered in combination with one or more ESAs selected from the group consisting of epoetin alfa, epoietin beta, darbepoetin alfa, hematide, methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta, or other therapeutic agent or therapeutic treatment conventionally employed to increase serum iron levels, reticulocyte count, red blood cell count, hemoglobin, and/or hematocrit in a human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following non-limiting examples illustrate various properties of the anti-FPN1 antibodies disclosed herein.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 1\n\n\nProduction of Human Hepcidin-25\n\n\n \n \n \nHuman hepcidin-25 can be obtained from commercial sources (e.g., Peptide International (Louisville, Ky.)) or produced by a variety of synthetic or recombinant techniques known in the art. Alternatively, a fusion protein comprising the twenty-five amino acids of human hepcidin-25 sequence and having the amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 91 is expressed in \nE. coli\n. Inclusion bodies are isolated from 3 liters of \nE. coli \nexpressing the human hepcidin fusion protein after a 3-6 hour induction with 1 mM IPTG at 37° C. The inclusion bodies are solubilized in buffer A (50 mM Tris and 8 M urea (pH 8.0)). The supernatant is passed over an IMAC column (20 mL resin). The column is washed with buffer A until the absorbance returned to baseline and the bound polypeptides are batch eluted from the column by 0.5 M imidazole in buffer A. The human hepcidin-25 fusion protein is pooled and reduced with 50 mM DTT. This fusion protein is then refolded by diluting pooled material into 2 M urea, 3 mM cysteine, 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0) to a final protein concentration less than 50 μg/mL. This material is stirred at room temperature and air oxidized for 48 hours. The oxidized polypeptides are passed over an IMAC column (20 mL) at a flow rate of 5 mL/min, and the human hepcidin-25 fusion protein is batch eluted from the column by 0.5 M imidazol in buffer A. The pooled fractions containing the human hepcidin-25 fusion protein are concentrated and passed over a Superdex 75 (GE Healthcare, XK26/60) sizing column equilibrated with 50 mM Tris, 4 M urea, pH 8.0, at a flow rate of 3 mL/min. The monomeric fusion protein is pooled and then diluted to 50 mM Tris, 2M urea, 5 mM CaCl\n2\n, pH 8.0 and then is cleaved with enterokinase to produce human hepcidin-25 of SEQ ID NO: 1. Uncleaved human hepcidin-25 fusion protein is removed by passive IMAC chromatography (as outlined above). The flow through from the IMAC column is then passed over a C-18 Reversed Phase column at a flow rate of 4.0 mL/minute. The column is washed with 0.1% TFA in water until the absorbance returned to baseline and the bound polypeptides are eluted from the column with a linear gradient of acetonitrile from 20% to 40% with 0.1% TFA at a rate of 0.5%/min. Fractions which contain the human hepcidin-25 polypeptide are pooled and analyzed by N-terminal amino acid sequencing and matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). Polypeptides encoding rat, mouse, and Cynomolgus monkey hepcidin-25 and various N-terminally truncated forms of human hepcidin-25, including hepcidin-22 and hepcidin-20 were obtained commercially (e.g., Peptide International).\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 2\n\n\nGeneration of 34A9 Fab\n\n\n \n \n \nAnti-FPN1 antibodies may be obtained by immunizing mice with an immunogenic peptide having the amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 11. More specifically, an immunogenic peptide comprising an OVA epitope linked by a peptide linker to the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 12, which is thought to be at least part of an extracellular loop of human FPN1, may be used to immunize mice. After immunization, mice spleens are harvested and spleen cells are sorted by Magnetic Activated Cell Sorting using a biotinylated peptide having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 12 and streptavidin beads. RNA is isolated from antigen binding cells and converted into cDNA using oligo dT. Antibody heavy and light chain variable regions are obtained by PCR using antibody framework primers and cloned into a phage vector to make a Fab antibody library. The phage antibody library is screened with a biotinylated peptide, e.g., 100 nM, having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 12. Positively binding clones are then characterized by DNA sequencing, Fabs expression and binding to the immunizing peptide and/or cells expressing human ferroportin. Fab 34A9 was identified following the procedure essentially as described above.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 3\n\n\nEpitope Mapping of Anti-FPN1 Mabs\n\n\n \n \n \nPeptides containing partial sequences of the FPN1 related immunogen may be used in dot blot hybridization experiments to determine the epitopes of the mouse Mab 34A9.

The membrane is blocked with blocking buffer (e.g., PBS containing 1% BSA), then incubated with 3-5 μg/mL FPN1 antibody in blocking buffer at room temperature for an hour. The membrane is washed three times, 5 min each, with 1×PBST (10 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, pH 7.4) before it is incubated with IR700-labeled-Goat-anti-Mouse antibody according to manufacturer's protocol (LiCor, Inc; Lincoln, Nebr.). The membrane is washed three times, five minutes each, with 1×PBST, is imaged on Odyssey imaging system and Odyssey software (LiCor, Inc).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 1\n indicates that Mab 34A9 binds to peptides FpnE3a, 060719Z, 0708L4C, and 0708L4D, all of which contain amino acids 409 to 415 of SEQ ID NO: 1. Mab 34A9 does not require the amino acids sequence of EDI as indicated by the binding to peptide 0708L4D. Mab 34A9 binds more weakly to \npeptide\n 060719Z than 0708L4C; the latter peptide contains amino acids 416-419 of FPN1 (SEQ ID NO: 1).\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 4\n\n\nAffinities of Anti-FPN1 Fabs and Mabs as Determined by SPR\n\n\n \n \n \nThe affinities of FPN1 binding Fabs and Mabs may be determined on Biacore T100 and using 1:1 binding model in the Biacore T100 evaluation software (BIAcore® AB, Upsala, Sweden). Briefly, the T-REx system, a commercially available tetracycline-regulated expression system without viral transactivators (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) is used for stable cell line generation in T-Rex HEK 293 cells. All growth conditions are described in the T-REx manual provided by Invitrogen. FPN1 is C-terminally fused with GFP. Expression of FPN1-GFP is induced by 1-10 ng/mL doxycycline for 1-24 hours. Induced cells are harvested by scraping off from flasks and then washed with 1×PBS. Cell pellets can be stored at −80° C. before use. About five million induced cells are resuspended in 10 mM phosphate buffer with 0.2% Tween-20 and protease inhibitors, e.g., Complete™ Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablet (Roche Diagnostics Corp., Indianapolis, Ind.). Three cycles of freeze/thaw/sonication are used to lyse the cells. The lysate is diluted two-fold with Biacore running buffer and centrifuged to remove debris.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOn Biacore T100, rabbit anti-GFP antibody or goat anti-GFP antibody is immobilized onto \nflow cell\n 1 to 4 of a CMS chip at 5000-15000 Rus. FPN1-GFP is captured onto \n \n \nflow cell\n \n \n 2, 3, or 4 from the lysate of induced cells. Flow \ncell\n 1 is used as reference. Then all flow cells are injected with different concentrations of antibodies to evaluate the binding and kinetics. Surface plasmon resonance based measurements using univalent antigen-binding fragments such as Fabs are generally preferred to those using multivalent antibodies in this assay format to minimize avidity effects. Tables 4a and 4b show the binding characteristics for anti-human FPN1 binding Fabs using rabbit anti-GFP antibody (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif. (catalog #A11122)) and goat anti-GFP antibody (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.

Accordingly, the effect of anti-human FPN1 antibodies on mature hepcidin modulated iron regulation in Caco-2 cells may be determined as follows.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCaco-2 cells are removed from the cell culture vessel using trypsin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). The cells are collected and washed in growth medium (e.g., DMEM+10% FBS+1% non-essential amino acids+1% antibiotics/antimycotic) and collected by gentle centrifugation. Cells are resuspended in culture medium and counted. Cell concentration is adjusted to 1×10\n6 \ncells/mL in growth medium and 2.5 μM Fe:NTA (prepared 1:4 molar ratio) is added to the cells. One hundred μl of cells are added to wells of a 96 flat well plate, followed by incubation for 24 hours at 37° C., 5% CO\n2\n. Mouse IgG\n1\n, a negative control, and two antibodies with different affinities to human FPN1 are prepared in growth medium at 6× the final concentration. Antibody dilutions (25 μL) or medium are added to wells in triplicate. The plates are incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes at which time 25 \nμL\n 5 μM Fe:NTA with or without 600 nM hepcidin (100 nM final concentration) are added to the appropriate wells. The cells are incubated for 24 hours 37° C., 5% CO\n2 \nand then washed 3× with 200 μl Dulbecco's PBS and lysed in 50 μL radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton-X100®, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) plus protease inhibitors, e.g., Complete™ Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablet (Roche Diagnostics Corp., Indianapolis, Ind.), mixed and frozen at −70° C. until assayed for ferritin using an ELISA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBriefly, microtiter plates are coated with 110 μL/well of 1 μg/mL anti-human ferritin (Leinco Technologies, St. Louis, Mo.) and incubated overnight at 4° C. The plates are washed 2 times with wash buffer (0.02 M Tris, 0.15M NaCl, 0.1\n% Tween\n 20, pH 7.4) and blocked with 150 μL of 1% casein in PBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, Ill.). The plates are incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. One hundred microliters (μL) of lysates and standards (human liver ferritin, Calbiochem/EMD Biosciences, La Jolla, Calif.) are added to the appropriate wells and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The plates are washed 3 times and bound ferritin is detected using an anti-ferritin-HRP conjugate (Leinco Technologies) at 1:2000 dilution at 100 μL per well and incubation for 1 hour at room temperature. The plates are washed 4 times and 100 μL OPD substrate (5 mg substrate tablet, dissolved in 12.5 mL of 0.1 M Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 0.05 M citric acid, pH 5.0 with 5 μL of 30% H\n2\nO\n2\n) is dispensed to all wells. The reaction is stopped with 100 μL 1 N HCl after 10 minutes. Absorbance at 490 nm (A\n490\n) is read using an appropriate ELISA plate reader. The protein concentration in each sample is also measured using a BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). To account for possible well-to-well differences in cell number, ferritin concentration data are normalized to protein concentration and the effect of added antibodies is expressed as percent inhibition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExperiments conducted as described in this Example indicate that the effects of human hepcidin-25 on ferritin concentration in the cells are inhibited by Mabs 34A9 and 1G9 (Table 6). Furthermore, the results show that the affinity of the anti-FPN1 Mab has direct implications on its functionality. More specifically, the lower affinity Mab 34A9, even at the highest concentration (200 μg/mL) only slightly inhibited mature hepcidin-induced effects (25% inhibition±0.5%), whereas the higher affinity Mab 1G9 exhibited marked inhibition in a dose-dependent matter.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFerritin (ng)/\n\n\n \n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSample\n\n\nprotein (μg)\n\n\nSTD\n\n\nInhibition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNTA:Fe only\n\n\n5.11\n\n\n0.25\n\n\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNTA + Fe + hepcidin\n\n\n9.95\n\n\n0.86\n\n\n \nNA\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n 200 μg/mL mIgG\n1\n \n\n\n9.40\n\n\n0.25\n\n\n11.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n 100 μg/mL mIgG\n1\n \n\n\n9.78\n\n\n0.68\n\n\n3.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  50 μg/mL mIgG\n1\n \n\n\n10.06\n\n\n0.96\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  25 μg/mL mIgG\n1\n \n\n\n9.6\n\n\n1.29\n\n\n7.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n12.5 μg/mL mIgG\n1\n \n\n\n10.01\n\n\n1.11\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n6.25 μg/mL mIgG\n1\n \n\n\n10.45\n\n\n2.05\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n 200 μg/mL Mab 1G9\n\n\n6.07\n\n\n0.34\n\n\n80.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n 100 μg/mL Mab 1G9\n\n\n5.68\n\n\n0.34\n\n\n88.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  50 μg/mL Mab 1G9\n\n\n7.11\n\n\n0.54\n\n\n58.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n12.5 μg/mL Mab 1G9\n\n\n7.93\n\n\n0.43\n\n\n41.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n6.25 μg/mL Mab 1G9\n\n\n8.02\n\n\n0.45\n\n\n39.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n 200 μg/mL Mab 34A9\n\n\n8.74\n\n\n0.50\n\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  50 μg/mL Mab 34A9\n\n\n9.65\n\n\n0.80\n\n\n6.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis data illustrates that Mabs 1G9 and 34A9 block the ability of human hepcidin-25 to induce internalization and degradation of ferroportin and hence reduce iron exported from the cells.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 6\n\n\nAssay for the Inhibition of Human Hepcidin-25 Binding to FPN1\n\n\n \n \n \nStably transfected FPN-GFP/293 cells are plated in poly-D-lysine coated plates at 60,000 cells per well in 80 μL of assay medium (\nDMEM\n 11965, 10% dialyzed FBS, 20 μM FAC, penicillin-streptomycin) and incubated 4 hours at 37° C., 10% CO\n2\n. Doxycycline is added to a final concentration of 11.2 nM to induce FPN1 expression. Doxycycline induced and un-induced control cells are incubated overnight at 37° C. Next, the growth media is discarded and replaced with test antibody or an isotype control antibody in 30 μL of assay medium or 30 μL of assay medium alone control and incubated at 37° C. for 1 hour. Next, 20 μL of biotinylated mature human hepcidin is added to the wells to a final concentration of 30 nM. The samples are set aside for 1 hour, at 37° C. before washing 4 times with 200 \nμL\n 2% FBS, D-PBS (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). Next, 65 μL of lysing buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mM EDTA) are added and the plates are shaken for 10 minutes. Next, 50 μL of the solution in each well is transferred to individual wells of a streptavidin coated plate (60 μL of 2 μg/mL streptavidin in PBS, incubated at 4° C. overnight, washed 2 times (0.1\n% Tween\n 20, TBS), blocked with casein/PBS), and then incubated for one hour at room temperature. Next, the wells of the plate are washed 3 times (0.1\n% Tween\n 20, TBS) and 50 μL anti-human hepcidin-25 Mab 3.23 at 0.5 μg/mL is added and the samples are incubated one hour at room temperature. The anti-human hepcidin-25 Mab 3.23 is described in PCT International Patent Application Publication WO 2009/058797. Next, the plates are washed three times and 50 μL anti-human IgG-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) is added at 1:2000 dilution. After incubating one hour at room temperature, 50 μL of OPD substrate is added. The reaction is stopped with 100 μL 1 N HCl after 4 minutes.

Such an assay may be based on mature hepcidin-induced internalization and degradation of its receptor, FPN1. For instance, a HEK 293 stable cell line is prepared that allows for the inducible expression of FPN1. FPN1 is C-terminally fused with GFP for tracking purposes. The inducible expression of the FPN1-GFP molecule is controlled using the T-REx system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). The FPN1-GFP coding sequence is cloned into pcDNA4/TO vector, which contains an inducible promoter and a Zeocin resistance marker. The resulting construct is transfected into T-REx-293 cells which expresses the regulatory protein required for doxycycline inducible expression. Zeocin resistant clones are tested for the inducible expression of FPN-GFP. Cell growth conditions are essentially as described in the manufacturer's user manual for the T-REx System (Invitrogen). Briefly, cells are grown in DMEM, 10% dialyzed FBS, 20 μM FAC, plus 5 μg/mL penicillin-streptomycin. Selection is maintained with 100 μg/mL zeocin and 5 μg/mL blasticidin. Cells are plated onto 96-well black/clear plates that are coated with poly-D-lysine. An Acumen Explorer HTS, high resolution fluorescent plate reader is used for reading the total fluorescence per well.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing trypsinization, 96-well assay plate is seeded with 9,000 cells/well using the FPN1-GFP/TREx 293 stable cell line. Seeding volume per well is 80 μL. Cells are allowed to attach overnight. Early the next morning, 9 μL of 30 ng/mL doxycyline is added to each well to induce FPN1-GFP expression. After 8 hours of induction at 37° C., the medium is aspirated and the wells are washed carefully with 150 μL/well of PBS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe desired treatments (e.g., human hepcidin-25 and/or test antibodies) are set up in a 96-well format for quick addition to an assay plate after washing. Final assay volume per well is 45 μL Immediately after adding the treatments, the assay plate is read using the Acumen Explorer (set at 550 volts in channel 1). This reading is generally the 0 hour reading and is used to normalize for cell number per well, which correlates with the total fluorescence units (FLU) per well. For mature human hepcidin-induced internalization and degradation of FPN1, the maximum effect is seen at 0.5 μM mature human hepcidin. The IC\n50 \nof mature human hepcidin is approximately 10 nM. For anti-FPN1 antibody neutralization assays, the human hepcidin-25 concentration is kept at 120 nM and the anti-FPN1 Mabs were tested at 600 nM, 200 nM, 67 nM, 22 nM, and 7.4 nM. The plates are incubated for 24 hours, after which, they are read again, and the data is generated as the ratio of total FLU per well at 24 hours divided by the total FLU per well at 0 hours. All data points are done in quadruplicate. The percent (%) inhibition is determined by subtracting the values for 120 nM mature human hepcidin treatment, and then dividing the FPN1 antibody treated values by the no human hepcidin-25 treated value.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an in vitro assay conducted essentially as described above, human hepcidin-25 bioactivity was neutralized with various anti-FPN1 Mabs with a percent inhibition measured as shown in Table 8 below.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnti-FPN1 Mab Percent (%) Inhibition of Mature Human Hepcidin-\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninduced Internalization and Degradation In Vitro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMab 34A9\n\n\nMab 1G9\n\n\nMab 3D8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMab at 600 nM\n\n\n39.0%\n\n\n67.9%\n\n\n66.4%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMab at 200 nM\n\n\n30.8%\n\n\n62.4%\n\n\n63.8%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMab at 67 nM\n\n\n23.6%\n\n\n61.8%\n\n\n55.7%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMab at 22 nM\n\n\n14.1%\n\n\n49.9%\n\n\n50.2%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMab at 7.4 nM\n\n\n4.8%\n\n\n24.3%\n\n\n28.1%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nData generated in experiments conducted essentially as described in Example 7 support the conclusion that Mabs 1G9, 34A9, and 3D8 greatly inhibit the ability of human hepcidin-25 to cause the internalization and degradation of human FPN1 in vitro.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 8\n\n\nBioactivity of Mab 1G9 Relative to a Control Murine IgG1 following a Single Intravenous Dose to Cynomolgus Monkeys\n\n\n \n \n \nThe physiological effects of anti-human FPN1 murine Mab 1G9 on serum hepcidin and serum iron levels were investigated by administering the Mab as a single intravenous dose to male Cynomolgus monkeys (\nMacaca fascicularis; \n3-4 kg) and comparing its effects to a control administration of murine IgG1. Following administration blood samples were collected for analysis of serum iron and serum hepcidin. The dose (30 mg/kg) was administered as an injection via a saphenous vein. Immediately after dose administration, but before the needle was removed from the animal, the dose apparatus was flushed with approximately 2 mL of saline.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nConcentration\n\n\nVolume\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(mg/mL)\n\n\n(mL/kg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nMurine IgG1 Control\n\n\n9.53\n\n\n3.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nMurine 1G9\n\n\n12.6\n\n\n2.38\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSampling for Serum Hepcidin:\n\n\n \n \n \nBlood was collected prior to dosing and at 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 10, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 168 hours post-dose. Blood (approximately 0.5 mL) was collected via a femoral vein into tubes containing no anticoagulant. Blood was allowed to clot under ambient conditions prior to centrifugation to obtain serum. Serum samples were placed on dry ice prior to storage at approximately −70° C.\n\n\n \nSampling for Serum Iron:\n\n\n \n \n \nBlood was collected prior to dosing and at 1, 3, 6, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 168 hours post-dose. All blood samples were collected, handled, processed, stored, and analyzed in accordance with methods considered acceptable within the medical community. Serum iron levels may be measured by any method known in the art which is generally considered within the medical community to be an acceptable method of measuring total serum iron (Fe). Serum concentrations of hepcidin were determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry essentially as described in Murphy, et al., Blood, 110:1048-54 (2007). Assays for measuring serum iron are well-known in the art (see, for example, Goodwin, J. F., et al., Clinical Chemistry 12: 47-57 (1966), and J. Clin. Path., 24:334-335 (1971)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSerum hepcidin concentrations were unaffected by the administration of control murine IgG1 and ranged from 1.5 to 31 ng/mL over the time course studied. Average hepcidin levels in the control animals were 11.5±8.8 ng/mL (mean±SD). After administration of murine Mab 1G9, serum hepcidin levels were elevated from a baseline of 7.6 and 14.7 ng/mL to a peak of 49.7 and 79.1 ng/mL, respectively. The peak in serum hepcidin occurred approximately 10 hours after administration of the murine Mab 1G9 (\nFIG. 6\n). The elevation of serum hepcidin is likely due to the interaction of murine Mab 1G9 with its target FPN1, which, upon binding to FPN1 blocks the interaction of FPN1 and hepcidin, thereby slowing FPN1 clearance and/or internalization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSerum iron was not elevated in animals treated with control murine IgG and ranged from 64 to 97 μg/dL over the time frame studied. After administration of murine Mab 1G9, serum iron levels were elevated from a baseline of 136 and 144 μg/dL to a peak of 306 and 292 μg/dL, respectively. The peak in serum iron occurred approximately 48 hrs after administration of murine Mab 1G9 (\nFIG. 7\n). Serum iron levels gradually returned to baseline by 96 hours after administration, indicating that the elevation of serum iron levels is irreversible.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 9\n\n\nCell-Based Assay for Anti-FPN1 Antibody Inhibition of Hepcidin-25-Induced Internalization and Degradation\n\n\n \n \n \nExperiments conducted essentially as described in Example 7 above demonstrate that Mabs Combi-11, 4A10-3, and L2.2-4 inhibit human hepcidin-25 induced internalization and degradation of human FPN1 more effectively in vitro as compared with Mabs 34A9, 3D8, and 1G9 (see Table 10). More specifically, the anti-FPN1 Mabs were tested in a 9-point concentration curve starting at 900 nM and performing 3-fold serial dilutions. The percent (%) inhibition was determined by subtracting the values for 120 nM hepcidin treatment, and then dividing the Mab treated values by the no hepcidin treated value.

For example, in five independent studies Mab 4A10\n−3 \nwas administered to Cynomolgus monkeys as a single intravenous bolus (n=4/group) at doses of 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, 10 and 30 mg/kg. Blood samples (approximately 0.5 mL for iron parameters) were taken prior to the first dose and at 1, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 168 and 264 hours post-dose. At higher dose levels, additional blood samples were taken at 360, 456, 552, and 648 hours post-dose. At the time of dosing, the animals weighed between 2 to 3 kg. Blood samples were collected from each animal via a femoral vein into tubes containing no anticoagulant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSerum iron concentration-time profiles following intravenous administration of 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, 10 and 30 mg/kg Mab 4A10-3 to male Cynomolgus monkeys was associated with a dose dependent increase in serum iron which peaked at 24 hours after dosing. Peak iron responses (approximately 2-fold increase) and duration of response between the mg/kg and 30 mg/kg doses were similar. In the animals administered 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 mg/kg doses serum iron returned to baseline values about 48 hours after dosing. In the animals administered 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg doses, serum iron returned to baseline values about 72 hours after dosing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, in a single study, administration of a single subcutaneous injection of Mab 4A10-3 at a dose of 10 mg/kg produced an identical response (n=2; mean±SD) in serum iron, in both intensity and duration, as observed after the equivalent intravenous dose (n=4; mean±SD).\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 11\n\n\nPharmacokinetics of Humanized Anti-Ferroportin Monoclonal Antibodies in Rats and Cynomolgus Monkeys\n\n\n \n \n \nThe pharmacokinetics of anti-ferroportin Mabs may be studied in vivo according methods well-known to those skilled in the art. The pharmacokinetics of anti-FPN1 Mabs 4A10-3 and \nCombi\n 11 were investigated after single intravenous doses to male Cynomolgus monkeys and Sprague Dawley rats, for example. At the time of dosing the Cynomolgus monkeys used weighed between 2.2 and 5.5 kg and the Sprague Dawley rats weighed between 240 and 265 g.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmacokinetic study conducted in Cynomolgus monkeys was performed in three phases, with doses at 1.0 mg/kg, 3.0 mg/kg, and 0.3 mg/kg administered at approximately 2 week intervals. At each phase, either Mab 4A10-3 or Mab Combi11 was administered as a single intravenous bolus (n=4 per group). Blood samples were taken prior to the first dose and at 1, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 168, and 264 hours post-dose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn rats, Mab 4A10-3 or \nMab Combi\n 11 was administered as a single intravenous bolus dose of 3 mg/kg (n=3 per group). Serial blood samples were taken prior to dose and at 0.08, 1, 4, 8, 24, 48, 72, 120 and 168 hours post-dose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSerum concentrations of Mabs 4A10-3 and \nCombi\n 11 were determined using a human IgG sandwich ELISA format. The standard curve range was 5 to 400 ng/mL, with a working lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) defined as 10 ng/mL. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using non-compartmental analysis in WinNonlin version 5.2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSerum concentration-time profiles following intravenous administration to male Cynomolgus monkeys are plotted in \nFIG. 10\n. Mab 4A10-3 was cleared much more slowly (approximately 5-fold) than Mab Combi11 at all doses studied. Differences were apparent at the first time point examined (1 hour) when serum concentrations of Mab Combi11 were approximately 50% of that observed for Mab 4A10-3. At 24 hours post-dose, serum concentrations of Mab 4A10-3 were 20-33% of Cmax compared to only 6-9% for Combi11. Peripheral concentrations of Mab Combi11 were not evident after the 0.3 mg/kg dose. The clearance of Mab 4A10-3 was somewhat faster at the two lower doses compared to the 3 mg/kg dose. The T\n1/2 \nfor Mab 4A10-3 ranged from 2 to 3 days. However, the T\n1/2 \nfor Mab Combi11 ranged from about 12 to about 27 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe enhanced clearance of Mab Combi11 relative to Mab 4A10-3 was hypothesized to result from increased non-specific interactions of Mab Combi11 with cell surface proteins which do not occur for Mab 4A10-3. In order to evaluate this hypothesis the pharmacokinetics of Mab 4A10-3 and Mab Combi11 was studied in rats since neither Mab binds effectively to rat ferroportin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSerum concentration-time profiles following intravenous administration to male rats are plotted in \nFIG. 11\n. Similar to the observation in primates, Mab 4A10-3 cleared more slowly (approximately 5-fold) than Mab Combi11 in rats (data not shown). Again, differences were apparent at the first time point examined (0.08 hours) when serum concentrations of Mab Combi11 were approximately 50% of that observed for Mab 4A10-3. The T\n1/2 \nfor Mab 4A10-3 and Mab Combi11 was approximately 4.5 days and 3 days, respectively, in rats (data not shown).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese data strongly suggest that the more rapid clearance observed for Mab Combi11 was not attributable to target receptor-mediated clearance since neither Mab 4A10-3 nor Mab Combi11 binds rat ferroportin.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 12\n\n\nAnti-Human FPN1 Mabs with Delayed Clearance and/or Low Non-Specific (Heparin) Binding\n\n\n \n \n \nThe pharmacokinetic studies of Mab Combi11 described above in Example 11 suggested that Mab Combi11 was more rapidly cleared from serum as compared to Mab 4A10-3. The data also suggested that the more rapid clearance of Mab Combi11 as compared to Mab 4A10-3 was not attributable to increased target receptor-mediated clearance of Mab Combi11 relative to that of Mab 4A10-3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBecause multiple arginine residues had been introduced during the engineering of Mab Combi11, it was suspected that the resulting increase in positive charge of Mab Combi11 as compared with Mab 4A10-3, for example, resulted in increased undesirable non-specific binding to negatively-charged membrane surfaces and to heparin. Indeed, modeling of the structure of Mab Combi11 showed a strong positively-charged patch on the surface of Mab Combi11 which was more pronounced in Mab Combi11 than some of the other human engineered anti-FPN1 Mabs, including Mab 4A10-3 and Mab L2.2-4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMabs Combi11, 4A10-3, and L2.2-4 were tested for non-specific heparin binding using a heparin ELISA according to methods known to one skilled in the art. Mabs Combi11, 4A10-3, 3D8, and L2.2-4 were also tested for binding to human FPN1 expressing HEK 293 cells as well as to control HEK 293 cells lacking human FPN1 expressed on the cell surface.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe heparin ELISA using Mab Combi-11 showed that Mab Combi11 binds strongly to heparin whereas Mabs 4A10-3 and L2.2-4 did not. Furthermore, Mab Combi-11 also bound strongly to both human FPN1 expressing HEK 293 cells and control HEK 293 cells lacking human FPN1 expressed on the cell surface. On the other hand, Mabs 4A10-3, 3D8, and L2.2-4 significantly bound to human FPN1 expressing HEK 293 cells but not to the control HEK 293 cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMab Com11GY was therefore generated to reduce the non-specific binding observed with Mab Combi11 by replacing the arginine amino acid residue in the HCDR2 with a glycine amino acid residue. In addition, another potentially problematic amino acid residue found in Mab Combi11, the tryptophan amino acid residue in the LCDR2, was substituted with a tyrosine amino acid residue in Mab Com11GY. Preliminary binding data, using supernatants from cells expressing Mabs Com11GY, demonstrated a lack of non-specific binding to control HEK 293 cells, i.e., human FPN1 non-expressing cells, whereas both Mabs 1B7 and 1F8 demonstrated significantly more non-specific binding to the same control cells.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 13\n\n\nAssay for the Inhibition of Human Hepcidin-25 Binding to FPN1\n\n\n \n \n \nHuman engineered, affinity matured anti-human FPN1 antibodies may be assayed for the ability to inhibit human hepcidin-25 binding to human FPN1 expressed in HEK 293 cells. Briefly, transfected FPN/293 cells are plated in poly-D-lysine coated plates on 96 well plates (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif.; BD Biocoat plates #35 4640) at 40,000 cells per well in 80 μL of assay medium (\nDMEM\n 11965, 10% dialyzed FBS, 20 μM FAC, penicillin-streptomycin), centrifuged for 1 minute at 1000 revolutions per minute, and then incubated 4 hours at 37° C., 10% CO\n2\n. FPN1 expression is induced by adding 20 μL of Doxycycline at 10 nM to the plated cells (2 nM final concentration of doxycycline. Doxycyline induced and un-induced control cells are incubated for 5 hours at 37° C., 10% CO\n2\n. Next, the inducing agent is removed by washing the \nplate\n 2× with DMEM. The cells are incubated overnight in 100 μL of assay medium. Next, the assay media is removed and replaced with 40 μL test antibody or an isotype control antibody solution in triplicate and incubated at 37° C., 10% CO\n2 \nfor 20 minutes. Next, 20 μL of biotinylated mature human hepcidin is added to the wells to a final concentration of 30 nM per well. The samples are incubated for 1 hour, at 37° C., 10% 10% CO\n2 \nbefore washing 4 times with 200 \nμL\n 2% FBS, D-PBS (Gibco, catalog no. 14040). Next, 65 μL of lysing buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mM EDTA) are added to all the wells and the plates are shaken for 10 minutes. Next, 50 μL of the solution in each well is transferred to individual wells of a streptavidin coated Greiner microtiter plate (60 μL of 2 μg/mL streptavidin (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.; catalog no. 54762) in PBS, incubated at 4° C. overnight, washed 2 times (0.1\n% Tween\n 20, TBS), blocked with casein/PBS), and then incubated for one hour at room temperature. Next, the wells of the plate are washed 3 times (0.1\n% Tween\n 20, TBS) and 50 μL anti-human hepcidin-25 Mab 3.23 at 0.5 μg/mL is added and the samples are incubated one hour at room temperature. The anti-human hepcidin-25 Mab 3.23 is described in PCT International Patent Application Publication WO 2009/058797. Next, the plates are washed three times and 50 μL of goat anti-human IgG-horseradish peroxidase (Southern Biotech catalog no. 2060-05) is added at 1:2000 dilution. After incubating one hour at room temperature, the plate is washed 4× and 50 μL of OPD substrate (Sigma; catalog no. P6912) is added. The reaction is stopped with 100 μL 1 N HCl after 4 minutes. Absorbance at 490 nm (A\n490\n) is read using an appropriate ELISA plate reader. The assay range is determined by subtracting the A\n490 \nof un-induced wells from the induced wells receiving control antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe data shown in Table 11 demonstrate that humanized Mab 3D8 and affinity matured variants thereof significantly inhibit the ability of human hepcidin-25 to bind human FPN1. More specifically, Mab 3D8, a humanized form of the mouse Mab 1G9, having the human heavy chain framework VH1-69 and light chain framework O2, demonstrated an IC\n50 \nof about 400 nM as determined in this assay format. Affinity matured Mabs 4A10-3, Combi11, and L2.2-4 demonstrated significantly improved inhibition of binding as determined in this assay format.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n% Inhibition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAntibody concentration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntibody\n\n\n \n\n\n2000 nM\n\n\n500 nM\n\n\n125 nM\n\n\n31.25 nM\n\n\n7.8 nM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3D8\n\n\nMean\n\n\n54.7\n\n\n64.7\n\n\n21.8\n\n\n4.0\n\n\n−2.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSD\n\n\n9.0\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n14.9\n\n\n11.5\n\n\n2.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4A10-3\n\n\nMean\n\n\n95.3\n\n\n84.9\n\n\n59.3\n\n\n13.4\n\n\n5.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSD\n\n\n2.1\n\n\n1.7\n\n\n6.4\n\n\n4.2\n\n\n14.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \ncombi\n 11\n\n\nMean\n\n\n79.9\n\n\n81.6\n\n\n88.4\n\n\n32.1\n\n\n18.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSD\n\n\n9.0\n\n\n8.8\n\n\n4.8\n\n\n3.1\n\n\n8.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL2.2-4\n\n\nMean\n\n\n85.1\n\n\n99.8\n\n\n76.5\n\n\n27.5\n\n\n−0.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSD\n\n\n20.8\n\n\n6.5\n\n\n9.3\n\n\n3.9\n\n\n2.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontrol IgG\n\n\nMean\n\n\n−2.5\n\n\n−0.7\n\n\n1.9\n\n\n7.9\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSD\n\n\n5.8\n\n\n10.3\n\n\n6.2\n\n\n6.5\n\n\n14.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n75 kg/mole was the molecular weight used to calculate the antibody concentration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 14\n\n\nIn Vitro Assay of the Effects of FPN1 Mabs on Cellular Ferritin Levels\n\n\n \n \n \nAs described in Example 5, Caco-2 cells, a human enterocyte cell line, endogenously expressing FPN1, may be monitored for changes in ferritin.
