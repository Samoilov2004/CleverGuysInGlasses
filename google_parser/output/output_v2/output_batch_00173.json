Description\n\n\n\n\n AMINODIHYDROTHIAZINE DERIVATIVES AS BACE INHIBITORS FOR THE TREATMENT OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE\n\n\nThe present invention is in the field of treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other diseases and disorders involving amyloid β (Aβ) peptide, a neurotoxic and highly aggregatory peptide segment of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Specifically provided are potent inhibitors of β-secretase or β-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme (BACE). Complete or partial inhibition of BACE has been shown to have a significant effect on plaque-related and plaque-dependent pathologies in mouse models suggesting that even small reductions in Aβ levels might result in long-term significant reduction in plaque burden and synaptic deficits, thus providing significant therapeutic benefits.\n\n\nCurrently described BACE inhibitors are peptidomimetic transition state analogs, typically containing a hydroxy ethyl moiety. Although many of these compounds are potent inhibitors of BACE, their high molecular weights and low membrane permeability make them poor drug candidates. There has been a progression from large peptidomimetic molecules to small molecules, such as a variety of hydroxy ethylamine scaffolds as well as heterocyclic-containing scaffolds. See e.g., Durham and Shepherd, Current Opinion in Drug Discovery & Development, 9(6), 776-791 (2006)). Certain aminothiazine compounds have been described as BACE inhibitors in WO 2007/049532.\n\n\nBACE inhibitors that are potent and more efficacious are necessary to provide treatments for Aβ pepti de-mediated disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease. The present invention provides new potent and efficacious inhibitors of BACE.\n\n\nThe present invention provides compounds of Formula I:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere: \n\n n is 0, 1, or 2;\n\n\nR\n1\n is pyrimidinyl, pyrazinyl optionally substituted with chloro or fluoro, or pyridinyl optionally substituted with one or two substituents each independently selected from chloro, fluoro, and C\n1\n-C\n3\n alkoxy;\n\n\nR is at each instance independently selected from chloro and fluoro; R\n3\n is hydrogen or Ci-C\n4\n alkyl optionally substituted with hydroxy; and\n\n\nR\n4\n is hydrogen or C\n1\n-C\n3\n alkyl; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\n\n\nThe present invention also provides a method of treating Alzheimer's disease in a patient comprising administering to a patient in need of such treatment an effective amount of a compound of Formula I.\n\n\nThe present invention further provides a method of preventing the progression of mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease in a patient comprising administering to a patient in need of such treatment an effective amount of a compound of Formula I.\n\n\nThe present invention further provides a method of preventing the progression in a patient at risk for developing Alzheimer's disease comprising administering to a patient in need of such treatment an effective amount of a compound of Formula I. The present invention also provides a method of inhibiting BACE in a patient comprising administering to a patient in need of such treatment an effective amount of a compound of Formula I.\n\n\nThe present invention also provides a method for inhibiting β-secretase mediated cleavage of amyloid precursor protein comprising administering to a patient in need of such treatment an effective amount of a compound of Formula I.\n\n\nThe present invention further provides a method for the inhibition of production of Aβ peptide comprising administering to a patient in need of such treatment an effective amount of a compound of Formula I.\n\n\nThe present invention also provides a pharmaceutical formulation comprising a compound of Formula I, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent, or excipient. \n\n Furthermore, this invention provides a compound of Formula I for use in therapy, in particular for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease or for the prevention of the progression of mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease. This invention also provides the use of a compound of Formula I for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. This invention further provides the use of a compound of Formula I for the manufacture of a medicament for the prevention of the progression of mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease. The invention also provides the use of a compound of Formula I for the manufacture of a medicament for the inhibition of BACE. The invention further provides the use of a compound of Formula I for the manufacture of a medicament for the inhibition of production of Aβ peptide.\n\n\nAdditionally, this invention provides a pharmaceutical formulation adapted for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, this invention provides a pharmaceutical formulation adapted for the prevention of the progression of mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease. This invention also provides a pharmaceutical formulation adapted for the inhibition of BACE.\n\n\nFurthermore the present invention provides a pharmaceutical formulation adapted for the inhibition of β-secretase mediated cleavage of amyloid precursor protein. The present invention also provides a pharmaceutical formulation adapted for the treatment of conditions resulting from excessive levels of Aβ peptide comprising a compound of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, carriers, or diluents.\n\n\nThe general chemical terms used in the formulae above have their usual meanings. For example, the term \"C\n1\n-C\n3\n alkyl\" refers to methyl, ethyl, propyl, and isopropyl. The term \"Ci-C\n4\n alkyl\" refers to methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, and tert-butyl moieties.\n\n\n\"Ci-C\n4\n alkyl optionally substituted with hydroxy\" is a Ci-C\n4\n alkyl group wherein one of the hydrogen atoms is replaced with a hydroxy moiety.\n\n\nThe term \"C\n1\n-C\n3\n alkoxy\" is a C\n1\n-C\n3\n alkyl group bonded to an oxygen atom and refers to methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, and ώo-propoxy. \n\n -A-\n\n\nThe term \"nitrogen protecting group\" is taken to mean a moiety that is stable to projected reaction conditions and yet may be selectively removed by reagents and reaction conditions compatible with the regenerated amine. Such groups are well known by the skilled artisan and are described in the literature. See, e.g., Greene and Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Third Edition, Chapter 7, John Wiley and Sons Inc., (1999).\n\n\nThe term \"inhibition of production of Aβ peptide\" is taken to mean decreasing of in vivo levels of Aβ peptide in a patient to normal, if excessive, or sub-normal levels, as required. The term \"effective amount of a compound of Formula I\" is taken to mean the dose or doses of a compound of Formula I required to inhibit BACE sufficiently to decrease in vivo levels of Aβ peptide in a patient to normal or sub-normal levels.\n\n\nThe term \"treatment\" is taken to include slowing or arresting the progression of the disease in a patient. Mild cognitive impairment has been defined as a potential prodromal phase of dementia associated with Alzheimer's disease based on clinical presentation and on progression of patients exhibiting mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's dementia over time. (Morris, et al, Arch. Neurol, 58, 397-405 (2001); Petersen, et al., Arch. Neurol, 56, 303-308 (1999)). The term \"prevention of the progression of mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease\" includes slowing, arresting, or reversing the progression of mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease in a patient.\n\n\nThe skilled artisan will appreciate that compounds of Formula I can exist in tautomeric forms, as depicted in Figure (1). When any reference in this application to one of the specific tautomers of the compounds of formula I is given, it is understood to encompass both tautomeric forms and all mixtures thereof.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure (1) \n\n The skilled artisan will appreciate that compounds of Formula I are comprised of a core that contains at least one chiral center:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure (2)\n\n\nAlthough the present invention contemplates all individual enantiomers, as well as mixtures of the enantiomers of said compounds including racemates, the compounds with the absolute configuration at the atom labeled 1 as illustrated in Figure (2) are preferred compounds of Formula I.\n\n\n \n\n Figure (3)\n\n\nFurther, when appropriately substituted, the compounds with the absolute configuration of the atom labeled 2, as illustrated in Figure (3), are preferred compounds of Formula I.\n\n\nAdditionally, the skilled artisan will appreciate that additional chiral centers may be created in the compounds of the invention by the selection of certain variables. The present invention contemplates all individual enantiomers or diastereomers, as well as mixtures of the enantiomers and diastereomers of said compounds including racemates.\n\n\nThe skilled artisan will also appreciate that the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (R) or (S) designations for all chiral centers will vary depending upon the substitution patterns of the particular compound. The single enantiomers or diastereomers may be prepared beginning with chiral reagents or by stereoselective or stereospecific synthetic techniques. Alternatively, the single enantiomers or diastereomers may be isolated from mixtures by \n\n standard chiral chromatographic or crystallization techniques at any convenient point in the synthesis of compounds of the invention. Single enantiomers and diastereomers of compounds of the invention are a preferred embodiment of the invention.\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention are amines, and accordingly react with any of a number of inorganic and organic acids to form pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts and common methodology for preparing them are well known in the art. See, e.g., P. Stahl, et al. Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection and Use, (VCHA/Wiley-VCH, 2002); S.M. Berge, et al, \"Pharmaceutical Salts,\" Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Vol. 66, No. 1, January 1977. Preferred pharmaceutically acceptable salts are those formed with hydrochloric acid.\n\n\nAlthough all of the compounds of Formula I are useful inhibitors of BACE, certain classes of compounds are preferred.

It will be recognized by one of skill in the art that the individual steps in the following schemes may be varied to provide the compounds of Formula I. The particular order of steps required to produce the compounds of Formula I is dependent upon the particular compound being synthesized, the starting compound, and the relative lability of the substituted moieties. The products of each step in the schemes below can be recovered by conventional methods, including extraction, evaporation, precipitation, chromatography, filtration, trituration, and crystallization. Certain stereochemical centers have been left unspecified and certain substituents have been eliminated in the following schemes for the sake of clarity and are not intended to limit the teaching of the schemes in any way. Furthermore, individual isomers, enantiomers, or diastereomers may be separated at any convenient point in the synthesis of compounds of Formula I by methods such as chiral chromatography. Additionally, the intermediates described in the following schemes contain a number of nitrogen protecting groups. The variable protecting group may be the same or \n\n different in each occurance depending on the particular reaction conditions and the particular transformations to be performed. The protection and deprotection conditions are well known to the skilled artisan and are described in the literature. See. e.g., Greene and Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, supra.

For example, the PDAPP mouse model, prepared as described in Games et al., Nature 373, 523-527 (1995), and other non-transgenic or gene knockout animals are useful to analyze in vivo inhibition of Abeta and sAPPbeta production in the presence of inhibitory compounds. Generally, 2 to 12 month old PDAPP mice, gene knockout mice or non-transgenic animals are administered compound formulated in vehicles, such as corn oil, cyclodextran, phosphate buffers, PHARMASOLVE®, or other suitable vehicles. One to twenty- four hours following the administration of compound, animals are sacrificed, and brains as well as cerebrospinal fluid and plasma are removed for analysis of Abetas, C99 and sAPP fragments. (See Dovey, et al., Journal ofNeurochemistry, 76, 173-181 (2001); and Johnson- Wood, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. ScL USA, 94, 1550-1555 (1997)).\n\n\nFor standard efficacy studies, animals are dosed with various concentrations of compound and compared to a vehicle-treated control group dosed at the same time. For \n\n some time course studies, brain tissue, plasma or cerebrospinal fluid is obtained from selected animals, beginning at time 0 to establish a baseline. Compound is administered to other groups and sacrificed at various times after dosing. Brain tissue, plasma or cerebrospinal fluid is obtained from selected animals and analyzed for the presence of APP cleavage products, including Abeta peptides, sAPPbeta and other APP fragments, for example, by specific sandwich ELISA assays. At the end of the test period, animals are sacrificed and brain tissues, plasma or cerebrospinal fluid are analyzed for the presence of Abeta peptides, C99 and sAPPbeta. Brain tissues of APP transgenic animals are also analyzed for the amount of beta-amyloid plaques following compound treatment.\n\n\nAnimals (PDAPP or other APP transgenic or non-trans genie mice) administered an inhibitory compound may demonstrate the reduction of Abeta or sAPPbeta in brain tissues, plasma or cerebrospinal fluids and decrease of beta amyloid plaques in brain tissue, as compared with vehicle-treated controls or Time Zero controls. For example, 3 hours after administration of 100 mg/kg sub-cutaneous dose of the compound of example 19 to young male PDAPP mice, Abeta 1-x peptide, C99 and sAPPb levels are reduced approximately 30%, 50% and 20% in brain cortex, respectively, compared to vehicle- treated mice. Similarly, 3 hours after administration of a 30 mg/kg sub-cutaneous dose of the compound of example 5 to young male PDAPP mice, Abeta 1-x peptide, C99 and sAPPb levels are reduced approximately 50%, 45% and 30%, respectively, compared to vehicle-treated mice. Consistent with changes in brain Abeta, C99 and sAPPb, 3 hours after oral administration of a 10 mg/kg dose of the compound of example 5, plasma and CSF Abeta 1-x levels are reduced by approximately 50% and 60%, respectively. \n\n\n\n\nA compound exemplified in WO 2007/049532 and its enantiomers were tested as essentially described in the above assays and exhibit the following activities:\n\n\nTable 29 17 \n\n\n\n\n\n \n17\n All data in Table 29 are reported as IC50 (nM). The compounds of the present invention are preferably formulated as pharmaceutical compositions administered by a variety of routes. Most preferably, such compounds are for oral administration. Such pharmaceutical compositions and processes for preparing same are well known in the art. See, e.g., Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy (A. Gennaro, et. ah, eds., 19\nth\n ed., Mack Publishing Co., 1995). \n\n The compounds of Formula I are generally effective over a wide dosage range. For example, dosages per day normally fall within the range of about 0.01 to about 30 mg/kg of body weight. In some instances dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range may be more than adequate, while in other cases still larger doses may be employed without causing any harmful side effect, and therefore the above dosage range is not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any way. It will be understood that the amount of the compound actually administered will be determined by a physician, in the light of the relevant circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the actual compound or compounds administered, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, and the severity of the patient's symptoms."
