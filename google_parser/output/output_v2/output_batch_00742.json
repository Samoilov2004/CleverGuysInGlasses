Description\n\n\n\n\n TITLE OF THE INVENTION \n\n\nSUBSTITUTED PYRJMIDINES \n\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS \n\n\n This application claims the benefit of International Application No. \n\n\n PCT/CN2010/071974, filed April 21, 2010, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. \n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n The insufficient delivery of oxygen to cells and tissues is associated with anemia, which is defined as a deficiency in the blood's oxygen-carrying capacity, and ischemia, in which restrictions in blood supply are caused by a constriction or blockage of blood vessels. Anemia can be caused by the loss of red blood cells (hemorrhage), excessive red blood cell destruction (hemolysis) or deficiencies in erythropoiesis (production of red blood cells from precursors found in the bone marrow). The symptoms of anemia can include weakness, dizziness, fatigue, pallor, impairment of cognitive function and a genera] reduction in quality of life. Chronic and/or severe anemia can lead to the exacerbation of myocardial, cerebral or peripheral ischemia and to heart failure. Ischemia is defined as an absolute or relative shortage of oxygen to a tissue or organ and can result from disorders such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, thromboembolisms, hypotension, etc. The heart, brain and kidney are especially sensitive to ischemic stress caused by low blood supply. \n\n\n The primary pharmacological treatment for anemia is administration of some variant of recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO). For anemias associated with kidney disease, chemotherapy- induced anemia, anemia from HTV-therapy or anemia due to blood loss, recombinant EPO is administered to enhance the supply of the hormone, correct the shortage of red blood cells and increase the blood's oxygen-carrying capacity. EPO replacement is not always sufficient to stimulate optimal erythropoiesis (e.g., in patients with iron processing deficiencies) and has associated risks. \n\n\n Hypoxia-inducible factor (HTF) has been identified as a primary regulator of the cellular response to low oxygen. HTJF is a heterodimeric gene transcription factor consisting of a highly regulated a-subunit (HEF-a) and a constitutively expressed Î²-subunit (HIF-Î², also known as ARNT, or aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear transporter). HTF target genes are reported to be associated with various aspects of erythropoiesis (e.g., erythropoietin (EPO) and EPO receptor), glycolysis and angiogenesis (e.g., vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)). Genes for proteins involved in iron absorption, transport and utilization as well as heme synthesis are also targets of H1F. \n\n\n Under normal oxygenation, HTF-a is a substrate in a reaction with molecular oxygen, which is catalyzed by a family of iron(TJ)-, 2-ketoglutarate- and ascorbate-dependent dioxygenase enzymes called PHD-1 (EGLN2, or egg laying abnormal 9 homolog 2, PHD2 (EGLN1), and PHD3 (EGLN3). Proline residues of HTF-a are hydroxylated (e.g., Pro-402 and Pro-564 of HIF-ÎÎ±) and the resulting product is a target of the tumor suppressor protein von-Hippel Lindau, a component of an E3 \n\n ubiquhin ligase multiprotein complex involved in protein ubiquitination. Under low oxygenation, the HEF-a hydroxylation reaction is less efficient and HIF- a is available to dimerize with HIF-Î². HEF dimers are translocated to the cell nucleus where they bind to a hypoxia-responsive enhancer element of HIF target genes. \n\n\n Cellular levels of HIF are known to increase under conditions of hypoxia and after exposure to hypoxia mimetic agents. The latter includes, but is not limited to, specific metal ions (e.g., cobalt, nickel, manganese), iron chelators (e.g., desferrioxamine) and analogs of 2-ketoglurate (e.g., N- oxaryl glycine). The compounds of the present invention inhibit the HIF prolyl hydroxylases (PHD-1 , PHD-2, PHD-3) and can also serve to modulate HIF levels. These compounds therefore have utility for the treatment and/or prevention of disorders or conditions where HIF modulation is desirable, such as anemia and ischemia. As an alternative to recombinant erythropoietin therapy, the compounds of the present invention provide a simpler and broader method for the management of anemia. \n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n The present invention concerns compounds of formula I \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhich inhibit HIF prolyl hydroxylase, their use for enhancing endogenous production of erythropoietin, and for treating conditions associated with reduced endogenous production of erythropoietin such as anemia and like conditions, as well as pharmaceutical compositions comprising such a compound and a pharmaceutical carrier. \n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n The present invention provides compounds of formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and solvates thereof: \n\n\nwherein \n\n\n\n\n\n A is heteroaryl optionally substituted with one or more R? substituents \n\n\n L is chosen from a bond, aryl, heteroaryl, -(C1.3 alkyl)o-iS(Ci-3 alkyl)o-l-, -(C1.3 alkylJo-lNRaCO-, (Ci-3 alkyl)0-lNRaCO2-, -(C1.3 alkyl)0-lCO2-, -(Cj.3 alkyl)0-lNRaSO2-, -(C1.3 alkylJo. iNRaO-, -(C1.3 alky o-lNRaCsNRb., - Ci-3 alkyl)0-lNRaCONRb-, and -(C1.3 alkyl)o- iNRaCOS-;

As used herein, the term \"solvate\" refers to a complex of variable stoichiometry formed by a solute (i.e., a compound of Formula I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a solvent that does not interfere with the biological activity of the solute. Examples of solvents include, but are not limited to water, ethanol, and acetic acid. When the solvent is water, the solvate is known as hydrate; hydrate includes, but is not limited to, hemi-, mono, sesqui-, di- and trihydrates. \n\n\nProdrugs \n\n\n The present invention includes within its scope the use of prodrugs of the compounds of this invention. In general, such prodrugs will be functional derivatives of the compounds of mis invention which are readily convertible in vivo into the required compound. Thus, in the methods of treatment of the present invention, the term \"administering\" shall encompass the treatment of the various conditions described with a compound of formula I or with a compound which may not be a compound of formula L, but which converts to a compound of formula I in vivo after administration to the patient Conventional procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable prodrug derivatives are described, for example, in \"Design of Prodrugs,\" ed. H. Bundgaard, Elsevier, 1985. \n\n\n In the compounds of generic Formula I, the atoms may exhibit their natural isotopic abundances, or one or more of the atoms may be artificially enriched in a particular isotope having the same atomic number, but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number predominantly found in nature. The present invention is meant to include all suitable isotopic variations of the compounds of generic Formula I. For example, different isotopic forms of hydrogen (H) include protium (lH) and deuterium (2H). Protium is the predominant hydrogen isotope found in nature. Enriching for deuterium may afford certain therapeutic advantages, such as increasing in vivo half-life or reducing dosage requirements, or may provide a compound useful as a standard for characterization of biological samples. \n\n\nIsotopically-enriched compounds within generic Formula I can be prepared without undue experimentation by conventional techniques well known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the Schemes and Examples herein using appropriate isotopically-enriched reagents and/or intermediates. \n\n\nUtilities \n\n\n Compounds of the present invention are inhibitors of hypoxia-inducible factor (RTF) prolyl hydroxylases, and as such are useful in the treatment and prevention of diseases and conditions in which HIF modulation is desirable, such as anemia and ischemia.

The illustrative schemes below, therefore, are not limited by the compounds listed or by any particular substituents employed for illustrative purposes. Substituent numbering as shown in the schemes does not necessarily correlate to that used in the claims and often, for clarity, a single substituent is shown attached to the compound in place of multiple substituents which are allowed under the definitions of Formula I defined previously. \n\n\n The following schemes and descriptions illustrate methods which may be employed for the synthesis of the novel compounds described in this invention. All substituents are as defined above unless indicated otherwise. Several strategies based upon synthetic transformations known in the literature of organic synthesis may be employed for the preparation of the title compounds of general formula I. The choice of the method employed is influenced by the selection of the desired substituent groups (R\n1\n through R\n3\n, L and A) in the title of formula I. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Pyrimidine intermediates useful for the preparation of compounds of formula I of the present invention are either purchased or prepared using suitable procedures reported in the literature (sometimes with minor modifications). One generally useful method for the synthesis of pyrimidines suitable for the preparation of the title compounds of general formula I wherein the substituent R3 is a hydroxy] group is illustrated in Scheme 1. \n\n\nScheme Â¾ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This method involves the initial synthesis of substituted 4-hydroxypyrimidine-5- carboxylates of general formula 1S-4 and 1S-6. The synthesis of 4-hydroxypyrimidine-5-carboxylates exemplified in scheme 1 is based upon reported methods (Dostert, P.; Imbert, T.; Ancher, J.F.; Langlois, M.; Bucher, B.; Mocquet, G. Eur. J. Med Chem. 1982, 77, 437-44. Juby, P.F.; Hudyma, T.W.; Brown, M.; Essery, J.M.; Partyka, R.A. J. Med Chem. 1979, 22, 263-9). \n\n\n In this method, an amidine or a suitable salt thereof of general formula lS-1 is reacted with an optionally substituted diethyl methylenemalonate of general formula 1S-2. This reaction is usually conducted using a suitable base such as sodium or potassium ethoxide in ethanol, although other reaction conditions may also be applied. The alkoxide base and the alcohol solvent are chosen to correspond to the esters present in reagent 1S-2 to prevent the formation of mixtures of esters in the product of general formula 1S-3. When required, the reaction is conducted at elevated temperature, typically at the reflux temperature of the solvent until reaction is complete (generally within 1-4 hours). It is also convenient to conduct this reaction under microwave heating in sealed reaction vessels. In this instance, the reaction is generally conducted at temperatures between 80 and 120 Â°C and the reactions are typically completed in 5-30 minutes. \n\n\n Compounds of general formula 1S-3 are useful intermediates to prepare compounds of formula I of the present invention. For example, compounds of general formula 1S-3 may be hydrolyzed using a suitable base (e.g. sodium or potassium hydroxide) to give acids of formula 1S-4; alternatively, they are converted to compounds of formula 1S-5, in which the hydroxy! group of the pyrimidine core is protected with a desired protecting group (e.g. PG is benzyl, para-methoxybenzyl, trityl, or tert-butyl- dimethyl silyl). Hydrolysis of compounds of formula 1S-5 gives acids of general formula 1S-6, which is readily achieved under suitable ester hydrolysis reaction conditions (Wuts, P.G.M.; Greene, T.W., Protecting Groups in Organic Synmesis, John Wiley and Sons, 4* Edition, 2007). \n\n\n When amidines of general formula lS-1 are not commercially available, they may be prepared by a variety of method k i h li A idi only prepared from nitriles \n\n using the Pinner reaction and variations thereof (see Amidines and N-substituted amidines. Dunn, Peter J. in Comprehensive Organic Functional Group Transformations 1995, 5, 741-82, 1161-308 Editors): atrizky, Alan R.; Meth-Cohn, Otto; Rees, Charles Wayne. Publisher: Elsevier, Oxford, UK). Amidines may also be prepared from esters using the method reported by Gielen et al. (Gielen, H.; Alonso-Alija, C; Hendrix, M.; Niewohner, U.; Schauss, D. Tetrahedron Lett. 2002, 43, 419-21). \n\n\n In instances where the substituent A is selected to be a five-membered heterocyclic ring, it is possible that this heterocyclic group be bonded to the carbon atom at the 2-posttion of the pyrimidine ring through either a carbon-carbon or a carbon-nitrogen bond. In the case of attachment through a carbon-carbon bond, the precursor for the substituent A is an amidine of general formula lS-1 and the method using lS-1 for the synthesis of the title compound of general formula I is as described in the preceding reaction schemes. \n\n\n When a substituent A is attached through a carbon-nitrogen bond, the precursor for the substituent A is a guanidine of general formula 2S-7. In this example, the synthesis begins with the condensation of the guanidine derivative of general formula 2S-7 with compounds of general formula 2S- 8 (or a diethyl ethoxymethylenemalonate of general formula 1S-2 when it is desired that R3 = OH) to afford the substituted pyrimidine-5-carboxylate derivative of general formula 2S-9. Ester hydrolysis as described above affords compounds of formula 2S-10, which is useful to prepare compounds of general formula I wherein the group A is a five-membered heterocyclic group attached to the pyrimidine 2- position with a carbon-nitrogen bond. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n In cases when the guanidine derivative (2S-7) bearing the desired substituents is not commercially available, h may be synthesized using reported methods for guanidine synthesis (e.g. the guanidinylation of amines). Numerous methods for the guanidinylation of amines are reported (see Katritzky, A.R.; Rogovoy, B.V. ARKIVOC 2005, 4, 49-87; http://www.arkat- usa.org ark/journal 2005 I04 Zefirov/ 1256/1256.pdf). One general method is shown in Scheme 3, which \n\n entails the reaction of compounds of formula 3S-11 with 3,5-dimethyl-l-pyrazolylformamidinium nitrate to afford a guanidine of general formula 3S-12 using the method described by Fletcher et al. (Fletcher, D.L; Ganellin, C.R.; Piergentili, A.; Dunn, P.M.; Jenkinson, D.H. Bioorg. Med Chem. 2007, 15, 5457- 79). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n It is recognized that the title compounds of general formula I prepared as described above may be further modified using known methods and that the starting materials selected for use in the reaction schemes above may contain functional groups to enable said further transformation. For instance, aromatic rings in the title compounds of general formula I may be subjected to a variety of aromatic substitution reactions such as nitration, halogenation and the like. Aromatic substituent groups in the title compounds of general formula I bearing leaving groups such as halogens, triflates or the like, can be employed in a variety of metal-catalyzed cross coupling reactions to incorporate new substitution patterns. For example, palladium-catalyzed cross coupling reactions such as those described by Suzuki, Stille, Buchwald and others, may be used to introduce a variety of new substituent groups. Substituent groups that may be introduced using such cross-coupling methods include, but are not limited to, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl and aryl groups as well as acyl groups (e.g. carboxylic acids, esters, amides, or ketones), hydroxyl and amino or substituted amino groups. \n\n\n Other pyrimidines with various substituents at the 5-position (wherein R\" is not a carboxylate) are also prepared via cyclization reactions described in Schemes 1 & 2, which are exemplified in Scheme 4. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, compounds of formula 4S-15 are prepared when amidines lS-1 are cyclized with esters 4S-14 wherein X = O-alkyl under reaction conditions exemplified as in Scheme 1. Alternatively, compounds of formula 4S-14 wherein X = N(alkyl)2 are also cyclized with amidines lS-1 to give compounds of formula 4S-15 (Chen, W.; Feng, J.; Tu, H. Huaxue Tongbao, 2006, 69, 623-6). The esters 4S-14 can be prepared by reaction of esters 4S-13 with a substituted carboxamide dimethyl acetal. \n\n\n The methods presented in reaction Schemes 1 and 2 may be further generalized when it is desired to prepare compounds of general formula I where neither of the R.3 or R4 substiruents are hydroxyl groups. \n\n\nScheme 5 R* \n\n\n \n\n Reaction Scheme 5 illustrates the process beginning with a beta-ketoester of general formula 5S-16 bearing the R.3 substituent. The ester of general formula 5S-16 is condensed with a carboxamide dimethyl acetal of general formula 2S-8 to afford the vinylogous amide of general formula 5S-17. The intermediate 5S-17 is then reacted with an amidine derivative of general formula lS-1 using the method of Schenone et al. (Schenone, P.; Sansebastiano, L.; Mosti, L. J. Heterocyclic Chem. 1990, 27, 295) to afford the alkyl pyrimidine-5-carboxylate of general formula 5S-18. Hydrolysis of compounds of formula 5S-18 under suitable conditions (e.g. KOH or NaOH in EtOH-H\n2\n0, heating when necessary) produces compounds of formula 5S-19. The compounds of general formula 5S-19 are then converted to the title compounds of general formula I using the methods described previously. \n\n\n In one aspect, compounds of formula I are prepared via pyrimidine ring formation reactions (e.g. Schemes 1, 2, 4, 5) with the desired substituents (e.g. A, R\n2\n, R\n3\n and L) at various positions. In another aspect, the desired substituents on the pyrimidine core can be introduced after the pyrimidine ring is formed, which can be achieved using synthetic methods reported in the literature. For example, the hydroxy! group present at the pyrimidine 4-position in compounds of general formulae 1S-3, 1S-4, or 4S-15 may be converted to a halogen substituent upon reaction with a suitable halogenating reagent (e.g. POCb, BBr\n3\n, etc.). \n\n\n Compounds of general formula I wherein L is an amino or an amino derivative can be prepared from suitable pyrimidine derivatives such as 1S-4, 1S-6, 2S-10 and 5S-19 using synthetic methods reported in the literature. For example, carboxylic acids of formula 5S-19 are converted to their corresponding amines of formula 6S-20 using suitable methods such as Curtis rearrangement reactions, Scheme 6. The amino group in compounds of formula 6S-20 is further derivatized using common synthetic methods such as amide bond formation reactions (e.g. CDI couplings, EDCI couplings, reactions with acyl chlorides, etc.), sulfonamide bond formation reactions (e.g. reactions with sulfonyl chlorides in the presence of a suitable base), reductive amination reactions with a suitable carbonyl compounds (e.g. aldehydes and ketones). For example, compounds of formula I wherein L is -NHCO- and/or -NHSOr are prepared from compounds of formula 6S-20 as depicted in Scheme 6. In another aspect, carboxylic acids such as compounds of formula 5S-19 can be converted to their corresponding acyl azide such as compounds of formula 6S-22, and under suitable thermal rearrangement reaction conditions acyl azides such as 6S-22 can be converted to their corresponding isocyanate, and subsequent reactions of the resulting isocyanate with various nucleophiles such as alcohols, amines and thiols can produce compounds of formula 6S-23 wherein L is a carbamate (-NHCOO-), urea (-NHCONH-), or thiocarbamate (-NHCOS-).

Description\n\n\n\n\n HETEROARYL COMPOUNDS AS PDE10A INHIBITORS \n\n\nRelated applications \n\n\n This application claims the benefit of Indian Provisional Application Nos. 1274/MUM/2010 filed on April 19, 2010; 2447/MUM/2010 filed on September 3, 2010; and US Provisional Application Nos. 61/329,305 filed on April 29, 2010 and all of which are hereby incorporated by reference. \n\n\nTechnical Field \n\n\n The present invention relates to heteroaryl compounds and their use in treating or preventing diseases, conditions and/or disorders by inhibiting phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE 10 A) enzyme. \n\n\n Background of the Invention \n\n\n Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are a class of intracellular enzymes involved in the hydrolysis of the nucleotides cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphates (cGMP) into their respective nucleotide monophosphates. The cyclic nucleotides cAMP and cGMP are synthesized by adenylyl and guanylyl cyclases, respectively and serve as secondary messengers in several cellular pathways. \n\n\n In tissues of vertebrates, various PDE subtypes have been found that hydrolyze cyclic nucleotides [Trend. Pharmacol. Sci. vol. 1 1 , p.150, (1990), Physiol. Rev. vol. 75, p.725, (1 995), Arch. Biochem. Biophys. vol. 322, p. l , (1995) and Kidney International, vol. 55, p.29, ( 1999)]. These have been classified into 1 1 families (PDE1 to PDE 1 1 ) according to biochemical characteristics, enzymological characteristics, homology of amino acid sequences by cloning of corresponding cDNAs, sensitivity to inhibitors and the like. \n\n\n A principal mechanism for regulating cyclic nucleotide signaling is by phosphodiesterase-catalyzed cyclic nucleotide catabolism. There are 1 1 known families of PDE's encoded by 21 different genes. Each gene typically yields multiple splice variants that further contribute to the isozyme diversity. The PDE families are distinguished functionally based on cyclic nucleotide substrate specificity, mechanism(s) of regulation and sensitivity to inhibitors. Furthermore, PDE's are differentially expressed throughout the body, including in the central nervous system. As a result of these distinct enzymatic activities and localization, different PDE's isozymes can serve distinct physiological functions. \n\n Human PDEI O was identified by identification of cDNA fragments published in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Expressed Sequence Tags (EST) database (Loughney et al., W099/42596). While PDE 10 was found to share homology with known PDE's, no function could be identified for PDE10. PDE10 has been identified as a unique family based on primary amino acid sequence and distinct enzymatic activity. Homology screening of EST databases revealed mouse PDEI OA as the first member of the PDE10 family of PDE's [Fujishige et al., J. Biol. Chem. vol. 274, p. l 8438-18445, (1999); Loughney, K. et al., Gene vol. 234, p. 109-1 17, ( 1999)]. The murine homologue has also been cloned [Soderling, S. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA vol. 96 p. 7071 -7076, ( 1999)] and N-terminal splice variants of both the rat and human genes have been identified [ otera, J. et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. vol. 261 , p. 551 -557, (1999); Fujishige, K. et al., Eur. J. Biochem. vol. 266, p. 1 1 1 8- 1 127, ( 1 999)]. There is a high degree of homology across species. The mouse PDE 10A 1 is a 779 amino acid protein that hydrolyzes both cAMP and cGMP to AMP and GMP, respectively. The affinity of PDE10 for cAMP is higher than for cGMP. However, approximately 5-fold greater Vmax for cGMP over cAMP has lead to the suggestion that PDE10 is a unique cAMP-inhibited cGMPase [Fujishige et al., J. Biol. Chem. vol. 274, p. 18438-18445, (1999)]. \n\n\n The PDE10 family of polypeptides shows a lower degree of sequence homology to previously identified PDE families. These low degrees of sequence homology of PDE10 family of polypeptide make them insensitive to certain inhibitors that are known to be specific for other known PDE families (US 6,350,603, incorporated herein by reference). \n\n\n Regarding PDEI OA which is one of the PDE subtypes, the expression of its mRNA has been identified in many tissues and organs such as striatum, testis, kidney, thyroid gland, pituitary gland, thalamus, cerebellum, heart, lungs and placenta, cells such as aortic smooth muscle cells and aortic endothelial cells, cells of cancers such as lung small cell carcinoma, breast cancer and large bowel cancer. Accordingly, the possibility that PDEI OA is involved in diseases related to these cells, tissues and organs has been demonstrated [J. Biol. Chem. vol. 274, p. 1 8438 ( 1999); Gene, vol. 234, p. 109 ( 1999) and WO 01 /29199]. \n\n\n From the view points of strong expression of mRNA of PDEI OA and its enzymatic activity in the striatum, this enzyme is suggested to be involved in, for example, onset or progression of Parkinson's disease, Huntington disease and dyskinesia caused by long-term administration of L-DOPA (L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine). It has been reported that PDEI OA mRNA expression in the striatum of Huntington disease mouse model is different from that in the striatum of normal mice (WO 01/24781). \n\n There are very few effective treatments for neurological disorders characterized by progressive cell loss, known as neurodegenerative diseases, as well as those involving acute cell loss, such as stroke and trauma. In addition, few effective treatments exist for neurological disorders such as psychosis which has been linked to altered striatal function relating to changes in expression of the enzyme PDEI OA [J. A. Siuciak, et al. Neuropharmacology, vol. 51 , p. 374-385, (2006)]. Striatal dysfunction is implicated in a number of CNS disorders including psychosis, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorders, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. The results with PDEI OA knock-out mice provide evidence that PDEI OA functions to inhibit striatal output by reducing spiny medium neuron excitability. PDEI OA is selectively expressed in dopamine receptive medium spiny neurons, and considerable data suggests that cAMP and cGMP signalling pathways play significant roles in the regulation of medium spiny neuron excitability. Additional studies with papaverine, a potent inhibitor of PDEI OA, confirm that PDEI OA regulates both cAMP and cGMP in vivo in rats [J. A. Siuciak, et al. Neuropharmacology, vol. 5 1 , p. 386- 396, (2006)]. \n\n\n In view of the foregoing, PDE I OA inhibitors are useful for treating and/or preventing various diseases caused by enhanced activity of PDEI OA, possibly with reduced side effects (for example, a neural disease such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington disease or Alzheimer's disease, dyskinesia, hypogonadism, diabetes, an ischemic heart disease, hypertension, an inflammatory disease, a disease of the digestive system, an allergic disease, osteoporosis, pain or a malignant tumor). \n\n\n WO 2003/000269, WO 2003/0141 15, WO 2003/0141 16, WO 2003/0141 17, WO 2003/051877, WO 2006/034491 and WO 2006/034512 describe PDE10 inhibitors for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, diabetes and its related disorders.

N-phenylacetamide \n\n\nPharmacological activity \n\n\nThe illustrative examples of the present invention are screened for PDE 10A activity according to a modified procedure described in Sette, C, lona, S. and Conti, M., J. Biol. Chem. 269 ( 12), pp. 9245-9252, 1994. \n\n\nln-vitro screening assay for PDE10A inhibitors: \n\n\n PDE10 enzyme hydrolyses cAMP / cGMP to metabolically inactive 5'-AMP / 5 '- GMP. Inhibition of PDE10 enzyme activity can be quantitated by using a two step radiometric assay. In this assay, PDE10 enzyme converts \n3\nH-cAMP/\n3\nH-cGMP to \n3\nH-AMP/ \n3\nH-GMP which is then converted to \n3\nH-adenosine / \n3\nH-guanosine using snake venom nucleotidase. The radioactivity released in the supernatant is quantitated as an indicator of PDE 10 enzyme activity. \n\n\n Test compounds or reference compounds such as dipyridamole, IBMX (Calbiochem) and papaverine (Sigma) were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to prepare 1 .0 mM stock solution and diluted suitably to get the desired concentration. Final concentration of DMSO in the reaction was 3 % (v/v). Substrate mixture was prepared by mixing H-cAMP (GE Healthcare) and 1 .0 mM cold cAMP (Sigma) in order to get 0.5 Î¼Î¸Î¯ and 1 .0 Î¼Î final concentrations of each respectively in the assay buffer. 1 .0 mg/mL of snake venom nucleotidase (Sigma) was prepared in D/w. Dowex (AG1 -X8 from Biorad) slurry was mixed with water and ethanol at 1 : 1 : 1 ratio. The assay was carried out using suitably diluted PDE10A enzyme preparation (BPS Biosciences) to get around 1 -20 % substrate hydrolysis to ensure linear reaction kinetics. \n\n\n PDE10A assay was carried out in 200 Î¼Î_. reaction volume by addition of assay buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.2 mM MgCl\n2\n, . test compound at required concentration and diluted enzyme. Reaction mixture was incubated at 30 Â°C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by heating the plate in boiling water bath for 5 min and then cooling on an ice bath for 1 5 min. This was followed by addition of 50 Î¼Î, of Crotalus atrox snake venom 5'-nucleotidase and incubation at 30 Â°C for 30 min. Thereafter, 400 Î¼Î of Dowex was added and incubated on an ice bath for 1 5 min. Reaction mixture was centrifuged and \n\n supernatant was used for quantifying radioactivity in the samples. Reaction was measured as counts per minute (cpm) using Packard Biosciences plate reader. An enzyme control without test compounds was run to quantitate maximum PDEI OA reaction. Inhibition of enzyme activity was calculated as a percent of control reaction. IC50 values were calculated from dose response curve by nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism software. \n\n\n The compounds of the present invention were screened using the above assay procedure and the results obtained are given in Table 9. Percentage inhibition of human - PDEI OA enzyme at 1 .0 Î¼Î and 10.0 Î¼Î concentrations are given in Table 1 along with IC50 (nM), wherein \"A\" refers to an IC50 value of less than 100 nM, \"B\" refers to an IC50 value in range of 100.01 -250 nM, \"C\" refers to an IC\n50\n value in range of 250.01 -500 nM and \"D\" refers to an IC50 value of greater than 500 nM. \n\n\nTable 9: In-vitro screening results of compounds of present invention \n\n\n Example No. percentage inhibition at IC\n50\n (nM) \n\n\n 1 Î¼Î 10 Î¼Î \n\n\n 1 58.54 93.35 D \n\n\n 2 66.03 95.24 D \n\n\n 3 31.55 77.79 ~ \n\n\n 4 72.44 92.16 C \n\n\n 5 88.73 96.29 A \n\n\n 6 36.80 64.61 -\n\n\n7 18.72 47.53 ~ \n\n\n 8 19.34 39.00 ~ \n\n\n 9 17.42 37.09 -\n\n\n10 1 1.60 21 .76 -\n\n\n12 32.68 56.88 \n\n\n 13 74.1 5 86.79 B \n\n\n 14 82.96 97.20 A \n\n\n 1 5 91 .10 97.53 A \n\n\n 16 83.07 96.40 B \n\n\n 17 65.83 90.99 D \n\n\n 18 84.84 96.88 B \n\n\n 19 76.62 96.39 B \n\n\n 20 40.60 72.63 â \n\n Example No. percentage inhibition at 1C\n50\n (nM)\n\n\n1 Î¼Î 10 Î¼Î\n\n\n21 43.45 85.94 ~\n\n\n22 22.17 66.40 ~\n\n\n23 91.46 98.87 A\n\n\n24 80.24 96.42 C\n\n\n25 80.71 97.35 A\n\n\n26 63.86 95.09 C\n\n\n27 85.28 98.67 A\n\n\n28 21.17 69.96 ~\n\n\n29 68.07 94.90 B\n\n\n30 68.75 96.3 1 C\n\n\n3 1 36.22 86.98 -\n\n\n32 75.53 99.75 B\n\n\n33 29.07 80.69 â\n\n\n34 36.46 73.41 -\n\n\n35 73.35 95.44 C\n\n\n36 78.59 99.04 B\n\n\n37 36.81 56.92 ~\n\n\n38 86.94 98.47 A\n\n\n39 88.77 98.64 A\n\n\n40 89.19 96.34 A\n\n\n41 87.12 99.29 A\n\n\n42 43.99 44.62 ~\n\n\n43 58.13 81 .30 D\n\n\n44 50.90 73.25 -\n\n\n45 46.75 88.14 â\n\n\n46 96.06 100.30 A\n\n\n47 14.36 73.13 â\n\n\n48 16.01 71 .59 -\n\n\n49 34.07 39.88 \n\n\n 50 04.78 07.98 - \n\n Example No. percentage inhibition at IC\n50\n (nM)\n\n\n1 Î¼Î 10 Î¼Î\n\n\n51 06.91 43.63 -\n\n\n52 80.81 96.71 B\n\n\n53 20.39 48.90 ~\n\n\n54 12.39 24.61 ~\n\n\n55 0.00 3.35 ~\n\n\n56 00 00 ~\n\n\n57 16.99 19.96 â\n\n\n58 1 8.03 26.53 -\n\n\n59 1 1 .72 26.62 â\n\n\n60 3 1 .89 32.42 -\n\n\n61 84.32 88.81 B\n\n\n62 17.40 41.41 ~\n\n\n63 82.40 97.75 A\n\n\n64 58.16 82.10 ~\n\n\n65 76.78 94.56 A\n\n\n66 78.32 89.21 B\n\n\n67 83.63 95.45 A\n\n\n68 76.6 91.50 B\n\n\n69 09.19 27.73 -\n\n\n70 57.57 58.83 -\n\n\n71 14.15 32.30 -\n\n\n72 43.91 46.19 ~"
