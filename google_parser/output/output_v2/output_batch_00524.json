Description\n\n\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to a urea compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof which is useful as a medicine, particularly as an agent for treating urinary frequency, urinary incontinence and/or overactive bladder.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND ART\n\n\n \n \n \nOveractive bladder refers to a clinical condition showing an urgency of urination regardless of incontinence, which is usually associated with a urinary frequency and/or nocturia (Non-Patent Document 1). For a treatment thereof, currently an anticholinergic agent is mainly used, and certain treatment results are given. However, it has been reported that the anticholinergic agent is difficult to be used for patients with prostatic hypertrophy or elderly patients because it is known to cause side-effects such as dry mouth, constipation and blurred vision, as well as a risk of urinary retention. In addition, there are patients showing no effectiveness in the treatment with the anticholinergic agent. From the above facts, there is a great expectation for a drug with a new mechanism of action for overactive bladder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) is known to hydrolyze and inactivate endocannabinoid (Non-Patent Documents 2 to 5). Endocannabinoid is a generic term for a biological substance that acts on a cannabinoid receptor thereby exhibiting the physiological activity in vivo. Typical endocannabinoids are anandamide, palmitoyl ethanolamide, oleamide, and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol; and they are known to be hydrolyzed and lose their activity by FAAH. Furthermore, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol that is considered as an active ingredient of Cannabis (marijuana) is known to activate a cannabinoid receptor (Non-Patent Document 6).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn mammals, two types of cannabinoid receptor CB1 and CB2 have heretofore been known. CB1 is expressed in central and peripheral nervous systems, and when activated, it exhibits mental action and analgesic action. CB2 is expressed in immune systems, and when activated, it exhibits antiinflammatory action and analgesic (and inflammatory) action.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMeanwhile, in a cystitis rat model, a cannabinoid receptor agonist increases the bladder capacity and the urination threshold (Non-Patent Document 7 and Non-Patent Document 8); and the side effects, such as hallucination, delusion, tachycardia and orthostatic hypotension, which are observed when a cannabinoid receptor agonist is administered to animals, are not observed if an FAAH inhibitor is administered (Non-Patent Document 9). From these, the FAAH inhibitor is expected as a novel therapeutic agent for urinary frequency, urinary incontinence, and/or overactive bladder, which has less risks of causing the side effects of cannabinoids and compatibility problems.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following compounds have been reported as piperazinyl urea derivatives or piperidyl urea derivatives which have an FAAH inhibitory activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, Patent Document 1 discloses the following compound:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(wherein R\n1 \nrepresents aryl which may be substituted, or a heterocyclic group which may be substituted, R\n1a \nrepresents H, a hydrocarbon group, or the like, Z represents O or S, R\n2 \nrepresents piperidine-1,4-diyl which may be substituted or piperazine-1,4-diyl which may be substituted, R\n3 \nrepresents —CO—, —CO—O—, —CONH—, or a heterocyclic group, and R\n4 \nrepresents a hydrocarbon group which may be substituted or a heterocyclic group which may be substituted, provided that if R\n3 \nis —CO—, —CO—O— or —CONH—, R\n4 \nrepresents benzoisoxazolyl.

Furthermore, another preferred embodiments of the compound (I) of the present invention are a compound represented by the formula (I-A), the formula (I-B), the formula (I-C) or the formula (I-D).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound of the present invention may in some cases exist in the form of other tautomers or geometrical isomers, depending on the kind of the substituents. As used in the present specification, the compound can be described in only one form of isomers, but the present invention includes the isomers, an isolated form of the isomers, or a mixture of these isomers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, the compound (I) may have asymmetric carbons or axial asymmetry, and correspondingly, it may exist in the form of optical isomers such as an (R)-form and an (S)-form. The compound of the present invention includes both of a mixture and an isolated form of these optical isomers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, the “pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs” of the compound (I) are also included in the present invention. The “pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug” is a compound having a group which can be converted into an amino group, OH, CO\n2\nH, or the like, by solvolysis or under a physiological condition. Examples of the group capable of forming a prodrug include those described in “Prog. Med., 5, 2157-2161 (1985)”, or “Iyakuhin no Kaihatsu (Development of Drugs)(Hirokawa Shoten, 1990), vol. 7, Bunshi Sekkei (Molecular Design)”, pp. 163-198.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, the compounds of the present invention may form an acid-addition salt or a salt with a base, depending on the kind of the substituents, and these salts are included in the present invention, as long as they are pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Specifically, examples thereof include acid-addition salts with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid and phosphoric acid, and with organic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, lactic acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, aspartic acid and glutamic acid.

Furthermore, the present invention also includes the compounds that are labeled with various radioactive isotopes or non-radioactive isotopes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the present specification, the “urinary frequency” refers to a condition in which urination frequency increases over a normal range. Further, the “urinary incontinence” refers to a condition of involuntary leakage of urine that gives rise to problems in the social or sanitary aspects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the present specification, the “overactive bladder” refers to a syndrome diagnosed by self-consciousness of urinary frequency and/or urinary urgency (Non-Patent Document 1). Examples of the causes of developing the conditions include neurologic disorders (for example, disorders due to neurogenic bladder, or cerebral infarction), lower urinary tract obstruction (for example, prostate hypertrophy), and aging, which are each considered to have hyperactivity of a capsaicin-sensitive afferent nerve as a common disease-developing mechanism.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe overactive bladder can be treated by relieving the symptoms of urinary frequency, urinary incontinence, urinary urgency or the like. It is clear, for example, from the fact that by administering Oxybutynin Hydrochloride (Japan Standard Industrial Classification No. 87259; Aventis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) as an anti-cholinergic agent to a patient with overactive bladder three times a day, at a dose of 2 to 3 mg once, the symptoms of urinary frequency, urinary incontinence, urinary urgency or the like is relieved, thereby it being possible to treat overactive bladder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDemonstration of the therapeutic effect for urinary frequency, urinary incontinence and/or overactive bladder can be carried out by using a method known to a person skilled in the art or a modified method thereof. For example, a pathologic model caused by administration of 50 to 200 mg of cyclophosphamide (CPA) to a rat, a guinea pig, a dog or the like is very frequently used in the art (Ozawa et. al., The Journal of Urology, Vol. 162, pp. 2211-2216, 1999; Boucher et. al., The Journal of Urology, Vol. 164, pp. 203-208, 2000). This model is a pathologic model accompanied by hemorrhagic cystitis, but since a capsaicin-sensitive afferent nerve is involved role in the symptom-developing mechanism for urinary frequency, the present model is considered to be suitable for various types of overactive bladder including neurogenic bladder (Carlo Alberto Maggi et. al., Journal of the Autonomic Nervous System, Vol. 38, pp. 201-208, 1992). The condition of urinary frequency can be confirmed from the reduction in the effective bladder capacity. For this pathologic model animal, by repeatedly administering once or several times an effective dose of a pharmaceutical composition in oral, intraperitoneal or intravenous administration mode, the therapeutic effect for urinary frequency, urinary incontinence and/or overactive bladder can be confirmed from the increase in the effective bladder capacity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(Production Processes)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof can be prepared by applying various known synthetic methods, by the use of the characteristics based on their basic backbones or the kind of the substituents. Here, depending on the kind of the functional groups, it is in some cases effective from the viewpoint of the preparation techniques to substitute the functional group with an appropriate protecting group (a group which may be easily converted into the functional group), during the steps from starting materials to intermediates. Examples of such a functional group include an amino group, a hydroxyl group, a carboxyl group and the like, and examples of a protecting group thereof include those as described in “Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis”, edited by Greene and Wuts, 3\nrd \nedition, 1999, which may be optionally selected and used in response to the reaction conditions. By such a method, a desired compound can be obtained by introducing a protecting group to carry out the reaction, and then, if desired, removing the protecting group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, a prodrug of the compound (I) can be prepared by introducing a specific group during the steps from starting materials to intermediates, in the same manner as for the aforementioned protecting groups, or by carrying out the reaction with the obtained compound (I). The reaction can be carried out by employing a method known to a person skilled in the art, such as common esterification, amidation, dehydration and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHereinbelow, the representative production processes of the compounds of the present invention are described. Further, the production processes of the present invention are not limited to the examples as shown below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(The symbols in the sentences have the following meanings:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDMF: N,N-dimethylformamide; DMSO: dimethylsulfoxide; THF: tetrahydrofuran; Tol: toluene; EtOAc: ethyl acetate; and TEA: triethylamine.

Examples of the leaving group of D include halogen. In the case where D is halogen, or the like, the production of isocyanate (III) is carried out in the following manner: sodium azide is allowed to undergo a reaction in a solvent inert to the reaction such as acetonitrile from under cooling to room temperature to form a corresponding acid azide, and then excessive sodium azide is removed by a liquid separation process, the solvent is substituted by a solvent inert to the reaction such as Tol, and heated (preferably to around 110° C.). The production of the isocyanate (III) may be carried out in the following manner: using a free carboxylic acid wherein D is —OH as a starting material, diphenylphosphorylazide (DPPA) is allowed to undergo a reaction in a solvent inert to the reaction such as Tol, in the presence of an organic base such as TEA, from under cooling to room temperature, and the same process as above is then performed. The reaction of the isocyanate (III) and the cyclic amine derivative (IV) can be carried out by using a solution of the isocyanate (III) produced as above in Tol, in a solvent inert to the reaction such as THF, from under cooling to heating under reflux. Furthermore, if the isocyanate (III) is commercially available, the reaction can also be carried out by using the commercially available one.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(Production Process 2)\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(wherein E represents a leaving group that is advantageous in the present reaction).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present production process is a process in which a compound (V) having a leaving group obtained by allowing a nitrogen-containing compound to undergo a reaction with triphosgene, 1,1′-carbonyldimidazole (CDI), phenyl chloroformate, or ethyl chlorate, is reacted with a cyclic amine derivative (IV), in the presence or absence of an organic base such as TEA and pyridine, in a solvent inert to the reaction such as dichloromethane and THF, from under cooling to room temperature to produce the compound (I) of the present invention. The compound (V) may be used in the reaction after isolation, or used as it is without isolation after being produced in the reaction system, and examples of the leaving group of E include chloro, imidazolyl, phenoxy, or ethoxy. The reaction is carried out in a solvent inert to the reaction such as dichloromethane, DMF, DMSO, THF, and dioxane, from cooling to heating under reflux.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(Production Process 3)\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(1) The present production process is a process in which a cyclic amine derivative (VI) is reacted with a carboxylic acid (VII) or a reactive derivative thereof to produce a compound (I-b) that is the compound (I) of the present invention in which X is N, and L is —C(O)—. The reaction can be carried out in the presence of a condensing agent (for example, dicyclohexylcarbodimide (DCC), diisopropylcarbodimide (DIPC), 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (WSC), and 1,1′-carbonyldimidazole (CDI)), if desired, an additive (for example, N-hydroxysuccinimide (HONSu), 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt), organic bases such as 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)pyridine (DMAP) and TEA). As the reactive derivative of the carboxylic acid, an acid halide, an acid anhydride, an active ester, and the like can be used. The reaction can be carried out, for example, with reference to a method as described in “Jikken Kagaku Koza (Courses in Experimental Chemistry) (4\nth \nedition)”, edited by The Chemical Society of Japan, vol. 22 (1992) (Maruzen), and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(2) The present production process is a process in which a cyclic amine derivative (VI) is reacted with sulfonyl chloride (VIII) to produce a compound (I-c) that is the compound (I) of the present invention in which X is N, and L is —S(O)\n2\n—. The reaction can be carried out, for example, with the use of the sulfonylation condition as described in “Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis” as described above. Specifically, it can be carried out in a solvent such as THF, dichloromethane, and acetonitrile, and if desired, in the presence of a base such as TEA and pyridine, from under cooling to heating under reflux.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(Production Process 4)\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present production process is a process in which reductive alkylation is carried out using a cyclic amine derivative (VI) and an aldehyde (IX) to produce a compound (I-d) that is the compound (I) of the present invention in which X is N, and L is methylene. The reaction can be carried out, for example, with reference to a method as described in “Jikken Kagaku Koza (Courses in Experimental Chemistry) (4\nth \nedition)”, edited by The Chemical Society of Japan, vol. 20 (1992) (Maruzen), p. 300, or the like. Specifically, it is preferably carried out without a solvent, or in a solvent inert to the reaction, for example, halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, and chloroform, aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, Tol, and xylene, esters such as EtOAc, ethers such as diethylether, THF, and dioxane, alcohols such as methanol and ethanol, and acetic acid, using a reducing agent such as sodium borohydride (NaBH\n4\n), sodium cyanoborohydride (NaBH\n3\nCN), and sodium triacetoxyborohydride (NaBH(OAc)\n3\n), under cooling, or from under cooling to heating under reflux. According to the compounds, it is desirable in some cases to carry out the reaction in the presence of mineral acids such as sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, and hydrobromic acid, organic acids such as formic acid and acetic acid, or Lewis acid such as titanium tetrachloride. Furthermore, the reaction can be carried out, for example, using palladium-carbon, Raney nickel, platinum, or the like as a catalyst, at a normal pressure to elevated pressure under a hydrogen atmosphere, in a solvent inert to the reaction, such as aromatic hydrocarbons, esters, ethers, halogenated hydrocarbons, DMF, N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA), N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), acetonitrile, and acetic acid, as described above, from room temperature to heating under reflux.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(Production Process 5)\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(wherein R\n1A \nrepresents aryl-lower alkylene—which may be substituted with the above-mentioned Group G\n1\n, and cycloalkyl-lower alkylene-.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present production process is a process in which a phenol derivative or an aromatic hetero ring derivative (X) having a hydroxyl group is alkylated using a compound (XI) having a leaving group to produce a compound (I-e) that is the compound (I) of the present invention in which R\n1 \nis aryl-lower alkylene-O— which may be substituted with the above-mentioned Group G\n1\n, or cycloalkyl-lower alkylene-O—.

Five times by volume its weight of an ice-cooled buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.32 M sucrose) was added, and this was homogenized with a homogenizer in ice to give a uniform suspension. This was centrifuged (1500×g, 4° C., 15 minutes), and the supernatant was again centrifuged (15000×g, 4° C., 20 minutes) to obtain a precipitate. Further, using an ultrasonic wave generator (UR-20P, TOMY SEIKO CO., LTD.), this was ultrasonicated (power dial 4) for 5 seconds. The protein concentration of the resulting homogenate was measured according to a dye-coupling method (protein assay CBB solution, NACALAI TESQUE, INC.). Using a buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 100 mM NaCl), the rat brain homogenate was diluted so that its protein concentration could be 60 μg/ml, thereby preparing an enzyme solution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(2) Screening for an FAAH Activity Inhibiting Substance\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA substrate solution was prepared, comprising 2 μCi/ml radiolabeled anandamide (Anandamide [ethanolamine 1-\n3\nH] (American Radiolabeled Chemical)), 8 μM anandamide (Funakoshi), 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml BSA and 100 mM NaCl. Test substance solutions were prepared, dissolved in DMSO to have a concentration from 1 nM to 100 μM. 50 μl of the substrate solution and 1 μl of the test substance solution were added to 50 μl of the enzyme solution, and left for 1 hour. As a control, DMSO was added in place of the test substance solution. To this, added was 200 μl of a 1:1 (ratio by volume) solution of chloroform/methanol, followed by vortexing. This was centrifuged (15000 rpm, 2 minutes), whereby the decomposed product ethanolamine (ethanolamine 1-\n3\nH) was separated in the upper layer (water/methanol layer) and the unreacted radiolabeled anandamide (Anandamide [ethanolamine 1-\n3\nH]) was in the lower layer (chloroform layer). 30 μl of the upper layer was transferred into a 96-well organic solvent-resistant white microplate (PicoPlate-96; Perkin Elmer, Inc.), 150 μl of Microscint-20 (Perkin Elmer, Inc.) was added thereto, and this was measured with a microplate scintillation counter (TopCount™; Beckman Coulter, Inc.).

A measured value of a case where a buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 100 mM NaCl) was reacted in place of the enzyme solution was subtracted from every measured value.

Next, the cell culture plate was transferred onto ice, and the substrate solution was removed by suction; and 75 μl/well of a cytolytic solution (the above buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, and 10 μM of FAAH-inhibitory activity-having compound, 3′-carbamoylbiphenyl-3-yl ester (URB597; Cayman chemical; Kathuria et al., Nature Med., Vol. 9, pp. 76-81, 2003)) was added thereto, followed by stirring. The resulting cell lysate in every well was individually transferred into a 1.5 ml sample tube, to which was added 150 μl of 1:1 (ratio by volume) chloroform/methanol solution, followed by vortexing. This was centrifuged (15000 rpm, 2 minutes), whereby the decomposed product, ethanolamine (ethanolamine 1-\n3\nH) was separated in the upper layer (water/methanol layer) and the unreacted radiolabeled anandamide was in the lower layer (chloroform layer). 25 μl of the upper layer was transferred into a 96-well organic solvent-resistant white microplate (PicoPlate-96; Perkin Elmer, Inc.), 150 μl of Microscint-20 (Perkin Elmer, Inc.) was added thereto, and this was measured with a microplate scintillation counter (TopCount™; Beckman Coulter, Inc.).

According to the method mentioned above, the compound was analyzed for its influence on FAAH activity. As a negative control, DMSO was used. As a positive control, URB597 was added to the substrate solution to have a concentration of 10 μM. Based on the measured value of the positive control, 0%, and on the measured value of the negative control, 100%, the IC\n50 \nvalue of the test substance was obtained.

As a control, 0.5% MC solution was orally administered to two rats. After 30 minutes, the blood was collected from the rat under ether anesthesia through its aorta. With that, the head of each rat was cut off, and its cerebrum was taken out.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n3 ml of the collected blood was diluted with the same amount of physiological saline water, and gently put on 3 ml of a hemocyte-separating agent (Nycoplep; AXIS-SHIELD) in a centrifugal tube. This was centrifuged (400×g, 20 minutes) to collect the monocytic layer. The resulting monocytes were washed twice with physiological saline, and frozen and stored at −20° C. until their use for measurement.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo the collected rat brain, added was five times by volume its weight of an ice-cooled buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA), and this was homogenized with a homogenizer in ice to give a uniform suspension. Further, using an ultrasonic wave generator (UR-20P (power dial 4), TOMY SEIKO CO., LTD.), this was ultrasonicated for 5 seconds. To the above frozen monocytes, added was 100 μl of an ice-cooled buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA), and using an ultrasonic wave generator (UR-20P (power dial 4), TOMY SEIKO CO., LTD.), this was ultrasonicated for 5 seconds. The protein concentration of each of the homogenates of brain and monocytes was measured according to a dye-coupling method (protein assay CBB solution, NACALAI TESQUE, INC.). Using a buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 100 mM NaCl), the homogenates of brain and monocytes were diluted so that their protein concentration could be 80 μg/ml and 400 μg/ml, thereby preparing enzyme solutions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(2) Measurement of FAAH Activity\n\n\n \n \n \n \n50 μl of the enzyme solution was reacted with 50 μl of a substrate solution (2 μCi/ml radiolabeled anandamide (Anandamide [ethanolamine 1-\n3\nH] (American Radiolabeled Chemical)), 8 μM anandamide (Funakoshi), 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA) added thereto, at room temperature for 1 hour. 200 μA of a 1:1 (ratio by volume) solution of chloroform and methanol was added to it, followed by vortexing. This was centrifuged (12000×g, 2 minutes), whereby the decomposed product ethanolamine (ethanolamine 1-\n3\nH) was separated in the upper layer (water/methanol layer) and the unreacted radiolabeled anandamide (Anandamide [ethanolamine 1-\n3\nH]) was in the lower layer (chloroform layer). 25 μl of the upper layer was transferred into a 96-well organic solvent-resistant white microplate (PicoPlate-96; PerkinElmer, Inc.), 150 μl of Microscinti-20 (Perkin Elmer, Inc.) was added thereto, and this was measured with a microplate scintillation counter (TopCount™; Beckman Coulter, Inc.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBased on the FAAH activity of the control, test substance-free, rat brain or monocyte homogenate, 100%, and on the FAAH activity of the tissue homogenate-free buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 100 mM NaCl), 0%, the relative value (%) of the FAAH activity of the tissue homogenate of the rat administered with the test substance was obtained. The substance that decreased the relative value of FAAH activity was selected as an FAAH activity-inhibiting substance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above results confirm that by administering a test substance to a test animal, and then measuring the test substance-dependent FAAH activity change in the taken tissue homogenate, an FAAH activity-inhibiting substance can be screened.\n\n\n \nTest Example 4\n\n\nEffect of Compound on Cyclophosphamide (CPA)-Induced Urinary Frequency in a Rat\n\n\n \n \n \nCompounds were tested for their bladder irritation-relieving effect, using pathologic models. It is known that systemic administration of cyclophosphamide (CPA) converts the compound into its metabolite, acrolein, and, as existing in urine, this injures the bladder mucosa. In rats, CPA administration induces bladder pain or urinary frequency accompanied by hemorrhagic cystitis, and therefore using such rats, it is possible to evaluate the potency of drug for these symptoms. In this experiment, used were 9-week-old Wistar female rats (Charles River). CPA (100 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally administered to the rats, and after 2 days, the rats were tested. A test compound was orally administered (p.o.) to the rats; and after 15 minutes, distilled water (30 ml/kg) was forcedly orally administered thereto. The rats were put in a metabolic cage, and the weight of their urine was continuously measured for 1 hour. The overall urine amount was divided by the overall urination frequency, and the effective bladder capacity was thus calculated. As a result, in the group administered with the solvent, 0.5% methyl cellulose (MC), the effective bladder capacity reduced, and the rats showed urinary frequency. In oral administration, the effective doses of compounds of Examples 155 and 210 were 10 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg, respectively. These compounds increased the reduced effective bladder capacity, and relieved the condition of urinary frequency.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above-described results confirmed that the compound of the present invention has an excellent FAAH inhibitory action, increases the reduced effective bladder capacity, and relieves the condition of urinary frequency. In this regard, it is apparent that the compound of the present invention is useful as an agent for treating FAAH-related diseases, in particular, urinary frequency, urinary incontinence, and/or overactive bladder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, the compound of the present invention has an excellent FAAH inhibitory action, and thus is useful as an agent for treating (1) neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., anxiety, depression, and epilepsy), (2) brain disorders, and neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., head injury, cerebral ischemia, and cognitive symptoms (dementia)), (3) pains, (4) immunological and inflammatory diseases, (5) vomiting, (6) eating disorders, (7) irritable bowel syndrome and ulcerative colitis, (8) hypertension, (9) glaucoma, or (10) sleep disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical composition containing one or two or more kinds of the compound (I) of the present invention or a salt thereof as an active ingredient can be prepared in accordance with a method that is generally employed, using a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, an excipient, and the like, generally used in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe administration of the composition can be accompanied by any mode of oral administration via tablets, pills, capsules, granules, powders or liquid preparations; and parenteral administration via injections such as intraarticular, intravenous, or intramuscular injections, suppositories, eye drops, eye ointments, transdermal liquid preparations, ointments, transdermal patches, transmucosal liquid preparations, transmucosal patches, and inhalations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRegarding the solid composition of the present invention for oral administration, tablets, powders, granules, or the like are used.

As the aqueous solvent, for example, distilled water for injection and physiological saline are included. Examples of the non-aqueous solvent include propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, plant oils such as olive oil, alcohols such as ethanol, and Polysorbate 80 (Pharmacopeia). Such a composition may further contain tonicity agents, antiseptics, moistening agents, emulsifying agents, dispersing agents, stabilizing agents, or solubilizing agents. These are sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacteria retaining filter, blending of a germicide, or irradiation. In addition, these can also be used by producing sterile solid compositions, and dissolving or suspending it in sterile water or a sterile solvent for injection prior to their use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMedicaments for external use include ointments, plasters, creams, jellies, patches, sprays, lotions, eye drops, and eye ointments.

For example, known excipients, and also pH adjusting agents, antiseptics, surfactants, lubricants, stabilizing agents, thickening agents, and the like may be optionally added thereto. For their administration, appropriate devices for inhalation or insufflation may be used. For example, a compound may be administered alone or as a powder of formulated mixture, or as a solution or suspension by combining it with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, using a conventionally known device or sprayer, such as a measured administration inhalation device. The dry powder inhalers or the like may be for single or multiple administration use, and dry powders or powder-containing capsules may be used. Alternatively, this may be in a form such as a high pressure aerosol spray which uses an appropriate propellant, for example, a suitable gas such as chlorofluoroalkane, hydrofluoroalkane, and carbon dioxide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the case of oral administration, the daily dose may be generally from about 0.001 to 100 mg/kg, preferably from 0.1 to 30 mg/kg, and further more preferably 0.1 to 10 mg/kg, per body weight, and this is administered in one portion or dividing it into 2 to 4 portions. Also, in the case of intravenous administration, the daily dose is from about 0.0001 to 10 mg/kg per day per body weight, once a day or two or more times a day. In addition, a transmucosal agent is administered at a dose from about 0.001 to 100 mg/kg per body weight, once a day or two or more times a day.

As such, the United States government has certain rights in this invention.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThis invention relates to compounds and their use to treat and prevent disorders and diseases associated with the ryanodine receptors that regulate calcium channel functioning in cells. More particularly, the invention discloses compounds that are related to 1,4-benzothiazepines and are useful to treat cardiac diseases and disorders, skeletal muscle diseases and disorders, as well as diseases, disorders and conditions affecting the nervous system, such as neuropathies, seizures, and disorders affecting cognitive functioning. The invention also discloses pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds and articles of manufacture comprising the pharmaceutical compositions.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) functions, among other things, as a specialized intracellular calcium (Ca\n2+\n) store. Channels in the SR called ryanodine receptors (RyRs) open and close to regulate the release of Ca\n2+\n from the SR into the intracellular cytoplasm of the cell. Release of Ca\n2+\n into the cytoplasm from the SR increases cytoplasmic Ca\n2+ \nconcentration. Open probability (Po) of the RyR receptor refers to the likelihood that the RyR channel is open at any given moment, and therefore capable of releasing Ca\n2+\n into the cytoplasm from the SR.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are three types of ryanodine receptors, all of which are Ca\n2+\n channels: RyR1, RyR2, and RyR3. RyR1 is found predominantly in skeletal muscle as well as other tissues, RyR2 is found predominantly in the heart as well as other tissues, and RyR3 is found in the brain as well as other tissues. The RyR channels are formed by four RyR polypeptides in association with four FK506 binding proteins (FKBPs), specifically FKBP12 (calstabin1) and FKBP12.6 (calstabin2). Calstabin1 binds to RyR1, calstabin2 binds to RyR2, and calstabin1 binds to RyR3. The FKBP proteins (calstabin1 and calstabin2) bind to the RyR channel (one molecule per RyR subunit), stabilize RyR-channel functioning, and facilitate coupled gating between neighboring RyR channels, thereby preventing abnormal activation of the channel during the channel's closed state.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProtein kinase A (PKA) binds to the cytoplasmic surface of the RyR receptors. PKA phosphorylation of the RyR receptors causes partial dissociation of calstabins from RyRs. Dissociation of calstabin from RyR causes increased open probability of RyR, and therefore increased Ca\n2+\n release from the SR into the intracellular cytoplasm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCa\n2+\n release from the SR in skeletal muscle cells and heart cells is a key physiological mechanism that controls muscle performance, because increased concentration of Ca\n2+\n in the intracellular cytoplasm causes contraction of the muscle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExcitation-contraction (EC) coupling in skeletal muscles involves electrical depolarization of the plasma membrane in the transverse tubule (T-tubule), which activates voltage-gated L-type Ca\n2+\n channels (LTCCs). LTCCs trigger Ca\n2+\n release from the SR through physical interaction with RyR1. The resulting increase in cytoplasmic Ca\n2+\n concentration induces actin-myosin interaction and muscle contraction. To enable relaxation, intracellular Ca\n2+\n is pumped back into the SR via SR Ca\n2+\n-ATPase pumps (SERCAs), which is regulated by phospholamban (PLB) depending on the muscle fiber type.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt has been shown that disease forms that result in sustained activation of the sympathetic nervous system and increased plasma catecholamine levels cause maladaptive activation of intracellular stress pathways resulting in destabilization of the RyR1 channel closed state and intracellular Ca\n2+\n leak. SR Ca\n2+\n leak via RyR1 channels was found to deplete intracellular SR calcium stores, to increase compensatory energy consumption, and to result in significant acceleration of muscle fatigue. The stress-induced muscle defect permanently reduces isolated muscle and in vivo performance particularly in situations of increased demand.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt also has been shown that destabilization of the RyR1 closed state occurs under pathologic conditions of increased sympathetic activation and involves depletion of the stabilizing calstabin1 (FKBP12) channel subunit. Proof-of-principle experiments have shown that PKA activation as an end effector of the sympathetic nervous systems increases RyR1 PKA phosphorylation at Ser-2843 which decreases the binding affinity of calstabin1 to RyR1 and increases channel open probability.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn cardiac striated muscle, RyR2 is the major Ca\n2+\n-release channel required for EC coupling and muscle contraction. During EC coupling, depolarization of the cardiac-muscle cell membrane during phase zero of the action potential activates voltage-gated Ca\n2+\n channels. Ca\n2+\n influx through the open voltage-gated channels in turn initiates Ca\n2+\n release from the SR via RyR2. This process is known as Ca\n2+\n-induced Ca\n2+\n release. The RyR2-mediated, Ca\n2+\n-induced Ca\n2+\n release then activates the contractile proteins in the cardiac cell, resulting in cardiac muscle contraction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPhosphorylation of cardiac RyR2 by PKA is an important part of the “fight or flight” response that increases cardiac EC coupling gain by augmenting the amount of Ca\n2+\n released for a given trigger. This signaling pathway provides a mechanism by which activation of the sympathetic nervous system, in response to stress, results in increased cardiac output. PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 increases the open probability of the channel by dissociating calstabin2 (FKBP12.6) from the channel complex. This, in turn, increases the sensitivity of RyR2 to Ca\n2+\n-dependent activation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDespite advances in treatment, heart failure remains an important cause of mortality in Western countries. An important hallmark of heart failure is reduced myocardial contractility. In heart failure, contractile abnormalities result, in part, from alterations in the signaling pathway that allows the cardiac action potential to trigger Ca\n2+\n release via RyR2 channels and muscle contraction. In particular, in failing hearts, the amplitude of the whole-cell Ca\n2+\n transient is decreased and the duration prolonged.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCardiac arrhythmia, a common feature of heart failure, results in many of the deaths associated with the disease. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia in humans, and represents a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Structural and electrical remodeling—including shortening of atrial refractoriness, loss of rate-related adaptation of refractoriness, and shortening of the wavelength of re-entrant wavelets—accompany sustained tachycardia. This remodeling is likely important in the development, maintenance and progression of atrial fibrillation. Studies suggest that calcium handling plays a role in electrical remodeling in atrial fibrillation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nApproximately 50% of all patients with heart disease die from fatal cardiac arrhythmias. In some cases, a ventricular arrhythmia in the heart is rapidly fatal—a phenomenon referred to as “sudden cardiac death” (SCD). Fatal ventricular arrhythmias and SCD also occur in young, otherwise-healthy individuals who are not known to have structural heart disease. In fact, ventricular arrhythmia is the most common cause of sudden death in otherwise-healthy individuals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCatecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited disorder in individuals with structurally normal hearts. It is characterized by stress-induced ventricular tachycardia—a lethal arrhythmia that causes SCD. In subjects with CPVT, physical exertion and/or stress induce bidirectional and/or polymorphic ventricular tachycardias that lead to SCD even in the absence of detectable structural heart disease. CPVT is predominantly inherited in an autosomal-dominant fashion. Individuals with CPVT have ventricular arrhythmias when subjected to exercise, but do not develop arrhythmias at rest. Studies have identified mutations in the human RyR2 gene, on chromosome 1q42-q43, in individuals with CPVT.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFailing hearts (e.g., in patients with heart failure and in animal models of heart failure) are characterized by a maladaptive response that includes chronic hyperadrenergic stimulation. In heart failure, chronic beta-adrenergic stimulation is associated with the activation of beta-adrenergic receptors in the heart, which, through coupling with G-proteins, activate adenylyl cyclase and thereby increase intracellular cAMP concentration. CAMP activates cAMP-dependent PKA, which has been shown to induce hyperphosphorylation of RyR2. Thus, chronic heart failure is a chronic hyperadrenergic state that results in several pathologic consequences, including PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 has been proposed as a factor contributing to depressed contractile function and arrhythmogenesis in heart failure. Consistent with this hypothesis, PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 in failing hearts has been demonstrated, in vivo, both in animal models and in patients with heart failure undergoing cardiac transplantation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn failing hearts, the hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 by PKA induces the dissociation of FKBP12.6 (calstabin2) from the RyR2 channel. This causes marked changes in the biophysical properties of the RyR2 channel, including increased open probability (Po) due to an increased sensitivity to Ca\n2+\n-dependent activation; destabilization of the channel, resulting in subconductance states; and impaired coupled gating of the channels, resulting in defective EC coupling and cardiac dysfunction. Thus, PKA-hyperphosphorylated RyR2 is very sensitive to low-level Ca\n2+\n stimulation, and this manifests itself as a diastolic SR Ca\n2+\n leak through the PKA hyperphosphorylated RyR2 channel.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe maladaptive response to stress in heart failure results in depletion of FKBP12.6 from the channel macromolecular complex. This leads to a shift to the left in the sensitivity of RyR2 to Ca\n2+\n-induced Ca\n2+\n release, resulting in channels that are more active at low-to-moderate Ca\n2+\n concentrations. Over time, the increased “leak” through RyR2 results in resetting of the SR Ca\n2+\n content to a lower level, which in turn reduces EC coupling gain and contributes to impaired systolic contractility.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, a subpopulation of RyR2 that are particularly “leaky” can release SR Ca\n2+\n during the resting phase of the cardiac cycle, diastole. This results in depolarizations of the cardiomyocyte membrane known as delayed after-depolarizations (DADs), which are known to trigger fatal ventricular cardiac arrhythmias.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn patients with CPVT mutations in their RyR2 and otherwise structurally-normal hearts, a similar phenomenon is at work. Specifically, it is known that exercise and stress induce the release of catecholamines that activate beta-adrenergic receptors in the heart. Activation of the beta-adrenergic receptors leads to PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 channels. Evidence also suggests that the PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 resulting from beta-adrenergic-receptor activation renders mutated RyR2 channels more likely to open in the relaxation phase of the cardiac cycle, increasing the likelihood of arrhythmias.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCardiac arrhythmias are known to be associated with diastolic SR Ca\n2+\n leaks in patients with CPVT mutations in their RyR2 and otherwise structurally-normal hearts. In these cases, the most common mechanism for induction and maintenance of ventricular tachycardia is abnormal automaticity. One form of abnormal automaticity, known as triggered arrhythmia, is associated with aberrant release of SR Ca\n2+\n, which initiates DADs. DADs are abnormal depolarizations in cardiomyocytes that occur after repolarization of a cardiac action potential. The molecular basis for the abnormal SR Ca\n2+\n release that results in DADs has not been fully elucidated. However, DADs are known to be blocked by ryanodine, providing evidence that RyR2 plays a key role in the pathogenesis of this aberrant Ca\n2+\n release.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt has been shown that exercise-induced arrhythmias and sudden death (in patients with CPVT) result from a reduced affinity of FKBP12.6 (calstabin2) for RyR2. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that exercise activates RyR2 as a result of phosphorylation by \nadenosine\n 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Mutant RyR2 channels, which had normal function in planar lipid bilayers under basal conditions, were more sensitive to activation by PKA phosphorylation—exhibiting increased activity (open probability) and prolonged open states, as compared with wild-type channels. In addition, PKA-phosphorylated mutant RyR2 channels were resistant to inhibition by Mg\n2+\n, a physiological inhibitor of the channel, and showed reduced binding to FKBP12.6 (aka calstabin2, which stabilizes the channel in the closed state). These findings indicate that, during exercise, when the RyR2 are PKA-phosphorylated, the mutant CPVT channels are more likely to open in the relaxation phase of the cardiac cycle (diastole), increasing the likelihood of arrhythmias triggered by SR Ca\n2+\n leak.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFatigue is the process whereby skeletal muscles become weaker with repeated or intense use such as exercise, or as a result of an illness, disorder or disease. Fatigue can result in task failure and it can be a pronounced symptom in a variety of medical conditions including heart failure, renal failure, cancer, and various muscular dystrophies. Over the past decade, it has become evident that the two dominant classical explanations of muscle fatigue, namely, accumulation of lactic acid and intracellular acidosis, do not cause fatigue. In fact, both may be protective mechanisms during high intensity exercise to prevent fatigue (Allen and Westerblad 2004; Pedersen, Nielsen et al. 2004).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMuscle contraction depends on the efficient coupling of electrical stimulation of the muscle surface to Ca\n2+\n release via the ryanodine receptor, the SR Ca\n2+\n release channel, to the generation of actinmyosin cross bridges. It is evident, then, that a defect in excitation-contraction coupling that resulted in a reduction in the amplitude of the Ca\n2+\n transient would, among other effects, result in impaired contraction and force generation through ineffective myosin cross bridge formation. Eberstein and Sandow suggested inhibition of Ca\n2+\n release as a likely factor in the fatigue process (Eberstein and Sandow 1963). Reductions in the amplitude of Ca\n2+\n release evoked during fatiguing stimulation have been reported in multiple muscle preparations (Allen, Lee et al. 1989; Westerblad and Allen 1991; Allen and Westerblad 2001). The time course of recovery from fatigue parallels the time course over which prolonged depression of Ca\n2+\n release is observed (Westerblad, Bruton et al. 2000).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSR Ca\n2+\n leak was documented in myofibers following intense exercise and in a model of muscular dystrophy (Wang, Weisleder et al. 2005), possibly due to defective skeletal ryanodine receptors (RyR1s). Chronic activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) in the context of heart failure promotes intrinsic skeletal muscle fatigue due to depletion of the phosphodiesterease PDE4D3 from the RyR1 complex, RyR1 PKA hyperphosphorylation at \nSerine\n 2844, calstabin1 depletion from the RyR1 complex, and a gain-of-function channel defect (Reiken, Lacampagne et al. 2003). RyR1 dysfunction in the skeletal muscle leads to altered local subcellular Ca\n2+\n release events and impaired global calcium transients (Ward, Reiken et al. 2003). JTV-519, (4-[3-(4-benzylpiperidin-1-yl)propionyl]-7-methoxy-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1,4-benzothiazepine monohydrochloride-a 1,4-benzothiazepine has been shown to be a modulator of RyR calcium-ion channels), given in the context of a murine model of heart failure, was able to improve skeletal muscle function, as assessed by an ex vivo isolated muscle fatiguing protocol, five weeks after left coronary artery ligation. JTV-519's beneficial effect on muscle fatigue was not solely due to cardiac improvement, as a beneficial effect was still seen when the drug was given to calstabin2 deficient mice which derive no cardiac benefit from treatment with JTV-519. Thus, it has been postulated that JTV-519 directly affects muscle function (Wehrens, Lehnart et al. 2005). In the context of chronic exercise, identical changes in the RyR1 macromolecular complex, namely depletion of PDE4D3 from the RyR1 complex, RyR1 PKA hyperphosphorylation at \nSerine\n 2844, and calstabin1 depletion from the RyR1 complex are related in a time-dependent and activity-dependent manner with repeated intense exercise in a mouse model. These biochemical changes in the RyR1 macromolecular complex regulation and function are stable following prolonged exercise and recover slowly over days to weeks. It has therefore been proposed that RyR1 Ca\n2+\n leak limits peak muscle performance and mediates muscle damage during prolonged, stressful exercise.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe contraction of striated muscle is initiated when calcium (Ca\n2+\n) is released from tubules within the muscle cell known as the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Calcium release channels, called ryanodine receptors (RyR), on the SR are required for excitation-contraction (EC) coupling. The \ntype\n 2 ryanodine receptor (RyR2) is found in the heart, while the \ntype\n 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1) is found in skeletal muscle. The RyR1 receptor is a tetramer comprised of four 565,000 dalton RyR1 polypeptides and four 12,000 dalton FK-506 binding proteins (FKBP12). FKBP12s are regulatory subunits that stabilize RyR channel function (Brillantes et al., 1994) and facilitate coupled gating between neighboring RyR channels (Marx et al., 1998); the latter are packed into dense arrays in specialized SR regions that release intracellular stores of Ca\n2+\n, thereby triggering muscle contraction. In addition to FKBP12, the RyR1 macromolecular complex also includes the catalytic and regulatory subunits of PKA, and the phosphatase PP1 (Marx et al., 2001).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne FKBP12 molecule is bound to each RyR1 subunit. Dissociation of FKBP12 significantly alters the biophysical properties of the channels, resulting in the appearance of subconductance states, and increased open probability (P\no\n) of the channels (Brillantes et al., 1994; Gaburjakova et al., 2001). In addition, dissociation of FKBP12 from RyR1 channels inhibits coupled gating resulting in channels that gate stochastically rather than as an ensemble (Marx et al., 1998). Coupled gating of arrays of RyR channels is thought to be important for efficient EC coupling that regulates muscle contraction (Marx et al., 1998). FKBPs are cis-trans peptidyl-prolyl isomerases that are widely expressed and subserve a variety of cellular functions (Marks, 1996). FKBP12s are tightly bound to and regulate the function of the skeletal (RyR1) (Brillantes et al., 1994; Jayaraman et al., 1992) and cardiac (RyR2) (Kaftan et al., 1996) muscle Ca\n2+\n release channels, as well as a related intracellular Ca\n2+\n release channel known as the \ntype\n 1 \n \ninositol\n \n 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (IP3R1) (Cameron et al., 1997), and the type I transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) receptor (TβRI) (Chen et al., 1997).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nU.S. Pat.

The initial definition provided for a chemical group or term herein applies to that group or term throughout the present specification individually or as part of another group, unless otherwise indicated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein and in the appended claims, the singular forms “a,” “an,” and “the” include plural references unless the content clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to “an agent” includes a plurality of such agents and equivalents thereof known to those skilled in the art, and reference to “the FKBP12.6 polypeptide” is a reference to one or more FKBP12.6 polypeptides (also known as calstabin2) and equivalents thereof known to those skilled in the art, and so forth. All publications, patent applications, patents, and other references mentioned herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein the term “fatigue” refers to skeletal muscle fatigue and/or weakness. Muscle fatigue can be due to strenuous or repeated physical activity or exercise, chronic stress, disease, disorder, syndrome or any other underlying pathophysiological condition that has symptoms of fatigue, or affects myofibers and/or muscle function. Muscle fatigue is defined as the failure of exercise performance—this can be assessed on an exercise stress test and quantified as the time it takes to fail at the given task (e.g. walking/jogging/running on a treadmill). Failure at the task is defined as termination of the exercise due to inability to continue—this is defined as muscle fatigue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSustained or prolonged exercise is defined as exercise performed over a defined and measurable time period.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStrenuous exercise is exercise to evoke muscle fatigue within a defined time period.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChronic stress is defined as conditions that cause muscle fatigue chronically either due to persistent chronic exercise or stress due to chronic diseases/disorders that are often associated with chronic activation of the sympathetic nervous systems (e.g., chronic activation of the “fight or flight” response). In one embodiment, the subject's defective skeletal muscle function occurs during chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, asthma, or hyperthyroidism.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain aspects, the present invention is directed to compositions and methods for the treatment and prevention of myopathies.

Examples of mitochondrial myopathies include, but are not limited to, Kearns-Sayre syndrome, MELAS and MERRF. MELAS which is an abbreviation of “mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke” is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. MELAS affects multiple organ systems including the central nervous system (CNS), skeletal muscle, the eye, cardiac muscle, and, more rarely, the gastrointestinal and renal systems. MERFF, which is an abbreviation of “myoclonus epilepsy with ragged-red fibers” may cause epilepsy, coordination loss, dementia and muscle weakness. Examples of glycogen storage diseases of muscle include, but are not limited to, Pompe's disease, Andersen's disease, and Cori's diseases. Examples of myoglobinurias include, but are not limited to McArdle's disease, Tarui disease, and DiMauro disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following are definitions of terms used in the present specification.

Thus in one embodiment, the compounds of the invention are useful for treating muscle fatigue in individuals exposed to stress due to, for example, an intense exercise regimen. Skeletal muscular disorder and diseases include, but are not limited to, stress induced skeletal muscle fatigue, exercise-induced skeletal muscle fatigue, muscular dystrophy, bladder disorders, and incontinence.\n\n\n \nSkeletal Muscle Fatigue\n\n\n \n \n \nDefects in Ca2\n+\n release channel; for example increased “leakiness” of the channel can lead to skeletal muscle fatigue. In certain aspects the invention provides that RyCal compounds which treat defects in Ca2\n+\n release channel can be used in methods for treating, reducing or preventing muscle disorders, muscle fatigue, including but not limited to exercise-induced muscle fatigue or muscle damage, muscle fatigue or damage associated with a disease condition, for example but not limited to a myopathy, muscular dystrophy and the like. Recent studies suggesting that lactic acid accumulation may not be detrimental have raised questions about the molecular basis underlying skeletal muscle fatigue. Among hypotheses a role for defective regulation of calcium has been proposed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention provides data showing altered function of the major calcium release channel in skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), the \ntype\n 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1), is required for excitation-contraction coupling (ECC), during chronic exercise. During chronic exercise the RyR1 channel is PKA hyperphosphorylated at Ser2844 (Ser2843 in human). The PKA hyperphosphorylation is associated with depletion of the phosphodiesterase PDE4D3 from the RyR1 complex. Furthermore, PKA hyperphosphorylation contribute to depletion of the RyR1 stabilizing subunit calstabin1 (FKBP12) from the channel macromolecular complex resulting in “leaky” channels (increased open probability under conditions when normal channels are not active). The degree of PKA phosphorylation, and depletion of calstabin1 and PDE4D3 are correlated with the intensity and duration of exercise and progressive fatigue. Mice with skeletal muscle-specific calstabin1 deficiency and PDE4D deficient mice both exhibited significantly impaired exercise capacity. A small molecule, S107, that specifically causes rebinding of calstabin1 to the RyR1 channel improved exercise capacity and force generation of isolated muscle during a 21 day exercise protocol. S107 treated muscle fibers exhibited reduced fatigue, as determined by measurement of intracellular calcium during repeated tetanic contractions. Furthermore, S107 treated chronically exercised mice exhibited reduced levels of plasma creatine kinase, and calcium-dependent neutral protease calpain activity in muscle homogenates. This demonstrates the existence of a mechanism of muscle fatigue, during chronic or high-intensity exercise, where SR calcium leak due calstabin1 depleted RyR1 channels leads to defective calcium signaling and skeletal muscle damage. In one aspect, the invention provides use of RyCal compounds which target molecular mechanisms of muscle fatigue, muscle conditions and disorders, and provide treatments treatment thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCalcium release channel stabilizing drugs prevent muscle fatigue by preventing ryanodine receptor calcium leak during sustained or strenuous exercise. Repeated and strenuous activity of skeletal muscle may cause 1) weakness with intense use (also referred to as fatigue), 2) feeling of sore and weak muscles (referred to as perception), and 3) different degrees of muscle degeneration (referred to as dystrophic remodeling). A dominant theory of muscle fatigue has been that accumulation of intracellular lactic acid resulting in intracellular acidosis directly inhibits force production by the myofibrillar proteins (Hill et al., 1929). Indeed, at lower than physiologic temperatures (20° C.), acidotic changes of intracellular pH were found to accelerate fatigability of skeletal muscles (Hill at al., 1929). However, more recent studies have challenged the significance of acidosis for muscle fatigue by showing that repeated short tetanic contractions which induce fatigue do not result in significant intracellular pH changes under more physiologic conditions at 37° C. (Westerblad at al., 1997) where acidosis does not significantly effect force production. These findings are consistent with lactic acid which is produced during fatiguing contractions being extruded at a substantial rate by lactate transporters. However, during very intense athletic training lactic acid resulting from anaerobic breakdown of glycogen remains an important limiting factor. Importantly, intracellular acidosis was found to preserve muscle excitability and relaxation of the myofilaments during sustained increases of intracellular Ca\n2+\n during repeated or sustained tetanic contractions, and thus protects from muscle fatigue (Pedersen at al. 2004).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGiven that changes in intracellular pH may not represent a major fatigue mechanism, it is likely that alterations in EC coupling contribute to fatigue. Intracellular Ca\n2+\n release via RyR1 channels initiates muscle contraction. Now classic physiologic experiments suggested in 1963, that reversible alterations in contractile activation may play an important role in muscle fatigue (Eberstein et al., 1963). During progressive development of fatigue resulting from repeated tetanic contractions, elevations in intracellular Ca\n2+\n concentrations decline which explains reduced force production (Allen et al., 2001). However, caffeine and other compounds, which maximally activate RyR1 channels and cause sudden SR Ca\n2+\n release, can briefly normalize tetanic Ca\n2+\n concentrations (Allen at al., 2001). Thus alterations of RyR1-dependent SR Ca\n2+\n release mechanisms are likely to be involved in fatigue development.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMeasurements of SR Ca\n2+\n load have demonstrated a decreased pool of releasable Ca\n2+\n during skeletal muscle fatigue, which may be one of the causes of reduced SR Ca\n2+\n release during fatigue. (Cooke at al. 1985). Another theory involves increased intracellular inorganic phosphate concentrations ([P\ni\n]\ni\n) precipitating Ca\n2+\n in the SR storage organelle (Allen, 2001; Cooke, 1985). However, [P\ni\n]\ni \nincreases occur during the early phase of fatigue resulting from rapid ATP breakdown whereas the decline of tetanic [Ca\n2+\n]\ni \noccurs late in fatigue (phase iii). Moreover, after repeated, stretched contractions resting [Ca\n2+\n]\ni \nwas found elevated while stimulated, tetanic [Ca\n2+\n]\ni \ndecreased (Warren et al. 1993; Balnave et al. 1995). The increased resting [Ca\n2+\n]\ni \nmay initiate chronic impairment of EC coupling for example by activating proteases that can damage the SR Ca\n2+\n release channel (Lamb et al., 1995; Chin et al., 1996; Bruton et al., 1996).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFatigue from chronically sustained exercise may be caused by SR Ca\n2+\n leak resulting from defective closure of the RyR1 channel and partial depletion of the SR Ca\n2+\n store contributing to diminished force production and increased resting [Ca\n2+\n]\ni \ninterfering with muscle relaxation and when sustained causing muscle degeneration. Recent data shows that an evolutionary conserved stress pathway, the fight-or-flight response, specifically controls RyR1 Ca\n2+\n release in skeletal muscle (Gaburjakova et al., 2001; Marx et al., 2001) and that abnormal, chronic activation of this stress pathway causes SR Ca\n2+\n leak contributing to muscle fatigue (Reiken et al., 2003).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRyR1/calcium release channels become PKA hyperphosphorylated and depleted of the stabilizing protein calstabin1 during exercise. RyCal compounds of the invention increase the binding affinity of calstabin1 to PKA hyperphosphorylated RyR1. These compounds are called “calcium channel stabilizers” or “RyCals” and are in a class of 1,4-benzothiazepines and related structures. In a non-limiting example, treatment with a RyCal compound improves exercise performance of mice running on a treadmill. Furthermore, there is evidence that a calcium leak via PKA hyperphosphorylated RyR1 channels causes muscle damage due to activation of calcium-dependent proteases and RyCals prevent the calcium leak and inhibit muscle damage during chronic exercise. In certain embodiments, RyCal compound can be used to treat, prevent or improve muscle fatigue in chronic diseases including but not limited to heart failure, AIDS, cancer, renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, asthma, hyperthyroidism, chronic muscle fatigue. In other embodiments, RyCal compound can be used to treat or improve muscular dystrophies. In other embodiments, treatment with RyCal compound can prevent or reduce muscle fatigue which can improve exercise performance in individuals who are exposed to sustained chronic stress and/or physical exercise. In other embodiments, treatment with RyCals can prevent or reduce muscle fatigue which can improve exercise performance in individuals who are exposed to strenuous physical exercise.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSkeletal muscles become weaker with intense use also referred to as fatigue. Moreover, repeated stretch-dependent contractures can result in additional muscle damage and degeneration. Although fatigue is recognized as an important mechanism of limited peak performance and task failure during stress, the mechanisms that promote fatigue or muscle fiber damage are incompletely characterized. Moreover, defining molecular fatigue mechanisms may enable targeted interventions that could help prevent fatigue and muscle tissue damage (Wehrens, 2005). A key physiologic mechanism that controls skeletal muscle performance is intracellular calcium (Ca\n2+\n) release from specialized Ca\n2+\n stores (the sarcoplasmic reticulum, SR) via ryanodine receptor (RyR1) Ca\n2+\n release channels. In skeletal muscle, plasma membrane depolarization activates voltage-gated L-type Ca\n2+\n channels (LTCCs; Ca\nV\n1.1) which in turn activate RyR1s on the SR mediated by direct contact between both ion channels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOpening of RyR1 channels results in bulk SR Ca\n2+\n release which activates the myofilaments and muscle contraction. Also, disease forms associated with sustained activation of the sympathetic nervous system and increased plasma catecholamine levels cause maladaptive activation of intracellular stress pathways resulting in destabilization of the RyR1 channel closed state and intracellular Ca\n2+\n leak (Reiken et al. 2003; Brillantes et al. 1994). SR Ca\n2+\n leak via RyR1 channels was found to deplete intracellular SR calcium stores, to increase compensatory energy consumption, and to result in significant acceleration of muscle fatigue. The stress-induced muscle defect limits peak performance and contributes to pathologic forms of muscle fatigue that permanently reduce performance. Also, destabilization of the RyR1 closed state involves depletion of the stabilizing calstabin1 (FKBP12) channel subunit (Reiken et al. 2003; Brillantes et al. 1994). Experiments demonstrate that increasing the binding affinity of calstabin to RyR rescues channel function (Wehrens, 2003).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSkeletal muscle contraction is activated by SR Ca\n2+\n release via the \ntype\n 1 skeletal ryanodine receptor (RyR1). Depolarization of the T-tubule membrane activates the dihydropyridine receptor voltage sensor (Cav1.1) which in turn activates RyR1 channels via a direct protein-protein interaction causing the release of SR Ca\n2+\n stores. Ca\n2+\n binds to troponin C allowing actin-myosin cross-bridging to occur and sarcomere shortening. Ca\n2+\n release channels comprise macromolecular complexes consisting of a homotetramer of 560 kDa RyR1 subunits that form scaffolds for proteins that regulate channel function including: protein kinase A and the phosphodiesterase PDE4D3, both of which are targeted to the channel via the anchoring protein mAKAP, PP1 (targeted via spinophilin), and calstabin1 (FKBP12) (Jayaraman, Brillantes et al. 1992; Brillantes, Ondrias et al. 1994; Marx, Reiken et al. 2000; Marx, Reiken et al. 2001).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA defect in ECC that resulted in a reduction in the amplitude of SR Ca\n2+\n release would impair contraction and force generation. Eberstein and Sandow proposed impaired SR Ca\n2+\n release as a likely contributor to muscle fatigue (Eberstein and Sandow 1963). Reductions in the amplitude of SR Ca\n2+\n release evoked during fatiguing stimulation have been reported (Allen, Lee et al. 1989; Westerblad and Allen 1991; Allen and Westerblad 2001). In addition, it has been shown that Ca\n2+\n stores decline during intense and repeated contractions (Kabbara & Allen, 1999), and that the time course of recovery from fatigue parallels the time course over which prolonged depression of SR Ca\n2+\n release is observed (Westerblad, Bruton et al. 2000). Furthermore, reduction of free SR Ca\n2+\n, due to inorganic calcium phosphate salt precipitation during fatigue, has been proposed (Allen and Westerblad 2001).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEvidence of defective SR Ca\n2+\n release in fatigued muscle prompted examination of the role of RyR1 mediated SR Ca\n2+\n release in skeletal muscle fatigue. The binding of calstabin1 (FKBP12) to RyR1 stabilizes the closed state of the channel and facilitates coupled gating between neighboring channels (Brillantes, Ondrias et al. 1994; Marx, Ondrias et al. 1998). Pharmacologic depletion of calstabin1 from RyR1 (with rapamycin or FK506 both of which bind to calstabin1 and dissociate it from the RyR1 macromolecular complex) promotes subconductance states and, in intact skeletal muscle, can cause a rapid loss of depolarization-induced contraction (Lamb and Stephenson 1996). Mutation of RyR1 resulting in the loss of calstabin1 binding causes impaired ECC with reduced maximal voltage-gated SR Ca\n2+\n release without affecting the SR Ca\n2+\n store content (Avila, Lee et al. 2003). Genetic deletion of FKBP12 (calstabin1) induced no gross histological or developmental defect in skeletal muscle, though severe developmental cardiac defects were observed which precluded detailed assessment of skeletal muscle function (Shou, Aghdasi et al. 1998). Whereas skeletal muscle-specific knock-out of FKBP12 (calstabin1) resulted in reduced voltage-gated SR Ca\n2+\n release and increased L-type channel currents in isolated myotubes (Tang, Ingalls et al. 2004). In extensor digitalis longus (EDL), but not soleus or diaphragm, reduced maximal tetanic force and a rightward shift in force-frequency relationships were observed (Tang, Ingalls et al. 2004). These data indicated that calstabin1 modulates the gain of ECC in skeletal muscle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe binding of calstabin1 to RyR1 is regulated by PKA phosphorylation at RyR1-S2843 (position S2844 in the mouse RyR1 sequence) (Reiken, Lacampagne et al. 2003). Phosphorylation at RyR1-S2843 increases the mean open probability of RyR1 in the lipid bilayer (Reiken, Lacampagne et al. 2003). RyR1-S2843A mutant channels could not be PKA phosphorylated and did not show the same PKA-dependent increase in open probability. An RyR1-S2843D mutation mimicked PKA phosphorylation with an increased open probability and destabilized open and closed states (Reiken, Lacampagne et al. 2003). The role of PKA phosphorylation of RyR1 is still under investigation as other groups have found little or no effect on channel function (Stange, Xu et al. 2003). Other post-translational modifications of RyR1 which might modulate calstabin1 binding to RyR1 have been suggested, including oxidation, and glutathionylation of the up to 50 free (reduced) thiols on each RyR monomer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSR Ca\n2+\n leak has been documented as aberrant calcium sparks in myofibers following intense exercise and in a model of muscular dystrophy (Wang, Weisleder et al. 2005), possibly due to defective RyR1 function. Chronic activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) during heart failure is associated with early skeletal muscle fatigue and PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR1 at Ser2844 (meaning that on average 3-4 of the four PKA sites in each homotetrameric channel are PKA phosphorylated in heart failure skeletal muscle), calstabin1 depletion from the RyR1 complex, and a gain-of-function channel defect (Reiken, Lacampagne et al. 2003). RyR1 dysfunction in skeletal muscle leads to altered local subcellular Ca\n2+\n release events (Ward, Reiken et al. 2003).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModifications in the RyR1 complex could alter and are likely to limit peak muscle performance, increase muscle fatigue, and contribute to muscle damage during prolonged or high intensity exercise. In certain aspects the invention provides use of a mouse model of chronic, high-intensity, forced exercise to assess the role of the RyR1 channel in skeletal muscle fatigue. As described herein, the RyR1 channel macromolecular complex undergoes remodeling during exercise such that it is progressively PKA hyperphosphorylated, and depleted of PDE4D3 and calstabin1. Functionally, this remodeling is associated with “leaky” channels (increased open probability) and activation of the calcium-activated protease calpain, and leakage of creatine kinase (CPK) into the plasma, which is consistent with muscle damage. These changes are further associated with decreased force production in isolated muscles and impaired exercise capacity and are exacerbated in mice with PDE4D deficiency or muscle specific calstabin1 deficiency. Preventing the RyR1 channel leak with a calcium channel stabilizer S107, which enhances binding of calstabin1 to RyR1, inhibits calpain activation, CPK leak and improves exercise performance. Therefore, remodeling of the RyR1 channel complex that causes leaky channels, activation of the calcium-activated protease calpain, and leakage of creatine kinase (CPK) into the plasma, is a mechanism involved in muscle fatigue during chronic or high intensity exercise.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConfocal imaging studies of intracellular Ca\n2+\n release (Ca\n2+\n sparks) in muscle cells after mild and strenuous treadmill exercise, showing that abnormal Ca\n2+\n spark activity is induced by fatiguing exercise (Wang et al. 2005). Moreover, myofibers with abnormal Ca\n2+\n spark activity resulting form strenuous exercise show histological signs of degeneration from toxic Ca\n2+\n effects also known as ‘dystrophic remodeling’ (Wang et al. 2005). It is likely that sustained exercise over weeks and months results in RyR1 dysfunction, intracellular Ca\n2+\n leak, depressed muscle performance, and dystrophic muscle remodeling. Furthermore, 1,4-benzothiazepine based drugs enhance peak muscle performance and prevent dystrophic remodeling by fixing stress-induced intracellular Ca\n2+\n leak.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnimal models can establish, in vivo and at the level of isolated skeletal muscle cell, and single RyR1 channel, that defects in RyR1 function cause muscle fatigue and dystrophic remodeling. Use of these animal models of fatigue and the characterized muscle, cells, and channel techniques allows tests of therapeutic approaches based on fixing the leak in RyR1 which will result in improved skeletal muscle performance, decreased muscle fatigue, and reduced dystrophic remodeling during chronic forms of exercise.\n\n\n \nMuscular Dystrophy\n\n\n \n \n \nMyotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), the most common muscular dystrophy in adults (1 in 7,400 live births), is a multisystemic disorder caused by a CTG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 3′ untranslated region of the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) gene which causes progressive muscle weakness, inherited muscle hyperexitability (myotonia), cardiac conduction defect, cataract, and insulin resistance (Bachinski L L, Udd B, Meola G, et al.

The mutant DMPK messenger RNA (mRNA) containing an expanded CUG repeat is retained in the nucleus and protein levels are reduced (Mankodi A, Logigian E, Callahan L, et al. Myotonic dystrophy in transgenic mice expressing an expanded CUG repeat. \nScience\n. Sep. 8, 2000; 289(5485):1769-1773). The RNA repeat expansion changes the chromatin structure, silences the expression of the flanking SIX5 gene which codes for a transcription factors, and disrupts regulation of gene expression during development and exercise (Ebralidze A, Wang Y, Petkova V, et al. RNA leaching of transcription factors disrupts transcription in myotonic dystrophy. \nScience\n. Jan. 16, 2004; 303(5656):383-387).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cause of the most severe symptoms including muscle weakness and progressive muscle wasting appear to be caused by elevated intracellular Ca\n2+\n concentrations and subsequent myofiber degeneration in DM1 (Jacobs A E, Benders A A, Oosterhof A, et al. The calcium homeostasis and the membrane potential of cultured muscle cells from patients with myotonic dystrophy. \nBiochim Biophys Acta\n. Nov. 14, 1990; 1096(1):14-19). Moreover, a recent study has linked disturbed Ca\n2+\n cycling in DM1 to aberrant splicing of RyR1 and SR Ca\n2+\n ATPase (SERCA1) mRNAs (Kimura T, Nakamori M, Lueck J D, et al. Altered mRNA Splicing of the Skeletal Muscle Ryanodine Receptor and Sarcoplasmic/Endoplasmic Reticulum Ca2+-ATPase in \nMyotonic Dystrophy Type\n 1. \nHum Mol Genet\n. Jun. 22, 2005). A muscle-specific genetic mouse model HSA\nLR \nof DM1 exists in which expanded CUG repeat expression results in a DM-like phenotype (Mankodi A, Logigian E, Callahan L, et al. Myotonic dystrophy in transgenic mice expressing an expanded CUG repeat. \nScience\n. Sep. 8, 2000; 289(5485):1769-1773). HSA\nLR \nhave a myotonic phenotype in the absence of muscle fiber necrosis and the short-versus long-repeat expressing mouse lines show relatively less or more histopathological signs of muscle regeneration and repair, respectively (Mankodi A, Logigian E, Callahan L, et al. Myotonic dystrophy in transgenic mice expressing an expanded CUG repeat. \nScience\n. Sep. 8, 2000; 289(5485):1769-1773). Since HSA\nLR \nmice with short- or long repeat expression show no signs of muscle weakness and since RyR1 alterations have been linked to DM1, the HSA\nLR \nmice provide a model to study the effects of exercise and activation of the sympathetic nervous system in these mice. After characterizing RyR1 channel composition, phosphorylation status, and function, the HSA\nLR \nmice can be challenge with sustained exercise tests and treated with RyCal compounds. Since the mechanism by which transcripts with expanded CUG repeats cause myotonia and muscle degeneration in DM1 is not known, this would provide 1) study of a genetic animal model of severe fatigue, 2) elucidation of the key molecular mechanism of DM1, and 3) developing a therapeutic rationale for the most common muscular dystrophy in adults.\n\n\n \nStress Pathways and Muscle Fatigue\n\n\n \n \n \nSustained activation of intracellular stress pathways such as occurring during strenuous physical exercise, for example but not limited to combat, can result in reduced muscle performance and tissue damage. A major determinant of muscle damage may occur due to toxicity of continuously high catecholamine levels resulting in intracellular Ca\n2+\n leak. This concept is supported by: 1) physiologic (non-combat) exercise or stress was reported to induce muscle weakness, cramps, and tissue atrophy in susceptible individuals (stress-induced rhabdomyolysis) (Wappler et al., 2001); 2) strenuous but not mild treadmill exercise induces a significantly elevated Ca\n2+\n spark frequency in muscle cells indicating intracellular Ca\n2+\n leak (Wang et al., 2005); 3) excess catecholamine levels were found in malignant hyperthermia (MH) and central core disease (CCD) contributing to uncontrolled intracellular Ca\n2+\n release (Monnier et al. 2000; MacLennan et al. 1995); 4) a majority of MH/CCD were linked to RyR1 missense mutations (Loke et al., 2003); 5) a hyperadrenergic state as occurring in heart failure causes RyR1 hyperphosphorylation, Ca\n2+\n leak, and skeletal muscle fatigue (Reiken et al. 2003); and 6) excess plasma catecholamine levels by activating β-adrenergic receptors, intracellular cAMP synthesis and protein kinase A phosphorylation results in muscle damage (Goldspink et al., 2004; Tan et al. 2003). Stress-dependent muscle damage and dysfunction occurs at the interface between intracellular catecholamine effectors (protein kinase A, PKA) and intracellular Ca\n2+\n release. Skeletal ryanodine receptor (RyR1) Ca\n2+\n release channels constitute intracellular scaffolds that integrate PKA-mediated stress signaling and regulation of intracellular Ca\n2+\n release and therefore determine the gain of EC coupling and muscle function. Importantly, chronically increased PKA phosphorylation of RyR1 occurring from a chronic hyperadrenergic state in vivo depletes the stabilizing calstabin1 subunits resulting in SR Ca\n2+\n leak and muscle fatigue. Moreover, these observations extend to an in vivo animal model of fatigue. Therefore, sustained activation of the sympathetic nervous system during continued muscle performance contributes to increased fatigue development and dystrophic skeletal muscle damage. Since skeletal RyR1 Ca\n2+\n release channel is PKA hyperphosphorylated and depleted of the stabilizing calstabin1 subunit after 21 days of intense exercise, wherein similar alterations result in intracellular Ca\n2+\n leak in animals with heart failure, it is likely that chronic (>1 week) forms of exercise result in adverse intracellular Ca\n2+\n leak from defective RyR1 channels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention establishes molecular mechanisms of muscle fatigue occurring from chronically sustained muscle performance. In another aspect the invention provides methods for treating or preventing detrimental intracellular Ca\n2+\n leak and muscle damage by administering \nnovel\n 1,4-benzothiazepine derivatives. The skeletal ryanodine receptor (RyR1) channel is comprised of 4 RyR1 subunits and associated proteins that bind to the cytoplasmic domain of the channel forming a macromolecular signaling complex. Certain aspects of the invention examine mechanisms by which allosteric modulators regulate RyR1 function. Two specific forms of allosteric modulation are examined: 1) regulation of the channel by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) that potently activates channel gating; 2) depletion of the stabilizing subunit calstabin1 from the RyR1 channel during chronically increased PKA phosphorylation resulting from chronic activation of the sympathetic nervous system by strenuous, sustained exercise.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDysregulation of RyR1 by PKA during sustained exercise causes intracellular Ca\n2+\n leak and may be a mechanism of increased muscle fatigue and dystrophic remodeling. In certain aspects, the invention determines the effects of fatiguing exercise on 1) RyR1 PKA phosphorylation; 2) RyR1 channel function examined using RyR1 channels reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers; 3) Calstabin1 binding to RyR1; 4) intracellular Ca\n2+\n sparks in isolated myofibers; 5) isolated skeletal muscle function; 6) mitochondrial integrity, 7) in vivo exercise performance, 8) skeletal muscle histology, fiber type composition and oxidative capacity, 9) creatine kinase (CK) plasma levels, 10) RyR1 PKA phosphorylation and calstabin1 depletion in leukocytes. Calstabin1 depletion during chronically sustained exercise and PKA hyperphosphorylation causes RyR1 hyperactivity, intracellular Ca\n2+\n leak, depletion of SR Ca\n2+\n stores, accelerated fatigue and dystrophic muscle remodeling.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, treatment with any RyCal compound normalizes RyR dysfunction and intracellular Ca\n2+\n leak. RyR1, which are protein kinase A (PKA) hyperphosphorylated and “leaky” in heart failure models and during strenuous exercise, can rebind calstabin1 after RyCal compound treatment, which normalizes single channel and improves muscle performance in heart failure. It is likely that RyCals in vivo and in cells treated with RyCals prevent intracellular Ca\n2+\n leak and normalize RyR1 channel function during sustained exercise.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy preventing RyR1 Ca\n2+\n leak, RyCal compounds improves skeletal muscle fatigue and dystrophic remodeling during strenuous exercise as occurs in combat. By using two animal models of muscle fatigue (swimming and running on a treadmill) in mice and rats, certain aspects of the invention show that treatment with RyCal compounds prevents depletion of calstabin1 from RyR1, which decreases muscle fatigue, improves performance, and inhibits dystrophic muscle remodeling.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain aspects of the invention identify molecular mechanisms of muscle fatigue in myotonic dystrophy (DM1). In certain embodiments, by preventing RyR1 Ca\n2+\n leak, RyCal compounds improve skeletal muscle fatigue times and dystrophic remodeling in mouse models of myotonic dystrophy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther aspects of the invention characterize molecular fatigue mechanisms in genetic mouse models. In certain embodiments, calstabin1 and PDE4D3 knockout mice can be used to further explore molecular fatigue mechanisms and dysregulation during sustained exercise states that contribute to intracellular Ca\n2+\n leak. In other aspects, the compounds of the invention reduce calpain activity. In other aspects, the compounds of the invention reduce plasma creatine kinase activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther aspects of the invention, characterize mechanisms that destabilize the closed state of intracellular calcium (Ca\n2+\n) release channels during chronic activation of the sympathetic nervous system as occurs during sustained exercise and/or in combat. There are two allosteric modulators of skeletal ryanodine receptors (RyR1s), one is PKA and the other one is a stabilizing protein subunit of the channel (calstabin1) (Wehrens et al., 2004). Other aspects of the invention disclose therapeutic and preventive measures wherein a drug molecule that rebinds calstabin1 may prevent skeletal muscle fatigue by normalizing the skeletal (RyR1) ryanodine receptor gating. Protein kinase A (PKA) hyperphosphorylation of RyR1 during chronic activation of the sympathetic nervous system was shown to result in SR Ca\n2+\n leak as a cause of fatigue (Reiken et al., 2003) which was reversed by JTV-519 (Wehrens et al., 2005). In certain aspects, the invention provides, thorough characterization of the effects of strenuous exercise on RyR1 Ca\n2+\n leak, in vivo and ex vivo muscle performance and energetic metabolism, methods for the use of RyCal compounds to overcome muscle fatigue and to prevent muscle damage and/or fatigue during strenuous, and/or sustained exercise, and muscle damage and/or fatigue associated with defective skeletal muscle function, or any disease condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain aspects of the invention characterize mechanisms that destabilize the closed state of intracellular calcium (Ca\n2+\n) release channels which is a prerequisite for muscle relaxation to occur and prevents damage of myofibers from uncontrolled intracellular SR Ca\n2+\n leak. Chronic activation of the sympathetic nervous system during forced and sustained exercise caused RyR1 PKA hyperphosphorylation, calstabin1 depletion, and a defective channel closed state are consistent with SR Ca\n2+\n leak. Since stress and physical performance in combat are considered significantly more severe compared to the animal use protocols, it can be extrapolated that muscle fatigue and dystrophic degeneration from RyR1 Ca\n2+\n leak represents a more severe phenotype in warfighters. The focus is on two allosteric modulators of skeletal ryanodine receptors (RyR1s), one PKA as a key stress pathway and the other one a stabilizing protein subunit of the channel (calstabin1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain aspects of the invention address potential therapeutic and preventive measures in that a drug molecule rebinding calstabin1 may prevent skeletal muscle fatigue by normalizing the skeletal (RyR1) ryanodine receptor channel gating. Protein kinase A (PKA) hyperphosphorylation of RyR1 during chronic activation of the sympathetic nervous system was shown to result in SR Ca\n2+\n leak as a cause of fatigue (Wehrens X H, Lehnart S E, Reiken S, et al. Enhancing calstabin binding to ryanodine receptors improves cardiac and skeletal muscle function in heart failure. \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA\n. Jul. 5, 2005; 102(27):9607-9612; Ward C W, Reiken S, Marks A R, et al. Defects in ryanodine receptor calcium release in skeletal muscle from post-myocardial infarct rats. \nFaseb J\n. August 2003; 17(11):1517-1519). Certain aspects of the invention are directed to thorough characterization of the effects of strenuous exercise on RyR1 Ca\n2+\n leak, in vivo and ex vivo muscle performance and energetic metabolism, and the use of RyCal compounds to improve muscle fatigue times, to increase exercise capacity, and to prevent muscle damage during and/or after strenuous, sustained exercise.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLife quality and prognosis in heart failure patients is decreased due to skeletal muscle dysfunction (e.g., shortness of breath due to diaphragmatic weakness, and exercise intolerance due to limb skeletal muscle fatigue) (Harrington et al. 1997). Recent studies have identified dysregulation of intracellular Ca\n2+\n release from the SR as a pathogenic mechanism underlying skeletal muscle dysfunction in heart failure (Reiken S, Lacampagne A, Zhou H, et al. PKA phosphorylation activates the calcium release channel (ryanodine receptor) in skeletal muscle: defective regulation in heart failure. \nJ Cell Biol\n. Mar. 17, 2003; 160(6):919-928; Ward, 2003; Perreault C L, Gonzalez-Serratos H, Litwin S E, et al. Alterations in contractility and intracellular Ca2+ transients in isolated bundles of skeletal muscle fibers from rats with chronic heart failure. \nCirc Res\n. August 1993; 73(2):405-412). Heart failure in animals with myocardial infarcts causes significantly accelerated fatigue which is intrinsic to skeletal muscle as measured by the time for the tetanic force to fall below 50% of the maximal contraction (Reiken, 2003).\n\n\n \nSkeletal RyR1 are PKA Hyperphosphorylated and Depleted of Calstabin1\n\n\n \n \n \nPrevious studies have suggested that skeletal muscle RyR1 channels are PKA hyperphosphorylated and depleted of calstabin1 in a pacing-induced canine model of heart failure and a rat post-myocardial infarct model (Reiken et al., 2003; Ward et al., 2003). Furthermore, in a mouse model of post-myocardial infarction heart failure, RyR1 in soleus muscle is PKA-hyperphosphorylated. In certain embodiments, treatment with a RyCal compound, allows rebinding of calstabin1 to RyR1 despite intense chronic exercise.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBeta-adrenergic stimulation increases the gain of the EC coupling when enhanced muscle performance is required during exercise or stress (fight-or-flight response). Binding of catecholamines to β-adrenoceptors activates a G-protein coupled intracellular signaling cascade, which leads to increased intracellular cAMP concentrations and activation of protein kinase A (PKA). PKA is targeted to RyR1 via mAKAP forming a signaling complex with the skeletal Ca\n2+\n release channel (Reiken et al. 2003). RyR1 phosphorylation by PKA increases the channel open probability and SR Ca\n2+\n release (Reiken et al., 2003; Wehrens et al., 2004).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nData from skeletal myofibers have confirmed intracellular Ca\n2+\n leak from enhanced RyR1 activity after strenuous exercise consistent with an increased maximal rate of SR Ca\n2+\n release. PKA-hyperphosphorylation of RyR1 results in depletion of calstabin1 (FKBP12) from the channel complex due to a reduced binding affinity for calstabin1. Chronic depletion of calstabin1 from the RyR1 channel complex relieves an intrinsic inhibition of the channel and induces uncontrolled intracellular Ca\n2+\n leak and reduced fatigue resistance during a sustained hyperadrenergic state. Skeletal muscle fatigue is increased in heart failure patients and in animal models of heart failure (Reiken et al., 2003; Harrington et al., 1997; Perreault et al., 1993; Lunde et al. 2001; Lunde et al. 1998). In both patients and animals with heart failure the skeletal RyR1 channel isoform was found PKA hyperphosphorylated and depleted of the stabilizing calstabin1 subunits (Reiken et al., 2003; Wehrens et al., 2004). Increased fatigue and RyR1 hyperphosphorylation are associated with an increased Ca\n2+\n spark frequency and a decreased Ca\n2+\n spark amplitude in skeletal myofibers in heart failure animals consistent with intracellular Ca\n2+\n leak and decreased SR Ca\n2+\n concentrations (Reiken et al., 2003). Therefore, most likely increased muscle fatigue results from a chronic hyperadrenergic state causing an intracellular Ca\n2+\n leak via defective RyR1 channels (Reiken et al., 2003).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, it is important to conceptualize that the role of external Ca\n2+\n ions in mammalian skeletal muscle contraction is not completely understood. The LTCC and RyR isoforms in skeletal and cardiac muscles are different, with skeletal muscle expressing the LTCC α1\nS \nsubunit (Tanabe et al., 1988) and RyR1 (Marks et al., 1989), and cardiac muscle expressing the LTCC α1\nC \nsubunit (Mikami et al., 1989) and RyR2 (Nakai et al., 1990). RyR1 in skeletal muscle does not depend on Ca\n2+\n influx via LTCC α1\nS \nto activate SR Ca\n2+\n release as evidenced by continuous EC coupling in skeletal muscle cells when external Ca\n2+\n is removed or when Ca\n2+\n channel blockers are present (Armstrong et al., 1972; Dulhunty et al., 1988; Gonzalez-Serratos et al., 1982). Later experimental findings support RyR1 activation by physical coupling with LTCC α1\nS \n(Rios et al., 1987; Tanabe et al., 1990). RyR1 Ca\n2+\n leak likely increases the cellular energy demands by compensatory SR Ca\n2+\n ATPase uptake consuming more ATP which may contribute to earlier skeletal muscle fatigue. From direct oxygen measurements on the surface of contracting muscle preparations, it is estimated that total ATP consumption by SR Ca\n2+\n ATPases is significantly elevated in heart failure (Meyer et al., 1998) likely resulting from intracellular Ca\n2+\n leak. In agreement with decreased SR Ca\n2+\n concentrations due to RyR1 Ca\n2+\n leak, muscle-specific calstabin1 knockout increases LTCC Ca\n2+\n influx and reduces maximal voltage-gated intracellular Ca\n2+\n release (Tang et al., 2004).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecent studies have demonstrated defective function of RyR1 channels in skeletal muscle during heart failure, which were analogous to those found in RyR2 channels in failing myocardium: PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR1 and depletion of calstabin1 (Marx et al., 2000; Reiken et al., 2003; Wehrens et al., 2005). These findings suggest that defects in RyR1 function alter intracellular Ca\n2+\n handling, thereby contributing to early fatigue in skeletal muscles. Depletion of calstabin1 from the RyR1 macromolecular complex may also uncouple channels from one another and allow stochastic as opposed to coupled gating (Marx et al., 1998), thus providing an attractive hypothesis for explaining the altered Ca\n2+\n spark behaviour in skeletal muscle with reduced fatigue resistance (Ward et al., 2003). Thus, alterations in RyR1 could play a significant role in the skeletal muscle specific force decrements and reduced exercise-tolerance seen in models of increased muscle fatigue.\n\n\n \nMethods\n\n\n \n \n \nAerobic exercise can be defined as a form of physical exercise that increases the heart rate and enhances oxygen intake to improve performance. Examples of aerobic exercise are running, cycling, and swimming. In certain embodiments, mice were challenged by aerobic exercise (forced swimming) for 90 mins twice daily. The animals were accustomed to swimming in preliminary training sessions: day −3 twice 30 mins, day −2 twice 45 mins, day −1 twice 60 mins, \nday\n 0 and following twice 90 mins. Mice were then exercised for 1, 7, or 21 additional, consecutive days for 90 mins twice daily. Between swimming sessions separated by a 4 hour rest period the mice are kept warm and given food and water. An adjustable-current water pool was used to exercise mice by swimming. An acrylic pool (90 cm long×45 cm wide×45 cm deep) was filled with water to a depth of 25 cm. A current in the pool was generated with a pump. The current speed during the swimming session was at a constant speed of 1 l/min flow rate. The water temperature was maintained at 34° C. with an electric heater. Age- and weight-matched mice are used to exclude differences in buoyancy from body fat.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsing forced swimming as an efficient protocol to increase skeletal muscle aerobic capacity in mice (Evangelista et al., 2003), the composition and phosphorylation status of the skeletal RyR1 channel complex was investigated. Unexpectedly, after 3 weeks of 90 mins swimming twice daily, C57B16 wild-type mice showed significantly increased RyR2 phosphorylation by PKA while CaMKII phosphorylation was not changed. RyR1 protein expression was stable, however, RyR1 channels were depleted of the stabilizing subunit calstabin1 (FKBP12). RyR1 hyperphosphorylation and calstabin1 depletion are consistent with leaky RyR1 channels that cause intracellular Ca\n2+\n leak.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo investigate the influence of the duration of sustained exercise on the RyR1 Ca\n2+\n release channel defect, mice were exposed to swimming for 1, 7, or 21 days followed by immediate sacrifice. Longer exposure to sustained exercise shows a significant increase of RyR1 PKA hyperphosphorylation beginning at 7 days and saturating at 21 days.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMoreover, a mouse model of muscular dystrophy which is known to result in intracellular Ca\n2+\n leak and dystrophic muscle changes was investigated. Surprisingly, soleus muscles of the dystrophin-deficient mdx mouse show calstabin1 depletion in the absence of increased RyR1-Ser2844 phosphorylation. These results identify RyR1-Ser2844 PKA hyperphosphorylation as a specific event in exercise-induced RyR1 dysfunction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, the histological changes in the fast-twitch muscles of mice exposed to 3 weeks of exercise by swimming were characterized. Cross-sections of the mouse M. extensor digitorum longus (EDL) showed histological changes consistent with myofiber degeneration from intracellular Ca\n2+\n overload from defective RyR1 channel. Therefore sustained exercise for 90 mins twice daily triggers a distrophic phenotype in EDL muscles of normal C57B16 mice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUp-regulation of intracellular SR Ca\n2+\n release by cAMP-dependent signaling pathways augments the gain of excitation-contraction coupling during peak muscle performance. (Reiken, 2003) Therefore transient PKA phosphorylation of skeletal RyR1 Ca\n2+\n release channels represents a key mechanism of the fight-or-flight response. Studies have established that dysregulation of RyR1 Ca\n2+\n release channels occurs during strenuous fatiguing exercise. Mice which underwent rigorous exercise for 3 weeks showed significantly increased levels of RyR1 PKA phosphorylation, increased RyR1 channel activity, and dystrophic histological changes. Chronic RyR1 hyperphosphorylation results in depletion of the stabilizing calstabin1, functional channel defects, suggesting intracellular Ca\n2+\n leak. At the level of the muscle cell, this model was recently confirmed by a report that increased Ca\n2+\n spark frequency after fatiguing exercise in mouse skeletal muscle (Wang et al., 2005). Moreover, it was shown that intracellular Ca\n2+\n leak from chronic exercise acts as dystrophic signal in mammalian skeletal muscle (Wang, 2005). This confirms previous observations in cardiac muscle, where hormonal and structural changes contribute to intracellular Ca\n2+\n leak causing defective excitation-contraction coupling (Gomez, 1997). From these studies (Wehrens et al., 2005; Reiken et al., 2003) and the Ca\n2+\n spark data in fatiguing muscle (Wang et al., 2005) it is likely that intracellular Ca\n2+\n leak represents a key pathology that accelerates muscle fatigue and causes dystrophic remodeling of muscles. Accordingly, extended investigation of fatigue models at the in vivo, isolated muscle, muscle cell, mitochondria, and single RyR1 channel level will characterize detrimental effects during peak performance on muscle fatigue and dystrophic remodeling.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n1,4-benzothiazepine derivatives prevent muscle dysfunction from intracellular Ca\n2+\n leak under conditions of sustained sympathetic nervous system activation occurring from heart failure (Wehrens et al., 2005). In certain aspects, the invention provides RyCal compounds and their use to enhance skeletal muscle performance and to reduce muscle dysfunction during sustained stress as occurs under combat conditions. Defects in the RyR1 Ca\n2+\n release channel due to dysregulation by PKA allow rationalizing of a therapeutic concept: intracellular SR Ca\n2+\n leak and muscle dysfunction can be prevented by a drug that increases binding of the stabilizing calstabin1 subunit to the RyR1 channel complex and thereby inhibits SR Ca\n2+\n leak and dystrophic muscle remodeling from sustained stress or exercise. Applying a drug to prevent SR Ca\n2+\n leak can therefore enhance a variety of important physiologic skills which are prone to stress-induced dysfunction. In certain aspects, the invention provides that enhanced binding of calstabin1 to RyR1 by RyCal compounds prevents muscle fatigue. Using animal models of physiologic (swimming and running on a treadmill) and/or pharmacologic activation β-adrenergic receptor agonists) of the sympathetic nervous system combined with different degrees of exercise exposure, it can be tested whether RyCal compounds improve skeletal muscle function and prevent dystrophic muscle degeneration. This may lead to a pharmacologic approach based on allosteric modulation of RyR1 that can result in improved human performance during sustained stress and prevent adverse tissue damage thereby shortening recovery times. In other aspects, the invention provides pharmacologic approaches based on allosteric modulation of RyR1 that can result in improved human performance during sustained stress and prevent adverse tissue damage and shorten recovery times.\n\n\n \n \nRyR1 PKA phosphorylation: quantification of skeletal RyR1 channel phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA) following sustained exercise for 2 days, 1 week, and 3 weeks using two independent techniques (RyR1 PKA phospho-epitope detection by specific antibody; incorporation of radiolabeled phosphate by backphosphorylation essay).\n\n\nRyR1 CaMKII phosphorylation: quantification of skeletal RyR1 channel phosphorylation by Ca\n2+\n-calmodulin protein kinase II (CaMKII) following sustained exercise for 2 days, 1 week, and 3 weeks using RyR1 CaMKII phospho-epitope detection by specific antibody essay developed in our laboratory. This will allow characterizing specific defects resulting from chronic PKA phosphorylation and/or secondary activation of CaMKII signaling by intracellular Ca\n2+\n leak mechanisms.\n\n\nCalstabin1 depletion in the RyR1 complex: quantification of depletion of the channel stabilizing subunit calstabin1 (FKBP12) from the RyR1 channel complex by immunoprecipitation techniques following sustained exercise for 2 days, 1 week, and 3 weeks. Calstabin1 depletion occurs from Ser2844 phosphorylation by PKA.\n\n\nRyR1 functional defects—in vivo development of “leaky” RyR1 channels: electrophysiologic characterization of RyR1 single-channel activity and open probability following sustained exercise for 2 days, 1 week, and 3 weeks. This allows for a comprehensive and sensitive assessment of SR Ca\n2+\n release channel defects and leak mechanisms that are known to contribute to muscle fatigue. Moreover, these data will allow developing a rationale for preventive treatment of RyR1 Ca\n2+\n leak using a small lead RyCal compounds.\n\n\nImprovement of fatigue from sustained exercise: quantification of in vivo fatigue using two independent exercise performance tests: swimming and running on a treadmill. The treadmill test will be combined with electrocardiogram telemetry in a subgroup of animals to allow for objective correlation of increased heart rates during exercise with fatigue symptoms. Moreover, plasma and muscle catecholamine levels will be determined to verify sustained activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Three weeks of maximal fatiguing swimming exercise induces progressive RyR1 dysfunction and dystrophic skeletal muscle changes during a low flow rate of 1 l/min (baseline condition which prevents mice from floating passively). To objectively quantify fatigue times during swimming exercise, video tracking system can be used (San Diego Instruments Incorporated) which automatically tracks and digitizes spatio-temporal movements of 8 mice. Improvement of fatigue will be assessed by time to fatigue (defined as significant increase in 2D distance or activity over time).\n\n\nImprovement of maximal exercise capacity: To determine maximal endurance exercise capacity (i.e., time to exhaustion), the maximum swim times are measured at a flow rate of 7 l/min in repeated measurements three times a week. To reduce the inherent variation in swimming capacity, mice whose mean maximum swim times vary by more than 40% than the average swim time will be excluded. A mouse is qualified as fatigued when it fails to rise to the water surface to breathe and will be rescued at this point. To verify the systemic exhaustion after swimming, plasma lactate and pH will be determined in heparinized arterial blood samples. To objectively quantify fatigue times during forced swimming exercise, we will use a video tracking system (San Diego Instruments Incorporated) which automatically tracks and digitizes spatio-temporal movements of 8 mice in a 2D plane.\n\n\nIsolated skeletal muscle function: ex vivo characterization of intrinsic muscle resistance to fatigue stimulation or single-twitch contraction protocols following sustained exercise with placebo or a RyCal compound treatment for 2 days, 1 week, and 3 weeks. Two different forms of isolated skeletal muscles will be tested: extensor digitorum longus for a fast-twitch muscle and soleus muscle for a slow-twitch muscle. This test can determine the effect of RyCal compounds on skeletal muscle under fatiguing exercise, or disease conditions. Skeletal muscle contraction and relaxation is critically dependent on intracellular Ca\n2+\n metabolism and RyR1 function and therefore a highly sensitive test.\n\n\nIntracellular Ca\n2+\n leak and SR Ca\n2+\n content in isolated skeletal myofibers: assessment of isolated skeletal muscle myofibers loaded with fluo-4 Ca\n2+\n indicators for resting SR Ca\n2+\n leak using intracellular Ca\n2+\n sparks. SR Ca\n2+\n content will be assessed by caffeine pulse protocols which result in complete release of the free SR Ca\n2+\n pool. Previous studies have documented calcium leak resulting from a chronic hyperadrenergic state in myofibers of rats with heart failure (Reiken 2003; Ward 2003; Gomez 2001; Cheng 1996).\n\n\nChanges in mitochondrial integrity from SR Ca\n2+\n leak: mitochondria in mouse skeletal muscle take up Ca\n2+\n which under conditions of strong physiologic muscle stimulation result in continuously elevated mitochondrial Ca\n2+\n levels which stimulates mitochondrial metabolism (Rudolf et al., 2004). However, myotubes from dystrophic mdx mice showed significantly elevated Ca\n2+\n uptake. (Robert V, Massimino M L, Tosello V, et al. Alteration in calcium handling at the subcellular level in mdx myotubes. \nJ Biol Chem\n. Feb. 16, 2001; 276(7):4647-4651.) Cytosolic Ca\n2+\n overload is a highly toxic event that represents a common final pathway of cell death. Mitochondria are key players in cell death, and the spatial proximity of RyR1 Ca\n2+\n release and mitochondrial Ca\n2+\n uptake suggest, that SR Ca\n2+\n leak during strenuous exercise can cause mitochondrial Ca\n2+\n overload which impacts on mitochondrial structure and function and may trigger cell death. Caspase-12 is localized in the SR, is regulated by Ca\n2+\n, and participates in the SR stress-induced apoptosis pathway (Yoneda et al., 2001). In certain aspects the invention characterizes the effects of fatiguing exercise on mitochondrial membrane potential by rhodamine 123 uptake, mitochondrial swelling indicating mitochondrial permeability transition by 520 nm spectrophotometry and light scatter, the amount of intra-mitochondrial Ca\n2+\n by organelle incubation with \n45\nCa\n2+\n followed by radioactivity quantification with a liquid scintillation counter, measurement of cytochrome c from release mitochondria coactivating caspases, and staining of muscle preparations for TUNEL-positive cell nuclei. The in vivo effects of RyCal compounds treatment on mitochondrial integrity and function will be assessed.\n\n\nActivation of intracellular proteases fragments RyR1: A direct link exists between the cytosolic Ca\n2+\n elevations and the proteolysis of intracellular targets through the activation of Ca\n2+\n-dependent proteases, including calpains and caspases. Calpain activation is part of the apoptosis machinery. Increased activation of the ubiquitous calpains has been found in the mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), but null mutations of muscle specific calpain causes limb girdle muscular dystrophy 2A (LGMD2A) (Tidball et al., 2000). These findings indicate that dysregulation of calpain activity contributes to progression of muscle disease by disrupting normal regulatory mechanisms and by a generalized, nonspecific increase of proteolytic capacity. RyR1 and other components of the Ca\n2+\n cycling machinery are targets of and cleaved by caspases and calpains (Johnson et al., 2004; Shevchenko at al., 1998). We will therefore investigate if Ca\n2+\n dependent protease and/or caspase activation result in RyR1 cleavage following strenuous exercise and if JTV-519 by inhibiting SR Ca\n2+\n leak can prevent activation of unspecific proteolysis.\n\n\nHistologic changes of skeletal muscle from strenuous, fatiguing exercise: Dystrophic changes from sustained exercise may result in muscle fiber necrosis and progressive muscle wasting and weakness. Histological analysis of skeletal muscles will include analysis for eosinophilic hypercontracted muscle fibers, necrotic fibers, ongoing muscle regeneration, and the proliferation of fibroblasts within muscle tissue since the replacement of muscle tissue by connective tissue (fibrosis) is a major cause of permanent muscle weakness. Accordingly, RyCal compounds can be tested for inhibition of these changes. Conventional histology techniques will allow to assess variability in fiber size, split fibers, and centralized nuclei.\n\n\nFiber typing by histochemistry in skeletal muscles: Historically, the most widely used classification of fiber types is based on the mATPase (myofibrillar adenosine triphosphatase) activity by histochemistry which distinguishes between type I (low activity) and type II (high activity) fibers (Brooke et al., 1970). By characterizing the pH lability of the mATPase, type II fibers were further subdivided into IIA and IIB fibers. Additional fiber type characterization with physiologic, histochemical, and ultrastructural methods has revealed: type I, intermediate slow-twitch oxidative; type HA, red fast-twitch oxidative-glycolytic; and type IIB, white fast-twitch glycolytic fibers. Quantitative histochemistry can be used to determine mATPase, succinate dehydrogenase, and α-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase and cross-sectional areas in MHC-based fiber type changes in oxidative and glycolytic capacities resulting from sustained exercise and/or RyCal compound treatment. To determine myofiber ATPase activity, a protocol using 10 μm thick frozen sections which are preincubated for 5 mins under acidic or 12 mins under alkaline conditions can be used. Succinate dehydrogenase staining will allow characterizing activity and distinction between muscle fibers. Changes in oxidative muscle fiber types and improvement after treatment for myotonia have been reported in mice previously (Reininghaus et al., 1988).\n\n\nFiber typing by immunocytochemistry in skeletal muscles: To quantitate changes in myonuclear number and location and to distinguish from nuclei of interstitial cells, morphometry by fluorescence microscopy using stains for nuclei (DAPI) and basement membrane (anti-laminin) will be applied. This technique will be particularly important to precisely determine cross-sectional area and number of nuclei in muscle fibers. Moreover, the technique allows for combined immunocytochemistry with the following affinity-purified antibodies: C-terminal RyR2-5029, phospho-epitope-specific RyR1-p2844 (Wehrens et al., 2004), calstabin1 (FKBP12) (Jayaraman et al., 1992), isoform-specific myosin heavy chain (MHC) antibodies (Rivero et al. 1999), and α-actinin (Ruehr et al., 2003) using a previously established protocol with 10 μm thick cryostat sections of EDL or soleus muscles (Moschella et al., 1995). This approach will allow us to classify myofibers and phenotypic changes according to MHC content, metabolic activity, fiber size, RyR1 PKA phosphorylation, and calstabin1 binding occurring from sustained exercise and/or RyCal compound treatment. Further, the fiber type and immunocytochemistry data will be correlated to isolated skeletal muscle function, general histologic data, histochemistry, RyR1 single-channel function, and mitochondria data. Using immunohistochemical staining, fiber type-specific improvement of calstabin1 binding to RyR1 and RyR1 PKA phosphorylation can be determined in the presence or absence, or after RyCal compound treatment in α-actinin positive compartments (Z-disk), and for increased calpain expression in the myofibrillar area (Z disks; compartment containing RyR1 channels) of muscle fibers.\n\n\nSkeletal muscle oxidative capacity: Muscle oxidative activity correlates with skeletal muscle adoption to aerobic exercise. As a general test, fast- and slow-twitch skeletal muscle oxidative enzyme activity will be assessed by spectrophotometric assessment of the citric acid cycle and citrate synthase activity in muscle homogenates. Activity as determined as the complex from coenzyme A and oxaloacetate is expected to be increased as reported by a group using a similar protocol (Evangelista et al., 2003). This test will be used to confirm changes in oxidative capacity seen by histochemistry.\n\n\nImprovement of creatine kinase (CK) plasma levels: Creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) plasma concentrations (Santos et al., 2004; Thompson et al., 2004), can be determined as indicators or muscle damage and inflammation after exhaustive exercise and to determine effect due to RyCal compound treatment.\n\n\nRyR1 composition and function in white blood cells: RyR1 in immune cells functions as a Ca\n2+\n release channel during B- or T-cell receptor-stimulated activation (Sei et al., 2002; Kraev et al., 2003). For functional analysis, peripheral white blood cells are isolated from mouse blood samples by centrifugation. Leukocytes (10\n6\n/ml) are loaded with 1 μm acetoxy-methyl ester of fluo-3 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg.) by incubation for 30 mins at 25° C. and caffeine sensitivity of intracellular Ca\n2+\n release is tested. Composition and PKA phosphorylation of the RyR1 channel complex will be characterized. Investigating RyR1 in white blood cells will allow monitoring temporal changes during sustained exercise and RyCal compound treatment in vivo.\n\n\n\n \nGenetically Modified Mice\n\n\n \n \n \nThe RyR1 macromolecular signaling complex plays a key role in modulating activation of the channel and excitation-contraction coupling by the sympathetic nervous system. In the RyR1 complex mAKAP targets PKA and the phosphodiesterase PDE4D3 to the channel and the phosphatase PP1 is targeted to the channel by the targeting protein spinophilin. This signaling module controls PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 at Ser2843 as part of the “fight-or-flight” stress response. During normal exercise 2-3 of the four Ser2843 PKA phosphorylation sites in each tetrameric RyR1 channel are transiently PKA phosphorylated resulting in increased activity of the RyR1 channel.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nActivation of the RyR1 due to PKA phosphorylation occurs because PKA phosphorylation decreases the binding affinity of the stabilizing protein calstabin1 (FKBP12) for the channel resulting in increased sensitivity of the channel to Ca\n2+\n-dependent activation. PDE4D3 in the RyR1 macromolecular signaling complex plays a protective role against PKA hyperphosphorylation and forms a negative feedback loop during PKA activation. The phosphodiesterases in the RyR1 complex by rapidly degrading local cAMP and thereby terminating channel activation by PKA. Mice that are deficient in PDE4D3 or calstabin1 in the RyR1 complex will be tested for accelerated muscle fatigue. Thus, both calstabin1 and PDE4D3 in the RyR2 complex can be thought of as being “protective” against muscle dysfunction during excessive exercise or stress. Thus additional components of the RyR1 macromolecular complex are protective against fatigue as these molecules could potentially be novel therapeutic targets and/or identify adverse pharmaceutical agents for preventing fatigue during intense stress in warfighters.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe muscle-specific genetic mouse model HSA\nLR \nof myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) has a DM-like phenotype. Importantly, the HSA\nLR \nmyotonic phenotype includes variable degrees of histopathological signs of muscle degeneration and repair, which correspond to the expression of more toxic, long or less, toxic short repeat variants. In addition to wild-type mice, susceptibility to muscle fatigue will be investigated using swimming and treadmill running protocols. In a subgroup of mice, implantable telemetry devices will be implanted two weeks before the mice are subjected to an exercise-stress protocol as described. Upon completion of the experiment, mice will be sacrificed and muscles will be flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen or further processed for histological assays. Specific muscle types are carefully dissected under stereoscope vision and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen or examined by histology and immunohistochemistry. In all tissue samples, RyR1 PKA phosphorylation, levels of the components of the RyR2 macromolecular complex including calstabin1, PKA, RII, mAKAP, PP1, spinophilin, PDE4D3, CaMKII, and single channel properties will be examined. The following properties are determined: Ca\n2+\n sensitivity of activation and inhibition, Mg\n2+\n inhibition, and changes from in vivo RyCal treatment. At conclusion of each single channel experiment ryanodine will be applied to the channel to confirm RyR identity. The HSA\nLR \nmouse will allow to test beneficial effects of RyCal compounds in an extreme model of genetic muscle fatigue and dystrophy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSusceptibility to muscle fatigue can be investigated using swimming and treadmill running protocols. Implantable telemetry devices can be implanted two weeks before the mice are subjected to an exercise-stress protocol. Upon completion of the experiment, mice are sacrificed and muscles are flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Upon completion of each experiment, muscles can be dissected and will also be examined by histology and Western blotting. In all tissue samples, RyR1 PKA phosphorylation, levels of the components of the RyR2 macromolecular complex including calstabin1, PKA, RII, mAKAP, PP1, spinophilin, PDE4D3, CaMKII, and single channel properties can be examined. The following properties can be determined: Ca\n2+\n sensitivity of activation and inhibition, Mg\n2+\n inhibition, response to PKA phosphorylation. At conclusion of each single channel experiment ryanodine is applied to the channel to confirm RyR identity.\n\n\n \nRyCal Compounds Prevent Muscle Fatigue and Muscle Degeneration\n\n\n \n \n \nIn certain aspects, the invention provides that RyCal compounds can restore normal function to hyperphosphorylated RyR1. Furthermore, use of PDE4D knockout and FKBP12 haploinsufficient mice allows determination whether RyCal compound prevent muscle fatigue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe foregoing discussion established two animal models (mouse and rat) of muscle dysfunction and fatiguing, which result from sustained forms of exercise. The models can provide important clues if chronic activation of the sympathetic nervous system resulting from sustained exercise and stress cause a critical defect in the RyR1 Ca\n2+\n release channel. Previous experiments in a heart failure model that results in chronic sympathetic hyperactivity have established a critical defect in RyR1 contributing to accelerated muscle fatigue. RyCal compounds have beneficial effects to inhibit muscle fatigue during sustained exercise capacity, and isolated slow-and fast-twitch skeletal muscle function in the investigated fatigue models. Catecholamine-induced muscle fatigue has been established in rat and mouse hearts failure models earlier and therefore we will be able to apply similar techniques to test for muscle fatigue following sustained animal exercise protocols.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMaintenance of muscle performance during sustained activation of the sympathetic nervous system, for example but not limited to combat, requires a maximal rate of intracellular SR Ca\n2+\n cycling. Chronic maximal stress results in permanent activation of the sympathetic nervous system potentially causing RyR1 hyperphosphorylation and intracellular Ca\n2+\n leak. In skeletal muscles, intracellular Ca\n2+\n leak gradually causes a myopathy characterized by significantly reduced duration and maximal power of peak performance as well as accelerated fatigue by additional ATP consumption of SR Ca\n2+\n ATPase pumps that compensate for uncontrolled SR Ca\n2+\n leak. SR Ca\n2+\n leak is unique since it is a direct cause of muscle fatigue intrinsic to myofibers which is not reversible in the acute setting. A drug like any RyCal compound which fixes the SR Ca\n2+\n leak by binding calstabin1 to the channel and stabilizing the closed state even during stress therefore helps to prevent accelerated fatigue development and promotes longer performance despite sustained stress (Wehrens, 2005). The pharmacotherapy is unique since it targets a central fatigue mechanism and potentially prevents toxic effects of intracellular Ca\n2+\n leak. Moreover the molecular mechanism of this pharmocotherapy is unique, since it treats a specific defect contributing to muscle fatigue and since the mechanism of RyCal action is stabilization of normal RyR1 channel closure by increasing the calstabin1 binding affinity, which is distinct from historical approaches that block ion channel function.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore recently, SR Ca\n2+\n leak was documented in myofibers following intense exercise and in a model of muscular dystrophy, (Wang et al., 2005), possibly due to defective skeletal ryanodine receptors (RyR1 s). Also, chronic activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) in the context of heart failure promotes intrinsic skeletal muscle (SM) fatigue due to depletion of the phosphodiesterease PDE4D3 from the RyR1 complex, RyR1 PKA hyperphosphorylation at \nSerine\n 2844, calstabin1 depletion from the RyR1 complex, and a gain-of-function channel defect (Reiken et al., 2003). RyR1 dysfunction in the skeletal muscle leads to altered local subcellular Ca\n2+\n release events and impaired global calcium transients (Ward et al., 2003). In the context of chronic exercise, there is evidence indicating that changes in the RyR1 macromolecular complex, namely depletion of PDE4D3 from the RyR1 complex, RyR1 PKA hyperphosphorylation at \nSerine\n 2844, and calstabin1 depletion from the RyR1 complex are related in a time-dependent and activity-dependent manner with repeated intense exercise in a mouse model. These biochemical changes in the RyR1 macromolecular complex regulation and function are stable following prolonged exercise and recover slowly over days to weeks. Thus RyR1 Ca\n2+\n leak limits peak muscle performance and mediates muscle damage during prolonged, stressful exercise.\n\n\n \nMolecular Mechanisms of Muscle Fatigue\n\n\n \n \n \nThe hypotheses that muscle fatigue is due to lactic acid accumulation in the cytoplasm and potassium ion accumulation in T-tubules have largely been set aside and attention has shifted to the study of metabolic and mitochondrial regulation and signaling pathways during chronic exercise (Lin, Wu et al. 2002; Wu, Kanatous et al. 2002; Wang, Zhang et al. 2004). These alternative explanations, while important, are unlikely to directly address the underlying abnormalities in ECC observed in fatigued muscle (Berchtold, Brinkmeier et al. 2000). Described herein is the regulation of the skeletal calcium release channel, RyR1, during chronic or high intensity exercise. The remodeling of the RyR1 macromolecular complex during chronic exercise, consisting of PKA hyperphosphorylation at Ser2844, PDE4D3 depletion, and calstabin1 depletion, likely plays a role in determining muscle fatigue during chronic exercise.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExercise promotes numerous positive effects on an organism, from improvement in cardiovascular performance to increased glucose uptake and normalization of fuel metabolism (Goodyear and Kahn 1998; Pollock, Franklin et al. 2000). In heart failure, light exercise training has been shown to improve skeletal muscle strength and reduce fatigue, perhaps through adaptation to more aerobic muscle properties (Minotti, Johnson et al. 1990; Lunde, Sjaastad et al. 2001; Meyer 2006). On the other hand, high intensity exercise, such as that performed by a marathon runner or a long distance cyclist results in significant muscle damage and can impair task performance for days or weeks after a single event (O'Reilly, Warhol et al. 1987; Balnave and Thompson 1993; Komulainen and Vihko 1994).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDescribed herein is also a mouse model of intense physiological exercise to examine the changes in RyR1 function and ECC experienced by elite athletes, soldiers, or others under intense stressful activity. By combining daily swimming with level treadmill running assays, a physiological exercise regimen was constructed that did not exclusively involve isometric or eccentric contraction of the hind limb. While this resulted in less dramatic evidence of exercise-induced muscle damage than pure eccentric contractions, the data presented are more readily generalized.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBiochemical changes were identified in the RyR1 macromolecular complex consistent with leaky calcium release channels. Single channel bilayer data confirmed a leaky-phenotype of the RyR1 channels from chronically exercised hind limb muscle, with elevated open probabilities in the chronically exercised group at resting calcium levels compared to sedentary controls. In two mouse genetic models replicating aspects of the biochemical changes in the RyR1 complex, namely muscle-specific deficiency of calstabin1 (cal1−/−) and deficiency of PDE4D3 (PDE4D−/−), exercise defects were identified. The role of calstabin1 depletion was assessed in another way by pharmacologically rebinding the stabilizing subunit to RyR1 with the Ca\n2+\n channel stabilizer S107. Calstabin1 rebinding to RyR1, induced by S107 resulted in improved exercise capacity, as measured by treadmill failure times, over the same 21 day time course that depleted calstabin1 in the vehicle treated mice. The lack of an effect of S107 on cal1−/− mice provides evidence that the molecular mechanism of S107 is indeed through calstabin1 rebinding to RyR1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn vitro fatigue protocols on intact isolated muscles suffer from the limitation that force declines are largely limited by hypoxia (Zhang, Bruton et al. 2006). Therefore, single FDB muscle fibers were isolated from sedentary and chronically exercised mice with and without S107 for assessment of the decline in tetanic Ca\n2+\n during fatigue. Exercised fibers with calstabin rebound were relatively protected against fatigue (\nFIG. 48\n). The effect of S107 did not appear to be due to a shift in the fiber kinetics to slower calcium cycling.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nS107 corrected the leak in RyR1 from chronically exercised mice as measured in a lipid bilayer at low resting Ca\n2+\n levels. Ca\n2+\n leak resulting from the overactive skeletal ryanodine receptors was not directly visualized in isolated muscle fibers, as calcium sparks were infrequent under all conditions tested, which is consistent with most reports that sparks in skeletal muscle are rare except under certain highly pathological conditions such as hypoosmotic shock or muscular dystrophy (Isaeva, Shkryl et al. 2005; Rios 2005; Wang, Weisleder et al. 2005).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNumerous hypotheses present themselves for how alterations in RyR1 Ca\n2+\n leak could result in muscle damage. These data do not identify one muscle damage pathway solely responsible for the physiological effects seen, however, they implicate a role for calpain activation during chronic, and/or high intensity exercise. Several groups have demonstrated that calpain activation is a major mechanism for exercise-induced muscle damage (Belcastro 1993; Spencer and Mellgren 2002). As described herein, calpain activation in isolated EDL muscle was elevated following chronic exercise, but reduced by treatment with S107, suggesting that correction of the leaky RyR1 may protect against calpain activation (\nFIG. 50\n). With a potential contribution of other Ca\n2+\n-dependent pathways such as caspases, calmodulin, or calmodulin-dependent kinases to the damage induced by leaky ryanodine receptors, the present data suggest a mechanism by which local elevation of cytosolic Ca\n2+\n could lead to damage. The hypothesis that ryanodine receptor-induced leak can cause muscle damage was further supported by evidence of reduced muscle damage, as measured by serum creatine kinase, in the S107 treated mice (\nFIG. 50\n). The data described herein shows that changes in the RyR1 macromolecular complex produces a leaky phenotype during chronic, high intensity exercise which impairs exercise performance.\n\n\n \nNeuropathies\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the present invention is directed to compositions and methods for the treatment and prevention of neuropathies. The term “neuropathy” as used herein refers to conditions characterized by damage to the nerves, including, but not limited to, damage caused by infections, inflammatory processes, exposure to toxins, treatment with drugs, nutritional deficiency, trauma, pressure on a nerve, neuronal death, neuronal degeneration, and heritable conditions. Although the term “neuropathy” is most frequently used to refer to conditions characterized damage to the peripheral nerves, i.e. “peripheral neuropathies”, as used herein, the term “neuropathy” includes both peripheral neuropathies and neuropathies affecting nerves of the central nervous system, i.e. “central neuropathies.”\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are various sub-classifications of neuropathies. For example, neuropathies may be classified as either peripheral or central, as either acute or chronic, or as either demyelinating or axonal. Neuropathies may also be classified according to the number of nerves that they affect. A neuropathy may involve damage to only a single nerve or nerve group (referred to as mononeuropathies) or may affect multiple nerves (polyneuropathies).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeripheral neuropathies may be caused by hereditable disorders, systemic or metabolic disorders, dietary deficiencies, exposure to toxic substances, treatment with drugs, infection, inflammatory response, autoimmune diseases, and multiple other factors. Also, many peripheral neuropathies are of unknown etiology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of hereditable peripheral neuropathies include, but are not limited to, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) and Friedreich's ataxia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of peripheral neuropathies caused by systemic or metabolic disorders include, but are not limited to diabetic neuropathy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of peripheral neuropathies caused by dietary deficiencies include, but are not limited to neuropathy caused by vitamin B-12 deficiency, and neuropathy caused by thiamine deficiency.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of peripheral neuropathies caused by exposure to toxic substances include, but are not limited to neuropathy caused by excessive alcohol use (“alcoholic neuropathy”), neuropathy caused by memia (such as in kidney failure patients), neuropathy caused by arsenic, neuropathy caused by nitrous oxide, neuropathy caused by industrial agents especially solvents, neuropathy caused by heavy metal exposure (such as lead, arsenic, mercury, and the like).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of peripheral neuropathies caused by infectious agents and/or inflammatory or autoimmune processes include, but are not limited to, neuropathies caused by GullainBarre syndrome, polyarteritis nodosa, sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, sjogren syndrome, HIV infection, syphhilis infection, herpes infection, hepatitis infection, colorado tick fever infection, diptheria infection, leprosy, Lyme disease, and amyloidosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of peripheral neuropathies caused by drugs include, but are not limited to neuropathy caused by amiodarone, hydralazine, perhexyline, chemotherapeutic drugs, vincristine, cisplatin, metronidazole (Flagyl), nitrofurantoin, thalidomide, INH (isoniazid), Dapsone, anticonvulsants, Phenyloin, Disulfuram, zidovudine, retrovir, AZT, didanosine (Videx), stavudine (Zerit), zalcitabine (Hivid), ritonavir (Norvir), amprenavir (Agenerase), lovastatin (Mevacor), indapamid (Lozol), gemfibrozil (Lopid).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther miscellaneous causes or peripheral neuropathy include, but are not limited to ischemia, prolonged exposure to cold temperature, prolonged pressure on, or compression of a nerve, and trauma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeripheral neuropathies are characterized by damage to the either the sensory, motor, or autonomic peripheral nerves. The symptoms and effects of peripheral neuropathies depend on the types of nerves affected. Damage to such nerves can result in one or more of pain (neuropathic pain), loss of sensation, and loss of muscular control, abnormal blood pressure, abnormal heart function, digestion problems, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDamage to sensory fibers may result in changes in sensation, burning sensations, nerve pain (neuralgia, neuropathic pain), tingling, numbness, inability to determine joint position, and incoordination. Damage to the motor fibers may affect muscle control and can cause weakness, cramps, loss of muscle bulk, and loss of dexterity, paralysis, muscle atrophy, Muscle twitching (fasciculation), difficulty breathing or swallowing, falling. The autonomic nerves control involuntary and semi-voluntary functions, such as control of the internal organs, control of breathing, and blood pressure. Damage to autonomic nerves may cause, inability to regulate blood pressure, respiratory problems, problems of the digestive system (including nausea, vomiting, abdominal bloating, early satiety, diarrhea, constipation, unintentional weight loss), problems with the genitourinary system, (such as urinary incontinence, other bladder-function disorders, and male impotence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of specific nerves that may be affected in peripheral neuropathies include, but are not limited to, the axillary nerve, the brachial plexus, the peroneal nerve, the distal median nerve, the facial nerves palsy, the femoral nerves, the radial nerves, the sciatic nerve, the tibial nerves, and the ulnar nerves.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of central neuropathies include, but are not limited to, vestibular neuropathies, optic neuropathies, optic nerve neuropathies, and retinal neuropathies. Other types of central neuropathy are known to those of skill in the art, and are encompassed by the present invention.\n\n\n \nSeizures\n\n\n \n \n \nThe term “seizure” as used herein includes epileptic seizures and non-epileptic seizure. Epileptic seizures result from, temporary abnormal electrical activity in the brain. They can manifest as an alterations tonic or chronic movements, convulsions, sudden and involuntary contraction of a group of muscles, involuntary changes in body movement or function, numbness, alterations in mental state, alterations in sensation, alterations in awareness, changes in behavior, temporary loss of memory, visual disturbances, and various other symptoms. Symptoms experienced by a person during a seizure depend on where in the brain the disturbance in electrical activity occurs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are various different types of seizures, all of which are within the scope of the present invention. For example, seizures may be epileptic or non-epileptic, as described below. Seizures may also be classified according to whether the source of the seizure within the brain is localized (partial or focal onset seizures) or distributed (generalized seizures).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPartial seizures are further divided on the extent to which consciousness is affected. If consciousness is unaffected the seizure is referred to as a simple partial seizure. If consciousness is affected, the seizure is referred to as a complex partial seizure. A partial seizure may also spread within the brain—a process known as secondary generalization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGeneralized seizures are divided according to the effect on the body but all involve loss of consciousness. These include absence, myoclonic, clonic, tonic, tonic-clonic, and atonic seizures. In the past, seizures have also been classified as “petit mal”, “grand mal”, “Jacksonian”, “psychomotor”, and “temporal-lobe” seizures.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEpilepsy is a chronic neurological condition characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures. These seizures involve abnormal, rhythmic discharges of cortical neurons. Epilepsy may be symptomatic or idiopathic. Symptomatic epilepsies are caused by structural or metabolic abnormality in the brain, which may be the result of factors such as genetic disorders (such as tuberous sclerosis or \nring chromosome\n 20 syndrome), stroke, head injury, bacterial or viral encephalitis, alcohol use. There are several syndromes that associated with epilepsy, including, but not limited to, infantile spasms (West syndrome), benign childhood epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes (or benign rolandic epilepsy), benign childhood epilepsy with occipital paroxysms, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), temporal lobe epilepsy, frontal lobe epilepsy, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, occipital lobe epilepsy, and fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Idiopathic seizures are those for which no specific cause has been identified.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain triggers or environmental factors or can lead to an increased likelihood of seizures in subjects with epilepsy. Examples of such triggers include, but are not limited to, sleep, the transition between sleep and wakefulness, tiredness, illness, constipation, menstruation, stress, and alcohol consumption. It should also be noted that, even in epileptic subjects, seizures may be triggered by some of the same specific events that cause “provoked” seizures in non-epileptic subjects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-epileptic seizures appear outwardly similar to epileptic seizures but do not involve abnormal, rhythmic discharges of cortical neurons. Non-epileptic seizures are typically provoked by either physiological or psychological conditions. Seizures caused by psychological conditions are referred to as “psychogenic” non-epileptic seizures.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCauses of non-epileptic or “provoked” seizures include, but are not limited to, head injury, intoxication with drugs, drug toxicity (for example aminophylline or local anaesthetic toxicity, drugs that lower the seizure threshold (such as tricyclic antidepressants), infection (such as encephalitis or meningitis), fever leading to febrile convulsions, metabolic disturbances such as hypoglycaemia or hypoxia, withdrawal from drugs (such as anticonvulsants, sedatives, alcohol, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines), brain tumors, other brain lesions, eclampsia during pregnancy, photosensitivity, flashing or flickering lights and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). It should be noted that the above stimuli may also trigger epileptic seizures.\n\n\n \nCognitive Disorders\n\n\n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the present invention is directed to the treatment and prevention of cognitive disorders, and also to methods and compositions for improvement of cognitive function more generally, even in the absence of a specific cognitive disorder. For example, improvement of cognitive function to combat the normal cognitive decline associated with aging, or to enhance cognitive function for other reasons, is encompassed by the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “cognitive function” and “cognitive process” as used herein, include the mental processes of attention, learning and memory, perception, language skills, problem solving skills, and other type of cognitive function known to those of skill in the art. The terms “cognitive disorder,” “cognitive disease,” and “cognitive condition,” as used herein, refer to situations in which processes are disrupted or abnormal. The term “cognitive disorder,” as used herein encompasses all of the cognitive disorders described below and also all other cognitive disorders known to those of skill in the art. Types of cognitive disorders that are within the scope of the invention include, but are not limited to, dementias, delirium, amnesias, post-traumatic stress disorder and stress-induced cognitive dysfunction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “dementia” as used herein refers to decline in cognitive function due to damage or disease in the brain or central nervous system beyond that which might be expected from normal aging. Dementias typically affect cognitive functions such as learning, memory, attention, language skills, and problem solving skills. Types and causes of dementia include, but are not limited to, chronic diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia (also known as multi-infarct dementia), Binswanger's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), alcohol-induced persisting dementia, frontotemporal lobar degenerations (FTLD), Pick's disease, frontotemporal dementia (or frontal variant FTLD), semantic dementia (or temporal variant FTLD), progressive non-fluent aphasia, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and AIDS dementia complex.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther types of cognitive disorders that may be treated with the methods and compositions of the present invention include the various attention disorders. Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD; ADH is also referred to as Attention-deficit syndrome (ADS)) is a neurological disorder initially appearing in childhood which manifests itself with symptoms such as hyperactivity, forgetfulness, poor impulse control, and distractibility. In neurological terms, ADHD is currently considered to be a persistent and chronic syndrome for which no medical cure is available. ADHD is believed to affect between 3-5% of the United States population, including both children and adults. ADHD is sometimes referred to as ADD when only inattentiveness and distractibility are problematic. ADHD can be classified into three subtypes: predominantly inattentive (sometimes referred to as ADD), predominantly hyperactive-impulsive, and combined. Those presenting impairing symptoms of ADHD who do not fully fit the criteria for any of the three subtypes can be diagnosed with “ADHD Not Otherwise Specified.” The symptoms of ADHD are given the name “Hyperkinetic disorders”. When a conduct disorder is present, the condition is referred to as “Hyperkinetic conduct disorder”. All of the above conditions are within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the cognitive disorder is not Alzheimer's Disease. In another embodiment, the cognitive disorder is not memory loss. In another embodiment, the cognitive disorder is not age-dependent memory loss.\n\n\n \nPrevention and Treatment\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the present invention provides compositions and methods that are useful for treating and/or preventing conditions affecting the nervous system, such as neuropathies, seizures and cognitive disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the compositions and methods of the present invention may be used preventively in subjects who are not yet suffering from neuropathies, seizures or cognitive disorders, but whom exhibit one or more “risk factors” or are otherwise predisposed to the development of neuropathies, seizures or cognitive disorders.\n\n\n \nSubjects\n\n\n \n \n \nIn preferred embodiments, the compositions described herein are administered therapeutically or prophylactically to subjects who are suffering from, or at risk of developing a disease, disorder or condition affecting the nervous system, such as a neuropathy, seizures or a cognitive disorder. Such a subject may be any animal. For example, in one embodiment, the subject is a mammal. Examples of mammals that may be treated using the methods and compositions of the invention include, but are not limited to, primates, rodents, ovine species, bovine species, porcine species, equine species, feline species and canine species. In preferred embodiments the subjects are human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn preferred embodiments, the methods and compositions of the invention may be used to treat or prevent a disease, disorder or condition affecting the nervous system, such as a neuropathy, seizures or a cognitive disorder, in a subject having a mutation in a ryanodine receptor gene, such as a mutation that results in defective functioning of the ryanodine receptor, such as an increased open probability or “leakiness” of the ryanodine receptor.

No. 10/680,988, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.\n\n\n \nRoutes of Activity\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention reduce the open probability of RyR by increasing the affinity of FKBP12 (calstabin1) and FKBP12.6 (calstabin2) for, respectively PKA-phosphorylated RyR1 and PKA-phosphorylated RyR2. Moreover, the compounds of Formula I normalize gating of mutant RyR channels, including CPVT-associated mutant RyR2 channels, by increasing FKBP12 (calstabin1) and FKBP12.6 (calstabin2) binding affinity. Therefore, the compounds of the invention prevent disorders and conditions involving modulation of the RyR receptors, particularly the RyR1 and RyR2 receptors. Examples of such disorders and conditions include, without limitation, cardiac disorders and diseases, skeletal muscular disorders and diseases, cognitive disorders and diseases, malignant hyperthermia, diabetes, and sudden infant death syndrome. Cardiac disorder and diseases include, but are not limited to, irregular heartbeat disorders and diseases; exercise-induced irregular heartbeat disorders and diseases; sudden cardiac death; exercise-induced sudden cardiac death; congestive heart failure; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; and high blood pressure. Irregular heartbeat disorders and diseases include and exercise-induced irregular heartbeat disorders and diseases include, but are not limited to, atrial and ventricular arrhythmia; atrial and ventricular fibrillation; atrial and ventricular tachyarrhythmia; atrial and ventricular tachycardia; catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT); and exercise-induced variants thereof. Skeletal muscular disorder and diseases include, but are not limited to, skeletal muscle fatigue, exercise-induced skeletal muscle fatigue, muscular dystrophy, bladder disorders, and incontinence. Cognitive disorders and diseases include, but are not limited to, Alzheimer's Disease, forms of memory loss, and age-dependent memory loss. The compounds of the invention treat these disorders and conditions by increasing FKBP12 (calstabin1)-RyR1 binding affinity and increasing FKBP12.6 (calstabin2)-RyR2 binding affinity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with the foregoing, the present invention provides a method for limiting or preventing a decrease in the level of RyR-bound FKBP (calstabin) in cells of a subject. As used herein, “RyR” includes RyR1, RyR2, and RyR3. Additionally, FKBP includes both FKBP12 (calstabin1) and FKBP12.6 (calstabin2). “RyR-bound FKBP” therefore refers to RyR1-bound FKBP12 (calstabin1), RyR2-bound FKBP12.6 (calstabin2), and RyR3-bound FKBP12 (calstabin1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “RyR” also includes an “RyR protein” and an “RyR analogue.” An “RyR analogue” is a functional variant of the RyR protein, having RyR biological activity, that has 60% or greater amino-acid-sequence homology with the RyR protein. The RyR of the present invention are unphosphorylated, phosphorylated (e.g., by PKA), or hyperphosphorylated (e.g., by PKA). As further used herein, the term “RyR biological activity” refers to the activity of a protein or peptide that demonstrates an ability to associate physically with, or bind with, FKBP12 (calstabin1) in the case of RyR1 and RyR3, and FKBP12.6 (calstabin2) in the case of RyR2 (i.e., binding of approximately two fold or, approximately five fold, above the background binding of a negative control), under the conditions of the assays described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “FKBP” includes both an “FKBP protein” and an “FKBP analogue,” whether it be FKBP12 (calstabin1) or FKBP12.6 (calstabin2). Unless otherwise indicated herein, “protein” shall include a protein, protein domain, polypeptide, or peptide, and any fragment thereof. An “FKBP analogue” is a functional variant of the FKBP protein, having FKBP biological activity, that has 60% or greater amino-acid-sequence homology with the FKBP protein, whether it be FKBP12 (calstabin1) or FKBP12.6 (calstabin2). As further used herein, the term “FKBP biological activity” refers to the activity of a protein or peptide that demonstrates an ability to associate physically with, or bind with, unphosphorylated or non-hyperphosphorylated RyR2 (i.e., binding of approximately two fold, or approximately five fold, above the background binding of a negative control), under the conditions of the assays described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFKBP binds to the RyR channel, one molecule per RyR subunit. Accordingly, as used herein, the term “RyR-bound FKBP” includes a molecule of an FKBP12 (calstabin1) protein that is bound to an RyR1 protein subunit or a tetramer of FKBP12 that is in association with a tetramer of RyR1, a molecule of FKBP12.6 (calstabin2) protein that is bound to an RyR2 protein subunit or a tetramer of FKBP12.6 that is in association with a tetramer of RyR2, and a molecule of an FKBP12 (calstabin1) protein that is bound to an RyR3 protein subunit or a tetramer of FKBP12 that is in association with a tetramer of RyR3. Therefore, “RyR-bound FKBP” refers to “RyR1-bound FKBP12,” “RyR2-bound FKBP12.6,” and “RyR3-bound FKBP12.”\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with the method of the present invention, a “decrease” or “disorder” in the level of RyR-bound FKBP in cells of a subject refers to a detectable decrease, diminution or reduction in the level of RyR-bound FKBP in cells of the subject. Such a decrease is limited or prevented in cells of a subject when the decrease is in any way halted, hindered, impeded, obstructed or reduced by the administration of compounds of the invention, such that the level of RyR-bound FKBP in cells of the subject is higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of the administered compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe level of RyR-bound FKBP in a subject is detected by standard assays and techniques, including those readily determined from the known art (e.g., immunological techniques, hybridization analysis, immunoprecipitation, Western-blot analysis, fluorescence imaging techniques and/or radiation detection, etc.), as well as any assays and detection methods disclosed herein. For example, protein is isolated and purified from cells of a subject using standard methods known in the art, including, without limitation, extraction from the cells (e.g., with a detergent that solubilizes the protein) where necessary, followed by affinity purification on a column, chromatography (e.g., FTLC and HPLC), immunoprecipitation (with an antibody), and precipitation (e.g., with isopropanol and a reagent such as Trizol). Isolation and purification of the protein is followed by electrophoresis (e.g., on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel). A decrease in the level of RyR-bound FKBP in a subject, or the limiting or prevention thereof, is determined by comparing the amount of RyR-bound FKBP detected prior to the administration of a compound of the invention (in accordance with methods described below) with the amount detected a suitable time after administration of the compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA decrease in the level of RyR-bound FKBP in cells of a subject is limited or prevented, for example, by inhibiting dissociation of FKBP and RyR in cells of the subject; by increasing binding between FKBP and RyR in cells of the subject; or by stabilizing the RyR-FKBP complex in cells of a subject. As used herein, the term “inhibiting dissociation” includes blocking, decreasing, inhibiting, limiting or preventing the physical dissociation or separation of an FKBP subunit from an RyR molecule in cells of the subject, and blocking, decreasing, inhibiting, limiting or preventing the physical dissociation or separation of an RyR molecule from an FKBP subunit in cells of the subject. As further used herein, the term “increasing binding” includes enhancing, increasing, or improving the ability of phosphorylated RyR to associate physically with FKBP (e.g., binding of approximately two fold or, approximately five fold, above the background binding of a negative control) in cells of the subject and enhancing, increasing or improving the ability of FKBP to associate physically with phosphorylated RyR (e.g., binding of approximately two fold, or, approximately five fold, above the background binding of a negative control) in cells of the subject. Additionally, a decrease in the level of RyR-bound FKBP in cells of a subject is limited or prevented by directly decreasing the level of phosphorylated RyR in cells of the subject or by indirectly decreasing the level of phosphorylated RyR in the cells (e.g., by targeting an enzyme (such as PKA) or another endogenous molecule that regulates or modulates the functions or levels of phosphorylated RyR in the cells). In one embodiment, the level of phosphorylated RyR in the cells is decreased by at least 10% in the method of the present invention. In another embodiment, the level of phosphorylated RyR is decreased by at least 20%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe subject of the present invention are in vitro and in vivo systems, including, without limitation, isolated or cultured cells or tissues, non-cell in vitro assay systems and an animal (e.g., an amphibian, a bird, a fish, a mammal, a marsupial, a human, a domestic animal (such as a cat, dog, monkey, horse, mouse or rat) or a commercial animal (such as a cow or pig)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cells of a subject include striated muscle cells. A striated muscle is a muscle in which the repeating units (sarcomeres) of the contractile myofibrils are arranged in registry throughout the cell, resulting in transverse or oblique striations that are observed at the level of a light microscope. Examples of striated muscle cells include, without limitation, voluntary (skeletal) muscle cells and cardiac muscle cells. In one embodiment, the cell used in the method of the present invention is a human cardiac muscle cell. As used herein, the term “cardiac muscle cell” includes cardiac muscle fibers, such as those found in the myocardium of the heart. Cardiac muscle fibers are composed of chains of contiguous heart-muscle cells, or cardiomyocytes, joined end to end at intercalated disks. These disks possess two kinds of cell junctions: expanded desmosomes extending along their transverse portions, and gap junctions, the largest of which lie along their longitudinal portions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA decrease in the level of RyR-bound FKBP is limited or prevented in cells of a subject by administering the compounds of the invention to the subject; this would also permit contact between cells of the subject and the compounds of the invention. The compounds of the invention are modulators of calcium-ion channels. In addition to regulating Ca\n2+\n levels in myocardial cells, the compounds of the invention modulate the Na\n+\n current and the inward-rectifier K\n+\n current in cells, such as guinea pig ventricular cells, and inhibits the delayed-rectifier K\n+\n current in cells, such as guinea pig atrial cells.\n\n\n \nPharmaceutical Composition\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention are formulated into pharmaceutical compositions for administration to human subjects in a biologically compatible form suitable for administration in vivo. According to another aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising compounds of the invention in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent and/or carrier. The pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier must be “acceptable” in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the composition and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. The pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier employed herein is selected from various organic or inorganic materials that are used as materials for pharmaceutical formulations and which are incorporated as analgesic agents, buffers, binders, disintegrants, diluents, emulsifiers, excipients, extenders, glidants, solubilizers, stabilizers, suspending agents, tonicity agents, vehicles and viscosity-increasing agents. If necessary, pharmaceutical additives, such as antioxidants, aromatics, colorants, flavor-improving agents, preservatives, and sweeteners, are also added. Examples of acceptable pharmaceutical carriers include carboxymethyl cellulose, crystalline cellulose, glycerin, gum arabic, lactose, magnesium stearate, methyl cellulose, powders, saline, sodium alginate, sucrose, starch, talc and water, among others.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical formulations of the present invention are prepared by methods well-known in the pharmaceutical arts. For example, the compounds of the invention are brought into association with a carrier and/or diluent, as a suspension or solution. Optionally, one or more accessory ingredients (e.g., buffers, flavoring agents, surface active agents, and the like) also are added. The choice of carrier is determined by the solubility and chemical nature of the compounds, chosen route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention are administered to a subject by contacting target cells (e.g., cardiac muscle cells) in vivo in the subject with the compounds. The compounds of the invention are contacted with (e.g., introduced into) cells of the subject using known techniques utilized for the introduction and administration of proteins, nucleic acids and other drugs. Examples of methods for contacting the cells with (i.e., treating the cells with) the compounds of the invention include, without limitation, absorption, electroporation, immersion, injection, introduction, liposome delivery, transfection, transfusion, vectors and other drug-delivery vehicles and methods. When the target cells are localized to a particular portion of a subject, it is desirable to introduce the compounds for the invention directly to the cells, by injection or by some other means (e.g., by introducing the compounds into the blood or another body fluid). The target cells are contained in tissue of a subject and are detected by standard detection methods readily determined from the known art, examples of which include, without limitation, immunological techniques (e.g., immunohistochemical staining), fluorescence imaging techniques, and microscopic techniques.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, the compounds of the present invention are administered to a human or animal subject by known procedures including, without limitation, oral administration, sublingual or buccal administration, parenteral administration, transdermal administration, via inhalation or intranasally, vaginally, rectally, and intramuscularly.

In one embodiment, the agent is administered to the subject by way of delivery to the subject's muscles including, but not limited to, the subject's cardiac muscles. In an embodiment, the agent is administered to the subject by way of targeted delivery to cardiac muscle cells via a catheter inserted into the subject's heart.

Additionally, the formulation is presented with disintegrators, such as corn starch, potato starch or sodium carboxymethylcellulose. The formulation also is presented with dibasic calcium phosphate anhydrous or sodium starch glycolate. Finally, the formulation is presented with lubricants, such as talc or magnesium stearate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor parenteral administration (i.e., administration by injection through a route other than the alimentary canal), the compounds of the invention are combined with a sterile aqueous solution that is isotonic with the blood of the subject. Such a formulation is prepared by dissolving a solid active ingredient in water containing physiologically-compatible substances, such as sodium chloride, glycine and the like, and having a buffered pH compatible with physiological conditions, so as to produce an aqueous solution, then rendering said solution sterile. The formulation is presented in unit or multi-dose containers, such as sealed ampoules or vials. The formulation is delivered by any mode of injection, including, without limitation, epifascial, intracapsular, intracranial, intracutaneous, intrathecal, intramuscular, intraorbital, intraperitoneal, intraspinal, intrasternal, intravascular, intravenous, parenchymatous, subcutaneous, or sublingual or by way of catheter into the subject's heart.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor transdermal administration, the compounds of the invention are combined with skin penetration enhancers, such as propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, isopropanol, ethanol, oleic acid, N-methylpyrrolidone and the like, which increase the permeability of the skin to the compounds of the invention and permit the compounds to penetrate through the skin and into the bloodstream. The compounds of the invention/enhancer composition also are further combined with a polymeric substance, such as ethylcellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, ethylene/vinylacetate, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, and the like, to provide the composition in gel form, which are dissolved in a solvent, such as methylene chloride, evaporated to the desired viscosity and then applied to backing material to provide a patch.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the composition is in unit dose form such as a tablet, capsule or single-dose vial. Suitable unit doses, i.e., therapeutically effective amounts, can be determined during clinical trials designed appropriately for each of the conditions for which administration of a chosen compound is indicated and will, of course, vary depending on the desired clinical endpoint. The present invention also provides articles of manufacture for treating and preventing disorders, such as cardiac disorders, in a subject. The articles of manufacture comprise a pharmaceutical composition of one or more of the compounds of the invention as described herein. The articles of manufacture are packaged with indications for various disorders that the pharmaceutical compositions are capable of treating and/or preventing. For example, the articles of manufacture comprise a unit dose of a compound disclosed herein that is capable of treating or preventing a muscular disorder, and an indication that the unit dose is capable of treating or preventing a certain disorder, for example an arrhythmia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with a method of the present invention, the compounds of the invention are administered to the subject (or are contacted with cells of the subject) in an amount effective to limit or prevent a decrease in the level of RyR-bound FKBP in the subject, particularly in cells of the subject. This amount is readily determined by the skilled artisan, based upon known procedures, including analysis of titration curves established in vivo and methods and assays disclosed herein. A suitable amount of the compounds of the invention effective to limit or prevent a decrease in the level of RyR-bound FKBP in the subject ranges from about 5 mg/kg/day to about 20 mg/kg/day, and/or is an amount sufficient to achieve plasma levels ranging from about 300 ng/ml to about 1000 ng/ml. In an embodiment, the amount of compounds from the invention ranges from about 10 mg/kg/day to about 20 mg/kg/day. In another embodiment, from about 0.01 mg/kg/day to about 10 mg/kg/day is administered. In another embodiment, from about 0.01 mg/kg/day to about 5 mg/kg/day is administered. In another embodiment, from about 0.05 mg/kg/day to about 5 mg/kg/day is administered. In another, preferred embodiment, from about 0.05 mg/kg/day to about 1 mg/kg/day is administered.\n\n\n \nUses\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides a new range of therapeutic treatments for patients with various disorders involving modulation of the RyR receptors, particularly skeletal muscular disorders (RyR1), cardiac (RyR2) disorders, and cognitive (RyR3) disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the present invention, the subject has not yet developed a disorder, such as cardiac disorders (e.g., exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmia). In another embodiment of the present invention, the subject is in need of treatment for a disorder, including a cardiac disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the present invention, the subject has not yet developed symptoms of muscle fatigue, (e.g., exercise-induced muscle fatigue). In another embodiment of the present invention, the subject is in need of treatment for a disorder associated with muscle fatigue, including skeletal muscular disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious disorders that the compounds of the invention treat or prevent include, but are not limited to, cardiac disorders and diseases, skeletal muscular disorders and diseases, cognitive disorders and diseases, malignant hyperthermia, diabetes, and sudden infant death syndrome. Cardiac disorder and diseases include, but are not limited to, irregular heartbeat disorders and diseases; exercise-induced irregular heartbeat disorders and diseases; sudden cardiac death; exercise-induced sudden cardiac death; congestive heart failure; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; and high blood pressure. Irregular heartbeat disorders and diseases include and exercise-induced irregular heartbeat disorders and diseases include, but are not limited to, atrial and ventricular arrhythmia; atrial and ventricular fibrillation; atrial and ventricular tachyarrhythmia; atrial and ventricular tachycardia; catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT); and exercise-induced variants thereof. Skeletal muscular disorder and diseases include, but are not limited to, skeletal muscle fatigue, exercise-induced skeletal muscle fatigue, muscular dystrophy, bladder disorders, and incontinence. Cognitive disorders and diseases include, but are not limited to, Alzheimer's. Disease, forms of memory loss, and age-dependent memory loss. One skilled in the art will recognize still other diseases, including but not limited to muscular and cardiac disorders, that the compounds of the invention are useful to treat, in accordance with the information provided herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of compounds of the invention effective to limit or prevent a decrease in the level of RyR2-bound FKBP12.6 in the subject is an amount effective to prevent exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmia in the subject. Cardiac arrhythmia is a disturbance of the electrical activity of the heart that manifests as an abnormality in heart rate or heart rhythm. As used herein, an amount of compounds of the invention “effective to prevent exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmia” includes an amount of compounds of Formula I, I-a, I-b, I-c, I-d, I-e, I-f, I-g, I-h, I-j, I-k, I-k-1, I-l, I-l-1, I-m, I-m-1, I-n, I-o, I-p, and II, effective to prevent the development of the clinical impairment or symptoms of the exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmia (e.g., palpitations, fainting, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia and sudden cardiac death). The amount of the compounds effective to prevent exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmia in a subject will vary depending upon the particular factors of each case, including the type of exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmia, the subject's weight, the severity of the subject's condition, and the mode of administration of the compounds. This amount is readily determined by the skilled artisan, based upon known procedures, including clinical trials, and methods disclosed herein. In one embodiment, the amount of the compounds of the invention effective to prevent the exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmia is an amount effective to prevent exercise-induced sudden cardiac death in the subject. In another embodiment, the compounds of the invention prevent exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmia and exercise-induced sudden cardiac death in the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of compounds of the invention effective to limit or prevent a decrease in the level of RyR1-bound FKBP12 in the subject is an amount effective to prevent muscle fatigue in the subject. This amount is readily determined by the skilled artisan, based upon known procedures, including clinical trials, and methods disclosed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBecause of its ability to stabilize RyR-bound FKBP and maintain and restore balance in the context of dynamic PKA phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of RyR, the compounds of the invention are also useful in treating a subject who has already experienced clinical symptoms of these various disorders. For example, if the symptoms of the disorder are observed in the subject early enough, the compounds of the invention are effective in limiting or preventing a further decrease in the level of RyR-bound FKBP in the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, the subject of the present invention is a candidate for exercise-induced cardiac disorders, such as exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmia. Exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmia is a heart condition (e.g., a ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia, including any that leads to sudden cardiac death) that develops during/after a subject has undergone physical exercise. A “candidate” for an exercise-induced cardiac disorder is a subject who is known to be, or is believed to be, or is suspected of being, at risk for developing a cardiac disorder during/after physical exercise. Examples of candidates for exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmia include, without limitation, an animal/person known to have catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT); an animal/person suspected of having CPVT; and an animal/person who is known to be, or is believed to be, or is suspected of being at risk for developing cardiac arrhythmia during/after physical exercise, and who is about to exercise, is currently exercising or has just completed exercise. As discussed above, CPVT is an inherited disorder in individuals with structurally-normal hearts. It is characterized by stress-induced ventricular tachycardia—a lethal arrhythmia that causes sudden cardiac death. In subjects with CPVT, physical exertion and/or stress induce bidirectional and/or polymorphic ventricular tachycardias that lead to sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the absence of detectable structural heart disease. Individuals with CPVT have ventricular arrhythmias when subjected to exercise, but do not develop arrhythmias at rest.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, the subject of the present invention can be a candidate for muscle fatigue disorder, including but not limited to any chronic disorder associated with muscle fatigue, or stress or exercise-induced muscle fatigue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, in still another embodiment of the present invention, the subject has been exercising, or is currently exercising, and has developed an exercise-induced disorder. In this case, the amount of the compounds of the invention effective to limit or prevent a decrease in the level of RyR-bound FKBP in the subject is an amount of compound effective to treat the exercise-induced disorder in the subject. As used herein, an amount of compounds of the invention “effective to treat an exercise-induced disorder” includes an amount of compound of the invention effective to alleviate or ameliorate the clinical impairment or symptoms of the exercise-induced disorder characterized by muscle fatigue or an amount of compound of the invention effective to alleviate or ameliorate the clinical impairment or symptoms of the exercise-induced disorder (e.g., in the case of cardiac arrhythmia, palpitations, fainting, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and sudden cardiac death). The amount of compounds of the invention effective to treat an exercise-induced disorder in a subject will vary depending upon the particular factors of each case, including the type of exercise-induced disorder, the subject's weight, the severity of the subject's condition, and the mode of administration of the compounds of the invention. This amount is readily determined by the skilled artisan, based upon known procedures, including clinical trials, and methods disclosed herein. In an embodiment, the compounds of the invention treat exercise-induced disorders in the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention further provides a method for treating exercise-induced disorders in a subject. The method comprises administering the compounds of the invention to the subject in an amount effective to treat the exercise-induced disorder in the subject. A suitable amount of the compounds of the invention effective to treat, for example, exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmia in the subject ranges from about 5 mg/kg/day to about 20 mg/kg/day, and/or is an amount sufficient to achieve plasma levels ranging from about 300 ng/ml to about 1000 ng/ml. The present invention also provides a method for preventing an exercise-induced disorder in a subject. The method comprises administering the compounds of the invention to the subject in an amount effective to prevent the exercise-induced disorder in the subject. A suitable amount of the compounds of the invention effective to prevent the exercise-induced disorder in the subject ranges from about 5 mg/kg/day to about 20 mg/kg/day, and/or is an amount sufficient to achieve plasma levels ranging from about 300 ng/ml to about 1000 ng/ml. Additionally, the present invention provides a method for preventing exercise-induced disorders in a subject. The method comprises administering the compounds of the invention to the subject in an amount effective to prevent an exercise-induced disorder in the subject. A suitable amount of the compounds of the invention effective to prevent an exercise-induced disorder in the subject ranges from about 5 mg/kg/day to about 20 mg/kg/day, and/or is an amount sufficient to achieve plasma levels ranging from about 300 ng/ml to about 1000 ng/ml.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, the compounds prevent irregular heartbeat disorders in subjects with heterozygous defects in the FKBP12.6 gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention can be used alone, in combination with each other, or in combination with other agents that have cardiovascular activity including, but not limited to, diuretics, anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, antiarrhythmics, inotropic agents, chronotropic agents, α and β blockers, angiotensin inhibitors and vasodilators. Further, such combinations of the compounds of the present invention and other cardiovascular agents are administered separately or in conjunction. In addition, the administration of one element of the combination is prior to, concurrent to or subsequent to the administration of other agent(s).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn various embodiments of the above-described methods, the exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmia in the subject is associated with VT. In some embodiments, the VT is CPVT. In other embodiments of these methods, the subject is a candidate for exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmia, including candidates for exercise-induced sudden cardiac death.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn view of the foregoing methods, the present invention also provides use of the compounds of the invention in a method for limiting or preventing a decrease in the level of RyR-bound FKBP in a subject who is a candidate for a disorder. The present invention also provides use of the compounds of the invention in a method for treating or preventing a muscular disorder in a subject. Furthermore, the present invention provides use of the compounds of the invention in a method for treating or preventing exercise-induced muscular disorders in a subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, the present invention further provides a method for assaying the effects of the compounds of the invention in preventing disorders and diseases associated with the RyR receptors. The method comprises the steps of: (a) obtaining or generating a culture of cells containing RyR; (b) contacting the cells with one or more of the compounds of the invention; (c) exposing the cells to one or more conditions known to increase phosphorylation of RyR in cells; and (d) determining if the one or more compounds of the invention limits or prevents a decrease in the level of RyR-bound FKBP in the cells. As used herein, a cell “containing RyR” is a cell in which RyR, including RyR1, RyR2, and RyR3, or a derivative or homologue thereof, is naturally expressed or naturally occurs. Conditions known to increase phosphorylation of RyR in cells include, without limitation, PKA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the method of the present invention, cells are contacted with one or more of the compounds of the invention by any of the standard methods of effecting contact between drugs/agents and cells, including any modes of introduction and administration described herein. The level of RyR-bound FKBP in the cell is measured or detected by known procedures, including any of the methods, molecular procedures and assays known to one of skill in the art or described herein. In one embodiment of the present invention, the one or more compounds of the invention limits or prevents a decrease in the level of RyR-bound FKBP in the cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRyR, including RyR1, RyR2, and RyR3, has been implicated in a number of biological events in cells. For example, it has been shown that RyR2 channels play an important role in EC coupling and contractility in cardiac muscle cells. Therefore, it is clear that preventive drugs designed to limit or prevent a decrease in the level of RyR-bound FKBP in cells, particularly RyR2-bound FKPB12.6 in cardiac muscle cells, are useful in the regulation of a number of RyR-associated biological events, including EC coupling and contractility. Thus, the one or more compounds of the invention are evaluated for effect on EC coupling and contractility in cells, particularly cardiac muscle cells, and therefore, usefulness for preventing exercise-induced sudden cardiac death.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, the method of the present invention further comprises the steps of contacting one or more compounds of the invention with a culture of cells containing RyR; and determining if the one or more compounds has an effect on an RyR-associated biological event in the cells. As used herein, a “RyR-associated biological event” includes a biochemical or physiological process in which RyR levels or activity have been implicated. As disclosed herein, examples of RyR-associated biological events include, without limitation, EC coupling and contractility in cardiac muscle cells. According to this method of the present invention, the one or more compounds are contacted with one or more cells (such as cardiac muscle cells) in vitro. For example, a culture of the cells is incubated with a preparation containing the one or more compounds of the invention. The compounds' effect on a RyR-associated biological event then is assessed by any biological assays or methods known in the art, including immunoblotting, single-channel recordings and any others disclosed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention is further directed to one or more compounds of the invention, identified by the above-described identification method, as well as a pharmaceutical composition comprising the compound and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or diluent. The compounds are useful for preventing exercise-induced sudden cardiac death in a subject, and for treating or preventing other RyR-associated conditions. As used herein, a “RyR-associated condition” is a condition, disease, or disorder in which RyR level or activity has been implicated, and includes an RyR-associated biological event. The RyR-associated condition is treated or prevented in the subject by administering to the subject an amount of the compound effective to treat or prevent the RyR-associated condition in the subject. This amount is readily determined by one skilled in the art. In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method for preventing exercise-induced sudden cardiac death in a subject, by administering the one or more compounds of the invention to the subject in an amount effective to prevent the exercise-induced sudden cardiac death in the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides an in vivo method for assaying the effectiveness of the compounds of the invention in preventing disorders and diseases associated with the RyR receptors. The method comprises the steps of: (a) obtaining or generating an animal containing RyR; (b) administering one or more of the compounds of the invention to the animal; (c) exposing the animal to one or more conditions known to increase phosphorylation of RyR in cells; and (d) determining the extent the compound limits or prevents a decrease in the level of RyR-bound FKBP in the animal. The method further comprises the steps of: (e) administering one or more of the compounds of the invention to an animal containing RyR; and (f) determining the extent of the effect of the compound on a RyR-associated biological event in the animal. Also provided is a pharmaceutical composition comprising this compound; and a method for preventing exercise-induced sudden cardiac death in a subject, by administering this compound to the subject in an amount effective to prevent the exercise-induced sudden cardiac death in the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt has been demonstrated that compounds which block PKA activation would be expected to reduce the activation of the RyR channel, resulting in less release of calcium into the cell. Compounds that bind to the RyR channel at the FKBP binding site, but do not come off the channel when the channel is phosphorylated by PKA, would also be expected to decrease the activity of the channel in response to PKA activation or other triggers that activate the RyR channel. Such compounds would also result in less calcium release into the cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy way of example, the diagnostic assays screen for the release of calcium into cells via the RyR channel, using calcium-sensitive fluorescent dyes (e.g., Fluo-3, Fura-2, and the like). Cells are loaded with the fluorescent dye of choice, then stimulated with RyR activators to determine the reduction of the calcium-dependent fluorescent signal (Brillantes, et al., Stabilization of calcium release channel (ryanodine receptor) function by FK506-binding protein. \nCell, \n77:513-23, 1994; Gillo, et al., Calcium entry during induced differentiation in murine erythroleukemia cells. \nBlood, \n81:783-92, 1993; Jayaraman, et al., Regulation of the \n \ninositol\n \n 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor by tyrosine phosphorylation. \nScience, \n272:1492-94, 1996). Calcium-dependent fluorescent signals are monitored with a photomultiplier tube, and analyzed with appropriate software. This assay can easily be automated to screen the compounds of the invention using multiwell dishes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo demonstrate that the compounds of inhibit the PKA-dependent activation of RyR-mediated intracellular calcium release, an assay involves the expression of recombinant RyR channels in a heterologous expression system, such as Sf9, HEK293, or CHO cells. RyR could also be co-expressed with beta-adrenergic receptors. This would permit assessment of the effect of compounds of the invention on RyR activation, in response to addition of beta-adrenergic receptor agonists.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe level of PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 which correlates with the degree of heart failure also is assayed and then used to determine the efficacy of the one or more compounds of the invention to block the PKA phosphorylation of the RyR2 channel. Such an assay is based on the use of antibodies that are specific for the RyR2 protein. For example, the RyR2-channel protein is immunoprecipitated and then back-phosphorylated with PKA and [gamma\n32\nP]-ATP. The amount of radioactive [\n32\nP] label that is transferred to the RyR2 protein then is measured using a phosphorimager (Marx, et al., PKA phosphorylation dissociates FKBP12.6 from the calcium release channel (ryanodine receptor): defective regulation in failing hearts. \nCell, \n101:365-76, 2000).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother assay of the compounds of the invention involves use of a phosphoepitope-specific antibody that detects RyR1 that is PKA phosphorylated on \nSer\n 2843 or RyR2 that is PKA phosphorylated on \nSer\n 2809. Immunoblotting with such an antibody can be used to assess efficacy of these compounds for therapy for heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias. Additionally, RyR2 S2809A and RyR2 S2809D knock-in mice are used to assess efficacy of therapy for heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias. Such mice further provide evidence that PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 is a contributing factor in heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias by showing that the RyR2 S2809A mutation inhibits heart failure and arrhythmias, and that the RyR2 S2809D mutation worsens heart failure and arrhythmias.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore, in a specific embodiment, the present invention provides a method of treating heart failure, atrial fibrillation or exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmia, comprising administering to an animal in need thereof, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound selected from the compounds of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntracellular Ca\n2+\n leak is proposed as a principal mediator of depressed muscle performance and dystrophic muscle remodeling. Muscular dystrophies are heterogeneous hereditary diseases characterized by weakness and progressive muscle wasting. Of all forms of muscular dystrophies involving the dystrophin-associated protein complex (referred to as dystrophinopathies), Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is one of the most frequent genetic diseases (X-linked; 1 in 3,500 boys) with death usually occurring before \nage\n 30 by respiratory and/or cardiac failure in high numbers of patients. Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) represents a milder form of the disease associated with a reduction in the amount or expression of a truncated form of the dystrophin protein whereas Duchenne patients have been characterized by complete absence or very low levels of dystrophin. Duchenne and Becker's muscular dystrophy (DMD/BMD) are caused by mutations in the gene encoding the 427-kDa cytoskeletal protein dystrophin. However, with increasing age in BMD cardiac symptoms are more common than in DMD patients and do not correlate with skeletal muscle symptoms. Since genetic screening will not eliminative DMD due to a high incidence of sporadic cases, an effective therapy is highly desirable. DMD/BMD have been consistently associated with disturbed intracellular calcium metabolism. Because alterations of intracellular Ca\n2+\n concentrations in DMD myofibers are believed to represent a central pathogenic mechanism, development of a therapeutic intervention that prevents intracellular Ca\n2+\n abnormalities as a cause of skeletal muscle degeneration is highly desirable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is well established that lack of dystrophin expression is the primary genetic defect in DMD and BMD. However, the key mechanism leading to progressive muscle damage is largely unknown. It has been suggested that elevations of intracellular Ca\n2+\n concentrations ([Ca\n2+\n]\ni\n) under resting conditions directly contributed to toxic muscle cell (myofiber) damage and concurrent activation of Ca\n2+\n-dependent proteases. Since calpain activity is increased in necrotic muscle fibers of mdx mice and calpain dysfunction contributes to limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, preventing activation of calcium-dependent proteases by inhibiting intracellular Ca\n2+\n elevations represents a strategy to prevent muscle wasting in DMD. Significant differences in [Ca\n2+\n]\ni \nbetween normal and dystrophic muscles have been reported in myotubes and animal models including the dystrophin-deficient mdx mouse. Intracellular Ca\n2+\n elevations are prevented by administration of a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides a method of diagnosis of a disease or disorder in a subject, said method comprising: obtaining a cell or tissue sample from the subject; obtaining DNA from the cell or tissue; comparing the DNA from the cell or tissue with a control DNA encoding RyR to determine whether a mutation is present in the DNA from the cell or tissue, the presence of a mutation indicating a disease or disorder.

These processes are disclosed in the applications that are incorporate by reference in the first paragraph of this document, as well as in U.S. Pat. No. 7,704,409 and U.S. application Ser. Nos. 10/680,988 and 12/480,396, the content of each of which is also expressly incorporated herein by reference thereto.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt should be noted that the compounds used as starting materials for, or generated as intermediates in, the synthesis of the compounds of the invention, may themselves have structures encompassed by the formulae of the invention, and/or may themselves be active agents useful in the methods and compositions of the present invention. Such starting materials and intermediates may be useful for, inter alia, treating or preventing various disorders and diseases associated with RyR receptors such as muscular and cardiac disorders, treating or preventing a leak in a RyR2 receptor in a subject, or modulating the binding of RyR and FKBP in a subject. The present invention encompasses any of the starting materials or intermediates disclosed herein that have structures encompassed by Formula I, I-a, I-b, I-c, I-d, I-e, I-f, I-g, I-h, I-j, I-k, I-k-1, I-l, I-l-1, I-m, I-m-1, I-n, I-o, I-p or II, and/or which are useful as active agents in the methods and compositions of the present invention. For example, in one embodiment the compound S68, which is useful as a starting material for the synthesis of compounds S69-S75, may be used for, inter alia, treating or preventing various disorders and diseases associated with RyR receptors, treating or preventing a leak in a RyR2 receptor, or modulating the binding of RyR and FKBP in a subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the compound S26, which is useful in the synthesis of many of the compounds described herein (including S3, S4, S5, S7, S9, S11, S12, S13, S14 and other compounds) may be used for, inter alia, treating or preventing various disorders and diseases associated with RyR receptors, treating or preventing a leak in a RyR2 receptor, or modulating the binding of RyR and FKBP in a subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilarly, in another embodiment, the compound S25 (see U.S. Pat. No. 7,718,644) may also be used for, inter alia, treating or preventing various disorders and diseases associated with RyR receptors, treating or preventing a leak in a RyR2 receptor, or modulating the binding of RyR and FKBP in a subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention are prepared in different forms, such as salts, hydrates, solvates, complexes, prodrugs or salts of prodrugs and the invention includes all variant forms of the compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention further provides a composition, comprising radio labeled compounds of the invention. Labeling of the compounds of the invention is accomplished using one of a variety of different radioactive labels known in the art. The radioactive label of the present invention is, for example, a radioisotope. The radioisotope is any isotope that emits detectable radiation including, without limitation, \n35\nS, \n125\nI, \n3\nH, or \n14\nC. Radioactivity emitted by the radioisotope can be detected by techniques well known in the art. For example, gamma emission from the radioisotope is detected using gamma imaging techniques, particularly scintigraphic imaging.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy way of non-limiting example, radio-labeled compounds of the invention are prepared as follows. A compound of the invention is demethylated at the phenyl ring using BBr\n3\n. The resulting phenol compound then is re-methylated with a radio-labeled methylating agent (such as \n3\nH-dimethyl sulfate) in the presence of a base (such as NaH) to provide \n3\nH-labeled compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsing forced swimming as an efficient protocol to increase skeletal muscle aerobic capacity in mice, the composition and phosphorylation status of the skeletal RyR1 channel complex have been investigated. Unexpectedly, after 3 weeks of 90 mins swimming twice daily, C57B16 wild-type mice showed significantly increased RyR1 phosphorylation by PKA while Ca\n2+\n-calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) phosphorylation was not changed indicating specificity of the stress pathway RyR1 protein expression was stable, however, RyR1 channels were depleted of the stabilizing subunit calstabin1 (FKBP12). It has been shown that RyR1 hyperphosphorylation and calstabin1 depletion are consistent with leaky RyR1 channels that cause intracellular SR Ca\n2+\n leak.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRyR1 channels are PKA hyperphosphorylated and depleted of the stabilizing calstabin1 subunit after 3 weeks of 90 mins swimming twice daily. The immunoprecipitated RyR1 macromolecular channel complex shows increased PKA phosphorylation at Ser-2844 (corresponding to human RyR1-Ser-2843) whereas CaMKII phosphorylation at Ser-2849 (corresponding to human RyR1-Ser-2848) is unchanged. Concomitant with increased RyR1-Ser-2844 PKA hyperphosphorylation, calstabin1 is depleted from the channel complex. Normalization of phosphorylation and calstabin1 content to four subunits of the tetrameric channel complex shows a significant in increase in PKA phosphorylation and depletion of the stabilizing calstabin1 subunit.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention are prepared in different forms, such as salts, hydrates, solvates, complexes, pro-drugs or salts of prodrugs and the invention includes all variant forms of the compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “compound(s) of the invention” as used herein means a compound of Formula I, I-a, I-b, I-c, I-d, I-e, I-f, I-g, I-h, I-j, I-k, I-k-1, I-l, I-l-1, I-m, I-m-1, I-n, I-o, I-p and II, and salts, hydrates, prodrugs and solvates thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “pharmaceutical composition” refers to a mixture of one or more of the compounds described herein, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts, hydrates or pro-drugs thereof, with other chemical components, such as physiologically acceptable carriers and excipients. The purpose of a pharmaceutical composition is to facilitate administration of a compound to an organism.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “prodrug” refers to an agent which is converted into the parent drug in vivo. Pro-drugs are often useful because, in some situations, they are easier to administer than the parent drug. They are bioavailable, for instance, by oral administration whereas the parent drug is not. The prodrug also has improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. For example, the compound carries protective groups which are split off by hydrolysis in body fluids, e.g., in the bloodstream, thus releasing active compound or is oxidized or reduced in body fluids to release the compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA compound of the present invention also can be formulated as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, e.g., acid addition salt, and complexes thereof. The preparation of such salts can facilitate the pharmacological use by altering the physical characteristics of the agent without preventing its physiological effect. Examples of useful alterations in physical properties include, but are not limited to, lowering the melting point to facilitate transmucosal administration and increasing the solubility to facilitate administering higher concentrations of the drug.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention form hydrates or solvates, which are included in the scope of the claims. When the compounds of the present invention exist as regioisomers, configurational isomers, conformers or diasteroisomeric forms all such forms and various mixtures thereof are included in the scope of Formula I, I-a, I-b, I-c, I-d, I-e, I-f, I-g, I-h, I-j, I-k, I-k-1, I-l, I-l-1, I-m, I-m-1, I-n, I-o, I-p and II. It is possible to isolate individual isomers using known separation and purification methods, if desired. For example, when a compound of the present invention is a racemate, the racemate can be separated into the (S)-compound and (R)-compound by optical resolution. Individual optical isomers and mixtures thereof are included in the scope of Formula I, I-a, I-b, I-c, I-d, I-e, I-f, I-g, I-h, I-j, I-k, I-k-1, I-l, I-l-1, I-m, I-m-1, I-n, I-o, I-p and II.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “animal,” “subject” and “patient” as used herein include all members of the animal kingdom including, but not limited to, mammals, animals (e.g., cats, dogs, horses, etc.) and humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention further provides a composition, comprising radio labeled compounds of Formula I, I-a, I-b, I-c, I-d, I-e, I-f, I-g, I-h, I-j, I-k, I-k-1, I-l, I-l-1, I-m, I-m-1, I-n, I-o, and I-p. Labeling of the compounds is accomplished using one of a variety of different radioactive labels known in the art. The radioactive label of the present invention is, for example, a radioisotope. The radioisotope is any isotope that emits detectable radiation including, without limitation, \n35\nS, \n125\nI, \n3\nH, or \n14\nC. Radioactivity emitted by the radioisotope can be detected by techniques well known in the art. For example, gamma emission from the radioisotope is detected using gamma imaging techniques, particularly scintigraphic imaging.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy way of example, radio-labeled compounds of the invention are prepared as follows. A compound of the invention may be demethylated at the phenyl ring using BBr\n3\n. The resulting phenol compound then is re-methylated with a radio-labeled methylating agent (such as \n3\nH-dimethyl sulfate) in the presence of a base (such as NaH) to provide \n3\nH-labeled compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with the method of the present invention, the decrease in the level of RyR-bound FKBP is limited or prevented in the subject by decreasing the level of phosphorylated RyR in the subject. In one embodiment, the amount of the agent effective to limit or prevent a decrease in the level of RyR2-bound FKBP12.6 in the subject is an amount of the agent effective to treat or prevent heart failure, atrial fibrillation and/or exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmia in the subject. In another embodiment, the amount of the agent effective to limit or prevent a decrease in the level of RyR2-bound FKBP12.6 in the subject is an amount of the agent effective to prevent exercise-induced sudden cardiac death in the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn view of the foregoing, the present invention further provides a method for treating or preventing exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmia in a subject, comprising administering to the subject a 1,4-benzothiazepine compound, as disclosed herein, in an amount effective to treat or prevent exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmia in the subject.

In embodiment A, PKA phosphorylated RyR2 is generated as follows: cardiac SR membrane preparations (5 μl, 50 μg) are added to a total of 100 μl of kinase buffer (8 mM MgCl\n2\n, 10 mM EGTA, 50 mM Tris-PIPES, pH 6.8) containing 100 μM MgATP and 40 units of PKA, and incubated at room temperature. Samples are centrifuged at 95,000 g for 10 min and the pellets are washed three times in 0.2 ml imidazole buffer. The final pellets are pooled and resuspended in imidazole buffer (final concentration≈10 μg/μl). To test for the FKBP12.6 rebinding efficiency of JTV-519, PKA phosphorylated cardiac SR (50 mg) is incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature with the test compounds and 250 nM FKBP12.6 in 10 mM imidizol buffer, pH 7.0. Samples then are centrifuged at 100,000 g for 10 minutes and pellets washed 3 times with imidizol buffer. After washing, proteins are size-fractionated on 15% PAGE. Immunoblots are developed using an anti-FKBP antibody (1:3,000 dilution). The amount of rebinding is quantified using densitometry of Western blots and is compared to the amount of FKBP associated with RyR in non-phosphorylated SR. EC\n50\n's for the compounds are determined by generating FKBP binding data using concentrations of compounds ranging from 0.5-1000 nM. In embodiment B, currents through L-type Ca\n2+\n channels in isolated mouse cardiomyocytes are recorded using whole-cell patch clamp recording conditions with Ba\n2+\n as the charge carrier. The extracellular solution contains (in mM): N-methyl-D-glucamine, 125; BaCl\n2\n, 20; CsCl, 5; MgCl\n2\n, 1; HEPES, 10; glucose, 5; pH 7.4 (HCl). The intracellular solution contains (in mM): CsCl, 60; CaCl\n2\n, 1; EGTA, 11; MgCl\n2\n, 1; K\n2\nATP, 5; HEPES, 10; aspartic acid, 50; pH 7.4 (CsOH). Under these conditions, it is expected that the measured current was carried by Ba\n2+\n primarily through L-type calcium channels which is referred to as I\nCa,L\n. Drugs are applied by a local solution changer and reach the cell membrane within 1 s. The effects of nifedipine and S36 are tested with 20 ms long voltage-clamp steps to +10 or +20 mV (peak of current-voltage relation for each individual cell) from holding potentials of −80 mV or −40 mV. In embodiment C, the voltage-dependence of L-type Ca\n2+\n current blocked by JTV-519 (1 μM) and S36 (1 μM) are measured and presented.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs demonstrated by \nFIG. 2\n, embodiments A, B, C, and D, S36 prevents exercise-induced sudden cardiac death at lower plasma levels compared with JTV-519. In embodiment A are shown representative ECGs of an untreated FKBP12.6\n+/−\n mouse and JTV-519-treated FKBP12.6\n+/−\n and FKBP12.6\n−/−\n mice. Mice are treated with 0.5 mg JTV-519/per kilogram of body weight per hour for 7 days with an implanted osmotic mini-pump. JTV-519 has no effect on resting heart rate or other ECG parameters such as heart rate (HR). In embodiment B are shown sustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia recorded by telemetry in an untreated FKBP12.6\n+/−\n mouse (upper tracing) subjected to exercise testing, immediately followed by injection with 0.5 mg epinephrine per kilogram of body weight. Representative telemetry ECG recording of a JTV-519-treated FKBP12.6\n+/−\n mouse following the same protocol is shown in the bottom tracing. In embodiment C are shown numbers of mice with cardiac death (left), sustained VTs (>10 beats, middle), and nonsustained VTs (3 to 10 arrhythmogenic beats, right) in experimental groups of mice subjected to exercise testing and injection with 0.5 mg/kg epinephrine. In embodiment D, the dose-dependence of pharmacological effects of JTV-519 and S36 is shown. Plasma levels of 1 μM JTV-519 prevent cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death in FKBP12.6\n+/−\n mice. Plasma levels of 1 μM and 0.02 μM S36 also prevent cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death in FKBP12.6\n+/−\n mice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 3\n shows the results of treated mice that are subjected to permanent ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery resulting in myocardial infarction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs demonstrated by \nFIG. 4\n, S36 improves cardiac function in chronic heart failure post-myocardial infarction. Wild-type mice are subjected to permanent ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery resulting in myocardial infarction. Seven days following myocardial infartion, mice are treated with S36 (\nplasma concentration\n 200 nM) or placebo. Heart weight to body weight (HW/BW) ratios and pressure-volume loops quantifications (dP/dt, slope of the maximum derivative of change in systolic pressure over time) show reverse remodeling and improved cardiac contractility in S36-treated mice compared with placebo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 5\n is a summary graph of EC50 values of JTV-519 and compounds S1-S67 disclosed herein. The FKBP12.6 rebinding assay described above is used to determine the amount of FKBP12.6 binding to PKA-phosphorylated RyR2 at various concentrations (0.5-1000 nM) of the compounds shown. EC\n50 \nvalues are calculated using Michaelis-Menten curve fitting.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 6\n, embodiments A, B, and C, show CPVT-associated RyR2-P2328S channel function and structure. In embodiment A are shown representative single-channel current traces of RyR2-P2328S and RyR2-WT while embodiment B shows RyR2-P2328S. Embodiment C shows immunoblot analysis of calstabin-2 binding of RyR2-P2328S.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs demonstrated by \nFIG. 7\n, embodiments A and B, treatment with JTV-519 reduces PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 in mice with heart failure. Equivalent amounts of RyR2 are immunoprecipitated with an antibody against RyR2 (top blot). Representative immunoblots (embodiment A) and bar graphs (embodiment B) show the amount of PKA phosphorylated RyR2 at Ser-2808 bound to RyR2 in wild-type and calstabin2(FKBP12.6)\n−/−\n mice. Treatment with JTV-519 (0.5 mg/kg/h) for 28 days post-myocardial infarction reduces PKA-phosphorylation of RyR2, presumably due to reverse cardiac remodeling, in wildtype but not calstabin-2 (FKBP12.6)\n−/−\n mice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs demonstrated by \nFIG. 8\n, embodiments A and B, mice in which cardiac RyR2 cannot be PKA phosphorylated (RyR2-S2808A knockin mice) have improved cardiac function following myocardial infarction. Shown in embodiment A is the quantification of M-mode echocardiograms showing improved ejection fraction in RyR2-S2808A knockin mice compared with \nwildtype\n 28 days following permanent coronary artery ligation. Shown in embodiments B and C are pressure-volume loop quantifications showing (embodiment B) improved cardiac contractility and decreased cardiac dilation (embodiment C) in RyR2-S2808A knockin mice compared with wildtype following myocardial infarction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 9\n, embodiments A and B, demonstrate that mdx skeletal muscle has normal levels of RyR1 PKA phosphorylation, but depleted levels of calstabin1. The immunoblots in embodiment A show that mdx type mice have depleted levels of calstabin1 compared to a control (wild-type) mouse. The summary bar graphs of embodiment B show that the mdx mouse, nevertheless, has an equivalent level of PKA-phosphorylation. Therefore, it is concluded that calstabin1 depletion is a defect that is consistent with the intracellular Ca\n2+\n leak observed in skeletal muscle cells from mdx mice and myofibers from human mutation carriers. Intracellular SR Ca\n2+\n leak is likely to contribute to myofiber death and wasting of muscle mass by toxic intracellular Ca\n2+\n overload and activation of proteases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 10\n, embodiments A, B, and C, demonstrates that SR Ca\n2+\n leak at the subcellular level in skeletal muscles of animals with heart failure is detectable. Life quality and prognosis in heart failure (HF) patients is severely decreased due to skeletal muscle dysfunction (e.g., shortness of breath due to diaphragmatic weakness, and exercise intolerance due to limb skeletal muscle fatigue) in addition to depressed cardiac function. Dysregulation of intracellular SR Ca\n2+\n release is a pathogenic mechanism underlying skeletal muscle dysfunction in HF. HF in animals causes significantly accelerates intrinsic skeletal muscle fatigue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEmbodiments A and B of \nFIG. 10\n are ΔF/F fluorescence line scan images of representative examples of Ca\n2+\n sparks in myofibers from sham and postmyocardial infarction (PMI) rats and corresponding Ca\n2+\n spark time course. Embodiment C shows the relative distribution of the spatio-temporal properties of the Ca\n2+\n sparks. Charts indicate 25, 50, 75 percentiles, the horizontal lines indicate the range from 1-99% of the distribution. Sham, open symbols (n=137, three animals); postmyocardial infarction (PMI), gray symbols (n=82, two animals). *, P<0.05. FDHM, full duration at 50% peak amplitude; FWHM, full width at 50% peak amplitude.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 11\n, embodiment A, B, C, and D demonstrates that Ser-2843 is the unique PKA phosphorylation site in skeletal RyR1 channels. (A) Representative single channel traces of wild-type RyR1, (B) effect of exogenous PKA phosphorylation of RyR1 (wt RyR1-P), (C) PKA does not affect RyR1-S2843A that contains a non-functional PKA phosphorylation site. Since PKA does not increase RyR1-S2843A activity, Ser-2843 appears to constitute the unique PKA phosphorylation site in RyR1 channels in skeletal muscle. Accordingly, (D) constitutively phosphorylated RyR1-S2843D mimics exogenous PKA phosphorylation shown in (B) confirming that Ser-2843 is the unique PKA phosphorylation site in skeletal RyR1 channels. RyR1 single channel recordings in planar lipid bilayers show activity of the channels at 150 nM [Ca\n2+\n]\ncis \n(cytosolic side) with 1 mM ATP. Recordings were at 0 mV, closed state of the channels as indicated by ‘c’, and channel openings are upward deflections. All point amplitude histograms are shown on the right. Open probability (P\no\n) and mean closed (Tc) and open (To) dwell times are indicated above each channel tracing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 12\n, embodiments A and B, demonstrates the depletion of stabilizing calstabin1 and PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR1 channels from sustained exercise. Aerobic exercise can be defined as a form of physical exercise that increases the heart rate and enhances oxygen intake to improve performance. Examples of aerobic exercise are running, cycling, and swimming. During the study of \nFIG. 12\n, mice were challenged by aerobic exercise (forced swimming) for 90 mins twice daily. The animals were accustomed to swimming in preliminary training sessions: day −3 twice 30 mins, day −2 twice 45 mins, day −1 twice 60 mins, \nday\n 0 and following twice 90 mins. Mice were then exercised for 1, 7, or 21 additional, consecutive days for 90 mins twice daily. Between swimming sessions separated by a 4 hour rest period the mice are kept warm and given food and water. An adjustable-current water pool was used to exercise mice by swimming. An acrylic pool (90 cm long×45 cm wide×45 cm deep) filled with water to a depth of 25 cm was used. A current in the pool was generated with a pump. The current speed during the swimming session was at a constant speed of 1 l/min flow rate. The water temperature was maintained at 34° C. with an electric heater. Age- and weight-matched mice were used to exclude differences in buoyancy from body fat.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsing forced swimming as an efficient protocol to increase skeletal muscle aerobic capacity in mice, the composition and phosphorylation status of the skeletal RyR1 channel complex have been investigated. Unexpectedly, after 3 weeks of 90 mins swimming twice daily, C57B16 wild-type mice showed significantly increased RyR1 phosphorylation by PKA while Ca\n2+\n-calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) phosphorylation was not changed indicating specificity of the stress pathway RyR1 protein expression was stable, however, RyR1 channels were depleted of the stabilizing subunit calstabin1 (FKBP12). It has been shown that RyR1 hyperphosphorylation and calstabin1 depletion are consistent with leaky RyR1 channels that cause intracellular SR Ca\n2+\n leak.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRyR1 channels are PKA hyperphosphorylated and depleted of the stabilizing calstabin1 subunit after 3 weeks of 90 mins swimming twice daily. As seen in Embodiment A, the immunoprecipitated RyR1 macromolecular channel complex shows increased PKA phosphorylation at Ser-2844 (corresponding to human RyR1-Ser-2843) whereas CaMKII phosphorylation at Ser-2849 (corresponding to human RyR1-Ser-2848) is unchanged. Concomitant with increased RyR1-Ser-2844 PKA hyperphosphorylation, calstabin1 is depleted from the channel complex. As seen in embodiment B, normalization of phosphorylation and calstabin1 content to four subunits of the tetrameric channel complex shows a significant in increase in PKA phosphorylation and depletion of the stabilizing calstabin1 subunit. Control, non-exercised mice; swim, mice exercised 90 mins twice daily for 3 weeks (preliminary data). P<0.05.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 13\n, embodiments A and B, demonstrate that PKA phosphorylation increases for increasing durations of sustained exercise. To investigate the influence of the duration of sustained exercise on the RyR1 Ca\n2+\n release channel defect, mice were exposed to swimming for 1, 7, or 21 days followed by immediate sacrifice. Longer exposure to sustained exercise results in a significant increase of RyR1 PKA hyperphosphorylation beginning at 7 days and saturating at 21 days.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn \nFIG. 13\n, embodiment A, the immunoprecipitated RyR1 channel complex shows significantly and above physiologic levels increased PKA phosphorylation at Ser-2844 (corresponding to human RyR1-Ser-2843) after 7 days of swimming exercise. In \nFIG. 13\n, embodiment B, normalization of RyR2-Ser-2844 phosphorylation within the tetrameric channel complex documents a significant increase in PKA phosphorylation. *, P<0.05; **, P<0.005.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn summary, the data of \nFIG. 13\n shows that sustained exercise results in significantly increased RyR1 phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA) which contributes to depletion of the stabilizing calstabin1 subunit from the channel complex as the cause of a gain-of-function defect.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 14\n provides data showing that showing that chronically increased sympathetic stimulation of skeletal muscles, results in RyR1-dependent intracellular Ca\n2+\n leak and significantly increased muscle fatigue. As shown in \nFIG. 14\n for mice and rats with heart failure from myocardial infarction, chronic RyR1 PKA hyperphosphorylation results in increased muscle fatigue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn embodiment A, it can be seen that heart failure skeletal muscle fatigues earlier than control. Rat soleus muscle (n=5 control, n=8 HF) was mounted in a tissue bath to assess contractile function. Representative fatigue time tracing is shown for control and HF skeletal muscles. Bar graph shows mean (±S.D.) time to 40% fatigue. *, P<0.05. In embodiment B, it can be seen that heart failure skeletal muscle achieved maximal tetanic force more slowly than control skeletal muscles. Tetanic force was induced by high-frequency field stimulation. Bar graph shows tetanic 50% contraction time. **, P<0.01. Embodiment C demonstrates the correlation between time to fatigue and RyR1 PKA phosphorylation (r=0.88) in rat skeletal muscle from sham and heart failure animals. Muscle function and RyR1 PKA phosphorylation were assessed using contralateral soleus muscles from each animal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn summary, \nFIG. 14\n provides data showing that sustained exercise causes RyR1 PKA hyperphosphorylation and calstabin1 depletion, and \nFIG. 14\n shows that the identical defect occurs in disease forms with increased sympathetic activity causing intracellular SR Ca\n2+\n leak and significantly accelerated skeletal muscle fatigue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn additional problem during sustained exercise and stress is skeletal muscle degeneration further contributing to decreased skeletal muscle performance. To assess structural changes during sustained exercise, histologic changes in the fast-twitch muscles of mice exposed to 3 weeks of exercise by swimming have been characterized. Results are shown in \nFIG. 15\n. Cross-sections of the mouse M. extensor digitorum longus (EDL) showed histologic changes consistent with myofiber degeneration from intracellular Ca\n2+\n overload from defective RyR1 channels. Therefore sustained exercise for 90 mins twice daily triggers a dystrophic phenotype in EDL muscles of normal C57B16 mice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTrichrome stain shows packed myofibers of similar cross-sectional dimension in non-exercised control (WT) mice (left). Three weeks swimming results in myofiber degeneration and interstitial collagen deposits with irregular fiber sizes. Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) stain indicates nuclear changes and myofiber death. These changes are consistent with dystrophic remodeling.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe rapid delayed rectifier potassium channel (I(Kr)) is important for repolarization of the cardiac action potential. HERG is the pore-forming subunit of the I(Kr) channel. Suppression of I(Kr) function, for example as a side-effect of a drug or the result of a mutation in hERG, can lead to long-QT (LQT) syndrome, which is associated with increased risk of life-threatening arrhythmias. The compounds of the present invention exhibit a lower level of hERG blocking activity than JTV-519, as demonstrated in \nFIGS. 16-35\n. Thus, the compounds of the present invention are expected to be less toxic and/or exhibit fewer side effects than JTV-519.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIGS. 16 to 19\n illustrate the effect of the compound ARM036 (also referred to as S36) and ARM036-Na (a sodium salt of ARM036) on hERG currents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 16\n shows a typical hERG voltage-clamp current recording before (control) and after application of ARM036 at 100 μM. The voltage pulse protocol used to activate the hERG currents is illustrated below the current trace. It can be seen that, following activation by the conditioning prepulse (to +20 mV), partial repolarization (−50 mV test pulse) of the membrane evoked a large, slowly decaying outward tail current. Application of ARM036 minimally reduced the outward tail current in a concentration- and time-dependent manner.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 17\n shows a typical time course of the effect of ARM036 at 100 mM on the amplitude of the hERG channel current.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 18\n is a graph showing the concentration-dependence of the effect of ARM036 on the hERG current. Table 1 provides the numerical data that is illustrated graphically in \nFIG. 18\n.

Provided herein is a highly-efficient assay for high-throughput screening of other compounds that are capable of modulating calcium ion channel activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy way of example, and as shown in Example 5 below, a highly-efficient assay for high-throughput screening for small molecules is developed by immobilizing FKBP, either FKBP12 or FKBP12.6 (e.g., wild-type FKBP12.6 or a fusion protein, such as GST-FKBP12.6) onto a 96-well plate coated with glutathione, using standard procedures. PKA-phosphorylated ryanodine receptor (RyR), specifically RyR1 or RyR3 in the case of FKBP12 and RyR2 in the case of FKBP12.6, is loaded onto the FKBP-coated plate, and incubated with compounds at various concentrations (10-100 nM) for 30 min. Thereafter, the plate is washed to remove the unbound RyR, and then incubated with anti-RyR antibody (e.g., for 30 min). The plate is washed again to remove unbound anti-RyR antibody, and then treated with florescent-labeled secondary antibody. The plate is read by an automatic fluorescent plate reader for binding activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, RyR is PKA-phosphorylated in the presence of \n32\nP-ATP. Radioactive PKA-phosphorylated RyR is loaded onto an FKBP-coated, 96-well plate, in the presence of JTV-519 analogues and other compounds at various concentrations (10-100 nM) for 30 min. The plate is washed to remove the unbound radiolabeled RyR, and then read by an automatic plate reader. PKA-phosphorylated RyR also is coated to the plate, and incubated with \n32\nS-labeled FKBP in the presence of the compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention is described in the following Examples, which are set forth to aid in the understanding of the invention and should not be construed to limit in any way the scope of the invention as defined in the claims which follow thereafter.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nRyR2PKA Phosphorylation and FKBP12.6 Binding\n\n\n \n \n \nCardiac SR membranes are prepared, as previously described (Marx, et al., PKA phosphorylation dissociates FKBP12.6 from the calcium release channel (ryanodine receptor): defective regulation in failing hearts. \nCell, \n101:365-76, 2000; Kaftan, et al., Effects of rapamycin on ryanodine receptor/Ca\n(2+)\n-release channels from cardiac muscle. \nCirc. Res., \n78:990-97, 1996). \n35\nS-labelled FKBP12.6 was generated using the TNT™ Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation system from Promega (Madison, Wis.). [\n3\nH] ryanodine binding is used to quantify RyR2 levels. 100 μg of microsomes are diluted in 100 μl of 10-mM imidazole buffer (pH 6.8), incubated with 250-nM (final concentration) [\n35\nS]-FKBP12.6 at 37° C. for 60 min, then quenched with 500 μl of ice-cold imidazole buffer. Samples are centrifuged at 100,000 g for 10 min and washed three times in imidazole buffer. The amount of bound [\n35\nS]-FKBP12.6 is determined by liquid scintillation counting of the pellet.\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\nImmunoblots\n\n\n \n \n \nImmunoblotting of microsomes (50 μg) is performed as described, with anti-FKBP12/12.6 (1:1,000), anti-RyR-5029 (1:3,000) (Jayaraman, et al., FK506 binding protein associated with the calcium release channel (ryanodine receptor). \nJ. Biol. Chem., \n267:9474-77, 1992), or anti-phosphoRyR2-P2809 (1:5,000) for 1 h at room temperature (Reiken, et al., Beta-blockers restore calcium release channel function and improve cardiac muscle performance in human heart failure. \nCirculation, \n107:2459-66, 2003). The P2809-phosphoepitope-specific anti-RyR2 antibody is an affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit antibody, custom-made by Zymed Laboratories (San Francisco, Calif.) using the peptide, CRTRRI-(pS)-QTSQ, which corresponds to RyR2PKA-phosphorylated at Ser\n2809\n. After incubation with HRP-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (1:5,000 dilution; Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, Ky.), the blots are developed using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia, Piscataway, N.J.).\n\n\n \nExample 3\n\n\nSingle-Channel Recordings\n\n\n \n \n \nSingle-channel recordings of native RyR2 from mouse hearts, or recombinant RyR2, are acquired under voltage-clamp conditions at 0 mV, as previously described (Marx, et al., PKA phosphorylation dissociates FKBP12.6 from the calcium release channel (ryanodine receptor): defective regulation in failing hearts. \nCell, \n101:365-76, 2000). Symmetric solutions used for channel recordings are: trans compartment—HEPES, 250 mmol/L; Ba(OH)\n2\n, 53 mmol/L (in some experiments, Ba(OH)\n2 \nis replaced by Ca(OH)\n2\n); pH 7.35; and cis compartment—HEPES, 250 mmol/L; Tris-base, 125 mmol/L; EGTA, 1.0 mmol/L; and CaCl\n2\n, 0.5 mmol/L; pH 7.35. Unless otherwise indicated, single-channels recordings are made in the presence of 150-nM [Ca\n2+\n] and 1.0-mM [Mg\n2+\n] in the cis compartment. Ryanodine (5 mM) is applied to the cis compartment to confirm identity of all channels. Data is analyzed from digitized current recordings using Fetchan software (Axon Instruments, Union City, Calif.). All data is expressed as mean±SE. The unpaired Student's t-testis used for statistical comparison of mean values between experiments. A value of p<0.05 is considered statistically significant.\n\n\n \nExample 4\n\n\nHigh-Throughput Screening Method\n\n\n \n \n \nAssays for screening biologically-active small molecules have been developed. These assays are based on rebinding of FKBP12 protein to RyR.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA highly-efficient assay for high-throughput screening for small molecules is developed by immobilization of FKBP12.6 (GST-fusion protein) onto a 96-well plate coated with glutathione. PKA-phosphorylated ryanodine receptor type 2 (RyR2) is loaded onto the FKBP12.6-coated plate, and incubated with JTV-519 analogues at various concentrations (10-100 nM) for 30 min. Thereafter, the plate is washed to remove the unbound RyR2, and then incubated with anti-RyR2 antibody for 30 min. The plate is again washed to remove unbound anti-RyR2 antibody, and then treated with florescent-labeled secondary antibody. The plate is read by an automatic fluorescent plate reader for binding activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an alternative assay, RyR2 is PKA-phosphorylated in the presence of 32P-ATP. Radioactive PKA-phosphorylated RyR2 is loaded onto an FKBP12.6-coated, 96-well plate, in the presence of JTV-519 analogues at various concentrations (10-100 nM) for 30 min. The plate is washed to remove the unbound radiolabeled RyR2, and then read by an automatic plate reader.\n\n\n \nExample 5\n\n\nEffect of ARM036 Compounds on hERG Currents\n\n\n \n \n \nThe effects of the compounds of the invention on hERG currents were studied using cultured human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) cells which had been stably tranfected with hERG cDNA. HEK 293 cells do not express endogenous hERG. HEK293 cells were transfected with a plasmid containing the hERG cDNA and a neomycin resistance gene. Stable transfectants were selected by culturing the cells in the presence of G418. The selection pressure was maintained by continued culture in the presence of G418. Cells were cultures in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium/Nutreint Mizture F-12 (D-MEM/F-12) supplemented with 10% fetal bovin serum, 199 U/ml penicillin G sodium, 10 μg/mL streptomycin sulfate and 500 μg/mL G418. Cells for use in electrophysiology were cultured in 35 mm dishes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nElectrophysiological recordings (using the whole-cell patch clamp method) were performed at room temperature (18° C.-24° C.). Each cell acted as its own control. The effect of ARM0036 was evaluated at two concentrations: 10 and 100 μM. Each concentration was tested in at least three cells (n≧3). 90 nM Cisapride (commercially available from TOCRIS Bioscience) was used as a positive control for hERG blockade. For recording, cells were transferred to the recording chamber and superfused with vehicle control solution. The patch pipette solution for whole cell recording contained 130 mM potassium aspartate, 5 mM MgCl\n2\n, 5 mM EGTA, 4 mM ATP and 10 mM HEPES. The pH was adjusted to 7.2 with KOH. The pipette solution was prepared in batches, aliquoted, and stored frozen. A fresh aliquot was thawed and used each day. Patch pipettes were made from glass capillary tubing using a P-97 micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments, Novato, Calif.). A commercial patch clamp amplifier was used for whole cell recordings. Before digitization, current records were low-pass filtered at one-fifth of the sampling frequency.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOnset and steady state block of hERG current was measured using a pulse pattern with fixed amplitudes (conditioning prepulse: +20 mV for 2 seconds; test pulse: −50 mV for 2 seconds) repeated at 10 second intervals, from a holding potential of −80 mV. Peak tail current was measured during the 2 second step to −50 mV. A steady state was maintained for at least 30 seconds before applying the test compound or the positive control. Peak tail current was monitored until a new steady state was achieved. Test compound concentrations were applied cumulatively in ascending order without washout between applications.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nData acquisition and analysis was performed using the suite of pCLAMP (Vre. 8.2) programs (Axon Instruments, Union City, Calif.). Steady state was defined by the limiting constant rate of change with time (linear time dependence). The steady state before and after application of the test or control compounds was used to calculate the percentage of current inhibited at each concentration. Concentration-response data were fit to an equation of the form:\n\n\n \n \n \n% Block={1−1/[Test]/IC\n50\n)\nN]}×\n100\n\n\n\n \n \nwhere [Test] is the concentration of the test compound, IC\n50 \n(inhibitory concentration 50) is the concentration of the test compound producing half-maximal inhibition, N is the Hill coefficient, and % Block is the percentage of hERG current inhibited at each concentration of the test compound. Nonlinear squares fits were solved with the Solver add-in for Excel 2000 (Microsoft, Redmond, Wash.). For some compounds it was not possible to determine the IC\n50 \nbecause the highest concentration of the test compound used did not block the hERG channel by 50% or more.\n\n\n \nExample 6\n\n\nEffect of Various Compounds on hERG Currents\n\n\n \n \n \nMultiple compounds of the invention were tested for their effects on hERG currents. The compounds tested were: ARM036-Na, ARM047, ARM048, ARM050, ARM057, ARM064, ARM074, ARM075, ARM076, ARM077, ARM101, ARM102, ARM103, ARM104, ARM106, ARM107 and ARM26. By way of comparison, the effect of JTV-519 (referred to in the figures as “ARM00X”) on hERG currents was also tested. Electrophysiological recordings were made using the PatchXpress 7000 A (Molecular Devices) automatic parallel patch clamp system. Each compound was tested at 0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10 mM, with each concentration tested in 2 cells (n>2). The duration of exposure to each test concentration was 5 minutes. Other aspects of the experimental protocols were essentially similar to those described in Example 5. For some compounds it was not possible to determine the IC\n50 \nbecause the highest concentration of the test compound used did not block the hERG channel by 50% or more.\n\n\n \nExample 7\n\n\nEffect of S36\n\n\n \n \n \nThe RyCal compounds referred to as S36, S107 were synthesized as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIGS. 36-41\n show some aspects of the molecular mechanisms which lead to muscle fatigue and the effect of S36 on muscle fatigue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDrug Delivery: Eight-week-old, wild-type, weight-matched, C57BL/6J littermate mice were randomized to either S36 or vehicle treatment. On day −2, osmotic infusion pumps (\nAlzet Model\n 2004, 200 μl total volume, 0.25 μl/hr delivery, Durect, Cupertino, Calif.) filled with either 200 ul of PBS or 200 μl of S36 (10 μg/ul diluted in PBS) were implanted subcutaneously on the dorsal surface of the mice by a horizontal incision just behind the neck. Mice were allowed to recover for three days prior to the initiation of exercise. Standard food and water were provided ad libitum.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExercise Protocols: Beginning on \nday\n 1, mice were exercised for three weeks by swimming 5 days/week and by running on a treadmill an additional 1 day/week.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSwimming Model: The daily swimming protocol consisted of swimming sessions twice-daily separated by one-hour rest periods. After an initial conditioning regimen lasting 5 days during which the swimming sessions were increased in 10 minute increments from 40 minutes each to 80 minutes each, the swimming sessions thereafter lasted 90 minutes each. A 30 cm wide by 30 cm long opaque acrylic tank was filled with tap water to a depth of at least 20 cm. Water was circulated and warmed to 32-34 degrees C. using a separate reservoir with heating element, thermostat, and pump. Compressed room air was bubbled from Tygon tubing with small needle holes placed at the bottom of the tank to agitate the water surface. 4 mice, matched pair-wise with respect to treatment group, swam at any one time in the tank. Littermates who did not exercise were reserved as negative controls.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to track the swimming activity of each individually identified mouse, a video tracking system was used (San Diego Instruments, San Diego, Calif.), which includes Sony CCD video recorder, DVD/Hard Drive, frame grabber card, and custom SMART 2.0 software with Social Behavior package capable of tracking up to 8 mice simultaneously under ideal conditions.) Mice were anesthetized by using 1.5% isoflurane in O\n2\n, and small, 0.75 cm, Velcro coins were sutured with 5-0 nylon suture to the scalp of each mouse. Plastic 1 cm colored dots, glued to the hook side of the Velcro, could be securely attached to the mouse and used for multiple subject tracking under appropriate lighting conditions. Each resultant mouse track in x,y, and time was analyzed and mean velocities, and distance swam over 2, 5, and 10 minute intervals was obtained.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTreadmill running: A Columbus Instruments (Columbus, Ohio) treadmill (Model: Exer-6M Treadmill with Treadmill Shock Detection Unit) with 6 lanes was used to run the mice. Mice were placed in their respective lanes at the lowest speed (7 meters/min) with the shocking apparatus turned off and allowed to adjust to the surroundings for 6 minutes. The forward half of the treadmill was covered with aluminum foil to block out light. A desk lamp illuminated the shocking area at the rear of the treadmill. After the adjustment period, the electric current was turned on, and the number of shocks delivered during the next two three minute intervals (training period) were recorded. The shock counter was then reset, the speed was increased to 10 m/min, and visits to the shocking area and shocks delivered to each mouse were recorded at three-minute intervals until the end of the experiment. At regular intervals, the speed of the treadmill was ramped up from the initial 10 m/min to as high as 36 m/min. The speed was increased no more than 2 m/min every 6 minutes. Consistent treadmill speed increases were used for all mice on a given day, but the protocol increased in difficulty over the course of the 21 day experiment. Task failure was defined when a mouse could not continue running to avoid the shocking area and gave up or when the mouse had received 200 cumulative shocks. In nearly all cases, these two times were very close to identical.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMuscle Isolation: Following the 21\nst \nand 22\nnd \nday of exercise, mice were swum a final time on a staggered schedule. Following 90 minutes of swimming, each mouse was immediately sacrificed by carbon dioxide inhalation and cervical dislocation. Blood was removed by intracardiac aspiration, spun down, and plasma was eluted and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Both extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles were exposed, moistened with Tyrode's solution, and 4-0 silk sutures were tied to the proximal and distal tendons and the muscles were dissected free. The muscles were perfused with Tyrode's solution containing 2.0 mM CaCl\n2\n, bubbled with 100% O\n2\n, warmed to 35 C, and hung on isometric force transducers (F-30, Harvard Apparatus, Cambridge, Mass.). After equilibration for 10 minutes at a resting tension of 1 cN and a brief potentiation protocol, force-frequency relationships were measured, with 60 second delays between 800 ms stimulations at 40-150 Hz. Fatigue was produced with a protocol of 50 Hz tetani (each 600 ms long) every 2 seconds for 120 seconds. DMC v4.1.6 (Aurora Scientific, Canada) was used to stimulate and record muscle responses, and DMA v3.2 (Aurora Scientific, Canada) was used to analyze the resultant data.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing stimulation, muscle length was determined at the resting tension, and muscle dry weight was recorded. One EDL muscle was frozen in isopentane (−80° C.) for histology and the other was frozen in liquid N\n2 \nfor biochemistry.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, both soleus muscles were dissected and likewise one was frozen in isopentane for histology and one was frozen in liquid N\n2 \nfor biochemical analysis. The vastus lateralis, heart, and diaphragm were also dissected from each animal and frozen in liquid N\n2 \nfor biochemical analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBiochemistry: RyR channels were immunoprecipitated from skeletal muscle homogenates with anti-RyR antibody in 0.5 ml of buffer (50 mM Tris HCl buffer, pH 7.4 0.9% NaCl 5.0 mM NaF 1.0 mM Na\n3\nVO\n4 \n0.5% Triton X-100+protease inhibitors) for 1 hour at 4° C. The samples were incubated with protein A Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia) at 4° C. for 1 h, after which the beads were washed three times with buffer. Proteins were separated on SDS PAGE gels (6% for RyR2 and 15% for calstabin2) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes overnight (SemiDry transfer blot, Bio-Rad). After incubation with 5% nonfat milk to prevent non-specific antibody binding and a wash in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20, membranes were incubated for 1-2 h at room temperature with primary antibodies anti-calstabin (1:1,000), anti-RyR (5029; 1:5,000), or anti-phospho-RyR2-pSer2809 (1:5,000), which detects PKA-phosphorylated mouse RyR1-pSer2844 and RyR2-pSer2808. After three washes, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (1:5,000, Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, Ky.), and developed with an enhanced chemiluminescent detection system (Amersham Pharmacia). Band densities were quantified by using QUANTITY ONE software (Bio-Rad).\n\n\n \nExample 8\n\n\nEffect of S107\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFIGS. 42-55\n show molecular mechanisms of muscle fatigue and the effect of S107.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDrug Delivery Eight-week-old, weight-matched, C57BL/6J littermate mice were randomized to dosing with either S107 or vehicle (H\n2\nO). On day −3 of each trial, osmotic pumps (Alzet Model 2004, 200 ul total volume, 0.25 ul/hr delivery, Durect, Cupertino, Calif.) filled with either 200 ul of PBS or 200 ul of S107 (10 ug/ul diluted in H\n2\nO) were implanted subcutaneously on the dorsal surface of each mouse by a horizontal incision on the neck. Mice were allowed to recover for three days prior to the initiation of exercise. Standard food and water were provided ad libitum through the experiment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChronic Exercise Model: The daily swimming protocol consisted of twice-daily swimming sessions separated by a one-hour rest period. After an initial conditioning regimen lasting 5 days during which the swimming sessions were increased in 10 minute increments from 40 minutes each to 80 minutes each, the swimming sessions thereafter lasted 90 minutes each. A 30 cm wide by 30 cm long opaque acrylic tank was filled with tap water to a depth of at least 20 cm. Water was circulated and warmed to 32-34° C. using a separate reservoir with heating element, thermostat, and pump. 8 mice, balanced pair-wise with respect to genotype and/or treatment group, swam at any one time in the tank. Littermates who did not exercise were reserved as sedentary controls.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to confirm that uniform exercise conditions were achieved, pilot experiments were performed in which the motion of each individually identified mouse was tracked with a video tracking system (San Diego Instruments, San Diego, Calif.). Individual recorded tracks over the full 90 minutes of each swim were analyzed for distance swam, mean velocities over time, etc. using the SMART 2.0 software with Social Behavior package (San Diego Instruments). No significant differences in the degree of exercise were noted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTreadmill performance: A Columbus Instruments (Columbus, Ohio) treadmill (Model: Exer-6M Treadmill with Treadmill Shock Detection Unit) with 6 lanes was used to run the mice. Mice were placed in their respective lanes with the shocking apparatus turned off and allowed to adjust to the surroundings for 10 minutes. The forward half of the treadmill was covered with aluminum foil to block out light and a desk lamp illuminated the shocking area at the rear of the treadmill. After the adjustment period, the treadmill was set to 10 meters/min, and the mice were trained to run with gentle prodding for 6 minutes. The electric current was then turned on, and the number of shocks delivered during the next two three minute intervals (training period) were recorded. The shock counter was then reset and visits to the shocking area and shocks delivered to each mouse were recorded at three-minute intervals until the end of the experiment. At regular intervals, the speed of the treadmill was ramped up from the initial 10 m/min to 24 m/min. The speed was increased no more than 2 m/min every 6 minutes. Task failure was defined when a mouse could not continue running despite gentle prodding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntact muscle preparation: Immediately following a forced exercise session, each mouse was sacrificed by carbon dioxide inhalation and cervical dislocation. Blood was removed by intracardiac aspiration, spun down, and plasma was eluted and frozen in liquid nitrogen. 4-0 silk sutures were tied to the proximal and distal tendons of intact EDL and soleus muscles and the muscles were dissected free and placed in a modified Ringer's solution (140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2.0 mM CaCl\n2\n, 2 mM MgCl\n2\n, 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM glucose, pH 7.4) bubbled with 100% O\n2\n. Muscles were hung vertically in 50 mL Radnoti jacketed glass chambers with one tendon attached with 4-0 silk suture to an isometric force transducer (F30, Harvard Apparatus, Cambridge, Mass.) and the other tendon attached by suture to a stationary arm with built in platinum stimulating plate electrodes. After perfusion with 35C Ringer's and equilibration for 10 minutes at a resting tension of 1 cN and a brief potentiation protocol, force-frequency relationships were measured, with 60 second delays between 800 ms stimulations at 40-150 Hz. DMCv4.1.6 (Aurora Scientific, Canada) was used to stimulate and record muscle responses, and DMA v3.2 (Aurora Scientific, Canada) was used to analyze the resultant data. Following stimulation, muscle length was determined at resting tension, and muscle dry weight was recorded.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConfocal microscopy: Single flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) fibers were enzymatically dissociated by standard methods (Reiken, Lacampagne et al. 2003). Briefly, the muscle was dissected from the paw, placed in a modified Ringer's solution, and stripped of all fascia. \nType\n 1 collagenase-(2 mg/ml, Sigma) in Ringer's solution was prepared fresh, and the muscle was digested for 2 hours at 37° C. in a incubator shaking at 125 rpm. The muscle was placed in fresh Ringer's and gently triturated. Single fibers were collected and allowed to attach to glass coverslips coated in laminin (Sigma L-2020). The cells were loaded with 2 μM fluo-4-AM ester (Invitrogen) for 20 minutes, placed on the \nZeiss Live\n 5 microscope stage and superfused for 15 minutes with Ringer's. The fibers were paced at 1 Hz for 10 minutes prior to imaging baseline fiber properties. Linescan images were continuously acquired at 1 ms scan rate during a tetanic sequence consisting of 300 ms stimulation at 100 Hz with a 2 Hz train rate. Images were analyzed in ImageJ, and an F/F0 ratio was calculated for each fiber.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHuman Exercise Protocol: Three weeks prior to test sessions, subjects reported to the Human Performance Laboratory at Appalachian State University for baseline measurements of cardiorespiratory fitness and body composition. On three consecutive test session days, subjects ate a standardized breakfast (7-8:00 am) and lunch (completed by 12:30 pm), and then reported to the ASU Human Performance Laboratory at 2:00 pm. Subjects exercised on exercise bikes at 70% VO\n2max \nfrom 3:00-6:00 pm. Test sessions days were Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday afternoons. Oxygen consumption and other metabolic parameters were measured using a metabolic cart (with a mouthpiece and noseclip) every 30 minutes, and blood lactate and glucose (via finger stick) every 60 minutes to verify that subjects were adhering to the prescribed exercise workloads. Subjects ingested 0.5-1.0 liters water every hour of exercise while avoiding all forms of ingested energy (e.g., bars, drinks). Resting control subjects sat in the laboratory during the exercise test sessions. Blood, urine, and saliva samples were collected 15-30 minutes before exercise/sitting, and then within 5-10 minutes post-exercise on each of the 3 test sessions. Muscle biopsy samples were obtained 15-30 minutes before exercise/sitting, and then within 5-10 minutes post-exercise using a needle biopsy procedure on \n \nDays\n \n 1 and 3. Four samples were taken (two from each thigh), about 2 inches apart. Biopsies were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSingle channel recording and data acquisition: SR vesicles from skeletal muscle of sedentary mice and mice chronically exercised and treated either with vehicle or S107 were prepared as described previously (Reiken, Lacampagne et al. 2003). RyR1 channels were reconstituted by spontaneous fusion of microsomes into the planar lipid bilayer (a mixture of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine in a 3:1 ratio, Avanti Polar Lipids). Planar lipid bilayers were formed across a 200 μm aperture in a polysulfonate cup (Warner Instruments, Inc.), which separated two bathing solutions (1 mM EGTA, 250/125 mM HEPES/Tris, 50 mM KCl, 0.5 mM CaCl\n2\n, pH 7.35 as cis solution and 53 mM Ba(OH)\n2\n, 50 mM KCl, 250 mM HEPES, pH 7.35 as trans solution). After incorporation, RyR1 channel activity was recorded continuously for at least 10 minutes. The concentration of free Ca\n2+\n in the cis chamber was calculated with WinMaxC program (version 2.50) (Bers, Patton et al. 1994). Single channel currents were recorded at 0 mV using the Axopatch 200A patch-clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, USA) in gap-free mode, filtered at 1 kHz, and digitized at 10 kHz. Data acquisition was performed using Digidata 1322A and \nAxoscope\n 9 software (Axon Instruments, USA). The recordings were analyzed using Clampfit 10.1 (Molecular Devices, USA) and Origin software (ver. 6.0, Microcal Software, Inc., USA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalysis of Ryanodine Receptor Complex: 10 mg muscle samples were isotonically lysed. The ryanodine receptor (RyR1) was immunoprecipitated by incubating 250 μg of homogenate with anti-RyR antibody (2 μl 5029 Ab) in 0.5 ml of a modified RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 0.9% NaCl, 5.0 mM NaF, 1.0 mM Na\n3\nVO\n4\n, 0.5% Triton-X100, and protease inhibitors) for 1 hr at 4° C. The samples were incubated with protein A Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia) at 4° C. for 1 h, after which the beads were washed three times with buffer. Proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE gels (4-20% gradient) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes overnight (SemiDry transfer blot, Bio-Rad). After incubation with blocking solution (LICOR Biosciences, Lincoln Nebr.) to prevent non-specific antibody binding and a wash in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20, membranes were incubated for 1-2 h at room temperature with primary antibodies anti-calstabin (1:2500 in blocking buffer), anti-RyR (5029, 1:5,000), or anti-phospho-RyR2-pSer2809 (1:5000), which detects PKA-phosphorylated mouse RyR1-pSer2844 and RyR2-pSer2808, anti-PDE4D3 (1:1000). After three washes, membranes were incubated with infrared labeled secondary antibodies (1:10,000 dilution, LICOR Biosystems). Band densities were quantified using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LICOR Biosciences).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCalpain and Creatine Kinase Assays: Tissue calpain activities were measured using a calpain activity assay kit (Calbiochem, San Diego, Calif.) (\nFIG. 42B\n). This assay is based on the degradation of the fluorescent peptide substrate Suc-LLVY-AMC (Calbiochem). Muscle homogenates were diluted to a final concentration of 600 μg/ml and the calpain activity in the homogenate was determined as per manufactures instructions. Plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity was assayed using the regent kit from Pointe Scientific, Inc. (Canton, Mich.) (\nFIG. 42A\n). Plasma samples (duplicates, 5 μl each) were added to 200 μl of CK reagent and the change in absorbance at 340 nM was recorded over 4 minutes using a plate reader. The average absorbance change per minute was used to determine the CPK levels as per manufacturer's instructions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStatistics: Data are presented as mean±SEM. Independent t-test with a significance level of 0.05 was employed to test differences between cal1−/− and WT, PDE4D−/− and WT, and Ex+veh and Ex+S107, except as noted below. The distributions of treadmill failure data were found in several cases to be asymmetric. As such, Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used for all such data comparisons.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHigh intensity exercise induces RyR1 PKA hyperphosphorylation, and depletion of calstabin1 and PDE4D3 from the channel complex: Exercise models in the mouse have been grouped into two categories: 1) voluntary exercise including running wheels; and 2) involuntary exercise, including swimming or forced treadmill runs to exhaustion. In order to achieve high intensity exercise, a twice daily swimming protocol was adapted to achieve uniform exercise in mice over days to weeks. This mouse exercise protocol was not designed to be either explicitly eccentric or isometric in character, but rather a physiologic mix of eccentric and isometric exercise. Following forced exercise, RyR1 was immunoprecipitated out of whole muscle homogenates from hind limb muscles, and the RyR1 channel complex was size-fractionated on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for channel complex components. High-intensity exercise in the mouse resulted in progressive phosphorylation of RyR1 at the PKA site Ser2844 (RyR1-pS2844) that saturated by 14 days of twice daily swimming (90 min sessions, e.g. \nFIG. 43A\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, the RyR1 macromolecular complex from extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle underwent remodeling, including depletion of calstabin1 and PDE4D3 from the channel by day 14 (\nFIGS. 43A and 43B\n). An identical pattern of biochemical changes was seen in all other hind limb skeletal muscles isolated from the same mice, including soleus, tibialis anterior, and gastrocnemius. RyR1 PKA hyperphosphorylation and depletion of calstabin1 and PDE4D3 were dependent on the intensity of the exercise, with only relatively high intensity exercise resulting in significant channel modifications (\nFIGS. 43C and 43D\n). Furthermore, the remodeling of the RyR1 channel complex persisted after exercise and recovered only partially following three days of rest after chronic exercise (\nFIG. 51A\n). PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR1 was not due to changes in the amount of PKA and PP1 bound the RyR1 complex, as these levels were not affected by exercise conditions (\nFIGS. 51A and 51B\n). \nCalstabin\n 1 levels in whole muscle homogenate, measured by immunoblot, were not altered during exercise (\nFIG. 51C\n). Thus, intense daily exercise, over weeks causes remodeling of the RyR1 channel complex manifested by depletion of the phosphodiesterase PDE4D3 from the channel, PKA hyperphosphorylation, and depletion of the stabilizing subunit calstabin1 from the RyR1 channel complex.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRyR1 channel defects occur during human exercise: To assess whether the remodeling of the RyR1 channel macromolecular complex observed in exercised mice is relevant to human physiology, human thigh muscle biopsies were obtained from trained athletes before and after exercise on \n \nDays\n \n 1 and 3 of a high-intensity exercise protocol (\ncycling\n 3 hr/day at 57% of VO\n2\nmax) (Nieman, Henson et al. 2006). The human RyR1 macromolecular complex was immunoprecipitated from muscle homogenate, size fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted to assess RyR1 PKA phosphorylation and levels of calstabin1 and PDE4D3 in the RyR1 complex. High intensity exercise resulted in PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR1 and calstabin1 depletion compared to controls who did not exercise (\nFIG. 44\n). Prior to exercise on \nDay\n 3, PKA phosphorylation of RyR1 in the trained cyclists was at or near resting levels and no significant calstabin1 depletion from the RyR1 complex was observed, however, PDE4D3 was stably depleted from the RyR1 complex by the beginning of the third day of the high intensity exercise (\nFIG. 44B\n). Thus, the same remodeling of the RyR1 channel complex observed in chronically exercised mice occurs in highly trained athletes subjected to intense exercise.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMuscle-specific calstabin1−/− mice have a high-intensity exercise defect: Muscle-specific deficiency of calstabin1 has been previously shown to be associated with alterations in the force-frequency relationships of isolated muscle preparations and a reduction in Cav1.1 current (Tang, Ingalls et al. 2004). To determine if calstabin1 binding to RyR1 has an effect on exercise performance, we assessed treadmill run to exhaustion times in mice with muscle-specific deficiency of calstabin1 (cal1−/−). There was a significant defect in the high intensity exercise capacity of cal1−/− mice compared to WT littermate controls (\nFIG. 45A\n). The exercise defect was similar in both males and females (\nFIG. 45B\n), and despite a small reduction in the body weights of the cal1−/− mice (\nFIG. 45C\n), there was no correlation between failure time and reduced body weight (\nFIG. 45D\n). The exercise defect was most apparent in high intensity exercise (treadmill speeds equal to or greater than 24 m/min) or in eccentric exercise such as 14 degree downhill treadmill runs. 0/2 cal1−/− mice were able to complete a 30 min downhill treadmill exercise protocol while 2/2 WT littermates were able to complete the protocol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwenty-four hours following a downhill exercise regimen (as described herein), plasma creatine kinase (CPK), was elevated consistent with increased muscle damage in the cal1−/− mice compared to WT littermate controls (\nFIG. 45E\n). Following several weeks of daily exercise training, the exercise capacity of WT mice approached that of cal1−/− presumably because of the progressive depletion of calstabin1 from the RyR1 complex that occurs with chronic exercise in WT mice (\nFIG. 43\n) resulting in an exercised-induced depletion of calstabin1 from the RyR1 channel complex that is comparable to that observed prior to exercise in the cal1−/− mice (\nFIG. 45F\n). Thus, muscle-specific calstabin1 deficient mice exhibit enhanced fatigue consistent with depletion of calstabin1 from the RyR1 complex playing a role in muscle fatigue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPDE4D −/− mice exhibit an exercise defect: Global deficiency of PDE4D results in an age-dependent progressive cardiomyopathy (Lehnart, Wehrens et al. 2005). Prior to the age of three months, however, PDE4D−/− mice exhibit no cardiac defect as determined by echocardiogram or cardiac catheterization. The exercise capacity of 2 month-old PDE4D−/− mice was compared with their WT littermates. A significant reduction in exercise capacity was observed (\nFIG. 46A\n) without any correlation with body weight (FIG. \n46\nB,C,D). Remarkably, CPK levels were increased, consistent with muscle damage at rest, in PDE4D−/− mice relative to WT littermate controls, and there was a significant increase in \nCPK levels\n 24 hours following a single episode of eccentric exercise consisting of thirty minutes of downhill treadmill running (\nFIG. 46E\n) in PDE4D−/− mice. PDE4D−/− mice exhibited an absence of RyR1 bound PDE4D3, a small increase in basal RyR1 PKA phosphorylation, and a significant increase in calstabin1 depletion following only a single day of mild exercise (\nFIG. 46F\n). These data show that PDE4D3 plays a significant role in the RyR1 complex by regulating the extent of PKA phosphorylation of RyR1 and that depletion of PDE4D3 from the channel complex during exercise promotes PKA phosphorylation of RyR1 which in turn contributes to muscle damage and skeletal muscle fatigue during exercise.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmacologic rebinding of calstabin1 to RyR1 improves chronic exercise performance: Having demonstrated that a deficiency of calstabin1 is associated with an exercise defect and that chronic or high intensity exercise can result in calstabin1 depletion from RyR1, the effect on chronic or high intensity exercise performance of pharmacologic rebinding of calstabin1 to RyR1 was determined. 1,4-benzothiazepine derivatives, RyCal compounds, were screened to identify compounds with increased target activity, improved specificity (absence of activity against other known ion channels) and in vivo efficacy in terms of improved exercise capacity. Compound S107 at a concentration of 500 nM was found not to affect L-type calcium channel current or hERG potassium current.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAge and sex-matched WT mice were randomized to receive osmotic pumps containing either S107 or vehicle. Dosing with S107 at 2.5 ug/hr or vehicle was initiated four days prior to the beginning of a 21-day forced swimming exercise protocol. Exercise capacity was assessed once a week by a level treadmill run to exhaustion during the nocturnal cycle of the mouse. The mice were not exercised on the same day as treadmill assessments. \nFIG. 47A\n shows that calstabin1 rebinding with S107 had no acute effect on WT exercise performance, but that over time the S107 treated WT mice were relatively protected against a decline in treadmill exercise capacity that occurred in vehicle treated mice (p<0.05 Wilcoxon rank test, S107 vs. vehicle at Day 21). These studies are complicated by the training effect of repeated exercise which leads to improved performance due to enhanced musculature. Individual treadmill failure times on \nDay\n 21 are shown in \nFIG. 47B\n. Isometric force production was measured in EDL muscles in a tissue bath during field stimulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEDL muscles from S107 treated mice showed increased force production at stimulation frequencies greater than 80 Hz consistent with a left-shift of the force-frequency relationship (\nFIG. 47C\n). Drug treatment did not result in a change in body weight (\nFIG. 47D\n) or muscle weight. In parallel chronic exercise trials with mice deficient in calstabin1, S107 failed to improve treadmill performance (\nFIG. 47E\n). The chronic exercise protocol resulted in substantial PKA phosphorylation of RyR1 and calstabin1 depletion from immunoprecipitated RyR1. Calstabin1 depletion from RyR1 was nearly entirely reversed by S107 treatment (\nFIG. 47F\n). Taken together these data show that preventing the SR Ca\n2+\n leak due to PKA hyperphosphorylated RyR1 channel with a drug that enhances calstabin1 binding to the channel can protect against muscle damage, muscle fatigue, enhance muscle function and improve exercise performance during fatigue protocols.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReduced fatiguability in calstabin1 rebound FDB muscle fibers: Flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) muscle fibers were enzymatically dissociated from mice following the chronic exercise protocol and loaded with the calcium indicator fluo-4. Individual muscle fibers were imaged on a Zeiss Live5 confocal microscope during field stimulation at 1 Hz and during a fatiguing protocol consisting of repeated 300 ms long 120 Hz tetani every 2 seconds for 400 seconds. Representative F/F0 traces during the fatigue protocol are shown for a FDB fiber isolated from a vehicle treated mouse (\nFIG. 48A\n) and a S107 treated mouse (\nFIG. 48B\n). FDB fibers from S107 treated mice exhibited a delayed decline in peak tetanic calcium transients (\nFIG. 48C\n). It is known that muscle fibers with slower kinetics of Ca\n2+\n release and reuptake are less prone to fatigue. The kinetics of Ca\n2+\n release and reuptake during single twitches at 1 Hz were assessed. The distribution of 50% reuptake times (tau) showed no significant differences between vehicle and S107 treatment (\nFIG. 52\n), indicating no shift in the calcium reuptake kinetics of the FDB fibers. These data indicate that treatment with S107 improves Ca\n2+\n handling in muscle fibers during fatigue protocols.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChronic exercise results in leaky RyR1 Channels which can be reversed by calstabin1 rebinding: A critical issue is whether the biochemical changes in the RyR1 macromolecular complex identified during exercise result in changes in RyR1 channel activity. To address this directly, SR microsomes were prepared from the hind limb muscle of sedentary mice, mice chronically exercised and treated with vehicle, and mice chronically exercised and treated with S107. Using standard techniques, vesicles were fused to planar lipid bilayers and the single channel activity of incorporated RyR1 channels was continuously measured for at least 10 minutes at 90 nM [Ca\n2+\n]\ncis \n(\nFIG. 49A\n). In agreement with previously published data (Meissner, 1994, Reiken, 2003), the activity of RyR1 from sedentary mice at resting calcium concentrations was very low resulting in a small number of openings over long period of time (in some experiments as long as 20 min of recording was necessary to calculate an open probability for the channel). In contrast, RyR1 channels from mice chronically exercised and treated with vehicle displayed increased activity with significantly higher open probabilities (p<0.005, Ex+veh, n=9 vs sedentary, n=9) due to an increased frequency of openings (\nFIG. 49B\n). Administration of S107 caused a significant decrease of RyR1 open probability (p<0.005, Ex+S107, n=12 vs Ex+veh, n=9) to a level comparable to that observed in channels from sedentary mice. Neither chronic exercise nor S107 had any effect on the duration of the channel dwell times meaning that observed changes in open probability were due to changes in the number of opening events (\nFIG. 49B\n). These data show that RyR1 channels from exercised animals exhibit “leaky” channel behavior (increased open probability) and that channels from animals treated with S107 were not\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReduced calpain activation in muscle tissue and reduced muscle tissue damage due to calstabin1 rebinding: One possible mechanism by which calcium released by leaky RyR1 channels impairs exercise performance is the activation of a member of the calpain family of Ca\n2+\n-dependent neutral proteases, which are known to be responsible for muscle damage in a number of pathophysiological states. (Belcastro 1993; Berchtold, Brinkmeier et al. 2000). Calpain activity in muscle homogenates was assessed by means of the degradation of the synthetic calpain substrate Suc-LLVY-AMC, which fluoresces upon cleavage by calpain. Chronically exercised EDL muscle exhibited elevated calpain activity compared to sedentary controls. Calpain activity was significantly reduced in S107 treated and chronically exercised mice (\nFIG. 50A\n). Evidence of a protection from muscle damage was further provided by measurement of plasma CPK activity levels which were elevated in the chronically exercised mice, but reduced close to the levels observed in sedentary controls in the S107 treated mice (\nFIG. 50B\n). Muscle histology showed evidence of muscle hypertrophy with some inflammation and scattered loci of damaged fibers in the chronically exercise mice, without evidence of extensive necrosis in either treatment group.\n\n\n \nExample 9\n\n\nMuscular Dystrophy and Effects of S107\n\n\n \n \n \nRyR1 calcium release channels become PKA hyperphosphorylated and depleted of the stabilizing protein calstabin1 during exercise. The compounds of the invention increase the binding affinity of calstabin1 to PKA hyperphosphorylated RyR1. These compounds (referred to as called “calcium channel stabilizers” or “rycal”) are 1,4-benzothiazepines and derivatives thereof. Treatment with these compounds improves exercise performance of mice running on a treadmill. A calcium leak via PKA hyperphoshorylated RyR1 channels causes muscle damage due to activation of calcium-dependent proteases and rycals prevent the calcium leak and inhibit muscle damage during chronic exercise. Rycals can be used to improve muscle fatigue in chronic diseases including heart failure, AIDS, cancer, renal failure, and can also be used to treat muscular dystrophies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDuchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked muscle disease characterized by mutations in the dystrophin gene. Increased calcium-activated calpain proteolysis in the sarcolemma membrane is thought to be a primary mechanism in the pathophysiology of DMD. The mdx mouse, carrying a stop codon inside exon 23 of the dystrophin gene, provides a useful system to study the effectiveness of different therapeutic strategies for the cure of this disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA RyCal compound, S107, reduces calpain activity in mdx mice during exercise. \nFIGS. 42\n, \n53\n, \n54\n, \n55\n provide data from these studies. This indicates that RyCals may be useful for treating muscle related diseases, including, but not limited to, muscular dystrophies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnimal Model: Mdx mice (21 days old) were treated with S107 (0.125 mg/kg/h) or vehicle using implantable, osmotic pumps for 28 days. After treatment, the mice were subjected to downhill (14° angel) treadmill running for 30 min at 18 m/min. Immediately after the exercise, the animals were sacrificed and the skeletal muscles were harvested.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreparation of EDL Homogenates: EDL muscles homogenates were prepared in 0.5 ml of homogenization buffer (20 mM NaF, 10 mM Tris-maleate, pH7.2+protease inhibitors). Cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (CSR) fractions were obtained by centrifuging the homogenates at 50,000×g for 30 min. Homogenates were centrifuged at 4000×g for 20 min and the supernatants were centrifuged for 20 min at 10000×g. Aliquots of the homogenates were assayed for protein concentration and stored at −80° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCalpain Activity Assay: Calpain activity of EDL homogenates (30 μg) were measured using a Calpain Activity Assay kit (Calbiochem). The assay utilizes a synthetic calpain substrate, suc-LLVY-AMC. AMC is released upon cleavage with calpain and is measured fluorometrically. Assays are performed with both an activation and an inhibition buffer to determine specific calpain activity in the sample.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSerum Creatine Kinase: Serum (10 μl) proteins were separated using 4-20% PAGE. After transferring the proteins to nitrocellulose, the immunoblots were developed using an anti-creatine kinase Antibody (Research Diagnostics, 1:1000 dilution). Bands were quantified by densitometry.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmunoprecipitation of Ryanodine Receptor: The ryanodine receptor (RyR1) was immunoprecipitated from samples by incubating 250 μg of EDL homogenate with anti-RyR antibody (2 μl 5029 Ab) in 0.5 ml of as modified RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.9% NaCl, 5.0 mM NaF, 1.0 mM Na\n3\nVO\n4\n, 0.5% Triton-X100, and protease inhibitors) 1 hr at 4° C. The samples were incubated with Protein A sepharose beads (Ammersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscatawy, N.J.) at 4° C. for 1 hour, after which, the beads were washed three times with RIPA. Samples were heated to 95° C. and size fractionated by PAGE.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWestern Analysis: Samples (immunoprecipitates or 10 μg CSR) were heated to 95° C. and the proteins were size fractionated on 6% SDS PAGE for RYR and 15% PAGE for calstabin. Immunoblots were developed using antibodies against RyR (5029, 1:5000 dilution), PKA phosphorylated RyR (1:10000), or Calstabin (1:2000). Dilutions are made in 5% milk in TBS-T.\n\n\n \nExample 10\n\n\nPreparation of Tissue Lysates\n\n\n \n \n \nTissue lysates were prepared by homogenizing the tissue (e.g., brain, cardiac, muscle) with Tissuemiser in 0.7 ml lysis buffer (pH 7.4, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM EDTA, 20 mM NaF, 2 mM Na\n3 \nVO\n4\n, 320 mM sucrose, and protease inhibitors) and centrifuged for 15 min at 4,000×g at 4° C. The supernatant was then centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000×g at 4° C. For brain homogenates, the supernatant was centrifuged at 50,000×g at 4° C. for 30 minutes, and the pellet (microsomes) was resuspended in homogenization buffer which was supplemented with 0.9% NaCl. For brain tissue, the resuspended pellet was used for immunoprecipitation of RyR. For cardiac and muscle tissue homogenates, the supernatant of the 10,000×g spin was used for immunoprecipitation of the RyR. Protein concentrations were measured by Bradford protein assay. The sample was frozen at −80° C. until use.\n\n\n \nExample 11\n\n\nImmunoprecipitation of Ryanodine Receptors (RyRs)\n\n\n \n \n \n100 μg of microsomes were brought to a volume of 500 μl with modified RIP A buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (PH 7.4), 0.9% NaCl, 5.0 mM NaF, 1.0 mM Na\n3\nVO\n4\n, 0.5% TritonX100, and protease inhibitors). The ryanodine receptor was immunoprecipitated by adding 2 μl of anti-RyR antibody (5209) and rotating the sample for 1 hr at 4° C. The sample was incubated with 40 μl of Protein A Sepharose beads and rotated for 1 hr at 4° C. After washing the beads with 500 μl RIP A buffer three times, the resulted pellet was resuspended in 15 μl of 2×SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor Western Blot Analysis, proteins were size fractionated on SDS-PAGE 4-20% gradient (BioRad). Immunoblots were developed with anti-FKBP and anti-RyR antibody or anti-phosphorylated FKBP.\n\n\n \nExample 12\n\n\nEffects of S107 on Spatial Learning and Cognitive Function\n\n\n \n \n \nExperiments were performed to determine whether the compounds described herein cross the blood brain barrier and enhance binding of cal stab in to ryanodine receptors in the brain. \nFIG. 56\n shows the results of Western blots performed on RyR immunoprecipitated from the tissue samples indicated (i.e. heart, soleus muscle, mid-brain, and cerebellum). As illustrated in \nFIG. 56\n, the compound S107 crosses the blood brain barrier and restores in vivo binding of calstabin to RyR in both the mid-brain and the cerebellum, following depletion of calstabin from the RyR complex by treatment of the mice with isoproterenol (“ISO”) by chronic infusion for 5 days. RyR was immunoprecipitated using an antibody to RyR, and the presence of calstabin in the immunoprecipitates was detected using an antibody to calstabin. The figure shows that the compound S107 penetrates the brain and restores in vivo binding of calstabin to RyR. Thus, S107 has calstabin rebinding activity in the brain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 57\n provides a schematic representation of in vivo experiments used to test the effect of S107 on cognitive function in mice, using the Morris water maze system (described below in \nFIG. 58\n). 16 wild type C57BL/6J 3-month-old mice, pairwise-matched for sex, age, and body weight, were randomized to either \nS\n 107 treatment (10 mg/ml; 0.25 μl/hr subcutaneous osmotic pump) or “vehicle” (25% DMSO in dH\n2\nO) treatment groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo days after initiation of treatment, mice were subject to an exercise regimen for 21 days, and effect of S107 treatment was assayed by the weekly protocol as described below. Mice were sacrificed after 21 days for performing biochemistry, calcium imaging and ex vivo function studies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 58\n (A) provides a schematic representation of in vivo experiments used to test the effect of S107 on learning in the Morris water maze system. The layout of the water maze system consists of a circular water tank divided into four quadrants (labeled 1 thru 4 in \nFIG. 58\n, with four hidden platforms (labeled 5 to 8 in \nFIG. 58\n). The following protocol was followed: Day 1: mice trained to find “hidden” platform with visible marker on platform from random starting location. On days 2-4, the visible cue was removed, and mice were repeatedly challenged to find hidden platform at \ntarget\n 5 in \nquadrant\n 1. The time taken for each mouse to reach the target, i.e. the “latency,” was recorded. On \nday\n 5, the previous day's protocol was repeated, then the hidden platform was removed, and each mouse's movements recorded to quantify time in various target regions. The protocol was repeated in \nweek\n 2. The bar graphs at the bottom of \nFIG. 3\n show the latency to target(s) (panel B) and mean velocity (cm/s) (panel C) for the vehicle and S107 treated groups at the end of the 21-day testing period.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe platform was then removed, and the swimming pattern of the mice was assessed at the end of the 21-day testing period. \nFIG. 59\n shows a trend towards improved learning or increased persistence in S107-treated mice as compared to vehicle. \nFIG. 60\n provides graphical data from the above experiments and shows a trend towards altered behavior consistent with improved learning and persistence in the S107-treated mice. p was approximately 0.2 vs. control (n=8 in both groups). The difference in permanence times between S107-treated and vehicle-treated mice does not appear to be due to swimming differences during the 2-minute probe learning assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 61\n shows biochemical data for mice subjected to an exercise regimen in the absence and presence of S107 at the end of the 21-day testing period. Ryanodine receptor (\ntypes\n 1 and 2) was immunoprecipitated from whole brain microsomes. Immunoprecipitates were separated by 4-20% PAGE and analyzed for total RyR, PKA phosphorylated RyR, and calstabin. The figure shows exercised-induced RyR1 and RyR2 phosphorylation, accompanied with reduction in \n \ncalstabin\n \n 1 or 2 binding. Treatment with S107 restores the binding of calstabin to RyR in exercised mice.\n\n\n \nExample 13\n\n\nEffects of Restraint Stress on PKA Phosphorylation at Different Stress Periods\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFIGS. 62-65\n illustrate the effect of restraint stress on PKA phosphorylation at different stress periods. Restraint Stress Model: Chronic stress has been found to induce PKA phosphorylation of ryanodine receptors (RyRs) in cardiac (RyR2) and skeletal (RyR1) muscle cells. The effects of chronic stress on PKA phosphorylation of RyRs in the brain, however, have not been explored. The Restraint Stress Model is designed to investigate whether chronic stress induces PKA phosphorylation of neuronal RyRs. As shown in \nFIG. 62\n, twelve C57BL/6J wild type male mice were assigned to different stress groups (n=2/group), generating 6 groups. Five of the 6 groups were stressed and sacrificed at the end of each stress period: 1, 5, 10, 14, and 21 days of stress (respectively 1 D, 5 D, 10 D, 14D and 21 D). The remaining group served as control (0 D) that was not restrained, and was sacrificed together with the 1 D group. Subjects in each stress group were restraint stressed in Plexiglas restrainer tubes (10×2½×3¾ cm) 2 hr in the morning and 2 hr in the afternoon of each stress period. The two nonstressed control subjects were handled in their home cage. At the end of each stress period, subjects were sacrificed (sac) by CO\n2 \nand their brains were immediately removed and frozen for later immunoblot analysis. RyR2 was immunoprecipitated from whole brain microsomes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 63\n shows the results of PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 channels in brain following restraint induced stress in mice. The mice were restrained for time periods as indicated. Ryanodine Receptor (type2) was immunoprecipitated from whole brain microsomes. Immunoprecipitates were separated by 4-20% PAGE and analyzed for total RyR2, PKA Phosphorylated RyR2, and calstabin2. \nFIG. 63\n shows stress-induced RyR2 phosphorylation, accompanied with reduction in \ncalstabin\n 2 binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 64\n is a bar graph summarizing the relative amounts of PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 from \nFIG. 63\n. The relative phosphorylation of RyR2 is represented using arbitrary units. A one-way ANOVA shows that there was a significant difference between groups [T(5,6)=27.58, P<0.0005]. Fisher's LSD post hoc test reveals that 14 and 21 days of chronic restraint stress (CRS) induced the highest PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 in the brain, where *** (P<0.001) and ** (P<0.01) compared with nonstressed controls (0 days). \nFIG. 65\n is a bar graph summarizing the relative amounts of calstabin2 bound to RyR2 from \nFIG. 63\n. A one-way ANOVA also shows a group difference between the stress periods [T(5,6)=5.91, P<0.037]. Fisher's LSD post hoc test reveals that only the 21 days of CRS showed the lowest calstabin2 binding to the RyR2 where * (P<0.05) compared with nonstressed controls (0 days).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll publications, references, patents and patent applications cited herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety to the same extent as if each individual application, patent or patent application was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile the foregoing invention has been described in some detail for purposes of clarity and understanding, it will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, from a reading of the disclosure, that various changes in form and detail can be made without departing from the true scope of the invention in the appended claims."

The content of this file is hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIn general, the invention relates to a screening method for agonists of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) with prolonged or short-lived activity. More specifically, the invention is related to parathyroid (PTH) hormone or PTH-related protein (PTHrP) ligand analogs that have either more prolonged or shorter-lived activity on the PTH receptor (PTHR) than does PTH(1-34). The invention also relates PTHR ligands identified using the methods of the invention and uses of such ligands in treating disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGPCRs are large group of membrane receptors which, in response to activation by an agonist, activate G-proteins which then, in turn, cause activation of at least one signaling cascade, such as the cyclic AMP/protein kinase A cascade. This large groups of receptors is found in organisms ranging from bacteria to man, and are involved in, for example, hormonal, neuronal, and olfactory signal transduction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe parathyroid hormone receptor (PTHR, SEQ ID NO:1 for human and SEQ ID NO:2 for rat) is the endogenous receptor for both PTH and PTH related protein (PTHrP), yet each ligand has a distinct biological function. PTH regulates calcium and phosphate homeostasis and acts as a gland-secreted endocrine hormone on target cells in bone and kidney. PTH also reduces the reabsorption of inorganic phosphate (P\ni\n) largely through its effects on sodium-dependent phosphate transporters (NaP\ni\n-IIa and NaP\ni\n-IIc) located in renal proximal tubule (PT) cells. PTHrP regulates cell proliferation and differentiation programs in developing tissues, and is secreted and acts in a paracrine fashion within tissue primordia (Kronenberg, H. M. \nAnn. N.Y. Acad. Sci. \n1068:1-13 (2006)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPTH (SEQ ID NO:3) and PTHrP (SEQ ID NO:4) are most homologous in their amino-terminal (residues 1-14) signaling domains (eight amino acid identities), and show moderate homology in their 14-34 binding domains (three identities). It has been generally inferred that the fully active (residues 1-34) portions of PTH and PTHrP interact with the PTHR via largely identical mechanisms (Caulfield et al., \nEndocrinology \n127:83-87 (1990); Abou-Samra et al., \nEndocrinology \n125:2215-2217 (1989)). This mechanism is thought to consist of two principal components: an interaction between the carboxy-terminal binding domain of the ligand and the amino-terminal extracellular (N) domain of the receptor, and an interaction between the amino-terminal signaling domain of the ligand and the juxtamembrane (J) region of the receptor, which contains the intracellular loops and seven transmembrane helices (Hoare et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n276:7741-7753 (2001); Castro et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n102:16084-16089 (2005); Witelsberger et al., \nBiochemistry \n45:2027-2034 (2006); Shimizu et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n280:1797-1807 (2005); Gensure et al., \nBiochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. \n328:666-678 (2005)). However, the extent, if any, to which the precise mechanisms of binding used by the two ligands differ remains to be determined.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn humans, PTH(1-34) (SEQ ID NO:5) has potent, bone-anabolic effects, and induces marked increases in bone mineral density and bone strength. Indeed, recombinant human PTH(1-34) is now considered to be one of the most effective treatments for osteoporosis (Tashjian and Gagel, \nJ. Bone Miner. Res \n21:354-365 (2006)). Importantly, hPTH(1-34) must be administered in a pulsatile fashion (e.g., once daily subcutaneous injection) in order for its bone-forming effects to be realized. With more prolonged administrations, as with a sustained infusion pump mechanism, PTH(1-34) exerts a net catabolic effect on bone, due to a greater activation of the bone-resorptive responses mediated by the osteoclasts, relative to the bone-forming responses mediated by the osteoblasts. The duration of exposure of the PTH receptor in bone to a PTH ligand is thus a key determinant of the overall bone-formation response achieved by that ligand, and thus its effectiveness as a treatment for osteoporosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nClinical studies have shown that PTHrP(1-36) (SEQ ID NO:6) can also increase bone mineral density in humans, and can do so approximately to the same extent as does PTH(1-34), although higher doses are required (Horwitz et al., \nJ. Endocrinol. Metab. \n88:569-575 (2003). Importantly, even at such higher doses, PTHrP(1-36) did not stimulate the adverse, bone resorptive and hypercalcemic responses that would be expected for equivalent doses of PTH(1-34) (Horwitz et al., \nJ. Endocrinol. Metab. \n88:569-575 (2003); Horwitz et al., \nJ. Bone Miner. Res. \n20:1792-1803 (2005); Horwitz et al., \nOsteoporosis Int. \n17:225-230 (2006)). The difference in biological activity of the two peptides is not due merely to a difference in pharamacokinetics. A direct comparison of the two peptides using steady-state infusions methods showed that PTHrP(1-36) is markedly less efficacious than PTH(1-34) for stimulating the renal synthesis of 1,25-(OH)\n2\nvitamin D3 (Horwitz et al., \nJ. Bone. Mineral. Research. \n20:1792-1803 (2005)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to osteoporosis, hPTH(1-34) (SEQ ID NO:5) has been shown to be effective in treating conditions of PTH deficiency, namely hypoparathyroidism. Thus, PTH(1-34) was shown to be a safe and effective alternative to calcitriol therapy and was able to maintain normal serum calcium levels without hypercalciuria in patients with hypoparathyroidism (Winer et al., \nJ. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. \n88:4214-4220 (2003)). The peptide had to be injected at least twice daily, and the authors recognized the need in this disease for a long-acting PTH(1-34) analog (Winer et al., \nJ. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. \n88:4214-4220 (2003).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore, there exists a need in the art for PTH or PTHrP analogs that have longer- or shorter-lived actions on the PTH receptor than does PTH(1-34). There also exists a need for assays that allow one to distinguish between PTH peptides that have short-versus long-acting effects.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nAccording to classical GPCR theory, two forms of a G-protein-coupled receptor can be distinguished: a form (RG) that is bound to a G-protein and a form (R) that is not bound to a G-protein. GPCR signaling requires that the G-protein be directly activated by the receptor, i.e., the RG state must form, and this RG formation can be induced by binding of an agonist ligand. Binding of an agonist ligand induces or stabilizes the RG state, and reciprocally, the RG state stabilizes the high affinity binding of an agonist. Upon binding GTP, or, a non-hydrolyzable GTP analog, such as GTPγS, a receptor-coupled G protein will dissociate from the receptor, causing the receptor to revert to a low affinity state. It is now recognized that some GPCRs, like the PTHR, can form a novel state (R\n0\n) that can bind certain agonist ligands with high affinity even in the presence of GTPγS, and hence, even when the receptor is presumably not bound by a G protein. In general, the proportions of a GPCR in a cell that are in the, RG, R, or R\n0 \nstate may vary, depending on cell type and conditions. For these reasons, prior work on assessing the binding of ligands to a GPCR generally did not clearly distinguish between the RG, R, or R\n0 \nstates. The present inventors, studying the PTH receptor, an exemplary GPCR, have discovered that ligands which bind with high affinity to the R\n0 \nstate, in addition to the RG state, have a longer activity half-life than ligands that bind to R\n0 \nwith lower affinity, and that this prolonged activity does not depend on the bioavailability or the pharmacokinetics of the ligand in vivo. Correspondingly, agonists with a short duration of action have a lower affinity for the R\n0 \nform of the receptor. Based on this discovery, the invention provides methods for identification of either long-acting or short-acting GPCR agonists, and peptide agonists identified using the methods of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a first aspect, the invention provides a method for determining whether a candidate compound is a long-acting agonist of a G protein coupled receptor (GPCR). The method includes (a) contacting the GPCR with the compound, where the GPCR is in the RG form, (b) measuring the affinity of the compound for the RG form of the GPCR, (c) contacting the GPCR with the compound, where the GPCR is in the R\n0 \nform, and (d) measuring the affinity of the compound for the R\n0 \nform of the GPCR, where, a compound that (i) has an affinity for the RG form of the GPCR that is at least 1% (e.g., 5, 10, 25, 30, 50, 60, 75, 90, 100, 125, 150, 200, 150, 300, 400, 500, 750, or 1000%) of an endogenous agonist for the GPCR, and (ii) has a greater affinity (e.g., 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000, or 10,000% greater) for the R\n0 \nform of the GPCR than the endogenous agonist or is identified as a long-acting agonist of the GPCR. The method may further include the steps of (e) administering the candidate compound to an animal, and (f) measuring at least one physiological response of the animal to the compound. The receptor may be a human receptor. The GPCR may be a secretin family receptor (e.g., a PTH/PTHrP receptor such as a human PTH/PTHrP receptor). When the receptor is involved in calcium homeostasis or transport, the measuring step (b) or (f) may be performed by measuring intracellular or blood calcium levels. For any GPCR, the affinity-measuring step (b) or step (d) may be performed using a competition binding assay. The competition binding assay may use a ligand that is specific for the RG form or specific for the R\n0 \nform of the GPCR. The measuring step (b) may be performed using a delayed cAMP assay (e.g., as described herein). The R\n0 \nform of the GPCR may enriched using a nonhydrolizable nucleotide analog (e.g., GTPγS). The RG form of the GPCR may be enriched using a dominant-negative G-protein. The receptor may be on a cell or in a membrane. The candidate compound may include a peptide or may be from a chemical library or natural product library.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention also features a method for determining whether a candidate compound is a short-acting agonist of a G protein coupled receptor (GPCR). The method includes (a) contacting the GPCR with the compound, where the GPCR is in the RG form, (b) measuring the affinity of the compound for the RG form of the GPCR, (c) contacting the GPCR with the compound, where the GPCR is in the R\n0 \nform; and (d) measuring the affinity of the compound for the R\n0 \nform of the GPCR, where a compound that (i) has an affinity for the RG form of the GPCR that is at least 1% (e.g., 5, 10, 25, 30, 50, 60, 75, 90, 100, 125, 150, 200, 150, 300, 400, 500, 750, or 1000%) of an endogenous agonist for the GPCR, and (ii) has a lower affinity (e.g., 99, 95, 90, 85, 75, 65, 55, 50, 40, 30, 25, 15, 10, 5, 1, 0.5, 0.1, 0.05, 0.01, 0.005, 0.001, 0.0005, or 0.0001%) for the R\n0 \nform of the GPCR than the endogenous agonist is identified as a short-acting agonist of the GPCR. The receptor may be a human receptor. The method may further including the steps of (e) administering the candidate compound to an animal, and (f) measuring at least one physiological response of the animal to the compound.

aspect, the invention features a PTH or PTHrP polypeptide (e.g., of any of the above aspects or described herein) where the N-terminus is substituted with a bulky residue (e.g., Trp). Such polypeptides include Trp\n1\n-PTH(1-34) (SEQ ID NO:118), Trp\n1\n-M-PTH(1-34) (SEQ ID NO:119), and TRP\n1\n-PTHrP(1-36) (SEQ ID NO:120), or a fragment thereof containing amino acids 1-10, 1-11, 1-12, 1-13, 1-14, 1-15, 1-16, 1-17, 1-18, 1-19, 1-20, 1-21, 1-22, 1-23, 1-24, 1-25, 1-26, 1-27, 1-28, 1-29, 1-30, 1-31, 1-32, 1-33, 1-34, or 1-35 of said sequence. The polypeptide may have reduced (e.g., by at least 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 90, 95, 99, 99.5, 99.9, 99.95, or 99.99%) PLC signaling activity at the PTH receptor as compared to the polypeptide lacking the bulky residue substitution. Other bulky residues include Phe, Tyr, and p-benzoylphenylalanine (Bpa). In certain embodiments, the polypeptide includes any one (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7) of the mutations set forth in the M or Mc modifications, where M represents [Ala\n1,12\n,Aib\n3\n,Gln\n10\n,homoarginine\n11\n,Trp\n14\n,Arg\n19\n] and Mc represents Ala\n1,3,12\n,Gln\n10\n,Arg\n11\n,Trp\n14\n, Arg\n19 \nPTH sequence, or any combination thereof. Hybrid peptides may further include a substitution at position 5 (e.g., a histidine at position 5). Exemplary polypeptides include Trp\n1\n-PTH(1-28) (SEQ ID NO:121) and Trp\n1\n-M-PTH(1-28) (SEQ ID NO:122).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect of the invention, the invention features a polypeptide including a hybrid PTH/PTHrP polypeptide or a polypeptide including an amino acid sequence substantially identical to a hybrid PTH/PTHrP polypeptide. The polypeptide may be represented by the formula PTH(1-X)/PTHrP(Y-36), where X is 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, or 34 and Y=X+1. In certain embodiments, the hybrid polypeptide contains any one (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7) of the mutations set forth in the M or Mc modifications, where M represents [Ala\n1,12\n,Aib\n3\n,Gln\n10\n,homoarginine\n1l\n,Trp\n14\n,Arg\n19\n] and Mc represents Ala\n1,3,12\n,Gln\n10\n,Arg\n11\n,Trp\n14\n, Arg\n19 \nPTH sequence, or any combination thereof. Hybrid peptides may further include a substitution at position 5 (e.g., a histidine at position 5).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn any of the polypeptides described above, the polypeptide may be biologically active, e.g., have an affinity for the RG form of the GPCR that is at least 1% (e.g., 5, 10, 25, 30, 50, 60, 75, 90, 100, 125, 150, 200, 150, 300, 400, 500, 750, or 1000%) of an endogenous agonist for the GPCR, and have a lower affinity (e.g., 99, 95, 90, 85, 75, 65, 55, 50, 40, 30, 25, 15, 10, 5, 1, 0.5, 0.1, 0.05, 0.01, 0.005, 0.001, 0.0005, or 0.0001%) for the R\n0 \nform as compared to a control (e.g., an endogenous ligand for the GPCR). In other embodiments, the polypeptide has an affinity for the RG form of the GPCR that is at least 1% (e.g., 5, 10, 25, 30, 50, 60, 75, 90, 100, 125, 150, 200, 150, 300, 400, 500, 750, or 1000%) of an endogenous agonist for the GPCR, and (ii) has a greater affinity (e.g., 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000, or 10,000% greater) for the R\n0 \nform of the GPCR than the endogenous agonist or is identified as a long-acting agonist of the GPCR. In the above aspects, the polypeptide may be RG selective, R\n0 \nselective, a short-acting agonist, or a long-acting agonist. In certain embodiments, the polypeptide may be modified (e.g., acetylated at the N-terminal, amidated at the C-terminal, or contain any of the modifications described herein).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also features a nucleic acid including a sequence encoding a polypeptide described herein (e.g., those described above). The nucleic acid may be operably linked to promoter and/or part of a vector. The invention also features a cell (e.g., a prokaryotic cell such as bacterial cell or a eukaryotic cell such as yeast or mammalian, for example, human, cell) including the vector.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also features a method of making the polypeptide by growing the cell under conditions which induce expression of said nucleic acid and optionally purifying said polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “GPCR” is meant any polypeptide comprising a G protein coupled receptor or functional fragment thereof. Desirably, a GPCR has at least 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 99%, or 100% sequence identity to a naturally occurring GPCR. Exemplary GPCRs are described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “RG form” of a GPCR is meant the G-protein-bound receptor conformation. The RG form of a GPCR can be induced, for example, by increased G-protein binding of the GPCR. In the assays of the invention, at least 1%, 5%, 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, 95%, or 99% of the receptors are in the RG form when affinity for RG form is measured.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “R\n0 \nform” of a GPCR is meant the receptor conformation that occurs when the GPCR is not bound to a G-protein, but is capable of binding at least some ligands of the receptor. The R\n0 \nform of a GPCR, relative to RG, can be favored, for example, by preventing or reducing G-protein binding to the GPCR. In the assays of the invention, at least 0.1%, 1%, 5%, 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, 95%, or 99% of the receptors may be in the R\n0 \nform when affinity for the R\n0 \nform is measured.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “affinity” is meant the ability of a compound to interact with a target receptor. In the assays and polypeptides of the invention, affinity may be measured directly by binding (e.g., competition binding assays or FRET), or indirectly through an activity assay (e.g., cAMP signaling or changes in intracellular calcium). Desirably the compound has an affinity for the receptor of at least 10 mol, 1 mol, 500 nmol, 100 nmol, 50 nmol, 25 nmol, 10 nmol, 5 nmol, 1 nmol, 500 pmol, 200 pmol, 100 pmol, 50 pmol, 25 pmol 10 pmol, or 1 pmol as measured by EC\n50 \nfor the RG form or the R\n0 \nform of the GPCR.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “long-acting agonist” is meant an agonist whose activity (e.g., measured in vivo or in vitro) has a half life that is at least 5%, 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%, 150%, 200%, 500%, 1000%, or 5000% longer as compared to an endogenous agonist for the same receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “short-acting agonist” is meant an agonist whose activity (e.g., measured in vivo or in vitro using an assay described herein) has a half life that is less than 95%, 90%, 75%, 60%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, 10%, 5%, or 1% as compared to an endogenous agonist for the same receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “RG selective agonist” is an agonist that exhibits increased binding to the RG form of a receptor relative to the R\n0 \nform of the receptor, as compared to a control agonist (e.g., an endogenous agonist). Receptor selectivity can be expressed as a ratio of binding constants between each receptor form, e.g., R\n0\n/RG ratio, where an increase in this ratio indicates stronger binding to the RG form. As shown in \nFIGS. 26A and 26B\n, the R\n0\n/RG ratio of PTH(1-34) (SEQ ID NO:5) is 67 and the relatively more RG selective PTHrP(1-36) (SEQ ID NO:6) is 260 in binding the human PTH receptor expressed on COS-7 cell membranes. An RG selective agonist may have an R\n0\n/RG ratio of at least 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 5000, 7000, 10,000, 15,000, 20,000, or 50,000 in this system. The R\n0\n/RG ratio may be at least 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 25, 50, 75, or 100-fold that of the control agonist.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “R\n0 \nselective agonist” is an agonist that exhibits decreased binding to the RG form of a receptor relative to the R\n0 \nform of the receptor, as compared to a control agonist (e.g., an endogenous agonist). Receptor selectivity can be expressed as a ratio of binding constants between each receptor form, e.g., R\n0\n/RG ratio, where a decrease in this ratio indicates stronger binding to the R\n0 \nform. As shown in \nFIGS. 26A and 26B\n, the R\n0\n/RG ratio of PTH(1-34) (SEQ ID NO:5) is 67 and the relatively more RG selective PTHrP(1-36) (SEQ ID NO:6) is 260 in binding the human PTH receptor expressed on COS-7 cell membranes. The R\n0 \nselective agonist may have an R\n0\n/RG ratio of less than 60, 50, 40, 30, 25, 20, 25, 10, 5, 2, 1, 0 in this system. The R\n0\n/RG ratio thus may be less than 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0.08, 0.05, 0.03, 0.01, 0.008, 0.005, 0.003, or 0.001-fold of that the control agonist.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “endogenous agonist” of a GPCR is meant a compound produced by an organism, or a synthetic phenocopy of that compound, i.e., a compound having the same pharmacological activity as the endogenous agonist. For example, the native PTH peptide (SEQ ID NO:3) is 1-84, and PTHrP (SEQ ID NO:4) is −1-140 amino acids; phenocopies of these ligands include PTH(1-34) (SEQ ID NO:5) and PTHrP(1-36) (SEQ ID NO:6), respectively. An endogenous agonist is involved in or modulates the normal physiological activation of the GPCR. Some GPCRs have multiple endogenous agonists (e.g., endogenous agonists for the PTHR include PTH and PTHrP); for purposes of the invention, any endogenous agonist may be used to determine whether the candidate compound is short-acting or long-acting.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “peptide” or “polypeptide” is meant a chain of amino acids of at least 4, 6, 10, 25, 50, 100, 150, 200, 500, or 1000 amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “fragment” of a polypeptide is meant a portion of a sequence at least 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, or 35 amino acids in length By “subject” is meant either a human or non-human animal (e.g., a mammal).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “an amount sufficient to treat” is meant an amount sufficient to reduce, prevent, or eliminate at least one symptom associated with the disease or condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy a “purified polypeptide” or “isolated polypeptide” is meant a polypeptide that has been separated from other components. Typically, the polypeptide is substantially pure when it is at least 30%, by weight, free from other components. In certain embodiments, the preparation is at least 50%, 60%, 75%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% by weight, free from other components. A purified polypeptide may be obtained, for example, by extraction from a natural source; by expression of a recombinant polynucleotide encoding such a polypeptide; or by chemically synthesizing the polypeptide. Purity can be measured by any appropriate method, for example, column chromatography, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, or by HPLC analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “biologically active” is meant that the compound or composition (e.g., a polypeptide described herein) has at least one biologically significant effect upon administration to a cell or animal (e.g., a human or non-human mammal). Biological activities of PTH, PTHrP, and analogs thereof (e.g., those described herein) include receptor binding, cAMP or IP\n3 \nproduction, protein kinase A, protein kinase C, phospholipase C, phospholipase D, and phospholipase A\n2 \nactivation, changes (e.g., increases or decreases) in intracellular, plasma, or urinary calcium or phosphate levels, and changes in bone metabolism or catabolism in vivo or in vitro. A biologically active peptide of the invention (e.g., any peptide described herein), for example, may exhibit increases (e.g., at least 5%, 10%, 25%, 50%, 100%, 500%, 1000%, 10,000%) or decreases (e.g., 95%, 90%, 75%, 50%, 25%, 10%, 5%, 1%, 0.1%, 0.01%, or 0.001%) in any biological activity as compared to an appropriate control (e.g., a wild-type peptide or a phenocopy thereof such as PTH(1-34) (SEQ ID NO:5) or PTHrP(1-36) (SEQ ID NO:6)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “substantially identical” is meant a nucleic acid or amino acid sequence that, when optimally aligned, for example, using the methods described below, share at least 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100% sequence identity with a second nucleic acid or amino acid sequence, e.g., an PTH or PTHrP sequence or fragment thereof. “Substantial identity” may be used to refer to various types and lengths of sequence, such as full-length sequence, epitopes or immunogenic peptides, functional domains, coding and/or regulatory sequences, exons, introns, promoters, and genomic sequences. Percent identity between two polypeptides or nucleic acid sequences is determined in various ways that are within the skill in the art, for instance, using publicly available computer software such as Smith Waterman Alignment (Smith et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n147:195-7 (1981)); “Best Fit” (Smith and Waterman, Advances in Applied Mathematics, 482-489 (1981)) as incorporated into GeneMatcher Plus™, Schwarz and Dayhof (1979) Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure, Dayhof, M. O., Ed pp 353-358; BLAST program (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool; (Altschul et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n215: 403-10 (1990)), BLAST-2, BLAST-P, BLAST-N, BLAST-X, WU-BLAST-2, ALIGN, ALIGN-2, CLUSTAL, or Megalign (DNASTAR) software. In addition, those skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters for measuring alignment, including any algorithms needed to achieve maximal alignment over the length of the sequences being compared. In general, for proteins, the length of comparison sequences will be at least 6 or 8 amino acids, preferably 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 125, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, or 500 amino acids or more up to the entire length of the protein. For nucleic acids, the length of comparison sequences will generally be at least 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48, 51, 54, 57, 60, 63, 66, 69, 72, 75, 78, 81, 84, 87, 90, 93, 96, 99, 102, 105, 108, 111, 125, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1100, 1200, or at least 1500 nucleotides or more up to the entire length of the nucleic acid molecule. It is understood that for the purposes of determining sequence identity when comparing a DNA sequence to an RNA sequence, a thymine nucleotide is equivalent to a uracil nucleotide. Conservative substitutions typically include substitutions within the following groups: glycine, alanine; valine, isoleucine, leucine; aspartic acid, glutamic acid, asparagine, glutamine; serine, threonine; lysine, arginine; and phenylalanine, tyrosine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “bulky amino acid” is meant any amino acid with a molecular weight greater than 100 Da (e.g., greater than 125, 150, 175, 200, 225, 250, 300, or 400). The molecular weight of each coding amino acid is as follows. Ala: 71.09, Arg: 156.19, Asp: 115.09, Asn: 114.11, Cys: 103.15, Glu: 129.12, Gln: 128.14, Gly: 57.05, His: 137.14, Ile: 113.16, Leu: 113.16, Lys: 128.17, Met: 131.19, Phe: 147.18, Pro: 97.12, Ser: 87.08, Thr: 101.11, Trp: 186.12, Tyr: 163.18, and Val: 99.14.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following Detailed Description, the drawings, and the claims.\n\n\n \n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFIGS. 1A-1C\n are graphs showing dissociation of PTH and PTHrP analogs from the human PTH receptor (PTHR) and the effects of GTPγS. The radioligands \n125\nI-[Nle\n8,21\n,Tyr\n34\n]rPTH(1-34)NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:123) (\nFIG. 1A\n), \n125\nI-[Tyr\n36\n]THrp(1-36)NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:124) (\nFIG. 1B\n) and \n125\nI-[Ile\n5\n,Tyr\n36\n]PTHrP(1-36)NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:125) (\nFIG. 1C\n) were pre-bound to the human PTHR in membranes prepared from HKRK-B7 cells for 90 minutes; then dissociation was initiated (t=0) by the addition of an excess of the unlabeled analog (5×10\n−7 \nM), added either alone (filled circles) or together with GTPγS (5×10\n−7 \nM, open circles). At each time point, aliquots were removed from the reaction tubes and immediately subjected to rapid vacuum filtration using a 96-well vacuum filtration plate to separate bound from free radioactivity. Non-specific binding was determined in tubes containing the unlabeled ligand (5×10\n−7\nM) during both the pre-incubation and dissociation phases. The specifically bound radioactivity (SB) at each time point was then expressed as the percent of the specific binding observed at t=0. Aggregate data from four (\nFIG. 1A\n), five (\nFIG. 1B\n), or three (\nFIG. 1C\n) experiments are shown. Curves were fit to the data using either a two-phase (\nFIGS. 1A and 1B\n) or single phase (\nFIG. 1C\n) exponential decay equation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIGS. 2A and 2B\n are graphs showing GTPγS sensitivity of PTH and PTHrP analog binding to the human and rat PTHRs. Radioligand analog binding to the PTHR in membranes prepared from HKRK-B7 (\nFIG. 2A\n) or ROS17/2.8 cells (\nFIG. 2B\n) was assessed under near-equilibrium conditions in the absence or presence of varying concentrations of GTPγS. Data are expressed as a percent of radioactivity specifically bound (SB) in the absence of GTPγS. Data in \nFIG. 2A\n are means (±s.e.m.) from three (PTH(1-34)) or five (PTHrP(1-36) analogs) experiments, and those in \nFIG. 2B\n are from six experiments, each performed in duplicate. The radioligands studied were \n125\nI-[Nle\n8,21\n,Tyr\n34\n]PTH(1-34)NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:123); [Tyr\n36\n]PTHrP(1-36)NH\n2 (SEQ ID NO:\n124); [Ile\n5\n,Tyr\n36\n]PTHrP(1-36)NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:125) and [Aib\n1,3\n,Nle\n8\n,Gln\n10\n,Har\n11\n,Ala\n12\n,Trp\n14\n,Tyr\n15\n]PTH(1-15)NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:126).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIGS. 3A-3D\n are graphs showing binding of PTH and PTHrP analogs to the G protein-coupled and G protein-uncoupled conformations of the hPTHR. The binding of unlabeled PTH and PTHrP analogs to the G protein-coupled PTHR conformation (RG) and G protein-uncoupled PTHR conformation)(R\n0 \nwas assessed by competition methods using membranes prepared from transiently transfected COS-7 cells. To assess binding to RG, the cells were co-transfected with the hPTHR and a negative-dominant Gas subunit (Gα\nND\n); and \n125\nI-[Aib\n1,3 \nM]PTH(1-15)NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:126) was used as a tracer radioligand. To assess binding to R\n0\n, the cells were transfected with the hPTHR alone, \n125\nI[Nle\n8,21\n,Tyr\n34\n]rPTH(1-34)NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:123) was used as a tracer radioligand, and the binding reactions were performed in the presence of GTPγS. The unlabeled ligands used were [Nle\n8,21\n,Tyr\n36\n]rPTH(1-34)NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:123) (\nFIG. 3A\n); [Tyr\n36\n]hPTHrP(1-36)NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:124) (\nFIG. 3B\n); [His\n5\n,Nle\n8,21\n,Tyr\n34\n]rPTH(1-34)NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:127) (\nFIG. 3C\n); and [Ile\n5\n,Tyr\n36\n]hPTHrP(1-36)NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:125) (\nFIG. 3D\n). Whereas each ligand binds with relatively high affinity to RG, PTHrP(1-36), and His\n5\n-PTH(1-34) bind with considerably lower affinity to R\n0 \nthan do PTH(1-34) and Ile\n5\n-PTHrP(1-36), and thus exhibit stronger RG selectivity. Data are means (±s.e.m.) of three to seven experiments, each performed in duplicate (see also Table 5).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIGS. 4A-4D\n are graphs showing fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis of ligand binding to the PTHR in HEK-293 cells. HEK-293 cells stably transfected with a PTHR construct (PTHR-cam) containing cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) in the third intracellular loop and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) in the carboxy-terminal tail, were used to assess the kinetics of ligand binding to, and dissociation from the PTHR. With PTHR-cam, excitation of the CFP with ultraviolet light (λ\nexc\n=436 nm) produces an intramolecular FRET to the YFP, which is observable as an increase in light emission from YFP (λ\nemm\n=535 nm) and a decrease in light emission from CFP λ\nemm\n=480 nm). This FRET signal occurs in the ground-state receptor and decreases upon agonist binding. In each panel, the trace shows the ratio of the fluorescence signals (F\nYFP(535)\n/F\nCFP(480)\n, normalized for channel spill-over) obtained over time in cells superfused with buffer alone or with buffer containing a PTH peptide ligand (times of peptide addition indicated by the black bars above each trace). The ligands used were hPTH(1-34) (SEQ ID NO:5) (\nFIG. 4A\n); [Aib\n1,3\n,Gln\n10\n,Har\n11\n,Ala\n12\n,Trp\n14\n]rPTH(1-14)NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:128) (\nFIG. 4B\n); [Tyr\n36\n]hPTHrP(1-36)NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:124) (\nFIG. 4C\n), and [Ile\n5\n,Tyr\n36\n]hPTHrP(1-36)NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:125) (\nFIG. 4D\n). The onset of the FRET signal induced by PTHrP(1-36) was slower than that induced by the three other analogs. The signals induced by PTH(1-14) and PTHrP(1-36) analogs decayed upon ligand removal, whereas those induced by PTH(1-34) and Ile\n5\n-PTHrP(1-36) analogs remained stable. Data are from a single experiment, and identical results were obtained in at least three others.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIGS. 5A and 5B\n are graphs showing the duration of cAMP-signaling responses induced by PTH and PTHrP analogs in cells stably expressing the human PTHR. The duration of cAMP responses induced by PTHrP(1-36) (SEQ ID NO:6) or Ile\n5\n-PTHrP(1-36) (SEQ ID NO:13) in HKRK-B7 cells (950,000 hPTHRs/per cell) was assessed by time course experiments (FIG. \n5\nA). The cells were pre-treated for 10 minutes with either buffer alone (basal) or buffer containing ligand (100 nM); at t=0, the cells were washed, incubated in buffer for the times indicated (wash-out phase), treated with 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) for five minutes, and then assessed for intracellular cAMP. The maximum response to each peptide, assessed by incubating cells concomitantly with peptide and IBMX and omitting the wash-out phase, was 185116 and 198118 pmoles/well for PTHrP(1-36) and Ile\n5\n-PTHrP(1-36), respectively. The cAMP level in cells treated with IBMX in the absence of ligand was 2.0±0.3 pmole/well. Data are means (±s.e.m.) of three experiments, each performed in duplicate. In these experiments, PTH(1-34) (SEQ ID NO:5) was also analyzed and induced responses at each time point that were not different from those induced by PTHrP(1-36). Analogs were similarly assessed in HKRK-B64 cells (90,000 hPTHRs/cell) at a single time-point, 60 minutes after ligand wash-out (\nFIG. 5B\n). For each peptide, the data are expressed as a percentile of the maximum cAMP responses (indicated in side panel) produced in cells treated concomitantly with that ligand and IBMX for 10 minutes and omitting the wash-out phase. The analogs included His\n5\n-PTH(1-34) (SEQ ID NO:9) and [Aib\n1,3\n,M]PTH(1-15) (SEQ ID NO:126) (\nFIG. 5B\n). Data are means (±s.e.m) of four experiments, each performed in triplicate. Asterisks indicate statistical analyses of paired responses: PTHrP(1-36) vs. Ile\n5\n-PTHrP(1-36) (\nFIG. 5A\n), or as indicated by brackets (\nFIG. 5B\n): *, P≦0.05; **, P≦0.003.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIGS. 6A-6D\n are graphs showing binding of PTH and PTHrP analogs to the G protein-coupled and G protein-uncoupled conformations of the hPTHR. Binding reactions were performed as described above for \nFIGS. 3A-3D\n. The unlabeled ligands used were hPTH(1-34)NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:5) (\nFIG. 6A\n); [Aib\n1,3\n,Nle\n8\n,Gln\n10\n,Har\n11\n,Ala\n12\nTrp\n14\n,Tyr\n15\n]rPTH(1-15)NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:126) (\nFIG. 6B\n); [His\n5\n]hPTH(1-34)NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:9) (\nFIG. 6C\n); hPTHrP(1-36)NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:6) (\nFIG. 6D\n). Data are means (±s.e.m.) of three or five experiments, each performed in duplicate (Table 6).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIGS. 7A and 7B\n shows a dose-response analysis of analog signaling potency. The capacity of PTH and PTHrP ligands to stimulate cAMP formation was assessed in HKRK-B64 cells (\nFIG. 7A\n). Cells were treated for 30 minutes at room temperature with varying concentrations of ligand in the presence of IBMX. The capacity of the ligands to stimulate the production of inositol phosphates (IPs) was assessed in COS-7 cells transiently transfected with the hPTHR (\nFIG. 7B\n). Cells were treated for 30 minutes at room temperature with varying concentrations of ligand. The ligands used were [Nle\n8,21\n,Tyr\n34\n]rPTH(1-34)NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:123); [His\n5\n,Nle\n8,21\n,Tyr\n34\n]rPTH(1-34)NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:127); [Tyr\n36\n]hPTHrP(1-36)NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:124) and [Ile\n5\n,Tyr\n36\n]hPTHrP(1-36)NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:125). Data are means (±s.e.m.) of four (\nFIG. 7A\n) or five (\nFIG. 7B\n) experiments, each performed in duplicate. The EC\n50 \nand Emax values are reported in Table 6 and were not significantly different between peptides, with the exception of the cAMP EC\n50 \nvalues for H\n5\n-PTH(1-34) and PTH(1-34) analogs (P=0.02).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 8\n is a graph showing cAMP dose responses in rat cells. Rat osteoblastic cells treated with hPTH(1-28)NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:129); Ala\n1,12\n,Aib\n3\n,Gln\n10\n,Har\n11\n,Trp\n14\n,Arg\n19\n-hPTH(1-28)NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:11); hPTH(1-34)NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:5), or r(rat)PTH(1-34)NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:130). The resulting intracellular cAMP formed was quantified by radioimmuno assay. EC50 values are listed below the graph. Curve fits were obtained by non-linear regression analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIGS. 9A-9D\n are graphs showing in vivo plasma cAMP levels in mice treated with PTH analogs. Wild-type mice were injected subcutaneously with vehicle (0.9% NaCl/0.05% Tween-20), or vehicle containing a PTH peptide at a dose-level of 10 to 1,000 nmol of peptide per kg of body weight, and at indicated times after injection, blood was withdrawn from the tail vein, and the amount of cAMP in the resulting plasma was quantified by radioimmuno assay. Each curve corresponds to a peptide at a defined concentration, as indicated in the graph keys. The plasma cAMP concentrations are plotted as picomole per μl plasma. The data show that at 50 nmol/kg, Ala\n1,12\n,Aib\n3\n,Gln\n10\n,Har\n11\n,Trp\n14\n,Arg\n19\n-hPTH(1-28)NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:11) (Aib-50, \nFIG. 9A\n) and hPTH(1-34)NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:5) ((1-34)-50, \nFIG. 9B\n) produce comparable increases in plasma cAMP concentrations, whereas 1,000 nmol/kg of hPTH(1-28)NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:129) is required to achieve the same increase ((1-28)-1000, \nFIG. 9C\n, also \nFIG. 9D\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIGS. 10A and 10B\n are graphs showing in vivo plasma phosphate and serum ionized calcium levels in mice treated with PTH analogs.

Serum ionized calcium concentrations were determined using a Chiron Diagnostics Model 634 Ca\n++\n/pH analyzer. Data in A are means (±s.e.m.) of one experiment using six mice (n=6) for each injection condition; similar results were obtained in three other experiments.

These PTH analogs show comparable cAMP signaling to hPTH(1-34).\n\n\n \n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION\n\n\n \n \n \nWe have discovered a correlation between (i) the ability of a GPCR ligand to bind a GPCR when uncoupled to a G-protein (the R\n0 \nstate) and (ii) the length of time over which the ligand activates the receptor. In particular, an enhanced ability of a ligand to interact in vitro with the exemplary GPCR, the PTH/PTHrP receptor (PTHR), uncoupled to a G-protein (the R\n0 \nform), as compared to PTH or PTHrP, closely correlates its ability to exert more prolonged activity in vivo. The reverse is also true, i.e., that ligands selective for the G-protein coupled forms of GPCR (the RG form) have a shorter duration of activity as compared to the native ligand. This discovery provides the basis for a novel means of determining whether a compound has either long-acting or shorting-acting in vivo activity on a GPCR. On this basis, ligands with therapeutically desirable properties (e.g., long-acting or short-acting ligands) can be identified using the methods described herein. Exemplary ligands with either long-acting or short-acting activity are described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDepending on the disease being treated, long-acting or short-acting therapeutics are desirable. Recent studies using PTHrP(1-36) injected in humans show that bone mineral density increased to about the same extent as with PTH(1-34), the standard therapy for osteoporosis, but without inducing the bone-resorptive responses that would be expected for an equivalent dose of PTH(1-34) (Horwitz et al., \nJ. Endocrinol. Metab. \n88:569-575 (2003)). Related studies from this group suggest that the differences are not likely based solely on pharmacokinetics, as an acute safety study indicated that PTHrP(1-36) could be administered at doses nearly 20-fold above the usual dose of PTH(1-34) without producing a hypercalcemic effect (Horwitz et al., \nOsteoporosis Int. \n17:225-230 (2006)). While both PTHrP(1-36) and PTH(1-34) exhibit similar receptor binding to the RG form of the PTHR, our discovery that PTHrP binds less strongly to the R\n0 \nform of the PTHR and correspondingly exhibits less prolonged activity in vivo as compared to PTH can explain the difference. Accordingly, we believe that RG selective ligands of PTHR (i.e., with relatively low R\n0 \naffinity) will prove useful for treatment of osteoporosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other situations, a longer acting ligand may be desirable. For example, PTHrP is less effective than PTH(1-34) in stimulating renal production of 1,25,(OH)\n2\nvitamin D (Horwitz et al., \nJ. Bone Mineral. Res. \n20:1792-1803 (2005)), suggesting that PTH(1-34) may be more effecting in treating disease where long-acting PTHR signaling is desired. Such diseases include certain forms of hypoparathyroidism caused by activating mutations in the calcium-sensing receptor. Currently, treating this disease requires twice daily injections of PTH(1-34) (Winer et al., \nJ. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. \n88:4214-4220 (2003)). By using the screening methods of the invention, it becomes possible to identify longer acting PTHR ligands, which can prove highly useful in the treatment of such diseases and may allow for less frequent administration of the drug.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPTH(1-34), via its greater capacity to bind stably to R\n0\n, may be able to induce a cumulatively greater signaling response in target bone and kidney cells than does PTHrP, and this difference in R\n0 \nselectivity then leads to a divergence in biological responses, such as the induction in osteoblasts of factors (RANK Ligand) involved in stimulating osteoclastic bone resorption, and the stimulation in renal proximal tubule cells of 1-α-hydroxylase mRNA synthesis. According to these considerations, a ligand that binds with particularly high selectivity to the RG (versus R\n0\n)PTHR conformation might be highly effective in stimulating bone formation responses, and thus useful for treating osteoporosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, the two ligands preferentially stabilize distinct receptor conformations. There is now much discussion in the GPCR field regarding the capacity of structurally varied ligands for a given receptor to exhibit altered selectivities for distinct receptor conformations, and thus produce distinct biological effects (Kenakin, T. Sci STKE 342:pe29 (2006)). The results of the kinetic and equilibrium binding assays performed herein suggest that whereas PTH(1-34) and PTHrP(1-36) bind with similar affinities to the G protein-coupled PTHR conformation, RG, PTH(1-34) exhibits a greater capacity to bind to the G protein-uncoupled conformation, R\n0\n, defined as a receptor conformation that has the capacity to bind ligand with high affinity in the presence in GTPγS (5,14), than does PTHrP(1-36).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe delayed cAMP assays presented herein demonstrate that altered selectivity for distinct PTHR conformations can lead to altered signaling responses in PTHR-expressing cells. Thus, PTH(1-34) and Ile\n5\n-PTHrP(1-36) induced more prolonged, and cumulatively greater, cAMP signaling responses in PTHR-expressing cells. PTH(1-34) and Ile\n5\n-PTHrP(1-36), which also have a greater capacity to stabilize R\n0 \nthan PTHrP(1-36), can induce more prolonged signaling responses due to the eventual coupling of the LR\n0 \ncomplex to a heterotrimeric G protein (LR\n0\n-LRG) and activation of the corresponding signaling cascade. Another potential mechanistic consequence of stable LR\n0 \nbinding is that it may permit multiple (catalytic) rounds of G protein activation, by which an LR\n0 \ncomplex is preserved after successive cycles of G protein coupling, activation and release (Rodbel, M. Adv. Enzyme Regul, 37: 427-435 (1997); Heck and Hofmann, \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n276:10000-10009 (2001)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLittle if any difference in the potencies with which PTH(1-34) and PTHrP(1-36) ligands stimulated cAMP and inositol phosphate responses was detected when the ligands were assessed in conventional dose-response, cAMP and inositol phosphate stimulation assays performed in cells at a single-time-point (\nFIG. 7\n). These results are consistent with the view that the two ligands interact with the PTHR via the same, or similar mechanisms. The time-delayed cAMP assays thus identified previously unappreciated differences in the second-messenger signaling properties of the two ligands, evident as differences in the cumulative signal output over time. While the agonist-activated PTHR is known to be subject to desensitization processes involving receptor phosphorylation, beta-arrestin recruitment, and receptor internalization (Biselo, A. et al., (2002); Tawfeek et al., \nMol. Endocrinol\n. (2002); Castro et al., \nEndocrinology \n143:3854-3865 (2002); Chauvin et al., \nMol. Endocrinol. \n16:2720-2732 (2002)), it is not expected that such a process would operate on receptors in the R\n0 \nconformation, as these are, by definition, functionally inactive, at least in terms of G protein coupling. Nevertheless, the possibility that the effects observed in our delayed cAMP assays of \nFIG. 5\n involve, to some extent, differential effects of the ligands on such receptor desensitization mechanisms cannot be excluded.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, a stable LR\n0 \nbinding capacity might facilitate, or augment, the signaling potential of a ligand in target cells that express a low level of the cognate heterotrimeric G protein, relative to the target receptor. It may also facilitate coupling to “secondary” G proteins that presumably have lower affinity for the ligand-receptor complex than does the primary G protein. For the PTHR, this could involve coupling to Gα\nq/11\n, Gα\ni/o\n, or Gα\n12/13\n, each of which has been shown to be activated by the PTHR in response to PTH(1-34). While PTHrP has at least some capacity to bind R\n0 \n(\nFIGS. 3A-3D\n) and activate delayed cAMP signaling (\nFIGS. 5A and 5B\n), the binding is less than that of PTH(1-34). Indeed, some capacity to form a stable LR\n0 \ncomplex may be an intrinsic property of the class B GPCRs, as several of these, including the receptors for calcitonin (Hilton et al., \nJ. Endocrinol. \n166:213-226 (2002)), corticortropin-releasing hormone (Hoare et al., \nPeptides \n24:1881-1897 (2003)) and glucagon (Post et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n267:25776-25785 (1992)) have been shown to form a stable complex with their cognate peptide ligand in the presence of a non-hydrolyzable guanine nucleotide analog.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe findings described herein may also relate to the mechanisms by which PTH and PTHrP function in normal physiology. PTH, as an endocrine hormone, acts on target cells (in bone and kidney) that are distal from its site of secretion (the parathyroid glands). Concentrations of PTH in the serum, while varying marginally as Ca\n++\n levels fluctuate, generally stay within the low picomolar range, well below the affinity with which PTH binds to its receptor. The capacity of PTH to bind stably to the receptor even in the uncoupled, R\n0 \nconformation may be an evolutionary adaptation that helps to ensure a response to even minimal increases in the ligand's concentration. By contrast, PTHrP, as a paracrine factor, acts on cells within the same tissue in which it is produced (e.g., the growth-plate chondrocytes of developing long bones). The concentrations of PTHrP in such tissues have not been directly quantified, but they appear to form a gradient across the zones of differentiating cells and high near the sites of production (Chen et al., \nJ. Bone Miner. Res. \n21:113-123 (2006)). It may be that, as an adaptation for its role in controlling the differentiation events that occur in these cells, PTHrP evolved to bind to the receptor only transiently, so as to induce a relatively short-lived, and more easily timed, signaling response.\n\n\n \nG-Protein-Coupled Receptors\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention can use any G-protein-coupled receptor. Long-acting and short-lived ligands may be assayed as described herein and useful therapeutic candidates identified. Hundreds of such receptors are known in the art; see, e.g., Fredriksson et al., \nMol. Pharmacol. \n63:1256-1272, 2003, which is hereby incorporated by reference. This reference has characterized the human GPCRs based on sequence homology and function. Human GPCRs can be broken down into five classes: secretin, rhodopsin, glutamate, frizzled/Tas2, and adhesion. Alternatively, receptors may be classified by their ligands, e.g., peptide hormones or small molecules (e.g., biogenic amines). Other classification schemes include the A-F classification, where class A represents receptors related to rhodopsin and the adrenergic receptors, class B, receptors related to the calcitonin and parathyroid hormone receptors, class C, receptors related to the metabotropic receptors, and classes D-F represent receptors found in fungi and archaebacteria.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsing the Fredriksson classification, the secretin receptors have four main subgroups: the CRHRs/CALCRLs, the PTHRs, GLPRs/GCGR/GIPR and the subgroup including secretin and four other receptors. Secretin receptors include the PTHR, as well as the calcitonin receptor (CALCR), the corticotropin-releasing hormone receptors (CRHRs), the glucagon receptor (GCGR), the gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor (GIPR), the glucagon-like peptide receptors (GLPRs), the growth hormone-releasing hormone receptor (GHRHR), pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating protein (PACAP), the secretin receptor (SCTR), and vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor (VIPR).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe adhesion receptors feature GPCR-like transmembrane-spanning regions fused together with one or several functional domains with adhesion-like motifs in the N terminus, such as EGF-like repeats, mucin-like regions, and conserved cysteine-rich motifs. Members of this family include the CELSRs (EGF LAG seven-pass G-type receptors), the brain-specific angiogenesis-inhibitory receptors (BAIs), the lectomedin receptors (LECs) and the EGF-like module containing (EMRs). Other receptors include the CD97 antigen receptor (CD97) and EGF-TMVII-latrophilin-related (ETL). These receptors also include HE6 (TMVIILN2) and GPR56 (TMVIIXN1 or TMVIILN4) and a group of recently discovered receptors, related to GPR56 and HE6, named GPR97 and GPR110 to GPR116.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe glutamate receptors consists of eight metabotropic glutamate receptors (GRM), two GABA receptors (e.g., GAB-AbR1, which has two splice variants, a and b, and GAB-AbR2), a single calcium-sensing receptor (CASR), and five receptors believed to be taste receptors (TAS1). Other GPCRs include opioid, muscarinic, dopamine, adrenergic, cAMP, opsins, angiotensin, serotonin, thyrotropin, gonadotropin, substance-K, substance-P and substance-R, and melanocortin, metabotropic glutamate receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe largest group is the rhodopsin receptor family, which includes at least 701 human receptors, 241 of which are non-olfactory. Receptors in this group include various acetylcholine (muscarinic) receptors, adrenergic receptors, dopamine receptors, histamine receptors, serotonin receptors, and octopamine receptors; peptide receptors, e.g., angiotensin, bombesin, bradykinin, endothelin, interleukin-8, chemokine, melanocortin, neuropeptide Y, neurotensin, opioid, somatostatin, tachykinin, thrombin, vasopressin, galanin, proteinase-activated, orexin, and chemokine/chemotatic factor receptors; protein hormone receptors, e.g., FSH, lutropin-choriogonadotropic hormone, and thyrotropin receptors; rhodopsin receptors; olfactory receptors; prostanoid receptors; nucleotide-like receptors, including adenosine and purinoceptors; cannabis receptors; platelet activating factor receptor; gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor; melatonin receptor, lysosphingolipid and LPA (EDG) receptors, as well as various orphan receptors.\n\n\n \nCandidate Compounds\n\n\n \n \n \nAny type or source of compound may be used in the screening methods of the invention. For example, naturally occurring chemicals (e.g., from a chemical library), peptides, modified peptide hormones, antibodies, nanobodies, chimeric peptides, and fragments of endogenous ligands (e.g., peptide ligands) may all be used in the present invention. Approaches involving random screening, such as natural libraries of compounds, or designed ligands (e.g., ligands based on the PTH sequence) may be used in the screening methods of the invention. In some embodiments, antibodies or nanobodies can be generated against the GPCR or a ligand binding fragment of the GPRC using methods known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModified Receptor Agonists\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne strategy for identification of new receptor agonists is the modification of existing agonists. Peptide hormones can be modified by point mutations, truncations, insertions, and generation of chimeric peptides. Using the PTH receptor, for example, many modified PTH and PTHrP sequences are known in the art. Peptides can made either recombinantly or synthetically, as is known in the art. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,057,012, 7,022,815, 6,417,333, 6,495,662, hereby incorporated by reference, which describe various PTH sequences, as well as any of those described herein. These sequences can include chimeric peptides. In one particular example, any agonist may be fused to an antibody or antibody fragment (such as an Fc fragment) to generate a candidate therapeutic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies and Nanobodies\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies or nanobodies which bind the GPCR can also be used in the methods of the invention and can be raised against the GPCR or a fragment thereof (e.g., a ligand-binding portion of the GPCR) using any method known in the art. In one example, an IgG directed to a GPCR or fragment thereof can be generated in New Zealand white rabbits using a purified protein. The initial immunization protocol consists of an initial intramuscular injection of 10-20 μg purified protein, followed by a boosting \nimmunization\n 21 days later. Further boosts and/or the addition of adjuvant may be used if no or few antibodies are detected. Antibodies may be quantified by ELISA, analogous to that described (Siber et al., J. Infect. Dis. 152:954-964, 1985; Warren et al., J. Infect. Dis. 163:1256-1266, 1991). IgG may be purified from the rabbit antiserum, for example, by precipitation in 50% ammonium sulfate followed by affinity chromatography on Protein G sepharose 4B (Pharmacia). Monoclonal antibodies to GPCRs can be produced using hybridoma technology. Nanobodies can be generated by immunization of an animal (e.g., a camel or llama) which produce nanobodies, which can then be purified using standard techniques. These antibodies or nanobodies would be screened as described herein for those agonistic molecules that produce long-lived or short-acting effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTest Compounds and Extracts\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, compounds capable of binding a GPCR (e.g., PTHR) are identified from large libraries of both natural product or synthetic (or semi-synthetic) extracts or chemical libraries according to methods known in the art. Those skilled in the field of drug discovery and development will understand that the precise source of test extracts or compounds is not critical to the screening procedure(s) of the invention. Accordingly, virtually any number of chemical extracts or compounds can be screened using the methods described herein. Examples of such extracts or compounds include, but are not limited to, plant-, fungal-, prokaryotic- or animal-based extracts, fermentation broths, and synthetic compounds, as well as modification of existing compounds. Numerous methods are also available for generating random or directed synthesis (e.g., semi-synthesis or total synthesis) of any number of chemical compounds, including, but not limited to, saccharide-, lipid-, peptide-, and polynucleotide-based compounds. Synthetic compound libraries are commercially available. Alternatively, libraries of natural compounds in the form of bacterial, fungal, plant, and animal extracts are commercially available. In addition, natural and synthetically produced libraries are produced, if desired, according to methods known in the art, e.g., by standard extraction and fractionation methods. Furthermore, if desired, any library or compound is readily modified using standard chemical, physical, or biochemical methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, those skilled in the art of drug discovery and development readily understand that methods for dereplication (e.g., taxonomic dereplication, biological dereplication, and chemical dereplication, or any combination thereof) or the elimination of replicates or repeats of materials already known for their activity in treating metabolic disorders should be employed whenever possible.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen a crude extract is found to bind the GPCR in its RG state, and either exhibits altered binding (e.g., higher affinity or lower affinity) as compared to the endogenous ligand when the receptor is in its R\n0 \nstate, further fractionation of the positive lead extract is necessary to isolate chemical constituents responsible for the observed effect. Thus, the goal of the extraction, fractionation, and purification process is the characterization and identification of a chemical entity within the crude extract having activity that may be useful in treating a metabolic disorder (e.g., diabetes and obesity). Methods of fractionation and purification of such heterogenous extracts are known in the art. If desired, compounds shown to be useful agents in the screening methods of the invention are chemically modified according to methods known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch test compounds include naturally occurring or synthetic chemical compounds, (including small molecules) as well as amino acid or nucleic acid aptamers. Any of these compounds may include synthetic or modified amino acids or nucleic acids.\n\n\n \n \nContacting a Receptor with a Candidate Compound\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the screening method of the present invention, a candidate compound is contacted with a GPCR. The receptor may be found on a cell (e.g., in an organism), or a in a membrane preparation. Alternatively, the receptor may be isolated in functional form (Shimada et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n277:31,774-31780, 2002).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCells which either naturally express the GPCR of interest (e.g., PTHR) or express the receptor recombinantly can be used in the methods of the invention. Alternatively, or in addition, the cells can be tranfected (e.g., using any method known in the art) to express a recombinant gene encoding the GPCR. Cells expressing a particular GPCR can also be obtained commercially, for example, from Millipore (ChemiScreen™ cell lines).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the receptor is present in a membrane preparation (e.g., cell free) which contains the GPCR of interest. Such preparations are commercially available; see, e.g., the ChemiSCREEN™ receptor preparations available from Millipore. Membrane preparations can also be produced using methods known in the art (see, e.g., Mills et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n263:13-16, 1988).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf purified receptor components are utilized, candidate compound are contacted with the receptor or receptor complex in vitro.\n\n\n \nAssay Readout—Measuring Ligand Binding or Activity\n\n\n \n \n \nAny method for analysis of ligand binding or ligand activity may be used in the methods of the invention; the particular readout is not critical. In some embodiments, ligand binding to the GPCR is measured by displacement of a radiolabeled ligand by a non-labeled compound and measuring the radioactivity of the cell or membrane preparation before and after treatment with the non-labeled compound. In general, this approach involves incubating the membranes and radioligand to allow complex formation. Dissociation phase can be initiated by the addition of excess unlabeled compound. Immediately prior to the addition (t=0), and at successive time-points thereafter, aliquots can be withdrawn and immediately processed by vacuum filtration. Non-specific binding is determined in parallel reaction tubes containing the unlabeled compound in both the pre-incubation and dissociation phases. The specifically bound radioactivity at each time point can be calculated as a percent of the radioactivity specifically bound at t=0. Such dissociation methods are well suited to large scale screening (e.g., libraries of candidate compounds).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs described in Example 1 below, other methods such as FRET can also be used to measure ligand binding to a receptor. In one application, two fluorescent molecules are conjugated to the receptor such that ligand binding results in a conformational change in the receptor that can be detected by a change in FRET signal. FRET allows for real time measurement of ligand binding and is thus useful in the assays of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther readouts include measurements of cAMP activity including the delayed cAMP activity assay described herein, which indirectly measures binding of the compound to the RG form of the receptor. Intracellular cAMP levels can be measured using a radioimmuno assay, e.g., as described by Shimizu et al. (\nJ. Biol. Chem. \n276:49003-49012 (2001)). Briefly, this method includes treatment with a candidate compound, rinsing with 0.5 ml of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl\n2\n, 5% heat-inactivated horse serum, 0.5% fetal bovine serum, adjusted to pH 7.7 with HCl), and treating with 200 μl of cAMP assay buffer (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 35 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4) and 100 μl of binding buffer containing varying amounts of the candidate compound (final volume=300 μl). The medium can then be removed after incubation for 30-60 min at room temperature. The cells can then be frozen, lysed with 0.5 \nml\n 50 mM HCl, and refrozen (at −80° C.). The cAMP content of the diluted lysate can be determined by radioimmunoassay. The EC\n50 \nresponse values can be calculated using nonlinear regression.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny suitable physiological change that affects GPCR activity can be used to assess the influence of a test compound on GPCR activity. When the functional consequences are determined using intact cells or animals, a variety of effects such as transmitter release, hormone release, transcriptional changes to both known and uncharacterized genetic markers (e.g., northern blots), changes in cell metabolism such as cell growth or pH changes, and changes in intracellular second messengers such as Ca\n++\n, IP\n3\n, or cAMP, can also be measured.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the changes in intracellular cAMP can be measured using immunoassays. The method described in Offermanns and Simon, \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n270:15175-15180 (1995), may be used to determine the level of cAMP. Assay kits for measuring cAMP as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,115,538, herein incorporated by reference, can also be used. Other assays that may be used include measuring in vivo changes in serum/urinary calcium, phosphate, and markers of bone-turnover (e.g., deoxypridonoline crosslinks), decreases in serum reciprocal changes in urine.\n\n\n \nMeasuring R\n0 \nor RG Binding\n\n\n \n \n \nThe methods of the present invention involve measurement of binding of a candidate compound to the RG or R\n0 \nform of the GPCR (e.g., PTHR). Thus, the readout of the assay can distinguish between the affinity of the compound for each form of the receptor. One possible approach is to use a system or condition where one receptor conformation is favored. R\n0 \ncan be favored, for example, by forced dissociation of the GPCR from its G-protein, or using a system that lacks G-proteins. One manner in which dissociation of the GPCR from G-proteins can be achieved is by treatment with a compound that prevents binding of the G-protein to its GPCR. Such compounds include nucleotide analogs such non-hydrolyzable nucleotide analogs including GTPγS. GTPγS binds the G-protein, but as it is unable to hydrolize this compound, the G-protein cannot recycle itself back on the GPCR. Thus, by contacting a cell or cell membrane with GTPγS prior to addition of the candidate compound, it is possible to generate a system in which the R\n0 \nstate of the GPCRs is highly favored.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo stabilize the RG form of the GPCR, dominant-negative G-proteins can be used. These proteins bind the GPCR in a stable manner, and thus enrich for the RG conformation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther approaches to modulate the ratio between R\n0 \nand RG include using cells from animals in which expression of one or more G-proteins has been downregulated or eliminated. Genetic knockout technologies are well known in the art and can be used to target specific G-proteins (see, e.g., Dean et al., \nMol. Endocrinol. \n20:931-943 (2006)). In other embodiments, RNAi techniques (e.g., administration of siRNA to a cell) can be used to “knock down” expression of G-proteins, thereby favoring the R\n0 \nstate of the receptor. Alternatively, it may be possible to favor the RG form by overexpressing the appropriate G protein or G-proteins in a cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA second approach for measuring the ability of a compound to bind either the R\n0 \nor RG state involves displacement of a ligand known to be selective for a particular state. In the case of the PTH receptor, previous work has shown that \n125\nI-[Aib\n1,3\n,M]PTH(1-15) (SEQ ID NO:126) is selective for the RG state. By measuring ligand displacement by a candidate compound of a such ligand, the binding of the compound to that state can be specifically measured, even if the receptor is present in both the RG and the R\n0 \nstates in the assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds identified in the methods of the invention typically bind to the RG form of the receptor with at least 5%, (e.g., at least 10%, 20%, 50%, 100%, 500%, 1000%, 10,000%) of the activity of an endogenous receptor for either long-acting or short-lived agonists. For example, human PTH binds the human PTHR with an EC50 of about 0.13 nmol. Thus desirable compounds typically bind the hPTHR with at least 10% of this affinity, i.e., at least 1.3 nmol EC50.\n\n\n \nLigands Identified Using the Methods of the Invention\n\n\n \n \n \nUsing the screening methods described herein, we have identified a variety of ligands for the exemplary GPCR, the PTH receptor, representing different combinations of either class of peptide (PTH/PTHrP hybrids) chosen on the basis of their relative R\n0\n/RG selectivity to be either short-acting ligands or long-acting ligands (\nFIGS. 26A and 26B\n). Based on the results of our screening assay, we then tested these peptides for in vitro and in vivo activity to demonstrate proof of concept of the importance of R\n0\n/RG selectivity in determining biological activity of the ligand.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe identified peptides represent proof of concept for the PTH receptor and other GPCRs that R\n0\n/RG selectivity determines biological action in vivo. These peptides include five different classes. A first class is typified by Ile\n5\n-PTHrP, an analog that converts PTHrP to a form with high R\n0 \nselectivity and prolonged action. A second class includes hybrid peptides with high R\n0\n/RG selectivity composed of MPTH(1-11) combined with PTHrP(12-36) or MPTH(1-14) with PTHrP(15-36). These peptides have very prolonged biological activity in vivo. The third type is [His\n5\n,Arg\n19\n]PTH, which illustrates shorter acting biological activity due to its reduced R\n0 \naffinity. A fourth class of compounds is exemplified by Ala\n1\n,Aib\n3\n-M-PTH(1-28) (SEQ ID NO:11), which has a potent R\n0\n-activating activity, as well as striking activity to promote urinary phosphate excretion, a property desirable in the treatment of disorders associated with high phosphate retention. A fifth class is typified by Ala\n23\n-PTH, which has a much lower R\n0 \naffinity and therefore more desirable for the treatment of osteoporosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the PTH receptor ligands, we have identified ligands with variety of R\n0 \nand RG binding affinities and various R\n0\n/RG selectivities. Exemplary peptides, sorted by R\n0 \naffinity are shown in \nFIG. 26B\n. The affinity for the R\n0 \nform of the receptor may be at least 2000, 1000, 750, 500, 250, 150, 100, 90, 75, 50, 40, 30, 25, 20, 15, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2.5, 2, 1.5, 1, 0.5, 0.2, 0.1, or 0.05 nmol. The affinity for the RG form of the receptor may be at least 100, 50, 25, 20, 15, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2.5, 2, 1.75, 1.5, 0.125, 1, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.25, 0.2, 0.15, 0.1, 0.075, 0.05, 0.025 nmol. The selectivity of R\n0\n/RG may be (where a higher values indicates greater RG-selectivity) at least 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 75, 100, 150, 200, 250, 400, 500, 750, 1000, 1250, 1500, 2000, 2500, or 5000. Ligands of the invention may have any of the RG or R\n0 \naffinities described herein, or any combination thereof.\n\n\n \nRG and R\n0 \nSelective Ligands\n\n\n \n \n \nUsing the screening methods described herein, we have developed new RG selective and R\n0 \nselective ligands. In one example, we used PTHrP(1-28) (SEQ ID NO:151) as a starting point, as PTHrP binds to the RG receptor conformation with greater selectivity as compared to PTH. Table 2 summarizes the in vitro activities of particular analogs; additional analogs are shown in Table 3. More detailed information regarding these analogs are described below in Example 3. These analogs, A(E)18, A22, (L25), K26-PTHrP(1-28) or (1-30) generally exhibit enhanced potency for cAMP generation, and bind with relatively high selectivity to the RG conformation, as compared to PTHrP(1-36) (Table 2).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn vitro activities of representative PTHrP analogs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n

The fusion protein may include a fusion partner such as a purification or detection tag, for example, proteins that may be detected directly or indirectly such as green fluorescent protein, hemagglutinin, or alkaline phosphatase), DNA binding domains (for example, GAL4 or LexA), gene activation domains (for example, GAL4 or VP16), purification tags, or secretion signal peptides (e.g., preprotyrypsin signal sequence). In other embodiments the fusion partner may be a tag, such as c-myc, poly histidine, or FLAG. Each fusion partner may contain one or more domains, e.g., a preprotrypsin signal sequence and FLAG tag. In other cases, the fusion partner is an Fc protein (e.g., mouse Fc or human Fc).\n\n\n \nMethods of Treatment of Disease\n\n\n \n \n \nAny disease associated with PTH dysfunction, or calcium or phosphate imbalances, can be treated with any of the peptides described herein, including those in \nFIGS. 26A and 26B\n, those of Table 1, or those identified using the methods of the invention. The peptides may be used to treat osteoporosis, fracture repair, osteomalacia, arthritis, thrombocytopenia, hypoparathyroidism or hyperphosphatemia or may be used to increase stem cell mobilization in a subject. Any mode of administration (e.g., oral, intravenous, intramuscular, ophthalmic, topical, dermal, subcutaneous, and rectal) can be used in the treatment methods of the invention. A physician will determine appropriate dosing for the patient being treated, which will depend in part on the size of the patient, the severity of the disease or condition, and the particular disease or condition being treated.\n\n\n \nFormulation of Pharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\n \n \n \nThe administration of any compound described herein (e.g., PTH-derived peptides) or identified using the methods of the invention may be by any suitable means that results in a concentration of the compound that treats the subject disease condition. The compound may be contained in any appropriate amount in any suitable carrier substance, and is generally present in an amount of 1-95% by weight of the total weight of the composition. The composition may be provided in a dosage form that is suitable for the oral, parenteral (e.g., intravenously or intramuscularly), rectal, cutaneous, nasal, vaginal, inhalant, skin (patch), ocular, or intracranial administration route. Thus, the composition may be in the form of, e.g., tablets, ampules, capsules, pills, powders, granulates, suspensions, emulsions, solutions, gels including hydrogels, pastes, ointments, creams, plasters, drenches, osmotic delivery devices, suppositories, enemas, injectables, implants, sprays, or aerosols. The pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated according to conventional pharmaceutical practice (see, e.g., Remington: \nThe Science and Practice of Pharmacy, \n20th edition, 2000, ed. A. R. Gennaro, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, and \nEncyclopedia of Pharmaceutical Technology\n, eds. J. Swarbrick and J. C. Boylan, 1988-1999, Marcel Dekker, New York).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions may be formulated to release the active compound immediately upon administration or at any predetermined time or time period after administration. The latter types of compositions are generally known as controlled release formulations, which include (i) formulations that create substantially constant concentrations of the agent(s) of the invention within the body over an extended period of time; (ii) formulations that after a predetermined lag time create substantially constant concentrations of the agents of the invention within the body over an extended period of time; (iii) formulations that sustain the agent(s) action during a predetermined time period by maintaining a relatively constant, effective level of the agent(s) in the body with concomitant minimization of undesirable side effects associated with fluctuations in the plasma level of the agent(s) (sawtooth kinetic pattern); (iv) formulations that localize action of agent(s), e.g., spatial placement of a controlled release composition adjacent to or in the diseased tissue or organ; (v) formulations that achieve convenience of dosing, e.g., administering the composition once per week or once every two weeks; and (vi) formulations that target the action of the agent(s) by using carriers or chemical derivatives to deliver the compound to a particular target cell type. Administration of the compound in the form of a controlled release formulation is especially preferred for compounds having a narrow absorption window in the gastro-intestinal tract or a relatively short biological half-life.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny of a number of strategies can be pursued in order to obtain controlled release in which the rate of release outweighs the rate of metabolism of the compound in question. In one example, controlled release is obtained by appropriate selection of various formulation parameters and ingredients, including, e.g., various types of controlled release compositions and coatings. Thus, the compound is formulated with appropriate excipients into a pharmaceutical composition that, upon administration, releases the compound in a controlled manner. Examples include single or multiple unit tablet or capsule compositions, oil solutions, suspensions, emulsions, microcapsules, molecular complexes, microspheres, nanoparticles, patches, and liposomes.\n\n\n \nParenteral Compositions\n\n\n \n \n \nThe composition containing compounds described herein or identified using the methods of the invention may be administered parenterally by injection, infusion, or implantation (subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, or the like) in dosage forms, formulations, or via suitable delivery devices or implants containing conventional, non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and adjuvants. The formulation and preparation of such compositions are well known to those skilled in the art of pharmaceutical formulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions for parenteral use may be provided in unit dosage forms (e.g., in single-dose ampoules), or in vials containing several doses and in which a suitable preservative may be added (see below). The composition may be in form of a solution, a suspension, an emulsion, an infusion device, or a delivery device for implantation, or it may be presented as a dry powder to be reconstituted with water or another suitable vehicle before use. Apart from the active agent(s), the composition may include suitable parenterally acceptable carriers and/or excipients. The active agent(s) may be incorporated into microspheres, microcapsules, nanoparticles, liposomes, or the like for controlled release. Furthermore, the composition may include suspending, solubilizing, stabilizing, pH-adjusting agents, tonicity adjusting agents, and/or dispersing agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs indicated above, the pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention may be in a form suitable for sterile injection. To prepare such a composition, the suitable active agent(s) are dissolved or suspended in a parenterally acceptable liquid vehicle. Among acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, water adjusted to a suitable pH by addition of an appropriate amount of hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide or a suitable buffer, 1,3-butanediol, Ringer's solution, dextrose solution, and isotonic sodium chloride solution. The aqueous formulation may also contain one or more preservatives (e.g., methyl, ethyl, or n-propyl p-hydroxybenzoate). In cases where one of the compounds is only sparingly or slightly soluble in water, a dissolution enhancing or solubilizing agent can be added, or the solvent may include 10-60% w/w of propylene glycol or the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following examples are intended to illustrate rather than limit the invention.\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\nIdentification of Short-Lived and Long-Acting PTH Peptides\n\n\n \n \n \nCharacterization of ligands using a competitive binding assay. To identify PTHR ligands, kinetic dissociation experiments were first performed to examine the stability of complexes formed between PTH and PTHrP radioligand analogs and the human PTHR expressed in membranes prepared from HKRK-B7 cells. For each radioligand, dissociation was examined in the presence and absence of GTPγS, so as to assess the effects of functionally uncoupling the receptor from heterotrimeric G proteins (\nFIGS. 1A-1C\n). For \n125\nI-PTH(1-34) and \n125\nI-PTHrP(1-36) (\nFIGS. 1A and 1B\n, respectively), the dissociation data, both in the absence and presence of GTPγS (solid and open symbols, respectively), were better fit by a two-phase decay equation than by a single-phase equation. For \n125\nI-PTH(1-34) and in the absence of GTPγS, 17% of the complexes were unstable and decayed rapidly (t\n1/2\n<1 min), whereas the remaining 83% were stable and decayed slowly (t\n1/2\n˜4 h). Upon the addition of GTPγS, the rapid, unstable component increased to 21%, such that 77% of the complexes remained stable (t\n1/2\n˜2 h) (\nFIG. 1A\n). These findings with \n125\nI-PTH(1-34) agree closely with previous dissociation studies performed on this radioligand, and highlight the capacity of PTH(1-34) to bind to a high affinity, G protein-uncoupled PTHR conformation)(R\n0 \n(Shimizu et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n280:1797-807 (2005); Dean et al., \nMol. Endocrinol. \n20:931-43 (2006)). The complexes formed with \n125\nI-PTHrP(1-36) and the PTHR were again mostly stable in the absence of GTPγS (68% decayed with a t\n1/2 \nof ˜3 h). By contrast, most of the complexes became unstable upon addition of GTPγS (72% decayed with a t\n1/2 \nof ˜1 minute; \nFIG. 1B\n). This rapid dissociation of \n125\nI-PTHrP(1-36) from the PTHR induced by GTPγS addition mirrors that observed previously for \n125\nI-[Aib\n1,3\n,M]PTH(1-15) (Dean et al., \nMol. Endocrinol. \n20:931-43 (2006)); each of these radioligands thus appears to bind predominantly to the PTHR in a G protein-coupled conformation (RG).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe structural differences in PTH(1-34) and PTHrP(1-36) that underlie the functional differences seen for the two ligands in the above dissociation studies then identified. The divergent residues at \nposition\n 5 in PTH and PTHrP (Ile and His, respectively) have been shown to play important roles in determining the affinity (Shimizu et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n280:1797-807 (2005); Gardella et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n270:6584-6588 (1995)) and subtype selectivity (Gardella et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n271:19888-19893 (1996); Behar et al., \nEndocrinology \n137:4217-4224 (1996)) with which these ligands bind to the receptor. The receptor-dissociation properties of \n125\nI-Ile\n5\n-PTHrP(1-36) were examined, again in the absence and presence of GTPγS. This radioligand dissociated from the receptor slowly, both in the presence and absence of GTPγS, and, in each case, with mono-phasic kinetics (t\n1/2\n>2 h; \nFIG. 1C\n). Thus, the His\ns \nIle substitution markedly enhanced the stability with which PTHrP binds to the PTHR, in the G protein-coupled, and especially in the G protein-uncoupled state.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEffects of GTPγS on equilibrium binding. The effects of GTPγS on the binding of these radioligands to the PTHR under approximate-equilibrium conditions was assessed by incubating with cell membranes for 90 minutes in the absence or presence of GTPγS at varying concentrations. The binding of \n125\nI-PTH(1-34) and \n125\nI-Ile\n5\n-PTHrP(1-36) to membranes prepared from HKRK-B7 cells was largely unaffected by GTPγS (<˜20% inhibition at 1×10\n−4 \nM GTPγS), whereas the binding of \n125\nI-PTHrP(1-36) was strongly inhibited by GTPγS (˜70% inhibition at 1×10\n−7 \nM GTPγS; IC\n50\n=1×10\n−9 \nM; \nFIG. 2A\n). To assess binding to the rat PTHR, parallel studies were performed using membranes prepared from the rat osteoblastic cell line ROS17/2.8, which endogenously expresses the rat PTHR. As with the human PTHR in HKRK-B7 cell membranes, the binding of \n125\nI-Ile\n5\n-PTHrP(1-36) to rat PTHR likewise was largely insensitive to GTPγS (\nFIG. 2B\n). The binding of \n125\nI-PTH(1-34) to the rat PTHR appeared more sensitive to GTPγS than was its binding to the human PTHR (\nFIG. 2A\n vs. \n2\nB), although the majority of the binding was resistant to the nucleotide analog. As for the human PTHR, GTPγS strongly inhibited the binding of \n125\nI-PTHrP(1-36) to the rat PTHR, which was as sensitive to the nucleotide analog as the binding of \n125\nI-[Aib\n1,3\n,M]PTH(1-15) (\nFIG. 2B\n). Thus, PTH(1-34) and Ile\n5\n-PTHrP(1-36) bind more strongly to the G protein-uncoupled conformation of the PTHR)(R\n0 \nthan does PTHrP(1-36) or [Aib\n1,3\n,M]PTH(1-15). By contrast, the later two peptides bind preferentially to the G protein-coupled conformation, RG. Competition methods were then used to analyze the relative affinities with which PTH and PTHrP ligands bind to the RG and R\n0 \nreceptor conformations of the PTHR. To assess binding to RG, \n125\nI-[Aib\n1,3\n,M]PTH(1-15) was used as a tracer radioligand, as this peptide binds predominantly to RG. Membranes were prepared from COS-7 cells co-transfected with the hPTHR and a negative-dominant Gα\ns \nsubunit (Gα\ns\nND), which enriches for RG, related to R and R\n0\n, as described previously (Dean et al., \nMol. Endocrinol. \n20:931-943 (2006); Berlot, C. H., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n277:21080-21085 (2002); Dean et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n281:32485-32495 (2006)). To assess binding to R\n0\n, \n125\nI -PTH(1-34) was used as a radioligand (binds predominantly to R\n0\n). Membranes were prepared from COS-7 cells transfected with the hPTHR alone. GTPγS (1×10\n−5\n) was added to the binding reactions so as to functionally uncouple receptor-heterotrimeric G protein complexes, thus enriching for the R\n0 \n(and R) conformations, relative to RG. The relative apparent affinities obtained for several unlabeled PTH and PTHrP ligand were then compared in these two assays, to assess the selectivity with which each of the ligands bound to the R\n0 \nvs. RG PTHR conformation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPTH(1-34) bound to the R\n0 \nconformation with a five-fold weaker affinity than it did to the RG conformation (IC\n50\n=4.2 nM vs. 0.86 nM, P=0.0002; \nFIG. 3A\n, Table 5). PTHrP(1-36) exhibited greater selectivity as it bound to R\n0 \nwith a 66-fold weaker affinity than it did to RG (P=0.04; \nFIG. 3B\n; Table 5). Thus its selectivity for RG (vs. R\n0\n) was 13-fold greater than that of PTH(1-34). Reciprocal exchange of \nresidue\n 5 in the ligands reversed this pattern of conformational selectivity; thus, His\n5\n-PTH(1-34) bound to R\n0 \nwith a 750-fold weaker affinity than it did to RG, and Ile\n5\n-PTHrP(1-36) bound to R\n0 \nwith only a three-fold weaker affinity than it did to RG (P<0.002; \nFIGS. 3C and 3D\n; Table 5).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompetition binding to the RG and R\n0\n conformations of\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe human PTH receptor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nRG\n\n\n \n\n\nR\n0\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ ID\n\n\n \n125\nI-PTH(1-15) +\n\n\n \n\n\n \n125\nI-PTH(1-34) +\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNO:\n\n\nG\nS\nND\n\n\nn\n\n\nGTPγS\n\n\nn\n\n\nR0:RG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Nle\n8,21\n,Tyr\n34\n]rPTH(1-34)NH\n2\n \n\n\n123\n\n\n 0.86 ± 0.24\n\n\n7\n\n\n 4.2 ± 0.5\n\n\n7\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[His\n5\n,Nle\n8,21\n,Tyr\n34\n]rPTH(1-34)NH\n2\n \n\n\n127\n\n\n0.094 ± 0.019\n\n\n4\n\n\n  71 ± 7\n\n\n4\n\n\n753\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Tyr\n36\n]hPTHrP(1-36)NH\n2\n \n\n\n124\n\n\n 0.42 ± 0.09\n\n\n3\n\n\n  28 ± 6\n\n\n3\n\n\n66\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Ile\n5\n,Tyr\n36\n]hPTHrP(1-36)NH\n2\n \n\n\n125\n\n\n 0.92 ± 0.07\n\n\n3\n\n\n 2.9 ± 0.1\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nrPTH(1-34)NH\n2\n \n\n\n130\n\n\n 0.34 ± 0.16\n\n\n3\n\n\n 2.3 ± 0.3\n\n\n3\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[His\n5\n]rPTH(1-34)NH\n2\n \n\n\n185\n\n\n 0.19 ± 0.04\n\n\n5\n\n\n  26 ± 5\n\n\n5\n\n\n138\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nhPTH(1-34)NH\n2\n \n\n\n5\n\n\n 0.39 ± 0.24\n\n\n3\n\n\n 6.6 ± 2.4\n\n\n3\n\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[His\n5\n]hPTH(1-34)NH\n2\n \n\n\n9\n\n\n 0.76 ± 0.04\n\n\n5\n\n\n 122 ± 35\n\n\n5\n\n\n160\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nhPTHrP(1-36)NH\n2\n \n\n\n6\n\n\n 0.59 ± 0.02\n\n\n3\n\n\n  24 ± 3\n\n\n3\n\n\n42\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Aib\n1,3\n,M]rPTH(1-15)NH\n2\n \n\n\n126\n\n\n 0.74 ± 0.18\n\n\n3\n\n\n1029 ± 148\n\n\n3\n\n\n1,397\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Ile\n5\n→His substitution also strongly reduced affinity for R\n0 \nwithout greatly affecting affinity for RG in human-PTH(1-34) and rat-PTH(1-34) peptides that lacked the methionine\n8,21\n→norleucine and Phe\n34 \nTyr\n34 \nsubstitutions of our control PTH(1-34) analog (\nFIGS. 6A\n, \n6\nB, \n6\nD, and \n6\nE and Table 4). Thus, PTH(1-34) binds with higher affinity to R\n0 \nthan does PTHrP(1-36), whereas both PTH(1-34) and PTHrP(1-36) bind with high affinity to the RG PTHR conformation. \nResidue\n 5 in the ligand plays a significant role in modulating the capacity of the ligands to bind to the R\n0 \nversus RG conformations. In addition, residues carboxy-terminal of \nposition\n 15 in PTH(1-34) contribute to the capacity of the ligand to bind strongly to R\n0\n, as shown by [Aib\n1,3\n,M]PTH(1-15), which binds only weakly to R\n0 \nbut maintains strong affinity for RG (\nFIG. 6C\n and Table 4).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDirect recording of PTHR activation. The fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) approach has recently been used to assess, in real time and in intact cells, the processes of ligand binding and receptor activation for the PTHR. This approach was therefore used as an independent means to compare the time courses by which PTH and PTHrP ligands interact with the PTHR. The approach used exploits an intramolecular FRET signal that occurs in a human PTHR construct, PTHR-CFP\nIC3\n/YFP\nCT \n(formerly called PTHR-cam). This construct contains cyan-fluorescent protein (CFP) in the third intracellular loop and yellow-fluorescent protein (YFP) in the carboxy-terminal tail. A FRET signal is produced by PTHR-CFP\nIC3\n/YFP\nCT \nin the basal state, and this signal diminishes upon agonist binding, likely due to conformational change that occurs upon activation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nhPTH(1-34) induced a rapid (t\n1/2\n=0.7 sec) reduction (−13%) in the FRET signal produced by cells expressing PTHR-CFP\nIC3\n/YFP\nCT \n(\nFIG. 4A\n). The FRET signal remained suppressed during the 15 seconds of ligand application, as well as for at least 60 seconds after the ligand-containing buffer was exchanged for a ligand-free buffer (ligand application times are marked by the black horizontal line above the graphs in \nFIGS. 4A-4C\n). The FRET response profile obtained for hPTH(1-34) replicates the profile observed for this ligand in previous FRET studies (Vilardaga et al., \nNat. Biotechnol. \n21:807-812 (2003)). The amino-terminal peptide, [Aib\n1,3\n,M]PTH(1-14), induced a FRET response with slightly faster kinetics (t\n1/2\n=0.5 sec) and with a shallower magnitude (˜5%) than that produced by hPTH(1-34) (\nFIG. 4B\n). Moreover, the FRET response produced by [Aib\n1,3\n,M]PTH(1-15) began to decay immediately upon exchange of the buffer to a ligand-free one (\nFIG. 4B\n). PTHrP(1-36) induced a relatively slow FRET response (t\n1/2\n=˜2 to 5 seconds), and the signal began to decay immediately upon changing to a ligand-free buffer (\nFIG. 4C\n). The Ile\n5\n-substituted ligand Ile\n5\n-PTHrP(1-36) induced a FRET signal that was remarkably similar to that of PTH(1-34), in that the response was rapid (t\n1/2\n=0.5-0.7 sec), and stable after ligand removal (\nFIG. 4D\n). These kinetic data, derived by a spectroscopic approach, fully agree with those obtained in the above binding radioligand dissociation assays, thus indicating that PTH(1-34) and PTHrP(1-36) bind predominantly to distinct conformations of the PTHR. They also confirm the important role of residue five in the ligands in contributing to this conformational selectivity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \ncAMP measurements in HKRK-B7 cells. Given that LR\n0 \ncomplexes can isomerize to LRG complexes, a potential consequence of stable binding of a ligand to R\n0 \nis a prolongation of the signaling response induced by that ligand, relative to a ligand that only poorly stabilizes R\n0\n. To examine this possibility, the capacity of PTH and PTHrP ligands to produce sustained cAMP responses in PTHR-expressing cells was assessed. Cells were thus treated with a ligand for ten minutes, washed to remove unbound ligand. At various times after washing, IBMX was applied for five minutes, and the resulting intracellular cAMP was measured. Using this approach, only the cAMP produced during the final, five minute IBMX incubation phase is measurable. The experiments of \nFIG. 5A\n compare the time courses of the cAMP responses produced by PTHrP(1-36) and Ile\n5\n-PTHrP(1-36) in HKRK-B7 cells. Immediately after the wash-out step, cells treated with either ligand produced approximately the same amount of cAMP, which was ˜100-fold above the basal cAMP level in untreated cells. Two hours after the wash-out step, the cells treated with Ile\n5\n-PTHrP(1-36) maintained a cAMP signaling capacity that was ˜50% of the signaling capacity seen immediately after ligand wash-out (\nFIG. 5A\n). By contrast, the signaling capacity of cells treated with PTHrP(1-36) at two hours was ˜19% of the initial response, and thus ˜65% less than the response observed at two hours for Ile\n5\n-PTHrP(1-36) (P<0.003). PTH(1-34) produced responses at each time point that were nearly identical to those produced by Ile\n5\n-PTHrP(1-36) (P=>0.05, data not shown). Thus, the cAMP signaling responses induced by PTH(1-34) and Ile\n5\n-PTHrP(1-36) decayed about twice as slowly as did that of and PTHrP(1-36) (t\n1/2\n=˜2 h vs. ˜1 h). These differences in the duration of the cAMP signaling capacity observed for the PTH and PTHrP analogs parallel the differences seen in the rates with which the corresponding radioligands dissociated from the PTHR in the presence of GTPγS (\nFIGS. 1A-1C\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \ncAMP measurements in HKRK-B64 cells. The capacity of the ligands to produce sustained (or delayed) cAMP signaling responses was further examined in HKRK-B64 cells, which express the hPTHR at a more physiological level than do HKRK-B7 cells (90,000 per cell vs. 950,000/cell). Time course experiments indicated that differences in the duration of ligand-induced signaling responses were best resolved in these \ncells\n 60 minutes after ligand wash-out (data not shown). In these experiments, a maximum response was determined for each peptide by incubating the cells concomitantly with ligand and IBMX for 10 minutes (no wash-out phase); the cAMP responses observed at 60 minutes after ligand washout were then expressed as a percentile of the corresponding maximum response.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs in HKRK-B7 cells, PTH(1-34) and Ile\n5\n-PTHrP(1-36) produced cAMP responses at 60 minutes after wash-out that were 47% and 40% of their corresponding maximum responses, respectively, in HKRK-B64 cells (\nFIG. 5B\n). The analogs His\n5\n-PTH(1-34) and PTHrP(1-36) produced responses at 60 minutes that were 34% and 19% of their maximum response. The response induced by [Aib\n1,3\n,M]PTH(1-15) at two hours was 23% of its maximum response, and thus was comparable to that of PTHrP(1-36) (P=0.7). Different PTH and PTHrP ligand analogs that exhibit the same or comparable activities when assessed in acute dose-response signaling assays (\nFIG. 7\n; Table 6), can produce quantitatively different cumulative signaling responses in cells, that are most likely due to the capacity of the ligands to form a stable complex with the receptor.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\ncAMP and IP signaling properties of PTH and PTHrP ligands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ\n\n\ncAMP in HKRK-B64 cells \na\n \n\n\nIP in COS-7/hPTHR cells \nc\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nID\n\n\nEC\n50\n \n\n\nE\nmax\n \nb\n \n\n\nEC\n50\n \n\n\nE\nmax\n \nd\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNO:\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\n(picomole/well)\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\n(cpm/well)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Nle\n8,21\n,Tyr\n34\n]rPTH(1-34)NH\n2\n \n\n\n123\n\n\n5.1 ± 0.5\n\n\n55 ± 12\n\n\n18 ± 3\n\n\n2,407 ± 138\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[His\n5\n,Nle\n8,21\n,Tyr\n34\n]rPTH(1-34)NH\n2\n \n\n\n127\n\n\n2.7 ± 0.6\n e\n \n\n\n59 ± 12\n\n\n30 ± 12\n\n\n2,231 ± 229\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Tyr\n36\n]hPTHrP(1-36)NH\n2\n \n\n\n124\n\n\n5.6 ± 1.3\n\n\n62 ± 15\n\n\n23 ± 8\n\n\n2,514 ± 270\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Ile\n5\n,Tyr\n36\n]hPTHrP(1-36)\nNH\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n125\n\n\n5.4 ± 1.9\n\n\n61 ± 14\n\n\n23 ± 7\n\n\n2,793 ± 303\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \na \ndata are means (±s.e.m.) from four experiments;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nb \nbasal camp (not subtracted) was 5.2 ± 0.9 pmole/well).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nc \ndata are means (±s.e.m.) from five experiments;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nd \nbasal IP value (not subtracted) was 330 ± 8 cpm/well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \ne\n, P vs. [Nle\n8,21\n,Tyr\n34\n]rPTH(1-34)NH\n2 \n= 0.02.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \ncAMP measurements in rat osteoblastic cells.

Thus, treating OK cells with PTH(1-34) inhibits their uptake of phosphate from the culture media.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBrief (10 minute) exposure of the cells to A\n1\n,Aib\n3\n,M-PTH(1-28) results in a dramatically prolonged inhibitory effect on phosphate uptake, whereas PTH(1-34) and hPTHrP(1-36) peptides exhibit a much shorter duration of phosphate uptake inhibition (\nFIG. 11\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmacokinetics and hypercalcemic action of PTHR ligands in normal rats. Pharmacokinetic profiles of iv injected PTHrP(1-36) and [I\n5\n]-PTHrP(1-36) were investigated in normal rats (\nFIG. 12\n). Both PTHrP(1-36) and [I\n5\n]-PTHrP(1-36) rapidly disappeared from the circulation, and the pharmacokinetic profile of [I\n5\n]-PTHrP(1-36) was comparable to that of PTHrP(1-36).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe also measured the calcemic actions of intravenously injected PTHrP(1-36) and [I\n5\n]-PTHrP(1-36) in normal rats (\nFIG. 13\n). PTHrP(1-36) and [I\n5\n]-PTHrP(1-36) at 20 and 80 nmol/kg increased blood ionized calcium levels to the same extent at one hour. Blood ionized calcium levels declined at two hours after injection with PTHrP(1-36), but were sustained at high levels at two hours after injection with [I\n5\n]-PTHrP(1-36). Thus, [I\n5\n]-PTHrP(1-36) and PTHrP(1-36) exhibited comparable pharmacokinetic profiles (\nFIG. 12\n), but [I\n5\n]-PTHrP(1-36) exhibited a higher binding affinity for the R\n0\nPTHR conformation (\nFIGS. 3 and 6\n). Therefore, the prolonged calcemic actions of [I\n5\n]-PTHrP(1-36) observed in vivo can best be explained by its high R\n0 \nbinding affinity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn vitro and in vivo screening of PTH or PTHrP analogs with human PTH receptor. We designed and synthesized native PTH-PTHrP hybrid analogs, and [A\n1,3,12\n,Q\n10\n,R\n11\n,W\n14\n] (M-modified) PTH-PTHrP hybrid analogs, and tested their cAMP signaling capacities in HKRK-B7 cells expressing the hPTH receptor. Each of the native, and M-modified PTH/PTHrP hybrid analogs showed cAMP signaling activity comparable to hPTH(1-34) (\nFIG. 25\n). We assessed affinity of native or M-modified PTH and PTHrP hybrid analogs for the R\n0 \nand RG states of the human PTH receptor (\nFIGS. 26A and 26B\n) in COS-7 cell membranes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHypercakemic action of PTH and PTHrP analogs in normal and TPTX rats. The transient calcemic actions of the native and M-modified PTH-PTHrP hybrid analogs were evaluated in normal and TPTX rats using PTH(1-34) and PTHrP(1-36) as controls (\nFIGS. 13A\n, \n14\nA, \n15\nA, \n15\nB, \n16\nA, \n17\nA, and \n18\nA). I\n5\n-PTHrP(1-36), MPTH(1-14)/PTHrP(15-36), PTH(1-14)/PTHrP(15-36), PTH(1-18)/PTHrP(19-36), M-PTH(1-34) showed higher calcemic actions than did PTH(1-34); in contrast, PTH(1-22)/PTHrP(23-36) and PTH(1-26)/PTHrP(27-36) showed weaker calcemic actions than did either PTH(1-34) or PTHrP(1-36) control peptides. Binding to the rat PTHR was also measured in vitro. Length of signaling activity was confirmed using the delayed cAMP assay (\nFIGS. 13B-13C\n, \n14\nB-\n14\nC, \n15\nB, \n16\nB-\n16\nC, \n17\nB-\n17\nC, and \n18\nB), which clearly demonstrates a correlation between the R\n0\n/RG selectivity from binding data shown in vitro and both the hypercalcemic action in vivo as well as and delayed cAMP response in vitro. The cAMP signaling of all these peptides did not vary substantially (\nFIGS. 19A\n, \n19\nB, \n20\nA, and \n20\nB).\n\n\n \nMaterials and Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following materials and methods were used to perform the above experiments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptides. The peptides used in \nFIGS. 1-3\n, and \n5\n-\n11\n were synthesized by the M.G.H. Biopolymer Core facility, as described in Shimizu et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n276:49003-49012 (2001). These peptides include [Nle\n8,21\n,Tyr\n34\n]rat(r)PTH(1-34)NH\n2 \n(PTH(1-34) (SEQ ID NO:123); [Aib\n1,3\n,Nle\n8\n,Gln\n10\n,homoarginine\n11\n,Ala\n12\n,Trp\n14\n,Tyr\n15\n]rPTH(1-15)NH\n2 \n([Aib\n1,3\n,M]PTH(1-15), SEQ ID NO:126); [Ala\n1,12\n,Aib\n3\n,Gln\n10\n,homoarginine\n11\n,Trp\n14\n,Arg\n19\n]human(h)PTH(1-28)NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:11) {[Ala\n1\n,Aib\n3\n,M]PTH(1-28)}; [Tyr\n36\n]hPTHrP(1-36)NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:124) {(PTHrP(1-36)}; [Ile\n5\n,Tyr\n36\n]hPTHrP(1-36)NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:125) {Ile\n5\n-PTHrP(1-36)}; hPTH(1-34)NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:5); [His\n5\n]rPTHrP(1-34)NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:9); rPTH(1-34)NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:130) and [His\n5\n]rPTHrP(1-36)NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:10). The hPTH(1-34)COOH peptide (free carboxyl) used in FRET analyses (\nFIG. 4\n) was purchased from Bachem Calif. (Torrance, Calif.). The rat studies used human PTHrP(1-36) synthesized by American Peptide Company, Inc. (California, USA). Human PTH(1-34) was purchased from Peptide Institute Inc (Osaka, Japan). PTH or PTHrP analogs were synthesized by Sigma Aldrich Japan (Tokyo, Japan). Peptides used in rat studies were dissolved at 1 mM in 10 mM acetic acid, and stocked at −80° C. refrigerator.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptides used in \nFIGS. 12-16\n were purchased from either American Peptide Company, Inc., California, USA (hPTHrP(1-36)COOH), Peptide Institute Inc., Osaka, Japan (hPTH(1-34)COOH), or Sigma-Aldrich Japan, Tokyo, Japan (PTH/PTHrP hybrid analogs). All peptides were dissolved in 10 mM acetic acid to a peptide concentration of between 0.1 mM and 4 mM; and stored at −80° C. Peptide purity and quality was verified by analytical high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry. Radiolabeled peptide variants were prepared by the oxidative chloramine-T procedure using Na\n125\nI (specific activity: 2,200 Ci/mmol, Perkin Elmer/NEN Life Science Products, Boston, Mass.) and were purified by reversed-phase HPLC.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCell Culture. Cells were cultured at 37° C. in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO\n2 \nin Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan Utah), 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (Invitrogen Corp. Carlsbad, Calif.). The PTHR-expressing cell lines used were HKRK-B7, HKRK-B64, ROS17/2.8, and HEK-PTHR-cam. The HKRK-B7 and HKRK-B64 lines were derived from the porcine kidney cell line, LLC-PK1, via stable transfection with plasmid DNA (pcDNA1 vector, Invitrogen Corp.) encoding the human PTHR, and express the PTHR at approximate surface densities of 950,000 and 90,000 PTH-binding sites per cell, respectively (Takasu et al., \nJ. Bone Miner. Res. \n14:11-20 (1999)). ROS17/2.8 cells are rat osteosarcoma cells (Majeska et al., \nEndocrinology \n107:1494-1503 (1980)) and express the endogenous rat PTHR at an approximate surface density of 70,000 PTH-binding sites per cell (Yamamoto, I. et al., \nEndocrinology \n122:1208-1217 (1988)). HEK-PTHR-cam cells were derived from HEK-293 cells by stable DNA transfection and express a human PTHR derivative (PTHR-cam) containing cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) inserted at Gly\n395 \nin the third intracellular loop and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) inserted in the carboxy-terminal tail (Vilardaga et al., \nNat. Biotechnol. \n21:807-812 (2003)). Cells were propagated in T75 flasks and divided into 24-well plates for assays with intact cells, six-well plates for membrane preparations, or onto glass cover-slips for FRET studies. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected in six-well plates using Fugene-6 (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis Ind.) and CsCl-purified plasmid DNA encoding the PTHR (3 μl Fugene, 1 μg DNA, per well), or co-transfected with plasmids encoding the PTHR and a negative-dominant Gα\ns \nsubunit Gα\ns\nND (6 μl Fugene, 1 μg each DNA per well). This Gα\ns\nND subunit binds more effectively, but unproductively, to receptors than does wild-type Gα\ns \n(Berlot, C. H. \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n277:21080-21085 (2002)), and has been found to enhance the binding of \n125\nI-[Aib\n1,3\n,M]PTH(1-15)NH\n2 \nradioligand to the PTHR in cell membranes (see below) (Dean, T. et al., J. Biol. Chem. (2006)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBinding Studies. Binding studies were performed using cell membranes as described (Dean et al., \nMol Endocrinol \n20(4):931-43 (2006)). Briefly, reactions were incubated at room temperature in membrane assay buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1 M NaCl, 3 mM MgSO\n4\n, 20% glycerol, 3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, protease inhibitor cocktail—final concentrations: 1 mM AEBSF, 0.8 μM Aprotonin, 20 μM leupeptin, 40 μM Bestatin, 15 μM Pepstatin A, 14 μM E-64-Sigma-Aldrich Inc., St. Louis, Mo.). Reactions contained a total membrane protein concentration of 20 to 100 μg/mL, and a total radioactivity concentration of approximately 150,000 cpm/ml. Unlabeled peptide ligands and/or GTPγS (Sigma-Aldrich Inc. St. Louis, Mo.) were added to the reactions as indicated. At the end of the reaction, bound and free radioligand were separated by vacuum filtration using a 96-well vacuum filter plate and vacuum filter apparatus (Multi-Screen system with Durapore HV, 0.65 μM filters; Millipore Corp., Milford, Mass.); the air-dried filters were then detached from the plate and counted for gamma radioactivity using a gamma counter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRadioligand dissociation. These studies were performed as bulk reactions in 15 mL round-bottom polystyrene snap-cap tubes (Falcon) (total reaction volume=5.0 ml). Membranes and radioligand were pre-incubated for 90 minutes to allow complex formation; the dissociation phase was then initiated by the addition of an excess of the unlabeled analog of the radioligand (5×10\n−7 \nM final concentration), with or without GTPγS (5×10\n−5 \nM). Immediately prior to this addition (t=0), and at successive time-points thereafter, 0.2 ml aliquots (30,000 cpm) were withdrawn and immediately processed by vacuum filtration, as described above. Non-specific binding was determined in parallel reaction tubes containing the unlabeled analog of the radioligand (5×10\n−7 \nM) in both the pre-incubation and dissociation phases. The specifically bound radioactivity at each time point was calculated as a percent of the radioactivity specifically bound at t=0. Equilibrium competition binding and GTPγS inhibition. Binding reactions performed with \n125\nI-Aib\n1,3\n,MPTH(1-15) radioligand were assembled and incubated in the wells of the 96-well, Multi-Screen vacuum filtration plates. Membranes, tracer radioligand, and various concentrations of unlabeled ligands and/or GTPγS were incubated in the wells for 90 minutes, following which, the reaction plates were processed by rapid vacuum filtration to separate bound from free radioligand, as described above. Binding reactions performed with \n125\nI-PTH(1-34) radioligand were assembled and incubated in 96-well polystyrene micro-titer plates (Falcon, total reaction volume=230 μl), and at the end of the incubation were transferred to wells of a 96-well, Multi-Screen vacuum filtration plate and processed, as described above. This transfer maneuver was performed for the \n125\nI-PTH(1-34)-containing reactions to minimize non-specific binding of the radioligand to the Multi-screen filter membranes. For both radioligands, the non-specific binding was determined in reactions containing a saturating concentration of the unlabeled analog of the radioligand. The specifically bound radioactivity was calculated as a percent of the radioactivity specifically bound in the absence of a competing ligand or GTPγS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo assess the capacities of various unlabeled peptide ligands to bind to the G protein-uncoupled and G protein-coupled PTHR conformations (R\n0 \nand RG, respectively), membranes were prepared from transiently transfected COS-7 cells and the following assay conditions. To assess binding to R\n0\n, membranes were prepared from cells transfected with the PTHR, \n125\nI-PTH(1-34) as a tracer radioligand, and GTPγS (1×10\n−5 \nM) was added to the binding reactions. This binding format is based on the premise that \n125\nI-PTH(1-34) binds predominantly to the R\n0 \nconformation of the PTHR, and that this conformation is enriched in the membranes, relative to RG, by the presence of GTPγS (Hoare et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n276:7741-53 (2001); Dean et al., \nMol Endocrinol \n(2006)). To assess binding to RG, membranes prepared from cells co-transfected with the PTHR and a negative dominant Gα\ns \nsubunit (Gα\ns\nND) were used, and \n125\nI-[Aib\n1,3\n,M]PTH(1-15) was used as a tracer radioligand. This binding format is based on the premise that \n125\nI-[Aib\n1,3\n,M]PTH(1-15) binds predominantly to the RG conformation of the PTHR, and that this conformation is enriched in the membranes, relative to R or R\n0\n, by the presence of Gα\ns\n \nND \n(Hoare, S. \nJ. Biol. Chem\n. (2001); Berlot, C. H. \nJ. Biol. Chem\n. (2002); Dean, T. et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem\n. (2006)). Analysis of binding to any low affinity PTHR conformation (R) present in the membrane preparations is precluded by the low concentrations (˜25 μM) of tracer radioligands in the reactions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFluorescent Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). HEK-293 cells stably expressing HEK-PTHR-CFP\nIC3\n/YFP\nCT \n(previously called HEK-PTHR-Cam cells (Vilardaga et al., \nNat. Biotechnol. \n21:807-812 (2003)) were grown on glass coverslips and processed for FRET analysis as described. With these cells, excitation of the CFP (donor) in PTHR-CFP\nIC3\n/YFP\nCT \nwith ultraviolet light (λ\nmax.ex.\n=436 nm; λ\nmax.em.\n=480 nm) produces an intramolecular FRET to the YFP (acceptor), resulting in emission from that YFP (λ\nmax.ex.\n=480 nm, λ\nmax.em.\n=535 nm). This FRET response is observable as a decrease in intensity of CFP light emission at 480 nm, and an increase in intensity of YFP light emission at 535 nm. The FRET signal is produced by PTHR-CFP\nIC3\n/YFP\nCT \nin the ground-state receptor and decreases upon binding of an agonist. PTH ligands were added to the cells, and washed from the cells using a computer-assisted, solenoid valve-controlled, rapid superfusion device (ALA Scientific Instruments, Westbury, N.Y.); solution-exchange times were 5 ms to 10 ms. Fluorescence was monitored using a Zeiss inverted microscope equipped with a 100× objective and a dual emission photometric system (Til Photonics), coupled to an avalanche photodiode detection system and an analog-digital converter (Axon Instruments). The FRET signal detected upon excitation at 436 nm was calculated as the normalized FRET ratio: F\nYFP(535 nm)\n/F\nCFP(480 nm) \nwhere F\nYFP(535 nm) \nis the emission at 535 nm, corrected for spillover of the CFP signal into the YFP channel, and F\nCFP(480nm) \nis the emission at 480 nm, corrected for spillover (minimal) of the YFP emission into the CFP channel. Changes in fluorescence emissions due to photo-bleaching were subtracted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStimulation of Intracellular cAMP. Following treatment of cells with a ligand, the intracellular cAMP levels were measured by radioimmuno assay, as described (Shimizu et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n276:49003-49012 (2001)). The capacities of ligands to produce a delayed cAMP response in cells after a brief exposure to the ligand was assessed as follows. The cells in 24-well plates were rinsed in binding buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl\n2\n, 5% heat-inactivated horse serum, 0.5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum) and then incubated in binding buffer with or without a peptide ligand (1×10\n−7 \nor 3×10 M) for 10 minutes at room temperature; the buffer was then removed, the cells were washed three times with binding buffer, incubated further in binding buffer for varying times (1 to 120 minutes); the buffer was then replaced by binding buffer containing IBMX (2 mM), and after an additional five minute incubation, the intracellular cAMP was quantified. By this approach, which has been used previously for the PTH receptor (Tawfeek, H., and Abou-Samra, A., \nJ. Bone Miner. Res. \n14:SU444 (1999); Biselo et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n277:38524-38530 (2002)), only the cAMP produced during the final IBMX-containing stage of the incubation is measurable, because cAMP produced prior to IBMX addition is degraded by cellular phosphodiesterases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the cAMP experiments of \nFIG. 14\n, HKRK-B7 were seeded in 96 well plates at 1×10\n5 \ncells/well and incubated overnight. On the following day, the cells were washed once with 200 μl of binding buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl\n2\n, 5% heat-inactivated horse serum, 0.5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum), followed by addition of 100 μl cAMP assay buffer (DMEM, 2 mM IBMX, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 35 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4) on ice. Then, 50 μl of binding buffer containing varying amounts of human PTH(1-34), human PTHrP(1-36), or PTH analogs (final volume=150 μl), were added to each well, and placed in a water bath at 37° C., and incubated for 15 minutes. After removing the medium, the plates were placed on powdered dry ice to freeze the cells and then removed from dry ice. The cells were thawed with 50 μl of 50 mM HCl and frozen again on dry ice. The level of intracellular cAMP was measured with a commercially available cAMP EIA kit (Biotrack cAMP EIA system, GE Healthcare).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStimulation of inositol phosphate. The stimulation of intracellular inositol phosphates (IPs) was measured in transiently transfected COS-7 cells that were pre-labeled (16 hours) with \n3\nH-myo-D-inositol (2 μCi/ml). Cells were treated with ligand in DMEM containing fetal bovine serum (10%) and LiCl (30 mM) for 30 minutes; cells were lysed with ice cold trichloro acetic acid (5%) and IPs were extracted from the acid-lysates by ion-exchange filtration, as described (Shimizu et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n276:49003-49012 (2001)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOK cell methods. Cells were treated for 10 minutes at 37° C. with media (vehicle) or media containing a peptide ligand (1×10\n−7 \nM); then (t=0), the cells were then rinsed three times with media and incubated in alone at 37° C. for varying times. At each time point, \n32\nPO\n4 \nwas then added to the media, and after five minutes of incubation, the cells were washed, lysed, and the lysate was counted for \n32\nP beta radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. The results of these experiments are shown in \nFIG. 11\n, plotted as a percentile of the amount of \n32\nP radioactivity in lysates of cells treated for the same time with vehicle alone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nData calculations for in vitro binding and signaling assays. Data were processed for curve fitting and parameter determination using Microsoft Excel and GraphPad Prism 4.0 software packages. Dissociation time course data were analyzed using a bi-exponential decay equation, except when an F test analysis indicated a mono-exponential equation provided a better fit (Palpha>0.02). Data from equilibrium binding, cAMP and IP dose-response assays were analyzed using a sigmoidal dose-response equation with variable slope. This analysis yielded curves for the data and values of EC\n50\n, IC\n50 \n(the concentration of a ligand that produces half of the maximal effect) and E\nmax \n(the maximum response obtained by a ligand). Paired data sets were statistically compared using the Student's t-test (two-tailed) assuming unequal variances for the two sets.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmacokinetic analysis of PTHrP(1-36) and 15-PTHrP (1-36) in normal rats. Concentration of human PTHrP(1-36) and [I\n5\n]-PTHrP(1-36) in stock solution were adjusted by dilution with 25 mmol/L phosphate-citrate buffer/100 mmol/L NaCl/0.05% Tween 80 (pH.5.0) (PC-buffer). Both peptides were allowed to stand on ice immediately before administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFemale SD-IGS rats at 8 weeks of age (Charles River Japan, Inc.) were measured for their body weight. Rats received intravenous administration of Human PTHrP(1-36) and [I\n5\n]-PTHrP(1-36) at a dose of 10 nmol/1 ml/kg. Peptides were administered to groups of 3 rats for each peptide-dose and/or time point. At 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 120 min after administration, blood was collected by tail vein in tubes with EDTA (final 0.2%) and aprotinin (final 0.6 TIU/ml) to monitor the time course of concentration of human PTHrP(1-36) and [I\n5\n]-PTHrP(1-36) in rat plasma. Samples were centrifuged to collect plasma and stored at −80° C., until assayed for human PTHrP(1-36) and [I\n5\n]-PTHrP(1-36) levels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe level of human PTHrP(1-36) and [I\n5\n]-PTHrP(1-36) were determined by EIA analysis using PTH-RP 1-34 (Human, Rat) Enzyme Immunoassay kit (Peninsula Laboratories Inc.) [I\n5\n]-PTHrP(1-36) cross-reacted with PTHrP EIA kit, and [I\n5\n]-PTHrP(1-36) was used as a standard for measurement of the level of [I\n5\n]-PTHrP(1-36) in plasma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHypercalcemic action of human PTH(1-34), PTHrP(1-36) and PTH or PTHrP analogs in normal rats. Human PTH(1-34), PTHrP(1-36), and PTH or PTHrP analogs were studied for hypercalcemic effects in normal rat as follows. Concentration of peptides in stock solution were adjusted by dilution with 25 mmol/L phosphate-citrate buffer/100 mmol/L NaCl/0.05% Tween 80 (pH.5.0) (PC-buffer). All peptides were allowed to stand on ice immediately before administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFemale SD-IGS rat at 8 weeks of age (Charles River Japan, Inc.) were measured for their body weight. Blood was collected by tail vein into heparinized capillary tubes and measured for baseline levels of blood ionized calcium and pH using Ca\n++\n/pH analyzer (Model 634/Bayer Medical Ltd.) to give the corrected level of ionized calcium at pH 7.4 for each sample. Rats received intravenous administration of each peptides at a dose of 1 ml/kg. Peptides were administered to groups of 6 rats each respectively. At 1, 2, 4, or 6 hours after administration, blood was collected by tail vein to monitor the time course of corrected blood ionized calcium levels. The time course of changes in corrected ionized calcium levels, compared to vehicle, and are expressed as means+/−standard error.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStatistical Analysis. Statistical analysis was carried out by analysis of variance (ANOVA), using SAS software. The significance of differences was determined using Student's t-test or Dunnett's multiple test. P<0.05 was considered a statistically significant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCalcemic action of [A\n1,3,12\n,Q\n10\n,R\n11\n,W\n14\n]-hPTH(1-14)/PTHrP(15-36)(MPTH14) in thyroparathyroidectomy rats. Five-week-old male Crl:CD(SD) rats were obtained from Charles River Laboratories Japan, Inc. (Kanagawa, Japan) and acclimated for 1 week under standard laboratory conditions at 20-26° C. and 35-75% humidity. The rats received free access to tap water and standard rodent chow (CE-2) containing 1.1% calcium, 1.0% phosphate and 250 IU/100 g of vitamin D\n3 \n(Clea Japan, Inc., Shizuoka, Japan).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThyroparathyroidectomy (TPTX) was performed on six-week-old rats. TPTX rats were selected for use based on serum ionized calcium (iCa) levels (<1.0 mM) in samples taken from tail vein bleeding at 24 hours or 72 hours after the operation using the electrode method. The TPTX rats were divided into six groups of five animals based on iCa levels at 48 hours after the operation. TPTX-vehicle group intravenously received the vehicle alone (10 mM acetic acid solution) at a dose of 1 ml/kg body weight administered to the tail vein. Human parathyroid hormone (1-34) (hPTH(1-34)) and M-PTH(1-14)/rP(15-36) (MPTH14) were intravenously injected into the TPTX rats at doses of 1.25, 5, 20 nmol/kg (3 groups) and 1.25, 5 nmol/kg (2 groups), respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBlood was obtained from the tail vein for detecting iCa at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours after each injection. Ionized calcium levels were determined by the electrode method using an autoanalyzer (M-634, Chiba Corning Diagnostics Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMouse studies. Wild-type mice were injected subcutaneously with vehicle (0.9% NaCl/0.05% Tween-20), or vehicle containing a PTH peptide at a dose level of 10 to 1000 nmol/kg of body weight. At indicated times after injection, blood was withdrawn from the tail vein, and the amount of cAMP in the resulting plasma was quantified by radioimmuno assay. Ionized calcium in serum was measured as above and phosphate was measured by a U.V. spectroscopic kit assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStatistical analysis for animal studies. Data are represented as the mean±standard error (SE). Statistical significance was determined using SAS (Ver.5.00.010720, SAS Institute Japan, Tokyo, Japan). A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001 versus TPTX-vehicle level by Dunnett's multiple comparison test.\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\nCharacterization of Alanine Substitutions in PTH and PTHrP\n\n\n \n \n \nAs shown above, PTH(1-34) has a greater capacity to bind to the R\n0 \nreceptor conformation than does PTHrP(1-36), which favors the RG conformation. To explore the molecular basis for this differential binding and conformational selectivity, we compared the effects of substitutions in the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of PTH and PTHrP peptides on the interaction of the ligands with the PTHR. Unlike in PTH(1-14), where alanine substitutions at \n \n \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n \n \n 1, 3, 10, 11, 12 and 14 increased cAMP activity, each alanine substitution in PTHrP(1-14) abolished activity in cells expressing PTHR. Thus, the (1-14) regions of PTH and PTHrP interact with the juxtamembrane (J) region of the PTHR differently. Both PTHrP(1-14) and\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPTHrP(1-36) were much less potent for cAMP activity in cells expressing a PTHR lacking the extracellular N-terminal (N) domain (deiNT), as compared to their respective PTH(1-14) and PTH(1-34) counterparts. PTHrP(1-36) activity therefore depends more heavily on interactions between the C-terminal ligand region and the PTHR N domain than does PTH(1-34) activity. We therefore studied the C-terminal region of the PTHrP sequence, as described in Example 3.\n\n\n \nExample 3\n\n\nC-Terminal Substitutions in PTH(1-28) and PTHrP(1-28)\n\n\n \n \n \nUsing alanine-scan and type-substitution strategies, we were able to generate peptides with much greater selectivity for RG receptor conformation than the native PTHrP(1-28) sequence. We focused our studies on the C-terminal region of the PTHrP sequence, and thus performed an alanine-scan of the 15-28 region of PTH(1-28) (data not shown) and PTHrP(1-28). Ala-scan analysis of the C-terminal regions of PTH(1-28) and PTHrP(1-28) revealed for each peptide strong reductions in activity at positions Arg\n20\n, Trp/Phe\n23\n, Leu\n24\n, and Leu/Ile\n28\n, known in PTH to form the core N domain-binding motif Enhancements in activity were found at several, but different positions in each scaffold: Leu\n18\n, Phe\n22\n, and His\n26 \nin PTHrP(1-28) and Asn\n16\n, Glu\n19\n, and Ala\n22 \nin PTH(1-28). The alanine substitutions at \n \n \npositions\n \n \n 16, 19, and 22 in PTH increased binding to delNT (PTH receptor missing the N-terminal ligand binding domain), whereas those at \n \n \npositions\n \n \n 18, 22, 26 in PTHrP decreased binding to delNT. The enhancing effects of the Ala substitutions at \n \n \npositions\n \n \n 16, 19, and 22 of PTH are thus mediated via the PTHR J domain, whereas, those at \n \n \npositions\n \n \n 18, 22, 26 of PTHrP require the PTHR N domain. Further type substitution analysis of \n \n \npositions\n \n \n 16, 19, 22, as well as 25 (neutral to Ala substitution) in PTHrP(1-28) resulted in the analog [Ala\n18,22\n,Leu\n25\n,Lys\n26\n]-PTHrP(1-28), which exhibits a cAMP potency and RG binding affinity that is greater than that of PTH(1-34) and among the highest observed of any PTH or PTHrP peptide. This scan revealed that alanine substitutions at \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n 18, 22, 25, and 26 each enhance cAMP activity in human and rat PTHR-expressing cells (\nFIGS. 27A and 27B\n). Following the alanine scan, these positions were further substituted individually with various amino acids; of which some were found to increase cAMP activity (\nFIGS. 27C and 27D\n). We then combined these mutations in various combinations, thus obtaining a number of PTHrP analogs with markedly enhanced activity, as described herein.\n\n\n \nExample 4\n\n\nCharacterization of Exemplary Substituted PTHrP(1-28) Peptides\n\n\n \n \n \nDose-response curves for cAMP production in SaOS cells using PTHrP(1-36), PTHrP(1-28), A\n18,22\n,K\n26\n-PTHrP(1-28), A\n18,22\n,L\n25\n,K\n26 \nPTHrP(1-28), E\n18\n,A\n22\n,L\n22\n,L\n26\n-PTHrP(1-28), or E\n18\n,A\n22\n,L\n25\n,K\n26 \n(EALK)-PTHrP(1-28) were generated (\nFIG. 28A\n). Marked enhancements of cAMP-inducing activity were found for A(E)\n18,22\n,L\n25\n,K\n26\n-PTHrP(1-28) (AALK or EALK), as compared to parental PTHrP(1-28).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese enhancing effects were confirmed in vivo studies (\nFIG. 28B\n) by injecting C57BL/6 mice (3-month-old, male) intravenously with either vehicle, PTHrP(1-36), PTHrP(1-28), AALK-PTHrP(1-28), or EALK-PTHrP(1-28) (n=3). Blood was withdrawn 10 minutes after injection and plasma level of cAMP was measured by RIA. Marked enhancements were also observed in the mouse assay for the AALK-PTHrP(1-28) and EALK-PTHrP(1-28) as compared to wt PTHrP(1-28). The greater apparent potency of PTHrP(1-36) peptide in these assays may reflect slower clearance of the longer-length peptide from the blood.\n\n\n \nExample 5\n\n\nCharacterization of the RG Selective Peptide EALK-PTHrP(1-30)\n\n\n \n \n \nWe also characterized the effects of the EALK-PTHrP(1-30) peptide on cAMP production. Three month old male C57BL/6 mice were intravenously injected with either vehicle, rPTH(1-34), M-PTH(1-34) (M=A\n1\n,Aib\n3\n,Q\n10\n,Har\n11\n,A\n12\n,W\n14\n,R\n19\n,) or E\n18\n,A\n22\n,L\n25\n,K\n26\n(EALK)-PTHrP(1-30) (5 nmol/kg). In the cAMP experiment (\nFIG. 29A\n), blood was withdrawn 10 minutes after injection and plasma level of cAMP was measured by RIA. In the calcium experiment (\nFIG. 29B\n), blood was withdrawn prior to injection and 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after injection. Ionized calcium was measured using a Ca\n++\n/pH analyzer. The ligands induced approximately the same level of plasma cAMP, but the R\n0 \nselective ligand, M-PTH(1-34) induced an ionized calcium response markedly more robust and more sustained than that of PTH(1-34). By contrast, the RG-selective ligand, EALK-PTHrP(1-30) induced an ionized calcium response that was, similar, if not lower, than that of PTH(1-34).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA second set of experiments was performed in which mice received 5 nmol/kg intravenous daily treatment with rPTH(1-34), M-PTH(1-34), or EALK-PTHrP(1-30) for 14 days. Blood samples were taken at \n \ndays\n \n 6 and 13, and markers of bone turnover (PINP, osteocalcin and CTX) were assessed by ELISA. The R\n0 \nselective ligand, M-PTH(1-34) strongly induced increases in markers of both bone formation (PINP, \nFIGS. 30A and 30B\n; osteocalcin, \nFIG. 30D\n) and bone resorption (CTX, \nFIGS. 30E and 30F\n), as early as \nday\n 6. By contrast, the RG-selective ligand, EALK-PTHrP(1-30) increased bone formation markers, with relatively smaller effects on the resorption marker, as evident on day 6 (\nFIGS. 30A\n, \n30\nC, and \n30\nE). Under the dose and time conditions analyzed, PTH(1-34) had only minor effects on bone markers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConsistent with the effects on bone markers, M-PTH(1-34) robustly increased trabecular bone, but also detectably diminished cortical bone (\nFIG. 31\n), consistent with its severe hypercalcemic actions (\nFIG. 29B\n). By contrast, EALK-PTHrP(1-30) increased cortical bone thickness with significance in the distal femur (\nFIG. 30\n and Table xx), without inducing severe hypercalcemia. These findings demonstrate that the modified ligands with different R\n0\n/RG selectivities have differential effects on bone metabolism. The findings also show that RG selective analogs, such as EALK-PTHrP(1-30), preferentially stimulate bone formation over bone resorption, and have beneficial effects on cortical bones with minimum effects on blood calcium levels. M-PTH(1-34) greatly increases the trabecular bone at the distal femur metaphysis, but induced cortical bone resorption at the mid-femur diaphysis, as indicated by erosion of endosteal surface.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTable 7 shows quantitation of bone structural parameters following two weeks of daily treatment of the above peptides. As described above, mice were treated intravenously) with either vehicle, rPTH(1-34), M-PTH(1-34), or EALK-PTHrP(1-30) daily for 14 days. All analogs significantly increased bone mineral density at both femur and lumbar spine. Cortical wall thickness was significantly lower in both distal and mid femur region for M-PTH(1-34). In contrast, EALK-PTHrP(1-30) increased cortical bone thickness with significance in the distal femur.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBone structural parameters after two-week daily treatment in mice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nPTH(1-34)\n\n\n \n\n\nM-PTH(1-34)\n\n\n \n\n\nEALK-PTHrP (1-30)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(SEQ ID\n\n\nP vs.\n\n\n(SEQ ID\n\n\nP vs.\n\n\n(SEQ ID\n\n\nP vs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nvehicle\n\n\nNO: 130)\n\n\nveh\n\n\nNO: 12)\n\n\nveh\n\n\nNO: 90)\n\n\nveh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPiximus\na\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Femur BMD\n\n\n0.0599 ± 0.0002\n\n\n0.0615 ± 0.0003\n\n\n0.003\n\n\n 0.664 ± 0.0003\n\n\n<0.0001\n\n\n 0.620 ± 0.0003\n\n\n0.0004\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(g/cm\n2\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLumbar Spine\n\n\n0.0455 ± 0.0001\n\n\n0.0464 ± 0.0002\n\n\n0.001\n\n\n0.0524 ± 0.0002\n\n\n<0.0001\n\n\n0.0464 ± 0.0002\n\n\n0.001\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMD (g/cm\n2\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmicroCT\nb\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\ndistal femur\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrabecularBV/TV\n\n\n17.6 ± 0.8 \n\n\n17.4 ± 1.2 \n\n\n0.883\n\n\n35.0 ± 3.0 \n\n\n0.001\n\n\n16.5 ± 1.3 \n\n\n0.506\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTb.N (1/mm)\n\n\n4.37 ± 0.08\n\n\n4.02 ± 0.14\n\n\n0.055\n\n\n5.22 ± 0.34\n\n\n0.047\n\n\n4.13 ± 0.16\n\n\n0.201\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTb.Th (μm)\n\n\n55.4 ± 1.7 \n\n\n57.5 ± 1.4 \n\n\n0.361\n\n\n71.5 ± 1.8 \n\n\n<0.0001\n\n\n57.8 ± 2.1 \n\n\n0.393\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTbSp\n\n\n224 ± 5 \n\n\n246 ± 10 \n\n\n0.076\n\n\n208 ± 17 \n\n\n0.398\n\n\n238 ± 10 \n\n\n0.235\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(μm)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConn-Dens.\n\n\n132 ± 4 \n\n\n116 ± 8 \n\n\n0.091\n\n\n263 ± 25 \n\n\n0.002\n\n\n117 ± 9 \n\n\n0.132\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1/mm\n3\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCort Th.

In the 1-30 scaffold, Gly, Ser, Leu, Asn, Gln, Trp, Glu, and Lys were substituted at \nposition\n 29; Gly, Ser, Leu, Asn, Asp, Trp, and Lys were substituted at \nposition\n 30; and Ser, Leu, Asn, Val, Trp, Glu, and Lys were substituted at \nposition\n 31. In EALK-PTHrP(1-34), the 30-33 region was substituted with alanine, or the C-terminal six amino acids were replaced by the corresponding region of PTH(1-34). A predicted advantage of these longer-length peptides, relative to the PTHrP(1-30) scaffold, is that they will have longer a longer half-life in circulation due to slower clearance. The C-terminal substitutions were thus designed to provide the added chain length, but to avoid increasing R\n0 \nbinding affinity, which occurs when the native PTHrP(29-34) region (SEQ ID NO:186) is installed. These peptides were tested for cAMP activity in MC3T3-E1 cells. As shown in \nFIGS. 32A and 32B\n, several of these peptides exhibited greater activity than the unsubstituted C-terminal sequence.\n\n\n \nExample 7\n\n\nCharacterization of Trp\n1\n-M-PTH in Renal Phosphate Transport\n\n\n \n \n \nTo help elucidate further the signaling mechanisms by which PTH ligands regulate renal phosphate transport, we developed a derivative of M-PTH(1-28) that is defective for PLC/PKC signaling, yet retains potent cAMP/PKA signaling activity. Such a peptide allows for study of the relative roles of the PKA and PKC signaling pathways in modulating the function and surface expression of the Pi transporters NaPi-IIa and NaPi-IIc in proximal tubule (PT) cells. The analog M-PTH(1-28)\n\n\n \n \n(M=Ala\n1\n,Aib\n3\n,Gln\n10\n,Har\n11\n,Ala\n12\n,Trp\n14\n,Arg\n19\n), a potent agonist for cAMP and IP\n3 \nsignaling pathways, induces, when injected into mice, prolonged hypophosphatemic and hypercalcemic effects. The analog also induced prolonged reductions in NaPi-IIa immunoreactivity at the brush border membrane and cytoplasmic compartments of renal PT cells of injected mice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo impair PLC signaling, we replaced alanine at \nposition\n 1 of M-PTH(1-28) with tryptophan, in accordance with findings of Bisello and colleagues (J Biol Chem 277:38524-30, 2002) showing that such bulky substitutions at this position selectively impair PLC signaling. In HEK-293 cells transiently transfected with the rat PTHR, Trp\n1\n-M-PTH(1-28) was about as potent as M-PTH(1-28) for stimulating cAMP formation, but at least 100-fold less potent than the parent peptide for stimulating IP\n3 \nformation. Trp\n1\n-M-PTH(1-28) retained the capacity to produce a prolonged cAMP response in MC3T3-E1 cells after ligand wash-out, as seen with MPTH(1-28). When injected into mice (20 nmol/kg) Trp\n1\n-M-PTH(1-28), like M-PTH(1-28), induced prolonged suppression of plasma phosphate levels, as compared to effects of PTH(1-34): maximal suppression at 2 h for each analog; recovery to vehicle control levels at 4 h for PTH(1-34), and at 6 h for M-PTH(1-28) and Trp\n1\n-M-PTH(1-28). Apical and cytoplasmic NaPi-IIa staining in renal PT cells was reduced in mice treated with each peptide at 2 h, but where staining returned to vehicle control levels at 6 h with PTH(1-34), it remained reduced for at least six hours in mice treated with M-PTH(1-28) or Trp\n1\n-M-PTH(1-28). Immunostaining of NaPi-IIc in renal PT cells was reduced in mice treated with M-PTH(1-28) over the \ninterval\n 4 to 6 h, but was unchanged in mice treated with Trp\n1\n-M-PTH(1-28) or PTH(1-34). M-PTH(1-28) inhibited \n32\nP uptake in early passage LLC-PK1 cells (NHERF-1/ezrin positive) virally transduced to express NaPi-IIc transporter and the rat PTHR (Mahon, \nAm J Physiol Renal Physiol. \n294:F667-75 (2008)), but Trp\n1\n-M-PTH(1-28) failed to inhibit this activity. The findings suggest that PTHR-mediated regulation of renal Pi transport involves, as one component, the cAMP/PKA-dependent control of NaPi-IIa down regulation, and, as another, perhaps slower and minor component, the PLC-dependent control of NaPi-IIc down regulation.\n\n\n \nExample 8\n\n\nCharacterization of M-PTH(1-14)/PTHrP(15-36) on Serum and Urinary Calcium and Phosphate in TPTX Rats\n\n\n \n \n \nWe also studied the effects of the M-PTH(1-14)/PTHrP(15-36) hybrid peptide (SP-PTH) on serum and urinary calcium and phosphate. A single intravenous injection into thyroparathyroidectomized (TPTX) rats, PTH(1-34) at 1.25 nmol/kg, transiently increased serum calcium(sCa) and decreased serum phosphorus (sPi) levels at 1 hr, but not to the normal range, as levels returned to pre-injection conditions by 6 hrs (\nFIGS. 33 and 35\n, respectively). PTH(1-34) did not change urinary calcium (\nFIG. 34\n) or urinary phosphate levels (\nFIG. 36\n) over 0-6 hours. By contrast, administration of SP-PTH at 1.25 nmol/kg, increased sCa and decreased sPi to normal levels within 6 hrs, and these levels were maintained for 24 hrs. SP-PTH decreased urinary calcium and increased urinary phosphate level at 0-6 hours. These results indicate that SP-PTH can normalize hypocalcemia in TPTX rats without causing hypercalciuria, thus suggesting that this peptide can be used to treat hypoparathyroidism with decreased risk of renal complications.\n\n\n \nExample 9\n\n\ncAMP Stimulation Using PTH or PTHrP Analogs\n\n\n \n \n \nHKRK-B, which are LLC-PK1 cells over-expressing human PTH1 receptor at levels of 9.5×10\n5 \nper cell were used in the cAMP signaling assay. The cells were cultured at 37° C. in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO\n2 \nin Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (Invitrogen Corp). Human PTHrP(1-36) was synthesized by American Peptide Company, Inc. (California, USA), Human PTH(1-34) (SEQ ID NO:5) was purchased from Peptide Institute Inc. (Osaka, Japan), and the PTH or PTHrP analogs (Mc-PTH(1-34) (SEQ ID NO:131), [A\n1\n,A\n3\n,A\n23\n,Q\n10\n,R\n11\n]-hPTH(1-34) (SEQ ID NO:181), [A\n1\n,A\n3\n,A\n23\n]-hPTH(1-34) (SEQ ID NO:182), and [A\n18\n,A\n22\n,L\n25\n,K\n26\n] PTHrP(1-28) (SEQ ID NO:76)) were synthesized by Sigma Aldrich Japan (Tokyo, Japan). All peptides were dissolved at 1 mM in 10 mM acetic acid, and stored at −80° C. The cAMP stimulation assay was performed as described above for HKRK-B7 cells.

No. 61/153,948, filed 19 Feb. 2009, and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/192,672, filed 19 Sep. 2008, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nAmong other things, the present invention relates to conjugates comprising an OGF peptide moiety covalently attached to one or more water-soluble polymers.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe opioid growth factor (OGF), chemically termed [Met\n5\n]-enkephalin, is an endogenous opioid peptide that is an important regulator of the progression of human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). OGF is a constitutively expressed native opioid that is autocrine produced and secreted and interacts with the OGF receptor (OGFr) to inhibit the growth of HNSCC cells in vitro and in tumor xenografts. The action of OGF is tonic, stereospecific, reversible, noncytotoxic, and nonapoptotic-inducing, not associated with differentiative, migratory, invasive, or adhesive processes, independent of serum, anchorage-independent, and occurs at physiologically relevant concentrations in a wide variety of HNSCC cancers, including poorly and well-differentiated human cell lineS. The only opioid peptide, natural or synthetic, that influences the growth of HNSCC is OGF. The action of this opioid in these neoplasias is targeted to DNA synthesis and is directed toward the G\n0\n-G\n1 \ninterface of the cell cycle. Exogenous administration of OGF has a profound antitumor action on xenografts of HNSCC that includes delaying tumor appearance and reducing tumor size. The combination of biotherapy with OGF and chemotherapy with paclitaxel has proved to enhance antitumor effectiveness beyond either agent alone (See Cheng F. et al. (2007) \nCancer Research \n67, 10511-10518.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn pain modulation, the μ and δ (mu and delta, respectively) opioid receptors serve as classic binding sites for enkephalins. [Met\n5\n]-enkephalin binds to μ and δ receptors with high affinity and is reported to be 9.5 nM for μ and 0.9 nM for δ receptors in guinea-pig brain membranes (Leslie, 1987).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOGF has also been in clinical trials for pancreatic cancer and inhibits growth of pancreatic adenocarcinona cell lines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNormally, peptides, like OGF, suffer from a short in vivo half life, sometimes mere minutes, making them generally impractical, in their native form, for administration. Thus there exists a need in the art for modified OGF peptides having an enhanced half-life and/or reduced clearance as well as additional advantages as compared to the OGF peptides in their unmodified form.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nAccordingly, the present invention provides conjugates comprising an OGF peptide moiety covalently attached to one or more water-soluble polymers. The water-soluble polymer may be stably bound to the OGF peptide moiety, or it may be releasably attached to the OGF peptide moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention further provides methods of synthesizing such OGF peptide polymer conjugates and compositions comprising such conjugates. The invention further provides methods of treating, preventing, or ameliorating a disease, disorder or condition in a mammal comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of an OGF peptide polymer conjugate of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional embodiments of the present conjugates, compositions, methods, and the like will be apparent from the following description, examples, and claims. As can be appreciated from the foregoing and following description, each and every feature described herein, and each and every combination of two or more of such features, is included within the scope of the present disclosure provided that the features included in such a combination are not mutually inconsistent. In addition, any feature or combination of features may be specifically excluded from any embodiment of the present invention.

Thus, for example, reference to “a polymer” includes a single polymer as well as two or more of the same or different polymers; reference to “an optional excipient” or to “a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient” refers to a single optional excipient as well as two or more of the same or different optional excipients, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn describing and claiming one or more embodiments of the present invention, the following terminology will be used in accordance with the definitions described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the terms “OGF peptide” and “OGF peptides” mean one or more peptides having demonstrated or potential use in treating, preventing, or ameliorating one or more diseases, disorders, or conditions in a subject in need thereof, as well as related peptides. These terms may be used to refer to OGF peptides prior to conjugation to a water-soluble polymer as well as following the conjugation. OGF peptides include, but are not limited to, those having the amino acid sequence: Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Met.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEQ ID NO.\n\n\n \nSequence\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nTyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Met\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOGF peptides include peptides found to have use in treating, preventing, or ameliorating one or more diseases, disorders, or conditions after the time of filing of this application. Related peptides include fragments of OGF peptides, OGF peptide variants, and OGF peptide derivatives that retain some or all of the OGF-like activities of the OGF peptide. As will be known to one of skill in the art, as a general principle, modifications may be made to peptides that do not alter, or only partially abrogate, the properties and activities of those peptides. In some instances, modifications may be made that result in an increase in OGF activities. Thus, in the spirit of the invention, the terms “OGF peptide” and “OGF peptides” are meant to encompass modifications to the OGF peptides defined and/or disclosed herein that do not alter, only partially abrogate, or increase the OGF activities of the parent peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “OGF activity” as used herein refers to a demonstrated or potential biological activity whose effect is consistent with a desirable disease outcome in humans, or to desired effects in non-human mammals or in other species or organisms. A given OGF peptide may have one or more OGF activities, however the term “OGF activities” as used herein may refer to a single OGF activity or multiple OGF activites. “OGF activity” includes the ability to induce a response in vitro, and may be measured in vivo or in vitro. For example, a desirable effect may be assayed in cell culture, or by clinical evaluation, EC\n50 \nassays, IC\n50 \nassays, or dose response curves. In vitro or cell culture assays, for example, are commonly available and known to one of skill in the art for many OGF peptides as defined and/or disclosed herein. OGF activity includes treatment, which may be prophylactic or ameliorative, or prevention of a disease, disorder, or condition. Treatment of a disease, disorder or condition can include improvement of a disease, disorder or condition by any amount, including elimination of a disease, disorder or condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the terms “peptide,” “polypeptide,” and “protein,” refer to polymers comprised of amino acid monomers linked by amide bonds. Peptides may include the standard 20 α-amino acids that are used in protein synthesis by cells (i.e. natural amino acids), as well as non-natural amino acids (non-natural amino acids nay be found in nature, but not used in protein synthesis by cells, e.g., ornithine, citrulline, and sarcosine, or may be chemically synthesized), amino acid analogs, and peptidomimetics. Spatola, (1983) in Chemistry and Biochemistry of Amino Acids, Peptides, and Proteins, Weinstein, ed., Marcel Dekker, New York, p. 267. The amino acids may be D- or L-optical isomers. Peptides may be formed by a condensation or coupling reaction between the α-carbon carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of another amino acid. The terminal amino acid at one end of the chain (amino terminal) therefore has a free amino group, while the terminal amino acid at the other end of the chain (carboxy terminal) has a free carboxyl group. Alternatively, the peptides may be non-linear, branched peptides or cyclic peptides. Moreover, the peptides may optionally be modified or protected with a variety of functional groups or protecting groups, including on the amino and/or carboxy terminus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmino acid residues in peptides are abbreviated as follows: Phenylalanine is Phe or F; Leucine is Leu or L; Isoleucine is Ile or I; Methionine is Met or M; Valine is Val or V; Serine is Ser or S; Proline is Pro or P; Threonine is Thr or T; Alanine is Ala or A; Tyrosine is Tyr or Y; Histidine is His or H; Glutamine is Gln or Q; Asparagine is Asn or N; Lysine is Lys or K; Aspartic Acid is Asp or D; Glutamic Acid is Glu or E; Cysteine is Cys or C; Tryptophan is Trp or W; Arginine is Arg or R; and Glycine is Gly or G.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “OGF peptide fragment” or “fragments of OGF peptides” refer to a polypeptide that comprises a truncation at the amino-terminus and/or a truncation at the carboxyl-terminus of an OGF peptide as defined herein. The terms “OGF peptide fragment” or “fragments of OGF peptides” also encompasses amino-terminal and/or carboxyl-terminal truncations of OGF peptide variants and OGF peptide derivatives. OGF peptide fragments may be produced by synthetic techniques known in the art or may arise from in vivo protease activity on longer peptide sequences. It will be understood that OGF peptide fragments retain some or all of the OGF activities of the OGF peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the terms “OGF peptide variants” or “variants of OGF peptides” refer to OGF peptides having one or more amino acid substitutions, including conservative substitutions and non-conservative substitutions, amino acid deletions (either internal deletions and/or C- and/or N-terminal truncations), amino acid additions (either internal additions and/or C- and/or N-terminal additions, e.g., fusion peptides), or any combination thereof. Variants may be naturally occurring (e.g. homologs or orthologs), or non-natural in origin. The term “OGF peptide variants” may also be used to refer to OGF peptides incorporating one or more non-natural amino acids, amino acid analogs, and peptidomimetics. It will be understood that, in accordance with the invention, OGF peptide fragments retain some or all of the OGF activities of the OGF peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “OGF peptide derivatives” or “derivatives of OGF peptides” as used herein refer to OGF peptides, OGF peptide fragments, and OGF peptide variants that have been chemically altered other than through covalent attachment of a water-soluble polymer. It will be understood that, in accordance with the invention, OGF peptide derivatives retain some or all of the OGF activities of the OGF peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the terms “amino terminus protecting group” or “N-terminal protecting group,” “carboxy terminus protecting group” or “C-terminal protecting group;” or “side chain protecting group” refer to any chemical moiety capable of addition to and optionally removal from a functional group on a peptide (e.g., the N-terminus, the C-terminus, or a functional group associated with the side chain of an amino acid located within the peptide) to allow for chemical manipulation of the peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“PEG,” “polyethylene glycol” and “poly(ethylene glycol)” as used herein, are interchangeable and encompass any nonpeptidic water-soluble poly(ethylene oxide). Typically, PEGs for use in accordance with the invention comprise the following structure “—(OCH\n2\nCH\n2\n)\nn\n-” where (n) is 2 to 4000. As used herein, PEG also includes “—CH\n2\nCH\n2\n—O(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)\nn\n—CH\n2\nCH\n2\n-” and “—(OCH\n2\nCH\n2\n)\nn\nO—,” depending upon whether or not the terminal oxygens have been displaced. Throughout the specification and claims, it should be remembered that the term “PEG” includes structures having various terminal or “end capping” groups and so forth. The term “PEG” also means a polymer that contains a majority, that is to say, greater than 50%, of —OCH\n2\nCH\n2\n— repeating subunits. With respect to specific forms, the PEG can take any number of a variety of molecular weights, as well as structures or geometries such as “branched,” “linear,” “forked,” “multifunctional,” and the like, to be described in greater detail below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “end-capped” and “terminally capped” are interchangeably used herein to refer to a terminal or endpoint of a polymer having an end-capping moiety. Typically, although not necessarily, the end-capping moiety comprises a hydroxy or C\n1-20 \nalkoxy group, more preferably a C\n1-10 \nalkoxy group, and still more preferably a C\n1-5 \nalkoxy group. Thus, examples of end-capping moieties include alkoxy (e.g., methoxy, ethoxy and benzyloxy), as well as aryl, heteroaryl, cyclo, heterocyclo, and the like. It must be remembered that the end-capping moiety may include one or more atoms of the terminal monomer in the polymer [e.g., the end-capping moiety “methoxy” in CH\n3\n—O—(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)\nn\n— and CH\n3\n(OCH\n2\nCH\n2\n)\nn\n—]. In addition, saturated, unsaturated, substituted and unsubstituted forms of each of the foregoing are envisioned. Moreover, the end-capping group can also be a silane. The end-capping group can also advantageously comprise a detectable label. When the polymer has an end-capping group comprising a detectable label, the amount or location of the polymer and/or the moiety (e.g., active agent) to which the polymer is coupled can be determined by using a suitable detector. Such labels include, without limitation, fluorescers, chemiluminescers, moieties used in enzyme labeling, colorimetric (e.g., dyes), metal ions, radioactive moieties, gold particles, quantum dots, and the like. Suitable detectors include photometers, films, spectrometers, and the like. The end-capping group can also advantageously comprise a phospholipid. When the polymer has an end-capping group comprising a phospholipid, unique properties are imparted to the polymer and the resulting conjugate. Exemplary phospholipids include, without limitation, those selected from the class of phospholipids called phosphatidylcholines. Specific phospholipids include, without limitation, those selected from the group consisting of dilauroylphosphatidylcholine, dioleylphosphatidylcholine, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, disteroylphosphatidylcholine, behenoylphosphatidylcholine, arachidoylphosphatidylcholine, and lecithin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “targeting moiety” is used herein to refer to a molecular structure that helps the conjugates of the invention to localize to a targeting area, e.g., help enter a cell, or bind a receptor. Preferably, the targeting moiety comprises of vitamin, antibody, antigen, receptor, DNA, RNA, sialyl Lewis X antigen, hyaluronic acid, sugars, cell specific lectins, steroid or steroid derivative, RGD peptide, ligand for a cell surface receptor, serum component, or combinatorial molecule directed against various intra- or extracellular receptors. The targeting moiety may also comprise a lipid or a phospholipid. Exemplary phospholipids include, without limitation, phosphatidylcholines, phospatidylserine, phospatidylinositol, phospatidylglycerol, and phospatidylethanolamine. These lipids may be in the form of micelles or liposomes and the like. The targeting moiety may further comprise a detectable label or alternately a detectable label may serve as a targeting moiety. When the conjugate has a targeting group comprising a detectable label, the amount and/or distribution/location of the polymer and/or the moiety (e.g., active agent) to which the polymer is coupled can be determined by using a suitable detector. Such labels include, without limitation, fluorescers, chemiluminescers, moieties used in enzyme labeling, colorimetric (e.g., dyes), metal ions, radioactive moieties, gold particles, quantum dots, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Non-naturally occurring” with respect to a polymer as described herein, means a polymer that in its entirety is not found in nature. A non-naturally occurring polymer of the invention may, however, contain one or more monomers or segments of monomers that are naturally occurring, so long as the overall polymer structure is not found in nature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “water soluble” as in a “water-soluble polymer” is any polymer that is soluble in water at room temperature. Typically, a water-soluble polymer will transmit at least about 75%, more preferably at least about 95%, of light transmitted by the same solution after filtering. On a weight basis, a water-soluble polymer will preferably be at least about 35% (by weight) soluble in water, more preferably at least about 50% (by weight) soluble in water, still more preferably about 70% (by weight) soluble in water, and still more preferably about 85% (by weight) soluble in water. It is most preferred, however, that the water-soluble polymer is about 95% (by weight) soluble in water or completely soluble in water.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Hydrophilic,” e.g, in reference to a “hydrophilic polymer,” refers to a polymer that is characterized by its solubility in and compatability with water. In non-cross linked form, a hydrophilic polymer is able to dissolve in, or be dispersed in water. Typically, a hydrophilic polymer possesses a polymer backbone composed of carbon and hydrogen, and generally possesses a high percentage of oxygen in either the main polymer backbone or in pendent groups substituted along the polymer backbone, thereby leading to its “water-loving” nature. The water-soluble polymers of the present invention are typically hydrophilic, e.g., non-naturally occurring hydrophilic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMolecular weight in the context of a water-soluble polymer, such as PEG, can be expressed as either a number average molecular weight or a weight average molecular weight. Unless otherwise indicated, all references to molecular weight herein refer to the weight average molecular weight. Both molecular weight determinations, number average and weight average, can be measured using gel permeation chromatography or other liquid chromatography techniques. Other methods for measuring molecular weight values can also be used, such as the use of end-group analysis or the measurement of colligative properties (e.g., freezing-point depression, boiling-point elevation, and osmotic pressure) to determine number average molecular weight, or the use of light scattering techniques, ultracentrifugation or viscometry to determine weight average molecular weight. The polymers of the invention are typically polydisperse (i.e., number average molecular weight and weight average molecular weight of the polymers are not equal), possessing low polydispersity values of preferably less than about 1.2, more preferably less than about 1.15, still more preferably less than about 1.10, yet still more preferably less than about 1.05, and most preferably less than about 1.03.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “active” or “activated” when used in conjunction with a particular functional group refers to a reactive functional group that reacts readily with an electrophile or a nucleophile on another molecule. This is in contrast to those groups that require strong catalysts or highly impractical reaction conditions in order to react (i.e., a “non-reactive” or “inert” group).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “functional group” or any synonym thereof is meant to encompass protected forms thereof as well as unprotected forms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “spacer moiety,” “linkage” and “linker” are used herein to refer to an atom or a collection of atoms optionally used to link interconnecting moieties such as a terminus of a polymer segment and an OGF peptide or an electrophile or nucleophile of an OGF peptide. The spacer moiety may be hydrolytically stable or may include a physiologically hydrolyzable or enzymatically degradable linkage. Unless the context clearly dictates otherwise, a spacer moiety optionally exists between any two elements of a compound (e.g., the provided conjugates comprising a residue of an OGF peptide and a water-soluble polymer that can be attached directly or indirectly through a spacer moiety).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “monomer” or “mono-conjugate,” in reference to a polymer conjugate of an OGF peptide, refers to an OGF peptide having only one water-soluble polymer molecule covalently attached thereto, whereas an OGF peptide “dimer” or “di-conjugate” is a polymer conjugate of an OGF peptide having two water-soluble polymer molecules covalently attached thereto, and so forth.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Alkyl” refers to a hydrocarbon, typically ranging from about 1 to 15 atoms in length. Such hydrocarbons are preferably but not necessarily saturated and may be branched or straight chain, although typically straight chain is preferred. Exemplary alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, 2-methylbutyl, 2-ethylpropyl, 3-methylpentyl, and the like. As used herein, “alkyl” includes cycloalkyl as well as cycloalkylene-containing alkyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Lower alkyl” refers to an alkyl group containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and may be straight chain or branched, as exemplified by methyl, ethyl, n-butyl, i-butyl, and t-butyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Cycloalkyl” refers to a saturated or unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbon chain, including bridged, fused, or Spiro cyclic compounds, preferably made up of 3 to about 12 carbon atoms, more preferably 3 to about 8 carbon atoms. “Cycloalkylene” refers to a cycloalkyl group that is inserted into an alkyl chain by bonding of the chain at any two carbons in the cyclic ring system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Alkoxy” refers to an —O—R group, wherein R is alkyl or substituted alkyl, preferably C\n1-6 \nalkyl (e.g., methoxy, ethoxy, propyloxy, and so forth).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “substituted” as in, for example, “substituted alkyl,” refers to a moiety (e.g., an alkyl group) substituted with one or more noninterfering substituents, such as, but not limited to: alkyl; C\n3-8 \ncycloalkyl, e.g., cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, and the like; halo, e.g., fluoro, chloro, bromo, and iodo; cyano; alkoxy, lower phenyl; substituted phenyl; and the like. “Substituted aryl” is aryl having one or more noninterfering groups as a substituent. For substitutions on a phenyl ring, the substituents may be in any orientation (i.e., ortho, meta, or para).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Noninterfering substituents” are those groups that, when present in a molecule, are typically nonreactive with other functional groups contained within the molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Aryl” means one or more aromatic rings, each of 5 or 6 core carbon atoms. Aryl includes multiple aryl rings that may be fused, as in naphthyl or unfused, as in biphenyl. Aryl rings may also be fused or unfused with one or more cyclic hydrocarbon, heteroaryl, or heterocyclic rings. As used herein, “aryl” includes heteroaryl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Heteroaryl” is an aryl group containing from one to four heteroatoms, preferably sulfur, oxygen, or nitrogen, or a combination thereof. Heteroaryl rings may also be fused with one or more cyclic hydrocarbon, heterocyclic, aryl, or heteroaryl rings.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Heterocycle” or “heterocyclic” means one or more rings of 5-12 atoms, preferably 5-7 atoms, with or without unsaturation or aromatic character and having at least one ring atom that is not a carbon. Preferred heteroatoms include sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Substituted heteroaryl” is heteroaryl having one or more noninterfering groups as substituents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Substituted heterocycle” is a heterocycle having one or more side chains formed from noninterfering substituents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “organic radical” as used herein shall include alkyl, substituted alkyl, alkenyl, substituted alkenyl, alkynyl, substituted alkynyl, aryl, and substituted aryl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Electrophile” and “electrophilic group” refer to an ion or atom or collection of atoms, that may be ionic, having an electrophilic center, i.e., a center that is electron seeking, capable of reacting with a nucleophile.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Nucleophile” and “nucleophilic group” refers to an ion or atom or collection of atoms that may be ionic having a nucleophilic center, i.e., a center that is seeking an electrophilic center or with an electrophile.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “physiologically cleavable” or “hydrolyzable” or “degradable” bond is a bond that reacts with water (i.e., is hydrolyzed) under physiological conditions. The tendency of a bond to hydrolyze in water will depend not only on the general type of linkage connecting two central atoms but also on the substituents attached to these central atoms. Appropriate hydrolytically unstable or weak linkages include but are not limited to carboxylate ester, phosphate ester, anhydrides, acetals, ketals, acyloxyalkyl ether, imines, orthoesters, peptides and oligonucleotides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Releasably attached,” e.g., in reference to an OGF peptide releasably attached to a water-soluble polymer, refers to an OGF peptide that is covalently attached via a linker that includes a degradable linkage as disclosed herein, wherein upon degradation (e.g., hydrolysis), the OGF peptide is released. The OGF peptide thus released will typically correspond to the unmodified parent or native OGF peptide, or may be slightly altered, e.g., possessing a short organic tag. Preferably, the unmodified parent OGF peptide is released.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “enzymatically degradable linkage” means a linkage that is subject to degradation by one or more enzymes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “hydrolytically stable” linkage or bond refers to a chemical bond, typically a covalent bond, that is substantially stable in water, that is to say, does not undergo hydrolysis under physiological conditions to any appreciable extent over an extended period of time. Examples of hydrolytically stable linkages include, but are not limited to, the following: carbon-carbon bonds (e.g., in aliphatic chains), ethers, amides, urethanes, and the like. Generally, a hydrolytically stable linkage is one that exhibits a rate of hydrolysis of less than about 1-2% per day under physiological conditions. Hydrolysis rates of representative chemical bonds can be found in most standard chemistry textbooks. It must be pointed out that some linkages can be hydrolytically stable or hydrolyzable, depending upon (for example) adjacent and neighboring atoms and ambient conditions. One of ordinary skill in the art can determine whether a given linkage or bond is hydrolytically stable or hydrolyzable in a given context by, for example, placing a linkage-containing molecule of interest under conditions of interest and testing for evidence of hydrolysis (e.g., the presence and amount of two molecules resulting from the cleavage of a single molecule). Other approaches known to those of ordinary skill in the art for determining whether a given linkage or bond is hydrolytically stable or hydrolyzable can also be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “pharmaceutically acceptable excipient” and “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” refer to an excipient that may optionally be included in the compositions of the invention and that causes no significant adverse toxicological effects to the patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Pharmacologically effective amount,” “physiologically effective amount,” and “therapeutically effective amount” are used interchangeably herein to mean the amount of a polymer-(OGF peptide) conjugate that is needed to provide a desired level of the conjugate (or corresponding unconjugated OGF peptide) in the bloodstream or in the target tissue. The precise amount will depend upon numerous factors, e.g., the particular OGF peptide, the components and physical characteristics of the OGF composition, intended patient population, individual patient considerations, and the like, and can readily be determined by one skilled in the art, based upon the information provided herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Multi-functional” means a polymer having three or more functional groups contained therein, where the functional groups may be the same or different. Multi-functional polymeric reagents of the invention will typically contain from about 3-100 functional groups, or from 3-50 functional groups, or from 3-25 functional groups, or from 3-15 functional groups, or from 3 to 10 functional groups, or will contain 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 functional groups within the polymer backbone. A “difunctional” polymer means a polymer having two functional groups contained therein, either the same (i.e., homodifunctional) or different (i.e., heterodifunctional).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “subject,” “individual,” or “patient” are used interchangeably herein and refer to a vertebrate, preferably a mammal. Mammals include, but are not limited to, murines, rodents, simians, humans, farm animals, sport animals, and pets.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Optional” or “optionally” means that the subsequently described circumstance may or may not occur, so that the description includes instances where the circumstance occurs and instances where it does not.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Substantially” (unless specifically defined for a particular context elsewhere or the context clearly dictates otherwise) means nearly totally or completely, for instance, satisfying one or more of the following: greater than 50%, 51% or greater, 75% or greater, 80% or greater, 90% or greater, and 95% or greater of the condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnless the context clearly dictates otherwise, when the term “about” precedes a numerical value, the numerical value is understood to mean the stated numerical value and also ±10% of the stated numerical value.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTurning now to one or more aspects of the invention, conjugates are provided, the conjugates comprising an OGF peptide covalently attached (either directly or through a spacer moiety or linker) to a water-soluble polymer. The conjugates generally have the following formula:\n\n\n \n \n \nOGF—[—X—POLY]\nk \n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein OGF is an OGF peptide as defined herein, X is a covalent bond or is a spacer moiety or linker, POLY is a water soluble polymer, and k in an integer ranging from 1-10, preferably 1-5, and more preferably 1-3.\n\n\n \nOGF Peptides\n\n\n \n \n \nAs previously stated, the conjugates of the invention comprise an OGF peptide as disclosed and/or defined herein. OGF peptides include those currently known to have demonstrated or potential use in treating, preventing, or ameliorating one or more diseases, disorders, or conditions in a subject in need thereof as well as those discovered after the filing of this application. OGF peptides also include related peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe OGF peptides of the invention may comprise any of the 20 natural amino acids, and/or non-natural amino acids, amino acid analogs, and peptidomimetics, in any combination. The peptides may be composed of D-amino acids or L-amino acids, or a combination of both in any proportion. In addition to natural amino acids, the OGF peptides may contain, or may be modified to include, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, or more non-natural amino acids. Exemplary non-natural amino acids and amino acid analogs that can be use with the invention include, but are not limited to, 2-aminobutyric acid, 2-aminoisobutyric acid, 3-(1-naphthyl)alanine, 3-(2-naphthyl)alanine, 3-methylhistidine, 3-pyridylalanine, 4-chlorophenylalanine, 4-fluorophenylalanine, 4-hydroxyproline, 5-hydroxylysine, alloisoleucine, citrulline, dehydroalanine, homoarginine, homocysteine, homoserine, hydroxyproline, N-acetylserine, N-formylmethionine, N-methylglycine, N-methylisoleucine, norleucine, N-α-methylarginine, O-phosphoserine, ornithine, phenylglycine, pipecolinic acid, piperazic acid, pyroglutamine, sarcosine, valanine, β-alanine, and β-cyclohexylalanine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe OGF peptides may be, or may be modified to be, linear, branched, or cyclic, with our without branching.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, the OGF peptides may optionally be modified or protected with a variety of functional groups or protecting groups, including amino terminus protecting groups and/or carboxy terminus protecting groups. Protecting groups, and the manner in which they are introduced and removed are described, for example, in “Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry,” Plenum Press, London, N.Y. 1973; and. Greene et al., “P\nROTECTIVE \nG\nROUPS IN \nO\nRGANIC \nS\nYNTHESIS\n” 3\nrd \nEdition, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York, 1999. Numerous protecting groups are known in the art. An illustrative, non-limiting list of protecting groups includes methyl, formyl, ethyl, acetyl, t-butyl, anisyl, benzyl, trifluoroacetyl, N-hydroxysuccinimide, t-butoxycarbonyl, benzoyl, 4-methylbenzyl, thioanizyl, thiocresyl, benzyloxymethyl, 4-nitrophenyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, 2-nitrobenzoyl, 2-nitrophenylsulphenyl, 4-toluenesulphonyl, pentafluorophenyl, diphenylmethyl, 2-chlorobenzyloxycarbonyl, 2,4,5-trichlorophenyl, 2-bromobenzyloxycarbonyl, 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl, triphenylmethyl, and 2,2,5,7,8-pentamethyl-chroman-6-sulphonyl. For discussions of various different types of amino- and carboxy-protecting groups, see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,221,736 (issued Jun. 22, 1993); U.S. Pat. No. 5,256,549 (issued Oct. 26, 1993); U.S. Pat. No. 5,049,656 (issued Sep. 17, 1991); and U.S. Pat. No. 5,521,184 (issued May 28, 1996).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe OGF peptides contain, or may be modified to contain, functional groups to which a water-soluble polymer may be attached, either directly or through a spacer moiety or linker. Functional groups include, but are not limited to, the N-terminus of the OGF peptide, the C-terminus of the OGF peptide, and any functional groups on the side chain of an amino acid, e.g. lysine, cysteine, histidine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, tyrosine, arginine, serine, methionine, and threonine, present in the OGF peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe OGF peptides can be prepared by any means known in the art, including non-recombinant and recombinant methods, or they may, in some instances, be commercially available. Chemical or non-recombinant methods include, but are not limited to, solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS), solution phase peptide synthesis, native chemical ligation, intein-mediated protein ligation, and chemical ligation, or a combination thereof. In a preferred embodiment, the OGF peptides are synthesized using standard SPPS, either manually or by using commercially available automated SPPS synthesizers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSPPS has been known in the art since the early 1960's (Merrifield, R. B., \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc., \n85:2149-2154 (1963)), and is widely employed. (See also, Bodanszky, Principles of Peptide Synthesis, Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg (1984)). There are several known variations on the general approach. (See, for example, “Peptide Synthesis, Structures, and Applications” © 1995 by Academic Press, \nChapter\n 3 and White (2003) \nFmoc Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis, A practical Approach\n, Oxford University Press, Oxford). Very briefly, in solid phase peptide synthesis, the desired C-terminal amino acid residue is coupled to a solid support. The subsequent amino acid to be added to the peptide chain is protected on its amino terminus with Boc, Fmoc, or other suitable protecting group, and its carboxy terminus is activated with a standard coupling reagent. The free amino terminus of the support-bound amino acid is allowed to react with the carboxy-terminus of the subsequent amino acid, coupling the two amino acids. The amino terminus of the growing peptide chain is deprotected, and the process is repeated until the desired polypeptide is completed. Side chain protecting groups may be utilized as needed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the OGF peptides may be prepared recombinantly. Exemplary recombinant methods used to prepare OGF peptides include the following, among others, as will be apparent to one skilled in the art. Typically, an OGF peptide as defined and/or described herein is prepared by constructing the nucleic acid encoding the desired peptide or fragment, cloning the nucleic acid into an expression vector, transforming a host cell (e.g., plant, bacteria such as \nEscherichia coli\n, yeast such as \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae\n, or mammalian cell such as Chinese hamster ovary cell or baby hamster kidney cell), and expressing the nucleic acid to produce the desired peptide or fragment. The expression can occur via exogenous expression or via endogenous expression (when the host cell naturally contains the desired genetic coding). Methods for producing and expressing recombinant polypeptides in vitro and in prokaryotic and eukaryotic host cells are known to those of ordinary skill in the art. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,868,122, and Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning—A Laboratory Manual (Third Edition), Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press (2001).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo facilitate identification and purification of the recombinant peptide, nucleic acid sequences that encode an epitope tag or other affinity binding sequence can be inserted or added in-frame with the coding sequence, thereby producing a fusion peptide comprised of the desired OGF peptide and a peptide suited for binding. Fusion peptides can be identified and purified by first running a mixture containing the fusion peptide through an affinity column bearing binding moieties (e.g., antibodies) directed against the epitope tag or other binding sequence in the fusion peptide, thereby binding the fusion peptide within the column. Thereafter, the fusion peptide can be recovered by washing the column with the appropriate solution (e.g., acid) to release the bound fusion peptide. Optionally, the tag may subsequently be removed by techniques known in the art. The recombinant peptide can also be identified and purified by lysing the host cells, separating the peptide, e.g., by size exclusion chromatography, and collecting the peptide. These and other methods for identifying and purifying recombinant peptides are known to those of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\n \nRelated Peptides\n\n\n \n \n \nIt will be appreciated and understood by one of skill in the art that certain modifications can be made to the OGF peptides defined and/or disclosed herein that do not alter, or only partially abrogate, the properties and activities of these OGF peptides. In some instances, modifications may be made that result in an increase in OGF activities. Additionally, modifications may be made that increase certain biological and chemical properties of the OGF peptides in a beneficial way, e.g. increased in vivo half life, increased stability, decreased susceptibility to proteolytic cleavage, etc. Thus, in the spirit and scope of the invention, the term “OGF peptide” is used herein in a manner to include not only the OGF peptides defined and/or disclosed herein, but also related peptides, i.e. peptides that contain one or more modifications relative to the OGF peptides defined and/or disclosed herein, wherein the modification(s) do not alter, only partially abrogate, or increase the OGF activities as compared to the parent peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRelated peptides include, but are not limited to, fragments of OGF peptides, OGF peptide variants, and OGF peptide derivatives. Related peptides also include any and all combinations of these modifications. In a non-limiting example, a related peptide may be a fragment of an OGF peptide as disclosed herein having one or more amino acid substitutions. Thus it will be understood that any reference to a particular type of related peptide is not limited to an OGF peptide having only that particular modification, but rather encompasses an OGF peptide having that particular modification and optionally any other modification.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRelated peptides may be prepared by action on a parent peptide or a parent protein (e.g. proteolytic digestion to generate fragments) or through de novo preparation (e.g. solid phase synthesis of a peptide having a conservative amino acid substitution relative to the parent peptide). Related peptides may arise by natural processes (e.g. processing and other post-translational modifications) or may be made by chemical modification techniques. Such modifications are well-known to those of skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA related peptide may have a single alteration or multiple alterations relative to the parent peptide. Where multiple alterations are present, the alterations may be of the same type or a given related peptide may contain different types of modifications. Furthermore, modifications can occur anywhere in a polypeptide, including the peptide backbone, the amino acid side-chains, and the N- or C-termini.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs previously noted, related peptides include fragments of the OGF peptides defined and/or disclosed herein, wherein the fragment retains some of or all of at least one OGF activity of the parent peptide. The fragment may also exhibit an increase in at least one OGF activity of the parent peptide. In certain embodiments of the invention, OGF peptides include related peptides having at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, or 100 contiguous amino acid residues, or more than 125 contiguous amino acid residues, of any of the OGF peptides disclosed, herein, including in Table 1. In other embodiments of the invention, OGF peptides include related peptides having 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, or 50 amino acid residues deleted from the N-terminus and/or having 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, or 50 amino acid residues deleted from the C-terminus of any of the OGF peptides disclosed herein, including in Table 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRelated peptides also include variants of the OGF peptides defined and/or disclosed herein, wherein the variant retains some of or all of at least one OGF activity of the parent peptide. The variant may also exhibit an increase in at least one OGF activity of the parent peptide. In certain embodiments of the invention, OGF peptides include variants having 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, or 50 conservative and/or non-conservative amino acid substitutions relative to the OGF peptides disclosed herein, including in Table 1. Desired amino acid substitutions, whether conservative or non-conservative, can be determined by those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments of the invention, OGF peptides include variants having conservative amino substitutions; these substitutions will produce an OGF peptide having functional and chemical characteristics similar to those of the parent peptide. In other embodiments, OGF peptides include variants having non-conservative amino substitutions; these substitutions will produce an OGF peptide having functional and chemical characteristics that may differ substantially from those of the parent peptide. In certain embodiments of the invention, OGF peptide variants have both conservative and non-conservative amino acid substitutions. In other embodiments, each amino acid residue may be substituted with alanine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNatural amino acids may be divided into classes based on common side chain properties: nonpolar (Gly, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, Met); polar neutral (Cys, Ser, Thr, Pro, Asn, Gln); acidic (Asp, Glu); basic (His, Lys, Arg); and aromatic (Trp, Tyr, Phe). By way of example, non-conservative amino acid substitutions may involve the substitution of an amino acid of one class for that of another, and may be introduced in regions of the peptide not critical for OGF activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, amino acid substitutions are conservative. Conservative amino acid substitutions may involve the substitution of an amino acid of one class for that of the same class. Conservative amino acid substitutions may also encompass non-natural amino acid residues, including peptidomimetics and other atypical forms of amino acid moieties, and may be incorporated through chemical peptide synthesis,\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmino acid substitutions may be made with consideration to the hydropathic index of amino acids. The importance of the hydropathic amino acid index in conferring interactive biological function on a protein is generally understood in the art (Kyte et al., 1982\n, J. Mol. Biol. \n157:105-31). Each amino acid has been assigned a hydropathic index on the basis of its hydrophobicity and charge characteristics. The hydropathic indices are: isoleucine (+4.5); valine (+4.2); leucine (+3.8); phenylalanine (+2.8); cysteine/cystine (+2.5); methionine (+1.9); alanine (+1.8); glycine (−0.4); threonine (−0.7); serine (−0.8); tryptophan (−0.9); tyrosine (−1.3); proline (−1.6); histidine (−3.2); glutamate (−3.5); glutamine (−3.5); aspartate (−3.5); asparagine (−3.5); lysine (−3.9); and arginine (−4.5).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is known that certain amino acids may be substituted for other amino acids having a similar hydropathic index or score and still retain a similar biological activity. In making changes based upon the hydropathic index, the substitution of amino acids whose hydropathic indices are within ±2 is preferred, those which are within ±1 are particularly preferred, and those within ±0.5 are even more particularly preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also understood in the art that the substitution of like amino acids can be made effectively on the basis of hydrophilicity. The greatest local average hydrophilicity of a protein, as governed by the hydrophilicity of its adjacent amino acids, correlates with its biological properties. According to U.S. Pat. No. 4,554,101, incorporated herein by reference, the following hydrophilicity values have been assigned to these amino acid residues: arginine (+3.0); lysine (+3.0); aspartate (+3.0±1); glutamate (+3.0±1); serine (+0.3); asparagine (+0.2); glutamine (+0.2); glycine (0); threonine (−0.4); proline (−0.5±1); alanine (−0.5); histidine (−0.5); cysteine (−1.0); methionine (−1.3); valine (−1.5); leucine (−1.8); isoleucine (−1.8); tyrosine (−2.3); phenylalanine (−2.5); and tryptophan (−3.4). In making changes based upon similar hydrophilicity values, the substitution of amino acids whose hydrophilicity values are within ±2 is preferred, those which are within ±1 are particularly preferred, and those within ±0.5 are even more particularly preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments of the invention, OGF peptides include variants having 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, or 50 amino acid deletions relative to the OGF peptides disclosed herein, including in Table 1. The deleted amino acid(s) may be at the N- or C-terminus of the peptide, at both termini, at an internal location or locations within the peptide, or both internally and at one or both termini. Where the variant has more than one amino acid deletion, the deletions may be of contiguous amino acids or of amino acids at different locations within the primary amino acid sequence of the parent peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments of the invention, OGF peptides include variants having 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, or 50 amino acid additions relative to the OGF peptides disclosed herein, including in Table 1. The added amino acid(s) may be at the N- or C-terminus of the peptide, at both termini, at an internal location or locations within the peptide, or both internally and at one or both termini. Where the variant has more than one amino acid addition, the amino acids may be added contiguously, or the amino acids may be added at different locations within the primary amino acid sequence of the parent peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAddition variants also include fusion peptides. Fusions can be made either at the N-terminus or at the C-terminus of the OGF peptides disclosed herein, including in Table 1. In certain embodiments, the fusion peptides have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, or 50 amino acid additions relative to the OGF peptides disclosed herein, including in Table 1. Fusions may be attached directly to the OGF peptide with no connector molecule or may be through a connector molecule. As used in this context, a connector molecule may be an atom or a collection of atoms optionally used to link an OGF peptide to another peptide. Alternatively, the connector may be an amino acid sequence designed for cleavage by a protease to allow for the separation of the fused peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe OGF peptides of the invention may be fused to peptides designed to improve certain qualities of the OGF peptide, such as OGF activity, circulation time, or reduced aggregation. OGF peptides may be fused to an immunologically active domain, e.g. an antibody epitope, to facilitate purification of the peptide, or to increase the in vivo half life of the peptide. Additionally, OGF peptides may be fused to known functional domains, cellular localization sequences, or peptide permeant motifs known to improve membrane transfer properties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments of the invention, OGF peptides also include variants incorporating one or more non-natural amino acids, amino acid analogs, and peptidomimetics. Thus the present invention encompasses compounds structurally similar to the OGF peptides defined and/or disclosed herein, which are formulated to mimic the key portions of the OGF peptides of the present invention. Such compounds may be used in the same manner as the OGF peptides of the invention. Certain mimetics that mimic elements of protein secondary and tertiary structure have been previously described. Johnson et al., Biotechnology and Pharmacy, Pezzuto et al. (Eds.), Chapman and Hall, NY, 1993. The underlying rationale behind the use of peptide mimetics is that the peptide backbone of proteins exists chiefly to orient amino acid side chains in such a way as to facilitate molecular interactions. A peptide mimetic is thus designed to permit molecular interactions similar to the parent peptide. Mimetics can be constructed to achieve a similar spatial orientation of the essential elements of the amino acid side chains. Methods for generating specific structures have been disclosed in the art. For example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,446,128, 5,710,245, 5,840,833, 5,859,184, 5,440,013; 5,618,914, 5,670,155, 5,475,085, 5,929,237, 5,672,681 and 5,674,976, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference, all disclose peptidomimetics structures that may have improved properties over the parent peptide, for example they may be conformationally restricted, be more thermally stable, exhibit increased resistance to degredation, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, related peptides comprise or consist of a peptide sequence that is at least 70% identical to any of the OGF peptides disclosed herein, including in Table 1. In additional embodiments, related peptides are at least 75% identical, at least 80% identical, at least 85% identical, 90% identical, at least 91% identical, at least 92% identical, 93% identical, at least 94% identical, at least 95% identical, 96% identical, at least 97% identical, at least 98% identical, or at least 99% identical to any of the OGF peptides disclosed herein, including in Table 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSequence identity (also known as % homology) of related polypeptides can be readily calculated by known methods. Such methods include, but are not limited to those described in \nComputational Molecular Biology \n(A. M. Lesk, ed., Oxford University Press 1988); \nBiocomputing: Informatics and Genome Projects \n(D. W. Smith, ed., Academic Press 1993); \nComputer Analysis of Sequence Data \n(\nPart\n 1, A. M. Griffin and H. G. Griffin, eds., Humana Press 1994); G. von Heinle, \nSequence Analysis in Molecular Biology \n(Academic Press 1987); \nSequence Analysis Primer \n(M. Gribskov and J. Devereux, eds., M. Stockton Press 1991); and Carillo et al., 1988\n, SIAM J. Applied Math., \n48:1073.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred methods to determine sequence identity and/or similarity are designed to give the largest match between the sequences tested. Methods to determine sequence identity are described in publicly available computer programs. Preferred computer program methods to determine identity and similarity between two sequences include, but are not limited to, the GCG program package, including GAP (Devereux et al., 1984\n, Nucleic Acids Res. \n12:387; Genetics Computer Group, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wis.), BLASTP, BLASTN, and FASTA (Altschul et al., 1990\n, J. Mol. Biol. \n215:403-10). The BLASTX program is publicly available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and other sources (Altschul et al., \nBLAST Manual \n(NCB NLM NIH, Bethesda, Md.); Altschul et al., 1990, supra). The well-known Smith Waterman algorithm may also be used to determine identity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, using the computer algorithm GAP (Genetics Computer Group, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wis.), two polypeptides for which the percent sequence identity is to be determined are aligned for optimal matching of their respective amino acids (the “matched span,” as determined by the algorithm). A gap opening penalty (which is calculated as 3× the average diagonal; the “average diagonal” is the average of the diagonal of the comparison matrix being used; the “diagonal” is the score or number assigned to each perfect amino acid match by the particular comparison matrix) and a gap extension penalty (which is usually 0.1× the gap opening penalty), as well as a comparison matrix such as \nPAM\n 250 or BLOSUM 62 are used in conjunction with the algorithm. A standard comparison matrix is also used by the algorithm (see Dayhoff et al., 5 \nAtlas of Protein Sequence and Structure \n(Supp. 3 1978) (PAM250 comparison matrix); Henikoff et al., 1992, \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n89:10915-19 (BLOSUM 62 comparison matrix)). The particular choices to be made with regard to algorithms, gap opening penalties, gap extension penalties, comparison matrices, and thresholds of similarity will be readily apparent to those of skill in the art and will depend on the specific comparison to be made.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRelated peptides also include derivatives of the OGF peptides defined and/or disclosed herein, wherein the variant retains some of or all of at least one OGF activity of the parent peptide. The derivative may also exhibit an increase in at least one OGF activity of the parent peptide. Chemical alterations of OGF peptide derivatives include, but are not limited to, acetylation, acylation, ADP-ribosylation, amidation, biotinylation, covalent attachment of flavin, covalent attachment of a heme moiety, covalent attachment of a nucleotide or nucleotide derivative, covalent attachment of a lipid or lipid derivative, covalent attachment of phosphotidylinositol, cross-linking, cyclization, disulfide bond formation, demethylation, formation of covalent cross-links, formation of cysteine, formation of pyroglutamate, formylation, gamma-carboxylation, glycosylation, GPI anchor formation, hydroxylation, iodination, methylation, myristoylation, oxidation, proteolytic processing, phosphorylation, prenylation, racemization, selenoylation, sulfation, transfer-RNA mediated addition of amino acids to proteins such as arginylation, and ubiquitination. (See, for instance, T. E. Creighton, Proteins, Structure and Molecular Properties, 2nd ed., W.H. Freeman and Company, New York (1993); Posttranslational Covalent Modification of Proteins, B. C. Johnson, ed., Academic Press, New York, pgs. 1-12 (1983); Seifter et al., Meth. Enzymol 182:626-46 (1990); Rattan et al., Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 663:48-62, 1992).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOGF peptide derivatives also include molecules formed by the deletion of one or more chemical groups from the parent peptide. Methods for preparing chemically modified derivatives of the OGF peptides defined and/or disclosed herein are known to one of skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments of the invention, the OGF peptides may be modified with one or more methyl or other lower alkyl groups at one or more positions of the OGF peptide sequence. Examples of such groups include methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, pentyl, etc. In certain preferred embodiments, arginine, lysine, and histidine residues of the OGF peptides are modified with methyl or other lower alkyl groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments of the invention, the OGF peptides may be modified with one or more glycoside moieties relative to the parent peptide. Although any glycoside can be used, in certain preferred embodiments the OGF peptide is modified by introduction of a monosaccharide, a disaccharide, or a trisaccharide or it may contain a glycosylation sequence found in natural peptides or proteins in any mammal. The saccharide may be introduced at any position, and more than one glycoside may be introduced. Glycosylation may occur on a naturally occurring amino acid residue in the OGF peptide, or alternatively, an amino acid may be substituted with another for modification with the saccharide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlycosylated OGF peptides may be prepared using conventional Fmoc chemistry and solid phase peptide synthesis techniques, e.g., on resin, where the desired protected glycoamino acids are prepared prior to peptide synthesis and then introduced into the peptide chain at the desired position during peptide synthesis. Thus, the OGF peptide polymer conjugates may be conjugated in vitro. The glycosylation may occur before deprotection. Preparation of aminoacid glycosides is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,767,254, WO 2005/097158, and Doores, K., et al., \nChem. Commun., \n1401-1403, 2006, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. For example, alpha and beta selective glycosylations of serine and threonine residues are carried out using the Koenigs-Knorr reaction and Lemieux's in situ anomerization methodology with Schiff base intermediates. Deprotection of the Schiff base glycoside is then carried out using mildly acidic conditions or hydrogenolysis. A composition, comprising a glycosylated OGF peptide conjugate made by stepwise solid phase peptide synthesis involving contacting a growing peptide chain with protected amino acids in a stepwise manner, wherein at least one of the protected amino acids is glycosylated, followed by water-soluble polymer conjugation, may have a purity of at least 95%, such as at least 97%, or at least 98%, of a single species of the glycosylated and conjugated OGF peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMonosaccharides that may by used for introduction at one or more amino acid residues of the OGF peptides defined and/or disclosed herein include glucose (dextrose), fructose, galactose, and ribose. Additional monosaccharides suitable for use include glyceraldehydes, dihydroxyacetone, erythrose, threose, erythrulose, arabinose, lyxose, xylose, ribulose, xylulose, allose, altrose, mannose, N-Acetylneuraminic acid, fucose, N-Acetylgalactosamine, and N-Acetylglucosamine, as well as others. Glycosides, such as mono-, di-, and trisaccharides for use in modifying an OGF peptide, may be naturally occurring or may be synthetic. Disaccharides that may by used for introduction at one or more amino acid residues of the OGF peptides defined and/or disclosed herein include sucrose, lactose, maltose, trehalose, melibiose, and cellobiose, among others. Trisaccharides include acarbose, raffinose, and melezitose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn further embodiments of the invention, the OGF peptides defined and/or disclosed herein may be chemically coupled to biotin. The biotin/thereapeutic peptide molecules can then to bind to avidin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs previously noted, modifications may be made to the OGF peptides defined and/or disclosed herein that do not alter, or only partially abrogate, the properties and activities of these OGF peptides. In some instances, modifications may be made that result in an increase in OGF activity. Thus, included in the scope of the invention are modifications to the OGF peptides disclosed herein, including in Table 1, that retain at least 1%, at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 55%, at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 81%, at least 82%, at least 83%, at least 84%, at least 85%, at least 86%, at least 87%, at least 88%, at least 89%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, or at least 99%, and any range derivable therein, such as, for example, at least 70% to at least 80%, and more preferably at least 81% to at least 90%; or even more preferably, between at least 91% and at least 99% of the OGF activity relative to the unmodified OGF peptide. Also included in the scope of the invention are modification to the OGF peptides disclosed herein, including in Table 1, that have greater than 100%, greater than 110%, greater than 125%, greater than 150%, greater than 200%, or greater than 300%, or greater than 10-fold or greater than 100-fold, and any range derivable therein, of the OGF activity relative to the unmodified OGF peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe level of OGF activity of a given OGF peptide, or a modified OGF peptide, may be determined by any suitable in vivo or in vitro assay. For example, OGF activity may be assayed in cell culture, or by clinical evaluation, EC\n50 \nassays, IC\n50 \nassays, or dose response curves. In vitro or cell culture assays, for example, are commonly available and known to one of skill in the art for many OGF peptides as disclosed herein, including in Table 1. It will be understood by one of skill in the art that the percent activity of a modified OGF peptide relative to its unmodified parent can be readily ascertained through a comparison of the activity of each as determined through the assays disclosed herein or as known to one of skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne of skill in the art will be able to determine appropriate modifications to the OGF peptides defined and/or disclosed herein, including those disclosed herein, including in Table 1. For identifying suitable areas of the OGF peptides that may be changed without abrogating their OGF activities, one of skill in the art may target areas not believed to be essential for activity. For example, when similar peptides with comparable activities exist from the same species or across other species, one of skill in the art may compare those amino acid sequences to identify residues that are conserved among similar peptides. It will be understood that changes in areas of an OGF peptide that are not conserved relative to similar peptides would be less likely to adversely affect the thereapeutic activity. One skilled in the art would also know that, even in relatively conserved regions, one may substitute chemically similar amino acids while retaining OGF activity. Therefore, even areas that may be important for biological activity and/or for structure may be subject to amino acid substitutions without destroying the OGF activity or without adversely affecting the peptide structure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, as appropriate, one of skill in the art can review structure-function studies identifying residues in similar peptides that are important for activity or structure. In view of such a comparison, one can predict the importance of an amino acid residue in an OGF peptide that corresponds to an amino acid residue that is important for activity or structure in similar peptides. One of skill in the art may opt for amino acid substitutions within the same class of amino acids for such predicted important amino acid residues of the OGF peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, as appropriate, one of skill in the art can also analyze the three-dimensional structure and amino acid sequence in relation to that structure in similar peptides. In view of such information, one of skill in the art may predict the alignment of amino acid residues of an OGF peptide with respect to its three dimensional structure. One of skill in the art may choose not to make significant changes to amino acid residues predicted to be on the surface of the peptide, since such residues may be involved in important interactions with other molecules. Moreover, one of skill in the art may generate variants containing a single amino acid substitution at each amino acid residue for test purposes. The variants could be screened using OGF activity assays known to those with skill in the art. Such variants could be used to gather information about suitable modifications. For example, where a change to a particular amino acid residue resulted in abrogated, undesirably reduced, or unsuitable activity, variants with such a modification would be avoided. In other words, based on information gathered from routine experimentation, one of skill in the art can readily determine the amino acids where further modifications should be avoided either alone or in combination with other modifications.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne of skill in the art may also select suitable modifications based on secondary structure predication. A number of scientific publications have been devoted to the prediction of secondary structure. See Moult, 1996\n, Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. \n7:422-27; Chou et al., 1974\n, Biochemistry \n13:222-45; Chou et al., 1974\n, Biochemistry \n113:211-22; Chou et al., 1978\n, Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. \n47:45-48; Chou et al., 1978\n, Ann. Rev. Biochem. \n47:251-276; and Chou et al., 1979\n, Biophys. J. \n26:367-84. Moreover, computer programs are currently available to assist with predicting secondary structure. One method of predicting secondary structure is based upon homology modeling. For example, two peptides or proteins which have a sequence identity of greater than 30%, or similarity greater than 40%, often have similar structural topologies. Recent growth of the protein structural database (PDB, http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do) has provided enhanced predictability of secondary, tertiary, and quarternary structure, including the potential number of folds within the structure of a peptide or protein. See Holm et al., 1999\n, Nucleic Acids Res. \n27:244-47. It has been suggested that there are a limited number of folds in a given peptide or protein and that once a critical number of structures have been resolved, structural prediction will become dramatically more accurate (Brenner et al., 1997\n, Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. \n7:369-76).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional methods of predicting secondary structure include “threading” (Jones, 1997\n, Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. \n7:377-87; Sippl et al., 1996\n, Structure \n4:15-19), “profile analysis” (Bowie et al., 1991\n, Science, \n253:164-70; Gribskov et al., 1990\n, Methods Enzymol. \n183:146-59; Gribskov et al., 1987\n, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. \n84:4355-58), and “evolutionary linkage” (See Holm et al., supra, and Brenner et al., supra).\n\n\n \nOGF Peptide Conjugates\n\n\n \n \n \nAs described above, a conjugate of the invention comprises a water-soluble polymer covalently attached (either directly or through a spacer moiety or linker) to an OGF peptide. Typically, for any given conjugate, there will be about one to five water-soluble polymers covalently attached to an OGF peptide (wherein for each water-soluble polymer, the water-soluble polymer can be attached either directly to the OGF peptide or through a spacer moiety).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo elaborate, an OGF peptide conjugate of the invention typically has about 1, 2, 3, or 4 water-soluble polymers individually attached to an OGF peptide. That is to say, in certain embodiments, a conjugate of the invention will possess about 4 water-soluble polymers individually attached to an OGF peptide, or about 3 water-soluble polymers individually attached to an OGF peptide, or about 2 water-soluble polymers individually attached to an OGF peptide, or about 1 water-soluble polymer attached to an OGF peptide. The structure of each of the water-soluble polymers attached to the OGF peptide may be the same or different. One OGF peptide conjugate in accordance with the invention is one having a water-soluble polymer releasably attached to the OGF peptide, particularly at the N-terminus of the OGF peptide. Another OGF peptide conjugate in accordance with the invention is one having a water-soluble polymer stably attached to the OGF peptide, particularly at the N-terminus of the OGF peptide. Another OGF peptide conjugate is one having a water-soluble polymer releasably attached to the OGF peptide, particularly at the C-terminus of the OGF peptide. Another OGF peptide conjugate in accordance with the invention is one having a water-soluble polymer stably attached to the OGF peptide, particularly at the C-terminus of the OGF peptide. Other OGF peptide conjugates in accordance with the invention are those having a water-soluble polymer releasably or stably attached to an amino acid within the OGF peptide. Additional water-soluble polymers may be releasably or stably attached to other sites on the OGF peptide, e.g., such as one or more additional sites. For example, an OGF peptide conjugate having a water-soluble polymer releasably attached to the N-terminus may additionally possess a water-soluble polymer stably attached to a lysine residue. In one embodiment, one or more amino acids may be inserted, at the N- or C-terminus, or within the peptide to releasably or stably attach a water soluble polymer. One preferred embodiment of the present invention is a mono-OGF peptide polymer conjugate, i.e., an OGF peptide having one water-soluble polymer covalently attached thereto. In an even more preferred embodiment, the water-soluble polymer is one that is attached to the OGF peptide at its N-terminus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment of the invention, an OGF peptide polymer conjugate of the invention is absent a metal ion, i.e., the OGF peptide is not chelated to a metal ion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the OGF peptide polymer conjugates described herein, the OGF peptide may optionally possess one or more N-methyl substituents. Alternatively, for the OGF peptide polymer conjugates described herein, the OGF peptide may be glycosylated, e.g., having a mono- or disaccharide, or naturally-occurring amino acid glycosylation covalently attached to one or more sites thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs discussed herein, the compounds of the present invention may be made by various methods and techniques known and available to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \nThe Water-Soluble Polymer\n\n\n \n \n \nA conjugate of the invention comprises an OGF peptide attached, stably or releasably, to a water-soluble polymer. The water-soluble polymer is typically hydrophilic, nonpeptidic, and biocompatible. A substance is considered biocompatible if the beneficial effects associated with use of the substance alone or with another substance (e.g., an active agent such an OGF peptide) in connection with living tissues (e.g., administration to a patient) outweighs any deleterious effects as evaluated by a clinician, e.g., a physician. A substance is considered nonimmunogenic if the intended use of the substance in vivo does not produce an undesired immune response (e.g., the formation of antibodies) or, if an immune response is produced, that such a response is not deemed clinically significant or important as evaluated by a clinician. Typically, the water-soluble polymer is hydrophilic, biocompatible and nonimmunogenic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther the water-soluble polymer is typically characterized as having from 2 to about 300 termini, preferably from 2 to 100 termini, and more preferably from about 2 to 50 termini. Examples of such polymers include, but are not limited to, poly(alkylene glycols) such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylene glycol) (“PPG”), copolymers of ethylene glycol and propylene glycol and the like, poly(oxyethylated polyol), poly(olefinic alcohol), poly(vinylpyrrolidone), poly(hydroxyalkylmethacrylamide), poly(hydroxyalkylmethacrylate), poly(saccharides), poly(α-hydroxy acid), poly(vinyl alcohol), polyphosphazene, polyoxazoline, poly(N-acryloylmorpholine), and combinations of any of the foregoing, including copolymers and terpolymers thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe water-soluble polymer is not limited to a particular structure and may possess a linear architecture (e.g., alkoxy PEG or bifunctional PEG), or a non-linear architecture, such as branched, forked, multi-armed (e.g., PEGs attached to a polyol core), or dendritic (i.e. having a densely branched structure with numerous end groups). Moreover, the polymer subunits can be organized in any number of different patterns and can be selected, e.g., from homopolymer, alternating copolymer, random copolymer, block copolymer, alternating tripolymer, random tripolymer, and block tripolymer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne particularly preferred type of water-soluble polymer is a polyalkylene oxide, and in particular, polyethylene glycol (or PEG). Generally, a PEG used to prepare an OGF peptide polymer conjugate of the invention is “activated” or reactive. That is to say, the activated PEG (and other activated water-soluble polymers collectively referred to herein as “polymeric reagents”) used to form an OGF peptide conjugate comprises an activated functional group suitable for coupling to a desired site or sites on the OGF peptide. Thus, a polymeric reagent for use in preparing an OGF peptide conjugate includes a functional group for reaction with the OGF peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRepresentative polymeric reagents and methods for conjugating such polymers to an active moiety are known in the art, and are, e.g., described in Harris, J. M. and Zalipsky, S., eds, \nPoly\n(\nethylene glycol\n), \nChemistry and Biological Applications\n, ACS, Washington, 1997; Veronese, F., and J. M Harris, eds., \nPeptide and Protein PEGylation\n, Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews, 54(4); 453-609 (2002); Zalipsky, S., et al., “\nUse of Functionalized Poly\n(\nEthylene Glycols\n) \nfor Modification of Polypeptides\n” in \nPolyethylene Glycol Chemistry: Biotechnical and Biomedical Applications\n, J. M. Harris, ed., Plenus Press, New York (1992); Zalipsky (1995) \nAdvanced Drug Reviews \n16:157-182, and in Roberts, et al., \nAdv. Drug Delivery Reviews, \n54, 459-476 (2002).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional PEG reagents suitable for use in forming a conjugate of the invention, and methods of conjugation are described in the Pasut. G., et al., \nExpert Opin. Ther. Patents \n(2004), 14(5). PEG reagents suitable for use in the present invention also include those available from NOF Corporation, as described generally on the NOF website (http://nofamerica.net/store/). Products listed therein and their chemical structures are expressly incorporated herein by reference. Additional PEGs for use in forming an OGF peptide conjugate of the invention include those available from Polypure (Norway) and from QuantaBioDesign LTD (Ohio), where the contents of their catalogs with respect to available PEG reagents are expressly incorporated herein by reference. In addition, water soluble polymer reagents useful for preparing peptide conjugates of the invention can be prepared synthetically. Descriptions of the water soluble polymer reagent synthesis can be found in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,252,714, 5,650,234, 5,739,208, 5,932,462, 5,629,384, 5,672,662, 5,990,237, 6,448,369, 6,362,254, 6,495,659, 6,413,507, 6,376,604, 6,348,558, 6,602,498, and 7,026,440.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypically, the weight-average molecular weight of the water-soluble polymer in the conjugate is from about 100 Daltons to about 150,000 Daltons. Exemplary ranges include weight-average molecular weights in the range of from about 250 Daltons to about 80,000 Daltons, from 500 Daltons to about 80,000 Daltons, from about 500 Daltons to about 65,000 Daltons, from about 500 Daltons to about 40,000 Daltons, from about 750 Daltons to about 40,000 Daltons, from about 1000 Daltons to about 30,000 Daltons. In a preferred embodiment, the weight average molecular weight of the water-soluble polymer in the conjugate ranges from about 1000 Daltons to about 10,000 Daltons. In certain other preferred embodiments, the range is from about 1000 Daltons to about 5000 Daltons, from about 5000 Daltons to about 10,000 Daltons, from about 2500 Daltons to about 7500 Daltons, from about 1000 Daltons to about 3000 Daltons, from about 3000 Daltons to about 7000 Daltons, or from about 7000 Daltons to about 10,000 Daltons. In a further preferred embodiment, the weight average molecular weight of the water-soluble polymer in the conjugate ranges from about 20,000 Daltons to about 40,000 Daltons. In other preferred embodiments, the range is from about 20,000 Daltons to about 30,000 Daltons, from about 30,000 Daltons to about 40,000 Daltons, from about 25,000 Daltons to about 35,000 Daltons, from about 20,000 Daltons to about 26,000 Daltons, from about 26,000 Daltons to about 34,000 Daltons, or from about 34,000 Daltons to about 40,000 Daltons.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor any given water-soluble polymer, a molecular weight in one or more of these ranges is typical. Generally, an OGF peptide conjugate in accordance with the invention, when intended for subcutaneous or intravenous administration, will comprise a PEG or other suitable water-soluble polymer having a weight average molecular weight of about 20,000 Daltons or greater, while an OGF peptide conjugate intended for pulmonary administration will generally, although not necessarily, comprise a PEG polymer having a weight average molecular weight of about 20,000 Daltons or less.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary weight-average molecular weights for the water-soluble polymer include about 100 Daltons, about 200 Daltons, about 300 Daltons, about 400 Daltons, about 500 Daltons, about 600 Daltons, about 700 Daltons, about 750 Daltons, about 800 Daltons, about 900 Daltons, about 1,000 Daltons, about 1,500 Daltons, about 2,000 Daltons, about 2,200 Daltons, about 2,500 Daltons, about 3,000 Daltons, about 4,000 Daltons, about 4,400 Daltons, about 4,500 Daltons, about 5,000 Daltons, about 5,500 Daltons, about 6,000 Daltons, about 7,000 Daltons, about 7,500 Daltons, about 8,000 Daltons, about 9,000 Daltons, about 10,000 Daltons, about 11,000 Daltons, about 12,000 Daltons, about 13,000 Daltons, about 14,000 Daltons, about 15,000 Daltons, about 20,000 Daltons, about 22,500 Daltons, about 25,000 Daltons, about 30,000 Daltons, about 35,000 Daltons, about 40,000 Daltons, about 45,000 Daltons, about 50,000 Daltons, about 55,000 Daltons, about 60,000 Daltons, about 65,000 Daltons, about 70,000 Daltons, and about 75,000 Daltons.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBranched versions of the water-soluble polymer (e.g., a branched 40,000 Dalton water-soluble polymer comprised of two 20,000 Dalton polymers or the like) having a total molecular weight of any of the foregoing can also be used. In one or more particular embodiments, depending upon the other features of the subject OGF peptide polymer conjugate, the conjugate is one that does not have one or more attached PEG moieties having a weight-average molecular weight of less than about 6,000 Daltons.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn instances in which the water-soluble polymer is a PEG, the PEG will typically comprise a number of (OCH\n2\nCH\n2\n) monomers. As used herein, the number of repeat units is typically identified by the subscript “n” in, for example, “(OCH\n2\nCH\n2\n)\nn\n.” Thus, the value of (n) typically falls within one or more of the following ranges: from 2 to about 3400, from about 100 to about 2300, from about 100 to about 2270, from about 136 to about 2050, from about 225 to about 1930, from about 450 to about 1930, from about 1200 to about 1930, from about 568 to about 2727, from about 660 to about 2730, from about 795 to about 2730, from about 795 to about 2730, from about 909 to about 2730, and from about 1,200 to about 1,900. Preferred ranges of n include from about 10 to about 700, and from about 10 to about 1800. For any given polymer in which the molecular weight is known, it is possible to determine the number of repeating units (i.e., “n”) by dividing the total weight-average molecular weight of the polymer by the molecular weight of the repeating monomer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWith regard to the molecular weight of the water-soluble polymer, in one or more embodiments of the invention, depending upon the other features of the particular OGF peptide conjugate, the conjugate comprises an OGF peptide covalently attached to a water-soluble polymer having a molecular weight greater than about 2,000 Daltons.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA polymer for use in the invention may be end-capped, that is, a polymer having at least one terminus capped with a relatively inert group, such as a lower alkoxy group (i.e., a C\n1-6 \nalkoxy group) or a hydroxyl group. One frequently employed end-capped polymer is methoxy-PEG (commonly referred to as mPEG), wherein one terminus of the polymer is a methoxy (—OCH\n3\n) group. The —PEG-symbol used in the foregoing generally represents the following structural unit: —CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO—(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)\nn\n—CH\n2\nCH\n2\n—, where (n) generally ranges from about zero to about 4,000.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMulti-armed or branched PEG molecules, such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,932,462, are also suitable for use in the present invention. For example, the PEG may be described generally according to the structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwhere poly\na \nand poly\nb \nare PEG backbones (either the same or different), such as methoxy poly(ethylene glycol); R″ is a non-reactive moiety, such as H, methyl or a PEG backbone; and P and Q are non-reactive linkages. In one embodiment, the branched PEG molecule is one that includes a lysine residue, such as the following reactive PEG suitable for use in forming an OGF peptide conjugate. Although the branched PEG below is shown with a reactive succinimidyl group, this represents only one of a myriad of reactive functional groups suitable for reacting with an OGF peptide.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some instances, the polymeric reagent (as well as the corresponding conjugate prepared from the polymeric reagent) may lack a lysine residue in which the polymeric portions are connected to amine groups of the lysine via a “—OCH\n2\nCONHCH\n2\nCO—” group. In still other instances, the polymeric reagent (as well as the corresponding conjugate prepared from the polymeric reagent) may lack a branched water-soluble polymer that includes a lysine residue (wherein the lysine residue is used to effect branching).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional branched-PEGs for use in forming an OGF peptide conjugate of the present invention include those described in co-owned U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2005/0009988. Representative branched polymers described therein include those having the following generalized structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwhere POLY\n1 \nis a water-soluble polymer; POLY\n2 \nis a water-soluble polymer; (a) is 0, 1, 2 or 3; (b) is 0, 1, 2 or 3; (e) is 0, 1, 2 or 3; (f) is 0, 1, 2 or 3; (g′) is 0, 1, 2 or 3; (h) is 0, 1, 2 or 3; (j) is 0 to 20; each R\n1 \nis independently H or an organic radical selected from alkyl, substituted alkyl, alkenyl, substituted alkenyl, alkynyl, substituted alkynyl, aryl and substituted aryl; X\n1\n, when present, is a spacer moiety; X\n2\n, when present, is a spacer moiety; X\n5\n, when present, is a spacer moiety; X\n6\n, when present, is a spacer moiety; X\n7\n, when present, is a spacer moiety; X\n8\n, when present, is a spacer moiety; R\n5 \nis a branching moiety; and Z is a reactive group for coupling to an OGF peptide, optionally via an intervening spacer. POLY\n1 \nand POLY\n2 \nin the preceding branched polymer structure may be different or identical, i.e., are of the same polymer type (structure) and molecular weight.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA preferred branched polymer falling into the above classification suitable for use in the present invention is:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwhere (m) is 2 to 4000, and (f) is 0 to 6 and (n) is 0 to 20.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBranched polymers suitable for preparing a conjugate of the invention also include those represented more generally by the formula R(POLY)\ny\n, where R is a central or core molecule from which extends 2 or more POLY arms such as PEG. The variable y represents the number of POLY arms, where each of the polymer arms can independently be end-capped or alternatively, possess a reactive functional group at its terminus. A more explicit structure in accordance with this embodiment of the invention possesses the structure, R(POLY-Z)\ny\n, where each Z is independently an end-capping group or a reactive group, e.g., suitable for reaction with an OGF peptide. In yet a further embodiment when Z is a reactive group, upon reaction with an OGF peptide, the resulting linkage can be hydrolytically stable, or alternatively, may be degradable, i.e., hydrolyzable. Typically, at least one polymer arm possesses a terminal functional group suitable for reaction with, e.g., an OGF peptide. Branched PEGs such as those represented generally by the formula, R(PEG)\ny \nabove possess 2 polymer arms to about 300 polymer arms (i.e., n ranges from 2 to about 300). Preferably, such branched PEGs typically possess from 2 to about 25 polymer arms, such as from 2 to about 20 polymer arms, from 2 to about 15 polymer arms, or from 3 to about 15 polymer arms. Multi-armed polymers include those having 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 arms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCore molecules in branched PEGs as described above include polyols, which are then further functionalized. Such polyols include aliphatic polyols having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms and from 1 to 10 hydroxyl groups, including ethylene glycol, alkane diols, alkyl glycols, alkylidene alkyl diols, alkyl cycloalkane diols, 1,5-decalindiol, 4,8-bis(hydroxymethyl)tricyclodecane, cycloalkylidene diols, dihydroxyalkanes, trihydroxyalkanes, and the like. Cycloaliphatic polyols may also be employed, including straight chained or closed-ring sugars and sugar alcohols, such as mannitol, sorbitol, inositol, xylitol, quebrachitol, threitol, arabitol, erythritol, adonitol, ducitol, facose, ribose, arabinose, xylose, lyxose, rhamnose, galactose, glucose, fructose, sorbose, mannose, pyranose, altrose, talose, tagitose, pyranosides, sucrose, lactose, maltose, and the like. Additional aliphatic polyols include derivatives of glyceraldehyde, glucose, ribose, mannose, galactose, and related stereoisomers. Other core polyols that may be used include crown ether, cyclodextrins, dextrins and other carbohydrates such as starches and amylose. Typical polyols include glycerol, pentaerythritol, sorbitol, and trimethylolpropane.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs will be described in more detail in the linker section below, although any of a number of linkages can be used to covalently attach a polymer to an OGF peptide, in certain instances, the linkage is degradable, designated herein as L\nD\n, that is to say, contains at least one bond or moiety that hydrolyzes under physiological conditions, e.g., an ester, hydrolyzable carbamate, carbonate, or other such group. In other instances, the linkage is hydrolytically stable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIllustrative multi-armed PEGs having 3 arms, 4 arms, and 8 arms are known and are available commercially and/or can be prepared following techniques known to those skilled in the art. Multi-armed activated polymers for use in the method of the invention include those corresponding to the following structure, where E represents a reactive group suitable for reaction with a reactive group on the OGF peptide. In one or more embodiments, E is an —OH (for reaction with an OGF peptide carboxy group or equivalent), a carboxylic acid or equivalent (such as an active ester), a carbonic acid (for reaction with OGF peptide —OH groups), or an amino group.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the structure above, PEG is —(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)\nn\nCH\n2\nCH\n2\n—, and m is selected from 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. In certain embodiments, typical linkages are ester, carboxyl and hydrolyzable carbamate, such that the polymer-portion of the conjugate is hydrolyzed in vivo to release the OGF peptide from the intact polymer conjugate. In such instances, the linker L is designated as L\nD\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the polymer may possess an overall forked structure as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,362,254. This type of polymer segment is useful for reaction with two OGF peptide moieties, where the two OGF peptide moieties are positioned a precise or predetermined distance apart.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn any of the representative structures provided herein, one or more degradable linkages may additionally be contained in the polymer segment, POLY, to allow generation in vivo of a conjugate having a smaller PEG chain than in the initially administered conjugate. Appropriate physiologically cleavable (i.e., releasable) linkages include but are not limited to ester, carbonate ester, carbamate, sulfate, phosphate, acyloxyalkyl ether, acetal, and ketal. Such linkages when contained in a given polymer segment will often be stable upon storage and upon initial administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe PEG polymer used to prepare an OGF peptide polymer conjugate may comprise a pendant PEG molecule having reactive groups, such as carboxyl or amino, covalently attached along the length of the PEG rather than at the end of the PEG chain(s). The pendant reactive groups can be attached to the PEG directly or through a spacer moiety, such as an alkylene group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, an OGF peptide polymer conjugate according to one aspect of the invention is one comprising an OGF peptide releasably attached, preferably at its N-terminus, to a water-soluble polymer. Hydrolytically degradable linkages, useful not only as a degradable linkage within a polymer backbone, but also, in the case of certain embodiments of the invention, for covalently attaching a water-soluble polymer to an OGF peptide, include: carbonate; imine resulting, for example, from reaction of an amine and an aldehyde (see, e.g., Ouchi et al. (1997) \nPolymer Preprints \n38(1):582-3); phosphate ester, formed, for example, by reacting an alcohol with a phosphate group; hydrazone, e.g., formed by reaction of a hydrazide and an aldehyde; acetal, e.g., formed by reaction of an aldehyde and an alcohol; orthoester, formed, for example, by reaction between a formate and an alcohol; and esters, and certain urethane (carbamate) linkages.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIllustrative PEG reagents for use in preparing a releasable OGF peptide conjugate in accordance with the invention are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,348,558, 5,612,460, 5,840,900, 5,880,131, and 6,376,470.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional PEG reagents for use in the invention include hydrolyzable and/or releasable PEGs and linkers such as those described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2006-0293499. In the resulting conjugate, the OGF peptide and the polymer are each covalently attached to different positions of the aromatic scaffold, e.g., Fmoc or FMS structure, and are releasable under physiological conditions. Generalized structures corresponding to the polymers described therein are provided below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, one such polymeric reagent comprises the following structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwhere POLY\n1 \nis a first water-soluble polymer; POLY\n2 \nis a second water-soluble polymer; X\n1 \nis a first spacer moiety; X\n2 \nis a second spacer moiety;\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nis an aromatic-containing moiety bearing an ionizable hydrogen atom, H\nα\n; R\n1 \nis H or an organic radical; R\n2 \nis H or an organic radical; and (FG) is a functional group capable of reacting with an amino group of an active agent to form a releasable linkage, such as a carbamate linkage (such as N-succinimidyloxy, 1-benzotriazolyloxy, oxycarbonylimidazole, —O—C(O)—Cl, O—C(O)—Br, unsubstituted aromatic carbonate radicals and substituted aromatic carbonate radicals). The polymeric reagent can include one, two, three, four or more electron altering groups attached to the aromatic-containing moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred aromatic-containing moieties are bicyclic and tricyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Fused bicyclic and tricyclic aromatics include pentalene, indene, naphthalene, azulene, heptalene, biphenylene, as-indacene, s-indacene, acenaphthylene, fluorene, phenalene, phenanthrene, anthracene, and fluoranthene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA preferred polymer reagent possesses the following structure,\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwhere mPEG corresponds to CH\n3\nO—(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)\nn\nCH\n2\nCH\n2\n—, X\n1 \nand X\n2 \nare each independently a spacer moiety having an atom length of from about 1 to about 18 atoms, n ranges from 10 to 1800, p is an integer ranging from 1 to 8, R\n1 \nis H or lower alkyl, R\n2 \nis H or lower alkyl, and Ar is an aromatic hydrodrocarbon, preferably a bicyclic or tricyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. FG is as defined above. Preferably, FG corresponds to an activated carbonate ester suitable for reaction with an amino group on OGF peptide. Preferred spacer moieties, X\n1 \nand X\n2\n, include —NH—C(O)—CH\n2\n—O—, —NH—C(O)—(CH\n2\n)\nq\n—O—, —NH—C(O)—(CH\n2\n)\nq\n—C(O)—NH—, —NH—C(O)—(CH\n2\n)\nq\n—, and —C(O)—NH—, where q is selected from 2, 3, 4, and 5. Preferably, although not necessarily, the nitrogen in the preceding spacers is proximal to the PEG rather than to the aromatic moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother such branched (2-armed) polymeric reagent comprised of two electron altering groups comprises the following structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein each of POLY\n1\n, POLY\n2\n, R\n1\n, R\n2\n,\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nand (FG) is as defined immediately above, and R\ne1 \nis a first electron altering group; and R\ne2 \nis a second electron altering group. An electron altering group is a group that is either electron donating (and therefore referred to as an “electron donating group”), or electron withdrawing (and therefore referred to as an “electron withdrawing group”). When attached to the aromatic-containing moiety bearing an ionizable hydrogen atom, an electron donating group is a group having the ability to position electrons away from itself and closer to or within the aromatic-containing moiety. When attached to the aromatic-containing moiety bearing an ionizable hydrogen atom, an electron withdrawing group is a group having the ability to position electrons toward itself and away from the aromatic-containing moiety. Hydrogen is used as the standard for comparison in the determination of whether a given group positions electrons away or toward itself. Preferred electron altering groups include, but are not limited to, —CF\n3\n, —CH\n2\nCF\n3\n, —CH\n2\nC\n6\nF\n5\n, —CN, —NO\n2\n, —S(O)R, —S(O)Aryl, —S(O\n2\n)R, —S(O\n2\n)Aryl, —S(O\n2\n)OR, —S(O\n2\n)OAryl, —S(O\n2\n)NHR, —S(O\n2\n)NHAryl, —C(O)R, —C(O)Aryl, —C(O)OR, —C(O)NHR, and the like, wherein R is H or an organic radical.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn additional branched polymeric reagent suitable for use in the present invention comprises the following structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwhere POLY\n1 \nis a first water-soluble polymer; POLY\n2 \nis a second water-soluble polymer; X\n1 \nis a first spacer moiety; X\n2 \nis a second spacer moiety; Ar\n1 \nis a first aromatic moiety; Ar\n2 \nis a second aromatic moiety; H\nα\n is an ionizable hydrogen atom; R\n1 \nis H or an organic radical; R\n2 \nis H or an organic radical; and (FG) is a functional group capable of reacting with an amino group of OGF peptide to form a releasable linkage, such as carbamate linkage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother exemplary polymeric reagent comprises the following structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein each of POLY\n1\n, POLY\n2\n, X\n1\n, X\n2\n, Ar\n1\n, Ar\n2\n, H\nα\n, R\n1\n, R\n2\n, and (FG) is as previously defined, and R\ne1 \nis a first electron altering group.

Of course, PEGs of any molecular weight as set forth herein may be employed in the above structures, and the particular activating groups described above are not meant to be limiting in any respect, and may be substituted by any other suitable activating group suitable for reaction with a reactive group present on the OGF peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThose of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the foregoing discussion describing water-soluble polymers for use in forming an OGF peptide conjugate is by no means exhaustive and is merely illustrative, and that all polymeric materials having the qualities described above are contemplated. As used herein, the term “polymeric reagent” generally refers to an entire molecule, which can comprise a water-soluble polymer segment, as well as additional spacers and functional groups.\n\n\n \nThe Linkage\n\n\n \n \n \nThe particular linkage between the OGF peptide and the water-soluble polymer depends on a number of factors. Such factors include, for example, the particular linkage chemistry employed, the particular spacer moieties utilized, if any, the particular OGF peptide, the available functional groups within the OGF peptide (either for attachment to a polymer or conversion to a suitable attachment site), and the possible presence of additional reactive functional groups or absence of functional groups within the OGF peptide due to modifications made to the peptide such as methylation and/or glycosylation, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one or more embodiments of the invention, the linkage between the OGF peptide and the water-soluble polymer is a releasable linkage. That is, the water-soluble polymer is cleaved (either through hydrolysis, an enzymatic processes, or otherwise), thereby resulting in an unconjugated OGF peptide. Preferably, the releasable linkage is a hydrolytically degradable linkage, where upon hydrolysis, the OGF peptide, or a slightly modified version thereof, is released. The releasable linkage may result in the water-soluble polymer (and any spacer moiety) detaching from the OGF peptide in vivo (and in vitro) without leaving any fragment of the water-soluble polymer (and/or any spacer moiety or linker) attached to the OGF peptide. Exemplary releasable linkages include carbonate, carboxylate ester, phosphate ester, thiolester, anhydrides, acetals, ketals, acyloxyalkyl ether, imines, carbamates, and orthoesters. Such linkages can be readily formed by reaction of the OGF peptide and/or the polymeric reagent using coupling methods commonly employed in the art. Hydrolyzable linkages are often readily formed by reaction of a suitably activated polymer with a non-modified functional group contained within the OGF peptide. Preferred positions for covalent attachment of a water-soluble polymer induce the N-terminal, the C-terminal, as well as the internal lysines. Preferred releasable linkages include carbamate and ester.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally speaking, a preferred OGF peptide conjugate of the invention will possess the following generalized structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwhere POLY is a water-soluble polymer such as any of the illustrative polymeric reagents provided in Tables 2-4 herein, X is a linker, and in some embodiments a hydrolyzable linkage (L\nD\n), and k is an integer selected from 1, 2, and 3, and in some \n \n \n \n \ninstances\n \n \n \n \n 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10. In the generalized structure above, where X is L\nD\n, L\nD \nrefers to the hydrolyzable linkage per se (e.g., a carbamate or an ester linkage), while “POLY” is meant to include the polymer repeat units, e.g., CH\n3\n(OCH\n2\nCH\n2\n)\nn\n—, and OGF is used to describe OGF. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, at least one of the water-soluble polymer molecules is covalently attached to the N-terminus of OGF peptide. In one embodiment of the invention, k equals 1 and X is —O—C(O)—NH—, where the —NH— is part of the OGF peptide residue and represents an amino group thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough releasable linkages are exemplary, the linkage between the OGF peptide and the water-soluble polymer (or the linker moiety that is attached to the polymer) may be a hydrolytically stable linkage, such as an amide, a urethane (also known as carbamate), amine, thioether (also known as sulfide), or urea (also known as carbamide). One such embodiment of the invention comprises an OGF peptide having a water-soluble polymer such as PEG covalently attached at the N-terminus of OGF peptide. In such instances, alkylation of the N-terminal residue permits retention of the charge on the N-terminal nitrogen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWith regard to linkages, in one or more embodiments of the invention, a conjugate is provided that comprises an OGF peptide covalently attached at an amino acid residue, either directly or through a linker comprised of one or more atoms, to a water-soluble polymer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe conjugates (as opposed to an unconjugated OGF peptide) may or may not possess a measurable degree of OGF peptide activity. That is to say, a conjugate in accordance with the invention will typically possess anywhere from about 0% to about 100% or more of the OGF activity of the unmodified parent OGF peptide. Typically, compounds possessing little or no OGF activity contain a releasable linkage connecting the polymer to the OGF peptide, so that regardless of the lack of OGF activity in the conjugate, the active parent molecule (or a derivative thereof having OGF activity) is released by cleavage of the linkage (e.g., hydrolysis upon aqueous-induced cleavage of the linkage). Such activity may be determined using a suitable in vivo or in vitro model, depending upon the known activity of the particular moiety having OGF peptide activity employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOptimally, cleavage of a linkage is facilitated through the use of hydrolytically cleavable and/or enzymatically cleavable linkages such as urethane, amide, certain carbamate, carbonate or ester-containing linkages. In this way, clearance of the conjugate via cleavage of individual water-soluble polymer(s) can be modulated by selecting the polymer molecular size and the type of functional group for providing the desired clearance properties. In certain instances, a mixture of polymer conjugates is employed where the polymers possess structural or other differences effective to alter the release (e.g., hydrolysis rate) of the OGF peptide, such that one can achieve a desired sustained delivery profile.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne of ordinary skill in the art can determine the proper molecular size of the polymer as well as the cleavable functional group, depending upon several factors including the mode of administration. For example, one of ordinary skill in the art, using routine experimentation, can determine a proper molecular size and cleavable functional group by first preparing a variety of polymer-OGF peptide conjugates with different weight-average molecular weights, degradable functional groups, and chemical structures, and then obtaining the clearance profile for each conjugate by administering the conjugate to a patient and taking periodic blood and/or urine samples. Once a series of clearance profiles has been obtained for each tested conjugate, a conjugate or mixture of conjugates having the desired clearance profile(s) can be determined.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor conjugates possessing a hydrolytically stable linkage that couples the OGF peptide to the water-soluble polymer, the conjugate will typically possess a measurable degree of OGF activity. For instance, such conjugates are typically characterized as having an OGF activity satisfying one or more of the following percentages relative to that of the unconjugated OGF peptide: at least 2%, at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 15%, at least 25%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 97%, at least 100%, more than 105%, more than 10-fold, or more than 100-fold (when measured in a suitable model, such as those presented here and/or known in the art). Often, conjugates having a hydrolytically stable linkage (e.g., an amide linkage) will possess at least some degree of the OGF activity of the unmodified parent OGF peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary conjugates in accordance with the invention will now be described. Amino groups on an OGF peptide provide a point of attachment between the OGF peptide and the water-soluble polymer. For example, an OGF peptide may comprise one or more lysine residues, each lysine residue containing an ε-amino group that may be available for conjugation, as well as the amino terminus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are a number of examples of suitable water-soluble polymeric reagents useful for forming covalent linkages with available amines of an OGF peptide. Certain specific examples, along with the corresponding conjugates, are provided in Table 2 below. In the table, the variable (n) represents the number of repeating monomeric units and “OGF” represents an OGF peptide following conjugation to the water-soluble polymer. While each polymeric portion [e.g., (OCH\n2\nCH\n2\n)\nn \nor (CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)\nn\n] presented in Table 2 terminates in a “CH\n3\n” group, other groups (e.g., H or benzyl) can be substituted therefore.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs will be clearly understood by one skilled in the art, for conjugates such as those set forth below resulting from reaction with an OGF peptide amino group, the amino group extending from the OGF peptide designation “˜\nNH\n-OGF” represents the residue of the OGF peptide itself in which the ˜NH— is an amino group of the OGF peptide. One preferred site of attachment for the polymeric reagents shown below is the N-terminus. Further, although the conjugates in Tables 2-4 herein illustrate a single water-soluble polymer covalently attached to an OGF peptide, it will be understood that the conjugate structures on the right are meant to also encompass conjugates having more than one of such water-soluble polymer molecules covalently attached to OGF peptide, e.g., 2, 3, or 4 water-soluble polymer molecules.\n\n\n \n

In one approach, an OGF peptide is conjugated to a polymeric reagent functionalized with an active ester such as a succinimidyl derivative (e.g., an N-hydroxysuccinimide ester). In this approach, the polymeric reagent bearing the reactive ester is reacted with the OGF peptide in aqueous media under appropriate pH conditions, e.g., from pHs ranging from about 3 to about 8, about 3 to about 7, or about 4 to about 6.5. Most polymer active esters can couple to a target peptide such as OGF peptide at physiological pH, e.g., at 7.0. However, less reactive derivatives may require a different pH. Typically, activated PEGs can be attached to a peptide such as OGF peptide at pHs from about 7.0 to about 10.0 for covalent attachment to an internal lysine. Typically, lower pHs are used, e.g., 4 to about 5.75, for preferential covalent attachment to the N-terminus. Thus, different reaction conditions (e.g., different pHs or different temperatures) can result in the attachment of a water-soluble polymer such as PEG to different locations on the OGF peptide (e.g., internal lysines versus the N-terminus). Coupling reactions can often be carried out at room temperature, although lower temperatures may be required for particularly labile OGF peptide moieties. Reaction times are typically on the order of minutes, e.g., 30 minutes, to hours, e.g., from about 1 to about 36 hours), depending upon the pH and temperature of the reaction. N-terminal PEGylation, e.g., with a PEG reagent bearing an aldehyde group, is typically conducted under mild conditions, pHs from about 5-10, for about 6 to 36 hours. Varying ratios of polymeric reagent to OGF peptide may be employed, e.g., from an equimolar ratio up to a 10-fold molar excess of polymer reagent. Typically, up to a 5-fold molar excess of polymer reagent will suffice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain instances, it may be preferable to protect certain amino acids from reaction with a particular polymeric reagent if site specific or site selective covalent attachment is desired using commonly employed protection/deprotection methodologies such as those well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an alternative approach to direct coupling reactions, the PEG reagent may be incorporated at a desired position of the OGF peptide during peptide synthesis. In this way, site-selective introduction of one or more PEGs can be achieved. See, e.g., International Patent Publication No. WO 95/00162, which describes the site selective synthesis of conjugated peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary conjugates that can be prepared using, for example, polymeric reagents containing a reactive ester for coupling to an amino group of OGF peptide, comprise the following alpha-branched structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwhere POLY is a water-soluble polymer, (a) is either zero or one; X\n1\n, when present, is a spacer moiety comprised of one or more atoms; R\n1 \nis hydrogen an organic radical; and “˜\nNH\n-OGF” represents a residue of an OGF peptide, where the underlined amino group represents an amino group of the OGF peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWith respect to the structure corresponding to that referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph, any of the water-soluble polymers provided herein can be defined as POLY, any of the spacer moieties provided herein can be defined as X\n1 \n(when present), any of the organic radicals provided herein can be defined as R\n1 \n(in instances where R\n1 \nis not hydrogen), and any of the OGF peptides provided herein can be employed. In one or more embodiments corresponding to the structure referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph, POLY is a poly(ethylene glycol) such as H\n3\nCO(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)\nn\n—, wherein (n) is an integer having a value of from 3 to 4000, more preferably from 10 to about 1800; (a) is one; X\n1 \nis a C\n1-6 \nalkylene, such as one selected from methylene (i.e., —CH\n2\n—), ethylene (i.e., —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—) and propylene (i.e., —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—); R\n1 \nis H or lower alkyl such as methyl or ethyl; and OGF corresponds to any OGF peptide disclosed herein, including in Table 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypical of another approach for conjugating an OGF peptide to a polymeric reagent is reductive amination. Typically, reductive amination is employed to conjugate a primary amine of an OGF peptide with a polymeric reagent functionalized with a ketone, aldehyde or a hydrated form thereof (e.g., ketone hydrate and aldehyde hydrate). In this approach, the primary amine from the OGF peptide (e.g., the N-terminus) reacts with the carbonyl group of the aldehyde or ketone (or the corresponding hydroxy-containing group of a hydrated aldehyde or ketone), thereby forming a Schiff base. The Schiff base, in turn, is then reductively converted to a stable conjugate through use of a reducing agent such as sodium borohydride or any other suitable reducing agent. Selective reactions (e.g., at the N-terminus) are possible, particularly with a polymer functionalized with a ketone or an alpha-methyl branched aldehyde and/or under specific reaction conditions (e.g., reduced pH).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary conjugates that can be prepared using, for example, polymeric reagents containing an aldehyde (or aldehyde hydrate) or ketone or (ketone hydrate) possess the following structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwhere POLY is a water-soluble polymer; (d) is either zero or one; X\n2\n, when present, is a spacer moiety comprised of one or more atoms; (b) is an integer having a value of one through ten; (c) is an integer having a value of one through ten; R\n2\n, in each occurrence, is independently H or an organic radical; R\n3\n, in each occurrence, is independently H or an organic radical; and “˜\nNH\n-OGF” represents a residue of an OGF peptide, where the underlined amino group represents an amino group of the OGF peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nYet another illustrative conjugate of the invention possesses the structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwhere k ranges from 1 to 3, and n ranges from 10 to about 1800.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWith respect to the structure corresponding to that referred to in immediately preceding paragraph, any of the water-soluble polymers provided herein can be defined as POLY, any of the spacer moieties provided herein can be defined as X\n2 \n(when present), any of the organic radicals provided herein can be independently defined as R\n2 \nand R\n3 \n(in instances where R\n2 \nand R\n3 \nare independently not hydrogen), and any of the OGF moieties provided herein can be defined as an OGF peptide. In one or more embodiments of the structure referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph, POLY is a poly(ethylene glycol) such as H\n3\nCO(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)\nn\n—, wherein (n) is an integer having a value of from 3 to 4000, more preferably from 10 to about 1800; (d) is one; X\n1 \nis amide [e.g., —C(O)NH—]; (b) is 2 through 6, such as 4; (c) is 2 through 6, such as 4; each of R\n2 \nand R\n3 \nare independently H or lower alkyl, such as methyl when lower alkyl; and OGF is OGF peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother example of an OGF peptide conjugate in accordance with the invention has the following structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein each (n) is independently an integer having a value of from 3 to 4000, preferably from 10 to 1800; X\n2 \nis as previously defined; (b) is 2 through 6; (c) is 2 through 6; R\n2\n, in each occurrence, is independently H or lower alkyl; and “˜\nNH\n-OGF” represents a residue of an OGF peptide, where the underlined amino group represents an amino group of the OGF peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional OGF peptide polymer conjugates resulting from reaction of a water-soluble polymer with an amino group of OGF peptide are provided below.

The value of k indicates the number of water-soluble polymer molecules attached to different sites on the OGF peptide. In a preferred embodiment, R\n1 \nand R\n2 \nare both H. The spacer moieties, X\n1 \nand X\n2\n, preferably each contain one amide bond. In a preferred embodiment, X\n1 \nand X\n2 \nare the same. Preferred spacers, i.e., X\n1 \nand X\n2\n, include —NH—C(O)—CH\n2\n—O—, —NH—C(O)—(CH\n2\n)\nq\n—O—, —NH—C(O)—(CH\n2\n)\nq\n—C(O)—NH—, —NH—C(O)—(CH\n2\n)\nq\n—, and —C(O)—NH—, where q is selected from 2, 3, 4, and 5. Although the spacers can be in either orientation, preferably, the nitrogen is proximal to the PEG rather than to the aromatic moiety. Illustrative aromatic moieties include pentalene, indene, naphthalene, indacene, acenaphthylene, and fluorene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParticularly preferred conjugates of this type are provided below.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional OGF peptide conjugates resulting from covalent attachment to amino groups of OGF peptide that are also releasable include the following:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwhere X is either —O— or —NH—C(O)—, Ar\ni \nis an aromatic group, e.g., ortho, meta, or para-substituted phenyl, and k is an integer selected from 1, 2, and 3.

No. 6,214,966. Such water-soluble polymers result in a releasable linkage following conjugation, and possess at least one releasable ester linkage close to the covalent attachment to the active agent. The polymers generally possess the following structure, PEG-W—CO\n2\n—NHS or an equivalent activated ester, where\n\n\n \n \n \nW=—O\n2\nC—(CH\n2\n)\nb\n—O— b=1-5\n\n\n\n \n \n \n—O—(CH\n2\n)\nb\nCO\n2\n—(CH\n2\n)\nc\n— b=1-5, c=2-5\n\n\n\n \n \n \n—O—(CH\n2\n)\nb\n—CO\n2\n—(CH\n2\n)\nc\n—O— b=1-5, c=2-5\n\n\n\n \n \nand NHS is N-hydroxysuccinimidyl. Upon hydrolysis, the resulting released active agent, e.g., OGF peptide, will possess a short tag resulting from hydrolysis of the ester functionality of the polymer reagent. Illustrative releasable conjugates of this type include: mPEG-β-(CH\n2\n)\nb\n—COOCH\n2\nC(O)—NH-OGF peptide, and mPEG-O—(CH\n2\n)\nb\n—COO—CH(CH\n3\n)—CH\n2\n—C(O)—NH-OGF peptide, where the number of water-soluble polymers attached to OGF peptide can be anywhere from 1 to 4, or more preferably, from 1 to 3.\n\n\n \nCarboxyl Coupling and Resulting Conjugates\n\n\n \n \n \nCarboxyl groups represent another functional group that can serve as a point of attachment to the OGF peptide. The conjugate will have the following structure:\n\n\n \n \n \n(OGF)—C(O)—X-POLY\n\n\n\n \n \nwhere OGF—C(O)˜corresponds to a residue of an OGF peptide where the carbonyl is a carbonyl (derived from the carboxy group) of the OGF peptide, X is a spacer moiety, such as a heteroatom selected from O, N(H), and S, and POLY is a water-soluble polymer such as PEG, optionally terminating in an end-capping moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe C(O)—X linkage results from the reaction between a polymeric derivative bearing a terminal functional group and a carboxyl-containing OGF peptide. As discussed above, the specific linkage will depend on the type of functional group utilized. If the polymer is end-functionalized or “activated” with a hydroxyl group, the resulting linkage will be a carboxylic acid ester and X will be O. If the polymer backbone is functionalized with a thiol group, the resulting linkage will be a thioester and X will be S. When certain multi-arm, branched or forked polymers are employed, the C(O)X moiety, and in particular the X moiety, may be relatively more complex and may include a longer linker structure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolymeric reagents containing a hydrazide moiety are also suitable for conjugation at a carbonyl. To the extent that the OGF peptide does not contain a carbonyl moiety, a carbonyl moiety can be introduced by reducing any carboxylic acid functionality (e.g., the C-terminal carboxylic acid). Specific examples of polymeric reagents comprising a hydrazide moiety, along with the corresponding conjugates, are provided in Table 3, below. In addition, any polymeric reagent comprising an activated ester (e.g., a succinimidyl group) can be converted to contain a hydrazide moiety by reacting the polymer activated ester with hydrazine (NH\n2\n—NH\n2\n) or tert-butyl carbamate [NH\n2\nNHCO\n2\nC(CH\n3\n)\n3\n]. In the table, the variable (n) represents the number of repeating monomeric units and “═C—OGF” represents a residue of an OGF peptide following conjugation to the polymeric reagent were the underlined C is part of the OGF peptide. Optionally, the hydrazone linkage can be reduced using a suitable reducing agent.

The maleamic acid, in turn, can react with an amine or thiol group of an OGF peptide. Exemplary maleamic acid-based reactions are schematically shown below. POLY represents the water-soluble polymer, and ˜S-OGF represents a residue of an OGF peptide, where the S is derived from a thiol group of the OGF peptide.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThiol PEGylation is specific for free thiol groups on the OGF peptide. Tyically, a polymer maleimide is conjugated to a sulfhydryl-containing OGF peptide at pHs ranging from about 6-9 (e.g., at 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, or 9), more preferably at pHs from about 7-9, and even more preferably at pHs from about 7 to 8. Generally, a slight molar excess of polymer maleimide is employed, for example, a 1.5 to 15-fold molar excess, preferably a 2-fold to 10 fold molar excess. Reaction times generally range from about 15 minutes to several hours, e.g., 8 or more hours, at room temperature. For sterically hindered sulfhydryl groups, required reaction times may be significantly longer. Thiol-selective conjugation is preferably conducted at pHs around 7. Temperatures for conjugation reactions are typically, although not necessarily, in the range of from about 0° C. to about 40° C.; conjugation is often carried out at room temperature or less. Conjugation reactions are often carried out in a buffer such as a phosphate or acetate buffer or similar system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWith respect to reagent concentration, an excess of the polymeric reagent is typically combined with the OGF peptide. The conjugation reaction is allowed to proceed until substantially no further conjugation occurs, which can generally be determined by monitoring the progress of the reaction over time.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProgress of the reaction can be monitored by withdrawing aliquots from the reaction mixture at various time points and analyzing the reaction mixture by SDS-PAGE or MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry or any other suitable analytical method. Once a plateau is reached with respect to the amount of conjugate formed or the amount of unconjugated polymer remaining, the reaction is assumed to be complete. Typically, the conjugation reaction takes anywhere from minutes to several hours (e.g., from 5 minutes to 24 hours or more). The resulting product mixture is preferably, but not necessarily purified, to separate out excess reagents, unconjugated reactants (e.g., OGF peptide) undesired multi-conjugated species, and free or unreacted polymer. The resulting conjugates can then be further characterized using analytical methods such as MALDI, capillary electrophoresis, gel electrophoresis, and/or chromatography.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn illustrative OGF peptide conjugate formed by reaction with one or more OGF peptide thiol groups may possess the following structure:\n\n\n \n \n \nPOLY-X\n0,1\n—C(O)Z—Y—S—S—OGF\n\n\n\n \n \nwhere POLY is a water-soluble polymer, X is an optional linker, Z is a heteroatom selected from the group consisting of O, NH, and S, and Y is selected from the group consisting of C\n2-10 \nalkyl, C\n2-10 \nsubstituted alkyl, aryl, and substituted aryl, and ˜S-OGF is a residue of an OGF peptide, where the S represents the residue of an OGF peptide thiol group. Such polymeric reagents suitable for reaction with an OGF peptide to result in this type of conjugate are described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2005/0014903, which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWith respect to polymeric reagents suitable for reacting with an OGF peptide thiol group, those described here and elsewhere can be obtained from commercial sources. In addition, methods for preparing polymeric reagents are described in the literature.\n\n\n \nAdditional Conjugates and Features Thereof\n\n\n \n \n \nAs is the case for any OGF peptide polymer conjugate of the invention, the attachment between the OGF peptide and water-soluble polymer can be direct, wherein no intervening atoms are located between the OGF peptide and the polymer, or indirect, wherein one or more atoms are located between the OGF peptide and polymer. With respect to the indirect attachment, a “spacer moiety or linker” serves as a link between the OGF peptide and the water-soluble polymer. The one or more atoms making up the spacer moiety can include one or more of carbon atoms, nitrogen atoms, sulfur atoms, oxygen atoms, and combinations thereof. The spacer moiety can comprise an amide, secondary amine, carbamate, thioether, and/or disulfide group. Nonlimiting examples of specific spacer moieties (including “X”, X\n1\n, X\n2\n, and X\n3\n) include those selected from the group consisting of —O—, —S—, —S—S—, —C(O)—, —C(O)O—, —OC(O)—, —CH\n2\n—C(O)O—, —CH\n2\n—OC(O)—, —C(O)O—CH\n2\n—, —OC(O)—CH\n2\n—, —C(O)—NH—, —NH—C(O)—NH—, —O—C(O)—NH—, —C(S)—, —CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —O—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—O—, —O—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—O—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—O—, —O—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—O—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—O—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—O—, —O—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—O—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—O—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—O—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—O—, —C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—, —C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—C(O)—NH—, —C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—C(O)—NH—, —C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—C(O)—NH—, —C(O)—O—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—C(O)—O—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—C(O)—O—CH\n2\n—, —C(O)—O—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —NH—C(O)—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—NH—C(O)—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—NH—C(O)—CH\n2\n—, —NH—C(O)—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—NH—C(O)—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—NH—C(O)—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—, —C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —O—C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—, —O—C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —NH—CH\n2\n—, —NH—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—NH—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—NH—CH\n2\n—, —C(O)—CH\n2\n—, —C(O)—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—C(O)—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—C(O)—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—C(O)—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—C(O)—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—NH—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—NH—C(O)—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—NH—C(O)—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—C(O)—NH—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—NH—C(O)—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —O—C(O)—NH—[CH\n2\n]\nh\n—(OCH2CH2)\nj\n—, bivalent cycloalkyl group, —O—, —S—, an amino acid, —N(R\n6\n)—, and combinations of two or more of any of the foregoing, wherein R\n6 \nis H or an organic radical selected from the group consisting of alkyl, substituted alkyl, alkenyl, substituted alkenyl, alkynyl, substituted alkynyl, aryl and substituted aryl, (h) is zero to six, and (j) is zero to 20. Other specific spacer moieties have the following structures: —C(O)—NH—(CH\n2\n)\n1-6\n—NH—C(O)—, —NH—C(O)—NH—(CH\n2\n)\n1-6\n—NH—C(O)—, and —O—C(O)—NH—(CH\n2\n)\nt\n-6—NH—C(O)—, wherein the subscript values following each methylene indicate the number of methylenes contained in the structure, e.g., (CH\n2\n)\n1-6 \nmeans that the structure can contain 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 methylenes. Additionally, any of the above spacer moieties may further include an ethylene oxide oligomer chain comprising 1 to 20 ethylene oxide monomer units [i.e., —(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)\n1-20\n]. That is, the ethylene oxide oligomer chain can occur before or after the spacer moiety, and optionally in between any two atoms of a spacer moiety comprised of two or more atoms. Also, the oligomer chain would not be considered part of the spacer moiety if the oligomer is adjacent to a polymer segment and merely represent an extension of the polymer segment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs indicated above, in some instances the water-soluble polymer-(OGF) conjugate will include a non-linear water-soluble polymer. Such a non-linear water-soluble polymer encompasses a branched water-soluble polymer (although other non linear water-soluble polymers are also contemplated). Thus, in one or more embodiments of the invention, the conjugate comprises an OGF peptide covalently attached, either directly or through a spacer moiety comprised of one or more atoms, to a branched water-soluble polymer, at in a non-limiting example, an internal or N-terminal amine. As used herein, an internal amine is an amine that is not part of the N-terminal amino acid (meaning not only the N-terminal amine, but any amine on the side chain of the N-terminal amino acid).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough such conjugates include a branched water-soluble polymer attached (either directly or through a spacer moiety) to an OGF peptide at an internal amino acid of the OGF peptide, additional branched water-soluble polymers can also be attached to the same OGF peptide at other locations as well. Thus, for example, a conjugate including a branched water-soluble polymer attached (either directly or through a spacer moiety) to an OGF peptide at an internal amino acid of the OGF peptide, can further include an additional branched water-soluble polymer covalently attached, either directly or through a spacer moiety comprised of one or more atoms, to the N-terminal amino acid residue, such as at the N-terminal amine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne preferred branched water-soluble polymer comprises the following structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein each (n) is independently an integer having a value of from 3 to 4000, or more preferably, from about 10 to 1800.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso forming part of the invention are multi-armed polymer conjugates comprising a polymer scaffold having 3 or more polymer arms each suitable for capable of covalent attachment of an OGF peptide.\n\n\n \n \nExemplary conjugates in accordance with this embodiment of the invention will generally comprise the following structure:\n\n\n \n \n \nRPOLY-X—\n(OGF)\n)\ny \n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein R is a core molecule as previously described, POLY is a water-soluble polymer, X is a cleavable, e.g., hydrolyzable linkage, and y ranges from about 3 to 15.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore particularly, such a conjugate may comprise the structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwhere m is selected from 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet a related embodiment, the OGF peptide conjugate may correspond to the structure:\n\n\n \n \n \nRPOLY-\nX\n-\nO\n-\n(OGF)\n)\ny \n\n\n\n\n \n \nwhere R is a core molecule as previously described, X is —NH—P—Z-C(O)P is a spacer, Z is —O—, —NH—, or —CH\n2\n—, —O—OGF is a hydroxyl residue of an OGF peptide, and y is 3 to 15. Preferably, X is a residue of an amino acid.\n\n\n \nPurification\n\n\n \n \n \nThe OGF peptide polymer conjugates described herein can be purified to obtain/isolate different conjugate species. Specifically, a product mixture can be purified to obtain an average of anywhere from one, two, or three or even more PEGs per OGF peptide. In one embodiment of the invention, preferred OGF peptide conjugates are mono-conjugates. The strategy for purification of the final conjugate reaction mixture will depend upon a number of factors, including, for example, the molecular weight of the polymeric reagent employed, the OGF peptide, and the desired characteristics of the product—e.g., monomer, dimer, particular positional isomers, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf desired, conjugates having different molecular weights can be isolated using gel filtration chromatography and/or ion exchange chromatography. Gel filtration chromatography may be used to fractionate different OGF peptide conjugates (e.g., 1-mer, 2-mer, 3-mer, and so forth, wherein “1-mer” indicates one polymer molecule per OGF peptide, “2-mer” indicates two polymers attached to OGF peptide, and so on) on the basis of their differing molecular weights (where the difference corresponds essentially to the average molecular weight of the water-soluble polymer). While this approach can be used to separate PEG and other OGF peptide polymer conjugates having different molecular weights, this approach is generally ineffective for separating positional isomers having different polymer attachment sites within the OGF peptide. For example, gel filtration chromatography can be used to separate from each other mixtures of PEG 1-mers, 2-mers, 3-mers, and so forth, although each of the recovered PEG-mer compositions may contain PEGs attached to different reactive amino groups (e.g., lysine residues) or other functional groups of the OGF peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGel filtration columns suitable for carrying out this type of separation include Superdex™ and Sephadex™ columns available from Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, N.J.). Selection of a particular column will depend upon the desired fractionation range desired. Elution is generally carried out using a suitable buffer, such as phosphate, acetate, or the like. The collected fractions may be analyzed by a number of different methods, for example, (i) optical density (OD) at 280 nm for protein content, (ii) bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein analysis, (iii) iodine testing for PEG content (Sims et al. (1980) \nAnal. Biochem, \n107:60-63), and (iv) sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS PAGE), followed by staining with barium iodide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeparation of positional isomers is typically carried out by reverse phase chromatography using a reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) C18 column (Amersham Biosciences or Vydac) or by ion exchange chromatography using an ion exchange column, e.g., a DEAE- or CM-Sepharose™ ion exchange column available from Amersham Biosciences. Either approach can be used to separate polymer-OGF peptide isomers having the same molecular weight (positional isomers).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe resulting purified compositions are preferably substantially free of the non-conjugated OGF peptide. In addition, the compositions preferably are substantially free of all other non-covalently attached water-soluble polymers.\n\n\n \nCompositions\n\n\nCompositions of Conjugate Isomers\n\n\n \n \n \nAlso provided herein are compositions comprising one or more of the OGF peptide polymer conjugates described herein. In certain instances, the composition will comprise a plurality of OGF peptide polymer conjugates. For instance, such a composition may comprise a mixture of OGF peptide polymer conjugates having one, two, three and/or even four water-soluble polymer molecules covalently attached to sites on the OGF peptide. That is to say, a composition of the invention may comprise a mixture of monomer, dimer, and possibly even trimer or 4-mer. Alternatively, the composition may possess only mono-conjugates, or only di-conjugates, etc. A mono-conjugate OGF peptide composition will typically comprise OGF peptide moieties having only a single polymer covalently attached thereto, e.g., preferably releasably attached. A mono-conjugate composition may comprise only a single positional isomer, or may comprise a mixture of different positional isomers having polymer covalently attached to different sites within the OGF peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment, an OGF peptide conjugate may possess multiple OGF peptides covalently attached to a single multi-armed polymer having 3 or more polymer arms. Typically, the OGF peptide moieties are each attached at the same OGF peptide amino acid site, e.g., the N-terminus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWith respect to the conjugates in the composition, the composition will typically satisfy one or more of the following characteristics: at least about 85% of the conjugates in the composition will have from one to four polymers attached to the OGF peptide; at least about 85% of the conjugates in the composition will have from one to three polymers attached to the OGF peptide; at least about 85% of the conjugates in the composition will have from one to two polymers attached to the OGF peptide; or at least about 85% of the conjugates in the composition will have one polymer attached to the OGF peptide (e.g., be monoPEGylated); at least about 95% of the conjugates in the composition will have from one to four polymers attached to the OGF peptide; at least about 95% of the conjugates in the composition will have from one to three polymers attached to the OGF peptide; at least about 95% of the conjugates in the composition will have from one to two polymers attached to the OGF peptide; at least about 95% of the conjugates in the composition will have one polymers attached to the OGF peptide; at least about 99% of the conjugates in the composition will have from one to four polymers attached to the OGF peptide; at least about 99% of the conjugates in the composition will have from one to three polymers attached to the OGF peptide; at least about 99% of the conjugates in the composition will have from one to two polymers attached to the OGF peptide; and at least about 99% of the conjugates in the composition will have one polymer attached to the OGF peptide (e.g., be monoPEGylated).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one or more embodiments, the conjugate-containing composition is free or substantially free of albumin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one or more embodiments of the invention, a pharmaceutical composition is provided comprising a conjugate comprising an OGF peptide covalently attached, e.g., releasably, to a water-soluble polymer, wherein the water-soluble polymer has a weight-average molecular weight of greater than about 2,000 Daltons; and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nControl of the desired number of polymers for covalent attachment to OGF peptide is achieved by selecting the proper polymeric reagent, the ratio of polymeric reagent to the OGF peptide, temperature, pH conditions, and other aspects of the conjugation reaction. In addition, reduction or elimination of the undesired conjugates (e.g., those conjugates having four or more attached polymers) can be achieved through purification mean as previously described.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, the water-soluble polymer-(OGF peptide) conjugates can be purified to obtain/isolate different conjugated species. Specifically, the product mixture can be purified to obtain an average of anywhere from one, two, three, or four PEGs per OGF peptide, typically one, two or three PEGs per OGF peptide. In one or more embodiments, the product comprises one PEG per OGF peptide, where PEG is releasably (via hydrolysis) attached to PEG polymer, e.g., a branched or straight chain PEG polymer.\n\n\n \nPharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\n \n \n \nOptionally, an OGF peptide conjugate composition of the invention will comprise, in addition to the OGF peptide conjugate, a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.

Preferred, in particular for formulations intended for inhalation, are non-reducing sugars, sugars that can form a substantially dry amorphous or glassy phase when combined with the composition of the present invention, and sugars possessing relatively high glass transition temperatures, or Tgs (e.g., Tgs greater than 40° C., or greater than 50° C., or greater than 60° C., or greater than 70° C., or having Tgs of 80° C. and above). Such excipients may be considered glass-forming excipients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional excipients include amino acids, peptides and particularly oligomers comprising 2-9 amino acids, or 2-5 mers, and polypeptides, all of which may be homo or hetero species.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary protein excipients include albumins such as human serum albumin (HSA), recombinant human albumin (rHA), gelatin, casein, hemoglobin, and the like. The compositions may also include a buffer or a pH-adjusting agent, typically but not necessarily a salt prepared from an organic acid or base. Representative buffers include organic acid salts of citric acid, ascorbic acid, gluconic acid, carbonic acid, tartaric acid, succinic acid, acetic acid, or phthalic acid. Other suitable buffers include Tris, tromethamine hydrochloride, borate, glycerol phosphate, and phosphate. Amino acids such as glycine are also suitable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions of the present invention may also include one or more additional polymeric excipients/additives, e.g., polyvinylpyrrolidones, derivatized celluloses such as hydroxymethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, FICOLLs (a polymeric sugar), hydroxyethylstarch (HES), dextrates (e.g., cyclodextrins, such as 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin and sulfobutylether-β-cyclodextrin), polyethylene glycols, and pectin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions may further include flavoring agents, taste-masking agents, inorganic salts (e.g., sodium chloride), antimicrobial agents (e.g., benzalkonium chloride), sweeteners, antioxidants, antistatic agents, surfactants (e.g., polysorbates such as “\nTWEEN\n 20” and “\nTWEEN\n 80,” and pluronics such as F68 and F88, available from BASF), sorbitan esters, lipids (e.g., phospholipids such as lecithin and other phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, although preferably not in liposomal form), fatty acids and fatty esters, steroids (e.g., cholesterol), and chelating agents (e.g., zinc and other such suitable cations). The use of certain di-substituted phosphatidylcholines for producing perforated microstructures (i.e., hollow, porous microspheres) may also be employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther pharmaceutical excipients and/or additives suitable for use in the compositions according to the present invention are listed in “Remington: The Science & Practice of Pharmacy,” 21\nst \ned., Williams & Williams, (2005), and in the “Physician's Desk Reference,” 60th ed., Medical Economics, Montvale, N.J. (2006).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of the OGF peptide conjugate (i.e., the conjugate formed between the active agent and the polymeric reagent) in the composition will vary depending on a number of factors, but will optimally be a therapeutically effective amount when the composition is stored in a unit dose container (e.g., a vial). In addition, a pharmaceutical preparation, if in solution form, can be housed in a syringe. A therapeutically effective amount can be determined experimentally by repeated administration of increasing amounts of the conjugate in order to determine which amount produces a clinically desired endpoint.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of any individual excipient in the composition will vary depending on the activity of the excipient and particular needs of the composition. Typically, the optimal amount of any individual excipient is determined through routine experimentation, i.e., by preparing compositions containing varying amounts of the excipient (ranging from low to high), examining the stability and other parameters, and then determining the range at which optimal performance is attained with no significant adverse effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, however, the excipient or excipients will be present in the composition in an amount of about 1% to about 99% by weight, from about 5% to about 98% by weight, from about 15 to about 95% by weight of the excipient, or with concentrations less than 30% by weight. In general, a high concentration of the OGF peptide is desired in the final pharmaceutical formulation.\n\n\n \nCombination of Actives\n\n\n \n \n \nA composition of the invention may also comprise a mixture of water-soluble polymer-(OGF peptide) conjugates and unconjugated OGF peptide, to thereby provide a mixture of fast-acting and long-acting OGF peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional pharmaceutical compositions in accordance with the invention include those comprising, in addition to an extended-action OGF peptide water-soluble polymer conjugate as described herein, a rapid acting OGF peptide polymer conjugate where the water-soluble polymer is releasably attached to a suitable location on the OGF peptide.\n\n\n \nAdministration\n\n\n \n \n \nThe OGF peptide conjugates of the invention can be administered by any of a number of routes including without limitation, oral, rectal, nasal, topical (including transdermal, aerosol, buccal and sublingual), vaginal, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous and intradermal), intrathecal, and pulmonary. Preferred forms of administration include parenteral and pulmonary. Suitable formulation types for parenteral administration include ready-for-injection solutions, dry powders for combination with a solvent prior to use, suspensions ready for injection, dry insoluble compositions for combination with a vehicle prior to use, and emulsions and liquid concentrates for dilution prior to administration, among others.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments of the invention, the compositions comprising the peptide-polymer conjugates may further be incorporated into a suitable delivery vehicle. Such delivery vehicles may provide controlled and/or continuous release of the conjugates and may also serve as a targeting moiety. Non-limiting examples of delivery vehicles include, adjuvants, synthetic adjuvants, microcapsules, microparticles, liposomes, and yeast cell wall particles. Yeast cells walls may be variously processed to selectively remove protein component, glucan, or mannan layers, and are referred to as whole glucan particles (WGP), yeast beta-glucan mannan particles (YGMP), yeast glucan particles (YGP), \\\nRhodotorula \nyeast cell particles (YCP). Yeast cells such as \nS. cerevisiae \nand \nRhodotorula \nsp. are preferred; however, any yeast cell may be used. These yeast cells exhibit different properties in terms of hydrodynamic volume and also differ in the target organ where they may release their contents.

For purposes of the present invention, a water-soluble polymer reagent is a water-soluble polymer-containing compound having at least one functional group that can react with a functional group on a peptide (e.g., the N-terminus, the C-terminus, a functional group associated with the side chain of an amino acid located within the peptide) to create a covalent bond. Taking into account the known reactivity of the functional group(s) associated with the water-soluble polymer reagent, it is possible for one of ordinary skill in the art to determine whether a given water-soluble polymer reagent will form a covalent bond with the functional group(s) of a peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRepresentative polymeric reagents and methods for conjugating such polymers to an active moiety are known in the art, and are, e.g., described in Harris, J.

The 10% reagent solution is quickly added to the aliquot of a stock OGF solution and mixed well. After the addition of the mPEG-SMB, the pH of the reaction mixture is determined and adjusted to 6.7 to 6.8 using conventional techniques.

The mono-PEGylated conjugate is indicated. The resin was overloaded upon sample loading and mono-[mPEG-Butyraldehyde-10 K]-[OGF] was found in the void fraction. The void fraction containing the conjugate was reloaded onto the CG71S column and the conjugate was eluted in a second reversed phase chromatography run (data not shown).\n\n\nFIG. OGF6.2.

The peak with retention time at 1.7 minutes was acetic acid derived from CG71S reversed phase chromatography.\n\n\n\n \nExample OGF7\n\n\nRadioligand Competition Binding Assay for OGF Series at Mu and Delta Opioid Receptors\n\n\n \n \n \nThe binding affinities of OGF (control) and PEG-OGF releasable conjugates were evaluated using radioligand binding assays in membranes prepared from CHO-K1 cells expressing recombinant human μ or δ opioid receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompetition binding experiments were conducted by incubating membrane protein to equilibrium in triplicate in the presence of a fixed concentration of radioligand and increasing concentrations (0.01 nM to 10 μM) of test compound in 100 μL final volume. The radioligands used were specific for each receptor type, and the assay conditions are described in Table OGF7.2. Following incubations, the membranes were rapidly filtered through GF/B filter plate (presoaked with 0.5% polyethyleneimine), washed four times with cold 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and the bound radioactivity was then measured. Non-specific binding was measured in the presence of excess naloxone (100 μM); this value was subtracted from the total binding to yield the specific binding at each test concentration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the releasable PEG-OGF conjugates, the receptor-binding activity of both released OGF and PEG-OGF (unreleased) conjugates was tested. The test compounds were stored under acidic condition to stabilize the PEG conjugation. To test the activity of PEG-OGF conjugates, the sample was diluted on the day of the assay. To test the activity of released OGF, two samples were prepared prior to the assay based on pre-determined release rates (refer to Table OGF7.3); one sample was diluted 10-fold in assay buffer (pre-incubated under physiological-like conditions for a period until ˜50% of OGF was estimated to be released) and the other sample was diluted 5-fold in 800 mM lysine solution, pH 10.0 (pre-incubated under forced release conditions for less than 24 hours until ˜95% of OGF was estimated to be released).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIC\n50 \n(concentration of test compound required to inhibit 50% of specific binding) values were obtained from non-linear regression analysis of dose-response curves, using GraphPad's Prism 5.01 software, and were calculated for those compounds that showed >50% inhibition of specific binding at the highest concentration tested. K\ni \n(affinity of test compound) was obtained using the Cheng Prusoff correction using experimental K\nd \n(affinity of radioligand) values that were previously determined under these assay conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe binding affinities of OGF and PEG-OGF conjugates are shown in Table OGF7.1. Opioid growth factor displayed similar, high affinity (1.3-2.0 nM) for human μ and δ opioid receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSince the releasable conjugates were pre-incubated, OGF was also pre-incubated for the maximum period to test the activity of the peptide itself under the pre-incubation treatment conditions. As shown in FIG. OGF7.1, OGF remained stable following pre-incubation under physiological-like (160 hours at 37° C., pH 7.5) and forced release conditions (16 hours at 37° C., pH 10.0). Pre-incubated OGF displayed similar, high affinity for μ and δ opioid receptors when compared to the control prepared on the day of the assay (Table OGF7.1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing pre-incubation of mono-mPEG2-CAC-40K-OGF for 160 hours and mono-mPEG2-C2-40K-OGF for 68 hours under physiological-like conditions, affinity for μ and δ opioid receptors was increased (compared to PEG-OGF conjugates prepared on the day of the assay) and regained (FIG. OGF7.2); OGF released from these conjugates retained receptor binding activity as shown by <9-fold loss in affinity relative to OGF. Similarly, both PEG-OGF conjugates treated under forced release conditions displayed release of active OGF and high affinity binding to μ and δ opioid receptors as shown by <4-fold loss in affinity relative to OGF.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe mono-mPEG2-CAC-40K-OGF conjugate displayed much lower affinity for both receptors; reduction in affinity was 135 to 150-folds less relative to OGF. The mono-mPEG2-C2-40K-OGF conjugate displayed a 2-fold reduction in affinity at the μ opioid and δ opioid receptor; this slight loss in affinity suggests that the mono-mPEG2-C2-40K linker may have been unstable and resulted in faster release of OGF under the assay conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the free PEGs (CAC-40K-fulvene and C2-40K-fulvene), affinity for μ and δ opioid receptors was not seen as expected. As shown in FIG. OGF7.3, binding affinity could not be determined for the free PEGs since >50% inhibition of specific binding was not achieved up to the highest test concentration (10 μM).\n\n\n \n \nFIG. OGF7.1.
