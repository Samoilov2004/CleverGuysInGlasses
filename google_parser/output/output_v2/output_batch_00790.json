Description\n\n\n\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\nThis application is a National Phase application under 35 U.S.C. §371 of International Application No. PCT/GB2007/001443 filed Apr. 20, 2007 and claims the benefit of Great Britain Application No. 0607798.6 filed Apr. 20, 2006, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.\n\n\nFIELD OF INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to novel polypeptides and their use in the treatment of conditions and diseases associated with activation of complement C5a receptors and/or formylated peptide receptors. In particular, the invention provides variant forms of the Chemotaxis Inhibitory Protein of \nStaphylococcus aureus \n(‘CHIPS’) and uses of the same in the treatment of acute and chronic inflammatory disorders.\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\n \nStaphylococcus aureus \nis a common human pathogen causing a variety of diseases. The mechanisms by which \nS. aureus \ncauses disease are multi-factorial. With the exception of some staphylococcal diseases caused by specific toxins like Toxic Shock Syndrome Toxin (TSST-1), responsible for Toxic Shock syndrome, or enterotoxin, the pathogenicity of \nS. aureus \ninfections does not depend on a single factor. \nS. aureus \npossesses a large variety of different ‘tools’ to cause disease. It is the whole complex of these different factors acting together in facilitating the colonisation, growth and spread within the host. Phagocytosis and killing of staphylococci by phagocytes is the most important host defence mechanism. Phagocytes are attracted to the site of infections by cytokines and chemokines released by the invader (like formylated peptides) and upon activation of inflammatory cascades like the complement system. The release of these chemoattractants creates a gradient by which the phagocytes are attracted to the site of inflammation.\n\n\nThe interaction of the supernate of growing \nS. aureus \nwith phagocytes was studied by Veldkamp et al. They found that although staphylococcal supernate was able to stimulate phagocytes there also was a factor present that could specifically downregulate the expression of the complement C5a receptor (C5aR) and formylated peptide receptor (FPR) as detected by monoclonal antibodies (see Veldkamp et al., 2000\n, Infect Immun \n68(10):5908-13; Veldkamp et al., 1997\n, Inflammation \n21(5):541-51). From the supernate of \nS. aureus \nthey isolated a 14.1 kDa protein responsible for this action; this protein was named CHIPS, CHemotaxis Inhibitory Protein of \nStaphylococcus aureus\n. CHIPS is able to inhibit neutrophil chemotaxis and activation with C5a and fMLP. Furthermore, CHIPS was found to be very selective, since it did not affect a broad selection of other receptors, including other chemoattractant receptors present on neutrophils, like the FPR-like 1, C3aR, IL-8RA and IL-8RB, LTB4 receptor, and PAF receptor. This indicates that CHIPS specifically inhibits two members of the G-protein coupled receptor family, the C5aR and the FPR. CHIPS is not toxic for the cells and also inhibits C5aR on other cells like monocytes and mast cells.\n\n\nPostma et al. showed that CHIPS binds directly to both the C5aR and FPR in an energy independent way. Furthermore, CHIPS is not internalised upon binding to its receptors. CHIPS binds both receptors with apparent Kd values of 1.1 and 35.4 nM for the C5aR and FPR, respectively (see Postma et al., 2004\n, J Immunol \n172(11):6994-7001). These Kd values are in the same range as those described for their natural ligands (see Van Epps et al., 1993\n, J Immunol \n150(1):246-252; Falk et al., 1982\n, Infect Immun \n36(2):450-454; Huey & Hugh, 1985\n, Immunol. \n135(3):2063-8; Pike et al., 1980\n, J Exp Med \n152(1):31-40). The active site in CHIPS for binding the formylated peptide receptor and C5a receptor are located within distinct regions of the CHIPS molecule. The N-terminal and C-terminal end and particularly the first and third amino acids are involved in the CHIPS activity towards the formylated peptide receptor (see Haas et al., 2004\n, J Immunol \n173(9):5704-11). At least the first thirty N-terminal amino acids do not play a role in CHIPS binding and blocking the C5aR. Therefore, a CHIPS protein without the first 30 amino acids, CHIPS\n31-121\n, shows a complete preservation of C5aR blocking activity but completely lost the activity towards the FPR (see Haas et al., 2005\n, J Mol Biol \n353(4):859-872).\n\n\nOver the last couple of years it has become clear that, next to host defence, chemokine receptors, like the FPR and C5aR, are also involved in a variety of other inflammatory processes. The recent identification of a variety of novel and host-derived agonists for the FPR has broadened the spectrum of functional significance of the FPR in disease processes (see Le et al., 2002\n, Trends Immunol \n23(11):541-8). A lot of research has been done on the evident role of the C5aR in a wide range of different disease processes including; sepsis, ischemia-reperfusion injury, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma and immune complex disease. Various experimental studies with animal models demonstrated the beneficial effects of targeting the C5aR in these disease processes (see Guo et al., 2004\n, Shock \n21(1):1-7; Huber-Lang et al., 2001\n, J Immunol \n166(2):1193-1199; Heller et al., 1999\n, J Immunol \n163(2):985-94). The unique properties of CHIPS to specifically inhibit the FPR and C5aR make this protein a promising candidate anti-inflammatory drug in those diseases in which FPR or C5aR stimulation play an important role.\n\n\nExperiments with isolated human and mouse neutrophils show that the activity of CHIPS for the mouse C5aR is at least 30 times lower than for the human receptor. The human specificity of CHIPS as shown by this 30-fold difference in activity toward human cells as compared to mouse cells hampers testing of CHIPS in a mouse infection model or other animal models.\n\n\n \nS. aureus \nis a normal commensal of the human skin and minor skin or wound infections caused by \nS. aureus \nare normally self-limiting. \nS. aureus \ncan potentially infect any tissue of the body and occasionally spreads from the primary site of infection to cause life-threatening diseases like osteomyelitis, endocarditis, pneumonia, and septicaemia. The CHIPS gene is present in the majority of clinical \nS. aureus \nstrains and strains from healthy carriers and CHIPS is produced in vivo as described by de Haas et al., using a mouse infection model (see Haas et al., 2004\n, J Exp Med \n199(5):687-95). Since \nS. aureus \nis a very common bacterium, it is likely that most individuals encounter \nS. aureus \nand the CHIPS protein early in life, leading to the production of anti CHIPS antibodies.\n\n\nThe present invention seeks to provide medicaments based on novel variant forms of the CHIPS protein, which exhibit improved properties.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF INVENTION\n\n\nA first aspect of the invention provides a polypeptide having a biological activity of the Chemotaxis Inhibitory Protein of \nStaphylococcus \nauras (‘CHIPS’), the polypeptide comprising a variant of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:1.\n\n\nThe amino acid sequence of the wildtype CHIPS protein is shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFTFEPFPTNEEIESNKKMLEKEKAYKESFKNSGLPTTLGKLDERLRNY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLKKGTKNSAQFEKMVILTENKGYYTVYLNTPLAEDRKNVELLGKMYKT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nYFFKKGESKSSYVINGPGKTNEYAY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe amino acid sequence of the wildtype CHIPS protein is also disclosed in Database Accessions Nos. AAQ14339, CAG41022 and YP\n—\n041409.\n\n\nBy “variant” we mean that the polypeptide does not share 100% amino acid sequence identity with the wildtype CHIPS protein, i.e. the amino acids of the wildtype CHIPS protein must be modified. For example, the polypeptide may comprise an amino acid sequence with at least 60% identity to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, more preferably at least 70% or 80% or 85% or 90% identity to said sequence, and most preferably at least 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identity to said amino acid sequence.\n\n\nPercent identity can be determined by methods well known in the art, for example using the LALIGN program (Huang and Miller, \nAdv. Appl. Math\n. (1991) 12:337-357) at the Expasy facility (www.ch.Embnet.org/software/LALIGN_form) using as parameters the global alignment option, scoring matrix BLOSUM62, opening gap penalty −14, extending gap penalty −4.\n\n\nAlternatively, the percent sequence identity between two polypeptides may be determined using suitable computer programs, for example the GAP program of the University of Wisconsin Genetic Computing Group and it will be appreciated that percent identity is calculated in relation to polypeptides whose sequence has been aligned optimally.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the variant comprises a modification at one or more amino acids exposed at the polypeptide surface. Surface exposed amino acids may be determined using techniques well known in the art (see Example E). However, it will be appreciated that modification of a non-exposed amino acid may also result in a structural change at the surface of the variant polypeptide (relative to the wildtype CHIPS protein).\n\n\nIn a further embodiment, one or more of the following amino acids within the wildtype CHIPS protein is modified:\n\n\nN31, S32, G33, L34, P35, K40, D42, R46, Y48, K50, G52, T53, K54, N55, S56, A57, Q58, K61, E67, K69, L76, N77, P79, D83, L90, K92, K100, K101, S104, K105, S107, Y108, N111 and G112.\n\n\nBy “modified” we mean that the amino acid at the specified position is altered compared to the natural amino acid in the wildtype CHIPS protein. For example, the amino acid at the specified position may be non-natural, deleted, or substituted or may be the site of an insertion/addition of one or more amino acids.\n\n\nThe amino acid molecules may also be modified in other ways, for example by chemical modification\n\n\nThus, the polypeptides of the present invention may be composed of amino acids joined to each other by peptide bonds or modified peptide bonds, e.g. peptide esters, and contain amino acids other than the 20 gene-encoded amino acids. For example, the polypeptides may contain L-amino acids and/or D-amino acids, as well as modified amino acids such as hydroxyproline, γ-carboxy glutamate, O-phosphoserine and O-phosphotyrosine. The polypeptides may be modified by natural processes, such as post-translational modification, or by chemical modification techniques well known in the art. Modifications can occur anywhere within the amino acid sequence of the variant CHIPS polypeptide, including the peptide backbone, the amino acid side chains and the amino- or carboxy-termini.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, however, the polypeptides of the present invention comprise or consist of natural L-amino acids.\n\n\nModified or variant forms of a known polypeptide can be produced using techniques well known in the art (see Sambrook & Russell, 2000\n, Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual\n, Third Edition, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., which is incorporated herein by reference). For example, point mutations may be introduced at specific amino acid residues by site-directed mutagenesis (see Sambrook & Russell, supra, Chapter 13). Additional methods for generating variants of a parent polynucleotide are described below.\n\n\nAs used herein, “biological activity” refers to an effect of the wildtype CHIPS protein upon a living organism, tissue or cell. Included herein, but not limited to, is binding to its natural ligand(s), as well as down-stream events therefrom, causing direct or indirect effects on a living organism. Thus, by “a biological activity” of the CHIPS protein we include inhibition of the chemotaxis and/or activation of neutrophils induced by the complement component C5a and/or the N-formyl-peptide, fMLP. For example, the maintained activity may comprise antagonism of the C5a receptor (C5aR) and/or antagonism of the formylated peptide receptor (FPR).\n\n\nIn one embodiment, however, the variant CHIPS polypeptide of the present invention lacks the FPR binding site.\n\n\nIn a further embodiment, the polypeptide of the invention exhibits one or more biological activities of the CHIPS protein in vivo.\n\n\nAssays for determining the biological activities and binding properties of the wildtype CHIPS protein and variants thereof are well known in the art (see Examples).\n\n\nOf course, it will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that the polypeptide of the first aspect of the invention may exhibit the biological activity at a level which is less than, the same as or greater than the level exhibited by the wildtype CHIPS protein. Preferably, the polypeptide of the invention exhibits the biological activity at a level of at least 10% of the level exhibited by the wildtype CHIPS protein, for example at least 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100% or more. More preferably, the polypeptide of the invention exhibits the biological activity at the same level or more compared to the biological activity exhibited by the wildtype CHIPS protein. Most preferably, the polypeptide of the invention exhibits the biological activity at a greater level (i.e. is more active) than the wildtype CHIPS protein. For example, the polypeptide of the invention may exhibit the biological activity at a level of at least 110% of the level exhibited by the wildtype CHIPS protein, for example at least 120%, 130%, 140%, 150%, 160%, 170%, 180%, 190%, 200%, 250%, 300%, 500% or more.\n\n\nIn a further embodiment, the polypeptide of the invention has a specific binding activity for the C5aR and/or FPR which is equal to or greater than the corresponding activity exhibited by the wildtype CHIPS protein.\n\n\nThus, the polypeptide of the invention exhibits only biological activities of the CHIPS protein, i.e. the activity of the polypeptide is selective. For example, the polypeptide of the invention may inhibit the chemotaxis and/or activation of neutrophils induced by the complement component C5a and/or the by the N-formyl-peptide, fMLP selectively. By ‘selective’ we mean that the polypeptide inhibits said biological activity to a greater extent than it modulates the activity of other proteins in the cells. Thus, the polypeptide preferably inhibits only the biological activity of the wildtype CHIPS protein, although it will be appreciated that the expression and activity of other proteins within cells may change as a downstream consequence of a selective inhibition. Thus, we exclude agents which have a non-specific effect on cellular processes.\n\n\nIn a still further embodiment of the first aspect of the invention, the polypeptide is a variant of the wildtype CHIPS protein wherein one or more surface epitopes is modified. Such modifications can either be direct (i.e. modification of an amino acid within the epitope itself) or indirect (i.e. modification of an amino acid which is not in an epitope but, when modified, leads in the modification of an amino acid within the epitope or the structure of such an epitope).\n\n\nBy “surface epitope” we mean a conformation of exposed amino acid residues at the surface of the wildtype CHIPS protein which is recognised by anti-CHIPS antibodies produced in response to a challenge with the CHIPS antigen and/or by antibodies produced in response to a challenge with \nS. aureus. \n \n\n\nFor example, the surface epitope may be selected from the following group of epitopes:\n\n\nLinear Surface Epitope:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEpitope\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nN68\n \nK69\n \nG70\n \nY71\n \nY72\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nExemplary\n \nA, H\n \nA, Q\n \n—\n \nA, S\n \n—\n \n \n \n \n \nmutations\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nConformational Surface Epitopes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpitope\n\n\nN55\n\n\nK100\n\n\nT53\n\n\nS107\n\n\nY108\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExemplary mutations\n\n\nK\n\n\nA, N\n\n\nG\n\n\n—\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpitope\n\n\nN111\n\n\nK95\n\n\nY94\n\n\nY97\n\n\nY71\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExemplary mutations\n\n\nK\n\n\nA, S\n\n\nH\n\n\nK, S\n\n\nA, S, K\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpitope\n\n\nN55\n\n\nK54\n\n\nT53\n\n\nY108\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExemplary mutations\n\n\nK\n\n\nE\n\n\nG\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpitope\n\n\nN55\n\n\nK100\n\n\nS107\n\n\nS108\n\n\nY48\n\n\nG52\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExemplary mutations\n\n\nK\n\n\nA, N\n\n\nD, N\n\n\n—\n\n\n—\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpitope\n\n\nN111\n\n\nK95\n\n\nY94\n\n\nY97\n\n\nY71\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExemplary mutations\n\n\nK\n\n\nA, S\n\n\nH\n\n\nK, S\n\n\nA, S, K\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpitope\n\n\nQ58\n\n\nK100\n\n\nS107\n\n\nY108\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExemplary mutations\n\n\nK\n\n\nA, N\n\n\nD N\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpitope\n\n\nK69\n\n\nL90\n\n\nP35\n\n\nK92\n\n\nE67\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExemplary mutations\n\n\nA, Q\n\n\nE, K\n\n\nA\n\n\nE\n\n\nK\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpitope\n\n\nG39\n\n\nK40\n\n\nL34\n\n\nP35\n\n\nK92\n\n\nE67\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExemplary mutations\n\n\n—\n\n\nE\n\n\nS\n\n\nA\n\n\nE\n\n\nK\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpitope\n\n\nP79\n\n\nL76\n\n\nR46\n\n\nA57\n\n\nS56\n\n\nQ58\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExemplary mutations\n\n\nE K\n\n\n—\n\n\n—\n\n\nD N\n\n\nG\n\n\nK\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpitope\n\n\nG35\n\n\nL34\n\n\nK92\n\n\nG33\n\n\nS32\n\n\nN31\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExemplary mutations\n\n\nA\n\n\nS\n\n\nE\n\n\nS\n\n\nK\n\n\nK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the above exemplary mutations are non-limiting.\n\n\nIt will be appreciated that the above list of epitopes is not necessarily exhaustive; other epitopes may exist on the surface of the wildtype CHIPS protein. For example, the following amino acid may form part of one or more additional surface epitopes:\n\n \n \n \n \nN31, S32, G33, K50, K61, S104, N111 and G112;\n \nN55, K100, S107, S108;\n \nK69, L34, P35, K92 and E67; and\n \nK69, L34, L90, P35, K92 and E67.\n \n \n \n\n\nIt will be further appreciated by skilled persons that the ‘parental’ CHIPS polypeptide, in which one or more of the above surface epitopes is mutated, may be the wildtype CHIPS sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, or a fragment or variant thereof (for example, \namino acids\n 1 to 112, \namino acids\n 1 to 114 or amino acids 31 to 113 of SEQ ID NO: 1).\n\n\nIn another embodiment of the first aspect of the invention, the polypeptide comprises an amino acid substitution relative to SEQ ID NO: 1 at one or more of the following amino acids:\n\n\nN31, S32, G33, L34, P35, K40, D42, R46, Y48, K50, G52, T53, K54, N55, S56, A57, Q58, K61, E67, K69, L76, N77, P79, D83, L90, K92, K100, K101, S104, K105, S107, Y108, N111 and G112.\n\n\nIt will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that the substitutions may be conservative or non-conservative. By “conservative substitutions” is intended combinations such as Gly, Ala; Val, Ile, Leu; Asp, Glu; Asn, Gln; Ser, Thr; Lys, Arg; and Phe, Tyr.\n\n\nFor example, the polypeptide may comprise one or more of the following amino acid mutations relative to the wildtype sequence:\n\n\nN31A, S32A, G33A, L34A, P35A, Y48A, Y48H, K50N, G52A, T53A, N55A, S56A, K61A, K69A, P79A, L90A, L90P, K92R, K100R, S104Y, S107A, Y108, N111I, N111K and G112V.\n\n\nIn a particular embodiment of the first aspect of the invention, the polypeptide is less immunogenic in humans than the wildtype CHIPS protein.\n\n\nBy “immunogenic” we mean that the ability of the polypeptide to induce an immune response (i.e. production of anti-polypeptide antibodies) in the host organism. Preferably, the polypeptide is less immunogenic than the wildtype CHIPS protein in humans.\n\n\nImmunogenicity may be determined by methods well known in the art. For example, rabbits or other animal species (such as mice, rats, guinea pigs, dogs, etc.) may be immunised with the polypeptide of the invention and the formation of immuno-complexes determined. Ideally, immune responses are studied in several different species, in order to exclude species-specific effects. One suitable method for assessing likely immunogenicity in humans involves purifying human anti-CHIPS IgG and determining the affinity of the variant polypeptide for such antibodies, e.g. using ELISA (see Examples below).\n\n\nIn a further embodiment, the polypeptide of the invention is capable of inhibiting C5a-induced activation of neutrophils and inhibiting fMLP-induced activation of neutrophils. Such inhibition may be partial or complete. Thus, the C5a-induced activation of neutrophils and/or fMLP-induced activation of neutrophils may be inhibited in response to the polypeptide of the invention by at least 10%, for example at least 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% and preferably by 100% compared to activation in the absence of the polypeptide.\n\n\nThe wildtype CHIPS protein contains 121 amino acids (following cleavage of a 28-amino acid signal peptide from the chb gene product). However, it will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that the polypeptides of the invention may be of any length. For example, the polypeptides may comprise or consist of more or less than 121 amino acids, or may comprise or consist of 121 amino acids exactly. Preferably, the polypeptide is fewer than 500 amino acids in length, for example fewer than 400, 300, 200, 150, 140, 130, 125, 121, 120, 119, 118, 117, 116, 115, 114, 113, 112, 111, 110, 109, 108, 107, 106, 105, 104, 103, 102, 101, 100, 95, 90, 85, 80, 75, 70, 65, 60, 55, 50, 40, 30 or fewer amino acids in length.\n\n\nFor example, the polypeptide may be between 110 and 130 amino acids in length, for example between 110 and 120 amino acids in length, e.g. 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118 or 119 amino acids. In one embodiment, the polypeptide is 112 amino acids in length.\n\n\nIn a further embodiment of the first aspect of the invention, the polypeptide comprises or consists of a fragment of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, or variant thereof.\n\n\nBy “fragment” we include at least 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 105, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119 or 120 contiguous amino acids of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:1. For example, the polypeptide may comprise or consist of a variant sequence of \namino acids\n 1 to 114, amino acids 31 to 112, amino acids 31 to 113 or amino acids 31 to 121 of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:1.\n\n\nIn an exemplary embodiment of the first aspect of the invention, the polypeptide comprises or consists of \namino acids\n 1 to 112 of SEQ ID NO:1 having the following modifications, or a combination of said modifications:\n\n\n(a) K40E, K69A, N111K and G112V;\n\n\n(b) G112V;\n\n\n(c) K54R, K69R, K100R and K105R;\n\n\n(d) K40N and K92R;\n\n\n(e) S104Y and N111I;\n\n\n(f) K69A and G112V;\n\n\n(g) K69T;\n\n\n(h) Y48H, D83G and L90P;\n\n\n(i) K50N;\n\n\n(j) K69A, K100R and K101R;\n\n\n(k) K69A;\n\n\n(l) N31A;\n\n\n(m) S32A;\n\n\n(n) G33A;\n\n\n(o) L34A;\n\n\n(p) P35A;\n\n\n(q) Y48A;\n\n\n(r) G52A;\n\n\n(s) T53A;\n\n\n(t) N55A;\n\n\n(u) S56A;\n\n\n(v) E67A;\n\n\n(w) P79A;\n\n\n(x) L90A;\n\n\n(y) S107A; and\n\n\n(z) Y108A\n\n\nIn a further embodiment, the polypeptide comprises or consists of one or more additional amino acids, inserted at either the N- or C-termini or internally within the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:1. For example, the polypeptide may comprises or consist of at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15 or 20 additional amino acids. Advantageously, the additional amino acids are located at the C-terminus of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:1.\n\n\nOne example of such an embodiment of the invention is a polypeptide comprising or consisting of \namino acids\n 1 to 112 of SEQ ID NO:1 having the following modifications:\n\n\nK40E, K69A, N111K and G112V\n\n\nIn a further embodiment, the polypeptide of the invention comprises one or more of the following amino acid mutations relative to the wildtype sequence (i.e. SEQ ID NO: 1):\n\n\nK40, D42, K50, K69, N77, D83, L90, K92, K100, K105, N111 and G112.\n\n\nFor example, the polypeptide may comprise or consist of one or more of the following amino acid mutations relative to the wildtype sequence:\n\n\nK40E, K40N, D42V, K50N, K69R, N77Y, D83G, L90P, K92R, K100R, K105R, N111K, N111I and G112V.\n\n\nThus, the polypeptide may be selected from the group consisting of polypeptides consisting of \namino acids\n 1 to 112 of SEQ ID NO:1 having the following modifications, and combinations thereof:\n\n\n(a) K50N, K69R, N77Y, K92R, N111K and G112V;\n\n\n(b) K40E, D42V, N77Y, K100R, K105R, N111K and G112V;\n\n\n(c) K50N, N77Y, K92R, N111K and G112V;\n\n\n(d) K40E, D42V, N77Y, N111K and G112V;\n\n\n(e) K40E, D42V, N77Y, K92R, N111K and 0112V;\n\n\n(f) K50N, N77Y, N111K and G112V;\n\n\n(g) K40E, D42V, K50N, N77Y, K92R, N111K and 0112V;\n\n\n(h) K40N, K50N, N77Y, K92R and N111I;\n\n\n(i) K40N, N77Y, D83G, L90P, N111K and G112V; and\n\n\n(j) K50N, N77Y, K92R, K100R and N111I.\n\n\nIn an alternative embodiment, the polypeptides defined in (a) to (j) above may comprise two additional amino acids at the C terminus, for example ‘R’ at amino acid position 113 and ‘S’ at amino acid position 114.\n\n\nPolypeptides of the invention may be made by methods well known to persons skilled in the art (for example, see Sambrook & Russell, 2000\n, Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual\n, Third Edition, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., which is incorporated herein by reference).\n\n\nIn brief, expression vectors may be constructed comprising a nucleic acid molecule which is capable, in an appropriate host, of expressing the polypeptide encoded by the nucleic acid molecule.\n\n\nA variety of methods have been developed to operably link nucleic acid molecules, especially DNA, to vectors, for example, via complementary cohesive termini. For instance, complementary homopolymer tracts can be added to the DNA segment to be inserted into the vector DNA. The vector and DNA segment are then joined by hydrogen bonding between the complementary homopolymeric tails to form recombinant DNA molecules.\n\n\nSynthetic linkers containing one or more restriction sites provide an alternative method of joining the DNA segment to vectors. The DNA segment, e.g. generated by endonuclease restriction digestion, is treated with bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerase or \nE. coli \nDNA polymerase I, enzymes that remove protruding, 3′-single-stranded termini with their 3′-5′-exonucleolytic activities, and fill in recessed 3′-ends with their polymerising activities.\n\n\nThe combination of these activities therefore generates blunt-ended DNA segments. The blunt-ended segments are then incubated with a larger molar excess of linker molecules in the presence of an enzyme that is able to catalyse the ligation of blunt-ended DNA molecules, such as bacteriophage T4 DNA ligase. Thus, the products of the reaction are DNA segments carrying polymeric linker sequences at their ends. These DNA segments are then cleaved with the appropriate restriction enzyme and ligated to an expression vector that has been cleaved with an enzyme that produces termini compatible with those of the DNA segment.\n\n\nSynthetic linkers containing a variety of restriction endonuclease site are commercially available from a number of sources including International Biotechnologies Inc., New Haven, Conn., USA.\n\n\nA desirable way to modify the DNA encoding the polypeptide of the invention is to use PCR. This method may be used for introducing the DNA into a suitable vector, for example by engineering in suitable restriction sites, or it may be used to modify the DNA in other useful ways as is known in the art.\n\n\nIn this method the DNA to be enzymatically amplified is flanked by two specific primers which themselves become incorporated into the amplified DNA. The said specific primers may contain restriction endonuclease recognition sites which can be used for cloning into expression vectors using methods known in the art.\n\n\nThe DNA (or in the case of retroviral vectors, RNA) is then expressed in a suitable host to produce a polypeptide comprising the compound of the invention. Thus, the DNA encoding the polypeptide may be used in accordance with known techniques, appropriately modified in view of the teachings contained herein, to construct an expression vector, which is then used to transform an appropriate host cell for the expression and production of the compound of the invention. Such techniques include those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,440,859 issued 3 Apr. 1984 to Rutter et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,530,901 issued 23 Jul. 1985 to Weissman, U.S. Pat. No. 4,582,800 issued 15 Apr. 1986 to Crowl, U.S. Pat. No. 4,677,063 issued 30 Jun. 1987 to Mark et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,678,751 issued 7 Jul. 1987 to Goeddel, U.S. Pat. No. 4,704,362 issued 3 Nov. 1987 to Itakura et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,710,463 issued 1 Dec. 1987 to Murray, U.S. Pat. No. 4,757,006 issued 12 Jul. 1988 to Toole, Jr. et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,766,075 issued 23 Aug. 1988 to Goeddel et al and U.S. Pat. No. 4,810,648 issued 7 Mar. 1989 to Stalker (which is incorporated herein by reference).\n\n\nThe DNA (or in the case or retroviral vectors, RNA) encoding the polypeptide constituting the compound of the invention may be joined to a wide variety of other DNA sequences for introduction into an appropriate host. The companion DNA will depend upon the nature of the host, the manner of the introduction of the DNA into the host, and whether episomal maintenance or integration is desired.\n\n\nGenerally, the DNA is inserted into an expression vector, such as a plasmid, in proper orientation and correct reading frame for expression. If necessary, the DNA may be linked to the appropriate transcriptional and translational regulatory control nucleotide sequences recognised by the desired host, although such controls are generally available in the expression vector. The vector is then introduced into the host through standard techniques. Generally, not all of the hosts will be transformed by the vector. Therefore, it will be necessary to select for transformed host cells. One selection technique involves incorporating into the expression vector a DNA sequence, with any necessary control elements, that codes for a selectable trait in the transformed cell, such as antibiotic resistance. Alternatively, the gene for such selectable trait can be on another vector, which is used to co-transform the desired host cell.\n\n\nHost cells that have been transformed by the expression vector of the invention are then cultured for a sufficient time and under appropriate conditions known to those skilled in the art in view of the teachings disclosed herein to permit the expression of the polypeptide, which can then be recovered.\n\n\nMany expression systems are known, including bacteria (for example, \nE. coli \nand \nBacillus subtilis\n), yeasts (for example \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae\n), filamentous fungi (for example \nAspergillus\n), plant cells, animal cells and insect cells.\n\n\nThe vectors typically include a prokaryotic replicon, such as the ColE1 ori, for propagation in a prokaryote, even if the vector is to be used for expression in other, non-prokaryotic, cell types. The vectors can also include an appropriate promoter such as a prokaryotic promoter capable of directing the expression (transcription and translation) of the genes in a bacterial host cell, such as \nE. coli\n, transformed therewith.\n\n\nA promoter is an expression control element formed by a DNA sequence that permits binding of RNA polymerase and transcription to occur. Promoter sequences compatible with exemplary bacterial hosts are typically provided in plasmid vectors containing convenient restriction sites for insertion of a DNA segment of the present invention.\n\n\nTypical prokaryotic vector plasmids are pUC18, pUC19, pBR322 and pBR329 available from Biorad Laboratories, (Richmond, Calif., USA) and pTrc99A and pKK223-3 available from Pharmacia, Piscataway, N.J., USA. Particularly preferred prokaryotic vector plasmids include pRSET and pHIP (Invitrogen, California, USA).\n\n\nA typical mammalian cell vector plasmid is pSVL available from Pharmacia, Piscataway, N.J., USA. This vector uses the SV40 late promoter to drive expression of cloned genes, the highest level of expression being found in T antigen-producing cells, such as COS-1 cells.\n\n\nAn example of an inducible mammalian expression vector is pMSG, also available from Pharmacia. This vector uses the glucocorticoid-inducible promoter of the mouse mammary tumour virus long terminal repeat to drive expression of the cloned gene.\n\n\nUseful yeast plasmid vectors are pRS403-406 and pRS413-416 and are generally available from Stratagene Cloning Systems, La Jolla, Calif. 92037, USA. Plasmids pRS403, pRS404, pRS405 and pRS406 are Yeast Integrating plasmids (YIps) and incorporate the yeast selectable markers HIS3, TRP1, LEU2 and URA3. Plasmids pRS413-416 are Yeast Centromere plasmids (Ycps).\n\n\nOther vectors and expression systems are well known in the art for use with a variety of host cells.\n\n\nThe host cell can be either prokaryotic or eukaryotic. Bacterial cells are preferred prokaryotic host cells and typically are a strain of \nE. coli \nsuch as, for example, the \nE. coli \nstrains DH5 available from Bethesda Research Laboratories Inc., Bethesda, Md., USA, and RR1 available from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) of 10801 University Boulevard, Manassas, Va. 20110-2209 USA (No. ATCC 31343). Preferred eukaryotic host cells include yeast, insect and mammalian cells, preferably vertebrate cells such as those from a mouse, rat, monkey or human fibroblastic and kidney cell lines. Yeast host cells include YPH499, YPH500 and YPH501 which are generally available from Stratagene Cloning Systems, La Jolla, Calif. 92037, USA. Preferred mammalian host cells include Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells available from the ATCC as CRL 1658, 293 cells which are human embryonic kidney cells, and NS0 cells. Preferred insect cells are Sf9 cells which can be transfected with baculovirus expression vectors.\n\n\nTransformation of appropriate cell hosts with a DNA construct of the present invention is accomplished by well known methods that typically depend on the type of vector used. With regard to transformation of prokaryotic host cells, see, for example, Cohen et al (1972) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n69, 2110 and Sambrook et al (1989) \nMolecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual\n, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. Transformation of yeast cells is described in Sherman et al (1986) \nMethods In Yeast Genetics, A Laboratory Manual\n, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. The method of Beggs (1978) \nNature \n275, 104-109 is also useful. With regard to vertebrate cells, reagents useful in transfecting such cells, for example calcium phosphate and DEAF-dextran or liposome formulations, are available from Stratagene Cloning Systems, or Life Technologies Inc., Gaithersburg, Md. 20877, USA.\n\n\nElectroporation is also useful for transforming and/or transfecting cells and is well known in the art for transforming yeast cells, bacterial cells, insect cells and vertebrate cells.\n\n\nFor example, many bacterial species may be transformed by the methods described in Luchansky et al (1988) \nMol. Microbiol. \n2, 637-646 incorporated herein by reference. The greatest number of transformants is consistently recovered following electroporation of the DNA-cell mixture suspended in 2.5 PEB using 6250V per cm at 25 μFD.\n\n\nMethods for transformation of yeast by electroporation are disclosed in Becker & Guarente (1990) \nMethods Enzymol. \n194, 182.\n\n\nSuccessfully transformed cells, i.e. cells that contain a DNA construct of the present invention, can be identified by well-known techniques. For example, cells resulting from the introduction of an expression construct of the present invention can be grown to produce the polypeptide of the invention. Cells can be harvested and lysed and their DNA content examined for the presence of the DNA using a method such as that described by Southern (1975) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n98, 503 or Berent et al (1985) \nBiotech. \n3, 208. Alternatively, the presence of the protein in the supernatant can be detected using antibodies as described below.\n\n\nIn addition to directly assaying for the presence of recombinant DNA, successful transformation can be confirmed by well known immunological methods when the recombinant DNA is capable of directing the expression of the protein. For example, cells successfully transformed with an expression vector produce proteins displaying appropriate antigenicity.\n\n\nSamples of cells suspected of being transformed are harvested and assayed for the protein using suitable antibodies.\n\n\nThe host cell may be a host cell within a non-human animal body. Thus, transgenic non-human animals which express a compound according to the first aspect of the invention (or a binding moiety thereof) by virtue of the presence of the transgene are included. Preferably, the transgenic non-human animal is a rodent such as a mouse. Transgenic non-human animals can be made using methods well known in the art.\n\n\nMethods of cultivating host cells and isolating recombinant proteins are well known in the art. It will be appreciated that, depending on the host cell, the compounds of the invention (or binding moieties thereof) produced may differ. For example, certain host cells, such as yeast or bacterial cells, either do not have, or have different, post-translational modification systems which may result in the production of forms of compounds of the invention (or binding moieties thereof) which may be post-translationally modified in a different way.\n\n\nIt is preferred that compounds of the invention (or binding moieties thereof) are produced in a eukaryotic system, such as a mammalian cell.\n\n\nAccording to a less preferred embodiment, the compounds of the invention (or binding moieties thereof) can be produced in vitro using a commercially available in vitro translation system, such as rabbit reticulocyte lysate or wheatgerm lysate (available from Promega). Preferably, the translation system is rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Conveniently, the translation system may be coupled to a transcription system, such as the TNT transcription-translation system (Promega). This system has the advantage of producing suitable mRNA transcript from an encoding DNA polynucleotide in the same reaction as the translation.\n\n\nThus, a second aspect of the invention provides a nucleic acid molecule encoding a polypeptide according to the first aspect of the invention. In one embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule is a DNA molecule. Advantageously, the nucleic acid molecule further comprises a signal peptide recognisable by the host cell in which the polypeptide of the invention is expressed.\n\n\nA third aspect of the invention provides a vector comprising a nucleic acid molecule according to the second aspect of the invention. In one embodiment, the vector is an expression vector (such as pRSET and pHIP).\n\n\nA fourth aspect of the invention provides a host cell comprising a nucleic acid molecule according to the second aspect of the invention or a vector according to the third aspect of the invention.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the host cell is an \nE. coli \ncell.\n\n\nA fifth aspect of the invention provides a method for producing a polypeptide according to the first aspect of the invention comprising culturing a population of host cells comprising a nucleic acid molecule according to the second aspect of the invention or a vector according to the third aspect of the invention under conditions in which the polypeptide is expressed, and isolating the polypeptide therefrom. By “isolating” the expressed polypeptide we include removing some or all impurities from the culture medium, such as cell debris. In one embodiment, the polypeptide is substantially pure.\n\n\nIt will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that the polypeptides of the invention are preferably provided in the form of a pharmaceutical composition comprising the compound and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Thus, a sixth aspect of the invention provides a pharmacological composition comprising a polypeptide according to the first aspect of the invention.\n\n\nBy “pharmaceutically acceptable” is included that the formulation is sterile and pyrogen free. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers are well known in the art of pharmacy. The carrier(s) must be “acceptable” in the sense of being compatible with the compound of the invention and not deleterious to the recipients thereof. Typically, the carriers will be water or saline which will be sterile and pyrogen free; however, other acceptable carriers may be used. Thus, “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” and “pharmaceutically acceptable excipient” includes any compound(s) used in forming a part of the formulation that is intended to act merely as a carrier, i.e., not intended to have biological activity itself. The pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient is generally safe, non-toxic, and neither biologically nor otherwise undesirable. A pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient as used herein includes both one and more than one such carrier or excipient.\n\n\nThe polypeptides of the invention can be formulated at various concentrations, depending on the efficacy/toxicity of the compound being used. Preferably, the formulation comprises the agent of the invention at a concentration of between 0.1 μM and 1 mM, more preferably between 1 μM and 100 μM, between 5 μM and 50 μM, between 10 μM and 50 μM, between 20 μM and 40 μM and most preferably about 30 μM. For in vitro applications, formulations may comprise a lower concentration of a compound of the invention, for example between 0.0025 μM and 1 μM.\n\n\nIt will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that the medicaments and agents (i.e. polypeptides) will generally be administered in admixture with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient diluent or carrier selected with regard to the intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice (for example, see \nRemington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, \n19\nth \nedition, 1995, Ed. Alfonso Gennaro, Mack Publishing Company, Pennsylvania, USA, which is incorporated herein by reference).\n\n\nFor example, the medicaments and agents can be administered orally, buccally or sublingually in the form of tablets, capsules, ovules, elixirs, solutions or suspensions, which may contain flavouring or colouring agents, for immediate-, delayed- or controlled-release applications. The medicaments and agents may also be administered via intracavernosal injection.\n\n\nSuch tablets may contain excipients such as microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, sodium citrate, calcium carbonate, dibasic calcium phosphate and glycine, disintegrants such as starch (preferably corn, potato or tapioca starch), sodium starch glycollate, croscarmellose sodium and certain complex silicates, and granulation binders such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), hydroxy-propylcellulose (HPC), sucrose, gelatin and acacia. Additionally, lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid, glyceryl behenate and talc may be included.\n\n\nSolid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in gelatin capsules. Preferred excipients in this regard include lactose, starch, cellulose, milk sugar or high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. For aqueous suspensions and/or elixirs, the compounds of the invention may be combined with various sweetening or flavouring agents, colouring matter or dyes, with emulsifying and/or suspending agents and with diluents such as water, ethanol, propylene glycol and glycerin, and combinations thereof.\n\n\nThe medicaments and agents of the invention can also be administered parenterally, for example, intravenously, intra-articularly, intra-arterially, intraperitoneally, intra-thecally, intraventricularly, intrasternally, intracranially, intra-muscularly or subcutaneously, or they may be administered by infusion techniques. They are best used in the form of a sterile aqueous solution which may contain other substances, for example, enough salts or glucose to make the solution isotonic with blood. The aqueous solutions should be suitably buffered (preferably to a pH of from 3 to 9), if necessary. The preparation of suitable parenteral formulations under sterile conditions is readily accomplished by standard pharmaceutical techniques well known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\nFormulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilised) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injections, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described.\n\n\nFor oral and parenteral administration to human patients, the daily dosage level of the medicaments and agents will usually be from 1 to 1000 mg per adult (i.e. from about 0.015 to 15 mg/kg), administered in single or divided doses.\n\n\nThe medicaments and agents can also be administered intranasally or by inhalation and are conveniently delivered in the form of a dry powder inhaler or an aerosol spray presentation from a pressurised container, pump, spray or nebuliser with the use of a suitable propellant, e.g. dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoro-methane, dichlorotetrafluoro-ethane, a hydrofluoroalkane such as 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFA 134A3 or 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane (HFA 227EA3), carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurised aerosol, the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. The pressurised container, pump, spray or nebuliser may contain a solution or suspension of the active compound, e.g. using a mixture of ethanol and the propellant as the solvent, which may additionally contain a lubricant, e.g. sorbitan trioleate. Capsules and cartridges (made, for example, from gelatin) for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated to contain a powder mix of a compound of the invention and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.\n\n\nAerosol or dry powder formulations are preferably arranged so that each metered dose or ‘puff’ contains at least 1 mg of a compound of the invention for delivery to the patient. It will be appreciated that the overall daily dose with an aerosol will vary from patient to patient, and may be administered in a single dose or, more usually, in divided doses throughout the day.\n\n\nAlternatively, the medicaments and agents can be administered in the form of a suppository or pessary, or they may be applied topically in the form of a lotion, solution, cream, ointment or dusting powder. The compounds of the invention may also be transdermally administered, for example, by the use of a skin patch. They may also be administered by the ocular route.\n\n\nFor application topically to the skin, the medicaments and agents can be formulated as a suitable ointment containing the active compound suspended or dissolved in, for example, a mixture with one or more of the following: mineral oil, liquid petrolatum, white petrolatum, propylene glycol, polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene compound, emulsifying wax and water. Alternatively, they can be formulated as a suitable lotion or cream, suspended or dissolved in, for example, a mixture of one or more of the following: mineral oil, sorbitan monostearate, a polyethylene glycol, liquid paraffin, \npolysorbate\n 60, cetyl esters wax, cetearyl alcohol, 2-octyldodecanol, benzyl alcohol and water.\n\n\nFormulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges comprising the active ingredient in a flavoured basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert basis such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier.\n\n\nWhere the medicament or agent is a polypeptide, it may be preferable to use a sustained-release drag delivery system, such as a microsphere. These are designed specifically to reduce the frequency of injections. An example of such a system is Nutropin Depot which encapsulates recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) in biodegradable microspheres that, once injected, release rhGH slowly over a sustained period.\n\n\nSustained-release immunoglobulin compositions also include liposomally entrapped immunoglobulin. Liposomes containing the immunoglobulin are prepared by methods known per se. See, for example Epstein et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n82: 3688-92 (1985); Hwang et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n77: 4030-4 (1980); U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,485,045; 4,544,545; 6,139,869; and 6,027,726. Ordinarily, the liposomes are of the small (about 200 to about 800 Angstroms), unilamellar type in which the lipid content is greater than about 30 mole percent (mol. %) cholesterol; the selected proportion being adjusted for the optimal immunoglobulin therapy.\n\n\nAlternatively, polypeptide medicaments and agents can be administered by a surgically implanted device that releases the drug directly to the required site.\n\n\nElectroporation therapy (EPT) systems can also be employed for the administration of proteins and polypeptides. A device which delivers a pulsed electric field to cells increases the permeability of the cell membranes to the drug, resulting in a significant enhancement of intracellular drug delivery.\n\n\nProteins and polypeptides can also be delivered by electroincorporation (EI). EI occurs when small particles of up to 30 microns in diameter on the surface of the skin experience electrical pulses identical or similar to those used in electroporation. In EI, these particles are driven through the stratum corneum and into deeper layers of the skin. The particles can be loaded or coated with drugs or genes or can simply act as “bullets” that generate pores in the skin through which the drugs can enter.\n\n\nAn alternative method of protein and polypeptide delivery is the thereto-sensitive ReGel injectable. Below body temperature, ReGel is an injectable liquid while at body temperature it immediately forms a gel reservoir that slowly erodes and dissolves into known, safe, biodegradable polymers. The active drug is delivered over time as the biopolymers dissolve.\n\n\nProtein and polypeptide pharmaceuticals can also be delivered orally. One such system employs a natural process for oral uptake of vitamin B12 in the body to co-deliver proteins and polypeptides. By riding the vitamin B12 uptake system, the protein or polypeptide can move through the intestinal wall. Complexes are produced between vitamin B12 analogues and the drug that retain both significant affinity for intrinsic factor (IF) in the vitamin B12 portion of the complex and significant bioactivity of the drug portion of the complex.\n\n\nThus, one aspect of the invention provides a polypeptide according to the first aspect of the invention for use in medicine.\n\n\nA further aspect of the invention provides the use of a polypeptide according to the first aspect of the invention in the preparation of a medicament for inhibiting a biological activity of complement 5a (C5a) and/or the N-formyl-peptide, fMLP.\n\n\nThe anaphylatoxin C5a mediates a wide array of inflammatory responses. Acting on the C5aR it plays an important role in the activation and recruitment of phagocytes and is crucial for an effective clearance of invading microorganisms. In recent years it has become clear that C5a also plays an important role in destructive inflammatory processes like tissue damage and severe inflammatory syndromes that lead to organ failure. Additionally, C5a has also been associated with several other biologic processes that affect normal organ development, early differentiation of various cell lineages, and protection of cells from apoptotic death (see Table 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nC5a-associated biologic processes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nActivation of MAPK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAngiogenesis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nApoptosis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nArachidonic acid metabolism\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAstrocyte activation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBasophil activation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBlood coagulation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBone remodeling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBone resorption\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCatecholamine biosynthesis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCell adhesion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCell cycle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCell differentiation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCell growth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCell invasion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCell migration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCyclooxygenase pathway\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nEicosanoid biosynthesis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nEndocytosis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nEndothelial cell activation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nEosinophil chemotaxis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExocytosis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFertilization\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFibrinolysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGlucose metabolism\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGlycolysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHexose transport\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHyperphosphorylation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLipid metabolism\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLipoxygenase pathway\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLymphocyte activation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLymphocyte chemotaxis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLymphocyte proliferation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMacrophage activation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMacrophage chemotaxis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMacrophage differentiation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMast cell activation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMicrotubule polymerization\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMonocyte activation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMyelination\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNeutrophil activation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNeutrophil chemotaxis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPhospholipase C activation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPhospholipid metabolism\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPlatelet activation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nProtein kinase C activation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRegulation of actin polymerization\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRespiratory burst\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSmooth muscle contraction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSpermatogenesis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSuperoxide release\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nT-cell proliferation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nVasoconstriction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nVasodilation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nViral entry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWound healing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe human formyl-peptide-receptor (FPR) and its variants FPRL-1 (FPR-like 1) and FPRL-2 (FPR-like 2) belong to the seven transmembrane domain Gi-protein-coupled receptors. Both receptors are present in high levels on neutrophils and monocytes. The FPR is defined as the high affinity formyl-peptide receptor and FPRL-1 as the low affinity receptor based on its activation only by high concentrations of fMLP. Since the only source of formyl peptides in nature is bacterial and mitochondrial protein synthesis, it is thought that these receptors act as mediators for the recruitment of phagocytes towards a site of bacterial invasion or tissue damage. This is supported by the observation that FPR knockout mice are more susceptible to infection with \nListeria monocytogenes\n. Also, dysfunctional FPR alleles are associated with localised juvenile periodontitis.\n\n\nOver the last years a large number of non-formylated peptide ligands for these receptors have been identified (see Table 2) These ligands originate from different sources including random peptide libraries, endogenous sources and pathogens. Some of them are associated with human diseases including Alzheimer's disease, amyloidosis and prion disease. Therefore, formyl-peptide receptors are a target in the treatment of different inflammatory processes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFPR and FPRL-1 agonists and antagonists\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOrigin\n\n\nReceptor\n\n\nEC\n50 \nor IC\n50\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgonists\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBacterial peptides\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfMLF and analogues\n\n\nBacteria and\n\n\nFPR\n\n\n0.1-1\n\n\nnM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nmitochondria\n\n\nFPRL-1\n\n\n1\n\n\nμM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nmFPR1\n\n\n1\n\n\nμM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nmFPR2\n\n\n10\n\n\nμM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHp(2-20)\n\n\n\n\nHelicobacter pylori\n\n\n\n\nFPRL1\n\n\n0.3\n\n\nμM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFPRL-2\n\n\n10\n\n\nμM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHIV-1 envelope  peptides\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT20 (DP178)\n\n\nHIV-1\nLAV\ngp41\n\n\nFPR\n\n\n0.5\n\n\nμM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(aa643-678)\n\n\nmFPR1\n\n\n1\n\n\nμM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nmFPR-2\n\n\n0.5\n\n\nμM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT21\n\n\nHIV-1\nLAV\ngp41\n\n\nFPR\n\n\n0.1\n\n\nμM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(aa558-595)\n\n\nFPRL-1\n\n\n50\n\n\nnM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN36\n\n\nHIV-1\nLAV\ngp41\n\n\nFPRL-1\n\n\n12.5\n\n\nμM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(aa546-581)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nF peptide\n\n\nHIV-1\nBru\ngp120\n\n\nFPRL1\n\n\n10\n\n\nμM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(aa414-434)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nV3 peptide\n\n\nHIV-1\nMN\ngp120\n\n\nFPRL-1\n\n\n2\n\n\nμM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(V3 loop)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeptide library  derived agonists\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nW-peptide\n\n\nRandom peptide\n\n\nFPR\n\n\n1\n\n\nnM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(WKYMVm)\n\n\nlibrary\n\n\nFPRL-1\n\n\n1\n\n\npM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFPRL-2\n\n\n5\n\n\nnM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nmFPR-1\n\n\n50\n\n\nnM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nmFPR-2\n\n\n1\n\n\nnM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMMK-1\n\n\nRandom peptide\n\n\nFPRL-1\n\n\n0.5\n\n\nnM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nlibrary\n\n\nmFPR2\n\n\n0.5\n\n\nnM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWKYMVM\n\n\nRandom peptide\n\n\nFPRL-1\n\n\n2\n\n\nnM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFPRL-2\n\n\n80\n\n\nnM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHost-derived  agonists\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMHC binding\n\n\nNADH dehydrogenase\n\n\nFPRL-1\n\n\n0.5\n\n\nnM\n\n\n\n\n\n\npeptide\n\n\nsubunit I\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLL-37\n\n\nhCAP18\n1-37\n \n\n\nFPRL-1\n\n\n1.0\n\n\nμM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAc1-26\n\n\nAnnexin(aa1-26)\n\n\nFPR\n\n\n5\n\n\nμM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAc9-25\n\n\nAnnexin(aa9-25)\n\n\nFPR\n\n\n10\n\n\nnM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD2D388-274\n\n\nuPAR(aa88-274)\n\n\nFPRL1\n\n\n5\n\n\npM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLXA4\n\n\nLipid metabolite\n\n\nFPRL1\n\n\n1.0\n\n\nnM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSAA\n\n\nAcute phase\n\n\nFPRL-1\n\n\n0.1\n\n\nμM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nprotein\n\n\nmFPR-2\n\n\n1\n\n\nμM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAβ\n2\n42\n\n\nAPP(aa1-42)\n\n\nFPRL-1\n\n\n1\n\n\nμM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nmFPR-2\n\n\n2\n\n\nμM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrP\n106-1262\n \n\n\nPrion(aa106-126)\n\n\nFPRL-1\n\n\n25\n\n\nμM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntagonists\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoc-FLFLF\n\n\nSynthetic\n\n\nFPR\n\n\n2\n\n\nμM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCylosporin H\n\n\nFungus\n\n\nFPR\n\n\n0.5\n\n\nμM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDCA\n\n\nBile acid\n\n\nFPR\n\n\n100\n\n\nμM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCDCA\n\n\nBile acid\n\n\nFPR\n\n\n175\n\n\nμM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFPRL-1\n\n\n300\n\n\nμM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpinorphin\n\n\nCerebrospinal fluid\n\n\nFPR\n\n\n50\n\n\nμM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThus, the polypeptide is for use in the preparation of a medicament which acts as an antagonist at the C5aR and/or FPR.

Further, it refers to any process, action, application, therapy, or the like, wherein a mammal, including a human being, is subject to medical aid with the object of improving the mammal's condition, directly or indirectly. Thus, treatment includes both therapeutic and prophylactic use.\n\n\nIn further embodiments, the medicament is for treating a disease or condition selected from the group consisting of acute reactive arthritis, acute transplant rejection, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), alcoholic hepatitis, allotransplantation, Alzheimer's disease, arteriosclerosis, arthus reaction, asthma, atherosclerosis, atopic dermatitis, bacterial meningitis, bronchogenic carcinoma, bullos pemphigoid, burns, cardiopulmonary bypass, cardiovascular diseases, chronic bronchitis, chronic lymph leukaemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), contact dermatitis, Crohn's disease, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, cystic fibrosis, dermatoses, diseases of the central nervous system, endometriosis, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), experimental allergic neuritis (EAN), frost bite, gastric carcinoma, gastrointestinal diseases, genitourinary diseases, gout, \nHeliobacter pylori \ngastritis, haemodialysis, hereditary angioedema, hypersensitive pneumonia, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, immune-complex (IC)-induced vasculitis, ischaemic shock, ischaemic reperfusion episodes, ischaemic reperfusion injury, joint diseases, (large) vessel surgery, metal fume fever, multiple sclerosis, multiple system organ failure, myasthenia gravis, myocardial infarction, pancreatitis, peritonitis, pleural emphesema, post-cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) inflammation, psoriasis, repetitive strain injury (RSI), respiratory diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, sepsis, septic shock, sinusitis, skin diseases, stroke, systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE), transplantation, (traumatic) brain injury, ulcerative colitis, urinary tract infection, vascular leak syndrome, vasculitis and xenotransplantation.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the medicament is for treating reperfusion injury.

A ‘therapeutically effective amount’, or ‘effective amount’, or ‘therapeutically effective’, as used herein, refers to that amount which provides inhibition of a biological activity of complement 5a (C5a) and/or the N-formyl-peptide, fMLP. This is a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect. Further, it is intended to mean an amount sufficient to reduce and most preferably prevent, a clinically significant deficit in the activity, function and response of the host. Alternatively, a therapeutically effective amount is sufficient to cause an improvement in a clinically significant condition in a host. As is appreciated by those skilled in the art, the amount of a compound may vary depending on its specific activity. Suitable dosage amounts may contain a predetermined quantity of active composition calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required diluent. In the methods and use for manufacture of compositions of the invention, a therapeutically effective amount of the active component is provided. A therapeutically effective amount can be determined by the ordinary skilled medical or veterinary worker based on patient characteristics, such as age, weight, sex, condition, complications, other diseases, etc., as is Well known in the art.\n\n\nThus, in one embodiment, the method comprises administering to the individual an amount of the compound sufficient to act as an antagonist at C5aR and/or FPR.\n\n\nIt will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that such an effective amount of the compound or formulation thereof may be delivered as a single bolus dose (i.e. acute administration) or, more preferably, as a series of doses over time (i.e. chronic administration).\n\n\nVariant CHIPS proteins according to the present invention may be produced by directed evolution technology, such as the Fragment-Induced Nucleotide Diversity ('FIND') methodology developed by Alligator Bioscience AB. The FIND methodology is described in detail in WO 98/58080, WO 02/48351 and WO 03/97834.\n\n\nThus, a further aspect of the invention provides a method for producing a polypeptide according to the first aspect of the invention, the method comprising the following steps:\n\n \n \n(a) providing one or more parent polynucleotide molecules encoding the wildtype CHIPS protein or variant(s) thereof;\n \n(b) digesting the one or more parent polynucleotide molecules with a nuclease (e.g. an exonuclease) to generate polynucleotide fragments;\n \n(c) contacting said polynucleotide fragments generated in step (b) with each other; and\n \n(d) amplifying the fragments that anneal to each other to generate at least one polynucleotide sequence encoding a variant CHIPS polypeptide having an altered amino acid sequence as compared to those encoded by the one or more parent polynucleotide molecules.\n \n\n\nIt will be appreciated by skilled persons that the parent polynucleotides provided in step (a) may be double-stranded or single-stranded. Preferably, however, parent polynucleotide molecules in step (a) are single-stranded.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, step (d) comprises adding oligonucleotides of predefined variability in order to control the degree of variability introduced into defined regions of the parent polynucleotides.\n\n\nIn a further embodiment, the method additionally comprises step (e) of expressing the at least one polynucleotide sequence produced in step (d) and screening the resultant polypeptide for a biological activity of the wildtype CHIPS protein, such as the ability to inhibit C5a-induced activation of neutrophils and/or fMLP-induced activation of neutrophils.\n\n\nStep (e) may also comprise testing the resultant polypeptide for the ability to bind to C5aR and/or FPR. Such binding properties may be assessed using techniques well known in the art, for example affinity chromatography and phage display.\n\n\nMore preferably, the method further comprises step (f) of screening the resultant polypeptide for reduced immunogenicity relative to the wildtype CHIPS protein.\n\n\nFor example, step (e) may comprise one or more of the following screening procedures:\n\n \n \n(i) Assay for ability of variant CHIPS polypeptides to bind to C5aR.\n    \n \nFor example, phage selection may be used to screen for binding of variant polypeptides to a peptide corresponding to the N-terminal part of the C5aR. After the first positive selection, eluted phages may be amplified and a subsequent positive selection performed. In the second positive selection, human anti-CHIPS antibodies may be added to absorb unwanted CHIPS molecules with retained binding to anti-CHIPS antibodies; this can increase the possibility of identifying clones which are less immunogenic.\n \nDirectly after the second positive selection, the eluted phages may be incubated with human anti-CHIPS antibodies coated to magnetic beads. Pools of eluates are then collected, as follows; (1) phages that did not bind the antibodies, (2) phages eluted after washing steps, (3) phages eluted with low or (4) high concentration of CHIPS. Clones from pools (1) and (2) may be preferentially selected for further screening.\n \nThe genes from the selected pool of mutants may be cloned into the pRSET vector and protein produced in HT format.\n \n\n\n \n(ii) Assay for the concentration of each variant CHIPS polypeptide by expression ELISA.\n \n(iii) Assay for the binding activity of the variant CHIPS polypeptides to anti-CHIPS antibodies, for example by inhibition ELISA and/or human anti-CHIPS antibody ELISA.\n \n(iv) Selected variant CHIPS polypeptides may also be re-expressed and analysed in expression ELISA and peptide ELISA.\n \n\n\nFurther details of exemplary screening procedures are provided in the Examples (see below).\n\n\nIt will be appreciated that screening assays which are capable of high throughput operation will be particularly preferred. Examples may include cell-based assays and protein-protein binding assays. An SPA-based (Scintillation Proximity Assay; Amersham International) system may be used.\n\n\nOther methods of detecting polypeptide/polypeptide interactions include ultrafiltration with ion spray mass spectroscopy/HPLC methods or other physical and analytical methods. Fluorescence Energy Resonance Transfer (FRET) methods, for example, well known to those skilled in the art, may be used, in which binding of two fluorescent labelled entities may be measured by measuring the interaction of the fluorescent labels when in close proximity to each other.\n\n\nAlternative methods of detecting binding of a polypeptide to macromolecules, for example DNA, RNA, proteins and phospholipids, include a surface plasmon resonance assay, for example as described in Plant et al (1995) \nAnalyt Biochem \n226(2), 342-348 (which is incorporated herein by reference). Methods may make use of a polypeptide that is labelled, for example with a radioactive or fluorescent label.\n\n\nA further method of identifying a polypeptide that is capable of binding to a target macromolecule (such as C5aR or FPR) is one where the target macromolecule is exposed to the polypeptide and any binding of the polypeptide to the said macromolecule is detected and/or measured. The binding constant for the binding of the polypeptide to the macromolecule may be determined. Suitable methods for detecting and/or measuring (quantifying) the binding of a polypeptide to a macromolecule are well known to those skilled in the art and may be performed, for example, using a method capable of high throughput operation, for example a chip-based method. New technology, called VLSIPS™, has enabled the production of extremely small chips that contain hundreds of thousands or more of different molecular probes. These biological chips or arrays have probes arranged in arrays; each probe assigned a specific location. Biological chips have been produced in which each location has a scale of, for example, ten microns. The chips can be used to determine whether target molecules interact with any of the probes on the chip. After exposing the array to target molecules under selected test conditions, scanning devices can examine each location in the array and determine whether a target molecule has interacted with the probe at that location.\n\n\nBiological chips or arrays are useful in a variety of screening techniques for obtaining information about either the probes or the target molecules. For example, a library of peptides can be used as probes to screen for drugs. The peptides can be exposed to a receptor, and those probes that bind to the receptor can be identified. See U.S. Pat. No. 5,874,219 issued 23 Feb. 1999 to Rava et al.\n\n\nIt will be understood that it will be desirable to identify polypeptides that may block C5aR and/or FPR in vivo. Thus it will be understood that reagents and conditions used in the method may be chosen such that the interactions between the said and the interacting polypeptide are substantially the same as between a said naturally occurring polypeptide and a naturally occurring interacting polypeptide in vivo.\n\n\n\n\nExemplary embodiments of the invention are described in the following non-limiting examples, with reference to the following figures:\n\n\nFIG. \n1\n—Frequency distribution of IgG anti-CHIPS titres in healthy human donors (n=168). The titre was defined as the log dilution that gives an absorbance of 0.300 after subtraction of background value. The mean titre was 3.62 with an SD of 0.72. The insert depicts the anti-CHIPS titres of the 6 subjects before study entry (mean of 3 values corrected for human pooled serum as reference in every ELISA).\n\n\nFIG. \n2\n—Pharmaco dynamic of CHIPS detected in the sera of the volunteers. CHIPS was measured by a specific capture ELISA at the various time points after iv injection of CHIPS.

Data show one representative experiment.\n\n\nFIG. \n4\n—CHIPS is recovered on the surface of peripheral blood neutrophils. At various time points after iv injection of CHIPS, the presence of CHIPS bound to the surface of neutrophils was detected with a rabbit-anti-CHIPS antibody. Individual subjects are shown; white bars represent placebo and black bars CHIPS receiver. Values are expressed as mean fluorescence (MFL) of gated neutrophils in EDTA whole blood samples at various time points (T=0, 15, 60, 240 min and after 24 hours). Background MFL value for the secondary FITC labelled conjugate was 6.\n\n\nFIG. \n5\n—Expression of FPR (a) and C5aR (b) on human peripheral blood neutrophils.

At various time points after iv injection of CHIPS, EDTA anticoagulated blood was incubated with buffer and fMLP for 30 min at 37° C. and analysed for the expression of both CD11b and CD62L. For every time point the expression of CD11b and CD62L was expressed relative to the buffer treated control sample (relative increase for CD11b and relative decrease for CD62L expression). These values were used to calculate the activation index for each subject at every time point (relative value for CD62L/relative value for CD11b). Data are expressed as the mean SSD of placebo (∘), serum and neutrophil CHIPS negative (−) subjects (•) and CHIPS positive (+) subjects (▪).\n\n\nFIG. \n7\n—Level of circulating peripheral white blood cells (a) and serum inflammation marker CRP (b). At various time points after iv injection of CHIPS, WBC counts and CRP measurements were performed. (1.1 and 1.6 indicate 1 day and 1 or 6 hours respectively). Data for WBC are expressed relative to the value at T=0 and data for CRP are expressed as mg L\n−1\n. Values are mean±SD for placebos (•) and CHIPS receivers (▴).\n\n\nFIG. \n8\n—Adverse effects of CHIPS as measured by levels of Circulating Immune Complexes (CIC; (a)) and mast cell marker tryptase (b). At various time points after iv injection of CHIPS, specific assays were performed for both markers.

For each subject the expression of CD11b and CD62L was normalised for every time point relative to the initial expression level at T=0. These values were used to calculate the activation index for each subject at every time point (relative value for CD11b/relative value for CD62L).\n\n\nFIG. \n10\n—Immunogenicity of CHIPS in healthy human subjects. Specific IgG titers towards CHIPS were determined in all subjects before trial start and 7 and 42 days after trial closing. Values are mean±SD for placebos (•) and CHIPS receivers (▪).\n\n\n \nFIG. 11-Relative\n CD11b expression on neutrophils induced by CHIPS-IgG complexes in vitro. Isolated neutrophils from healthy volunteers were challenged with increasing concentration of CHIPS with (▪) or without (•) 20 μg·mL\n−1 \naffinity purified human α-CHIPS IgG. To address the role of FcγR, cells were pretreated with blocking mAb anti-FcRII (IV-3) and F(ab′)\n2 \nanti-FcRIII (3G8), washed and used to stimulate with CHIPS in buffer (□) or anti-CHIPS IgG (∘). After challenge cells were incubated on ice with fluorescent-labelled anti-CD11b mAb to determine the level of cell activation. Data are expressed relative to the CD11b expression of cells in buffer only (without CHIPS or IgG) and shown as mean±SEM (n≧3).\n\n\n \nFIG. 12-Relative\n CD11b expression on whole blood neutrophils induced by CHIPS and alanine substitution mutants ex vivo.

CD11b expression was determined with a specific mAb on ice and data expressed as relative to buffer only cells as means±SEM (n≧3).\n\n\nFIG. \n13\n—Correlation between specific anti-CHIPS IgG titre and amount of CHIPS required for maximal stimulation of whole blood neutrophils ex vivo. EDTA blood from healthy volunteers was challenged with increasing concentrations CHIPS and CD11b expression measured as indication for cell activation. IgG anti-CHIPS titers were determined by ELISA and defined as the log serum dilution that gives an absorbance of 0.300. Regression analysis was performed using the formula: y=intercept+slope×ln(x)\n\n\nFIG. \n14\n—CHIPS\n31-113 \ninhibits C5a-induced cell activation. Fluo-3 labelled U937/C5aR cells were incubated with buffer or 1 μg·mL\n−1 \nCHIPS(CHIPS\nwt\n) or truncated CHIPS(CHIPS\n31-421 \nand CHIPS\n31-113\n). Cells were stimulated with different concentrations C5a and increase in fluorescence representing cell activation was measured in a flowcytometer.\n\n\nFIG. \n15\n—Affinity purified α-CHIPS antibodies were tested in their ability to bind CHIPS derived peptides. 50 μL CHIPS (1 μg·mL\n−1\n) or CHIPS derived peptide (10 μM) were coated to 96-well microtitre plates. Plates were blocked with 5% BSA and incubated with affinity purified α-CHIPS antibodies. Bound antibodies were detected with peroxidase conjugated goat-α-human-IgG and TMB as substrate.\n\n\nFIG. \n16\n—Different affinity purified α-CHIPS antibodies were tested for their ability to interact with CHIPS or truncated CHIPS variants in ELISA. 1 μg·mL\n−1 \nCHIPS or truncated CHIPS was coated on a 96-well microtitre plate. The wells were washed and incubated with different concentrations affinity purified antibody. Species-specific peroxidase conjugated goat IgG and TMB were used to detect bound antibodies. A CHIPS specific mouse monoclonal antibody (2G8) was used as a control.\n\n\nFIG. \n17\n—Anti-phage reactivity of human affinity purified-α-CHIPS\n31-113\n-IgG. A maxisorb 96-well plate was coated with M13 phages expressing CHIPS, wild type phages or buffer in order to test the reactivity of human affinity purified-α-CHIPS\n31-113\n-IgG. Data show that the antibody preparation reacts only with the expressed CHIPS protein and not with the wild type phage.\n\n\nFIG. \n18\n—Conformational epitopes mapped onto the surface of the CHIPS molecule.\n\n\nFIG. \n19\n—Characterisation of selected phages. Eight different phages were tested for their ability to bind affinity-purified α-CHIPS\n31-113 \nIgG. 100 μg·mL\n−1 \naffinity purified α-CHIPS\n31-113 \nIgG (a) or BSA (b) was coated onto a 96-well ELISA plate. Different dilutions of the amplified phage stocks were incubated with the coated plates. The bound phages were detected using an α-M13 mAb. Selected phages were able to bind to the affinity purified α-CHIPS\n31-113 \nIgG but not BSA.\n\n\nFIG. \n20\n—Binding of affinity purified antibodies and IVIgG to the CHIPS protein and synthetic peptides. 7-mer peptides comprising the mapped epitope sequences and containing an additional GGGC [SEQ ID NO:3] spacer and a synthetic peptide derived from the CHIPS N-terminus (pep1-38) were used for affinity purification of human IgG. The affinity purified α-peptide antibody preparations (10 μg·mL\n−1\n) were tested in their ability to bind the individual peptides and wild type CHIPS covalently bound to the surface of a CM5 sensor chip. The SPR responses were corrected for the amount and size of the immobilised ligand. The black bars represent binding of the different affinity purified antibodies. The white bars show binding of antibodies that were pre-incubated with 1 mg mL\n−1 \nCHIPS.\n\n\nFIG. \n21\n—CHIPS peptide ELISA: Standard curve\n\n\nFIG. \n22\n—Anti-CHIPS ELISA: CHIPS\nwt \nStandard curve\n\n\nFIG. \n23\n—Anti-CHIPS ELISA: CHIPS\nK69A \nabsorbance\n\n\nFIG. \n24\n—Anti-CHIPS ELISA: CHIPS\nK69A \nbinding\n\n\nFIG. \n25\n—Expression ELISA: CHIPS\nwt \nStandard curve\n\n\nFIG. \n26\n—Binding of exemplary CHIPS mutants to human anti-CHIPS antibodies, as measured by anti-CHIPS ELISA (See Example E for sequence details).\n\n\nFIG. \n27\n—Binding of exemplary CHIPS mutants to human anti-CHIPS antibodies in competition with the wt CHIPS protein, as measured by inhibition ELISA (See Example E for sequence details).\n\n\nFIG. \n28\n—Inhibition of C5aR in (a) U937 cells and (b) neutrophils by exemplary CHIPS mutants based on amino acids 31 to 113 of SEQ ID NO: 1.\n\n\n\n\nKey: CHIPS wt 1-121=The wildtype CHIPS polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:1\n\n \n \n \n \nCHIPS wt 31-113=The polypeptide consisting of amino acids 31 to 113 of SEQ ID NO:1\n \nN111K, G112V=A mutant version of ‘CHIPS wt 31-113’ in which amino acids 111 and 112 are mutated as indicated\n \nF.3.08 31-113=(See Example E for sequence details)\n \nF.3.39 31-113=(See Example E for sequence details)\n \nF.3.50 31-113=(See Example E for sequence details)\n \nCells=Negative control, without detection Ab (i.e. 100% ‘inhibition’)\n \nCells+ab1+2=Positive control, maximum signal with all C5aR detected (not inhibited by CHIPS)\n \nCells+ab2=Control showing no background signal with secondary Ab (i.e. 100% ‘inhibition’)\n \n \n \n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nExample A\n\n\nCHIPS Activity in Vivo\n\n\nMaterials & Methods\n\n\nPreclinical Assessment of Chips Toxicity in Animal Models\n\n\nDifferent pre-clinical toxicology studies were preformed to investigate the safety of CHIPS. These included; (i) The effects of CHIPS on various cardiovascular and respiratory parameters in one group of three anesthetized beagle dogs. The dogs were administered CHIPS in incremental doses 0.2, 2.0 and 20 mg kg\n−1\n, infused intravenously over 1 minute at approximately 30 minute intervals. (ii) Behavioral ('Irwin') test in mice: CHIPS was administered as a single intravenous injection to male ICR CD-1 mice (3 per group) at doses of 7.5, 25 and 75 mg kg\n−1 \nin order to assess effects on general behavior. An additional group received an equivalent volume (10 mL kg\n−1\n) of vehicle (0.9% w/v sterile saline). (iii) Acute intravenous toxicity study in rat: Intravenous administration of 96.1 mg kg\n−1 \nCHIPS as a single dose (the maximum practically achievable due to volume considerations) to 5 male and 5 female rats. (iv) Acute intravenous toxicity in mice: Intravenous administration of 96.1 mg kg\n−1 \nCHIPS as a single dose to 5 male and 5 female mice. (v) Seven-day intravenous bolus preliminary toxicity study in rats (24 males and 24 females, \nmax dose\n 10 mg kg\n−1\n). (vi) Seven day intravenous bolus toxicity study in rats (76 males and 76 females, \nmax dose\n 10 mg kg\n−1\n). (vii) Seven day intravenous bolus dose range finding study in dogs (2 males and 2 females, \nmax dose\n 20 mg kg\n−1\n). (viii) Seven day intravenous bolus toxicity study in the dogs (12 males and 12 females, \nmax dose\n 20 mg kg\n−1\n).\n\n\nIncluding Human Volunteers\n\n\nInclusion criteria for healthy volunteers were as follows: (i) Subjects should be men. (ii) Subjects should meet the following body mass index (BMI) range: 18-30 (kg m2) and age range: 18-50 years, both inclusive. (iii) Medical screening was divided in 2 parts. Subjects were pre-screened for anti-CHIPS antibody levels. Only subjects with a low titer were screened for the second part within 3 weeks before dosing and include: medical history, physical examination, measurement of blood pressure, heart rate, respiration and temperature, alcohol breath test, blood and urine tests, electrocardiogram (ECG) and drug screening.\n\n\nAdmission and Follow-Up\n\n\nSix selected subjects (4 receiving CHIPS and 2 controls) were admitted to the Clinical Pharmacology Unit (Kendle, Utrecht, The Netherlands) on the day before dosing. Baseline measurements, including blood samples for safety, urinalysis, interim medical history, physical examination, vital signs and ECG were done. On the day of dosing wildtype CHIPS (0.1 mg kg\n−1 \nadministered as a single dose of sterile frozen isotonic saline solution containing CHIPS at a concentration of 5 mg mL\n−1\n) or placebo (0.9% NaCl) was administered by iv infusions over 5 minutes. Subjects were connected to a telemetry system for cardiac monitoring from 30 minutes before dosing until 4 hours after start of dosing. The blood pressure of subjects was measured continuously using a Finapres from 5 minutes before dosing until 30 minutes after start dosing. Vital signs were measured and ECGs were made at certain time points during the admission period. For safety, clinical status and laboratory values (haematology, biochemistry, coagulation and urinalysis) of all subjects were monitored. Adverse events were documented and characterised according to their severity and relationship to CHIPS or placebo. The subjects were discharged at 24 hours after dosing. Two weeks after dosing subjects returned to the Unit for a visit to evaluate vital signs, ECG, blood and urine and anti-CHIPS antibody level. A follow up visit was scheduled 6 weeks after dosing.\n\n\nCloning and Expression of CHIPS\n\n\nCHIPS was cloned and expressed as described in Haas et al. (2004) \nJ. Immunol. \n173:5704-11. Briefly, the gene, without the signal sequence, was cloned into the pRSET vector directly downstream of the enterokinase cleavage site and before the EcoRI restriction site by overlap extension PCR. Bacteria were lysed with CELLYTIC B Bacterial Cell lysis/Extraction Reagent (Sigma) and lysozyme according to the manufacturer's description. The histidine-tagged protein was purified using a nickel column (HITRAP Chelating HP, 5 mL, Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions and cleaved afterwards with enterokinase (Invitrogen). Samples were checked for purity and presence of protein by means of 15% SDS-PAGE (Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, \nMINI PROTEAN\n 3 System, Bio-Rad) and Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Merck) staining.\n\n\nPurification of CHIPS for iv Use\n\n\nFull length CHIPS was expressed in an \nE. coli \nstrain containing the coding sequence of CHIPS directly downstream a PelB coding sequence in a growth media consisting of Soya peptone and yeast extract in 8 L fermentation media. CHIPS was isolated both from the growth media and the cells by a two-stage cation exchange purification process followed by a desalting step. Bacterial cell pellet was re-suspended in phosphate buffer (30 mM; pH 7.0), containing NaCl (10 mM), DTT (10 mM) and frozen. This was subsequently thawed at 37° C., incubated on ice and sonicated. After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm an amber coloured “cell” supernatant was recovered. The supernatant was diluted four-fold with 30 mM phosphate buffer and passed over a Source S-30 column. Material was eluted with a phosphate buffer salt gradient and fractions containing CHIPS were combined and purified further by using a polishing column with a shallow salt gradient. Fractions containing CHIPS with purity greater than 97% (by HPLC) were combined and passed through a \nSEPHADEX G\n 25 desalting column to remove phosphate and excess of sodium chloride. Endotoxin was removed by gently shaking over an AFFI-PREP resin (Biorad) and the preparation was sterilized through ultra filtration. The purity was checked by HPLC-MS on a Microbondapac CN-RP column with a gradient mobile phase consisting of water-TFA to Methanol-TFA. CHIPS generally eluted at about 13 minutes. The product was diluted with sterile saline to the required concentration and stored at −20° C.\n\n\nAnti CHIPS Antibodies\n\n\nRabbits were immunised with recombinant CHIPS using Freund's Complete Adjuvants and boosted with Freund's incomplete adjuvants. Bleedings were checked for reactivity with CHIPS by ELISA as described earlier (see Haas et al., 2004\n, J Immunol \n173(9):5704-11). From the final bleeding, IgG was purified by standard Protein-G (Pharmacia) affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer's instructions. Specific mouse monoclonals towards CHIPS were generated as described and IgG purified with Protein-G Sepharose columns (see Haas et al., 2004\n, J Immunol \n173(9):5704-11).\n\n\nIsolation of Affinity Purified Human-α-CHIPS IgG\n\n\nCHIPS\n1-121 \nwas coupled to a solid matrix using CNBR-activated Sepharose 4B according to the manufacturer's general instructions (Pharmacia, GE). Approximately 8 mg of purified CHIPS was coupled onto 1 gram Sepharose. A small column (±1 mL) was packed with the material, equilibrated with PBS and slowly perfused with human IgG for intravenous use (IgG-IV; Sanquin, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) diluted in PBS. The column was extensively washed with PBS and subsequently eluted with 0.1 M Glycine HCl buffer at \npH\n 3. Fractions of 0.5 mL were collected into tubes containing 50 μL 1 M Tris/HCl pH8, for neutralization. Fractions with the highest OD\n280 \nwere pooled and dialyzed against PBS. The final preparation was analyzed for IgG content with an ELISA. Therefore plates were coated with sheep anti-human IgG (ICN) at 2 μg·mL\n−1 \nin PBS, blocked with 5% BSA and incubated with serial dilutions of a standard IgG preparation (reference serum; Boehringer) and unknowns.\n\n\nCaptured IgG was detected with a peroxidase labeled goat anti-human IgG (Southern) and TMB as substrate. The IgG concentration was calculated from the reference curve.\n\n\nAnti CHIPS ELISA\n\n\nMicrotitre plates (Greiner) were coated with 50 μL CHIPS per well at 1 μg·mL\n−1 \nin PBS overnight at 4° C. All wash steps were performed thrice with PBS-0.05% Tween-20 and subsequent incubations were done for 1 hour at 37° C. Plates were blocked with PBS-0.05% Tween-20 4% BSA, washed and incubated with sera or antibodies diluted in PBS-0.05% Tween-20 1% BSA. Bound antibodies were detected with species-specific goat anti-IgG conjugated with peroxidase (all from Southern, Birmingham, USA) and TMB as substrate. The reaction was stopped with H\n2\nSO\n4 \nand the absorbance measured at 450 nm in a BioRad ELISA-reader.\n\n\nCapture ELISA\n\n\nMicrotitre plates were coated with 50 μL_-CHIPS mAb 2G8 at 3 μg·mL−1 in PBS overnight at 4° C. Plates were blocked with 4% BSA in PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20, washed and incubated with diluted samples and a two-fold dilution range of CHIPS as standard in PBS/Tween containing 1% BSA. Subsequently, plates were incubated with 0.33 μg·mL\n−1 \nrabbit α-CHIPS IgG and 1:5000 diluted peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Southern). Bound antibodies were quantified with TMB as substrate, the reaction stopped with 1 N H\n2\nSO\n4 \nand measured at 450 mm on a BioRad ELISA reader.\n\n\nIsolation of Human PMN\n\n\nBlood obtained from healthy volunteers was collected into tubes containing sodium heparin (Greiner Bio-One) as anticoagulant. Heparinised blood was diluted 1/1 (v/v) with PBS and layered onto a gradient of 10 mL Ficoll (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) and 12 mL HISTOPAQUE (density 1.119 g·mL\n−1\n; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.). After centrifugation (320×g, for 20 min at 22° C.), the neutrophils were collected from the Histopaque phase and washed with cold RPMI 1640 medium containing 25 mM HEPES buffer, L-glutamine (Invitrogen Life Technologies) and 0.05% HSA (Sanguin). The remaining erythrocytes were lysed for 30 s with ice-cold water, after which concentrated PBS (10×PBS) was added to restore isotonicity. After washing, cells were counted and resuspended in RPMI-1640/0.05% HSA at 107 neutrophils mL−1.\n\n\nNeutrophil Antigen Expression\n\n\nWhole blood was collected into K3-EDTA tubes and put on ice. Optimal dilutions of fluorescent-labeled mAb were alliquoted into Falcon tubes and mixed with 50 μL blood for 30 min on ice under gentle agitation. Red blood cells were lysed with FACS-Lysing solution (BD) followed by a buffer wash and cell pellets resuspended into 0.5% paraformaldehyde in PBS with 0.1% azide. Neutrophil surface antigen expression was analyzed in a FACsCalibur based on forward and sideward scatters for gating. Calibration beads (Calibrite; BD) and isotype matched controls were used to set appropriate background values and electronic compensation. The following mAb and probes were used: anti-CD11b (CR3) APC-labeled (clone 44; BD); anti-CD62L (L-selectin) PE-labeled (clone \nDreg\n 56 BD); anti-CD88 (C5aR) FITC-labeled (clone W17/1; Serotec); Fluorescein labeled formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys (‘FITC-fMLP’; Molecular Probes); Rabbit anti-CHIPS IgG (EWI) and FITC-labeled F(ab)'2 Goat anti-Rabbit IgG (Sigma).\n\n\nWhole Blood Ex Vivo Stimulation\n\n\nPart of the K3-EDTAblood was kept at room temperature and used for ex vivo neutrophil stimulation. Therefore blood was mixed with 10-fold concentrated stimuli (buffer control, 1×10\n−8 \nMfMLP) and incubated for 30 min at 37° C. with gentle shaking. Tubes were put on ice to stop the reaction and mixed with anti-CD11b plus anti-CD62L mAb. After 30 min on ice samples were treated as described above.\n\n\nCD11b Expression on CHIPS/IgG Stimulated Neutrophils\n\n\nDifferent concentrations CHIPS (final concentration 0-9 μg·mL\n−1\n) were incubated with affinity purified human-α-CHIPS-IgG (0-40 μg·mL\n−1\n) for 30 min at 37° C. Thereafter, 50 μL isolated human neutrophils (107 mL\n−1\n) were added to the CHIPS/α-CHIPS mixture and incubated with gentle shaking for 30 min at 37° C. Cells were put on ice for 10 min after which 3.5 μL flourescent mouse-α-human-CD11b (BDbiosciences, San Diego, Calif.) was added and incubated on ice for 30 min. Cells were washed with RPMI 1640/0.05% HSA and fixed with 200 μL 0.5% paraformaldehyde.\n\n\nCD11b expression on cells in whole blood was performed using blood collected from human volunteers, selected for different α-CHIPS titers. Since IgG is already present in the whole blood the samples (50 μL) were only incubated with CHIPS (0-9 μmL\n−1\n) for 30 min at 37° C. The sample was put on ice for 10 min after which 3.5 μL fluorescent labeled mouse-anti human-CD11b was added and incubated on ice for 30 min. The erythrocytes were lysed and cells were fixed by adding 1 mL FACS lysing solution diluted 1:10 with H\n2\nO for 4 min. Cells were spun for 10 min at 1200 rpm and pellet was washed with ice cold RPMI 1640/0.05% HSA. Finally cells were resuspended in 175 μL RPMI 1640/0.05% HSA. Receptor expression representing cell activation was measured in a FACSCalibur flowcytometer (BD Biosciences).\n\n\nCirculating Immune Complexes (GIC)\n\n\nCIC were determined by 2 different ELISAs from Quidel (San Diego, Calif.): the CIC-C1q enzyme immunoassay is based on the principle that complement fixing IC will bind to immobilised human C1q purified protein; the CIC-Raji Cell Replacement enzyme immunoassay measures IC containing C3 activation fragments by using a mAb that specifically binds the iC3b, C3dg and C3d activation fragments of C3 in a manner which is analogous to the classical Raji cell CR2 binding reaction. The data of both assays were combined and results expressed relative to the value at \ntime point\n 0.\n\n\nSerum Tryptase Concentration\n\n\nSerum derived tryptase (both α and β form) was measured on the UniCAP R-100 using the IMMUNOCAP technology from Pharmacia Diagnostics (Woerden, The Netherlands). The normal geometric mean for healthy controls is 5.6 μg L\n−1 \n(Pharmacia). Results were expressed relative to the value at \ntime point\n 0.\n\n\nThe study protocol and any amendments were approved by an independent ethics committee. The study was performed in compliance with the European Community (EC) rules of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the ‘Declaration of Helsinki’ (2000).\n\n\nResults\n\n\nCHIPS Shows No Evident Toxicity in Pre-Clinical Toxicology Studies\n\n\nIn none of the toxicology animal studies did administration of CHIPS cause any CHIPS related toxicologically significant changes in clinical observations, body weight, food consumption, haematology, coagulation, blood chemistry parameters, opthalmoscopy, electrocardiograms, macroscopic or microscopic pathology or behavior.\n\n\nThe effects of CHIPS on various cardiovascular and respiratory parameters in anesthetised beagle dogs was examined. In the dogs receiving low dose CHIPS (0.02 and 2 mg kg\n−1\n) there was no evidence of cardiovascular or respiratory effects when compared to infusion of vehicle (isotonic saline). Following intravenous administration of 20 mg kg\n−1 \nCHIPS a transient decrease in mean arterial blood pressure (˜40%) was recorded approximately 1 minute after start of administration. Mean arterial blood pressure levels returned to pre-dose levels within approximately 5 minutes following the start of dosing. The effect on blood pressure coincided with transient, inconsistent changes in heart rate. One dog was administered a repeat intravenous dose of CHIPS (20 mg kg\n−1\n) approximately 30 minutes following the first administration of CHIPS. Transient effects on cardiorespiratory parameters similar to those recorded following the first dose were not apparent after the repeat administration of CHIPS. However, the second administration produced a prolonged reduction in mean arterial blood pressure reaching a maximum of 18% at approximately 30 minutes following the second administration. In this animal only, twelve minutes following the repeated administration of CHIPS a generalized skin reaction appeared consistent with some form of mild allergic reaction.\n\n\nThe results of this study suggested that cardiorespiratory effects are unlikely to be observed in the human subjects in the used dose range (0.1 mg kg\n−1\n). Furthermore, any effects that might occur were expected to be transient and reversible.\n\n\nDistribution of α-CHIPS Antibody Titers\n\n\nSince \nS. aureus \nis a common bacterium and the CHIPS gene is present in the majority of \nS. aureus \nstrains we hypothesised that all individuals possess circulating α-CHIPS antibodies. Therefore we tested the amount of α-CHIPS IgG in serum of healthy volunteers. \nFIG. 1\n shows the distribution of α-CHIPS IgG titers in a set of 168 healthy human volunteers. In the set of measured samples there were no titers below the detection limit of the used ELISA. The studied population is considered representative for the general population. Concluding from this data, over 99% of people in the general population have detectable α-CHIPS IgG serum levels. Also indicated in \nFIG. 1\n are the titers of the subjects included in the trial.\n\n\nPharmokinetics of iv Administered CHIPS\n\n\nAt four different time points after CHIPS administration the CHIPS serum titers were determined by ELISA (\nFIG. 2\n). Increase in CHIPS titer was observed only in individuals receiving CHIPS that had a low α-CHIPS antibody titer, (\nsubjects\n 104 and 105). We determined the effect of human serum on the CHIPS ELISA. CHIPS was spiked into various concentrations pooled human serum and detected by capture ELISA. \nFIG. 3\n \na \nshows that serum inhibits the capture ELISA. Depletion of IgG using a protein G-sepharose column eliminates the inhibitory effect (\nFIG. 3\n \nb\n).\n\n\nCHIPS Binds the FPR and C5aR In Vivo\n\n\nCHIPS binds the FPR and C5aR on neutrophils with high affinity and can be detected with α-CHIPS antibodies as described earlier for mouse mAb.158 At various timepoints after CHIPS administration the amount of CHIPS present on the surface of neutrophils was determined using a rabbit-α-CHIPS antibody as shown in \nFIG. 4\n. Only in subjects with a low α-CHIPS antibody titer (subjects #104 and #105) CHIPS was detected on the surface of neutrophils. Moreover, within these two subjects the detection of CHIPS negatively correlates to the α-CHIPS antibody titer. Since α-CHIPS antibodies present in serum interfere with the direct detection of CHIPS a negative result of this direct detection can not exclude CHIPS binding the receptor. However, CHIPS bound to the FPR and C5aR interferes with the detection of these receptors by α-FPR and α-C5aR antibodies as described earlier (see Veldkamp et al., 2000\n, Infect Immun \n68(10):5908-13). \nFIG. 5\n shows the FPR and C5aR receptor expression determined by FITC-fMLP and α-C5aR antibody binding. Subjects with a low _-CHIPS antibody titer show a decrease in FPR and C5aR expression indicating that CHIPS has occupied the receptors. In the subjects with a high α-CHIPS antibody titer (103 and 106) there is no change in FPR and C5aR expression indicating that α-CHIPS antibodies interfere with CHIPS binding to the receptor.\n\n\nCHIPS Inhibits fMLP Induced Neutrophil Activation Ex Vivo Dependent of α-CHIPS Antibody Titer\n\n\nUpon cell activation there is a decrease in CD62L expression and an increase in CD11b expression. In order to test the effects of intravenous CHIPS on neutrophil inhibition we measured ex vivo fMLP-induced expression of CD62L and CD11b. Neutrophils were activated ex vivo with fMLP in a whole blood assay. As shown in \nFIG. 6\n, intravenous administered CHIPS is able to inhibit fMLP induced activation of neutrophils ex vivo. This inhibition is only observed in subjects with a detectable CHIPS serum concentration (subject 104 and 105).\n\n\nCHIPS Induced Adverse Effects\n\n\nSerious side effects were observed directly after administration of CHIPS. Most serious adverse events were observed for \nsubject\n 106, these included: muscle pain, dyspnea, abdominal pain, vomiting, muscle spasms, chills, sweating, edema orbita and dizziness. The conclusive diagnosis of these symptoms is anaphylactoid reaction. The subject was treated with clemastine, IV fluids, tramadol and prednisolone.\n\n\nOther adverse events reported include: palpitations, feeling warm, chest pain, flushing, feeling cold, tired legs, postural dizziness, fever, headache, nausea, blurred vision. Apart from the severe back pain for \nsubject\n 106, \n \nsubjects\n \n 103 and 105 reported mild back pain. Subject 104 reported muscle cramps. Fever up to 38.6° C. was observed for \n \nsubjects\n \n 104 and 105 starting approximately 4 hours post dosing with resolution in the evening of \nday\n 1.\n\n\nThere were no changes in blood pressure and no ECG abnormalities. No abnormalities in oxygen saturation were observed except for intermittent low readings for subject 106 (89% oxygen saturation) during the adverse events described above. No adverse events were reported in subjects receiving placebo.\n\n\nIntravenous CHIPS Induces a Leukocytopenia and Increased CRP Levels\n\n\nWe measured the white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein concentration (CRP) pre- and post-dosing as shown in \nFIG. 7\n. CHIPS induced a transient leuko-cytopenia in the subjects receiving CHIPS that resolved within 2 days. Furthermore there is an increase in CRP concentration starting at \nday\n 1 post dose that had returned to normal levels when subjects were screened during follow up at day 15 (\nFIG. 7\n \nb\n).\n\n\nCirculating Immune Complexes and Increase Serum Tryptase Indicate an Anaphylactoid Reaction\n\n\nWe measured the amount of circulating immune complexes and the serum tryptase concentration. Intravenous administration of CHIPS induces the formation of immune complexes in subjects receiving CHIPS (\nFIG. 8\n \na\n). We also observed an increase in tryptase serum concentration that reached a maximum at approximately 10 minutes post dose (\nFIG. 8\n \nb\n).\n\n\nCHIPS Induces Cell Activation in Vivo\n\n\nTo study the direct effect of CHIPS on cell activation we determined the CD62L and CD11b receptor expression on neutrophils. Receptor expression was measured immediately after collection of blood samples without any further cell stimulation. \n \n \nSubjects\n \n \n 104, 105 and 106 show a decrease in CD62L and a increase in CD11b expression on neutrophils representing in vivo cell activation (\nFIG. 9\n).\n\n\nα-CHIPS Antibody Titers Increase after CHIPS Administration\n\n\nThe immunogenicity of a protein is characterized by the potency to induce antibodies. We determined the immunogenicity of CHIPS in healthy human subjects. The subjects that received intravenous CHIPS show an increase in α-CHIPS IgG (\nFIG. 10\n).\n\n\nCHIPS Activation of Neutrophils In Vitro is Dependent on Antibody Concentration\n\n\nWe studied the activation of neutrophils by CHIPS-IgG complexes in vitro. Different concentrations CHIPS were preincubated with 20 μg mL\n−1 \nhuman affinity purified-α-CHIPS IgG and used to stimulate isolated neutrophils as shown in \nFIG. 11\n. Affinity purified-α-CHIPS IgG was not able to activate neutrophils in the absence of CHIPS (data not shown). CHIPS-IgG complexes were able to stimulate neutrophils in a dose dependant way. \nFIG. 5.11\n also shows that there is a optimal CHIPS concentration needed for maximal cell activation. The CHIPS-IgG induced cell activation was completely inhibited by FcR blocking antibodies. Therefore we conclude that the CHIPS-IgG induced cell activation in this assay is Fc-receptor mediated.\n\n\nCHIPS\nR46A \n(arginine at position 46 replaced with alanine) and CHIPS\nK69A \n(lysine at position 96 replaced with alanine) are two CHIPS mutants with a single amino acid substitution, described earlier (see Haas et al., 2005\n, J Mol Biol \n353(4):859-872). These CHIPS mutants show a decreased affinity for purified-α-CHIPS IgG as measured by ELISA (data not shown). When used in the whole blood cell activation assay these mutants have a lower cell activating potential compared to wild type CHIPS (\nFIG. 12\n). For CHIPS\nR46A \nand CHIPS\nK69A \na ten fold higher concentration is needed to give the same cell activation compared to wild type CHIPS. This shows that next to the antibody titer the level of reactivity with the antigen determine the amount of cell activation.\n\n\nEx Vivo Activation of Neutrophils by CHIPS is Also Dependent on α-Chips IgG Concentration\n\n\nWe measured the effect of CHIPS on neutrophil activation in a whole blood ex vivo assay. Since α-CHIPS antibodies are already present in whole blood we did not preincubate CHIPS with affinity purified-α-CHIPS IgG. Different concentrations CHIPS were added to blood from human volunteers and CD11b expression, representing cell activation was measured. \nFIG. 13\n shows the CHIPS concentration needed for maximal neutrophil stimulation measured by CD11b expression in whole blood from 8 healthy volunteers with different α-CHIPS IgG titers. As shown in the in vitro experiments maximum neutrophil stimulation depends on the CHIPS/α-CHIPS ratio. This is also observed in this ex vivo assay. A higher concentration CHIPS is needed for maximum stimulation of neutrophils when a higher α-CHIPS concentration is present.\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\nThe Chemotaxis Inhibitory Protein of \nS. aureus \nis a very potent inhibitor of the human C5a-receptor and formyl-peptide-receptor. Both receptors, but especially the C5aR, have been described as important targets in the treatment of a variety of inflammatory diseases. The potent capacity of CHIPS to inhibit the C5aR and FPR make this protein a candidate therapeutic agent in the treatment of these diseases. Furthermore the fact that the activity towards the C5aR and the FPR are located on distinct regions of the CHIPS molecule allows for specific receptor targeting (see Haas et al., 2004\n, J Immunol \n173(9):5704-11). The human specificity of the CHIPS protein, as evident from a 30 fold difference in activity toward human cells compared to mouse cells, hampers the evaluation of in vivo CHIPS activity in an animal model (see de Haas et al., 2004\n, J Exp Med \n199(5):687-95).\n\n\nWe studied the activity, pharmokinetics and toxicity of the Chemotaxis Inhibitory Protein of \nS. aureus \nin a set of six healthy human subjects. Pre-clinical toxicology studies with administration of high concentrations CHIPS (single intravenous doses up to 96.1 mg kg\n−1 \nin mouse) in different animal models show no remarkable signs of toxicity. Therefore a starting dose of 0.1 mg kg\n−1 \nadministered intravenously over 5 minutes was considered safe.\n\n\nSince \nS. aureus \nis a common bacterium and the CHIPS protein is expressed in the majority of \nS. aureus \nstrains we hypothesized that α-CHIPS antibodies are present in all individuals. This was confirmed by screening of α-CHIPS IgG titres in a pool of 168 randomly collected sera from human volunteers. Experiments with mouse monoclonal antibodies showed that these monoclonal antibodies can interfere with CHIPS activity in vitro (see Haas et al., 2004\n, J Immunol \n173(9):5704-11). Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that α-CHIPS antibodies present in the healthy subjects receiving the CHIPS protein also interfere with activity.\n\n\nThe administration of CHIPS to human subjects was an unique opportunity to study activity and pharmokinetics in vivo. After intravenous administration of 0.1 mg kg\n−1 \nCHIPS we measured the CHIPS serum concentration. \nFIG. 2\n shows the CHIPS serum concentration on different time points post dosing. In only two out of four subjects that received the CHIPS protein we measured an increase in CHIPS serum concentration (subject 104 and 105). Interesting was the observation that these two individuals also showed the lowest α-CHIPS IgG titers. This shows that α-CHIPS antibodies interfere with the detection of CHIPS. Consequently, because of this interference the measured CHIPS serum concentration in \n \nsubjects\n \n 104 and 105 is an underestimation. Based on these data we calculated a predicted half life of CHIPS in vivo of at least 1.5 hours.\n\n\nWe observed the same correlation with α-CHIPS IgG titer when detecting the amount of CHIPS present on the neutrophil membrane surface. CHIPS could be detected on the surface of neutrophils from \n \nsubjects\n \n 104 and 105 only. Furthermore, we showed that these CHIPS molecules occupy the FPR and C5aR since there is a downregulation in the detection of both receptors by α-FPR and α-C5aR antibodies in these individuals. Also, only neutrophils from \n \nsubjects\n \n 104 and 105 showed a decreased activation upon stimulation with fMLP. Unfortunately, experiments with C5a stimulation failed due to technical problems. However these experiments clearly show that intravenous administered CHIPS has an inhibitory effect on neutrophil activation ex vivo and that this effect is inhibited by α-CHIPS antibodies.\n\n\nNo relevant adverse effects were observed in pre-clinical animal toxicity studies. The administration of 0.1 mg kg\n−1 \nCHIPS in human subjects was tolerated by 2 subjects (\nsubjects\n 103 and 104) moderately tolerated in subject 105 but subject 106 developed serious symptoms directly after the CHIPS infusion, which were diagnosed as an anaphylactoid reaction. We measured the neutrophil CD11b surface expression in all subjects to investigate CHIPS-induced cell-activation. Activation of cells was observed for \n \n \nsubjects\n \n \n 104, 105 and 106. Within the group of subjects that received CHIPS there was a increase in C-reactive protein at \nday\n 2 post dose compared to controls.\n\n\nMast cells, which are leukocytes found in peripheral tissue, play a central role in inflammation and immediate allergic reactions. The release of tryptase from the secretory granules is a characteristic feature of mast cell degranulation. Serum mast cell tryptase concentration is increased in anaphylaxis and in other allergic conditions (see Payne & Kam, 2004\n, Anaesthesia \n59(7):695-703). The anaphylactoid reaction, observed after CHIPS administration, was confirmed by an increase in tryptase levels representing mast cell activation. The rise in tryptase levels was preceded by an increase in circulating immune complexes. Immune complexes can activate mast cells by FcγR crosslinking and through activation of complement and the generation of C5a (see Jancar & Crespo, 2005\n, Trends Immunol \n26(1):48-55).\n\n\nIn vitro experiments confirmed the cell activating properties of CHIPS in the presence of α-CHIPS antibodies. CHIPS induced neutrophil activation was inhibited by blocking FcγRII and FcγRIII blocking antibodies. This indicates that the CHIPS induced activation of these cells is most likely caused by CHIPS/α-CHIPS immune complexes. When we look for circulating immune complexes in the tested subjects we also find an increase in immune complexes in the subjects receiving intravenous CHIPS. The relation between α-CHIPS antibody titer and CHIPS induced cell activation is also clear from the in vitro and ex vivo experiments. This is in contrast with the observation that subject 103, who has the highest α-CHIPS antibody titer, reports only minor adverse effects. Of course, the studied population was limited to only 4 subjects and a large amount of different factors influence the development and perception of the adverse effects within an individual. Furthermore, in vitro experiments demonstrate that there is an optimal antibody concentration that induces cell activation. It is possible that a very high α-CHIPS antibody titer decreases the development of an anaphylactoid reaction. Earlier studies showed that CHIPS does not bind other cells than those expressing the C5aR and FPR and there is no evidence of direct cell activation by CHIPS. Although antibodies clearly play a role in cell activation the small number of observations and the complexity of in vivo hampers interpretation of these data.\n\n\nWe demonstrated that two CHIPS mutants with a reduced affinity for α-CHIPS IgG (CHIPS\nR46A \nand CHIPS\nK69A\n) show a decreased cell activating potential in vitro. Despite the neutralizing effect of α-CHIPS antibodies we were able to detect significant serum concentrations of the CHIPS protein. Moreover intravenous administered CHIPS was detected on circulating neutrophils, bound to the FPR and C5aR and able to inhibit neutrophil responses upon ex vivo stimulation with fMLP. This indicates that the CHIPS protein is able to find its target, the FPR and C5aR, in vivo.\n\n\nWe showed that the half-life of the CHIPS protein in serum is approximately 1.5 hours. Furthermore, the same half life was also observed for CHIPS bound to its receptors on the cell surface indicating a functional half life in the same order of magnitude. This indicates that the CHIPS protein is not immediately cleared from the blood. It might be possible to increase the half life of the CHIPS protein by introducing point mutations, as has been shown for streptokinase, a protein drug used for thrombolysis in acute myocardial infarction (see Wu et al., 1998\n, Appl Environ Microbiol \n64(3):824-829). However, a half-life of 1.5 hours implies that any (immunosuppressive) effect will rapidly disappear when dosing is stopped. This could be an advantage over antibody drugs with a long half-life, like Infliximab, that has been associated with an increase in the incidence of infections (see Listing et al., 2005\n, Arthritis Rheum \n52(11):3403-3412; Crum et al., 2005\n, Medicine \n(\nBaltimore\n) 84(5):291-302).\n\n\nExample B\n\n\nIdentification of Conformational Epitopes for Human IgG on the Chemotaxis Inhibitory Protein of \nStaphylococcus aureus \nUsing a Random Peptide Phage Display Library\n\n\nMaterials & Methods\n\n\nCloning, Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins\n\n\nCHIPS, CHIPS\n31-121 \n(CHIPS without the first 30 amino acids) and CHIPS\n31-113 \n(CHIPS without the first 30 and last 8 amino acids) were created as described earlier (see de Haas et al., 2004\n, J Exp Med \n199(5):687-95; Haas et al., 2004\n, J Immunol \n173(9):5704-11). The genes were cloned into the pRSET-B vector directly downstream the enterokinase cleavage site and before the EcoRI restriction site by overlap extension PCR (see Ho et al., 1989\n, Gene \n77(1):51-59). Initially the CHIPS gene was amplified from chromosomal \nS. aureus \nDNA. This product was used as template for further cloning. The amplification reactions were performed using PFU TURBO DNA polymerase (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, Tex.). The final PCR product was purified using PCR Purification Kit (Qiaquick, Qiagen), cloned into the EcoRI and XbaI site of the pRSET-B vector and propagated in TOP10F′ \nE. coli \nfollowing manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). After verification of the correct sequence by using ABI Prism 377 (Applied Biosystems), the recombinant protein was expressed in Rosetta-Gami \nE. coli \n(Novagen, MERCK Biosciences) by induction with 1 mM IPTG (Isopropyl β-D-Thiogalactoside, Invitrogen).\n\n\nBacteria were lysed with CELLYTIC B Bacterial Cell lysis/Extraction Reagent (Sigma) and lysozyme according to the manufacturer's description. The histidine-tagged protein was purified using a nickel column (HiTrap Chelating HP, 5 mL, Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions and cleaved afterwards with enterokinase (Invitrogen). Samples were checked for purity and presence of protein by means of 15% SDS-PAGE (Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, MINI PROTEAN R3 System, Bio-Rad) and Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Merck) staining. Protein concentrations were determined by absorbance at 280 nm.\n\n\nCell Culture\n\n\nU937 cells (human promonocytic cell line) transfected with C5aR (U937/C5aR) were a generous gift from Dr Prossnitz (University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, N. Mex.). Alternatively, such cells may be produced using techniques well known in the art.\n\n\nCells were grown in 75 cm\n2 \ncell culture flasks with 2 μL vent caps (Corning, Acton, Mass.) placed in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37° C. Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with L glutamine (Invitrogen Life Technologies) including 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen Life Technologies), 2.5 mg mL\n−1 \nglucose (Sigma-Aldrich), 10% FCS (Invitrogen Life Technologies) and 10 μg·mL\n−1 \ngentamycin (Invitrogen Life Technologies). Cells were diluted 1/10 (v/v) twice a week (see Haas et al., 2004\n, J Immunol \n173(9):5704-11).\n\n\nCHIPS Activity Assays\n\n\nThe activation by chemoattractants initiates a rapid and transient increase in the free intracellular calcium concentration. Calcium mobilization with U937/C5aR cells was measured as previously described (see Haas et al., 2004\n, J Immunol \n173(9):5704-11). Briefly, wild type CHIPS and truncated CHIPS variants (CHIPS\n31-121 \nand CHIPS\n31-113\n) were tested for their ability to inhibit the C5a-induced calcium mobilisation. Cells (5×10\n6 \nmL\n−1 \nin RPMI 1640/0.05% HSA) were incubated with 2×10\n−6 \nM Fluo-3-AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg.) at room temperature for 20 min, washed twice, and suspended in RPMI 1640/0.05% HSA (10\n6 \nmL\n−1\n). The cells were preincubated with buffer, or 1 μg·mL\n−1 \nCHIPS or CHIPS variant at room temperature for 30 min. Incubation with buffer served as blank control. Cells were stimulated with an increasing concentration of C5a (Sigma-Aldrich). Increase in fluorescence representing cell activation was measured in a FACSCalibur flowcytometer.\n\n\nAnti-CHIPS ELISA\n\n\nMicrotitre plates (Greiner) were coated with 50 μL CHIPS per well at 1 μg·mL\n−1 \nin PBS overnight at 4° C. All wash steps were performed thrice with PBS-0.05% Tween-20 and subsequent incubations were done for 1 hour at 37° C. Plates were blocked with PBS-0.05% Tween-20 4% BSA, washed and incubated with antibodies diluted in PBS-0.05% Tween-20 1% BSA. Bound antibodies were detected with species-specific goat anti-IgG conjugated with peroxidase (all from Southern, Birmingham, USA) and TMB as substrate. The reaction was stopped with H\n2\nSO\n4 \nand the absorbance measured at 450 nm in a BioRad ELISA-reader. For peptide experiments, plates were coated with ±10 μM25-mer peptides (Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Utrecht, The Netherlands; see Haas et al., 2004\n, J Immunol \n173(9):5704-11) in PBS overnight at 4° C. and treated as described for CHIPS.\n\n\nAffinity Purification of Human-α-CHIPS-IgG\n\n\nCHIPS or truncated CHIPS variant was coupled to CNBr activated sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) and packed onto a \nTricon\n 5/20 column (Amersham Biosciences) according to manufacturer's instructions. Human IgG (60 mg·mL\n−1\n) (Sanquin, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) was diluted three times in PBS and filtered through a 0.2 μm filter. Affinity purification was performed on an ÄKTAPRIME system using a 50 mL loop (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the column was washed with 10 column volumes PBS followed by running a total of 1 g human-IgG (20 mg·mL\n−1\n) over the column at a flowrate of 0.5 mL min\n−1\n. The column was washed with 10 column volumes PBS and bound human-IgG was eluted with 0.1M glycine pH 3.0. 0.5 mL fractions were collected in tubes containing 50 μL 1MTris pH 8.0. Eluted fractions containing protein (as measured by OD\n280\n) were pooled and buffer was changed to PBS using \nAmicon Ultra\n 15 5000 MWCO spin columns. Sodium azide was added to a final concentration of 0.02% and affinity purified-human-α-CHIPS-IgG was stored at 4° C.\n\n\nPreparation of Phages Expressing the CHIPS\n31-113 \nProtein\n\n\nPhage stocks were prepared according to standard protocols, using VSCM13 (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif., USA) as helper phage. Briefly, The CHIPS\n31-113 \ngene was cloned into the pFAB75 vector (see Engberg et al., 1996\n, Mol Biotechnol \n6(3):287-310) directly upstream the PIII gene and transformed into \nE. coli TOP\n10F′ (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif., USA). Bacteria were cultured until log-phase and infected with helper phage (multiplicity of infection: ˜20). The super-infected bacteria were incubated for 30 min at 37° C. without shaking. Bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation and used to inoculate LB medium containing ampicillin (50 μg·mL\n−1\n), kanamycin (10 μg·mL\n−1\n), tetracyclin (10 μg·mL\n−1\n) and isopropyl-α-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG)(1 mM). The culture was incubated for 15 h at 30° C. with vigorous shaking. Supernatant was collected by centrifugation and phages were precipitated by adding 116 \nculture volume\n 25% PEG6000 (Fluka), 3MNaCl. Precipitated phages were resuspended in \nPBS\n 1% BSA and filtered sterile through a 0.45 μm filter\n\n\nAnti-Phage Reactivity of Human Affinity Purified-α-CHIPS\n31-113\n-IgG\n\n\nTwo Maxisorb 96 well plates (Nunc, Rochester, N.Y., USA) were incubated overnight at 4° C. with 1 μg·mL−1 mouse-_-M13 monoclonal antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Piscataway, N.J., USA) in PBS. Plates were washed three times with PBS-0.05% Tween-20 and blocked with 200 μL PBS-0.05% Tween-20 5% BSA for 1 h at 37° C. Plates were washed with PBS-0.05% Tween-20 and 100 μL PBS, M13 phage or M13 phage expressing the CHIPS\n31-113 \nprotein (2×10\n11 \ncfu mL\n−1\n) was added and incubated for 1 h at 37° C. After washing plates were incubated for 1 h at 37° C. with 100 μL human affinity purified-α-CHIPS\n31-113\n-IgG, or rabbit-α-CHIPS-IgG at different concentrations.\n\n\nNext, plates were washed and 100 μL goat-α-human IgG-HRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, Pa., USA) or goat-α-rabbit-IgG-HRP (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, Ala., USA) at optimal concentration was added. Plates were washed three times and substrate (0.67 mg mL\n−1 \no-phenylenediamine, 35 mM sodium citrate, 67 mM NaPO3, \npH\n 5 and 0.012% H\n2\nO\n2\n) was added. The reaction was stopped with 100 μL 1M H\n2\nSO\n4 \nand absorbance was measured at 490 nm.\n\n\nRandom Peptide Phage Library and Phage Selection\n\n\nPhage libraries were purchased from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, Mass.). The Ph.D.-7 Display Peptide library consists of 7-mer random peptides fused with a linker sequence (Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser) to the N-terminus of the major coat protein pIII of bacteriophage M13. The library consists of ˜2.8×10\n9 \nelectroporated sequences (compared to 20\n7\n=1.28×10\n9 \npossible 7-residue sequences), to yield ˜70 copies of each sequence in 10 μL phage stock. The randomised segment of the Ph.D.-C7C™ library is flanked by a pair of cysteine residues, which are oxidized during phage assembly to a disulfide linkage, resulting in the displayed peptides being presented to the target as loops. The Ph.D.-7™ and Ph.D.-C7C™ libraries were used to map the epitopes for human IgG on the surface of the \nCHIPS protein\n 100 μL protein-G coated magnetic beads (Dynal) were washed three times with 1 mL PBS-0.05% Tween-20. The washed beads were blocked with 1 mL PBS-0.05% Tween-20 5% BSA for 1 h at 22° C. Beads were washed four times and resuspended in 1 mL PBS-0.05% Tween-20. One half of these blocked beads was used for preclearing the phage stock. Therefore, 10 μL Ph.D.-7™ and 10 μL Ph.D.-C7C™ was suspended in 180 μL PBS-0.05% Tween-20 containing the blocked beads and were incubated for 30 min at 22° C. under continuous agitation.\n\n\n1 μL affinity purified human-α-CHIPS\n31-113\n-IgG (300 μg·mL\n−1\n, final concentration approximately 10 nM) was added to the precleared phages and incubated at 22° C. for 30 min. The phage/IgG suspension was added to the remaining blocked beads and incubated at 22° C. for 30 min. The beads were washed 10 times with PBS-0.05% Tween-20 to wash away unbound phages. The Tween concentration in wash step was raised stepwise up to 0.5% in consecutive rounds to increase stringency. The bound phages were eluted with 125 μL 0.2 M glycine, pH 2.2, 0.1% BSA for 8 min after which the pH of the eluate was immediately neutralised with 15 μL 1M Tris-HCL, pH 8.\n\n\nThe eluate was amplified and 10 μL of amplified phages was used as input for a next selection round. To further increase the specificity of the phage selection the bound phages in the fourth round were eluted using competition elution with the CHIPS protein. Bound phages were eluted by overnight incubation with 1.8 mg mL\n−1 \nCHIPS.\n\n\nPhage Titration and Amplification\n\n\nSince the library phage are derived from the common cloning vector M13mp19, which carries the lacZa gene, phage plaques appear blue when plated on media containing Xgal and IPTG. Environmental filamentous phage will typically yield white plaques when plated on the same media.\n\n\n10 mL LB-medium was inoculated with a single colony ER2738 \nE. coli \nand incubated at 37° C. with vigorous shaking until mid-log phase (OD\n600 \n˜0.5). Top agar (50% LB-agar, 50% LB-medium) was melted and cooled to approximately 45° C. 3 mL melted top agar was added to 200 μL ER2738 \nE. coli \nand poured on top of a LB/IPTG/Xgal plate (LB-agar plate containing 0.5 mM IPTG, 80 μg·mL\n−1 \nXgal). 1 μL phage eluate was used to make ten fold serial dilutions. 10 μL of each dilution in LB-medium was spotted on the prepared culture plates and incubated overnight at 37° C. The next day plaques were counted in order to calculate phage titers.\n\n\nThe remaining phage eluate was added to 20 mL ER2738 \nE. coli \nculture at early log phase (OD\n600 \n0.4-0.5) and incubated with vigorously shaking at 37° C. for 4.5 h. Cultured cells were centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 10 min at 4° C. The supernatant was poured into a new tube and ⅙ volume of 25% PEG6000 (Fluka), 3 M NaCl was added and phages were precipitated overnight at 4° C. The precipitated phages were centrifuged for 15 min at 10000 rpm, 4° C. The pellet containing the amplified phages was resuspended in 200 μL PBS and titrated as described above. After the fourth selection round, no phage amplification was performed but phages were directly characterized by DNA sequencing.\n\n\nCharacterisation of Binding Phages\n\n\nAn overnight culture of ER2738 \nE. coli \nwas diluted 1:100 in LB-medium. 48 different plaques from the titration plates were stabbed with a pipette tip and transferred to 1 mL of the diluted culture. The infected culture was incubated for 4.5˜0.5 h at 37° C. Cultures were centrifuged for 30 s at 13600 rpm and 500 μl of the supernate was transferred to a fresh microcentrifuge tube. 200 μL PEG6000, 3 M NaCl was added and phages were precipitated for 10 min at 22° C. The sample was centrifuged for 10 min at 13600 rpm. The pellet was resuspended in 100 μL Iodide buffer (4 M NaI, 10 mM EDTA, pH 8) and 250 μL 95% EtOH was added and incubated for 10 min at 22° C. to preferentially precipitate the single stranded phage DNA. Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 13600 rpm and the pellet was washed with 70% EtOH, dried and send for sequencing using the ‘-96 PIII sequencing’ primer (5′-CCCTCATAGTTAGCGTAACG-3′ [SEQ ID NO:2], New England Biolabs).\n\n\nEpitope Mapping\n\n\nThe amino acid sequences of the selected phages were aligned using Clustal-W (see Aiyar, 2000\n, Methods. Mol. Biol. \n132:221-41). Consensus sequences were manually mapped onto the surface of the CHIPS protein using the CHIPS\n31-121 \nPDB file (PDB access code 1XEE) and the PyMol molecular graphics program (see DeLano, 2002, The PyMol Molecular Graphics System. Delano Scientific, San Carlos).\n\n\nBinding Specificity of Selected Phages\n\n\nA phage ELISA was used to test the binding specificity of the selected phages for affinity purified human-α-CHIPS\n31-113\n-IgG. A 96 well Maxisorb plate was coated overnight with 100 μg·mL\n−1 \naffinity purified human-α-CHIPS\n31-113\nIgG in PBS at 4° C. The plate was washed four times with PBS-0.05% Tween-20 and blocked with 300 μL PBS-0.05% Tween-20 5% BSA for 1 h at 37° C. Simultaneously a second Maxisorb plate was blocked with PBS-0.05% Tween-20 5% BSA to serve as control for binding to BSA coated plastic. Plates were washed four times and incubated for 1 h at 37° C. with different dilutions of the purified phage stocks in PBS-0.05% Tween-201% BSA. Plates were washed four times and incubated for 1 h at 37° C. with 50 μL mouse-α-M13-mAb (1 μg·mL−1) (Amersham) in PBS-0.05% Tween-20 1% BSA. Plates were washed and incubated with 50 μL Rabbit-α-mouse IgG-HRP (1:2000 in PBS-0.05% Tween-20 1% BSA) for 1 h at 37° C. After washing 100 μL substrate was added and the reaction was stopped with 150 μL 1MHCl. Absorbance at 492 nm was measured in an ELISA plate reader.\n\n\nAffinity Purification of hu-α-peptide IgG\n\n\nPeptides of 7 amino acids, compromising the phage derived sequences, were synthesised with an additional C-terminal spacer of three Glycines and a Cysteine for efficient coupling (Isogen Life Science; IJsselstein, The Netherlands and Bio-Synthesis; Lewisville, Tx). Two control peptides were included, one with the minimal 7-mer sequence (plus GGGC [SEQ ID NO:3] for coupling) recognised by a mAb (clone S5/1) directed against the human C5a-Receptor (Bio-Synthesis), and a 38-mer peptide compromising the N-terminal part of CHIPS (first 37 amino acids plus an additional Cystein; Pepscan Systems; Lelystad, the Netherlands). Peptides were dissolved in H\n2\nO and stored at −20° C. For ELISA, peptides were diluted to 25 μg·mL−1 in 0.1 M Tris/HCl at pH 8 and coated for 90 min onto Nunc Covalink NH plates that were treated for 30 min with 10 mM N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate (SPDP) to introduce free amino groups and washed with H\n2\nO. Thereafter the plates were treated according to the same protocol as for the other ELISAs. To couple the peptides to a solid matrix, peptides were first reduced using agarose linked Tris(2-Carboxyethyl) Phosphine (TCEP, Pierce) and subsequently mixed with Sulfo-Link agarose beads (Pierce) in 50 mM Tris/HCl buffer pH 8.3 with 5 mM EDTA and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. Unreacted groups were blocked with L-cysteine and beads were extensively washed with coupling buffer and PBS. Small 1 ml columns were used for affinity purification of IgG from a human immunoglobulin preparation for iv use (Sanquin) as described for CHIPS. Eluted IgG was mixed with 100 μg·mL\n−1 \npure human albumin, dialyzed overnight against PBS and the actual IgG content determined by ELISA.\n\n\nAnalysis of Antibody Binding to Selected Peptides Using Surface Plasmon Resonance\n\n\nBinding of affinity purified antibodies and pooled human IgG to the synthetic peptides and the CHIPS protein was studied on a \nBiacore\n 1000 instrument. Peptides containing a C-terminal cysteine residue were coupled to a carboxymethyl dextran sensor chip CM5 using N-ethyl-N′ (dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) chemistry with the Thiol coupling kit (Pharmacia Biacore) to activate the CM5 dextran. After activation, 20 μL of 2-(2-pyrdinyldithio) ethaneamine (PDEA) was injected and subsequently, 35 μL of the cysteine containing peptide, 1 mg·mL\n−1 \nin 0.1 M NaAc, 1 M NaCl, \npH\n 4 were injected during 7 minutes. Unreacted groups were blocked by injection of 20 μL L-cysteine during 4 minutes. For CHIPS coupling, 20 μL CHIPS (1 mg·mL\n−1\n) was directly injected onto an EDC/NHS activated sensor chip. Remaining reactive groups on the sensor chip surface were saturated by injection of 50 μL 1 M ethanolamine-HCL pH 8.5 (Pharmacia).\n\n\nThe binding assays were performed at a constant flow rate of 5 μL·min\n−1 \nat 25° C. Affinity purified antibodies and IV-IgG were diluted in HBS-EP buffer (10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) containing 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA and 0.005% surfactant P20). Antibodies were allowed to interact with immobilized peptides for 210 s followed by a two minute dissociation phase. Additionally the antibodies were preincubated with 1 mg mL\n−1 \nCHIPS protein to study competition. Affinity purified α-peptide antibodies were tested at a concentration of 10 μg·mL\n−1\n. Residual bound antibody was removed from the sensor chip surface by washing the chip for three minutes with 10 mMglycine-HCl (pH 1.5).\n\n\nResults\n\n\nActivity of CHIPS\n31-113 \n \n\n\nPreviously, we described the CHIPS\n31-121 \nprotein that showed a complete preservation of C5aR blocking activity (see Haas et al., 2005\n, J Mol Biol \n353(4):859-872). In order to find a smaller active CHIPS variant we deleted part of the C-terminus outside the folded core of the protein (see Haas et al., 2005\n, J Mol Biol \n353(4):859-872). \nFIG. 14\n shows the activity of different CHIPS variants compared to wild type CHIPS. All CHIPS variants were able to inhibit C5a induced activation U937/C5aR cells.\n\n\nAffinity Purified α-Chips Antibodies Recognize Conformational Epitopes\n\n\nPooled human IgG was affinity purified using a column packed with immobilised-CHIPS resin. We tested the binding of affinity purified α-CHIPS antibodies to a set of CHIPS derived 25 mer peptides spanning the total CHIPS sequence (see Haas et al., 2004\n, J Immunol \n173(9):5704-11). As shown in \nFIG. 15\n only wild type CHIPS and peptides derived from the N-terminus of CHIPS were recognised by the affinity purified α-CHIPS antibodies. This suggests that these α-CHIPS antibodies do not recognise linear epitopes between \nresidue\n 30 and 113.\n\n\nTo confirm the presence of conformational epitopes in the CHIPS protein we tested the reactivity of two different affinity purified antibody preparations (α-CHIPS\n1-121 \nand α-CHIPS\n31-113\n) to wild type CHIPS(CHIPS\nwt\n), and two truncated CHIPS proteins (CHIPS\n31-121 \nand CHIPS\n31-113\n). \nFIG. 16\n shows that all antibodies react with the CHIPS protein. Although affinity purified α-CHIPS\n1-121 \ncontains epitopes directed against the N-terminus (\nFIG. 15\n) there is no significant difference in reactivity towards the different CHIPS variants between the preparations. This could indicate an excess of conformational epitopes over linear. A CHIPS specific mouse monoclonal antibody directed against a conformational epitope served as control.\n\n\nAffinity Purified α-CHIPS IgG Does not React with Wild Type M13 Phage\n\n\nHuman-α-phage IgG, present in the affinity purified α-CHIPS\n31-113 \nIgG preparation, could potentially interfere with the phage selection experiments. Therefore we tested the binding of affinity purified α-CHIPS\n31-113 \nIgG to empty M13 phages (M13 phages expressing a wild type pIII surface protein) by ELISA. \nFIG. 17\n shows that affinity purified α-CHIPS\n31-113 \nIgG does not react with wild type M13 phages but is perfectly recognises M13 phages expressing the CHIPS protein. Affinity purified α-CHIPS IgG up to a concentration of 100 μg·mL\n−1 \nwas used. Even at this high concentration there was no difference in binding to empty phages compared to background. Therefore, we conclude that no significant amount of α-phage antibodies are present in the affinity purified α-CHIPS\n31-113 \nIgG preparation that could interfere with the selection experiments.\n\n\nBiopanning and Characterisation of Recombinant Phages\n\n\nThe affinity purified α-CHIPS\n31-113 \nIgG was used to select phages from two random peptide phage libraries and map the epitopes for human IgG onto the CHIPS protein surface. After four rounds of biopanning 48 recombinant phage clones were randomly selected and characterized by DNA sequencing. The sequences of 47 clones are shown in table 3 (sequencing of clone 27 failed). The sequence ‘MNKTWYP’ [SEQ ID NO:4] occurred 12 times in this set of 47 sequences and is thereby the most abundant followed by ‘MNKTFWF’ [SEQ ID NO:5] that was selected 4 times. Interestingly, the sequence ‘FNKSYYG’ [SEQ ID NO:6] occurred 3 times but these sequences differed in genetic sequence and therefore are not a simple amplification of a single selected phage (data not shown). Although we started out with a mixture of two different libraries (Ph.D.-7™ and Ph.D.-C7C™) the selected sequences were all originating from the Ph.D.-7™ library.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Peptide sequences of 47\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrecombinant phage clones after\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 rounds of panning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClone\n\n\nSequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n01\n\n\nM N K T W Y P\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[SEQ ID NO: 7]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n02\n\n\nG K L P I A M\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[SEQ ID NO: 8]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n03\n\n\nM N K T W Y P\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[SEQ ID NO: 9]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n04\n\n\nM N K T F W F\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[SEQ ID NO: 10]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n05\n\n\nY N K S F F M\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[SEQ ID NO: 11]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n06\n\n\nA A A P S H H\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[SEQ ID NO: 12]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n07\n\n\nY N K S F F P\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[SEQ ID NO: 13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n08\n\n\nG K L P I P Y\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[SEQ ID NO: 14]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n09\n\n\nM N K T F S A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[SEQ ID NO: 15]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nM N K T W Y P\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[SEQ ID NO: 16]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\nG K L P K M T\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[SEQ ID NO: 17]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\nM N K S Y T I\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[SEQ ID NO: 18]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\nV N K T Y W K\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[SEQ ID NO: 19]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\nM N K V Y L P\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[SEQ ID NO: 20]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n15\n\n\nG K L P P P I\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[SEQ ID NO: 21]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n16\n\n\nA L Q A S R H\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[SEQ ID NO: 22]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n17\n\n\nM N K T W Y P\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[SEQ ID NO: 23]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\nM N K T W Y P\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[SEQ ID NO: 24]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n19\n\n\nF N K S W F P\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[SEQ ID NO: 25]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\nM N K T W Y P\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[SEQ ID NO: 26]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n21\n\n\nM N K T W Y P\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[SEQ ID NO: 27]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n22\n\n\nM N K Y H N P\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[SEQ ID NO: 28]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n23\n\n\nM N K T F W F\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[SEQ ID NO: 29]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n24\n\n\nG K M M V S E\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[SEQ ID NO: 30]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n25\n\n\nM N K S Y H L\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[SEQ ID NO: 31]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n26\n\n\nL N K T F Y Y\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[SEQ ID NO: 32]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n28\n\n\nM N K T F V P\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[SEQ ID NO: 33]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n29\n\n\nM N K T F F S\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[SEQ ID NO: 34]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n30\n\n\nG K L P K E S\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[SEQ ID NO: 35]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n31\n\n\nM N K T F W F\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[SEQ ID NO: 36]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n32\n\n\nM N K T W Y P\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[SEQ ID NO: 37]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n33\n\n\nF N K S Y Y G\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[SEQ ID NO: 38]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n34\n\n\nY N K S F F M\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[SEQ ID NO: 39]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n35\n\n\nA G A P R H H\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[SEQ ID NO: 40]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n36\n\n\nM N K T F W F\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[SEQ ID NO: 41]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n37\n\n\nM N K T F V D\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[SEQ ID NO: 42]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n38\n\n\nM N K S Y H L\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[SEQ ID NO: 43]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n39\n\n\nF N K S Y Y G\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[SEQ ID NO: 44]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n40\n\n\nM N K T W Y P\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[SEQ ID NO: 45]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n41\n\n\nM N K T W Y P\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[SEQ ID NO: 46]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n42\n\n\nM N K T W Y P\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[SEQ ID NO: 47]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n43\n\n\nM N K T W Y P\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[SEQ ID NO: 48]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n44\n\n\nM N K T F W F\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[SEQ ID NO: 49]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n45\n\n\nM P L R A S Q\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[SEQ ID NO: 51]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n46\n\n\nG K L P W P K\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[SEQ ID NO: 52]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n47\n\n\nF N K S Y Y G\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[SEQ ID NO: 53]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n48\n\n\nM N K T F F S\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[SEQ ID NO: 54]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe combined Ph.D.−7™ and Ph.D.−C7C™ random peptide phage libraries were selected for binding to affinity purified α-CHIPS\n31-113 \nIgG in four consecutive panning rounds.

The consensus sequences for each group are shown in Table 4.\n\n\nThe selected sequences were manually mapped onto the surface of the CHIPS protein using the PyMol molecular graphics program and the CHIPS31-121 pdb file (PDB access code 1XEE) as shown in \nFIG. 18\n. A fourth epitope was identified from the selected sequences. Although the sequence ‘PLRASQ’ [SEQ ID NO:55] expressed by phage ø45) appeared only once among the 47 sequenced recombinant phages, this sequence could be perfectly mapped onto the surface of the CHIPS molecule. Additionally the peptide sequence expressed by phage ø16 (‘ALQASRH’ [SEQ ID NO:56]) shows a very high similarity to this ‘epitope’.\n\n\n8 different recombinant phages, that express a peptide sequence most similar to the predicted epitopes, were further characterized by ELISA (Table 5). \nFIG. 19\n \na \nshows that these phages specifically bind to affinity purified α-CHIPS\n31-113 \nIgG but not BSA (\nFIG. 19\n \nb\n).

Since the N-terminus of the CHIPS protein was found to contain epitopes for human IgG (\nFIG. 15\n) a synthetic peptide comprising the N-terminal 37 CHIPS residues and an additional cysteine (pep1-38) was used as a positive control. The peptides were coupled to thiol activated sepharose to create different affinity columns. These columns were used for affinity purification of human IgG. Binding of the affinity purified α-peptide antibodies to the different peptides and the CHIPS molecule was verified by ELISA (data not shown) and studied in a \nBiacore\n 1000 instrument (\nFIG. 20\n).\n\n\nThe affinity purified α-peptide antibodies show an increase in binding to their specific peptide as compared to IVIgG.

We show that this is especially true for CHIPS, since affinity purified α-CHIPS antibodies fail to recognize linear parts of the CHIPS protein between residue 31 and 113. Consequently, the utility of truncated molecules in epitope mapping is limited, as even small deletions and substitutions can have considerable impact on the structure of the molecule. The use of random peptide libraries overcomes the limitations of epitope mapping with truncated molecules.\n\n\nPrevious studies show the potential of random peptide phage display libraries in identifying linear epitopes (see Yang et al., 2005\n, J Immunol Methods \n304(1-2):15-29) and conformational epitopes of monoclonal antibodies (see Cook et al., 1998\n, J Autoimmun \n11(3):205-211; Myers et al., 2000\n, J Immunol \n165(7):3830-3838; Shaw et al., 2002\n, Biochem J \n363(Pt 1):137-145). These studies show that peptides expressed by phage display are capable of adopting a conformation that mimics the conformational epitope and allows for affinity purification. In this study, epitopes on CHIPS were mapped using a random peptide phage display library. To our knowledge the present study is the first report of mapping conformational epitopes in a polyclonal antibody preparation.\n\n\nWe selected phages for binding to affinity purified α-CHIPS\n31-113 \nIgG. Schluederberg et al. (1980\n, Nature \n283(5749):792-4) showed that phages indistinguishable from M13 can be isolated from human faeces. Despite the large amount of M13 phages in the environment we showed that our affinity purified antibody preparation did not contain any detectable α-M13 phage antibody levels. However, to increase the specificity of selected phages for binding to α-CHIPS antibodies we used competition elution with a high concentration CHIPS.\n\n\nAfter four selection rounds 47 clones were sequenced. Phage selection depends on a large variety of factors. For instance, arginines in the displayed peptide sequence interfere with secretion of pIII; consequently, clones with peptides containing Arg are strongly selected against (see Peters et al., 1994\n, J Bacterial \n176(14):4296-4305). Also, the stringency and nature of wash steps can favor certain phages (see Smith & Petrenko, 1997\n, Chem Rev \n97(2):391-410). Therefore, although the sequence ‘MNKTWMP’ [SEQ ID NO:86] was most frequently isolated no further conclusions can be inferred from this observation. The Ph.D.-7™ and Ph.D.-C7C™ libraries both consists of ˜2.8×10\n9 \nelectroporated sequences (compared to 20\n7\n=1.28×10\n9 \npossible 7-residue sequences) and contain a wide diversity of sequences with no obvious positional biases. From this large library we selected 4 sequences that could be mapped onto the surface of the CHIPS molecule. These similarities cannot be explained by coincidence and therefore we conclude that these sequences represent conformational epitopes.\n\n\nFurther characterisation of 8 phages, each expressing a different peptide sequence most similar to the predicted epitopes, was performed by ELISA. These phages show binding to affinity purified α CHIPS IgG. Earlier we showed that the affinity purified α-CHIPS IgG does not contain any detectable amounts of anti M13 phage antibodies. Therefore, we conclude that this interaction is specific for the expressed peptide.\n\n\nTo confirm that the expressed peptides were able to mimic the conformational epitopes on the CHIPS protein, additional experiments were performed. Using synthetic peptides, similar to the peptides selected from the phage library, we affinity purified antibodies from a pool, of IgG that specifically recognized the CHIPS protein. These affinity purified antibodies interacted with their specific peptide. This interaction did not compete with CHIPS protein. From these observations we conclude that α-peptide antibodies are present in the IV-IgG pool that recognise different conformations of the synthetic peptide. Most of these conformations differ from the CHIPS conformational epitope and therefore do not compete with the CHIPS protein. Since the synthetic peptides contain a spacer (Gly-Gly-Gly-Cys [SEQ ID NO:87]) it is possible that the purified antibody preparations contain α-spacer or α-spacer-peptide antibodies.\n\n\nBinding studies of the affinity purified a peptide antibodies to the CHIPS protein reveal a subset that specifically recognize the CHIPS protein. The conformation of the epitope recognised by these antibodies on the CHIPS protein surface is constrained and therefore there is no competition with other α-peptide antibodies recognizing different peptide conformations.\n\n\nAlthough CHIPS is a small, compact folded protein it is difficult to estimate the total amount of epitopes present. The Ph.D.-7™ and Ph.D.-C7C™ libraries we used are limited in the size of the expressed peptides to seven residues and therefore limits the size of the mimicked epitopes. We mapped four epitopes onto the surface of the CHIPS molecule. Additional selections using libraries that express larger peptides could be used to identify additional epitopes.\n\n\nWe focused on the CHIPS\n31-113 \nmolecule, the part of CHIPS responsible for blocking the C5aR. Interestingly we did not isolate a peptide phages mimicking a linear epitope. This is in accordance with the results of the pepscan ELISA in which we observed no interaction between the affinity purified α-CHIPS antibodies and CHIPS derived peptides.\n\n\nFor the affinity purification of α-CHIPS IgG we started with a pool of IgG obtained from a large group of donors. It is most likely that different individuals recognise a subset of epitopes. Using the described selection technique in future research can give more insight in the distribution of epitope recognition between different individuals.\n\n\nExample C\n\n\nExemplary Variant CHIPS Polypeptides I\n\n\nChips Peptide ELISA: Single Point Measurement of Library\n\n\nGoal: To determine peptide binding capacity of CHIPS mutants in crude cell lysate.\n\n\nSummary: A tandem sandwich ELISA was optimised with Streptavidin as coating, followed by a biotinylated C5aR peptide to which CHIPS binding was detected by a monoclonal antibody, mAb 2H7, followed by a secondary HRP conjugated polyclonal antibody and substrate. A standard curve with purified recombinant CHIPS\nwt \nwas prepared for each ELISA plate. Absorbance at 492 nm was measured and plotted against concentration of standard and analysed in a 4-parameter curve fitting model, from which the peptide binding of the mutants was calculated and correlated to the expressed concentration as specific activity.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\n\n10×PBS (BioWhittaker #BE17-517Q, lot 4MB0102)\n\n\nPBS Tween 20 (0.05%) (Medicago #09-8410-100, lot 113303)\n\n\nBSA (Merck #1.12018.0100, lot K54593318527)\n\n\nCELLYTIC B (Sigma #B-3553, lot 114K65156)\n\n\nSIGMAFAST OPD (Sigma #P9186, lot 055K8204)\n\n\nF96 Maxisorp (Nunc #442404, lot 079027)\n\n\n96-well U-shape PP plate\n\n\n \nStreptavidin\n 1 mg/ml (Sigma, Lot 120K1249)\n\n\nCD88-N-term peptide: ABCF-1, 6.3 mg/ml (lot 050805KaB)\n\n\nmAb 2H7 monoclonal antibody, 1 mg/ml (Utrecht, lot 2004-12)\n\n\nRabbit anti Mouse Ig-HRP (Dako #P0260, lot 00006983)\n\n\nrCHIPS\nwt\n, 1.8 mg/ml (Utrecht, lot 2004-12-02)\n\n\nCHIPS controls (lysate): CHIPSwt, K69A, 2mut.\n\n\nCHIPS Library:\n\n\nEquipment:\n\n\nELISA washer ELx405 (BioTek Instruments)\n\n\nShaker platform Titramax 1000 (Heidolph Instruments)\n\n\nFLUOstar Optima (BMG)Software\n\n\nExcel\n\n\nGraphPad Sigma\n\n\nBuffers:\n\n\nCoating buffer: 1×PBS: Add 100 \nml\n 10×PBS to 900 ml of deionised water.\n\n\nWashing buffert: PBS+0.05% Tween 20 (PBST): Add 1 tablet to 1000 ml of deionised water.\n\n\nAssay buffer A: PBST+1% BSA(w/v)+1% Cellytic(v/v)\n\n\nAssay buffer B: PBST+1% BSA(w/v)\n\n\nBlocking solution: PBST+4% BSA(w/v)\n\n\nProtocol (3 Plates)\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1.

Single Point Measurement of Library in 1:1000 Dilution in Secondary Screening\n\n\n\nGoal: To be able, in a single point measurement, to select clones with decreased binding to human polyclonal anti-CHIPS.\n\n\nSummary: Mutated clones, based on K69A, selected from primary screening (phage display) were tested for Human anti-CHIPS binding in a tandem sandwich ELISA. The ELISA was optimised with a monoclonal antibody binding to the first 30 amino acids (N-terminal) of CHIPS as coating antibody and polyclonal human anti CHIPS IgG as detection antibody. A HRP conjugated polyclonal antibody was used as second antibody followed by HRP-substrate. A standard curve with purified recombinant CHIPS\nwt \nwas prepared for each ELISA plate as inter plate control and a serial dilution of K69A lysate was used for calculation and comparison of the library. \nAbsorbance\n 492 nm was measured and plotted against concentration and analysed in a Sigmoidal curve fit with variable slop model. Expected binding (abs) was calculated for the mutants as if K69A.

Single Point Measurement of Library in 1:100 and 1:500 Dilution\n\n\n\nGoal: To determine concentration of CHIPS mutants in crude cell lysate after expression in pRSET vector.\n\n\nSummary: A tandem sandwich ELISA was optimised with two monoclonal antibodies binding to the first 30 amino acids (N-terminal) of CHIPS as coating- and detection antibodies. A HRP conjugated polyclonal antibody was used as second antibody followed by HRP-luminescence substrate. A standard curve with purified recombinant CHIPSwt was prepared for each ELISA plate. Relative Light Units (RLU) was measured and plotted against concentration of standard and analysed in a 4-parameter curve fitting model, from which the concentrations of the mutants was calculated.\n\n\nMaterial and Method:\n\n\n10×PBS (BioWhittaker #BE17-517Q, lot 4MB0102)\n\n\nPBS Tween 20 (0.05%) (Medicago #09-8410-100, lot 113303)\n\n\nBSA (Merck #1.12018.0100, lot K54593318527)\n\n\nCELLYTIC B (Sigma #B-3553, lot 114K65156)\n\n\nSuperSignal ELISA Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce #37069, lot FK97655)\n\n\n96-well flat-bottom high binding white LIA-plate (Greiner #655074, lot 04410129)\n\n\n96-well U-shape PP plate\n\n\nmAb 2H7 monoclonal antibody, 1 mg/ml (Utrecht, lot 2004-12)\n\n\nRabbit anti CHIPS-N-Pep IgG, 6 mg/ml (Utrecht, lot 2000-12-06)\n\n\nGoat anti rabbit IgG (H+L)-HRP (Southern Biotechnologies #40-50-05, lot C4103-S194D)\n\n\nrCHIPSwt, 1.8 mg/ml (Utrecht, lot 2004-12-02)\n\n\nCHIPS Mutants:\n\n\nEquipment:\n\n\nELISA washer ELx405 (BioTek Instruments)\n\n\nShaker platform Titramax 1000 (Heidolph Instruments)\n\n\nFLUOstar Optima (BMG)Software\n\n\nExcel\n\n\nGraphPad Sigma\n\n\nBuffers:\n\n\nCoating buffer: 1×PBS: Add 100 \nmL\n 10×PBS to 900 mL of deionised water.\n\n\nWashing buffert: PBS+0.05% Tween 20 (PBST): Add 1 tablet to 1000 mL of deionised water.\n\n\nAssay buffer A: PBST+1% BSA(w/v)+1% Cellytic(v/v)\n\n\nAssay buffer B: PBST+1% BSA(w/v)\n\n\nBlocking solution: PBST+4% BSA(w/v)\n\n\nProtocol (6 plates)\n\n \n \n1.

of random mutagenesis were used. GeneMorph II (Stratagene) was performed as recommended by the manufacturer. Briefly, 1 ng or 10 pg of DNA (the CHIPS gene harbouring mutations K61A, K69A or K100A) was added to the PCR reaction consisting of 250 ng of each primer (Fw: 5′-TCGCGGCC CAGCCGGCCATGGCCTTTACTTTTGAACCG-3′ [SEQ ID NO:88] and Rev: 5′-GCCTGCGG CCGCAGATCTACCATTAATTA CATAAG-3′) [SEQ ID NO:89], 0.8 mM dNTP, 1× Mutazyme buffer, 2.5 U Mutazyme DNA polymerase in a total volume of 50 μl. The PCR program consisted of a denaturing step at 95° C. for 2 min, 40 cycles of 95° C. for 1 min, 60° C. for 1 min and 72° C. for 1 min and finally elongation at 72° C. for 10 minutes. To achieve one library with a high frequency of mutations, and one with lower mutation frequency, the 1 ng library was subjected to one more round of Genemorph II mutagenesis. This time, the amount of DNA in the PCR reaction was 10 ng.\n\n\nError-prone PCR was performed as described previously (Leung et al, 1989\n, Technique \n1: 11-15). One library with high mutation frequency and one with low mutation frequency were created. Briefly, 10 ng DNA was added to a PCR reaction consisting of 20 μM of each primer (described above), 0.8 mM dNTP (New England Biolabs, MA, USA), 1× AMPLITAQ reaction buffer, 3.2 mM extra dGTP or dTTP respectively, 7.5 mM MgCl\n2\n, 0.64 mM MnCl\n2\n, 2.5 U AMPLITAQ Thermostable DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA) in a total volume of 50 μl. The PCR program consisted of a denaturing step at 94° C. for 5 min, 20 cycles of 94° C. for 30 s, 55° C. for 30 s and 72° C. for 40 s and finally elongation at 72° C. for 10 minutes. The PCR products were sub cloned into the PGEM-T vector (Promega) according to the manufacturer's recommendations and the sequences were verified and base exchanges evaluated.\n\n\nGeneration of Variant CHIPS Libraries using FIND® Technology\n\n\nIn one particular embodiment, the variants were generated using the FIND® (Fragment Induced Diversity) technology of Alligator Bioscience AB, as described in International Patent Applications Nos. WO 2002/48351, WO 03/097834 and PCT/GB2006/004294, which are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nPhage Display\n\n\nLibraries of variant CHIPS polypeptides were cloned into the phagemid pFAB75 (Engberg) SfiI and NotI sites and transformed into \nE. coli \nTOP 10 F′ (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif., USA) for expression on phage particles. Phage stocks were prepared according to standard protocols, using VSCM13 (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif., USA) as helper phage. An exponentially growing culture was infected with helper phages (multiplicity of infection: ˜20) and incubated without shaking at 37° C. for 30 minutes. The superinfected \nE. coli \nwere spun down and used to inoculate LB supplemented with ampicillin (50 μg/ml), kanamycin (10 μg/ml), tetracycline (10 μg/ml) and isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) (1 mM). The culture was grown at 30° C. with shaking for approximately 15 hours, before it was pelleted by centrifugation and subjected to polyethylene glycol/NaCl precipitation. The phages were redissolved in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo., USA) and filtered through a 0.45 μm filter.\n\n\nPositive Selection for C5aR Peptide Affinity\n\n\nSelections were performed on a biotinylated C5aR peptide consisting of amino acids 7-28 (AnaSpec, USA) and Streptavidin coated magnetic Dynabeads (Dynal, Norway). Separations were made on a magnetic stand for 2 minutes. Prior to the selections, the streptavidin beads (50 μl) were washed three times in 1 ml selection buffer (PBS containing 3% BSA and 0.05% Tween-20). 500 μl phage stock (containing ˜10\n11 \nphage particles) were pre-incubated with washed beads for 30 min at room temperature on rotation in order to remove any potential streptavidin binders. Peptide was added to the precleared phages at a final concentration of 10\n−7 \nM and the mixture was incubated for 1 hour on rotation at room temperature. At the same time, 500 streptavidin beads were blocked in selection buffer for 1 hour on rotation at room temperature. The peptide/phage mix was added to the beads and further incubated for 15 minutes on rotation at room temperature. The beads were then washed five times in 1 ml selection buffer, followed by three times in 1 ml PBS. To elute peptide binders, 450 μl 0.1M Glycine 0.1% BSA, pH 2.2 was added to the washed beads. After 10 min incubation at room temperature, 50 μl μM Tris pH 9.0 was added to neutralize the eluate. A few microliters of the eluted phages was saved and used for titration of the output phages, while the rest was used to infect exponentially growing \nE. coli \nTOP10 F′ (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif., USA) for preparation of new phage stocks. The selection protocol was then repeated once as described above.\n\n\nNegative Selection for Human Anti-CHIPS IgG Affinity\n\n\nDirectly after the second round of positive selection, CHIPS phage stocks were subjected to a round of negative selection for human anti-CHIPS\n31-113 \nIgG affinity. Magnetic beads coated with human anti-CHIPS\n31-113 \nIgG were washed three times in 1 ml selection buffer and then blocked in 1 ml selection buffer for 1 hour on rotation at room temperature. The eluate from the positive selection was added to the beads and they were incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. After separation on a magnet, the supernatant was saved as \neluate\n 1. Four rounds of elutions were made; 100 μl PBS was added to the beads followed by 5 minutes incubation at room temperature. After separation on the magnet, the PBS was saved as \neluate\n 2. This was repeated two times (\neluates\n 3 and 4). Eluate 1 and a pool of eluates 2-4 were used to infect exponentially growing \nE. coli \nTOP 10 F′(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif., USA) and the phagemids were then purified from the \nE. coli. \n \n\n\nCloning and Expression of Libraries in \nE. coli \n \n\n\nAfter phage selections, a selected pool of CHIPS variants were cleaved out from the pFAB75 vector and cloned into the pRSET vector (Invitrogen) BbsI and BglII sites for expression in \nE. coli \nlysates. Libraries were transformed into \nE. coli \nBL21 star DE3 pLysS (Invitrogen), plated on 20 cm Qtray plates with LB agar supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 34/ml chloramphenicol and incubated at 37° C. overnight. The following day, \nE. coli \ncolonies were picked and inoculated in 96 well Greiner round bottom plates containing 150 μl LB supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol using a Qpix robot. The cultures were incubated at 37° C. with 78% humidity and shaking at 700 rpm in a Multitron plate shaker overnight. Day cultures were prepared from the overnight cultures by inoculating 5 μl overnight culture in 145 μl LB/ampicillin/chloramphenicol at 37° C. as above. To induce protein expression, 0.5 mM IPTG (Isopropyl β-D-Thiogalactoside) was added to the cultures after three hours, and the cultures were then cultivated for another three hours. Protein was expressed in \nE. coli \nlysates which were prepared by freeze-thawing the \nE. coli \npellet in 90 p. 1 buffer consisting of PBS-0.05% Tween-20, Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche), 25 U/ml Benzonase (Sigma) and 1 KU/ml rLysozyme (Novagen). The lysates were incubated for 10 min at room temperature with shaking. A 20 μl fraction of the lysates was diluted 10 times in PBS-0.05% Tween-20 with 1% BSA. The diluted and undiluted lysates were all kept at −20° C. until analyzed in ELISA.\n\n\nAnti-CHIPS ELISA\n\n\nIn order to measure binding of CHIPS variants to affinity purified human anti-CHIPS\n31-113\n, Maxisorb 96 or 384 well plates (Nunc, Rochester, N.Y., USA) were coated overnight at 4° C. with 1 μg/ml mouse anti-CHIPS N-terminal mAb 2H7 (Haas JI, 2004) in PBS. Plates were washed three times with washing buffer (PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20) and blocked in blocking buffer (PBS-0.05% Tween-20 with 3% milk powder) for 1 hour at room temperature. Plates were washed as described above, followed by addition of lysates from CHIPS clones (diluted as described above) and incubation for 1 hour at room temperature. Plates were washed and then further incubated with 0.1 μg/ml affinity purified human anti-CHIPS\n31-113 \npolyclonal IgG in dilution buffer (PBS-0.05% Tween-20 with 1% milk powder) for 1 hour at room temperature. Plates were washed again and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with goat-anti-human IgG HRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, Pa., USA) diluted 1/10000 in dilution buffer. Plates were washed another three times and SuperSignal ELISA Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce) was added and luminescence was measured.\n\n\nExpression ELISA\n\n\nIn order to measure the expression level of CHIPS variants in \nE. coli \nlysates, ELISA was performed as described above, except 3 μg/ml in Ab 2H7 was used for coating and blocking buffer consisted of PBS-0.05% Tween-20 with 4% BSA and dilution buffer of PBS-0.05% Tween-20 with 1% BSA. Furthermore, 3 μg/ml of a polyclonal rabbit anti-CHIPS N-terminal IgG and goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (Southern Biotech) diluted 1/20000 were used for detection.\n\n\nInhibition ELISA\n\n\nIn order to measure the binding of CHIPS variants to affinity purified human anti-CHIPS\n31-113 \nin competition with the wt CHIPS protein, an inhibition ELISA was performed. The washing steps, blocking and dilutions were made as in the expression ELISA. 50 ng/ml purified wt CHIPS was used for coating. Then, 5-fold dilution series (0.16-2500 ng/ml) of the CHIPS variants were mixed in a Nunc polypropylene plate with 60 ng/ml affinity purified human anti-CHIPS\n31-113 \npolyclonal IgG and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. Then, 100 μl of the mixture was added to the ELISA plates and further incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. Detection was performed with goat-anti-human IgG HRP diluted 1/12000. OPD substrate was used as described above.\n\n\nPeptide ELISA\n\n\nIn order to measure the binding of CHIPS variants towards the C5aR 7-28 peptide described above, ELISA was performed as described for the expression ELISA, except 5 μg/ml Streptavidin (Sigma) was used for coating. Furthermore, the C5aR peptide was added to a final concentration of 0.3 μg/ml after washing and blocking the plates. CHIPS lysates were added in a xxx dilution. Detection was performed with 1 μg/ml mAb 2H7 and Rabbit anti-mouse IgG-HRP (Dako) diluted 1/2000. OPD substrate (1 tablet O-phenylenediamine in 35 ml; 34.7 mM Na-Citrate, 66.7 mM NaPO\n4\n, 0.01% H\n2\nO\n2\n) was added for detection. The reaction was stopped by addition of 1 M HCl and the absorbance was recorded at 492 nm.\n\n\nSee also above-described expression ELISA.\n\n\nCombination ELISA\n\n\nThe combination ELISA is a combination of the anti-CHIPS ELISA and the peptide ELISA. This ELISA was performed as described for the peptide ELISA with the following modifications. PBS-0.05% Tween-20 with 2% BSA was used for blocking and 0.1 μg/ml affinity purified human anti-CHIPS\n31-113 \npolyclonal IgG/goat-anti-human IgG HRP diluted 1/6000 were used for detection. SuperSignal ELISA Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce) was used as HRP substrate and luminescence was measured.\n\n\nSelection Strategy\n\n\nThe binding of mutants were always compared to the achieved binding of wt CHIPS to anti-CHIPS abs or the peptide (% binding were calculated). The best mutants from the primary screening were selected based on the following criteria:\n\n\n1. At least 80% binding to the peptide\n\n\n2. Less than 70% binding to the anti-CHIPS abs in the combination ELISA. 3% of wt binding in double ELISA/% binding in peptide ELISA should be 0.05-0.6\n\n\nThe selected clones were analysed in a secondary screening with expression ELISA and anti-CHIPS ELISA as described above.\n\n\nPreferred clones (exhibiting less than 40% binding to the anti-CHIPS abs) were further analysed in anti-CHIPS ELISA and inhibition ELISA. The best 42 clones based on above criteria was expressed and analysed for binding in cellular in vitro/vivo experiments. To express high concentrations of the CHIPS variants, a cell free expression system, Expressway Cell-Free \nE. coli \nExpression Kit (Invitrogen), was used. The expression was performed as described by the manufacturer. Briefly, 0.5 μg plasmid DNA was mixed in a microtiter plate with \nE. coli \nextract, reaction buffer, amino acids and T7 enzyme mix and incubated with shaking at 30° C. for 30 min. A feeding buffer with amino acids was added to the samples and they were further incubated at 30° C. for 5.5 hours. Plates were centrifuged and the supernatant containing the protein was kept at −20° C. until analyzed in an assay for binding to C5aR on U937/C5aR cells and for a binding assay for C5aR and SQL binding on neutrophils (naturally expressing C5aR and fMPL). These assays were run twice with in vitro expressed material and analysed separately ranking the clones for C5aR binding. The 10 best performing clones were selected for further analysis.\n\n\nBinding to U937/C5aR Cells\n\n\n7.5×10\n4 \nU937/C5aR cells in 25 μl RPMI/HAS was incubated with 25 μl CHIPS lysates on ice for 30 min. Cells were washed once with RPMI/HAS resuspended and incubated with 50 \nμl\n 5 μg/ml 2H7 Ab on ice for 30 min. Washed once resuspended and incubated with 50 \nμl\n 1/50 diluted goat-anti-mouse-RPE Ab on ice for 30 min. Washed once with RPMI/HAS and resuspended in 250 μl 0.5% Paraformaldehyde/RPMI/HAS and vortexed. Kept dark at 4° C.

These findings confirm the data from the screening process showing decreased binding of anti-CHIPS antibodies to the CHIPS mutants as compared to wild type.\n\n\nIn a series of further experiments, exemplary mutants from those identified above were modified to delete the thirty eleven amino acids from the N-terminus and the final one amino acid from the C-terminus. Thus, the modified mutants corresponded to amino acids 31 to 113 of SEQ ID NO: 1 in which the mutations identified in Table 14 are incorporated.\n\n\nThe inhibition of C5aR by the modified 31-113 mutants is shown in \nFIG. 28\n. Expression and purification of the F3.08, F3.39 and F3.50 mutants and subsequent analysis of their binding to C5aR, either expressed as a stably transfected protein in U937 cells or naturally on neutrophils, confirmed the screening data demonstrating retained binding properties.\n\n\nExample F\n\n\nSurface Accessibility and Closeness of CHIPS Amino Acids\n\n\nMaterials & Methods\n\n\nRSA values were determined as described in Amitai et al., 2004\n, J. Mol. Biol. \n344:1135-1146, using the NACCESS program (see also Hubbard, 1996, NACCESS, 2.1.1 edit., Biomolecular Structure and Modelling Unit, University College, London, UK).\n\n\nIn brief, the NACCESS program calculates the atomic accessible surface defined by rolling a probe of given size around a van der Waals surface. This program is an implementation of the method of Lee & Richards (1971) J. Mol. Biol 55, 379-400. The program is dimensioned for up to 20000 atoms, and allows the variation of the probe size and atomic radii by the user. The program outputs 3 files:\n\n\n(1) An atomic accessibility file (.asa file) containing the calculated accessible surface for each atom in a PDB file, as well as the assigned van der Waal radii.\n\n\n(2) A residue accessibility (.rsa) file containing summed atomic accessible surface areas over each protein or nucleic acid residue, as well as the relative accessibility of each residue calculated as the % accessibility compared to the accessibility of that residue type in an extended ALA-x-ALA tripeptide (for amino acids). See Hubbard, Campbell & Thornton (1991) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n220, 507-530.\n\n\n(3) A log file (.log) containing information concerning the calculation.\n\n\nRelative Surface Accessibility (RSA)\n\n\n\nThe Relative Surface Accessibility (RSA) of amino acids within the wildtype CHIPS protein is shown in Table 15.

No. 12/352,869, filed Jan. 13, 2009, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,709,522 B2, which claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. Section 119(e) of U.S. provisional application 61/039,121, filed Mar. 25, 2008, and claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. 119(b) of EP application No. 08380012.8, filed Jan. 22, 2008.\n\n\nEthanol use disorder is a significant and prevalent worldwide health problem and is a causal factor in serious medical conditions and behaviors, such as liver cirrhosis, liver cancer, coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, fetal alcohol syndrome, automobile accidents and fatalities, and domestic violence.\n\n\nEthanol dependence is a chronic relapsing disorder, and relapse represents a major challenge to treatment efforts. To date, there is no therapeutic intervention that has proven to be satisfactory in preventing relapse and sustaining abstinence. There is a need for new and more effective pharmacotherapeutics that will enable patients to better control their ethanol consumption as well as battle risks for relapse.\n\n\nThe current pharmacological standards for treatment of ethanol dependence in humans in the United States are naltrexone (an opioid antagonist), acamprosate (a functional glutamate antagonist) and disulfiram (an aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor). In combination with behavioral management, these agents are approved for maintaining abstinence. Although modest efficacy is observed with these treatments, they all suffer from compliance issues, at least in part, contributing to clinical unmet need. For instance, many patients diagnosed with ethanol dependence have concurrent symptoms of anxiety and/or depression, or schizophrenia. The current treatments described above do not provide benefit for these comorbid symptoms that may play a role in subsequent ethanol use disorder relapse. The present invention provides for such an agent that will enable the patient to abstain or reduce heavy ethanol drinking and alleviate concomitant symptoms of anxiety and/or depression or schizophrenia.\n\n\nNaltrexone is a mu receptor preferring opioid receptor antagonist having antagonist activity at each of the three opioid receptors, mu, kappa and delta. Clinically, naltrexone has demonstrated efficacy in maintaining ethanol abstinence and reducing ethanol craving. However, naltrexone may cause hepatotoxicity at doses exceeding 50 mg per day and appropriate monitoring is required. This hepatotoxicity is particularly concerning in a patient population with enhanced susceptibility to liver injury because of their ethanol use.\n\n\nDepending on the experimental conditions, selective activation of kappa opioid receptors have been shown to either increase or decrease consumption of ethanol; the discrepancies in the literature may be related to additional pharmacological effects (e.g., dysphoria and cognitive disruption) of kappa agonists. On the other hand, selective pharmacological kappa receptor antagonism or genetic deletion of kappa receptors have been shown to decrease ethanol self-administration in animal models of alcoholism. This suggests a pharmaceutical agent that is a selective antagonist for the kappa versus mu and delta opioid receptors could fill a significant need in ethanol use disorder therapy.\n\n\nThere is a need for a pharmaceutical agent in ethanol use disorder therapy that evidences kappa opioid receptor antagonist selectivity. There is also a need for a pharmaceutical agent that will improve outcomes in one or more of: number of days abstinent on a per month basis; number of heavy drinking days on a per month basis; and number of drinks per drinking day over a one month basis. There is a further need in ethanol use disorder therapy for an agent that will demonstrate efficacy for one or both of anxiety and depression or schizophrenia that are frequently independent comorbid conditions in patients with ethanol use disorder.\n\n\nOpioid receptor antagonists, such as those compounds in WO 2004/026305, have been disclosed.\n\n\nThe compound disclosed herein is a kappa opioid receptor antagonist. This compound's properties make it suitable as a therapeutic agent for facilitating ethanol use disorder withdrawal such as reducing the quantity of ethanol used at each drinking session over a defined time period; reducing the frequency of ethanol use days over a defined time period; maintaining diminished quantity and/or frequency of use over a defined time period; or abstinence from ethanol consumption over a defined time period. The compounds' properties as shown in small animal models make it suitable to treat anxiety and/or depression or schizophrenia disorders in patients having said disorder, or as an independent comorbid disorder in patients also having ethanol use disorder.\n\n\nOne aspect of the present invention provides:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n

Similarly, mice lacking the gene that produces the kappa opioid receptor or the endogenous ligand precursor preprodynorphin, drink significantly less alcohol than do wild-type mice (Kovacs et al., Alcohol: Clin & Exp. Res. 2005, 29: 730-739; Blednov et al., Alcohol 2006, 40: 73-86).\n\n\nIt has been established that there is a relationship between ethanol use disorder and anxiety and/or depression disorders, as independent comorbid conditions, in the same patients. \nArch. Gen. Psychiatry, \n61, 807-816 (2004). This association points to the desirability of treating both the ethanol use disorder and the independent comorbid anxiety and/or depression disorders in patients with a single active pharmaceutical agent. It has also been established that there is a relationship between ethanol use disorder and schizophrenia, as independent comorbid conditions in the same patients. Gregg et al., \nClinical Psychology Review, \n27, 494-510 (2007). This association points to the desirability of treating both the ethanol use disorder and the independent comorbid schizophrenia in patients with a single active pharmaceutical agent.\n\n\nEthanol use disorder is a cluster of cognitive, behavioral and physiological symptoms demonstrating there is a continuing use of the substance despite significant use-related problems. There is a pattern of repeated self-administration that results in tolerance, withdrawal and compulsive substance-taking behavior. The problems related to ethanol use disorder are varied. There may be repeated failure to fulfill major role obligations, repeated use in situations in which it is physically hazardous, multiple legal problems, and recurrent social and interpersonal problems. These problems occur repeatedly during the same 12-month period.\n\n\nTolerance is the need for increased amounts of ethanol to achieve the desired effect, or a diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of ethanol.\n\n\nGenerally, withdrawal is a behavioral change, having physiological and cognitive components, that occurs when blood or tissue concentrations of ethanol decline in an individual who had maintained prolonged heavy use of ethanol. After developing withdrawal symptoms, an individual is likely to consume ethanol to relieve or avoid those symptoms.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “patient” means mammal; “mammal” means the Mammalia class of higher vertebrates; and the term “mammal” includes, but is not limited to, a human.\n\n\nEthanol use disorder includes ethanol abuse and ethanol dependence; the term dependence denotes a psychological and/or physiological manifestation of the dependence to ethanol. In particular, the term “ethanol use disorders” includes withdrawal disorders such as ethanol withdrawal with or without perceptual disturbances and ethanol withdrawal delirium. See DSM-IV-TR., Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Revised, 4\nth \nEd., Text Revision (2000). Also, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, (ICD-10) and updates provides classification for many of the disorders described herein. The skilled artisan will recognize that there are alternative nomenclatures and classification systems for the disorders described herein and those described in the DMS-IV-TR and ICD-10, and that terminology and classification systems evolve with medical scientific progress.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “therapeutically effective amount” is synonymous with “therapeutically effective dose” and means an amount of the compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt that is sufficient in one or more administrations for treating ethanol use disorders, an anxiety disorder as described above, a depressive illness as described above, a combination of ethanol use disorder and one or both of an anxiety disorder and a depressive illness, schizophrenia, or a combination of ethanol use disorder and schizophrenia.\n\n\nThe term “treatment” and “treating” as used herein means the management and care of a patient for the purpose of diminishing or discontinuing self-administration and use of ethanol. The term is intended to include the full spectrum of intervention for the ethanol use disorder from which the patient is suffering, such as administration of the active compound to alleviate the symptoms or complications, to delay progression of the ethanol use disorder and to reduce the quantity of ethanol consumed per drinking day on a one month basis or heavy use days on a per month basis, or both. The management and care of a patient for the purpose of combating ethanol use disorder includes the administration of the active compound to inhibit the physiological or psychological onset of symptoms for resumption of use, continued use or enhanced use. The patient to be treated is preferably a mammal, in particular a human being. The term “treatment” and “treating” as used herein also means the management and care of a patient for an anxiety disorder selected from panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobia and post-traumatic stress disorder; a depressive illness selected from major depression, dysthymia and bipolar disorder; or both; schizophrenia, and may further include ethanol use disorder in said patient.\n\n\nThe term is intended to include the full spectrum of intervention for the disorders from which the patient is suffering, such as administration of the active compound to alleviate the symptoms or complications, and to delay progression of the disorder. The patient to be treated is preferably a mammal, in particular a human being.\n\n\nThe spectrum of ethanol use ranges from none (abstinence) to low-risk use; then unhealthy use (excessive) which encompasses risky use and problem use; to ethanol use disorders which include ethanol abuse and ethanol dependence. Ethanol consumption is excessive when it causes or elevates the risk for ethanol related problems or complicates the management of other health problems. It should be appreciated that increasingly heavier drinking (heavy drinking days per month, amount consumed per drinking day over a month, or both) correlates with increasing adverse consequences to the patient and higher thresholds along the spectrum of ethanol use until the pattern reaches definitive stages of ethanol disease states (ethanol abuse and ethanol dependence). In the United States, men who drink five or more standard drinks in a day (or fifteen or more per week) and women who drink four or more in a day (or eight or more per week) are at risk for ethanol-related problems (i.e. risky use). In Europe, men who drink 4 units (32 g) per day and women who drink 3 units (24 g) per day are at risk for ethanol related problems (risky use). Individual responses to ethanol vary, however, and ethanol consumption at a risky use level may be a problem requiring treatment depending on many factors, such as age, co-existing conditions, and medication use.\n\n\nA standard drink in the United States is any drink that contains about fourteen grams of pure ethanol (about 0.6 fluid ounces or 1.2 tablespoons). Standard drink equivalents are: 12 oz. of beer or cooler; 8-9 oz. of malt liquor; 5 oz. of table wine; 3-4 oz. of fortified wine (such as sherry or port); 2-3 oz. of cordial, liqueur or aperitif; 1.5 oz of brandy (a single jigger); and 1.5 oz. of spirits (a single jigger of 80-proof gin, vodka, whiskey, etc.). These are approximate, as different brands and types of beverages vary in their actual ethanol content. In Europe, one unit is a standard drink and comprises one-half pint of ordinary strength beer; a single measure of spirits; and a standard glass of wine. As with the United States measures, these are approximate as different brands and types of beverages vary in their actual ethanol content.\n\n\nPharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compound of the present invention and common methodology for preparing them are well known in the art. See, e.g., P. Stahl, et al., \nHandbook of Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection and Use\n, (VCHA/Wiley-VCH, 2002); S. M. Berge, et al., “Pharmaceutical Salts,” \nJournal of Pharmaceutical Sciences\n, Vol. 66, No. 1, January 1977.\n\n\nThe term “formulation”, as in pharmaceutical formulation, or “pharmaceutical composition” is intended to encompass a product comprising (S)-3-fluoro-4-[4-[2-(3,5-dimethylphenyl)pyrrolidin-1-yl-methyl]phenoxy]benzamide, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or in admixture with its enantiomer, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and the inert ingredient(s) that make up the carrier. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical formulations encompass any composition made by admixing (S)-3-fluoro-4-[4-[2-(3,5-dimethylphenyl)pyrrolidin-1-yl-methyl]phenoxy]benzamide, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, alone or in admixture with its enantiomer, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and a pharmaceutical carrier, diluent and/or excipient.\n\n\nCompositions of the present invention comprising a therapeutically effective amount of (S)-3-fluoro-4-[4-[2-(3,5-dimethylphenyl)pyrrolidin-1-yl-methyl]phenoxy]benzamide, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and a therapeutically effective amount of a tertiary amine tricyclic norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor selected from amitriptyline, clomipramine, doxepin, imipramine and (+)-trimipramine, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof can conveniently be administered in a pharmaceutical composition containing the active components in combination with a suitable (pharmaceutically acceptable) carrier, diluent and/or excipient. Such pharmaceutical compositions can be prepared by methods and contain a carrier, diluent and/or excipients which are well known in the art. A generally recognized compendium of such methods and ingredients is Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy Mack Publishing Co., 19\nth \nEd., 1995). The compositions can be administered parenterally (for example, by intravenous) or orally. The amount of active compound in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that an effective dosage level will be afforded for each active ingredient.\n\n\nIt will be understood the compound of the present invention exists as a stereoisomer. As used herein, references to the compound of the present invention are meant to also include racemic mixtures thereof. Herein, the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog designations of (R)- and (S)- are used to refer to specific isomers. Specific stereoisomers can be prepared by stereospecific synthesis using enantiomerically pure or enriched starting materials. The specific stereoisomers of either starting materials or compounds can be resolved by techniques well known in the art, such as those found in \nStereochemistry of Organic Compounds\n, E. I. Eliel and S. H. Wilen (Wiley 1994) and \nEnantiomers, Racemates, and Resolutions\n, J., Jacques, A. Collet, and S. H. Wilen (Wiley 1991), including chromatography on chiral stationary phases, enzymatic resolutions, or fractional crystallization or chromatography of diastereomers formed for that purpose, such as diastereomeric salts. Where a chiral compound is resolved into its isomers, but absolute configurations or optical rotations are not determined, the isomers are arbitrarily designated as isomer 1, isomer 2, etc. While all mixtures containing the compound of the present invention are contemplated within the present invention, the preferred embodiment is a single enantiomer.\n\n\nThe compounds employed as initial starting materials in the synthesis of the compound of the present invention are well known and, to the extent not commercially available, are readily synthesized using specific references provided, by standard procedures commonly employed by those of ordinary skill in the art or are found in general reference texts.\n\n\nExamples of known procedures and methods include those described in general reference texts such as Comprehensive Organic Transformations, VCH Publishers Inc, 1989; Compendium of Organic Synthetic Methods, Volumes 1-10, 1974-2002, Wiley Interscience; Advanced Organic Chemistry, Reactions Mechanisms, and Structure, 5\nth \nEdition, Michael B.

Purity (%) by LC/MS: 99%, ee(%) 98%; MS (EIC): (M+1) 419.\n\n\nThe absolute configuration of Isomer 1 (Example 1A) and Isomer 2 (Example 1B) are determined to be, respectively, (S) and (R), using the well known Mosher method. Generally, this method involves derivatization of a chiral substrate with the two enantiomers of the chiral reagent alpha-methoxy-alpha(trifluoromethyl)phenyl acetic acid (MTPA), followed by the comparative analysis of the \n1\nH NMR spectra of the resulting diastereomers. It is also possible to determine absolute configuration of 2-phenylpyrrolidines by the multiplicity of the H2 signal. If the configuration of the MTPA moiety in the Mosher's amide is (R) and the H2 signal is a doublet of doublets (one of the couplings is roughly twice the other) the absolute configuration of the amine under examination is (S). If this signal is an apparent triplet (both couplings are similar) the absolute configuration is (R). Conversely, if the configuration of the MTPA auxiliary is (S), H2 appears as a triplet in the (S)-2-phenylpyrrolidine and as a doublet of doublets in the (R)-2-phenylpyrrolidine. Further, details are available in P. Vidal, et al., \nOrganic Letters, \n9 (21), 4123-4126 (2007).\n\n\nAs described above, a racemic mixture of enantiomers is prepared and separated into Examples 1A and 1B by chiral chromatography. A preferred method of preparing Example 1A is enantioselective synthesis using enantiomerically pure 2-(3,5-dimethylphenyl)pyrrolidine and substantially following the procedures described above in Example 1, Part 1.\n\n\nAs noted above, the compound of Example 1A, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, is a selective antagonist, or in selectively blocking the effect of agonists, at the kappa opioid receptor. Features of the compound of Example 1A are one or more of its structural features and biological properties afforded by those features including kappa receptor selectivity (binding affinity), kappa receptor activity (antagonist potency), efficacy at reducing ethanol intake in small animal models, bioavailability in small animal models and tolerability regarding undesirable side effects in small animal models. In addition, the compound of Example 1A evidences anxiolytic, antidepressant and antipsychotic activity in small animal model assays.\n\n\nAs used herein, kappa opioid receptor selectivity means in vitro binding affinity at the kappa receptor of less than 1 nM and more particularly less than or equal to 0.6 nM.\n\n\nIn contrast, in vitro binding affinity at the mu and delta opioid receptors are greater than 5 nM and generally greater than 8 nM.\n\n\nAlso, as used herein, selective kappa opioid receptor antagonist potency means in vitro competitive binding displacement of a known agonist at less than 6 nM and more particularly less than 3 nM.\n\n\nIn contrast, in vitro competitive binding displacement of known mu and delta receptor agonists is greater than 15 nM and generally greater than 20 nM.\n\n\nThe compound of the present invention is described as a selective kappa opioid receptor antagonist. This description is intended to include both “neutral antagonist” and “inverse agonist” within its scope. A “neutral antagonist” is a reversible receptor ligand without intrinsic activity. It does not influence the receptor's own basal activity (constitutive receptor activity) and prevents binding, in a competitive manner, of an agonist (endogenous or non-endogenous) to the receptor. An “inverse agonist” is a ligand with negative intrinsic activity. It inhibits the receptor's own activity (constitutive receptor activity) by shifting the equilibrium of the receptor conformation to its inactive state and inhibits binding of an agonist to the receptor. In a high constitutive receptor activity environment, an inverse agonist will differentiate itself from a neutral antagonist.\n\n\nThe compound of Example 1A or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is effective over a wide dosage range in the treatment of ethanol use disorders and in treating independent comorbid anxiety and/or depression or schizophrenia that may also be present. For example, dosages per day will normally fall within the range of about 0.05 to about 50 mg/kg of body weight. In the treatment of adult humans, the range of about 0.5 to about 50 mg/kg, in single or divided doses, is typical. However, it will be understood that the amount of the compound actually administered will be determined by a physician in light of the relevant circumstances, including the condition or comorbid conditions to be treated, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, the severity of the patient's symptoms, and the chosen route of administration, and therefore the above dosage ranges are not intended to limit the scope. It should also be understood that the amount of compound administered should be within a dose range that affords selective central kappa receptor occupancy and does not appreciably block mu or delta opioid, or other, receptors. The compound may be administered by a variety of routes such as oral, transdermal, subcutaneous, sublingual, intranasal, intramuscular or intravenous routes.\n\n\nAs is well known, the dosage of each component in a two component medicament depends on several factors such as the potency of the selected specific compound, the mode of administration, the age and weight of the patient, the severity of the condition to be treated, and the like. This is considered to be within the skill of the artisan and one can review the existing literature to determine optimal dosing for the tertiary amine tricyclic norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor component.\n\n\nThe average daily adult dosage of the norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBroad Dose\n\n\nUsual Dose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nmg/day\n\n\nmg/day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\namitriptyline\n\n\n25-300\n\n\n100-200\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nclomipramine\n\n\n25-250\n\n\n100-200\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ndoxepin\n\n\n25-300\n\n\n100-200\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nimipramine\n\n\n25-300\n\n\n100-200\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(+)-trimipramine\n\n\n25-300\n\n\n 75-200\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThose compositions, containing two active components, may be administered in the same physical form or concomitantly according to the above described dosages. The dosages for each active component can be measured separately and can be given as a single combined dose or given separately. They may be given at the same or at different times as long as both actives are in the patient at one time over a 24-hour period. Concomitant or concurrent administration means the patient takes one drug within about 5 minutes of taking the other drug. Because the goal is to provide rapid symptomatic relief to the patient, in most cases when treatment is started the two drugs would be administered to the patient close in time and typically concomitantly; thereafter, the timing of each drug's administration may be adjusted so long as both agents are active in the patient at the same time over a 24-hour period.\n\n\nThe criteria for ethanol dependence set forth in DSM-IV-TR is a pattern of ethanol use, leading to clinically significant impairment or distress as manifested by at least three selected from the following group, occurring at any time within the same twelve month period: (1) tolerance as defined by either (a) a need for substantially increased amounts of ethanol to achieve intoxication or the desired effect; or (b) substantially diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of ethanol; (2) withdrawal, as demonstrated by either (a) the characteristic withdrawal syndrome for ethanol; or (b) the same, or a closely related substance is taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms; (3) ethanol is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period then was intended; (4) there is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control ethanol use; (5) a great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain ethanol, use ethanol, or recover from its effects; (6) important social, occupational or recreational activities are given up or reduced because of ethanol use; and (7) ethanol use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by ethanol.\n\n\nEthanol dependence can be with physiological dependence; that is evidence of tolerance or withdrawal is present, or without physiological dependence, where no evidence of tolerance or withdrawal is present. However, it should be understood that so-called “psychological dependence” may be the result of a protracted withdrawal where physical symptoms are not readily detected and often manifested as psychological complaints such as dysphoria or anhedonia.\n\n\nThe essential feature of ethanol abuse is a maladaptive pattern of ethanol use manifested by recurrent and significant adverse consequences related to the repeated use of ethanol. In order for an abuse criterion to be met, the ethanol-related problem must have occurred repeatedly during the same 12-month period or been persistent. There may be repeated failure to fulfill major role obligations, repeated use in situations in which it is physically hazardous, multiple legal problems, and recurrent social and interpersonal problems. Unlike the criteria for ethanol dependence, the criteria for ethanol abuse do not include tolerance, withdrawal, or a pattern of compulsive use and instead include only the harmful consequences of repeated use. A diagnosis of ethanol abuse is preempted by the diagnosis of ethanol dependence if the individual's pattern of ethanol use has ever met the criteria for dependence.\n\n\nFurther information and details regard ethanol use disorder that is treated by the present compound, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, is found in DSM-IV-TR.\n\n\nThe independent comorbid anxiety disorders treated by the present compound, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, are selected from panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobia, and posttraumatic stress disorder. These disorders may be treated alone or concomitantly with ethanol use disorder in a patient. The particular anxiety disorders contemplated as treatable comorbid conditions are as defined in DSM IV TR, and described in United States Department of Health and Human Services, National Institute of Mental Health, NIH Publication No. 06-3879.\n\n\nFurther information and details regarding the anxiety disorders described above and treated by the present compound, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, are found in DSM-IV-TR.\n\n\nThe independent comorbid depression illnesses treated by the present compound, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, are selected from major depression, dysthymia and bipolar disorder.

This disorder may be treated alone or concomitantly with ethanol use disorder in a patient. The schizophrenia contemplated as a treatable comorbid condition by the present invention is as defined in DSM IV TR.\n\n\nFurther information and details regarding schizophrenia treated by the present compound, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, are found in DSM-IV-TR.\n\n\nAs previously noted, an anxiety disorder, as described above, a depression illness, as described above, and ethanol use disorder may be simultaneously treated by the compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; or schizophrenia as described above, and ethanol use disorder may be simultaneously treated by the compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\n\n\nThe compound of Example 1A is preferably administered in connection with and/or subsequent to an educational and/or behavioral modification program to enhance diminution in frequency and/or quantity of use or abstinence from ethanol. The programs may be more effective by focusing on educational and behavioral modification goals, reducing the incidence of program non-completion.\n\n\nAs noted above, the compound of Example 1A is a kappa opioid receptor selective antagonist. The selectivity is demonstrated in both in vitro and in vivo assays. All ex vivo and in vivo experiments are performed according to the policies of the Animal Care and Use Committee of Eli Lilly and Company, in compliance with the American Association for the Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care-approved guidelines.\n\n\nKappa Affinity In Vitro\n\n\nGTP-γ-S Binding Assay\n\n\nA scintillation proximity assay (SPA)-based GTP-γ-S\n35 \nassay format is carried out substantially in accordance with (Emmerson et al., \nJ. Pharm Exp Ther. \n278,1121 (1996); Horng et al., \nSociety for Neuroscience Abstracts, \n434.6 (2000) and (DeLapp et al., \nJPET \n289, 946 (1999) assay formats. Membranes are re-suspended in 20 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl\n2\n, 1 mM DTT, and 1 mM EDTA. Fifty μL of GTP-γ-[\n35\nS], compound, membrane suspension (20 microgram/well), and wheat germ agglutinin coated SPA beads (WGA PVT SPA, GE Healthcare, 800 Centennial Avenue, Piscataway, N.J. 08854) (1 mg/well) are added to clear bottom 96 well assay plates. GDP (200 μM to achieve a 50 μM final concentration per well) is added to the membrane solution prior to addition to the assay plates. Plates are sealed and incubated for four hours at room temperature then placed in a refrigerator overnight to allow the beads to settle. Signal stability at 4° C. is determined to be >60 hours. Plates are warmed to room temperature and counted in a Wallac MicroBeta® scintillation counter (Perkin Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences, 549 Albany Street, Boston, Mass. 02118 USA. For antagonist assays, specific agonists are added at the following concentrations: mu-opioid receptor (MOR) DAMGO ([D-Ala\n2\n, N-Me-Phe\n4\n, Gly\n5\n-ol]-Enkephalin, Sigma-Aldrich catalog number E7384) 1 micromolar; delta-opioid receptor (DOR) DPDPE ((D-Pen\n2\n, D-Pen\n5\n)-Enkephalin, Bachem Catalog number H-2905) 30 nM; and kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) U69593 ((+)-(5α,7α,8β)-N-Methyl-N-[7-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-1-oxaspiro[4.5]dec-8-yl]-benzeneacetamide, Sigma-Aldrich Catalog number U103) 300 nM.

In this assay, microdoses of naltrexone (10 μg/kg) ((5α)-17-(Cyclopropylmethyl)-4,5-epoxy-3,14-dihydromorphinan-6-one), naltriben (10 μg/kg) (17-(Cyclopropylmethyl)-6,7-didehydro-3,14b -dihydroxy-4,5α-epoxy-5,7-2′,3′-benzo[b]furanomorphinan) and GR103545 ([(−)-(R)-Methyl 4-[(3,4-dichlorophenyl)acetyl]-3-1[(1-pyrrolidinyl)methyl]-1-piperazinecarboxylate) (1.5 μg/kg) are simultaneously administered intravenously in a single injection and used as RO tracers for mu, delta and kappa receptors, respectively. Administration of the three tracers permits one to understand the relative selectivity of the opioid receptor subtypes occupied and the degree of receptor occupancy that occurs at any specific subtype at efficacy. In RO, the distribution of the tracer in various brain regions is measured by LC/MS/MS (API 4000, MDS Sciex) providing a nonradioactive method for detecting the amounts of tracer in brain with high sensitivity. Receptor occupancy is then calculated as the difference in specific accumulation of tracer in animals treated with a compound of the present invention versus animals treated with vehicle alone. In this method the striatum (a region of high mu, delta and kappa opioid receptor density) is taken for specific tracer accumulation while the cerebellum (a brain region devoid of opioid receptors) represents nonspecific tracer accumulation. Receptor occupancy is determined 90 minutes following a single oral dose of a compound of the present invention or 5.5 hrs following administration for dose-response evaluation. Data represent the mean±SEM of receptor occupancy in 3-6 rats per dose group with each rat weighing approximately 230 g.\n\n\nMale Harlan Sprague Dawley rats are treated with the compound of Example 1A of the present invention using a 3% lactic acid/water oral formulation at doses of 0.03, 0.01, 0.3, 1, 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg. The test animals exhibited a dose-dependent level of kappa receptor occupancy in the striatum 5.5 hrs following oral administration. The calculated ED50 for kappa receptor occupancy of the compound of Example 1A of the present invention was 0.45 mg/kg. Consistent with the in vitro binding data, the compound of Example 1A of the present invention displayed high selectivity for the kappa opioid receptor in vivo, producing no significant occupancy of either mu or delta (measured in the striatum) receptors at doses up to 30 mg/kg meaning the ED50 at those receptors is greater than 30 mg/kg. The increasing levels of kappa receptor occupancy are driven by roughly proportional increases in plasma and brain exposure of the compound of Example 1A of the present invention up to a dose of 30 mg/kg. These data support that following oral administration the compound of Example 1A selectively binds to kappa opioid receptors in the rat brain with high potency.\n\n\nExposure levels of the compound of Example 1A in the rat striatum following administration were determined in the same samples used to quantify the level of opioid receptor occupancy. Levels of Example 1A are detected by LC/MS/MS (API 4000, MDS Sciex) and quantified from a standard curve of Example 1A prepared in rat brain homogenate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrain Levels\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 1A\n\n\nExample 1A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\noral dose\n\n\nng/g tissue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nmg/kg\n\n\n \n\n\nSEM\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n30\n\n\n265.67\n\n\n46.25\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n10\n\n\n171.47\n\n\n78.53\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n39.20\n\n\n8.67\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n19.63\n\n\n11.05\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n.3\n\n\n7.23\n\n\n0.42\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n.1\n\n\n15.30\n\n\n7.29\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlasma exposure of Example 1A of the present invention in the rat following administration is determined from plasma isolated from trunk blood collected at the time of tissue collection for receptor occupancy.

Compounds are solubilized in sterile water by the dropwise addition of 85% lactic acid. Unless otherwise stated, compounds are administered p.o. prior to the onset of the dark cycle using a counterbalanced, within-subject design (n=8-11 per experiment).\n\n\nExperimental Procedure\n\n\nFollowing a 4-day acclimation to the colony, rats receive homecage access to a bottle of EtOH (10% v/v; Ancare, Bellmore, N.Y.) in addition to the standard bottle of water. Access to water and 10% EtOH, as well as standard laboratory chow, are freely available. Once rats reach a stable level of daily intake, the EtOH solution is increased to 15% v/v. Consumption of EtOH and water are monitored for approximately 6-9 months prior to drug testing. Food and fluid intake are measured via force transduction with a PC-controlled Drinking & Feeding Monitoring System (TSE Systems, Bad Homburg, Germany). Consumption of food, water, and 15% (v/v) EtOH are continuously monitored for 12 hrs following drug or vehicle administration. For some experiments, continuous monitoring for 24 hours is carried out.\n\n\nAt 1 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg administered orally, the compound of Example 1A decreased the amount of ethanol consumed (p<0.05 versus vehicle).\n\n\nP Rat Progressive Ratio Responding for Ethanol\n\n\nThis test assesses the motivation to work for access to ethanol in P rats following ethanol abstinence. This animal model simulates ethanol craving.\n\n\nFemale P rats (Indiana University Medical Center, Indianapolis, Ind., USA) are pair-housed in an environmentally controlled facility and maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle (lights on at 0600 hours).\n\n\nCompounds are solubilized in sterile water by the dropwise addition of 85% lactic acid, mixed freshly prior to use, and administered in a volume of 1 mL/kg. Unless otherwise stated, compounds are administered p.o. 60 min prior to the experimental session. Doses are assigned using a counterbalanced, within-subject design (n=8-11 per experiment).\n\n\nIn order to reduce novelty-induced avoidance of ethanol (EtOH), the water bottle on the homecage is replaced with a bottle containing 15% EtOH (v/v; Ancare, Bellmore, N.Y.) for two days prior to operant training. Throughout the rest of the experiment, rats are allowed ad libitum access to water and standard laboratory chow in the homecage.\n\n\nDaily 60-min sessions are conducted in standard rat operant chambers, housed within sound-attenuating chambers (MED Associates, Inc., St. Albans, Vt., USA). The 0.5 cm diameter stainless steel bars of the floor grid of the operant chambers are positioned approximately 1.5 cm apart. Two retractable operant levers in each operant chamber are located approximately 15 cm above the grid floor and 13 cm apart. A recessed trough is located in the space between the levers, through which a dipper cup (0.1 mL capacity) is raised to deliver response-contingent ethanol (15% EtOH, v/v). Upon a reinforced response, a stimulus light is illuminated during the 4-sec dipper cup access. Operation of the stimuli and behavioral responses are controlled and recorded by personal computer for offline analysis. At the end of each session, all stimuli are turned off and levers are retracted.\n\n\nRats are trained to press a lever for EtOH reinforcement. Initially, responses on either lever are considered correct responses and are rewarded with reinforcement. Access to the reinforcement is signaled by illuminating a stimulus light above the lever on which the response is made. Once rats learn to press a lever to obtain EtOH reward, the response contingency is changed so that responses made on one lever (active lever) are reinforced, using a fixed-ratio (FR)-1 schedule of reinforcement, while responses on the other (inactive) lever are not reinforced. Over a period of 3-4 weeks, the response contingency is increased to FR-3, such that 3 lever presses are required for each reinforcement. Once a stable level of responding is reached, the response contingency is changed to a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement. For this procedure, the response requirement is slowly increased throughout the experimental session such that rats work progressively harder to receive the EtOH reward. Specifically, the response requirement is increased as follows: all rats begin at an FR-1 schedule of reinforcement; after three reinforcements, the schedule is increased to FR-2; after three reinforcements at that level, the schedule is increased to FR-4; after three reinforcements at FR-4, the schedule is increased to FR-6; and so on. Each session is scheduled to last a total of 60 min. The amount of EtOH that is consumed (in mL and g/kg) is recorded, as well as the number of responses on the active and inactive levers, and the breakpoint, which is defined as the highest FR value reached during the session.\n\n\nThe compound of Example 1A is administered p.o. 60 min. prior to testing at 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg. The number of active lever responses is reduced following administration of 10 mg/kg (p<0.05 versus vehicle). The quantity of ethanol consumed and the breakpoint are also reduced at the 10 mg/kg dose (p<0.05 versus vehicle). The data evidences a reduction in motivation to work for access to ethanol despite their extensive operant history for ethanol.\n\n\nStress-Induced Hyperthermia (in Rat)\n\n\nHyperthermia is a general phenomenon that has been reliably demonstrated in many species in response to stress, and is a component of the well-characterized fight-or-flight response. This test evaluates a test compound as a measure of its anxiolytic effects. The conventional and minimally-invasive method for analyzing stress-induced hyperthermia is by measuring body temperature, and stress-induced increases in body temperature, via rectal thermometer. This procedure entails dosing the animals prior to measuring the baseline body temperature reading (baseline temperature, T1). The handling by the experimenter and insertion of the rectal probe produce a moderate increase in body temperature that peaks within 10-15 minutes. A second body temperature measurement (T2) is recorded 10 minutes after the first measurement. The change in body temperature (T2 minus T1) is defined as the stress-induced hyperthermic response.\n\n\nMale Fischer F-344 rats (Harlan, Indianapolis, Ind., USA) weighing between 275-350 g are tested. All animals are individually-housed with food and automated water available ad libitum, and maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle (lights on at 06:00). On the day prior to each experiment, food is removed from home cages of rats designated for test, so that the animals are fasted for approximately 12-18 hours before the experiment. Rats are transported from the colony room in groups of n=10, to a procedure room for dosing. Rats are dosed po in a dose volume of 1 mL/kg with test compounds in the range of 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg dissolved in sterile water with the dropwise addition of 85% lactic acid. A solution of the metabotropic glutamate subtype 5 (mGlu5) antagonist 3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)thynyl]pyridine (MTEP) (10 mg/kg) dissolved in water is used as a positive control. Immediately following dosing, rats are returned to their home cage, and the experimenter turns off the lights and leaves the room. The dosing room (Room A) is darkened for the remainder of the 60 min pretreatment period.\n\n\nAfter the pretreatment period, rats are taken individually to a brightly lit adjacent room (Room B) where baseline body temperatures are determined by insertion of the rectal probe lubricated with mineral oil. Body temperature is assessed using a Physitemp® BAT-12® Microprobe Thermometer with a Physitemp® RET-2® rat rectal probe (Physitemp Instruments Inc., 154 Huron Ave. Clifton, N.J. 07013). The probe is inserted approximately 2 cm into the rectum. The core body temperature is measured (this is the baseline body temperature, T1, in degrees C.). The rat is then placed back in the homecage, and remains in Room B. Ten minutes later a second body temperature measurement is recorded (T2). The difference between the first and second body temperature measurements (T2−T1) is used as an index of stress-induced hyperthermia.\n\n\nA second study evaluating a combination of the compound of Example 1A dosed together with a sub-threshold dose of chlordiazepoxide (CDP) is carried out.\n\n\nFor the drug combination study, Example 1A (1, 3, and 10 mg/kg, po, 60 min pretreatment) is dosed together with chlordiazepoxide 1 mg/kg, po, water vehicle), and 1 mg/kg chlordiazepoide alone is used as the positive control.\n\n\nStudy 1. The compound of Example 1A is administered p.o. 60 min. prior to measurement of baseline core body temperature at 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg. The compound produces a dose-dependent, but non-significant, reduction in stress-induced hyperthermia (T2−T1). Importantly, baseline core body temperature is not affected. The positive control compound significantly reduces stress-induced hyperthermia (p<0.05), without affecting baseline body temperatures.\n\n\nStudy 2. The compound of Example 1A is administered p.o. at 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg, together with 1 mg/kg chlordiazepoxide, 60 min. prior to measurement of baseline core body temperature. Separate groups receive either 10 mg/kg Example 1A alone or 1 mg/kg chlordiazepoxide alone (p.o., 60 min prior to baseline body temperature). The compound of Example 1A increases the efficacy of a sub-threshold dose of chlordiazepoxide to produce a significant reduction in stress-induced hyperthermia (p<0.05). Importantly, baseline core body temperature is not affected.\n\n\nStudy 1. Compound of Example 1A alone: Vehicle=0.98±0.10; 1 mg/kg Example 1A=0.84±0.07, 3 mg/kg Example 1A=0.80±0.10; 10 mg/kg Example 1A=0.75±0.11; MTEP control=0.42±0.09.\n\n\nStudy 2. Compound of Example 1A and chlordiazepoxide: Vehicle=0.86±0.06; 1 mg/kg CDP alone=0.75±0.06; 10 mg/kg Example 1A alone=0.74±0.04; 1 mg/kg Example 1A and CDP=0.68±0.06; 3 mg/kg Example 1A and CDP=0.70±0.07; 10 mg/kg Example 1A and CDP=0.57±0.07.\n\n\nThe data from Studies 1 and 2 evidence the compound of Example 1A, alone, has a modest anxiolytic effect. However, in combination with a benzodiazepine, a more robust anxiolytic effect is seen with the compound of Example 1A at lower doses. These data suggest the use of the compound of Example 1A alone, or as an adjunctive treatment with a benzodiazepine anxiolytic agent for anxiety disorders.\n\n\nMouse Forced Swim Test\n\n\nThis test evaluates the effect of test compound on mice mobility as a measure of antidepressant effect. The less immobility compared to vehicle, the more pronounced the antidepressant-like effect.\n\n\nMale, NIH-Swiss mice (25-30 g) (Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Indianapolis, Ind., USA) are housed in a vivarium for at least one week prior to use with water and rodent chow freely available during this acclimation period. Animals are removed from the vivarium to the testing area in their home cages and allowed to adapt to the new environment for at least one hour before testing.\n\n\nMice are placed in clear plastic cylinders (diameter: 10 cm; height: 25 cm) filled with 6 cm of water (22-25° C.) for six minutes. The duration of immobility during the last four minutes of the six minutes test period is scored. A mouse is recorded as immobile when floating motionless or making only those movements necessary to keep its head above water.\n\n\nThe test compound is administered p.o. 1 hour prior to testing at 1.0 mg/kg, 3.0 mg/kg and 10.0 mg/kg, n of 8 per group in a vehicle of 5 ml of sterile water and 30 ml of diluted (10×) lactic acid. Imipramine is evaluated as a positive control, 15 mg/kg: p, 30 min. prior to testing n of 4. At 10.0 mg/kg, the compound of Example 1A demonstrates antidepressant-like activity (p<0.05 versus vehicle, Dunnett's test).\n\n\nA second study is carried out evaluating 1 and 3 mg/kg doses of the compound of Example 1A alone and in combination with 5 mg/kg of imipramine. Imipramine alone is evaluated at 5 and 15 mg/kg doses and a vehicle control is included in the study. For the combination studies, the compound of Example 1A is administered p.o. 30 minutes prior to administration of imipramine i.p. and the test initiated 30 minutes following imipramine administration. An n of 8 per group is evaluated for all groups. For the evaluations of the compound of Example 1A alone, testing is initiated 60 minutes following administration and testing of imipramine only treated animals is initiated 30 minutes following administration. A 3 mg/kg dose of the compound of Example 1A and 5 mg/kg of imipramine was substantially as efficacious as a 15 mg/kg dose of imipramine alone and statistically significant over each of vehicle control, imipramine 5 mg/kg alone and 3 mg/kg of Example 1A alone. The 1 mg/kg dose of the compound of Example 1A and 5 mg/kg imipramine also evidenced statistically significant antidepressant effects over each of vehicle control, imipramine 5 mg/kg alone and 1 mg/kg of Example 1A alone. As in the initial study, imipramine 15 mg/kg demonstrated statistically significant antidepressant effect over vehicle control (p<0.05, Dunnett's test for all statistical evaluations).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffect of Example 1A and Imipramine on\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimmobility in mouse forced swim test\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTreatment\n\n\nMean (s)\n\n\nSE\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVehicle\n\n\n183.90\n\n\n11.23\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1A - 1 mg/kg\n\n\n151.53\n\n\n10.59\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1A - 3 mg/kg\n\n\n172.02\n\n\n13.05\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImipramine 5 mg/kg\n\n\n161.94\n\n\n13.54\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1A - 1 mg/kg and imipramine 5 mg/kg\n\n\n90.93\n\n\n12.35\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1A - 3 mg/kg and imipramine 5 mg/kg\n\n\n67.98\n\n\n8.47\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImipramine 15 mg/kg\n\n\n61.70\n\n\n11.20\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data from the second study evidences a potentiation effect of antidepressant-like activity when combination doses of Example 1A and imipramine are administered at doses not evidencing statistically significant activity when each compound is administered alone.\n\n\nPrepulse Inhibition\n\n\nPrepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle reflex is used to evaluate sensory information-processing deficits observed in a number of neurologic and psychiatric conditions. Schizophrenic patients exhibit reduced sensory-motor gating, which is reflected in a reduced prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle reflex. This reduced inhibition can be ameliorated (reversed) by pharmaceutical antipsychotic agents. Certain pharmaceutical compounds that induce psychotic-like states (e.g., dopamine agonists, NMDA antagonists) also disrupt (suppress) PPI and antipsychotic pharmaceutical agents can reverse these deficits. PPI represents a mechanism for the gating or filtering out of irrelevant or distracting stimuli and is operationally defined as the reduction in startle response produced by a low-intensity stimulus presented before a high-intensity, startle-inducing stimulus.\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nExperiment 1\n\n\nReversal of (+)-(5α,7α,8β)-N-Methyl-N-[7-(1-Pyrrolidinyl)-1-Oxaspiro[4,5]dec-8-yl]-Benzeneacetamide (U69593, a Selective K Opioid Receptor Agonist) Induced Disruption of PPI\n\n\nSprague Dawley rats, 40 male, (Harlan, Indianapolis, Ind.), weighing approximately 250 grams and maintained on ad libitum food and water in the home cage, are divided into five groups of eight and dosed (per os) with vehicle, 0.1, 0.3 or 1.0 mg/kg compound of Example 1A one hour prior to testing. Each rat is dosed with either 3 mg/kg U-69593 (via subcutaneous injection) or vehicle fifteen minutes before testing.\n\n\nPrepulse Inhibition Procedure: Following a 5 minute acclimation period, the first trial of a 40-trial session is initiated. The first five trials consist of 115 dB startle bursts, the remaining 35 trials were a pseudo-random combination of prepulse and startle trials. Prepulse trials consisted of a 115 dB sound burst preceded by a 65 dB prepulse of sound. Startle trials consisted of 115 dB sound bursts. In addition, there are five control trials where baseline response to the 60 dB background noise is assessed.\n\n\nThe intertrial interval (ITI) varied from 15 to 45 seconds and consisted of 60 dB background noise. Startle Amplitude for each trial is measured via accelerometer (Hamilton Kinder, model SM100RP) where average force in Newtons is recorded over a 120 millisecond period initiated upon presentation of the 40 millisecond, 115 dB startle stimulus for each trial.\n\n\nInhibition to startle reactivity is measured as each rat's percent change from mean prepulse startle reactivity to mean baseline startle reactivity. [(Mean Baseline Startle−Mean Prepulse Startle)/Mean Baseline Startle]×100.\n\n\nExample 1A is prepared as a solution in a vehicle of sterile water with 85% lactic acid added dropwise until soluble and administered at 0.1, 0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg p.o. in a 1 ml/kg dose-volume.\n\n\nU-69593 is prepared as a solution in a vehicle of sterile water and administered at 3.0 mg/kg subcutaneously in a 1 ml/kg dose-volume.\n\n\nData are analyzed using a One-Way ANOVA (Treatment), with Dunnett's Multiple Comparison Test to assess post hoc significance.

Technical Field\n\n\nThe present invention relates to novel compounds which modulate the CB2 receptor and their use as medicaments.\n\n\n2. Background Information\n\n\nCannabinoids are a group of about 60 distinct compounds found in \nCannabis sativa \n(also know as marijuana) with cannabinol, cannabidiol and Δ\n9\n-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) being the most representative molecules. The therapeutic usage of \nCannabis \ncan be dated back to ancient dynasties of China and includes applications for various illnesses ranging from lack of appetite, emesis, cramps, menstrual pain, spasticity to rheumatism. The long history of \nCannabis \nuse has led to the development of several pharmaceutical drugs. For example, Marinol and Cesamet which are based on THC and its analogous nabilone, respectively, are used as anti-emetic and appetite stimulant. Despite of the clinical benefits, the therapeutic usage of cannabis is limited by its psychoactive effects including hallucination, addiction and dependence. Mechoulam R, ed. \nCannabinoids as Therapeutic Agents\n, Boca Raton, Fla.; CRC Press, 1986 provides a review of the medicinal use of cannabis.\n\n\nThe physiological effects of cannabinoids are mediated by at least two G-protein coupled receptors, CB1 and CB2. Autoradiographic studies have demonstrated that CB1 receptors are expressed primarily in the central nervous system, specifically in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia and cerebellum. They are also found to a lesser degree in the reproductive system and other peripheral tissues including that of the immune system. CB1 receptors regulate the release of neurotransmitters from the pre-synaptic neurons and are believed to mediate most of the euphoric and other central nervous system effects of cannabis, such as THC-induced ring-catalepsy, hypomobility, and hypothermia, which were found to be completely absent in mice with a deletion of the CB1 gene (Zimmer et al., Increased mortality, hypoactivity, and hypoalgesia in cannabinoid CB1 receptor knockout mice. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. (1999) 96:5780-5785.)\n\n\nCB2 receptors are almost exclusively found in the immune system, with the greatest density in the spleen. It is estimated that the expression level of CB2 in the immune cells is about 10 to 100 times higher than CB1. Within the immune system, CB2 is found in various cell types, including B cells, NK cells, monocytes, microglial cells, neutrophils, T cells, dentritic cells and mast cells, suggesting that a wide range of immune functions can be regulated through CB2 modulators (Klein et al., The cannabinoid system and immune system. J Leukoc Biol (2003) 74:486-496). This is supported by the finding that the immunomodulatory effect of THC is absent in CB2 deficient mice (Bicklet et al., Immunomodulation by cannabinoid is absent in mice deficient for the cannabinoid CB2 receptor. Eur J Pharmacol (2000) 396:141-149). CB2 selective ligands have been developed and tested for their effects in various imflammatory settings. For example, in animal models of inflammation, CB2 selective agonists, inverse agonists and antagonists have been shown to be effective in suppressing inflammation (Hanus et al., HU-308: a specific agonist for CB(2), a peripheral cannabinoid receptor. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. (1999) 96:14228-14233, Ueda et al., Involvement of cannabinoid CB(2) receptor-mediated response and efficacy of cannabinoid CB(2) receptor inverse agonist, JTE-907, in cutaneous inflammation in mice. Eur J. Pharmacol. (2005) 520:164-171 and Smith et al., The anti-inflammatory activities of cannabinoid receptor ligands in mouse peritonitis models Eur J. Pharmacol. (2001) 432:107-119). Furthermore, CB2 selective agonists inhibit disease severity and spasticity in animal models for multiple sclerosis (Baker et al., Cannabinoids control spasticity and tremor in a multiple sclerosis model. Nature (2000) 404:84-87. Arevalo-Martin et al., Therapeutic action of cannabinoids in a murine model of multiple sclerosis J. Neurosci. (2003) 23:2511-2516). Taken together, these results support the notion that CB2 receptor modulators can be employed for the treatment of medical conditions having an inflammatory component.\n\n\nIn addition to inflammation, CB2 agonists have been shown to inhibit pain and emesis. For instance, CB2 selective agonists blunt the pain response induced by thermal or other stimuli (Malan et al., CB2 cannabinoid receptor-mediated peripheral antinociception. Pain. (2001) 93:239-45 and Nackley et al., Selective activation of cannabinoid CB(2) receptors suppresses spinal fos protein expression and pain behavior in a rat model of inflammation. Neuroscience (2003) 119:747-57.) CB2 activation has also been demonstrated to inhibit neuropathic pain response (Ibrahim et al., Activation of CB2 cannabinoid receptors by AM1241 inhibits experimental neuropathic pain: pain inhibition by receptors not present in the CNS. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. (2003) 100:10529-33.) Finally, in contrast to the earlier data which did not find CB2 in the brain, a recent article demonstrated the expression of CB2 in the brain, at about 1.5% of the level in the spleen. CB2 activation is shown by this article to be responsible for the anti-emetic effect of endocannabinoid (Van Sickle et al., Identification and functional characterization of brainstem cannabinoid CB2 receptors. Science. 2005 310:329-332). The foregoing results confirm that CB2 agonists can be used for the treatment of inflammatory and neuropathic pain as well as emesis.\n\n\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention provides novel compounds which bind to and are agonists, antagonists or inverse agonists of the CB2 receptor. The invention also provides a method and pharmaceutical compositions for treating inflammation by way of the administration of therapeutic amounts of these compounds. Lastly, the invention provides a method and pharmaceutical compositions for treating pain by way of the administration of therapeutic amounts of the new compounds which are CB2 agonists.\n\n\nDETAILED

The Celite was washed with ether and the filtrate was concentrated in vacuo to afford the desired carbamoyl chloride (1.43 g; 7.21 mmol; 97.5% yield) as an off-white solid. This material was used without purification.\n\n\nTo a solution of the diazapane-isoxazole urea (683 mg; 3.46 mmol) in 20 mL anhydrous THF was added dioxo-thiomorpholine carbamoyl chloride (1.09 g of 84% material; 3.46 mmol) followed by DIPEA (0.72 mL; 4.15 mmol). The mixture was left stirring at room temperature for 2 hours, then quenched with water. It was extracted twice with DCM, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate to afford a yellow foam. This material was triturated in DCM to afford 456 mg of the title compound as a white solid. A further 186 mg of product precipitated out of the mother liquor, and this solid was combined with the previous and dried in high vacuum at 60° C. overnight. A total 632 mg of the title compound were isolated in 97.6% purity (HPLC), 42.8% yield.\n\n\nSimilar procedures as above were used for the synthesis of compounds in Table 1, method R. Where appropriate the isocyanate was used in place of the carbamoyl chloride.\n\n\nExample 17\n\n\nSynthesis of 4-[2-(1,1-Dioxo-1λ\n6\n-thiomorpholin-4-yl)-acetyl]-[1,4]diazepane-1-carboxylic acid (5-tert-butyl-isoxazol-3-yl)-amide (Compound 228 in Table 1, Method S)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo a solution of the diazapane-isoxazole urea (1.8 g; 6.76 mmol) in 20 mL DCM (cooled to 0° C.), was added DIPEA (1.29 mL; 7.42 mmol) followed by the dropwise addition of chloroacetyl chloride (0.59 mL; 7.43 mmol). The mixture was stirred for 1 hour as the reaction slowly warmed to room temperature. Saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution was added to the mixture and it was extracted with DCM twice. The combined organics were washed with brine, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. The yellow residue was purified by flash column chromatography on silica gel using 2.5% methanol in DCM mixture as eluent. The product was obtained as a pale yellow foam (1.16 g; 50.2% yield).\n\n\nThe above acteyl chloride (1.122 g; 3.27 mmol) was dissolved in 10 mL DMF. Thiomorpholine 1,1-dioxide (0.442 g; 3.27 mmol) was added followed by DIPEA (0.63 mL; 3.6 mol) and DMAP (16 mg; 0.131 mmol). The reaction mixture was heated in a 60° C. oil bath overnight. Water was added to the reaction mixture, and it was extracted with EtOAc three times. The organics were combined and washed with brine, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated. The yellow residue obtained was purified by flash column chromatography on silica gel using 2.5% methanol in DCM mixture as eluent then switched to 5% methanol in DCM. The title compound was obtained in >95% purity (HPLC) as a white foam (781 mg; 54% yield).\n\n\nAccording to this method, compounds listed in Table 1, method S were made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nLC-MS\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMH+\n\n\n

Human CB1 and CB2 Receptor Binding:\n\n\nExperimental Method:\n\n\nCB2 membranes were purchased and made from HEK293 EBNA cells stably transfected with human CB2 receptor cDNA (Perkin Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences). CB1 membranes were isolated from HEK cells stably co-transfected with human CB1 receptor and Ga16 cDNA's. The membrane preparation was bound to scintillation beads (Ysi-Poly-L-lysine SPA beads, GE Healthcare) for 4 hours at room temperature in assay buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 2.5 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl\n2\n, 0.8% fatty acid free Bovine Serum Albumin. Unbound membrane was removed by washing in assay buffer. Membrane-bead mixture was added to 96-well assay plates in the amounts of 15 ug membrane per well (CB2) or 2.5 ug per well (CB1) and 1 mg SPA bead per well. Compounds were added to the membrane-bead mixture in dose-response concentrations ranging from 1×10\n−5 \nM to 1×10\n−10 \nM with 0.25% DMSO, final. The competition reaction was initiated with the addition of \n3\nH—CP55940 (Perkin Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences) at a final concentration of 1.5 nM (CB2) or 2.5 nM (CB1). The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 18 hours and read on TopCount NXT plate reader. Total and non-specific binding was determined in the absence and presence of 1.25 uM Win 55212 (Sigma). IC\n50 \nvalues for each compound were calculated as the concentration of compound that inhibits the specific binding of the radioactively labeled ligand to the receptor by 50% using the XLFit 4.1 four parameter logistic model. IC\n50 \nvalues were converted to inhibition constant (Ki) values using Cheng-Prusoff equation.\n\n\nB. CB2R Mediated Modulation of cAMP Synthesis:\n\n\nCompounds of the invention were evaluated for their CB2 agonist or inverse agonistic activity in accordance with the following experimental method. Compounds which were shown to bind to CB2 by the binding assay described above but which were not shown to exhibit CB2R-mediated modulation of cAMP synthesis by this assay were presumed to be CB2 antagonists.\n\n\nExperimental Method:\n\n\nCHO cells expressing human CB2R (Euroscreen) were plated at a density of 5000 cells per well in 384 well plates and incubated overnight at 37° C. After removing the media, the cells were treated with test compounds diluted in stimulation buffer containing 1 mM IBMX, 0.25% BSA and 10 uM Forskolin. The assay was incubated for 30 minutes at 37° C. Cells were lysed and the cAMP concentration was measured using DiscoverX-XS cAMP kit, following the manufacturer's protocol. In this setting, agonists will decrease forskolin induced production of cAMP while inverse agonists will further increase forskolin induced production of cAMP. EC50 of agonists were calculated as follows. The maximal amount of cAMP produced by forskolin compared to the level of cAMP inhibited by 1 uM CP55940 is defined as 100%. The EC50 value of each test compound was determined as the concentration at which 50% of the forskolin-stimulated cAMP synthesis was inhibited. Data was analyzed using a four-parameter logistic model. (Model 205 of XLfit 4.0).\n\n\nC.

Such compositions can be prepared using procedures well known in the pharmaceutical art and comprise at least one compound of the invention. The compounds of the invention may also be administered alone or in combination with adjuvants that enhance stability of the compounds of the invention, facilitate administration of pharmaceutical compositions containing them in certain embodiments, provide increased dissolution or dispersion, increased inhibitory activity, provide adjunct therapy, and the like. The compounds according to the invention may be used on their own or in conjunction with other active substances according to the invention, optionally also in conjunction with other pharmacologically active substances. In general, the compounds of this invention are administered in a therapeutically or pharmaceutically effective amount, but may be administered in lower amounts for diagnostic or other purposes.\n\n\nAdministration of the compounds of the invention, in pure form or in an appropriate pharmaceutical composition, can be carried out using any of the accepted modes of administration of pharmaceutical compositions. Thus, administration can be, for example, orally, buccally (e.g., sublingually), nasally, parenterally, topically, transdermally, vaginally, or rectally, in the form of solid, semi-solid, lyophilized powder, or liquid dosage forms, such as, for example, tablets, suppositories, pills, soft elastic and hard gelatin capsules, powders, solutions, suspensions, or aerosols, or the like, preferably in unit dosage forms suitable for simple administration of precise dosages. The pharmaceutical compositions will generally include a conventional pharmaceutical carrier or excipient and a compound of the invention as the/an active agent, and, in addition, may include other medicinal agents, pharmaceutical agents, carriers, adjuvants, diluents, vehicles, or combinations thereof. Such pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, carriers, or additives as well as methods of making pharmaceutical compositions for various modes or administration are well-known to those of skill in the art. The state of the art is evidenced, e.g., by \nRemington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, \n20th Edition, A. Gennaro (ed.), Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2000; \nHandbook of Pharmaceutical Additives\n, Michael & Irene Ash (eds.), Gower, 1995\n; Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients\n, A. H. Kibbe (ed.), American Pharmaceutical Ass'n, 2000; H. C. Ansel and N. G. Popovish, \nPharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, \n5th ed., Lea and Febiger, 1990; each of which is incorporated herein by reference in their entireties to better describe the state of the art.\n\n\nAs one of skill in the art would expect, the forms of the compounds of the invention utilized in a particular pharmaceutical formulation will be selected (e.g., salts) that possess suitable physical characteristics (e.g., water solubility) that is required for the formulation to be efficacious.\n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions suitable for buccal (sub-lingual) administration include lozenges comprising a compound of the present invention in a flavored base, usually sucrose, and acacia or tragacanth, and pastilles comprising the compound in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose and acacia.\n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions suitable for parenteral administration comprise sterile aqueous preparations of a compound of the present invention. These preparations are preferably administered intravenously, although administration can also be effected by means of subcutaneous, intramuscular, or intradermal injection. Injectable pharmaceutical formulations are commonly based upon injectable sterile saline, phosphate-buffered saline, oleaginous suspensions, or other injectable carriers known in the art and are generally rendered sterile and isotonic with the blood. The injectable pharmaceutical formulations may therefore be provided as a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, including 1,3-butanediol, water, Ringer's solution, isotonic sodium chloride solution, fixed oils such as synthetic mono- or diglycerides, fatty acids such as oleic acid, and the like. Such injectable pharmaceutical formulations are formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or setting agents and suspending agents. Injectable compositions will generally contain from 0.1 to 5% w/w of a compound of the invention.\n\n\nSolid dosage forms for oral administration of the compounds include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. For such oral administration, a pharmaceutically acceptable composition containing a compound(s) of the invention is formed by the incorporation of any of the normally employed excipients, such as, for example, pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, pregelatinized starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharine, talcum, cellulose ether derivatives, glucose, gelatin, sucrose, citrate, propyl gallate, and the like. Such solid pharmaceutical formulations may include formulations, as are well-known in the art, to provide prolonged or sustained delivery of the drug to the gastrointestinal tract by any number of mechanisms, which include, but are not limited to, pH sensitive release from the dosage form based on the changing pH of the small intestine, slow erosion of a tablet or capsule, retention in the stomach based on the physical properties of the formulation, bioadhesion of the dosage form to the mucosal lining of the intestinal tract, or enzymatic release of the active drug from the dosage form.\n\n\nLiquid dosage forms for oral administration of the compounds include emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups, and elixirs, optionally containing pharmaceutical adjuvants in a carrier, such as, for example, water, saline, aqueous dextrose, glycerol, ethanol and the like. These compositions can also contain additional adjuvants such as wetting, emulsifying, suspending, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents.\n\n\nTopical dosage forms of the compounds include ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, powders, solutions, sprays, inhalants, eye ointments, eye or ear drops, impregnated dressings and aerosols, and may contain appropriate conventional additives such as preservatives, solvents to assist drug penetration and emollients in ointments and creams. Topical application may be once or more than once per day depending upon the usual medical considerations. Furthermore, preferred compounds for the present invention can be administered in intranasal form via topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles. The formulations may also contain compatible conventional carriers, such as cream or ointment bases and ethanol or oleyl alcohol for lotions. Such carriers may be present as from about 1% up to about 98% of the formulation, more usually they will form up to about 80% of the formulation.\n\n\nTransdermal administration is also possible. Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for transdermal administration can be presented as discrete patches adapted to remain in intimate contact with the epidermis of the recipient for a prolonged period of time. To be administered in the form of a transdermal delivery system, the dosage administration will, of course, be continuous rather than intermittent throughout the dosage regimen. Such patches suitably contain a compound of the invention in an optionally buffered, aqueous solution, dissolved and/or dispersed in an adhesive, or dispersed in a polymer. A suitable concentration of the active compound is about 1% to 35%, preferably about 3% to 15%.\n\n\nFor administration by inhalation, the compounds of the invention are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray from a pump spray device not requiring a propellant gas or from a pressurized pack or a nebulizer with the use of a suitable propellant, e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, tetrafluoroethane, heptafluoropropane, carbon dioxide, or other suitable gas. In any case, the aerosol spray dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount so that the resulting metered dose inhaler (MDI) is used to administer the compounds of the invention in a reproducible and controlled way. Such inhaler, nebulizer, or atomizer devices are known in the prior art, for example, in PCT International Publication Nos. WO 97/12687 (particularly FIG. 6 thereof, which is the basis for the commercial RESPIMAT® nebulizer); WO 94/07607; WO 97/12683; and WO 97/20590, to which reference is hereby made and each of which is incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.\n\n\nRectal administration can be effected utilizing unit dose suppositories in which the compound is admixed with low-melting water-soluble or insoluble solids such as fats, cocoa butter, glycerinated gelatin, hydrogenated vegetable oils, mixtures of polyethylene glycols of various molecular weights, or fatty acid esters of polyethylene glycols, or the like. The active compound is usually a minor component, often from about 0.05 to 10% by weight, with the remainder being the base component.\n\n\nIn all of the above pharmaceutical compositions, the compounds of the invention are formulated with an acceptable carrier or excipient. The carriers or excipients used must, of course, be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the composition and must not be deleterious to the patient. The carrier or excipient can be a solid or a liquid, or both, and is preferably formulated with the compound of the invention as a unit-dose composition, for example, a tablet, which can contain from 0.05% to 95% by weight of the active compound. Such carriers or excipients include inert fillers or diluents, binders, lubricants, disintegrating agents, solution retardants, resorption accelerators, absorption agents, and coloring agents. Suitable binders include starch, gelatin, natural sugars such as glucose or β-lactose, corn sweeteners, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, tragacanth or sodium alginate, carboxymethylcellulose, polyethylene glycol, waxes, and the like. Lubricants include sodium oleate, sodium stearate, magnesium stearate, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium chloride, and the like. Disintegrators include starch, methyl cellulose, agar, bentonite, xanthan gum, and the like.\n\n\nPharmaceutically acceptable carriers and excipients encompass all the foregoing additives and the like.\n\n\nExamples of Pharmaceutical Formulations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA.
