Description\n\n\n\n\n ANDROGEN RECEPTOR MODULATING COMPOUNDS \n\n\nTechnical field \n\n\nThe present invention relates to therapeutically active compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters thereof useful in the treatment of nuclear receptor, especially steroid receptor, and in particular androgen receptor (AR) dependent conditions and diseases, and to pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds. In particular, the invention discloses non-steroidal carboxamide and acyl hydrazone structured compounds having utility as tissue-selective androgen receptor modulators (SARM). The compounds of the invention, which possess AR antagonist activity, are useful for treating patients requiring androgen receptor antagonist therapy. In particular, AR antagonists of the invention are useful in the treatment or prevention of cancer, particularly AR dependent cancer such as prostate cancer, and other diseases where AR antagonism is desired. \n\n\nBackground of the invention \n\n\nIn recent years, there has been growing interest in the development of nonsteroidal modulators for steroid receptors for therapeutical use. It has been shown that nonsteroidal ligands can achieve better receptor selectivity and better \n\n\nphysicochemical, pharmacokinetic and pharmacological properties. For androgen receptor (AR), nonsteroidal antagonists (antiandrogens) are now used clinically to counteract the undesirable actions of excessive androgens. \n\n\nAndrogens, functioning through the AR, are essential for the initiation and progression of prostate cancer. Thus, treatment of advanced prostate cancer involves androgen-ablation therapies, such as surgical castration or hormonal manipulation using gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, anti-androgens or both. Although such therapies initially lead to disease regression, eventually all patients progress to a castration resistant late stage that is refractory to current therapies. Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is associated with increased levels of AR. First generation anti-androgens such as bicalutamide display agonistic properties in cells engineered to express higher AR levels. In vitro and in vivo, increased AR \n\n expression has been shown to confer resistance of prostate cancer cell lines to anti- androgen therapy. To overcome resistance problems, second generation anti- androgens that retain antagonism in cells expressing excess AR may have utility in the treatment of CRPC. \n\n\nNon-steroidal androgen receptor antagonists have been described earlier e.g. in patent publications EP 100172, EP 1790640, US 6,087,509, US 6,673,799, US 7271188, WO 03/057669, WO 2004/ 099188, WO 2006/133567, WO 2008/124000, WO 2009/028543 and WO 2009/055053. \n\n\nRelated carboxamide structured compounds have been described in WO 2008/062878. \n\n\nSummary of the invention \n\n\nIt has been found that compounds of formula (I) or (Γ) are potent androgen receptor (AR) modulators, in particular AR antagonists. Compounds of formula (I) or (Γ) show remarkably high affinity and strong antagonistic activity in androgen receptor. Also in cells which overexpress AR (\"AR overexpressing cells\") the compounds of the invention possess from high to full AR antagonism while exhibiting only minimal agonism. The compounds of the invention also effectively inhibited proliferation of prostatic cancer cell line. Moreover, the compounds of the invention have low potential for drug-drug interactions, favourable safety profile and sufficient water solubility. \n\n\nThe compounds of the invention are therefore particularly useful as medicaments in the treatment of prostate cancer and other AR dependent conditions and diseases where AR antagonism is desired. \n\n\nThe present invention provides novel carboxamide structured compounds of formula (I) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n wherein \n\n\n Ri is hydrogen, halogen, cyano, nitro or optionally substituted 5- or 6- membered heterocyclic ring; \n\n\n R\n2\n is hydrogen, halogen, cyano, nitro, amino, Ci\n-7\n alkyl, halo Ci\n-7\n alkyl, hydroxy Ci\n-7\n alkyl, thio Ci\n-7\n alkyl or C\n1-7\n alkoxy; \n\n\n R\n3\n is hydrogen, halogen or Ci\n-7\n alkyl, \n\n\n or R\n2\n and R\n3\n together with the carbon atoms to which they are attached form a optionally substituted 5- or 6-membered carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring; \n\n\n wherein at least two of Ri\n;\n R\n2\n and R\n3\n are not hydrogen; \n\n\n R\n4\n, R4' , R\n5\n, R<5 and R\n7\n are, independently, hydrogen, Ci\n-7\n alkyl, halo Ci\n-7\n alkyl or hydroxy Ci\n-7\n alkyl; \n\n\nring atom E is C or N; \n\n\n dashed line means an optional double bond; \n\n\n A is a 5 -12 membered heterocyclic ring; \n\n\n B is a 5-membered heterocyclic ring wherein 1-3 of the members are heteroatoms selected from N, O and S; \n\n\n R\n8\n is hydrogen, hydroxy, halogen, nitro, amino, cyano, oxo, Ci\n-7\n alkyl, Ci\n-7\n alkoxy, halo Ci\n-7\n alkyl, hydroxy Ci- alkyl, cyano Ci\n-7\n alkyl, amino Ci\n-7\n alkyl, oxo Ci\n-7\n alkyl, Ci\n-7\n alkoxy Ci\n-7\n alkyl, methylsulfonamido Ci\n-7\n alkyl, oxiran Ci\n-7\n alkyl, Ci\n-7\n alkylamino, hydroxy Ci\n-7\n alkylamino, Ci\n-7\n alkoxy Ci\n-7\n alkylamino, Ci\n-7\n alkylamino Ci\n-7\n alkyl, hydroxy Ci\n-7\n alkylamino Ci\n-7\n alkyl, hydroxyimino Ci\n-7\n alkyl, halo C,\n-7\n alkylhydroxy C alkyl, -C(O)Ri\n0\n, -OC(0)R,\n7\n , -NH-C(0)R,\n8\n or an optionally substituted 5 - 12 membered carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring, each group optionally linked to A-ring via Ci\n-7\n alkylene linker; \n\n\n R\n9\n is hydrogen, halogen, Ci\n-7\n alkyl, oxo, hydroxy Ci\n-7\n alkyl, oxo Ci\n-7\n alkyl or an optionally substituted 5 or 6 membered carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring, each group optionally linked to A-ring via Ci\n-7\n alkylene linker; \n\n Rio is hydrogen, hydroxy, Ci\n-7\n alkyl, hydroxy Cj\n-7\n alkyl, halo Ci\n-7\n alkyl, C\n1-7\n alkoxy, NRnRi\n2\n, or an optionally substituted 5 - 12 membered carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring; \n\n\n Ri i is hydrogen, Ci\n-7\n alkyl, hydroxy Ci- alkyl, amino Ci\n-7\n alkyl, Ci\n-7\n alkyl amino Ci\n-7\n alkyl, \n\n\n Ri2 is hydrogen or Cj\n-7\n alkyl; \n\n\n Ri\n3\n and Rj\n4\n are, independently, hydrogen, Ci\n-7\n alkyl, halogen, cyano or hydroxy C\n1-7\n alkyl; \n\n\n Ri\n5\n and R\n1\n are, independently, hydrogen, oxo, thioxo, Cj\n-7\n alkyl or cyano; Rn is C\n1-7\n alkyl, C\n1-7\n alkoxy, amino Ci\n-7\n alkyl or C1.7 alkylamino C1.7 alkyl;\n\n\nR] 8 is Ci-7 alkyl, amino Ci_7 alkyl or Ci-7 alkylamino Ci_7 alkyl; \n\n\nand pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. \n\n\nIn one class of preferred compounds of formula (I) are compounds wherein a group of formula (1 ') the substituents of B being R13 and Ri\n4\n \n\n\n \n\n wherein Z is O, N, C=0 or C=S; X is C or N; Y is C or N; G is CH, C=0 or C=S and M is CH or O; a dashed line means an optional double bond, the asterisk denotes the point of attachment to the ring, and R)\n3\n and R]\n4\n are as defined above for compounds of formula (I). \n\n\nIn another class of preferred compounds of formula (I) are compounds wherein B is a group of formula (2'), (3') or (4') the substituents of B being Ri\n3\n and .

The examples are meant only for illustrating purposes and do not limit the scope of the invention defined in claims. \n\n\nEXPERIMENTS Experiment 1. \n\n\n AR binding affinity (Ki) of the test compound was measured. \n\n\n AR antagonism of the test compound was measured as IC\n50\n value (nM) to human AR in hAR/HEK.293 cells. \n\n AR agonism of the test compound in AR overexpressing hAR/HEK293 cells was measured as % of testosterone-induced AR activity at 10 uM concentration. \n\n\n The IC\n50\n value of the test compound for inhibition of mibolerone-induced VCaP cell proliferation was measured. \n\n\n Bicalutamide was used as a reference compound in the measurements. \n\n\nMethods \n\n\nAndrogen Receptor Binding Assay \n\n\nAndrogen receptor (AR) binding affinities of test compounds were studied in cytosolic lysates obtained from ventral prostates of castrated rats by competition binding assay (Schilling K. and Liao S., The Prostate, 1984; 5(6):581-588). Cytosol preparations and 1 nM [3H]mibolerone were incubated with increasing \n\n\nconcentrations of test compounds. To determine non-specific binding, parallel incubations were carried out using excess of unlabelled testosterone. After incubation, bound and free steroids were separated by treatment with dextran-coated charcoal suspension. Bound radioactivity was determined by counting of supernatant fraction in scintillation fluid. Radioactivity was measured using a Microbeta counter. All data points were done as quadrublicates. Dissociation constant of \n\n\n [3H]mibolerone for rat androgen receptor was determined by saturation binding assay obtained from ventral prostates of castrated rats essentially as described (Isomaa V. et al., Endocrinology, 1982; 1 1 1(3):833-843). Analysis of data \n\n\nFor analysis of saturation binding affinity, one site binding equation \n\n\n(hyperbola) was used \n\n\nSpecific binding = \n\n\n Kd + X where \n\n\n Bmax = the maximum specific binding \n\n\nKd = the equilibrium dissociation constant \n\n\nX = radioligand concentration \n\n Equilibrium dissociation constant (Ki) was calculated using the equation of Cheng and Prusoff: \n\n\n\n\nK =\n\n\n1C50\n\n\n\n\n 1 [radioligand] where \n\n\n [radioligand] = the concentration of free radioligand \n\n\n K\nd\n = the dissociation constant of the radioligand for the receptor \n\n\n IC50 = IC\n50\n value measured in a competition radioligand binding assay AR antagonism \n\n\nAntagonism of test compounds for AR was measured by reporter gene assay in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells stably transfected with an expression vector encoding full-length human AR and androgen responsive luciferase reporter gene construct (hAR/HEK293 cells). To determine antagonism for hAR, the cells were treated simultaneously with increasing concentrations of the test compound and submaximal concentration of testosterone (usually 0.45 nM). The final DMSO concentration was 1%. All test compounds were studied in triplicates. The cells were incubated for 24 before measurement of luciferase activity using Luciferase Assay System (Promega Corporation). \n\n\nAgonism of test compounds in AR overexpressing cells was measured by reporter gene assay in HEK293 cells stably transfected with an expression vector encoding full-length human AR and androgen responsive luciferase reporter gene construct. A clone expressing high levels of androgen receptor (5 times more than\n\n\nAR levels in AR-HEK293 cells) was selected to study agonism in AR overexpressing cells. To determine agonism, the cells were treated with increasing concentrations of the test compound. The final DMSO concentration was 1%. The test compounds were studied in triplicates and luciferase activity was determined as described above. \n\n\nCell proliferation assays \n\n\nThe ability of test compounds to inhibit prostate cancer cell growth was studied by measuring inhibition of cell proliferation using androgen-sensitive VCaP \n\n well plate in the appropriate culture medium (phenol red-free RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10 % charcoal stripped FBS and 4 mM Glutamax + 100 IU penicillin, 100 IU streptomycin). The cells were allowed to attach for 2-3 days and were subsequently treated with the test compounds in the presence of mibolerone (a concentration capable of inducing submaximal increase in cell proliferation, usually 0.1 nM) for 4-5 days. Cell proliferation was measured using WST-1 Cell \n\n\nProliferation Assay (Roche). \n\n\nTable 1.
