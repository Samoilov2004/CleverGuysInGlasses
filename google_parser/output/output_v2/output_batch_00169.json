Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to novel classes of compounds which are inhibitors of interleukin-1β converting enzymes (\"ICE\"). This invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds. The compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of this invention are particularly well suited for inhibiting ICE activity and consequently, may be advantageously used as agents against interleukin-1- (\"IL-1\"), apcptosis-, interferon gamma inducing factor- (\"IGiF\") and interferon-γ-(\"IFN-γ\") mediated diseases, including inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, destructive bone, proliferative disorders, infectious diseases and degenerative diseases. This invention also relates to methods for inhibiting ICE activity, and decreasing IGIF production and IFN-γ production and methods for treating interleukin-1-, apoptosis-, IGIF- and IFN-γ-mediated diseases using the compounds and compositions of this invention. This invention also relates to methods of preparing N-acylamino compounds.\n\n\n \n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nInterleukin 1 (\"IL-1\") is a major pro-inflammatory and immunoregulatory protein that stimulates fibroblast differentiation and proliferation, the production of prostaglandins, collagenase and phospholipase by synovial cells and chondrocytes, basophil and eosinophil degranulation and neutrophil activation. \nOppenheim, J.H. et al, Immunology Today, 7, pp. 45-56 (1986\n).. As such, it is involved in the pathogenesis of chronic and acute inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. For example, in rheumatoid arthritis, IL-1 is both a mediator of inflammatory symptoms and of the destruction of the cartilage proteoglycan in afflicted joints. \nWood, D.D. et al., Arthritis Rheum. 26, 975, (1983\n); \nPettipher, E.J. et al., Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 71, 295 (1986\n); \nArend, W.P. and Dayer, J.M., Arthritis Rheum. 38, 151 (1995\n). IL-1 is also a highly potent bone resorption agent. \nJandiski, J.J., J. Oral Path 17, 145 (1988\n); \nDewhirst, F.E. et al., J. Immunol. 8, 2562 1985\n). It is alternately referred to as \"osteoclast activating factor\" in destructive bone diseases such as osteoarthritis and multiple myeloma. \nBataille, R. et al., Int. J. Clin. Lab. Res. 21(4), 283 (1992\n). In certain proliferative disorders, such as acute myelogenous leukemia and multiple myeloma, IL-1 can promote tumor cell growth and adhesion. \nBani, M.R., J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 83, 123 (1991\n); Vidal-\nVanaclocha, F., Cancer Res. 54, 2667 (1994\n). In these disorders, IL-1 also stimulates production of other cytokines such as IL-6, which can modulate tumor development (\nTartour et al., Cancer Res. 54, 6243 (1994\n). IL-1 is predominantly produced by peripheral blood monocytes as part of the inflammatory response and exists in two distinct agonist forms, IL-1α and IL-1β. \nMosely, B.S. et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci., 84, pp. 4572-4576 (1987\n); \nLonnemann, G. et al., Eur.J. Immunol., 19, pp. 1531-1536 (1989\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIL-1β is synthesized as a biologically inactive precursor, pIL-1β. pIL-1β lacks a conventional leader sequence and is not processed by a signal peptidase. \nMarch, C.J., Nature, 315, pp. 641-647 (1985\n). Instead, pIL-1β is cleaved by interleukin-1β converting enzyme (\"ICE\") between Asp-116 and Ala-117 to produce the biologically active C-terminal fragment found in human serum and synovial fluid. \nSleath, P.R., et al., J. Biol. Chem., 265, pp. 14526-14528 (1992\n); \nA.D. Howard et al., J . Immunol., 147, pp. 2964-2969 (1991\n). ICE is a cysteine protease localized primarily in monocytes. It converts precursor IL-1β to the mature form. \nBlack, R.A.. et al., FEBS Lett., 247, pp. 386-390 (1989\n); \nKostura, M.J. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 86, pp. 5227-5231 (1989\n) . Processing by ICE is also necessary for the transport of mature IL-1β through the cell membrane.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nICE, or its homologs, also appears to be involved in the regulation of programmed cell death or apoptosis. \nYuan, J. et al., Cell, 75, pp. 641-652 (1993\n); \nMiura, M. et al., Cell, 75, pp. 653-660 (1993\n); \nNett-Fiordalisi, M.A. et al., J. Cell Biochem., 17B, p. 117 (1993\n). In particular, ICE or ICE homologs are thought to be associated with the regulation of apoptosis in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. \nMarx, J. and M. Baringa, Science, 259, pp. 760-762 (1993\n); \nGagliardini, V. et al., Science, 263, pp. 826-828 (1994\n). Therapeutic applications for inhibition of apoptosis may include treatment of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke, myocardial infarction, spinal atrophy, and aging.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nICE has been demonstrated to mediate apoptosis (programmed cell death) in certain tissue types., \nSteller, H., Science, 267, p. 1445 (1995\n); \nWhyte, M. and Evan, G., Nature, 376, p. 17 (1995\n); \nMartin, S.J. and Green, D.R., Cell, 82, p. 349 (1995\n); \nAlnemri, E.S., et al., J. Biol. Chem., 270, p. 4312 (1995\n); \nYuan, J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol., 7, p. 211 (1995\n). A transgenic mouse with a disruption of the ICE gene is deficient in Fas-mediated apoptosis (\nKuida, K. et al., science 267, 2000 (1995\n)). This activity of ICE is distinct from its role as the processing enzyme for pro-IL1β. It is conceivable that in certain tissue types, inhibition of ICE may not affect secretion of mature IL-1β, but may inhibit apoptosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnzymatically active ICE has been previously described as a heterodimer composed of two subunits, p20 and p10 (20kDa and 10kDa molecular weight, respectively). These subunits are derived from a 45kDa proenzyme (p45) by way of a p30 form, through an activation mechanism that is autocatalytic. \nThornberry, N.A. et al., Nature, 356, pp. 768-774 (1992\n). The ICE proenzyme has been divided into several functional domains: a prodomain (p14), a p22/20 subunit, a polypeptide linker and a p10 subunit. \nThornberry et al.,\n \nsupra\n ; \nCasano et al., Genomics, 20, pp. 474-481 +(1994\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFull length p45 has been characterized by its cDNA and amino acid sequences. \n \nPCT patent applications WO 91/15577\n \n and \n \nWO 94/00154\n \n. The p20 and p10 cDNA and amino acid sequences are also known. \nThornberry et al., supra.\n Murine and rat ICE have also been sequenced and cloned. They have high amino acid and nucleic acid sequence homology to human ICE. \nMiller, D.K. et al., Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci., 696, pp. 133-148 (1993\n); \nMolineaux, S.M. et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. sci., 90, pp. 1809-1813 (1993\n). The three-dimensional structure of ICE has been determined at atomic resolution by x-ray crystallography. \nWilson, K.P., et al., Nature, 370, pp. 270-275 (1994\n). The active enzyme exists as a tetramer of two p20 and two p10 subunits.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, there exist human homologs of ICE with sequence similarities in the active site regions of the enzymes. Such homologs include TX (or ICE\nrel-II\n or ICH-2) (\nFaucheu, et al., EMBO J., 14, p. 1914 (1995\n); \nKamens J., et al., J. Biol. Chem., 270, p. 15250 (1995\n); \nNicholson et al., J. Biol. Chem., 270 15870 (1995\n)), TY (or ICE\nrel-III\n) (\nNicholson et al., J. Biol. Chem., 270, p. 15870 (1995\n); ICH-1 (or Nedd-2) (\nWang, L. et al., Cell,78, p. 739 (1994\n)), MCH-2, (\nFernandes-Alnemri, T. et al., Cancer Res., 55, p. 2737 (1995\n), CPP32 (or YAMA or apopain) (\nFernandes-Alnemri, T. et al., J. Biol. Chem., 269, p. 30761 (1994\n); \nNicholson, D.W. et al., Nature, 376, p. 37 (1995\n)), and CMH-1 (or MCH-3) (\nLippke, et al., J. Biol, Chem., (1996\n); \nFernandes-Alnemri, T. et al., Cancer Res., (1995\n)). Each of these ICE homologs, as well as ICE itself, is capable of inducing apoptosis when overexpressed in transfected cell lines. Inhibition of one or more of these homologs with the peptidyl ICE inhibitor Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-chloromethylketone results in inhibition of apoptosis in primary cells or cell lines. \nLazebnik et al., Nature. 371, p. 346 (1994\n). The compounds described herein are also capable of inhibiting one or more homologs of ICE (see Example 5). Therefore, these compounds may be used to inhibit apoptosis in tissue types that contain ICE homologs, but which do not contain active ICE or produce mature IL-1β.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInterferon-gamma inducing factor (IGIF) is an approximately 18-kDa polypeptide that stimulates T-cell production of interferon-gamma (IFN-y). IGIF is produced by activated Kupffer cells and macrophages in \nvivo\n and is exported out of such cells upon endotoxin stimulation. Thus, a compound that decreases IGIF production would be useful as an inhibitor of such T-cell stimulation which in turn would reduce the levels of IFN-γ production by those cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIFN-γ is a cytokine with immunomodulatory effects on a variety of immune cells. In particular, IFN-γ is involved in macrophage activation and Th1 cell selection (\nF. Belardelli, APMIS, 103, p. 161 (1995\n)). IFN-\nY\n exerts its effects in part by modulating the expression of genes through the STAT and IRF pathways (\nC. Schindler and J.E. Darnell, Ann. Rev. Biochem., 64, p. 621 (1995\n); \nT. Taniguchi, J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol., 121, p. 516 (1995\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMice lacking IFN-\nY\n or its receptor have multiple defects in immune cell function and are resistant to endotoxic shock (\nS. Huang et al., Science, 259, p. 1742 (1993\n); \nD. Dalton et al., Science, 259, p. 1739 (1993\n); \nB. D. Car et al., J. Exp. Med., 179, p. 1437 (1994\n)). Along with IL-12, IGIF appears to be a potent inducer of IFN-γ production by T cells (\nH. Okamura et al., Infection and Immunity, 63, p. 3966 (1995\n); \nH. Okamura et al., Nature, 378, p. 88 (1995\n); \nS. Ushio et al., J. Immunol., 156, p. 4274 (1996\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIFN-γ has been shown to contribute to the pathology associated with a variety of inflammatory, infectious and autoimmune disorders and diseases. Thus, compounds capable of decreasing IFN-\nY\n production would be useful to ameliorate the effects of IFN-γ related pathologies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe biological regulation of IGIF and thus IFN-\nY\n has not been elucidated. It is known that IGIF is synthesized as a precursor protein, called \"pro-IGIF\". It has been unclear, however, how pro-IGIF is cleaved and whether its processing has biological importance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, compositions and methods capable of regulating the conversion of pro-IGIF to IGIF would be useful for decreasing IGIF and IFN-\nY\n production \nin vivo\n; and thus for ameliorating the detrimental effects of these proteins which contribute to human disorders and diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, ICE and other members of the ICE/CED-3 family have not previously been linked to the conversion of pro-IGIF to IGIF or to IFN-γ production \nin vivo.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nICE inhibitors represent a class of compounds useful for the control of inflammation or apoptosis or both. Peptide and peptidyl inhibitors of ICE have been described. \n \nPCT patent applications WO 91/15577\n \n; \n \nWO 93/05071\n \n; \n \nWO 93/09135\n \n; \n \nWO 93/14777\n \n and \n \nWO 93/16710\n \n; and \nEuropean patent application\n \n \n0 547 699\n \n. Such peptidyl inhibitors of ICE has been observed to block the production of mature IL-1β in a mouse model of inflammation (vide infra) and to suppress growth of leukemia cells \nin vitro\n (\nEstrov et al., Blood 84, 380a (1994\n)). However, due to their peptidic nature, such inhibitors are typically characterized by undesirable pharmacologic properties, such as poor cellular penetration and cellular activity, poor oral absorption, poor stability and rapid metabolism. \nPlattner, J.J. and D.W. Norbeck, in Drug Discovery Technologies, C.R. Clark and W.H. Moos, Eds. (Ellis Horwood, Chichester, England, 1990), pp. 92-126\n. This has hampered their development into effective drugs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-peptidyl compounds have also been reported to inhibit ICE \nin vitro\n. \n \nPCT patent application WO 95/26958\n \n; \n \nUS Patents 5,552,400\n \n; \nDolle et al., J. Med. Chem., 39, pp. 2438-2440 (1996\n); However, it is not clear whether these compounds have the appropriate pharmacological profile to be therapeutically useful.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, current methods for the preparation of such compounds are not advantageous. These methods use tributyltin hydride, a toxic, moisture sensitive reagent. Thus, these methods are inconvenient to carry out, pose a health risk and create toxic-waste disposal problems. Furthermore, it is difficult to purify compounds prepared by these methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, the need exists for compounds that can effectively inhibit the action of ICE \nin vivo,\n for use as agents for preventing and treating chronic and acute forms of IL-1-mediated diseases, apoptosis-, IGIF-, or IFN-γ-mediated diseases, as well as inflammatory, autoimmune, destructive bone, proliferative, infectious, or degenerative diseases. The need also exists for methods of preparing such compounds.\n\n\n \n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides novel classes of compounds, and pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof, that are useful as inhibitors of ICE. These compounds can be used alone or in combination with other therapeutic or prophylactic agents, such as antibiotics, immunomodulators or other anti-inflammatory agents, for the treatment or prophylaxis of diseases mediated by IL-1, apoptosis, IGIF or IFN-\nY\n. According to a preferred embodiment, the compounds of this invention are capable of binding to the active site of ICE and inhibiting the activity of that enzyme. Additionally, they have improved cellular potency, improved pharmacokinetics, and/or improved oral bioavailability compared to peptidyl ICE inhibitors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is a principal object of this invention to provide novel classes of compounds which are inhibitors of ICE represented by formulas:\n\n \n \n\nwherein the various substituents are described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is a further object of this invention to provide a process of preparing N-acylamino compounds by coupling a carboxylic acid with an alloc-protected amine.\n\n\n \n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \nFig. 1A\n \n ICE cleaves pro-IGIF \nin vivo\n. Cell lysates from Cos cells transfected with the various indicated expression plasmids or controls were analyzed for the presence of IGIF by separating proteins by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-IGIF antisera (\nlane\n 1, mock transfected cells; \nlane\n 2, pro-IGIF alone; lanes 3-12, pro-IGIF in combination with ICE, ICE-C285S, CPP32, CPP32-C163S, CMH-1, CMH-1-C186S, Tx, Tx-C258S, respectively). Mobilities of pro-IGIF and the 18-kDa mature IGIF are indicated on the right. Molecular weight markers in kDa are shown on the left (Example 23).\n\n\n \n \nFig. 1B\n \n ICE cleaves pro-IGIF at the authentic processing site \nin vitro\n as shown by Coomassie blue staining of proteolytic reaction products separated by SDS-PAGE (Example 23). The proteases and inhibitors used were: \nlane\n 1, buffer control; \nlane\n 2, 0.1 nM ICE; \n \nlane\n \n 3, 1 nM ICE; \n \n \nlanes\n \n \n 4 and 5, 1 nM ICE with 10 nM Cbz-Val-Ala-Asp-[(2,6-dichlorobenzoyl)oxy]methyl ketone and 100 nM Ac-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-aldehyde, respectively; \n \n \nlanes\n \n \n 6 and 7, 15 nM CPP32 with and without 400 nM Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde (\nD. W. Nicholson et al., Nature, 376, p. 37 (1995\n)), respectively; \n \nlane\n \n 8, 100 nM CMH-1; \n \nlane\n \n 9, 10 units/ml granzyme B; and M, molecular weight markers in kDa.\n\n\n \n \nFig. 1C\n \n ICE cleavage converts inactive pro-IGIF to active IGIF which induces IFN-γ production in Th1 helper cells. Uncleaved (Pro-IGIF), ICE-cleaved (Pro-IGIF/ICE), CPP32-cleaved (Pro-IGIF/CPP32), and recombinant mature IGIF (IGIF) were incubated with A.E7 Thl cells at 12 ng/ml (open bar) and 120 ng/ml (hatched bar) for eighteen hours and the levels of IFN-γ released into the culture medium assayed by ELISA (Example 23). A.E7 cells cultured with buffer, ICE alone (ICE) or CPP32 alone (CPP32) were assayed similarly for negative controls. The numbers represent the average of three determinations.\n\n\n \n \nFig. 2A\n \n Mature IGIF (18-kDa) is produced by Cos cells co-transfected with pro-IGIF and ICE-expressing plasmids. Cell lysates (left) and conditioned medium (right) from Cos cells transfected with a pro-IGIF expression plasmid in the absence (-) or presence of an expression plasmid encoding wild type (ICE) or inactive mutant (ICE-C285S) ICE. Transfected cells were metabolically labeled with \n35\nS-methionine, proteins from cell lysates and conditioned medium immunoprecipitated with anti-IGIF antisera and separated by SDS-PAGE (Example 24). Mobilities of pro-IGIF and the 18-kDa mature IGIF are indicated on the right. Molecular weight markers in kDa are shown on the left.\n\n\n \n \nFig. 2B\n \n IFN-γ inducing activity is detected in Cos cells co-transfected with pro-IGIF and ICE-expressing plasmids. Cell lysates (hatched bar) and conditioned medium (open bar) from Cos cells transfected with a pro-IGIF expression plasmid in the absence (Pro-IGIF) or presence (Pro-IGIF/ICE) of an expression plasmid encoding wild type (ICE) were assayed for IFN-\nY\n levels (ng/ml) by ELISA. Cos cells transfected with buffer (Mock) or an ICE-expressing plasmid alone (ICE) served as negative controls (Example 24).\n\n\n \n \nFig. 3A\n \n Kupffer cells from mice lacking ICE are defective in the export of IGIF. Kupffer cells from wild type mice (ICE +/+) or ICE-deficient mice homozygous for an ICE mutation (ICE-/-) were isolated and primed with LPS for three hours. The levels of immunoreactive IGIF polypeptides in the conditioned media (ng/ml) of wild type cells were measured by ELISA (Example 25). N.D. (not detectable) indicates that the IGIF concentration was less than 0.1 ng/ml.\n\n\n \n \nFig. 3B\n \n Kupffer cells from mice lacking ICE are defective in the export of mature IGIF. Kupffer cells from wild type mice (ICE +/+) or ICE deficient mice homozygous for an ICE mutation (ICE -/-) were isolated and primed with LPS for three hours. Primed cells were metabolically labeled with \n35\nS-methionine, proteins from cell lysates and conditioned medium immunoprecipitated with anti-IGIF antisera and separated by SDS-PAGE (Example 25). Mobilities of pro-IGIF and the 18-kDa mature IGIF are indicated on the right. Molecular mass markers in kDa are shown on the left.\n\n\n \n \nFig. 3C\n \n Serum from ICE-deficient mice contains reduced levels of IGIF. Serum samples from wild type mice (ICE +/+) or ICE deficient mice homozygous for an ICE mutation (ICE -/-) were assayed for IGIF levels (ng/ml) by ELISA (Example 25).\n\n\n \n \nFig. 3D\n \n Serum from ICE-deficient mice contains reduced levels of IFN-γ. Serum samples from wild type mice (ICE +/+) or ICE deficient mice homozygous for an ICE mutation (ICE -/-) were assayed for IFN-γ levels (ng/ml) by ELISA (Example 25).\n\n\n \n \nFig. 4\n \n Serum IFN-γ levels are significantly reduced in ICE-deficient mice after an acute challenge with LPS (Example 26). Serum samples from wild type mice (filled squares) or ICE-deficient mice (filled circles) were assayed for IFN-y levels (ng/ml) by ELISA as a function of time (hours) after LPS challenge. Temperatures of the animals during the time course in degrees Celcius is shown for.wild type mice (open squares) or ICE-deficient mice (open circles).\n\n\n \n \nFig. 5\n \n The ICE inhibitor, AcYVAD-aldehyde (AcYVAD-CHO), inhibits LPS-stimulated IL-1B and IFN-γ synthesis by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (P3MC). Percent (%) inhibition as a function of inhibitor concentration (µM) is shown for IL-1β (open squares) and IFN-γ (open diamonds) synthesis.\n\n\n \n \nFig. 6\n \n \nCompound\n \n214e\n inhibits IL-1β production in LPS-challenged mice. Serum samples from CD1 mice were assayed for IL-1β levels (pg/ml) by ELISA after LPS challenge. \nCompound\n \n214e\n was administered by intraperitoneal (IP) injection one hour after LPS challenge. Blood was collected seven hours after LPS challenge (see Example 7).\n\n\n \n \nFig. 7\n \n \nCompound\n \n217e\n inhibits IL-13β production in LPS-challenged mice. Serum samples from CD1 mice were assayed for IL-1β levels (pg/ml) by ELISA after LPS challenge. \nCompound\n \n217e\n was administered by intraperitoneal.(IP) injection one hour after LPS challenge. Blood was collected seven hours after LPS challenge (see Example 7).\n\n\n \n \nFig. 8\n \n \nCompound\n \n214e\n, but not compound \n217e\n, inhibits IL-1β production in LPS-challenged mice when administered by oral gavage. This assay measures oral absorption under similar conditions as those described for \nFigs. 6 and 7\n. These results indicates that \n214e\n is potentially orally active as an ICE inhibitor (see Example 7).\n\n\n \n \nFig. 9\n \n \nCompound\n \n214e\n and analogs of \n214e\n also inhibit IL-1β production after IP administration. These results were obtained in the assay described for \n \nFigs. 6\n and \n7\n \n and Example 7.\n\n\n \n \nFig. 10\n \n \nCompound\n \n214e\n, and analogs of \n214e\n, also inhibit IL-1β production after oral (PO) administration. These results were obtained in the assay described for \n \nFigs. 6\n and \n7\n \n and Example 7.\n\n\n \n \nFigs. 11A\n \n \n/B\n Compounds \n302\n and \n304a\n show detectable blood levels when administered orally (50mg/kg, in 0.5 % carboxymethylcellulose) to mice. Blood samples were collected at 1 and 7 hours after dosing. \n \nCompounds\n \n \n302\n and \n304a\n are prodrugs of \n214e\n and are metabolized to \n214e\n \nin vivo\n. \nCompound\n \n214e\n shows no blood levels above 0.10 µg/ml when administered orally (Example 8).\n\n\n \n \nFig. 12\n \n Compound \n412f\n blocks the progression of type II collagen-induced arthritis in male DBA/1J mice (\nWooley, P.H., Methods in Enzymology, 162, pp. 361-373 (1988\n) and \nGeiger, T., Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology, 11, pp. 515-522 (1993\n)). Compound \n412f\n was administered twice a day (10, 25 and 50mg/kg), approximately 7h'apart, by oral gavage. Inflammation was measured on the Arthritis Severity Score on a 1 to 4 scale of increasing severity. The scores of the two front paws were added to give the final score (see Example 21).\n\n\n \n \nFig. 13\n \n Compound \n412d\n blocks the progression of type II collagen-induced arthritis in male DBA/1J mice.

Wiley & Sons, NY, NY, 1991\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"substitute\" refers to the replacement of a hydrogen atom in a compound with a substituent group. In the present invention, those hydrogen atoms which form a part of a hydrogen bonding moiety which is capable of forming a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of Arg-341 of ICE or the carbonyl oxygen of Ser-339 of ICE are excluded from substitution. These excluded hydrogen atoms include those which comprise an -NH- group which is alpha to a -CO- group and are depicted as -NH- rather than an X group or some other designation in the following diagrams: (a) through (t), (v) through (z).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"straight chain\" refers to a contiguous unbranching string of covalently bound atoms. The straight chain may be substituted, but these substituents are not a part of the straight chain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"K\ni\n\" refers to a numerical measure of the effectiveness of a compound in inhibiting the activity of a target enzyme such as ICE. Lower values of K\ni\n reflect higher effectiveness. The K\ni\n value is a derived by fitting experimentally determined rate data to standard enzyme kinetic equations (see \nI. H. Segel, Enzyme Kinetics, Wiley-Interscience, 1975\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"patient\" as used in this application refers to any mammal, especially humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"pharmaceutically effective amount\" refers to an amount effective in treating or ameliorating an IL-1-, apoptosis-, IGIF- or IFN-y-mediated disease in a patient. The term \"prophylactically effective amount\" refers to an amount effective in preventing or substantially lessening IL-1-, apoptosis-, IGIF or IFN-y mediated diseases in a patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or adjuvant\" refers to a non-toxic carrier or adjuvant that may be administered to a patient, together with a compound of this invention, and which does not destroy the pharmacological activity thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"pharmaceutically acceptable derivative\" means any pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, or salt of such ester, of a compound of this invention or any other compound which, upon administration to a recipient, is capable of providing (directly or indirectly) a compound of this invention or an anti-ICE active metabolite or residue thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of this invention include, for example, those derived from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic and organic acids and bases. Examples of suitable acids include hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, nitric, perchloric, fumaric, maleic, phosphoric, glycolic, lactic, salicylic, succinic, toluene-p-sulfonic, tartaric, acetic, citric, methanesulfonic, formic, benzoic, malonic, naphthalene-2-sulfonic and benzenesulfonic acids. Other acids, such as oxalic, while not in themselves pharmaceutically acceptable, may be employed in the preparation of salts useful as intermediates in obtaining the compounds of the invention and their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts. Salts derived from appropriate bases include alkali metal (e.g., sodium), alkaline earth metal (e.g., magnesium), ammonium and N-(C\n1-4\n alkyl)\n4\n \n+\n salts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis invention also envisions the \"quaternization\" of any basic nitrogen-containing groups of the compounds disclosed herein. The basic nitrogen can be quaternized with any agents known to those of ordinary skill in the art including, for example, lower alkyl halides, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl chloride, bromides and iodides; dialkyl sulfates including dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl and diamyl sulfates; long chain halides such as decyl, lauryl, myristyl and stearyl chlorides, bromides and iodides; and aralkyl halides including benzyl and phenethyl bromides. Water or oil-soluble or dispersible products may be obtained by such quaternization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ICE inhibitors of this invention may contain one or more \"asymmetric\" carbon atoms and thus may occur as racemates and racemic mixtures, single enantiomers, diastereomeric mixtures and individual diastereomers. All such isomeric forms of these compounds are expressly included in the present invention. Each stereogenic carbon may be of the R or S configuration. Although specific compounds and scaffolds exemplified in this application may be depicted in a particular stereochemical configuration, compounds and scaffolds having either the opposite stereochemistry at any given chiral center or mixtures thereof are also envisioned.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ICE inhibitors of this invention may comprise ring structures which may optionally be substituted at carbon, nitrogen or other atoms by various substituents. Such ring structures may be singly or multiply substituted. Preferably, the ring structures contain between 0 and 3 substituents. When multiply substituted, each substituent may be picked independently of any other substituent as long as the combination of substituents results in the formation of a stable compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCombinations of substituents and variables envisioned by this invention are only those that result in the formation of stable compounds. The term \"stable\", as used herein, refers to compounds which possess stability sufficient to allow manufacture and administration to a mammal by methods known in the art. Typically, such compounds are stable at a temperature of 40°C or less, in the absence of moisture or other chemically reactive conditions, for at least a week.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubstituents may be represented in various forms. These various forms are known to the skilled practitioner and may be used interchangeably. For example, a methyl substituent on a phenyl ring may be represented in any of the following forms:\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious forms of substituents such as methyl are used herein interchangeably.\n\n\n \n\n\nDETAILED DESCRTPTTON OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn order that the invention herein described may be more fully understood, the following detailed description is

Serial Nos. \n \n08/575,641\n \n and \n \n08/598,332\n \n the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of this invention have a molecular weight of less than or equal to about 700 Daltons, and more preferably between about 400 and 600 Daltons. These preferred compounds may be readily absorbed by the bloodstream of patients upon oral administration. This oral availability makes such compounds excellent agents for orally-administered treatment and prevention regimens against IL-1-, apoptosis-, IGIF- or IFN-γ mediated diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt should be understood that the compounds of this invention may exist in various equilibrium forms, depending on conditions including choice of solvent, pH, and others known to the practitioner skilled in the art. All such forms of these compounds are expressly included in the present invention. In particular, many of the compounds of this invention, especially those which contain aldehyde or ketone groups in R\n3\n and carboxylic acid groups in T, may take hemi-ketal (or hemi-acetal) or hydrated forms. For example, compounds of embodiment (A) may take the forms depicted below: EQ1\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nDepending on the choice of solvent and other conditions known to the practitioner skilled in the art, compounds of this invention may also take acyloxy ketal, acyloxy acetal, ketal or acetal form:\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, it should be understood that the equilibrium forms of the compounds of this invention may include tautomeric forms. All such forms of these compounds are expressly included in the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt should be understood that the compounds of this invention may be modified by appropriate functionalities to enhance selective biological properties. Such modifications are known in the art and include those which increase biological penetration into a given biological system (e.g., blood, lymphatic system, central nervous system), increase oral availability, increase solubility to allow administration by injection, alter metabolism and alter rate of excretion. In addition, the compounds may be altered to pro-drug form such that the desired compound is created in the body of the patient as the result of the action of metabolic or other biochemical processes on the pro-drug. Such pro-drug forms typically demonstrate little or no activity in \nin vitro\n assays. Some examples of pro-drug forms include ketal, acetal, oxime, imine, and hydrazone forms of compounds which contain ketone or aldehyde groups, especially where they occur in the R\n3\n group of the compounds of this invention. Other examples of pro-drug forms include the hemi-ketal, hemi-acetal, acyloxy ketal, acyloxy acetal, ketal, and acetal forms that are described in EQ1 and EQ2.\n\n\n \n\n\nICE and TX Cleave and Thereby Activate Pro-IGIF\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ICE protease was identified previously by virtue of its ability to process inactive pro-IL-IB to' mature active IL-1B, a pro-inflammatory molecule, in \nvitro\n and \nin vivo\n. Here we show that ICE and its close homologue TX (Caspase-4, \nC. Faucheu et al., EMBO, 14, p. 1914 (1995\n)) can proteolytically cleave inactive pro-IGIF. This processing step is required to convert pro-IGIF to its active mature form, IGIF. Cleavage of pro-IGIF by ICE, and presumably by TX, also facilitates the export of IGIF out of cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe first used transient co-expression of plasmids transfected into Cos cells to determine whether any known members of the ICE/CED-3 protease family can process pro-IGIF to IGIF in cultured cells (Example 23) (\nFig. 1A\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 1A\n demonstrates that ICE cleaves pro-IGIF in Cos cells co-transfected with plasmids that express pro-IGIF in the presence of active ICE. Cos cells were transfected with an expression plasmid for pro-IGIF alone (lane 2) or in combination with the indicated expression plasmids encoding wild type or inactive mutants of ICE/CED-3 family of proteases (lanes 3-12). Cell lysates were prepared and analyzed for the presence of IGIF protein by immunoblotting with an anti-IGIF antiserum. \nLane\n 1 contained lysates from mock transfected cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCo-expression of pro-IGIF with ICE or TX resulted in the cleavage of pro-IGIF into a polypeptide similar in size to the naturally-occurring 18-kDa mature IGIF. This processing event is blocked by single point mutations that alter the catalytic cysteine residues and thus inactivate ICE and TX (\nY. Gu et al., EMBO. 14, p. 1923 (1995\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCo-expression with CPP32 (Caspase-3), a protease involved in programmed cell death (\nT. Fernandes-Alnemri et al., J. Biol. Chem., 269, p. 30761 (1994\n); \nD. W. Nicholson et al., Nature, 376, p. 37 (1995\n)), resulted in the cleavage of pro-IGIF into a smaller polypeptide, while co-expression with CMH-1 (Caspase-7), a close homolog of CPP32 (\nJ. A. Lippke et al., J. Biol, Chem., 271, p. 1825 (1996\n)), failed to cleave pro-IGIF to any significant extent. Thus, ICE and TX appear to be capable of cleaving pro-IGIF into a polypeptide similar in size to the naturally-occurring 18-kDa IGIF.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe next examined the ability of these cysteine proteases to cleave pro-IGIF \nin vitro\n using a purified, recombinant (His)\n6\n-tagged pro-IGIF as a substrate (Example 23).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 1B\n demonstrates that pro-IGIF is cleaved \nin vitro\n by ICE. Purified recombinant (His)\n6\n-tagged pro-IGIF (2 µg) was incubated with the indicated cysteine protease in the presence or absence of ICE or CPP32 inhibitors as described in Example 23. The cleavage products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nICE cleaved the 24 kDa pro-IGIF into two polypeptides of approximately 18-kDa and 6-kDa. N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the ICE cleavage products indicated that the 18-kDa polypeptide contains the same N-terminal amino acid residues (Asn-Phe-Gly-Arg-Leu) as the naturally occurring IGIF. This shows that ICE cleaves pro-IGIF at the authentic processing site (Asp35-Asn36) (\nH. Okamura et al., Infection and Immunity, 63, p. 3966 (1995\n); \nH. Okamura et al., Nature, 378, p. 88 (1995\n)). N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the CPP32 cleavage products indicated that CPP32 cleaved pro-IGIF at Asp69-I1e70.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cleavage by ICE of pro-IGIF is highly specific with a catalytic efficiency (k\ncat\n/K\n \nM\n \n) of 1.4 x 10\n7\n M\n-1\n s\n-1\n (K\n \nM\n \n = 0.6 ± 0.1 µM; \nk\n \ncat\n = 8.6 ± 0.3 s\n-1\n) and is inhibited by specific ICE inhibitors (Ac-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-aldehyde) and Cbz-Val-Ala-Asp-(:2,6-dichlorobenzoyl)oxylmethylketone, (\nN.A. Thornberry et al., Nature, 356, p. 768 (1992\n); \nR. E. Dolle et al., J. Med. Chem., 37, p. 563 (1994\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 1C\n demonstrates that ICE cleavage in \nvitro\n activates pro-IGIF. Uncleaved pro-IGIF, ICE- or CPP32-cleaved products of pro-IGIF, or recombinant mature IGIF (rIGIF) were each added to A.E7 cell cultures to a final concentration of 12 ng/ml or 120 ng/ml (see, \nExample 23\n). Eighteen hours later, IFN-γ in the cultural medium was quantified by ELISA. While the uncleaved pro-IGIF had no detectable IFN-γ inducing activity, ICE-cleaved pro-IGIF was active in inducing IFN-γ production in Thl cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLike ICE, the ICE homolog TX also cleaved pro-IGIF into similarly sized polypeptides. However, its catalytic efficiency was about two orders of magnitude lower than that shown for ICE.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConsistent with the observations from the Cos cell experiments above, CPP32 cleaved pro-IGIF at a different site (Asp69-Ile70) and the resulting polypeptides had little IFN-γ inducing activity (\nFig. 1C\n). CMH-1 and granzyme B each failed to cleave pro-IGIF to any significant extent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTogether, these results demonstrate that, both in Cos cells and \nin vitro\n,ICE and TX are capable of processing the inactive pro-IGIF precursor at the authentic maturation site to generate a biologically active IGIF molecule.\n\n\n \n\n\nProcessing of Pro-IGIF by ICE Facilitates Its Export\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIGIF is produced by activated Kupffer cells and macrophages \nin vivo\n and is exported out of the cells upon stimulation by endotoxin (\nH. Okamura et al., Infection and Immunity, 63, p. 3966 (1995\n) ; \nH. Okamura et al., Nature, 378, p. 88 (1995\n). We used the Cos cell co-expression system (Example 23) to examine whether the intracellular cleavage of pro-IGIF by ICE would facilitate the export of mature IGIF from the cell. Such is the case for pro-Ih-lβ when it is cleaved by ICE into active IL-1ß (\nN.A. Thornberry et al., Nature, 356, p. 768 (1992\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn \nFig. 2A\n, Cos cells transected with an expression plasmid for pro-IGIF alone (\nlanes\n 2 and 6) or in combination with an expression plasmid encoding wild type (\nlanes\n 3 and 7) or inactive mutant ICE (\nlanes\n 4 and 8) were metabolically labeled with \n35\nS-methionine (see, \nExample 24\n). Cell lysates (left) and conditioned medium (right) were immunoprecipitated with an anti-IGIF antiserum. The immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography (\nFig. 2A\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn 18-kDa polypeptide corresponding in size to mature IGIF was detected in the conditioned medium of Cos cells co-expressing pro-IGIF and ICE, while Cos cells co-expressing pro-IGIF and an inactive ICE mutant (ICE-C285S), or pro-IGIF alone (-) exported only very low levels of pro-IGIF and no detectable mature IGIF. We estimate that about 10% of the mature IGIF was exported from co-transfected cells, while greater than 99% of pro-IGIF was retained within the cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe also measured the presence of IFN-γ inducing activity in cell lysates and in the conditioned medium of the above transfected cells (see, \nExample 24\n). IFN-γ inducing activity was detected in both cell lysates and the conditioned medium of Cos cells co-expressing pro-IGIF and ICE, but not in cells expressing either pro-IGIF or ICE alone (\nFig. 2B\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese results indicate that ICE cleavage of pro-IGIF facilitates the export of mature, active IGIF, from cells.\n\n\n \n\n\nPro-IGIF is a Physiological Substrate of ICE In Vivo\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTo study the role of ICE in the proteolytic activation and export of IGIF under physiological conditions, we examined the processing of pro-IGIF and export of mature IGIF from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated Kupffer cells harvested from \nPropiobacterium acnes\n-elicited wild type and ICE deficient (ICE-/-) mice (\nExample 25\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFig. 3A\n, Kupffer cells from ICE-/- mice are defective in the export of IGIF. Kupffer cell lysates of wild type and ICE-/- mice contained similar amounts of IGIF as determined by ELISA. IGIF, however, could be detected only in the conditioned medium of wild type but not of the ICE-/- cells. Thus, ICE-deficient (ICE-/-) mice synthesize pro-IGIF, but fail to export it as extracellular pro-or mature IGIF.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo determine whether ICE-deficient (ICE-/-) mice process intracellular pro-IGIF but fail to export IGIF, Kupffer cells from wild type and ICE-/- mice were metabolically labeled with \n35\nS-methionine and IGIF immunoprecipitation experiments were performed on cell lysates and conditioned media as described in \nExample 25\n. These experiments demonstrated that unprocessed pro-IGIF was present in both wild type and ICE-/- Kupffer cell. However,' the 18-kDa mature IGIF was present only in the conditioned medium of wild type and not ICE-/- Kupffer cells (\n \nFig. 3B\n \n). This shows that active ICE is required in cells for the export of processed IGIF out of the cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, conditioned medium from wild type but not from ICE-/- Kupffer cells contained IFN-γ inducing activity that was not attributed to the action of IL-12 because it was insensitive to a neutralizing anti-IL-12 antibody. The absence of IGIF in the conditioned medium of ICE-/- Kupffer cells is consistent with the finding in Cos cells that the processing of pro-IGIF by ICE is required for the export of active IGIF.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigs. 3C and 3D\n show that, \nin vivo\n, ICE-/- mice have reduced serum levels of IGIF and IFN-γ, respectively. Wild type (ICE+/+) and ICE-/- mice (n=3) primed with heat-inactivated \nP\n. acnes were challenged with LPS (\nExample 26\n), and the levels of IGIF (\nFig. 3C\n) and IFN-γ (\nFig. 3D\n) in the sera of challenged mice were measured by ELISA three hours after LPS challenge (Example 25).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe sera of ICE-/- mice stimulated by P. acnes and LPS contained reduced levels of IGIF (\nFig. 3C\n) and no detectable IFN-γ inducing activity in the presence of an anti-IL-12 antibody. The reduced serum levels of IGIF likely accounts for the significantly lower levels of IFN-γ in the sera of ICE-/- mice (\nFig. 3D\n), because we have observed no significant difference in the production of IL-12 in ICE-/- mice under these conditions. Consistent with this interpretation is the finding that non-adherent splenocytes from wild type and ICE-/- mice produced similar amounts of IFN-γ when stimulated with recombinant active IGIF \nin vitro\n. Thus the impaired production of IFN-γ is not due to any apparent defect in the T cells of the ICE-/- mice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTaken together, these results establish a critical role for ICE in processing the IGIF precursor and in the export of active IGIF both \nin vitro\n and \nin vivo\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo examine in more detail the relationship between serum levels of IFN-γ and ICE activity \nin vivo,\n a time course after challenge of wild type and ICE-deficient mice with LPS was performed (\nExample 26\n) (\nFig. 4\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 4\n shows a time course increase of serum IFN-γ in wild type mice, with sustained levels of ≥17 ng/ml occurring from 9-18 hrs after LPS challenge. As predicted by the experiments discussed above, serum IFN-γ levels were significantly lower in ICE-/- mice, with a maximum of 2 ng/ml achieved over the same time period, which is approximately 15% of the level observed in wild type mice (\nFig. 4\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnimals were also observed for clinical signs of sepsis and body temperature was measured at 4-hour intervals in wild type and ICE-/- mice challenged with 30 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg LPS (ICE-/-only). Results in \nFig. 4\n show that wild type mice experienced a significant decrease in body temperature (from 36°C to 26°C) within 12 hours of LPS challenge. Signs of clinical sepsis were evident and all animals expired within 24-28 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn contrast, ICE-/- mice challenged with 30 mg/kg LPS experienced only a 3°-4°C decrease in body temperature with minimal signs of distress and with no observed lethality. ICE-/- mice challenged with 100 mg/kg LPS experienced clinical symptoms, a decrease in body temperature, and mortality similar to wild type mice at the 30 mg/kg LPS dose.\n\n\n \nThe ICE Inhibitor Ac-YVAD-CHO is an Equipotent \nInhibitor of IL-1ß and IFN-γ Production\n \n\n\n \n \n \nSince the processing and secretion of biologically active IGIF is mediated by ICE, we compared the activity of a reversible ICE inhibitor (Ac-YVAD-CHO) on IL-lβ and IFN-γ production in a peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) assay (\nExamples 27\n) .\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults in \nFig. 5\n show a similar potency for the ability of the Ac-YVAD-CHO ICE inhibitor to decrease IL-lβ and IFN-γ production in human PBMCs, with an IC\n50\n of 2.5 µM for each. Similar results were obtained in studies with wild type mouse splenocytes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese findings provide additional evidence that pro-IGIF is a physiological substrate for ICE and suggest that ICE inhibitors will be useful tools for controlling physiological levels of IGIF and IFN-γ.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn summary, we have found that ICE controls IGIF and IFN-γ levels \nin vivo\n and \nin vitro\n and that ICE inhibitors can decrease levels of IGIF and IFN-γ in human cells. These results have been described in co-pending United States Application Serial No. \n \n08/712,878\n \n, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \n\n\nCompositions and Methods\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions and methods of this invention will be useful for controlling IL-l, IGIF and IFN-γ levels \nin vivo\n. The methods and compositions of this invention will thus be useful for treating or reducing the advancement, severity of effects of IL-l, IGIF- and IFN-γ-mediated conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of this invention are effective ligands for ICE. Accordingly, these compounds are capable of targeting and inhibiting events in IL-l-, apoptosis-, IGIF-, and IFN-γ-mediated diseases, and, thus, the ultimate activity of that protein in inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, destructive bone, proliferative disorders, infectious diseases, and degenerative diseases. For example, the compounds of this invention inhibit the conversion of precursor IL-1β to mature IL-1β by inhibiting ICE. Because ICE is essential for the production of mature IL-l, inhibition of that enzyme effectively blocks initiation of IL-1-mediated physiological effects and symptoms, such as inflammation, by inhibiting the production of mature IL-l. Thus, by inhibiting IL-1β precursor activity, the compounds of this invention effectively function as IL-l inhibitors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilarly, compounds of this invention inhibit the conversion of precursor IGIF to mature IGIF. Thus, by inhibiting IGIF production, the compounds of this invention effectively function as inhibitors of IFN-γ production.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, one embodiment of this invention provides a method for decreasing IGIF production in a subject comprising the step of administering to the subject a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of an ICE inhibitor and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother embodiment of this invention provides a method for decreasing IFN-γ production in a subject comprising the step of administering to the subject a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of an ICE inhibitor and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the methods of this invention comprise the step of administering to a subject a pharmaceutical composition comprising an inhibitor of an ICE-related protease that is capable of cleaving pro-IGIF to active IGIF, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. One such ICE-related protease is TX, as described above. This invention thus provides methods and pharmaceutical compositions for controlling IGIF and IFN-γ levels by administering a TX inhibitor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther ICE-related proteases capable of processing pro-IGIF into an active IGIF form may also be found. Thus it is envisioned that inhibitors of those enzymes may be identified by those of skill in the art and will also fall within the scope of this invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of this invention may be employed in a conventional manner for the treatment of diseases which are mediated by IL-l, apoptosis, IGIF or IFN-γ Such methods of treatment, their dosage levels and requirements may be selected by those of ordinary skill in the art from available methods and techniques. For example, a compound of this invention may be combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant for administration to a patient suffering from an IL-l-, apoptosis-, IGIF- or IFN-γ-mediated disease in a pharmaceutically acceptable manner and in an amount effective to lessen the severity of that disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the compounds of this invention may be used in compositions and methods for treating or protecting individuals against IL-1-, apoptosis-, IGIF- or IFN-γ-mediated diseases over extended periods of time. The compounds may be employed in such compositions either alone or together with other compounds of this invention in a manner consistent with the conventional utilization of ICE inhibitors in pharmaceutical compositions. For example, a compound of this invention may be combined with pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvants conventionally employed in vaccines and administered in prophylactically effective amounts to protect individuals over an extended period of time against IL-l-, apoptosis-, IGIF- or IFN-γ- mediated diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of this invention may also be co-administered with other ICE inhibitors to increase the effect of therapy or prophylaxis against various IL-l-, apoptosis, IGIF- or IFN-γ-mediated diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, the compounds of this invention may be used in combination either conventional anti-inflammatory agents or with matrix metalloprotease inhibitors, lipoxygenase inhibitors and antagonists of cytokines other than IL-1β.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of this invention can also be administered in combination with immunomodulators (e.g., bropirimine, anti-human alpha interferon antibody, IL-2, GM-CSF, methionine enkephalin, interferon alpha, diethyldithiocarbamate, tumor necrosis factor, naltrexone and rEPO) or with prostaglandins, to prevent or combat IL-l-mediated disease symptoms such as inflammation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the compounds of this invention are administered in combination therapies with other agents, they may be administered sequentially or concurrently to the patient. Alternatively, pharmaceutical or prophylactic compositions according to this invention comprise a combination of an ICE inhibitor of this invention and another therapeutic or prophylactic agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions of this invention comprise any of the compounds of the present invention, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, with any pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant or vehicle.

The following components are mixed:\n\n \n \n \n65 µl buffer(10mM Tris, 1mM DTT, 0.1% CHAPS @pH8.1) 10 µl ICE (2 - 10 nM final concentration) 5 µl DMSO/\ninhibitor solution\n \n20 \nµl\n \n 150 µM Substrate (30 µM final) 100µl total reaction volume\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe assay is run in a 96 well microtiter plate. Buffer and ICE are added to the wells. The components are left to incubate at 37 °C for 15 minutes in a temperature-controlled wellplate. After the 15 minute incubation, the reaction is started by adding substrate directly to the wells and the reaction is monitored @37 °C for 30 minutes by following the release of the AMC fluorophore using an excitation wavelength for 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. A linear fit of the data for each well is performed and a rate is determined in fluorescence units per second.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor determination of enzyme inhibition constants (K\ni\n) or the mode of inhibition (competitive, uncompetitive or noncompetitive), the rate data determined in the enzyme assays at varying inhibitor concentrations are computer-fit to standard enzyme kinetic equations (see \nI. H. Segel, Enzyme Kinetics, Wiley-Interscience, 1975\n) .\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe determination of second order rate constants for irreversible inhibitors was performed by fitting the fluorescence vs time data to the progress equation of Morrison. \nMorrison, J.F., Mol. cell. Biophys., 2, pp. 347-368 (1985\n) . Thornberry et al. have published a description of these methods for measurement of rate constants of irreversible inhibitors of ICE. \nThornberry, N.A., et al. Biochemistry, 33, pp. 3923-3940 (1994\n). For compounds where no prior complex formation can be observed kinetically, the second order rate constants (k\ninact\n) are derived directly from the slope of the linear plots of k\nobs\n vs. [I]. For compounds where prior complex formation to the enzyme can be detected, the hyperbolic plots of k\nobs\n vs. [I], are fit to the equation for saturation kinetics to first generate K\ni\n and k'. The second order rate constant k\ninact\n is then given by k' /K\ni\n .\n\n\n \n3\n.\n \nPBMC Cell assay\n \n\n\n \n \n \nIL-1β Assay with a Mixed Population of Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) or Enriched Adherent Mononuclear Cells\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProcessing of pre-IL-1β by ICE can be measured in cell culture using a variety of cell sources. Human PBMC obtained from healthy donors provides a mixed population of lymphocyte subtypes and mononuclear cells that produce a spectrum of interleukins and cytokines in response to many classes of physiological stimulators. Adherent'mononuclear cells from PBMC provides an enriched source of normal monocytes for selective studies of cytokine production by activated cells.\n\n\n \nExperimental Procedure:\n\n\n \n \n \nAn initial dilution series of test compound in DMSO or ethanol is prepared, with a subsequent dilution into RPMI-10% FBS media (containing 2 mM L-glutamine, 10 mM HEPES, 50 U and 50 ug/ml pen/strep) respectively to yield drugs at 4x the final test concentration containing 0.4% DMSO or 0.4% ethanol. The final concentration of DMSO is 0.1% for all drug dilutions. A concentration titration which brackets the apparent K\ni\n for a test compound determined in an ICE inhibition assay is generally used for the primary compound screen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally 5-6 compound dilutions are tested and the cellular component of the assay is performed in duplicate, with duplicate ELISA determinations on each cell culture supernatant.\n\n\n \nPBMC Isolation and IL-1 Assay:\n\n\n \n \n \nBuffy coat cells isolated from one pint human blood (yielding 40-45 ml final volume plasma plus cells) are diluted with media to 80 ml and LeukoPREP separation tubes (Becton Dickinson) are each overlaid with 10 ml of cell suspension. After 15 min centrifugation at 1500-1800 xg, the plasma/media layer is aspirated and then the mononuclear cell layer is collected with a Pasteur pipette and transferred to a 15 ml conical centrifuge tube (Corning). Media is added to bring the volume to 15 ml, gently mix the cells by inversion and centrifuge at 300 xg for 15 min. Resuspend the PBMC pellet in a small volume of media, count cells and adjust to 6 x 10\n6\n cells/ml.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the cellular assay, 1.0 ml of the cell suspension is added to each well of a 24-well flat bottom tissue culture plate (Corning), 0.5 ml test compound dilution and 0.5 ml LPS solution (Sigma #L-3012; 20 ng/ml solution prepared in complete RPMI media; \nfinal LPS concentration\n 5 ng/ml). The 0.5 ml additions of test compound and LPS are usually sufficient to mix the contents of the wells. Three control mixtures are run per experiment, with either LPS alone, solvent vehicle control, and/or additional media to adjust the final culture volume to 2.0 ml. The cell cultures are incubated for 16-18 hr at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO\n2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt the end of the incubation period, cells are harvested and transferred to 15 ml conical centrifuge tubes. After centrifugation for 10 min at 200 xg, supernatants are harvested and transferred to 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes. It may be noted that the cell pellet may be utilized for a biochemical evaluation of pre-IL-1β and/or mature IL-1β content in cytosol extracts by western blotting or ELISA with pre-IL-1β specific antisera.\n\n\n \nIsolation of Adherent Mononuclear cells:\n\n\n \n \n \nPBMC are isolated and prepared as described above. Media (1.0 ml) is first added to wells followed by 0.5 ml of the PBMC suspension. After a one hour incubation, plates are gently shaken and nonadherent cells aspirated from each well. Wells are then gently washed three times with 1.0 ml of media and final resuspended in 1.0 ml media. The enrichment for adherent cells generally yields 2.5-3.0 \nx\n 10\n5\n cells per well. The addition of test compounds, LPS, cell incubation conditions and processing of supernatants proceeds as described above.\n\n\n \nELISA:\n\n\n \n \n \nWe have used Quantikine kits (R&D Systems) for measurement of mature IL-1β. Assays are performed according to the manufacturer's directions. Mature IL-1β levels of about 1-3 ng/ml in both PBMC and adherent mononuclear cell positive controls are observed. ELISA assays are performed on 1:5, 1:10 and 1:20 dilutions of supernatants from LPS-positive controls to select the optimal dilution for supernatants in the test panel.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe inhibitory potency of the compounds can be represented by an IC\n50\n value, which is the concentration of inhibitor at which 50% of mature IL-1β is detected in the supernatant as compared to the positive controls.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe skilled practitioner realizes that values obtained in cell assays, such as those described. herein, can depend on multiple factors, such as cell type, cell source, growth conditions and.the like.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPharmacokinetic Studies in the Mouse\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nPeptidyl ICE inhibitors are cleared rapidly with clearance rates greater than 100 µ/min/kg.

Drug (10mg/mL) was administered via the jugular vein in a vehicle usually consisting of: propylene glycol/saline, containing 100mM sodium bicarbonate in a 1:1 ratio.

The blood was centrifuged to plasma and stored at -20' °C until analysis.

Aliquot 0.25ml of blood into 1.5 ml eppendorf tubes. Note: be sure to invert the whole blood sample tubes after every two aliquots. Differences in replicates may result if the cells sediment and are not uniformly suspended. Use of a positive displacement pipette will also minimize differences between replicate aliquots.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrepare drug dilutions in sterile pyrogen-free saline by serial dilution. A dilution series which brackets the apparent K\ni\n for a test compound determined in an ICE inhibition assay is generally used for the primary compound screen. For extremely hydrophobic compounds, we have prepared compound dilutions in fresh plasma obtained from the same blood donor or in PBS-containing 5% DMSO to enhance solubility.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdd 25 µl test compound dilution or vehicle control and gently mix the sample. Then add 5.0 µl LPS solution (250 ng/ml stocked prepared fresh: 5.0 ng/ml final concentration LPS), and mix again. Incubate the tubes at 30 °C in a water bath for 16-18 hr with occasional mixing. Alternatively, the tubes can be placed in a rotator set at 4 rpm for the same incubation period. This assay should be set up in duplicate or triplicate with the following controls: negative control- no LPS; positive control- no test inhibitor; vehicle control- the highest concentration of DMSO or compound solvent used in the experiment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional saline is added to all control tubes to normalize volumes for both control and experimental whole blood test samples\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter the incubation period, whole blood samples are centrifuged for 10 minutes at - 2000 rpm in the microfuge, plasma is transferred to a fresh microfuge tube and centrifuged at 1000 x g to pellet residual platelets if necessary. Plasma samples may be stored frozen at -70 °C prior to assay for cytokine levels by ELISA.\n\n\n \n\n\nELISA:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nWe have used R & D Systems (614 McKinley Place N.E. Minneapolis, MN 55413) Quantikine kits for measurement of IL-1β and TNF-α. The assays are performed according to the manufacturer's directions. We have observed IL-1β levels of - 1-5 ng/ml in positive controls among a range of individuals. A 1:200 dilution of plasma for all samples has been sufficient in our experiments for ELISA results to fall on the linear range of the ELISA standard curves. It may be necessary to optimize standard dilutions if you observe differences in the whole blood assay. \nNerad, J.L. et al., J.

Isolation of ICE homologs\n\n\n \n \n \nExpression of TX in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system. We have subcloned Tx cDNA (Faucheu et al., \nsupra\n 1995) into a modified pVL1393 transfer vector, co-transfected the resultant plasmid (pVL1393/TX) into insect cells with viral DNA and identified the recombinant baculovirus. After the generation of high titer recombinant virus stock, the medium was examined for TX activity using the visible ICE assay. Typically, infection of Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells at an MOI of 5 with recombinant virus stock resulted in a maximum expression after 48 hours of 4.7µg/ml. ICE was used as a standard in the assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmino terminal T7 tagged versions of ICE or TX were also expressed. Designed originally to assist the identification and purification of the recombinant proteins, the various constructs have also allowed examination of different levels of expression and of the relative levels of apoptosis experienced by the different homologs. Apoptosis in the infected Sf9 cells (examined using a Trypan Blue exclusion assay) was increased in the lines expressing ICE or TX relative to cells infected with the viral DNA alone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExpression and purification of N-terminally (His)\n6\n-tagged CPP32 in \nE\n. \ncoli.\n A cDNA encoding a CPP32 (Fernandes-Alnemri et al, \nsupra\n 1994) polypeptide starting at Ser (29) was PCR amplified with primers that add in frame XhoI sites to both the 5' and 3' ends of the cDNA and the resulting XhoI fragment ligated into a Xho I-cut pET-15b expression vector to create an in frame fusion with (his)\n6\n tag at the n-terminus of the fusion protein.

Cells were harvested two hours after IPTG addition. Lysates were prepared and soluble proteins were purified by Ni-agarose chromatography. All of the expressed CPP32 protein was in the processed form. N-terminal sequencing analysis indicated that the processing occurred at the authentic site between Asp (175) and Ser (176). Approximately 50 µg of CPP32 protein from 200 ml culture. As determined by active site titration, the purified proteins were fully active. The protease preparation were also very active \nin vitro\n in cleaving PARP as well as the synthetic DEVD-AMC substrate (Nicholson et al, \nsupra\n 1995).\n\n\n \n2.

ICE enzyme assays were performed according to Wilson et al (\nsupra\n 1994) using a YVAD-AMC substrate (Thornberry et al, \nsupra\n 1992). Assay of TX activity was performed using the ICE substrate under identical conditions to ICE. Assay of CPP32 was performed using a DEVD-AMC substrate (Nicholson et al., \nsupra\n 1995). In general, there is low selectivity between ICE and TX for a wide range of scaffolds. None of the synthetic ICE compounds tested are effective inhibitors of CPP32.

However, a clear dose response was not apparent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nCompounds\n \n 214e and 217e (50 mg/kg) were also administered by oral gavage to assess absorption. Results in \nFig. 8\n show that 214e, but not 217e when administered orally inhibited IL-1β secretion, suggesting potential for oral efficacy of ICE inhibitors as anti-inflammatory agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe efficacy of analogs of 214e were also evaluated in LPS challenged mice after IP administration (\nFig. 9\n) and PO administration (\nFig. 10\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable 3\n \n % Inhibition of IL-β production by analogs of 214e in LPs-chellenged mice after PO and IP administration (50 mg/kg).\n\n \n \nTable 3\n \n \n \n \nCompound\n \nPO% Inhibition\n \n \nIP% Inhibition\n \n \n \n \n \n214e\n \n75\n \n78\n \n \n \n265\n \n27\n \n30\n \n \n \n416\n \n52\n \n39\n \n \n \n434\n \n80\n \n74\n \n \n \n438\n \n13\n \n90\n \n \n \n442\n \n10\n \n0\n \n \n \n2002\n \n-\n \n78\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \nTable 4\n \n \n \n \nComparison of 214e Prodrugs for Efficacy in LPS Challenged Mice:\n\nTime Course Inhibition of IL-1β Production\n \n \n \nTime of Compound Administration\n\n(relative to time of LPS challenge, PO, 50 mg/kg\n \n \n \nCompound\n \n-2 hr\n \n-1 \nhr\n \n \n0 hr\n \n+1 \nhr\n \n \n \n \n \n214e\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n55%\n \n \n \n \n \n39*\n \n-*\n \n80*\n \n75*\n \n \n \n \n \n43*\n \n44*\n \n48*\n \n11*\n \n \n \n \n \n-*\n \n—*\n \n-*\n \n47*\n \n \n \n304a\n \n30\n \n. 33\n \n68\n \n37\n \n \n \n2100e\n \n49\n \n54\n \n94\n \n66\n \n \n \n \n2100a\n \n \n8\n \n71\n \n67\n \n58\n \n \n \n \n213e\n \n \n0\n \n48\n \n41\n \n89\n \n \n \n302\n \no\n \n27\n \n21\n \n26\n \n \n \n \n2100c\n \n \n0\n \n0\n \n85\n \n40\n \n \n \n2100d\n \n42\n \n35\n \n52\n \n26\n \n \n \n \n2100b\n \n \n0\n \n0\n \n47\n \n26\n \n \n \n2001\n \n-63\n \n-62\n \n∼57\n \n-54\n \n \n \n \n \n64*\n \n62*\n \n58*\n \n55*\n \n \n \n \n \n* Values obtained in subsequent assays\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\nExample 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasurement of blood levels of prodrugs of 214e.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMice were administered a p.o. dose of \n \ncompounds\n \n 302 and 304a (50 mg/kg) prepared in 0.5 % carboxymethylcellulose.

The resin was washed with DMF (3 x 1 mL) and N-methypyrrolidone (3 x 1 mL).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nStep D. Method\n 1.\n [3\nS\n(1\nS\n,9\nS\n)]-3-(6,10-Dioxo-1,2,3,4,7,8,9,10-octahydro-9-(thiophene-3-carbonylamino)-6H-pyridazine[l,2-a][1,2]diazepine-1-carboxamido)-4-oxobutanoic acid (409). Resin 403 was acylated with a solution of 0.4M thiophene-3-carboxylic acid and 0.4M HOBT in N-methypyrrolidone (1 mL), a solution of 0.4M HBTU in N-methylpyrrolidone (0.5 mL) and a solution of 1.6M DIEA in \nN\n-methypyrrolidone (0.35 mL) and the reaction was shaken for 2 hr at rt. The acylation step was repeated. Finally, the resin was washed with DMF (3 x 1 mL), CH\n2\nCl\n2\n (3 x 1 mL) and dried \nin vacuo.\n The aldehyde was cleaved from the resin and globally deprotected by treatment with 95% TFA/5* H\n2\nO (v/v, 1.5 mL' for 30 min at rt. After washing the resin with cleavage reagent (1 mL), the combined filtrates were added to cold 1:1 Et\n2\nO:pertane (12 mL) and the resulting precipitate was isolated by centrifugation and decantation. The resulting pellet was dissolved in 10% CH\n3\nCN/90% H\n2\nO/0.1% TFA (15 mL) and lyophilized to obtain crude 409 as a white powder. The compound was purified by semi-prep RP-HPLC with a Rainin Microsorb™ C18 column (5 µ, 21.4 x 250 mm) eluting with a linear CH\n3\nCN gradient (5% - 45%) containing 0.1% TFA (v/v) over 45 min at 12 mL/min. Fractions containing the desired product were pooled and lyophilized to provide 409 (10.8 mg, 63%).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nStep D. Method 1A\n. \nSynthesis of 418.\n Following a similar, procedure as \nmethod\n 1, resin 403 was acylated with 4-(1-fluorenylmethoxycarbonylamino)benzoic acid and repeated. The Fmoc group was removed as described in Step C and the free amine was acetylated with 20% (v/v) AC\n2\nO in DMF (1 mL) and 1.6M DIEA in \nN-\nmethylpyrrolidone (0.35 mL) for 2 hr at rt. The acetylation step was repeated. Cleavage of the aldehyde from the resin gave 418 (3.2 mg).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nStep D. Method 1B\n. \nSynthesis of 447.\n Following a similar procedure as method 1A, resin 403 was acylated with 0.4M 4-(1-fluorenylmethoxycarbonylamino)benzoic acid. The acylation step was repeated once. The Fmoc group was removed as before and the free amine was reacted with 1M methanesulfonyl chloride in CH\n2\nCl\n2\n (0.5 mL) and 1M pyridine in CH\n2\nCl\n2\n (0.60 mL) for 4 hr at rt. Cleavage of the aldehyde from the resin gave 447 (10.0 mg).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nStep D. Method\n 2. Synthesis of 214e.\n Following a similar procedure as \nmethod\n 1, resin 403 was acylated with 0.5M benzoyl chloride in N-methypyrrolidone (1 mL) and 1.6M DIEA in N-methypyrrolidone (0.35 mL) for 2 hr at rt. The acylation step was repeated. Cleavage of the aldehyde from the resin gave 214e (5.1 mg, 30%).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nStep D. Method\n 3. Synthesis of 427.\n Following a similar procedure as \nmethod\n 1, resin 403 was reacted with 1.OM benzenesulfonyl chloride in CH\n2\nCl\n2\n (0.5 mL) and 1M pyridine in CH\n2\nCl\n2\n (0.60 mL) for 4 hr at rt. The reaction was repeated. Cleavage of the aldehyde from the resin gave 427 (7.2 mg, 40%).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nStep D. Method\n 4. Synthesis of 420.\n Following a similar procedure as \nmethod\n 1, resin 403 was reacted with 0.5M methylisocyanate in \nN\n-methypyrrolidone (1 mL) and 1.6M DIEA in \nN\n-methypyrrolidone (0.35 mL) for 2 hr at rt. The reaction was repeated. Cleavage of the aldehyde from the resin gave 420 (8.3 mg, 55%).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nStep D. Method\n 5. Synthesis of 445.\n Following a similar procedure at \nmethod\n 1, resin 403 was acylated with 0.27M imidazole-2-carboxylic acid (1 mL) in 2:1 DMF:H\n2\nO (with 1 eq. DIEA) and 1M 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) in 2:1 \nN\n-methypyrrolidone/H\n2\nO (0.35 mL) for 3 hr at rt. Cleavage of the aldehyde from the resin gave 445 (9.5 mg).\n\n\n \nAnalytical HPLC methods:\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n(1) Waters DeltaPak C18, 300A (5µ, 3.9 x 150 mm).

The acylation step was repeated. Finally, the resin was washed with dimethylformamide (3 \nX\n 1 mL)\n,\n dichloromethane (3 \nX\n 1 mL) and dried in \nvacuo.\n The aldehyde was cleaved from the resin and globally deprotected by treatment with 95% TFA/ 5% H2O (v/v, 1.5 mL) for 30 min at room temperature. After washing the resin with cleavage reagent (1 mL), the combined filtrates were added to cold 1:1 ether:pentane (12 mL) and the resulting precipitate was isolated by centrifugation and decantation. The resulting pellet was dissolved in 10% acetonitrile/90% H2O/0.1% TFA (15 mL) and lyophilized to obtain crude 624 as a white powder.

Mice were immunized by intradermal injection (50 µl; 100\nµ\nl CII per mouse) of \ncollagen emulsion\n 21 days later at the contra-lateral side of the tail base. Drugs were administered twice a day (10, 25 and 50 mg/kg) by oral gavage approximately 7 h apart. Vehicles used included ethanol/PEG/water, β-cyclodextrin, labrosol/water or cremophor/water. Drug treatments were initiated within 2 h of the CII booster immunization..

Okamura et al., Nature, 378, p. 88 (1995\n) was ligated into the mammalian expression vector pCDLSRα (\nY. Takebe et al., Mol. Cell Biol., 8, p. 466 (1988\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, plasmids (3 µg) encoding active ICE (above), or the three ICE-related enzymes TX, CPF32, and CMH-1 in the pCDLSRα expression vector (\nC. Faucheu et al . , EMBO. 14, p. 1914 (1995\n) ; \nY. Gu et al . , EMBO, 14, p. 1923 (1995\n); \nJ. A. Lippke et al., J. Biol, Chem., 271, p. 1825 (1996\n)), were transfected into subconfluent monolayers of Cos cells in 35-mm dishes using the DEAE-dextran method (\nY. Gu et al., EMBO J.. 14, p. 1923 (1995\n)). Twenty-four hours later, cells were lysed and the lysates subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using an antiserum specific for IGIF (\nH. Okamura et al., Nature, 378, p. 88 (1995\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolymerase chain reaction was used to introduce Nde I sites at the 5' and 3' ends of the murine pro-IGIF cDNA using the following primers: GGAATTCCATATGGCTGCCATGTCAGAAGAC (forward) and GGTTAACCATATGCTAACTTTGATGTAAGTTAGTGAG (reverse). The resulting NdeI fragment was ligated into \nE. coli\n expression vector pET-15B(Novagen) at the NdeI site to create a plasmid that directs the synthesis of a polypeptide of 213 amino acids consisting of a 21-residue peptide (MGSS\nHHHHHH\nSSG,\nLVPRGS\nHM, where LVPRGS represents a thrombin cleavage site) fused in-frame to the N-terminus of pro-IGIF at Ala2, as confirmed by DNA sequencing of the plasmid and by N-terminal sequencing of the expressed proteins. E. coli strain BL21(DE3) carrying the plasmid was induced with 0.8 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyrancside for 1.5 hours at 37°C, harvested, and lysed by microfluidization (Microfluidic, Watertown, MA) in Buffer A (20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 300 mM NaCl, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2.5 µg/ml leupeptin). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 100,000 x g for 30 min. (His)6-tagged pro-IGIF protein was then purified from the supernatant by Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) chromatography under conditions recommended by the manufacturer.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn Vitro pro-IGIF Cleavage Reactions\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn vitro\n cleavage reactions (30 ul) contained 2 pg of purified pro-IGIF and various concentrations of the purified proteases in a buffer containing 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF and 2.5 ug/ml leupeptin and were incubated for 1 hour at 37°C. Conditions for cleavage by granzyme B were as described previously (\nY. Gu et al., J. Biol. Chem., 271, p. 10816 (1996\n)). Cleavage products were analyzed by SDS-FAGE on 16% gels and Coomassie Blue staining, and were subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing using an ABI automated peptide sequencer under conditions recommended by the manufacturer.\n\n\n \n\n\nKinetic Parameters of IGIF Cleavage by ICE\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe kinetic parameters (k\ncat\n/K\nM\n, K\nM\n, and k\ncat\n) for IGIF cleavage by ICE were determined as follows. \n35\nS-methionine-labeled pro-IGIF (3000 cpm, prepared by in vitro transcription and translation using, the TNT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) and pro-IGIF cDNA in a pSP73 vector as template) were incubated in reaction mixtures of 60 µl containing 0.1 to 1 nM recombinant ICE and 190 nM to 12 µM of unlabeled pro-IGIF for 8-10 min at 37°C. Cleavage product concentrations were determined by SDS-PAGE and PhosphoImager analyses. The kinetic parameters were calculated by nonlinear regression fitting of the rate vs. concentration data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the program Enzfitter (Biosoft).\n\n\n \n\n\nIFN-v Induction Assays\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA.E7 Th1 cells (\nH.

Transfected Cos cells (3.5 x 10\n5\n cells in a 35-mm dish) were labeled for 7 hours with 1 ml of methionine-free DMEM containing 2.5% normal DMEM, 1% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 300 µci/ml \n35\n S-methionine (\n35\ns-Express Protein Labeling-Mix, New England Nuclear). Cell lysates (prepared in 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mM N-ethylmaleimide, 1 mM PMSF, 2.5 µg/ml leupeptine) or conditioned medium were immunoprecipitated with an antiIGIF antibody that recognizes both the precursor and the mature forms of IGIF (\nH. Okamura et al., Nature, 378, p. 88 (1995\n)). Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and fluorography (\nFig. 2A\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe also measured the presence of IFN-γ inducing activity in the cell lysates and the conditioned media of transfected cells (\nFig. 2B\n). Transfected Cos cells (3.5 x 10\n5\n cells in a 35-mm dish) were grown in 1 ml medium for 18 hours. Media was harvested and used at 1:10 final dilution in the IFN-y induction assay (Example 23). Cos cell pellets from the same transfection were lysed in 100 µl of 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, by freeze-\nthawing\n 3 times.

Okamura et al., Infection and Immunity, 63, p. 3966 (1995\n)). Kupffer cells were prepared seven days later according to Tsutsui et al. (\nH. Tsutsui et al., Hepato-Gastroenterol., 39, p. 553 (1992\n)) except a nycodenz gradient was used instead cf metrizamide. For each experiment, Kupffer cells from 2-3 animals were pooled and cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1 µg/ml LPS. Cell lysates and conditioned medium were prepared 3 hours later.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nKupffer cells from wild type and ICE-/- mice were metabolically labeled with \n35\nS-methionine as for Cos cells (described above in Example 24) except that methionine-free RPMI 1640 was used in place of DMEM. IGIF- immunoprecipitation experiments were performed on cell lysates and conditioned media and immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography as described in Example 23.

PBMC were added (3 x 10\n6\n/well) to 24 well Corning tissue culture plates and after 1 hr incubation at 37°C, non-adherent cells were removed by gently washing. Adherent mononuclear cells were stimulated with LPS (1 µg/ml) with or without ICE inhibitor in 2 ml RPMI-1640-10% FBS. After 16-18 hr incubation at 37°C, IGIF and IFN-y were quantitated in culture supernatants by ELISA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, we obtained the following data for compound 412 of this invention using the methods described herein.

The following illustrates a preferred method:\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo a solution of A (1.1 equivalent) in CH\n2\nCl\n2\n (or DMF, or CH\n2\nCl\n2\n:DMF (1:1)) is added triphenylphosphine (0-0.5 equivalent), a nucleophilic scavenger (2-50 equivalents) and tetrakistriphenylphosphine palladium(0) (0.05-0.1 equivalent) at ambient temperature under inert atmosphere (nitrogen or argon). After 10 minutes, the above reaction mixture is optionally concentrated, then a solution of acid A-I or A-II in CH\n2\nCl\n2\n (or DMF, or CH\n2\nCl\n2:\nDMF (1:1)) is added followed by addition of HOBT (1.1 equivalent) and EDC (1.1 equivalent). The resulting reaction mixture is allowed to stir at \nambient temperature\n 1 hour-48 hours to provide coupled products C-I or C-II.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious nucleophilic scavengers may be used in the above process. \nMerzouk and Guibe, Tetrahedron Letters, 33, pp. 477-480 (1992\n); \nGuibe and Balavoine, Journal of Organic chemistry, 52, pp. 4984-4993 (1987\n)). Preferred nucleophilic scavengers that may be used include: dimedone, morpholine, trimethylsilyl dimethylamine and dimethyl barbituric acid. More preferred nuclophilic scavengers are trimethylsilyl dimethylamine (2-5 equivalents) and dimethyl barbituric (5-50 equivalents). When the nucleophilic scavenger is trimethylsilyl dimethylamine, the above reaction mixture must be concentrated prior to addition of A-I or A-II.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther compounds of this invention may be prepared by hydrolyzing compounds represented by C-I and C-II to compounds represented by H-I and H-II as described in the following scheme:\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe hydrolysis may be carried out under various conditions, provided that the conditions include an acid and H\n2\nO. Acids that may be used include p-toluensulfonic, methanesulfonic acid, sulfuric, perchloric, trifluoroacetic, and hydrochloric. For example, trifluoroacetic acid (1-90% by weight) or hydrochloric acid (0.1-30% by weight) in CH\n3\nCN/H\n2\nO (1-90% H\n2\nO by weight) at between 0-50 °C may be used.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample

Synthesis of 401.\n TentaGel S® NH\n2\n resin (0.25 mmol/g, 5.25 g) was placed in a sintered glass shaker vessel and washed with dimethylacetamide (3 X 15 mL). Compound 400 (1.36 g, 2.3 mmol) was dissolved in DMA (10 mL) and O-benzotriazole-N,N,N,N'-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU; 0.88 g, 2.3 mmol), and DIEA (0.8 mL, 4.6 mmol) were added. The solution was transferred to the resin and a further 5 mL DMA added. The reaction mixture was agitated for 1.5 h at room temperature using a wrist arm shaker. The resin was filtered and washed with dimethylacetamide (4 X 15 mL).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nStep B. Synthesis of 1102.\n Resin 401 was deprotected with 20% (v/v) piperidine/dimethylacetamide .(15 mL) for 10 min (shaking) and then for 10 min with fresh piperidine reagent (15 ml). The resin was then washed with dimethylacetamide (6 X 15 ml), followed by N-methypyrrolidone (2 X 25 mL).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompound 1101 (0.979 g, 2.11 mmol) was dissolved in dimethylacetamide (8 mL). HBTU (0.81 g, 2.1 mmol) and DIEA (0.75 mL, 4.3 mmol) were added and the solution added to the resin, followed by dimethylacetamide (4 mL). The reaction mixture was agitated for 2 h at room temperature using a wrist arm shaker. The resin work-up was performed as described for 401 to yield 1102.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nStep C. Synthesis of 1103.\n This compound was prepared from resin 1102 (0.040 mmol) using an Advanced ChemTech 396 Multiple Peptide synthesizer. The automated cycles consisted of a resin wash with dimethylformamide (2 \nX\n 1 mL), deprotection with 25% (v/v) piperidine in dimethylformamide (1 mL) for 3 min followed by fresh reagent (1 mL) for 10 min to yield resin 1103. The resin was washed with dimethylformamide (3 \nX\n 1 mL) and N-methypyrrolidone (3 \nX\n 1 mL).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResin 1103 was acylated with a solution of 0.4M carboxylic acid and 0.4M HOBT in N-methypyrrolidone (0.5 mL), a solution of 0.4M HBTU in N-methylpyrrolidone (0.5 mL) and a solution of 1.6M DIEA in N-methypyrrolidone (0.25 mL) and the reaction was shaken for 2 hr at room temperature. The acylation step was repeated. Finally, the resin was washed with N-methylpyrrolidone (1 \nX\n 1 mL), dimethylformamide (4 \nX\n 1 mL), dichloromethane (5 \nX\n 1 mL) and dried in \nvacuo.\n The aldehyde was cleaved from the resin and globally deprotected by treatment with 95% TFA/ 5% H\n2\nO (v/v, 1.5 mL) for 30 min at room temperature. After washing the resin with cleavage reagent (1 mL), the combined filtrates were added to cold 1:1 ether:hexane (10 mL) and the resulting precipitate was isolated by centrifugation and decantation. The resulting pellet was dissolved in 10% acetonitrile/90% H\n2\nO/0.1% TFA (5 mL) and lyophilized to obtain crude 1105-1125 as a white powder. The compound was purified by semi-preparative RP-HPLC with a Rainin Microsorb™ C18 column (5 µ, 21.4 X 250 mm) eluting with a linear acetonitrile gradient (8% - 48%) containing 0.1% TFA (v/v) over 30 min at 12 mL/min. Fractions containing the desired product were pooled and lyophilized to provide 1105-1125 (10.8 mg, 63%).\n\n\n \n\n\nAnalytical HPLC methods:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n(1) Waters DeltaPak C18, 300Â (5µ, 3.9 X 150 mm).

Synthesis of 401.\n TentaGel S® NH\n2\n resin (0.25 mmol/g, 6.8 g) was placed in a glass shaker vessel and washed with dimethylacetamide (3 X 20 mL). To a solution of 400 (1.70 g, 2.9 mmol, prepared from (3S) 3-(fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl)-4-oxobutryic acid t-butyl ester according to \nA.M. Murphy et. al. J. Am. Chem. Soc., 114, 3156-3157 (1992\n)) in dimethylacetamide (15 mL) was added 0-benzotriazole-N,N,N,N'- tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU; 1.09 g, 2.9, mmol), and DIEA (1.0 mL, 5.7 mmol). The solution was added to the resin, followed by dimethylacetamide (5 mL). The reaction mixture was agitated for 3 h at room temperature using a wrist arm shaker. The resin was isolated by suction filtration and washed with dimethylacetamide (6 x20 mL). A sample of resin (7.4 mg) was thoroughly washed with 50% methanol in dichloromethane and dried under suction. Deprotection of the Fmoc group using 20% piperidine in dimethylacetamide (10.0 mL) and UV analysis of the solution revealed a substitution of 0.19 mmol g\n-1\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nStep B. Synthesis of 903.\n Resin 401 was deprotected with 20% (v/v) piperidine/dimethylacetamide (20 mL) for 10 min (shaking) and then for 10 min with fresh piperidine reagent (20 ml). The resin was then washed with dimethylacetamide (6 X 20 ml). A solution of 902 (1.52 g, 2.81 mmol) was treated with HBTU (1.07 g, 2.83 mmol) and DIEA (1.0 mL, 5.7 mmol) and transferred to the resin, followed by dimethylacetamide (5 mL). The reaction mixture was agitated for 2.5 h at room temperature using a wrist arm shaker. The resin was isolated by suction filtration and washed with dimethylacetamide (4 X 20 mL) and dichloromethane (4 X 20 mL), and dried under nitrogen purge. Resin substitution was performed as described for 401 and determined to be 0.169 mmol g\n-1\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nStep C. Synthesis of 905.\n Resin 903 (7.54 g, 1.27 mmol) and dimedone (2.19 g, 15.6 mmol) were placed in a 100 mL round bottomed flask and freshly distilled anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (60 mL) was added. Tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium (0) (0.32 g, 0.28 mmol) was added and the nitrogen blanketed, sealed reaction was agitated for 15 h on a wrist action shaker. The resin was filtered, washed with dimethylacetamide (4 X 20 mL), dichloromethane (4 X 20 mL) and dimethylacetamide (1 X 20 mL). Sufficient dimethylacetamide was added to the resin to obtain a slurry followed by pyridine (1.5 mL, 18.5 mmol) and a solution of 904 (5.5 mmol) in dichloromethane (10 mL). The reaction was shaken under nitrogen for 8 h, then filtered. The resin was washed with dimethylacetamide (5 X 20 mL) and dichloromethane (5 X 20 mL).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nStep D. Synthesis of 906.\n This compound was prepared from resin 905 (0.24 g, 0.038 mmol) using an Advanced ChemTech 396 Multiple Peptide synthesizer. The automate cycles consisted of a resin wash with dimethylformamide (3 \nX\n 1 mL), deprotection with 25 (v/v) piperidine in dimethylformamide (1 mL) for 10 min followed by fresh reagent (1 mL) for 20 min to yield resin 906. The resin was washed with dimethylformamide (3 \nX\n 1 mL) and N-methypyrrolidone (3 \nX\n 1 mL).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nStep E. (910-922) Resin 906\n was acylated with a solution of 0.4M carboxylic acid and 0.4M HOBT in N-methypyrrolidone (0.5 mL.), a solution of 0.4M HBTU in N-methylpyrrolidone (0.5 mL) and a solution of 1.6M DIEA in N-methypyrrolidone (0.25 mL) and the reaction was shaken for 2 hr at room temperature. The resin was washed with N-methylpyrrolidone (1 \nX\n 1 mL), dimethylformamide (4 \nX\n 1 mL), 50% methanol in dichloromethane (5 \nX\n 1 mL) and dried in air. The aldehyde was cleaved from the resin and globally deprotected by treatment with 95% TFA/ 5% H\n2\nO (v/v, 1.5 mL) for 30 min at room temperature. After washing the resin with cleavage reagent (2 \nX\n 1 mL), the combined filtrates were added to cold 1:1 ether:hexane (35 mL) and the resulting precipitate was isolated by centrifugation and decantation. The resulting pellet was dissolved in acetonitrile (0.5 mL) and H\n2\nO (0.5 mL) and filtered through 0.45 micron microcentrifuge filters. The compound was purified by semi-preparative RP-HPLC with a Rainin Microsorb™ C18 column (5 µ, 21.4 X 250 mm) eluting with a linear acetonitrile gradient (10% - 50%) containing 0.1% TFA (v/v) over 30 min at 12 mL/min.
