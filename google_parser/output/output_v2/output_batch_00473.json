Description\n\n\n\n\nREFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\nThis application is a national phase application under 35 U.S.C. §371 of International Application Number PCT/US2004/015368, filed May 14, 2004, which application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/470,735 filed May 15, 2003 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/512,298, filed Oct. 17, 2003, all of which applications are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nMany chronic and acute conditions are associated with perturbation of the inflammatory response. A large number of cytokines participate in this response, including, but not limited to, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 and TNFα. Although these cytokines are normally expressed in response to many physiological stimuli, excess, unregulated, or excess and unregulated production of these cytokines often leads to inflammation and tissue damage. This is one mechanism by which diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis mediate morbidity (Keffer, J., et al, EMBO J., 13: 4025-4031, 1991, Feldmann, M., et al, Annu. Rev. Immunol., 14: 397-440, 1996 and Bingham, C. O., J. Rheumatol. Suppl., 65: 3-9, 2002). Currently there are several therapeutic agents that aim to reduce systemic levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNFα (Pugsley, M. K. Curr. Opin. Invest. Drugs, 2: 1725-1731, 2001 and Bondeson, J., and Maini, R. N., J. Clin. Pract., 55: 211-216, 2001), thus ameliorating the disease. These therapeutics act directly to reduce circulating levels or neutralize activity of the cytokine. However, these therapeutics do not directly block intracellular proteins that regulate the expression and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines or regulate the expression of other mediators of inflammation and tissue destruction.\n\n\nThe p38 MAP Kinase (p38, also known as CSBP or SAPK) signaling pathway has been reported to be responsible for the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines that are elevated in many inflammatory and auto-immune diseases (see, e.g., Dong, C., et al., Annu. Rev. Immunol., 20: 55-72, 2002 and references cited therein). Thus, inhibitors of any part of the p38 MAP Kinase pathway or inhibitors of pathways that regulate the p38 MAP Kinase pathway may be useful as therapeutics for diseases or conditions in which inflammation or auto-immune responses are involved. (Lee, J. C., et al, Immunopharm, 47: 185-201, 2000). This pathway has been shown to be activated by cellular stressors, such as osmotic shock, UV light, free radicals, bacterial toxins, viruses, cytokines, and chemokines, to name a few, and in response, mediates the expression of several cytokines including, but not limited to, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 and TNFα (Ono, K. and Han, J., Cellular Signalling, 12: 1-13, 2000 and references cited therein).\n\n\nTypically the p38 MAP kinase pathway is directly or indirectly activated by cell surface receptors, such as receptor tyrosine kinases, chemokine or G protein-coupled receptors, which have been activated by a specific ligand, e.g., cytokines, chemokines or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding to a cognate receptor. Subsequently, p38 MAP kinase is activated by phosphorylation on residues threonine 180 and tyrosine 182. After activation, p38 MAP kinase can phosphorylate other intracellular proteins, including protein kinases, and can be translocated to the cell nucleus, where it phosphorylates and activates transcription factors leading to the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and other proteins that contribute to the inflammatory response, cell adhesion, and proteolytic degradation. For example, in cells of myeloid lineage, such as macrophages and monocytes, both IL-1 and TNFα are transcribed in response to p38 activation. Subsequent translation and secretion of these and other cytokines initiates a local or systemic inflammatory response in adjacent tissue and through infiltration of leukocytes. While this response is a normal part of physiological responses to cellular stress, acute or chronic cellular stress leads to the excess, unregulated, or excess and unregulated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This, in turn, leads to tissue damage, often resulting in pain and debilitation. The fact that there are four known isoforms of p38 MAP kinase (p38α, p38β, p38δ and p38γ), each showing different expression levels, tissue distributions and regulation, support the concept that they are involved in the etiology or sequelae of many diseases and physiological disturbances.\n\n\nIndeed, many autoimmune diseases and diseases associated with chronic inflammation, as well as acute responses, have been linked to activation of p38 MAP kinase and overexpression or dysregulation of inflammatory cytokines. These diseases include, but are not limited to: rheumatoid arthritis; rheumatoid spondylitis; osteoarthritis; gout, other arthritic conditions; sepsis; septic shock; endotoxic shock; gram-negative sepsis; toxic shock syndrome; asthma; adult respiratory distress syndrome; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; chronic pulmonary inflammation; inflammatory bowel disease; Crohn's disease; psoriasis; eczema; ulcerative colitis; pancreatic fibrosis; hepatic fibrosis; acute and chronic renal disease; irritable bowel syndrome; pyresis; restenosis; cerebral malaria; stroke and ischemic injury; neural trauma; Alzheimer's disease; Huntington's disease; Parkinson's disease; acute and chronic pain; allergic rhinitis; allergic conjunctivitis; chronic heart failure; acute coronary syndrome; cachexia; malaria; leprosy; leishmaniasis; Lyme disease; Reiter's syndrome; acute synovitis; muscle degeneration, bursitis; tendonitis; tenosynovitis; herniated, ruptures, or prolapsed intervertebral disk syndrome; osteopetrosis; thrombosis; cancer; restenosis; silicosis; pulmonary sarcosis; bone resorption diseases, such as osteoporosis; graft-versus-host reaction; and auto-immune diseases, such as Multiple Sclerosis, lupus and fibromyalgia; AIDS and other viral diseases such as Herpes Zoster, Herpes Simplex I or II, influenza virus and cytomegalovirus; and diabetes mellitus.\n\n\nMany studies have shown that reducing the activity of p38 MAP kinase, its upstream activators or its downstream effectors, either through genetic or chemical means, blunts the inflammatory response and prevents or minimizes tissue damage (see, e.g., English, J. M. and Cobb, M. H., Trends in Pharmacol. Sci., 23: 40-45, 2002; and Dong, C., et al, Annu. Rev. Immunol., 20: 55-72, 2002). Thus, inhibitors of p38 activity, which also inhibit excess or unregulated cytokine production and may inhibit more than a single pro-inflammatory cytokine, may be useful as anti-inflammatory agents and therapeutics. Furthermore, the large number of diseases associated with p38 MAP kinase-associated inflammatory responses indicates that there is a need for effective methods for treating these conditions. However, as of the filing date of the present application, there are no approved drugs available that are known to directly inhibit the p38 MAP kinase family of enzymes, and those approved drugs that act by reducing or neutralizing cytokine levels through binding to the cytokine are generally not orally bioavailable and must therefore be administered by techniques such as injection.\n\n\nAccordingly, new compounds and methods for treating p38- and cytokine-associated conditions are needed.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nIn general, the present invention relates to compounds capable of inhibiting p38 map kinase, methods for inhibiting p38 map kinase in vivo or in vitro, methods for treating conditions associated with p38 map kinase activity or cytokine activity.\n\n\nIn one aspect, the invention provides compounds represented by Formula I:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nin which:\n\n\nX is O or S(O)\nm\n; Y is OR\n4\n, or NR\n4\nR\n5\n; m is 0, 1, or 2; n is 1 or 2; R\n1 \nrepresents 1 or 2 substituents independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, —CN, —COOH, halogen, C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl, C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkoxy; C\n3\n-C\n6 \ncycloalkyl, C\n3\n-C\n6 \ncycloalkyloxy, aryl, aminocarbonyl, C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkylcarbonyl, and C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkoxycarbonyl; Ar is an aryl group; R\n3 \nrepresents 1-2 substituents independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, halogen, amino, C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl, C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkoxy, C\n3\n-C\n6 \ncycloalkyl, C\n3\n-C\n6 \ncycloalkyloxy, aryl, aminocarbonyl, C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkylcarbonyl, and C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkoxycarbonyl; R\n4 \nand R\n5 \nare each independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl, C\n3\n-C\n6 \ncycloalkyl, aryl, and heterocyclyl; or R\n4 \nand R\n5\n, taken together with the N atom to which they are attached, form a heterocyclic ring having from 3 to 8 atoms in the ring; or a prodrug, solvate, or salt (preferably a pharmaceutically acceptable salt) thereof;\n\n\nwith the proviso that when X is S(O)\nm\n, m is 0, Ar is phenyl, Y is NR\n4\nR\n5\n, R\n4 \nis hydrogen and R\n5 \nis alkyl, then if R\n5 \nis a hydroxyalkyl group, R\n5 \n1) is not —CH\n2\n(CH\n3\n)\n2\nCH\n2\nOH, and 2) is not substituted at the carbon atom alpha to the N atom with a phenyl group (that is, the carbon atom of R\n5 \nthat is attached to the N atom does not bear a phenyl group).\n\n\nIn preferred embodiments of Formula I, X is O or S, most preferably O.

In preferred embodiments, R\n1 \nand R\n3 \nare both hydrogen for all occurrences.\n\n\nCompounds of Formula I can also include tracers, tags or labeling moieties, e.g., radioisotopes (such as tritium, carbon-14, or sulfur-35), fluorescent labels, and the like, which are known to one of ordinary skill in the art. Such labeled compounds can be used in methods for detecting or determining the presence of p38 in a cell or a tissue type.\n\n\nIn preferred embodiments, compounds of Formula I are selected to preserve the desired activity of the compounds (e.g., inhibition of cytokine activity, including inhibition of TNFα activity and IL-1 activity, or inhibition of p38 activity). Thus, substituents (R\n1\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, Y, etc.) of a compound of Formula I should be selected to preserve such activity. Preservation of activity can be determined using in vivo and in vitro assays such as the assays described elsewhere in this specification.\n\n\nFor example, as described herein, preferred compounds of Formula I include compounds in which the group Ar is a phenyl or naphthyl group, more preferably substituted with at least one halogen moiety, preferably a fluorine atom, more preferably situated in the 4-position of the phenyl ring to which it is attached (relative to the attachment point for the phenyl ring to the imidazooxazole or imidazothiazole moiety).\n\n\nIn certain preferred embodiments, in a compound of Formula I, R\n3 \nis hydrogen.\n\n\nIn preferred embodiments of the compounds of Formula I, Y is —OR\n4 \nor —NR\n4\nR\n5\n, more preferably —NR\n4\nR\n5\n.

Therefore, single stereochemical isomers (i.e., substantially pure enantiomers and diasteromers) as well as enantiomeric and diastereomeric mixtures, such as racemic mixtures, of the present compounds are within the scope of the invention. Furthermore, all geometric isomers, such as E- and Z-configurations at a double bond, are within the scope of the invention unless otherwise stated. Certain compounds of this invention may exist in tautomeric forms. All such tautomeric forms of the compounds are considered to be within the scope of this invention unless otherwise stated.\n\n\nThe present invention also includes compounds that are prodrugs of an active compound. In general, a prodrug is a compound which is metabolized in vivo (e.g., by a metabolic transformation such as deamination, dealkylation, de-esterification, and the like) to provide an active compound. A “pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug” means a compound which is, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for pharmaceutical use in a patient without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and the like, and effective for the intended use, including a pharmaceutically acceptable ester as well as a zwitterionic form, where possible, of the compounds of the invention. Examples of pharmaceutically-acceptable prodrug types contemplated by the present invention are described in T. Higuchi and V. Stella, Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems, Vol. 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series, and in Edward B. Roche, ed., Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987, both of which are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nThe compounds and compositions of the invention can also include metabolites. As used herein, the term “metabolite” means a product of metabolism of a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, analog, or derivative thereof, that exhibits a similar activity in vitro or in vivo to a compound of the invention.\n\n\nThe compounds and compositions of the invention can also include hydrates and solvates. As used herein, the term “solvate” refers to a complex formed by a solute (in this invention, a compound of Formula I and a solvent. Such solvents for the purpose of the invention preferably should not interfere with the biological activity of the solute. Solvents may be, by way of example, water, ethanol, or acetic acid.\n\n\nII. Methods and Intermediates for Preparing Compounds of the Invention\n\n\nCompounds of the invention can be prepared in a variety of ways, some of which are known in the art. For example, a method for synthesis of pyrimidyl-substituted imidazothiazoles has been described in PCT patent publication WO 03/00682. In general, the compounds of the present invention can be prepared from commercially available starting materials, compounds known in the literature, or from readily-prepared intermediates, by employing standard synthetic methods and procedures known to those skilled in the art, or which will be apparent to the skilled artisan in light of the teachings herein. Standard synthetic methods and procedures for the preparation of organic molecules and functional group transformations and manipulations can be obtained from the relevant scientific literature or from standard textbooks in the field. Although not limited to any one or several sources, classic texts such as Smith, M. B.; March, J. March's Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure, 5\nth \ned.; John Wiley & Sons: New York, 2001; and Greene, T. W.; Wuts, P. G. M. Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3\nrd\n., John Wiley & Sons: New York, 1999 are useful and recognized reference textbooks of organic synthesis known to those in the art. The following descriptions of synthetic methods are designed to illustrate, but not limit, general procedures for the preparation of compounds of the invention.\n\n\nIn an embodiment, the invention includes intermediate compounds. For example, the present invention provides novel compounds represented by Formula II:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nin which:\n\n\nR\n1 \nis selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, —CN, —COOH, halogen, C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl, C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkoxy, C\n3\n-C\n6 \ncycloalkyl, C\n3\n-C\n6 \ncycloalkyloxy, aryl, aminocarbonyl, C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkylcarbonyl, and C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkoxycarbonyl; and Ar is an aryl group; or a salt thereof. As the skilled artisan will recognize from the teachings herein, compounds of Formula II are useful, inter alia, for the synthesis of the imidazooxazole compounds of Formula I. For example, as shown in \nFIG. 1\n, compounds of Formula II, such as 4, can be reacted with an appropriate halopyrimidine compound (such as 5) under Heck reaction conditions, typically using a palladium catalyst (such as Pd(OAc)\n2\n), to provide compounds of Formula I or precursors to such compounds. In preferred embodiments of compounds of Formula II, Ar is phenyl or naphthyl, most preferably phenyl; in certain preferred embodiments, the phenyl group is substituted, e.g., with 1-3 halogen, trifluoromethyl, or C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkoxy substituents. In certain preferred embodiments, the phenyl group is selected from the group consisting of unsubstituted phenyl, 4-fluorophenyl, 3-methoxyphenyl, 4-methoxyphenyl, 3,4-difluorophenyl, 4-methylphenyl, 4-bromophenyl, 3-fluorophenyl, and 4-trifluoromethylphenyl. A most preferred phenyl group is 4-fluorophenyl. In preferred embodiments, R\n1 \nis H. In a most preferred embodiment, R\n1 \nis H and Ar is 4-fluorophenyl.\n\n\nIn yet another aspect, the invention provides compounds of Formula III:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nin which:\n\n\nX is O or S(O)\nm\n; m and n are each independently 0, 1, or 2; p is 1 or 2; R\n1 \nis independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, —CN, —COOH, halogen, C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl, C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkoxy, C\n3\n-C\n6 \ncycloalkyl, C\n3\n-C\n6 \ncycloalkyloxy, aryl, aminocarbonyl, C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkylcarbonyl, and C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkoxycarbonyl; Ar is an aryl group; R\n3 \nis independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, halogen, amino, C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl, C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkoxy, C\n3\n-C\n6 \ncycloalkyl, C\n3\n-C\n6 \ncycloalkyloxy, aryl, aminocarbonyl, C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkylcarbonyl, and C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkoxycarbonyl; and L is a C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl group or an aryl group; or a salt thereof. Compounds of Formula III are useful, for example, for preparing additional compounds of Formula I, as described herein. For example, the group S(O)\nn\nL in which n is 2 is generally a leaving group suitable for displacement by an nucleophile, including oxygen and nitrogen nucleophiles known in the art. For compounds of Formula II in which n is 0 or 1, oxidation of the thioalkyl sulfur atom can be accomplished, preferably in a selective manner, to provide compounds suitable for nucleophilic displacement. As described herein, Oxone™ is a preferred oxidant for this purpose. Salts forms of compounds of Formula III may include pharmaceutically-acceptable salts such as those described hereinbelow.\n\n\nCompounds of Formula III can be prepared by the methods described herein, or by other methods that will be apparent to the ordinarily-skilled artisan. For example, as described herein, compounds of Formula III can be prepared by reaction of a compound of Formula II with a 4-halo-2-alkylthiopyrimidine under Heck conditions. The metal catalyst for the Heck reaction is typically a palladium catalyst, such as Pd(OAc)\n2\n. Preferably, additives such as triphenyl phosphine or bases such as cesium carbonate can be used to facilitate the reaction.\n\n\nIn the reaction of a compound of Formula III with a nucleophile of the formula HOR\n4 \nor HNR\n4\nR\n5\n, it is generally convenient to perform the reaction in the presence of a base to act as a proton sponge; hindered amine bases such as Hunig's base are useful for this purpose when an amine nucleophile is to be used for displacing the sulfone moiety of the compound of Formula III. Other hindered amine bases such as 2,6-lutidine may also be useful for this purpose. If oxygen nucleophiles are used for the displacement reaction, other bases, such as potassium carbonate (see, e.g., Example 3, infra), can be employed.\n\n\nIn an embodiment, the invention provides methods for making compounds of Formula III. The method includes reacting a compound represented by Formula IV:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nin which:\n\n\nX is O or S(O)\nm\n; m is 0, 1, or 2; n is 1 or 2; R\n1 \nis independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, —CN, —COOH, halogen, C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl, C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkoxy, C\n3\n-C\n6 \ncycloalkyl, C\n3\n-C\n6 \ncycloalkyloxy, aryl, aminocarbonyl, C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkylcarbonyl, and C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkoxycarbonyl; and Ar is an aryl group; or a salt thereof,\n\n\nwith a compound represented by Formula V:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nin which:\n\n\nZ is selected from the group consisting of halogen, triflate, mesylate, or another suitable group; p is 1 or 2; R\n3 \nis independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, halogen, amino, C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl, C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkoxy, C\n3\n-C\n6 \ncycloalkyl, C\n3\n-C\n6 \ncycloalkyloxy, aryl, aminocarbonyl, C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkylcarbonyl, and C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkoxycarbonyl; Y is S(O)\nn\nL; n is 0, 1, or 2; and L is a C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl group; or a salt thereof, in the presence of a metal catalyst and under conditions such that the compound of Formula III is formed, thereby preparing the compound of Formula III. The compounds of Formula IV can be prepared as described herein (e.g., as shown in \nFIGS. 1 and 2\n and described in Examples 1 and 2), or may be prepared according to methods that are known or will be apparent to the skilled artisan in light of the teachings herein. In preferred embodiments of Formula IV, X is O; Ar is phenyl or naphthyl, most preferably phenyl; in certain preferred embodiments, the phenyl group is substituted, e.g., with 1-3 halogen, trifluoromethyl, or C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkoxy substituents. In certain preferred embodiments, the phenyl group is selected from the group consisting of unsubstituted phenyl, 4-fluorophenyl, 3-methoxyphenyl, 4-methoxyphenyl, 3,4-difluorophenyl, 4-methylphenyl, 4-bromophenyl, 3-fluorophenyl, and 4-trifluoromethylphenyl. A most preferred phenyl group is 4-fluorophenyl. In preferred embodiments, R\n1 \nis H for all occurrences. In a most preferred embodiment, X is O, R\n1 \nis H and Ar is 4-fluorophenyl. Compounds of Formula V have been reported in the literature (e.g., 4-iodo-2-methylthio pyrimidine; see, e.g., PCT publication WO 02/04447 (2002)). Additional compounds of Formula V can be prepared by the skilled artisan in light of the teachings herein using no more than routine experimentation.\n\n\nA method for preparing imidazooxazole compounds of the invention is described in the Examples below and illustrated in \nFIG. 1\n. In \nFIG. 1\n, step a, a suitably substituted α-haloketone 1 (in which Ar is an aryl moiety) is reacted with an optionally substituted 2-\naminooxazole\n 2. This reaction is typically conducted in inert organic solvent such as acetonitrile or similar at room temperature. The \nproduct\n 3 is typically isolated from the reaction mixture as a solid hydrogen bromide salt by filtration. The cyclization of \ncompound\n 3 to yield the \nimidazooxazole compound\n 4, indicated as step b in \nFIG. 1\n, is conveniently performed by the addition of a dehydrating regent, such as titanium tetrachloride, to the product from step a. This reaction, following appropriate pH modification of the resulting reaction mixture, provides 4. Coupling of 4 with a suitably substituted \npyrimidine\n 5 to produce \ncompound\n 6 is most frequently conducted with palladium catalysis as shown in step c of \nFIG. 1\n. Palladium catalysts suitable for Heck-type reactions are generally preferred. This reaction is typically carried out at elevated temperatures in anhydrous solvents, most conveniently dimethylformamide. A preferred pyrimidine reagent is 4-iodo-2-thiomethylpyrimidine, although other 4-halo-pyrimidines can be employed. Because the Heck-type reaction of \n \ncompounds\n \n 4 and 5 to provide 6 does not always go to completion, a mixture of 4 and 6 may be taken through the next step together, with separation (and preferably recovery and recycling) of the \nunreacted starting material\n 4 at a later stage.\n\n\nThe oxidation step d (\nFIG. 1\n) can be conducted with a variety of standard oxidants known in the literature. One preferred method is to employ an aqueous solution of Oxone™ at room temperature. Displacement of the sulfone leaving group of 7 in step e with an oxygen or nitrogen nucleophile to provide additional compounds of the invention 8 (in which Y is a group as defined in Formula I) can be carried out using a number of standard procedures depending upon the nature of the new bond being created. In the case of amine nucleophiles, for instance, one preferred method is to conduct the reaction with a salt of a primary or secondary amine in a dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) solution together with a hindered organic base, such as diisopropylethylamine, at an elevated temperature with shaking. Another preferred method is to use the amine free base in excess in hot dimethylsulfoxide with either shaking or stirring. The \ncompounds\n 8 can then be isolated and purified using standard techniques. Further functionalization of \ncompounds\n 8 can be performed, if desired. For example, deprotection to yield an unprotected compound can be performed as is routine to one of ordinary skill in the art (e.g., a protecting group such a t-butoxycarbonyl group can be removed from a protected amine to yield the unprotected amine). Alternatively, formation of amides or sulfonamides can be achieved by acylation of a primary or secondary amine (see, e.g., compounds CCLXXVIII and CCLXXIX of Table 1, prepared from compound CCLXXX).\n\n\nAn analogous method for preparing imidazothiazole compounds of the invention is shown in \nFIG. 2\n.\n\n\nAs shown in \nFIG. 2\n, step a, a suitably substituted α-haloketone 9 (in which Ar is an aryl moiety) is reacted with an optionally-substituted 2-\naminothiazole\n 10 to yield the fused \nheterocycle\n 11. This reaction is typically conducted in inert organic solvent such as ethanol or the like, optionally at elevated temperatures. Coupling of 11 with a suitably substituted \npyrimidine\n 5 to yield 12 is most frequently conducted with palladium catalysis as in step b, \nFIG. 2\n. This reaction is typically carried out at elevated temperatures in anhydrous solvents, most preferably dimethylformamide. A preferred pyrimidine reagent is 4-iodo-2-thiomethylpyrimidine, although other halopyrimidines may be employed. The thiomethyl group of 12 can be oxidized in step c to provide a sulfone group suitable for displacement reaction in step d. The oxidation step c can be conducted with a variety of standard oxidants known in the literature. A preferred method is to employ an aqueous solution of Oxone™ at room temperature, which advantageously does not cause excessive oxidation of the imidazothiazole sulfur atom. Displacement of the leaving group of 13 in step d with an oxygen or nitrogen nucleophile to provide additional compounds of the invention 14 (in which Y is a group as defined in Formula I) can be carried out using a number of standard procedures depending upon the nature of the new bond being created. In the case of amine nucleophiles, for instance, one preferred method is to conduct the reaction of 13 with a salt of a primary or secondary amine, in a dimethylsulfoxide solution together with a hindered organic base, such as diisopropylethylamine, at an elevated temperature with shaking. Another preferred method is to use the amine free base in excess in hot dimethylsulfoxide with either shaking or stirring. As described above, further functionalization of \nproducts\n 14 can then be performed if desired.\n\n\nIII. Therapeutic and Diagnostic Methods of the Invention\n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention provides methods for treating disease conditions associated with (e.g., mediated directly or indirectly by) p38 or one or more cytokines. For example, in a preferred embodiment, the methods include administering to a subject in need of treatment (e.g., a mammal in need of such treatment) a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of a compound of the invention. The compound of the invention is preferably a compound of Formula I. Alternatively, the compound may be a compound of Formula II, Formula III, Formula IV, or Formula V, or any combination thereof. A subject may include one or more cells or tissues, or organisms. A preferred subject is a mammal. A mammal may include any mammal.

The method includes administering a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of a compound of the invention to a subject in need thereof. Again, the compound of the invention is preferably a compound of Formula I. Alternatively, the compound may be a compound of Formula II, Formula III, Formula IV, or Formula V, or any combination thereof.\n\n\nThe term “p38-associated condition” means a disease or other deleterious condition in which the p38 MAP kinase signaling pathway is implicated, whether directly or indirectly. This includes, but is not limited to, conditions caused by IL-1, TNFα, IL-6 or IL-8 dysregulation or overexpression resulting from sustained, prolonged, enhanced or elevated levels of p38 activity. Such conditions include, without limitation, inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, destructive bone disorders, proliferative disorders, infectious diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, allergies, reperfusion/ischemia in stroke, heart attacks, angiogenic disorders, organ hypoxia, vascular hyperplasia, cardiac hypertrophy, thrombin-induced platelet aggregation, and conditions associated with the prostaglandin or cyclooxygenase pathways, e.g., conditions involving prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase-2.

In a preferred embodiment, the p38-associated condition is a condition associated with p38α.\n\n\nThe term “modulating p38 activity” means increasing or decreasing p38 activity, whether in vitro or in vivo. Modulating p38 activity preferably means decreasing (inhibiting) p38 activity. In certain preferred embodiments, p38 activity in a cell is inhibited by at least 20%, more preferably at least 30%, 40%, 50%, 80%, 90%, 95%, or 99% compared to the p38 activity of an untreated control cell. In preferred embodiments, p38 activity in a cell (or tissue) is restored to a normal range for the cell (or tissue) type upon treatment according to the methods of the invention.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the invention provides methods for treating disease conditions associated with a cytokine or cytokines. The method includes administering a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of a compound of the invention to a subject in need thereof. Again, the compound of the invention is preferably a compound of Formula I. Alternatively, the compound may be a compound of Formula II, Formula III, Formula IV, or Formula V, or any combination thereof. In a preferred embodiment, at least one of the cytokine or cytokines is preferably selected from the group consisting of IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNFα. In a more preferred embodiment, all of the cytokine or cytokines are selected from the group consisting of IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNFα. By way of non-limiting example, the methods include administering to a subject in need of treatment (e.g., a mammal in need of such treatment) an effective amount of a compound of the invention. A subject may include one or more cells or tissues, or organisms. A preferred subject is a mammal. A mammal may include any mammal. As a non-limiting example, preferred mammals include cattle, pigs, sheep, goats, horses, camels, buffalo, cats, dogs, rats, mice, and humans. A highly preferred subject mammal is a human.\n\n\nA condition associated with altered cytokine activity, as used herein, refers to a condition in which cytokine activity is altered compared to a non-diseased state. This includes, but is not limited to, conditions caused by IL-1, TNFα, IL-6 or IL-8 overproduction or dysregulation resulting in sustained, prolonged, enhanced or elevated levels of cytokine activity, which may be associated with p38 activity. Such conditions include, without limitation, inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, destructive bone disorders, proliferative disorders, infectious diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, allergies, reperfusion/ischemia in stroke, heart attacks, angiogenic disorders, organ hypoxia, vascular hyperplasia, cardiac hypertrophy, thrombin-induced platelet aggregation, and conditions associated with the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase signaling pathways, such as prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase-2. A cytokine-associated condition can include any condition associated with or mediated by IL-1 (particularly IL-1β), TNFα, IL-6 or IL-8, or any other cytokine which can be regulated by p38. In preferred embodiments, the cytokine-associated condition is a condition associated with TNFα.\n\n\nThe terms “therapeutically effective amount” and “prophylactically effective amount”, as used herein, refer to an amount of a compound of the invention sufficient to treat, ameliorate, or prevent the identified disease or condition, or to exhibit a detectable therapeutic, prophylactic, or inhibitory effect. The effect can be detected by, for example, the assays disclosed in the following examples. The precise effective amount for a subject will depend upon the subject's body weight, size, and health; the nature and extent of the condition; and the therapeutic or combination of therapeutics selected for administration. Therapeutically and prophylactically effective amounts for a given situation can be determined by routine experimentation that is within the skill and judgment of the clinician.\n\n\nFor any compound, the therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount can be estimated initially either in cell culture assays, e.g., of neoplastic cells, or in animal models, usually rats, mice, rabbits, dogs, or pigs. The animal model may also be used to determine the appropriate concentration range and route of administration. Such information can then be used to determine useful doses and routes for administration in humans. Therapeutic/prophylactic efficacy and toxicity may be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., ED\n50 \n(the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population) and LD\n50 \n(the dose lethal to 50% of the population). The dose ratio between therapeutic and toxic effects is the therapeutic index, and it can be expressed as the ratio, ED\n50\n/LD\n50\n. Pharmaceutical compositions that exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. The data obtained from cell culture assays and animal studies may be used in formulating a range of dosage for human use. The dosage contained in such compositions is preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include an ED\n50 \nwith little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed, sensitivity of the patient, and the route of administration.\n\n\nMore specifically, the initial target plasma concentration may range from approximately 5 μg/mL to approximately 100 μg/mL, preferably from approximately 10 μg/mL to approximately 100 μg/mL, more preferably from approximately 20 μg/mL to approximately 100 μg/mL. To achieve such plasma concentrations, the compounds of the invention may be administered at doses that vary from 0.1 μg to 100,000 mg, depending upon the route of administration. Guidance as to particular dosages and methods of delivery is provided in the literature and is generally available to practitioners in the art. In general the dose will be in the range of about 1 mg/day to about 10 g/day, or about 0.1 g to about 3 g/day, or about 0.3 g to about 3 g/day, or about 0.5 g to about 2 g/day, in single, divided, or continuous doses for a patient weighing between about 40 to about 100 kg (which dose may be adjusted for patients above or below this weight range, particularly children under 40 kg).\n\n\nThe exact dosage will be determined by the practitioner, in light of factors related to the subject that requires treatment. Dosage and administration are adjusted to provide sufficient levels of the active agent(s) or to maintain the desired effect. Factors which may be taken into account include the severity of the disease state, general health of the subject, age, weight, and gender of the subject, diet, time and frequency of administration, drug combination(s), reaction sensitivities, and tolerance/response to therapy. Long-acting pharmaceutical compositions may be administered every 3 to 4 days, every week, or once every two weeks depending on half-life and clearance rate of the particular formulation.\n\n\nThe inventive methods can also be used to treat autoimmune diseases and diseases associated with acute and chronic inflammation.

Thus, for example, in certain embodiments, the invention provides the use of a compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, in combination with other pharmaceutically active agents in the treatment of disease. Pharmaceutically active agents include any pharmaceutical agents that are useful for the treatment of any disease condition. In one non-limiting example, the compounds of the invention are pharmaceutically active agents that can be combined with other pharmaceutically active agents for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.

When delivered in alternation therapy, the methods of the invention may comprise administering or delivering the active ingredients sequentially, e.g., in separate solution, emulsion, suspension, tablets, pills or capsules, or by different injections in separate syringes. In general, during alternation therapy, an effective dosage of each active ingredient is administered sequentially, i.e., serially, whereas in simultaneous therapy, effective dosages of two or more active ingredients are administered together. Various sequences of intermittent combination therapy may also be used.\n\n\nIn an embodiment of the present invention, methods are provided for inhibiting the activity of p38 in a cell, in vitro or in vivo. The methods include contacting a cell or tissue containing p38 with an effective p38-inhibiting amount of a compound of the invention, under conditions such that p38 activity in the cell or tissue is inhibited. Contacting a cell refers to a condition in which a compound or other composition of matter is in direct contact with a cell or tissue, or is close enough to induce a desired biological effect in a cell or tissue. For example, contacting a cell or tissue containing p38 with a compound of the invention may be conducted by any means that permits an interaction between p38 and the compound of the invention, resulting in the desired biological effect in a cell. Contacting a cell or tissue may be accomplished, for example, by introduction of a compound of the invention such as a Formula I compound, prodrug or intermediate. Contacting a cell or tissue may be accomplished by introduction of a pharmaceutical composition. Contacting a cell or tissue may be accomplished by direct introduction of the active compound to the cell or tissue containing p38. Alternatively, for example, contacting a cell or tissue may be accomplished by introducing a compound in a manner that the compound will be targeted, directly or indirectly, to a cell or tissue containing p38. Contacting a cell or tissue may be accomplished under conditions such that a compound of the invention, preferably Formula I, can bind to p38 protein. Such conditions may include proximity of the compound and p38-containing cell or tissue, pH, temperature, or any condition that affects the binding of a compound of the invention to p38 protein.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention provides a method for modulating p38 activity in a cell or secreted by a cell. The method includes contacting a cell containing p38 with an effective p38-inhibiting amount of a compound of the invention, under conditions such that p38 activity in the cell is modulated (more preferably, inhibited). In certain embodiments, the cell is contacted with the compound of the invention in vitro; in other embodiments, the cell is contacted with the compound of the invention in vivo. In certain embodiments, the compound of the invention is provided in the form of a pharmaceutical composition, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention provides a method for modulating cytokine activity or levels in a cell. The method includes contacting a cell containing cytokines with an effective cytokine-inhibiting amount of a compound of the invention, under conditions such that cytokine activity or levels in the cell are modulated (more preferably, inhibited). In certain embodiments, the cell is contacted with the compound of the invention in vitro; in other embodiments, the cell is contacted with the compound of the invention in vivo. In certain embodiments, the compound of the invention is provided in the form of a pharmaceutical composition, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention provides methods for determining whether a compound of Formula I is potentially useful as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of p38- or cytokine-associated conditions. In some embodiments, the methods comprise contacting p38 with a compound of the invention, and determining whether the compound of the invention modulates (preferably, inhibits) the activity of p38. In some embodiments, the methods comprise contacting p38 with a compound of the invention, and determining whether the compound of the invention modulates (preferably, inhibits) the activity of cytokines. In preferred embodiments, the contacting step takes place in vitro; in certain preferred embodiments, the contacting step comprises contacting a cell comprising p38 with a compound of Formula I.\n\n\nThe methods of the invention have many uses. For example, methods of inhibiting p38 activity in vitro may be useful, e.g., in developing screening assays (e.g., as a positive control), or as a research or diagnostic tool for studying the role of p38 in cellular function (e.g., inhibiting p38 to determine the effect of such inhibition on other functions in the cell). Especially useful for this purpose are compounds of the invention in which the compounds contain a label or tag such as a radioisotope or a fluorescent label. Such labeled compounds can be used in methods for detecting or determining the presence, activity or distribution of p38 in a cell or a tissue type, e.g., by contacting a cell or tissue with a labeled compound of the invention, and then detecting the presence or absence of the label in the cell or tissue.\n\n\nAccordingly, diagnostic tests are contemplated as part of the present invention. For example, a tissue biopsy sample can be taken from a subject suffering from a p38-associated or cytokine-associated condition. The biopsy sample can be tested to determine the level of p38 activity (or cytokine levels) present in the sample; the sample can then be contacted with a compound of the invention, and the p38 activity (or cytokine levels) measured to determine whether the compound of Formula I has a desired effect (e.g., inhibition of p38 or cytokine activity). Such a test could be used to determine whether treatment with a compound of the invention is likely to be effective in that subject. Alternatively, the sample could be contacted with a labeled compound of the invention (e.g., a fluorescently-labeled compound) and the sample then examined (e.g., under a confocal microscope) to determine the distribution of p38 in the tissue sample. Repeated biopsy samples taken during a course of treatment could also be used to study the efficacy of the treatment. Other diagnostic tests using the compounds of the invention will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in light of the teachings of this specification.\n\n\nThus, for example, the invention provides methods for determining the presence, location, or quantity, or any combination thereof of p38 protein in a cell or tissue sample. The methods include a) contacting the cell or tissue sample with a compound of the invention under conditions such that the compound can bind to p38 protein; and b) determining the presence, location, or quantity, or any combination thereof of the compound of the invention in the cell or tissue sample, thereby determining the presence, location, or quantity, or any combination thereof of p38 protein in the cell or tissue sample. Determining the presence, location, or quantity, or any combination thereof of the compound of the invention in the cell or tissue sample may be conducted by any means that reveals the presence, location, or quantity, or any combination thereof of the compound in the cell or tissue. For example, as described previously, radioactive or fluorescent labeling methods may be used. Additional methods of determining the presence, location, or quantity, or any combination thereof of a compound of the invention will be apparent to a skilled artisan.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the invention provides methods for determining (1) whether a compound of the invention will be a useful therapeutic agent for treatment of a subject suffering from a p38-associated condition, or (2) the severity of disease or (3) the course of disease during treatment with a disease-modifying agent. The methods include: a) obtaining a cell or tissue sample from the subject before, during and after termination of treatment with a compound of the invention or another disease-modifying agent; b) contacting the sample with a compound of the invention; and c) determining the amount of the compound of the invention that binds to the sample, wherein binding to p38 protein by the compound is related to the amount of p38 protein in the sample.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the invention provides methods for determining (1) whether a compound of the invention will be a useful therapeutic agent for treatment of a subject suffering from a cytokine-associated condition, or (2) the severity of disease or (3) the course of disease during treatment with a disease-modifying agent. The methods include: a) obtaining a cell or tissue sample from the subject before, during and after termination of treatment with a compound of the invention or another disease-modifying agent; b) contacting the sample with a compound of the invention and c) determining the amount of the compound of the invention that binds to the sample, wherein binding to p38 protein by the compound is related to the amount of p38 protein in the sample, and the amount of p38 in the sample is related to the quantity of cytokines released. In an exemplary embodiment, such a method may be conducted by obtaining cells from a cancer cell line, contacting cells from the cancer cell line, such as, for example, cells from a metastatic breast carcinoma, colorectal carcinoma, malignant melanoma, gastric cancer, or non-small cell lung cancer line with a compound of the present invention and determining the binding.\n\n\nIV.

When intended for oral use for example, tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oil suspensions, non-aqueous solutions, dispersible powders or granules (including micronized particles or nanoparticles), emulsions, hard or soft capsules, syrups or elixirs may be prepared. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions, and such compositions may contain one or more agents including sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents, in order to provide a palatable preparation.\n\n\nPharmaceutically acceptable excipients particularly suitable for use in conjunction with tablets include, for example, inert diluents, such as celluloses, calcium or sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium or sodium phosphate; disintegrating agents, such as croscarmellose sodium, cross-linked povidone, maize starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, such as povidone, starch, gelatin or acacia; and lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. Tablets may be uncoated or may be coated by known techniques including microencapsulation to delay disintegration and adsorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate alone or with a wax may be employed.\n\n\nFormulations for oral use may be also presented as hard gelatin capsules where the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example celluloses, lactose, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with non-aqueous or oil medium, such as glycerin, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be formulated as suspensions comprising a compound of the present invention in admixture with at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient suitable for the manufacture of a suspension.

Chem. 275: 12560-12564, 2000).\n\n\nMaterials: All kinases and the substrate ATF2 are acquired from Upstate (Charlottesville, Va.). p38 MAP Kinases are recombinant human full-length proteins with an amino-terminal GST fusion, expressed in and purified from \nE. coli\n. ATF2 is a GST fusion protein containing amino acids 19-96 of human ATF2 expressed in \nE. coli\n. All proteins were aliquoted and stored at −80° C.\n\n\nMethods: p38 MAP Kinase assays are performed using an assay buffer containing 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl\n2\n, 2 mM DTT, 20 mM β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mM Na\n3\nVO\n4\n, 40 μM ATP and 1.25 μM of ATF2, together with 6 ng of p38α protein, 12 ng p38β protein, 1.5 ng p38γ, or 0.4 ng JNK2α2. Compounds are serially diluted in DMSO and 2 μL of test compound at 25× final concentration is used. The vehicle control receives DMSO only. Test compounds are pre-incubated with 20 μl of enzyme in kinase buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl\n2\n, 2 mM DTT, 20 mM β-glycerophosphate and 0.1 mM Na\n3\nVO\n4\n) at room temperature for 15 minutes. Reactions are initiated by addition of 30 μl substrate solution to yield a final concentration of 40 μM ATP and 1.25 μM ATF2 in kinase buffer. The reactions are incubated for 30 minutes at 37° C. and terminated by the addition of 18 μl of 200 mM EDTA. An ELISA method is used to measure the phosphorylation of ATF2 at Thr 69. High binding 96-well plates (Corning 3369) are coated with 50 μl of kinase reaction for 1 hour at 37° C. The coated plates are washed with 200 μl washing buffer (25 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.3, 192 mM glycine, 0.1% SDS and 0.05% Tween-20) three times. The plates are then washed three times with SuperBlock in TBS (Pierce, 37535). After blocking, plates are incubated with 50 μl of rabbit anti-phospho-ATF2 antibody (Cell Signaling, 9221 L, 1:500) for 30 minutes at 37° C. Plates are washed three times with washing buffer prior to incubation with 50 μl HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Cell Signaling, 7074, 1:500) for 30 minutes at 37° C. Plates are then washed three times with washing buffer before incubation with 50 μl of Ultra TMB-ELISA (Pierce, 34028) for 8 minutes at room temperature. Finally, 50 μl of phosphoric acid (1 M) is added to stop reactions and plate absorbance is read at 450 nm on a SpectraMax 250 plate reader.\n\n\nResults: The results of the p38α assay for certain compounds of the invention are shown in Table 1 and Table 2. It is found that compounds of the invention inhibit the phosphorylation of ATF2 in this in vitro assay. Preferred compounds exhibit IC\n50 \nvalues of less than 500 nM, more preferably less than 100 nM, and still more preferably less than 20 nM.\n\n\nExample 5\n\n\nCompounds of the invention are screened for the ability to inhibit TNFα and IL-1β release from THP-1 cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vitro. The ability of compounds to inhibit TNFα and IL-1β release in this in vitro assay is correlated with the inhibition of p38 activity and TNFα and IL-1β expression in vivo, and is therefore an indicator of potential in vivo therapeutic activity (Lee J. C. et al, Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 696: 149-170, 1993 and Nature, 372: 739-746, 1994).\n\n\nMaterials: THP-1 cells from ATCC (TIB202) are maintained at 37° C., 5% CO\n2 \nin RPMI 1640 media (MediaTech, Herndon, Va.) containing 4.5 g/L glucose, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 50 μM β-mercaptoethanol.\n\n\nMethods: Test compounds are initially dissolved in RPMI media with 1% DMSO (v/v). Compounds are then serially diluted in RPMI media for all subsequent dilutions. The assay is performed under sterile conditions. THP-1 cells at a culture density of 6-8×10\n5 \ncells/ml are collected and resuspended in the RPMI media at 10\n6 \ncells/ml. 100 μl of resuspended cells are added to each well, which contain 100 μl of a test compound. Test compounds are prepared at twice the final concentration. Final DMSO concentration is no more than 0.5% (v/v). Cells are preincubated with compound for 30 minutes at 37° C., 5% CO\n2 \nprior to stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Sigma L-2880, 4 mg/ml stock in PBS). The final LPS concentration in each well is 10 or 30 μg/ml for TNFα and IL-1β release, respectively. Unstimulated control cell suspensions receive PBS vehicle only. Cell mixtures are incubated for 18 or 48 hours for TNFα and IL-1β release, respectively. 150 μl of supernatants are taken and transferred to a fresh plate and stored at −20° C. until further analysis. TNFα and IL-1β levels are measured using ELISA kits (Biosource (KHC3012 for TNFα; KAC1192 for IL-1β). A SpectraMAX 250 is used as the plate reader. Analysis is performed by non-linear regression to generate a dose response curve. The calculated IC\n50 \nvalue is the concentration of the test compound that causes a 50% decrease in TNFα or IL-1β levels.\n\n\nResults: Compounds of the invention inhibit the release of TNFα, IL-1β or both TNFα, and IL-1β in this in vitro assay. The TNFα inhibition data for certain compounds of the invention are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Preferred compounds exhibit IC\n50 \nvalues for TNFα and/or IL-1β of less than 500 nM, more preferred compounds less than 200 nM, still more preferred compounds less than 100 nM, and even still more preferred compounds less than 20 nM.\n\n\nExample 6\n\n\nCompounds of the invention are screened for the ability to inhibit TNFα release from primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vitro. The ability of compounds to inhibit TNFα release in this in vitro assay is correlated with the inhibition of p38 activity and is therefore an indicator of potential in vivo therapeutic activity (Osteoarthritis & Cartilage, 10: 961-967, 2002 and Laufer, S. A. and Wagner, G. K., J. Med. Chem. 45: 2733-2740, 2002).\n\n\nMaterials and Methods: Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) are isolated by differential centrifugation through a Ficoll-HyPaque density gradient from pooled serum of 3-8 individual blood donors. Isolated PBMC contain approximately 10% CD-14 positive monocytes, 90% lymphocytes and <1% granulocytes and platelets. PBMC (10\n6\n/ml) are cultured in polystyrene plates and stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 50 ng/ml; Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) in the presence and absence of compound, in duplicate, for 24 hr at 37° C. in GIBCO™ RPMI medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) without serum. The TNFα level in cell supernatants is determined by ELISA using a commercially available kit (MDS Panlabs #309700).\n\n\nResults: Preferred compounds of the invention inhibit the release of TNFα in this assay with an IC\n50 \nvalue of less than 500 nM, more preferably less than 100 nM, and still more preferably less than 20 nM.\n\n\nExample 7\n\n\nCompounds of the invention are screened for the ability to inhibit the release of TNFα in an in vivo animal model. (See, e.g., Griswold D. E. et al, Drugs Exp. Clin. Res. 19: 243-248, 1993, Badger, A. M. et al, J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 279: 1453-1461, 1996, Dong, C. et al, Annu. Rev. Immunol., 20: 55-72, 2002 (and references cited therein), Ono, K. and Han, J., Cellular Signalling, 12: 1-13, 2000 (and references cited therein) and Griffiths, J. B. et al, Curr. Rheumatol. Rep., 1: 139-148, 1999).\n\n\nWithout being bound by any particular theory, it is believed that inhibition of TNFα in this model is due to inhibition of p38 MAP kinase by the compound.\n\n\nIn Vivo LPS Challenge Study\n\n\nMale Sprague-Dawley rats (0.2-0.35 kg) are randomly divided into groups of six or more and are dosed intravenously by infusion or bolus injection, or are dosed orally with test compounds in a suitable formulation in each case. Thirty minutes following end of infusion or bolus injection, and 1-2 hr following oral administration, lipopolysaccharide \nE. coli/\n0127:B8 (0.8 mg/kg) is administered IV. Blood samples are collected 1.5 hours post-treatment with LPS. Serum TNFα levels are determined using the ELISA kit from Biosource (KRC3011C) and compared to that from vehicle-treated control.\n\n\nResults: Preferred compounds of the invention inhibit the release of TNFα in this in vivo assay. Preferred compounds delivered intravenously exhibit an ED\n50 \nvalue of less than 20 mg/kg, more preferably less than 5 mg/kg, and still more preferably less than 1 mg/kg. Preferred compounds delivered orally exhibit an ED\n50 \nvalue of less than 100 mg/kg, more preferably less than 20 mg/kg, and still more preferably less than 1 mg/kg.\n\n\nExample 8\n\n\nKinase Selectivity\n\n\nA selectivity panel is used to test the cross-reactivity of compounds of the invention with the β and γ isoforms of p38 MAP kinase, Src\np60 \nand JNK2α2. The p38β, p38γ, and JNK2α2 assays are described in Example 4. The Src\np60 \nassay measures the ability of compounds to inhibit Src\np60\n-catalyzed phosphorylation of a peptide substrate.\n\n\nMethods: Compounds are serially diluted in DMSO and 1 μL of test compound at 25× final concentration is used. The vehicle control receives DMSO only. Test compounds are pre-incubated with 10 μL of water containing 5.3 units of Src\np60 \nenzyme (Upstate, Charlottesville, Va.) at room temperature for 15 minutes. Reactions are initiated by addition of 14 μL substrate cocktail (45 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 18 mM MgCl\n2\n, 36 mM β-glycerophosphate and 0.18 mM Na\n3\nVO\n4\n, 71.5 μM ATP and 1.8 μM CDC2p34 substrate ((Biotin-KVEKIGEGTYGVVYK-amide, custom synthesis, New England Peptide). The reactions are incubated for 3.5 hr at room temperature and terminated by the addition of 25 μl of 25 mM EDTA. 8 μl of reaction mix is transferred to a Costar Black 96-well polystyrene plate and 96 μl of detection mixture (30 μl of APC-Strepavidin (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences) (1 mg/ml in water), 8 μl Eu-P66 (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences) (500 μg/ml) in 1 ml of Tris-EDTA buffer pH 8.0 (Fluka)). The reactions are incubated for 1 hr at room temperature. Time resolved fluorescence is read at 665 and 615 nm using the Victor V program LANCE 615/665 on a Victor\n2 \nV plate reader (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences).\n\n\nResults: Table III shows kinase selectivity panel data. Selectivity over p38β ranged from 3- to 71-fold, with LXXXVII exhibiting 17-fold selectivity over p38β as compared to p38α. The lowest value observed for selectivity over p38γ and Src was 465-fold as compared to p38α. While Compounds LXXXVII, LXXXIV, LXXI, CXIX and CCLXXXI exhibited selectivities over JNK2α2 that ranged from 83- to 191-fold, compounds CCLXXVII, CCLXXIX and CCLXXX showed somewhat lower selectivity over JNK2α2, ranging from 28- to 64-fold of the activity against p38α.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE III\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn vitro potency and selectivity of lead\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncompounds.

Female Lewis rats (0.16-0.2 kg) are injected subcutaneously at the base of the tail and two sites on the back on \n \nday\n \n 0 and 6 with 300 μl of Freund's Incomplete Adjuvant containing 2 mg/ml of Bovine Type II Collagen. On \nday\n 9 of the study, caliper measurements of both hind leg ankle joints are performed. This measurement is considered the normal, pre-disease measurement. When ankle swelling is clearly established in at least one hind paw (caliper measurement increase from 0.263 to 0.282 inches), rats are enrolled into the treatment phase of the study. This occurs on \n \nday\n \n 10 or 11 of the study and is considered to be \nday\n 1 of arthritis. Enrolled animals are randomized and administered vehicle control or compound (1, 3.3, 10, or 30 mg/kg, bid), unless otherwise indicated, or dexamethasone (0.0375 mg/kg, bid) via oral gavage on days 1-7 of arthritis (treatment days). Ankle diameters are measured on each day of treatment. Mean increases in ankle diameter for 7 lead compounds are shown below in \nFIGS. 3-9\n.\n\n\nFollowing sacrifice on \nday\n 7, both hind paws are removed from each animal and weighed. Knees and ankles from all animals in all groups are preserved, decalcified in 5% formic acid and trimmed into two approximately equal longitudinal (ankles) or frontal (knees) halves, dehydrated, cleared, infiltrated, and embedded in paraffin. Blocks are sectioned and stained with Toluidine Blue.\n\n\nTissues are examined microscopically and scored for knee and ankle inflammation (cellular infiltration), pannus formation and infiltration, cartilage damage (loss of Toluidine staining and collagen disruption) and bone resorption. Scoring is on a scale from 0-5, where a score of 0 is normal and a score of 5 indicates severe damage or evidence of disease or both.\n\n\nResults: Tested compounds show dose-dependent inhibition of clinical and histopathologic parameters of arthritis, including inflammation and bone damage. The results are summarized as a 50% reduction in measurement of disease parameters (ED\n50 \nin mg/kg) in Table V.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE V\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInhibition of collagen-induced arthritis in rats by\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncompounds of the present invention.
