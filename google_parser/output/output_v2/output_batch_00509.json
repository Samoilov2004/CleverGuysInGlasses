Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to phenyl pyrrole aminoguanidine derivatives. The present invention further relates to the use of such phenyl pyrrole aminoguanidine derivatives for the treatment of diseases associated with the melanocortin receptors or related systems, e.g. the melanocyte stimulating hormones.\n\n\n \n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA number of large linear and cyclic peptides are known in the art which show high specific binding to melanocortin (MC) receptors. The agonistic and/or antagonistic properties of these peptides are also known. See, for example, \n \nWO 99/21571\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMoreover, a number of low molecular weight compounds are known, e.g., isoquinolines, spiropyridines and benzimidazoles, which show activity on the MC receptors. See, for example \n \nWO 99/55679\n \n, \n \nWO 99/64002\n \n and \n \nWO 01/05401\n \n. For further literature disclosing other compounds also acting on the MC receptors, reference is made to \n \nWO 00/74679\n \n, \n \nWO 00/58361\n \n, \n \nWO 02/18327\n \n, \n \nWO 02/12166\n \n, \n \nWO 01/55106\n \n, \n \nWO 01/55107\n \n, \n \nWO 01/55109\n \n, \n \nWO 02/11715\n \n and \n \nWO 02/12178\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, there is still a large need to provide low molecular weight compounds showing agonistic or antagonistic properties to the MC receptors. The compounds of the present invention are structurally different from the above-mentioned compounds and, consequently, constitute a new class of compounds that show activity to the MC receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrior art compounds, which have some structural relationship to the compounds of the present invention include the compounds described in \n \nWO 98/23267\n \n:\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis hydroxyguanidine derivative has proven activity against xanthine oxidase/xanthine dehydrogenase enzymes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLikewise, the compounds disclosed in \n \nWO 03/013509\n \n exhibit antiinflammatory properties and significant affinity to the MC receptors. The general structure of the compounds disclosed in \n \nWO 03/013509\n \n is as follows:\n\n \n \n\nwhere X is (CH\n2\n)\nn\n, and n is 0, 1 or 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention differ from the compounds disclosed in \n \nWO 03/013509\n \n in that the aminoguanidine substituent of the pyrrole ring has been modified into a more rigid structure allowing only minimal rotational freedom around the carbon atoms present in the aminoguanidine substituent.\n\n\n \n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThus, in a first aspect the present invention relates to a compound of the general formula (I)\n\n \n \n\nincluding tautomeric forms thereof,\n\nwherein\n\n \n \n \nn is 1, 2 or 3;\n \neach R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n and R\n5\n is independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, optionally substituted C\n1-6\n-alkyl, optionally substituted C\n3-6\n-cycloalkyl, optionally substituted C\n2-6\n-alkenyl, optionally substituted C\n4-6\n-alkadienyl, optionally substituted C\n2-6\n-alkynyl, hydroxy, optionally substituted C\n1-6\n-alkoxy, optionally substituted C\n2-6\n-alkenyloxy, carboxy, optionally substituted C\n1-6\n-alkoxycarbonyl, optionally substituted C\n1-6\n-alkylcarbonyl, formyl, C\n1-6\n-alkylsulphonylamino, optionally substituted aryl, optionally substituted aryloxycarbonyl, optionally substituted aryloxy, optionally substituted arylcarbonyl, optionally substituted arylamino, arylsulphonylamino, optionally substituted heteroaryl, optionally substituted heteroaryloxycarbonyl, optionally substituted heteroaryloxy, optionally substituted heteroarylcarbonyl, optionally substituted heteroarylamino, heteroarylsulphonylamino, optionally substituted heterocyclyl, optionally substituted heterocyclyloxycarbonyl, optionally substituted heterocyclyloxy, optionally substituted heterocyclylcarbonyl, optionally substituted heterocyclylamino, heterocyclylsulphonylamino, amino, mono- and di(C\n1-6\n-alkyl)amino, carbamoyl, mono- and di(C\n1-6\n-alkyl)aminocarbonyl, amino-C\n1-6\n-alkyl-aminocarbonyl, mono- and di(C\n1-6\n-alkyl)amino-C\n1-6\n-alkyl-aminocarbonyl, C\n1-6\n-alkylcarbonylamino, amino-C\n1-6\n-alkylcarbonylamino, mono- and di(C\n1-6\n-alkyl)amino-C\n1-6\n-alkyl-carbonylamino, cyano, guanidino, carbamido, C\n1-6\n-alkanoyloxy, C\n1-6\n-alkylsulphonyl, C\n1-6\n-alkylsulphinyl, C\n1-6\n-alkylsulphonyloxy, aminosulfonyl, mono- and di(C\n1-6\n-alkyl)aminosulfonyl, nitro, optionally substituted C\n1-6\n-alkylthio and halogen,\n \nwhere any nitrogen-bound C\n1-6\n-alkyl is optionally substituted with hydroxy, C\n1-6\n-alkoxy, C\n2-6\n-alkenyloxy, amino, mono- and di(C\n1-6\n-alkyl)amino, carboxy, C\n1-6\n-alkylcarbonylamino, halogen, C\n1-6\n-alkylthio, C\n1-6\n-alkyl-sulphonyl-amino or guanidine;\n \neach R\n6\n and R\n7\n is independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, optionally substituted C\n1-6\n-alkyl, optionally substituted C\n2-6\n-alkenyl, optionally substituted C\n4-6\n-alkadienyl, optionally substituted C\n2-6\n-alkynyl, optionally substituted C\n1-6\n-alkoxycarbonyl, optionally substituted C\n1-6\n-alkylcarbonyl, optionally substituted aryl, optionally substituted aryloxycarbonyl, optionally substituted arylcarbonyl, optionally substituted heteroaryl, optionally substituted heteroaryloxycarbonyl, optionally substituted heteroarylcarbonyl, aminocarbonyl, mono- and di(C\n1-6\n-alkyl)aminocarbonyl, amino-C\n1-6\n-alkyl-aminocarbonyl and mono- and di(C\n1-6\n-alkyl)amino-C\n1-6\n-alkyl-aminocarbonyl;

A prophylactic treatment functions as a preventative treatment against a disease or disorder. A \"prophylactic activity\" is an activity of an agent, such as a compound disclosed herein, or a composition thereof, that, when administered to a subject who does not display signs or symptoms of pathology, disease or disorder, or who displays only early signs or symptoms of pathology, disease, or disorder, diminishes, prevents, or decreases the risk of the subject developing a pathology, disease, or disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the present context the term \"therapeutic treatment\", or simply \"treatment\", means a treatment administered to a subject who displays symptoms or signs of pathology, disease, or disorder, in which treatment is administered to the subject for the purpose of diminishing or eliminating those signs or symptoms of pathology, disease, or disorder.

Furthermore, the compounds of the general formula (I) herein are all shown in their trans isomeric forms. It should be understood, however, that the compounds of the general formula (I) may also be in their cis isomeric form.

Nevertheless, in a preferred embodiment of the invention it is preferred that the aminoguanidine substituent is attached to the pyrrole ring at \nposition\n 2, i.e. in a preferred embodiment the compounds of the invention has the stereochemistry indicated in the general formula (Ia) and the formulae (II)-(VI) above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs indicated above, n is an integer of 1, 2 or 3. In a preferred embodiment of the invention n is 1 or 2. In the most preferred embodiment of the invention n is 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds according to the invention which are currently believed to be of particular interest are shown in \nFig. 1\n.\n\n\n \n\n\nMethods of preparing the compounds of the invention\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention may be prepared by standard methods known to the skilled person. Thus, a compound of the general formula (Ia) or (Ib) above may be prepared essentially as described in \n \nWO 03/013509\n \n, i.e. a compound of the general formula (IIa) or (IIb)\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\nis reacted with an aminoguanidine derivative of the general formula (III) in a suitable organic solvent:\n\n \n \n\nwherein the individual substitutents have the same meaning as described above. Preferably, a compound of the general formula (IIa) or (IIb) is reacted with an aminoguanidine derivative of the general formula (III) where the aminoguanidine derivative is in the form of an acid addition salt, such as the bicarbonate salt.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound (IIa) may easily be prepared from the starting compound (IVa) by the well-known Wittig reaction:\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormation of the intermediate compound (Va) is carried out in a suitable organic solvent, typically a protic solvent, such as dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylformamide, hexamethylphosphorotriamide, in the presence of a strong base, such as an alkoxide, e.g. sodium or potassium tert-butoxide. The intermediate (Va) is subsequently converted to the desired (IIa) by acidic hydrolysis using standard methods. As will be understood, compound (IIb) may be achieved in an analogous way by using the starting compound (IVb) rather than the starting compound (IVa):\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compound of the invention is preferably administered in a composition including a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. The term \"pharmaceutically acceptable\" means a carrier or excipient that does not cause any untoward effects in patients to whom it is administered. Such pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and excipients are well known in the art (\nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th edition, A. R. Gennaro, Ed., Mack Publishing Company [1990\n]; \nPharmaceutical Formulation Development of Peptides and Proteins, S. Frokjaer and L. Hovgaard, Eds., Taylor & Francis [2000\n]; and \nHandbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, 3rd edition, A. Kibbe, Ed., Pharmaceutical Press [2000\n]).\n\nThe exact dose to be administered depends on the circumstances. Normally, the dose should be capable of preventing or lessening the severity or spread of the condition or indication being treated. It will be apparent to those of skill in the art that an effective amount of the compound of the invention depends, \ninter alia,\n upon the disease, the dose, the administration schedule, whether the compound of the invention is administered alone or in conjunction with other therapeutic agents, the general health of the patient, and the like. Generally, and in particular if administered via the oral route, the compound of the invention should be administered in a dose of 0.1 to 100 mg body weight per kilo throughout the treatment period.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical composition may be formulated in a variety of forms, including liquid, gel, lyophilised, powder, compressed solid, or any other suitable form. The preferred form will depend upon the particular indication being treated and will be apparent to one of skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical composition may be administered orally, subcutaneously, intravenously, intracerebrally, intranasally, transdermally, intraperitoneally, intramuscularly, intrapulmonary, vaginally, rectally, intraocularly, or in any other acceptable manner, e.g. using PowderJect or ProLease technology. The composition can be administered continuously by infusion, although bolus injection is acceptable, using techniques well known in the art, such as pumps or implantation. In some instances the composition may be directly applied as a solution or spray. The preferred mode of administration will depend upon the particular indication being treated and will be apparent to one of skill in the art. However, the currently preferred mode of administration is via the oral route.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical composition of the invention may be administered in conjunction with other therapeutic agents. These agents may be incorporated as part of the same pharmaceutical composition or may be administered separately from the composition of the invention, either concurrently or in accordance with any other acceptable treatment schedule.\n\n\n \n\n\nOral administration\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nFor oral administration, the pharmaceutical composition may be in solid or liquid form, e.g. in the form of a capsule, tablet, suspension, emulsion or solution. The pharmaceutical composition is preferably made in the form of a dosage unit containing a given amount of the active ingredient. A suitable daily dose for a human or other mammal may vary widely depending on the condition of the patient and other factors, but can be determined by persons skilled in the art using routine methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolid dosage forms for oral administration may include capsules, tablets, suppositories, powders and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound may be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as sucrose, lactose, or starch. Such dosage forms may also comprise, as is normal practice, additional substances, e.g. lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. Tablets and pills can additionally be prepared with enteric coatings.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound of the invention may be admixed with adjuvants such as lactose, sucrose, starch powder, cellulose esters of alkanoic acids, stearic acid, talc, magnesium stearate, magnesium oxide, sodium and calcium salts of phosphoric and sulphuric acids, acacia, gelatin, sodium alginate, polyvinyl-pyrrolidine, and/or polyvinyl alcohol, and tableted or encapsulated for conventional administration. Alternatively, the compound of the invention may be dissolved in saline, water, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, ethanol, oils (such as corn oil, peanut oil, cottonseed oil or sesame oil), tragacanth gum, and/or various buffers. Other adjuvants and modes of administration are well known in the pharmaceutical art. The carrier or diluent may include time delay material, such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate alone or with a wax, or other materials well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions may be subjected to conventional pharmaceutical operations such as sterilisation and/or may contain conventional adjuvants such as preservatives, stabilisers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, buffers, fillers, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiquid dosage forms for oral administration may include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs containing inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as water. Such compositions may also comprise adjuvants, such as wetting agents, sweeteners, flavoring agents and perfuming agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also relates to processes for the manufacture of and pharmaceutical preparations comprising one or more of the compounds of the invention, as well as to their uses for various medical and veterinary practices related to melanocyte stimulating hormone receptors.\n\n\n \n\n\nTherapeutic use\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention have been tested in the melanocortin system and have surprisingly been shown to be capable of binding to MC receptors as well as showing activity in functional assays. The compounds of the present invention are either agonists or antagonists of a specific MC-receptor or of a number of MC-receptors, e.g. MCI, MC3, MC4 and/or MC5 receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe MC-receptors belong to the class of G-protein coupled receptors which are all built from a single polypeptide forming 7 transmembrane domains. Five such receptors types, termed MCI, MC2, MC3, MC4 and MC5, have been described. The MC receptor's signalling is mainly mediated via cAMP, but other signal transduction pathways are also known. They are distinctly distributed in the body.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMC-receptors are linked to a variety of physiological actions that are thought to be mediated by distinct subtypes of the MC-receptors. In many cases, however, it is not entirely clear which of the subtypes is responsible for the effect as exemplified by the finding that selective MC1 receptor agonists has marked anti-inflammatory action, but seems to lack the organ protective effect described for unspecific MC receptor agonists as α-MSH, where it has been suggested that additional MC3 and/or MC5 receptor stimulation are needed to get the organ protective effect. Another example is the central effects of melanocortin receptor stimulation where it is unclear whether both MC3 and MC4 receptor stimulation or only stimulation of one of the receptors are needed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt has long been known that MSH-peptides may affect many different processes such as motivation, learning, memory, behaviour (including feeding and sexual), inflammation (including immunostimulatory and immunosuppressive), body temperature, pain perception, blood pressure, heart rate, vascular tone, brain blood flow, trophic effects in different organs, nerve growth, placental development, endocrine and exocrine functions, aldosterone synthesis and release, thyroxin release, spermatogenesis, ovarian weight, prolactin and FSH secretion, effects or other hormones, uterine bleeding in women, sebum and pheromone secretion, blood glucose levels, natriuresis, intrauterine foetal growth, as well as other events surrounding parturition, (see, for example, \nEberle: The melanotropins: Chemistry, physiology and mechanisms of action. Basel: Karger, Switzerland. 1988, ISBN 3-8055-4678-5\n; \nGruber et al., Am. J. Physiol. 1989, 257, R681-R694\n; \nDe Wildt et al., J. Cardiovascular Pharmacology. 1995, 25, 898-905\n) as well as inducing natriuresis (\nTin et al., Hypertension. 1987, 10, 619-627\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMoreover, it is also well-known that the immunomodulatory action of α-MSH includes both immunostimulatory and immunosuppressive effects. Several studies have shown that α-MSH antagonises the effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6 and TNFα, and induces the production of the antiinflammatory cytokine, IL-10 (for review, see \nCatania & Lipton, Endocr Rev. 1993 Oct; 14(5): 564-76\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEating behaviour is regulated by a complex network of physiological regulatory pathways that involve both the central nervous system and peripheral sites. Factors such as leptin, insulin, NPY (neuropeptide Y), orexins, CRF (Corticotropin-Releasing Factor, release hormone) and melanocortic peptides (\nSchwartz, \n) are known to control the amount of food intake, which may affect body weight, body fat mass and growth rate. Recent studies have shown a role of MC-receptors, especially the MC4 receptor, for control of food intake, and there is evidence indicating that the melanocortins and the MC4 receptor are important factors downstream of leptin. Intracerebroventricular injections of the melanocortic peptides α-MSH and ACTH(1-24) have been shown to markedly inhibit feeding (\nPoggioli et al., Peptides, 1986, 7, 843-848\n; \nVergoni et al., Neuropeptides, 1986, 7, 153-158\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe MC5-receptor has recently been attributed a role in control of exocrine gland function 5 (\nvan der Kraan, et al., Endocrinol. 1998, 139, 2348-2355\n; \nChen et al., Cell. 1997, 91, 789-798\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, the melanocortic peptides have distinct effects on sexual functions in that they cause erection in males (\nDonovan, Psychol. Med., 1978, 8, 305-316\n), presumably mediated by a central agonistic effect of the peptide on MC-receptors. It has also been shown that an MC-receptor blocker could inhibit the erectogenic effect of melanocortic peptides (\nVergoni et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol., 1998, 362; 95-101\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention has valuable therapeutic properties, making them useful for the treatment of inflammatory conditions, e.g. acute or chronic inflammatory conditions, such as arthritis, including diseases associated with arthritis, osteoartritis, rheumatoid arthritis, spondylarthropathies (e.g. ankylosing spondilitis), reactive arthritis (including arthritis following rheumatic fever), Henoch-Schonlein purpura, and Reiter's disease, connective tissue disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus, polymyositis/dermatomyositis, systemic sclerosis, mixed connetive tissue disease, sarcoidosis and primary Sjogrens syndrome including keratoconjunctivitis sicca, polymyalgia rheumatica, and other types of vasculitis, crystal deposition diseases (including gout), pyrophosphate arthropathy, acute calcific periarthritis; inflammatory bowel disease (including Chrons disease and ulcertive colitis), diverticular disease of the colon, and irritable bowel syndrome, pancreatitis, inflammatory upper and lower airway diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), allergic and non-allergic asthma, allergic rhinitis, allergic and non-allergic conjunctivitis, allergic and non-allergic dermatitis, trauma and post operative stress syndromes, diabetes mellitus, insulin-resistance, metabolic syndrome, sexual dysfunction including dysfunction of male erection, eating disorders including anorexia, obesity, mental disorders, dysfunction of the endocrine system, drug-induced disorders of the blood and lymphoid system, allergy disorders, disorders of the cardiovascular system and pain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the following the conditions and diseases of which the compounds of the present invention are useful for treating, are described in details.\n\n\n \n\n\nInflammatory conditions\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCompounds of formula (I) and/or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts have valuable pharmacological properties, making them useful for the treatment of inflammation, an inflammatory condition or an inflammatory disease such as inflammation related to the production of nitric oxide, inflammation related to increased amounts (upregulated amounts) of inducible nitric oxide synthase, inflammation related to activation of transcriptional activators, inflammation related to nuclear factor kappa beta, inflammation related to macrophages, neutrophils, monocytes, keratinocytes, fibroblasts, melanocytes, pigment cells and endothelial cells, inflammation related to increased production and/or release of inflammatory cytokines, such as e.g. interleukins, in particular interleukin 1 (IL-1), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-α).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the present specification, \"increased production\" refers to increased formation, increased release, or increased amount of an endogenous compound locally, regionally or systemically in a patient compared to the amount of said endogenous compound in a healthy individual.

In short, murine B16-F1 melanoma cells expressing MC1, but not other MC receptors, were used for binding affinity studies against the murine MC1 receptor (Siegrist et al.; 1988, J. Recept. Res., 8(1-4):323-43). For human MC3, MC4 and MC5 receptor affinities human recombinant CHO cells were used (Schioth et al. 1997, Neuropeptides 31:565-71,1997). Cells were suspended in HEPES buffer and by use of microwell plates radio-ligands, as well as test compound, in the concentration range of 10\n-10\n to 10\n-6\n were added. After incubation at 37°C (22°C for the MC1 receptor assay) separation of bound and free [\n125\nI]-NDP-MSH was done by multiple washings with buffer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results were expressed as a percent of control specific binding obtained in the presence of the test compounds. Mean values for each assay are presented in Table I below. The IC\n50\n values (concentration causing a half-maximal inhibition of control specific binding) and Hill coefficients (\nn\nH\n \n) were determined by non-linear regression analysis of the competition curves using Hill equation curve fitting. The inhibition constants (K\ni\n) were calculated from the Cheng Prusoff equation (K\ni\n = IC\n50\n/(1+(L/K\nD\n)), where L = concentration of radio-ligand in the assay, and K\nD\n = affinity of the radio-ligand for the receptor).\n\n \nTable I\n \n \n \nAssay\n \nLigand\n \nConc.\n \nNon Specific\n \nIncubation\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMC\n1\n \n \n[\n125\nI]NDP-MSH\n \n0.05 nM\n \nNDP-MSH\n \n90 min/22°C\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1 µM)\n \n \n \n \n \nMC\n3\n \n(h)\n \n \n[\n125\nI]NDP-MSH\n \n0.075 nM\n \nNDP-\nMSH\n \n \n60 min/37°C\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1 µM)\n \n \n \n \n \nMC\n4\n \n(h)\n \n \n[\n125\nI]NDP-MSH\n \n0.05 nM\n \nNDP-MSH\n \n120 min/37°C\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1 µM)\n \n \n \n \n \nMC\n5\n \n(h)\n \n \n[\n125\nI]NDP-MSH\n \n0.05 nM\n \nNDP-\nMSH\n \n \n60 min/37°C\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1 µM)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThree reference compounds, all belonging to the class of compounds disclosed in \n \nWO 03/013509\n \n, as well as three compounds according to the present invention were tested.

The aim of the methods is to test the compounds of the invention for anti-inflammatory effects and ability to inhibit or prevent the cell/tissue/organ impairment or destruction occurring as a result of ischemia, inflammation or toxic effects of a drug.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn inflammatory response or an exacerbation in chronic inflammation is characterized by production of cell-derived mediators such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukins (IL-1ß, IL-8, IL10), nitric oxide (NO), and free oxygen radicals, which eventually will induce widespread endothelial damage with loss of arteriolar tonus in systemic vessels, increased capillary permeability, sustained hypotension and organ dysfunction, which in the lung is associated with accumulation of leucocytes including neutrophils and eosinophils within the alveolar space. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), released from infectious agents, plays a central role in the inflammatory response to infection by inducing a number of inflammatory mediators including TNF-α. Treatments with the ability to inhibit TNF-α production are therefore believed to have marked anti-inflammatory effects. The inventor is using LPS stimulation to produce an inflammatory response in a number of experimental setups and the primary marker for an anti-inflammatory effect of the compounds according to the invention is the ability to inhibit TNF-α production.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 4 \nIn vivo\n effect - Inhibition of LPS-induced TNF-α and IL10 production in rats\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExperimental animals.\n Female Wistar rats (~250 g) were obtained from the Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany, and housed in a temperature- (22-24°C) and moisture-controlled (40-70 %) room with a 12 h light-dark cycle (light on from 6:00 A.M. to 6:00 P.M.). The rats were maintained on a standard rodent diet with 140 mmol/kg of sodium, 275 mmol/kg potassium and 23% protein (Altromin International, Lage, Germany) and had free access to water.\n\n\nAnimal preparation.\n In isoflurane-nitrous oxide anesthesia, the animals were implanted with permanent medical grade Tygon catheters into the abdominal aorta and the inferior caval vein, respectively, via a femoral artery and vein. After instrumentation, the animals were housed individually for 7-10 days until the day of the experiment.\n\n\nExperimental protocol.\n Prior to the experiments all rats were adapted to the restraining cage used for the experiments by training. On the day of the experiment, the animal were transferred to a restraining cage, and an intravenous infusion of vehicle solution containing 150 mM glucose was started. The infusion rate was 0.5 ml/h throughout the experiment. After a short adaptation period, infusion of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was started. LPS (E \ncoli\n serotype 0127 B8, L 3129, Sigma, St. Louis, USA) was given at a dose of 4 mg/kg body weight delivered as an i.v. infusion over 1 hour.\n\nArterial blood samples of 0.3 ml were taken 120 minutes after start of the LPS infusion.\n\n\n \n\n\nExperimental groups:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn addition to LPS infusion all rats were treated with a bolus injection of:\n\n \n \n \nVehicle (0.5 \nmL\n 20% PEG200) or test compound in one of the following doses:\n\n \n0.1; 1.0; 5.0 mg/kg given intravenously 5 min prior to initiation of the LPS infusion.\n \n \n \n\n\nTest compounds:\n \nCompound\n 1 of the invention (\nfigure 1\n, structure no.1), \ncompound\n 2 of the invention (\nfigure 1\n, structure no.19) and \ncompound\n 3 of the invention (\nfigure 1\n, structure no. 53).\n\n\nMeasurement of TNF-α and IL-10 in plasma:\n The blood samples were collected in a prechilled test tube with 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 7.4, and 20 x 10\n6\n IU/ml aprotinin. After centrifugation at 4°C, plasma samples were transferred to pre-chilled test tubes and stored at -20°C for later measurements of TNF-α and IL-10. TNF-α and Il-10 in plasma were determined by an ELISA (Biotrak, Amersham, UK).\n\n\nStatistical analyses.\n Results are presented as means ± SE. A two-way ANOVA for repeated measures was used to test for differences between groups. In case of P<0.05, the differences between corresponding periods are evaluated by unpaired t-tests with Bonferroni's correction of the level of significance.\n    \n\n\nResults\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCompound no.1 and compound no.3 of the invention reduced LPS-induced TNF-α liberation as evaluated by the levels of serum TNF-α 120 min after initiation of the LPS infusion. At the 5.0 mg/kg dose level both compounds reduced the serum level of TNF-α by ~ 60 % when compared to vehicle treatment (13950±486 pg/ml) (see Table V). The maximal antiinflammatory effect of compound no.2 was obtained at the 0.1 mg/kg dose level (see Table V).\n\n \nTable V\n \n \n \nSerum TNF-α measured 120 after initiation of LPS infusion.

PBMC is isolated using Ficoll-Paque Plus as in Amersham's Instruction 71-7167-00 AD, 2002-06. PBMC is counted using Tryphan Blue Solution (Sigma) and incubated in RPMI 1640, (Applichem), supplemented with 10 mM Hepes (Sigma), 2 mM L-glutamin (Sigma), 0,1 % BSA (Sigma) and 50U/50µg/mL Penicillin/Streptomycin (Sigma) in the concentration 5 x 10\n5\n cells/mL. The isolated PBMC is incubated in a humidified 5% CO\n2\n, 95% air atmosphere, at 37°C, in 24 well flat-bottomed plates (Corning Incorporated) with medium, 10 ng LPS/mL (Sigma), and test compound. After 18 hours the samples are centrifuged, and TNF-α in the supernatants is measured using Tumour Necrosis Factor Alpha [(h)TNF-α] from Human Biotrak ELISA System (Amersham).\n\nThe samples are incubated as following per donor:\n\n \n \n \nPBMC's in RPMI (Time Control)\n \nPBMC's with 10 ng LPS/mL (Vehicle)\n \nPBMC's, 10 ng LPS/mL, 10\n-17\nM reference compound or test compound\n \nPBMC's, 10 ng LPS/mL, 10\n-15\nM reference compound or test compound\n \nPBMC's, 10 ng LPS/mL, 10\n-13\nM reference compound or test compound\n \nPBMC's, 10 ng LPS/mL, 10\n-11\nM reference compound or test compound\n \nPBMC's, 10 ng LPS/mL, 10\n-9\nM reference compound or test compound\n \nPBMC's, 10 ng LPS/mL, 10\n-7\n M reference compound or test compound\n \n\nAll samples are diluted from an initial stock solution between 1,4x10\n-4\nM and 1,8x10\n-3\nM.\n\nAll solutions are handled in BSA coated vials in order to protect against binding of the compound to the surface of the vials.\n\nData is presented as mean ± SE. The effect of test compounds on LPS induced TNF-α liberation is expressed as percentage of the TNF-α accumulation in the LPS-vehicle group.\n\nAll comparisons are analysed with Student's unpaired t-test. Differences are considered significant at probability levels (p) of 0.05.\n    \n\n\nExample 6\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\nInhibition of neutrophil and eosinophil infiltration after LPS-inhalation in rats.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMale Sprague-Dawley rats (weight ~200 g) from M&B A/S, DK-8680 Ry, Denmark, are used. The rats are caged in \nstandard cages type\n 3 and housed in a temperature- (22-24 °C) and moisture-controlled (40-70 %) room with a 12 h light-dark cycle (light on from 6:00 A.M. to 6:00 P.M.). The diet is autoclaved Altromin 1324 special formulation, Produced by Altromin Denmark, Chr. Pedersen A/S, 4100 Ringsted, Denmark. Diet and water are administered ad libitum.\n\nAfter acclimatization the rats are randomly allocated to the experimental groups and dosed i.v. with test compound at start of LPS-induction and once again 8 hours after LPS-induction.\n\nRats in groups of 3 are anaesthetized with 0,1 ml hypnorm/dormicum pr. 100 g and dosed i.v with the test compound. Immediately after dosing they are placed in the inhalation chamber where they are subjected to a nebulized LPS solution. The concentration of LPS is 1 mg/ml. Dosing time is 15 minutes. The rats are euthanized 24 hours after dosing with the test substance. At termination the rats are eutanized with CO\n2\n/O\n2\n.\n\nThen bronchoalveolar lavage is performed by installing and withdrawing 6 x 2,5 ml of PBS to the right lung. Lavage is done with the lungs remaining in the thorax after removing sternum and costae. The connection to the left lung is tied off during this procedure. Bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) is centrifuged at 1000 rpm at 4°C for 10 minutes. After removing the supernatant the cell pellet is resuspended in 0.5 ml PBS and total cell count performed. Two smears of BALF stained with May-Grüwald Giemsa stain is made from each rat. BALF from each rat is subjected to total cell count and to differential count of leucocytes.\n\n\n \n\n\nExperimental groups:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn addition to LPS infusion all rats are treated with bolus injections of either:\n\n \n \n \nVehicle (0.5 mL isotonic saline);\n \n\nReference compound: e.g. reference-compound no.1 (e.g. 0.1, 0.2, 1.0 or 5.0 mg/kg/bw) and/or reference-compound no.2 (e.g 0.1, 0.2, 1.0 or 5.0 mg/kg/bw) and/or reference-compound no.3 (0.1, 0,2, 1.0 or 5.0 mg/kg/bw) and/or α-MSH (e.g. 0.1, 0,2, 1.0 or 5.0 mg/kg/bw). Finally a time control group without LPS inhalation is treated with Vehicle.\n    \n\n\nStatistics\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nData are presented as mean ± S.E.. Between group comparisons are performed by one way analysis of variance followed by Fishers Least Significant Difference test. Differences are considered significant at the 0.05 level.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInhibition of LPS-induced cytokine release and pulmonary hypertension in pigs \nin vivo.\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nFemale Landrace pigs (~30 kg) are fasted overnight but allowed free access to water. Then the pigs are premedicated with intramuscular ketamine (10 mg/kg) and midazolam (0.25 mg/kg). Anesthesia is induced with intravenous ketamine (5 mg/kg). The pigs are orally intubated, and anesthesia is maintained with a continuous intravenous infusion of fentanyl (60 µg/kg/h and midazolam (6 mg/kg/h). The animals are ventilated with a volume-controlled ventilator (Servo 900 ventilator; Siemens Elema, Solna, Sweden) with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cm H\n2\nO. Tidal volume is kept at 10-15 ml/kg, and the respiratory rate adjusted (20-25 breaths/min) to maintain normocapnia (arterial carbon dioxide tension [PaCO\n2\n] in the range of 34-45 mmHg). Ventilation is performed with oxygen in air aimed tot reach an arterial oxygen tension (PaO\n2\n) higher than 105 mmHg. One arterial and 2 venous sheaths are placed in the carotid artery and corresponding veins for infusion, blood pressure measurements through fluid filled catheter, blood sampling and for introducing catheters.\n\nA Swan-Ganz catheter (Edwards Lifescience Corp., Irvine, CA) is inserted in the pulmonary artery via the right cava superior vein. Localization of the balloon-tipped catheter is determined by observing the characteristic pressure trace on the monitor as it is advance through the right side of the heart into the pulmonary artery as well as by x-ray. Another catheter (5 French; St. Jude Medical Company, St. Paul, MN) is inserted into the left carotid artery for continuous blood pressure monitoring and blood sampling. A urine catheter is inserted for urine collection. A temporary pace catheter is inserted through the venous sheath to the right atrium (x-ray guided) to standardise heart rate, when assessing cardiac performance.\n\n\nHemodynamic Monitoring.\n Continuous observations is performed of arterial blood pressure, heart rate (from the electrocardiogram), and pulmonary artery pressure (PAP).\n\n\nLipopolysaccharide Infusion.\n \nEscherichia coli\n lipopolysaccharide endotoxin, \n(E. coli\n 026:_6, Bacto Lipopolysaccharides; Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI) is dissolved in saline 120 min before each experiment to dissolve any precipitate. After a stabilization period, lipopolysaccharide infusion is started at baseline at a rate of 2.5 µg/kg/h and increased stepwise to 15 µg/kg/min during 30 min. After this, the fusion was kept at a rate of 2.5 µg/h kg/h during 150 min and thereafter discontinued.\n\n\nInterventional groups:\n The control group is given vehicle in equal volume to the intervention group immediately before LPS infusion is initiated. The interventional group is given a dose of reference compound (e.g. 0.1, 0.2, 1.0 or 5.0 mg/kg) or test compound (e.g 0.1, 0.2, 1.0 or 5.0 mg/kg), as a single intravenous bolus injection.\n\n\nCytokines.\n Fresh frozen plasma samples (-80°C) obtained from EDTA-stabilized blood is used for measurements of TNFα by use of commercial available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n\nStatistics.\n Data are presented as mean ± S.E.. Between group comparisons are performed by one way analysis of variance followed by Fishers Least Significant Difference test. Differences are considered significant at the 0.05 level.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the following two examples of models of temporarily ischemia are described. Ischemia induced by reduced/complete arrest in arterial blood supply induces multiple tissue reactions including neutrophil accumulation, other inflammatory responses and cell death. Identification of compounds that could inhibit or prevent (either completely or partially) many of the cell/tissue/organ impairments or destructions occurring as a result of ischemia/inflammation is of great benefit. The inventor is using two models of temporarily ischemia: 1) the myocardial ischemia reperfusion model in rats, which mimics the development of acute myocardial infarction followed by restoration of blood supply as it is achieved by either fibrinolytic therapy or coronary angioplasty (example 8); and 2) bilateral renal artery occlusion, which induces acute renal failure (ARF) comparable to AFR induced by temporarily reduction in the renal blood supply as seen in patients undergoing major surgical interventions (an example could be surgical intervention due to abdominal aorta aneurism) (example 9).\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInhibition of myocardial infarction size, induced by 60 minutes occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery in rats.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nBarrier-bred and specific pathogen-free female Wistar rats (250 g) are obtained from Charles River, Hannover, Germany. The animals are housed in a temperature (22-24°C) and moisture (40-70%) controlled room with a 12-hour light-dark cycle (light on from 6:00 A.M. to 6:00 P.M.). All animals are given free access to tap water and a pelleted rat diet containing approximately 140 mmol/kg of sodium, 275 mmol/kg potassium and 23% protein (Altromin catalogue no. 1310, Altromin International, Lage, Germany).\n\nThe rats are instrumented with permanent medical grade Tygon catheters in the inferior caval vein and the abdominal aorta via the femoral vein and artery. One week later the Rats are anaesthetized in an inhalation chamber with 4% isoflurane in O\n2\n, After insertion of an endotracheal tube the animal is artificially ventilated with 1.0% isoflurane in O\n2\n using af Hugo Basile Rodent ventilator. Tidal volume is 8-10 ml/kg b.w. and \nrespiratory rate\n 75 min\n-1\n, which maintains arterial pH between 7.35 and 7.45. During surgery the animal is placed on a heated table that maintains rectal temperature at 37-38°C. Standard ECG (second lead) is measured using a Hugo Sachs ECG Coupler and collected on line at 4,000 Hz in PowerLab. After parasternal thoracotomy and opening of the pericardium the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) is localized visually. An atraumatic 6-0 silk suture with an occluder that allows reopening of the ligature is placed around the LAD between the pulmonary trunk and the lower right end of the left auricle. After 10 minutes the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) is occluded. Successful occluding is confirmed by alterations in ECG (ST-segment elevation and increase in R-wave amplitude) and by fall in MAP. Reperfusion is made after 60 minutes by opening the occluder. Control rats are sham-operated.\n\nThe rats are subjected to one of the following i.v treatments:\n\n \n \n \n \nVehicle:\n 0.5 ml 150 mM NaCl.\n \n \nReference compound:\n e.g reference-compound no.1, reference-compound no.2 or reference-compound no.3 (e.g. 0.1, 0.2, 1.0 or 5.0 mg/kg b.w.) or e.g. α-MSH (e.g. 0.1, 0.2, 1.0 or 5.0 mg α-melanocyte stimulating hormone/kg b.w.) in 0.5 ml 150 mM NaCl.\n \n \nTest compound\n e.g. 0.1, 0.2, 1.0 or 5 mg test compound/kg b.w. in 0.5 ml 150 mM NaCl\n \n\nTreatment is given 5 minutes prior to reperfusion.\n    \n\n\nDetermination af the size of the ischemic and necrotic myocardium\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe rats are kept anaesthetized after the ischemia/reperfusion and re-occluding of the LAD is performed after three hours reperfusion. During this period ECG and MAP are measured continuously. Then Evans Blue dye (1 ml; 2% w/v) is administered i.v. to determine the size of the ischemic area. The heart is removed and cut into horizontal slices to determine the size of the ischemic area and to separate the ischemic myocardium from the non-ischemic myocardium. The ischemic area is isolated and incubated in a 0.5% triphenyltetrazolium chloride solution for 10 minutes at 37°C. The size of the necrotic tissue is then measured by used of a computerized image program. An additional setup of animals are treated with buprenorphine post-surgical and returned to there cages for measurement of left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) two weeks later in order to evaluate the effect of the pharmacological treatment on the development of congestive heart failure. LVEDP is measured using a 2F microtip catheters inserted into the left ventricle via the right carotid artery. Isoflurane concentration is adjusted to stabilize mean arterial pressure (MAP) at 85-90 mmHg.\n\n\n \n\n\nStatistics\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nData are presented as mean ± S.E.. Within group comparisons are analysed with Student's paired \nt\n test. Between group comparisons are performed by one way analysis of variance followed by Fishers Least Significant Difference test. Differences are considered significant at the 0.05 level.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInhibition of renal failure induced by 40 minutes bilateral occlusion of the renal arteries in rats\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nBarrier-bred and specific pathogen-free female Wistar rats (250 g) are obtained from Charles River, Hannover, Germany. The animals are housed in a temperature (22-24°C) and moisture (40-70%) controlled room with a 12-hour light-dark cycle (light on from 6:00 A.M. to 6:00 P.M.). All animals are given free access to tap water and a pelleted rat diet containing approximately 140 mmol/kg of sodium, 275 mmol/kg potassium and 23% protein (Altromin catalogue no. 1310, Altromin International, Lage, Germany).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe rats, which previously have been instrumented with a chronic venous catheter, are placed in metabolic cages and after a two days acclimation period to the metabolic cages, experimental ARF is induced by occlusion of both renal arteries for 60 min. During surgery, the rats are anesthetized with isoflurane-nitrous oxide and placed on a heated table to maintain rectal temperature at 37°C. Both kidneys are exposed through flank incisions, mobilized by being dissected free from the perirenal fat, then a small portion of the renal artery is gently dissected from the vein. The renal arteries are occluded with a smooth surfaced vascular clip (60 g pressure; World Precision Instruments, UK) for 40 min. Total ischemia is confirmed by observing blanching of the entire kidney surface. During the period of ischemia, the wounds are closed temporarily to maintain body temperature. After the clips are removed, the kidneys are observed for additional 2-5 min. to ensure color change, indicating blood reflow. Then the wound are closed with 3-0 silk ligatures. The rats returned to the metabolic cages, and daily 24 h urine output and water intake are measured for five days. As a control group, rats are subjected to sham operations identical to the ones used for ARF rats without occlusion of the renal arteries. Sham-operated rats are monitored in parallel with rats with ARF.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe rats are subjected to one of the following i.v treatments:\n\n \n \n \n \nVehicle:\n 0.5 ml 150 mM NaCl.\n \n \nReference compound:\n e.g reference-compound no.1, reference-compound no.2 or reference-compound no.3 (e.g. 0.1, 0.2, 1.0 or 5.0 mg/kg b.w.) or e.g. α-MSH (e.g. 0.1, 0.2, 1.0 or 5.0 mg α-melanocyte stimulating hormone/kg b.w.) in 0.5 ml 150 mM NaCl.\n \n \nTest compound:\n e.g. 0.1, 0.2, 1.0 or 5 mg test compound/kg b.w. in 0.5 ml 150 mM NaCl.

Within group comparisons are analysed with Student's paired t test. Between group comparisons are performed by one way analysis of variance followed by Fishers Least Significant Difference test. Differences are considered significant at the 0.05 level.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, an example (example 10) is given on a model of cisplatin-induced renal failure. Nephrotoxicity is a well-known side effect to cisplatin treatment. Though not necessarily dose limiting renal toxicity still affects the majority of patients and a significant decrease in glomerular filtration rate is observed during treatment. The renal toxicity of cisplatin is seen as a direct cytotoxic damage on the nephrons in the outer medulla especially in the S3 segment of the proximal tubules and in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. Hence cisplatin treatment often results in tubular reabsorption defects including an impaired ability to dilute the urine. Hypomagnesemia is observed in approximately 50% of patients treated with cisplatin and is probably due to a defect in renal magnesium (Mg) reabsorption. A recent study has suggested that Mg supplementation is a crucial factor in protection against the nephrotoxic actions of Cyclosporin A and a possible relation between Mg loss and cisplatin induced nephrotoxicity has recently been suggested. Treatment aimed to prevent hypomagnesemia would therefore have beneficial effects in order not only to reduce the need of Mg supplementation, but also in order to reduce the renal toxicity of cisplatin.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInhibition of Cisplatin induced renal failure\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nRats, which previously have been instrumented with a chronic venous catheter, are placed in metabolic cages and after a period of acclimation to the metabolic cages the rats are treated with an interperitoneal cisplatin injection 5.0 mg/kg bw in 0.5 ml 150 mM NaCl or vehicle (0.5 ml 150 mM NaCl). Five days later the rats are then returned to metabolic cages, and daily 24 h urine output and water intake are measured and collected for the next five days. All rats are then anesthetized in halothan/N\n2\nO and an arterial blood sample collected in prechilled EDTA coated vials. The blood samples are collected in a prechilled test tube with 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 7.4, and 20 x 10\n6\n IU/ml aprotinin. After centrifugation at 4°C, plasma samples are transferred to pre-chilled test tubes and stored at -20 °C for later measurements of creatinine and Magnesium (Mg). In addition to this creatinine is also measured in the urine collected in the last 24 hours period prior to the blood collection. Creatinine clearance (C\ncr\n), used as an index of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), can then be calculated as the C\ncr\n= V\nu\n x U\ncr/\nP\ncr\n, where V\nu\n is 24 hours urine production; U\ncr\n is the creatinine concentration on the urine and P\ncr\n is the creatinine concentration in plasma. Measurement of creatinine in urine and plasma is performed by use of the clinical chemistry systems VITROS 950 (Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics Inc., Johnson & Johnson, NJ) and Roche Hitachi Modular (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe rats are subjected to one of the following i.v treatments:\n\n \n \n \n \nVehicle:\n 0.5 ml 150 mM NaCl\n \n \nReference compound:\n e.g reference-compound no.1, reference-compound no.2 or reference-compound no.3 (e.g. 0.1, 0.2, 1.0 or 5.0 mg/kg b.w.) or e.g. α-MSH (e.g. 0.1, 0.2, 1.0 or 5.0 mg α-melanocyte stimulating hormone/kg b.w.) in 0.5 ml 150 mM NaCl.\n \n \nTest compound:\n e.g. 0.1, 0.2, 1.0 or 5 mg test compound/kg b.w. in 0.5 ml 150 mM NaCl.
