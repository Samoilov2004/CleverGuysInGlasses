Description\n\n\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to a biochemical fitness assay and related methods.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe development of drug resistance is one of the most perplexing challenges in the field of medicine. One of the most common causes of drug failure in the treatment of diseases involving replicating biological entities, for example, cancer and infectious diseases, is the emergence of drug resistance. One of the most dramatic and tragic examples of drug resistance can be found in connection with the antiviral therapy of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAIDS is a fatal disease, reported cases of which have increased dramatically within the past several years. Estimates of reported cases in the very near future also continue to rise dramatically.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe AIDS virus was first identified in 1983. It has been known by several names and acronyms. It is the third known T-lymphocyte virus (HTLV-III), and it has the capacity to replicate within cells of the immune system, causing profound cell destruction. The AIDS virus is a retrovirus, a virus that uses reverse transcriptase during replication. This particular retrovirus is also known as lymphadenopathy-associated virus (LAV), AIDS-related virus (ARV) and, most recently, as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Two distinct families of HIV have been described to date, namely HIV-1 and HIV-2. The acronym HIV will be used herein to refer to HIV viruses generically.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecifically, HIV is known to exert a profound cytopathic effect on the CD4+ helper/inducer T-cells, thereby severely compromising the immune system. HIV infection also results in neurological deterioration and, ultimately, in the death of the infected individual.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe field of viral chemotherapeutics has developed in response to the need for agents effective against retroviruses, in particular HIV. For example anti-retroviral agents, such as 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (AZT), 2'3'-dideoxycytidine (ddC), and 2'3'-dideoxyinosine (ddI) are known to inhibit reverse transcriptase. There also exist antiviral agents that inhibit transactivator protein. Nucleoside analogs, such as AZT, are currently available for antiviral therapy. Although very useful, the utility of AZT and related compounds is limited by toxicity and insufficient therapeutic indices for fully adequate therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRetroviral protease inhibitors also have been identified as a class of anti-retroviral agents. Retroviral protease processes polyprotein precursors into viral structural proteins and replicative enzymes. This processing is essential for the assembly and maturation of fully infectious virions. Accordingly, the design of protease inhibitors remains an important therapeutic goal in the treatment of AIDS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe use of HIV protease inhibitors, in combination with agents that have different antiretroviral mechanisms (e.g., AZT, ddI and ddT), also has been described. For example, synergism against HIV-1 has been observed between certain C\n2\n symmetric HIV inhibitors and AZT (\nKageyama et al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., 36, 926-933 (1992\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNumerous classes of potent peptidic inhibitors of protease have been designed using the natural cleavage site of the precursor polyproteins as a starting point. These inhibitors typically are peptide substrate analogs in which the scissile P\n1\n-P\n1\n' amide bond has been replaced by a non-hydrolyzable isostere with tetrahedral geometry (\nMoore et al, Perspect. Drug Dis. Design, 1, 85 (1993\n); \nTomasselli et al., Int. J. Chem. Biotechnology, 6 (1991\n); \nHuff, J. Med. Chem., 34, 2305 (1991\n); \nNorbeck et al., Ann. Reports Med. Chem., 26, 141 (1991\n); and \nMeek, J. Enzyme inhibition, 6, 65 (1992\n)). Although these inhibitors are effective in preventing the retroviral protease from functioning, the inhibitors suffer from some distinct disadvantages. Generally, peptidomimetics often make poor drugs, due to their potential adverse pharmacological properties, i.e., poor oral absorption, poor stability and rapid metabolism (Plattner et al, Drug \nDiscovery Technologies,\n Clark et al., eds., Ellish Horwood, Chichester, England (1990)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe design of the HIV-1 protease inhibitors based on the transition state mimetic concept has led to the generation of a variety of peptide analogs highly active against viral replication \nin vitro\n (\nErickson et al, Science, 249, 527-533 (1990\n); \nKramer et al., Science, 231, 1580-1584 (1986\n); \nMcQuade et al., Science, 247, 454-456 (1990\n); \nMeek et al., Nature (London), 343, 90-92 (1990\n); and \nRoberts et al., Science, 248, 358-361 (1990\n)). These active agents contain a non-hydrolyzable, dipeptidic isostere, such as hydroxyethylene (McQuade et al., \nsupra;\n \nMeek et al., Nature (London), 343, 90-92 (1990\n); and \nVacca et al., J. Med. Chem., 34, 1225-1228 (1991\n)) or hydroxyethylamine (\nGhosh et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 8, 687-690 (1998\n); \nGhosh et al., J. Med. Chem., 36, 292-295 (1993\n)); \nRich et al., J. Med. chem., 33, 1285-1288 (1990\n); and \nRoberts et al., Science, 248, 358-361 (1990\n)) as an active moiety that mimics the putative transition state of the aspartic protease-catalyzed reaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo-fold (C\n2\n) symmetric inhibitors of HIV protease represent another class of potent HIV protease inhibitors, which were created by Erickson et al., on the basis of the three-dimensional symmetry of the enzyme active site (Erickson et al. (1990), \nsupra).\n Typically, however, the usefulness of currently available HIV protease inhibitors in the treatment of AIDS has been limited by relatively short plasma half-life, poor oral bioavailability, and the technical difficulty of scale-up synthesis (Meek et al. (1992), \nsupra) .\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a continuing effort to address the problem of short plasma half-life and poor bioavailability, new HIV protease inhibitors have been identified. For example, HIV protease inhibitors incorporating the 2,5-diamino-3,4-disubstituted-1,6-diphenylhexane isostere are described in \nGhosh et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 8, 687-690 (1998\n) and \n \nU.S. Patent Nos. 5,728,718 (Randad et al.\n \n). HIV protease inhibitors, which incorporate the hydroxyethylamine isostere, are described in \n \nU.S. Patent Nos. 5,502,060 (Thompson et al.\n \n), \n \n5,703,076 (Talley et al.\n \n), and \n \n5,475,027 (Talley et al.\n \n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecent studies, however, have revealed the emergence of mutant strains of HIV, in which the protease is resistant to the C\n2\n symmetric inhibitors (\nOtto et al., PNAS USA, 90, 7543 (1993\n) ; \nHo et al., J. Virology, 68, 2016-2020 (1994\n); and \nKaplan et al., PNAS USA, 91, 5597-5601 (1994\n)). In one study, the most abundant mutation found in response to a C\n2\n symmetry based inhibitor was Arg to Gln at position 8 (R8Q), which strongly affects the S\n3\n/S\n3\n, subsite of the protease binding domain. In this study, the shortening of the P\n3\n/P\n3\n, residues resulted in inhibitors that were equipotent towards both wild-type and R8Q mutant proteases (\nMajer et al., 13th American Peptide Symposium, Edmonton, Canada (1993\n)). Inhibitors have been truncated to P\n2/\np\n2\n, without significant loss of activity (\nLyle et al., J. Med. Chem., 34, 1230 (1991\n); and \nBone et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 113, 9382 (1991\n)). These results suggest that inhibitors can be truncated and yet maintain the crucial interactions necessary for strong binding. The benefits of such an approach include the elimination of two or more peptide bonds, the reduction of molecular weight, and the diminishment of the potential for recognition by degradative enzymes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore recently, new mutant strains of HIV have emerged that are resistant to multiple, structurally diverse, experimental and chemotherapeutic retroviral protease inhibitors. Such multidrug-resistant HIV strains are typically found in infected patients, who had undergone treatment with a combination of HIV protease inhibitors or a series of different HIV protease inhibitors. The number of reported cases of patients infected with multidrug-resistant HIV is rising dramatically. Tragically for these patients, the available options for AIDS chemotherapy and/or HIV management is severely limited or is, otherwise, completely nonexistent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDrug resistance is unfortunately the most common reason for drug failures generally. One of the most dramatic examples of drug failure due to resistance is in HIV therapy. Once HIV resistance is obtained to first-line therapy, the chances of future success are greatly diminished because of the development of multidrug cross resistance. Other diseases involving infectious agents (e.g., viruses, bacteria, protozoa, and prions) or other disease-causing cells (e.g., tumor cells) present similar challenges in that drug resistance is a primary cause of drug failure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn view of the foregoing problems, there exists a need to determine whether a mutant will be capable of replicating in the presence of a drug. There also exists a need for a method of predicting whether drug resistance is likely to emerge in a disease involving a-replicating biological entity. There is also a need for a method of devising a long-term therapeutic regimen that minimizes the likelihood that resistance will occur in a disease involving a replicating biological entity. Moreover, there is a need for a method of preventing or inhibiting the development of drug resistance in such diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides such methods. These and other advantages of the present invention, as well as additional inventive features, will be apparent from the description of the invention provided herein.\n\n\n \nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention is predicated on the surprising and unexpected discovery that biochemical \"vitality,\" as described below, can be used to determine the biological fitness of a mutant replicating biological entity relative to its predecessor under the selection pressure of an inhibitor. The present invention provides an assay for determining the biochemical fitness of a biochemical target (i.e., a biomolecule having a biochemical function), of a mutant replicating biological entity relative to its predecessor's biochemical target, in the presence of a compound that acts upon the biochemical target. The assay method of the present invention includes obtaining the predecessor, determining the biochemical vitality of the biochemical target of both the predecessor and the mutant in the presence of a compound that acts upon the biochemical target of the predecessor, and comparing the vitality of the mutant's biochemical target relative to the vitality of-the predecessor's biochemical target. Where the biochemical vitality of the mutant is greater than the biochemical fitness of the predecessor, the mutant is predicted to be more biologically fit in the presence of the compound. The assay method can thus be used to predict the emergence of drug resistance for a particular replicating biological entity (e.g., a disease-causing cell) in the presence a drug (e.g., an inhibitor). Utilization of the assay in accordance with the present invention permits the administration of an inhibitor or combination of inhibitors to treat a disease in a way that decreases the likelihood that drug resistance will develop.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention further provides a continuous fluorogenic assay for measuring the anti-HIV protease activity of a protease inhibitor. The continuous fluorogenic assay of the present invention utilizes a substrate of the formula Ala-Arg-Val-Tyr-Phe(NO\n2\n)-Glu-Ala-Nle-NH\n2\n. The continuous fluorogenic assay of the present invention is highly sensitive and particularly useful for the prediction of the antiviral inhibitory activity of a compound against mutant HIV.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention further provides a method of administering a therapeutic compound that inhibits a biochemical target of a disease-causing replicating biological entity. The therapeutic compound, when administered in accordance with the method of the present invention, minimizes the chances that the disease-causing entity will develop drug resistance. As such, the method of administering a therapeutic compound in accordance with the present invention improves the chances of long-term success in therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present method of administering a therapeutic compound involves the identification of at least one mutant replicating biological entity (the mutant) capable of evolving from the disease-causing replicating biological entity (the predecessor). Biochemical fitness is determined by comparing the biochemical vitality of the mutant's biochemical target with the biochemical vitality of the predecessor's biochemical target. Biochemical fitness is determined in the presence of a drug (e.g, an inhibitor). The biochemical vitality of the mutant's biochemical target is compared to biochemical vitality of the predecessor's biochemical target in the presence of the drug. When there are two or more drugs available for treatment, biochemical fitness can be determined for each drug in accordance with the present invention. A therapeutic compound is then administered from among one of the compounds that produces a lower value for biochemical fitness with respect to one or more mutants. Administration of a therapeutic compound producing a lower fitness value for a particular mutant indicates that the predecessor is less likely to develop resistance in the presence of that compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides a method of preventing the development of drug resistance of HIV in an HIV-infected mammal by the administration of a drug resistance-inhibiting effective amount of a compound of the formula:\n\n \n \n\nor a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, a prodrug, or an ester thereof, or a pharmaceutical composition thereof, wherein:\n\n \n \n \nA is a group of the formula:\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n1\n is H or an alkyl, an alkenyl, an alkynyl, a cycloalkyl, a cycloalkylalkyl, an aryl, an aralkyl, a heterocycloalkyl, a heterocycloalkylalkyl, a heteroaryl, or a heteroaralkyl radical, which unsubstituted or substituted;\n \nY and Z are the same or different and are each selected from the group consisting of CH\n2\n, O, S, SO, SO\n2\n, NR\n8\n, R\n8\nC (O) N, R\n8\nC(S)N, R\nB\nOC (O) N, R\n8\nOC (S) N, R\n8\nSC (O) N\n,\n R\n8\nR\n9\nNC (O) N, and R\n8\nR\n9\nNC (S) N, wherein R\n8\n and R\n9\n are each H, an alkyl, an alkenyl, or an alkynyl;\n \nn is an integer from 1 to 5;\n \nX is a covalent bond, CHR\n10\n, CHR\n10\nCH\n2\n, CH\n2\nCHR\n10\n, , NR\n10\n, or S, wherein R\n10\n is H, an alkyl, an alkenyl, or an alkynyl;\n \nQ is C(O), C(S), or SO\n2\n \n \nR\n2\n is H, an alkyl, an alkenyl, or an alkynyl;\n \nm is an integer from 0 to 6;\n \nR\n3\n is a cycloalkyl, a heterocycloalkyl, an aryl, or a heteroaryl which is unsubstituted or substituted;\n \nR\n4\n is OH, =O (keto), NH\n2\n, or a derivative thereof;\n \nR\n5\n is H, a C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkyl radical, a C\n2\n-C\n6\n alkenyl radical, or (CH\n2\n) \nq\nR\n14\n, wherein q is an integer form o to 5, and R\n14\n is a cycloalkyl, a heterocycloalkyl, an aryl, or a heteroaryl which is unsubstituted or substituted;\n \nW is C(O), C(S), S(O), or SO\n2\n; and\n \nR\n6\n is a cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, aryl, or heteroaryl which is unsubstituted or substituted.

The \"vitality\" of a biochemical target of a mutant replicating biological entity relative to the \"vitality\" of its predecessor's biochemical target is defined herein as the \"biochemical fitness.\"\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Vitality\" as utilized herein describes the ability of a particular biomolecular \"target\" (i.e., a biochemical species intended to be inhibited by a particular inhibitor) to perform its biochemical function in the presence of the inhibitor. Biochemical vitality is a function of at least two variables: the ability of a particular inhibitor to inhibit a biochemical target of the replicating biological entity in question, and the ability of the cell's biochemical target to inherently perform its biochemical function (irrespective of an inhibitor). Biochemical vitality also can include other factors that effect the ability of a biochemical target to perform its biochemical function in the presence of the inhibitor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe biochemical target in question can include, for example, a biochemical species with one or more known or unknown biological functions. The biochemical target can be, for example, a biochemical species having one or more specific biochemical function, or it can be a biochemical species that effects or influences a biochemical function directly or indirectly. Suitable biochemical targets include, for example, enzymes, proteins, oligomers, receptors, and the like. Suitable enzymes include, for example, reverse transcriptases, proteases (e.g., retroviral proteases, plasmepsins, and the like), methylases, oxidases, esterases, acyl transferases, and the like. Suitable enzymes also include, for example, viral and non-viral helicases, topoisomerases, DNA gyrases, DNA and RNA polymerases, parasite-encoded proteases, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable proteins include, for example, proteins that incorporate a conformational change as a major functional requirement, and the like. Examples of such proteins include HIV gp41 and other fusogenic viral proteins and peptides, topoisomerases, and all DNA enzymes, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable oligomers include, for example, oligomers that require oligomerization in order to perform their biochemical function. Examples of such oligomers include HIV protease, retroviral fusion proteins, peptides, HIV gp 41, viral and non-viral membrane fusion proteins, tumor suppressor proteins (e.g., p53, and the like) prions, ribosomes, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ability of a particular inhibitor to inhibit a biochemical target of a particular replicating biological entity can be determined by any suitable method and/or can be obtained from any suitable source. The ability of a particular inhibitor to inhibit a biochemical function of a replicating biological entity can be determined, for example, on the basis of a measurable property, or a measurable relationship of properties, that correlate with the ability of the inhibitor to inhibit the target. Suitable methods for determining the ability of the inhibitor to inhibit the target include, for example, assays, and the like. In some instances, the ability of the inhibitor to inhibit the target can be obtained from one or more suitable sources, for example, assay data from a database, a textbook, or the literature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the biochemical target is a protein, the ability of an inhibitor to inhibit the protein can be determined, for example, by obtaining the equilibrium dissociation constant (K\nd\n) of drug binding to the target where drug binding interferes with the function of the protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the biochemical target is an enzyme, the ability of an inhibitor to inhibit the enzyme can be determined, for example, by obtaining the inhibition constant (K\ninh\n) , or the like. The inhibition constant can be in terms of drug inhibition constant for the effect of the drug on substrate catalysis (e.g., K\ni\n) or dissociation constant for drug binding (e.g.;- K\nd\n) where drug binding correlates with inhibition of enzyme function.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the biochemical target is an oligomer, the ability of an inhibitor to inhibit the oligomer can be determined, for example, by obtaining the equilibrium dissociation constant (K\nd\n) for drug binding where drug binding interferes with oligomerization of the target.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere the biochemical target is a protein that requires a conformational change for its function, the ability of an inhibitor to inhibit the conformational change can be determined, for example, by obtaining the equilibrium dissociation constant (K\nd\n) for drug binding where drug binding interferes with the conformational change of the target.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the biochemical target is a protein that is required to bind to a ligand, macromolecule, or macromolecular complex to perform its biochemical function, the ability of an inhibitor to inhibit the protein function can be determined by obtaining the equilibrium dissociation constant (K\nd\n) for drug binding where drug binding interferes with ligand binding, macromolecule binding, or macromolecular complex binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the biochemical target is a nucleic acid binding protein, the ability of an inhibitor to inhibit the nucleic acid binding protein's function can be determined by obtaining the equilibrium dissociation constant (K\nd\n) for drug binding where drug binding interferes with nucleic acid binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVitality also is a function of the biochemical target's ability to inherently perform its biochemical function (irrespective of an inhibitor). The biochemical target's ability to inherently perform its biochemical function can be determined by any suitable method and/or can be obtained from any suitable source. The biochemical target's ability to inherently perform its biochemical function can be determined, for example, on the basis of a measurable property, or measurable relationship of properties, that correlate with the ability of the biochemical target's ability to inherently perform its biochemical function. Suitable methods for determining the biochemical target's ability to inherently perform its biochemical function include, for example, biochemical assays, and the like. In some instances, the ability of a cell's biochemical target to inherently perform its biochemical function can be obtained from one or more suitable sources, for example, assay data from a database, a textbook, or the literature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the biochemical target is an enzyme, the ability of the enzyme to inherently perform its biochemical function can be determined, for example, by determining the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. For example, the catalytic efficiency for enzymes that exhibit Michaelis-Menten kinetics can be determined by obtaining the k\ncat\n/K\nM\n ratio, or by a similar method, wherein k\ncat\n is the catalytic rate and K\nM\n is the Michaelis constant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the biochemical target is a protein, the ability of the protein to inherently perform its biochemical function can be determined, for example, by obtaining the equilibrium constant (K\neq\n) for the biochemical function of the protein, or the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the biochemical target is an oligomer, the ability of an inhibitor to perform its biological function can be determined, for example, by obtaining the equilibrium constant (K\neq\n) that is associated with oligomerization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere the biochemical target is a protein that requires a conformational change for its function, the ability of the target to perform its function can be determined, for example, by obtaining the equilibrium constant (K\neq\n) associated with conformational change.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the biochemical target is a protein that is required to bind to a ligand to perform its function, the ability of the target to perform its function can be determined, for example, by obtaining the equilibrium dissociation constant (K\nd\n) for ligand binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the biochemical target is a nucleic acid binding protein, the ability of an inhibitor to perform its function can be determined by obtaining the equilibrium dissociation constant (K\nd\n) for nucleic acid binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be appreciated that vitality also can be a function of other factors that effect the ability of a biochemical target to perform its biochemical function in the presence of the inhibitor. If the biochemical target is a dimeric species, for example, other factors that influence biochemical vitality might include the ability of the species to dimerize in the presence and/or in the absence of the inhibitor. If, by way of example, a mutation causes the dimerization rate to become a factor in the biochemical function of the biochemical-target of the mutant relative to its predecessor's, then dimerization rate can be included in the vitality determination.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe biochemical vitalities of a mutant replicating biological entity and its predecessor, when compared, describes the biochemical fitness of the target of the mutant cell. In keeping with the invention, it has been found that the biochemical fitness relates to the biological fitness of the mutant in the presence of the inhibitor. When the value for the biochemical vitality of the target of the mutant exceeds the value for the biochemical vitality of the target of a predecessor of the mutant, the target of the mutant has greater biochemical fitness in the presence of the inhibitor. In such cases, the mutant replicating biological entity is favored over the predecessor and resistance to the inhibitor that is used to treat the predecessor is likely to develop.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBiochemical vitality can be determined in many different ways that suitably relate the various factors relating to the biochemical vitality of the target. For example, a mathematical function may be used to relate the various factors. By way of illustration, when the biochemical target is an enzyme, the vitality can be determined as a function of K\ninh\n (e.g., K\ni\n or K\nd\n) and enzymatic or catalytic efficiency (e.g., K\ncat\n/K\nM\n) - Vitality can be determined as the product of K\ninh\n and enzymatic efficiency, for example, (K\ninh\n) x (catalytic efficiency), or (K\ni\n) x (catalytic efficiency) or (K\nd\n)(catalytic efficiency). Alternatively, vitality can be determined, for example, as the log of the product of K\ninh\nand enzymatic efficiency, for example, log[(K\ninh\n) x (catalytic efficiency)], or log[(K\ni\n) x (catalytic efficiency)] or log [ (K\nd\n) x (catalytic efficiency) ] . Similarly, for enzymes that exhibit Michaelis-Menten kinetics, vitality can be determined as a function of K\ninh\n (e.g., K\ni\n or K\nd\n) and the kcat/K\nM\n ratio. For example, vitality can be determined as the product of K\ninh\n, and k\ncat\n/K\nM\n, e.g., (K\ninh\n) x (k\ncat/\nK\nM\n), wherein K\ninh\n is K\ni\n or K\nd\n. Alternatively, vitality can be determined, for example, as the log of the product of K\ninh\n and k\ncat\n/K\nM\n e.g., log[(K\ninh\n) x (K\ncat/\nK\nM\n)], wherein K\ninh\n is K\ni\n or K\nd\n. In a preferred embodiment, the biochemical target is an enzyme and the vitality is (K\ni\n) x (k\ncat\n/K\nM\n), or log [ (K\ni\n) x (k\ncat\n/K\nM\n)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Fitness,\" unless otherwise indicated, means biochemical fitness. \"Biochemical fitness\" as utilized herein is a value that represents the vitality of a biochemical target of a mutant replicating biological entity relative to the vitality the biochemical target of its predecessor. Biochemical fitness is determined by comparing the vitality of a biochemical target of a mutant replicating biological entity relative to that of its predecessor. Any suitable comparison of the vitality of a biochemical target of a mutant replicating biological entity relative to that of its predecessor can be used in the determination of fitness. For example, biochemical fitness can be determined as the difference between the biochemical vitality of a biochemical target of a predecessor (biochemical vitality\npred\n) and the biochemical vitality of the biochemical target of a particular mutant replicating biological entity that can evolve-from-the predecessor (biochemical vitality\nmut\n), e.g., (biochemical vitality\nmut\n) - (biochemical vitality\nPred\n). If biochemical fitness is determined on the basis of this difference, then a positive value indicates that the mutant has a higher fitness relative to its predecessor in the presence of the inhibitor, whereas a negative value indicates that the mutant is less fit relative to its predecessor. A value of zero indicates that the fitness of the mutant and the predecessor are equal. A higher positive value indicates a greater chance that resistance to the inhibitor will emerge, whereas a higher negative value indicates a lower chance that resistance to the inhibitor will emerge.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, and preferably, fitness can be determined as the quotient of two biochemical vitalities, for example, as the quotient of a biochemical target of a particular mutant replicating biological entity and the biochemical vitality of the biochemical target of a predecessor, e.g., \n \n \nfitness\n \n=\n \n \n \nvitality\n \nmut\n \n \n \nvitality\n \npred\n \n \n \n.\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf fitness is determined on the basis of this quotient, then a value greater than one indicates that the mutant has a higher fitness relative to its predecessor, in the presence of the inhibitor. A value of one indicates that the fitness of the mutant and the predecessor are equal. A value less than one indicates that the mutant is less fit relative to its predecessor. A higher value indicates a greater chance that resistance to the inhibitor/drug will emerge, whereas a lower value indicates a lower chance that resistance to the inhibitor/drug will emerge. A value less than one indicates that the mutant will not emerge in the presence of the inhibitor/drug.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, fitness can be determined as the log of the quotient of two biochemical vitalities, for example, as the log of the quotient of a biochemical target of a particular mutant replicating biological entity and the biochemical vitality of the biochemical target of a predecessor, e.g., \n \n \nfitness\n \n=\n \nlog\n \n \n \n \nvitality\n \nmut\n \n \n \nvitality\n \npred\n \n \n \n \n.\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf fitness is determined on the basis of this log, then a value greater than zero indicates that the mutant has a higher fitness relative to its predecessor, in the presence of the inhibitor. A negative value indicates that the mutant is less fit relative to its predecessor. A value of zero indicates that the fitness of the mutant and the predecessor are equal. A higher positive value indicates a greater chance that resistance to the inhibitor/drug will emerge, whereas a lower positive value indicates a lower chance that resistance to the inhibitor/drug will emerge. A negative value indicates that the mutant will not emerge in the presence of the inhibitor/drug.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFitness can be determined in the presence of any suitable compound that inhibits a biochemical target from performing its biological function. The inhibitor, for example, can be a compound that inhibits an enzyme. Suitable enzyme inhibitors include, for example, protease inhibitors, reverse transcriptase inhibitors, DNA polymerase inhibitors, methylase inhibitors, oxidase inhibitors, esterase inhibitors, acyl transferase inhibitors, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable protease inhibitors include, for example, viral protease inhibitors, plasmepsin inhibitors, and cathepsin D inhibitors. In a preferred embodiment, the inhibitor is a viral protease inhibitor, more preferably a retroviral protease inhibitor, still more preferably an HIV-1 or an HIV-2 protease inhibitor, and most preferably and HIV-1 protease inhibitor. Exemplary HIV-1 protease inhibitors include, for example, saquinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir, and HIV-1 protease inhibitors that are undergoing clinical trials, e.g., tipranavir (PNU-140690).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable plasmepsin inhibitors include, for example, inhibitors of plasmepsin I or II, including inhibitors of plasmepsin I or II that have antimalarial activity. Suitable inhibitors of cathepsin D include, for example, cathepsin D inhibitors that inhibit cathepsin D in primary breast cancer tissues, including cathepsin D inhibitors that inhibit cathepsin D in primary breast cancer tissues and would be expected to lower the risk of metastasis and/or shorter relapse-free survival in breast cancer patients. \nSee, e.g.,\n \nGulnik et al., J. Mol. Biol., 227, 265-270 (1992\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable reverse transcriptase inhibitors include, for example, retroviral reverse transcriptase inhibitors, e.g., AZT, 3TC, ddI, ddC, D4T, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable protein inhibitors include, for example, compounds that inhibit a conformational change in a protein, and the like. Suitable oligomerization inhibitors include, for example, T-20 peptide inhibitor, of HIV-1 fusion and other compounds that inhibit oligomers from oligomerizing on a cell surface or within a cell membrane.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with the present invention, fitness in the presence of an inhibitor can be determined for a biological entity that produces or includes a biological target of the inhibitor. The biological entity is preferably a replicating biological entity, for example, a virus, a parasite, or a cell, preferably a disease-causing cell. Disease-causing replicating biological entities include, for example, tumor cells, cancer cells, and infectious organisms (e.g., fungi, protozoa, bacteria, and the like) and prions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCancer cells include, for example, cells associated with breast cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer, and the like. Fitness can be determined for a rapidly growing tumor cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFungi include, for example, candida albicans, and the like. Protozoa include, for example, trypanosome species, schistosomial species, malarial protozoa, e.g., Plasmodium species. Plasmodium species include, for example, Plasmodium Falciparum, Plasmodium ovale, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae, and the like. Bacteria include, for example, Helicobacter pylori, Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureas, Bacillus anthrax, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Hemophilus influenza, and the like. Viruses include, for example, retroviruses (e.g., HIV-1 and HIV-2), herpes viruses, cytomegaloviruses, influenza viruses, epstein-barr virus (EBV), Kaposi's sarcoma herpes virus (KSHV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), human papillomavirus (HPV3), echovirus, picornaviruses, rhinoviruses, poliovirus, coxsackie virus, measles, mumps, human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV-1), rubella, rotaviruses, yellow fever virus, ebola virus, and other pathogenic viruses, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReplicating biological entities also include multicellular organisms, for example, infectious microorganisms, e.g., helminths. Helminths include, for example, hookworms (e.g., ancylostoma duodenale) strongyloides stercoralis, fasciola hepatica, trichuris trichiura, trichinella spiralis, taenia solium, taenia saginata, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is believed that drug resistance is the evolutionary result of fitness-based selection of mutant cells/microorganisms in the presence of a drug (or any compound that has biological activity). In accordance with the present invention, the emergence (or non-emergence) of drug resistance in a disease caused by a disease-causing replicating biological entity can be predicted by determining the fitness of a biochemical target of a mutant in the presence of the drug. Thus, the emergence (or non-emergence) of drug resistance can be predicted on the basis of biochemical fitness. While resistance profiles may, in some instances, reflect fitness, it cannot be assumed that the emergence of drug resistance for a particular mutant can be directly predicted on the basis of its resistance profile alone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention thus provides an assay that can be used to predict the biological fitness of a replicating biological entity in the presence of a particular inhibitor. In a preferred embodiment, an assay is provided for determining the biochemical fitness of a biochemical target of a mutant replicating biological entity relative to its predecessor. In accordance with the assay of the present invention, a predecessor to the mutant is obtained, the biochemical vitality of the biochemical target of the predecessor in the presence of a compound capable of inhibiting the biochemical target of the predecessor is determined, the biochemical vitality of the biochemical target of the mutant in the presence of the compound is determined, and the biochemical vitality of the biochemical target of the mutant relative to the biochemical vitality of the biochemical target of the predecessor are compared.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe assay can be used with a wide variety of infectious microorganisms, as described above, including, for example, a virus, a fungus, a protozoa, or bacterium, a retrovirus, including HIV-1 or HIV-2, and cancer cells. When the infectious microorganism is a protozoa, it is preferably a malarial parasite, which is more preferably a plasmodium species.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the predecessor is a cancer cell, which is preferably a rapidly growing tumor cell, for example, a rapidly growing cancer cell found in breast cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer, a tumor cell of a lymphoid origin, a tumor-derived cell with a high metastatic potential, or the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe assay of the present invention can be applied to any suitable biochemical target, preferably a biochemical target whose biochemical vitality can be determined using measurable properties that can be obtained by assay. Desirably, the biochemical target is one that plays an important role in the replication and growth of the entity. By way of example, the biochemical target of the predecessor (and the mutant) can be an enzyme and the compound can be an inhibitor of the enzyme of the predecessor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe enzyme can be a viral enzyme. Illustrative of viral enzymes are a viral protease enzyme, a viral reverse transcriptase, a viral integrase, a viral polymerase, a viral protein with enzymatic activity, or a retroviral enzyme, including an HIV-1 or an HIV-2 enzyme. Viral protease enzymes, include a retroviral protease, such as an HIV-1 protease or an HIV-2 protease. Viral integrase enzymes include, for example, HIV-1 integrase, HIV-2 integrase, and the like. Viral polymerase can be a retroviral polymerase, including an HIV-1 polymerase or an HIV-2 polymerase. A viral protein with enzymatic activity can be a retroviral protein, such as an HIV-1 protein or an HIV-2 protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe enzyme also can be a protozoal enzyme, including a protozoal protease enzyme. The protozoal protease can be a malarial protease. The malarial protease can be a plasmepsin, including plasmepsin I or plasmepsin II. The malarial enzyme can also be a plasmodial enzyme or a protein with enzymatic activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment, the biochemical target of the predecessor is an oligomer and the compound inhibits the oligomerization of the oligomer of the predecessor. In yet another embodiment, the biochemical target of the predecessor is a protein and the compound inhibits a conformational change in the protein of the predecessor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe biochemical vitality determination can also take into account other factors, preferably measurable factors, that effect the ability of a biochemical target to perform its biochemical function in the presence of the inhibitor. When the biochemical target is an enzyme and the compound is an enzyme inhibitor, the biochemical vitality of the enzyme of the mutant replicating biological entity preferably corresponds to K\ninh-mut,\n k\ncat-mut,\n K\nM-mut\n, and the biochemical vitality of the enzyme of the predecessor preferably corresponds to K\ninh-pred\n, k\ncat-pred,\n and K\nM-pred\n. K\ninh\n is an inhibition constant of the compound, K\ncat\n is the biochemical catalytic rate, and K\nM\n is the Michaelis constant. More preferably, the vitality of the enzyme corresponds to K\ninh\n, k\ncat\n and K\nM\n, and the biochemical vitality of the enzyme of the mutant replicating biological entity is defined by the relationship K\ninh-mut\n (k\ncat-mut\n/K\nM-mut\n) (i.e., (K\ninh-mut\n) x (K\ncat-mut\n/K\nM-mut\n) ) and the biochemical vitality of the enzyme of the predecessor is defined by the relationship K\ninh-pred\n (k\ncat-pred\n/K\nM\n-pred). The variables K\ninh-mut\n, K\ninh-pred,\n k\ncat-mut,\n k\ncat-pred,\n K\nM-mut\n, and K\nM-pred\n can be obtained by any suitable means, and are preferably obtained by measurement (e.g., from an assay). When vitality is determined on the basis of these relationships, biochemical fitness in the presence of a given inhibitor/drug preferably is defined by the equation: \n \n \n \n \n \nK\n \n \ninh\n \n-\n \nmut\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nk\n \n \ncat\n \n-\n \nmut\n \n \n \n/\n \n \nK\n \n \nM\n \n-\n \nmut\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nK\n \n \ninh\n \n-\n \npred\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nk\n \n \ncat\n \n-\n \npred\n \n \n \n/\n \n \nK\n \n \nM\n \n-\n \npred\n \n \n \n \n \n \n,\n \n \n \n \n\nor \n \n \nlog\n \n⁢\n \n \n \n \n \nK\n \n \ninh\n \n-\n \nmut\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nk\n \n \ncat\n \n-\n \nmut\n \n \n \n/\n \n \nK\n \n \nM\n \n-\n \nmut\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nK\n \n \ninh\n \n-\n \npred\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nk\n \n \ncat\n \n-\n \npred\n \n \n \n/\n \n \nK\n \n \nM\n \n-\n \npred\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n.\n \n \n \n \n\nK\ninh\n can be determined by any suitable means, but typically is determined on the basis of K\ni\n or K\nd\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides a method of administering a therapeutic compound, which method increases the chances of successful long-term therapy. In a preferred embodiment, the present invention provides a method of administering a therapeutic compound that inhibits a biochemical target of a replicating disease-causing replicating biological entity (disease causing predecessor), including identifying at least one mutant capable of evolving from the disease-causing predecessor. A first biochemical vitality of the biochemical target of the disease-causing predecessor in the presence of a first compound capable of inhibiting the biochemical target of the disease-causing predecessor, and a first biochemical vitality of the biochemical target of the mutant in the presence of the first compound, are determined.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional biochemical vitalities of the biochemical target of the disease-causing replicating biological entity in the presence of additional compounds capable of inhibiting the biochemical target of the disease-causing cell, and additional biochemical vitalities of the biochemical target of the mutant in the presence of the additional compounds, are also determined.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFitnesses in the presence of different inhibitors/drugs can be compared and a therapeutic compound administered on the basis of the comparison. A first biochemical fitness of the biochemical target of the mutant relative to the disease-causing predecessor is determined by comparing the first biochemical vitality of the biochemical target of the mutant with the first biochemical vitality of the biochemical target of the disease-causing predecessor, and a second biochemical fitness of the biochemical target of the mutant relative to the disease-causing replicating biological entity is determined by comparing the second biochemical vitality of the biochemical target of the mutant with the second biochemical vitality of the biochemical target of the disease-causing replicating biological entity. Additional biochemical fitness determinations can be made in the presence of additional compounds. The biochemical fitness values for one or more mutants in the presence of each compound are compared. A therapeutic compound is then administered from among the first and the additional compound(s), which therapeutic compound produces the lowest biochemical fitness values.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with the method of the present invention, the replicating disease-causing replicating biological entity is less likely to develop resistance in the presence of the therapeutic compound. The therapeutic compound can be administered from among any particular set of compounds, which can have the same biochemical target or different biochemical targets with respect to each other. The method of administering a compound in accordance with the present invention is, therefore, not limited to comparing fitness in the presence of compounds that act on the same biochemical target.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the disease-causing replicating biological entity is an infectious microorganism, for example, a virus, a fungus, a protozoa, or a bacterium, more preferably a virus or a protozoa. When the infectious microorganism is a virus, it is preferably a retrovirus, which is more preferably HIV-1 or HIV-2, and most preferably HIV-1. When the infectious microorganism is a protozoa, it is preferably a malarial parasite, which is more preferably a plasmodium species.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the disease-causing replicating biological entity is a cancer cell, which is preferably a rapidly growing tumor cell, for example, a rapidly growing cancer cell found in breast cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer, or the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe method of administering a compound in accordance with the present invention can be applied to any suitable biochemical target, preferably a biochemical target whose biochemical vitality can be determined using measurable properties that can be obtained by assay. In one embodiment, the biochemical target of the predecessor (and the mutant) is an enzyme and the compound inhibits an enzyme of the predecessor. The enzyme can be any enzyme whose biochemical vitality can be measured including, for example, an enzyme described herein in connection with the fitness assay of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the biochemical target of the disease-causing replicating biological entity is an oligomer and the compound inhibits the oligomerization of the oligomer of the predecessor. In yet another embodiment, the biochemical target of the disease-causing replicating biological entity is a protein and the compound inhibits a conformational change in the protein of the predecessor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe biochemical vitality can be determined in any suitable manner. For example, vitality can be determined as described herein, e.g., as described in connection with the assay of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen an infectious microorganism is tested in accordance with the assay of the present invention, the predecessor can be a wild-type species, or the predecessor can itself be a mutant species. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the predecessor is a retrovirus, which is more preferably a wild-type HIV-1 or HIV-2 strain, most preferably HIV-1. When the predecessor is a wild-type HIV strain, the mutant replicating biological entity preferably has at least one mutation in the biochemical target thereof. When the predecessor has at least one mutation in the biochemical target thereof, the mutant preferably has at least two mutations in the biochemical target thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilarly, when the method of administering a therapeutic compound in accordance with the present invention is used in connection with an infectious microorganism, the disease-causing replicating biological entity can be a wild-type species, or the disease-causing entity can itself be a mutant species. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the disease-causing replicating biological entity is a retrovirus, which is more preferably a wild-type HIV-1 or HIV-2 strain, most preferably HIV-1. When the disease-causing replicating biological entity is a wild-type HIV strain, the mutant preferably has at least one mutation in the biochemical target thereof. When the disease-causing replicating biological entity has at least one mutation in-the biochemical target thereof, the mutant preferably has at least two mutations in the biochemical target thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the predecessor or the disease-causing replicating biological entity in the assay of the present invention, or in the method of administering a compound in accordance with the present invention, is a wild-type HIV strain, the biochemical target of the mutant preferably has at least one active site mutation. When the predecessor in the assay of the present invention has at least one mutation, and the mutant replicating biological entity has at least two mutations, the biochemical target of the predecessor or of the mutant preferably has at least one active site mutation. When the disease-causing replicating biological entity in the method of the present invention has at least one mutation in the biochemical target thereof, and the mutant has at least two mutations in the biochemical target thereof, the biochemical target of the disease-causing entity or of the mutant preferably has at least one active site mutation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention further provides a continuous fluorogenic assay for measuring the anti-HIV protease activity of a protease inhibitor, which method comprises adding a solution of HIV protease to a substrate stock solution, in which the substrate has the formula Ala-Arg-Val-Tyr-Phe(NO\n2\n)-Glu-Ala-Nle-NH\n2\n, to provide a substrate reaction solution. The fluorescence of the substrate reaction solution is then measured at specified time intervals. The solution of HIV protease is then added to a solution of the protease inhibitor and the substrate stock solution, to provide an inhibitor-substrate-reaction solution. The fluorescence of the inhibitor-substrate reaction solution is then measured at specified time intervals. The initial velocity of the inhibitor-substrate reaction solution is then calculated by applying the equation: V=V\n0\n/2E\nt\n ( { [K\ni\n (1+S/K\nm\n +I\nt\n-E\nt\n] \n2\n+4K\ni\n (1+S/K\nm\n E\nt\n} \n1/2\n- [K\ni\n ( (1+S/K\nm\n +I\nt\n-E\nt\n]), wherein V is the initial velocity of the inhibitor reaction solution, V\n0\n is the initial velocity of the substrate reaction solution, K\nm\n is the Michaelis-Menten constant, S is the substrate concentration, E\nt\n is the protease concentration, and It is the inhibitor concentration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe assay method described herein is highly sensitive and particularly useful for the prediction of the antiviral inhibitory activity of a compound against mutant HIV, more particularly multiple mutant HIV, specifically multidrug-resistant human immunodeficiency viruses. The continuous flourogenic assay of the present invention is distinctly advantageous in that it is more sensitive than standard assays in determining the activity of protease inhibitors against multidrug-resistant HIV. The continuous flourogenic assay of the present invention is disclosed in more detail in the examples that follow.

For example, a resistance-inhibiting effective amount is an amount sufficient to produce an in vivo drug concentration or level where the value for biochemical fitness is less than one, when determined by the ratio of the biochemical vitality of the mutant to the biochemical vitality of the predecessor. The compound can be administered to a wild-type HIV-infected mammal to prevent the emergence of first line resistance, or it can be administered to a mammal infected with a mutant-HIV to prevent the emergence of drug resistance due to further mutations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound is preferably administered in the form of a pharmaceutical composition. The pharmaceutical composition preferably includes a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a resistance-inhibiting effective amount of at least one of the aforesaid compound, alone or in combination with another antiretroviral compound such as, for example, a wild-type HIV protease inhibitor, a mutant HIV retroviral protease inhibitor, or a reverse transcriptase inhibitor. Generally, the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention comprises a resistance-inhibiting effective amount of at least one compound of Formula (I), as disclosed herein, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition is administered that comprises a resistance-inhibiting effective amount of at least one compound of Formula (IA) or Formula (IB), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, prodrug, or ester thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In a further preferred embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition comprises a resistance-inhibiting effective amount of at least one compound of Formula (IC) or Formula (ID), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, prodrug, or ester thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In a highly preferred embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition comprises a resistance-inhibiting effective amount of at least one compound of Formula (IE), and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, prodrugs, and esters thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutically acceptable carriers are well-known to those of skill in the art. The choice of a carrier will be determined in part by the particular composition, as well as by the particular mode of administration. Accordingly, there are a wide variety of suitable formulations for administration in accordance the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical composition may be administered in a form suitable for oral use such as, for example, tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions or solutions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, syrups or elixirs. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known in the art form the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions, and such compositions can contain one or more agents such as, for example, sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents, and preserving agents in order to provide a pharmaceutically elegant and/or palatable preparation. Tablets can contain the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are suitable for manufacture of tablets. Such excipients can be, for example, inert diluents, such as, for example, calcium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents such as, for example, maize starch or alginic acid; binding agents such as, for example, starch, gelatine or acacia, and lubricating agents such as, for example, stearic acid or talc. The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate alone or with a wax may be employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations for oral use also can be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example arachis oil, peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAqueous suspensions typically contain the active materials in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are suspending agents, for example, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gam acacia; dispersing or wetting agents may be a natural-occurring phosphatide, for example, lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan mono-oleate. The aqueous suspensions also can contain one or more preservatives, for example, ethyl or n-propyl p-hydroxy benzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents and one or more sweetening agents such as, for example, sucrose or saccharin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in a mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oil suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents, such as those set forth above, and flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions can be preserved by the addition of an antioxidant such as, for example, ascorbic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents, also may be present.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical composition also can be administered in the form of oil-in-water emulsions. The oily phase can be a vegetable oil, for example, olive oil or arachis oils, or a mineral oil, for example liquid paraffin or mixtures of these. Suitable emulsifying agents may be naturally-occurring gums, for example gum acacia or gum tragacantn, naturally-occurring phosphatides, for example soya bean lecithin, and esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example sorbitan mono-oleate, and condensation products of the said partial esters and ethylene oxide, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan mono-oleate. The emulsions also can contain sweetening and flavoring agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical composition also can be administered in the form of syrups and elixirs, which are typically formulated with sweetening agents such as, for example, glycerol, sorbitol or sucrose. Such formulations also can contain a demulcent, a preservative and flavoring and coloring agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, the pharmaceutical composition can be administered in the form of a sterile injectable preparation, for example, as a sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension. Suitable suspensions for parenteral administration can be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include, for example, aqueous and nonaqueous, isotonic sterile injection solutions, which can contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostates, and solutes that render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient, and aqueous and nonaqueous sterile suspensions that can include suspending agents, solubilizers, thickening agents, stabilizers, and preservatives. The sterile injectable preparation can be a solution or a suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in water or 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that can be employed, for example, are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as, for example, oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, the compound can be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials include, for example, cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols. Formulations suitable for vaginal administration can be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, and foams.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations suitable for topical administration may be presented as creams, gels, pastes, or foams, containing, in addition to the active ingredient, such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe composition can be made into an aerosol formulation to be administered via inhalation. Such aerosol formulations can be placed into pressurized acceptable propellants, such as dichlorodifluoromethane, propane, nitrogen, and the like. They also can be formulated as pharmaceuticals for non-pressured preparations such as in a nebulizer or an atomizer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe formulations can be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose sealed containers, such as ampules and vials, and can be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid excipient, for example, water, for injections, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions can be prepared from sterile powders, granules, and tablets of the kind previously described.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny suitable dosage level can be employed in the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention. The dose administered to an animal, particularly a human, in the context of the present invention should be sufficient to effect a prophylactic or therapeutic response in the animal over a reasonable time frame. The amount of active ingredient that can be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. The size of the dose also will be determined by the existence, nature, and extent of any adverse side-effects that might accompany the administration of a particular composition. Suitable doses and dosage regimens for the prevention of drug resistance can be determined by comparisons to antiretroviral chemotherapeutic agents that are known to inhibit the proliferation of a retrovirus in an infected individual. The preferred dosage is the amount that results in the inhibition of the emergence of mutant drug-resistant retroviruses, particularly the emergence of multidrug-resistant retroviral HIV, without significant side effects. In proper doses and with suitable administration of certain compounds, a wide range of antiretroviral chemotherapeutic compositions are possible. A suitable dose includes a dose or dosage which would be insufficient to completely suppress the growth of a wild-type or predecessor virus, but would be sufficient to inhibit or effectively suppress the growth of a mutant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with the present invention, the compound or composition can be administered in combination with other antiretroviral compounds such as, for example, ritonavir, amprenavir, saquinavir, indinavir, AZT, ddI, ddC, D4T, lamivudine, 3TC, and the like, as well as admixtures and combinations thereof, in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The individual daily dosages for these combinations can range from about one-fifth of the minimally recommended clinical dosages to the maximum recommended levels for the entities when they are given singly.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides a method of preventing the emergence of multidrug-resistant retroviruses in an HIV-infected mammal, which method comprises administering to the mammal a multidrug resistance-inhibiting effective amount of a compound of the present invention, so as to inhibit the emergence of a multidrug-resistant retrovirus in the mammal. The dose administered to an animal, particularly a human in the context of the present invention, should be sufficient to effect a therapeutic response in the animal over a reasonable time frame. The dose will be determined by the strength of the particular composition employed and the condition of the animal, as well as the body weight of the animal to be treated. The size of the dose will also be determined by the existence, nature, and extent of any adverse side-effects that might accompany the administration of a particular compound. Other factors which effect the specific dosage include, for example, bioavailability, metabolic profile, and the pharmacodynamics associated with the particular compound to be administered in a particular patient. One skilled in the art will recognize that the specific dosage level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including, for example, the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, CD4 count, the potency of the active compound with respect to the particular mutant retroviral strain to be inhibited, and the severity of the symptoms presented prior to or during the course of therapy. What constitutes a resistance-inhibiting effective amount can be determined, in part, by use of one or more of the assays described herein, particularly the fitness assay of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne skilled in the art will appreciate that suitable methods of administering compounds and pharmaceutical compositions are available, and, although more than one route can be used to administer a particular composition, a particular route can provide a more immediate and/or more effective reaction than another route.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNumerous compounds have been identified that exhibit potent antiretroviral activity, in particular retroviral protease activity, against wild-type HIV. However, among the fifteen currently FDA-approved antiretroviral agents which are all known potent inhibitors of wild-type HIV, five of which are potent inhibitors of wild-type HIV protease, none of these compounds have the ability to prevent the emergence of drug-resistance mutations that are associated with high level cross resistance. Thus, these inhibitors do not have the ability to suppress the sufficiently fit mutant retroviruses that can (and almost certainly will) emerge under the selection pressure of these inhibitors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSurprisingly, it has been discovered that compound 32 (shown in \nFigure 3A\n), which is a potent wild-type HIV inhibitor, possesses remarkably potent and unprecedented broad-spectrum inhibitory activity against a panel of recombinant mutant HIV protease targets. These enzymes represent the key or primary resistance mutations, most of which occur in the active site region. Based on this finding, the compound was tested against a panel of drug resistant mutant patient isolates of HIV and was found to possess broad spectrum antiviral activity against a wide range of clinically isolated, multiply drug-resistant, human immunodeficiency viruses. Other compounds described herein showed similar activity. The mutant viruses were obtained from infected humans who had received several antiviral drugs. Although applicants do not wish to abound by any one particular theory, it is believed that the combination of the bicyclic ligand (vii) with isostere (vi) gives the antiretroviral compounds of the present invention the unique ability to bind to the active site of the mutant proteases of multiply drug-resistant human immunodeficiency viruses generally, which trait has heretofore not been reported with respect to any known chemotherapeutic and/or experimental HIV protease inhibitor. A wild-type preliminary screen was utilized to determine the antiretroviral activity of analogs against wild-type HIV. It is predicted that compounds of Formula (I), which have potent antiretroviral or protease-inhibitory activity against wild-type HIV, also will be potent inhibitors of drug-resistance, even multiple drug-resistance, in wild-type HIV, or even a mutant thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe resistance-inhibiting compounds of the present invention can be synthesized by any suitable method known in the art. The preferred synthesis method is generally illustrated in \nFigure 4\n, which is an representation of the synthetic approach to preparing a preferred series of compounds, wherein a compound of Formula (I) is synthesized in several steps starting from azidoepoxide (i), wherein R\n1\n-R\n17\n, m, n, p, Q, W, X, y, and z are defined as above. Referring to \nFigure 4\n, amine (ii) is nucleophilically added to azidoepoxide (i), providing aminoalcohol (iii). The amine functional group of aminoalcohol (iii) is then reacted with intermediate (iv), wherein L represents a leaving group (e.g., halogen, N-oxysuccinimide), which can be displaced by the amine of aminoalcohol (iii), to provide azide (v). Reduction of azide (v), or, when R\n5\n is not hydrogen, reductive amination with aldehyde R\n5\nCH=0, provides intermediate (vi), which is subsequently coupled with activated bicyclic ligand (vii), to provide compounds of Formula I. Of course, it will be appreciated by a person of ordinary skill in the art that there are combinations of substituents, functional groups, R-groups, and the like, which are reactive under particular reaction conditions, and require the utilization of an appropriate protecting group or groups, which are known in the art, to ensure that the desired synthetic transformation will take place without the occurrence of undesired side reactions. For example, possible substituents at R\n5\n (e.g., NH\n2\n) can be competitive nucleophiles requiring the attachment of an appropriate protecting group thereon (e.g., benzyloxycarbonyl, tert-butoxycarbonyl) in order obtain proper selectivity in the ring opening of epoxide (i) with amine (ii).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigures 1-3B\n illustrate the synthesis of a preferred series of compounds for use in the method of preventing the emergence of resistance in accordance with the present invention. \nFigure 1\n, which is a synthetic scheme for the synthesis of a particular sulfonamide, illustrates the synthesis of a preferred isosteric core, particularly, the sulfonamide isosteric core represented by \naminosulfonamide\n 15. With reference to \nFigure 1\n, \naminosulfonamide core\n 15 can be synthesized by initially providing \nazidoepoxide\n 11 and subjecting it to nucleophilic addition with \namine\n 12 to give \naminoalcohol\n 13, which is subsequently converted to \nsulfonamide\n 14 by reaction with 4-methoxybenzenesulfonyl chloride. The azide group of 14 is then reduced to provide \naminosulfonamide\n 15, which can be used as a core for synthesizing numerous multidrug-resistant retroviral protease inhibitors of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2\n, which is a reaction scheme detailing the preparation of bicyclic alcohols, illustrates the synthesis of a preferred series of bicyclic ligands, particularly bis-tetrahydrofurans 25 and 26. With reference to \nFigure 2\n, \ndihydrofuran\n 21 is treated with N-iodosuccinimide in the presence of propargyl alcohol to give \niodoether\n 22, which is cyclized to methylene-substituted bis-\ntetrahydrofuran\n 23. Ozonolysis of the exo-methylene residue of 23, followed by reduction, provides bicyclic \nracemic alcohol\n 24, which is resolved to give, separately, \nbicyclic alcohol\n 25 and its \nenantiomeric acetate ester\n 26, which ester group of 26 is subsequently hydrolyzed to afford \nenantiomer\n 27.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigures 3A and 3B\n, which are reaction schemes describing the preparation of two protease inhibitors, illustrate the preparation of two preferred multidrug-resistant HIV protease inhibitors of the present invention. With reference to \nFigure 3A\n, \ncompound\n 32 was synthesized by coupling \nsuccinimidocarbonate\n 31 with \naminosulfonamide\n 15. \nSuccinimidocarbonate\n 31 was prepared by reacting optically pure \nbicyclic alcohol\n 25 with disuccinimidyl carbonate in the presence of triethylamine. \nInhibitor\n 34, which possesses the enantiomeric bis-tetrahydrofuranyl ligand (relative to inhibitor 32), was prepared in the same fashion, except that the enantiomeric \nbicyclic alcohol\n 27 was used instead of \nalcohol\n 25, as illustrated in \nFigure 3B\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following examples further illustrate the present invention but, of course, should not be construed as in any way limiting its scope.\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\n \n \n \nThis example describes the synthesis of exemplary epoxide 11 (\nFigure 1\n), which is used as an intermediate in the synthesis of a particular series of compounds within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnhydrous CuCN (4.86 g, 54 mmol) was added to a solution of butadiene monooxide (38 g, 540 mmol) in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (1.2 L) and the resulting mixture was stirred at -78°C. Commercial phenyl magnesium bromide solution (Aldrich) in ether (65 mmol) was added dropwise over a period of 10 min. The resulting reaction mixture was then allowed to warm to 0 °C and it was continued to stir until the reaction mixture was homogeneous. After this period, the reaction mixture was cooled to -78 °C and 0.58 mole of phenylmagnesium bromide solution in ether was added dropwise for 30 min. The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to 23 °C for 1 h. The reaction was quenched by slow addition of saturated aqueous NH\n4\nC1 (120 mL) followed by NH\n4\nOH (70 mL), saturated NH\n4\nCl (500 ML) and then H\n2\nO (300 mL). The aqueous layer was thoroughly extracted with ethyl acetate (2 x 300 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous Na\n2\nS0\n4,\n filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure.

The resulting mixture was cooled to -22 °C and tert-butylhydroperoxide solution in isooctane (Aldrich, 430 mmol) was added over a period of 10 min. The mixture was stirred an additional 30 min and then a solution of trans-4-phenyl-2-butene-1-ol (32.6 g, 213 mmol), in anhydrous methylene chloride (120 mL), was added dropwise over a period of 40 min at -22 °C. The reaction mixture was then aged in a freezer at -22 °C for 24 h. After this period, water (100 mL) was added to the reaction mixture at -22 °C and the mixture was allowed to warm to 0 °C. After stirring at 0 °C for 45 min, 20% NaOH in brine (20 mL) was added. The resulting mixture was then allowed to warm to 23 °C and was stirred at that temperature for 1 h. After this period, the layers were separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with methylene chloride (2 x 200 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous Na\n2\nSO\n4\n and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was diluted with toluene (800 mL) and then evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue was chromatographed over silica gel (35% ethyl acetate in hexane as eluent) to provide (2R, 3R)-epoxy-4-phenylbutan-1-ol (21.8 g).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo a solution of titanium ispropoxide (12 mL) in anhydrous benzene (250 mL) was added azidotrimethylsilane (11 mL) and the resulting mixture was refluxed for 6 h. A solution of (2R,3R)-epoxy-4-phenylbutan-l-ol (5.32 g) in anhydrous benzene (25 mL) was added to the above refluxing mixture. The resulting mixture was refluxed for \naddition\n 25 min. After this period, the reaction mixture was cooled to 23 °C and the reaction was quenched with aqueous 5% H\n2\nSO\n4\n (400 mL).

The resulting reaction mixture was stirred at 23 °C for 8 h. The reaction was quenched by addition of saturated sodium bicarbonate (100 mL) and the resulting mixture was stirred 30 min. The layers were separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with chloroform (2 x 200 mL). The combined organic layer was extracted with chloroform (2 x 200 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over Na\n2\nSO\n4\n and evaporated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was dissolved in anhydrous THF (50 mL) and solid NaOMe (2.1 g) was added. The mixture was stirred for 4 h at 23 °C and after this period, the reaction was quenched with saturated NH\n4\nC1 (50 mL). The resulting mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (2 x 200 ML).

The resulting blue solution was purged with nitrogen until colorless, then quenched with 20 mL of dimethyl sulfide and the resulting mixture was allowed to warm to 23 °C. The mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure to afford the crude ketone. The resulting crude ketone was dissolved in ethanol (50 mL) and the solution was cooled to 0 °C and sodium borohydride (2.1 g, 55.6 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred for an additional 2 h at 0 °C and then quenched with 10% aqueous citric acid (10 mL).

Moreover, the biochemical fitness of each mutant relative to wild type is equal to or less than one in the presence of \ncompound\n 32. Based on this fitness profile, it is believed that drug resistant viruses containing the characteristic mutations assayed herein will not emerge from the wild-type in the presence of \ncompound\n 32.\n\n\n \nExample 14\n\n\n \n \n \nThis example illustrates the potent and broad-spectrum multidrug-resistant antiretroviral activity of an exemplary compound of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nCompound\n 32, shown in \nFigure 3A\n, was tested side-by-side with four other known HIV-1 protease inhibitors against various wild-type HIV-1 strains (HIV-1\nERS104pre\n, HIV-1\nLAI\n, and HIV-1\nBAL\n), and mutant multidrug-resistant HIV-1 strains clinically isolated from eight different patients who had received numerous antiviral drugs, either singly or in combination.

For example, compound 32 exhibits nanomolar and sub-nanomolar potency against all the multidrug-resistant strains tested, whereas Ritonavir, a reasonably potent wild-type inhibitor, is virtually inactive toward the resistant viruses. Moreover, \ncompound\n 32 is about 9 to about 150 times more potent against the multidrug-resistant viruses than Saquinavir, one of the most potent known compounds against known multidrug-resistant strains of HIV-1. Patients with viral plasma loads greater than 10,000 RNA copies/mm\n3\n are at risk for developing fatal AIDS complications. There are no effective therapeutic options currently available for these patients infected with these multidrug resistant viruses. \nCompound\n 32 and analogs thereof are predicted to be potent in preventing the selection of these viral strains in vivo.\n\n\n \nExample 15\n\n\n \n \n \nThis example demonstrates the wild-type antiretroviral activity of the compounds of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is predicted that the activity of the present inventive compounds against wild-type HIV protease correlates with of antiretroviral activity against multidrug-resistant HIV.

The plasma blood levels of \ncompound\n 32 were measured over a 24 h period after oral administration. The results are shown in Table 5 below.\n\n \nTable 5\n \n \n \nTime After Administration\n \nPlasma Concentration\n \n \n \nHours\n \nMinutes\n \n(nM)\n \n(ng/mL)\n \n \n \n \n0.28\n \n17\n \n1598\n \n898\n \n \n \n1.00\n \n60\n \n878\n \n493\n \n \n \n2.07\n \n124\n \n626\n \n352\n \n \n \n4.01\n \n240\n \n670\n \n377\n \n \n \n6.01\n \n360\n \n594\n \n334\n \n \n \n8.05\n \n483\n \n1115\n \n627\n \n \n \n12.04\n \n722\n \n246\n \n138\n \n \n \n14.08\n \n845\n \n102\n \n57\n \n \n \n24.00\n \n1440\n \n82\n \n46\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese results demonstrate that \ncompound\n 32 maintains high blood levels (e.g., nearly 0.6 uM after 6 hours) long after oral administration. Although applicants do not wish to abound by any one particular theory, it is believed that the non-peptide structure of the compounds of the present invention make them less prone to biological (e.g., enzymatic) degradation, and thereby contribute to their prolonged blood levels after oral administration. From these data, the compounds of the present invention are predicted to have excellent oral bioavailability in humans, and maintain therapeutically significant blood levels over prolonged periods after oral administration.\n\n\n \nExample 17\n\n\n \n \n \nThis example demonstrates the influence of human protein binding on the antiviral activity of \ncompound\n 32. Several potent and orally bioavailable HIV protease inhibitors failed to have in vivo antiviral efficacy. These failures have been ascribed, but not definitively proven, to be due to excessive binding to human plasma proteins, particularly serum albumin and AAG. The protein binding against human alpha acid glycoprotein (AAG, 10 µM) and against human serum albumin (HAS, 300 µM) were compared for \ncompound\n 32 and amprenavir, a structurally related analog that is an FDA approved drug. The results are shown in Table 6.\n\n \nTable 6\n \n \n \n \n \n \nIC\n50\n (µM)\n \n \n \nCompound\n \n(-)\n \n \nAAG\n \n \nAlb\n \n \n \n \n \n \n32\n \n0.0015 (1X)\n \n0.0022 (1.5X)\n \n0.003 (2X)\n \n \n \namprenavir\n \n0.029 (1X)\n \n0 .18 (6X)\n \n0 .021 (1X)\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese data demonstrate that the presence of AAG and HAS in physiologically excessive amounts does not adversely affect the antiviral activity of \ncompound\n 32. From these data, the affinity of \ncompound\n 32 for human AAG and HSA is predicted to be actually lower than that for amprenavir, a known drug. From these data, the compounds of the present invention are expected to have excellent in vivo efficacy in humans, and maintain therapeutically significant levels over prolonged periods of time.\n\n\n \nExample 18\n\n\n \n \n \nThis example describes the inhibitory activity of compounds 35 (\nFig. 5A\n), 36 (\nFig. 5B\n), 37 (\nFig. 5C\n) and 38 (\nFig. 5D\n).

other well-known inhibitors. These mutant viruses represent a panel of the most broadly cross resistant clinical isolates known to date based on their resistance to therapeutically used HIV protease inhibitors. \nCompound\n 32 was consistently potent against all of the clinically isolated mutant viruses tested, and was significantly more potent against these multidrug resistant viruses than the comparative drugs which are currently used in human HIV-1 therapy. \nCompound\n 32 was ten to one-thousand times more potent against these viruses than even saquinavir, one of the most potent known compounds against multidrug-resistant HIV-1. Based on the high potency, it is believed that these mutants will not only be inhibited, but also that these mutants would not be able to emerge if the compound is administered to a patient infected with a predecessor virus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll of the references cited herein, including patents, patent applications, and publications, are hereby incorporated in their entireties by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile this invention has been described with an emphasis upon preferred embodiments, it will be obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art that variations of the preferred embodiments may be used and that it is intended that the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein.
