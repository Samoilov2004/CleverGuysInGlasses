Description\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Field\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to an amide compound which is useful as an active ingredient of a pharmaceutical composition, for example, a pharmaceutical composition for treating chronic renal failure and/or diabetic nephropathy.\n\n\n \nBackground Art\n\n\n \n \n \nProstaglandin E2 (hereinafter referred to as \"PGE2\") is known as one of the metabolites in an arachidonic acid cascade. The PGE2 exhibits various activities, for example, a pain inducing and increasing action, a pro-inflammatory action, an antiinflammatory action, an uterine contractile action, a digestive peristalsis promoting action, an awaking action, a gastric acid secretion inhibiting action, a hypotensive action, a platelet aggregation inhibition action, a bone resorption-promoting action, an angiogenic action, and the like.\n\nThere exist four subtypes, EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4, for the PGE2 receptors, which have a wide distribution in various tissues. The activation of the EP1 receptor is believed to cause the increase in intracellular Ca\n2+\n, The EP3 receptor is one of the receptors having different routes for second-messenger systems. The activation of the EP2 and EP4 receptors is believed to cause the activation of adenylate cyclase, and thus to increase the intracellular cAMP level. In particular, it is believed that the EP4 receptor is realted to relaxation of smooth muscles, promotion or inhibition of an inflammatory reaction, lymphocyte differentiation, hypertrophy or proliferation of mesangial cells, secretion of gastrointestinal mucus, and the like.\n\nAn inhibitor of a PGE2 receptor, that is, a PGE2 antagonist has a binding activity to the PGE2 receptor. That is, the PGE2 antagonist exhibits a PGE2 antagonistic activity or a PGE2 inhibitory activity. Accordingly, the PGE2 antagonist is expected to be a drug for treating diseases caused by PGE2. Among these, the EP4 receptor antagonist is expected to be an agent for treating EP4-related diseases, for example, renal disease, inflammatory diseases, various pains, and the like, in human and animals. In addition, the antagonist selective to the EP4 receptor is preferred from the viewpoint that it can avoid the side-effects based on the subtypes of other EP1, EP2, and EP3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n As an EP4 receptor antagonist, a compound represented by the following formula is known (Patent Document 1).\n\n \n \n\n(For the symbols in the formula, refer to this publication.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, as an EP4 receptor ligand, a compound represented by the following formula is known (Patent Document 2).\n\n \n \n\n(For the symbols in the formula, refer to this publication.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, as an EP4 receptor antagonist, a compound represented by the following formula is known (Patent Document 3).

At this time, depending on the types of the functional groups, it is in some cases effective from the viewpoint of the preparation techniques to protect the functional group with an appropriate protecting group (a group which is capable of being easily converted into the functional group), during the steps from starting materials to intermediates. Examples of the protecting group include the protective groups as described in \"\nGreene's Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis (4th edition, 2006)\", edited by P. G. M. Wuts and T. W. Greene\n, and the like, which may be appropriately selected and used depending on the reaction conditions. In these methods, a desired compound can be obtained by introducing the protecting group to carry out the reaction, and then, if desired, removing the protecting group.\n\nAdditionally, the prodrug of the compound of the formula (I) or a salt thereof can be prepared by introducing a specific group during the steps from starting materials to intermediates, in the same manner as for the above protecting groups, or by further carrying out the reaction using the obtained compound of the formula (I) or a salt thereof. The reaction can be carried out by applying a method known by a person skilled in the art, such as general esterification, amidation, dehydration, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHereinbelow, typical production processes of the compound of the formula (I) will be described. Each of the production processes can also be carried out with reference to the documents appended to the description herein. In this connection, the production process of the compound of the formula (I) is not limited to the examples as shown below.\n\n\n \n(Production Process 1)\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nThe present production process is a method for obtaining the compound of the formula (I) by reacting a compound 1a with a compound 1b.\n\nThe reaction is carried out using an equivalent amount of the compound 1a and the compound 1b or an excessive amount of either thereof, by stirring under cooling to under heating, preferably at -20°C to 60°C, usually for 0.1 hour to 5 days, in a solvent which is inert to the reaction, in the presence of a condensing agent. Here, the solvent is not particularly limited, but examples thereof include aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene, or the like, halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane (DCM), 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE), chloroform, or the like, ethers such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran (THF), dioxane, dimethoxyethane (DME), and the like, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), ethyl acetate, acetonitrile, water, or a mixture thereof. As the condensing agent, 1-[bis(dimethylamino)methylene]-1H-1,2,3-triazolo[4,5-b]pyridin-1-ium-3-oxide hexafluorophosphate (HATU), 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDCI-HCl), dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), 1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI), diphenylphosphoric azide, phosphorus oxychloride, a condensing agent-carrying polystyrene resin, for example, a PS-carbodiimide (Argonaut Technologies, Inc., USA), or the like may be preferably used in some cases, but is not limited thereto. It may be preferable in some cases for the reaction to use an additive such as, for example, 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) and the like, and it may be advantageous in some cases for the smooth progress of the reaction to carry out the reaction in the presence of, for example, an organic base such as triethylamine, N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA), N-methylmorpholine, and the like, or an inorganic base such as potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, potassium hydroxide, and the like. Also, it is preferable to use an isocyanate-carrying polystyrene resin, for example, PS-Isocyanate (Argonaut Technologies, Inc., USA) and the like, in order to remove an excessive amine after completion of the reaction. In addition, a quaternary ammonium salt-carrying polystyrene resin, for example, MP-Carbonate (Argonaut Technologies, Inc., USA) and the like can be used, in order to remove excessive carboxylic acid and the aforementioned additives, and the like, after completion of the reaction.\n\nFurthermore, a method, in which the compound 1a is lead into a reactive derivative thereof, and then the reactive derivative is reacted with the compound 1b, can also be used. Here, examples of the reactive derivative of the compound 1a include acid halides obtained by the reaction with a halogenating agent such as phosphorus oxychloride, thionyl chloride, and the like, mixed acid anhydrides obtained by the reaction with isobutyl chloroformate or the like, active esters obtained by condensation with HOBt or the like, and others. The reaction of these reactive derivatives and the compound 1b can be carried out under cooling to under heating, preferably at -20°C to 60°C, in a solvent which is inert to the reaction, such as halogenated hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, ethers, and the like.\n\nFurthermore, by subjecting to a hydrolysis condition, the compound in which R\n3\n is a carboxylic ester can be derived to the compound of the formula (I) in which R\n3\n is a carboxylic acid can be obtained. Similarly, by subjecting the compound of the formula (I) in which R\n3\n is a substituent having a protecting group to a suitable deprotection condition, the compound of the formula (I) having a substituent from which the protecting group is removed as R\n3\n can be derived.\n\n\n \n(Production Process 2)\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n(In the formula, Ring F represents a Monocyclic or bicyclic hetero ring or monocyclic aryl, U represents a leaving group, and U' represents -B(OH)\n2\n or -B(OL)OL'. Here, L and L' are the same as or different from each other and represent C\n1-6\n alkyl, or L and L' may be combined to represent C\n2-6\n alkylene.)\n\nThe compound (I-b) of the present invention can be obtained by a coupling reaction of the compound (I-a) and the compound 2a.\n\nExamples of the leaving group represented by U include halogen, methanesulfonyloxy, p-toluenesulfonyloxy, and trifluoromethanesulfonyloxy groups, and the like.\n\nThis reaction is carried out using an equivalent amount of the compound (I-a) and the compound 2a or an excessive amount of either thereof, by stirring the mixture at room temperature to under heating with reflux in a solvent which is inert to the reaction, usually for 0.1 hour to 5 days, in the presence of a base and a palladium catalyst. This reaction is preferably carried out under an inert gas atmosphere. The solvent as used herein is not particularly limited, but examples thereof include aromatic hydrocarbons, ethers, halogenated hydrocarbons, alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, butanol, and the like, DMF, DMSO, water, and a mixed solvent thereof. As the base, an inorganic base such as sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, and the like can be used.

Route A is a method in which the compound 3b is reduced into a compound 3d, which is subjected to azidation and reduction to an amino group, thereby preparing the starting material compound 1b-1. On the other hand, Route B is a method in which the, compound 3b is subjected to oximation, followed by reduction, thereby preparing the starting material compound 1b-1.\n\n\n \nStarting Material Production Process 2\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nThe compound 1a-1 can be prepared by an N-alkylation reaction and ester hydrolysis of a compound 4a and a compound 4b. The compound (I-a) can be prepared by an amidation reaction of the compound 1a-1 and the compound 1b.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound of the formula (I) is isolated and purified as their free compounds, salts thereof, hydrates, solvates, or polymorphic substances. The salt of the compound of the formula (I) can be prepared by subjecting to a conventional salt formation reaction.\n\nIsolation and purification can be carried out by employing general chemical operations such as extraction, fractional crystallization, various types of fractional chromatography, and the like.\n\nVarious isomers can be prepared by selecting a suitable starting compound or separated by making use of the difference in the physicochemical properties among the isomers. For example, the optical isomers can be obtained by means of general optical resolution methods of racemic compounds (for example, by fractional crystallization introducing the compound into diastereomer salts with optically active bases or acids, chromatography using a chiral column or the like, and others), or can also be prepared from a suitable optically active starting compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmacological activity of the compound of the formula (I) or a salt thereof was confirmed by the following test.\n\n\n \nTest Example 1: Evaluation test of rat EP4 receptor affinity\n\n\nCell culturing and transfection\n\n\n \n \n \nUsing a 10 cm collagen-coated dish (Asahi Glass), HEK293 cells were cultured in D-MEM culture medium, the culture medium was removed at a confluence (90 to 100% density state) and washed with a phosphate buffer saline (PBS), and then the cells were detached with N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(carboxymethyl)ethylenediamine (EDTA). The number of the cells were counted and seeded on a 15 cm collagen-coated dish to a confluence of 70%. On the next day, to an Opti-MEM culture medium at 1.2 mL/dish was added Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) at 60 µL/dish, followed by leaving to stand at room temperature for 5 minutes. A plasmid in which rat EP4 (Sequence Number 1) had been inserted into a TA cloning site of pcDNA3.1-V5-His-topo was added thereto at 15 µg/dish. After leaving to stand at room temperature for 30 minutes, the resultant was added to the dish and cultured for 20 to 24 hours. The cell culture was carried out in a CO\n2\n incubator (37°C, 5% CO\n2\n).\n\n\n \nPreparation of membrane fraction\n\n\n \n \n \nThe culture medium was removed by suction, 10 mL of cooled PBS was added thereto per 15 cm dish, and the cells were scraped using a cell scraper (Sumitomo Bakelite). They were washed with cooled PBS (1,200 rpm, 4°C, 5 min), and then suspended in 6 mL) of cooled 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4; Nakalai Tesque Inc., including 5 mM EDTA (Nakalai Tesque Inc.) per dish and the resultant was homogenized using a Polytron and the homogenate was centrifuged (26,000 rpm, 20 min, 4°C). The obtained precipitate was resuspended in cooled 20 mM Tris-HCl and homogenized again using a Polytron, and the homogenate was centrifuged (26,000 rpm, 20 min, 4°C). The obtained precipitate was resuspended in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5; Dojindo Laboratories) at 1 mL per dish, homogenized using a Polytron, and freeze-stored at -80°C as a membrane fraction. At this time, a part thereof was used for the measurement of the protein concentration. Measurement of the protein concentration was carried out in duplicate using a Bio-Rad Protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories) in accordance with the appended standard Protocol.\n\n\n \nBinding Assay\n\n\n \n \n \n[\n3\nH]PGE2 50 µL (final concentration 0.3 nM; Perkin Elmer), 100 µL(20 µg/well) of a membrane fraction prepared from the rat EP4 expression cell and 50 µL of a test compound were mixed in a 96-well microplate (Sumitomo Bakelite), incubated at room temperature for 1 hour, filtered by suction on a UniFilter-96 GF/B (Perkin Elmer) using a FilterMate Harvester (Perkin Elmer), and then washed three times with 300 µL/well of a cooled assay buffer. Dilution of [\n3\nH]PGE2 and the membrane fraction was carried out using an assay buffer (50 mM HEPES, 10 mM MgCl\n2\n), and dilution of the test compound and the unlabeled PGE2 was carried out using DMSO and an assay buffer. Further, in the case of the addition of a human serum albumin (HSA), dilution was carried out using an assay buffer containing 4% HSA (final concentration 1%; Sigma). The UniFilter-96 GF/B was treated preliminarily by washing twice with 200 µL/well of a cooled assay buffer. The UniFilter-96 GF/B after filtration was dried in a dryer overnight, 50 µL/well of MicroScint20 (Perkin Elmer) was added thereto, and then the radioactivity was measured using a TopCount (Perkin Elmer). For measurement of the non-specific binding, an unlabeled PGE2 (final concentration 1 µM; Cayman) was added. All of the measurements were carried out in duplicate, and the specific binding amount was determined by subtracting the non-specific binding amount from the total binding amount. The Ki value was calculated according to the general methods.\n\nThe Ki values of several compounds of the formula (I) are shown in Table 1.

After proliferation to semiconfluency, indomethacin having a final concentration of 5 µM was added thereto, and the cells were further cultured for 18 hours. The cells were collected in a 15-mL Spitz tube, prepared to be 1 x 10\n6\n cells/mL using a Cell Banker (Mitsubishi Kagaku Iatron), and stored at -80°C until used for assay. The cells were cultured in a CO\n2\n incubator (37°C, 5% CO\n2\n).\n\n\n \nHTRF Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nA cAMP HiRange kit (Cisbio international) was used for cAMP measurement. A test compound, PGE2, and the cells were diluted and prepared with an assay buffer. The test compound was prepared to have a 3-fold concentration relative to the final concentration, PGE2 was prepared to be 300 nM, and the Jurkat cells frozen stored were prepared to be 1 × 10\n6\n cells/mL by thawing them at 37°C. To a 384-well U-bottom black microplate (Coming) were added the test compound, the cells, and PGE2 in this order in each in an amount of 5 µL, followed by shaking with a plate shaker and incubating at room temperature for 30 minutes. After incubation, 5 µL of a d2 reagent which had been diluted 0.6-fold with a lysis buffer was added to each well, followed by shaking with a plate shaker. Subsequently, 5 µL of an europium cryptate reagent which had been diluted 0.6-fold with a lysis buffer was added to each well, followed by shaking with a plate shaker and incubating at room temperature for 60 minutes under light shielding. After incubation, the fluorescence of the cryptate at 620 nm and the fluorescence of the d2 at 655 nm were measured using ARVO1420 (PerkinElmer). The cAMPs of 280, 70, 17.5, 4.38, 1.09, 0.27, and 0.068 nM were measured simultaneously for creating a standard curve. All measurements were performed in quadruplicate, and inhibitory rates were calculated by determining the cAMP amount of each test sample to the value obtained by subtracting the cAMP amount of the group without addition of PGE2 from the cAMP amount of the group with addition of PGE2 of 100 nM.

The culture medium was replaced with 2 µM Indomethacin/0.1% BSA/alpha-NEM, and further, after 60 minutes, replaced with 1 mM IBMX/2 µM Indomethacin10.1% BSA/alpha-MEM. After 10 minutes, the test compound was added, and further, after 10 minutes, PGE2 was added at a final concentration of 100 nM. The cells were cultured and reacted in a CO\n2\n incubator (37°C, 5% Co\n2\n). After 30 minutes, the culture medium was removed and 100 µL/well of 0.2% Triton X-PBS was added for lysis of the cells. The cAMP contained in this cell lysis solution was measured with a cAMP HiRange kit (Cisbio international). The cell lysis solution was disperesed at 10 µL each into a 384-well U-bottom black microplate (Corning), and a d2 reagent and an europium cryptate reagent were added in this order to each well, each in an amount of 5 µL. It was incubated at room temperature for 60 minutes under light shielding. After incubation, the fluorescence of the cryptate at 620 nm and the fluorescence of the d2 at 655 nm were measured using ARV01420 (PerkinElmer). The cAMPs of 280, 70, 17.5, 4.38, 1.09, 0.27, and 0.068 nM were measured simultaneously for creating a standard curve.

After 30 minutes, Lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 0.01 mg/kg) was administered to the tail vein without anesthesia, and after 60 minutes, 0.5 mL of heparin blood was collected from the fundus under ether anesthesia. The blood sample was centrifuged (3000 rpm, 10 minutes) to separate the plasma, and then the TNF-α concentration in the rat plasma was measured by an ELISA kit (see \nHepatology Research Journal, vol. 21, 252-260, 2001\n). A value obtained by subtracting the TNF-α concentration of the group treated with ONO-4819 from the TNF-α concentration of the group not treated with ONO-4819 was taken as 100%, and the inhibitory rates to the value were calculated for the test compounds.\n\nThe inhibitory rates of several compounds of the formula (I) are shown in Table 2.

From the next day of the administration of STZ, the test compound was continuously orally administered, and urine was periodically collected in a metabolism cage for 24 hours to measure the UAE. In this way, the effect of the test compound on improvement of early nephropathy in diabetic model rats can be confirmed.\n\n\n \nTest Example 6: Test to investigate the effect on the renal function of 5/6 nephrectomy chronic renal failure (5/6 Nx) rats\n\n\n \n \n \n8-Week-old Wistar male rats were used for the test. Two-thirds of the left kidney was incised under pentobarbital anesthesia, and after 1 week, the entire right kidney was extracted. After 2 weeks from extraction of 5/6 of the kidney, the protein excretion amounts in urine were measured by 24-hour urine collection in metabolic cages, and were divided into groups so that there was no difference in each group. Thereafter, over 6 to 8 weeks, 5 mL/kg of the test compound which had been suspended in 0.5% MC was administered orally. The same amounts of the solvent (0.5% MC) were administered orally to the sham group which had undergone only laparotomy and the 5/6 Nx-control group. 24-Hour urine collection was carried out every two weeks.\n\nBy measuring the protein excretion amounts in urine, plasma creatinine, plasma urea nitrogen, and creatinine clearance, the effect of the test compound on the improvement of chronic renal failure can be confirmed, and in this test, it was confirmed that compounds exhibiting effectiveness exist.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, the selectivity of the compound of the formula (I) or a salt thereof on four subtypes of the PGE2 receptor (EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4) was evaluated. Specifically, for the receptor of each subtype derived from the rats, inhibition of the cAMP amounts was evaluated by adding the test compounds, respectively, in the same manner as in Test Example 3. As a result, it was shown that the compound of the formula (I) or a salt thereof has a selective antagonistic activity or an EP4 receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFrom the results of the above-described tests, it was confirmed that the compound of the formula (I) or a salt thereof has an EP4 receptor antagonistic activity, and can be used as an active ingredient of a pharmaceutical composition for preventing or treating various EP4-related diseases, and the like.
