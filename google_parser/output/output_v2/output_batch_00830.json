Description\n\n\n\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\n \n \n \nThis Application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/553,342, filed Mar. 15, 2004, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n \nSTATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT\n\n\n \n \n \nThe research and development of the invention described below was not federally sponsored.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention is directed to novel opioid receptor modulators of Formula (I). The invention further relates to methods for preparing such compounds, pharmaceutical compositions containing them, and their use in the treatment of opioid modulated disorders.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe opioid receptors were identified in the mid-1970's, and were quickly categorized into three sub-sets of receptors (mu, delta and kappa). More recently the original three types of receptors have been further divided into sub-types. Also known is that the family of opioid receptors are members of the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) super-family. More physiologically pertinent are the well established facts that opioid receptors are found throughout the central and peripheral nervous system of many mammalian species, including humans, and that modulation of the respective receptors can elicit numerous, albeit different, biological effects, both desirable and undesirable (D. S. Fries, “Analgesics”, in \nPrinciples of Medicinal Chemistry, \n4th ed.; W. O. Foye, T. L. Lemke, and D. A. Williams, Eds.; Williams and Wilkins: Baltimore, Md., 1995; pp. 247-269; J. V. Aldrich, “Analgesics”, \nBurger's Medicinal Chemistry and Drug Discovery, \n5\nth \nEdition, Volume 3: Therapeutic Agents, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1996, pp. 321-441). In the most current literature, the likelihood of heterodimerization of the sub-classes of opioid receptors has been reported, with respective physiological responses yet undetermined (Pierre J. M. Riviere and Jean-Louis Junien, “Opioid receptors: Targets for new gastrointestinal drug development”, Drug Development 2000, pp. 203-238).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA couple biological effects identified for opioid modulators have led to many useful medicinal agents. Most significant are the many centrally acting mu opioid agonist modulators marketed as analgesic agents to attenuate pain (e.g., morphine), as well as peripherally acting mu agonists to regulate motility (e.g., loperamide). Currently, clinical studies are continuing to evaluate medicinal utility of selective delta, mu, and kappa modulators, as well as compounds possessing combined sub-type modulation. It is envisioned such explorations may lead to agents with new utilities, or agents with minimized adverse side effects relative to currently available agents (examples of side effects for morphine includes constipation, respiratory depression, and addiction potential). Some new GI areas where selective or mixed opioid modulators are currently being evaluated includes potential treatment for various diarrheic syndromes, motility disorders (post-operative ileus, constipation), and visceral pain (post operative pain, irritable bowel syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disorders) (Pierre J. M. Riviere and Jean-Louis Junien, “Opioid receptors: Targets for new gastrointestinal drug development” Drug Development, 2000, pp. 203-238).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAround the same time the opioid receptors were identified, the enkephalins were identified as a set of endogenous opioid ligands (D. S. Fries, “Analgesics”, in \nPrinciples of Medicinal Chemistry, \n4th ed.; W. O. Foye; T. L. Lemke, and D. A. Williams, Eds.; Williams and Wilkins: Baltimore, Md., 1995; pp. 247-269). Schiller discovered that truncating the original pentapeptide enkephalins to simplified dipeptides yielded a series of compounds that maintained opioid activity (Schiller, P. WO 96/06855). However one potential drawback cited for such compounds is the likelihood of their inherent instability (P. W. Schiller et al., Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1993, 41 (3), pp. 313-316).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore recently, a series of opioid pseudopeptides containing heteroaromatic or heteroaliphatic nuclei were disclosed, however this series is reported showing a different functional profile than that described in the Schiller works. (L. H. Lazarus et al., \nPeptides \n2000, 21, pp. 1663-1671)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMost recently, works around morphine related structures were reported by Wentland, et al, where carboxamido morphine derivatives and it's analogs were prepared (M. P. Wentland et al., \nBiorg. Med. Chem. Letters \n2001, 11, pp. 1717-1721; M. P. Wentland et al., \nBiorg. Med. Chem. Letters \n2001, 11, pp. 623-626). Wentland found that substitution for the phenol moiety of the morphine related structures with a primary carboxamide led anywhere from equal activities up to 40 fold reduced activities, depending on the opioid receptor and the carboxamide. It was also revealed that any additional N-substitutions on the carboxamide significantly diminished the desired binding activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the present invention have not been previously disclosed and are believed to provide advantages over related compounds by providing improved pharmacological profiles.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOpioid receptor modulators, agonists or antagonists are useful in the treatment and prevention of various mammalian disease states, for example pain and gastrointestinal disorders such as diarrheic syndromes, motility disorders including post-operative ileus and constipation, and visceral pain including post-operative pain, irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is an object of the present invention to provide opioid receptor modulators. It is a further object of the invention to provide opioid receptor agonists and opioid receptor antagonists. It is an object of the present invention to provide opioid receptor ligands that are selective for each type of opioid receptor, mu, delta and kappa. It is a further object of the present invention to provide opioid receptor ligands that modulate two or three opioid receptor types, mu, delta and kappa, simultaneously. It is an object of the invention to provide certain instant compounds that are also useful as intermediates in preparing new opioid receptor modulators. It is also an object of the invention to provide a method of treating or ameliorating a condition mediated by an opioid receptor. And, it is an object of the invention to provide a useful pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the present invention useful as an opioid receptor modulator.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention is directed to compounds of Formula (I)\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein:\n\n \n \n \nR\n1 \nis selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, C\n1-6\nalkyl, cycloalkyl, heterocyclyl, aryl(C\n1-6\n)alkyl, and heteroaryl(C\n1-6\n)alkyl;

Sci., \n1997 (January), 66, 1, 1). Other salts may, however, be useful in the preparation of compounds according to this invention or of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Representative organic or inorganic acids include, but are not limited to, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydriodic, perchloric, sulfuric, nitric, phosphoric, acetic, propionic, glycolic, lactic, succinic, maleic, fumaric, malic, tartaric, citric, benzoic, mandelic, methanesulfonic, hydroxyethanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, oxalic, pamoic, 2-naphthalenesulfonic, p-toluenesulfonic, cyclohexanesulfamic, salicylic, saccharinic or trifluoroacetic acid. Representative organic or inorganic bases include, but are not limited to, basic or cationic salts such as benzathine, chloroprocaine, choline, diethanolamine, ethylenediamine, meglumine, procaine, aluminum, calcium, lithium, magnesium, potassium, sodium and zinc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention includes within its scope prodrugs of the compounds of this invention. In general, such prodrugs will be functional derivatives of the compounds which are readily convertible in vivo into the required compound. Thus, in the methods of treatment of the present invention, the term “administering” shall encompass the treatment of the various disorders described with the compound specifically disclosed or with a compound which may not be specifically disclosed, but which converts to the specified compound in vivo after administration to the subject. Conventional procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable prodrug derivatives are described, for example, in “\nDesign of Prodrugs\n”, ed. H. Bundgaard, Elsevier, 1985.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere the compounds according to this invention have at least one chiral center, they may accordingly exist as enantiomers. Where the compounds possess two or more chiral centers, they may additionally exist as diastereomers. Where the processes for the preparation of the compounds according to the invention give rise to mixtures of stereoisomers, these isomers may be separated by conventional techniques such as preparative chromatography. The compounds may be prepared in racemic form or as individual enantiomers or diasteromers by either stereospecific synthesis or by resolution. The compounds may, for example, be resolved into their component enantiomers or diasteromers by standard techniques, such as the formation of stereoisomeric pairs by salt formation with an optically active acid, such as (−)-di-p-toluoyl-D-tartaric acid and/or (+)-di-p-toluoyl-L-tartaric acid followed by fractional crystallization and regeneration of the free base. The compounds may also be resolved by formation of stereoisomeric esters or amides, followed by chromatographic separation and removal of the chiral auxiliary. Alternatively, the compounds may be resolved using a chiral HPLC column. It is to be understood that all stereoisomers, racemic mixtures, diastereomers and enantiomers thereof are encompassed within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDuring any of the processes for preparation of the compounds of the present invention, it may be necessary and/or desirable to protect sensitive or reactive groups on any of the molecules concerned. This may be achieved by means of conventional protecting groups, such as those described in \nProtective Groups in Organic Chemistry\n, ed. J. F. W. McOmie, Plenum Press, 1973; and T. W. Greene & P. G. M. Wuts, \nProtective Groups in Organic Synthesis\n, John Wiley & Sons, 1991. The protecting groups may be removed at a convenient subsequent stage using methods known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, some of the crystalline forms for the compounds may exist as polymorphs and as such are intended to be included in the present invention. In addition, some of the compounds may form solvates with water (i.e., hydrates) or common organic solvents, and such solvates are also intended to be encompassed within the scope of this invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, under standard nomenclature rules used throughout this disclosure, the terminal portion of the designated side chain is described first followed by the adjacent functionality toward the point of attachment. Thus, for example, a “phenylC\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkylamidoC\n1\n-C\n6\nalkyl” substituent refers to a group of the formula:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is intended that the definition of any substituent or variable at a particular location in a molecule be independent of its definitions elsewhere in that molecule. It is understood that substituents and substitution patterns on the compounds of this invention can be selected by one of ordinary skill in the art to provide compounds that are chemically stable and that can be readily synthesized by techniques known in the art as well as those methods set forth herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “independently” selected substituent refers to a group of substituents, wherein the substituents may be different. Therefore, designated numbers of carbon atoms (e.g. C\n1-8\n) shall refer independently to the number of carbon atoms in an alkyl or cycloalkyl moiety or to the alkyl portion of a larger substituent in which alkyl appears as its prefix root.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, unless otherwise noted, “alkyl” whether used alone or as part of a substituent group refers to straight and branched carbon chains having 1 to 8 carbon atoms or any number within this range. The term “alkoxy” refers to an —Oalkyl substituent group, wherein alkyl is as defined supra. Similarly, the terms “alkenyl” and “alkynyl” refer to straight and branched carbon chains having 2 to 8 carbon atoms or any number within this range, wherein an alkenyl chain has at least one double bond in the chain and an alkynyl chain has at least one triple bond in the chain. An alkyl and alkoxy chain may be substituted on a carbon atom. In substituent groups with multiple alkyl groups such as (C\n1-6\nalkyl)\n2\namino- the C\n1-6\nalkyl groups of the dialkylamino may be the same or different.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “cycloalkyl” refers to saturated or partially unsaturated, moncyclic or polycyclic hydrocarbon rings of from 3 to 14 carbon atom members. Examples of such rings include, and are not limited to cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl and adamantyl. Alternatively, the cycloalkyl ring may be fused to a benzene ring (benzo fused cycloalkyl), a 5 or 6 membered heteroaryl ring (containing one of O, S or N and, optionally, one additional nitrogen) to form a heteroaryl fused cycloalkyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “heterocyclyl” refers to a nonaromatic cyclic ring of 5 to 7 members in which 1 to 2 members are nitrogen, or a nonaromatic cyclic ring of 5 to 7 members in which zero, one or two members are nitrogen and up to two members are oxygen or sulfur; wherein, optionally, the ring contains zero to one unsaturated bonds, and, optionally, when the ring is of 6 or 7 members, it contains up to two unsaturated bonds. The term “heterocyclyl” includes a 5 to 7 membered monocyclic heterocyclic ring fused to a benzene ring (benzo fused heterocyclyl), a 5 or 6 membered heteroaryl ring (containing one of O, S or N and, optionally, one additional nitrogen), a 5 to 7 membered cycloalkyl or cycloalkenyl ring, a 5 to 7 membered heterocyclyl ring (of the same definition as above but absent the option of a further fused ring) or fused with the carbon of attachment of a cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl or heterocyclyl ring to form a spiro moiety. For instant compounds of the invention, the carbon atom ring members that form the heterocyclyl ring are fully saturated. Other compounds of the invention may have a partially saturated heterocyclyl ring. The term “heterocyclyl” also includes a 5 to 7 membered monocyclic heterocycle bridged to form bicyclic rings. Such compounds are not considered to be fully aromatic and are not referred to as heteroaryl compounds. Examples of heterocyclyl groups include, and are not limited to, pyrrolinyl (including 2H-pyrrole, 2-pyrrolinyl or 3-pyrrolinyl), pyrrolidinyl, 2-imidazolinyl, imidazolidinyl, 2-pyrazolinyl, pyrazolidinyl, piperidinyl, morpholinyl, thiomorpholinyl and piperazinyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “aryl” refers to an unsaturated, aromatic monocyclic ring of 6 carbon members or to an unsaturated, aromatic polycyclic ring of from 10 to 14 carbon members. Examples of such aryl rings include, and are not limited to, phenyl, naphthalenyl or anthracenyl. Preferred aryl groups for the practice of this invention are phenyl and naphthalenyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “heteroaryl” refers to an aromatic ring of 5 or 6 members wherein the ring consists of carbon atoms and has at least one heteroatom member. Suitable heteroatoms include nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur. In the case of 5 membered rings, the heteroaryl ring contains one member of nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur and, in addition, may contain up to three additional nitrogens. In the case of 6 membered rings, the heteroaryl ring may contain from one to three nitrogen atoms. For the case wherein the 6 membered ring has three nitrogens, at most two nitrogen atoms are adjacent. Optionally, the heteroaryl ring is fused to a benzene ring (benzo fused heteroaryl), a 5 or 6 membered heteroaryl ring (containing one of O, S or N and, optionally, one additional nitrogen), a 5 to 7 membered cycloalkyl ring or a 5 to 7 membered heterocyclo ring (as defined supra but absent the option of a further fused ring). Examples of heteroaryl groups include, and are not limited to, furyl, thienyl, pyrrolyl, oxazolyl, thiazolyl, imidazolyl, pyrazolyl, isoxazolyl, isothiazolyl, oxadiazolyl, triazolyl, thiadiazolyl, pyridinyl, pyridazinyl, pyrimidinyl or pyrazinyl; fused heteroaryl groups include indolyl, isoindolyl, indolinyl, benzofuryl, benzothienyl, indazolyl, benzimidazolyl, benzthiazolyl, benzoxazolyl, benzisoxazolyl, benzothiadiazolyl, benzotriazolyl, quinolizinyl, quinolinyl, isoquinolinyl or quinazolinyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “arylalkyl” means an alkyl group substituted with an aryl group (e.g., benzyl, phenethyl). Similarly, the term “arylalkoxy” indicates an alkoxy group substituted with an aryl group (e.g., benzyloxy).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “halogen” refers to fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine. Substituents that are substituted with multiple halogens are substituted in a manner that provides compounds, which are stable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhenever the term “alkyl” or “aryl” or either of their prefix roots appear in a name of a substituent (e.g., arylalkyl, alkylamino) it shall be interpreted as including those limitations given above for “alkyl” and “aryl.” Designated numbers of carbon atoms (e.g., C\n1\n-C\n6\n) shall refer independently to the number of carbon atoms in an alkyl moiety or to the alkyl portion of a larger substituent in which alkyl appears as its prefix root. For alkyl, and alkoxy substituents the designated number of carbon atoms includes all of the independent member included in the range specified individually and all the combination of ranges within in the range specified. For example C\n1-6 \nalkyl would include methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl and hexyl individually as well as sub-combinations thereof (e.g. C\n1-2\n, C\n1-3\n, C\n1-4\n, C\n1-5\n, C\n2-6\n, C\n3-6\n, C\n4-6\n, C\n5-6\n, C\n2-5\n, etc.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “therapeutically effective amount” as used herein, means that amount of active compound or pharmaceutical agent that elicits the biological or medicinal response in a tissue system, animal or human that is being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician, which includes alleviation of the symptoms of the disease or disorder being treated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe novel compounds of the present invention are useful opioid receptor modulators. In particular, certain compounds are opioid receptor agonists useful in the treatment or amelioration of conditions such as pain and gastrointestinal disorders. Examples of pain intended to be within the scope of the present invention include, but are not limited to, centrally mediated pain, peripherally mediated pain, structural or soft tissue injury related pain, pain related to inflammation, progressive disease related pain, neuropathic pain and acute pain such as caused by acute injury, trauma or surgery and chronic pain such as caused by neuropathic pain conditions, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, post-herpetic neuralgia, trigeminal neuralgia, post-stroke pain syndromes or cluster or migraine headaches. Examples of gastrointestinal disorders intended to be within the scope of this invention include, but are not limited to, diarrheic syndromes, motility disorders such as diarrhea-predominant, or alternating irritable bowel syndrome, and visceral pain and diarrhea associated with inflammatory bowel disease including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of gastrointestinal disorders where opioid receptor (“OR”) antagonists are useful include constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome, post-operative ileus and constipation, including but not limited to the constipation associated with treatment of chronic pain with opiates. Modulation of more than one opioid receptor subtype is also useful as follows: a compound that is a mixed mu OR agonist and delta OR antagonist could have antidiarrheal properties without being profoundly constipating. A compound that is a mixed mu OR agonist and delta OR agonist are useful in cases of severe diarrhea that are refractory to treatment with pure mu OR agonists, or has additional utility in treating visceral pain associated with inflammation and diarrhea.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, a compound of the present invention may be administered by any conventional route of administration including, but not limited to oral, nasal, pulmonary, sublingual, ocular, transdermal, rectal, vaginal and parenteral (i.e. subcutaneous, intramuscular, intradermal, intravenous etc.). It is currently preferred that the compounds of the present invention be administered via modes of administration other than pulmonary or parenteral administration. However, the preferred compounds provided in Table IV may be administered via pulmonary or parenteral modes of administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, one or more compounds of Formula (I) or salt thereof as the active ingredient, is intimately admixed with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques, which carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending of the form of preparation desired for administration (e.g. oral or parenteral). Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are well known in the art. Descriptions of some of these pharmaceutically acceptable carriers may be found in \nThe Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients\n, published by the American Pharmaceutical Association and the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods of formulating pharmaceutical compositions have been described in numerous publications such as \nPharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Tablets, Second Edition, Revised and Expanded\n, Volumes 1-3, edited by Lieberman et al; \nPharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Parenteral Medications\n, Volumes 1-2, edited by Avis et al; and \nPharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Disperse Systems\n, Volumes 1-2, edited by Lieberman et al; published by Marcel Dekker, Inc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn preparing a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention in liquid dosage form for oral, topical and parenteral administration, any of the usual pharmaceutical media or excipients may be employed. Thus, for liquid dosage forms, such as suspensions (i.e. colloids, emulsions and dispersions) and solutions, suitable carriers and additives include, but are not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable wetting agents, dispersants, flocculation agents, thickeners, pH control agents (i.e. buffers), osmotic agents, coloring agents, flavors, fragrances, preservatives (i.e. to control microbial growth, etc.) and a liquid vehicle may be employed. Not all of the components listed above will be required for each liquid dosage form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn solid oral preparations such as, for example, dry powders for reconstitution or inhalation, granules, capsules, caplets, gelcaps, pills and tablets (each including immediate release, timed release and sustained release formulations), suitable carriers and additives include but are not limited to diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, glidants, disintegrating agents and the like. Because of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. If desired, tablets may be sugar coated, gelatin coated, film coated or enteric coated by standard techniques.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions herein will contain, per dosage unit, e.g., tablet, capsule, powder, injection, teaspoonful and the like, an amount of the active ingredient necessary to deliver an effective dose as described above. The pharmaceutical compositions herein will contain, per unit dosage unit, e.g., tablet, capsule, powder, injection, suppository, teaspoonful and the like, of from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 300 mg/kg (preferably from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg; and, more preferably, from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 30 mg/kg) and may be given at a dosage of from about 0.01 mg/kg/day to about 300 mg/kg/day (preferably from about 0.01 mg/kg/day to about 100 mg/kg/day and more preferably from about 0.01 mg/kg/day to about 30 mg/kg/day). Preferably, the method for the treatment of conditions that may be mediated by opioid receptors described in the present invention using any of the compounds as defined herein, the dosage form will contain a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier containing between from about 0.01 mg to about 100 mg; and, more preferably, from about 5 mg to about 50 mg of the compound, and may be constituted into any form suitable for the mode of administration selected. The dosages, however, may be varied depending upon the requirement of the subjects, the severity of the condition being treated and the compound being employed. The use of either daily administration or post-periodic dosing may be employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably these compositions are in unit dosage forms from such as tablets, pills, capsules, dry powders for reconstitution or inhalation, granules, lozenges, sterile solutions or suspensions, metered aerosol or liquid sprays, drops, or suppositories for administration by oral, intranasal, sublingual, intraocular, transdermal, rectal, vaginal, dry powder inhaler or other inhalation or insufflation means.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor preparing solid pharmaceutical compositions such as tablets, the principal active ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical carrier, e.g. conventional tableting ingredients such as diluents, binders, adhesives, disintegrants, lubricants, antiadherents and gildants. Suitable diluents include, but are not limited to, starch (i.e. corn, wheat, or potato starch, which may be hydrolized), lactose (granulated, spray dried or anhydrous), sucrose, sucrose-based diluents (confectioner's sugar; sucrose plus about 7 to 10 weight percent invert sugar; sucrose plus about 3 weight percent modified dextrins; sucrose plus invert sugar, about 4 weight percent invert sugar, about 0.1 to 0.2 weight percent cornstarch and magnesium stearate), dextrose, inositol, mannitol, sorbitol, microcrystalline cellulose (i.e. AVICEL™ microcrystalline cellulose available from FMC Corp.), dicalcium phosphate, calcium sulfate dihydrate, calcium lactate trihydrate and the like. Suitable binders and adhesives include, but are not limited to acacia gum, guar gum, tragacanth gum, sucrose, gelatin, glucose, starch, and cellulosics (i.e. methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, ethylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, and the like), water soluble or dispersible binders (i.e. alginic acid and salts thereof, magnesium aluminum silicate, hydroxyethylcellulose [i.e. TYLOSE™ available from Hoechst Celanese], polyethylene glycol, polysaccharide acids, bentonites, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polymethacrylates and pregelatinized starch) and the like. Suitable disintegrants include, but are not limited to, starches (corn, potato, etc.), sodium starch glycolates, pregelatinized starches, clays (magnesium aluminum silicate), celluloses (such as crosslinked sodium carboxymethylcellulose and microcrystalline cellulose), alginates, pregelatinized starches (i.e. corn starch, etc.), gums (i.e. agar, guar, locust bean, karaya, pectin, and tragacanth gum), cross-linked polyvinylpyrrolidone and the like. Suitable lubricants and antiadherents include, but are not limited to, stearates (magnesium, calcium and sodium), stearic acid, talc waxes, stearowet, boric acid, sodium chloride, DL-leucine, carbowax 4000, carbowax 6000, sodium oleate, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium lauryl sulfate, magnesium lauryl sulfate and the like. Suitable gildants include, but are not limited to, talc, cornstarch, silica (i.e. CAB-O-SIL™ silica available from Cabot, SYLOID™ silica available from W.R. Grace/Davison, and AEROSIL™ silica available from Degussa) and the like. Sweeteners and flavorants may be added to chewable solid dosage forms to improve the palatability of the oral dosage form. Additionally, colorants and coatings may be added or applied to the solid dosage form for ease of identification of the drug or for aesthetic purposes. These carriers are formulated with the pharmaceutical active to provide an accurate, appropriate dose of the pharmaceutical active with a therapeutic release profile.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally these carriers are mixed with the pharmaceutical active to form a solid preformulation composition containing a homogeneous mixture of the pharmaceutical active of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Generally the preformulation will be formed by one of three common methods: (a) wet granulation, (b) dry granulation and (c) dry blending. When referring to these preformulation compositions as homogeneous, it is meant that the active ingredient is dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition may be readily subdivided into equally effective dosage forms such as tablets, pills and capsules. This solid preformulation composition is then subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type described above containing from about 0.1 mg to about 500 mg of the active ingredient of the present invention. The tablets or pills containing the novel compositions may also be formulated in multilayer tablets or pills to provide a sustained or provide dual-release products. For example, a dual release tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former. The two components can be separated by an enteric layer, which serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permits the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of materials can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials including a number of polymeric materials such as shellac, cellulose acetate (i.e. cellulose acetate phthalate, cellulose acetate trimetllitate), polyvinyl acetate phthalate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate, methacrylate and ethylacrylate copolymers, methacrylate and methyl methacrylate copolymers and the like. Sustained release tablets may also be made by film coating or wet granulation using slightly soluble or insoluble substances in solution (which for a wet granulation acts as the binding agents) or low melting solids a molten form (which in a wet granulation may incorporate the active ingredient). These materials include natural and synthetic polymers waxes, hydrogenated oils, fatty acids and alcohols (i.e. beeswax, carnauba wax, cetyl alcohol, cetylstearyl alcohol, and the like), esters of fatty acids metallic soaps, and other acceptable materials that can be used to granulate, coat, entrap or otherwise limit the solubility of an active ingredient to achieve a prolonged or sustained release product.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe liquid forms in which the novel compositions of the present invention may be incorporated for administration orally or by injection include, but are not limited to aqueous solutions, suitably flavored syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions, and flavored emulsions with edible oils such as cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut oil or peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles. Suitable suspending agents for aqueous suspensions, include synthetic and natural gums such as, acacia, agar, alginate (i.e. propylene alginate, sodium alginate and the like), guar, karaya, locust bean, pectin, tragacanth, and xanthan gum, cellulosics such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxymethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, and combinations thereof, synthetic polymers such as polyvinyl pyrrolidone, carbomer (i.e. carboxypolymethylene), and polyethylene glycol; clays such as bentonite, hectorite, attapulgite or sepiolite; and other pharmaceutically acceptable suspending agents such as lecithin, gelatin or the like. Suitable surfactants include but are not limited to sodium docusate, sodium lauryl sulfate, polysorbate, octoxynol-9, nonoxynol-10, \npolysorbate\n 20, \npolysorbate\n 40, \npolysorbate\n 60, \npolysorbate\n 80, polyoxamer 188, polyoxamer 235 and combinations thereof. Suitable deflocculating or dispersing agent include pharmaceutical grade lecithins. Suitable flocculating agent include but are not limited to simple neutral electrolytes (i.e. sodium chloride, potassium, chloride, and the like), highly charged insoluble polymers and polyelectrolyte species, water soluble divalent or trivalent ions (i.e. calcium salts, alums or sulfates, citrates and phosphates (which can be used jointly in formulations as pH buffers and flocculating agents). Suitable preservatives include but are not limited to parabens (i.e. methyl, ethyl, n-propyl and n-butyl), sorbic acid, thimerosal, quaternary ammonium salts, benzyl alcohol, benzoic acid, chlorhexidine gluconate, phenylethanol and the like. There are many liquid vehicles that may be used in liquid pharmaceutical dosage forms, however, the liquid vehicle that is used in a particular dosage form must be compatible with the suspending agent(s). For example, nonpolar liquid vehicles such as fatty esters and oils liquid vehicles are best used with suspending agents such as low HLB (Hydrophile-Lipophile Balance) surfactants, stearalkonium hectorite, water insoluble resins, water insoluble film forming polymers and the like.

indicated results were obtained.\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\nRat Brain Delta Opioid Receptor Binding Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nMale, Wistar rats (150-250 g, VAF, Charles River, Kingston, N.Y.) are killed by cervical dislocation, and their brains removed and placed immediately in ice cold Tris HCl buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4). The forebrains are separated from the remainder of the brain by a coronal transection, beginning dorsally at the colliculi and passing ventrally through the midbrain-pontine junction. After dissection, the forebrains are homogenized in Tris buffer in a Teflon® glass homogenizer. The homogenate is diluted to a concentration of 1 g of forebrain tissue per 80 mL Tris and centrifuged at 39,000×g for 10 min. The pellet is resuspended in the same volume of Tris buffer containing 5 mM MgCl\n2 \nwith several brief pulses from a Polytron homogenizer. This particulate preparation is used for the delta opioid binding assays. Following incubation with the delta selective peptide ligand ˜4 nM [\n3\nH]DPDPE at 25° C. for 2.5 h in a 96-well plate with total volume of 1 mL, the plate contents are filtered through Wallac filtermat B sheets on a Tomtec 96-well harvester. The filters are rinsed three times with 2 mL of 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), and dried in a \nmicrowave oven\n 2 min twice. To each \nsample area\n 2×504 of Betaplate Scint scintillation fluid (LKB) is added and analyzed on a LKB (Wallac) 1205 BetaPlate liquid scintillation counter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe data are used to calculate either the % inhibition compared to control binding (when only a single concentration of test compound is evaluated) or a K\ni \nvalue (when a range of concentrations is tested). % inhibition is calculated as: [(total dpm-test compound dpm)/(total dpm-nonspecific dpm)]*100. Kd and K\ni \nvalues were calculated using GraphPad PRISM data analysis program. The biological activity of the compounds of the present invention is shown in Table VII.\n\n\n \nExample 1a\n\n\nRat Brain Delta Opioid Receptor Binding Assay\n\n\nVersion 1a\n\n\n \n \n \nMale, Wistar rats (150-250 g, VAF, Charles River, Kingston, N.Y.) were killed by cervical dislocation, and their brains removed and placed immediately in ice-cold Tris HCl buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4).

Following incubation with 0.1 nM of the delta selective ligand [\n3\nH]naltrindole at 25° C. for 2.5 h in a 96-well plate with total 1 mL, the plate contents were filtered through Wallac filtermat B sheets on a Tomtec 96-well harvester. The filters were rinsed three times with 2 mL of 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), and dried in a microwave oven. To each sample area, Betaplate Scint scintillation fluid (LKB) was added and the resulting radioactivity quantified on a LKB (Wallac) 1205 BetaPlate liquid scintillation counter.

The biological activity of the compounds of the present invention is shown in Table VII.\n\n\n \nExample 2a\n\n\n \n \n \nRat Brain Mu Opioid Receptor Binding Assay\n\n\n \nVersion 2a\n\n\n \n \n \nMale, Wistar rats (150-250 g, VAF, Charles River, Kingston, N.Y.) were killed by cervical dislocation, and their brains removed and placed immediately in ice-cold Tris HCl buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4). The forebrains were separated from the remainder of the brain by a coronal transection, beginning dorsally at the colliculi and passing ventrally through the midbrain-pontine junction. After dissection, the forebrains were homogenized in Tris buffer in a Teflon®-glass homogenizer. The homogenate was diluted to a concentration of 1 g of forebrain tissue per 80 mL Tris and centrifuged at 39,000×g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in the same volume of Tris buffer containing 5 mM MgCl\n2 \nwith several brief pulses from a Polytron homogenizer. This particulate preparation was used for the mu opioid binding assay. Following incubation with 0.8 nM of the mu selective ligand [\n3\nH]DAMGO at 25° C. for 2.5 h in a 96-well plate with total 1 mL, the plate contents were filtered through Wallac filtermat B sheets on a Tomtec 96-well harvester. The filters were rinsed three times with 2 mL of 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), and dried in a microwave oven. To each sample area, Betaplate Scint scintillation fluid (LKB) was added and the resulting radioactivity quantified on a LKB (Wallac) 1205 BetaPlate liquid scintillation counter. Kd and Ki values were calculated using the GraphPad PRISM data analysis program.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE VII\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nr Ki

#RBHOMM400UA) are homogenized in assay buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5 with 5 mM MgCl\n2\n) using a glass tissue grinder, Teflon pestle and a Steadfast Stirrer (Fisher Scientific). The concentration of membranes is adjusted to 300 μg/mL in assay buffer and 100 μL is dispensed into each well of the assay plate, a 96 well round bottom polypropylene plate. Compounds to be tested are solubilized in DMSO (Pierce), 10 mM, then diluted in assay buffer to 6× the desired final concentration. The ligand, \n3\nH-Damgo (Perkin Elmer #NET-902) is also diluted in assay buffer to 3.6 nM. In a second 96 well round bottom polypropylene plate, known as the premix plate, 60 μL of the 6× compound is combined with 60 μL of 3.6 nM \n3\nH-Damgo. From this premix plate 50 μL is transferred to the assay plate containing the membranes, in duplicate. The assay plate is incubated for 2 h at room temperature. A GF/C 96 well filter plate (Perkin Elmer #6005174) is pretreated with 0.3% polyethylenimine for 30 min. The contents of the assay plate are filtered through the filter plate using a Packard Filtermate Harvester, and washed 3 times with 0.9% saline that is 4° C. The filter plate is dried, the underside sealed, and 30 μL Microscint20 (Packard #6013621) added to each well. A Topcount-NXT Microplate Scintillation Counter (Packard) is used to measure emitted energies in the range of 2.9 to 35 KeV. Results are compared to maximum binding, wells receiving no inhibitors. Nonspecific binding is determined in the presence of 1 μM unlabelled Damgo (Tocris #1171). The biological activity of the compounds of the present invention is shown in Table VIII.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe biological activity of the compounds of the present invention may also be measured in a human delta opioid receptor binding assay using the following example.\n\n\n \nExample 4\n\n\nHuman Delta Opioid Receptor Binding Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nThis assay is designed to test the ability of a compound to interfere with the binding of tritiated Naltrindole to the \nhuman delta subtype\n 2 opioid receptor.

The membrane suspension was homogenized with a Polytron and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 18,000 rpm for 20 min. The pellet was resuspended in 10 ml assay buffer with a Polytron.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe membranes were preincubated with wheat germ agglutinin coated SPA beads (Amersham) at 25° C. for 45 min in the assay buffer. The SPA bead (5 mg/ml) coupled membranes (10 μg/ml) were then incubated with 0.5 nM [\n35\nS]GTPγS in the assay buffer. The basal binding is that taking place in the absence of added test compound; this unmodulated binding is considered as 100%, with agonist stimulated binding rising to levels significantly above this value. A range of concentrations of receptor agonists was used to stimulate [\n35\nS]GTPγS binding. Both basal and non-specific binding was tested in the absence of agonist; non-specific binding determination included 10 μM unlabeled GTPγS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds were tested for function as antagonists by evaluating their potential to inhibit agonist-stimulated GTPγS binding. Radioactivity was quantified on a Packard TopCount.

8\n\n\nIn Vivo Assay\n\n\nStress-Induced Fecal Output (Fecal Output for 1 Hr)\n\n\n \n \n \nThis assay evaluates the fecal output in novel environment-stressed mice to that of acclimated controls.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods: Adult, male, Crl:CD-1 (ICR) mice, weighing ˜30-35 g were used in these studies, with a minimum of 10 mice per dose group. One group of mice was assigned as acclimated, or “non-stressed” controls. These control mice were transported from colony housing, where they were housed 3/cage in polycarbonate cages with access to food and water ad lib. to the procedure room. The mice were removed from their home cages and individually housed in 20 cm wide×20 cm deep×15 cm tall cages, equipped with a wire mesh bottom where they remained for a 16-18 hr period of acclimation to their novel environment. Mice were allowed access to food and water ad lib. during acclimation. The other groups of mice were assigned as non-acclimated, or “stressed” treatment groups. Each mouse in each group was weighed and vehicle, or test compound, was intragastrically administered by oral intubation in 0.5% methylcellulose. Mice were allowed access to water only ad lib. during the test period. After compound administrations, acclimated (control) as well as non-acclimated (stressed) mice were individually housed in a 20 cm wide×20 cm deep×15 cm tall cage, with a wire mesh bottom. An absorbant cardboard is placed beneath the cages. The number of fecal pellets excreted by each mouse was determined at hourly intervals following placement of the mice in the individual cages. Raw Data=# of fecal pellets/mouse/hr. The mean fecal pellet output for each test group was calculated and the results expressed as a percent of the mean fecal pellet output of the control group (the acclimated, non-stressed group, to which vehicle only was administered). ANOVA was performed and Tukey's Multiple Comparison Test used to compare the means, which were considered significantly different when P<0.05. Data is shown in Table X, XI, and XII.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE X\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFecal Output (# pellets)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCpd\n\n\ndose\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n

these studies are male CD-1 mice, ave. wt. ˜30 g. Procedure: Mice were housed in LAM under 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle, food & water ad lib. On the day before the experiments, the mice assigned to the “acclimated” (non-stressed) control group were placed into individual wire mesh-bottomed cages, provided food and water ad lib. The acclimated control group was in this new environment for 16-18 hrs prior to beginning the test. On the day of the experiment, mice assigned to experimental groups were housed in home cages were transported to procedure room and remain in their home cages until the start of the transit portion of the study. Mice were intragastrically dosed with compounds (volume remains constant at 0.1 mL/10 g body wt) by \noral gavage\n 30 minutes before carmine (a red vital dye that does not have the drug-adsorbing properties of charcoal) is administered (0.25 mL, 6% carmine in 0.5% methylcellulose). After the carmine marker was administered each mouse was placed in the novel environment cage. One hour after administration of carmine, the fecal pellet output of each animal was recorded. At one-hour intervals thereafter the fecal pellets were examined for the presence of carmine-dye. The number of mice that excreted a carmine-containing fecal pellet at the end of each hour post carmine administration was recorded, until all mice had excreted carmine in a fecal pellet or the end of 6 hrs post carmine administration, whichever occurred first. A variant of this novel environment stress (NES) paradigm is to use the same procedures of dye and compound administrations, but to use restraint (confinement in a small plastic tube for 3 hr) as a stressor (RS=restraint stress), followed by two hours in an individual cage (total of 5 hr fecal transit time). Data is shown in Table XIII. The original data are quantal, i.e. a mouse in the treatment group either did, or did not exhibit entire GI tract transit (excrete colored feces). The mouse entire GI tract (MEGIT) transit test can thus be done in mice that are all acclimated (non-stressed), in which case the data are expressed as % control (vehicle only), or in mice that are exposed to NES or RS, in which cases the data are expressed as % of the vehicle treated NES or RS group.

Mice were housed under 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle, food & water ad lib. On the day of the experiment mice were assigned to experimental groups, including one vehicle-only group (=control). At 30 min before administration of carmine dye, animals were dosed with vehicle or vehicle-plus-compound, mice were returned to their home cages after drug administration. After administration of carmine, the animals were either returned to their home cages (non-stressed) or individually placed in the same metal cages as used in the fecal output or entire GI tract transit to induce a novel environment stress. One hour after administration of carmine, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, the abdomen opened midventrally, the small intestine from pylorus to cecum was removed, the mesentery divided in order to lay the intestine straight & flat—without stretching. The total length of intestine and the length of carmine-dyed intestine were measured in order to determine the percent of the upper GI tract over which transit had occurred as follows: {(Length of carmine-dyed intestine)/(Total length of intestine)}×100=% upper GI transit. The data expressed were group means±SD (or s.e.m.) and data expressed as % of control. Statistics: ANOVA with the Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test and means were considered significantly different when P<0.05.

Distention of an intracolonic balloon, using a barostat apparatus, evoked increases in the EMG recordings that are related to the pressure. Control responses are compared with \nrepeat stimulation\n 4 hours after zymosan is administered to the colon (\nFIG. 1\n). Animals with 10% higher visceromotor responses for at least two distending pressures are considered to exhibit visceral hyperalgesia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nCompound\n 18 in 5 rats at repeated distentions of 40 mmHg administered at 30 mg/kg, i.p., blocked the hyperalgesic response to colorectal balloon distention following zymosan (\nFIG. 2\n and \nFIG. 3\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe agonistic or antagonistic activity of the compounds of the invention at the kappa opioid receptor can be determined by known methods, for example, by the procedure described in S. Giuliani, A. Lecci, M. Tramontana, C. A. Maggi, Role of kappa opioid receptors in modulating cholinergic twitches in the circular muscle of guinea-pig colon. \nBrit J Pharmacol \n119, 985-9 (November, 1996)."
