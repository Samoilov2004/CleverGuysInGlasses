Description\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to pyrazole derivatives having affinity for the CB1 and/or CB2 cannabinoidergic receptors, the correspondig solvates and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and the pharmaceutical compositions containing them.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore specifically the present invention relates to condensed tricyclic pyrazole derivatives having affinity for the CB1 and/or CB2 cannabinoidergic receptors, acting both on the peripheral and central nervous system, and which can also be formulated under the form of microemulsions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is well known that the microemulsions are widely requested by users since they provide formulation systems which are stable in time. Besides, when in microemulsions a phase separation occurs, the initial system can be restored by mild stirring when the pharmaceutical compound is formulated in a microemulsion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCannabinoids are compounds derived from \nCannabis sativa,\n commonly known as marijuana. Among the at least 66 cannabinoid compounds characterizing marijuana, tetrahydrocannabinols (THC) and Δ\n9\n-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ\n9\n-THC) in particular, are considered to be those most active. The properties which have brought to the use of marijuana as therapeutic agent of natural origin both in mammals and in human beings have been correlated to said compounds. Said properties are the following: the analgesic effect, the antiinflammatory activity, the reduction of the blood and intraocular pressure, the antiemetic activity. To tetrahydrocannabinols the negative effects which are associated to the marijuana use have furthermore been correlated, with particolar reference to the psychological distortion of perception, to the motory coordination loss, to the euphoria, to the sedative effect. The pharmacological action of cannabinoids appears directly correlated to their affinity towards two different classes of specific receptors belonging to the receptor family \"G protein-coupled\": the CB1 receptors, located in the central nervous system besides that in peripheral tissues, and the CB2 receptors, found in the cerebellum (\nQ.J.Lu et al.; Visual Neurosci.; 2000, 17,9 1-95\n) but which are mostly found in peripheral tissues (\nM.Glass; Progr. Neuro-Psychopharmacol. & Biol. Psychiat.; 2001, 25, 743-765\n). In the brain, the CB1 receptors are abundantly expressed in the hippocampus, in the cortical regions, in the cerebellum and inside the basal ganglia. Among the peripheral tissues wherein the CB1 receptors have been found, the testicles, the small intestine, the vesica, the deferent duct can be mentioned. The CB1 receptors have been furthermore identified both in the rat eye and in the human eye, both in the retina and in the iris and in the ciliary body (\nA. Porcella et al.; Molecular Brain Research; 1998, 58, 240-245\n; \nA. Porcella et al.; European Journal of Neuroscience; 2000, 12, 1123-1127\n). The CB2 receptors are on the contrary prevailingly located in the marginal zones of the spleen, in tonsils, besides in several cells of the immune system, as macrophages, monocytes, the cells of the bone marrow, of thymus and of pancreas. Other cells of the immune system wherein the CB2 receptors are significantly present are T4 and T8 cells, the polymorphonucleated leucoocytes, in particular the cells called \"natural killers\" and lymphocytes B.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds able to interact, as agonists or antagonists, with the CB2 receptors can therefore be used in the treatment of diseases wherein immune system cells or immune disorders are involved. The activation (modulation) of the CB2 receptors is also important in the treatment of other diseases, such as in the treatment of osteoporosis, renal ischaemia, pain, neuropathic pain, post-surgery pain, inflammatory conditions, amyotrophic sclerosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds with affinity for the CB1 receptors can be used in the treatment of eye diseases such as glaucoma, pulmonary diseases, as asthma and chronic bronchitis, inflammations as arthritis, allergies and allergic reactions, such as allergic rhinitis, contact dermatitis, allergic conjunctivitis. Said compounds can also be used in the treatment of pain, in conditions of anxiety, behaviour disorders, delirium conditions, psychotic problems in general, furthermore for the treatment of schizophrenia, depression and in the treatment of drug and/or alcohol abuse, (for example alcoholism and tabagism). The same compounds can also be used to combat vomit, nausea, vertigoes, especially in the case of patients subjected to chemotherapy; in the treatment of neuropathies, hemicrania, stress, psychosomatic origin diseases, epilepsy, Tourette syndrome, Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, Alzheimer disease, senile dementia and in the case of cognition disorders and memory loss. Further applications of the compounds having affinity towards the CB1 receptors are the treatment of pathologies related to appetite disorders (obesity, bulimia), pathologies of the gastrointestinal tract and of the bladder, cardiovascular diseases, urinary and fertility disorders, neuroinflammatory pathologies, such as multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, viral encefalitis. For example some CB1 agonist active principles are successfully used in the treatment of nausea and vomit associated to chemotherapy and in the appetite whetting in AIDS patients. Compounds having antagonist activity towards the CB1 receptors can be used for example in the treatment of psychosis, anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, obesity, neurological diseases (for example: dementia, Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, epilepsy, Tourette syndrome), in conditions of memory loss, of central nervous system diseases involving the neurotransmission of cannabinoids, in fertility and erectile disorders, in the treatment of gastrointestinal and/or cardiovascular disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds which are effective in activating cannabinoid receptors show immunosuppressive activity and are used in the treatment of eye inflammatory conditions and autoimmune diseases, for instance uveitis and uveoretinitis (\nH. Xu et al., J. Leukocyte Biology, 82, 2007, 532-541\n). They are used also for treating retina neurodegeneration (\nG. Pryce et al., Brain 126 2003 2191-2202\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWith reference to the wide pharmacological applications of cannabinoids, in the latest years several studies have been carried out for finding endocannabinoids and for the synthesis of new compounds capable of selectively interacting with the two subclasses of CB1 and CB2 cannabinoidergic receptors. Researches have led on the one hand to the identification of anandamide endocannabinoids (arachidonyl ethanolamide) and 2-arachidonyl glycerol, on the other hand to the preparation of different classes of synthesis compounds, agonist or antagonist towards the CB1 or CB2 receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe class of the compounds having agonist activity towards the CB1 receptors (cannabimimetic activity) comprises both synthesis compounds with a basic structure directly derived from that of Δ\n9\n-THC, as (-)-11-OH-Δ\n8\nTHC-dimethylheptyl (HU210) and nabilone, and compounds structurally different from Δ\n9\n-THC, as aminoalkylindols of the WIN 55,212-2 series (\nM. Pacheco et al.; J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther.; 1991, 257, 1701-183\n) or as bicyclic cannabinols (non classic cannabinoids) which refer to the compound CP 55,940 (\nM. Glass; Progr. Neuro-Psychopharmacol. & Biol. Psychiat.; 2001, 25, 743-765\n). The compounds having cannabimimetic activity show in vivo the following effects: hypoactivity, hypothermia, analgesia and catalepsy (\nB.R. Martin et al.; Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav.; 1991, 40, 471-478\n;\n P.B. Smith et al.; J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther.; 1994, 270, 219-227\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nClinical data have shown thah the CB1 antagonist pyrazole compound Rimonabant is effective in reducing both weight and metabolic and/or cardiovascular risk factors in patients with metabolic syndrome and/or dyslipidemia (\nJ. P. Després et al., the New England Journal of Medicine, 2005, 353, 2121-2134\n, \nD. Tonstad, Nutrition, Metabolism and Cadiovascular Diseases 2006, 16, 156-162\n. The effectiveness of Rimonabant in reducing metabolic and/or cardiovascular risk factors has been shown also in patients with type 2 diabetes (\nA. J.Scheen et A1., Lancet 2006, 368 1660-1672\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCondensed tricyclic compounds having a high affinity for the cannabinoidergic receptors and, above all, a high selectivity for the CB1 receptors, are described in \n \nEP 1,230,244\n \n.

To evaluate the affinity of a specific compound to a particular receptor it is necessary to challenge in a particular tissue preparation wherein those specific receptors are present the compound to be tested with a radioactive labelled compound whose affinity for the same receptors is known. The ability of the compound under test to displace the radioactive compound from the receptor site gives an index of the affinity of the compound under test for that specific receptor. The amount of radioactivity present in the receptor-compound complex allows furthermore to estimate with great accuracy the amount of compound bound to the receptor. By said method it is therefore possible to stablish quickly the affinity of a new compound towards a specific receptor and thus to determine its pharmacological activity. With the same experimental protocol it is possible to evaluate the affinity of the compound towards other receptors and thus establish its specificity degree toward said other receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe receptor binding technique, besides being used for the screening of new molecules with pharmacological activity, can give useful information on possible changes at receptor level, related for example to a prolonged exposure to drugs and/or to particular pathologies. In these conditions, indeed, changes in the amount of the receptors, or conformational changes can take place that alter the binding affinity of the agonists or antagonists, therefore affecting the functionality of the receptors themselves.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe experimentation has been carried out according to the guide lines of the European Community for the animal experimentation (EEC n. 86/609), by using laboratory animals (mice) lodged twenty per cage, under standard stabulation conditions (temperature 22±2°C, relative humidity 60%, artificial lighting with light/dark cycle of 12 hours). The food and water were ad libitum.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe procedure adopted, based on the use of the compound [\n3\nH]-CP-55,940 (New England Nuclear, Boston, MA, USA), requires the use of the mouse brain as biological tissue for the evaluation of the affinity towards the CB1 receptors and of the mouse spleen for the affinity assay for the CB2 receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and the complete brain (excluding the cerebellum) and the spleen were quickly dissected and kept in ice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe tissue was homogeneized in 15 volumes (weight/volume) of TME buffer (50 Mm Tris, 1 mM EDTA and 3 mM MgCl\n2\n, pH 7.4) by an Ultra-Turrax and subsequently centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1086 x g in a centrifuge refrigerated at 4°C. The recovered supernatant was centrifuged at 45,000 x g for 30 minutes at 4°C by using a Beckman SW41 rotor and the obtained pellet was resuspended in 50 volumes of TME.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe thus obtained membranes (50-80 µg of proteins) were incubated in the presence of 1 nM of [\n3\nH]-CP55.940 for 1 hour at 30°C in a final volume of 0.5 ml of TME buffer containing 5 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin (BSA). The non specific binding was measured in the presence of CP55.940 at a 1 µM concentration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll the experiments were carried out in polypropylene test tubes pretreated with Sigma-Cote (Sigma Chemical Co. Ltd., Poole, UK) for reducing non specific binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to determine the competitive inhibition binding curves, eight different concentrations of each compound were used. As reference compounds, SR141716A was used for the CB1 receptors and the compound SR144528 was used for the CB2 receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIncubation was stopped by addition of TME buffer (at 4°C) containing 5 mg/ml of BSA, and subsequent filtration under vacuum by Whatman GFC filters pretreated with 0.5% of polyethylamine (PEI) and by using a filtering device (Brandell, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). The filters were washed 3 times with 5 ml of Tris HCl buffer (pH 7.4, 4°C) containing 1 mg/ml of BSA and separately placed in plastic vials containing 4 ml of scintillating liquid (Ultima Gold MV, Packard).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe radioactivity present in the filters was determined by a scintillator spectrophotometer (Tricarb\n®\n 2100, Packard, Meridien, USA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProtein determination was carried out by the Bradford method by using the protocol and the reactants supplied by Bio-Rad (Milano, Italy).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe experiments were carried out in triplicate and the results confirmed in five independent experiments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe affinity of the compounds towards the CB1 and CB2 receptors has been expressed in Ki terms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Ki values, obtained with the compounds of the present invention in the test in vitro, are reported in Table 1. By comparison, in the Table, the affinity values of the reference compounds SR144528 and SR141716A (Rimonobant\n®\n) are reported.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Table shows that the compounds of the present invention have activity on the CB1 and/or CB2 receptors comparable with that of the reference compounds.\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHypothermia tests in vivo\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIt is known that the compounds having a cannabomimetic activity show in vivo the following effects: hypoactivity, hypothermia, analgesia and catalepsy (\nB.R.Martin et al., Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav.; 1991, 40, 471-478\n; \nP.B. Smith et al.; J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. ; 1994, 270, 219-227\n). In order to display thermoregulating activity, the compounds acting towards the cannabinoidergic receptors must be able to pass the haematoencephalic barrier since the central site of said temperature regulating receptors is positioned in the preoptical front core of the hypothalamus (\nS.M. Rawls et al.; J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther.; 2002, 303, 395-402\n). After treatment with CB1 agonist compounds passing the haemato-encephalic barrier, the cannabimimetic activity is evidenced by a reduction of the body temperature. CB1 antagonist compounds that pass the haemato-encephalic barrier, have no influence on the body temperature and show an antagonist activity towards the reference CB1 agonists as WIN 55.212-2, thus hindering the hypothermia induced by the latter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to evaluate the property of the compounds of general formula (I) to cross the haematoencephalic barrier, tests have been carried out in order to check whether said compounds induced hypothermia. The tests have been carried out in the experimental animal (mice) according to the indications of \nM.Rinaldi-Carmona et al. in FEBS Letters; 1994, 350, 240-244\n. Rectal temperature in mice was determined by an electronic thermometer inserted at a 2 mm depth. The measurements were carried out on mice acclimatized for one hour. The rectal temperature was determined before and after (from 30 to 120 minutes) i.p. the administration of the compound to be under test.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe experiment was carried out with the compound of example 3.1. Said compound was dispersed in a carrier formed of a physiological solution added with Tween 80 (3 drops). The so prepared samples were used for treating the animals at a dose of the compound of 40 mg/kg of body weight. The blank was the carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach test was repeated on ten animals: the results obtained are therefore the average of the determinations made on ten animals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results are reported in Table 2 and show that the compounds of the invention having affinity for the CB1 receptors (see example 4) are capable to pass the haematoencephalic barrier, as they induce hypothermia in the experimental animals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn fact the compound of example 3.1 at the administered dose of 40 mg/Kg was able to significantly reduce the body temperature in the confront of the carrier. The compound of example 3.1 is therefore effective on the CB1 agonist central nervous system.\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvaluation of the activity of the compounds of the invention in the reduction of the ocular pressure\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe main risk factor in the glaucoma is represented by the high intraocular pressure (IOP). See for instance: \nLibby R.T. et al., Vis Neurosci. 2005 Sep-Oct, 22(5):637-48\n and \nTomida I. et al., Br. J. Ophthalmol. 2004 May, 88(5):708-13\n. Among the various experimental animal models wherein a high intraocular pressure correlated to glaucoma is obtained, the animal model based on the use of old DBA/2J mice (6-10 months age) with high IOP is considered one the most effective for selecting potential therapeutic agents for clinical use, since the mouse eye physiology is similar to that of the human eye (\nZhong et al., Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2007 March, 48(3\n); \nF.Schuettauff et al., Acta Neuropathol. (2004) 107 : 352-358\n;\n S.W.M.John et al., Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998 May, 39(6):951-962\n e \nF.Schuettauf et al., Vision Res. 2002 September, 42 (20) :2333-2337\n) .\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmacological and histological studies have shown the direct involvement of the cannabinoid receptors in the IOP reduction. Porcella et al. have found high levels of mRNA CB1 in the ciliary body (\nPorcella et al., Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res., 1998 July 15, 58(1-2):240-245\n) while Lu and colleagues have pointed out the presence of mRNA CB2 in the retina (\nQ.Lu et al., Vis. Neurosci. 2000 January-February, 17(1):91-95\n). The activation of the CB1 and/or CB2 receptors appears therefore a pharmacological target of interest for the modulation of the intraocular pressure, for the therapeutical benefits in the glaucoma treatment. Very positive results have been for example reported by \nPorcella et al. in European Journal of Neuroscience, 2001, Vol. 13, 409-412\n, wherein it is mentioned the significant IOP reduction in men after local administration in the eye of the cannabinoidergic compound WIN 55212-2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy using the animal model of old DBA/2J mice (see above) it has been evaluated the efficacy of the compound obtained in example 3.1 in reducing the IOP. As said, this compound has a good affinity towards the CB1 receptors in vitro (example 4) and a CB1 agonist action in vivo (example 5). The intraocular pressure has been determined by a TONOLab Tonometer (Tiolat Oy), as reported by\n M.E.Pease et al. in J. Glaucoma, 2006 December, 15(6):512-519\n. The compound was dispersed in the commercial emulsion Tocrisolve\n™\n, (Tocris), at a concentration of 5 mg/ml and applied to the eye of old DBA/2J mice (8-10 month age; basal IOP comprised between 19.0 and 22.5 mmHg). The applied emulsion volumes were such that the compound doses resulted, respectively, of 100 µg or 50 µg. WIN 55212-2 was dispersed in Tocrisolve\n™\n at the concentration of 5 mg/ml and was the reference cannabinoidergic compound. The determination of the ocular pressure was carried out every 30 minutes up to two hours starting from the administration. The obtained results (average of 6 measurements at each time for experimental groups of 8-10 animals for group/dose) are reported in Table 3. IOP decrease was expressed in per cent with respect to the basal value.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results show that the commercial emulsion Tocrisolve\n™\n (20 and 40 µl) has no effect on the IOP. Furthermore, at the dose of 100 µg the compound of example 3.1 was as effective to reduce eye pressure as the reference compound WIN 55212-2. Further, at the dose of 50 µg the compound of the present invention was more effective in reducing IOP than the reference compound.\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvaluation of the activity of the compounds of the invention in an ex-vivo model based on the use of the vas deferens\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe use of the isolated deferent vessel organ, as a highly sensitive basic system in an ex-vivo model for evaluating the activity of agonist CB1 compounds, has been described by \nPertwee et al. in Br. J. Pharmacol., 105:980-4, 1992\n. This model has been used also to evaluate the properties of antagonist CB1 compounds and to distinguish antagonist CB1 derivatives from inverse agonist CB1 compounds (\nRinaldi-Carmona et al., FEBS Lett., 350:240-4, 1994\n;\n Pertwee et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol., 456:99-106, 2002\n). The model is based on the activity of the agonist CB1 or partial agonist CB1 compounds of decreasing in a dose-depending way the amplitude of the contractions electrically induced on the mouse deferent vessel. This effect is correlated to the action on the prejunctional neuronal CB1 receptors with the consequent release inhibition, induced by electric stimuli, of contractile neurotransmitters (noradrenalin and ATP) (\nSchlicker and Kathmann, Trends Pharmacol. Sci., 22:565-72, 2001\n). The inhibition of the contractions induced by the electric stimulus on the deferent vessel in the presence of agonist (or partial agonist) CB1 compounds are expressed as % of contraction inhibition. Said % contraction inhibition is calculated by the ratio between the contraction amplitude determined in the presence of a given concentration of the compound and that detected in its absence (basal value). The curve of the \"% of contraction inhibition\" as a function of the logarithm of the concentration of agonist (or partial agonist) CB1 compounds, is sigmoidal. The use of the model for the evaluation of antagonist CB1 compounds is based on the evaluation of their efficacy in inhibiting the action of the deferent vessel of agonist (or partial agonist) CB1 compounds. The inhibition is expressed by a shifting towards the right of the curves % of inhibition of contractions/logarithm of the concentration of the agonist CB1 compound, with increasing the concentration of the antagonist CB1 compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs reported in the literature, the experimentation has been carried out by using albino CD1 mice weighing 30-40 grams. The mice deferent vessel was recovered and transferred into an instrument for separated organs supplied by the Firm Ugo Basile (Comerio, Italy). The initial tension was of 0.5 g. The procedure adopted is reported in\n Pertwee et al. in Br. J. Pharmacol., 110:1483-1490, 1993\n. In particular the procedure and instruments as described by \nS.Ruiu et al. in J.P.E.T., Vol. 306, 2003, 363-370\n, have been used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1\n shows the results expressed as an average of seven different experiments, and shows that the compound under tes was effective in inhibiting the contractions induced by an electric stimulus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a subsequent experiment it was shown that the compound activity was antagonized by the antagonist CB1 compound \nN-\npiperidinyl-[8-chloro-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,4,5,6-tetrahydrobenzo[6,7] cyclohepta[1,2-\nc\n]pyrazol-3-carboxamide], described by\n S.Ruiu et al. in J.P.E.T., Vol. 306, 2003, 363-370\n. The experiment was carried out by adding the antagonist (concentration in bath 1 nM) 20 minutes before the first addition of the compound of the invention. This experimental model shows that the compound of example 3.1 is a CB1 agonist.\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 8.1 (Comparative)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparation of ethyl α-(4-oxo-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-benzo-thiophen-5-yl)-α-oxo-acetate\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe same procedure described in example 1.1a was followed but using 5\nH\n-6,7-dihydro-benzo[\nb\n]thiophen-4-one (13.14 mmoles) instead of 2-methyl-4\nH\n-5,6-dihydro-cyclopenta[\nb\n]thiophen-6-one.
