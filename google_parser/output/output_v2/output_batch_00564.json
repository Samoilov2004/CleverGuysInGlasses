Description\n\n\n\n\nRELATED APPLICATION\n\n\n \n \n \nThis application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/299,562, filed Jan. 29, 2010, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated in its entirety herein by reference.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates generally to compounds and methods for treating ocular disorders. The invention relates specifically to the use of certain well-defined cyclopentanes for the treatment of ocular hypertension and glaucoma.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nOcular hypotensive agents are useful in the treatment of a number of various ocular hypertensive conditions, such as post-surgical and post-laser trabeculectomy ocular hypertensive episodes, glaucoma, and as presurgical adjuncts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlaucoma is a disease of the eye characterized by increased intraocular pressure. On the basis of its etiology, glaucoma has been classified as primary or secondary. For example, primary glaucoma in adults (congenital glaucoma) may be either open-angle or acute or chronic angle-closure. Secondary glaucoma results from pre-existing ocular diseases such as uveitis, intraocular tumor or an enlarged cataract.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe underlying causes of primary glaucoma are not yet known. The increased intraocular tension is due to the obstruction of aqueous humor outflow. In chronic open-angle glaucoma, the anterior chamber and its anatomic structures appear normal, but drainage of the aqueous humor is impeded. In acute or chronic angle-closure glaucoma, the anterior chamber is shallow, the filtration angle is narrowed, and the iris may obstruct the trabecular meshwork at the entrance of the canal of Schlemm. Dilation of the pupil may push the root of the iris forward against the angle, and may produce pupilary block and thus precipitate an acute attack. Eyes with narrow anterior chamber angles are predisposed to acute angle-closure glaucoma attacks of various degrees of severity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSecondary glaucoma is caused by any interference with the flow of aqueous humor from the posterior chamber into the anterior chamber and subsequently, into the canal of Schlemm. Inflammatory disease of the anterior segment may prevent aqueous escape by causing complete posterior synechia in iris bombe, and may plug the drainage channel with exudates. Other common causes are intraocular tumors, enlarged cataracts, central retinal vein occlusion, trauma to the eye, operative procedures and intraocular hemorrhage. Considering all types together, glaucoma occurs in about 2% of all persons over the age of 40 and may be asymptotic for years before progressing to rapid loss of vision. In cases where surgery is not indicated, topical β-adrenoreceptor antagonists have traditionally been the drugs of choice for treating glaucoma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain eicosanoids and their derivatives are currently commercially available for use in glaucoma management. Eicosanoids and derivatives include numerous biologically important compounds such as prostaglandins and their derivatives. Prostaglandins can be described as derivatives of prostanoic acid which have the following structural formula:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious types of prostaglandins are known, depending on the structure and substituents carried on the alicyclic ring of the prostanoic acid skeleton. Further classification is based on the number of unsaturated bonds in the side chain indicated by numerical subscripts after the generic type of prostaglandin [e.g. prostaglandin E\n1 \n(PGE\n1\n), prostaglandin E\n2 \n(PGE\n2\n)], and on the configuration of the substituents on the alicyclic ring indicated by α or β [e.g. prostaglandin F\n2α\n (PGF\n2β\n)].\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention provides well-defined cyclopentanes for treating glaucoma and ocular hypertension.

Salts can form from or incorporate one or more deprotonated acidic groups (e.g. carboxylic acids), one or more protonated basic groups (e.g. amines), or both (e.g. zwitterions).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “prodrug” is a compound which is converted to a therapeutically active compound after administration, and the term should be interpreted as broadly herein as is generally understood in the art. While not intending to limit the scope of the invention, conversion may occur by hydrolysis of an ester group or some other biologically labile group. Generally, but not necessarily, a prodrug is inactive or less active than the therapeutically active compound to which it is converted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProdrug preparation is well known in the art. For example, “Prodrugs and Drug Delivery Systems,” which is a chapter in Richard B. Silverman, \nOrganic Chemistry of Drug Design and Drug Action, \n2d Ed., Elsevier Academic Press: Amsterdam, 2004, pp. 496-557, provides further detail on the subject. In particular, alkyl esters having such as methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, and the like are contemplated. Also contemplated are prodrugs containing a polar group such as hydroxyl or morpholine. Examples of such prodrugs include compounds containing the moieties —CO\n2\n(CH\n2\n)\n2\nOH,\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nand the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention are useful for reducing intraocular pressure. Reduction of intraocular pressure has been shown to delay or prevent the onset of primary open angle glaucoma, and to delay or prevent further vision loss in patients with primary open angle glaucoma. Thus, these compounds are also useful for treating glaucoma. Different types of suitable dosage forms and medicaments are well known in the art, and can be readily adapted for delivery of the compounds disclosed herein. For example, the compound could be dissolved or suspended in an aqueous solution or emulsion that is buffered to an appropriate pH, and administered topically to an eye of a mammal (see U.S. Pat. No. 7,091,231).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the purposes of this disclosure, “treat,” “treating,” or “treatment” refer to the use of a compound, composition, therapeutically active agent, or drug in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease or other undesirable condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnless otherwise indicated, reference to a compound should be construed broadly to include pharmaceutically acceptable salts, prodrugs, tautomers, alternate solid forms, non-covalent complexes, and combinations thereof, of a chemical entity of a depicted structure or chemical name.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTautomers are isomers that are in rapid equilibrium with one another. For example, tautomers may be related by transfer of a proton, hydrogen atom, or hydride ion. Unless stereochemistry is explicitly and unambiguously depicted, a structure is intended to include every possible stereoisomer, both pure or in any possible mixture.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternate solid forms are different solid forms than those that may result from practicing the procedures described herein. For example, alternate solid forms may be polymorphs, different kinds of amorphous solid forms, glasses, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-covalent complexes are complexes that may form between the compound and one or more additional chemical species that do not involve a covalent bonding interaction between the compound and the additional chemical species. They may or may not have a specific ratio between the compound and the additional chemical species. Examples might include solvates, hydrates, charge transfer complexes, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThose skilled in the art will readily understand that for administration or the manufacture of medicaments the compounds disclosed herein can be admixed with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which per se are well known in the art. Specifically, a drug to be administered systemically, it may be confected as a powder, pill, tablet or the like, or as a solution, emulsion, suspension, aerosol, syrup or elixir suitable for oral or parenteral administration or inhalation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor solid dosage forms or medicaments, non-toxic solid carriers include, but are not limited to, pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharin, the polyalkylene glycols, talcum, cellulose, glucose, sucrose and magnesium carbonate. The solid dosage forms may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distcarate may be employed. They may also be coated by the technique described in the U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,256,108; 4,166,452; and 4,265,874 to form osmotic therapeutic tablets for control release. Liquid pharmaceutically administrable dosage forms can, for example, comprise a solution or suspension of one or more of the presently useful compounds and optional pharmaceutical adjutants in a carrier, such as for example, water, saline, aqueous dextrose, glycerol, ethanol and the like, to thereby form a solution or suspension. If desired, the pharmaceutical composition to be administered may also contain minor amounts of nontoxic auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents and the like. Typical examples of such auxiliary agents are sodium acetate, sorbitan monolaurate, triethanolamine, sodium acetate, triethanolamine oleate, etc. Actual methods of preparing such dosage forms are known, or will be apparent, to those skilled in this art; for example, see Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., 16th Edition, 1980. The composition of the formulation to be administered, in any event, contains a quantity of one or more of the presently useful compounds in an amount effective to provide the desired therapeutic effect.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParenteral administration is generally characterized by injection, either subcutaneously, intramuscularly or intravenously. Injectables can be prepared in conventional forms, either as liquid solutions or suspensions, solid forms suitable for solution or suspension in liquid prior to injection, or as emulsions. Suitable excipients are, for example, water, saline, dextrose, glycerol, ethanol and the like. In addition, if desired, the injectable pharmaceutical compositions to be administered may also contain minor amounts of non-toxic auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of the presently useful compound or compounds administered is, of course, dependent on the therapeutic effect or effects desired, on the specific mammal being treated, on the severity and nature of the mammal's condition, on the manner of administration, on the potency and pharmacodynamics of the particular compound or compounds employed, and on the judgment of the prescribing physician. The therapeutically effective dosage of the presently useful compound or compounds is preferably in the range of about 0.5 or about 1 to about 100 mg/kg/day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA liquid which is ophthalmically acceptable is formulated such that it can be administered topically to the eye. The comfort should be maximized as much as possible, although sometimes formulation considerations (e.g. drug stability) may necessitate less than optimal comfort. In the case that comfort cannot be maximized, the liquid should be formulated such that the liquid is tolerable to the patient for topical ophthalmic use. Additionally, an ophthalmically acceptable liquid should either be packaged for single use, or contain a preservative to prevent contamination over multiple uses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor ophthalmic application, solutions or medicaments are often prepared using a physiological saline solution as a major vehicle. Ophthalmic solutions should preferably be maintained at a comfortable pH with an appropriate buffer system. The formulations may also contain conventional, pharmaceutically acceptable preservatives, stabilizers and surfactants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreservatives that may be used in the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention include, but are not limited to, benzalkonium chloride, chlorobutanol, thimerosal, phenylmercuric acetate and phenylmercuric nitrate. A useful surfactant is, for example, Tween 80. Likewise, various useful vehicles may be used in the ophthalmic preparations of the present invention. These vehicles include, but are not limited to, polyvinyl alcohol, povidone, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, poloxamers, carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose and purified water.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTonicity adjustors may be added as needed or convenient. They include, but are not limited to, salts, particularly sodium chloride, potassium chloride, mannitol and glycerin, or any other suitable ophthalmically acceptable tonicity adjustor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious buffers and means for adjusting pH may be used so long as the resulting preparation is ophthalmically acceptable. Accordingly, buffers include acetate buffers, citrate buffers, phosphate buffers and borate buffers. Acids or bases may be used to adjust the pH of these formulations as needed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a similar vein, an ophthalmically acceptable antioxidant for use in the present invention includes, but is not limited to, sodium metabisulfite, sodium thiosulfate, acetylcysteine, butylated hydroxyanisole and butylated hydroxytoluene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther excipient components which may be included in the ophthalmic preparations are chelating agents. A useful chelating agent is edetate disodium, although other chelating agents may also be used in place or in conjunction with it.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ingredients are usually used in the following amounts:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIngredient\n\n\nAmount (% w/v)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nactive ingredient\n\n\nabout 0.001-5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\npreservative\n\n\n \n \n0-0.10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nvehicle\n\n\n0-40\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ntonicity adjustor\n\n\n1-10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nbuffer\n\n\n0.01-10 \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\npH adjustor\n\n\nq.s. pH 4.5-7.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nantioxidant\n\n\nas needed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nsurfactant\n\n\nas needed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\npurified water\n\n\nas needed to make 100%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor topical use, creams, ointments, gels, solutions or suspensions, etc., containing the compound disclosed herein are employed.
