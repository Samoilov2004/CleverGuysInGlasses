Description\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThis application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/783,746, filed Mar. 17, 2006, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to anti-TAT226 antibodies and immunoconjugates thereof. The invention further relates to methods of using anti-TAT226 antibodies and immunoconjugates thereof.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND\n\n\n \n \n \nAntibodies that bind to polypeptides expressed on the surface of cancer cells have proven to be effective anti-cancer therapies. Such antibodies act through various mechanisms including, for example, activation of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC); induction by the antibody of complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC); enhancement of cytokine release; and induction of apoptosis. See, e.g, Cardarelli et al. (2002) \nCancer Immunol. Immunother. \n51:15-24. For example, HERCEPTIN® and RITUXAN® (both from Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, Calif.) are antibodies that have been used successfully to treat breast cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, respectively. HERCEPTIN® is a recombinant DNA-derived humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to the extracellular domain of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) proto-oncogene. HER2 protein overexpression is observed in 25-30% of primary breast cancers. RITUXAN® is a genetically engineered chimeric murine/human monoclonal antibody directed against the CD20 antigen found on the surface of normal and malignant B lymphocytes. Both these antibodies are recombinantly produced in CHO cells. HERCEPTIN® appears to act, at least in part, by inhibiting angiogenesis (Izumi et al. (2002) \nNature \n416:279-280), and RITUXAN® appears to act, at least in part, by inducing apoptosis (Cardarelli et al. (2002) \nCancer Immunol. Immunother. \n51:15-24).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmunoconjugates, or “antibody-drug conjugates,” are useful for the local delivery of cytotoxic agents in the treatment of cancer. See, e.g., Syrigos et al. (1999) \nAnticancer Research \n19:605-614; Niculescu-Duvaz et al. (1997) \nAdv. Drug Deliv. Rev. \n26:151-172; U.S. Pat. No. 4,975,278. Immunoconjugates allow for the targeted delivery of a drug moiety to a tumor, whereas systemic administration of unconjugated cytotoxic agents may result in unacceptable levels of toxicity to normal cells as well as the tumor cells sought to be eliminated. See Baldwin et al. (Mar. 15, 1986) \nLancet \npp. 603-05; Thorpe (1985) “Antibody Carriers Of Cytotoxic Agents In Cancer Therapy: A Review,” in \nMonoclonal Antibodies '\n84\n: Biological and Clinical Applications \n(A. Pinchera et al., eds.) pp. 475-506. Immunoconjugates that target cell surface polypeptides have been and continue to be developed for the treatment of cancer. For review, see, e.g., Hamann et al. (2005) \nExpert Opin. Ther. Patents \n(2005) 15:1087-1103.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is clear that there is a continuing need for agents that target cell surface polypeptides for diagnostic and/or therapeutic purposes.

DEFINITIONS AND ABBREVIATIONS\n\n\n \n \n \nA. Definitions\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “isolated” antibody is one which has been identified and separated and/or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials which would interfere with research, diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. In some embodiments, an antibody is purified (1) to greater than 95% by weight of antibody as determined by, for example, the Lowry method, and in some embodiments, to greater than 99% by weight; (2) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of, for example, a spinning cup sequenator, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions using, for example, Coomassie blue or silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody's natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily, however, isolated antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “isolated” nucleic acid molecule is a nucleic acid molecule that is separated from at least one other nucleic acid molecule with which it is ordinarily associated, for example, in its natural environment. An isolated nucleic acid molecule further includes a nucleic acid molecule contained in cells that ordinarily express the nucleic acid molecule, but the nucleic acid molecule is present extrachromosomally or at a chromosomal location that is different from its natural chromosomal location.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Purified” means that a molecule is present in a sample at a concentration of at least 95% by weight, or at least 98% by weight of the sample in which it is contained.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “substantially similar” or “substantially the same,” as used herein, denotes a sufficiently high degree of similarity between two numeric values (for example, one associated with an antibody of the invention and the other associated with a reference/comparator antibody), such that one of skill in the art would consider the difference between the two values to be of little or no biological and/or statistical significance within the context of the biological characteristic measured by said values (e.g., Kd values). The difference between said two values is, for example, less than about 50%, less than about 40%, less than about 30%, less than about 20%, and/or less than about 10% as a function of the reference/comparator value.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase “substantially reduced,” or “substantially different,” as used herein, denotes a sufficiently high degree of difference between two numeric values (generally one associated with a molecule and the other associated with a reference/comparator molecule) such that one of skill in the art would consider the difference between the two values to be of statistical significance within the context of the biological characteristic measured by said values (e.g., Kd values). The difference between said two values is, for example, greater than about 10%, greater than about 20%, greater than about 30%, greater than about 40%, and/or greater than about 50% as a function of the value for the reference/comparator molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “vector,” as used herein, is intended to refer to a nucleic acid molecule capable of transporting another nucleic acid to which it has been linked. One type of vector is a “plasmid,” which refers to a circular double stranded DNA into which additional DNA segments may be ligated. Another type of vector is a phage vector. Another type of vector is a viral vector, wherein additional DNA segments may be ligated into the viral genome. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into which they are introduced (e.g., bacterial vectors having a bacterial origin of replication and episomal mammalian vectors). Other vectors (e.g., non-episomal mammalian vectors) can be integrated into the genome of a host cell upon introduction into the host cell, and thereby are replicated along with the host genome. Moreover, certain vectors are capable of directing the expression of genes to which they are operatively linked. Such vectors are referred to herein as “recombinant expression vectors,” or simply, “expression vectors.” In general, expression vectors of utility in recombinant DNA techniques are often in the form of plasmids. In the present specification, “plasmid” and “vector” may be used interchangeably as the plasmid is the most commonly used form of vector.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Polynucleotide,” or “nucleic acid,” as used interchangeably herein, refer to polymers of nucleotides of any length, and include DNA and RNA. The nucleotides can be deoxyribonucleotides, ribonucleotides, modified nucleotides or bases, and/or their analogs, or any substrate that can be incorporated into a polymer by DNA or RNA polymerase or by a synthetic reaction. A polynucleotide may comprise modified nucleotides, such as methylated nucleotides and their analogs. If present, modification to the nucleotide structure may be imparted before or after assembly of the polymer. The sequence of nucleotides may be interrupted by non-nucleotide components. A polynucleotide may comprise modification(s) made after synthesis, such as conjugation to a label. Other types of modifications include, for example, “caps,” substitution of one or more of the naturally occurring nucleotides with an analog, internucleotide modifications such as, for example, those with uncharged linkages (e.g., methyl phosphonates, phosphotriesters, phosphoamidates, carbamates, etc.) and with charged linkages (e.g., phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates, etc.), those containing pendant moieties, such as, for example, proteins (e.g., nucleases, toxins, antibodies, signal peptides, ply-L-lysine, etc.), those with intercalators (e.g., acridine, psoralen, etc.), those containing chelators (e.g., metals, radioactive metals, boron, oxidative metals, etc.), those containing alkylators, those with modified linkages (e.g., alpha anomeric nucleic acids, etc.), as well as unmodified forms of the polynucleotides(s). Further, any of the hydroxyl groups ordinarily present in the sugars may be replaced, for example, by phosphonate groups, phosphate groups, protected by standard protecting groups, or activated to prepare additional linkages to additional nucleotides, or may be conjugated to solid or semi-solid supports. The 5′ and 3′ terminal OH can be phosphorylated or substituted with amines or organic capping group moieties of from 1 to 20 carbon atoms. Other hydroxyls may also be derivatized to standard protecting groups. Polynucleotides can also contain analogous forms of ribose or deoxyribose sugars that are generally known in the art, including, for example, 2′-O-methyl-, 2′-O-allyl-, 2′-fluoro- or 2′-azido-ribose, carbocyclic sugar analogs, α-anomeric sugars, epimeric sugars such as arabinose, xyloses or lyxoses, pyranose sugars, furanose sugars, sedoheptuloses, acyclic analogs, and basic nucleoside analogs such as methyl riboside. One or more phosphodiester linkages may be replaced by alternative linking groups. These alternative linking groups include, but are not limited to, embodiments wherein phosphate is replaced by P(O)S (“thioate”), P(S)S (“dithioate”), (O)NR\n2 \n(“amidate”), P(O)R, P(O)OR′, CO, or CH\n2 \n(“formacetal”), in which each R or R′ is independently H or substituted or unsubstituted alkyl (1-20 C) optionally containing an ether (—O—) linkage, aryl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl or araldyl. Not all linkages in a polynucleotide need be identical. The preceding description applies to all polynucleotides referred to herein, including RNA and DNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Oligonucleotide,” as used herein, generally refers to short, generally single-stranded, generally synthetic polynucleotides that are generally, but not necessarily, less than about 200 nucleotides in length. The terms “oligonucleotide” and “polynucleotide” are not mutually exclusive. The description above for polynucleotides is equally and fully applicable to oligonucleotides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Percent (%) amino acid sequence identity” with respect to a reference polypeptide sequence is defined as the percentage of amino acid residues in a candidate sequence that are identical with the amino acid residues in the reference polypeptide sequence, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity, and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity. Alignment for purposes of determining percent amino acid sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art, for instance, using publicly available computer software such as BLAST, BLAST-2, ALIGN or Megalign (DNASTAR) software. Those skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters for aligning sequences, including any algorithms needed to achieve maximal alignment over the full length of the sequences being compared. For purposes herein, however, % amino acid sequence identity values are generated using the sequence comparison computer program ALIGN-2. The ALIGN-2 sequence comparison computer program was authored by Genentech, Inc., and the source code has been filed with user documentation in the U.S. Copyright Office, Washington D.C., 20559, where it is registered under U.S. Copyright Registration No. TXU510087. The ALIGN-2 program is publicly available from Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, Calif., or may be compiled from the source code. The ALIGN-2 program should be compiled for use on a UNIX operating system, preferably digital UNIX V4.0D. All sequence comparison parameters are set by the ALIGN-2 program and do not vary.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn situations where ALIGN-2 is employed for amino acid sequence comparisons, the % amino acid sequence identity of a given amino acid sequence A to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B (which can alternatively be phrased as a given amino acid sequence A that has or comprises a certain % amino acid sequence identity to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B) is calculated as follows:\n\n\n \n \n \n100 times the fraction X/Y\n\n\n \n \nwhere X is the number of amino acid residues scored as identical matches by the sequence alignment program ALIGN-2 in that program's alignment of A and B, and where Y is the total number of amino acid residues in B. It will be appreciated that where the length of amino acid sequence A is not equal to the length of amino acid sequence B, the % amino acid sequence identity of A to B will not equal the % amino acid sequence identity of B to A. Unless specifically stated otherwise, all % amino acid sequence identity values used herein are obtained as described in the immediately preceding paragraph using the ALIGN-2 computer program.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “TAT226,” as used herein, refers to any native TAT226 from any vertebrate source, including mammals such as primates (e.g. humans) and rodents (e.g., mice and rats), unless otherwise indicated. The term encompasses “full-length,” unprocessed TAT226 as well as any form of TAT226 that results from processing in the cell. The term also encompasses naturally occurring variants of TAT226, e.g., splice variants or allelic variants. A “mature form” of TAT226 is a form of TAT226 that has undergone processing, e.g., a form of TAT226 that has undergone N-terminal (e.g., signal sequence) and/or C-terminal cleavage and/or modification by attachment of a GPI anchor. In one embodiment, a “mature form” of TAT226 is expressed on the cell surface.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Antibodies” (Abs) and “immunoglobulins” (Igs) are glycoproteins having similar structural characteristics. While antibodies exhibit binding specificity to a specific antigen, immunoglobulins include both antibodies and other antibody-like molecules which generally lack antigen specificity. Polypeptides of the latter kind are, for example, produced at low levels by the lymph system and at increased levels by myelomas.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “antibody” and “immunoglobulin” are used interchangeably in the broadest sense and include monoclonal antibodies (e.g., full length or intact monoclonal antibodies), polyclonal antibodies, monovalent antibodies, multivalent antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity) and may also include certain antibody fragments (as described in greater detail herein). An antibody can be chimeric, human, humanized and/or affinity matured.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “anti-TAT226 antibody” or “an antibody that binds to TAT226” refers to an antibody that is capable of binding TAT226 with sufficient affinity such that the antibody is useful as a diagnostic and/or therapeutic agent in targeting TAT226. Preferably, the extent of binding of an anti-TAT226 antibody to an unrelated, non-TAT226 protein is less than about 10% of the binding of the antibody to TAT226 as measured, e.g., by a radioimmunoassay (RIA). In certain embodiments, an antibody that binds to TAT226 has a dissociation constant (Kd) of ≦1 μM, ≦100 nM, ≦10 nM, ≦1 nM, or ≦0.1 nM. In certain embodiments, an anti-TAT226 antibody binds to an epitope of TAT226 that is conserved among TAT226 from different species.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe “variable region” or “variable domain” of an antibody refers to the amino-terminal domains of the heavy or light chain of the antibody. The variable domain of the heavy chain may be referred to as “VH.” The variable domain of the light chain may be referred to as “VL.” These domains are generally the most variable parts of an antibody and contain the antigen-binding sites.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “variable” refers to the fact that certain portions of the variable domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies and are used in the binding and specificity of each particular antibody for its particular antigen. However, the variability is not evenly distributed throughout the variable domains of antibodies. It is concentrated in three segments called complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) or hypervariable regions (HVRs) both in the light-chain and the heavy-chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of variable domains are called the framework regions (FR). The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FR regions, largely adopting a beta-sheet configuration, connected by three CDRs, which form loops connecting, and in some cases forming part of, the beta-sheet structure. The CDRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FR regions and, with the CDRs from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen-binding site of antibodies (see Kabat et al., \nSequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest\n, Fifth Edition, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991)). The constant domains are not involved directly in the binding of an antibody to an antigen, but exhibit various effector functions, such as participation of the antibody in antibody-dependent cellular toxicity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe “light chains” of antibodies (immunoglobulins) from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types, called kappa (κ) and lambda (λ), based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDepending on the amino acid sequences of the constant domains of their heavy chains, antibodies (immunoglobulins) can be assigned to different classes. There are five major classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM, and several of these may be further divided into subclasses (isotypes), e.g., IgG\n1\n, IgG\n2\n, IgG\n3\n, IgG\n4\n, IgA\n1\n, and IgA\n2\n. The heavy chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called α, δ, ε, γ, and μ, respectively. The subunit structures and three-dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known and described generally in, for example, Abbas et al. \nCellular and Mol. Immunology, \n4th ed. (2000). An antibody may be part of a larger fusion molecule, formed by covalent or non-covalent association of the antibody with one or more other proteins or peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “full length antibody,” “intact antibody” and “whole antibody” are used herein interchangeably to refer to an antibody in its substantially intact form, not antibody fragments as defined below. The terms particularly refer to an antibody with heavy chains that contain the Fc region.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Antibody fragments” comprise only a portion of an intact antibody, wherein the portion retains at least one, and as many as most or all, of the functions normally associated with that portion when present in an intact antibody. In one embodiment, an antibody fragment comprises an antigen binding site of the intact antibody and thus retains the ability to bind antigen. In another embodiment, an antibody fragment, for example one that comprises the Fc region, retains at least one of the biological functions normally associated with the Fc region when present in an intact antibody, such as FcRn binding, antibody half life modulation, ADCC function and complement binding. In one embodiment, an antibody fragment is a monovalent antibody that has an in vivo half life substantially similar to an intact antibody. For example, such an antibody fragment may comprise on antigen binding arm linked to an Fc sequence capable of conferring in vivo stability to the fragment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPapain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen-binding fragments, called “Fab” fragments, each with a single antigen-binding site, and a residual “Fc” fragment, whose name reflects its ability to crystallize readily. Pepsin treatment yields an F(ab′)\n2 \nfragment that has two antigen-combining sites and is still capable of cross-linking antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Fv” is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen-binding site. In one embodiment, a two-chain Fv species consists of a dimer of one heavy- and one light-chain variable domain in tight, non-covalent association. In a single-chain Fv (scFv) species, one heavy- and one light-chain variable domain can be covalently linked by a flexible peptide linker such that the light and heavy chains can associate in a “dimeric” structure analogous to that in a two-chain Fv species. It is in this configuration that the three CDRs of each variable domain interact to define an antigen-binding site on the surface of the VH-VL dimer. Collectively, the six CDRs confer antigen-binding specificity to the antibody. However, even a single variable domain (or half of an Fv comprising only three CDRs specific for an antigen) has the ability to recognize and bind antigen, although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Fab fragment contains the heavy- and light-chain variable domains and also contains the constant domain of the light chain and the first constant domain (CH1) of the heavy chain. Fab′ fragments differ from Fab fragments by the addition of a few residues at the carboxy terminus of the heavy chain CH1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab′-SH is the designation herein for Fab′ in which the cysteine residue(s) of the constant domains bear a free thiol group. F(ab′)\n2 \nantibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab′ fragments which have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Single-chain Fv” or “scFv” antibody fragments comprise the VH and VL domains of antibody, wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. Generally, the scFv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the VH and VL domains which enables the scFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of scFv see Pluckthun, in \nThe Pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibodies\n, vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds., Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315 (1994).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “diabodies” refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites, which fragments comprise a heavy-chain variable domain (VH) connected to a light-chain variable domain (VL) in the same polypeptide chain (VH-VL). By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain, the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen-binding sites. Diabodies may be bivalent or bispecific. Diabodies are described more fully in, for example, EP 404,097; WO93/1161; Hudson et al. (2003) \nNat. Med. \n9:129-134; and Hollinger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90: 6444-6448 (1993). Triabodies and tetrabodies are also described in Hudson et al. (2003) \nNat. Med. \n9:129-134.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “monoclonal antibody” as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible mutations, e.g., naturally occurring mutations, that may be present in minor amounts. Thus, the modifier “monoclonal” indicates the character of the antibody as not being a mixture of discrete antibodies. In certain embodiments, such a monoclonal antibody typically includes an antibody comprising a polypeptide sequence that binds a target, wherein the target-binding polypeptide sequence was obtained by a process that includes the selection of a single target binding polypeptide sequence from a plurality of polypeptide sequences. For example, the selection process can be the selection of a unique clone from a plurality of clones, such as a pool of hybridoma clones, phage clones, or recombinant DNA clones. It should be understood that a selected target binding sequence can be further altered, for example, to improve affinity for the target, to humanize the target binding sequence, to improve its production in cell culture, to reduce its immunogenicity in vivo, to create a multispecific antibody, etc., and that an antibody comprising the altered target binding sequence is also a monoclonal antibody of this invention. In contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody of a monoclonal antibody preparation is directed against a single determinant on an antigen. In addition to their specificity, monoclonal antibody preparations are advantageous in that they are typically uncontaminated by other immunoglobulins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe modifier “monoclonal” indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by a variety of techniques, including, for example, the hybridoma method (e.g., Kohler et al., \nNature, \n256: 495 (1975); Harlow et al., \nAntibodies: A Laboratory Manual\n, (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2\nnd \ned. 1988); Hammerling et al., in: \nMonoclonal Antibodies and T\n-\nCell Hybridomas \n563-681 (Elsevier, N.Y., 1981)), recombinant DNA methods (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567), phage display technologies (see, e.g., Clackson et al., \nNature, \n352: 624-628 (1991); Marks et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n222: 581-597 (1992); Sidhu et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n338(2): 299-310 (2004); Lee et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n340(5): 1073-1093 (2004); Fellouse, \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n101(34): 12467-12472 (2004); and Lee et al., \nJ. Immunol. Methods \n284(1-2): 119-132 (2004), and technologies for producing human or human-like antibodies in animals that have parts or all of the human immunoglobulin loci or genes encoding human immunoglobulin sequences (see, e.g., WO98/24893; WO96/34096; WO96/33735; WO91/10741; Jakobovits et al., \nProc.

Rev. Immunol. \n13: 65-93 (1995).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include “chimeric” antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and Morrison et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n81:6851-6855 (1984)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Humanized” forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. In one embodiment, a humanized antibody is a human immunoglobulin (recipient antibody) in which residues from a hypervariable region of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit, or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity, affinity, and/or capacity. In some instances, framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications may be made to further refine antibody performance. In general, a humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin, and all or substantially all of the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally will also comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin.

This definition of a human antibody specifically excludes a humanized antibody comprising non-human antigen-binding residues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “hypervariable region,” “HVR,” or “HV,” when used herein refers to the regions of an antibody variable domain which are hypervariable in sequence and/or form structurally defined loops. Generally, antibodies comprise six hypervariable regions; three in the VH (H1, H2, H3), and three in the VL (L1, L2, L3). In native antibodies, H3 and L3 display the most diversity of the six hypervariable regions, and H3 in particular is believed to play a unique role in conferring fine specificity to antibodies. Xu et al. (2000) \nImmunity \n13:37-45; Johnson and Wu (2003) in \nMethods in Molecular Biology \n248:1-25 (Lo, ed., Human Press, Totowa, N.J.). Indeed, naturally occurring camelid antibodies consisting of a heavy chain only are functional and stable in the absence of light chain. Hamers-Casterman et al. (1993) \nNature \n363:446-448; Sheriff et al. (1996) \nNature Struct. Biol. \n3:733-736.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA number of hypervariable region delineations are in use and are encompassed herein. The Kabat Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs) are based on sequence variability and are the most commonly used (Kabat et al., \nSequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, \n5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991)). Chothia refers instead to the location of the structural loops (Chothia and Lesk \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n196:901-917 (1987)). The AbM hypervariable regions represent a compromise between the Kabat CDRs and Chothia structural loops, and are used by Oxford Molecular's AbM antibody modeling software. The “contact” hypervariable regions are based on an analysis of the available complex crystal structures. The residues from each of these hypervariable regions are noted below.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoop\n\n\nKabat\n\n\nAbM\n\n\nChothia\n\n\nContact\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL1\n\n\nL24-L34\n\n\nL24-L34\n\n\nL26-L32\n\n\nL30-L36\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL2\n\n\nL50-L56\n\n\nL50-L56\n\n\nL50-L52\n\n\nL46-L55\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL3\n\n\nL89-L97\n\n\nL89-L97\n\n\nL91-L96\n\n\nL89-L96\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH1\n\n\nH31-H35B\n\n\nH26-H35B\n\n\nH26-H32\n\n\nH30-H35B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Kabat Numbering)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH1\n\n\nH31-H35\n\n\nH26-H35\n\n\nH26-H32\n\n\nH30-H35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Chothia Numbering)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH2\n\n\nH50-H65\n\n\nH50-H58\n\n\nH53-H55\n\n\nH47-H58\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH3\n\n\nH95-H102\n\n\nH95-H102\n\n\nH96-H101\n\n\nH93-H101\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHypervariable regions may comprise “extended hypervariable regions” as follows: 24-36 or 24-34 (L1), 46-56 or 50-56 (L2) and 89-97 or 89-96 (L3) in the VL and 26-35 (H1), 50-65 or 49-65 (H2) and 93-102, 94-102, or 95-102 (H3) in the VH. The variable domain residues are numbered according to Kabat et al., supra, for each of these definitions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Framework” or “FR” residues are those variable domain residues other than the hypervariable region residues as herein defined.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “variable domain residue numbering as in Kabat” or “amino acid position numbering as in Kabat,” and variations thereof, refers to the numbering system used for heavy chain variable domains or light chain variable domains of the compilation of antibodies in Kabat et al., \nSequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, \n5\nth \nEd. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991). Using this numbering system, the actual linear amino acid sequence may contain fewer or additional amino acids corresponding to a shortening of, or insertion into, a FR or HVR of the variable domain. For example, a heavy chain variable domain may include a single amino acid insert (\nresidue\n 52a according to Kabat) after \nresidue\n 52 of H2 and inserted residues (e.g. residues 82a, 82b, and 82c, etc. according to Kabat) after heavy \nchain FR residue\n 82. The Kabat numbering of residues may be determined for a given antibody by alignment at regions of homology of the sequence of the antibody with a “standard” Kabat numbered sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “affinity matured” antibody is one with one or more alterations in one or more HVRs thereof which result in an improvement in the affinity of the antibody for antigen, compared to a parent antibody which does not possess those alteration(s). In one embodiment, an affinity matured antibody has nanomolar or even picomolar affinities for the target antigen. Affinity matured antibodies are produced by procedures known in the art. Marks et al. \nBio/Technology \n10:779-783 (1992) describes affinity maturation by VH and VL domain shuffling. Random mutagenesis of HVR and/or framework residues is described by: Barbas et al. \nProc Nat. Acad. Sci. USA \n91:3809-3813 (1994); Schier et al. \nGene \n169:147-155 (1995); Yelton et al. \nJ. Immunol. \n155:1994-2004 (1995); Jackson et al., \nJ. Immunol. \n154(7):3310-9 (1995); and Hawkins et al, \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n226:889-896 (1992).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “blocking” antibody or an “antagonist” antibody is one which inhibits or reduces biological activity of the antigen it binds. Certain blocking antibodies or antagonist antibodies substantially or completely inhibit the biological activity of the antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “agonist antibody,” as used herein, is an antibody which mimics at least one of the functional activities of a polypeptide of interest.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody “effector functions” refer to those biological activities attributable to the Fc region (a native sequence Fc region or amino acid sequence variant Fc region) of an antibody, and vary with the antibody isotype. Examples of antibody effector functions include: C1q binding and complement dependent cytotoxicity; Fc receptor binding; antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC); phagocytosis; down regulation of cell surface receptors (e.g. B cell receptor); and B cell activation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Fc receptor” or “FcR” describes a receptor that binds to the Fc region of an antibody. In some embodiments, an FcR is a native human FcR. In some embodiments, an FcR is one which binds an IgG antibody (a gamma receptor) and includes receptors of the FcγRI, FcγRII, and FcγRIII subclasses, including allelic variants and alternatively spliced forms of those receptors. FcγRII receptors include FcγRIIA (an “activating receptor”) and FcγRIIB (an “inhibiting receptor”), which have similar amino acid sequences that differ primarily in the cytoplasmic domains thereof. Activating receptor FcγRIIA contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in its cytoplasmic domain Inhibiting receptor FcγRIIB contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) in its cytoplasmic domain. (see Daëron, \nAnnu. Rev. Immunol. \n15:203-234 (1997)). FcRs are reviewed in Ravetch and Kinet, \nAnnu. Rev. Immunol \n9:457-92 (1991); Capel et al., \nImmunomethods \n4:25-34 (1994); and de Haas et al., \nJ. Lab. Clin. Med. \n126:330-41 (1995). Other FcRs, including those to be identified in the future, are encompassed by the term “FcR” herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “Fc receptor” or “FcR” also includes the neonatal receptor, FcRn, which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus (Guyer et al., \nJ. Immunol. \n117:587 (1976) and Kim et al., \nJ. Immunol. \n24:249 (1994)) and regulation of homeostasis of immunoglobulins. Methods of measuring binding to FcRn are known (see, e.g., Ghetie 1997, Hinton 2004). Binding to human FcRn in vivo and serum half life of human FcRn high affinity binding polypeptides can be assayed, e.g., in transgenic mice or transfected human cell lines expressing human FcRn, or in primates administered with the Fc variant polypeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWO00/42072 (Presta) describes antibody variants with improved or diminished binding to FcRs. The content of that patent publication is specifically incorporated herein by reference. See, also, Shields et al. \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n9(2): 6591-6604 (2001).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Human effector cells” are leukocytes which express one or more FcRs and perform effector functions. In certain embodiments, the cells express at least FcγRIII and perform ADCC effector function(s). Examples of human leukocytes which mediate ADCC include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes, cytotoxic T cells and neutrophils. The effector cells may be isolated from a native source, e.g., from blood.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity” or “ADCC” refers to a form of cytotoxicity in which secreted Ig bound onto Fc receptors (FcRs) present on certain cytotoxic cells (e.g. Natural Killer (NK) cells, neutrophils, and macrophages) enable these cytotoxic effector cells to bind specifically to an antigen-bearing target cell and subsequently kill the target cell with cytotoxins. The primary cells for mediating ADCC, NK cells, express FcγRIII only, whereas monocytes express FcγRI, FcγRII and FcγRIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet, \nAnnu. Rev. Immunol \n9:457-92 (1991). To assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest, an in vitro ADCC assay, such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,500,362 or 5,821,337 or Presta U.S. Pat. No. 6,737,056 may be performed. Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and Natural Killer (NK) cells. Alternatively, or additionally, ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo, e.g., in a animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. \nPNAS \n(\nUSA\n) 95:652-656 (1998).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Complement dependent cytotoxicity” or “CDC” refers to the lysis of a target cell in the presence of complement. Activation of the classical complement pathway is initiated by the binding of the first component of the complement system (C1q) to antibodies (of the appropriate subclass) which are bound to their cognate antigen. To assess complement activation, a CDC assay, e.g. as described in Gazzano-Santoro et al., \nJ. Immunol. Methods \n202:163 (1996), may be performed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolypeptide variants with altered Fc region amino acid sequences and increased or decreased C1q binding capability are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,194,551B1 and WO99/51642. The contents of those patent publications are specifically incorporated herein by reference. See, also, Idusogie et al. \nJ. Immunol. \n164: 4178-4184 (2000).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “Fc region-comprising polypeptide” refers to a polypeptide, such as an antibody or immunoadhesin, which comprises an Fc region. The C-terminal lysine (residue 447 according to the EU numbering system) of the Fc region may be removed, for example, during purification of the polypeptide or by recombinant engineering the nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide. Accordingly, a composition comprising a polypeptide having an Fc region according to this invention can comprise polypeptides with K447, with all K447 removed, or a mixture of polypeptides with and without the K447 residue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “acceptor human framework” for the purposes herein is a framework comprising the amino acid sequence of a VL or VH framework derived from a human immunoglobulin framework or a human consensus framework. An acceptor human framework “derived from” a human immunoglobulin framework or a human consensus framework may comprise the same amino acid sequence thereof, or it may contain pre-existing amino acid sequence changes. In some embodiments, the number of pre-existing amino acid changes are 10 or less, 9 or less, 8 or less, 7 or less, 6 or less, 5 or less, 4 or less, 3 or less, or 2 or less. Where pre-existing amino acid changes are present in a VH, preferably those changes occur at only three, two, or one of positions 71H, 73H and 78H; for instance, the amino acid residues at those positions may be 71A, 73T and/or 78A. In one embodiment, the VL acceptor human framework is identical in sequence to the VL human immunoglobulin framework sequence or human consensus framework sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “human consensus framework” is a framework which represents the most commonly occurring amino acid residues in a selection of human immunoglobulin VL or VH framework sequences. Generally, the selection of human immunoglobulin VL or VH sequences is from a subgroup of variable domain sequences. Generally, the subgroup of sequences is a subgroup as in Kabat et al., \nSequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, \n5\nth \nEd. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991). In one embodiment, for the VL, the subgroup is subgroup kappa I as in Kabat et al., supra. In one embodiment, for the VH, the subgroup is subgroup DI as in Kabat et al., supra.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “VH subgroup III consensus framework” comprises the consensus sequence obtained from the amino acid sequences in variable heavy subgroup III of Kabat et al., supra. In one embodiment, the VH subgroup III consensus framework amino acid sequence comprises at least a portion or all of each of the following sequences: EVQLVESGGGLVQPGGSLRLSCAAS (SEQ ID NO:50)-H1-WVRQAPGKGLEWV (SEQ ID NO:51)-H2-RFTISADTSKNTAYLQMNSLRAEDTAVYYC (SEQ ID NO:59)-H3-WGQGTLVTVSS (SEQ ID NO:35).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “VL subgroup I consensus framework” comprises the consensus sequence obtained from the amino acid sequences in variable light kappa subgroup I of Kabat et al., supra. In one embodiment, the VH subgroup I consensus framework amino acid sequence comprises at least a portion or all of each of the following sequences: DIQMTQSPSSLSASVGDRVTITC (SEQ ID NO:60)-L1-WYQQKPGKAPKLLIY (SEQ ID NO:61)-L2-GVPSRFSGSGSGTDFTLTISSLQPEDFATYYC (SEQ ID NO:62)-L3-FGQGTKVEIK (SEQ ID NO:63).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Binding affinity” generally refers to the strength of the sum total of noncovalent interactions between a single binding site of a molecule (e.g., an antibody) and its binding partner (e.g., an antigen). Unless indicated otherwise, as used herein, “binding affinity” refers to intrinsic binding affinity which reflects a 1:1 interaction between members of a binding pair (e.g., antibody and antigen). The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the dissociation constant (Kd). Affinity can be measured by common methods known in the art, including those described herein. Low-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen slowly and tend to dissociate readily, whereas high-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen faster and tend to remain bound longer. A variety of methods of measuring binding affinity are known in the art, any of which can be used for purposes of the present invention. Specific illustrative embodiments are described in the following.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the “Kd” or “Kd value” according to this invention is measured by a radiolabeled antigen binding assay (RIA) performed with the Fab version of an antibody of interest and its antigen as described by the following assay. Solution binding affinity of Fabs for antigen is measured by equilibrating Fab with a minimal concentration of (\n125\nI)-labeled antigen in the presence of a titration series of unlabeled antigen, then capturing bound antigen with an anti-Fab antibody-coated plate (Chen, et al., (1999) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n293:865-881). To establish conditions for the assay, microtiter plates (Dynex) are coated overnight with 5 μg/ml of a capturing anti-Fab antibody (Cappel Labs) in 50 mM sodium carbonate (pH 9.6), and subsequently blocked with 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for two to five hours at room temperature (approximately 23° C.). In a non-adsorbent plate (Nunc #269620), 100 pM or 26 pM [\n125\nI]-antigen are mixed with serial dilutions of a Fab of interest (e.g., consistent with assessment of the anti-VEGF antibody, Fab-12, in Presta et al., (1997) \nCancer Res. \n57:4593-4599). The Fab of interest is then incubated overnight; however, the incubation may continue for a longer period (e.g., about 65 hours) to ensure that equilibrium is reached. Thereafter, the mixtures are transferred to the capture plate for incubation at room temperature (e.g., for one hour). The solution is then removed and the plate washed eight times with 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS. When the plates have dried, 150 μl/well of scintillant (MicroScint-20; Packard) is added, and the plates are counted on a Topcount gamma counter (Packard) for ten minutes. Concentrations of each Fab that give less than or equal to 20% of maximal binding are chosen for use in competitive binding assays.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to another embodiment, the Kd or Kd value is measured by using surface plasmon resonance assays using a BIAcore™-2000 or a BIAcore™-3000 (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.) at 25° C. with immobilized antigen CM5 chips at ˜10 response units (RU). Briefly, carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CM5, BIAcore Inc.) are activated with N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's instructions. Antigen is diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, to 5 μg/ml (˜0.2 μM) before injection at a flow rate of 5 μl/minute to achieve approximately 10 response units (RU) of coupled protein. Following the injection of antigen, 1 M ethanolamine is injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of Fab (0.78 nM to 500 nM) are injected in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) at 25° C. at a flow rate of approximately 25 μl/min. Association rates (k\non\n) and dissociation rates (k\noff\n) are calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIAcore Evaluation Software version 3.2) by simultaneously fitting the association and dissociation sensorgrams. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) is calculated as the ratio k\noff\n/k\non\n. See, e.g., Chen, Y., et al., (1999) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n293:865-881. If the on-rate exceeds 10\n6 \nM\n−1 \ns\n−1 \nby the surface plasmon resonance assay above, then the on-rate can be determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity (excitation=295 nm; emission=340 nm, 16 nm band-pass) at 25° C. of a 20 nM anti-antigen antibody (Fab form) in PBS, pH 7.2, in the presence of increasing concentrations of antigen as measured in a spectrometer, such as a stop-flow equipped spectrophometer (Aviv Instruments) or a 8000-series SLM-Aminco spectrophotometer (ThermoSpectronic) with a stirred cuvette.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “on-rate,” “rate of association,” “association rate,” or “k\non\n” according to this invention can also be determined as described above using a BIAcore™-2000 or a BIAcore™-3000 system (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “disorder” is any condition or disease that would benefit from treatment with an substance/molecule or method of the invention. This includes chronic and acute disorders including those pathological conditions which predispose the mammal to the disorder in question. Non-limiting examples of disorders to be treated herein include cancerous conditions such as tumors, e.g., carcinomas (epithelial tumors) and blastomas (embryonic tissue-derived tumors), and in some embodiments, ovarian cancer, uterine cancer (including endometrial cancer), brain tumors (e.g., astrocytomas and gliomas), and kidney cancer, including nephroblastomas (e.g., Wilms' tumor).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “cell proliferative disorder” and “proliferative disorder” refer to disorders that are associated with some degree of abnormal cell proliferation. In one embodiment, the cell proliferative disorder is cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Tumor,” as used herein, refers to all neoplastic cell growth and proliferation, whether malignant or benign, and all pre-cancerous and cancerous cells and tissues. The terms “cancer,” “cancerous,” “cell proliferative disorder,” “proliferative disorder” and “tumor” are not mutually exclusive as referred to herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “cancer” and “cancerous” refer to or describe the physiological condition in mammals that is typically characterized by unregulated cell growth/proliferation. Examples of cancer include, but are not limited to, carcinoma, lymphoma (e.g., Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma), blastoma, sarcoma, and leukemia. More particular examples of such cancers include squamous cell cancer, small-cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma of the lung, squamous carcinoma of the lung, cancer of the peritoneum, hepatocellular cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, pancreatic cancer, glioma, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer, bladder cancer, hepatoma, breast cancer, colon cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial or uterine carcinoma, salivary gland carcinoma, kidney cancer, liver cancer, prostate cancer, vulval cancer, thyroid cancer, hepatic carcinoma, leukemia and other lymphoproliferative disorders, and various types of head and neck cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “treatment” (and variations such as “treat” or “treating”) refers to clinical intervention in an attempt to alter the natural course of the individual or cell being treated, and can be performed either for prophylaxis or during the course of clinical pathology. Desirable effects of treatment include preventing occurrence or recurrence of disease, alleviation of symptoms, diminishment of any direct or indirect pathological consequences of the disease, preventing metastasis, decreasing the rate of disease progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state, and remission or improved prognosis. In some embodiments, antibodies of the invention are used to delay development of a disease or disorder or to slow the progression of a disease or disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “individual” is a vertebrate. In certain embodiments, the vertebrate is a mammal. Mammals include, but are not limited to, farm animals (such as cows), sport animals, pets (such as cats, dogs, and horses), primates, mice and rats. In certain embodiments, a mammal is a human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “effective amount” refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired therapeutic or prophylactic result.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “therapeutically effective amount” of a substance/molecule of the invention may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the individual, and the ability of the substance/molecule, to elicit a desired response in the individual. A therapeutically effective amount encompasses an amount in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the substance/molecule are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects. A “prophylactically effective amount” refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired prophylactic result.

They may be hormones themselves. Examples include anti-estrogens and selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), including, for example, tamoxifen (including NOLVADEX® tamoxifen), EVISTA® raloxifene, droloxifene, 4-hydroxytamoxifen, trioxifene, keoxifene, LY117018, onapristone, and FARESTON® toremifene; anti-progesterones; estrogen receptor down-regulators (ERDs); agents that function to suppress or shut down the ovaries, for example, leutinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists such as LUPRON® and ELIGARD® leuprolide acetate, goserelin acetate, buserelin acetate and tripterelin; other anti-androgens such as flutamide, nilutamide and bicalutamide; and aromatase inhibitors that inhibit the enzyme aromatase, which regulates estrogen production in the adrenal glands, such as, for example, 4(5)-imidazoles, aminoglutethimide, MEGASE® megestrol acetate, AROMASIN® exemestane, formestanie, fadrozole, RIVISOR® vorozole, FEMARA® letrozole, and ARIMIDEX® anastrozole.

Thus, the growth inhibitory agent may be one which significantly reduces the percentage of cells (such as a cell expressing TAT226) in S phase. Examples of growth inhibitory agents include agents that block cell cycle progression (at a place other than S phase), such as agents that induce G1 arrest and M-phase arrest.

Further information can be found in \nThe Molecular Basis of Cancer\n, Mendelsohn and Israel, eds., \nChapter\n 1, entitled “Cell cycle regulation, oncogenes, and antineoplastic drugs” by Murakami et al. (WB Saunders: Philadelphia, 1995), especially p. 13. The taxanes (paclitaxel and docetaxel) are anticancer drugs both derived from the yew tree. Docetaxel (TAXOTERE®, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer), derived from the European yew, is a semisynthetic analogue of paclitaxel (TAXOL®, Bristol-Myers Squibb). Paclitaxel and docetaxel promote the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers and stabilize microtubules by preventing depolymerization, which results in the inhibition of mitosis in cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “intracellular metabolite” refers to a compound resulting from a metabolic process or reaction inside a cell on an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). The metabolic process or reaction may be an enzymatic process, such as proteolytic cleavage of a peptide linker of the ADC, or hydrolysis of a functional group such as a hydrazone, ester, or amide. Intracellular metabolites include, but are not limited to, antibodies and free drug which have undergone intracellular cleavage after entry, diffusion, uptake or transport into a cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “intracellularly cleaved” and “intracellular cleavage” refer to a metabolic process or reaction inside a cell on an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) whereby the covalent attachment, i.e. linker, between the drug moiety (D) and the antibody (Ab) is broken, resulting in the free drug dissociated from the antibody inside the cell. The cleaved moieties of the ADC are thus intracellular metabolites.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “bioavailability” refers to the systemic availability (i.e., blood/plasma levels) of a given amount of drug administered to a patient. Bioavailability is an absolute term that indicates measurement of both the time (rate) and total amount (extent) of drug that reaches the general circulation from an administered dosage form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “cytotoxic activity” refers to a cell-killing, cytostatic or growth inhibitory effect of an antibody-drug conjugate or an intracellular metabolite of an antibody-drug conjugate.

P. Parker, Ed., \nMcGraw\n-\nHill Dictionary of Chemical Terms \n(1984) McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York; and Eliel, E. and Wilen, S., \nStereochemistry of Organic Compounds \n(1994) John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York. Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms, i.e., they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. In describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L, or R and S, are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center(s). The prefixes d and l or (+) and (−) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with (−) or l meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with (+) or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure, these stereoisomers are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer may also be referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or a racemate, which may occur where there has been no stereoselection or stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process. The terms “racemic mixture” and “racemate” refer to an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species, devoid of optical activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Leaving group” refers to a functional group that can be substituted by another functional group. Certain leaving groups are well known in the art, and examples include, but are not limited to, a halide (e.g., chloride, bromide, iodide), methanesulfonyl (mesyl), p-toluenesulfonyl (tosyl), trifluoromethylsulfonyl (triflate), and trifluoromethylsulfonate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nB.

COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS OF MAKING THE SAME\n\n\n \n \n \nAntibodies that bind to TAT226 are provided. Immunoconjugates comprising anti-TAT226 antibodies are provided. Antibodies and immunoconjugates of the invention are useful, e.g., for the diagnosis or treatment of disorders associated with altered expression, e.g., increased expression, of TAT226. In certain embodiments, antibodies or immunoconjugates of the invention are useful for the diagnosis or treatment of a cell proliferative disorder, such as cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA. Anti-TAT226 Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTAT226 (“Tumor-associated Antigenic Target no. 226”) is a protein that is processed and expressed on the surface of certain cell types, including tumor cells. In particular, human TAT226 has previously been reported to be overexpressed in certain types of tumors, including ovarian, uterine, endometrial, kidney, lung, pancreatic, adrenal, and hepatocellular tumors. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. US 2003/0148408 A1, US 2004/0229277 A1, and US 2003/0100712 A1 (referring to TAT226 as “PRO9917”); and U.S. Pat. No. 6,710,170 B2 (SEQ ID NO:215). Other database entries and disclosures related to TAT226 are as follows: NCBI accession no. AY358628\n—\n1 (referring to human TAT226 as “PSCA Hlog”); NCBI accession no. AAQ88991.1 and “gi” no. 37182378 (referring to human TAT226 as “PSCA Hlog”); RIKEN cDNA 2700050C12; US 2003/0096961 A1 (SEQ ID NO:16); US 2003/0129192 A1 (SEQ ID NO:215); US 2003/0206918 A1 (Example 5; SEQ ID NO:215); US 2003/0232056 A1 (SEQ ID NO:215); US 2004/0044179 A1 (SEQ ID NO:16); US 2004/0044180 A1 (SEQ ID NO:16); US 2005/0238649 A1 (referring to human TAT226 as “PSCA Hlog”); WO 2003/025148 (SEQ ID NO:292); WO 2003/105758 (SEQ ID NO:14); and EP 1347046 (SEQ ID NO:2640).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFull-length TAT226 undergoes processing in the cell to generate a mature form of the protein that is expressed on the cell surface. For example, a full length human TAT226 as shown in SEQ ID NO:75 contains a predicted signal peptide sequence from amino acids 1-20 or 1-22, which is predicted to be cleaved from the protein. The C-terminus from amino acids 116-141 is predicted to be cleaved from the protein, and a GPI moiety attached to the protein at amino acid 115. A mature form of human TAT226, from amino acids 21-115 or 23-115 of SEQ ID NO:75, is predicted to be anchored to the cell surface via the GPI moiety. Monkey and rodent TAT226 (see, e.g., SEQ ID NOs:76-78) are highly similar to human TAT226 and thus are believed to be cleaved and modified at the equivalent amino acid positions. See \nFIG. 1\n. The resulting mature forms of human, monkey, and rodent TAT226 from amino acid 21-115 or 23-115 (as shown in \nFIG. 1\n) are 100% identical.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther features of human TAT226 include a predicted N-glycosylation site at \namino acid\n 45, which was confirmed empirically, and a predicted Ly6/u-PAR domain from amino acids 94-107 of SEQ ID NO:75. Human TAT226 has about 32% amino acid homology with prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA), a prostate cancer-specific tumor antigen that is expressed on the cell surface via a GPI linkage. See Reiter et al. (1998) \nProc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA \n95:1735-1740. PSCA is overexpressed in over 80% of prostate cancers. Id. Like TAT226, it contains a predicted Ly6/u-PAR domain, which has been implicated in cell functions such as signal transduction and cell adhesion.

In some embodiments, an antibody that binds to a mature form of TAT226 expressed on the cell surface inhibits the growth of a cell.

Antibody Fragments\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention encompasses antibody fragments. Antibody fragments may be generated by traditional means, such as enzymatic digestion, or by recombinant techniques. In certain circumstances there are advantages of using antibody fragments, rather than whole antibodies. The smaller size of the fragments allows for rapid clearance, and may lead to improved access to solid tumors. For a review of certain antibody fragments, see Hudson et al. (2003) \nNat. Med. \n9:129-134.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious techniques have been developed for the production of antibody fragments. Traditionally, these fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies (see, e.g., Morimoto et al., \nJournal of Biochemical and Biophysical Methods \n24:107-117 (1992); and Brennan et al., \nScience, \n229:81 (1985)). However, these fragments can now be produced directly by recombinant host cells. Fab, Fv and ScFv antibody fragments can all be expressed in and secreted from \nE. coli\n, thus allowing the facile production of large amounts of these fragments. Antibody fragments can be isolated from the antibody phage libraries discussed above. Alternatively, Fab′-SH fragments can be directly recovered from \nE. coli \nand chemically coupled to form F(ab′)\n2 \nfragments (Carter et al., Bio/Technology 10:163-167 (1992)). According to another approach, F(ab′)\n2 \nfragments can be isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture. Fab and F(ab′)\n2 \nfragment with increased in vivo half-life comprising salvage receptor binding epitope residues are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,869,046. Other techniques for the production of antibody fragments will be apparent to the skilled practitioner. In certain embodiments, an antibody is a single chain Fv fragment (scFv). See WO 93/16185; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,571,894; and 5,587,458. Fv and scFv are the only species with intact combining sites that are devoid of constant regions; thus, they may be suitable for reduced nonspecific binding during in vivo use. scFv fusion proteins may be constructed to yield fusion of an effector protein at either the amino or the carboxy terminus of an scFv. See \nAntibody Engineering\n, ed. Borrebaeck, supra. The antibody fragment may also be a “linear antibody”, e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,870, for example. Such linear antibodies may be monospecific or bispecific.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n3. Humanized Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention encompasses humanized antibodies. Various methods for humanizing non-human antibodies are known in the art. For example, a humanized antibody can have one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source which is non-human. These non-human amino acid residues are often referred to as “import” residues, which are typically taken from an “import” variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co-workers (Jones et al. (1986) \nNature \n321:522-525; Riechmann et al. (1988) \nNature \n332:323-327; Verhoeyen et al. (1988) \nScience \n239:1534-1536), by substituting hypervariable region sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly, such “humanized” antibodies are chimeric antibodies (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567) wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non-human species. In practice, humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some hypervariable region residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe choice of human variable domains, both light and heavy, to be used in making the humanized antibodies can be important to reduce antigenicity. According to the so-called “best-fit” method, the sequence of the variable domain of a rodent antibody is screened against the entire library of known human variable-domain sequences. The human sequence which is closest to that of the rodent is then accepted as the human framework for the humanized antibody (Sims et al. (1993) \nJ. Immunol. \n151:2296; Chothia et al. (1987) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n196:901. Another method uses a particular framework derived from the consensus sequence of all human antibodies of a particular subgroup of light or heavy chains. The same framework may be used for several different humanized antibodies (Carter et al. (1992) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, \n89:4285; Presta et al. (1993) \nJ. Immunol., \n151:2623.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is further generally desirable that antibodies be humanized with retention of high affinity for the antigen and other favorable biological properties. To achieve this goal, according to one method, humanized antibodies are prepared by a process of analysis of the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized products using three-dimensional models of the parental and humanized sequences. Three-dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable three-dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence, i.e., the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way, FR residues can be selected and combined from the recipient and import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic, such as increased affinity for the target antigen(s), is achieved. In general, the hypervariable region residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n4. Human Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHuman anti-TAT226 antibodies of the invention can be constructed by combining Fv clone variable domain sequence(s) selected from human-derived phage display libraries with known human constant domain sequences(s) as described above. Alternatively, human monoclonal anti-TAT226 antibodies of the invention can be made by the hybridoma method. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines for the production of human monoclonal antibodies have been described, for example, by Kozbor \nJ. Immunol., \n133: 3001 (1984); Brodeur et al., \nMonoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications\n, pp. 51-63 (Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987); and Boerner et al., \nJ. Immunol., \n147: 86 (1991).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is now possible to produce transgenic animals (e.g. mice) that are capable, upon immunization, of producing a full repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production. For example, it has been described that the homozygous deletion of the antibody heavy-chain joining region (JH) gene in chimeric and germ-line mutant mice results in complete inhibition of endogenous antibody production. Transfer of the human germ-line immunoglobulin gene array in such germ-line mutant mice will result in the production of human antibodies upon antigen challenge. See, e.g., Jakobovits et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad.

According to this method, which is also called “epitope imprinting”, either the heavy or light chain variable region of a non-human antibody fragment obtained by phage display techniques as described herein is replaced with a repertoire of human V domain genes, creating a population of non-human chain/human chain scFv or Fab chimeras. Selection with antigen results in isolation of a non-human chain/human chain chimeric scFv or Fab wherein the human chain restores the antigen binding site destroyed upon removal of the corresponding non-human chain in the primary phage display clone, i.e. the epitope governs (imprints) the choice of the human chain partner. When the process is repeated in order to replace the remaining non-human chain, a human antibody is obtained (see PCT WO 93/06213 published Apr. 1, 1993). Unlike traditional humanization of non-human antibodies by CDR grafting, this technique provides completely human antibodies, which have no FR or CDR residues of non-human origin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n5. Bispecific Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBispecific antibodies are monoclonal antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different antigens. In certain embodiments, bispecific antibodies are human or humanized antibodies. In certain embodiments, one of the binding specificities is for TAT226 and the other is for any other antigen. In certain embodiments, bispecific antibodies may bind to two different epitopes of TAT226. Bispecific antibodies may also be used to localize cytotoxic agents to cells which express TAT226. These antibodies possess a TAT226-binding arm and an arm which binds a cytotoxic agent, such as, e.g., saporin, anti-interferon-α, vinca alkaloid, ricin A chain, methotrexate or radioactive isotope hapten. Bispecific antibodies can be prepared as full length antibodies or antibody fragments (e.g. F(ab′)\n2 \nbispecific antibodies).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditionally, the recombinant production of bispecific antibodies is based on the co-expression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pairs, where the two heavy chains have different specificities (Milstein and Cuello, \nNature, \n305: 537 (1983)). Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, these hybridomas (quadromas) produce a potential mixture of 10 different antibody molecules, of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. The purification of the correct molecule, which is usually done by affinity chromatography steps, is rather cumbersome, and the product yields are low. Similar procedures are disclosed in WO 93/08829 published May 13, 1993, and in Traunecker et al., \nEMBO J., \n10: 3655 (1991).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to a different approach, antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities (antibody-antigen combining sites) are fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. The fusion, for example, is with an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant domain, comprising at least part of the hinge, CH2, and CH3 regions. In certain embodiments, the first heavy-chain constant region (CH1), containing the site necessary for light chain binding, is present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and, if desired, the immunoglobulin light chain, are inserted into separate expression vectors, and are co-transfected into a suitable host organism. This provides for great flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction provide the optimum yields. It is, however, possible to insert the coding sequences for two or all three polypeptide chains in one expression vector when the expression of at least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios are of no particular significance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of this approach, the bispecific antibodies are composed of a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm, and a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pair (providing a second binding specificity) in the other arm. It was found that this asymmetric structure facilitates the separation of the desired bispecific compound from unwanted immunoglobulin chain combinations, as the presence of an immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of the bispecific molecule provides for a facile way of separation. This approach is disclosed in WO 94/04690. For further details of generating bispecific antibodies see, for example, Suresh et al., \nMethods in Enzymology, \n121:210 (1986).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to another approach, the interface between a pair of antibody molecules can be engineered to maximize the percentage of heterodimers which are recovered from recombinant cell culture. The interface comprises at least a part of the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 domain of an antibody constant domain. In this method, one or more small amino acid side chains from the interface of the first antibody molecule are replaced with larger side chains (e.g. tyrosine or tryptophan). Compensatory “cavities” of identical or similar size to the large side chain(s) are created on the interface of the second antibody molecule by replacing large amino acid side chains with smaller ones (e.g. alanine or threonine). This provides a mechanism for increasing the yield of the heterodimer over other unwanted end-products such as homodimers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBispecific antibodies include cross-linked or “heteroconjugate” antibodies. For example, one of the antibodies in the heteroconjugate can be coupled to avidin, the other to biotin. Such antibodies have, for example, been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells (U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980), and for treatment of HIV infection (WO 91/00360, WO 92/00373, and EP 03089). Heteroconjugate antibodies may be made using any convenient cross-linking method. Suitable cross-linking agents are well known in the art, and are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980, along with a number of cross-linking techniques.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTechniques for generating bispecific antibodies from antibody fragments have also been described in the literature. For example, bispecific antibodies can be prepared using chemical linkage. Brennan et al., \nScience, \n229: 81 (1985) describe a procedure wherein intact antibodies are proteolytically cleaved to generate F(ab′)\n2 \nfragments. These fragments are reduced in the presence of the dithiol complexing agent sodium arsenite to stabilize vicinal dithiols and prevent intermolecular disulfide formation. The Fab′ fragments generated are then converted to thionitrobenzoate (TNB) derivatives. One of the Fab′-TNB derivatives is then reconverted to the Fab′-thiol by reduction with mercaptoethylamine and is mixed with an equimolar amount of the other Fab′-TNB derivative to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibodies produced can be used as agents for the selective immobilization of enzymes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecent progress has facilitated the direct recovery of Fab′-SH fragments from \nE. coli\n, which can be chemically coupled to form bispecific antibodies. Shalaby et al., \nJ. Exp. Med., \n175: 217-225 (1992) describe the production of a fully humanized bispecific antibody F(ab′)\n2 \nmolecule. Each Fab′ fragment was separately secreted from \nE. coli \nand subjected to directed chemical coupling in vitro to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibody thus formed was able to bind to cells overexpressing the HER2 receptor and normal human T cells, as well as trigger the lytic activity of human cytotoxic lymphocytes against human breast tumor targets.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious techniques for making and isolating bispecific antibody fragments directly from recombinant cell culture have also been described. For example, bispecific antibodies have been produced using leucine zippers. Kostelny et al., \nJ. Immunol., \n148(5):1547-1553 (1992). The leucine zipper peptides from the Fos and Jun proteins were linked to the Fab′ portions of two different antibodies by gene fusion. The antibody homodimers were reduced at the hinge region to form monomers and then re-oxidized to form the antibody heterodimers. This method can also be utilized for the production of antibody homodimers. The “diabody” technology described by Hollinger et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, \n90:6444-6448 (1993) has provided an alternative mechanism for making bispecific antibody fragments. The fragments comprise a heavy-chain variable domain (VH) connected to a light-chain variable domain (VL) by a linker which is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain. Accordingly, the VH and VL domains of one fragment are forced to pair with the complementary VL and VH domains of another fragment, thereby forming two antigen-binding sites. Another strategy for making bispecific antibody fragments by the use of single-chain Fv (sFv) dimers has also been reported. See Gruber et al., \nJ. Immunol., \n152:5368 (1994).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies with more than two valencies are contemplated. For example, trispecific antibodies can be prepared. Tutt et al. \nJ. Immunol. \n147: 60 (1991).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n6. Multivalent Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA multivalent antibody may be internalized (and/or catabolized) faster than a bivalent antibody by a cell expressing an antigen to which the antibodies bind. The antibodies of the present invention can be multivalent antibodies (which are other than of the IgM class) with three or more antigen binding sites (e.g. tetravalent antibodies), which can be readily produced by recombinant expression of nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide chains of the antibody. The multivalent antibody can comprise a dimerization domain and three or more antigen binding sites. In certain embodiments, the dimerization domain comprises (or consists of) an Fc region or a hinge region. In this scenario, the antibody will comprise an Fc region and three or more antigen binding sites amino-terminal to the Fc region. In certain embodiments, a multivalent antibody comprises (or consists of) three to about eight antigen binding sites. In one such embodiment, a multivalent antibody comprises (or consists of) four antigen binding sites. The multivalent antibody comprises at least one polypeptide chain (for example, two polypeptide chains), wherein the polypeptide chain(s) comprise two or more variable domains. For instance, the polypeptide chain(s) may comprise VD1-(X1)n-VD2-(X2)n-Fc, wherein VD1 is a first variable domain, VD2 is a second variable domain, Fc is one polypeptide chain of an Fc region, X1 and X2 represent an amino acid or polypeptide, and n is 0 or 1. For instance, the polypeptide chain(s) may comprise: VH-CH1-flexible linker-VH-CH1-Fc region chain; or VH-CH1-VH-CH1-Fc region chain. The multivalent antibody herein may further comprise at least two (for example, four) light chain variable domain polypeptides. The multivalent antibody herein may, for instance, comprise from about two to about eight light chain variable domain polypeptides. The light chain variable domain polypeptides contemplated here comprise a light chain variable domain and, optionally, further comprise a CL domain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n7. Single-Domain Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, an antibody of the invention is a single-domain antibody. A single-domain antibody is a single polypeptide chain comprising all or a portion of the heavy chain variable domain or all or a portion of the light chain variable domain of an antibody. In certain embodiments, a single-domain antibody is a human single-domain antibody (Domantis, Inc., Waltham, Mass.; see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,248,516 B1). In one embodiment, a single-domain antibody consists of all or a portion of the heavy chain variable domain of an antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n8. Antibody Variants\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, amino acid sequence modification(s) of the antibodies described herein are contemplated. For example, it may be desirable to improve the binding affinity and/or other biological properties of the antibody. Amino acid sequence variants of the antibody may be prepared by introducing appropriate changes into the nucleotide sequence encoding the antibody, or by peptide synthesis. Such modifications include, for example, deletions from, and/or insertions into and/or substitutions of, residues within the amino acid sequences of the antibody. Any combination of deletion, insertion, and substitution can be made to arrive at the final construct, provided that the final construct possesses the desired characteristics. The amino acid alterations may be introduced in the subject antibody amino acid sequence at the time that sequence is made.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA useful method for identification of certain residues or regions of the antibody that are preferred locations for mutagenesis is called “alanine scanning mutagenesis” as described by Cunningham and Wells (1989) \nScience, \n244:1081-1085. Here, a residue or group of target residues are identified (e.g., charged residues such as arg, asp, his, lys, and glu) and replaced by a neutral or negatively charged amino acid (e.g., alanine or polyalanine) to affect the interaction of the amino acids with antigen. Those amino acid locations demonstrating functional sensitivity to the substitutions then are refined by introducing further or other variants at, or for, the sites of substitution. Thus, while the site for introducing an amino acid sequence variation is predetermined, the nature of the mutation per se need not be predetermined. For example, to analyze the performance of a mutation at a given site, ala scanning or random mutagenesis is conducted at the target codon or region and the expressed immunoglobulins are screened for the desired activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmino acid sequence insertions include amino- and/or carboxyl-terminal fusions ranging in length from one residue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more residues, as well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Examples of terminal insertions include an antibody with an N-terminal methionyl residue. Other insertional variants of the antibody molecule include the fusion to the N- or C-terminus of the antibody to an enzyme (e.g. for ADEPT) or a polypeptide which increases the serum half-life of the antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, an antibody of the invention is altered to increase or decrease the extent to which the antibody is glycosylated. Glycosylation of polypeptides is typically either N-linked or O-linked. N-linked refers to the attachment of a carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The tripeptide sequences asparagine-X-serine and asparagine-X-threonine, where X is any amino acid except proline, are the recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. Thus, the presence of either of these tripeptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site. O-linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of one of the sugars N-aceylgalactosamine, galactose, or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid, most commonly serine or threonine, although 5-hydroxyproline or 5-hydroxylysine may also be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAddition or deletion of glycosylation sites to the antibody is conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that one or more of the above-described tripeptide sequences (for N-linked glycosylation sites) is created or removed. The alteration may also be made by the addition, deletion, or substitution of one or more serine or threonine residues to the sequence of the original antibody (for O-linked glycosylation sites).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere the antibody comprises an Fc region, the carbohydrate attached thereto may be altered. For example, antibodies with a mature carbohydrate structure that lacks fucose attached to an Fc region of the antibody are described in US Pat Appl No US 2003/0157108 (Presta, L.). See also US \n2004/0093621 (Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co., Ltd). Antibodies with a bisecting N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) in the carbohydrate attached to an Fc region of the antibody are referenced in WO\n 2003/011878, Jean-Mairet et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 6,602,684, Umana et al. Antibodies with at least one galactose residue in the oligosaccharide attached to an Fc region of the antibody are reported in WO 1997/30087, Patel et al. See, also, WO 1998/58964 (Raju, S.) and WO 1999/22764 (Raju, S.) concerning antibodies with altered carbohydrate attached to the Fc region thereof. See also US 2005/0123546 (Umana et al.) on antigen-binding molecules with modified glycosylation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, a glycosylation variant comprises an Fc region, wherein a carbohydrate structure attached to the Fc region lacks fucose. Such variants have improved ADCC function. Optionally, the Fc region further comprises one or more amino acid substitutions therein which further improve ADCC, for example, substitutions at positions 298, 333, and/or 334 of the Fc region (Eu numbering of residues). Examples of publications related to “defucosylated” or “fucose-deficient” antibodies include: US 2003/0157108; WO 2000/61739; WO 2001/29246; US 2003/0115614; US 2002/0164328; US 2004/0093621; US 2004/0132140; US 2004/0110704; US 2004/0110282; US 2004/0109865; WO 2003/085119; WO 2003/084570; WO 2005/035586; WO 2005/035778; WO2005/053742; Okazaki et al. J. Mol. Biol. 336:1239-1249 (2004); Yamane-Ohnuki et al. \nBiotech. Bioeng. \n87: 614 (2004). Examples of cell lines producing defucosylated antibodies include Lec13 CHO cells deficient in protein fucosylation (Ripka et al. \nArch. Biochem. Biophys. \n249:533-545 (1986); US Pat Appl No US 2003/0157108 A1, Presta, L; and WO 2004/056312 A1, Adams et al., especially at Example 11), and knockout cell lines, such as alpha-1,6-fucosyltransferase gene, FUT8, knockout CHO cells (Yamane-Ohnuki et al. \nBiotech. Bioeng. \n87: 614 (2004)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother type of variant is an amino acid substitution variant. These variants have at least one amino acid residue in the antibody molecule replaced by a different residue. Sites of interest for substitutional mutagenesis include the hypervariable regions, but FR alterations are also contemplated. Conservative substitutions are shown in Table 1 under the heading of “preferred substitutions.” If such substitutions result in a desirable change in biological activity, then more substantial changes, denominated “exemplary substitutions” in Table 1, or as further described below in reference to amino acid classes, may be introduced and the products screened.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginal\n\n\nExemplary\n\n\nPreferred\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResidue\n\n\nSubstitutions\n\n\nSubstitutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAla (A)\n\n\nVal; Leu; Ile\n\n\nVal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nArg (R)\n\n\nLys; Gln; Asn\n\n\nLys\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsn (N)\n\n\nGln; His; Asp, Lys; Arg\n\n\nGln\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsp (D)\n\n\nGlu; Asn\n\n\nGlu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCys (C)\n\n\nSer; Ala\n\n\nSer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGln (Q)\n\n\nAsn; Glu\n\n\nAsn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlu (E)\n\n\nAsp; Gln\n\n\nAsp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGly (G)\n\n\nAla\n\n\nAla\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHis (H)\n\n\nAsn; Gln; Lys; Arg\n\n\nArg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIle (I)\n\n\nLeu; Val; Met; Ala;\n\n\nLeu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPhe; Norleucine\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeu (L)\n\n\nNorleucine; Ile; Val;\n\n\nIle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMet; Ala; Phe\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLys (K)\n\n\nArg; Gln; Asn\n\n\nArg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMet (M)\n\n\nLeu; Phe; Ile\n\n\nLeu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhe (F)\n\n\nTrp; Leu; Val; Ile; Ala; Tyr\n\n\nTyr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPro (P)\n\n\nAla\n\n\nAla\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSer (S)\n\n\nThr\n\n\nThr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThr (T)\n\n\nVal; Ser\n\n\nSer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrp (W)\n\n\nTyr; Phe\n\n\nTyr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTyr (Y)\n\n\nTrp; Phe; Thr; Ser\n\n\nPhe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVal (V)\n\n\nIle; Leu; Met; Phe;\n\n\nLeu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAla; Norleucine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubstantial modifications in the biological properties of the antibody are accomplished by selecting substitutions that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining (a) the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitution, for example, as a sheet or helical conformation, (b) the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site, or (c) the bulk of the side chain. Amino acids may be grouped according to similarities in the properties of their side chains (in A. L. Lehninger, in Biochemistry, second ed., pp. 73-75, Worth Publishers, New York (1975)):\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(1) non-polar: Ala (A), Val (V), Leu (L), Ile (I), Pro (P), Phe (F), Trp (W), Met (M)\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(2) uncharged polar: Gly (G), Ser (S), Thr (T), Cys (C), Tyr (Y), Asn (N), Gln (Q)\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(3) acidic: Asp (D), Glu (E) (4) basic: Lys (K), Arg (R), His (H)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, naturally occurring residues may be divided into groups based on common side-chain properties:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(1) hydrophobic: Norleucine, Met, Ala, Val, Leu, Be;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(2) neutral hydrophilic: Cys, Ser, Thr, Asn, Gln;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(3) acidic: Asp, Glu;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(4) basic: His, Lys, Arg;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(5) residues that influence chain orientation: Gly, Pro;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(6) aromatic: Trp, Tyr, Phe.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for another class. Such substituted residues also may be introduced into the conservative substitution sites or, into the remaining (non-conserved) sites.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne type of substitutional variant involves substituting one or more hypervariable region residues of a parent antibody (e.g. a humanized or human antibody). Generally, the resulting variant(s) selected for further development will have modified (e.g., improved) biological properties relative to the parent antibody from which they are generated. A convenient way for generating such substitutional variants involves affinity maturation using phage display. Briefly, several hypervariable region sites (e.g. 6-7 sites) are mutated to generate all possible amino acid substitutions at each site. The antibodies thus generated are displayed from filamentous phage particles as fusions to at least part of a phage coat protein (e.g., the gene III product of M13) packaged within each particle. The phage-displayed variants are then screened for their biological activity (e.g. binding affinity). In order to identify candidate hypervariable region sites for modification, scanning mutagenesis (e.g., alanine scanning) can be performed to identify hypervariable region residues contributing significantly to antigen binding. Alternatively, or additionally, it may be beneficial to analyze a crystal structure of the antigen-antibody complex to identify contact points between the antibody and antigen. Such contact residues and neighboring residues are candidates for substitution according to techniques known in the art, including those elaborated herein. Once such variants are generated, the panel of variants is subjected to screening using techniques known in the art, including those described herein, and antibodies with superior properties in one or more relevant assays may be selected for further development.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acid molecules encoding amino acid sequence variants of the antibody are prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include, but are not limited to, isolation from a natural source (in the case of naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants) or preparation by oligonucleotide-mediated (or site-directed) mutagenesis, PCR mutagenesis, and cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared variant or a non-variant version of the antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt may be desirable to introduce one or more amino acid modifications in an Fc region of antibodies of the invention, thereby generating an Fc region variant. The Fc region variant may comprise a human Fc region sequence (e.g., a human IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4 Fc region) comprising an amino acid modification (e.g. a substitution) at one or more amino acid positions including that of a hinge cysteine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with this description and the teachings of the art, it is contemplated that in some embodiments, an antibody of the invention may comprise one or more alterations as compared to the wild type counterpart antibody, e.g. in the Fc region. These antibodies would nonetheless retain substantially the same characteristics required for therapeutic utility as compared to their wild type counterpart. For example, it is thought that certain alterations can be made in the Fc region that would result in altered (i.e., either improved or diminished) C1q binding and/or Complement Dependent Cytotoxicity (CDC), e.g., as described in WO99/51642. See also Duncan & Winter \nNature \n322:738-40 (1988); U.S. Pat. No. 5,648,260; U.S. Pat. No. 5,624,821; and WO94/29351 concerning other examples of Fc region variants. WO00/42072 (Presta) and WO 2004/056312 (Lowman) describe antibody variants with improved or diminished binding to FcRs.

Antibodies with increased half lives and improved binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus (Guyer et al., J. Immunol. 117:587 (1976) and Kim et al., J. Immunol. 24:249 (1994)), are described in US2005/0014934A1 (Hinton et al.). These antibodies comprise an Fc region with one or more substitutions therein which improve binding of the Fc region to FcRn. Polypeptide variants with altered Fc region amino acid sequences and increased or decreased C1q binding capability are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,194,551B1, WO99/51642.

These modifications comprise introduction of a protuberance into a first Fc polypeptide and a cavity into a second Fc polypeptide, wherein the protuberance is positionable in the cavity so as to promote complexing of the first and second Fc polypeptides.

Preferably, the moieties suitable for derivatization of the antibody are water soluble polymers. Non-limiting examples of water soluble polymers include, but are not limited to, polyethylene glycol (PEG), copolymers of ethylene glycol/propylene glycol, carboxymethylcellulose, dextran, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, poly-1,3-dioxolane, poly-1,3,6-trioxane, ethylene/maleic anhydride copolymer, polyaminoacids (either homopolymers or random copolymers), and dextran or poly(n-vinyl pyrrolidone)polyethylene glycol, propropylene glycol homopolymers, prolypropylene oxide/ethylene oxide co-polymers, polyoxyethylated polyols (e.g., glycerol), polyvinyl alcohol, and mixtures thereof. Polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde may have advantages in manufacturing due to its stability in water. The polymer may be of any molecular weight, and may be branched or unbranched. The number of polymers attached to the antibody may vary, and if more than one polymer are attached, they can be the same or different molecules. In general, the number and/or type of polymers used for derivatization can be determined based on considerations including, but not limited to, the particular properties or functions of the antibody to be improved, whether the antibody derivative will be used in a therapy under defined conditions, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, conjugates of an antibody and nonproteinaceous moiety that may be selectively heated by exposure to radiation are provided. In one embodiment, the nonproteinaceous moiety is a carbon nanotube (Kam et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 102: 11600-11605 (2005)). The radiation may be of any wavelength, and includes, but is not limited to, wavelengths that do not harm ordinary cells, but which heat the nonproteinaceous moiety to a temperature at which cells proximal to the antibody-nonproteinaceous moiety are killed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nB. Certain Methods of Making Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \n \n1. Certain Hybridoma-Based Methods\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-TAT226 monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be made using the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al., \nNature, \n256:495 (1975), or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the hybridoma method, a mouse or other appropriate host animal, such as a hamster, is immunized to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the protein used for immunization. Antibodies to TAT226 generally are raised in animals by multiple subcutaneous (sc) or intraperitoneal (ip) injections of TAT226 and an adjuvant. TAT226 may be prepared using methods well-known in the art, some of which are further described herein. For example, TAT226 may be produced recombinantly. In one embodiment, animals are immunized with a derivative of TAT226 that contains an extracellular portion of TAT226 fused to the Fc portion of an immunoglobulin heavy chain. In one embodiment, animals are immunized with an TAT226-IgG1 fusion protein. In one embodiment, animals are immunized with immunogenic derivatives of TAT226 in a solution with monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL)/trehalose dicrynomycolate (TDM) (Ribi Immunochem. Research, Inc., Hamilton, Mont.), and the solution is injected intradermally at multiple sites. Two weeks later the animals are boosted. Seven to fourteen days later the animals are bled, and the serum is assayed for anti-TAT226 titer. Animals are boosted until titer plateaus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, lymphocytes may be immunized in vitro. Lymphocytes then are fused with myeloma cells using a suitable fusing agent, such as polyethylene glycol, to form a hybridoma cell (Goding, \nMonoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice\n, pp. 59-103 (Academic Press, 1986)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe hybridoma cells thus prepared are seeded and grown in a suitable culture medium, e.g., a medium that contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused, parental myeloma cells. For example, if the parental myeloma cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (HAT medium), which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, myeloma cells are those that fuse efficiently, support stable high-level production of antibody by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. Exemplary myeloma cells include, but are not limited to, murine myeloma lines, such as those derived from MOPC-21 and MPC-11 mouse tumors available from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, Calif. USA, and SP-2 or X63-Ag8-653 cells available from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Md. USA. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies (Kozbor, \nJ. Immunol., \n133:3001 (1984); Brodeur et al., \nMonoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications\n, pp. 51-63 (Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCulture medium in which hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production of monoclonal antibodies that bind to TAT226. Preferably, the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA). The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can, for example, be determined by the Scatchard analysis of Munson et al., \nAnal. Biochem., \n107:220 (1980).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter hybridoma cells are identified that produce antibodies of the desired specificity, affinity, and/or activity, the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods (Goding, \nMonoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice\n, pp. 59-103 (Academic Press, 1986)). Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, D-MEM or RPMI-1640 medium. In addition, the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites tumors in an animal. Monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones are suitably separated from the culture medium, ascites fluid, or serum by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as, for example, protein A-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, or affinity chromatography.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n2. Certain Library Screening Methods\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-TAT226 antibodies of the invention can be made by using combinatorial libraries to screen for antibodies with the desired activity or activities. For example, a variety of methods are known in the art for generating phage display libraries and screening such libraries for antibodies possessing the desired binding characteristics. Such methods are described generally in Hoogenboom et al. (2001) in \nMethods in Molecular Biology. \n178:1-37 (O'Brien et al., ed., Human Press, Totowa, N.J.), and in certain embodiments, in Lee et al. (2004) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n340:1073-1093.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn principle, synthetic antibody clones are selected by screening phage libraries containing phage that display various fragments of antibody variable region (Fv) fused to phage coat protein. Such phage libraries are panned by affinity chromatography against the desired antigen. Clones expressing Fv fragments capable of binding to the desired antigen are adsorbed to the antigen and thus separated from the non-binding clones in the library. The binding clones are then eluted from the antigen, and can be further enriched by additional cycles of antigen adsorption/elution. Any of the anti-TAT226 antibodies of the invention can be obtained by designing a suitable antigen screening procedure to select for the phage clone of interest followed by construction of a full length anti-TAT226 antibody clone using the Fv sequences from the phage clone of interest and suitable constant region (Fc) sequences described in Kabat et al., \nSequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest\n, Fifth Edition, NIH Publication 91-3242, Bethesda Md. (1991), vols. 1-3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the antigen-binding domain of an antibody is formed from two variable (V) regions of about 110 amino acids, one each from the light (VL) and heavy (VH) chains, that both present three hypervariable loops (HVRs) or complementarity-determining regions (CDRs). Variable domains can be displayed functionally on phage, either as single-chain Fv (scFv) fragments, in which VH and VL are covalently linked through a short, flexible peptide, or as Fab fragments, in which they are each fused to a constant domain and interact non-covalently, as described in Winter et al., \nAnn. Rev. Immunol., \n12: 433-455 (1994). As used herein, scFv encoding phage clones and Fab encoding phage clones are collectively referred to as “Fv phage clones” or “Fv clones.”\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRepertoires of VH and VL genes can be separately cloned by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and recombined randomly in phage libraries, which can then be searched for antigen-binding clones as described in Winter et al., \nAnn. Rev. Immunol., \n12: 433-455 (1994). Libraries from immunized sources provide high-affinity antibodies to the immunogen without the requirement of constructing hybridomas. Alternatively, the naive repertoire can be cloned to provide a single source of human antibodies to a wide range of non-self and also self antigens without any immunization as described by Griffiths et al., \nEMBO J, \n12: 725-734 (1993). Finally, naive libraries can also be made synthetically by cloning the unrearranged V-gene segments from stem cells, and using PCR primers containing random sequence to encode the highly variable CDR3 regions and to accomplish rearrangement in vitro as described by Hoogenboom and Winter, \nJ. Mol. Biol., \n227: 381-388 (1992).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, filamentous phage is used to display antibody fragments by fusion to the minor coat protein pIII. The antibody fragments can be displayed as single chain Fv fragments, in which VH and VL domains are connected on the same polypeptide chain by a flexible polypeptide spacer, e.g. as described by Marks et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol., \n222: 581-597 (1991), or as Fab fragments, in which one chain is fused to pIII and the other is secreted into the bacterial host cell periplasm where assembly of a Fab-coat protein structure which becomes displayed on the phage surface by displacing some of the wild type coat proteins, e.g. as described in Hoogenboom et al., \nNucl. Acids Res., \n19: 4133-4137 (1991).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, nucleic acids encoding antibody gene fragments are obtained from immune cells harvested from humans or animals. If a library biased in favor of anti-TAT226 clones is desired, the subject is immunized with TAT226 to generate an antibody response, and spleen cells and/or circulating B cells other peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) are recovered for library construction. In a preferred embodiment, a human antibody gene fragment library biased in favor of anti-TAT226 clones is obtained by generating an anti-TAT226 antibody response in transgenic mice carrying a functional human immunoglobulin gene array (and lacking a functional endogenous antibody production system) such that TAT226 immunization gives rise to B cells producing human antibodies against TAT226. The generation of human antibody-producing transgenic mice is described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional enrichment for anti-TAT226 reactive cell populations can be obtained by using a suitable screening procedure to isolate B cells expressing TAT226-specific membrane bound antibody, e.g., by cell separation using TAT226 affinity chromatography or adsorption of cells to fluorochrome-labeled TAT226 followed by flow-activated cell sorting (FACS).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the use of spleen cells and/or B cells or other PBLs from an unimmunized donor provides a better representation of the possible antibody repertoire, and also permits the construction of an antibody library using any animal (human or non-human) species in which TAT226 is not antigenic. For libraries incorporating in vitro antibody gene construction, stem cells are harvested from the subject to provide nucleic acids encoding unrearranged antibody gene segments. The immune cells of interest can be obtained from a variety of animal species, such as human, mouse, rat, lagomorpha, luprine, canine, feline, porcine, bovine, equine, and avian species, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acid encoding antibody variable gene segments (including VH and VL segments) are recovered from the cells of interest and amplified. In the case of rearranged VH and VL gene libraries, the desired DNA can be obtained by isolating genomic DNA or mRNA from lymphocytes followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers matching the 5′ and 3′ ends of rearranged VH and VL genes as described in Orlandi et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci\n. (\nUSA\n), 86: 3833-3837 (1989), thereby making diverse V gene repertoires for expression. The V genes can be amplified from cDNA and genomic DNA, with back primers at the 5′ end of the exon encoding the mature V-domain and forward primers based within the J-segment as described in Orlandi et al. (1989) and in Ward et al., \nNature, \n341: 544-546 (1989). However, for amplifying from cDNA, back primers can also be based in the leader exon as described in Jones et al., \nBiotechnol., \n9: 88-89 (1991), and forward primers within the constant region as described in Sastry et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci\n. (\nUSA\n), 86: 5728-5732 (1989). To maximize complementarity, degeneracy can be incorporated in the primers as described in Orlandi et al. (1989) or Sastry et al. (1989). In certain embodiments, library diversity is maximized by using PCR primers targeted to each V-gene family in order to amplify all available VH and VL arrangements present in the immune cell nucleic acid sample, e.g. as described in the method of Marks et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol., \n222: 581-597 (1991) or as described in the method of Orum et al., \nNucleic Acids Res.; \n21: 4491-4498 (1993). For cloning of the amplified DNA into expression vectors, rare restriction sites can be introduced within the PCR primer as a tag at one end as described in Orlandi et al. (1989), or by further PCR amplification with a tagged primer as described in Clackson et al., \nNature, \n352: 624-628 (1991). Repertoires of synthetically rearranged V genes can be derived in vitro from V gene segments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMost of the human VH-gene segments have been cloned and sequenced (reported in Tomlinson et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol., \n227: 776-798 (1992)), and mapped (reported in Matsuda et al., \nNature Genet., \n3: 88-94 (1993); these cloned segments (including all the major conformations of the H1 and H2 loop) can be used to generate diverse VH gene repertoires with PCR primers encoding H3 loops of diverse sequence and length as described in Hoogenboom and Winter, \nJ. Mol. Biol., \n227: 381-388 (1992). VH repertoires can also be made with all the sequence diversity focused in a long H3 loop of a single length as described in Barbas et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, \n89: 4457-4461 (1992). Human Vκ and Vλ segments have been cloned and sequenced (reported in Williams and Winter, \nEur. J. Immunol., \n23: 1456-1461 (1993)) and can be used to make synthetic light chain repertoires. Synthetic V gene repertoires, based on a range of VH and VL folds, and L3 and H3 lengths, will encode antibodies of considerable structural diversity. Following amplification of V-gene encoding DNAs, germline V-gene segments can be rearranged in vitro according to the methods of Hoogenboom and Winter, \nJ. Mol. Biol., \n227: 381-388 (1992).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRepertoires of antibody fragments can be constructed by combining VH and VL gene repertoires together in several ways. Each repertoire can be created in different vectors, and the vectors recombined in vitro, e.g., as described in Hogrefe et al., \nGene, \n128: 119-126 (1993), or in vivo by combinatorial infection, e.g., the loxP system described in Waterhouse et al., \nNucl. Acids Res., \n21: 2265-2266 (1993). The in vivo recombination approach exploits the two-chain nature of Fab fragments to overcome the limit on library size imposed by \nE. coli \ntransformation efficiency. Naive VH and VL repertoires are cloned separately, one into a phagemid and the other into a phage vector. The two libraries are then combined by phage infection of phagemid-containing bacteria so that each cell contains a different combination and the library size is limited only by the number of cells present (about 10\n12 \nclones). Both vectors contain in vivo recombination signals so that the VH and VL genes are recombined onto a single replicon and are co-packaged into phage virions. These huge libraries provide large numbers of diverse antibodies of good affinity (K\nd\n \n−1 \nof about 10\n−8 \nM).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the repertoires may be cloned sequentially into the same vector, e.g. as described in Barbas et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, \n88: 7978-7982 (1991), or assembled together by PCR and then cloned, e.g. as described in Clackson et al., \nNature, \n352: 624-628 (1991). PCR assembly can also be used to join VH and VL DNAs with DNA encoding a flexible peptide spacer to form single chain Fv (scFv) repertoires. In yet another technique, “in cell PCR assembly” is used to combine VH and VL genes within lymphocytes by PCR and then clone repertoires of linked genes as described in Embleton et al., \nNucl. Acids Res., \n20: 3831-3837 (1992).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies produced by naive libraries (either natural or synthetic) can be of moderate affinity (K\nd\n \n−1 \nof about 10\n6 \nto 10\n7\nM\n−1\n), but affinity maturation can also be mimicked in vitro by constructing and reselecting from secondary libraries as described in Winter et al. (1994), supra. For example, mutation can be introduced at random in vitro by using error-prone polymerase (reported in Leung et al., \nTechnique, \n1: 11-15 (1989)) in the method of Hawkins et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol., \n226: 889-896 (1992) or in the method of Gram et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA, \n89: 3576-3580 (1992). Additionally, affinity maturation can be performed by randomly mutating one or more CDRs, e.g. using PCR with primers carrying random sequence spanning the CDR of interest, in selected individual Fv clones and screening for higher affinity clones. WO 9607754 (published 14 Mar. 1996) described a method for inducing mutagenesis in a complementarity determining region of an immunoglobulin light chain to create a library of light chain genes. Another effective approach is to recombine the VH or VL domains selected by phage display with repertoires of naturally occurring V domain variants obtained from unimmunized donors and screen for higher affinity in several rounds of chain reshuffling as described in Marks et al., \nBiotechnol., \n10: 779-783 (1992). This technique allows the production of antibodies and antibody fragments with affinities of about 10\n−9\nM or less.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nScreening of the libraries can be accomplished by various techniques known in the art. For example, TAT226 can be used to coat the wells of adsorption plates, expressed on host cells affixed to adsorption plates or used in cell sorting, or conjugated to biotin for capture with streptavidin-coated beads, or used in any other method for panning phage display libraries.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phage library samples are contacted with immobilized TAT226 under conditions suitable for binding at least a portion of the phage particles with the adsorbent. Normally, the conditions, including pH, ionic strength, temperature and the like are selected to mimic physiological conditions. The phages bound to the solid phase are washed and then eluted by acid, e.g. as described in Barbas et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA, \n88: 7978-7982 (1991), or by alkali, e.g. as described in Marks et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol., \n222: 581-597 (1991), or by TAT226 antigen competition, e.g. in a procedure similar to the antigen competition method of Clackson et al., \nNature, \n352: 624-628 (1991). Phages can be enriched 20-1,000-fold in a single round of selection. Moreover, the enriched phages can be grown in bacterial culture and subjected to further rounds of selection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe efficiency of selection depends on many factors, including the kinetics of dissociation during washing, and whether multiple antibody fragments on a single phage can simultaneously engage with antigen. Antibodies with fast dissociation kinetics (and weak binding affinities) can be retained by use of short washes, multivalent phage display and high coating density of antigen in solid phase. The high density not only stabilizes the phage through multivalent interactions, but favors rebinding of phage that has dissociated. The selection of antibodies with slow dissociation kinetics (and good binding affinities) can be promoted by use of long washes and monovalent phage display as described in Bass et al., \nProteins, \n8: 309-314 (1990) and in WO 92/09690, and a low coating density of antigen as described in Marks et al., \nBiotechnol., \n10: 779-783 (1992).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is possible to select between phage antibodies of different affinities, even with affinities that differ slightly, for TAT226. However, random mutation of a selected antibody (e.g. as performed in some affinity maturation techniques) is likely to give rise to many mutants, most binding to antigen, and a few with higher affinity. With limiting TAT226, rare high affinity phage could be competed out. To retain all higher affinity mutants, phages can be incubated with excess biotinylated TAT226, but with the biotinylated TAT226 at a concentration of lower molarity than the target molar affinity constant for TAT226. The high affinity-binding phages can then be captured by streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads. Such “equilibrium capture” allows the antibodies to be selected according to their affinities of binding, with sensitivity that permits isolation of mutant clones with as little as two-fold higher affinity from a great excess of phages with lower affinity. Conditions used in washing phages bound to a solid phase can also be manipulated to discriminate on the basis of dissociation kinetics.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-TAT226 clones may be selected based on activity. In certain embodiments, the invention provides anti-TAT226 antibodies that bind to living cells that naturally express TAT226. In one embodiment, the invention provides anti-TAT226 antibodies that block the binding between a TAT226 ligand and TAT226, but do not block the binding between a TAT226 ligand and a second protein. Fv clones corresponding to such anti-TAT226 antibodies can be selected by (1) isolating anti-TAT226 clones from a phage library as described above, and optionally amplifying the isolated population of phage clones by growing up the population in a suitable bacterial host; (2) selecting TAT226 and a second protein against which blocking and non-blocking activity, respectively, is desired; (3) adsorbing the anti-TAT226 phage clones to immobilized TAT226; (4) using an excess of the second protein to elute any undesired clones that recognize TAT226-binding determinants which overlap or are shared with the binding determinants of the second protein; and (5) eluting the clones which remain adsorbed following step (4). Optionally, clones with the desired blocking/non-blocking properties can be further enriched by repeating the selection procedures described herein one or more times.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDNA encoding hybridoma-derived monoclonal antibodies or phage display Fv clones of the invention is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g. by using oligonucleotide primers designed to specifically amplify the heavy and light chain coding regions of interest from hybridoma or phage DNA template). Once isolated, the DNA can be placed into expression vectors, which are then transfected into host cells such as \nE. coli \ncells, simian COS cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein, to obtain the synthesis of the desired monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells. Review articles on recombinant expression in bacteria of antibody-encoding DNA include Skerra et al., \nCurr. Opinion in Immunol., \n5: 256 (1993) and Pluckthun, \nImmunol. Revs, \n130: 151 (1992).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDNA encoding the Fv clones of the invention can be combined with known DNA sequences encoding heavy chain and/or light chain constant regions (e.g. the appropriate DNA sequences can be obtained from Kabat et al., supra) to form clones encoding full or partial length heavy and/or light chains. It will be appreciated that constant regions of any isotype can be used for this purpose, including IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, and IgE constant regions, and that such constant regions can be obtained from any human or animal species. An Fv clone derived from the variable domain DNA of one animal (such as human) species and then fused to constant region DNA of another animal species to form coding sequence(s) for “hybrid,” full length heavy chain and/or light chain is included in the definition of “chimeric” and “hybrid” antibody as used herein. In certain embodiments, an Fv clone derived from human variable DNA is fused to human constant region DNA to form coding sequence(s) for full- or partial-length human heavy and/or light chains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDNA encoding anti-TAT226 antibody derived from a hybridoma of the invention can also be modified, for example, by substituting the coding sequence for human heavy- and light-chain constant domains in place of homologous murine sequences derived from the hybridoma clone (e.g. as in the method of Morrison et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, \n81: 6851-6855 (1984)). DNA encoding a hybridoma- or Fv clone-derived antibody or fragment can be further modified by covalently joining to the immunoglobulin coding sequence all or part of the coding sequence for a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide. In this manner, “chimeric” or “hybrid” antibodies are prepared that have the binding specificity of the Fv clone or hybridoma clone-derived antibodies of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n3. Vectors, Host Cells, and Recombinant Methods\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor recombinant production of an antibody of the invention, the nucleic acid encoding it is isolated and inserted into a replicable vector for further cloning (amplification of the DNA) or for expression. DNA encoding the antibody is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the antibody). Many vectors are available. The choice of vector depends in part on the host cell to be used. Generally, host cells are of either prokaryotic or eukaryotic (generally mammalian) origin. It will be appreciated that constant regions of any isotype can be used for this purpose, including IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, and IgE constant regions, and that such constant regions can be obtained from any human, or animal species.\n\n\n \n \n \n \na) Generating Antibodies Using Prokaryotic Host Cells:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(1) Vector Construction\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolynucleotide sequences encoding polypeptide components of the antibody of the invention can be obtained using standard recombinant techniques. Desired polynucleotide sequences may be isolated and sequenced from antibody producing cells such as hybridoma cells. Alternatively, polynucleotides can be synthesized using nucleotide synthesizer or PCR techniques. Once obtained, sequences encoding the polypeptides are inserted into a recombinant vector capable of replicating and expressing heterologous polynucleotides in prokaryotic hosts. Many vectors that are available and known in the art can be used for the purpose of the present invention. Selection of an appropriate vector will depend mainly on the size of the nucleic acids to be inserted into the vector and the particular host cell to be transformed with the vector. Each vector contains various components, depending on its function (amplification or expression of heterologous polynucleotide, or both) and its compatibility with the particular host cell in which it resides. The vector components generally include, but are not limited to: an origin of replication, a selection marker gene, a promoter, a ribosome binding site (RBS), a signal sequence, the heterologous nucleic acid insert and a transcription termination sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, plasmid vectors containing replicon and control sequences which are derived from species compatible with the host cell are used in connection with these hosts. The vector ordinarily carries a replication site, as well as marking sequences which are capable of providing phenotypic selection in transformed cells. For example, \nE. coli \nis typically transformed using pBR322, a plasmid derived from an \nE. coli \nspecies. pBR322 contains genes encoding ampicillin (Amp) and tetracycline (Tet) resistance and thus provides easy means for identifying transformed cells. pBR322, its derivatives, or other microbial plasmids or bacteriophage may also contain, or be modified to contain, promoters which can be used by the microbial organism for expression of endogenous proteins. Examples of pBR322 derivatives used for expression of particular antibodies are described in detail in Carter et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,648,237.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, phage vectors containing replicon and control sequences that are compatible with the host microorganism can be used as transforming vectors in connection with these hosts. For example, bacteriophage such as λGEM.TM.-11 may be utilized in making a recombinant vector which can be used to transform susceptible host cells such as \nE. coli \nLE392.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe expression vector of the invention may comprise two or more promoter-cistron pairs, encoding each of the polypeptide components. A promoter is an untranslated regulatory sequence located upstream (5′) to a cistron that modulates its expression. Prokaryotic promoters typically fall into two classes, inducible and constitutive. Inducible promoter is a promoter that initiates increased levels of transcription of the cistron under its control in response to changes in the culture condition, e.g. the presence or absence of a nutrient or a change in temperature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA large number of promoters recognized by a variety of potential host cells are well known. The selected promoter can be operably linked to cistron DNA encoding the light or heavy chain by removing the promoter from the source DNA via restriction enzyme digestion and inserting the isolated promoter sequence into the vector of the invention. Both the native promoter sequence and many heterologous promoters may be used to direct amplification and/or expression of the target genes. In some embodiments, heterologous promoters are utilized, as they generally permit greater transcription and higher yields of expressed target gene as compared to the native target polypeptide promoter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPromoters suitable for use with prokaryotic hosts include the PhoA promoter, the β-galactamase and lactose promoter systems, a tryptophan (trp) promoter system and hybrid promoters such as the tac or the trc promoter. However, other promoters that are functional in bacteria (such as other known bacterial or phage promoters) are suitable as well. Their nucleotide sequences have been published, thereby enabling a skilled worker operably to ligate them to cistrons encoding the target light and heavy chains (Siebenlist et al. (1980) \nCell \n20: 269) using linkers or adaptors to supply any required restriction sites.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect of the invention, each cistron within the recombinant vector comprises a secretion signal sequence component that directs translocation of the expressed polypeptides across a membrane. In general, the signal sequence may be a component of the vector, or it may be a part of the target polypeptide DNA that is inserted into the vector. The signal sequence selected for the purpose of this invention should be one that is recognized and processed (i.e. cleaved by a signal peptidase) by the host cell. For prokaryotic host cells that do not recognize and process the signal sequences native to the heterologous polypeptides, the signal sequence is substituted by a prokaryotic signal sequence selected, for example, from the group consisting of the alkaline phosphatase, penicillinase, Ipp, or heat-stable enterotoxin II (STII) leaders, LamB, PhoE, PelB, OmpA and MBP. In one embodiment of the invention, the signal sequences used in both cistrons of the expression system are STII signal sequences or variants thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the production of the immunoglobulins according to the invention can occur in the cytoplasm of the host cell, and therefore does not require the presence of secretion signal sequences within each cistron. In that regard, immunoglobulin light and heavy chains are expressed, folded and assembled to form functional immunoglobulins within the cytoplasm. Certain host strains (e.g., the \nE. coli \ntrxB-strains) provide cytoplasm conditions that are favorable for disulfide bond formation, thereby permitting proper folding and assembly of expressed protein subunits. Proba and Pluckthun \nGene, \n159:203 (1995).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies of the invention can also be produced by using an expression system in which the quantitative ratio of expressed polypeptide components can be modulated in order to maximize the yield of secreted and properly assembled antibodies of the invention. Such modulation is accomplished at least in part by simultaneously modulating translational strengths for the polypeptide components.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne technique for modulating translational strength is disclosed in Simmons et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,840,523. It utilizes variants of the translational initiation region (TIR) within a cistron. For a given TIR, a series of amino acid or nucleic acid sequence variants can be created with a range of translational strengths, thereby providing a convenient means by which to adjust this factor for the desired expression level of the specific chain. TIR variants can be generated by conventional mutagenesis techniques that result in codon changes which can alter the amino acid sequence. In certain embodiments, changes in the nucleotide sequence are silent. Alterations in the TIR can include, for example, alterations in the number or spacing of Shine-Dalgarno sequences, along with alterations in the signal sequence. One method for generating mutant signal sequences is the generation of a “codon bank” at the beginning of a coding sequence that does not change the amino acid sequence of the signal sequence (i.e., the changes are silent). This can be accomplished by changing the third nucleotide position of each codon; additionally, some amino acids, such as leucine, serine, and arginine, have multiple first and second positions that can add complexity in making the bank. This method of mutagenesis is described in detail in Yansura et al. (1992) \nMETHODS: A Companion to Methods in Enzymol. \n4:151-158.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, a set of vectors is generated with a range of TIR strengths for each cistron therein. This limited set provides a comparison of expression levels of each chain as well as the yield of the desired antibody products under various TIR strength combinations. TIR strengths can be determined by quantifying the expression level of a reporter gene as described in detail in Simmons et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,840,523. Based on the translational strength comparison, the desired individual TIRs are selected to be combined in the expression vector constructs of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProkaryotic host cells suitable for expressing antibodies of the invention include Archaebacteria and Eubacteria, such as Gram-negative or Gram-positive organisms. Examples of useful bacteria include \nEscherichia \n(e.g., \nE. coli\n), Bacilli (e.g., \nB. subtilis\n), Enterobacteria, \nPseudomonas \nspecies (e.g., \nP. aeruginosa\n), \nSalmonella typhimurium, Serratia marcescans, Klebsiella, Proteus, Shigella, Rhizobia, Vitreoscilla\n, or \nParacoccus\n. In one embodiment, gram-negative cells are used. In one embodiment, \nE. coli \ncells are used as hosts for the invention. Examples of \nE. coli \nstrains include strain W3110 (Bachmann, Cellular and Molecular Biology, vol. 2 (Washington, D.C.: American Society for Microbiology, 1987), pp. 1190-1219; ATCC Deposit No. 27,325) and derivatives thereof, including strain 33D3 having genotype W3110 ΔfhuA (ΔtonA) ptr3 lac Iq lacL8 ΔompTΔ(nmpc-fepE) degP41 kanR (U.S. Pat. No. 5,639,635). Other strains and derivatives thereof, such as \nE. coli \n294 (ATCC 31,446), \nE. coli \nB, \nE. coli\nλ 1776 (ATCC 31,537) and \nE. coli \nRV308 (ATCC 31,608) are also suitable. These examples are illustrative rather than limiting. Methods for constructing derivatives of any of the above-mentioned bacteria having defined genotypes are known in the art and described in, for example, Bass et al., Proteins, 8:309-314 (1990). It is generally necessary to select the appropriate bacteria taking into consideration replicability of the replicon in the cells of a bacterium. For example, \nE. coli, Serratia\n, or \nSalmonella \nspecies can be suitably used as the host when well known plasmids such as pBR322, pBR325, pACYC177, or pKN410 are used to supply the replicon. Typically the host cell should secrete minimal amounts of proteolytic enzymes, and additional protease inhibitors may desirably be incorporated in the cell culture.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(2) Antibody Production\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHost cells are transformed with the above-described expression vectors and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters, selecting transformants, or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTransformation means introducing DNA into the prokaryotic host so that the DNA is replicable, either as an extrachromosomal element or by chromosomal integrant. Depending on the host cell used, transformation is done using standard techniques appropriate to such cells. The calcium treatment employing calcium chloride is generally used for bacterial cells that contain substantial cell-wall barriers. Another method for transformation employs polyethylene glycol/DMSO. Yet another technique used is electroporation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProkaryotic cells used to produce the polypeptides of the invention are grown in media known in the art and suitable for culture of the selected host cells. Examples of suitable media include luria broth (LB) plus necessary nutrient supplements. In some embodiments, the media also contains a selection agent, chosen based on the construction of the expression vector, to selectively permit growth of prokaryotic cells containing the expression vector. For example, ampicillin is added to media for growth of cells expressing ampicillin resistant gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny necessary supplements besides carbon, nitrogen, and inorganic phosphate sources may also be included at appropriate concentrations introduced alone or as a mixture with another supplement or medium such as a complex nitrogen source. Optionally the culture medium may contain one or more reducing agents selected from the group consisting of glutathione, cysteine, cystamine, thioglycollate, dithioerythritol and dithiothreitol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe prokaryotic host cells are cultured at suitable temperatures. In certain embodiments, for \nE. coli \ngrowth, growth temperatures range from about 20° C. to about 39° C.; from about 25° C. to about 37° C.; or about 30° C. The pH of the medium may be any pH ranging from about 5 to about 9, depending mainly on the host organism. In certain embodiments, for \nE. coli\n, the pH is from about 6.8 to about 7.4, or about 7.0.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf an inducible promoter is used in the expression vector of the invention, protein expression is induced under conditions suitable for the activation of the promoter. In one aspect of the invention, PhoA promoters are used for controlling transcription of the polypeptides. Accordingly, the transformed host cells are cultured in a phosphate-limiting medium for induction. In certain embodiments, the phosphate-limiting medium is the C.R.A.P. medium (see, e.g., Simmons et al., J. Immunol. Methods (2002), 263:133-147). A variety of other inducers may be used, according to the vector construct employed, as is known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the expressed polypeptides of the present invention are secreted into and recovered from the periplasm of the host cells. Protein recovery typically involves disrupting the microorganism, generally by such means as osmotic shock, sonication or lysis. Once cells are disrupted, cell debris or whole cells may be removed by centrifugation or filtration. The proteins may be further purified, for example, by affinity resin chromatography. Alternatively, proteins can be transported into the culture media and isolated therein. Cells may be removed from the culture and the culture supernatant being filtered and concentrated for further purification of the proteins produced. The expressed polypeptides can be further isolated and identified using commonly known methods such as polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and Western blot assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect of the invention, antibody production is conducted in large quantity by a fermentation process. Various large-scale fed-batch fermentation procedures are available for production of recombinant proteins. Large-scale fermentations have at least 1000 liters of capacity, and in certain embodiments, about 1,000 to 100,000 liters of capacity. These fermentors use agitator impellers to distribute oxygen and nutrients, especially glucose (the preferred carbon/energy source). Small scale fermentation refers generally to fermentation in a fermentor that is no more than approximately 100 liters in volumetric capacity, and can range from about 1 liter to about 100 liters.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a fermentation process, induction of protein expression is typically initiated after the cells have been grown under suitable conditions to a desired density, e.g., an OD550 of about 180-220, at which stage the cells are in the early stationary phase. A variety of inducers may be used, according to the vector construct employed, as is known in the art and described above. Cells may be grown for shorter periods prior to induction. Cells are usually induced for about 12-50 hours, although longer or shorter induction time may be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo improve the production yield and quality of the polypeptides of the invention, various fermentation conditions can be modified. For example, to improve the proper assembly and folding of the secreted antibody polypeptides, additional vectors overexpressing chaperone proteins, such as Dsb proteins (DsbA, DsbB, DsbC, DsbD and or DsbG) or FkpA (a peptidylprolyl cis,trans-isomerase with chaperone activity) can be used to co-transform the host prokaryotic cells. The chaperone proteins have been demonstrated to facilitate the proper folding and solubility of heterologous proteins produced in bacterial host cells. Chen et al. (1999) \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n274:19601-19605; Georgiou et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,083,715; Georgiou et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,027,888; Bothmann and Pluckthun (2000) \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n275:17100-17105; Ramm and Pluckthun (2000) \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n275:17106-17113; Arie et al. (2001) Mol. Microbiol. 39:199-210.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo minimize proteolysis of expressed heterologous proteins (especially those that are proteolytically sensitive), certain host strains deficient for proteolytic enzymes can be used for the present invention. For example, host cell strains may be modified to effect genetic mutation(s) in the genes encoding known bacterial proteases such as Protease III, OmpT, DegP, Tsp, Protease I, Protease Mi, Protease V, Protease VI and combinations thereof. Some \nE. coli \nprotease-deficient strains are available and described in, for example, Joly et al. (1998), supra; Georgiou et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,264,365; Georgiou et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,508,192; Hara et al., \nMicrobial Drug Resistance, \n2:63-72 (1996).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, \nE. coli \nstrains deficient for proteolytic enzymes and transformed with plasmids overexpressing one or more chaperone proteins are used as host cells in the expression system of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(3) Antibody Purification\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the antibody protein produced herein is further purified to obtain preparations that are substantially homogeneous for further assays and uses. Standard protein purification methods known in the art can be employed. The following procedures are exemplary of suitable purification procedures: fractionation on immunoaffinity or ion-exchange columns, ethanol precipitation, reverse phase HPLC, chromatography on silica or on a cation-exchange resin such as DEAE, chromatofocusing, SDS-PAGE, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and gel filtration using, for example, Sephadex G-75.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, Protein A immobilized on a solid phase is used for immunoaffinity purification of the antibody products of the invention. Protein A is a 41 kD cell wall protein from \nStaphylococcus aureas \nwhich binds with a high affinity to the Fc region of antibodies. Lindmark et al (1983). \nJ. Immunol. Meth. \n62:1-13. The solid phase to which Protein A is immobilized can be a column comprising a glass or silica surface, or a controlled pore glass column or a silicic acid column. In some applications, the column is coated with a reagent, such as glycerol, to possibly prevent nonspecific adherence of contaminants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs the first step of purification, a preparation derived from the cell culture as described above can be applied onto a Protein A immobilized solid phase to allow specific binding of the antibody of interest to Protein A. The solid phase would then be washed to remove contaminants non-specifically bound to the solid phase. Finally the antibody of interest is recovered from the solid phase by elution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nb) Generating Antibodies Using Eukaryotic Host Cells:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA vector for use in a eukaryotic host cell generally includes one or more of the following non-limiting components: a signal sequence, an origin of replication, one or more marker genes, an enhancer element, a promoter, and a transcription termination sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(1) Signal Sequence Component\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA vector for use in a eukaryotic host cell may also contain a signal sequence or other polypeptide having a specific cleavage site at the N-terminus of the mature protein or polypeptide of interest. The heterologous signal sequence selected may be one that is recognized and processed (i.e., cleaved by a signal peptidase) by the host cell. In mammalian cell expression, mammalian signal sequences as well as viral secretory leaders, for example, the herpes simplex gD signal, are available. The DNA for such a precursor region is ligated in reading frame to DNA encoding the antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(2) Origin of Replication\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, an origin of replication component is not needed for mammalian expression vectors. For example, the SV40 origin may typically be used only because it contains the early promoter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(3) Selection Gene Component\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExpression and cloning vectors may contain a selection gene, also termed a selectable marker. Typical selection genes encode proteins that (a) confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins, e.g., ampicillin, neomycin, methotrexate, or tetracycline, (b) complement auxotrophic deficiencies, where relevant, or (c) supply critical nutrients not available from complex media.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne example of a selection scheme utilizes a drug to arrest growth of a host cell. Those cells that are successfully transformed with a heterologous gene produce a protein conferring drug resistance and thus survive the selection regimen. Examples of such dominant selection use the drugs neomycin, mycophenolic acid and hygromycin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother example of suitable selectable markers for mammalian cells are those that enable the identification of cells competent to take up the antibody nucleic acid, such as DHFR, thymidine kinase, metallothionein-I and -II, preferably primate metallothionein genes, adenosine deaminase, ornithine decarboxylase, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, in some embodiments, cells transformed with the DHFR selection gene are first identified by culturing all of the transformants in a culture medium that contains methotrexate (Mtx), a competitive antagonist of DHFR. In some embodiments, an appropriate host cell when wild-type DHFR is employed is the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line deficient in DHFR activity (e.g., ATCC CRL-9096).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, host cells (particularly wild-type hosts that contain endogenous DHFR) transformed or co-transformed with DNA sequences encoding an antibody, wild-type DHFR protein, and another selectable marker such as \naminoglycoside\n 3′-phosphotransferase (APH) can be selected by cell growth in medium containing a selection agent for the selectable marker such as an aminoglycosidic antibiotic, e.g., kanamycin, neomycin, or G418. See U.S. Pat. No. 4,965,199.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(4) Promoter Component\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExpression and cloning vectors usually contain a promoter that is recognized by the host organism and is operably linked to nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide of interest (e.g., an antibody). Promoter sequences are known for eukaryotes. For example, virtually all eukaryotic genes have an AT-rich region located approximately 25 to 30 bases upstream from the site where transcription is initiated. Another sequence found 70 to 80 bases upstream from the start of transcription of many genes is a CNCAAT region where N may be any nucleotide. At the 3′ end of most eukaryotic genes is an AATAAA sequence that may be the signal for addition of the poly A tail to the 3′ end of the coding sequence. In certain embodiments, any or all of these sequences may be suitably inserted into eukaryotic expression vectors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTranscription from vectors in mammalian host cells is controlled, for example, by promoters obtained from the genomes of viruses such as polyoma virus, fowlpox virus, adenovirus (such as Adenovirus 2), bovine papilloma virus, avian sarcoma virus, cytomegalovirus, a retrovirus, hepatitis-B virus and Simian Virus 40 (SV40), from heterologous mammalian promoters, e.g., the actin promoter or an immunoglobulin promoter, from heat-shock promoters, provided such promoters are compatible with the host cell systems.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe early and late promoters of the SV40 virus are conveniently obtained as an SV40 restriction fragment that also contains the SV40 viral origin of replication. The immediate early promoter of the human cytomegalovirus is conveniently obtained as a Hindi E restriction fragment. A system for expressing DNA in mammalian hosts using the bovine papilloma virus as a vector is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,419,446. A modification of this system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,601,978. See also Reyes et al., \nNature \n297:598-601 (1982), describing expression of human β-interferon cDNA in mouse cells under the control of a thymidine kinase promoter from herpes simplex virus. Alternatively, the Rous Sarcoma Virus long terminal repeat can be used as the promoter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(5) Enhancer Element Component\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTranscription of DNA encoding an antibody of this invention by higher eukaryotes is often increased by inserting an enhancer sequence into the vector. Many enhancer sequences are now known from mammalian genes (globin, elastase, albumin, α-fetoprotein, and insulin). Typically, however, one will use an enhancer from a eukaryotic cell virus. Examples include the SV40 enhancer on the late side of the replication origin (bp 100-270), the cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer, the polyoma enhancer on the late side of the replication origin, and adenovirus enhancers. See also Yaniv, \nNature \n297:17-18 (1982) describing enhancer elements for activation of eukaryotic promoters. The enhancer may be spliced into the vector at a \nposition\n 5′ or 3′ to the antibody polypeptide-encoding sequence, but is generally located at a \nsite\n 5′ from the promoter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(6) Transcription Termination Component\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExpression vectors used in eukaryotic host cells may also contain sequences necessary for the termination of transcription and for stabilizing the mRNA. Such sequences are commonly available from the 5′ and, occasionally 3′, untranslated regions of eukaryotic or viral DNAs or cDNAs. These regions contain nucleotide segments transcribed as polyadenylated fragments in the untranslated portion of the mRNA encoding an antibody. One useful transcription termination component is the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation region. See WO94/11026 and the expression vector disclosed therein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(7) Selection and Transformation of Host Cells\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable host cells for cloning or expressing the DNA in the vectors herein include higher eukaryote cells described herein, including vertebrate host cells. Propagation of vertebrate cells in culture (tissue culture) has become a routine procedure. Examples of useful mammalian host cell lines are monkey kidney CV1 line transformed by SV40 (COS-7, ATCC CRL 1651); human embryonic kidney line (293 or 293 cells subcloned for growth in suspension culture, Graham et al., \nJ. Gen Virol. \n36:59 (1977)); baby hamster kidney cells (BHK, ATCC CCL 10); Chinese hamster ovary cells/−DHFR (CHO, Urlaub et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n77:4216 (1980)); mouse sertoli cells (TM4, Mather, \nBiol. Reprod. \n23:243-251 (1980)); monkey kidney cells (CV1 ATCC CCL 70); African green monkey kidney cells (VERO-76, ATCC CRL-1587); human cervical carcinoma cells (HELA, ATCC CCL 2); canine kidney cells (MDCK, ATCC CCL 34); buffalo rat liver cells (BRL 3A, ATCC CRL 1442); human lung cells (W138, ATCC CCL 75); human liver cells (Hep G2, HB 8065); mouse mammary tumor (MMT 060562, ATCC CCL51); TRI cells (Mather et al., \nAnnals N.Y. Acad. Sci. \n383:44-68 (1982)); \nMRC\n 5 cells; FS4 cells; and a human hepatoma line (Hep G2).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHost cells are transformed with the above-described expression or cloning vectors for antibody production and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters, selecting transformants, or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(8) Culturing the Host Cells\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe host cells used to produce an antibody of this invention may be cultured in a variety of media. Commercially available media such as Ham's F10 (Sigma), Minimal Essential Medium ((MEM), (Sigma), RPMI-1640 (Sigma), and Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium ((DMEM), Sigma) are suitable for culturing the host cells. In addition, any of the media described in Ham et al., \nMeth. Enz. \n58:44 (1979), Barnes et al., \nAnal. Biochem. \n102:255 (1980), U.S. Pat. No. 4,767,704; 4,657,866; 4,927,762; 4,560,655; or 5,122,469; WO 90/03430; WO 87/00195; or U.S. Pat. Re. 30,985 may be used as culture media for the host cells. Any of these media may be supplemented as necessary with hormones and/or other growth factors (such as insulin, transferrin, or epidermal growth factor), salts (such as sodium chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate), buffers (such as HEPES), nucleotides (such as adenosine and thymidine), antibiotics (such as GENTAMYCIN™ drug), trace elements (defined as inorganic compounds usually present at final concentrations in the micromolar range), and glucose or an equivalent energy source. Any other supplements may also be included at appropriate concentrations that would be known to those skilled in the art. The culture conditions, such as temperature, pH, and the like, are those previously used with the host cell selected for expression, and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(9) Purification of Antibody\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen using recombinant techniques, the antibody can be produced intracellularly, or directly secreted into the medium. If the antibody is produced intracellularly, as a first step, the particulate debris, either host cells or lysed fragments, may be removed, for example, by centrifugation or ultrafiltration. Where the antibody is secreted into the medium, supernatants from such expression systems may be first concentrated using a commercially available protein concentration filter, for example, an Amicon or Millipore Pellicon ultrafiltration unit. A protease inhibitor such as PMSF may be included in any of the foregoing steps to inhibit proteolysis, and antibiotics may be included to prevent the growth of adventitious contaminants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibody composition prepared from the cells can be purified using, for example, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, and affinity chromatography, with affinity chromatography being a convenient technique. The suitability of protein A as an affinity ligand depends on the species and isotype of any immunoglobulin Fc domain that is present in the antibody. Protein A can be used to purify antibodies that are based on human γ1, γ2, or γ4 heavy chains (Lindmark et al., \nJ. Immunol. Methods \n62:1-13 (1983)). Protein G is recommended for all mouse isotypes and for human γ3 (Guss et al., EMBO J. 5:15671575 (1986)). The matrix to which the affinity ligand is attached may be agarose, but other matrices are available. Mechanically stable matrices such as controlled pore glass or poly(styrenedivinyl)benzene allow for faster flow rates and shorter processing times than can be achieved with agarose. Where the antibody comprises a CH3 domain, the Bakerbond ABX™ resin (J. T. Baker, Phillipsburg, N.J.) is useful for purification. Other techniques for protein purification such as fractionation on an ion-exchange column, ethanol precipitation, Reverse Phase HPLC, chromatography on silica, chromatography on heparin SEPHAROSE™ chromatography on an anion or cation exchange resin (such as a polyaspartic acid column), chromatofocusing, SDS-PAGE, and ammonium sulfate precipitation are also available depending on the antibody to be recovered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing any preliminary purification step(s), the mixture comprising the antibody of interest and contaminants may be subjected to further purification, for example, by low pH hydrophobic interaction chromatography using an elution buffer at a pH between about 2.5-4.5, preferably performed at low salt concentrations (e.g., from about 0-0.25M salt).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, various methodologies for preparing antibodies for use in research, testing, and clinical use are well-established in the art, consistent with the above-described methodologies and/or as deemed appropriate by one skilled in the art for a particular antibody of interest.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nC. Immunoconjugates\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides immunoconjugates (interchangeably referred to as “antibody-drug conjugates,” or “ADCs”) comprising any of the anti-TAT226 antibodies of the invention conjugated to one or more cytotoxic agents, such as a chemotherapeutic agent, a drug, a growth inhibitory agent, a toxin (e.g., an enzymatically active toxin of bacterial, fungal, plant, or animal origin, or fragments thereof), or a radioactive isotope (i.e., a radioconjugate).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmunoconjugates may be used for the local delivery of cytotoxic agents, i.e., drugs that kill or inhibit the growth or proliferation of tumor cells, in the treatment of cancer (Syrigos and Epenetos (1999) \nAnticancer Research \n19:605-614; Niculescu-Duvaz and Springer (1997) \nAdv. Drug Deliv. Rev. \n26:151-172; U.S. Pat. No. 4,975,278). Immunoconjugates allow for the targeted delivery of a drug moiety to a tumor, and intracellular accumulation therein, where systemic administration of unconjugated drugs may result in unacceptable levels of toxicity to normal cells as well as the tumor cells sought to be eliminated (Baldwin et al., \nLancet \n(Mar. 15, 1986) pp. 603-05; Thorpe (1985) “Antibody Carriers Of Cytotoxic Agents In Cancer Therapy: A Review,” in \nMonoclonal Antibodies '\n84\n: Biological And Clinical Applications \n(A. Pinchera et al., eds) pp. 475-506. Both polyclonal antibodies and monoclonal antibodies have been reported as useful in these strategies (Rowland et al., (1986) \nCancer Immunol. Immunother. \n21:183-87). Drugs used in these methods include daunomycin, doxorubicin, methotrexate, and vindesine (Rowland et al., (1986) supra). Toxins used in antibody-toxin conjugates include bacterial toxins such as diphtheria toxin, plant toxins such as ricin, small molecule toxins such as geldanamycin (Mandler et al (2000) \nJ. of the Nat. Cancer Inst. \n92(19):1573-1581; Mandler et al (2000) \nBioorganic \n& \nMed. Chem. Letters \n10:1025-1028; Mandler et al (2002) \nBioconjugate Chem. \n13:786-791), maytansinoids (EP 1391213; Liu et al., (1996) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n93:8618-8623), and calicheamicin (Lode et al (1998) \nCancer Res. \n58:2928; Hinman et al (1993) \nCancer Res. \n53:3336-3342). The toxins may exert their cytotoxic effects by mechanisms including tubulin binding, DNA binding, or topoisomerase inhibition. Some cytotoxic drugs tend to be inactive or less active when conjugated to large antibodies or protein receptor ligands.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nZEVALIN® (ibritumomab tiuxetan, Biogen/Idec) is an antibody-radioisotope conjugate composed of a murine IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody directed against the CD20 antigen found on the surface of normal and malignant B lymphocytes and 111In or 90Y radioisotope bound by a thiourea linker-chelator (Wiseman et al (2000) \nEur. Jour. Nucl. Med. \n27(7):766-77; Wiseman et al (2002) \nBlood \n99(12):4336-42; Witzig et al (2002) \nJ. Clin. Oncol. \n20(10):2453-63; Witzig et al (2002) \nJ. Clin. Oncol. \n20(15):3262-69). Although ZFVALIN has activity against B-cell non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL), administration results in severe and prolonged cytopenias in most patients. MYLOTARG™ (gemtuzumab ozogamicin, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals), an antibody-drug conjugate composed of a hu CD33 antibody linked to calicheamicin, was approved in 2000 for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia by injection (Drugs of the Future (2000) 25(7):686; U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,970,198; 5,079,233; 5,585,089; 5,606,040; 5,693,762; 5,739,116; 5,767,285; 5,773,001). Cantuzumab mertansine (Immunogen, Inc.), an antibody-drug conjugate composed of the huC242 antibody linked via the disulfide linker SPP to the maytansinoid drug moiety, DM1, is advancing into Phase II trials for the treatment of cancers that express CanAg, such as colon, pancreatic, gastric, and others. MLN-2704 (Millennium Pharm., BZL Biologics, Immunogen Inc.), an antibody-drug conjugate composed of the anti-prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) monoclonal antibody linked to the maytansinoid drug moiety, DM1, is under development for the potential treatment of prostate tumors. The auristatin peptides, auristatin E (AE) and monomethylauristatin (MMAE), synthetic analogs of dolastatin, were conjugated to chimeric monoclonal antibodies cBR96 (specific to Lewis Y on carcinomas) and cAC10 (specific to CD30 on hematological malignancies) (Doronina et al (2003) \nNature Biotechnol. \n21(7):778-784) and are under therapeutic development.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, an immunoconjugate comprises an anti-TAT226 antibody and a chemotherapeutic agent or other toxin. Chemotherapeutic agents useful in the generation of immunoconjugates are described herein (e.g., above). Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof can also be used and are described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, an immunoconjugate comprises an anti-TAT226 antibody and one or more small molecule toxins, including, but not limited to, small molecule drugs such as a calicheamicin, maytansinoid, dolastatin, auristatin, trichothecene, and CC1065, and the derivatives of these drugs that have cytotoxic activity. Examples of such immunoconjugates are discussed in further detail below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n1. Exemplary Immunoconjugates\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn immunoconjugate (or “antibody-drug conjugate” (“ADC”)) of the invention may be of Formula I, below, wherein an anti-TAT226 antibody is conjugated (i.e., covalently attached) to one or more drug moieties (D) through an optional linker (L).\n\n\n \n \n \nAb-(L-D)\np\n  I\n\n\n\n \n \nAccordingly, the anti-TAT226 antibody may be conjugated to the drug either directly or via a linker. In Formula I, p is the average number of drug moieties per antibody, which can range, e.g., from about 1 to about 20 drug moieties per antibody, and in certain embodiments, from 1 to about 8 drug moieties per antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \na) Exemplary Linkers\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA linker may comprise one or more linker components. Exemplary linker components include 6-maleimidocaproyl (“MC”), maleimidopropanoyl (“MP”), valine-citrulline (“val-cit” or “vc”), alanine-phenylalanine (“ala-phe”), p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl (a “PAB”), N-Succinimidyl 4-(2-pyridylthio) pentanoate (“SPP”), N-succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1 carboxylate (“SMCC”), and N-Succinimidyl (4-iodo-acetyl)aminobenzoate (“SIAB”). Various linker components are known in the art, some of which are described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA linker may be a “cleavable linker,” facilitating release of a drug in the cell. For example, an acid-labile linker (e.g., hydrazone), protease-sensitive (e.g., peptidase-sensitive) linker, photolabile linker, dimethyl linker or disulfide-containing linker (Chari et al., Cancer Research 52:127-131 (1992); U.S. Pat. No. 5,208,020) may be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a linker component may comprise a “stretcher unit” that links an antibody to another linker component or to a drug moiety. Exemplary stretcher units are shown below (wherein the wavy line indicates sites of covalent attachment to an antibody):\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a linker component may comprise an amino acid unit. In one such embodiment, the amino acid unit allows for cleavage of the linker by a protease, thereby facilitating release of the drug from the immunoconjugate upon exposure to intracellular proteases, such as lysosomal enzymes. See, e.g., Doronina et al. (2003) \nNat. Biotechnol. \n21:778-784. Exemplary amino acid units include, but are not limited to, a dipeptide, a tripeptide, a tetrapeptide, and a pentapeptide. Exemplary dipeptides include: valine-citrulline (vc or val-cit), alanine-phenylalanine (af or ala-phe); phenylalanine-lysine (fk or phe-lys); or N-methyl-valine-citrulline (Me-val-cit). Exemplary tripeptides include: glycine-valine-citrulline (gly-val-cit) and glycine-glycine-glycine (gly-gly-gly). An amino acid unit may comprise amino acid residues that occur naturally, as well as minor amino acids and non-naturally occurring amino acid analogs, such as citrulline. Amino acid units can be designed and optimized in their selectivity for enzymatic cleavage by a particular enzyme, for example, a tumor-associated protease, cathepsin B, C and D, or a plasmin protease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a linker component may comprise a “spacer” unit that links the antibody to a drug moiety, either directly or by way of a stretcher unit and/or an amino acid unit. A spacer unit may be “self-immolative” or a “non-self-immolative.” A “non-self-immolative” spacer unit is one in which part or all of the spacer unit remains bound to the drug moiety upon enzymatic (e.g., proteolytic) cleavage of the ADC. Examples of non-self-immolative spacer units include, but are not limited to, a glycine spacer unit and a glycine-glycine spacer unit. Other combinations of peptidic spacers susceptible to sequence-specific enzymatic cleavage are also contemplated. For example, enzymatic cleavage of an ADC containing a glycine-glycine spacer unit by a tumor-cell associated protease would result in release of a glycine-glycine-drug moiety from the remainder of the ADC. In one such embodiment, the glycine-glycine-drug moiety is then subjected to a separate hydrolysis step in the tumor cell, thus cleaving the glycine-glycine spacer unit from the drug moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “self-immolative” spacer unit allows for release of the drug moiety without a separate hydrolysis step. In certain embodiments, a spacer unit of a linker comprises a p-aminobenzyl unit. In one such embodiment, a p-aminobenzyl alcohol is attached to an amino acid unit via an amide bond, and a carbamate, methylcarbamate, or carbonate is made between the benzyl alcohol and a cytotoxic agent. See, e.g., Hamann et al. (2005) \nExpert Opin. Ther. Patents \n(2005) 15:1087-1103. In one embodiment, the spacer unit is p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl (PAB). In certain embodiments, the phenylene portion of a p-amino benzyl unit is substituted with Qm, wherein Q is —C\n1\n-C\n8 \nalkyl, —O—(C\n1\n-C\n8 \nalkyl), -halogen, -nitro or -cyano; and m is an integer ranging from 0-4. Examples of self-immolative spacer units further include, but are not limited to, aromatic compounds that are electronically similar to p-aminobenzyl alcohol (see, e.g., US 2005/0256030 A1), such as 2-aminoimidazol-5-methanol derivatives (Hay et al. (1999) \nBioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. \n9:2237) and ortho- or para-aminobenzylacetals. Spacers can be used that undergo cyclization upon amide bond hydrolysis, such as substituted and unsubstituted 4-aminobutyric acid amides (Rodrigues et al., \nChemistry Biology, \n1995, 2, 223); appropriately substituted bicyclo[2.2.1] and bicyclo[2.2.2] ring systems (Storm, et al., \nJ. Amer. Chem. Soc., \n1972, 94, 5815); and 2-aminophenylpropionic acid amides (Amsberry, et al., \nJ. Org. Chem., \n1990, 55, 5867). Elimination of amine-containing drugs that are substituted at the a-position of glycine (Kingsbury, et al., \nJ. Med. Chem., \n1984, 27, 1447) are also examples of self-immolative spacers useful in ADCs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, a spacer unit is a branched bis(hydroxymethyl)styrene (BHMS) unit as depicted below, which can be used to incorporate and release multiple drugs.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein Q is —C\n1\n-C\n8 \nalkyl, —O—(C\n1\n-C\n8 \nalkyl), -halogen, -nitro or -cyano; m is an integer ranging from 0-4; n is 0 or 1; and p ranges raging from 1 to about 20.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA linker may comprise any one or more of the above linker components. In certain embodiments, a linker is as shown in brackets in the following ADC Formula II\n\n\n \n \n \nAbAa-Ww-Yy]-D)\np\n  II\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein A is a stretcher unit, and a is an integer from 0 to 1; W is an amino acid unit, and w is an integer from 0 to 12; Y is a spacer unit, and y is 0, 1, or 2; and Ab, D, and p are defined as above for Formula I. Exemplary embodiments of such linkers are described in US 2005-0238649 A1, which is expressly incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary linker components and combinations thereof are shown below in the context of ADCs of Formula II:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLinkers components, including stretcher, spacer, and amino acid units, may be synthesized by methods known in the art, such as those described in US 2005-0238649 A1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nb) Exemplary Drug Moieties\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(1) Maytansine and Maytansinoids\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, an immunoconjugate comprises an antibody of the invention conjugated to one or more maytansinoid molecules. Maytansinoids are mitototic inhibitors which act by inhibiting tubulin polymerization. Maytansine was first isolated from the east African shrub \nMaytenus serrata \n(U.S. Pat. No. 3,896,111). Subsequently, it was discovered that certain microbes also produce maytansinoids, such as maytansinol and C-3 maytansinol esters (U.S. Pat. No. 4,151,042). Synthetic maytansinol and derivatives and analogues thereof are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,137,230; 4,248,870; 4,256,746; 4,260,608; 4,265,814; 4,294,757; 4,307,016; 4,308,268; 4,308,269; 4,309,428; 4,313,946; 4,315,929; 4,317,821; 4,322,348; 4,331,598; 4,361,650; 4,364,866; 4,424,219; 4,450,254; 4,362,663; and 4,371,533.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMaytansinoid drug moieties are attractive drug moieties in antibody-drug conjugates because they are: (i) relatively accessible to prepare by fermentation or chemical modification or derivatization of fermentation products, (ii) amenable to derivatization with functional groups suitable for conjugation through non-disulfide linkers to antibodies, (iii) stable in plasma, and (iv) effective against a variety of tumor cell lines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMaytansine compounds suitable for use as maytansinoid drug moieties are well known in the art and can be isolated from natural sources according to known methods or produced using genetic engineering techniques (see Yu et al (2002) PNAS 99:7968-7973). Maytansinol and maytansinol analogues may also be prepared synthetically according to known methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary maytansinoid drug moieties include those having a modified aromatic ring, such as: C-19-dechloro (U.S. Pat. No. 4,256,746) (prepared by lithium aluminum hydride reduction of ansamytocin P2); C-20-hydroxy (or C-20-demethyl) +/−C-19-dechloro (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,361,650 and 4,307,016) (prepared by demethylation using \nStreptomyces \nor \nActinomyces \nor dechlorination using LAH); and C-20-demethoxy, C-20-acyloxy (—OCOR), +/−dechloro (U.S. Pat. No. 4,294,757) (prepared by acylation using acyl chlorides). and those having modifications at other positions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary maytansinoid drug moieties also include those having modifications such as: C-9-SH (U.S. Pat. No. 4,424,219) (prepared by the reaction of maytansinol with H\n2\nS or P\n2\nS\n5\n); C-14-alkoxymethyl(demethoxy/CH\n2\nOR) (U.S. Pat. No. 4,331,598); C-14-hydroxymethyl or acyloxymethyl (CH\n2\nOH or CH\n2\nOAc) (U.S. Pat. No. 4,450,254) (prepared from \nNocardia\n); C-15-hydroxy/acyloxy (U.S. Pat. No. 4,364,866) (prepared by the conversion of maytansinol by \nStreptomyces\n); C-15-methoxy (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,313,946 and 4,315,929) (isolated from \nTrewia nudlflora\n); C-18-N-demethyl (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,362,663 and 4,322,348) (prepared by the demethylation of maytansinol by \nStreptomyces\n); and 4,5-deoxy (U.S. Pat. No. 4,371,533) (prepared by the titanium trichloride/LAH reduction of maytansinol).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary embodiments of maytansinoid drug moieities include: DM1; DM3; and DM4, having the structures:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein the wavy line indicates the covalent attachment of the sulfur atom of the drug to a linker (L) of an antibody-drug conjugate. HERCEPTIN® (trastuzumab) linked by SMCC to DM1 has been reported (WO 2005/037992; US 2005/0276812 A1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther exemplary maytansinoid antibody-drug conjugates have the following structures and abbreviations, (wherein Ab is antibody and p is 1 to about 8):\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary antibody-drug conjugates where DM1 is linked through a BMPEO linker to a thiol group of the antibody have the structure and abbreviation:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwhere Ab is antibody; n is 0, 1, or 2; and p is 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmunoconjugates containing maytansinoids, methods of making the same, and their therapeutic use are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,208,020, 5,416,064, US 2005/0276812 A1, and \nEuropean Patent EP\n 0 425 235 B1, the disclosures of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference. Liu et al. \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n93:8618-8623 (1996) describe immunoconjugates comprising a maytansinoid designated DM1 linked to the monoclonal antibody C242 directed against human colorectal cancer. The conjugate was found to be highly cytotoxic towards cultured colon cancer cells, and showed antitumor activity in an in vivo tumor growth assay. Chari et al. \nCancer Research \n52:127-131 (1992) describe immunoconjugates in which a maytansinoid was conjugated via a disulfide linker to the murine antibody A7 binding to an antigen on human colon cancer cell lines, or to another murine monoclonal antibody TA.1 that binds the HER-2/neu oncogene. The cytotoxicity of the TA.1-maytansonoid conjugate was tested in vitro on the human breast cancer cell line SK-BR-3, which expresses 3×10\n5 \nHER-2 surface antigens per cell. The drug conjugate achieved a degree of cytotoxicity similar to the free maytansinoid drug, which could be increased by increasing the number of maytansinoid molecules per antibody molecule. The A7-maytansinoid conjugate showed low systemic cytotoxicity in mice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody-maytansinoid conjugates are prepared by chemically linking an antibody to a maytansinoid molecule without significantly diminishing the biological activity of either the antibody or the maytansinoid molecule. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,208,020 (the disclosure of which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference). An average of 3-4 maytansinoid molecules conjugated per antibody molecule has shown efficacy in enhancing cytotoxicity of target cells without negatively affecting the function or solubility of the antibody, although even one molecule of toxin/antibody would be expected to enhance cytotoxicity over the use of naked antibody. Maytansinoids are well known in the art and can be synthesized by known techniques or isolated from natural sources. Suitable maytansinoids are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,208,020 and in the other patents and nonpatent publications referred to hereinabove. Preferred maytansinoids are maytansinol and maytansinol analogues modified in the aromatic ring or at other positions of the maytansinol molecule, such as various maytansinol esters.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are many linking groups known in the art for making antibody-maytansinoid conjugates, including, for example, those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,208,020 or \nEP Patent\n 0 425 235 B1; Chari et al. \nCancer Research \n52:127-131 (1992); and US 2005/016993 A1, the disclosures of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference. Antibody-maytansinoid conjugates comprising the linker component SMCC may be prepared as disclosed in US 2005/0276812 A1, “Antibody-drug conjugates and Methods.” The linkers comprise disulfide groups, thioether groups, acid labile groups, photolabile groups, peptidase labile groups, or esterase labile groups, as disclosed in the above-identified patents. Additional linkers are described and exemplified herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConjugates of the antibody and maytansinoid may be made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate (SPDP), succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC), iminothiolane (IT), bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters (such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl), active esters (such as disuccinimidyl suberate), aldehydes (such as glutaraldehyde), bis-azido compounds (such as bis(p-azidobenzoyl)hexanediamine), bis-diazonium derivatives (such as bis-(p-diazoniumbenzoyl)-ethylenediamine), diisocyanates (such as \ntoluene\n 2,6-diisocyanate), and bis-active fluorine compounds (such as 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene). In certain embodiments, the coupling agent is N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionate (SPDP) (Carlsson et al., \nBiochem. J. \n173:723-737 (1978)) or N-succinimidyl-4-(2-pyridylthio)pentanoate (SPP) to provide for a disulfide linkage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe linker may be attached to the maytansinoid molecule at various positions, depending on the type of the link. For example, an ester linkage may be formed by reaction with a hydroxyl group using conventional coupling techniques. The reaction may occur at the C-3 position having a hydroxyl group, the C-14 position modified with hydroxymethyl, the C-15 position modified with a hydroxyl group, and the C-20 position having a hydroxyl group. In one embodiment, the linkage is formed at the C-3 position of maytansinol or a maytansinol analogue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(2) Auristatins and Dolastatins\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, an immunoconjugate comprises an antibody of the invention conjugated to dolastatin or a dolastatin peptidic analog or derivative, e.g., an auristatin (U.S. Pat.

See, Doronina et al. (2006) \nBioconjugate Chem. \n17:114-124. In such instances, drug release is believed to be effected by antibody degradation in the cell. Id.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypically, peptide-based drug moieties can be prepared by forming a peptide bond between two or more amino acids and/or peptide fragments. Such peptide bonds can be prepared, for example, according to the liquid phase synthesis method (see E. Schroder and K. Liibke, “The Peptides”, \nvolume\n 1, pp 76-136, 1965, Academic Press) that is well known in the field of peptide chemistry. Auristatin/dolastatin drug moieties may be prepared according to the methods of: US 2005-0238649 A1; U.S. Pat. No. 5,635,483; U.S. Pat. No. 5,780,588; Pettit et al (1989) \nJ. Am. Chem.

Biotechnol. \n21(7):778-784.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular, auristatin/dolastatin drug moieties of formula D\nF\n, such as MMAF and derivatives thereof, may be prepared using methods described in US 2005-0238649 A1 and Doronina et al. (2006) \nBioconjugate Chem. \n17:114-124. Auristatin/dolastatin drug moieties of formula D\nE\n, such as MMAE and derivatives thereof, may be prepared using methods described in Doronina et al. (2003) \nNat. Biotech. \n21:778-784. Drug-linker moieties MC-MMAF, MC-MMAE, MC-vc-PAB-MMAF, and MC-vc-PAB-MMAE may be conveniently synthesized by routine methods, e.g., as described in Doronina et al. (2003) \nNat. Biotech. \n21:778-784, and Patent Application Publication No. US 2005/0238649 A1, and then conjugated to an antibody of interest.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(3) Calicheamicin\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the immunoconjugate comprises an antibody of the invention conjugated to one or more calicheamicin molecules. The calicheamicin family of antibiotics are capable of producing double-stranded DNA breaks at sub-picomolar concentrations. For the preparation of conjugates of the calicheamicin family, see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,712,374, 5,714,586, 5,739,116, 5,767,285, 5,770,701, 5,770,710, 5,773,001, 5,877,296 (all to American Cyanamid Company). Structural analogues of calicheamicin which may be used include, but are not limited to, γ\n1\n \nI\n, α\n2\n \nI\n, α\n3\n \nI\n, N-acetyl-γ\n1\n \nI\n, PSAG and θ\nI\n \n1 \n(Hinman et al., \nCancer Research \n53:3336-3342 (1993), Lode et al., \nCancer Research \n58:2925-2928 (1998), and the aforementioned U.S. patents to American Cyanamid). Another anti-tumor drug to which the antibody can be conjugated is QFA, which is an antifolate. Both calicheamicin and QFA have intracellular sites of action and do not readily cross the plasma membrane. Therefore, cellular uptake of these agents through antibody-mediated internalization greatly enhances their cytotoxic effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nc) Other Cytotoxic Agents\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther antitumor agents that can be conjugated to the antibodies of the invention include BCNU, streptozocin, vincristine and 5-fluorouracil, the family of agents known collectively as the LL-E33288 complex, described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,053,394, 5,770,710, as well as esperamicins (U.S. Pat. No. 5,877,296).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof which can be used include diphtheria A chain, nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin, exotoxin A chain (from \nPseudomonas aeruginosa\n), ricin A chain, abrin A chain, modeccin A chain, alpha-sarcin, \nAleurites fordii \nproteins, dianthin proteins, \nPhytolaca americana \nproteins (PAPI, PAPII, and PAP-S), \nmomordica charantia \ninhibitor, curcin, crotin, sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor, gelonin, mitogellin, restrictocin, phenomycin, enomycin and the tricothecenes. See, for example, WO 93/21232 published Oct. 28, 1993.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention further contemplates an immunoconjugate formed between an antibody and a compound with nucleolytic activity (e.g., a ribonuclease or a DNA endonuclease such as a deoxyribonuclease; DNase).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, an immunoconjugate may comprise a highly radioactive atom. A variety of radioactive isotopes are available for the production of radioconjugated antibodies. Examples include At\n211\n, I\n131\n, I\n125\n, Y\n90\n, Re\n186\n, Re\n188\n, Sm\n153\n, Bi\n212\n, P\n32\n, Pb\n212 \nand radioactive isotopes of Lu. When the immunoconjugate is used for detection, it may comprise a radioactive atom for scintigraphic studies, for example tc\n99m \nor I\n123\n, or a spin label for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging (also known as magnetic resonance imaging, mri), such as iodine-123, iodine-131, indium-111, fluorine-19, carbon-13, nitrogen-15, oxygen-17, gadolinium, manganese or iron.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe radio- or other labels may be incorporated in the immunoconjugate in known ways. For example, the peptide may be biosynthesized or may be synthesized by chemical amino acid synthesis using suitable amino acid precursors involving, for example, fluorine-19 in place of hydrogen. Labels such as tc\n99m \nor I\n123\n, Re\n186\n, Re\n188 \nand In\n111 \ncan be attached via a cysteine residue in the peptide. Yttrium-90 can be attached via a lysine residue. The IODOGEN method (Fraker et al (1978) \nBiochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. \n80: 49-57 can be used to incorporate iodine-123. “Monoclonal Antibodies in Immunoscintigraphy” (Chatal, CRC Press 1989) describes other methods in detail.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, an immunoconjugate may comprise an anti-TAT226 antibody of the invention conjugated to a prodrug-activating enzyme that converts a prodrug (e.g., a peptidyl chemotherapeutic agent, see WO 81/01145) to an active drug, such as an anti-cancer drug. Such immunoconjugates are useful in antibody-dependent enzyme-mediated prodrug therapy (“ADEPT”). Enzymes that may be conjugated to an anti-TAT226 antibody of the invention include, but are not limited to, alkaline phosphatases, which are useful for converting phosphate-containing prodrugs into free drugs; arylsulfatases, which are useful for converting sulfate-containing prodrugs into free drugs; cytosine deaminase, which is useful for converting non-toxic 5-fluorocytosine into the anti-cancer drug, 5-fluorouracil; proteases, such as serratia protease, thermolysin, subtilisin, carboxypeptidases and cathepsins (such as cathepsins B and L), which are useful for converting peptide-containing prodrugs into free drugs; D-alanylcarboxypeptidases, which are useful for converting prodrugs that contain D-amino acid substituents; carbohydrate-cleaving enzymes such as β-galactosidase and neuraminidase, which are useful for converting glycosylated prodrugs into free drugs; β-lactamase, which is useful for converting drugs derivatized with β-lactams into free drugs; and penicillin amidases, such as penicillin V amidase and penicillin G amidase, which are useful for converting drugs derivatized at their amine nitrogens with phenoxyacetyl or phenylacetyl groups, respectively, into free drugs. Enzymes may be covalently bound to the anti-TAT226 antibodies of the invention by recombinant DNA techniques well known in the art. See, e.g., Neuberger et al., \nNature \n312:604-608 (1984).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nd) Drug Loading\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDrug loading is represented by p, the average number of drug moieties per antibody in a molecule of Formula I. Drug loading may range from 1 to 20 drug moieties (D) per antibody. ADCs of Formula I include collections of antibodies conjugated with a range of drug moieties, from 1 to 20. The average number of drug moieties per antibody in preparations of ADC from conjugation reactions may be characterized by conventional means such as mass spectroscopy, ELISA assay, and HPLC. The quantitative distribution of ADC in terms of p may also be determined. In some instances, separation, purification, and characterization of homogeneous ADC where p is a certain value from ADC with other drug loadings may be achieved by means such as reverse phase HPLC or electrophoresis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor some antibody-drug conjugates, p may be limited by the number of attachment sites on the antibody. For example, where the attachment is a cysteine thiol, as in the exemplary embodiments above, an antibody may have only one or several cysteine thiol groups, or may have only one or several sufficiently reactive thiol groups through which a linker may be attached. In certain embodiments, higher drug loading, e.g. p>5, may cause aggregation, insolubility, toxicity, or loss of cellular permeability of certain antibody-drug conjugates. In certain embodiments, the drug loading for an ADC of the invention ranges from 1 to about 8; from about 2 to about 6; or from about 3 to about 5. Indeed, it has been shown that for certain ADCs, the optimal ratio of drug moieties per antibody may be less than 8, and may be about 2 to about 5. See US 2005-0238649 A1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, fewer than the theoretical maximum of drug moieties are conjugated to an antibody during a conjugation reaction. An antibody may contain, for example, lysine residues that do not react with the drug-linker intermediate or linker reagent, as discussed below. Generally, antibodies do not contain many free and reactive cysteine thiol groups which may be linked to a drug moiety; indeed most cysteine thiol residues in antibodies exist as disulfide bridges. In certain embodiments, an antibody may be reduced with a reducing agent such as dithiothreitol (DTT) or tricarbonylethylphosphine (TCEP), under partial or total reducing conditions, to generate reactive cysteine thiol groups. In certain embodiments, an antibody is subjected to denaturing conditions to reveal reactive nucleophilic groups such as lysine or cysteine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe loading (drug/antibody ratio) of an ADC may be controlled in different ways, e.g., by: (i) limiting the molar excess of drug-linker intermediate or linker reagent relative to antibody, (ii) limiting the conjugation reaction time or temperature, and (iii) partial or limiting reductive conditions for cysteine thiol modification.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is to be understood that where more than one nucleophilic group reacts with a drug-linker intermediate or linker reagent followed by drug moiety reagent, then the resulting product is a mixture of ADC compounds with a distribution of one or more drug moieties attached to an antibody. The average number of drugs per antibody may be calculated from the mixture by a dual ELISA antibody assay, which is specific for antibody and specific for the drug. Individual ADC molecules may be identified in the mixture by mass spectroscopy and separated by HPLC, e.g. hydrophobic interaction chromatography (see, e.g., Hamblett, K. J., et al. “Effect of drug loading on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity of an anti-CD30 antibody-drug conjugate,” Abstract No. 624, American Association for Cancer Research, 2004 Annual Meeting, Mar. 27-31, 2004, Proceedings of the AACR, \nVolume\n 45, March 2004; Alley, S. C., et al. “Controlling the location of drug attachment in antibody-drug conjugates,” Abstract No. 627, American Association for Cancer Research, 2004 Annual Meeting, Mar. 27-31, 2004, Proceedings of the AACR, \nVolume\n 45, March 2004). In certain embodiments, a homogeneous ADC with a single loading value may be isolated from the conjugation mixture by electrophoresis or chromatography.\n\n\n \n \n \n \ne) Certain Methods of Preparing Immunconjugates\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn ADC of Formula I may be prepared by several routes employing organic chemistry reactions, conditions, and reagents known to those skilled in the art, including: (1) reaction of a nucleophilic group of an antibody with a bivalent linker reagent to form Ab-L via a covalent bond, followed by reaction with a drug moiety D; and (2) reaction of a nucleophilic group of a drug moiety with a bivalent linker reagent, to form D-L, via a covalent bond, followed by reaction with a nucleophilic group of an antibody. Exemplary methods for preparing an ADC of Formula I via the latter route are described in US 2005-0238649 A1, which is expressly incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleophilic groups on antibodies include, but are not limited to: (i) N-terminal amine groups, (ii) side chain amine groups, e.g. lysine, (iii) side chain thiol groups, e.g. cysteine, and (iv) sugar hydroxyl or amino groups where the antibody is glycosylated. Amine, thiol, and hydroxyl groups are nucleophilic and capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including: (i) active esters such as NHS esters, HOBt esters, haloformates, and acid halides; (ii) alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides; (iii) aldehydes, ketones, carboxyl, and maleimide groups. Certain antibodies have reducible interchain disulfides, i.e. cysteine bridges. Antibodies may be made reactive for conjugation with linker reagents by treatment with a reducing agent such as DTT (dithiothreitol) or tricarbonylethylphosphine (TCEP), such that the antibody is fully or partially reduced. Each cysteine bridge will thus form, theoretically, two reactive thiol nucleophiles. Additional nucleophilic groups can be introduced into antibodies through modification of lysine residues, e.g., by reacting lysine residues with 2-iminothiolane (Traut's reagent), resulting in conversion of an amine into a thiol. Reactive thiol groups may be introduced into an antibody by introducing one, two, three, four, or more cysteine residues (e.g., by preparing variant antibodies comprising one or more non-native cysteine amino acid residues).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody-drug conjugates of the invention may also be produced by reaction between an electrophilic group on an antibody, such as an aldehyde or ketone carbonyl group, with a nucleophilic group on a linker reagent or drug. Useful nucleophilic groups on a linker reagent include, but are not limited to, hydrazide, oxime, amino, hydrazine, thiosemicarbazone, hydrazine carboxylate, and arylhydrazide. In one embodiment, an antibody is modified to introduce electrophilic moieties that are capable of reacting with nucleophilic substituents on the linker reagent or drug. In another embodiment, the sugars of glycosylated antibodies may be oxidized, e.g. with periodate oxidizing reagents, to form aldehyde or ketone groups which may react with the amine group of linker reagents or drug moieties. The resulting imine Schiff base groups may form a stable linkage, or may be reduced, e.g. by borohydride reagents to form stable amine linkages. In one embodiment, reaction of the carbohydrate portion of a glycosylated antibody with either galactose oxidase or sodium meta-periodate may yield carbonyl (aldehyde and ketone) groups in the antibody that can react with appropriate groups on the drug (Hermanson, Bioconjugate Techniques). In another embodiment, antibodies containing N-terminal serine or threonine residues can react with sodium meta-periodate, resulting in production of an aldehyde in place of the first amino acid (Geoghegan & Stroh, (1992) \nBioconjugate Chem. \n3:138-146; U.S. Pat. No. 5,362,852). Such an aldehyde can be reacted with a drug moiety or linker nucleophile.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleophilic groups on a drug moiety include, but are not limited to: amine, thiol, hydroxyl, hydrazide, oxime, hydrazine, thiosemicarbazone, hydrazine carboxylate, and arylhydrazide groups capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including: (i) active esters such as NHS esters, HOBt esters, haloformates, and acid halides; (ii) alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides; (iii) aldehydes, ketones, carboxyl, and maleimide groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention expressly contemplate, but are not limited to, ADC prepared with the following cross-linker reagents: BMPS, EMCS, GMBS, HBVS, LC-SMCC, MBS, MPBH, SBAP, SIA, SIAB, SMCC, SMPB, SMPH, sulfo-EMCS, sulfo-GMBS, sulfo-KMUS, sulfo-MBS, sulfo-SIAB, sulfo SMCC, and sulfo-SMPB, and SVSB (succinimidyl-(4-vinylsulfone)benzoate) which are commercially available (e.g., from Pierce Biotechnology, Inc., Rockford, Ill., U.S.A; see pages 467-498, 2003-2004 Applications Handbook and Catalog.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmunoconjugates comprising an antibody and a cytotoxic agent may also be made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate (SPDP), succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC), iminothiolane (IT), bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters (such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl), active esters (such as disuccinimidyl suberate), aldehydes (such as glutaraldehyde), bis-azido compounds (such as bis(p-azidobenzoyl) hexanediamine), bis-diazonium derivatives (such as bis-(p-diazoniumbenzoyl)-ethylenediamine), diisocyanates (such as \ntoluene\n 2,6-diisocyanate), and bis-active fluorine compounds (such as 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene). For example, a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al., \nScience \n238:1098 (1987). Carbon-14-labeled 1-isothiocyanatobenzyl-3-methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid (MX-DTPA) is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See WO94/11026.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, a fusion protein comprising an antibody and a cytotoxic agent may be made, e.g., by recombinant techniques or peptide synthesis. A recombinant DNA molecule may comprise regions encoding the antibody and cytotoxic portions of the conjugate either adjacent to one another or separated by a region encoding a linker peptide which does not destroy the desired properties of the conjugate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment, an antibody may be conjugated to a “receptor” (such as streptavidin) for utilization in tumor pre-targeting wherein the antibody-receptor conjugate is administered to the patient, followed by removal of unbound conjugate from the circulation using a clearing agent and then administration of a “ligand” (e.g., avidin) which is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent (e.g., a radionucleotide).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nD. Pharmaceutical Formulations\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention further provides pharmaceutical formulations comprising at least one anti-TAT226 antibody of the invention and/or at least one immunoconjugate thereof. In some embodiments, a pharmaceutical formulation comprises 1) an anti-TAT226 antibody and/or an immunoconjugate thereof, and 2) a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In some embodiments, a pharmaceutical formulation comprises 1) an anti-TAT226 antibody and/or an immunoconjugate thereof, and optionally, 2) at least one additional therapeutic agent. Additional therapeutic agents include, but are not limited to, those described below in Section E.2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical formulations comprising an antibody or immunoconjugate of the invention are prepared for storage by mixing the antibody or immunoconjugate having the desired degree of purity with optional physiologically acceptable carriers, excipients or stabilizers (\nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences \n16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. (1980)) in the form of aqueous solutions or lyophilized or other dried formulations. Acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, histidine and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride); phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugars such as sucrose, mannitol, trehalose or sorbitol; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g., Zn-protein complexes); and/or non-ionic surfactants such as TWEEN™, PLURONICS™ or polyethylene glycol (PEG). Pharmaceutical formulations to be used for in vivo administration are generally sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nActive ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsule prepared, for example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization, for example, hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsule and poly-(methylmethacylate) microcapsule, respectively, in colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules) or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences \n16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. (1980).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSustained-release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the antibody or immunoconjugate of the invention, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, or microcapsule. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and y ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT™ (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and poly-D-(−)-3-hydroxybutyric acid. While polymers such as ethylene-vinyl acetate and lactic acid-glycolic acid enable release of molecules for over 100 days, certain hydrogels release proteins for shorter time periods. When encapsulated antibodies or immunoconjugates remain in the body for a long time, they may denature or aggregate as a result of exposure to moisture at 37° C., resulting in a loss of biological activity and possible changes in immunogenicity. Rational strategies can be devised for stabilization depending on the mechanism involved. For example, if the aggregation mechanism is discovered to be intermolecular S—S bond formation through thio-disulfide interchange, stabilization may be achieved by modifying sulfhydryl residues, lyophilizing from acidic solutions, controlling moisture content, using appropriate additives, and developing specific polymer matrix compositions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nE. Methods of Using Anti-TAT226 Antibodies and Immunoconjugates\n\n\n \n \n \n \n1. Diagnostic Methods and Methods of Detection\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, anti-TAT226 antibodies and immunoconjugates of the invention are useful for detecting the presence of TAT226 in a biological sample. The term “detecting” as used herein encompasses quantitative or qualitative detection. In certain embodiments, a biological sample comprises a cell or tissue, such as the tissues listed in \nFIG. 13\n. In certain embodiments, such tissues include normal and/or cancerous tissues that express TAT226 at higher levels relative to other tissues, for example, ovarian, kidney, brain, endometrial, adrenal, bone, lung, skin, and soft tissue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention provides a method of detecting the presence of TAT226 in a biological sample. In certain embodiments, the method comprises contacting the biological sample with an anti-TAT226 antibody under conditions permissive for binding of the anti-TAT226 antibody to TAT226, and detecting whether a complex is formed between the anti-TAT226 antibody and TAT226.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention provides a method of diagnosing a disorder associated with increased expression of TAT226. In certain embodiments, the method comprises contacting a test cell with an anti-TAT226 antibody; determining the level of expression (either quantitatively or qualitatively) of TAT226 by the test cell by detecting binding of the anti-TAT226 antibody to TAT226; and comparing the level of expression of TAT226 by the test cell with the level of expression of TAT226 by a control cell (e.g., a normal cell of the same tissue origin as the test cell or a cell that expresses TAT226 at levels comparable to such a normal cell), wherein a higher level of expression of TAT226 by the test cell as compared to the control cell indicates the presence of a disorder associated with increased expression of TAT226. In certain embodiments, the test cell is obtained from an individual suspected of having a disorder associated with increased expression of TAT226. In certain embodiments, the disorder is a cell proliferative disorder, such as a cancer or a tumor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary cell proliferative disorders that may be diagnosed using an antibody of the invention include cancerous conditions such as tumors, e.g., carcinomas (epithelial tumors) and blastomas (embryonic tissue-derived tumors), and in certain embodiments, ovarian cancer, uterine cancer, (including endometrial cancer), and kidney cancer, including nephroblastomas (e.g., Wilms' tumor). Ovarian cancer, in particular, encompasses a heterogeneous group of malignant tumors derived from the ovary. Approximately 90% of malignant ovarian tumors are epithelial in origin; the remainder are germ cell and stromal tumors. Epithelial ovarian tumors are classified into the following histological subtypes: serous adenocarcinomas (constituting about 50% of epithelial ovarian tumors); endometrioid adenocarcinomas (˜20%); mucinous adenocarcinomas (˜10%); clear cell carcinomas (˜5-10%); Brenner (transitional cell) tumors (relatively uncommon). The prognosis for ovarian cancer, which is the sixth most common cancer in women, is usually poor, with five year survival rates ranging from 5-30%. For reviews of ovarian cancer, see Fox et al. (2002) “Pathology of epithelial ovarian cancer,” in \nOvarian Cancer \nch. 9 (Jacobs et al., eds., Oxford University Press, New York); Morin et al. (2001) “Ovarian Cancer,” in \nEncyclopedic Reference of Cancer\n, pp. 654-656 (Schwab, ed., Springer-Verlag, New York). The present invention contemplates methods of diagnosing or treating any of the epithelial ovarian tumor subtypes described above, and in particular, the serous adenocarcinoma subtype.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, a method of diagnosis or detection, such as those described above, comprises detecting binding of an anti-TAT226 antibody to TAT226 expressed on the surface of a cell or in a membrane preparation obtained from a cell expressing TAT226 on its surface. In certain embodiments, the method comprises contacting a cell with an anti-TAT226 antibody under conditions permissive for binding of the anti-TAT226 antibody to TAT226, and detecting whether a complex is formed between the anti-TAT226 antibody and TAT226 on the cell surface. An exemplary assay for detecting binding of an anti-TAT226 antibody to TAT226 expressed TAT226 on the surface of a cell is a “FACS” assay, such as that described in Example D, below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain other methods can be used to detect binding of anti-TAT226 antibodies to TAT226. Such methods include, but are not limited to, antigen-binding assays that are well known in the art, such as western blots, radioimmunoassays, ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay), “sandwich” immunoassays, immunoprecipitation assays, fluorescent immunoassays, protein A immunoassays, and immunohistochemistry (IHC).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, anti-TAT226 antibodies are labeled. Labels include, but are not limited to, labels or moieties that are detected directly (such as fluorescent, chromophoric, electron-dense, chemiluminescent, and radioactive labels), as well as moieties, such as enzymes or ligands, that are detected indirectly, e.g., through an enzymatic reaction or molecular interaction. Exemplary labels include, but are not limited to, the radioisotopes \n32\nP, \n14\nC, \n125\nI, \n3\nH, and a \n131\nI, fluorophores such as rare earth chelates or fluorescein and its derivatives, rhodamine and its derivatives, dansyl, umbelliferone, luceriferases, e.g., firefly luciferase and bacterial luciferase (U.S. Pat. No. 4,737,456), luciferin, 2,3-dihydrophthalazinediones, horseradish peroxidase (HRP), alkaline phosphatase, β-galactosidase, glucoamylase, lysozyme, saccharide oxidases, e.g., glucose oxidase, galactose oxidase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, heterocyclic oxidases such as uricase and xanthine oxidase, coupled with an enzyme that employs hydrogen peroxide to oxidize a dye precursor such as HRP, lactoperoxidase, or microperoxidase, biotin/avidin, spin labels, bacteriophage labels, stable free radicals, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, anti-TAT226 antibodies are immobilized on an insoluble matrix. Immobilization entails separating the anti-TAT226 antibody from any TAT226 that remains free in solution. This conventionally is accomplished by either insolubilizing the anti-TAT226 antibody before the assay procedure, as by adsorption to a water-insoluble matrix or surface (Bennich et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,720,760), or by covalent coupling (for example, using glutaraldehyde cross-linking), or by insolubilizing the anti-TAT226 antibody after formation of a complex between the anti-TAT226 antibody and TAT226, e.g., by immunoprecipitation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny of the above embodiments of diagnosis or detection may be carried out using an immunoconjugate of the invention in place of or in addition to an anti-TAT226 antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n2. Therapeutic Methods\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn antibody or immunoconjugate of the invention may be used in, for example, in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo therapeutic methods. In one aspect, the invention provides methods for inhibiting cell growth or proliferation, either in vivo or in vitro, the method comprising exposing a cell to an anti-TAT226 antibody or immunoconjugate thereof under conditions permissive for binding of the immunoconjugate to TAT226 “Inhibiting cell growth or proliferation” means decreasing a cell's growth or proliferation by at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, or 100%, and includes inducing cell death. In certain embodiments, the cell is a tumor cell. In certain embodiments, the cell is an ovarian tumor cell, a uterine tumor cell, a brain tumor cell, or a kidney tumor cell. In certain embodiments, the cell is a xenograft, e.g., as exemplified herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, an antibody or immunoconjugate of the invention is used to treat or prevent a cell proliferative disorder. In certain embodiments, the cell proliferative disorder is associated with increased expression and/or activity of TAT226. For example, in certain embodiments, the cell proliferative disorder is associated with increased expression of TAT226 on the surface of a cell. In certain embodiments, the cell proliferative disorder is a tumor or a cancer. Examples of cell proliferative disorders to be treated by the antibodies or immunoconjugates of the invention include, but are not limited to, cancerous conditions such as tumors, e.g., carcinomas (epithelial tumors) and blastomas (embryonic tissue-derived tumors), and in certain embodiments, ovarian cancer; uterine cancer, including endometrial cancer; brain tumors (e.g., astrocytomas, encompassing advanced stage gliomas, also referred to as glioblastoma multiforme); and kidney cancer, including nephroblastomas (e.g., Wilms' tumor).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention provides methods for treating a cell proliferative disorder comprising administering to an individual an effective amount of an anti-TAT226 antibody or immunoconjugate thereof. In certain embodiments, a method for treating a cell proliferative disorder comprises administering to an individual an effective amount of a pharmaceutical formulation comprising an anti-TAT226 antibody and, optionally, at least one additional therapeutic agent, such as those provided below. In certain embodiments, a method for treating a cell proliferative disorder comprises administering to an individual an effective amount of a pharmaceutical formulation comprising 1) an immunoconjugate comprising an anti-TAT226 antibody and a cytotoxic agent; and optionally, 2) at least one additional therapeutic agent, such as those provided below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, at least some of the antibodies or immunoconjugates of the invention can bind TAT226 from species other than human. Accordingly, antibodies or immunoconjugates of the invention can be used to bind TAT226, e.g., in a cell culture containing TAT226, in humans, or in other mammals having a TAT226 with which an antibody or immunoconjugate of the invention cross-reacts (e.g. chimpanzee, baboon, marmoset, cynomolgus and rhesus monkeys, pig or mouse). In one embodiment, an anti-TAT226 antibody or immunoconjugate can be used for inhibiting a TAT226 activity by contacting the antibody or immunoconjugate with TAT226 such that TAT226 activity is inhibited. In one embodiment, the TAT226 is human TAT226.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, an anti-TAT226 antibody or immunoconjugate can be used in a method for binding TAT226 in an individual suffering from a disorder associated with increased TAT226 expression and/or activity, the method comprising administering to the individual the antibody or immunoconjugate such that TAT226 in the individual is bound. In one embodiment, the TAT226 is human TAT226, and the individual is a human individual. Alternatively, the individual can be a mammal expressing TAT226 to which an anti-TAT226 antibody binds. Still further the individual can be a mammal into which TAT226 has been introduced (e.g., by administration of TAT226 or by expression of a transgene encoding TAT226).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn anti-TAT226 antibody or immunoconjugate can be administered to a human for therapeutic purposes. Moreover, an anti-TAT226 antibody or immunoconjugate can be administered to a non-human mammal expressing TAT226 with which the antibody cross-reacts (e.g., a primate, pig, rat, or mouse) for veterinary purposes or as an animal model of human disease. Regarding the latter, such animal models may be useful for evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of antibodies or immunoconjugates of the invention (e.g., testing of dosages and time courses of administration).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies or immunoconjugates of the invention can be used either alone or in combination with other compositions in a therapy. For instance, an antibody or immunoconjugate of the invention may be co-administered with at least one additional therapeutic agent and/or adjuvant. In certain embodiments, an additional therapeutic agent is a cytotoxic agent, a chemotherapeutic agent, or a growth inhibitory agent. In one of such embodiments, a chemotherapeutic agent is an agent or a combination of agents used in the treatment of ovarian cancer, such as a platinum compound (e.g., cisplatin or carboplatin); a taxane (e.g., paclitaxel or docetaxel); topotecan; an anthracycline (e.g., doxorubicin (ADRIAMYCIN®) or liposomal doxorubicin (DOXIL®)); gemcitabine; cyclophosphamide; vinorelbine (NAVELBINE®); hexamethylmelamine; ifosfamide; and etoposide. In another of such embodiments, a chemotherapeutic agent is an agent or a combination of agents used in the treatment of uterine or endometrial cancer, such as cisplatin, carboplatin, doxorubicin, paclitaxel, methotrexate, fluorouracil and medroxyprogesterone. In another of such embodiments, a chemotherapeutic agent is an agent or combination of agents used in the treatment of brain tumors, such as a nitrosourea (e.g., carmustine or lomustine); a cytotoxic agent (e.g., irinotecan or temozolamide); an anti-angiogenic agent (e.g., thalidomide, TNP-470, \nplatelet factor\n 4, interferon and endostatin); a differentiating agent (e.g., retinoids, phenylbutyrate, phenylacetate, and anti-neoplastons); an anti-invasion agent (e.g., matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors such as marimastat); a signal transduction modulator (e.g., tamoxifen, bryostatin, and O-6 benzyguanine); a topoisomerase inhibitor (e.g., irinotecan or topotecan); and a growth factor inhibitor (e.g., a tyrosine kinase inhibitor). In another of such embodiments, a chemotherapeutic agent is an agent or a combination of agents used in the treatment of kidney cancer (e.g., Wilms' tumor), such as vincristine, actinomycin D, adriamycin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, etoposide, and carboplatin. In certain embodiments, an antibody of the invention may be combined with an anti-inflammatory and/or antiseptic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch combination therapies noted above encompass combined administration (where two or more therapeutic agents are included in the same or separate formulations), and separate administration, in which case, administration of the antibody or immunoconjugate of the invention can occur prior to, simultaneously, and/or following, administration of the additional therapeutic agent and/or adjuvant. Antibodies or immunoconjugates of the invention can also be used in combination with radiation therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn antibody or immunoconjugate of the invention (and any additional therapeutic agent or adjuvant) can be administered by any suitable means, including parenteral, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intrapulmonary, and intranasal, and, if desired for local treatment, intralesional administration. Parenteral infusions include intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous administration. In addition, the antibody or immunoconjugate is suitably administered by pulse infusion, particularly with declining doses of the antibody or immunoconjugate. Dosing can be by any suitable route, e.g. by injections, such as intravenous or subcutaneous injections, depending in part on whether the administration is brief or chronic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the binding target is located in the brain, certain embodiments of the invention provide for the antibody or immunoconjugate to traverse the blood-brain barrier. Several art-known approaches exist for transporting molecules across the blood-brain barrier, including, but not limited to, physical methods, lipid-based methods, stem cell-based methods, and receptor and channel-based methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPhysical methods of transporting an antibody or immunoconjugate across the blood-brain barrier include, but are not limited to, circumventing the blood-brain barrier entirely, or by creating openings in the blood-brain barrier. Circumvention methods include, but are not limited to, direct injection into the brain (see, e.g., Papanastassiou et al., \nGene Therapy \n9: 398-406 (2002)), interstitial infusion/convection-enhanced delivery (see, e.g., Bobo et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n91: 2076-2080 (1994)), and implanting a delivery device in the brain (see, e.g., Gill et al., \nNature Med. \n9: 589-595 (2003); and Gliadel Wafers™, Guildford Pharmaceutical). Methods of creating openings in the barrier include, but are not limited to, ultrasound (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Publication No. 2002/0038086), osmotic pressure (e.g., by administration of hypertonic mannitol (Neuwelt, E. A., \nImplication of the Blood\n-\nBrain Barrier and its Manipulation\n, \nVols\n 1 & 2, Plenum Press, N.Y. (1989)), permeabilization by, e.g., bradykinin or permeabilizer A-7 (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,112,596, 5,268,164, 5,506,206, and 5,686,416), and transfection of neurons that straddle the blood-brain barrier with vectors containing genes encoding the antibody (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Publication No. 2003/0083299).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLipid-based methods of transporting an antibody or immunoconjugate across the blood-brain barrier include, but are not limited to, encapsulating the antibody or immunoconjugate in liposomes that are coupled to antibody binding fragments that bind to receptors on the vascular endothelium of the blood-brain barrier (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20020025313), and coating the antibody or immunoconjugate in low-density lipoprotein particles (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20040204354) or apolipoprotein E (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20040131692).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStem-cell based methods of transporting an antibody or immunoconjugate across the blood-brain barrier entail genetically engineering neural progenitor cells (NPCs) to express the antibody or immunoconjugate of interest and then implanting the stem cells into the brain of the individual to be treated. See Behrstock et al. (2005) \nGene Ther. \n15 Dec. 2005 advanced online publication (reporting that NPCs genetically engineered to express the neurotrophic factor GDNF reduced symptoms of Parkinson disease when implanted into the brains of rodent and primate models).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReceptor and channel-based methods of transporting an antibody or immunoconjugate across the blood-brain barrier include, but are not limited to, using glucocorticoid blockers to increase permeability of the blood-brain barrier (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2002/0065259, 2003/0162695, and 2005/0124533); activating potassium channels (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2005/0089473), inhibiting ABC drug transporters (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0073713); coating antibodies or immunoconjugates with a transferrin and modulating activity of the one or more transferrin receptors (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0129186), and cationizing the antibodies or immunoconjugates (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,004,697).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies or immunoconjugates of the invention would be formulated, dosed, and administered in a fashion consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated, the particular mammal being treated, the clinical condition of the individual patient, the cause of the disorder, the site of delivery of the agent, the method of administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to medical practitioners. The antibody or immunoconjugate need not be, but is optionally formulated with one or more agents currently used to prevent or treat the disorder in question. The effective amount of such other agents depends on the amount of antibody or immunoconjugate present in the formulation, the type of disorder or treatment, and other factors discussed above. These are generally used in the same dosages and with administration routes as described herein, or about from 1 to 99% of the dosages described herein, or in any dosage and by any route that is empirically/clinically determined to be appropriate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the prevention or treatment of disease, the appropriate dosage of an antibody or immunoconjugate of the invention (when used alone or in combination with one or more other additional therapeutic agents, such as chemotherapeutic agents) will depend on the type of disease to be treated, the type of antibody or immunoconjugate, the severity and course of the disease, whether the antibody or immunoconjugate is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes, previous therapy, the patient's clinical history and response to the antibody or immunoconjugate, and the discretion of the attending physician. The antibody or immunoconjugate is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments. Depending on the type and severity of the disease, about 1 μg/kg to 15 mg/kg (e.g. 0.1 mg/kg-10 mg/kg) of antibody or immunoconjugate can be an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient, whether, for example, by one or more separate administrations, or by continuous infusion. One typical daily dosage might range from about 1 μg/kg to 100 mg/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. For repeated administrations over several days or longer, depending on the condition, the treatment would generally be sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. One exemplary dosage of the antibody or immunoconjugate would be in the range from about 0.05 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg. Thus, one or more doses of about 0.5 mg/kg, 2.0 mg/kg, 4.0 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg (or any combination thereof) may be administered to the patient. Such doses may be administered intermittently, e.g. every week or every three weeks (e.g. such that the patient receives from about two to about twenty, or e.g. about six doses of the antibody or immunoconjugate). An initial higher loading dose, followed by one or more lower doses may be administered. An exemplary dosing regimen comprises administering an initial loading dose of about 4 mg/kg, followed by a weekly maintenance dose of about 2 mg/kg of the antibody. However, other dosage regimens may be useful. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n3. Assays\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-TAT226 antibodies and immunoconjugates of the invention may be characterized for their physical/chemical properties and/or biological activities by various assays known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \na) Activity Assays\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, assays are provided for identifying anti-TAT226 antibodies or immunoconjugates thereof having biological activity. Biological activity may include, e.g., the ability to inhibit cell growth or proliferation (e.g., “cell killing” activity), or the ability to induce cell death, including programmed cell death (apoptosis). Antibodies or immunoconjugates having such biological activity in vivo and/or in vitro are also provided.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, an anti-TAT226 antibody or immunoconjugate thereof is tested for its ability to inhibit cell growth or proliferation in vitro. Assays for inhibition of cell growth or proliferation are well known in the art. Certain assays for cell proliferation, exemplified by the “cell killing” assays described herein, measure cell viability. One such assay is the CellTiter-Glo™ Luminescent Cell Viability Assay, which is commercially available from Promega (Madison, Wis.). That assay determines the number of viable cells in culture based on quantitation of ATP present, which is an indication of metabolically active cells. See Crouch et al (1993) \nJ. Immunol. Meth. \n160:81-88, U.S. Pat. No. 6,602,677. The assay may be conducted in 96- or 384-well format, making it amenable to automated high-throughput screening (HTS). See Cree et al (1995) \nAnti Cancer Drugs \n6:398-404. The assay procedure involves adding a single reagent (CellTiter-Glo® Reagent) directly to cultured cells. This results in cell lysis and generation of a luminescent signal produced by a luciferase reaction. The luminescent signal is proportional to the amount of ATP present, which is directly proportional to the number of viable cells present in culture. Data can be recorded by luminometer or CCD camera imaging device. The luminescence output is expressed as relative light units (RLU).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother assay for cell proliferation is the “MTT” assay, a colorimetric assay that measures the oxidation of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide to formazan by mitochondrial reductase. Like the CellTiter-Glo™ assay, this assay indicates the number of metabolically active cells present in a cell culture. See, e.g., Mosmann (1983) J. \nImmunol. Meth. \n65:55-63, and Zhang et al. (2005) \nCancer Res. \n65:3877-3882.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, an anti-TAT226 antibody is tested for its ability to induce cell death in vitro. Assays for induction of cell death are well known in the art. In some embodiments, such assays measure, e.g., loss of membrane integrity as indicated by uptake of propidium iodide (PI), trypan blue (see Moore et al. (1995) \nCytotechnology, \n17:1-11), or 7AAD. In an exemplary PI uptake assay, cells are cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (D-MEM):Ham's F-12 (50:50) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Hyclone) and 2 mM L-glutamine. Thus, the assay is performed in the absence of complement and immune effector cells. Cells are seeded at a density of 3×10\n6 \nper dish in 100×20 mm dishes and allowed to attach overnight. The medium is removed and replaced with fresh medium alone or medium containing various concentrations of the antibody or immunoconjugate. The cells are incubated for a 3-day time period. Following treatment, monolayers are washed with PBS and detached by trypsinization. Cells are then centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5 minutes at 4° C., the pellet resuspended in 3 ml cold Ca\n2+\n binding buffer (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 140 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl\n2\n) and aliquoted into 35 mm strainer-capped 12×75 mm tubes (1 ml per tube, 3 tubes per treatment group) for removal of cell clumps. Tubes then receive PI (10 μg/ml). Samples are analyzed using a FACSCAN™ flow cytometer and FACSCONVERT™ CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson). Antibodies or immunoconjugates which induce statistically significant levels of cell death as determined by PI uptake are thus identified.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, an anti-TAT226 antibody or immunoconjugate is tested for its ability to induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) in vitro. An exemplary assay for antibodies or immunconjugates that induce apoptosis is an annexin binding assay. In an exemplary annexin binding assay, cells are cultured and seeded in dishes as discussed in the preceding paragraph. The medium is removed and replaced with fresh medium alone or medium containing 0.001 to 10 μg/ml of the antibody or immunoconjugate. Following a three-day incubation period, monolayers are washed with PBS and detached by trypsinization. Cells are then centrifuged, resuspended in Ca\n2+\n binding buffer, and aliquoted into tubes as discussed in the preceding paragraph. Tubes then receive labeled annexin (e.g. annexin V-FITC) (1 μg/ml). Samples are analyzed using a FACSCAN™ flow cytometer and FACSCONVERT™ CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Antibodies or immunoconjugates that induce statistically significant levels of annexin binding relative to control are thus identified. Another exemplary assay for antibodies or immunconjugates that induce apoptosis is a histone DNA ELISA colorimetric assay for detecting internucleosomal degradation of genomic DNA. Such an assay can be performed using, e.g., the Cell Death Detection ELISA kit (Roche, Palo Alto, Calif.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCells for use in any of the above in vitro assays include cells or cell lines that naturally express TAT226 or that have been engineered to express TAT226. Such cells include tumor cells that overexpress TAT226 relative to normal cells of the same tissue origin. Such cells also include cell lines (including tumor cell lines) that express TAT226 and cell lines that do not normally express TAT226 but have been transfected with nucleic acid encoding TAT226. Exemplary cell lines provided herein for use in any of the above in vitro assays include the OVCAR3 human ovarian cancer cell line, which expresses TAT226, and the HCT116 human colon cancer cell line transfected with nucleic acid encoding TAT226.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, an anti-TAT226 antibody or immunoconjugate thereof is tested for its ability to inhibit cell growth or proliferation in vivo. In certain embodiments, an anti-TAT226 antibody or immunoconjugate thereof is tested for its ability to inhibit tumor growth in vivo. In vivo model systems, such as xenograft models, can be used for such testing. In an exemplary xenograft system, human tumor cells are introduced into a suitably immunocompromised non-human animal, e.g., an athymic “nude” mouse. An antibody or immunoconjugate of the invention is administered to the animal. The ability of the antibody or immunoconjugate to inhibit or decrease tumor growth is measured. In certain embodiments of the above xenograft system, the human tumor cells are tumor cells from a human patient. Such xenograft models are commercially available from Oncotest GmbH (Frieberg, Germany). In certain embodiments, the human tumor cells are cells from a human tumor cell line, such as OVCAR3 cells, as exemplified herein. In certain embodiments, the human tumor cells are introduced into a suitably immunocompromised non-human animal by subcutaneous injection or by transplantation into a suitable site, such as a mammary fat pad.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nb) Binding Assays and Other Assays\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, an anti-TAT226 antibody is tested for its antigen binding activity. For example, in certain embodiments, an anti-TAT226 antibody is tested for its ability to bind to TAT226 expressed on the surface of a cell. A FACS assay such as that described in Example D may be used for such testing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, competition assays may be used to identify a monoclonal antibody that competes with YWO.32, YWO.49, YWO.49.B7, YWO.49.C9, YWO.49.H2, or YWO.49.H6 for binding to TAT226. In certain embodiments, such a competing antibody binds to the same epitope (e.g., a linear or a conformational epitope) that is bound by YWO.32, YWO.49, YWO.49.B7, YWO.49.C9, YWO.49.H2, or YWO.49.H6. Exemplary competition assays include, but are not limited to, routine assays such as those provided in Harlow and Lane (1988) \nAntibodies: A Laboratory Manual \nch. 14 (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.). Detailed exemplary methods for mapping an epitope to which an antibody binds are provided in Morris (1996) “Epitope Mapping Protocols,” in \nMethods in Molecular Biology \nvol. 66 (Humana Press, Totowa, N.J.). Two antibodies are said to bind to the same epitope if each blocks binding of the other by 50% or more.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an exemplary competition assay, immobilized TAT226 is incubated in a solution comprising a first labeled antibody that binds to TAT226 (e.g., YWO.32, YWO.49, YWO.49.B7, YWO.49.C9, YWO.49.H2, or YWO.49.H6) and a second unlabeled antibody that is being tested for its ability to compete with the first antibody for binding to TAT226. The second antibody may be present in a hybridoma supernatant. As a control, immobilized TAT226 is incubated in a solution comprising the first labeled antibody but not the second unlabeled antibody. After incubation under conditions permissive for binding of the first antibody to TAT226, excess unbound antibody is removed, and the amount of label associated with immobilized TAT226 is measured. If the amount of label associated with immobilized TAT226 is substantially reduced in the test sample relative to the control sample, then that indicates that the second antibody is competing with the first antibody for binding to TAT226. In certain embodiments, immobilized TAT226 is present on the surface of a cell or in a membrane preparation obtained from a cell expressing TAT226 on its surface.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, purified anti-TAT226 antibodies can be further characterized by a series of assays including, but not limited to, N-terminal sequencing, amino acid analysis, non-denaturing size exclusion high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), mass spectrometry, ion exchange chromatography and papain digestion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the invention contemplates an altered antibody that possesses some but not all effector functions, which make it a desirable candidate for many applications in which the half life of the antibody in vivo is important yet certain effector functions (such as complement and ADCC) are unnecessary or deleterious. In certain embodiments, the Fc activities of the antibody are measured to ensure that only the desired properties are maintained. In vitro and/or in vivo cytotoxicity assays can be conducted to confirm the reduction/depletion of CDC and/or ADCC activities. For example, Fc receptor (FcR) binding assays can be conducted to ensure that the antibody lacks FcγR binding (hence likely lacking ADCC activity), but retains FcRn binding ability. The primary cells for mediating ADCC, NK cells, express FcγRIII only, whereas monocytes express FcγRI, FcγRII and FcγRIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet, \nAnnu. Rev. Immunol. \n9:457-92 (1991). An example of an in vitro assay to assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,500,362 or 5,821,337. Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and Natural Killer (NK) cells. Alternatively, or additionally, ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo, e.g., in a animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. \nPNAS \n(\nUSA\n) 95:652-656 (1998). C1q binding assays may also be carried out to confirm that the antibody is unable to bind C1q and hence lacks CDC activity. To assess complement activation, a CDC assay, e.g. as described in Gazzano-Santoro et al., \nJ. Immunol. Methods \n202:163 (1996), may be performed. FcRn binding and in vivo clearance/half life determinations can also be performed using methods known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nF. Articles of Manufacture\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect of the invention, an article of manufacture containing materials useful for the treatment, prevention and/or diagnosis of the disorders described above is provided. The article of manufacture comprises a container and a label or package insert on or associated with the container. Suitable containers include, for example, bottles, vials, syringes, etc. The containers may be formed from a variety of materials such as glass or plastic. The container holds a composition which is by itself or combined with another composition effective for treating, preventing and/or diagnosing the condition and may have a sterile access port (for example the container may be an intravenous solution bag or a vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle). At least one active agent in the composition is an antibody or immunoconjugate of the invention. The label or package insert indicates that the composition is used for treating the condition of choice. Moreover, the article of manufacture may comprise (a) a first container with a composition contained therein, wherein the composition comprises an antibody or immunoconjugate of the invention; and (b) a second container with a composition contained therein, wherein the composition comprises a further cytotoxic or otherwise therapeutic agent. The article of manufacture in this embodiment of the invention may further comprise a package insert indicating that the compositions can be used to treat a particular condition. Alternatively, or additionally, the article of manufacture may further comprise a second (or third) container comprising a pharmaceutically-acceptable buffer, such as bacteriostatic water for injection (BWFI), phosphate-buffered saline, Ringer's solution and dextrose solution. It may further include other materials desirable from a commercial and user standpoint, including other buffers, diluents, filters, needles, and syringes.\n\n\n \nIV. EXAMPLES\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following are examples of methods and compositions of the invention. It is understood that various other embodiments may be practiced, given the general description provided above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA. Analysis of TAT226 Gene Expression\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHuman TAT226 gene expression was analyzed using a proprietary database containing gene expression information (GeneExpress®, Gene Logic Inc., Gaithersburg, Md.). Graphical analysis of the GeneExpress® database was conducted using a microarray profile viewer. \nFIG. 13\n is a graphic representation of TAT226 gene expression in various tissues, which are listed at left. The scale across the top of the graph indicates gene expression levels based on hybridization signal intensity. Dots appear both above and below the line adjacent to each listed tissue. The dots appearing above the line represent gene expression in normal tissue, and the dots appearing below the line represent gene expression in tumor or diseased tissue. \nFIG. 13\n shows a trend toward increased TAT226 gene expression in tumor or diseased tissues relative to their normal counterparts. In particular, TAT226 shows substantial overexpression in tumorous and diseased ovary relative to normal ovary and in Wilms' tumor relative to normal kidney. Other tissues showing overexpression in tumor or diseased tissue relative to normal tissue include endometrial, adrenal, bone, lung, skin, and soft tissue. In addition, TAT226 is strongly expressed in normal brain tissue (such as rhinencephalon, hippocampus, and basal ganglia) and in tumorous or diseased brain tissue, such as gliomas.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe GeneExpress® database was also used to analyze human TAT226 gene expression in normal ovary; normal fallopian tube; ovarian cancer of the clear cell, mucinous, and serous cystoadenocarcinoma subtypes; metastatic ovarian cancer; and other types of ovarian cancer. The results are reported graphically in \nFIG. 14\n, with the particular tissue types indicated underneath the graph. The scale on the y-axis of the graph indicates gene expression levels based on hybridization signal intensity. Serous cystoadenocarcinoma and metastatic ovarian cancer showed strong overexpression of TAT226 relative to normal ovary. Clear cell and mucinous subtypes showed expression comparable to normal ovary. Normal fallopian tube also showed substantial expression of TAT226. Notably, the serous subtype of ovarian cancer closely resembles fallopian tube epithelium histologically, and both ovary and fallopian tubes are derived from the same embryonic tissue. See Fox et al. (2002) “Pathology of epithelial ovarian cancer,” in Ovarian Cancer ch. 9 (Jacobs et al., eds., Oxford University Press, New York)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nB. Generation of Anti-TAT226 Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies to TAT226 were generated by screening a phage display library with a recombinant “TAT226-His” fusion protein comprising amino acids 1-115 of SEQ ID NO:75 and a C-terminal polyhistidine tag. The phage display library was a synthetic (Fab′)\n2 \nlibrary generated using a Fab′-zip-phage system. See Lee et al. (2004) \nJ. Immunol. Methods \n284:119-132. The library comprised a library of heavy chain HVRs in the framework of the huMAb4D5-8 heavy chain variable region (see \nFIGS. 5A and 5B\n, second acceptor “B,” SEQ ID NOs:50, 51, 57, 35) and a fixed huMAb4D5-8 light chain variable region as shown in SEQ ID NO:26. Clones selected using phage display were screened against TAT226-His using phage ELISA (see, e.g., Sidhu et al. (2004) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n338:299-310). Clones YWO.32 and YWO.49 were selected for further analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo improve the affinity of YWO.49, phage display libraries were generated in the background of YWO.49, with HVR-H3 and HVR-L3 targeted for soft-randomization, in which selected amino acid residues in the designated HVRs were held constant while others were subjected to mutagenesis. Selected clones were screened by phage ELISA. Affinity matured antibodies designated YWO.49.B7, YWO.49.C9, YWO.49.H2, and YWO.49.H6 were selected for further analysis. The nucleotide and encoded polypeptide sequences of the VH and VL regions of YWO.32, YWO.49, YWO.49.B7, YWO.49.C9, YWO.49.H2, and YWO.49.H6 were determined, as shown in \nFIGS. 9 and 10\n. The heavy and light chain HVR sequences of YWO.32, YWO.49, YWO.49.B7, YWO.49.C9, YWO.49.H2, and YWO.49.H6 are shown in \nFIGS. 2-4\n. Consensus HVR-H3 and HVR-L3 sequences derived from YWO.49, YWO.49.B7, YWO.49.C9, YWO.49.H2, and YWO.49.H6 are also shown in \nFIG. 4\n. YWO.49, YWO.49.B7, YWO.49.C9, YWO.49.H2, and YWO.49.H6 were “reformatted” as full-length IgGs by grafting Fab′ fragments onto appropriate constant regions using recombinant techniques. The experiments described hereinafter were performed using the reformatted antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nC. Characterization of Binding Affinity to Recombinant Antigen\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe binding affinity of YWO.49, YWO.49.B7, YWO.49.C9, YWO.49.H2, and YWO.49.H6 for recombinant antigen was determined by surface plasmon resonance measurement using a BIACORE® 3000 system (Biacore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.). Briefly, carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CM5, Biacore Inc.) were activated with N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's instructions. Anti-TAT226 antibody was diluted to 5 ug/ml with 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, before injection at a flow rate of 5 μl/minute to achieve approximately 500 response units (RU) of coupled antibody. Next, 1M ethanolamine was injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of TAT226-His (0.7 nM to 500 nM) were injected in PBS with 0.05\n% Tween\n 20 at 25° C. at a flow rate of 25 μl/min Association rates (k\non\n) and dissociation rates (k\noff\n) were calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIAevaluation Software version 3.2). The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated as the ratio k\noff\n/k\non\n. The results of this experiment are shown in Table 2 below.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nClone\n\n\nk\non\n/10\n5\n \n\n\nk\noff\n/10\n−4\n \n\n\nKd (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYWO.49\n\n\n0.074\n\n\n3.49\n\n\n47.16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYWO.49.B7\n\n\n0.27\n\n\n<0.05\n\n\n<0.18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYWO.49.C9\n\n\n1.53\n\n\n<0.05\n\n\n<0.03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYWO.49.H2\n\n\n0.22\n\n\n0.05\n\n\n0.23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYWO.49.H6\n\n\n1.86\n\n\n0.09\n\n\n0.05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nD. Characterization of Antibody Binding to Cell Surface TAT226\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ability of anti-TAT226 antibodies to bind to TAT226 expressed on the surface of OVCAR3, a human ovarian cancer cell line, was examined. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was performed on OVCAR3 cells in the absence and in the presence of YWO.49, YWO.49.B7, YWO.49.C9, YWO.49.H2, or YWO.49.H6. Briefly, detached cells were incubated with 5 μg/ml primary antibody for 1 hour on ice, washed, and incubated with secondary antibody (anti-human IgG conjugated to phycoerythrin) for 30 minutes on ice. FACS was performed using a FACScan™ flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results of FACS analysis for YWO.49, YWO.49.H2, and YWO.H6 are shown in \nFIG. 15\n. The peaks on the left side of each graph represent “background” binding, i.e., binding of secondary antibody only. The peaks on the right side of each graph represent binding of the indicated anti-TAT226 antibody. YWO.49.B7 did not bind significantly to OVCAR3 cells by FACS, even though it bound to recombinant antigen with a Kd within the range of Kds observed for YWO.49 and the other affinity matured antibodies (see results of BIACORE® analysis, table 2 above). Binding of YWO.49.C9 was comparable to that observed for YWO.49.H2 and YWO.H6.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nE. Characterization of Binding Affinity to Cell Surface Antigen\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe binding affinity of YWO.49.H2 and YWO.49.H6 for TAT226 expressed on the surface of OVCAR3 cells was examined using a competition assay. Briefly, labeled (iodinated) YWO.49.H2 or YWO.49.H6 was allowed to bind to OVCAR3 cells in the presence of unlabeled antibody. Binding affinity of the antibodies was determined in accordance with the Scatchard analysis methodology initially described in Munson et al., \nAnal. Biochem. \n107:220 (1980). The results of this experiment are shown in Table 3 below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE 3\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nClone\n \nKd (nM)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nYWO.49.H2\n \n0.348\n \n \n \n \n \nYWO.49.H6\n \n0.404\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nThe Kd of YWO.49.H2 and YWO.49.H6 is higher for TAT226 expressed on the surface of OVCAR3 cells compared with recombinant TAT226-His (compare Kds for YWO.49.H2 and YWO.49.H6 in tables 2 and 3), indicating that YWO.49.H2 and YWO.49.H6 bind with slightly higher affinity to recombinant TAT226-His than to TAT226 expressed on the surface of OVCAR3 cells.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nF. TAT226 mRNA and Protein Expression\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTAT226 mRNA expression in OVCAR3 cells and in a panel of ovarian cancer samples was analyzed using a 5′ nuclease (TaqMan®) assay and real-time quantitative PCR. The ovarian cancer samples, designated “HF ####” in \nFIG. 16\n, were frozen tissue sections. RNA was isolated from the tissue sections, amplified using Ambion's Message Amp II kit (Ambion, Austin, Tex.), and reverse transcribed into cDNA. RNA was isolated from OVCAR3 cells and reverse-transcribed into cDNA. TAT226 cDNA was amplified by real-time PCR in the presence of a non-extendible, reporter probe specific for the amplification product. The threshold cycle or “Ct” (the cycle in which the signal generated from cleavage of the reporter probe exceeded background) was determined and used to calculate starting TAT226 mRNA levels. The level of TAT226 mRNA in the panel of ovarian cancer samples was expressed relative to the level of TAT226 mRNA in OVCAR3 cells, as shown in the bar graph in \nFIG. 16\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTAT226 protein expression in OVCAR3 cells and in the above panel of ovarian cancer samples was analyzed using immunohistochemistry (IHC) as follows. Tissue sections (frozen or paraffin-embedded) of the ovarian cancer samples were fixed for 5 minutes in acetone/ethanol. The sections were washed in PBS, blocked with avidin and biotin (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, Calif.) for 10 minutes each, and washed in PBS again. The sections were then blocked with 10% serum for 20 minutes and blotted to remove excess serum. Primary antibody (YWO.49.H2 or YWO.49.H6) was then added to the sections at a concentration of 10 μg/ml for 1 hour. The sections were then washed in PBS. Biotinylated secondary anti-human antibody was added to the sections for 30 minutes, and then the sections were washed with PBS. The sections were then exposed to the reagents of the Vector ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, Calif.) for 30 minutes and then washed in PBS. The sections were then exposed to diaminobenzidine (Pierce) for 5 minutes and then washed in PBS. The sections were then counterstained with Mayers hematoxylin, covered with a coverslip, and visualized. IHC was performed on OVCAR3 cells using the same protocol, except that the cells were first pelleted, frozen, and then sectioned. The sections were then subjected to the above protocol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results are reported qualitatively in \nFIG. 16\n, with expression levels categorized as “−”, “+/−”, or “+”. Generally, there was an overall correlation between the level of TAT226 mRNA expression and the expression of TAT226 protein on the surface of OVCAR3 cells. The IHC experiments also confirmed that the antibodies recognized TAT226 on the cell surface. The histology of each cell in the ovarian cancer cell panel is also reported in \nFIG. 16\n, with the abbreviation “adenoca.” denoting “adenocarcinoma.”\n\n\n \n \n \n \nG. Production of Anti-TAT226 ADCs\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-TAT226 ADCs were produced by conjugating YWO.49.H2 and YWO.49.H6 to the following drug-linker moieties: MC-vc-PAB-MMAE; MC-vc-PAB-MMAF; and MC-MMAF, which are depicted above in Section III.C.1.b.2. Prior to conjugation, the antibodies were partially reduced with TCEP using standard methods in accordance with the methodology described in WO 2004/010957 A2. The partially reduced antibodies were conjugated to the above drug-linker moieties using standard methods in accordance with the methodology described in Doronina et al. (2003) \nNat. Biotechnol. \n21:778-784 and US 2005/0238649 A1. Briefly, the partially reduced antibodies were combined with the drug linker moieties to allow conjugation of the moieties to cysteine residues.

Cell Killing Assays\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) were tested for the ability to inhibit proliferation of cells expressing TAT226 in the following in vitro and in vivo cell killing assays:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n1. OVCAR3 In Vitro Cell Killing Assay\n\n\n \n \n \n \nYWO.49.H2 and YWO.49.H6 ADCs were tested for the ability to inhibit proliferation of OVCAR3 cells. OVCAR3 cells were seeded in 96-well plates in RPMI with 20% FBS. OVCAR3 cells at a density of 3000 cells per well were incubated with varying concentrations of the ADCs, as shown in \nFIG. 17\n. Anti-MUC16/CA125 antibody conjugated to MC-vc-PAB-MMAE was used as a positive control. MUC16/CA125 is a known ovarian cancer antigen. See, e.g., Yin et al. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276:27371-27375. Anti-IL-8 antibody conjugated to MC-vc-PAB-MMAE was used as a negative control. After 5 days of incubation, cell viability was measured using the CellTiter-Glo™ Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega, Madison, Wis.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The scale on the y-axis of \nFIG. 17\n indicates the relative light units, or “RLUs,” from luciferase luminescence, which is a measure of cell viability.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 17\n shows that, similar to the positive control, YWO.49.H2-MC-vc-PAB-MMAF and YWO.49.H6-MC-vc-PAB-MMAF had marked cell killing activity, particularly at concentrations at and around 0.01 and 0.1 μg/ml. YWO.49.H2-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE and YWO.49.H6-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE also had cell killing activity, but to a lesser extent than seen with YWO.49.H2-MC-vc-PAB-MMAF and YWO.49.H6-MC-vc-PAB-MMAF. The IC\n50 \nfor YWO.49.H2-MC-vc-PAB-MMAF and YWO.49.H6-MC-vc-PAB-MMAF was about 0.005 nM, and the IC\n50 \nfor YWO.49.H2-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE and YWO.49.H6-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE was about 0.2 nM. The IC\n50 \nfor free MMAE was about 0.1 nM. YWO.49.H2-MC-MMAF and YWO.49.H6-MC-MMAF did not demonstrate significant cell killing activity in this assay. In this particular assay system, it is noted that at high concentrations of ADC, including negative control ADC, cell viability decreases substantially due to the overall high concentration of MMAE and MMAF.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n2. In Vitro Cell Killing Assay Using HCT116 Transfected Cells\n\n\n \n \n \n \nYWO.49.H2 and YWO.49.H6 ADCs were tested for the ability to inhibit proliferation of HCT116 cells, a colon cancer cell line, which had been stably transfected with nucleic acid encoding human TAT226. Untransfected HCT116 cells are normally about 5-6 fold less sensitive to free (unconjugated) MMAE than OVCAR3 cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBriefly, HCT116 cells were transfected as follows. Nucleic acid encoding epitope-tagged human TAT226 was constructed in the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). The epitope tag consisted of amino acids 1-53 of the herpes \nsimplex virus type\n 1 glycoprotein D (the “gD” tag), which replaced the signal sequence from amino acids 1-22 at the N-terminus of human TAT226. The recombinant vector was transfected into HCT116 cells using Lipofectamine200 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfected HCT116 cells were cultured in McCoy's 5a medium with 10% FBS and 0.4 mg/ml G418. Cells were stained using anti-gD antibodies and sorted by FACS to select for individual clones expressing recombinant gD:human TAT226 fusion protein. One of the clones, designated HCT116#9-4, was selected for further analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo perform the cell killing assay, HCT116#9-4 cells were seeded in 96-well plates. HCT116#9-4 cells at a density of 1000 cells per well were incubated with varying concentrations of the ADCs, as shown in \nFIG. 18\n. Anti-120 antibody conjugated to MC-vc-PAB-MMAE was used as a negative control. After 3 days of incubation, cell viability was measured using the CellTiter-Glo™ Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega, Madison, Wis.) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 18\n shows that YWO.49.H2-MC-vc-PAB-MMAF and YWO.49.H6-MC-vc-PAB-MMAF had marked cell killing activity, particularly at about 0.01 μg/ml and up to the highest concentrations tested. The IC\n50 \nfor YWO.49.H2-MC-vc-PAB-MMAF and YWO.49.H6-MC-vc-PAB-MMAF was about 0.05 nM, and the IC\n50 \nfor free MMAE was about 0.9 nM. YWO.49.H2-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE and YWO.49.H6-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE did not have substantial cell killing activity relative to the negative control in this particular assay. The difference between the cell killing activity of YWO.49.H2-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE and YWO.49.H6-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE in this assay compared to the OVCAR3 cell killing assay (above) may be attributable to a variety of factors, e.g., cell density and/or differences in drug sensitivity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is noted that for some other cell lines tested that normally express TAT226 mRNA or protein, YWO.49.H2 and YWO.49.H6 ADCs did not show significant cell killing activity. This could be due to a variety of factors, e.g., cell type-specific effects, levels of cell surface TAT226 expression, and/or differences in drug sensitivity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n3. In Vivo Assay Using HCT116#9-4 Xenograft\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn in vivo xenograft model was used to test unconjugated and conjugated YWO.49.H6 for the ability to inhibit proliferation of TAT226-expressing tumor cells in vivo. Tumors were induced in athymic nude “nu-nu” mice by subcutaneous injection of about 5×10\n6 \nHCT116#9-4 cells into the dorsal flanks of the mice. Tumors were allowed to grow until they reached a mean tumor volume of 200 mm\n3\n. That point in time was designated as “\nday\n 0.” As shown in \nFIG. 19\n, the mice received intravenous injections of 3 mg/kg of the indicated unconjugated antibodies or ADCs on \n \n \ndays\n \n \n 0, 7, and 16. Unconjugated and conjugated anti-ragweed antibodies (Ab) served as negative controls. Mean tumor volume was measured on \n \n \n \n \ndays\n \n \n \n \n 3, 7, 10, 16, and 21. As shown in \nFIG. 19\n, YWO.49.H6-MC-vc-PAB-MMAF showed significant tumor cell killing activity, as measured by mean tumor volume, compared to anti-ragweed Ab-MC-vc-PAB-MMAF in this particular xenograft model. YWO.49.H6-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE did not show significant tumor cell killing activity relative to anti-ragweed Ab-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE in this xenograft model. However, this xenograft model may not reflect the cell killing activity of YWO.49.H6-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE observed in vitro for a variety of factors, e.g., due to differences in drug sensitivity or expression levels of cell surface TAT226 in the xenograft tumor microenvironment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n4. Other Xenograft Models\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther xenograft models may be used to test unconjugated and conjugated anti-TAT226 antibodies for the ability to inhibit proliferation of TAT226-expressing tumor cells in vivo. For example, xenograft models for ovarian and brain tumors may be provided by public sources such as Oncotest GmbH (Frieberg, Germany) and Southern Research Institute (Birmingham, Ala.). The Oncotest models in particular were developed by growing patient tumors in immune-deficient nude mice. Xenografts that express TAT226 mRNA and/or protein may be useful for demonstrating cell killing activity of anti-TAT226 antibodies in vivo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConjugated YWO.49.H6 was tested in the Oncotest model OVXF1023 for the ability to inhibit proliferation of ovarian tumor cells in vivo. The Oncotest model OVXF1023 is derived from a metastasized poorly differentiated papillary serous adenomatous ovarian carcinoma, stage M1. OVXF1023 mice were treated with the ADCs indicated in \nFIG. 20\n. In \nFIG. 20\n, YWO.49.H6 is designated as “H6”; anti-ragweed (control) antibody is designated as “RW”; and the linker -MC-vc-PAB- is abbreviated as “vc.” The ADCs were administered on the days and at the concentrations indicated in \nFIG. 20\n. The results shown in \nFIG. 20\n indicate that YWO.49.H6-MC-vc-PAB-MMAF and YWO.49.H6-MC-MMAF significantly reduced tumor volume relative to the other ADCs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above experiment was repeated with OVXF1023 under similar conditions but with changes in dosing and in the control ADCs. In the repeat experiment, mice were treated with a higher dose (5 mg/kg) of YWO.49.H6-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE and with lower doses (5 mg/kg) of YWO.49.H6-MC-vc-PAB-MMAF and YWO.49.H6-MC-MMAF. The results demonstrated that the H6 ADCs (and in particular YWO.49.H6-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE) showed reduced tumor volume relative to their respective control ADCs (anti-gp120-MC-vc-PAB-MMAE at 6.4 mg/kg; anti-gp120-MC-vc-PAB-MMAF at 7.2 mg/kg; and anti-gp120-MC-MMAF at 5.4 mg/kg), although the difference in efficacy between the H6 ADCs and their respective control ADCs was not statistically significant for some data points. (Data not shown.) The difference between these results and the results obtained in the first OVXF1023 experiment may be attributable to the differences in dosing of the H6 ADCs and the observation that the control anti-gp120 ADCs showed unexpected activity in reducing tumor volume.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, the H6 ADCs were also tested in another Oncotest model, OVXF899, which is derived from a moderately differentiated papillary serous ovarian carcinoma (primary tumor). The H6 ADCs did not reduce tumor volume in this model. (Data not shown.) However, this particular Oncotest model showed low expression of TAT226, which may account for the observed results.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nI. ThioMAbs\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCysteine engineered antibodies, or “thioMAbs,” were created in which a selected residue of YWO.49.H6 was substituted with cysteine in order to provide an additional site for conjugation of a linker-drug moiety. Specifically, an A118C substitution (EU numbering) was made in the heavy chain of YWO.49.H6, or a V205C substitution (Kabat numbering) was made in the light chain of YWO.49.H6. The resulting A118C thioMAb was then conjugated to MC-MMAF, and the resulting V205C thioMAb was then conjugated to either MC-MMAF or MC-vc-PAB-MMAE. All thioMAbs were capable of binding to OVCAR3 cells by FACS analysis.

No. 61/185,712, filed Jun. 10, 2009; U.S. Ser. No. 61/228,373, filed Jul. 24, 2009; and U.S. Ser. No. 61/239,686, filed Sep. 3, 2009, each of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n \nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention relates to the field of therapeutic agent delivery using lipid particles. In particular, the invention provides cationic lipids and lipid particles comprising these lipids, which are advantageous for the in vivo delivery of nucleic acids, as well as nucleic acid-lipid particle compositions suitable for in vivo therapeutic use. Additionally, the invention provides methods of preparing these compositions, as well as methods of introducing nucleic acids into cells using these compositions, e.g., for the treatment of various disease conditions.\n\n\n \nDESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART\n\n\n \n \n \nTherapeutic nucleic acids include, e.g., small interfering RNA (siRNA), micro RNA (miRNA), antisense oligonucleotides, ribozymes, plasmids, and immune stimulating nucleic acids. These nucleic acids act via a variety of mechanisms. In the case of siRNA or miRNA, these nucleic acids can down-regulate intracellular levels of specific proteins through a process termed RNA interference (RNAi). Following introduction of siRNA or miRNA into the cell cytoplasm, these double-stranded RNA constructs can bind to a protein termed RISC. The sense strand of the siRNA or miRNA is displaced from the RISC complex providing a template within RISC that can recognize and bind mRNA with a complementary sequence to that of the bound siRNA or miRNA. Having bound the complementary mRNA the RISC complex cleaves the mRNA and releases the cleaved strands. RNAi can provide down-regulation of specific proteins by targeting specific destruction of the corresponding mRNA that encodes for protein synthesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe therapeutic applications of RNAi are extremely broad, since siRNA and miRNA constructs can be synthesized with any nucleotide sequence directed against a target protein. To date, siRNA constructs have shown the ability to specifically down-regulate target proteins in both in vitro and in vivo models. In addition, siRNA constructs are currently being evaluated in clinical studies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, two problems currently faced by siRNA or miRNA constructs are, first, their susceptibility to nuclease digestion in plasma and, second, their limited ability to gain access to the intracellular compartment where they can bind RISC when administered systemically as the free siRNA or miRNA. These double-stranded constructs can be stabilized by incorporation of chemically modified nucleotide linkers within the molecule, for example, phosphothioate groups. However, these chemical modifications provide only limited protection from nuclease digestion and may decrease the activity of the construct. Intracellular delivery of siRNA or miRNA can be facilitated by use of carrier systems such as polymers, cationic liposomes or by chemical modification of the construct, for example by the covalent attachment of cholesterol molecules. However, improved delivery systems are required to increase the potency of siRNA and miRNA molecules and reduce or eliminate the requirement for chemical modification.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntisense oligonucleotides and ribozymes can also inhibit mRNA translation into protein. In the case of antisense constructs, these single stranded deoxynucleic acids have a complementary sequence to that of the target protein mRNA and can bind to the mRNA by Watson-Crick base pairing. This binding either prevents translation of the target mRNA and/or triggers RNase H degradation of the mRNA transcripts. Consequently, antisense oligonucleotides have tremendous potential for specificity of action (i.e., down-regulation of a specific disease-related protein). To date, these compounds have shown promise in several in vitro and in vivo models, including models of inflammatory disease, cancer, and HIV (reviewed in Agrawal, \nTrends in Biotech. \n14:376-387 (1996)). Antisense can also affect cellular activity by hybridizing specifically with chromosomal DNA. Advanced human clinical assessments of several antisense drugs are currently underway. Targets for these drugs include the bcl2 and apolipoprotein B genes and mRNA products.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne well known problem with the use of therapeutic nucleic acids relates to the stability of the phosphodiester internucleotide linkage and the susceptibility of this linker to nucleases. The presence of exonucleases and endonucleases in serum results in the rapid digestion of nucleic acids possessing phosphodiester linkers and, hence, therapeutic nucleic acids can have very short half-lives in the presence of serum or within cells.

Erickson, R P and Izant, J G; Raven Press, NY (1992)). Therapeutic nucleic acid being currently being developed do not employ the basic phosphodiester chemistry found in natural nucleic acids, because of these and other known problems.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis problem has been partially overcome by chemical modifications that reduce serum or intracellular degradation. Modifications have been tested at the internucleotide phosphodiester bridge (e.g., using phosphorothioate, methylphosphonate or phosphoramidate linkages), at the nucleotide base (e.g., 5-propynyl-pyrimidines), or at the sugar (e.g., 2′-modified sugars) (Uhlmann E., et al. Antisense: Chemical Modifications. Encyclopedia of Cancer, Vol. X., pp 64-81 Academic Press Inc. (1997)). Others have attempted to improve stability using 2′-5′ sugar linkages (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,532,130). Other changes have been attempted. However, none of these solutions have proven entirely satisfactory, and in vivo free therapeutic nucleic acids still have only limited efficacy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, as noted above relating to siRNA and miRNA, problems remain with the limited ability of therapeutic nucleic acids to cross cellular membranes (see, Vlassov, et al., \nBiochim. Biophys. Acta \n1197:95-1082 (1994)) and in the problems associated with systemic toxicity, such as complement-mediated anaphylaxis, altered coagulatory properties, and cytopenia (Galbraith, et al., \nAntisense Nucl. Acid Drug Des. \n4:201-206 (1994)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn spite of recent progress, there remains a need in the art for improved lipid-therapeutic nucleic acid compositions that are suitable for general therapeutic use. Preferably, these compositions would encapsulate nucleic acids with high-efficiency, have high drug:lipid ratios, protect the encapsulated nucleic acid from degradation and clearance in serum, be suitable for systemic delivery, and provide intracellular delivery of the encapsulated nucleic acid. In addition, these lipid-nucleic acid particles should be well-tolerated and provide an adequate therapeutic index, such that patient treatment at an effective dose of the nucleic acid is not associated with significant toxicity and/or risk to the patient. The invention provides such compositions, methods of making the compositions, and methods of using the compositions to introduce nucleic acids into cells, including for the treatment of diseases.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention provides improved lipid formulations comprising a cationic lipid of formula A, a neutral lipid, a sterol and a PEG or PEG-modified lipid, wherein formula A is\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwhere R\n1 \nand R\n2 \nare independently alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl, each can be optionally substituted, and R\n3 \nand R\n4 \nare independently lower alkyl or R\n3 \nand R\n4 \ncan be taken together to form an optionally substituted heterocyclic ring.

Extrusion of liposome compositions through a small-pore polycarbonate membrane or an asymmetric ceramic membrane results in a relatively well-defined size distribution. Typically, the suspension is cycled through the membrane one or more times until the desired liposome complex size distribution is achieved. The liposomes may be extruded through successively smaller-pore membranes, to achieve a gradual reduction in liposome size. In some instances, the lipid-nucleic acid compositions which are formed can be used without any sizing. These methods are disclosed in the U.S. Pat. No. 5,008,050; U.S. Pat. No. 4,927,637; U.S. Pat.

formulations of the invention further comprise an apolipoprotein. As used herein, the term “apolipoprotein” or “lipoprotein” refers to apolipoproteins known to those of skill in the art and variants and fragments thereof and to apolipoprotein agonists, analogues or fragments thereof described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable apolipoproteins include, but are not limited to, ApoA-I, ApoA-II, ApoA-IV, ApoA-V and ApoE, and active polymorphic forms, isoforms, variants and mutants as well as fragments or truncated forms thereof. In certain embodiments, the apolipoprotein is a thiol containing apolipoprotein. “Thiol containing apolipoprotein” refers to an apolipoprotein, variant, fragment or isoform that contains at least one cysteine residue. The most common thiol containing apolipoproteins are ApoA-I Milano (ApoA-I\nM\n) and ApoA-I Paris (ApoA-I\nP\n) which contain one cysteine residue (Jia et al., 2002, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 297: 206-13; Bielicki and Oda, 2002, Biochemistry 41: 2089-96). ApoA-II, ApoE2 and ApoE3 are also thiol containing apolipoproteins. Isolated ApoE and/or active fragments and polypeptide analogues thereof, including recombinantly produced forms thereof, are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,672,685; 5,525,472; 5,473,039; 5,182,364; 5,177,189; 5,168,045; 5,116,739; the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference. ApoE3 is disclosed in Weisgraber, et al., “Human E apoprotein heterogeneity: cysteine-arginine interchanges in the amino acid sequence of the apo-E isoforms,” J. Biol. Chem. (1981) 256: 9077-9083; and Rall, et al., “Structural basis for receptor binding heterogeneity of apolipoprotein E from type III hyperlipoproteinemic subjects,” Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. (1982) 79: 4696-4700. See also GenBank accession number K00396.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the apolipoprotein can be in its mature form, in its preproapolipoprotein form or in its proapolipoprotein form. Homo- and heterodimers (where feasible) of pro- and mature ApoA-I (Duverger et al., 1996, Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 16(12):1424-29), ApoA-I Milano (Klon et al., 2000, Biophys. J. 79:(3)1679-87; Franceschini et al., 1985, J. Biol. Chem. 260: 1632-35), ApoA-I Paris (Daum et al., 1999, J. Mol. Med. 77:614-22), ApoA-II (Shelness et al., 1985, J. Biol. Chem. 260(14):8637-46; Shelness et al., 1984, J. Biol. Chem. 259(15):9929-35), ApoA-IV (Duverger et al., 1991, Euro. J. Biochem. 201(2):373-83), and ApoE (McLean et al., 1983, J. Biol. Chem. 258(14):8993-9000) can also be utilized within the scope of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the apolipoprotein can be a fragment, variant or isoform of the apolipoprotein. The term “fragment” refers to any apolipoprotein having an amino acid sequence shorter than that of a native apolipoprotein and which fragment retains the activity of native apolipoprotein, including lipid binding properties. By “variant” is meant substitutions or alterations in the amino acid sequences of the apolipoprotein, which substitutions or alterations, e.g., additions and deletions of amino acid residues, do not abolish the activity of native apolipoprotein, including lipid binding properties. Thus, a variant can comprise a protein or peptide having a substantially identical amino acid sequence to a native apolipoprotein provided herein in which one or more amino acid residues have been conservatively substituted with chemically similar amino acids. Examples of conservative substitutions include the substitution of at least one hydrophobic residue such as isoleucine, valine, leucine or methionine for another. Likewise, the present invention contemplates, for example, the substitution of at least one hydrophilic residue such as, for example, between arginine and lysine, between glutamine and asparagine, and between glycine and serine (see U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,004,925, 6,037,323 and 6,046,166). The term “isoform” refers to a protein having the same, greater or partial function and similar, identical or partial sequence, and may or may not be the product of the same gene and usually tissue specific (see Weisgraber 1990, J. Lipid Res. 31(8):1503-11; Hixson and Powers 1991, J. Lipid Res. 32(9):1529-35; Lackner et al., 1985, J. Biol. Chem. 260(2):703-6; Hoeg et al., 1986, J. Biol.

No. 6,372,886).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the methods and compositions of the present invention include the use of a chimeric construction of an apolipoprotein. For example, a chimeric construction of an apolipoprotein can be comprised of an apolipoprotein domain with high lipid binding capacity associated with an apolipoprotein domain containing ischemia reperfusion protective properties. A chimeric construction of an apolipoprotein can be a construction that includes separate regions within an apolipoprotein (i.e., homologous construction) or a chimeric construction can be a construction that includes separate regions between different apolipoproteins (i.e., heterologous constructions). Compositions comprising a chimeric construction can also include segments that are apolipoprotein variants or segments designed to have a specific character (e.g., lipid binding, receptor binding, enzymatic, enzyme activating, antioxidant or reduction-oxidation property) (see Weisgraber 1990, J.

Methods for obtaining apolipoproteins or equivalents thereof, utilized by the invention are well-known in the art. For example, apolipoproteins can be separated from plasma or natural products by, for example, density gradient centrifugation or immunoaffinity chromatography, or produced synthetically, semi-synthetically or using recombinant DNA techniques known to those of the art (see, e.g., Mulugeta et al., 1998, J. Chromatogr. 798(1-2): 83-90; Chung et al., 1980, J. Lipid Res. 21(3):284-91; Cheung et al., 1987, J. Lipid Res. 28(8):913-29; Persson, et al., 1998, J. Chromatogr. 711:97-109; U.S. Pat.

Nos. 6,004,925, 6,037,323 and 6,046,166. For example, the peptides may be prepared using the solid-phase synthetic technique initially described by Merrifield (1963, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 85:2149-2154). Other peptide synthesis techniques may be found in Bodanszky et al., Peptide Synthesis, John Wiley & Sons, 2d Ed., (1976) and other references readily available to those skilled in the art. A summary of polypeptide synthesis techniques can be found in Stuart and Young, Solid Phase Peptide. Synthesis, Pierce Chemical Company, Rockford, Ill., (1984). Peptides may also be synthesized by solution methods as described in The Proteins, Vol. II, 3d Ed., Neurath et. al., Eds., p. 105-237, Academic Press, New York, N.Y. (1976). Appropriate protective groups for use in different peptide syntheses are described in the above-mentioned texts as well as in McOmie, Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, Plenum Press, New York, N.Y. (1973). The peptides of the present invention might also be prepared by chemical or enzymatic cleavage from larger portions of, for example, apolipoprotein A-I.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the apolipoprotein can be a mixture of apolipoproteins. In one embodiment, the apolipoprotein can be a homogeneous mixture, that is, a single type of apolipoprotein. In another embodiment, the apolipoprotein can be a heterogeneous mixture of apolipoproteins, that is, a mixture of two or more different apolipoproteins. Embodiments of heterogenous mixtures of apolipoproteins can comprise, for example, a mixture of an apolipoprotein from an animal source and an apolipoprotein from a semi-synthetic source. In certain embodiments, a heterogenous mixture can comprise, for example, a mixture of ApoA-I and ApoA-I Milano. In certain embodiments, a heterogeneous mixture can comprise, for example, a mixture of ApoA-I Milano and ApoA-I Paris. Suitable mixtures for use in the methods and compositions of the invention will be apparent to one of skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf the apolipoprotein is obtained from natural sources, it can be obtained from a plant or animal source. If the apolipoprotein is obtained from an animal source, the apolipoprotein can be from any species. In certain embodiments, the apolipoprotien can be obtained from an animal source. In certain embodiments, the apolipoprotein can be obtained from a human source. In preferred embodiments of the invention, the apolipoprotein is derived from the same species as the individual to which the apolipoprotein is administered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the target gene is selected from the group consisting of Factor VII, Eg5, PCSK9, TPX2, apoB, SAA, TTR, RSV, PDGF beta gene, Erb-B gene, Src gene, CRK gene, GRB2 gene, RAS gene, MEKK gene, JNK gene, RAF gene, Erk1/2 gene, PCNA(p21) gene, MYB gene, JUN gene, FOS gene, BCL-2 gene, Cyclin D gene, VEGF gene, EGFR gene, Cyclin A gene, Cyclin E gene, WNT-1 gene, beta-catenin gene, c-MET gene, PKC gene, NFKB gene, STAT3 gene, survivin gene, Her2/Neu gene, topoisomerase I gene, topoisomerase II alpha gene, p73 gene, p21(WAF1/CIP1) gene, p27(KIP1) gene, PPM1D gene, RAS gene, caveolin I gene, MIB I gene, MTAI gene, M68 gene, mutations in tumor suppressor genes, p53 tumor suppressor gene, and combinations thereof. In one embodiment the target gene is a gene expressed in the liver, e.g., the Factor VII (FVII) gene. The effect of the expression of the target gene, e.g., FVII, is evaluated by measuring FVII levels in a biological sample, such as a serum or tissue sample. For example, the level of FVII, e.g., as measured by assay of FVII activity, in blood can be determined. In one embodiment, the level of mRNA in the liver can be evaluated. In another preferred embodiment, at least two types of evaluation are made, e.g., an evaluation of protein level (e.g., in blood), and a measure of mRNA level (e.g., in the liver) are both made.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the agent is a nucleic acid, such as a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the nucleic acid agent is a single-stranded DNA or RNA, or double-stranded DNA or RNA, or DNA-RNA hybrid. For example, a double-stranded DNA can be a structural gene, a gene including control and termination regions, or a self-replicating system such as a viral or plasmid DNA. A double-stranded RNA can be, e.g., a dsRNA or another RNA interference reagent. A single-stranded nucleic acid can be, e.g., an antisense oligonucleotide, ribozyme, microRNA, or triplex-forming oligonucleotide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment, at various time points after administration of a candidate agent, a biological sample, such as a fluid sample, e.g., blood, plasma, or serum, or a tissue sample, such as a liver sample, is taken from the test subject and tested for an effect of the agent on target protein or mRNA expression levels. In one particularly preferred embodiment, the candidate agent is a dsRNA that targets FVII, and the biological sample is tested for an effect on Factor VII protein or mRNA levels. In one embodiment, plasma levels of FVII protein are assayed, such as by using an immunohistochemistry assay or a chromogenic assay. In another embodiment, levels of FVII mRNA in the liver are tested by an assay, such as a branched DNA assay, or a Northern blot or RT-PCR assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the agent, e.g., a composition including the improved lipid formulation, is evaluated for toxicity. In yet another embodiment, the model subject can be monitored for physical effects, such as by a change in weight or cageside behavior.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the method further includes subjecting the agent, e.g., a composition comprising the improved lipid formulation, to a further evaluation. The further evaluation can include, for example, (i) a repetition of the evaluation described above, (ii) a repetition of the evaluation described above with a different number of animals or with different doses, or (iii) by a different method, e.g., evaluation in another animal model, e.g., a non-human primate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, a decision is made regarding whether or not to include the agent and the improved lipid formulation in further studies, such as in a clinical trial, depending on the observed effect of the candidate agent on liver protein or mRNA levels. For example, if a candidate dsRNA is observed to decrease protein or mRNA levels by at least 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, or more, then the agent can be considered for a clinical trial.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment, a decision is made regarding whether or not to include the agent and the improved lipid formulation in a pharmaceutical composition, depending on the observed effect of the candidate agent and amino lipid on liver protein or mRNA levels. For example, if a candidate dsRNA is observed to decrease protein or mRNA levels by at least 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, or more, then the agent can be considered for a clinical trial.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention features a method of evaluating the improved lipid formulation for its suitability for delivering an RNA-based construct, e.g., a dsRNA that targets FVII. The method includes providing a composition that includes a dsRNA that targets FVII and a candidate amino lipid, administering the composition to a rodent, e.g., a mouse, evaluating the expression of FVII as a function of at least one of the level of FVII in the blood or the level of FVII mRNA in the liver, thereby evaluating the candidate amino lipid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions that include lipid containing components, such as a liposome, and these are described in greater detail below. Exemplary nucleic acid-based agents include dsRNAs, antisense oligonucleotides, ribozymes, microRNAs, immunostimulatory oligonucleotides, or triplex-forming oligonucleotides. These agents are also described in greater detail below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Alkyl” means a straight chain or branched, noncyclic or cyclic, saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon containing from 1 to 24 carbon atoms.

Representative straight chain and branched alkynyls include acetylenyl, propynyl, l-butynyl, 2-butynyl, 1-pentynyl, 2-pentynyl, 3-methyl-1 butynyl, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Acyl” means any alkyl, alkenyl, or alkynyl wherein the carbon at the point of attachment is substituted with an oxo group, as defined below. For example, —C(═O)alkyl, —C(═O)alkenyl, and —C(═O)alkynyl are acyl groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Heterocycle” means a 5- to 7-membered monocyclic, or 7- to 10-membered bicyclic, heterocyclic ring which is either saturated, unsaturated, or aromatic, and which contains from 1 or 2 heteroatoms independently selected from nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur, and wherein the nitrogen and sulfur heteroatoms may be optionally oxidized, and the nitrogen heteroatom may be optionally quaternized, including bicyclic rings in which any of the above heterocycles are fused to a benzene ring. The heterocycle may be attached via any heteroatom or carbon atom. Heterocycles include heteroaryls as defined below.

Protecting group methodology is well known to those skilled in the art (see, for example, P\nROTECTIVE \nG\nROUPS IN \nO\nRGANIC \nS\nYNTHESIS\n, Green, T. W. et. al., Wiley-Interscience, New York City, 1999). Briefly, protecting groups within the context of this invention are any group that reduces or eliminates unwanted reactivity of a functional group. A protecting group can be added to a functional group to mask its reactivity during certain reactions and then removed to reveal the original functional group. In some embodiments an “alcohol protecting group” is used. An “alcohol protecting group” is any group which decreases or eliminates unwanted reactivity of an alcohol functional group. Protecting groups can be added and removed using techniques well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSynthesis\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention may be prepared by known organic synthesis techniques, including the methods described in more detail in the Examples. In general, the lipid of formula A above may be made by the following \n \nReaction Schemes\n \n 1 or 2 while the Folate-PEG2000-DSG and Folate-PEG3400-DSG described herein may be produced as in \n \nReaction Schemes\n \n 3 and 4, wherein all substituents are as defined herein unless indicated otherwise.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLipid A, where R\n1 \nand R\n2 \nare independently alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl, each can be optionally substituted, and R\n3 \nand R\n4 \nare independently lower alkyl or R\n3 \nand R\n4 \ncan be taken together to form an optionally sub situted heterocyclic ring, can be prepared according to \nScheme\n 1. \nKetone\n 1 and \nbromide\n 2 can be purchased or prepared according to methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Reaction of 1 and 2 \nyields ketal\n 3. Treatment of 3 with \namine\n 4 yields lipids of formula A. The lipids of formula A can be converted to the corresponding ammonium salt with an organic salt of \nformula\n 5, where X is anion counter ion selected from halogen, hydroxide, phosphate, sulfate, or the like.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the \nketone\n 1 starting material can be prepared according to \nScheme\n 2. Grignard reagent 6 and cyanide 7 can be purchased or prepared according to methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Reaction of 6 and 7 \nyields ketone\n 1. Conversion of \nketone\n 1 to the corresponding lipids of formula A is as described in \nScheme\n 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino lipids are of the invention are cationic lipids. As used herein, the term “amino lipid” is meant to include those lipids having one or two fatty acid or fatty alkyl chains and an amino head group (including an alkylamino or dialkylamino group) that may be protonated to form a cationic lipid at physiological pH.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther amino lipids would include those having alternative fatty acid groups and other dialkylamino groups, including those in which the alkyl substituents are different (e.g., N-ethyl-N-methylamino-, N-propyl-N-ethylamino- and the like). For those embodiments in which R\n11 \nand R\n12 \nare both long chain alkyl or acyl groups, they can be the same or different. In general, amino lipids having less saturated acyl chains are more easily sized, particularly when the complexes must be sized below about 0.3 microns, for purposes of filter sterilization. Amino lipids containing unsaturated fatty acids with carbon chain lengths in the range of C\n14 \nto C\n22 \nare preferred. Other scaffolds can also be used to separate the amino group and the fatty acid or fatty alkyl portion of the amino lipid. Suitable scaffolds are known to those of skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, amino or cationic lipids of the invention have at least one protonatable or deprotonatable group, such that the lipid is positively charged at a pH at or below physiological pH (e.g. pH 7.4), and neutral at a second pH, preferably at or above physiological pH. It will, of course, be understood that the addition or removal of protons as a function of pH is an equilibrium process, and that the reference to a charged or a neutral lipid refers to the nature of the predominant species and does not require that all of the lipid be present in the charged or neutral form. Lipids that have more than one protonatable or deprotonatable group, or which are zwiterrionic, are not excluded from use in the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, protonatable lipids according to the invention have a pKa of the protonatable group in the range of about 4 to about 11. Most preferred is pKa of about 4 to about 7, because these lipids will be cationic at a lower pH formulation stage, while particles will be largely (though not completely) surface neutralized at physiological pH around pH 7.4. One of the benefits of this pKa is that at least some nucleic acid associated with the outside surface of the particle will lose its electrostatic interaction at physiological pH and be removed by simple dialysis; thus greatly reducing the particle's susceptibility to clearance.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nCoupling of the amino PEG derivative with the appropriate alcohol proceeded under standard conditions with disuccinimidyl carbonate (DSC) in the presence of base to produce expected functionalized PEG. Folic acid is subsequently reacted with the other end of the functionalized PEG under standard amide coupling conditions to produce protected Folate-PEG2000-DSG. Removal of each of the protecting groups proceeded in the presence of Lithium Hydroxide to provide the desired Folate-PEG2000-DSG.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA corresponding functionalized PEG3400 was coupled under standard conditions to provide the desired Folate-PEG3400-DSG.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLipid Particles\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe agents and/or amino lipids for testing in the liver screening model featured herein can be formulated in lipid particles. Lipid particles include, but are not limited to, liposomes. As used herein, a liposome is a structure having lipid-containing membranes enclosing an aqueous interior. Liposomes may have one or more lipid membranes. The invention contemplates both single-layered liposomes, which are referred to as unilamellar, and multi-layered liposomes, which are referred to as multilamellar. When complexed with nucleic acids, lipid particles may also be lipoplexes, which are composed of cationic lipid bilayers sandwiched between DNA layers, as described, e.g., in Felgner, \nScientific American. \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nLipid particles may further include one or more additional lipids and/or other components such as cholesterol. Other lipids may be included in the liposome compositions for a variety of purposes, such as to prevent lipid oxidation or to attach ligands onto the liposome surface. Any of a number of lipids may be present, including amphipathic, neutral, cationic, and anionic lipids. Such lipids can be used alone or in combination. Specific examples of additional lipid components that may be present are described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional components that may be present in a lipid particle include bilayer stabilizing components such as polyamide oligomers (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,320,017), peptides, proteins, detergents, lipid-derivatives, such as PEG coupled to phosphatidylethanolamine and PEG conjugated to ceramides (see, U.S. Pat. No. 5,885,613). In some embodiments, the lipid particle includes a targeting agent such as a targeting lipid described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA lipid particle can include one or more of a second amino lipid or cationic lipid, a neutral lipid, a sterol, and a lipid selected to reduce aggregation of lipid particles during formation, which may result from steric stabilization of particles which prevents charge-induced aggregation during formation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of lipids suitable for conjugation to nucleic acid agents that can be used in the liver screening model are polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified lipids, monosialoganglioside Gml, and polyamide oligomers (“PAO”) such as (described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,320,017). Other compounds with uncharged, hydrophilic, steric-barrier moieties, which prevent aggregation during formulation, like PEG, Gm1 or ATTA, can also be coupled to lipids for use as in the methods and compositions of the invention. ATTA-lipids are described, e.g., in U.S. Pat. No. 6,320,017, and PEG-lipid conjugates are described, e.g., in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,820,873, 5,534,499 and 5,885,613. Typically, the concentration of the lipid component selected to reduce aggregation is about 1 to 15% (by mole percent of lipids).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecific examples of PEG-modified lipids (or lipid-polyoxyethylene conjugates) that are useful in the invention can have a variety of “anchoring” lipid portions to secure the PEG portion to the surface of the lipid vesicle. Examples of suitable PEG-modified lipids include PEG-modified phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidic acid, PEG-ceramide conjugates (e.g., PEG-CerC14 or PEG-CerC20) which are described in co-pending U.S. Ser. No. 08/486,214, incorporated herein by reference, PEG-modified dialkylamines and PEG-modified 1,2-diacyloxypropan-3-amines. Particularly preferred are PEG-modified diacylglycerols and dialkylglycerols. In some embodiments, the total mol % of PEG lipids within a particle is about 1.5 mol %. For example, when the particle includes a plurality of PEG lipids described herein such as a PEG-modified lipid as described above and a targeting lipid containing a PEG, the total amount of the PEG containing lipids when taken together is about 1.5 mol %.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn embodiments where a sterically-large moiety such as PEG or ATTA are conjugated to a lipid anchor, the selection of the lipid anchor depends on what type of association the conjugate is to have with the lipid particle. It is well known that mePEG (mw2000)-diastearoylphosphatidylethanolamine (PEG-DSPE) will remain associated with a liposome until the particle is cleared from the circulation, possibly a matter of days. Other conjugates, such as PEG-CerC20 have similar staying capacity. PEG-CerC14, however, rapidly exchanges out of the formulation upon exposure to serum, with a T\n1/2 \nless than 60 mins. in some assays. As illustrated in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/486,214, at least three characteristics influence the rate of exchange: length of acyl chain, saturation of acyl chain, and size of the steric-barrier head group. Compounds having suitable variations of these features may be useful for the invention. For some therapeutic applications it may be preferable for the PEG-modified lipid to be rapidly lost from the nucleic acid-lipid particle in vivo and hence the PEG-modified lipid will possess relatively short lipid anchors. In other therapeutic applications it may be preferable for the nucleic acid-lipid particle to exhibit a longer plasma circulation lifetime and hence the PEG-modified lipid will possess relatively longer lipid anchors. Exemplary lipid anchors include those having lengths of from about C\n14 \nto about C\n22\n, preferably from about C\n14 \nto about C\n16\n. In some embodiments, a PEG moiety, for example an mPEG-NH\n2\n, has a size of about 1000, 2000, 5000, 10,000, 15,000 or 20,000 daltons.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt should be noted that aggregation preventing compounds do not necessarily require lipid conjugation to function properly. Free PEG or free ATTA in solution may be sufficient to prevent aggregation. If the particles are stable after formulation, the PEG or ATTA can be dialyzed away before administration to a subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNeutral lipids, when present in the lipid particle, can be any of a number of lipid species which exist either in an uncharged or neutral zwitterionic form at physiological pH. Such lipids include, for example diacylphosphatidylcholine, diacylphosphatidylethanolamine, ceramide, sphingomyelin, dihydrosphingomyelin, cephalin, and cerebrosides. The selection of neutral lipids for use in the particles described herein is generally guided by consideration of, e.g., liposome size and stability of the liposomes in the bloodstream. Preferably, the neutral lipid component is a lipid having two acyl groups, (i.e., diacylphosphatidylcholine and diacylphosphatidylethanolamine). Lipids having a variety of acyl chain groups of varying chain length and degree of saturation are available or may be isolated or synthesized by well-known techniques. In one group of embodiments, lipids containing saturated fatty acids with carbon chain lengths in the range of C\n14 \nto C\n22 \nare preferred. In another group of embodiments, lipids with mono or diunsaturated fatty acids with carbon chain lengths in the range of C\n14 \nto C\n22 \nare used. Additionally, lipids having mixtures of saturated and unsaturated fatty acid chains can be used. Preferably, the neutral lipids used in the invention are DOPE, DSPC, DPPC, POPC, or any related phosphatidylcholine. The neutral lipids useful in the invention may also be composed of sphingomyelin, dihydrosphingomyeline, or phospholipids with other head groups, such as serine and inositol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe sterol component of the lipid mixture, when present, can be any of those sterols conventionally used in the field of liposome, lipid vesicle or lipid particle preparation. A preferred sterol is cholesterol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther cationic lipids, which carry a net positive charge at about physiological pH, in addition to those specifically described above, may also be included in lipid particles of the invention. Such cationic lipids include, but are not limited to, N,N-dioleyl-N,N-dimethylammonium chloride (“DODAC”); N-(2,3-dioleyloxy)propyl-N,N—N-triethylammonium chloride (“DOTMA”); N,N-distearyl-N,N-dimethylammonium bromide (“DDAB”); N-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl)-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride (“DOTAP”); 1,2-Dioleyloxy-3-trimethylaminopropane chloride salt (“DOTAP.Cl”); 3β-(N—(N′,N′-dimethylaminoethane)-carbamoyl)cholesterol (“DC-Chol”), N-(1-(2,3-dioleyloxy)propyl)-N-2-(sperminecarboxamido)ethyl)-N,N-dimethylammonium trifluoracetate (“DOSPA”), dioctadecylamidoglycyl carboxyspermine (“DOGS”), 1,2-dileoyl-sn-3-phosphoethanolamine (“DOPE”), 1,2-dioleoyl-3-dimethylammonium propane (“DODAP”), N,N-dimethyl-2,3-dioleyloxy)propylamine (“DODMA”), and N-(1,2-dimyristyloxyprop-3-yl)-N,N-dimethyl-N-hydroxyethyl ammonium bromide (“DMRIE”). Additionally, a number of commercial preparations of cationic lipids can be used, such as, e.g., LIPOFECTIN (including DOTMA and DOPE, available from GIBCO/BRL), and LIPOFECTAMINE (comprising DOSPA and DOPE, available from GIBCO/BRL). In particular embodiments, a cationic lipid is an amino lipid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnionic lipids suitable for use in lipid particles of the invention include, but are not limited to, phosphatidylglycerol, cardiolipin, diacylphosphatidylserine, diacylphosphatidic acid, N-dodecanoyl phosphatidylethanoloamine, N-succinyl phosphatidylethanolamine, N-glutaryl phosphatidylethanolamine, lysylphosphatidylglycerol, and other anionic modifying groups joined to neutral lipids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn numerous embodiments, amphipathic lipids are included in lipid particles of the invention. “Amphipathic lipids” refer to any suitable material, wherein the hydrophobic portion of the lipid material orients into a hydrophobic phase, while the hydrophilic portion orients toward the aqueous phase. Such compounds include, but are not limited to, phospholipids, aminolipids, and sphingolipids. Representative phospholipids include sphingomyelin, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidic acid, palmitoyloleoyl phosphatdylcholine, lysophosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylethanolamine, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC), distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC), or dilinoleylphosphatidylcholine. Other phosphorus-lacking compounds, such as sphingolipids, glycosphingolipid families, diacylglycerols, and β-acyloxyacids, can also be used. Additionally, such amphipathic lipids can be readily mixed with other lipids, such as triglycerides and sterols.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso suitable for inclusion in the lipid particles of the invention are programmable fusion lipids. Such lipid particles have little tendency to fuse with cell membranes and deliver their payload until a given signal event occurs. This allows the lipid particle to distribute more evenly after injection into an organism or disease site before it starts fusing with cells. The signal event can be, for example, a change in pH, temperature, ionic environment, or time. In the latter case, a fusion delaying or “cloaking” component, such as an ATTA-lipid conjugate or a PEG-lipid conjugate, can simply exchange out of the lipid particle membrane over time. Exemplary lipid anchors include those having lengths of from about C\n14 \nto about C\n22\n, preferably from about C\n14 \nto about C\n16\n. In some embodiments, a PEG moiety, for example an mPEG-NH\n2\n, has a size of about 1000, 2000, 5000, 10,000, 15,000 or 20,000 daltons.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy the time the lipid particle is suitably distributed in the body, it has lost sufficient cloaking agent so as to be fusogenic. With other signal events, it is desirable to choose a signal that is associated with the disease site or target cell, such as increased temperature at a site of inflammation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA lipid particle conjugated to a nucleic acid agent can also include a targeting moiety, e.g., a targeting moiety that is specific to a cell type or tissue. Targeting of lipid particles using a variety of targeting moieties, such as ligands, cell surface receptors, glycoproteins, vitamins (e.g., riboflavin) and monoclonal antibodies, has been previously described (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,957,773 and 4,603,044). Exexmplary targeting moieties include a targeting lipid such as a targeting lipid described herein. In some embodiments, the targeting lipid is a GalNAc containing targeting lipid such as GalNAc3-DSG and GalNAc3-PEG-DSG as described herein. The targeting moieties can include the entire protein or fragments thereof. Targeting mechanisms generally require that the targeting agents be positioned on the surface of the lipid particle in such a manner that the targeting moiety is available for interaction with the target, for example, a cell surface receptor. A variety of different targeting agents and methods are known and available in the art, including those described, e.g., in Sapra, P. and Allen, T M, \nProg. Lipid Res. \n42(5):439-62 (2003); and Abra, R M et al., \nJ. Liposome Res. \n12:1-3, (2002).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe use of lipid particles, i.e., liposomes, with a surface coating of hydrophilic polymer chains, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains, for targeting has been proposed (Allen, et al., \nBiochimica et Biophysica Acta \n1237: 99-108 (1995); DeFrees, et al., \nJournal of the American Chemistry Society \n118: 6101-6104 (1996); Blume, et al., \nBiochimica et Biophysica Acta \n1149: 180-184 (1993); Klibanov, et al., \nJournal of Liposome Research \n2: 321-334 (1992); U.S. Pat. No. 5,013,556; Zalipsky, \nBioconjugate Chemistry \n4: 296-299 (1993); Zalipsky, \nFEBS Letters \n353: 71-74 (1994); Zalipsky, in Stealth Liposomes Chapter 9 (Lasic and Martin, Eds) CRC Press, Boca Raton Fla. (1995). In one approach, a ligand, such as an antibody, for targeting the lipid particle is linked to the polar head group of lipids forming the lipid particle. In another approach, the targeting ligand is attached to the distal ends of the PEG chains forming the hydrophilic polymer coating (Klibanov, et al., \nJournal of Liposome Research \n2: 321-334 (1992); Kirpotin et al., \nFEBS Letters \n388: 115-118 (1996)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStandard methods for coupling the target agents can be used. For example, phosphatidylethanolamine, which can be activated for attachment of target agents, or derivatized lipophilic compounds, such as lipid-derivatized bleomycin, can be used. Antibody-targeted liposomes can be constructed using, for instance, liposomes that incorporate protein A (see, Renneisen, et al., \nJ. Bio. Chem., \n265:16337-16342 (1990) and Leonetti, et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci\n. (\nUSA\n), 87:2448-2451 (1990). Other examples of antibody conjugation are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,027,726, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference. Examples of targeting moieties can also include other proteins, specific to cellular components, including antigens associated with neoplasms or tumors. Proteins used as targeting moieties can be attached to the liposomes via covalent bonds (see, Heath, \nCovalent Attachment of Proteins to Liposomes, \n149 \nMethods in Enzymology \n111-119 (Academic Press, Inc. 1987)). Other targeting methods include the biotin-avidin system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherapeutic Agent-Lipid Particle Compositions and Formulations\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention includes compositions comprising a lipid particle of the invention and an active agent, wherein the active agent is associated with the lipid particle. In particular embodiments, the active agent is a therapeutic agent. In particular embodiments, the active agent is encapsulated within an aqueous interior of the lipid particle. In other embodiments, the active agent is present within one or more lipid layers of the lipid particle. In other embodiments, the active agent is bound to the exterior or interior lipid surface of a lipid particle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Fully encapsulated” as used herein indicates that the nucleic acid in the particles is not significantly degraded after exposure to serum or a nuclease assay that would significantly degrade free DNA. In a fully encapsulated system, preferably less than 25% of particle nucleic acid is degraded in a treatment that would normally degrade 100% of free nucleic acid, more preferably less than 10% and most preferably less than 5% of the particle nucleic acid is degraded. Alternatively, full encapsulation may be determined by an Oligreen® assay. Oligreen® is an ultra-sensitive fluorescent nucleic acid stain for quantitating oligonucleotides and single-stranded DNA in solution (available from Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, Calif.). Fully encapsulated also suggests that the particles are serum stable, that is, that they do not rapidly decompose into their component parts upon in vivo administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nActive agents, as used herein, include any molecule or compound capable of exerting a desired effect on a cell, tissue, organ, or subject. Such effects may be biological, physiological, or cosmetic, for example. Active agents may be any type of molecule or compound, including e.g., nucleic acids, peptides and polypeptides, including, e.g., antibodies, such as, e.g., polyclonal antibodies, monoclonal antibodies, antibody fragments; humanized antibodies, recombinant antibodies, recombinant human antibodies, and Primatized™ antibodies, cytokines, growth factors, apoptotic factors, differentiation-inducing factors, cell surface receptors and their ligands; hormones; and small molecules, including small organic molecules or compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the active agent is a therapeutic agent, or a salt or derivative thereof. Therapeutic agent derivatives may be therapeutically active themselves or they may be prodrugs, which become active upon further modification. Thus, in one embodiment, a therapeutic agent derivative retains some or all of the therapeutic activity as compared to the unmodified agent, while in another embodiment, a therapeutic agent derivative lacks therapeutic activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn various embodiments, therapeutic agents include any therapeutically effective agent or drug, such as anti-inflammatory compounds, anti-depressants, stimulants, analgesics, antibiotics, birth control medication, antipyretics, vasodilators, anti-angiogenics, cytovascular agents, signal transduction inhibitors, cardiovascular drugs, e.g., anti-arrhythmic agents, vasoconstrictors, hormones, and steroids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the therapeutic agent is an oncology drug, which may also be referred to as an anti-tumor drug, an anti-cancer drug, a tumor drug, an antineoplastic agent, or the like. Examples of oncology drugs that may be used according to the invention include, but are not limited to, adriamycin, alkeran, allopurinol, altretamine, amifostine, anastrozole, araC, arsenic trioxide, azathioprine, bexarotene, biCNU, bleomycin, busulfan intravenous, busulfan oral, capecitabine (Xeloda), carboplatin, carmustine, CCNU, celecoxib, chlorambucil, cisplatin, cladribine, cyclosporin A, cytarabine, cytosine arabinoside, daunorubicin, cytoxan, daunorubicin, dexamethasone, dexrazoxane, dodetaxel, doxorubicin, doxorubicin, DTIC, epirubicin, estramustine, etoposide phosphate, etoposide and VP-16, exemestane, FK506, fludarabine, fluorouracil, 5-FU, gemcitabine (Gemzar), gemtuzumab-ozogamicin, goserelin acetate, hydrea, hydroxyurea, idarubicin, ifosfamide, imatinib mesylate, interferon, irinotecan (Camptostar, CPT-111), letrozole, leucovorin, leustatin, leuprolide, levamisole, litretinoin, megastrol, melphalan, L-PAM, mesna, methotrexate, methoxsalen, mithramycin, mitomycin, mitoxantrone, nitrogen mustard, paclitaxel, pamidronate, Pegademase, pentostatin, porfimer sodium, prednisone, rituxan, streptozocin, STI-571, tamoxifen, taxotere, temozolamide, teniposide, VM-26, topotecan (Hycamtin), toremifene, tretinoin, ATRA, valrubicin, velban, vinblastine, vincristine, VP16, and vinorelbine. Other examples of oncology drugs that may be used according to the invention are ellipticin and ellipticin analogs or derivatives, epothilones, intracellular kinase inhibitors and camptothecins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic Acid-Lipid Particles\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, lipid particles of the invention are associated with a nucleic acid, resulting in a nucleic acid-lipid particle. In particular embodiments, the nucleic acid is fully encapsulated in the lipid particle. As used herein, the term “nucleic acid” is meant to include any oligonucleotide or polynucleotide. Fragments containing up to 50 nucleotides are generally termed oligonucleotides, and longer fragments are called polynucleotides. In particular embodiments, oligonucletoides of the invention are 20-50 nucleotides in length.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the context of this invention, the terms “polynucleotide” and “oligonucleotide” refer to a polymer or oligomer of nucleotide or nucleoside monomers consisting of naturally occurring bases, sugars and intersugar (backbone) linkages. The terms “polynucleotide” and “oligonucleotide” also includes polymers or oligomers comprising non-naturally occurring monomers, or portions thereof, which function similarly. Such modified or substituted oligonucleotides are often preferred over native forms because of properties such as, for example, enhanced cellular uptake and increased stability in the presence of nucleases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOligonucleotides are classified as deoxyribooligonucleotides or ribooligonucleotides. A deoxyribooligonucleotide consists of a 5-carbon sugar called deoxyribose joined covalently to phosphate at the 5′ and 3′ carbons of this sugar to form an alternating, unbranched polymer. A ribooligonucleotide consists of a similar repeating structure where the 5-carbon sugar is ribose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nucleic acid that is present in a lipid-nucleic acid particle according to this invention includes any form of nucleic acid that is known. The nucleic acids used herein can be single-stranded DNA or RNA, or double-stranded DNA or RNA, or DNA-RNA hybrids. Examples of double-stranded DNA include structural genes, genes including control and termination regions, and self-replicating systems such as viral or plasmid DNA. Examples of double-stranded RNA include siRNA and other RNA interference reagents. Single-stranded nucleic acids include, e.g., antisense oligonucleotides, ribozymes, microRNA, and triplex-forming oligonucleotides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acids of the invention may be of various lengths, generally dependent upon the particular form of nucleic acid. For example, in particular embodiments, plasmids or genes may be from about 1,000 to 100,000 nucleotide residues in length. In particular embodiments, oligonucleotides may range from about 10 to 100 nucleotides in length. In various related embodiments, oligonucleotides, both single-stranded, double-stranded, and triple-stranded, may range in length from about 10 to about 50 nucleotides, from about 20 to about 50 nucleotides, from about 15 to about 30 nucleotides, from about 20 to about 30 nucleotides in length.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular embodiments, an oligonucleotide (or a strand thereof) of the invention specifically hybridizes to or is complementary to a target polynucleotide. “Specifically hybridizable” and “complementary” are terms which are used to indicate a sufficient degree of complementarity such that stable and specific binding occurs between the DNA or RNA target and the oligonucleotide. It is understood that an oligonucleotide need not be 100% complementary to its target nucleic acid sequence to be specifically hybridizable. An oligonucleotide is specifically hybridizable when binding of the oligonucleotide to the target interferes with the normal function of the target molecule to cause a loss of utility or expression therefrom, and there is a sufficient degree of complementarity to avoid non-specific binding of the oligonucleotide to non-target sequences under conditions in which specific binding is desired, i.e., under physiological conditions in the case of in vivo assays or therapeutic treatment, or, in the case of in vitro assays, under conditions in which the assays are conducted. Thus, in other embodiments, this oligonucleotide includes 1, 2, or 3 base substitutions as compared to the region of a gene or mRNA sequence that it is targeting or to which it specifically hybridizes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRNA Interference Nucleic Acids\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular embodiments, nucleic acid-lipid particles of the invention are associated with RNA interference (RNAi) molecules. RNA interference methods using RNAi molecules may be used to disrupt the expression of a gene or polynucleotide of interest. In the last 5 years small interfering RNA (siRNA) has essentially replaced antisense ODN and ribozymes as the next generation of targeted oligonucleotide drugs under development. SiRNAs are RNA duplexes normally 21-30 nucleotides long that can associate with a cytoplasmic multi-protein complex known as RNAi-induced silencing complex (RISC). RISC loaded with siRNA mediates the degradation of homologous mRNA transcripts, therefore siRNA can be designed to knock down protein expression with high specificity. Unlike other antisense technologies, siRNA function through a natural mechanism evolved to control gene expression through non-coding RNA. This is generally considered to be the reason why their activity is more potent in vitro and in vivo than either antisense ODN or ribozymes. A variety of RNAi reagents, including siRNAs targeting clinically relevant targets, are currently under pharmaceutical development, as described, e.g., in de Fougerolles, A. et al., Nature Reviews 6:443-453 (2007).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile the first described RNAi molecules were RNA:RNA hybrids comprising both an RNA sense and an RNA antisense strand, it has now been demonstrated that DNA sense:RNA antisense hybrids, RNA sense:DNA antisense hybrids, and DNA:DNA hybrids are capable of mediating RNAi (Lamberton, J. S, and Christian, A. T., (2003) Molecular Biotechnology 24:111-119). Thus, the invention includes the use of RNAi molecules comprising any of these different types of double-stranded molecules. In addition, it is understood that RNAi molecules may be used and introduced to cells in a variety of forms. Accordingly, as used herein, RNAi molecules encompasses any and all molecules capable of inducing an RNAi response in cells, including, but not limited to, double-stranded polynucleotides comprising two separate strands, i.e. a sense strand and an antisense strand, e.g., small interfering RNA (siRNA); polynucleotides comprising a hairpin loop of complementary sequences, which forms a double-stranded region, e.g., shRNAi molecules, and expression vectors that express one or more polynucleotides capable of forming a double-stranded polynucleotide alone or in combination with another polynucleotide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRNA interference (RNAi) may be used to specifically inhibit expression of target polynucleotides. Double-stranded RNA-mediated suppression of gene and nucleic acid expression may be accomplished according to the invention by introducing dsRNA, siRNA or shRNA into cells or organisms. SiRNA may be double-stranded RNA, or a hybrid molecule comprising both RNA and DNA, e.g., one RNA strand and one DNA strand. It has been demonstrated that the direct introduction of siRNAs to a cell can trigger RNAi in mammalian cells (Elshabir, S. M., et al. Nature 411:494-498 (2001)). Furthermore, suppression in mammalian cells occurred at the RNA level and was specific for the targeted genes, with a strong correlation between RNA and protein suppression (Caplen, N. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 98:9746-9747 (2001)). In addition, it was shown that a wide variety of cell lines, including HeLa S3, COS7, 293, NIH/3T3, A549, HT-29, CHO-KI and MCF-7 cells, are susceptible to some level of siRNA silencing (Brown, D. et al. TechNotes 9(1):1-7, available on the worldwide web at www.dot.ambion.dot.com/techlib/tn/91/912.html (Sep. 1, 2002)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRNAi molecules targeting specific polynucleotides can be readily prepared according to procedures known in the art. Structural characteristics of effective siRNA molecules have been identified. Elshabir, S. M. et al. (2001) Nature 411:494-498 and Elshabir, S. M. et al. (2001), EMBO 20:6877-6888. Accordingly, one of skill in the art would understand that a wide variety of different siRNA molecules may be used to target a specific gene or transcript. In certain embodiments, siRNA molecules according to the invention are double-stranded and 16-30 or 18-25 nucleotides in length, including each integer in between. In one embodiment, an siRNA is 21 nucleotides in length. In certain embodiments, siRNAs have 0-7 \nnucleotide\n 3′ overhangs or 0-4 \nnucleotide\n 5′ overhangs. In one embodiment, an siRNA molecule has a two \nnucleotide\n 3′ overhang. In one embodiment, an siRNA is 21 nucleotides in length with two \nnucleotide\n 3′ overhangs (i.e. they contain a 19 nucleotide complementary region between the sense and antisense strands). In certain embodiments, the overhangs are UU or \ndTdT\n 3′ overhangs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, siRNA molecules are completely complementary to one strand of a target DNA molecule, since even single base pair mismatches have been shown to reduce silencing. In other embodiments, siRNAs may have a modified backbone composition, such as, for example, 2′-deoxy- or 2′-O-methyl modifications. However, in preferred embodiments, the entire strand of the siRNA is not made with either 2′ deoxy or 2′-O-modified bases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the invention provides a cell including a vector for inhibiting the expression of a gene in a cell. The vector includes a regulatory sequence operably linked to a nucleotide sequence that encodes at least one strand of one of the dsRNA of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, siRNA target sites are selected by scanning the target mRNA transcript sequence for the occurrence of AA dinucleotide sequences. Each AA dinucleotide sequence in combination with the 3′ adjacent approximately 19 nucleotides are potential siRNA target sites. In one embodiment, siRNA target sites are preferentially not located within the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) or regions near the start codon (within approximately 75 bases), since proteins that bind regulatory regions may interfere with the binding of the siRNP endonuclease complex (Elshabir, S. et al. Nature 411:494-498 (2001); Elshabir, S. et al. EMBO J. 20:6877-6888 (2001)). In addition, potential target sites may be compared to an appropriate genome database, such as BLASTN 2.0.5, available on the NCBI server at www.ncbi.nlm, and potential target sequences with significant homology to other coding sequences eliminated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular embodiments, short hairpin RNAs constitute the nucleic acid component of nucleic acid-lipid particles of the invention. Short Hairpin RNA (shRNA) is a form of hairpin RNA capable of sequence-specifically reducing expression of a target gene. Short hairpin RNAs may offer an advantage over siRNAs in suppressing gene expression, as they are generally more stable and less susceptible to degradation in the cellular environment. It has been established that such short hairpin RNA-mediated gene silencing works in a variety of normal and cancer cell lines, and in mammalian cells, including mouse and human cells. Paddison, P. et al., Genes Dev. 16(8):948-58 (2002). Furthermore, transgenic cell lines bearing chromosomal genes that code for engineered shRNAs have been generated. These cells are able to constitutively synthesize shRNAs, thereby facilitating long-lasting or constitutive gene silencing that may be passed on to progeny cells. Paddison, P. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 99(3):1443-1448 (2002).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nShRNAs contain a stem loop structure. In certain embodiments, they may contain variable stem lengths, typically from 19 to 29 nucleotides in length, or any number in between. In certain embodiments, hairpins contain 19 to 21 nucleotide stems, while in other embodiments, hairpins contain 27 to 29 nucleotide stems. In certain embodiments, loop size is between 4 to 23 nucleotides in length, although the loop size may be larger than 23 nucleotides without significantly affecting silencing activity. ShRNA molecules may contain mismatches, for example G-U mismatches between the two strands of the shRNA stem without decreasing potency. In fact, in certain embodiments, shRNAs are designed to include one or several G-U pairings in the hairpin stem to stabilize hairpins during propagation in bacteria, for example. However, complementarity between the portion of the stem that binds to the target mRNA (antisense strand) and the mRNA is typically required, and even a single base pair mismatch is this region may abolish silencing. 5′ and 3′ overhangs are not required, since they do not appear to be critical for shRNA function, although they may be present (Paddison et al. (2002) Genes & Dev. 16(8):948-58).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMicroRNAs\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMicro RNAs (miRNAs) are a highly conserved class of small RNA molecules that are transcribed from DNA in the genomes of plants and animals, but are not translated into protein. Processed miRNAs are single stranded ˜17-25 nucleotide (nt) RNA molecules that become incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and have been identified as key regulators of development, cell proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation. They are believed to play a role in regulation of gene expression by binding to the 3′-untranslated region of specific mRNAs. RISC mediates down-regulation of gene expression through translational inhibition, transcript cleavage, or both. RISC is also implicated in transcriptional silencing in the nucleus of a wide range of eukaryotes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe number of miRNA sequences identified to date is large and growing, illustrative examples of which can be found, for example, in: “\nmiRBase: microRNA sequences, targets and gene nomenclature\n” Griffiths-Jones S, Grocock R J, van Dongen S, Bateman A, Enright A J. NAR, 2006, 34, Database Issue, D140-D144; “The microRNA Registry” Griffiths-Jones S, NAR, 2004, 32, Database Issue, D109-D111; and also on the worldwide web at microrna.dot.sanger.dot.ac.dot.uk/sequences/.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntisense Oligonucleotides\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, a nucleic acid is an antisense oligonucleotide directed to a target polynucleotide. The term “antisense oligonucleotide” or simply “antisense” is meant to include oligonucleotides that are complementary to a targeted polynucleotide sequence. Antisense oligonucleotides are single strands of DNA or RNA that are complementary to a chosen sequence. In the case of antisense RNA, they prevent translation of complementary RNA strands by binding to it. Antisense DNA can be used to target a specific, complementary (coding or non-coding) RNA. If binding takes places this DNA/RNA hybrid can be degraded by the enzyme RNase H. In particular embodiment, antisense oligonucleotides contain from about 10 to about 50 nucleotides, more preferably about 15 to about 30 nucleotides. The term also encompasses antisense oligonucleotides that may not be exactly complementary to the desired target gene. Thus, the invention can be utilized in instances where non-target specific-activities are found with antisense, or where an antisense sequence containing one or more mismatches with the target sequence is the most preferred for a particular use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntisense oligonucleotides have been demonstrated to be effective and targeted inhibitors of protein synthesis, and, consequently, can be used to specifically inhibit protein synthesis by a targeted gene. The efficacy of antisense oligonucleotides for inhibiting protein synthesis is well established. For example, the synthesis of polygalactauronase and the \nmuscarine type\n 2 acetylcholine receptor are inhibited by antisense oligonucleotides directed to their respective mRNA sequences (U.S. Pat. No. 5,739,119 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,759,829). Further, examples of antisense inhibition have been demonstrated with the nuclear protein cyclin, the multiple drug resistance gene (MDG1), ICAM-1, E-selectin, STK-1, striatal GABA\nA \nreceptor and human EGF (Jaskulski et al., Science. 1988 Jun. 10; 240(4858):1544-6; Vasanthakumar and Ahmed, Cancer Commun. 1989; 1(4):225-32; Penis et al., Brain Res Mol Brain Res. 1998 Jun. 15; 57(2):310-20; U.S. Pat. No. 5,801,154; U.S. Pat. No. 5,789,573; U.S. Pat. No. 5,718,709 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,610,288). Furthermore, antisense constructs have also been described that inhibit and can be used to treat a variety of abnormal cellular proliferations, e.g. cancer (U.S. Pat. No. 5,747,470; U.S. Pat. No. 5,591,317 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,783,683).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods of producing antisense oligonucleotides are known in the art and can be readily adapted to produce an antisense oligonucleotide that targets any polynucleotide sequence. Selection of antisense oligonucleotide sequences specific for a given target sequence is based upon analysis of the chosen target sequence and determination of secondary structure, T\nm\n, binding energy, and relative stability. Antisense oligonucleotides may be selected based upon their relative inability to form dimers, hairpins, or other secondary structures that would reduce or prohibit specific binding to the target mRNA in a host cell. Highly preferred target regions of the mRNA include those regions at or near the AUG translation initiation codon and those sequences that are substantially complementary to 5′ regions of the mRNA. These secondary structure analyses and target site selection considerations can be performed, for example, using v.4 of the OLIGO primer analysis software (Molecular Biology Insights) and/or the BLASTN 2.0.5 algorithm software (Altschul et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 1997, 25(17):3389-402).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRibozymes\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to another embodiment of the invention, nucleic acid-lipid particles are associated with ribozymes. Ribozymes are RNA-protein complexes having specific catalytic domains that possess endonuclease activity (Kim and Cech, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 1987 December; 84(24):8788-92; Forster and Symons, Cell. 1987 Apr. 24; 49(2):211-20). For example, a large number of ribozymes accelerate phosphoester transfer reactions with a high degree of specificity, often cleaving only one of several phosphoesters in an oligonucleotide substrate (Cech et al., Cell. 1981 December; 27(3 Pt 2):487-96; Michel and Westhof, J Mol Biol. 1990 Dec. 5; 216(3):585-610; Reinhold-Hurek and Shub, Nature. 1992 May 14; 357(6374):173-6). This specificity has been attributed to the requirement that the substrate bind via specific base-pairing interactions to the internal guide sequence (“IGS”) of the ribozyme prior to chemical reaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt least six basic varieties of naturally-occurring enzymatic RNAs are known presently. Each can catalyze the hydrolysis of RNA phosphodiester bonds in trans (and thus can cleave other RNA molecules) under physiological conditions. In general, enzymatic nucleic acids act by first binding to a target RNA. Such binding occurs through the target binding portion of a enzymatic nucleic acid which is held in close proximity to an enzymatic portion of the molecule that acts to cleave the target RNA. Thus, the enzymatic nucleic acid first recognizes and then binds a target RNA through complementary base-pairing, and once bound to the correct site, acts enzymatically to cut the target RNA. Strategic cleavage of such a target RNA will destroy its ability to direct synthesis of an encoded protein. After an enzymatic nucleic acid has bound and cleaved its RNA target, it is released from that RNA to search for another target and can repeatedly bind and cleave new targets.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe enzymatic nucleic acid molecule may be formed in a hammerhead, hairpin, a hepatitis δ virus, group I intron or RNaseP RNA (in association with an RNA guide sequence) or \nNeurospora \nVS RNA motif, for example. Specific examples of hammerhead motifs are described by Rossi et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992 Sep. 11; 20(17):4559-65. Examples of hairpin motifs are described by Hampel et al. (Eur. Pat. Appl. Publ. No. EP 0360257), Hampel and Tritz, Biochemistry 1989 Jun. 13; 28(12):4929-33; Hampel et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 1990 Jan. 25; 18(2):299-304 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,631,359. An example of the hepatitis δ virus motif is described by Perrotta and Been, Biochemistry. 1992 Dec. 1; 31(47):11843-52; an example of the RNaseP motif is described by Guerrier-Takada et al., Cell. 1983 December; 35(3 Pt 2):849-57; \nNeurospora \nVS RNA ribozyme motif is described by Collins (Saville and Collins, Cell. 1990 May 18; 61(4):685-96; Saville and Collins, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 1991 Oct. 1; 88(19):8826-30; Collins and Olive, Biochemistry. 1993 Mar. 23; 32(11):2795-9); and an example of the Group I intron is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,987,071. Important characteristics of enzymatic nucleic acid molecules used according to the invention are that they have a specific substrate binding site which is complementary to one or more of the target gene DNA or RNA regions, and that they have nucleotide sequences within or surrounding that substrate binding site which impart an RNA cleaving activity to the molecule. Thus the ribozyme constructs need not be limited to specific motifs mentioned herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods of producing a ribozyme targeted to any polynucleotide sequence are known in the art. Ribozymes may be designed as described in Int. Pat. Appl. Publ. No. WO 93/23569 and Int. Pat. Appl. Publ. No. WO 94/02595, each specifically incorporated herein by reference, and synthesized to be tested in vitro and in vivo, as described therein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRibozyme activity can be optimized by altering the length of the ribozyme binding arms or chemically synthesizing ribozymes with modifications that prevent their degradation by serum ribonucleases (see e.g., Int. Pat. Appl. Publ. No. WO 92/07065; Int. Pat. Appl. Publ. No. WO 93/15187; Int. Pat. Appl. Publ. No. WO 91/03162; Eur. Pat. Appl. Publ. No. 92110298.4; U.S. Pat. No. 5,334,711; and Int. Pat. Appl. Publ. No. WO 94/13688, which describe various chemical modifications that can be made to the sugar moieties of enzymatic RNA molecules), modifications which enhance their efficacy in cells, and removal of stem II bases to shorten RNA synthesis times and reduce chemical requirements.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional specific nucleic acid sequences of oligonucleotides (ODNs) suitable for use in the compositions and methods of the invention are described in \nU.S. patent application\n 60/379,343, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/649,527, Int. Publ. WO 02/069369, Int. Publ. No. WO 01/15726, U.S. Pat. No. 6,406,705, and Raney et al., Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, 298:1185-1192 (2001). In certain embodiments, ODNs used in the compositions and methods of the invention have a phosphodiester (“PO”) backbone or a phosphorothioate (“PS”) backbone, and/or at least one methylated cytosine residue in a CpG motif.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic Acid Modifications\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the 1990's DNA-based antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) and ribozymes (RNA) represented an exciting new paradigm for drug design and development, but their application in vivo was prevented by endo- and exo-nuclease activity as well as a lack of successful intracellular delivery. The degradation issue was effectively overcome following extensive research into chemical modifications that prevented the oligonucleotide (oligo) drugs from being recognized by nuclease enzymes but did not inhibit their mechanism of action. This research was so successful that antisense ODN drugs in development today remain intact in vivo for days compared to minutes for unmodified molecules (Kurreck, J. 2003. Antisense technologies. Improvement through novel chemical modifications. \nEur J Biochem \n270:1628-44). However, intracellular delivery and mechanism of action issues have so far limited antisense ODN and ribozymes from becoming clinical products.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRNA duplexes are inherently more stable to nucleases than single stranded DNA or RNA, and unlike antisense ODN, unmodified siRNA show good activity once they access the cytoplasm. Even so, the chemical modifications developed to stabilize antisense ODN and ribozymes have also been systematically applied to siRNA to determine how much chemical modification can be tolerated and if pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic activity can be enhanced. RNA interference by siRNA duplexes requires an antisense and sense strand, which have different functions. Both are necessary to enable the siRNA to enter RISC, but once loaded the two strands separate and the sense strand is degraded whereas the antisense strand remains to guide RISC to the target mRNA. Entry into RISC is a process that is structurally less stringent than the recognition and cleavage of the target mRNA. Consequently, many different chemical modifications of the sense strand are possible, but only limited changes are tolerated by the antisense strand (Zhang et al., 2006).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs is known in the art, a nucleoside is a base-sugar combination. Nucleotides are nucleosides that further include a phosphate group covalently linked to the sugar portion of the nucleoside. For those nucleosides that include a pentofuranosyl sugar, the phosphate group can be linked to either the 2′, 3′ or 5′ hydroxyl moiety of the sugar. In forming oligonucleotides, the phosphate groups covalently link adjacent nucleosides to one another to form a linear polymeric compound. In turn the respective ends of this linear polymeric structure can be further joined to form a circular structure. Within the oligonucleotide structure, the phosphate groups are commonly referred to as forming the internucleoside backbone of the oligonucleotide. The normal linkage or backbone of RNA and DNA is a 3′ to 5′ phosphodiester linkage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nucleic acid that is used in a lipid-nucleic acid particle according to this invention includes any form of nucleic acid that is known. Thus, the nucleic acid may be a modified nucleic acid of the type used previously to enhance nuclease resistance and serum stability. Surprisingly, however, acceptable therapeutic products can also be prepared using the method of the invention to formulate lipid-nucleic acid particles from nucleic acids that have no modification to the phosphodiester linkages of natural nucleic acid polymers, and the use of unmodified phosphodiester nucleic acids (i.e., nucleic acids in which all of the linkages are phosphodiester linkages) is a preferred embodiment of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBackbone Modifications\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntisense, siRNA and other oligonucleotides useful in this invention include, but are not limited to, oligonucleotides containing modified backbones or non-natural internucleoside linkages. Oligonucleotides having modified backbones include those that retain a phosphorus atom in the backbone and those that do not have a phosphorus atom in the backbone. Modified oligonucleotides that do not have a phosphorus atom in their internucleoside backbone can also be considered to be oligonucleosides. Modified oligonucleotide backbones include, for example, phosphorothioates, chiral phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates, phosphotriesters, aminoalkylphosphotri-esters, methyl and other alkyl phosphonates including 3′-alkylene phosphonates and chiral phosphonates, phosphinates, phosphoramidates including 3′-amino phosphoramidate and aminoalkylphosphoramidates, thionophosphoramidates, thionoalkylphosphonates, thionoalkylphosphotriesters, phosphoroselenate, methylphosphonate, or O-alkyl phosphotriester linkages, and boranophosphates having normal 3′-5′ linkages, 2′-5′ linked analogs of these, and those having inverted polarity wherein the adjacent pairs of nucleoside units are linked 3′-5′ to 5′-3′ or 2′-5′ to 5′-2′. Particular non-limiting examples of particular modifications that may be present in a nucleic acid according to the invention are shown in Table 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious salts, mixed salts and free acid forms are also included. Representative United States patents that teach the preparation of the above linkages include, but are not limited to, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,687,808; 4,469,863; 4,476,301; 5,023,243; 5,177,196; 5,188,897; 5,264,423; 5,276,019; 5,278,302; 5,286,717; 5,321,131; 5,399,676; 5,405,939; 5,453,496; 5,455,233; 5,466,677; 5,476,925; 5,519,126; 5,536,821; 5,541,306; 5,550,111; 5,563,253; 5,571,799; 5,587,361; and 5,625,050.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, modified oligonucleotide backbones that do not include a phosphorus atom therein have backbones that are formed by short chain alkyl or cycloalkyl internucleoside linkages, mixed heteroatom and alkyl or cycloalkyl internucleoside linkages, or one or more short chain heteroatomic or heterocyclic internucleoside linkages. These include, e.g., those having morpholino linkages (formed in part from the sugar portion of a nucleoside); siloxane backbones; sulfide, sulfoxide and sulfone backbones; formacetyl and thioformacetyl backbones; methylene formacetyl and thioformacetyl backbones; alkene containing backbones; sulfamate backbones; methyleneimino and methylenehydrazino backbones; sulfonate and sulfonamide backbones; amide backbones; and others having mixed N, O, S and CH\n2 \ncomponent parts.

In general, it appears that PS modifications can be made extensively to both siRNA strands without much impact on activity (Kurreck, J., \nEur. J. Biochem. \n270:1628-44, 2003). However, PS oligos are known to avidly associate non-specifically with proteins resulting in toxicity, especially upon i.v. administration. Therefore, the PS modification is usually restricted to one or two bases at the 3′ and 5′ ends. The boranophosphate linker (Table 3, #2) is a recent modification that is apparently more stable than PS, enhances siRNA activity and has low toxicity (Hall et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 32:5991-6000, 2004).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nChemical Modifications Applied to siRNA and Other Nucleic Acids\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAbbrevia-\n\n\n \n\n\nModification\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\n\n\ntion\n\n\n \nName\n \n \nSite\n\n\nStructure\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n 1\n\n\nPS\n\n\nPhosphorothioate\n\n\nBackbone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n 2\n\n\nPB\n\n\nBoranophosphate\n\n\nBackbone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n 3\n\n\nN3-MU\n\n\nN3-methyl-uridine\n\n\nBase\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n 4\n\n\n5′-\nBU\n \n\n\n5′-bromo-uracil\n\n\nBase\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n 5\n\n\n5′-\nIU\n \n\n\n5′-iodo-uracil\n\n\nBase\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n 6\n\n\n2,6-\nDP\n \n\n\n2,6-diaminopurine\n\n\nBase\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n 7\n\n\n2′-\nF\n \n\n\n2′-Fluoro\n\n\nSugar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n 8\n\n\n2′-\nOME\n \n\n\n2″-O-methyl\n\n\nSugar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n 9\n\n\n2′-O-\nMOE\n \n\n\n2′-O-(2-methoxylethyl)\n\n\nSugar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n2′-\nDNP\n \n\n\n2′-O-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)\n\n\nSugar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\nLNA\n\n\nLocked Nucleic Acid (methylene bridge connecting the 2′-oxygen with the 4′-carbon of the ribose ring)\n\n\nSugar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n2′-\nAmino\n \n\n\n2′-Amino\n\n\nSugar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\n2′-\nDeoxy\n \n\n\n2′-Deoxy\n\n\nSugar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\n4′-\nthio\n \n\n\n4′-thio- ribonucleotide\n\n\nSugar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther useful nucleic acids derivatives include those nucleic acids molecules in which the bridging oxygen atoms (those forming the phosphoester linkages) have been replaced with —S—, —NH—, —CH2- and the like. In certain embodiments, the alterations to the antisense, siRNA, or other nucleic acids used will not completely affect the negative charges associated with the nucleic acids. Thus, the invention contemplates the use of antisense, siRNA, and other nucleic acids in which a portion of the linkages are replaced with, for example, the neutral methyl phosphonate or phosphoramidate linkages. When neutral linkages are used, in certain embodiments, less than 80% of the nucleic acid linkages are so substituted, or less than 50% of the linkages are so substituted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBase Modifications\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBase modifications are less common than those to the backbone and sugar. The modifications shown in 0.3-6 all appear to stabilize siRNA against nucleases and have little effect on activity (Zhang, H. Y., Du, Q., Wahlestedt, C., Liang, Z. 2006. RNA Interference with chemically modified siRNA. \nCurr Top Med Chem \n6:893-900).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, oligonucleotides may also include nucleobase (often referred to in the art simply as “base”) modifications or substitutions. As used herein, “unmodified” or “natural” nucleobases include the purine bases adenine (A) and guanine (G), and the pyrimidine bases thymine (T), cytosine (C) and uracil (U). Modified nucleobases include other synthetic and natural nucleobases such as 5-methylcytosine (5-me-C or m5c), 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine, xanthine, hypoxanthine, 2-aminoadenine, 6-methyl and other alkyl derivatives of adenine and guanine, 2-propyl and other alkyl derivatives of adenine and guanine, 2-thiouracil, 2-thiothymine and 2-thiocytosine, 5-halouracil and cytosine, 5-propynyl uracil and cytosine, 6-azo uracil, cytosine and thymine, 5-uracil (pseudouracil), 4-thiouracil, 8-halo, 8-amino, 8-thiol, 8-thioalkyl, 8-hydroxyl and other 8-substituted adenines and guanines, 5-halo particularly 5-bromo, 5-trifluoromethyl and other 5-substituted uracils and cytosines, 7-methylguanine and 7-methyladenine, 8-azaguanine and 8-azaadenine, 7-deazaguanine and 7-deazaadenine and 3-deazaguanine and 3-deazaadenine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain nucleobases are particularly useful for increasing the binding affinity of the oligomeric compounds of the invention, including 5-substituted pyrimidines, 6-azapyrimidines and N-2, N-6 and O-6 substituted purines, including 2-aminopropyladenine, 5-propynyluracil and 5-propynylcytosine. 5-methylcytosine substitutions have been shown to increase nucleic acid duplex stability by 0.6-1.2° C. (Sanghvi, Y. S., Crooke, S. T. and Lebleu, B., eds., \nAntisense Research and Applications \n1993, CRC Press, Boca Raton, pages 276-278). These may be combined, in particular embodiments, with 2′-O-methoxyethyl sugar modifications. United States patents that teach the preparation of certain of these modified nucleobases as well as other modified nucleobases include, but are not limited to, the above noted U.S. Pat. No. 3,687,808, as well as U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,845,205; 5,130,302; 5,134,066; 5,175,273; 5,367,066; 5,432,272; 5,457,187; 5,459,255; 5,484,908; 5,502,177; 5,525,711; 5,552,540; 5,587,469; 5,594,121, 5,596,091; 5,614,617; and 5,681,941.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSugar Modifications\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMost modifications on the sugar group occur at the 2′-OH of the RNA sugar ring, which provides a convenient chemically reactive site (Manoharan, M. 2004. RNA interference and chemically modified small interfering RNAs. \nCurr Opin Chem Biol \n8:570-9; Zhang, H. Y., Du, Q., Wahlestedt, C., Liang, Z. 2006. RNA Interference with chemically modified siRNA. \nCurr Top Med Chem \n6:893-900). The 2′-F and 2′-OME (0.7 and 8) are common and both increase stability, the 2′-OME modification does not reduce activity as long as it is restricted to less than 4 nucleotides per strand (Holen, T., Amarzguioui, M., Babaie, E., Prydz, H. 2003. Similar behaviour of single-strand and double-strand siRNAs suggests they act through a common RNAi pathway. \nNucleic Acids Res \n31:2401-7). The 2′-O-MOE (0.9) is most effective in siRNA when modified bases are restricted to the middle region of the molecule (Prakash, T. P., Allerson, C. R., Dande, P., Vickers, T. A., Sioufi, N., Janes, R., Baker, B. F., Swayze, E. E., Griffey, R. H., Bhat, B. 2005. Positional effect of chemical modifications on short interference RNA activity in mammalian cells. \nJ Med Chem \n48:4247-53). Other modifications found to stabilize siRNA without loss of activity are shown in 0.10-14.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModified oligonucleotides may also contain one or more substituted sugar moieties. For example, the invention includes oligonucleotides that comprise one of the following at the 2′ position: OH; F; O-, S-, or N-alkyl, O-alkyl-O-alkyl, O-, S-, or N-alkenyl, or O-, S- or N-alkynyl, wherein the alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl may be substituted or unsubstituted C\n1 \nto C\n10 \nalkyl or C2 to C10 alkenyl and alkynyl. Particularly preferred are O[(CH\n2\n)\nn\nO]\nm\nCH\n3\n, O(CH\n2\n)\nn\nOCH\n3\n, O(CH\n2\n)\n2\nON(CH\n3\n)\n2\n, O(CH\n2\n)\nn\nNH\n2\n, O(CH\n2\n)\nn\nCH\n3\n, O(CH\n2\n)\nn\nONH\n2\n, and O(CH\n2\n)\nn\nON[(CH\n2\n)\nn\nCH\n3\n)]\n2\n, where n and m are from 1 to about 10. Other preferred oligonucleotides comprise one of the following at the 2′ position: C\n1 \nto C\n10 \nlower alkyl, substituted lower alkyl, alkaryl, aralkyl, O-alkaryl or O-aralkyl, SH, SCH\n3\n, OCN, Cl, Br, CN, CF\n3\n, OCF\n3\n, SOCH\n3\n, SO\n2\nCH\n3\n, ONO\n2\n, NO\n2\n, N\n3\n, NH\n2\n, heterocycloalkyl, heterocycloalkaryl, aminoalkylamino, polyalkylamino, substituted silyl, an RNA cleaving group, a reporter group, an intercalator, a group for improving the pharmacokinetic properties of an oligonucleotide, or a group for improving the pharmacodynamic properties of an oligonucleotide, and other substituents having similar properties. One modification includes 2′-methoxyethoxy (2′-O—CH\n2\nCH\n2\nOCH\n3\n, also known as 2′-O-(2-methoxyethyl) or 2′-MOE) (Martin et al., \nHelv. Chim. Acta \n1995, 78, 486-504), i.e., an alkoxyalkoxy group. Other modifications include 2′-dimethylaminooxyethoxy, i.e., a O(CH\n2\n)\n2\nON(CH\n3\n)\n2 \ngroup, also known as 2′-DMAOE, and 2′-dimethylaminoethoxyethoxy (2′-DMAEOE).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional modifications include 2′-methoxy (2′-O—CH\n3\n), 2′-aminopropoxy (2′-OCH\n2\nCH\n2\nCH\n2\nNH\n2\n) and 2′-fluoro (2′-F). Similar modifications may also be made at other positions on the oligonucleotide, particularly the 3′ position of the sugar on the 3′ terminal nucleotide or in 2′-5′ linked oligonucleotides and the 5′ position of 5′ terminal nucleotide. Oligonucleotides may also have sugar mimetics such as cyclobutyl moieties in place of the pentofuranosyl sugar. Representative United States patents that teach the preparation of such modified sugars structures include, but are not limited to, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,981,957; 5,118,800; 5,319,080; 5,359,044; 5,393,878; 5,446,137; 5,466,786; 5,514,785; 5,519,134; 5,567,811; 5,576,427; 5,591,722; 5,597,909; 5,610,300; 5,627,053; 5,639,873; 5,646,265; 5,658,873; 5,670,633; and 5,700,920.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other oligonucleotide mimetics, both the sugar and the internucleoside linkage, i.e., the backbone, of the nucleotide units are replaced with novel groups, although the base units are maintained for hybridization with an appropriate nucleic acid target compound. One such oligomeric compound, an oligonucleotide mimetic that has been shown to have excellent hybridization properties, is referred to as a peptide nucleic acid (PNA). In PNA compounds, the sugar-backbone of an oligonucleotide is replaced with an amide containing backbone, in particular an aminoethylglycine backbone. The nucleobases are retained and are bound directly or indirectly to aza nitrogen atoms of the amide portion of the backbone. Representative United States patents that teach the preparation of PNA compounds include, but are not limited to, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,539,082; 5,714,331; and 5,719,262. Further teaching of PNA compounds can be found in Nielsen et al. (Science, 1991, 254, 1497-1500).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParticular embodiments of the invention are oligonucleotides with phosphorothioate backbones and oligonucleosides with heteroatom backbones, and in particular —CH\n2\n—NH—O—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—N(CH\n3\n)—O—CH\n2\n— (referred to as a methylene (methylimino) or MMI backbone) —CH\n2\n—O—N(CH\n3\n)—CH\n2\n—, —CH\n2\n—N(CH\n3\n)—N(CH\n3\n)—CH\n2\n— and —O—N(CH\n3\n)—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n— (wherein the native phosphodiester backbone is represented as —O—P—O—CH\n2\n—) of the above referenced U.S. Pat. No. 5,489,677, and the amide backbones of the above referenced U.S. Pat. No. 5,602,240. Also preferred are oligonucleotides having morpholino backbone structures of the above-referenced U.S. Pat. No. 5,034,506.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChimeric Oligonucleotides\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is not necessary for all positions in a given compound to be uniformly modified, and in fact more than one of the aforementioned modifications may be incorporated in a single compound or even at a single nucleoside within an oligonucleotide. Certain preferred oligonucleotides of this invention are chimeric oligonucleotides. “Chimeric oligonucleotides” or “chimeras,” in the context of this invention, are oligonucleotides that contain two or more chemically distinct regions, each made up of at least one nucleotide. These oligonucleotides typically contain at least one region of modified nucleotides that confers one or more beneficial properties (such as, e.g., increased nuclease resistance, increased uptake into cells, increased binding affinity for the RNA target) and a region that is a substrate for RNase H cleavage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, a chimeric oligonucleotide comprises at least one region modified to increase target binding affinity. Affinity of an oligonucleotide for its target is routinely determined by measuring the Tm of an oligonucleotide/target pair, which is the temperature at which the oligonucleotide and target dissociate; dissociation is detected spectrophotometrically. The higher the Tm, the greater the affinity of the oligonucleotide for the target. In one embodiment, the region of the oligonucleotide which is modified to increase target mRNA binding affinity comprises at least one nucleotide modified at the 2′ position of the sugar, most preferably a 2′-O-alkyl, 2′-O-alkyl-O-alkyl or 2′-fluoro-modified nucleotide. Such modifications are routinely incorporated into oligonucleotides and these oligonucleotides have been shown to have a higher Tm (i.e., higher target binding affinity) than 2′-deoxyoligonucleotides against a given target. The effect of such increased affinity is to greatly enhance oligonucleotide inhibition of target gene expression.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, a chimeric oligonucletoide comprises a region that acts as a substrate for RNAse H. Of course, it is understood that oligonucleotides may include any combination of the various modifications described herein\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother modification of the oligonucleotides of the invention involves chemically linking to the oligonucleotide one or more moieties or conjugates which enhance the activity, cellular distribution or cellular uptake of the oligonucleotide. Such conjugates and methods of preparing the same are known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThose skilled in the art will realize that for in vivo utility, such as therapeutic efficacy, a reasonable rule of thumb is that if a thioated version of the sequence works in the free form, that encapsulated particles of the same sequence, of any chemistry, will also be efficacious. Encapsulated particles may also have a broader range of in vivo utilities, showing efficacy in conditions and models not known to be otherwise responsive to antisense therapy. Those skilled in the art know that applying this invention they may find old models which now respond to antisense therapy. Further, they may revisit discarded antisense sequences or chemistries and find efficacy by employing the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe oligonucleotides used in accordance with this invention may be conveniently and routinely made through the well-known technique of solid phase synthesis. Equipment for such synthesis is sold by several vendors including Applied Biosystems. Any other means for such synthesis may also be employed; the actual synthesis of the oligonucleotides is well within the talents of the routineer. It is also well known to use similar techniques to prepare other oligonucleotides such as the phosphorothioates and alkylated derivatives.\n\n\n \nDEFINITIONS\n\n\n \n \n \nFor convenience, the meaning of certain terms and phrases used in the specification, examples, and appended claims, are provided below. If there is an apparent discrepancy between the usage of a term in other parts of this specification and its definition provided in this section, the definition in this section shall prevail.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“G,” “C,” “A” and “U” each generally stand for a nucleotide that contains guanine, cytosine, adenine, and uracil as a base, respectively. However, it will be understood that the term “ribonucleotide” or “nucleotide” can also refer to a modified nucleotide, as further detailed below, or a surrogate replacement moiety. The skilled person is well aware that guanine, cytosine, adenine, and uracil may be replaced by other moieties without substantially altering the base pairing properties of an oligonucleotide including a nucleotide bearing such replacement moiety. For example, without limitation, a nucleotide including inosine as its base may base pair with nucleotides containing adenine, cytosine, or uracil. Hence, nucleotides containing uracil, guanine, or adenine may be replaced in the nucleotide sequences of the invention by a nucleotide containing, for example, inosine. Sequences including such replacement moieties are embodiments of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “Factor VII” as used herein is meant a Factor VII mRNA, protein, peptide, or polypeptide. The term “Factor VII” is also known in the art as AI132620, Cf7, Coagulation factor VII precursor, coagulation factor VII, FVII, Serum prothrombin conversion accelerator, FVII coagulation protein, and eptacog alfa.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “target sequence” refers to a contiguous portion of the nucleotide sequence of an mRNA molecule formed during the transcription of the gene, including mRNA that is a product of RNA processing of a primary transcription product.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “strand including a sequence” refers to an oligonucleotide including a chain of nucleotides that is described by the sequence referred to using the standard nucleotide nomenclature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, and unless otherwise indicated, the term “complementary,” when used in the context of a nucleotide pair, means a classic Watson-Crick pair, i.e., GC, AT, or AU. It also extends to classic Watson-Crick pairings where one or both of the nucleotides has been modified as described herein, e.g., by a rbose modification or a phosphate backpone modification. It can also include pairing with an inosine or other entity that does not substantially alter the base pairing properties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, and unless otherwise indicated, the term “complementary,” when used to describe a first nucleotide sequence in relation to a second nucleotide sequence, refers to the ability of an oligonucleotide or polynucleotide including the first nucleotide sequence to hybridize and form a duplex structure under certain conditions with an oligonucleotide or polynucleotide including the second nucleotide sequence, as will be understood by the skilled person. Complementarity can include, full complementarity, substantial complementarity, and sufficient complementarity to allow hybridization under physiological conditions, e.g, under physiologically relevant conditions as may be encountered inside an organism. Full complementarity refers to complementarity, as defined above for an individual pair, at all of the pairs of the first and second sequence. When a sequence is “substantially complementary” with respect to a second sequence herein, the two sequences can be fully complementary, or they may form one or more, but generally not more than 4, 3 or 2 mismatched base pairs upon hybridization, while retaining the ability to hybridize under the conditions most relevant to their ultimate application. Substantial complementarity can also be defined as hybridization under stringent conditions, where stringent conditions may include: 400 mM NaCl, 40 mM PIPES pH 6.4, 1 mM EDTA, 50° C. or 70° C. for 12-16 hours followed by washing. The skilled person will be able to determine the set of conditions most appropriate for a test of complementarity of two sequences in accordance with the ultimate application of the hybridized nucleotides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, where two oligonucleotides are designed to form, upon hybridization, one or more single stranded overhangs, such overhangs shall not be regarded as mismatches with regard to the determination of complementarity. For example, a dsRNA including one oligonucleotide 21 nucleotides in length and another oligonucleotide 23 nucleotides in length, wherein the longer oligonucleotide includes a sequence of 21 nucleotides that is fully complementary to the shorter oligonucleotide, may yet be referred to as “fully complementary” for the purposes of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Complementary” sequences, as used herein, may also include, or be formed entirely from, non-Watson-Crick base pairs and/or base pairs formed from non-natural and modified nucleotides, in as far as the above requirements with respect to their ability to hybridize are fulfilled.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “complementary”, “fully complementary”, “substantially complementary” and sufficient complementarity to allow hybridization under physiological conditions, e.g, under physiologically relevant conditions as may be encountered inside an organism, may be used hereinwith respect to the base matching between the sense strand and the antisense strand of a dsRNA, or between the antisense strand of a dsRNA and a target sequence, as will be understood from the context of their use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, a polynucleotide which is “complementary, e.g., substantially complementary to at least part of” a messenger RNA (mRNA) refers to a polynucleotide which is complementary, e.g., substantially complementary, to a contiguous portion of the mRNA of interest (e.g., encoding Factor VII). For example, a polynucleotide is complementary to at least a part of a Factor VII mRNA if the sequence is substantially complementary to a non-interrupted portion of an mRNA encoding Factor VII.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “double-stranded RNA” or “dsRNA”, as used herein, refers to a ribonucleic acid molecule, or complex of ribonucleic acid molecules, having a duplex structure including two anti-parallel and substantially complementary, as defined above, nucleic acid strands. The two strands forming the duplex structure may be different portions of one larger RNA molecule, or they may be separate RNA molecules. Where the two strands are part of one larger molecule, and therefore are connected by an uninterrupted chain of nucleotides between the 3′-end of one strand and the 5′ end of the respective other strand forming the duplex structure, the connecting RNA chain is referred to as a “hairpin loop”. Where the two strands are connected covalently by means other than an uninterrupted chain of nucleotides between the 3′-end of one strand and the 5′ end of the respective other strand forming the duplex structure, the connecting structure is referred to as a “linker.” The RNA strands may have the same or a different number of nucleotides. The maximum number of base pairs is the number of nucleotides in the shortest strand of the dsRNA. In addition to the duplex structure, a dsRNA may comprise one or more nucleotide overhangs. A dsRNA as used herein is also referred to as a “small inhibitory RNA,” “siRNA,” “siRNA agent,” “iRNA agent” or “RNAi agent.”\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, a “nucleotide overhang” refers to the unpaired nucleotide or nucleotides that protrude from the duplex structure of a dsRNA when a 3′-end of one strand of the dsRNA extends beyond the 5′-end of the other strand, or vice versa. “Blunt” or “blunt end” means that there are no unpaired nucleotides at that end of the dsRNA, i.e., no nucleotide overhang. A “blunt ended” dsRNA is a dsRNA that is double-stranded over its entire length, i.e., no nucleotide overhang at either end of the molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “antisense strand” refers to the strand of a dsRNA which includes a region that is substantially complementary to a target sequence. As used herein, the term “region of complementarity” refers to the region on the antisense strand that is substantially complementary to a sequence, for example a target sequence, as defined herein. Where the region of complementarity is not fully complementary to the target sequence, the mismatches are most tolerated in the terminal regions and, if present, are generally in a terminal region or regions, e.g., within 6, 5, 4, 3, or 2 nucleotides of the 5′ and/or 3′ terminus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “sense strand,” as used herein, refers to the strand of a dsRNA that includes a region that is substantially complementary to a region of the antisense strand.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “identity” is the relationship between two or more polynucleotide sequences, as determined by comparing the sequences. Identity also means the degree of sequence relatedness between polynucleotide sequences, as determined by the match between strings of such sequences. While there exist a number of methods to measure identity between two polynucleotide sequences, the term is well known to skilled artisans (see, e.g., Sequence Analysis in Molecular Biology, von Heinje, G., Academic Press (1987); and Sequence Analysis Primer, Gribskov., M. and Devereux, J., eds., M. Stockton Press, New York (1991)). “Substantially identical,” as used herein, means there is a very high degree of homology (preferably 100% sequence identity) between the sense strand of the dsRNA and the corresponding part of the target gene. However, dsRNA having greater than 90%, or 95% sequence identity may be used in the invention, and thus sequence variations that might be expected due to genetic mutation, strain polymorphism, or evolutionary divergence can be tolerated. Although 100% identity is preferred, the dsRNA may contain single or multiple base-pair random mismatches between the RNA and the target gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Introducing into a cell”, when referring to a dsRNA, means facilitating uptake or absorption into the cell, as is understood by those skilled in the art. Absorption or uptake of dsRNA can occur through unaided diffusive or active cellular processes, or by auxiliary agents or devices. The meaning of this term is not limited to cells in vitro; a dsRNA may also be “introduced into a cell,” wherein the cell is part of a living organism. In such instance, introduction into the cell will include the delivery to the organism. For example, for in vivo delivery, dsRNA can be injected into a tissue site or administered systemically. In vitro introduction into a cell includes methods known in the art such as electroporation and lipofection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “silence” and “inhibit the expression of,” in as far as they refer to the Factor VII gene, herein refer to the at least partial suppression of the expression of the Factor VII gene, as manifested by a reduction of the amount of mRNA from the Factor VII gene which may be isolated from a first cell or group of cells in which the Factor VII gene is transcribed and which has or have been treated such that the expression of the Factor VII gene is inhibited, as compared to a second cell or group of cells substantially identical to the first cell or group of cells but which has or have not been so treated (control cells). The degree of inhibition is usually expressed in terms of\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\nmRNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontrol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncells\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\nmRNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntreated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncells\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\nmRNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontrol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncells\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n·\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the degree of inhibition may be given in terms of a reduction of a parameter that is functionally linked to Factor VII gene transcription, e.g. the amount of protein encoded by the Factor VII gene which is secreted by a cell, or the number of cells displaying a certain phenotype, e.g apoptosis. In principle, Factor VII gene silencing may be determined in any cell expressing the target, either constitutively or by genomic engineering, and by any appropriate assay. However, when a reference is needed in order to determine whether a given siRNA inhibits the expression of the Factor VII gene by a certain degree and therefore is encompassed by the instant invention, the assays provided in the Examples below shall serve as such reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, in certain instances, expression of the Factor VII gene is suppressed by at least about 20%, 25%, 35%, 40% or 50% by administration of the double-stranded oligonucleotide of the invention. In one embodiment, the Factor VII gene is suppressed by at least about 60%, 70%, or 80% by administration of the double-stranded oligonucleotide of the invention. In a more preferred embodiment, the Factor VII gene is suppressed by at least about 85%, 90%, or 95% by administration of the double-stranded oligonucleotide of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “treat,” “treatment,” and the like, refer to relief from or alleviation of a disease or disorder. In the context of the invention insofar as it relates to any of the other conditions recited herein below (e.g., a Factor VII-mediated condition other than a thrombotic disorder), the terms “treat,” “treatment,” and the like mean to relieve or alleviate at least one symptom associated with such condition, or to slow or reverse the progression of such condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “therapeutically relevant” composition can alleviate a disease or disorder, or a symptom of a disease or disorder when administered at an appropriate dose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “Factor VII-mediated condition or disease” and related terms and phrases refer to a condition or disorder characterized by inappropriate, e.g., greater than normal, Factor VII activity. Inappropriate Factor VII functional activity might arise as the result of Factor VII expression in cells which normally do not express Factor VII, or increased Factor VII expression (leading to, e.g., a symptom of a viral hemorrhagic fever, or a thrombus). A Factor VII-mediated condition or disease may be completely or partially mediated by inappropriate Factor VII functional activity. However, a Factor VII-mediated condition or disease is one in which modulation of Factor VII results in some effect on the underlying condition or disorder (e.g., a Factor VII inhibitor results in some improvement in patient well-being in at least some patients).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “hemorrhagic fever” includes a combination of illnesses caused by a viral infection. Fever and gastrointestinal symptoms are typically followed by capillary hemorrhaging.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “coagulopathy” is any defect in the blood clotting mechanism of a subject. As used herein, a “thrombotic disorder” is any disorder, preferably resulting from unwanted FVII expression, including any disorder characterized by unwanted blood coagulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the phrases “therapeutically effective amount” and “prophylactically effective amount” refer to an amount that provides a therapeutic benefit in the treatment, prevention, or management of a viral hemorrhagic fever, or an overt symptom of such disorder, e.g., hemorraging, fever, weakness, muscle pain, headache, inflammation, or circulatory shock. The specific amount that is therapeutically effective can be readily determined by ordinary medical practitioner, and may vary depending on factors known in the art, such as, e.g. the type of thrombotic disorder, the patient's history and age, the stage of the disease, and the administration of other agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, a “pharmaceutical composition” includes a pharmacologically effective amount of a dsRNA and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used herein, “pharmacologically effective amount,” “therapeutically effective amount” or simply “effective amount” refers to that amount of an RNA effective to produce the intended pharmacological, therapeutic or preventive result. For example, if a given clinical treatment is considered effective when there is at least a 25% reduction in a measurable parameter associated with a disease or disorder, a therapeutically effective amount of a drug for the treatment of that disease or disorder is the amount necessary to effect at least a 25% reduction in that parameter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” refers to a carrier for administration of a therapeutic agent. Such carriers include, but are not limited to, saline, buffered saline, dextrose, water, glycerol, ethanol, and combinations thereof. The term specifically excludes cell culture medium. For drugs administered orally, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include, but are not limited to pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as inert diluents, disintegrating agents, binding agents, lubricating agents, sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preservatives. Suitable inert diluents include sodium and calcium carbonate, sodium and calcium phosphate, and lactose, while corn starch and alginic acid are suitable disintegrating agents. Binding agents may include starch and gelatin, while the lubricating agent, if present, will generally be magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. If desired, the tablets may be coated with a material such as glyceryl mono stearate or glyceryl distearate, to delay absorption in the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, a “transformed cell” is a cell into which a vector has been introduced from which a dsRNA molecule may be expressed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCharacteristic of Nucleic Acid-Lipid Particles\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the invention relates to methods and compositions for producing lipid-encapsulated nucleic acid particles in which nucleic acids are encapsulated within a lipid layer. Such nucleic acid-lipid particles, incorporating siRNA oligonucleotides, are characterized using a variety of biophysical parameters including: (1) drug to lipid ratio; (2) encapsulation efficiency; and (3) particle size. High drug to lipid rations, high encapsulation efficiency, good nuclease resistance and serum stability and controllable particle size, generally less than 200 nm in diameter are desirable. In addition, the nature of the nucleic acid polymer is of significance, since the modification of nucleic acids in an effort to impart nuclease resistance adds to the cost of therapeutics while in many cases providing only limited resistance. Unless stated otherwise, these criteria are calculated in this specification as follows:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acid to lipid ratio is the amount of nucleic acid in a defined volume of preparation divided by the amount of lipid in the same volume. This may be on a mole per mole basis or on a weight per weight basis, or on a weight per mole basis. For final, administration-ready formulations, the nucleic acid:lipid ratio is calculated after dialysis, chromatography and/or enzyme (e.g., nuclease) digestion has been employed to remove as much of the external nucleic acid as possible;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEncapsulation efficiency refers to the drug to lipid ratio of the starting mixture divided by the drug to lipid ratio of the final, administration competent formulation. This is a measure of relative efficiency. For a measure of absolute efficiency, the total amount of nucleic acid added to the starting mixture that ends up in the administration competent formulation, can also be calculated. The amount of lipid lost during the formulation process may also be calculated. Efficiency is a measure of the wastage and expense of the formulation; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSize indicates the size (diameter) of the particles formed. Size distribution may be determined using quasi-elastic light scattering (QELS) on a Nicomp Model 370 sub-micron particle sizer. Particles under 200 nm are preferred for distribution to neo-vascularized (leaky) tissues, such as neoplasms and sites of inflammation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods of Preparing Lipid Particles\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe methods and compositions of the invention make use of certain cationic lipids, the synthesis, preparation and characterization of which is described below and in the accompanying Examples. In addition, the present invention provides methods of preparing lipid particles, including those associated with a therapeutic agent, e.g., a nucleic acid. In the methods described herein, a mixture of lipids is combined with a buffered aqueous solution of nucleic acid to produce an intermediate mixture containing nucleic acid encapsulated in lipid particles wherein the encapsulated nucleic acids are present in a nucleic acid/lipid ratio of about 3 wt % to about 25 wt %, preferably 5 to 15 wt %. The intermediate mixture may optionally be sized to obtain lipid-encapsulated nucleic acid particles wherein the lipid portions are unilamellar vesicles, preferably having a diameter of 30 to 150 nm, more preferably about 40 to 90 nm. The pH is then raised to neutralize at least a portion of the surface charges on the lipid-nucleic acid particles, thus providing an at least partially surface-neutralized lipid-encapsulated nucleic acid composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs described above, several of these cationic lipids are amino lipids that are charged at a pH below the pK\na \nof the amino group and substantially neutral at a pH above the pK\na\n. These cationic lipids are termed titratable cationic lipids and can be used in the formulations of the invention using a two-step process. First, lipid vesicles can be formed at the lower pH with titratable cationic lipids and other vesicle components in the presence of nucleic acids. In this manner, the vesicles will encapsulate and entrap the nucleic acids. Second, the surface charge of the newly formed vesicles can be neutralized by increasing the pH of the medium to a level above the pK\na \nof the titratable cationic lipids present, i.e., to physiological pH or higher. Particularly advantageous aspects of this process include both the facile removal of any surface adsorbed nucleic acid and a resultant nucleic acid delivery vehicle which has a neutral surface. Liposomes or lipid particles having a neutral surface are expected to avoid rapid clearance from circulation and to avoid certain toxicities which are associated with cationic liposome preparations. Additional details concerning these uses of such titratable cationic lipids in the formulation of nucleic acid-lipid particles are provided in U.S. Pat. No. 6,287,591 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,858,225, incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is further noted that the vesicles formed in this manner provide formulations of uniform vesicle size with high content of nucleic acids. Additionally, the vesicles have a size range of from about 30 to about 150 nm, more preferably about 30 to about 90 nm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWithout intending to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the very high efficiency of nucleic acid encapsulation is a result of electrostatic interaction at low pH. At acidic pH (e.g. pH 4.0) the vesicle surface is charged and binds a portion of the nucleic acids through electrostatic interactions. When the external acidic buffer is exchanged for a more neutral buffer (e.g. pH 7.5) the surface of the lipid particle or liposome is neutralized, allowing any external nucleic acid to be removed. More detailed information on the formulation process is provided in various publications (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,287,591 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,858,225).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn view of the above, the present invention provides methods of preparing lipid/nucleic acid formulations. In the methods described herein, a mixture of lipids is combined with a buffered aqueous solution of nucleic acid to produce an intermediate mixture containing nucleic acid encapsulated in lipid particles, e.g., wherein the encapsulated nucleic acids are present in a nucleic acid/lipid ratio of about 10 wt % to about 20 wt %. The intermediate mixture may optionally be sized to obtain lipid-encapsulated nucleic acid particles wherein the lipid portions are unilamellar vesicles, preferably having a diameter of 30 to 150 nm, more preferably about 40 to 90 nm. The pH is then raised to neutralize at least a portion of the surface charges on the lipid-nucleic acid particles, thus providing an at least partially surface-neutralized lipid-encapsulated nucleic acid composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the mixture of lipids includes at least two lipid components: a first amino lipid component of the present invention that is selected from among lipids which have a pKa such that the lipid is cationic at pH below the pKa and neutral at pH above the pKa, and a second lipid component that is selected from among lipids that prevent particle aggregation during lipid-nucleic acid particle formation. In particular embodiments, the amino lipid is a novel cationic lipid of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn preparing the nucleic acid-lipid particles of the invention, the mixture of lipids is typically a solution of lipids in an organic solvent. This mixture of lipids can then be dried to form a thin film or lyophilized to form a powder before being hydrated with an aqueous buffer to form liposomes. Alternatively, in a preferred method, the lipid mixture can be solubilized in a water miscible alcohol, such as ethanol, and this ethanolic solution added to an aqueous buffer resulting in spontaneous liposome formation. In most embodiments, the alcohol is used in the form in which it is commercially available. For example, ethanol can be used as absolute ethanol (100%), or as 95% ethanol, the remainder being water. This method is described in more detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5,976,567).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with the invention, the lipid mixture is combined with a buffered aqueous solution that may contain the nucleic acids. The buffered aqueous solution of is typically a solution in which the buffer has a pH of less than the pK\na \nof the protonatable lipid in the lipid mixture. Examples of suitable buffers include citrate, phosphate, acetate, and MES. A particularly preferred buffer is citrate buffer. Preferred buffers will be in the range of 1-1000 mM of the anion, depending on the chemistry of the nucleic acid being encapsulated, and optimization of buffer concentration may be significant to achieving high loading levels (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,287,591 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,858,225). Alternatively, pure water acidified to pH 5-6 with chloride, sulfate or the like may be useful. In this case, it may be suitable to add 5% glucose, or another non-ionic solute which will balance the osmotic potential across the particle membrane when the particles are dialyzed to remove ethanol, increase the pH, or mixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier such as normal saline. The amount of nucleic acid in buffer can vary, but will typically be from about 0.01 mg/mL to about 200 mg/mL, more preferably from about 0.5 mg/mL to about 50 mg/mL.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe mixture of lipids and the buffered aqueous solution of therapeutic nucleic acids is combined to provide an intermediate mixture. The intermediate mixture is typically a mixture of lipid particles having encapsulated nucleic acids. Additionally, the intermediate mixture may also contain some portion of nucleic acids which are attached to the surface of the lipid particles (liposomes or lipid vesicles) due to the ionic attraction of the negatively-charged nucleic acids and positively-charged lipids on the lipid particle surface (the amino lipids or other lipid making up the protonatable first lipid component are positively charged in a buffer having a pH of less than the pK\na \nof the protonatable group on the lipid). In one group of preferred embodiments, the mixture of lipids is an alcohol solution of lipids and the volumes of each of the solutions is adjusted so that upon combination, the resulting alcohol content is from about 20% by volume to about 45% by volume. The method of combining the mixtures can include any of a variety of processes, often depending upon the scale of formulation produced. For example, when the total volume is about 10-20 mL or less, the solutions can be combined in a test tube and stirred together using a vortex mixer. Large-scale processes can be carried out in suitable production scale glassware.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOptionally, the lipid-encapsulated therapeutic agent (e.g., nucleic acid) complexes which are produced by combining the lipid mixture and the buffered aqueous solution of therapeutic agents (nucleic acids) can be sized to achieve a desired size range and relatively narrow distribution of lipid particle sizes. Preferably, the compositions provided herein will be sized to a mean diameter of from about 70 to about 200 nm, more preferably about 90 to about 130 nm. Several techniques are available for sizing liposomes to a desired size. One sizing method is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,737,323, incorporated herein by reference. Sonicating a liposome suspension either by bath or probe sonication produces a progressive size reduction down to small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) less than about 0.05 microns in size. Homogenization is another method which relies on shearing energy to fragment large liposomes into smaller ones. In a typical homogenization procedure, multilamellar vesicles are recirculated through a standard emulsion homogenizer until selected liposome sizes, typically between about 0.1 and 0.5 microns, are observed. In both methods, the particle size distribution can be monitored by conventional laser-beam particle size determination. For certain methods herein, extrusion is used to obtain a uniform vesicle size.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExtrusion of liposome compositions through a small-pore polycarbonate membrane or an asymmetric ceramic membrane results in a relatively well-defined size distribution. Typically, the suspension is cycled through the membrane one or more times until the desired liposome complex size distribution is achieved. The liposomes may be extruded through successively smaller-pore membranes, to achieve a gradual reduction in liposome size. In some instances, the lipid-nucleic acid compositions which are formed can be used without any sizing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular embodiments, methods of the present invention further comprise a step of neutralizing at least some of the surface charges on the lipid portions of the lipid-nucleic acid compositions. By at least partially neutralizing the surface charges, unencapsulated nucleic acid is freed from the lipid particle surface and can be removed from the composition using conventional techniques. Preferably, unencapsulated and surface adsorbed nucleic acids are removed from the resulting compositions through exchange of buffer solutions. For example, replacement of a citrate buffer (pH about 4.0, used for forming the compositions) with a HEPES-buffered saline (HBS pH about 7.5) solution, results in the neutralization of liposome surface and nucleic acid release from the surface. The released nucleic acid can then be removed via chromatography using standard methods, and then switched into a buffer with a pH above the pKa of the lipid used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOptionally the lipid vesicles (i.e., lipid particles) can be formed by hydration in an aqueous buffer and sized using any of the methods described above prior to addition of the nucleic acid. As described above, the aqueous buffer should be of a pH below the pKa of the amino lipid. A solution of the nucleic acids can then be added to these sized, preformed vesicles. To allow encapsulation of nucleic acids into such “pre-formed” vesicles the mixture should contain an alcohol, such as ethanol. In the case of ethanol, it should be present at a concentration of about 20% (w/w) to about 45% (w/w). In addition, it may be necessary to warm the mixture of pre-formed vesicles and nucleic acid in the aqueous buffer-ethanol mixture to a temperature of about 25° C. to about 50° C. depending on the composition of the lipid vesicles and the nature of the nucleic acid. It will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that optimization of the encapsulation process to achieve a desired level of nucleic acid in the lipid vesicles will require manipulation of variable such as ethanol concentration and temperature. Examples of suitable conditions for nucleic acid encapsulation are provided in the Examples. Once the nucleic acids are encapsulated within the prefromed vesicles, the external pH can be increased to at least partially neutralize the surface charge. Unencapsulated and surface adsorbed nucleic acids can then be removed as described above.\n\n\n \nMethod of Use\n\n\n \n \n \nThe lipid particles of the invention may be used to deliver a therapeutic agent to a cell, in vitro or in vivo. In particular embodiments, the therapeutic agent is a nucleic acid, which is delivered to a cell using a nucleic acid-lipid particles of the invention. While the following description to various methodsof using the lipid particles and related pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are exemplified by description related to nucleic acid-lipid particles, it is understood that these methods and compositions may be readily adapted for the delivery of any therapeutic agent for the treatment of any disease or disorder that would benefit from such treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the invention provides methods for introducing a nucleic acid into a cell. Preferred nucleic acids for introduction into cells are siRNA, immune-stimulating oligonucleotides, plasmids, antisense and ribozymes. These methods may be carried out by contacting the particles or compositions of the invention with the cells for a period of time sufficient for intracellular delivery to occur.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions of the invention can be adsorbed to almost any cell type, e.g., tumor cell lines, including but not limited to HeLa, HCT116, A375, MCF7, B16F10, Hep3b, HUH7, HepG2, Skov3, U87, and PC3 cell lines. Once adsorbed, the nucleic acid-lipid particles can either be endocytosed by a portion of the cells, exchange lipids with cell membranes, or fuse with the cells. Transfer or incorporation of the nucleic acid portion of the complex can take place via any one of these pathways. Without intending to be limited with respect to the scope of the invention, it is believed that in the case of particles taken up into the cell by endocytosis the particles then interact with the endosomal membrane, resulting in destabilization of the endosomal membrane, possibly by the formation of non-bilayer phases, resulting in introduction of the encapsulated nucleic acid into the cell cytoplasm. Similarly in the case of direct fusion of the particles with the cell plasma membrane, when fusion takes place, the liposome membrane is integrated into the cell membrane and the contents of the liposome combine with the intracellular fluid. Contact between the cells and the lipid-nucleic acid compositions, when carried out in vitro, will take place in a biologically compatible medium. The concentration of compositions can vary widely depending on the particular application, but is generally between about 1 μmol and about 10 mmol. In certain embodiments, treatment of the cells with the lipid-nucleic acid compositions will generally be carried out at physiological temperatures (about 37° C.) for periods of time from about 1 to 24 hours, preferably from about 2 to 8 hours. For in vitro applications, the delivery of nucleic acids can be to any cell grown in culture, whether of plant or animal origin, vertebrate or invertebrate, and of any tissue or type. In preferred embodiments, the cells will be animal cells, more preferably mammalian cells, and most preferably human cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one group of embodiments, a lipid-nucleic acid particle suspension is added to 60-80% confluent plated cells having a cell density of from about 10\n3 \nto about 10\n5 \ncells/mL, more preferably about 2×10\n4 \ncells/mL. The concentration of the suspension added to the cells is preferably of from about 0.01 to 20 μg/mL, more preferably about 1 μg/mL.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypical applications include using well known procedures to provide intracellular delivery of siRNA to knock down or silence specific cellular targets. Alternatively applications include delivery of DNA or mRNA sequences that code for therapeutically useful polypeptides. In this manner, therapy is provided for genetic diseases by supplying deficient or absent gene products (i.e., for Duchenne's dystrophy, see Kunkel, et al., \nBrit. Med. Bull. \n45(3):630-643 (1989), and for cystic fibrosis, see Goodfellow, \nNature \n341:102-103 (1989)). Other uses for the compositions of the invention include introduction of antisense oligonucleotides in cells (see, Bennett, et al., \nMol. Pharm. \n41:1023-1033 (1992)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the compositions of the invention can also be used for deliver of nucleic acids to cells in vivo, using methods which are known to those of skill in the art. With respect to application of the invention for delivery of DNA or mRNA sequences, Zhu, et al., \nScience \n261:209-211 (1993), incorporated herein by reference, describes the intravenous delivery of cytomegalovirus (CMV)-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) expression plasmid using DOTMA-DOPE complexes. Hyde, et al., \nNature \n362:250-256 (1993), incorporated herein by reference, describes the delivery of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene to epithelia of the airway and to alveoli in the lung of mice, using liposomes. Brigham, et al., \nAm. J. Med. Sci. \n298:278-281 (1989), incorporated herein by reference, describes the in vivo transfection of lungs of mice with a functioning prokaryotic gene encoding the intracellular enzyme, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). Thus, the compositions of the invention can be used in the treatment of infectious diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore, in another aspect, the formulations of the invention can be used to silence or

compositions are preferably administered parenterally, i.e., intraarticularly, intravenously, intraperitoneally, subcutaneously, or intramuscularly. In particular embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered intravenously or intraperitoneally by a bolus injection. For one example, see Stadler, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,286,634, which is incorporated herein by reference. Intracellular nucleic acid delivery has also been discussed in Straubringer, et al., M\nETHODS IN \nE\nNZYMOLOGY\n, Academic Press, New York. 101:512-527 (1983); Mannino, et al., \nBiotechniques \n6:682-690 (1988); Nicolau, et al., \nCrit. Rev. Ther. Drug Carrier Syst. \n6:239-271 (1989), and Behr, \nAcc. Chem. Res. \n26:274-278 (1993). Still other methods of administering lipid-based therapeutics are described in, for example, Rahman et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,993,754; Sears, U.S. Pat. No. 4,145,410; Papahadjopoulos et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,235,871; Schneider, U.S. Pat. No. 4,224,179; Lenk et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,522,803; and Fountain et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,588,578.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other methods, the pharmaceutical preparations may be contacted with the target tissue by direct application of the preparation to the tissue. The application may be made by topical, “open” or “closed” procedures. By “topical,” it is meant the direct application of the pharmaceutical preparation to a tissue exposed to the environment, such as the skin, oropharynx, external auditory canal, and the like. “Open” procedures are those procedures which include incising the skin of a patient and directly visualizing the underlying tissue to which the pharmaceutical preparations are applied. This is generally accomplished by a surgical procedure, such as a thoracotomy to access the lungs, abdominal laparotomy to access abdominal viscera, or other direct surgical approach to the target tissue. “Closed” procedures are invasive procedures in which the internal target tissues are not directly visualized, but accessed via inserting instruments through small wounds in the skin. For example, the preparations may be administered to the peritoneum by needle lavage. Likewise, the pharmaceutical preparations may be administered to the meninges or spinal cord by infusion during a lumbar puncture followed by appropriate positioning of the patient as commonly practiced for spinal anesthesia or metrazamide imaging of the spinal cord. Alternatively, the preparations may be administered through endoscopic devices.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe lipid-nucleic acid compositions can also be administered in an aerosol inhaled into the lungs (see, Brigham, et al., \nAm. J. Sci. \n298(4):278-281 (1989)) or by direct injection at the site of disease (Culver, Human Gene Therapy, MaryAnn Liebert, Inc., Publishers, New York. pp. 70-71 (1994)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe methods of the invention may be practiced in a variety of hosts. Preferred hosts include mammalian species, such as humans, non-human primates, dogs, cats, cattle, horses, sheep, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDosages for the lipid-therapeutic agent particles of the invention will depend on the ratio of therapeutic agent to lipid and the administrating physician's opinion based on age, weight, and condition of the patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the invention provides a method of modulating the expression of a target polynucleotide or polypeptide. These methods generally comprise contacting a cell with a lipid particle of the invention that is associated with a nucleic acid capable of modulating the expression of a target polynucleotide or polypeptide. As used herein, the term “modulating” refers to altering the expression of a target polynucleotide or polypeptide. In different embodiments, modulating can mean increasing or enhancing, or it can mean decreasing or reducing. Methods of measuring the level of expression of a target polynucleotide or polypeptide are known and available in the arts and include, e.g., methods employing reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemical techniques. In particular embodiments, the level of expression of a target polynucleotide or polypeptide is increased or reduced by at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, or greater than 50% as compared to an appropriate control value. For example, if increased expression of a polypeptide desired, the nucleic acid may be an expression vector that includes a polynucleotide that encodes the desired polypeptide. On the other hand, if reduced expression of a polynucleotide or polypeptide is desired, then the nucleic acid may be, e.g., an antisense oligonucleotide, siRNA, or microRNA that comprises a polynucleotide sequence that specifically hybridizes to a polnucleotide that encodes the target polypeptide, thereby disrupting expression of the target polynucleotide or polypeptide. Alternatively, the nucleic acid may be a plasmid that expresses such an antisense oligonucletoide, siRNA, or microRNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one particular embodiment, the invention provides a method of modulating the expression of a polypeptide by a cell, comprising providing to a cell a lipid particle that consists of or consists essentially of a cationic lipid of formula A, a neutral lipid, a sterol, a PEG or PEG-modified lipid, e.g., in a molar ratio of about 35-65% of cationic lipid of formula A, 3-12% of the neutral lipid, 15-45% of the sterol, and 0.5-10% of the PEG or PEG-modified lipid, wherein the lipid particle is associated with a nucleic acid capable of modulating the expression of the polypeptide. In particular embodiments, the molar lipid ratio is approximately 60/7.5/31/1.5, 57.5/7.5/31.5/3.5 or 50/10/38.5/1.5 (mol % LIPID A/DSPC/Chol/PEG-DMG) or 57.1/7.1/34.4/1.4 (mol % LIPID A/DPPC/Chol/PEG-cDMA). In some embodiments, the lipide particle also includes a targeting moiety such as a targeting lipid described herein (e.g., the lipid particle consists essentially of a cationic lipid of formula A, a neutral lipid, a sterol, a PEG or PEG-modified lipid and a targeting moiety). In another group of embodiments, the neutral lipid in these compositions is replaced with DPPC, POPC, DOPE or SM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular embodiments, the therapeutic agent is selected from an siRNA, a microRNA, an antisense oligonucleotide, and a plasmid capable of expressing an siRNA, a microRNA, or an antisense oligonucleotide, and wherein the siRNA, microRNA, or antisense RNA comprises a polynucleotide that specifically binds to a polynucleotide that encodes the polypeptide, or a complement thereof, such that the expression of the polypeptide is reduced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the nucleic acid is a plasmid that encodes the polypeptide or a functional variant or fragment thereof, such that expression of the polypeptide or the functional variant or fragment thereof is increased.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn related embodiments, the invention provides a method of treating a disease or disorder characterized by overexpression of a polypeptide in a subject, comprising providing to the subject a pharmaceutical composition of the invention, wherein the therapeutic agent is selected from an siRNA, a microRNA, an antisense oligonucleotide, and a plasmid capable of expressing an siRNA, a microRNA, or an antisense oligonucleotide, and wherein the siRNA, microRNA, or antisense RNA comprises a polynucleotide that specifically binds to a polynucleotide that encodes the polypeptide, or a complement thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition comprises a lipid particle that consists of or consists essentially of a cationic lipid of formula A, DSPC, Chol and PEG-DMG, PEG-C-DOMG or PEG-cDMA, e.g., in a molar ratio of about 35-65% of cationic lipid of formula A, 3-12% of the neutral lipid, 15-45% of the sterol, and 0.5-10% of the PEG or PEG-modified lipid PEG-DMG, PEG-C-DOMG or PEG-CDMA, wherein the lipid particle is assocated with the therapeutic nucleic acid. In particular embodiments, the molar lipid ratio is approximately 60/7.5/31/1.5, 57.5/7.5/31.5/3.5 or 50/10/38.5/1.5 (mol % LIPID A/DSPC/Chol/PEG-DMG) or 57.1/7.1/34.4/1.4 (mol % LIPID A/DPPC/Chol/PEG-cDMA). In some embodiments, the lipid particle also includes a targeting lipid described herein (e.g., the lipid particle consists essentially of a cationic lipid of formula A, a neutral lipid, a sterol, a PEG or PEG-modified lipid and a targeting moiety). In some embodiments, when the targeting lipid includes a PEG moiety and is added to an existing liposomal formulation, the amount of PEG-modified lipid is reduced such that the total amount of PEG-moidfied lipid (i.e., PEG-modified lipid, for example PEG-DMG, and the PEG-containing targeting lipid) is kept at a constant mol percentage (e.g., 0.3 mol %, 1.4 mol %, 1.5 mol %, or 3.5 mol %). In another group of embodiments, the neutral lipid in these compositions is replaced with DPPC, POPC, DOPE or SM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another related embodiment, the invention includes a method of treating a disease or disorder characterized by underexpression of a polypeptide in a subject, comprising providing to the subject a pharmaceutical composition of the invention, wherein the therapeutic agent is a plasmid that encodes the polypeptide or a functional variant or fragment thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention further provides a method of inducing an immune response in a subject, comprising providing to the subject the pharmaceutical composition of the invention, wherein the therapeutic agent is an immunostimulatory oligonucleotide. In certain embodiments, the immune response is a humoral or mucosal immune response consists of or consists essentially of a cationic lipid of formula A, DSPC, Chol and PEG-DMG, PEG-C-DOMG or PEG-cDMA, e.g., in a molar ratio of about 35-65% of cationic lipid of formula A, 3-12% of the neutral lipid, 15-45% of the sterol, and 0.5-10% of the PEG or PEG-modified lipid PEG-DMG, PEG-C-DOMG or PEG-cDMA, wherein the lipid particle is assocated with the therapeutic nucleic acid. In particular embodiments, the molar lipid ratio is approximately 60/7.5/31/1.5, 57.5/7.5/31.5/3.5 or 50/10/38.5/1.5 (mol % LIPID A/DSPC/Chol/PEG-DMG) or 57.1/7.1/34.4/1.4 (mol % LIPID A/DPPC/Chol/PEG-cDMA). In some embodiments, the lipid particle also includes a targeting lipid described herein (e.g., the lipid particle consists essentially of a cationic lipid of formula A, a neutral lipid, a sterol, a PEG or PEG-modified lipid and a targeting moiety). In some embodiments, when the targeting lipid includes a PEG moiety and is added to an existing liposomal formulation, the amount of PEG-modified lipid is reduced such that the total amount of PEG-moidfied lipid (i.e., PEG-modified lipid, for example PEG-DMG, and the PEG-containing targeting lipid) is kept at a constant mol percentage (e.g., 0.3 mol %, 1.4 mol %, 1.5 mol %, or 3.5 mol %). In another group of embodiments, the neutral lipid in these compositions is replaced with DPPC, POPC, DOPE or SM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn further embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition is provided to the subject in combination with a vaccine or antigen. Thus, the invention itself provides vaccines comprising a lipid particle of the invention, which comprises an immunostimulatory oligonucleotide, and is also associated with an antigen to which an immune response is desired. In particular embodiments, the antigen is a tumor antigen or is associated with an infective agent, such as, e.g., a virus, bacteria, or parasiste.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of tumor antigens, infections agent antigens, and antigens associated with other disease are well known in the art and examples of these are described in references cited herein. Examples of antigens suitable for use in the invention include, but are not limited to, polypeptide antigens and DNA antigens. Specific examples of antigens are Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, small pox, polio, anthrax, influenza, typhus, tetanus, measles, rotavirus, diphtheria, pertussis, tuberculosis, and rubella antigens. In one embodiment, the antigen is a Hepatitis B recombinant antigen. In other aspects, the antigen is a Hepatitis A recombinant antigen. In another aspect, the antigen is a tumor antigen. Examples of such tumor-associated antigens are MUC-1, EBV antigen and antigens associated with Burkitt's lymphoma. In a further aspect, the antigen is a tyrosinase-related protein tumor antigen recombinant antigen. Those of skill in the art will know of other antigens suitable for use in the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTumor-associated antigens suitable for use in the subject invention include both mutated and non-mutated molecules that may be indicative of single tumor type, shared among several types of tumors, and/or exclusively expressed or overexpressed in tumor cells in comparison with normal cells.

The composition includes the agent, e.g., a dsRNA, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The pharmaceutical composition is useful for treating a disease or disorder associated with the expression or activity of the gene. Such pharmaceutical compositions are formulated based on the mode of delivery. One example is compositions that are formulated for systemic administration via parenteral delivery.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions including the identified agent are administered in dosages sufficient to inhibit expression of the target gene, e.g., the Factor VII gene. In general, a suitable dose of dsRNA agent will be in the range of 0.01 to 5.0 milligrams per kilogram body weight of the recipient per day, generally in the range of 1 microgram to 1 mg per kilogram body weight per day. The pharmaceutical composition may be administered once daily, or the dsRNA may be administered as two, three, or more sub-doses at appropriate intervals throughout the day or even using continuous infusion or delivery through a controlled release formulation. In that case, the dsRNA contained in each sub-dose must be correspondingly smaller in order to achieve the total daily dosage. The dosage unit can also be compounded for delivery over several days, e.g., using a conventional sustained release formulation which provides sustained release of the dsRNA over a several day period. Sustained release formulations are well known in the art and are particularly useful for vaginal delivery of agents, such as could be used with the agents of the invention. In this embodiment, the dosage unit contains a corresponding multiple of the daily dose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe skilled artisan will appreciate that certain factors may influence the dosage and timing required to effectively treat a subject, including but not limited to the severity of the disease or disorder, previous treatments, the general health and/or age of the subject, and other diseases present. Moreover, treatment of a subject with a therapeutically effective amount of a composition can include a single treatment or a series of treatments. Estimates of effective dosages and in vivo half-lives for the individual dsRNAs encompassed by the invention can be made using conventional methodologies or on the basis of in vivo testing using an appropriate animal model, as described elsewhere herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the lipid-nucleic acid particles of the invention are prepared according to standard techniques and further comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Generally, normal saline will be employed as the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Other suitable carriers include, e.g., water, buffered water, 0.9% saline, 0.3% glycine, and the like, including glycoproteins for enhanced stability, such as albumin, lipoprotein, globulin, etc. In compositions comprising saline or other salt containing carriers, the carrier is preferably added following lipid particle formation. Thus, after the lipid-nucleic acid compositions are formed, the compositions can be diluted into pharmaceutically acceptable carriers such as normal saline.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe resulting pharmaceutical preparations may be sterilized by conventional, well known sterilization techniques. The aqueous solutions can then be packaged for use or filtered under aseptic conditions and lyophilized, the lyophilized preparation being combined with a sterile aqueous solution prior to administration. The compositions may contain pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliary substances as required to approximate physiological conditions, such as pH adjusting and buffering agents, tonicity adjusting agents and the like, for example, sodium acetate, sodium lactate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, etc. Additionally, the lipidic suspension may include lipid-protective agents which protect lipids against free-radical and lipid-peroxidative damages on storage. Lipophilic free-radical quenchers, such as α-tocopherol and water-soluble iron-specific chelators, such as ferrioxamine, are suitable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe concentration of lipid particle or lipid-nucleic acid particle in the pharmaceutical formulations can vary widely, i.e., from less than about 0.01%, usually at or at least about 0.05-5% to as much as 10 to 30% by weight and will be selected primarily by fluid volumes, viscosities, etc., in accordance with the particular mode of administration selected. For example, the concentration may be increased to lower the fluid load associated with treatment. This may be particularly desirable in patients having atherosclerosis-associated congestive heart failure or severe hypertension. Alternatively, complexes composed of irritating lipids may be diluted to low concentrations to lessen inflammation at the site of administration. In one group of embodiments, the nucleic acid will have an attached label and will be used for diagnosis (by indicating the presence of complementary nucleic acid). In this instance, the amount of complexes administered will depend upon the particular label used, the disease state being diagnosed and the judgement of the clinician but will generally be between about 0.01 and about 50 mg per kilogram of body weight (e.g., of the nucleic acid agent), preferably between about 0.1 and about 5 mg/kg of body weight. In some embodiments a complex administered includes from about 0.004 and about 50 mg per kilogram of body weight of neucleic acid agent (e.g., from about 0.006 mg/kg to about 0.2 mg/kg).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs noted above, the lipid-therapeutic agent (e.g., nucleic acid) particels of the invention may include polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified phospholipids, PEG-ceramide, or ganglioside G\nM1\n-modified lipids or other lipids effective to prevent or limit aggregation. Addition of such components does not merely prevent complex aggregation. Rather, it may also provide a means for increasing circulation lifetime and increasing the delivery of the lipid-nucleic acid composition to the target tissues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides lipid-therapeutic agent compositions in kit form. The kit will typically be comprised of a container that is compartmentalized for holding the various elements of the kit. The kit will contain the particles or pharmaceutical compositions of the invention, preferably in dehydrated or concentrated form, with instructions for their rehydration or dilution and administration. In certain embodiments, the particles comprise the active agent, while in other embodiments, they do not.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions containing an agent identified by the liver screening model may be administered in a number of ways depending upon whether local or systemic treatment is desired and upon the area to be treated. Administration may be topical, pulmonary, e.g., by inhalation or insufflation of powders or aerosols, including by nebulizer; intratracheal, intranasal, epidermal and transdermal), oral or parenteral. Admininstration may also be designed to result in preferential localization to particular tissues through local delivery, e.g. by direct intraarticular injection into joints, by rectal administration for direct delivery to the gut and intestines, by intravaginal administration for delivery to the cervix and vagina, by intravitreal administration for delivery to the eye. Parenteral administration includes intravenous, intraarterial, intraarticular, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal or intramuscular injection or infusion; or intracranial, e.g., intrathecal or intraventricular, administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions and formulations for topical administration may include transdermal patches, ointments, lotions, creams, gels, drops, suppositories, sprays, liquids and powders. Conventional pharmaceutical carriers, aqueous, powder or oily bases, thickeners and the like may be necessary or desirable. Coated condoms, gloves and the like may also be useful.

No. 09/315,298 filed on May 20, 1999 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions and formulations for oral administration include powders or granules, microparticulates, nanoparticulates, suspensions or solutions in water or non-aqueous media, capsules, gel capsules, sachets, tablets or minitablets. Thickeners, flavoring agents, diluents, emulsifiers, dispersing aids or binders may be desirable.

Solvents and volatiles were removed under vacuum and the residue was purified by chromatography (first Ethyl acetate then 5-10% MeOH/DCM as a gradient elution) to get the required compound 4c as white solid (0.92 g, 48%). \n1\nH NMR (CDCl\n3\n, 400 MHz) δ=5.22-5.15 (m, 1H), 4.16 (dd, J=4.00 Hz, 11.00 Hz, 1H), 4.06 (dd, J=5.00 Hz, 11.00 Hz, 1H), 3.81-3.75 (m, 2H), 3.70-3.20 (m, —O—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—O—, PEG-CH\n2\n), 1.80-1.70 (m, 2H), 1.60-1.48 (m, 4H), 1.31-1.15 (m, 64H), 0.85 (t, J=6.5 Hz, 6H). MS range found: 2774-2948.\n\n\n \nExample 6\n\n\nIn Vivo Rodent Factor VII Silencing Experiments\n\n\n \n \n \nC57BL/6 mice (Charles River Labs, MA) and Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Labs, MA) received either saline or formulated siRNA via tail vein injection at a volume of 0.01 mL/g. At various time points after administration, serum samples were collected by retroorbital bleed. Serum levels of Factor VII protein were determined in samples using a chromogenic assay (Biophen FVII, Aniara Corporation, OH). To determine liver mRNA levels of Factor VII, animals were sacrificed and livers were harvested and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissue lysates were prepared from the frozen tissues and liver mRNA levels of Factor VII were quantified using a branched DNA assay (QuantiGene Assay, Panomics, CA).\n\n\n \nExample 7\n\n\nRegulation of Mammalian Gene Expression Using Nucleic Acid-Lipid Particles\n\n\n \n \n \nFactor VII (FVII), a prominent protein in the coagulation cascade, is synthesized in the liver (hepatocytes) and secreted into the plasma. FVII levels in plasma can be determined by a simple, plate-based colorimetric assay. As such, FVII represents a convenient model for determining sirna-mediated downregulation of hepatocyte-derived proteins, as well as monitoring plasma concentrations and tissue distribution of the nucleic acid lipid particles and siRNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFactor VII Knockdown in Mice\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFVII activity was evaluated in FVII siRNA-treated animals at 24 hours after intravenous (bolus) injection in C57BL/6 mice. FVII was measured using a commercially available kit for determining protein levels in serum or tissue, following the manufacturer's instructions at a microplate scale. FVII reduction was determined against untreated control mice, and the results were expressed as % Residual FVII. Four dose levels (2, 5, 12.5, 25 mg/kg FVII siRNA) were used in the initial screen of each novel liposome composition, and this dosing was expanded in subsequent studies based on the results obtained in the initial screen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDetermination of Tolerability\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe tolerability of each novel liposomal siRNA formulation was evaluated by monitoring weight change, cageside observations, clinical chemistry and, in some instances, hematology. Animal weights were recorded prior to treatment and at 24 hours after treatment. Data was recorded as % Change in Body Weight. In addition to body weight measurements, a full clinical chemistry panel, including liver function markers, was obtained at each dose level (2, 5, 12.5 and 25 mg/kg siRNA) at 24 hours post-injection using an aliquot of the serum collected for FVII analysis. Samples were sent to the Central Laboratory for Veterinarians (Langley, BC) for analysis. In some instances, additional mice were included in the treatment group to allow collection of whole blood for hematology analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDetermination of Therapeutic Index\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherapeutic index (TI) is an arbitrary parameter generated by comparing measures of toxicity and activity. For these studies, TI was determined as:\n\n\n \n \n \nTI=MTD(maximum tolerated dose)/ED\n50\n(dose for 50% \nFVII \nknockdown)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe MTD for these studies was set as the lowest dose causing >7% decrease in body weight and a >200-fold increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), a clinical chemistry marker with good specificity for liver damage in rodents. The ED\n50 \nwas determined from FVII dose-activity curves.\n\n\n \nExample 8\n\n\nGeneral Protocol for the Extrusion Method\n\n\n \n \n \nLipids (Lipid A, DSPC, cholesterol, DMG-PEG) are solubilized and mixed in ethanol according to the desired molar ratio. Liposomes are formed by an ethanol injection method where mixed lipids are added to sodium acetate buffer at pH 5.2. This results in the spontaneous formation of liposomes in 35% ethanol. The liposomes are extruded through a 0.08 μm polycarbonate membrane at least 2 times. A stock siRNA solution was prepared in sodium acetate and 35% ethanol and was added to the liposome to load. The siRNA-liposome solution was incubated at 37° C. for 30 min and, subsequently, diluted. Ethanol was removed and exchanged to PBS buffer by dialysis or tangential flow filtration. A flow chart of this method is shown in \nFIG. 1\n.\n\n\n \nExample 9\n\n\nGeneral Protocol for the In-Line Mixing Method\n\n\n \n \n \nIndividual and separate stock solutions are prepared—one containing lipid and the other siRNA. Lipid stock containing lipid A, DSPC, cholesterol and PEG lipid is prepared by solubilized in 90% ethanol. The remaining 10% is low pH citrate buffer. The concentration of the lipid stock is 4 mg/mL. The pH of this citrate buffer can range between pH 3-5, depending on the type of fusogenic lipid employed. The siRNA is also solubilized in citrate buffer at a concentration of 4 mg/mL. For small scale, 5 mL of each stock solution is prepared.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStock solutions are completely clear and lipids must be completely solubilized before combining with siRNA. Therefore stock solutions may be heated to completely solubilize the lipids. The siRNAs used in the process may be unmodified oligonucleotides or modified and may be conjugated with lipophilic moieties such as cholesterol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe individual stocks are combined by pumping each solution to a T-junction. A dual-head Watson-Marlow pump is used to simultaneously control the start and stop of the two streams. A 1.6 mm polypropylene tubing is further downsized to a 0.8 mm tubing in order to increase the linear flow rate. The polypropylene line (ID=0.8 mm) are attached to either side of a T-junction. The polypropylene T has a linear edge of 1.6 mm for a resultant volume of 4.1 mm\n3\n. Each of the large ends (1.6 mm) of polypropylene line is placed into test tubes containing either solubilized lipid stock or solubilized siRNA. After the T-junction a single tubing is placed where the combined stream will emit. The tubing is then extending into a container with 2× volume of PBS. The PBS is rapidly stiffing. The flow rate for the pump is at a setting of 300 rpm or 110 mL/min. Ethanol is removed and exchanged for PBS by dialysis. The lipid formulations are then concentrated using centrifugation or diafiltration to an appropriate working concentration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 3\n shows a schematic of the in-line mixing method and \nFIG. 4\n is a schematic of pump set-up.\n\n\n \nExample 10\n\n\nEfficacy of Formulations with Various Lipid Ratios\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperimental Plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimals C57BL/6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal 39\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nConc.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nVehicle Lipid A/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGroup\n\n\n(mg/\n\n\nInj Vol.\n\n\nDose*\n\n\nDSPC/Chol/PEG-DMG\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup\n\n\nsize\n\n\nmL)\n\n\n(uL/g)\n\n\n(mg/kg)\n\n\n(charge ratio)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n3\n\n\n \n\n\n10\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n \nPBS\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n0.10\n\n\n10\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n45/10/40/5 (1.5N/P)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n0.03\n\n\n10\n\n\n0.3\n\n\n45/10/40/5 (1.5N/P)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n0.10\n\n\n10\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n50/10/35/5 (1.5N/P)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n3\n\n\n0.03\n\n\n10\n\n\n0.3\n\n\n50/10/35/5 (1.5N/P)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n3\n\n\n0.10\n\n\n10\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n45/15/35/5 (1.5N/P)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n3\n\n\n0.03\n\n\n10\n\n\n0.3\n\n\n45/15/35/5 (1.5N/P)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n3\n\n\n0.10\n\n\n10\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n45/25/25/5 (1.5N/P)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n3\n\n\n0.03\n\n\n10\n\n\n0.3\n\n\n45/25/25/5 (1.5N/P)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n3\n\n\n0.01\n\n\n10\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n57.5/10/30 (2.5N/P)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n3\n\n\n0.003\n\n\n10\n\n\n0.03\n\n\n57.5/10/30 (2.5N/P)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n3\n\n\n0.01\n\n\n10\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n58.5/10/30 (1.5N/P)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\n3\n\n\n0.003\n\n\n10\n\n\n0.03\n\n\n58.5/10/30 (1.5N/P)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to the results shown \nFIG. 4\n, 10 mol % of DSPC and 30 mol % of cholesterol are favorable.

shows the efficacy of various formulations in rat.\n\n\n \nExample 19\n\n\nRole of ApoE in the Cellular Uptake of Liposomes in HeLa Cells\n\n\n \n \n \nThis study compared whether pre-complexation with human recombinant ApoE may increase the uptake of our LNP05 neutral liposome formulation in vitro in HeLa cells. Furthermore we compared the uptake of LNP05 plus or minus ApoE to the uptake of two other liposomes LNP01 (ND98, Cholesterol, and PEG-Ceramide C16) and SNALP (PEG-cDMA; DLinDMA; DPPC; cholesterol) under the same conditions.\n\n\n \nExperimental Protocol:\n\n\n \n \n \nHeLa cells were seeded in 96 well plates (Grenier) at 6000 cells per well overnight. Three different liposome formulations of Alexa-\nfluor\n 647 labeled GFP siRNA: 1) LNP01, 2) SNALP, 3) LNP05 were diluted in one of 3 media conditions to a 50 nM final concentration. Media conditions examined were OptiMem, DMEM with 10% FBS or DMEM with 10% FBS plus 10 ug/mL of human recombinant ApoE (Fitzgerald Industries). The indicated liposomes either in media or in media-precomplexed with ApoE for 10 minutes were added to cells for either 4, 6, or 24 hours. Three replicated were performed for each experimental condition. After addition to HeLa cells in plates for indicated time points cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes then nuclei and cytoplasm stained with DAPI and Syto dye. Images were acquired using an Opera spinning disc automated confocal system from Perkin Elmer. Quantitation of \nAlexa Fluor\n 647 siRNA uptake was performed using Acapella software. Four different parameters were quanitifed: 1) Cell number, 2) the number of siRNA positive spots per field, 3) the number of siRNA positive spots per cell and 4) the integrated spot signal or the average number of siRNA spots per cell times the average spot intensity. The average spot signal therefore is a rough estimate of the total amount of siRNA content per cell. Quantitation of Alexa-fluor siRNA uptake was performed only for the 6 hour time point.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 16\n illustrates the effect of ApoE on various liposome formulations. The uptake of more neutral charged liposomes SNALP and LNP05 into cells was enhanced by the pre-complexation with human recombinant ApoE ay 6 hours. The uptake into HeLa cells of the liposome LNP01 which carried a positive charge was unaffected by ApoE presence. The number of spots per field, spots per cell and integrated spot intensity was enhanced roughly 3 fold for SNALP but dramatically enhanced for LNP05 as much as 20 fold. Almost no uptake of LNP05 particles in the absence of ApoE at 6 hours and even at 24 hours. ApoE binding to neutral liposomes particularly LNP05 can dramatically enhance the cellular uptake of these lipid nanoparticles.\n\n\n \nExample 20\n\n\nEfficacy of LNP08 Liposomes Show ApoE Dependence of in Mice\n\n\n \n \n \nTo further examine the role of ApoE in efficacy of various liposome formulations, wildtype and ApoE knockout mice were administered LNP08 liposomes containing the AD-1661 siRNA composition, at 0.2, 0.067, and 0.022 mg/kg. \nFIG. 17\n shows dose-dependent attenuation of FVII protein levels in wild type but not ApoE deficient knockout mice when administered with LNP08 liposomes, suggesting a role of ApoE in cellular uptake and/or delivery to the liver. Administration of LNP08 or LNP05 liposomes premixed with different ApoE lipoprotein at different concentrations results in reduction of FVII protein levels in the ApoE knockout mice; attenuation of FVII protein levels were also observed in wild type mice using some, but not all, ApoE containing liposomes (data not shown). Further, wildtype and ApoE knockout mice were administered LNP09 liposomes (LNP09 is a lipid A-containing LNP) containing the AD-1661 siRNA composition at 0.2 mg/kg. As shown in \nFIG. 18\n, lipid A activity could be rescued in ApoE knockout mice by premixing LNP09 (an lipid A-containing LNP) with ApoE.\n\n\n \nExample 21\n\n\nIncorporation of GalNAc Lipids into Liposome Formulations\n\n\n \n \n \nTo explore potential alternate delivery mechanisms, in vivo experiments were performed using liposome formulations comprising N-acetyl galactosamine (GalNAc) conjugated lipids. GalNAc was chosen as a possible targeting ligand as it is known that the GalNAc receptor is thought to be highly expressed in the liver. A study was therefore performed using C57BL/6 and ApoE knockout mice essentially as described in Example 6 to test the efficacy of the LNP08 formulations further comprising various concentrations of GalNAc3-DSG and GalNAc3-PEG-DSG lipids. In all experiments, the total amount of PEG-conjugated lipids was kept constant (e.g., where 0.5% mol of GalNAc3-PEG is added, the corresponding amount of PEG-DMG was decreased by 0.5% mol to keep the total PEG-lipid at 1.5% mol). Three animals were used for each of the nine groups per genotype in the experiment for a total of 54 animals:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTar-\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup\n\n\nget\n\n\n \nsiRNA\n \n \nVehicle\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nPBS\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nFVII\n\n\n1661\n\n\nLNP08 with 0.05% mol GALNAc3-\nDSG\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nFVII\n\n\n1661\n\n\nLNP08 with 0.15% mol GALNAc3-\nDSG\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nFVII\n\n\n1661\n\n\nLNP08 with 0.5% mol GALNAc3-\nDSG\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nFVII\n\n\n1661\n\n\nLNP08 with 1.5% mol GALNAc3-DSG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nFVII\n\n\n1661\n\n\nLNP08 with 0.05% mol GALNAc3-PEG-DSG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nFVII\n\n\n1661\n\n\nLNP08 with 0.15% mol GALNAc3-PEG-DSG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nFVII\n\n\n1661\n\n\nLNP08 with 0.5% mol GALNAc3-PEG-\nDSG\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nFVII\n\n\n1661\n\n\nLNP08 with 1.5% mol GALNAc3-PEG-DSG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach animal received 0.2 mg/kg of a saline control (PBS) or an AD-1661 (1661) siRNA composition targeting FVII expression, formulated as described in the above table, via tail vein injection at a volume of approximately 0.01 mL/g.

Primary hepatocytes were seeded at 20,000 cells per well similarly but on collagen coated plates. The following morning LNP08 or LNP01 formulated GFP targeted Alexa-\nfluor\n 647 tagged siRNAs were incubated in OptiMem, DMEM or DMEM with 10% FBS media plus or minus concentrations of ApoE3 (Fitzgerald Research) ranging from 0.01 to 20 ug/mL final in solution. Incubations were allowed to proceed for 10-60 minutes in a 37 degree incubator. Media was removed from cells cultured overnight and the liposome mixtures +/−ApoE, added to cells for the indicated time periods ranging from 15 minutes up to 6 hours. At that time cells were either fixed for 30 minutes in 4% paraformaldehyde and counterstained with DAPI to visualize nuclei, or incubated for 30 minutes with 2 ug/mL of Hoescht dye also to visualize nuclei and imaged live. Images were acquired using an Opera spinning disk confocal imaging system (Perkin Elmer) using a 20× objective. Quantitation of siRNA uptake into cells from the images was performed using Acapella software (Perkin Elmer).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFIG. 22\n, pre-complexation of lipid A liposomes dramatically enhanced the uptake of lipid A liposomes into multiple cell types in vitro. Similar results were obtained when uptake of LNP01 vs. LNP08+/−ApoE was examined in primary hepatocytes.\n\n\n \nExample 25\n\n\nUptake of BODIPY Labeled Liposomes Pre-Complexed with ApoE in Hep3B GFP Cells\n\n\n \n \n \nThe goal of these experiments was to investigate whether ApoE pre-complexation to liposomes increased the cellular uptake of the entire LNP particle as compared to just the encapsulated siRNA. To perform these experiments a new version of the lipid A was synthesized with a fluorescent BODIPY group attached. This labeled lipid was incorporated at a 10% ratio of the total amount of unlabeled lipid A in a standard LNP08 formulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe uptake of these lipids was performed similarly to the above experiment done with all unlabeled lipid A in the formulation. The difference being that following the uptake of the liposomal formulation with labeled lipid A images in both the AF647 (siRNA) and BODIPY (lipid A) channel were acquired. The amount of both the siRNA and BODIPY labeled lipid in the presence and absence of ApoE after image acquisition on the Opera system was determined again using Acapella software.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFIG. 23\n (data are average of 30 fields, 10 each from 3 replicates wells), experiments with labeled lipid A revealed that pre-complexation of liposomes with ApoE enhanced the uptake of the entire lipid A based LNP containing the siRNA and not just the siRNA itself.\n\n\n \nExample 26\n\n\nEffect of ApoE2, ApoE3, or ApoE4 on mRNA Silencing in HeLa-GFP Cells\n\n\n \n \n \nThe goal of these experiments was to determine if pre-complexation of lipid A containing liposomes with ApoE enhanced not only the uptake of the liposomes but also mRNA target silencing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHeLa-GFP cells were seeded in 24 well plates overnight at a density of ˜50,000 cells per well. The following morning LNP08 formulated GFP targeted Alexa-\nfluor\n 647 tagged siRNAs were incubated in DMEM or DMEM with 10% FBS media plus or minus concentrations of ApoE3 (Fitzgerald Research) ranging from 0.01 to 20 ug/mL. Incubations were allowed to proceed for 10 or 60 minutes in a 37 degree incubator. Media was removed from cells cultured overnight and the liposome mixtures +/−ApoE3, added to cells. After 24 hours incubation the media was removed and the cells lysed in Lysis buffer (Epicentre)+Proteinase K (50 ug/mL). Lysates were incubated for 2 hours at 65 degrees with constant shaking. Lysates were analyzed for GFP mRNA knockdown using the Quantigene branched DNA assay from Panomics. Probes recognizing target GFP and housekeeping Gapdh were run in triplicate for each sample. Data were expressed as a percentage of untreated control GFP/Gapdh mRNA ratios. In some experiments (only when specifically noted) alternative ApoE isoforms ApoE2 or ApoE4 were used for pre-complexation to liposomes in place of ApoE3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFIGS. 24 and 25\n, pre-complexation with ApoE enhanced silencing with lipid A containing liposomes. \nFIG. 26\n demonstrates that other isoforms ApoE2 or ApoE4 enhanced LNP08 silencing comparably to ApoE3 in HeLa cells. These results suggest that ApoE3 as well as other isoforms of ApoE, either ApoE2 or ApoE4 enhance the mRNA silencing mediated by lipid A containing liposomes likely by mediating more efficient cellular uptake of the particles.\n\n\n \nExample 27\n\n\nFolate Liposomes\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTargeting moiety:\n\n\nFolate-PEG2000-DSPE (Avanti) C18 lipid anchor\n\n\nCompositions: LNP08 formulations, wherein the amount of PEG-DMG was replaced with varying amounts of the Folate-PEG2000-DSPE:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nComposition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(Lipid A:DSPC:Cholesterol:PEG-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDMG:Folate-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFolate-PEG2000-DSPE content\n\n\nPEG2000:DSPE) in \nmol %\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  0 mol %\n\n\n60:7.5:31:1.5:0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.05 mol %\n\n\n60:7.5:31:1.45:0.05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.15 mol %\n\n\n60:7.5:31:1.35:0.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 0.5 mol %\n\n\n60:7.5:31:1.0:0.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSize:\n\n\nNP08, 0.05 mol %, 0.15 mol %˜80 nm\n\n\n0.5 mol %˜120 nm (AD-1955) 180 nm (AD-18747)\n\n\nEncapsulation:\n\n\n˜90% (for the AD-1955 liposomes)\n\n\nNot determined for AD-18747 liposomes since A647 interferes in the assay\n\n\nsiRNAs: L\n\n\nAD-1955 for binding studies\n\n\nAD-18747 (active GFP siRNA with Alexa647 on the 3′ of the antisense)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAD-18747:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSS#\n\n\n \n\n\nSS#\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nsense\n\n\nSense seq\n\n\nantisense\n\n\nAntisense seq\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA-32593\n\n\nAcAuGAAGcAGcACGACuUdTsdT\n\n\nA-32592\n\n\nAAGUCGUGCUGCUUCAUGUdTdTL48\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGFP targeted sequence, L48 = A1exa647\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAD-1955:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSS#\n\n\n \n\n\nSS#\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nsense\n\n\nSense seq\n\n\nantisense\n\n\nAntisense seq\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA-3372\n\n\ncuuAcGcuGAGuAcuucGAdTsdT\n\n\nA-3374\n\n\nUCGAAGuACUcAGCGuAAGdTsdT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nUptake of Liposomes by KB Cells (FACS):\n\n\n \n \n \nKB cells were incubated with AD-18747 containing liposomes (AD-18747 (active GFP siRNA with Alexa647 on the 3′ of the antisense)).

The total mol % of PEG lipids (i.e., the amount of GalNAc3 lipid and PEG-lipid) is kept constant at 1.5 mol % relative to lipids. The experiments were performed as described in Example 6.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe in vivo results of the dose response study are provided in \nFIG. 30\n. As shown in \nFIG. 30\n, dose dependent reduction of FVII level was observed in ApoE mice administered Lipid A formulations containing 0.15 mol % or 0.5 mol % the GalNAc3 lipid of \nformula\n 3. There was little or no knockdown of FVII by Lipid A formulation without the GalNAc3 lipid of \nformula\n 3 in ApoE knockout mice.\n\n\n \nExample 29\n\n\nEfficacy of Lipid A Formulations containing GalNAc in ApoE Wildtype Mice\n\n\n \n \n \nC57BL6 mice were administered PBS, Lipid A formulation with lipids ratio (in molar %) of 57.5/7.5/30/5 (lipid A/distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC)/cholesterol/PEG-distyryl glycerol (PEG-DSG) lipid) without GalNAc3 lipid of \nformula\n 3, or the same formulation containing 0.15 mol %, 0.5 mol %, or 1.0 mol % GalNAc3 lipid of \nformula\n 3. The total mol % of PEG lipids (i.e., the amount of GalNAc3 lipid and PEG-lipid) is kept constant at 1.5 mol % relative to lipids. Three dose levels (0.1, 0.3, or 1 mg/kg) of FVII siRNA were tested when mice were administered the formulation containing 1.0 mol % GlaNAc3 lipid of \nformula\n 3, and all other mice were tested at a dose of 1 mg/kg siRNA. The experiments were otherwise performed essentially as described in Example 6.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe in vivo results of this study are provided in \nFIG. 31\n. Previously, efficacy of liposomes containing GalNAc lipids could not easily be shown in ApoE wildtype mice, presumably due to predominance of the ApoE-dependent mechanism driving liver uptake. However, by using 5 mol % C18-PEG (PEG-DSG)-containing formulations, FVII knockdown was observed to be reduced. As shown in \nFIG. 31\n, the liver uptake of siRNA was retarded when longer chain (C18) PEG conjugates were used at 5 mol % in the formulation. However, replacement of 0.15 mol % to 1 mol % of the PEG-DSG with the GalNAc3 lipid of formula 3 (also at 0.15 mol % to 1 mol %) in this formulation restored knockdown of FVII in the ApoE wildtype mice, indicating the ability of GalNAc conjugated lipid (e.g., GalNAc3-PEG-lipid) to target the lipid nucleic acid particle to deliver to the liver, further suggesting that other targeting lipids could be used in liposomes containing PEG-DSG to target to other tissues.\n\n\n \nExample 30\n\n\nEfficacy of Lipid A Formulations in Various Tumor Cell Lines\n\n\n \n \n \nCells were seeded in 96 well plates at 15-20×10\n3 \nper well overnight. On the following day, four different liposome formulations of dsRNAs targeting KSP (AD6248) and Luc (AD1955) were prepared. The formulations were as follows: 1) LNP08-containing C14-PEG (PEG-DMG), 2) LNP08— containing C18-PEG (PEG-DSG), 3) LNP09-containing C14-PEG, and 4) LNP09-containing C18-PEG. The dsRNA-liposome formulations were serially diluted from 500 or 600 nM in serum containing media with or without 3 ug/ml of ApoE. Liposome formulations of Luc targeted siRNA were used for normalization. 1 ug/ml ApoE was also tested for half of the cell lines. Incubations were allowed to proceed for 15 to 25 minutes at 37° C. Media were removed from cells and 100 μl of the liposome mixtures +/−ApoE were added to the cells for 24 hour incubation. The next day, 100u1 of lysis mixture/nuclease free H\n2\nO (1:2) and Proteinase K (10u1 per ml) were added to the cells and mixed at 65° C. for about 35 minutes. KSP mRNA levels were determined by Quantigene 1.0 in comparison to the levels of GAPDH.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor knockdown of KSP, siRNA duplex (AD6248) having sense strand sequence: AccGAAGuGuuGuuuGuccTsT (SEQ ID NO:) and antisense strand sequence: GGAcAAAcAAcACUUCGGUTsT (SEQ ID NO:) was used and described, e.g., in U.S. Ser.

Higher amount of vitamin E caused reverse effect.\n\n\n \nExample 32\n\n\nLipid A Shows Dependence on LDLR for Efficacy\n\n\n \n \n \nLNP09 formulations with FVII RNAi were tested in wildtype and LDLR KO mice as shown the table below.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nInj vol\n\n\nDose\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup\n\n\nMice\n\n\nTarget\n\n\nsiRNA\n\n\n(ul)\n\n\n(mg/kg)\n\n\n \nVehicle\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n \nWt\n \n \nNone\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n10\n\n\n \n\n\n \nPBS\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nWt\n\n\nFVII\n\n\nAD-1661\n\n\n10\n\n\n0.100\n\n\nLNP09\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nWt\n\n\nFVII\n\n\nAD-1661\n\n\n10\n\n\n0.030\n\n\nLNP09\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nWt\n\n\nFVII\n\n\nAD-1661\n\n\n10\n\n\n0.010\n\n\nLNP09\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n \nLDLR KO\n \n \nNone\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n10\n\n\n \n\n\nPBS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nLDLR KO\n\n\nFVII\n\n\nAD-1661\n\n\n10\n\n\n0.100\n\n\nLNP09\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nLDLR KO\n\n\nFVII\n\n\nAD-1661\n\n\n10\n\n\n0.030\n\n\nLNP09\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nLDLR KO\n\n\nFVII\n\n\nAD-1661\n\n\n10\n\n\n0.010\n\n\nLNP09\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nLDLR KO\n\n\nFVII\n\n\nAD-1661\n\n\n10\n\n\n0.010\n\n\nLNP09\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs illustrated in \nFIG. 35\n, a decrease in efficacy was observed in the LDLR KO mice when compared to the wildtype mice, consistent with the LDL Receptor being a significant receptor for ApoE.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe formulations were further tested wherein 0.5 mol % of the PEG-DMG was replaced with GALNaC3-PEG-lipid (formula 3). The formulations comprising the GalNac3-PEG-lipids were tested mice (9 groups total, as shown in the table below), and tested for FVII protein level as described above. As shown in \nFIG. 36\n, the formulations were no longer LDLR dependent, as shown by the equivalent potency of the formulation in wildtype and LDLR knockout mice. Thus, the presence of the targeting lipid such as the GalNAc lipid used here appears to alleviate the LDL Receptor dependence of particles comprising Lipid A.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nInj vol\n\n\nDose\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup\n\n\nMice\n\n\nTarget\n\n\nsiRNA\n\n\n(ul)\n\n\n(mg/kg)\n\n\n \nVehicle\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n \nWt\n \n \nNone\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n10\n\n\n \n\n\n \nPBS\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nWt\n\n\nFVII\n\n\nAD-1661\n\n\n10\n\n\n0.100\n\n\nLNP09 + 0.5\n% GalNAc\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nWt\n\n\nFVII\n\n\nAD-1661\n\n\n10\n\n\n0.030\n\n\nLNP09 + 0.5\n% GalNAc\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nWt\n\n\nFVII\n\n\nAD-1661\n\n\n10\n\n\n0.010\n\n\nLNP09 + 0.5\n% GalNAc\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n \nLDLR KO\n \n \nNone\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n10\n\n\n \n\n\nPBS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nLDLR KO\n\n\nFVII\n\n\nAD-1661\n\n\n10\n\n\n0.100\n\n\nLNP09 + 0.5% GalNAc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nLDLR KO\n\n\nFVII\n\n\nAD-1661\n\n\n10\n\n\n0.030\n\n\nLNP09 + 0.5% GalNAc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nLDLR KO\n\n\nFVII\n\n\nAD-1661\n\n\n10\n\n\n0.010\n\n\nLNP09 + 0.5\n% GalNAc\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nLDLR KO\n\n\nFVII\n\n\nAD-1661\n\n\n10\n\n\n0.010\n\n\nLNP09"
