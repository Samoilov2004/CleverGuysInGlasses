Description\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention relates generally to IL-17A specific binding compounds, such as antibodies, and uses thereof. More specifically, chimeric and humanized antibodies that recognize human IL-17A and modulate its activity, particularly in inflammatory, autoimmune and proliferative disorders are disclosed herein.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe immune system functions to protect individuals from infective agents, e.g., bacteria, multi-cellular organisms, and viruses, as well as from cancers. This system includes several types of lymphoid and myeloid cells such as monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), eosinophils, T cells, B cells, and neutrophils. These lymphoid and myeloid cells often produce signaling proteins known as cytokines. The immune response includes inflammation, i.e., the accumulation of immune cells systemically or in a particular location of the body. In response to an infective agent or foreign substance, immune cells secrete cytokines which, in turn, modulate immune cell proliferation, development, differentiation, or migration. Immune response can produce pathological consequences, e.g., when it involves excessive inflammation, as in the autoimmune disorders (see, e.g., \nAbbas et al. (eds.) (2000) Cellular and Molecular Immunology, W.B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA\n; \nOppenheim and Feldmann (eds.) (2001) Cytokine Reference, Academic Press, San Diego, CA\n; \nvon Andrian arid Mackay (2000) New Engl. J. Med. 343:1020-1034\n; \nDavidson and Diamond (2001) New Engl. J. Med. 345:340-350\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInterleukin-17A (IL-17A; also known as Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-associated Antigen 8 (CTLA8), IL-17) is a homodimeric cytokine produced by memory T cells following antigen recognition. The development of such T cells is promoted by interleukin-23 (IL-23). \nMcKenzie et al. (2006) Trends Immunol. 27(1): 17-23\n; \nLangrish et al. (2005) J. Exp. Med. 201(2):233-40\n. IL-17A acts through two receptors, IL-17RA and IL-17RC to induce the production of numerous molecules involved in neutrophil biology, inflammation, and organ destruction. This cytokine synergizes with tissue necrosis factor (TNF) and or interleukin 10 (IL-1β) to promote a greater pro-inflammatory environment. Antagonizing the activity of IL-17A with antibodies or antigen binding fragments of antibodies has been proposed for the treatment of a variety of inflammatory, immune and proliferative disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis osteoporosis, inflammatory fibrosis (e.g. scleroderma, lung fibrosis, and cirrhosis), gingivitis, periodontitis or other inflammatory periodontal diseases, inflammatory bowel disorders (e.g. Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and inflammatory bowel disease), asthma (including allergic asthma), allergies, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), multiple sclerosis, psoriasis and cancer. (See, e.g., \n \nUS 2003/0166862\n \n, \n \nWO 2005/108616\n \n, \n \nWO 2005/051422\n \n. and \n \nWO 2006/013107\n \n).\n \nWO 2004/106377\n \n discloses anti-human IL17 antibodies raised in rats. The antibody described in \n \nWO 2004/106377\n \n has the binding affinity of K\nD\n15.1pM and potently abrogates IL17-induced IL6 production in 3T3 fibroblasts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe most significant limitation in using antibodies as a therapeutic agent \nin vivo\n is the immunogenicity of the antibodies. As most monoclonal antibodies are derived from rodents, repeated use in humans results in the generation of an immune response against the therapeutic antibody, e.g., human against mouse antibodies or HAMA. Such an immune response results in a loss of therapeutic efficacy at a minimum and a potential fatal anaphylactic response at a maximum. Initial efforts to reduce the immunogenicity of rodent antibodies involved the production of chimeric antibodies, in which mouse variable regions (Fv) were fused with human constant regions.\n Liu et al. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84:3439-43\n. However, mice injected with hybrids of human variable regions and mouse constant regions develop a strong anti-antibody response directed against the human variable region, suggesting that the retention of the entire rodent Fv region in such chimeric antibodies may still result in unwanted immunogenicity in patients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is generally believed that complementarity determining region (CDR) loops of variable domains comprise the binding site of antibody molecules. Therefore, the grafting of rodent CDR loops onto human frameworks (i.e., humanization) has been attempted to further minimize rodent sequences. \nJones et al. (1986) Nature 321:522\n; \nVerhoeyen et al. (1988) Science 239: 1534\n. However, CDR loop exchanges still do not uniformly result in an antibody with the same binding properties as the antibody of origin. Changes in framework residues (FR), residues involved in CDR loop support, in humanized antibodies also are often required to preserve antigen binding affinity. \nKabat et al. (1991) J. Immunol. 147:1709\n. While the use of CDR grafting and framework residue preservation in a number of humanized antibody constructs has been reported, it is difficult to predict if a particular sequence will result in the antibody with the desired binding, and sometimes biological, properties. \nSee, e.g.,\n \nQueen et al. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:10029\n, \nGorman et al. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:4181\n, and \nHodgson (1991) Biotechnology (NY) 9:421-5\n. Moreover, most prior studies .used different human sequences for animal light and heavy variable sequences, rendering the predictive nature of such studies questionable. Sequences of known antibodies have been used or, more typically, those of antibodies having known X-ray crystal structures, such as antibodies NEW and KOL. \nSee, e.g.,\n Jones et al., \nsupra;\n Verhoeyen et al., \nsupra;\n and Gorman et al., \nsupra.\n Exact sequence information has been reported for a few humanized constructs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe need exists for antagonists of IL-17A, such as anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibodies, for use in treatment of human disorders, such as inflammatory, autoimmune, and proliferative disorders. Such antagonists will preferably exhibit low immunogenicity in human subjects, allowing for repeated administration without adverse immune responses.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention relates to anti-human IL-17A antibodies having one or more desirable properties, including high binding affinities, neutralizing activities, good pharmacokinetics and low antigenicity in human subjects.

While an embodiment of the present invention (e.g., a treatment method or article of manufacture) may not be effective in alleviating the target disease symptom(s) in every patient, it should alleviate the target disease symptom(s) in a statistically significant number of patients as determined by any statistical test known in the art such as the Student's t-test, the chi\n2\n-test, the U-test according to Mann and Whitney, the Kruskal-Wallis test (H-test), Jonckheere-Terpstra-test and the Wilcoxon-test.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFour variants of human IL-17A protein are referred to herein. i) As used herein, the terms \"human IL-17A\" and \"native human IL-17A\"(\"huIL-17A\" and \"humIL-17A\") refer to the mature forms (i.e. residues 24-155) of human IL-17A protein accession numbers NP_002181 and AAT22064, and naturally occurring variants and polymorphisms thereof. ii) As used herein, the term \"rhIL-17A\" refers to a recombinant derivative of native human IL-17A in which two additional amino acids (LE) are appended at the N-terminus of the mature form of native human IL-17A. This nomenclature is adopted for convenience in referring to various forms of IL-17A, and may not match usage in the literature. iii) As used herein, the term \"FLAG-huIL-17A\" refers to a variant of native human IL-17A having an N-terminal FLAG\n®\n peptide tag appended. In some experiments the FLAG-huIL-17A is biotinylated. iv) R&D Systems human IL-17A referred to herein is residues 20-155 of human IL-17A protein accession numbers NP_002181 and AAT22064, with an additional N-terminal methionine. Table 1 is a summary of the variant N-termini of the IL-17A molecules referenced herein.\n\n \nTABLE 1\n \n \n \nVariant Forms of Human IL-17A\n \n \n \nIL-17A Variant\n \nSequence (N→C)\n \nSEQ ID NO.:\n \n \n \n \nhuIL-17A (native)\n \nGITIPRN . . . \nVHHVA\n \n \n40\n \n \n \nrhIL-17A\n \n \nLE\nGITIPRN . . .

VHHVA\n \n43\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnless otherwise noted, any IL-17A used in the experiments described herein that is produced using adenoviral vectors is rhIL-17A. The term \"IL-17A\" refers to generally to human IL-17A, native or recombinant, and non-human homologs of human IL-17A. Unless otherwise indicated, molar concentrations of IL-17A are calculated using the molecular weight of a homodimer of IL-17A (e.g., 30 kDa for human IL-17A).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"antibody\" refers to any form of antibody that exhibits the desired biological activity. Thus, it is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers, but is not limited to, monoclonal antibodies (including full length monoclonal antibodies), polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies). As used herein, the terms \"IL-17A binding fragment or \"binding fragment\" of an antibody (the \"parental antibody\") encompass a fragment or a derivative of an antibody, typically including at least a portion of the antigen binding or variable regions (e.g. one or more CDRs) of the parental antibody, that retains at least some of the binding specificity of the parental antibody. Examples of antibody binding fragments include, but are not limited to, Fab, Fab', F(ab')\n2\n, and Fv fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies; single-chain antibody molecules, e.g., sc-Fv; and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. Typically, a binding fragment or derivative retains at least 10% of its IL-17A binding activity when that activity is expressed on a molar basis. Preferably, a binding fragment or derivative retains at least 20%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% or 100% or more of the IL-17A binding affinity as the parental antibody. It is also intended that an IL-17A binding fragment can include conservative amino acid substitutions (referred to as \"conservative variants\" of the antibody) that do not substantially alter its biologic activity. The term \"binding compound\" refers to both antibodies and binding fragments thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA \"Fab fragment\" is comprised of one light chain and the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 and variable regions of one heavy chain. The heavy chain of a Fab molecule cannot form a disulfide bond with another heavy chain molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn \"Fc\" region contains two heavy chain fragments comprising the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 and \nC\n \n \n \nH\n2 domains of an antibody. The two heavy chain fragments are held together by two or more disulfide bonds and by hydrophobic interactions of the CH3 domains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA \"Fab' fragment\" contains one light chain and a portion of one heavy chain that contains the V\nH\n domain and the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 domain and also the region between the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 and \nC\n \n \n \nH\n2 domains, such that an interchain disulfide bond can be formed between the two heavy chains of two Fab' fragments to form a F(ab')\n2\n molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA \"F(ab')\n2\n fragment\" contains two light chains and two heavy chains containing a portion of the constant region between the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 and C\nH\n \n2\n domains, such that an interchain disulfide bond is formed between the two heavy chains. A F(ab')\n2\n fragment thus is composed of two Fab' fragments that are held together by a disulfide bond between the two heavy chains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe \"Fv region\" comprises the variable regions from both the heavy and light chains, but lacks the constant regions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"single-chain Fv\" or \"scFv\" antibody refers to antibody fragments comprising the V\nH\n and V\nL\n domains of an antibody, wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. Generally, the Fv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the V\nH\n and V\nL\n domains which enables the scFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of scFv, see \nPluckthun (1994) THE PHARMACOLOGY OF MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES, vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds. Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315\n. See also, International Patent Application Publication No. \n \nWO 88/01649\n \n and \n \nU.S. Pat. Nos. 4,946, 778\n \n and \n \n5,260,203\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA \"domain antibody\" is an immunologically functional immunoglobulin fragment containing only the variable region of a heavy chain or the variable region of a light chain. In some instances, two or more V\nH\n regions are covalently joined with a peptide linker to create a bivalent domain antibody. The two V\nH\n regions of a bivalent domain antibody may target the same or different antigens.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA \"bivalent antibody\" comprises two antigen binding sites. In some instances, the two binding sites have the same antigen specificities. However, bivalent antibodies may be bispecific (see below).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, unless otherwise indicated, an \"anti-IL-17A\" antibody refers to an antibody that is raised against human IL-17A or a variant thereof, such as huIL-17A, rhIL-17A, FLAG-huIL-17A and R&D IL-17A, or any antigenic fragment thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"monoclonal antibody\", as used herein, refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, \ni.e\n., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic epitope. In contrast, conventional (polyclonal) antibody preparations typically include a multitude of antibodies directed against (or specific for) different epitopes. The modifier \"monoclonal\" indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by the hybridoma method first described by \nKohler et al. (1975) Nature 256: 495\n, or may be made by recombinant DNA methods \n(see, e.g.,\n \n \nU.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567\n \n). The \"monoclonal antibodies\" may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in \nClackson et al. (1991) Nature 352: 624-628\n and \nMarks et al. (1991) J. Mol. Biol. 222: 581-597\n, for example. \nSee also\n \nPresta (2005) J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 116:731\n \n.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include \"chimeric\" antibodies (immunoglobulins) in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (\n \nU.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567\n \n; and \nMorrison et al., (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81: 6851-6855\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, a \"chimeric antibody\" is an antibody having the variable domain from a first antibody and constant domain from a second antibody, where the first and second antibodies are from different species. Typically the variable domains are obtained from an antibody from an experimental animal (the \"parental antibody\"), such as a rodent, and the constant domain sequences are obtained from human antibodies, so that the resulting chimeric antibody will be less likely to elicit an adverse immune response in a human subject than the parental rodent antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe monoclonal antibodies herein also include camelized single domain antibodies. \nSee, e.g.,\n \nMuyldermans et al. (2001) Trends Biochem. Sci. 26:230\n; \nReichmann et al. (1999) J. Immunol. Methods 231:25\n; \n \nWO 94/04678\n \n; \n \nWO94/25591\n \n; \n \nU.S. Pat. No. 6,005,079\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSingle domain antibodies comprising two V\nH\n domains with modifications such that single domain antibodies are formed are also described-herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"diabodies\" refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites, which fragments comprise a heavy chain variable domain (V\nH\n) connected to a light chain variable domain (V\nL\n) in the same polypeptide chain (V\nH\n-V\nL\n or V\nL\n-V\nH\n). By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain, the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen-binding sites. Diabodies are described more fully in, e.g., \n \nEP 404,097\n \n; \n \nWO 93/11161\n \n; and \nHolliger et al. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90: 6444-6448\n. For a review of engineered antibody variants generally see \nHolliger and Hudson (2005) Nat. Biotechnol. 23:1126-1136\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"humanized antibody\" refers to forms of antibodies that contain sequences from both human and non-human (e.g., murine, rat) antibodies. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin, and all or substantially all of the framework (FR) regions are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody may optionally comprise at least a portion of a human immunoglobulin constant region (Fc).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies described herein also include antibodies with modified (or blocked) Fc regions to provide altered effector functions. See, e.g., \n \nU.S. Pat. No. 5,624,821\n \n; \n \nWO2003/086310\n \n; \n \nWO2005/120571\n \n; \n \nWO2006/0057702\n \n. Such modification can be used to enhance or suppress various reactions of the immune system, with possible beneficial effects in diagnosis and therapy. Alterations of the Fc region include amino acid changes (substitutions, deletions and insertions), glycosylation or deglycosylation, and adding multiple Fc. Changes to the Fc can also alter the half-life of antibodies in therapeutic antibodies, enabling less frequent dosing and thus increased convenience and decreased use of material. \nSee\n \nPresta (2005) J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 116:731 at 734-35\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"fully human antibody\" refers to an antibody that comprises human immunoglobulin protein sequences only. A fully human antibody may contain murine carbohydrate chains if produced in a mouse, in a mouse cell, or in a hybridoma derived from a mouse cell. Similarly, \"mouse antibody\" refers to an antibody that comprises mouse immunoglobulin sequences only. Alternatively, a fully human antibody may contain rat carbohydrate chains if produced in a rat, in a rat cell, or in a hybridoma derived from a rat cell. Similarly, \"rat antibody\" refers to an antibody that comprises rat immunoglobulin sequences only.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"hypervariable region\" refers to the amino acid residues of an antibody which are responsible for antigen-binding. The hypervariable region comprises amino acid residues from a \"complementarity determining region\" or \"CDR\" (i.e. residues 24-34 (CDRL1). 50-56 (CDRL2) and 89-97 (CDRL3) in the light chain variable domain and residues 31-35 (CDRH1), 50-65 (CDRH2) and 95-102 (CDRH3) in the heavy chain variable domain; \nKabat et al. (1991) Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md\n.) and/or those residues from a \"hypervariable loop\" (i.e. residues 26-32 (CDRL1), 50-52 (CDRL2) and 91-96 (CDRL3) in the light chain variable domain and 26-32 (CDRH1), 53-55 (CDRH2) and 96-101 (CDRH3) in the heavy chain variable domain; \nChothia and Lesk (1987) J. Mol. Biol. 196: 901-917\n). As used herein, the term \"framework\" or \"FR\" residues refers to those variable domain residues other than the hypervariable region residues defined herein as CDR residues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Binding substance\" refers to a molecule, small molecule, macromolecule, antibody, a fragment or analogue thereof, or soluble receptor, capable of binding to a target. \"Binding substance\" also may refer to a complex of molecules, e.g., a non-covalent complex, to an ionized molecule, and to a covalently or non-covalently modified molecule, e.g., modified by phosphorylation, acylation, cross-linking, cyclization, or limited cleavage, that is capable of binding to a target. \"Binding substance\" may also refer to a molecule capable of binding to a target in combination with a stabilizer, excipient, salt, buffer, solvent, or additive. \"Binding\" may be defined as an association of the binding substance with a target where the association results in reduction in the normal Brownian motion of the binding substance, in cases where the binding substance can be dissolved or suspended in solution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Conservatively modified variants\" or \"conservative substitution\" refers to substitutions of amino acids in a protein with other amino acids having similar characteristics (e.g. charge, side-chain size, hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity, backbone conformation and rigidity, etc.), such that the changes can frequently be made without altering the biological activity of the protein. Those of skill in this art recognize that, in general, single amino acid substitutions in non-essential regions of a polypeptide do not substantially alter biological activity \n(see, e.g.,\n \nWatson et al. (1987) Molecular Biology of the Gene, The Benjamin/Cummings Pub. Co., p. 224 (4th Ed\n.)). In addition, substitutions of structurally or functionally similar amino acids are less likely to disrupt biological activity. Various embodiments of the binding compounds of the present invention comprise polypeptide chains with sequences that include up to 0 (no changes), 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 20 or more conservative amino acid substitutions when compared with the specific amino acid sequences disclosed herein, e.g. SEQ ID NOs: 2, 4, 5, or 6. As used herein, the phrase \"up to X\" conservative amino acid substitutions includes 0 substitutions and any number of substitutions up to and including X substitutions. Such exemplary substitutions are preferably made in accordance with those set forth in Table 2 as follows:\n\n \nTABLE 2\n \n \n \nExemplary Conservative Amino Acid Substitutions\n \n \n \nOriginal residue\n \nConservative substitution\n \n \n \n \nAla (A)\n \nGly; Ser\n \n \n \nArg (R)\n \nLys; His\n \n \n \nAsn (N)\n \nGln; His\n \n \n \nAsp (D)\n \nGlu; Asn\n \n \n \nCys (C)\n \nSer; Ala\n \n \n \nGln (Q)\n \nAsn\n \n \n \nGlu (E)\n \nAsp; Gln\n \n \n \nGly (G)\n \nAla\n \n \n \nHis (H)\n \nAsn; Gln\n \n \n \nIle (I)\n \nLeu; Val\n \n \n \nLeu (L)\n \nIle; Val\n \n \n \nLys (K)\n \nArg; His\n \n \n \nMet (M)\n \nLeu; Ile; Tyr\n \n \n \nPhe (F)\n \nTyr; Met; Leu\n \n \n \nPro (P)\n \nAla\n \n \n \nSer (S)\n \nThr\n \n \n \nThr (T)\n \nSer\n \n \n \nTrp (W)\n \nTyr; Phe\n \n \n \nTyr (Y)\n \nTrp; Phe\n \n \n \nVal (V)\n \nIle; Leu\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms \"consists essentially of,\" or variations such as \"consist essentially of\" or \"consisting essentially of,\" as used herein indicate the inclusion of any recited elements or group of elements, and the optional inclusion of other elements, of similar or different nature than the recited elements, which do not materially change the basic or novel properties of the specified dosage regimen, method, or composition. As a nonlimiting example, a binding compound which consists essentially of a recited amino acid sequence may also include one or more amino acids that do not materially affect the properties of the binding compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Effective amount\" encompasses an amount sufficient to ameliorate or prevent a symptom or sign of the medical condition. Effective amount also means an amount sufficient to allow or facilitate diagnosis. An effective amount for a particular patient or veterinary subject may vary depending on factors such as the condition being treated, the overall health of the patient, the method route and dose of administration and the severity of side affects (see, e.g., \n \nU.S. Pat. No. 5,888,530 issued to Netti, et al\n \n.). An effective amount can be the maximal dose or dosing protocol that avoids significant side effects or toxic effects. The effect will result in an improvement of a diagnostic measure or parameter by at least 5%, usually by at least 10%, more usually at least 20%, most usually at least 30%, preferably at least 40%, more preferably at least 50%, most preferably at least 60%, ideally at least 70%, more ideally at least 80%, and most ideally at least 90%, where 100% is defined as the diagnostic parameter shown by a normal subject (see, e.g., \nMaynard, et al. (1996) A Handbook of SOPs for Good Clinical Practice, Interpharm Press, Boca Raton, FL\n; \nDent (2001) Good Laboratory and Good Clinical Practice, Urch Publ., London, UK\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Exogenous\" refers to substances that are produced outside an organism, cell, or human body, depending on the context. \"Endogenous\" refers to substances that are produced within a cell, organism, or human body, depending on the context.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Homology\" refers to sequence similarity between two polynucleotide sequences or between two polypeptide sequences. When a position in both of the two compared sequences is occupied by the same base or amino acid monomer subunit, e.g., if a position in each of two DNA molecules is occupied by adenine, then the molecules are homologous at that position. The percent of homology between two sequences is a function of the number of matching or homologous positions shared by the two sequences divided by the number of positions compared × 100. For example, if 6 of 10 of the positions in two sequences are matched or homologous when the sequences are optimally aligned then the two sequences are 60% homologous. Generally, the comparison is made when two sequences are aligned to give maximum percent homology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Immune condition\" or \"immune disorder\" encompasses, e.g., pathological inflammation, an inflammatory disorder, and an autoimmune disorder or disease. \"Immune condition\" also refers to infections, persistent infections, and proliferative conditions, such as cancer, tumors, and angiogenesis, including infections, tumors, and cancers that resist eradication by the immune system. \"Cancerous condition\" includes, e.g., cancer, cancer cells, tumors, angiogenesis, and precancerous conditions such as dysplasia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Inflammatory disorder\" means a disorder or pathological condition where the pathology results, in whole or in part, from, e.g., a change in number, change in rate of migration, or change in activation, of cells of the immune system. Cells of the immune system include, e.g., T cells, B cells, monocytes or macrophages, antigen presenting cells (APCs), dendritic cells, microglia, NK cells, NKT cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, mast cells, or any other cell specifically associated with the immunology, for example, cytokine-producing endothelial or epithelial cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Isolated binding compound\" refers to the purification status of a binding compound and in such context means the molecule is substantially free of other biological molecules such as nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, or other material such as cellular debris and growth media. Generally, the term \"isolated\" is not intended to refer to a complete absence of such material or to an absence of water, buffers, or salts, unless they are present in amounts that substantially interfere with experimental or therapeutic use of the binding compound as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Isolated nucleic acid molecule\" means a DNA or RNA of genomic, mRNA, cDNA, or synthetic origin or some combination thereof which is not associated with all or a portion of a polynucleotide in which the isolated polynucleotide is found in nature, or is linked to a polynucleotide to which it is not linked in nature. For purposes of this disclosure, it should be understood that \"a nucleic acid molecule comprising\" a particular nucleotide sequence does not encompass intact chromosomes. Isolated nucleic acid molecules \"comprising\" specified nucleic acid sequences may include, in addition to the specified sequences, coding sequences for up to ten or even up to twenty or more other proteins or portions thereof, or may include operably linked regulatory sequences that control expression of the coding region of the recited nucleic acid sequences, and/or may include vector sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase \"control sequences\" refers to DNA sequences necessary for the expression of an operably linked coding sequence in a particular host organism. The control sequences that are suitable for prokaryotes, for example, include a promoter, optionally an operator sequence, and a ribosome binding site. Eukaryotic cells are known to use promoters, polyadenylation signals, and enhancers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA nucleic acid is \"operably linked\" when it is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For example, DNA for a presequence or secretory leader is operably linked to DNA for a polypeptide if it is expressed as a preprotein that participates in the secretion of the polypeptide; a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the sequence; or a ribosome binding site is operably linked to a coding sequence if it is positioned so as to facilitate translation. Generally, \"operably linked\" means that the DNA sequences being linked are contiguous, and, in the case of a secretory leader, contiguous and in reading phase. However, enhancers do not have to be contiguous. Linking is accomplished by ligation at convenient restriction sites. If such sites do not exist, the synthetic oligonucleotide adaptors or linkers are used in accordance with conventional practice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the expressions \"cell,\" \"cell line,\" and \"cell culture\" are used interchangeably and all such designations include progeny. Thus, the words \"transformants\" and \"transformed cells\" include the primary subject cell and cultures derived therefrom without regard for the number of transfers. It is also understood that all progeny may not be precisely identical in DNA content, due to deliberate or inadvertent mutations. Mutant progeny that have the same function or biological activity as screened for in the originally transformed cell are included. Where distinct designations are intended, it will be clear from the context.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, \"polymerase chain reaction\" or \"PCR\" refers to a procedure or technique in which minute amounts of a specific piece of nucleic acid, RNA and/or DNA, are amplified as described in, e.g., \n \nU.S. Pat. No. 4,683,195\n \n. Generally, sequence information from the ends of the region of interest or beyond needs to be available, such that oligonucleotide primers can be designed; these primers will be identical or similar in sequence to opposite strands of the template to be amplified. The 5' terminal nucleotides of the two primers can coincide with the ends of the amplified material. PCR can be used to amplify specific RNA sequences, specific DNA sequences from total genomic DNA, and cDNA transcribed from total cellular RNA, bacteriophage or plasmid sequences, etc. \nSee generally\n \nMullis et al. (1987) Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 51:263\n; \nErlich, ed., (1989) PCR TECHNOLOGY (Stockton Press, N.Y\n.) As used herein, PCR is considered to be one, but not the only, example of a nucleic acid polymerase reaction method for amplifying a nucleic acid test sample comprising the use of a known nucleic acid as a primer and a nucleic acid polymerase to amplify or generate a specific piece of nucleic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"germline sequence\" refers to a sequence of unrearranged immunoglobulin DNA sequences. Any suitable source of unrearranged immunoglobulin may be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Inhibitors\" and \"antagonists,\" or \"activators\" and \"agonists,\" refer to inhibitory or activating molecules, respectively, e.g., for the activation of, e.g., a ligand, receptor, cofactor, a gene, cell, tissue, or organ. A modulator of, e.g., a gene, a receptor, a ligand, or a cell, is a molecule that alters an activity of the gene, receptor, ligand, or cell, where activity can be activated, inhibited, or altered in its regulatory properties. The modulator may act alone, or it may use a cofactor, e.g., a protein, metal ion, or small molecule. Inhibitors are compounds that decrease, block, prevent, delay activation, inactivate, desensitize, or down regulate, e.g., a gene, protein, ligand, receptor, or cell. Activators are compounds that increase, activate, facilitate, enhance activation, sensitize, or up regulate, e.g., a gene, protein, ligand, receptor, or cell. An inhibitor may also be defined as a compound that reduces, blocks, or inactivates a constitutive activity. An \"agonist\" is a compound that interacts with a target to cause or promote an increase in the activation of the target. An \"antagonist\" is a compound that opposes the actions of an agonist. An antagonist prevents, reduces, inhibits, or neutralizes the activity of an agonist. An antagonist can also prevent, inhibit, or reduce constitutive activity of a target, e.g., a target receptor, even where there is no identified agonist.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo examine the extent of inhibition, for example, samples or assays comprising a given, e.g., protein, gene, cell, or organism, are treated with a potential activator or inhibitor and are compared to control samples without the inhibitor. Control samples, i.e., samples not treated with antagonist, are assigned a relative activity value of 100%. Inhibition is achieved when the activity value relative to the control is about 90% or less, typically 85% or less, more typically 80% or less, most typically 75% or less, generally 70% or less, more generally 65% or less, most generally 60% or less, typically 55% or less, usually 50% or less, more usually 45% or less, most usually 40% or less, preferably 35% or less, more preferably 30% or less, still more preferably 25% or less, and most preferably less than 25%. Activation is achieved when the activity value relative to the control is about 110%, generally at least 120%, more generally at least 140%, more generally at least 160%, often at least 180%, more often at least 2-fold, most often at least 2.5-fold, usually at least 5-fold, more usually at least 10-fold, preferably at least 20-fold, more preferably at least 40-fold, and most preferably over 40-fold higher.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEndpoints in activation or inhibition can be monitored as follows. Activation, inhibition, and response to treatment, e.g., of a cell, physiological fluid, tissue, organ, and animal or human subject, can be monitored by an endpoint. The endpoint may comprise a predetermined quantity or percentage of, e.g., indicia of inflammation, oncogenicity, or cell degranulation or secretion, such as the release of a cytokine, toxic oxygen, or a protease. The endpoint may comprise, e.g., a predetermined quantity of ion flux or transport; cell migration; cell adhesion; cell proliferation; potential for metastasis; cell differentiation; and change in phenotype, e.g., change in expression of gene relating to inflammation, apoptosis, transformation, cell cycle, or metastasis (see, e.g., \nKnight (2000) Ann. Clin. Lab. Sci. 30:145-158\n; \nHood and Cheresh (2002) Nature Rev. Cancer 2:91-100\n; \nTimme, et al. (2003) Curr. Drug Targets 4:251-261\n; \nRobbins and Itzkowitz (2002) Med. Clin. North Am. 86:1467-1495\n; \nGrady and Markowitz (2002) Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 3:101-128\n; \nBauer, et al. (2001) Glia 36:235-243\n; \nStanimirovic and Satoh (2000) Brain Pathol. 10:113-126\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn endpoint of inhibition is generally 75% of the control or less, preferably 50% of the control or less, more preferably 25% of the control or less, and most preferably 10% of the control or less. Generally, an endpoint of activation is at least 150% the control, preferably at least two times the control, more preferably at least four times the control, and most preferably at least ten times the control.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Ligand\" refers, e.g., to a small molecule, peptide, polypeptide, and membrane associated or membrane-bound molecule, or complex thereof, that can act as an agonist or antagonist of a receptor. \"Ligand\" also encompasses an agent that is not an agonist or antagonist, but that can bind to the receptor. Moreover, \"ligand\" includes a membrane-bound ligand that has been changed, e.g., by chemical or recombinant methods, to a soluble version of the membrane-bound ligand. By convention, where a ligand is membrane-bound on a first cell, the receptor usually occurs on a second cell. The second cell may have the same or a different identity as the first cell. A ligand or receptor may be entirely intracellular, that is, it may reside in the cytosol, nucleus, or some other intracellular compartment. The ligand or receptor may change its location, e.g., from an intracellular compartment to the outer face of the plasma membrane. The complex of a ligand and receptor is termed a \"ligand receptor complex.\" Where a ligand and receptor are involved in a signaling pathway, the ligand occurs at an upstream position and the receptor occurs at a downstream position of the signaling pathway.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Small molecule\" is defined as a molecule with a molecular weight that is less than 10 kDa, typically less than 2 kDa, preferably less than 1 kDa, and most preferably less than about 500 Da. Small molecules include, but are not limited to, inorganic molecules, organic molecules, organic molecules containing an inorganic component, molecules comprising a radioactive atom, synthetic molecules, peptide mimetics, and antibody mimetics. As a therapeutic, a small molecule may be more permeable to cells, less susceptible to degradation, and less apt to clicit an immune response than large molecules. Small molecules, such as peptide mimetics of antibodies and cytokines, as well as small molecule toxins, have been described (see, e.g., \nCasset, et al. (2003) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 307:198-205\n; \nMuyldermans (2001) J. Biotechnol. 74:277-302\n;\n Li (2000) Nat. Biotechnol. 18:1251-1256\n; \nApostolopoulos, et al. (2002) Curr. Med. Chem. 9:411-420\n; \nMonfardini, et al. (2002) Curr. Pharm. Des. 8:2185-2199\n; \nDomingues, et al. (1999) Nat. Struct. Biol. 6:652-656\n; \nSato and Sone (2003) Biochem. J. 371:603-608\n; \n \nU.S. Patent No. 6,326,482 issued to Stewart, et al\n \n \n).\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Specifically\" or \"selectively\" binds, when referring to a ligand/receptor, antibody/antigen, or other binding pair, indicates a binding reaction that is determinative of the presence of the protein in a heterogeneous population of proteins and other biologics. Thus, under designated conditions, a specified ligand binds to a particular receptor and does not bind in a significant amount to other proteins present in the sample. The antibody, or binding compound derived from the antigen-binding site of an antibody, of the contemplated method binds to its antigen, or a variant or mutein thereof, with an affinity that is at least two fold greater, preferably at least ten times greater, more preferably at least 20-times greater, and most preferably at least 100-times greater than the affinity with any other antigen. The antibody described herein will have an affinity that is greater than about 10\n9\n M\n-1\n, as determined, e.g., by Scatchard analysis (\nMunsen et al. (1980) Analyt. Biochem. 107:220-239\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"immunomodulatory agent\" refers to natural or synthetic agents that suppress or modulate an immune response. The immune response can be a humoral or cellular response. Immunomodulatory agents encompass immunosuppressive or anti-inflammatory agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Immunosuppressive agents\", \"immunosuppressive drugs\", or \"immunosuppressants\" as used herein are therapeutics that are used in immunosuppressive therapy to inhibit or prevent activity of the immune system. Clinically they are used to prevent the rejection of transplanted organs and tissues (e.g. bone marrow, heart, kidney, liver), and/or in the treatment of autoimmune diseases or diseases that are most likely of autoimmune origin (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, myasthenia gravis, systemic lupus erythematosus, ulcerative colitis, multiple sclerosis). Immunosuppressive drugs can be classified as: glucocorticoids; cytostatics; antibodies (biological response modifiers); drugs acting on immunophilins; other drugs, including known chemotherpeutic agents used in the treatment of proliferative disorders. For multiple sclerosis, in particular, the antibodies of the present invention can be administered in conjunction with a new class of myelin binding protein-like therapeutics, known as copaxones.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Anti-inflammatory agents\" or \"anti-inflammatory drugs\" refer to both steroidal and non-steroidal therapeutics. Steroids, also known as corticosteroids, are drugs that closely resemble cortisol, a hormone produced naturally by adrenal glands. Steroids are used as the main treatment for certain inflammatory conditions, such as: systemic vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels); and myositis (inflammation of muscle). Steroids might also be used selectively to treat inflammatory conditions such as: rheumatoid arthritis (chronic inflammatory arthritis occurring in joints on both sides of the body); systemic lupus erythematosus (a generalized disease caused by abnormal immune system function); Sjögren's syndrome (chronic disorder that causes dry eyes and a dry mouth).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, usually abbreviated to NSAIDs, are drugs with analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effects - they reduce pain, fever and inflammation. The term \"non-steroidal\" is used to distinguish these drugs from steroids, which (amongst a broad range of other effects) have a similar eicosanoid-depressing, anti-inflammatory action. NSAIDs are generally indicated for the symptomatic relief of the following conditions: rheumatoid arthritis; osteoarthritis; inflammatory arthropathies (e.g. ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, Reiter's syndrome); acute gout; dysmenorrhoea; metastatic bone pain; headache and migraine; postoperative pain; mild-to-moderate pain due to inflammation and tissue injury; pyrexia;and renal colic. NSAIDs include salicylates, arlyalknoic acids, 2-arylpropionic acids (profens), N-arylanthranilic acids (fenamic acids), oxicams, coxibs, and sulphonanilides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDisease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) may be administered, often in combination with NSAIDs. Commonly prescribed DMARDs include hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, methotrexate, gold therapy, sulfasalazine, and azathioprine.\n\n\n \nII. Antibodies Specific for Human IL-17A\n\n\n \n \n \nEngineered anti-IL-17A antibodies and uses thereof to treat various inflammatory, immune and proliferative disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis osteoporosis, inflammatory fibrosis (e.g., scleroderma, lung fibrosis, and cirrhosis), inflammatory bowel disorders (e.g., Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and inflammatory bowel disease), asthma (including allergic asthma), allergies, COPD, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis and cancer are described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny suitable method for generating monoclonal antibodies may be used to generate the anti-IL-17A antibodies described herein. For example, a recipient animal may be immunized with a linked or unlinked (e.g. naturally occurring) form of the IL-17A homodimer, or a fragment thereof. Any suitable method of immunization can be used. Such methods can include adjuvants, other immunostimulants, repeated booster immunizations, and the use of one or more immunization routes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny suitable form of IL-17A can be used as the immunogen (antigen) for the generation of the non-human antibody specific for IL-17A, which antibody can be screened for biological activity. The eliciting immunogen may be full-length mature human IL-17A, including linked and naturally occurring homodimers, or peptides thereof encompassing single epitopes or multiple epitopes. The immunogen may be used alone or in combination with one or more immunogenicity enhancing agents known in the art. The immunogen may be purified from a natural source or produced in a genetically modified cell. DNA encoding the immunogen may be genomic or non-genomic (\ne.g\n., cDNA) in origin. Immunogen-encoding DNA may be expressed using suitable genetic vectors, including but not limited to adenoviral vectors, adenoassociated viral vectors, baculoviral vectors, plasmids, and non-viral vectors, such as cationic lipids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny suitable method can be used to elicit an antibody response with the desired biologic properties, e.g. to inhibit IL-17A binding to its receptor. Antibodies as described herein are raised in mammalian hosts such as mice, rodents, primates, humans, etc. Techniques for preparing monoclonal antibodies may be found in, \ne.g\n., \nStites et al. (eds.) BASIC AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY (4th ed.) Lange Medical Publications, Los Altos, CA\n, and references cited therein; \nHarlow and Lane (1988) ANTIBODIES: A LABORATORY MANUAL CSH Press\n; \nGoding (1986) MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES: PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE (2d ed.) Academic Press, New York, NY\n. Thus, monoclonal antibodies may be obtained by a variety of techniques familiar to researchers skilled in the art. Typically, spleen cells from an animal immunized with a desired antigen are immortalized, commonly by fusion with a myeloma cell. \nSee\n \nKohler and Milstein (1976) Eur. J. Immunol. 6:511-519\n. Alternative methods of immortalization include transformation with Epstein Barr Virus, oncogenes, or retroviruses, or other methods known in the art. \nSee, e.g.,\n \nDoyle et al. (eds.) (1994 and periodic supplements) CELL AND TISSUE CULTURE: LABORATORY PROCEDURES, John Wiley and Sons, New York, NY\n. Colonies arising from single immortalized cells are screened for production of antibodies of the desired specificity and affinity for the antigen. The yield of monoclonal antibodies produced by such cells may be enhanced by various techniques, including injection into the peritoneal cavity of a vertebrate host.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther suitable techniques involve selection of libraries of antibodies in phage or similar vectors. \nSee, e.g.,\n \nHuse et al., Science 246:1275-1281 (1989\n); and \nWard et al., Nature 341:544-546 (1989\n). The antibodies described herein may be used without modification, e.g. as the parental rodent antibody, or with modifications to facilitate their use as therapeutic agents in human subjects, such as chimeric or humanized antibodies. In some embodiments, the antibodies will be labeled, covalently or non-covalently, with a substance that provides a detectable signal. A wide variety of labels and conjugation techniques are known and are reported extensively in both the scientific and patent literature. Suitable labels include radionuclides, enzymes, substrates, cofactors, inhibitors, fluorescent moieties, chemiluminescent moieties, magnetic particles, and the like. Patents teaching the use of such labels include \n \nU.S. Patent Nos. 3,817,837\n \n; \n \n3,850,752\n \n; \n \n3,939,350\n \n; \n \n3,996,345\n \n; \n \n4,277,437\n \n; \n \n4,275,149\n \n; and \n \n4,366,241\n \n. Also, recombinant immunoglobulins may be produced, \nsee\n Cabilly \n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,816,567\n \n; and \nQueen et al. (1989) Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 86:10029-10033\n; or made in transgenic mice, see \nMendez et al. (1997) Nature Genetics 15:146-156\n; also see Abgenix and Medarex technologies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies against predetermined fragments of IL-17A can be raised by immunization of animals with conjugates of the predetermined fragment of IL-17A with carrier proteins. Monoclonal antibodies are prepared from cells secreting the desired antibody. These antibodies can be screened for binding to normal or defective IL-17A. These monoclonal antibodies will usually bind with at least a K\nd\n of about 1 µM, more usually at least about 300, 30, 10, or 3 nM, preferably at least about 300, 100, 30, 10, 3, or 1 pM. Because of the inverse relationship of K\nd\n values and affinity, references to binding with a given K\nd\n \"or less\" refers to binding with an affinity that is \nat least as high\n as the recited numerical value, i.e. with a K\nd\n that is \nat least as low\n as the cited value. Binding affinities may be determined by ELISA (see Examples 5-6, \ninfra\n)\n,\n or by Biacore\n®\n surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, KinExA or ECL methods (see Example 7, \ninfra).\n Suitable non-human antibodies may also be identified using the biological assays described in Examples 8-11 and 16-17, \ninfra.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn exemplary method of producing anti-human IL-17A antibodies described herein is described at Example 2.\n\n\n \nIII. Humanization of IL-17A Specific Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nAny suitable non-human antibody can be used as a source for the hypervariable region of an anti-IL-17A antibody described herein. Sources for non-human antibodies include, but are not limited to, rodents (e.g. mouse, rat), Lagomorphs (including rabbits), cows, and nonhuman primates. For the most part, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which hypervariable region residues of the recipient are replaced by hypervariable region residues from a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity and affinity. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody, such as modifications made to further refine antibody performance of the desired biological activity. For further details, see \nJones et al. (1986) Nature 321: 522-525\n; \nReichmann et al. (1988) Nature 332: 323-329\n; and \nPresta (1992) Curr. Op. Struct. Biol. 2: 593-596\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for recombinantly engineering and producing antibodies have been described, \ne.g.,\n by \n \nBoss et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,397\n \n), \n \nCabilly et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567\n \n), Law et al. (European Patent Application Publication No. \n \n438 310\n \n) and Winter (European Patent Application Publication No. \n \n239 400\n \n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmino acid sequence variants of humanized anti-IL-17A antibodies described herein may be prepared by introducing appropriate nucleotide changes into the humanized anti-IL-17A antibody DNA, or by peptide synthesis. Any combination of deletion, insertion, and substitution may be made to arrive at the final construct, provided that the final construct possesses the desired characteristics. The amino acid changes also may alter post-translational processing of the humanized anti-IL-17A antibody, such as changing the number or position of glycosylation sites.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne useful method for identifying residues or regions of a humanized anti-IL-17A antibody that are preferred locations for mutagenesis is called \"alanine scanning mutagenesis.\" \nCunningham and Wells (1989) Science 244: 1081-1085\n. A group of target residues is identified (e.g., charged residues such as Arg, Asp, His, Lys, and Glu) and replaced by a neutral or negatively charged amino acid (most preferably alanine or polyalanine) to alter the interaction of the amino acids with IL-17A. The residues showing functional sensitivity to alanine substitutions are then refined by introducing further amino acid substitutions. In one embodiment, the effect of mutations at a given target codon is determined by alanine scanning or random mutagenesis followed by activity and binding analysis of the resulting humanized anti-IL-17A antibody variants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmino acid sequence insertions include amino- and/or carboxyl-terminal fusions ranging in length from one residue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more residues, as well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Examples of terminal insertions include humanized anti-IL-17A antibody with an N-terminal methionyl residue or the antibody fused to an epitope tag. Other variants include the fusion of an enzyme or a polypeptide that increases the serum half-life of an antibody to the N- or C-terminus. Another type of variant is an amino acid substitution variant. These variants have at least one amino acid reside in the humanized anti-IL-17A antibody molecule removed and a different residue inserted in its place. The sites of greatest interest for substitutional mutagenesis include the hypervariable loops, but FR alterations are also contemplated. Hypervariable region residues or FR residues involved in antigen binding are generally substituted in a relatively conservative manner.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther amino acid variants of the antibody alter the original glycosylation pattern of the antibody, e.g. by eliminating one or more carbohydrate moieties and/or adding one or more glycosylation sites. Glycosylation of antibodies is topically either N-linked or O-linked. N-linked refers to the attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The tripeptide sequences asparagine-X-serine and asparagine-X-threonine, where X is any amino acid except proline, are the recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. The presence of either of these tripeptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site. O-linked glycosylation involves attachment of N-acetylgalactosamine, galactose, or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid, most commonly serine or threonine, although 5-hydroxyproline or 5-hydroxylysine may also be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlycosylation sites can be added to the antibodies of the present invention by inserting one or more of the above-described tripeptide sequences (for N-linked glycosylation sites), or addition of one or more serine or threonine residues (for O-linked glycosylation sites). Nucleic acid molecules encoding amino acid sequence variants of humanized IL-17A-specific antibody are prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include, but are not limited to, isolation from a natural source (in the case of naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants), or by oligonucleotide-mediated (or site-directed) mutagenesis, PCR mutagenesis, or cassette mutagenesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOrdinarily, amino acid sequence variants of the humanized anti-IL-17A antibody will have an amino acid sequence having at least 50% amino acid sequence identity with the original humanized antibody amino acid sequences of either the heavy or the light chain, preferably at least 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, and most preferably at least 95%. Identity or homology with respect to this sequence is defined herein as the percentage of amino acid residues in the candidate sequence that are identical with the humanized anti-IL-17A residues when the sequences are optimally aligned (i.e. after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity), and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity. None of N-terminal, C-terminal, or internal extensions, deletions, or insertions into the antibody sequence is considered to affect sequence identity or homology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe humanized antibody can be selected from any class of immunoglobulins, including IgM, IgG, IgD, IgA, and IgE. In one embodiment, the antibody is an IgG antibody. Any isotype of IgG can be used, including IgG\n1\n, IgG\n2\n, IgG\n3\n, and IgG\n4\n. Variants of the IgG isotypes are also contemplated. The humanized antibody may comprise sequences from more than one class or isotype. Optimization of the necessary constant domain sequences to generate the desired biologic activity is readily achieved by screening the antibodies in the biological assays described below in the Examples.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLikewise, either class of light chain can be used in the compounds and methods herein. Specifically, kappa, lambda, or variants thereof are useful in the present compounds and methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny suitable portion of the CDR sequences from the non-human antibody can be used to create the humanized antibodies described herein. The CDR sequences may be mutagenized by substitution, insertion or deletion, although such mutations would be minimal because of the need to maintain IL-17A binding affinity and specificity. Typically, at least 75% of the humanized antibody CDR residues will correspond to those of the non-human CDR residues, more often 90%, and most preferably greater than 95%, and frequently 100%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny suitable portion of the FR sequences from the human antibody can be used. The FR sequences can be mutagenized by substitution, insertion or deletion of at least one residue such that the FR sequence is distinct from the human and non-human antibody sequence employed. It is contemplated that such mutations would be minimal. Typically, at least 75% of the humanized antibody residues will correspond to those of the human FR residues, more often 90%, and most preferably greater than 95%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso contemplated are chimeric antibodies or fragments thereof, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (\n \nU.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567\n \n; and \nMorrison et al. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA 81: 6851-6855\n). As noted above, typical chimeric antibodies comprise constant domain sequences from antibodies from one species linked to the variable domain of an antigen-specific antibody obtained from a different species.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe binding compounds described herein may comprise bispecific antibodies. As used herein, the term \"bispecific antibody\" refers to an antibody, typically a monoclonal antibody, having binding specificities for at least two different antigenic epitopes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe epitopes are from the same antigen. Otherwise, the epitopes are from two different antigens. Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. For example, bispecific antibodies can be produced recombinantly using the co-expression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain/light chain \npairs. See, e.g.,\n \nMilstein et al. (1983) Nature 305: 537-39\n. Alternatively, bispecific antibodies can be prepared using chemical linkage. \nSee, e.g.,\n \nBrennan, et al. (1985) Science 229: 81\n. Bispecific antibodies include bispecific antibody fragments. \nSee, e.g.,\n \nHollinger, et al. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90: 6444-48\n, \nGruber, et al., J. Immunol. 152: 5368 (1994\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn exemplary method of humanizing anti-human IL-17A antibodies described herein is described at Example 3.\n\n\n \nIV. Characterization of IL-17A Specific Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nThe methods described herein were used to generate monoclonal antibodies immunoreactive with human IL-17A, as described in greater detail in Examples 2 and 3. \nFIGS. 1A\n and \n1B\n show sequence alignments of the variable regions of the light and heavy chains, respectively, of various anti-IL-17A antibodies described herein. CDR regions are indicated, and numbering is according to Kabat et al. (1991).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA plasmid containing the nucleic acid sequences encoding the humanized 16C10 light and heavy chains was deposited pursuant to the Budapest Treaty on July 28, 2006, with American Type Culture Collection (ATCC - Manassas, Virginia, USA) under Accession Number PTA-7675. Hybridomas expressing antibodies 30C10 and 23E12 were deposited as JL7-30C10.C3 and JL7-23E12.B10, respectively, pursuant to the Budapest Treaty on July 20, 2006, with American Type Culture Collection (ATCC - Manassas, Virginia, USA) under Accession Numbers PTA-7739 and PTA-7740.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe light and heavy chain CDRs of various humanized antibodies of the present invention are provided at Tables 3 and 4, respectively.

Although they were obtained as independent clones, parental rat antibodies 16C10 and 4C3 are identical in the sequence of the V\nH\n region and differ in the V\nL\n region only by a framework substitution (isoleucine at position 15 in 16C10 is valine in 4C3). As a result, the CDRs are identical for these two parental rat antibodies, and thus for their humanized forms\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSequences are provided for humanized V\nL\n regions of antibodies 16C10/4C3 and 30C10 at SEQ ID NOs: 5 and 22, respectively. Sequences are provided for humanized V\nH\n regions of antibodies 16C10/4C3 and 30C10 at SEQ ID NOs: 6 and 23, respectively. These humanized variable domains may be used to create full-length chimeric or humanized antibodies by adding the appropriate constant domain sequences. Other embodiments include various other alterations in the CDR amino acid residues in the 16C10 heavy chain, for example, as illustrated in Table 4. With reference to the residue numbering of \nFIG. 1B\n, the alterations described in Table 4 (and in SEQ ID NOs: 17 and 20) are N54A, N54Q, N60A, N60Q, M96L, M96A, M96K, M96F, M100hF, M100hL.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChimeric light and heavy chains of antibody 16C10 described herein, are created by appending human constant domains (human kappa light chain and human IgG1 constant domain, respectively) to the C-terminus of the humanized V\nL\n (SEQ ID NO:5) and V\nH\n regions (SEQ ID NO:6). Sequences of chimeric 16C10 light and heavy chains are provided at SEQ ID NOs: 9 and 10. Chimeric forms of antibodies 30C10 and 4C3 described herein are created by fusing the same constant domains from \nchimeric 16C\n 10 to their respective humanized V\nL\n and V\nH\n regions (SEQ ID NOs: 22 and 23 for 30C10; SEQ ID NOs: 5 and 6 for 4C3). The chimeric form of humanized 4C3 would, of course, be identical to the chimeric form of humanized 16C10.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFull length humanized antibodies as described herein are created by substituting framework residues (i.e. those amino acid residues in the variable domain that are not part of a CDR) of the chimeric forms antibodies with human germline framework sequences, as described in more detail in Example 3. The resulting antibodies retain only the CDR sequences from the rat antibodies, with the constant domains and framework sequences replaced by human-derived sequences. Full-length light and heavy chains for humanized antibody 16C10, including signal sequences, are provided at SEQ ID NOs: 2 and 4, respectively. Humanized forms of antibodies 4C3 and 23E12 as described herein are created by analogy with the method described for 16C10, i.e. substituting the appropriate human framework sequences into the sequence of the chimeric versions of these antibodies (described \nsupra\n). See Example 3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe full-length light and heavy chains of the humanized antibodies described herein are cloned to have a signal peptide at their N-terminus to facilitate secretion from cells when the antibody is produced. A 19 amino acid signal sequence is added to both the light and heavy chains of the humanized 16C10 antibody (residues -19 to -1 of SEQ ID NOs: 2 and 4)described herein. DNA sequences of the full length light and heavy chains of humanized \n16C\n 10, with signal sequence added, are provided at SEQ ID NOs: 1 and 3. Such DNA sequences can be cloned and expressed in any suitable expression vector for production of the humanized antibodies described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSignal sequences may be added to the light and heavy chains of humanized antibodies 30C10 and 4C3, as described for antibody 16C10. Signal sequence peptides are added that are different than the specific signal sequence provided in SEQ ID NOs: 1-4, depending on the intended method of production of the antibodies. Such signal sequences may be obtained from the scientific literature, for example \nChoo et al.(2005) \"\nSPdb - a signal peptide database,\n\" BMC Bioinformatics 6:249\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet other embodiments, different constant domains may be appended to the humanized V\nL\n and V\nH\n regions provided herein. For example, if a particular intended use of an antibody (or fragment) of the present invention were to call for altered effector functions, a heavy chain constant domain other than IgG1 may be used. Although IgG1 antibodies provide for long half-life and for effector functions, such as complement activation and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, such activities may not be desirable for all uses of the antibody. In such instances an IgG4 constant domain, for example, may be used.\n\n\n \nV. Affinity and Biological Activity of Humanized Anti-IL-17A\n\n\n \n \n \nAntibodies having the characteristics identified herein as being desirable in a humanized anti-IL-17A antibody can be screened for inhibitory biologic activity \nin vitro, in vivo\n, or by measuring binding affinity. To screen for antibodies that bind to the same epitope on human IL-17A bound by an antibody of interest (e.g., those which block binding of the cytokine to its receptor), a routine cross-blocking assay can be performed such as that described in \nANTIBODIES, A LABORATORY MANUAL, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Ed Harlow and David Lane (1988\n). Alternatively, epitope mapping can be performed to determine whether the antibody binds an epitope of interest, \ne.\ng., as described in \nChampe et al. (1995) J Biol. Chem. 270:1388-1394\n. Antibody affinities (\ne.g\n. for human IL-17A) may be determined using standard methods, including those described in Example 7. Preferred humanized antibodies are those which bind human IL-17A with a K\nd\n value of no more than about 100 nM (1x10\n-7\n M); preferably no more than about 10nM; more preferably no more than about In M. Even more preferred are embodiments in which the antibodies have K\nd\n values of no more than about 200 pM (2x10\n-10\n M), 100 pM, 50 pM, 20 pM, 10 pM, 5pM or even 2 pM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies, and fragments thereof, useful in the present compounds and methods include, but are not limited to, biologically active antibodies and fragments. As used herein, the term \"biologically active\" refers to an antibody or antibody fragment that is capable of binding the desired the antigenic epitope and directly or indirectly exerting a biologic effect. Typically, these effects result from the failure of IL-17A to bind its receptor. As used herein, the term \"specific\" refers to the selective binding of the antibody to the target antigen epitope. Antibodies can be tested for specificity of binding by comparing binding to IL-17A to binding to irrelevant antigen or antigen mixture under a given set of conditions. An antibody is considered to be specific if it binds to IL-17A with an affinity at least 10-fold, and preferably 50-fold higher than its affinity for an irrelevant antigen or antigen mixture. An antibody that \"specifically binds\" to a protein comprising IL-17A (or a fragment thereof) does not bind to proteins that do not comprise the IL-17A-derived sequences, i.e. \"specificity\" as used herein relates to IL-17A specificity, and not any other sequences that may be present in the protein in question. For example, as used herein, an antibody that \"specifically binds\" to FLAG-hIL-17A, which is a fusion protein comprising IL-17A and a FLAG® peptide tag, does not bind to the FLAG® peptide tag alone or when it is fused to a protein other than IL-17A.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe data presented in the Examples below show (e.g. Example 7) that humanized antibody 16C10 (including the N54Q and M96A substitutions relative to the parental rat heavy chain CDRs) has a high affinity for binding to human IL-17A, with a K\nd\n in the 1-10 pM range as determined by KinExA analysis. \nIn vitro\n activity assays, such as Ba/F3 hIL-17Rc-GCSFR cell proliferation assay (Example 11), normal human dermal fibroblast (NHDF) assay (Example 9), and human rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synoviocyte assay (Example 8) confirm that hu16C10 is a high affinity antibody since the observed IC50 values were typically less than or equal to 50% of the concentration of hIL-17A present in the assay (100 pM, 1000 pM, and 1000 pM in the three assays, respectively). The bivalent character of the antibodies used in the experiments, and the potential for IL-17A dimer formation, make it possible to achieve 50% inhibition of a given concentration of IL-17A with less than 0.5 molar equivalents of antibody. \nIn vivo\n activity assays, such as administration to mice exhibiting collagen-induced arthritis (Example 16) and BAL neutrophil recruitment assay (Example 17) confirm the activity of several of the anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention in animals. The \nin vitro\n and \nin vivo\n activity assays also confirm that humanized antibody 16C10 is a neutralizing antibody, which was not known from the binding experiments alone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ability of several of the antibodies described herein to bind to cyno IL-17A as well as human IL-17A is advantageous because such a potential therapeutic antibody can be used directly in cynomolgus monkey for toxicology studies, rather than having to develop a separate cyno-specific antibody for such studies. The high affinity of several of the antibodies described herein is also advantageous in that may reduce the required dosage in human (and other) subjects, which reduces the likelihood of certain adverse reactions. In addition, the high affinity may reduce the volume that must be administered to a subject and reduce the cost of treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe serum half-life of hu16C10 was measured in mouse and in cynomolgus monkeys. In cyno, half-life after intravenous (iv) administration was evaluated in a dose ranging study with 0.4, 4.0 and 40 mg/kg dosing. Serum concentrations of drug were measured periodically for 42 days. The half-life for subcutaneous (sc) administration in cyno was determined at 4 mg/kg dosing, which was also followed for 42 days. The half-life in cynomolgus monkeys was 10-19 days iv and 28 days sc as measured by the terminal slope of the drug concentration versus time profile. Certain anomalous datapoints at higher dosings were excluded from the analysis. Similar experiments in mice showed that the hu16C10 antibody had a half-life of 13-25 days iv and 12-22 days sc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExample 19 describes methods used to determine the epitope bound by an exemplary anti-IL-17A antibody of the present invention (16C10), i.e. residues in the region of L74-Y85 of human IL-17A (SEQ ID NO.: 40). Since the biological assay data presented herein demonstrate that antibody 16C10 is a high affinity neutralizing antibody, other antibodies that bind to the same epitope may also be expected to be neutralizing antibodies, and perhaps also have high binding affinity. The epitope as determined herein is obtained by functional measurements, rather than structure determinations, and the epitope reported herein may differ in detail from the epitope determined by structural methods. The epitope reported herein includes at least some, but not necessarily all, of the amino acid residues that are important for antibody 16C10 binding. The epitope bound by antibodies of the present invention may also be determined by other methods, such as cross-blocking experiments (see Example 12), or by structural methods such as X-ray crystal structure determination. Additional antibodies binding to the same epitope as antibody 16C10 maybe obtained, for example, by screening of antibodies raised against hIL-17A, or by immunization of an animal with a peptide comprising the epitope sequence.\n\n\n \nV. Antibody Production\n\n\n \n \n \nFor recombinant production of the antibody, the nucleic acid encoding it is isolated and inserted into a replicable vector for further cloning (amplification of the DNA) or for expression. DNA encoding the monoclonal antibody is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (\ne.g.\n, by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the antibody). Many vectors are available. The vector components generally include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: a signal sequence, an origin of replication, one or more marker genes, an enhancer element, a promoter, and a transcription termination sequence. Both the light and heavy chains of the humanized anti-IL-17A antibody described herein are expressed from the same vector, e.g. a plasmid or an adenoviral vector.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies described herein may be produced by any method known in the art. In one embodiment, antibodies are expressed in mammalian or insect cells in culture, such as chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, mouse myeloma NSO cells, baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, \nSpodoptera frugiperda\n ovarian (Sf9) cells. In one embodiment, antibodies secreted from CHO cells are recovered and purified by standard chromatographic methods, such as protein A, cation exchange, anion exchange, hydrophobic interaction, and hydroxyapatite chromatography. Resulting antibodies are concentrated and stored in 20 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies described herein are produced in yeast according to the methods described in \n \nWO2005/040395\n \n. Briefly, vectors encoding the individual light or heavy chains of an antibody of interest are introduced into different yeast haploid cells, e.g. different mating types of the yeast \nPichia pastoris,\n which yeast haploid cells are optionally complementary auxotrophs. The transformed haploid yeast cells can then be mated or fused to give a diploid yeast cell capable of producing both the heavy and the light chains. The diploid strain is then able to secret the fully assembled and biologically active antibody. The relative expression levels of the two chains can be optimized, for example, by using vectors with different copy number, using transcriptional promoters of different strengths, or inducing expression from inducible promoters driving transcription of the genes encoding one or both chains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe respective heavy and light chains of a plurality of different anti-IL-17A antibodies (the \"original\" antibodies) are introduced into yeast haploid cells to create a library of haploid yeast strains of one mating type expressing a plurality of light chains, and a library of haploid yeast strains of a different mating type expressing a plurality of heavy chains. These libraries of haploid strains can be mated (or fused as spheroplasts) to produce a series of diploid yeast cells expressing a combinatorial library of antibodies comprised of the various possible permutations of light and heavy chains. The combinatorial library of antibodies can then be screened to determine whether any of the antibodies has properties that are superior (e.g. higher affinity for IL-17A) to those of the original antibodies. See. e.g., \n \nWO2005/040395\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies described herein are human domain antibodies in which portions of an antibody variable domain are linked in a polypeptide of molecular weight approximately 13 kDa. \nSee, e.g.,\n \n \nU.S. Pat. Publication No. 2004/0110941\n \n. Such single domain, low molecular weight agents provide numerous advantages in terms of ease of synthesis, stability, and route of administration.\n\n\n \nVI. Pharmaceutical Compositions and Administration\n\n\n \n \n \nTo prepare pharmaceutical or sterile compositions of the anti-huIL-17A antibodies described herein , the antibody is admixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. See, e.g., \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences and U.S. Pharmacopeia: National Formulary, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, PA (1984\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations of therapeutic and diagnostic agents may be prepared by mixing with physiologically acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers in the form of, e.g., lyophilized powders, slurries, aqueous solutions or suspensions (see, e.g., \nHardman, et al. (2001) Goodman and Gilman 's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, McGraw-Hill, New York, NY\n; \nGennaro (2000) Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, Lippincott, Williams, and Wilkins, New York, NY\n; \nAvis, et al. (eds.) (1993) Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Parenteral Medications, Marcel Dekker, NY\n; \nLieberman, et al. (eds.) (1990) Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Tablets, Marcel Dekker, NY\n; \nLieberman, et al. (eds.) (1990) Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Disperse Systems, Marcel Dekker, NY\n; \nWeiner and Kotkoskie (2000) Excipient Toxicity and Safety, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, NY\n). Anti-IL-17A antibodies described herein are diluted to an appropriate concentration in a sodium acetate solution pH 5-6, and NaCl or sucrose is added for tonicity. Additional agents, such as \npolysorbate\n 20 or \npolysorbate\n 80, may be added to enhance stability.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nToxicity and therapeutic efficacy of the antibody compositions, administered alone or in combination with another agent, can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, \ne.g\n., for determining the LD\n50\n (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED\n50\n (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index (LD\n50\n/ ED\n50\n). Antibodies exhibiting high therapeutic indices are preferred. The data obtained from these cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in human. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED\n50\n with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe mode of administration is not particularly important. Suitable routes of administration include oral, rectal, transmucosal, or intestinal administration; parenteral delivery, including intramuscular, subcutaneous, intramedullary injections, as well as intrathecal, direct intraventricular, intravenous, intraperitoneal, intranasal, or intraocular injections. Administration can be carried out in a variety of conventional ways, such as oral ingestion, inhalation, insufflation, topical application or cutaneous, transdermal, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, parenteral, intra-arterial or intravenous injection. Intravenous administration to the patient is preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, one may administer the antibody in a local rather than systemic manner, for example, via injection of the antibody directly into an arthritic joint or pathogen-induced lesion characterized by immunopathology, often in a depot or sustained release formulation. Furthermore, one may administer the antibody in a targeted drug delivery system, for example, in a liposome coated with a tissue-specific antibody, targeting, for example, arthritic joint or pathogen-induced lesion characterized by immunopathology. The liposomes will be targeted to and taken up selectively by the afflicted tissue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe administration regimen depends on several factors, including the serum or tissue turnover rate of the therapeutic antibody, the level of symptoms, the immunogenicity of the therapeutic antibody, and the accessibility of the target cells in the biological matrix. Preferably, the administration regimen delivers sufficient therapeutic antibody to effect improvement in the target disease state, while simultaneously minimizing undesired side effects. Accordingly, the amount of biologic delivered depends in part on the particular therapeutic antibody and the severity of the condition being treated. Guidance in selecting appropriate doses of therapeutic antibodies is available (see, e.g., \nWawrzynczak (1996) Antibody Therapy, Bios Scientific Pub. Ltd, Oxfordshire, UK\n; \nKresina (ed.) (1991) Monoclonal Antibodies, Cytokines and Arthritis, Marcel Dekker, New York, NY\n; \nBach (ed.) (1993) Monoclonal Antibodies and Peptide Therapy in Autoimmune Diseases, Marcel Dekker, New York, NY\n; \nBaert, et al. (2003) New Engl. J. Med. 348:601-608\n; \nMilgrom et al. (1999) New Engl. J. Med. 341:1966-1973\n; \nSlamon et al. (2001) New Engl. J Med 344:783-792\n; \nBeniaminovitz et al. (2000) New Engl. J. Med. 342:613-619\n; \nGhosh et al. (2003) New Engl. J. Med. 348:24-32\n; \nLipsky et al. (2000) New Engl. J. Med. 343:1594-1602\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDetermination of the appropriate dose is made by the clinician, e.g., using parameters or factors known or suspected in the art to affect treatment. Generally, the dose begins with an amount somewhat less than the optimum dose and it is increased by small increments thereafter until the desired or optimum effect is achieved relative to any negative side effects. Important diagnostic measures include those of symptoms of, e.g., the inflammation or level of inflammatory cytokines produced. Preferably, a biologic that will be used is derived from the same species as the animal targeted for treatment, thereby minimizing an inflammatory, autoimmune, or proliferative response to the reagent. In the case of human subjects, for example, chimeric, humanized and fully human antibodies are preferred. Antibodies, antibody fragments, and cytokines can be provided by continuous infusion, or by doses administered, e.g., daily, 1-7 times per week, weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, bimonthly etc. Doses may be provided intravenously, subcutaneously, topically, orally, nasally, rectally, intramuscular, intracerebrally, intraspinally, or by inhalation. A total weekly dose is generally at least 0.05 µg/kg body weight, more generally at least 0.2 µg/kg, 0.5 µg/kg, 1 µg/kg, 10 µgkg, 100 µg/kg, 0.25 mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg, 2.0 mg/kg, 5.0 mg/ml, 10 mg/kg, 25 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg or more (see, e.g., \nYang, et al. (2003) New Engl. J. Med. 349:427-434\n; \nHerold, et al. (2002) New Engl. J. Med. 346:1692-1698\n; \nLiu, et al. (1999) J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psych. 67:451-456\n; \nPortielji, et al. (20003) Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 52:133-144\n). Doses may also be provided to achieve a pre-determined target concentration of anti-IL-17A antibody in the subject's serum, such as 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30, 100, 300 µg/ml or more. In other embodiments, a humanized anti-IL-17A antibody of the present invention is administered subcutaneously or intravenously, on a weekly, biweekly or \"every 4weeks\" basis at 10, 20, 50, 80, 100, 200, 500, 1000 or 2500 mg/subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, \"inhibit\" or \"treat\" or \"treatment\" includes a postponement of development of the symptoms associated with a disorder and/or a reduction in the severity of the symptoms of such disorder. The terms further include ameliorating existing uncontrolled or unwanted symptoms, preventing additional symptoms, and ameliorating or preventing the underlying causes of such symptoms. Thus, the terms denote that a beneficial result has been conferred on a vertebrate subject with a disorder, disease or symptom, or with the potential to develop such a disorder, disease or symptom.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the terms \"therapeutically effective amount\", \"therapeutically effective dose\" and \"effective amount\" refer to an amount of an IL-17A binding compound of the invention that, when administered alone or in combination with an additional therapeutic agent to a cell, tissue, or subject, is effective to prevent or ameliorate one or more symptoms of a disease or condition or the progression of such disease or condition. A therapeutically effective dose further refers to that amount of the binding compound sufficient to result in amelioration of symptoms, \ne.g\n., treatment, healing, prevention or amelioration of the relevant medical condition, or an increase in rate of treatment, healing, prevention or amelioration of such conditions. When applied to an individual active ingredient administered alone, a therapeutically effective dose refers to that ingredient alone. When applied to a combination, a therapeutically effective dose refers to combined amounts of the active ingredients that result in the therapeutic effect, whether administered in combination, serially or simultaneously. An effective amount of a therapeutic will result in an improvement of a diagnostic measure or parameter by at least 10%; usually by at least 20%; preferably at least about 30%; more preferably at least 40%, and most preferably by at least 50%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for co-administration with a second therapeutic agent, e.g., cytokine, another therapeutic antibody, steroid, chemotherapeutic agent, or antibiotic are well known in the art, see, e.g., \nHardman, et al. (eds.) (2001) Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 10th ed., McGraw-Hill, New York, NY\n; \nPoole and Peterson (eds.) (2001) Pharmacotherapeutics for Advanced Practice: A Practical Approach, Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, Phila., PA\n; \nChabner and Longo (eds.)

Any suitable immunosuppressive agent can be employed, including but not limited to anti-inflammatory agents, corticosteroids, cyclosporine, tacrolimus (i.e., FK-506), sirolimus, interferons, soluble cytokine receptors \n(e.g.,\n sTNRF and sIL-1R), agents that neutralize cytokine activity \n(e.g.,\n inflixmab, etanercept), mycophenolate mofetil, 15-deoxyspergualin, thalidomide, glatiramer, azathioprine, leflunomide, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and the like. The pharmaceutical composition can also be employed with other therapeutic modalities such as phototherapy and radiation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe IL-17A binding compounds described herein can also be used in combination with one or more antagonists of other cytokines (e.g. antibodies), including but not limited to, IL-23, IL-1β, IL-6 and TGF-β. See, e.g., \nVeldhoen (2006) Immunity 24:179-189\n; \nDong (2006) Nat. Rev. Immunol. 6(4):329-333\n. In various embodiments, an IL-17A binding compound of the invention is administered before, concurrently with, or after administration of the another antagonist or antagonists. In one embodiment, an IL-17A binding compound of the present invention is used in treatment of the acute early phase of an adverse immune response (e.g. MS, Crohn's Disease) alone or in combination with an IL-23 antagonist. In the latter case, the IL-17A binding compound may be gradually decreased and treatment with the antagonist of IL-23 alone is continued to maintain suppression of the adverse response. Alternatively, antagonists to IL-1β, IL-6 and/or TGF-β may be administered concurrently, before or after an IL-17A binding compound of the present invention. \nSee\n \nCua and Kastelein (2006) Nat.

Uses.\n\n\n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions comprising engineered anti-IL-17A antibodies for use in the treament and diagnosis of inflammatory disorders and conditions, as well as autoimmune and proliferative disorders are also described herein. Pharmaceutical compositions are described for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); multiple sclerosis (MS), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis (CF), psoriasis, systemic scleroderma, allograft rejection, autoimmune myocarditis and peritoneal adhesions (see, e.g., \nChung et al. (2002) J. Exp. Med. 195:1471-78\n).\n\n\n \n\n\nPsoriasis\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe skin serves as an important boundary between the internal milieu and the environment, preventing contact with potentially harmful antigens. In the case of antigen/pathogen penetration, an inflammatory response is induced to eliminate the antigen. This response leads to a dermal infiltrate that consists predominantly of T cells, polymorphonuclear cells, and macrophages (see, e.g., \nWilliams and Kupper (1996) Life Sci., 58:1485-1507\n.) Normally, this inflammatory response, triggered by the pathogen, is under tight control and will be halted upon elimination of the pathogen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain cases this inflammatory response occurs without external stimuli and without proper controls, leading to cutaneous inflammation. Pharmaceutical compositions are described herein for use in treating and diagnosing cutaneous inflammation. Cutaneous inflammation, the result of the cellular infiltrate noted above as well as the secreted cytokines from these cells, encompasses several inflammatory disorders such as cicatricial pemphigoid, scleroderma, hidradenitis suppurativa, toxic epidermal necrolysis, acne, osteitis, graft vs. host disease (GvHD), pyroderma gangrenosum, and Behcet's Syndrome (see, e.g., \nWillams and Griffiths (2002) Clin. Exp. Dermatol., 27:585-590\n). The most common form of cutaneous inflammation is psoriasis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPsoriasis is characterized by T cell mediated hyperproliferation of keratinocytes coupled with an inflammatory infiltrate. The disease has certain distinct overlapping clinical phenotypes including chronic plaque lesions, skin eruptions, and pustular lesions (see, e.g., \nGudjonsson et al. (2004) Clin Exp. Immunol. 135:1-8\n). Approximately 10% of psoriasis patients develop arthritis. The disease has a strong but complex genetic predisposition, with 60% concordance in monozygotic twins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe typical psoriatic lesion is a well defined erythematous plaque covered by thick, silvery scales. The inflammation and hyperproliferation of psoriatic tissue is associated with a different histological, antigenic, and cytokine profile than normal skin. Among the cytokines associated with psoriasis are: TNFα, IL-19, IL-18, IL-15, IL-12, IL-7, IFNγ, IL-17A and IL-23 (see Gudjonsson et al., \nsupra\n). IL-17A has been detected in psoriatic skin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-IL-17A antibodies described herein, either alone or in combination with other agents, may be used in prevention, treatment, diagnosis and prediction of psoriasis flare-ups. Use of anti-IL-17A antibodies in prediction and treatment of psoriatic outbreaks is described in commonly assigned \n \nU.S. Patent Application Publication 2005/0287593\n \n and \n \nPCT Patent Publication WO 2005/108616\n \n.\n\n\n \n\n\nRheumatoid Arthritis (RA)\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nRA is a progressive, systemic disease characterized by inflammation of the synovial joints affecting about 0.5% of the world's population. \nEmery (2006) BMJ 332:152-155\n. Joint inflammation can lead to deformity, pain, stiffness and swelling, and ultimately to irreversible deterioration of the joint. Affected joints include knees, elbows, neck and joints of the hands and feet. Conventional treatment involves use of NSAIDs to alleviate symptoms, followed by administration of disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as gold, penicillamine, sulfasalazine and methotrexate. Recent advances include treatment with TNF-α inhibitors, including monoclonal antibodies, such as infliximab, adalumimab and golimumab, and receptor fusion proteins, such as etanercept. Treatment with these TNF-α inhibitors dramatically reduces structural damage from the disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-IL-17A antibodies described herein may be used to treat RA in subjects in need of such treatment. Example 16 describes experiments involving the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model of RA, for which data are presented at \nFIGS. 3A-3D\n, and Table 15. The results show a reduction in the fraction of paws with high disease severity scores in animals treated with an anti-IL-17A antibody described herein as compared with diluent and isotype controls.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-IL-17A antibodies described herein may also be combined with other treatments for RA, e.g. methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, steroids, mycophenolate mofetil, NSAIDs, or TNF-α inhibitors (antibodies or receptor fragments).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-IL-17A antibodies described herein are used to treat human subjects who have not previously responded adequately to treatment with DMARDs alone. In another embodiment, treatment with the anti-IL-17A antibodies described herein is begun early in the course of disease, without requiring prior failure of DMARD therapy. Such early intervention may be appropriate, for example, once the safety of the antibody therapy has been firmly established.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nClinical improvement is measured by determining the ACR score, as described in more detail in Example 18. In various embodiments, ACR scores of 20, 50, and 70 are the desired endpoint, and these endpoints may be assessed at any appropriate point in the course of treatment, such as 5, 10, 15, 24, 40, 50 or more weeks.\n\n\n \n\n\nMultiple Sclerosis (MS)\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMS is thought to be an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) involving loss of myelin from nerve fibers, resulting in plaques or lesions. The most common form is relapsing/remitting MS in which well defined symptomatic flare-ups occur, followed by periods of partial or complete remission. Conventional treatment options include interferon-β-1a and -1b, mitoxantrone, the tetrapeptide glatiramer acetate, therapeutic alpha-4-integrin-specific antibodies (natalizumab), or small molecule antagonists of alpha-4-integrin (e.g. those disclosed at \n \nWO2003/084984\n \n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-IL-17A antibodies described herein may be used to treat MS in subjects in need of such treatment. The anti-IL-17A antibodies may also be combined with other treatments for MS, e.g. interferon-β, interferon-α, steroids or alpha-4-integrin-specific antibodies.\n\n\n \n\n\nInflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIBD is the name for a group of disorders (e.g. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) in which the intestines become inflamed, resulting in abdominal cramps and pain, diarrhea, weight loss and intestinal bleeding. IBD affects over 600,000 Americans. Conventional treatment options include sulfasalazine, corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone), immune system suppressors such as azathioprine and mercaptopurine, or an antibiotic (e.g. metronidazole) for Crohn's disease. Therapeutic monoclonal antibody treatments include etanercept, natalizumab and infliximab.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-IL-17A antibodies described herein may be used to treat IBD in subjects in need of such treatment. \nYen et al. (2006) J. Clin. Invest. 116:1310-1316\n; \nFujimo et al. (2003) Gut 52:65-70\n. The anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention may also be combined with other treatments for IBD, e.g. IL-10 (see \n \nU.S. Pat. Nos. 5,368,854\n \n, \n \n7,052,686\n \n), steroids and sulfasalazine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies described herein that do not block binding of IL-17A to its receptor (e.g. non-neutralizing antibody 12E6) are used therapeutically to stabilize IL-17A in subjects in need to prolonged IL-17A activity. Such subjects include patients suffering from infections or cancers.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 1\n\n\nGeneral Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nStandard methods in molecular biology are described (\nManiatis, et al.

Animals can be immunized with cells bearing the antigen of interest. Splenocytes can then be isolated from the immunized animals, and the splenocytes can fused with a myeloma cell line to produce a hybridoma (see, e.g., \nMeyaard et al.

Eight week old female Lewis rats (Harlan Sprague Dawley, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA) were given a series of injections of recombinant human IL-17A (rhIL-17A) that had been expressed from adenoviral vectors in HEK 293 cells. The injections were given at \ndays\n 0, 14, 32, 46, and 83.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe \nday\n 0 injection was a subcutaneous (sc) injection of 50 µg rhIL-17A, accompanied by intraperitoneal (ip) injection of Freund's Complete Adjuvant. Day 14, 32 and 46 sc injections of 25 µg rhIL-17A were accompanied by ip injection of Freund's Incomplete Adjuvant. The day 83 injection was a combination of an ip injection of 20 µg rhIL-17A in Freund's Incomplete Adjuvant and an intravenous (iv) tail vein injection of rhIL-17A in saline.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA test bleed was performed at day 53. Fusion of rat splenocytes was performed on day 87, using 1.6 X 10\n8\n splenocytes and 1.8 X 10\n8\n myeloma cells divided into in thirty 96-well plates, giving a total of 1.13 X 10\n5\n total cells per well.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrimary screening of the resulting monoclonal antibodies (thousands) was performed by indirect rhIL-17A ELISA (see Example 5). Secondary screens on the resulting antibodies included neutralization of rhIL-17 A-induced expression of murine IL-6 by ST2 (mouse stromal) cells and neutralization of rhIL-17A-induced proliferation of Ba/F3 hIL-17Rc:mGCSFR cells (see Example 11). Approximately eleven of the monoclonals were studied further after the first and second screens. Subsequent experiments were performed to confirm that the candidate antibodies were able to bind to native huIL-17A to ensure that they would be useful in various therapeutic, diagnostic and/or research purposes. Such screening may be done using binding assays (such as indirect ELISA or sandwich ELISA); by \nin vitro\n activity assay, or by \nin vivo\n activity assay, examples of which are provided herein.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 3\n\n\nHumanization of Rat Anti Human IL-17A Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nThe humanization of rat anti human IL-17A monoclonal antibody 16C10 was performed essentially as described in \n \nWO 2005/047324\n \n and \n \nWO 2005/047326\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBriefly, human constant domains were used to replace the parental (rat) constant domains, and human germline sequences homologous to the rat variable domain sequences were selected and used to provide a human framework for the rat CDRs, as described in more detail below.\n\n\n \n\n\nProcedure for Selection of Human Germline Framework Sequences\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following steps are used in selecting the appropriate germline framework sequences in humanizing the anti-human IL-17A antibodies of the present invention. 1) Clone and sequence non-human V\nL\n and V\nH\n domains and determine amino acid sequence.\n\n\n \n\n\nHeavy Chain\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n2) Compare the non-human V\nH\n sequence to a group of five human V\nH\n germline amino acid sequences; one representative from subgroups IGHV1 and IGHV4 and three representatives from subgroup IGHV3. The V\nH\n subgroups are listed in \nM.-P. Lefranc (2001) \"\nNomenclature of the Human Immunoglobulin Heavy (IGH) Genes\n\", Experimental and Clinical Immunogenetics, 18:100-116\n. Comparison to the five germline sequences is performed as follows:\n\n\nA) Assign the non-human V\nH\n sequence residue numbers according to Kabat et al. (1991).\n\nB) Align the non-human V\nH\n sequence with each of the five human germline sequences. Since the V genes only comprise V\nH\n residues 1-94, only these residues are considered in the alignment.\n\nC) Delineate the complementarity-determining (CDR) and framework (FR) regions in the sequence.

This combination of the rat variable domains and human constant domains comprises a chimeric version of antibody 16C10. The sequences of the light and heavy chains of this chimeric 16C10 are provided at SEQ ID NOs: 9 and 10, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWith regard to modification of the framework regions of the variable domains, the amino acid sequence of the V\nH\n domain of antibody 16C10 was compared to a group of five human V\nH\n germline amino acid sequences; one representative from subgroups IGHV1 and IGHV4 and three representatives from subgroup IGHV3. The V\nH\n subgroups are listed in M.-P. Lefranc, \"Nomenclature of the Human Immunoglobulin Heavy (IGH) Genes,\" \nExperimental and Clinical Immunogenetics,\n 18:100-116,2001. Antibody 16C10 scored highest against human heavy chain germline DP-71 in subgroup IV.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe V\nL\n sequence of 16C10 was of the kappa subclass. This sequence was compared to a group of four human V\nL\n kappa germline amino acid sequences. The group of four is comprised of one representative from each of four established human V\nL\n subgroups listed in \nV. Barbie & M.-P. Lefranc, \"\nThe Human Immunoglobulin Kappa Variable (IGKV) Genes and Joining (IGKJ) Segments\n\", Experimental and Clinical Immunogenetics, 15:171-183, 1998\n and \nM.-P. Lefranc, \"\nNomenclature of the Human Immunoglobulin Kappa (IGK) Genes\n\", Experimental and Clinical Immunogenetics, 18:161-174, 2001\n. The four subgroups also correspond to the four subgroups listed in Kabat et al. (1991) at pp. 103-130. Antibody 16C10 scored highest against human light chain germline Z-A19 in subgroup II.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOnce the desired germline framework sequences were determined, a plasmid encoding the full-length humanized variable heavy and light chains was generated. Substitution of human framework residues in place of the framework residues of the parental rat antibody 16C10 can be viewed equivalently as the grafting of the rat 16C10 CDRs onto the human framework sequences. The resulting antibody is referred to herein as \"16C10wt\", with the \"wt\" designating the presence of the same CDRs as the parental rat 16C10, as distinguished from the optimized CDRs (having two single amino acid alterations) discussed below. Both the light and heavy chain variable domains were codon optimized, synthesized and inserted onto constant domains to provide for potentially optimal expression. Codon optimization, which may improve expression of cloned antibodies, is purely optional.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the substitution of human constant domain and framework sequences, the humanized 16C10 wt antibody was also modified at two CDR residues to provide for greater chemical stability of the final humanized antibody. The two changes are represented by bolded amino acid residues in the \"hu16C10\" V\nH\n sequence shown in \nFIG. 1B\n. With reference to the Kabat numbering used in \nFIG. 1B\n, residue 54 of CDR2 was changed from N (asparagine) in the rat antibody to Q (glutamine) in the humanized antibody to reduce the potential for formation of isoaspartate at the NG sequence at residues 54-55. Isoaspartate formation may debilitate or completely abrogate binding of an antibody to its target antigen. \nPresta (2005) J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 116:731 at 734\n. In addition, residue 96 of CDR3 was changed from M (methionine) in the rat antibody to A (alanine) in the humanized antibody to reduce the possibility that the methionine sulfur would oxidize, which could reduce antigen binding affinity and also contribute to molecular heterogeneity in the final antibody preparation. \nId\n. These single-residue modifications can be represented as N54Q and M96A. The final humanized 16C10 antibody disclosed herein comprises these two substitutions relative to the parental rat 16C10 CDRs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment of the present invention, the chimeric (not humanized) 16C10 antibody is altered to incorporate the two single-residue modifications described above for the humanized form, i.e. N54Q and M96A.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino acid sequences of the light and heavy chains of humanized antibody 16C10 (hu 16C10) are provided at \nFIGS. 2A\n and \n2B\n respectively, and at SEQ ID NOs: 2 and 4 (which include signal sequences). One embodiment of nucleotide sequences encoding the light and heavy chains ofhu 16C10 are shown in SEQ ID NOs:1 and 3. Another embodiment of nucleotide sequences encoding the light and heavy chains of hu 16C10 are shown in \nFigure 5A\n (SEQ ID NO:62) and \nFigure 5B\n (SEQ ID NO:63).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the interest of clarity with regard to nomenclature, it is important to recognize that the Kabat numbering system includes non-numerical amino acid residue designations (e.g. V\nH\n residues 83a, 83b, 83c) to accommodate variations in the lengths of CDRs and framework regions among various antibodies. Although this numbering system is advantageous in allowing easy reference to corresponding amino acid residues among various antibodies with CDRs of different lengths, it can result in conflicting designations for specific amino acid residues when compared with strict sequential-numeric sequence numbering (e.g. sequence listings). Amino acid residue designations herein are made with reference to the relevant sequence listing unless otherwise noted, for example by reference to \"Kabat numbering\".\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs an additional point of clarification with regard to nomenclature, SEQ ID NOs: 2 and 4 (humanized 16C10) include the sequences of N-terminal signal peptides (the first 19 residues of each), which amino acids are removed in the mature form of the antibody. SEQ ID NOs: 1, 3, 62 and 63 include 57 nucleotides encoding the signal sequences. As used herein, a \"mature\" form of a protein refers to the protein without the signal sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHumanized antibody 4C3 is created by methods analogous to those described above for antibody 16C10. Because the parental rat 4C3 antibody differed only at a single amino acid residue in the framework region of the light chain, and such framework regions are replaced with human germline framework sequences during humanization, the ultimate humanized 4C3 antibody sequence is identical to the sequence of humanized 16C10 antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHumanized antibody 30C10 is also created by methods analogous to those described above for antibody 16C10. In determining the proper human framework sequences to be used, the parental rat 30C10 antibody scores highest against human heavy chain germline DP-46 in subgroup III and human light chain germline Z-A19 in subgroup II, so those framework sequences are substituted for the rat framework sequences. The humanized 30C10 V\nL\n and V\nH\n sequences are provided at SEQ ID NOs: 22 and 23, respectively. In other embodiments, one or more methionine residues in the CDRs of rat 30C10 are mutated to avoid the potential of oxidation of the methionine sulfur in the humanized 30C10 antibody. Specifically, heavy chain residue 34 (in CDRH1) and/or light chain residue 30f (Kabat numbering, see \nFIG. 1A\n) are changed from methionine to another amino acid, e.g. alanine. Such antibodies are subsequently screened to ensure that the methionine substitution does not decrease IL-17A binding affinity to unacceptable levels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChimeric, humanized, and signal sequence-containing versions of antibody 12E6 are created using the methods described herein, by analogy with preparation of such antibodies based on parental rat antibody 16C10. Light and heavy chain CDRs for parental rat antibody 12E6 are provided at SEQ ID NOs: 34-36 and 37-39. Human constant domain and variable domain framework sequences are introduced as described above. In one embodiment, heavy chain residue 34 (in CDRH1) is changed from a methionine to another amino acid, e.g. alanine, to avoid the potential of oxidation of the methionine sulfur in the humanized 12E6 antibody. The resulting antibodies are subsequently screened to ensure that the methionine substitution does not decrease IL-17A binding affinity to unacceptable levels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChimeric, humanized, and signal sequence-containing versions of antibody 23E12 are created using the methods described herein, by analogy with preparation of such antibodies based on parental rat antibody 16C10. Light and heavy chain variable domain sequences for the parental rat antibody 23E12 are provided at SEQ ID NOs: 44 and 46 (DNA), and 45 and 47 (amino acid). CDRs for parental rat antibody 23E12 are provided at SEQ ID NOs: 48-50 (light chain) and 51-53 (heavy chain). Human constant domain and variable domain framework sequences are introduced into the parental rat antibodies as described above.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 4\n\n\nFully Human Anti-IL-17A Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nFully human anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibodies are generated using transgenic mice carrying parts of the human immune system rather than the mouse system. These transgenic mice, referred to herein as \"HuMAb\" mice, contain human immunoglobulin gene miniloci that encode unrearranged human heavy (µ and γ) and κ light chain immunoglobulin sequences, together with targeted mutations that inactivate the endogenous µ and κ chain loci (\nLonberg et al. (1994) Nature 368(6474):856-859\n). Accordingly, the mice exhibit reduced expression of mouse IgM or κ, and in response to immunization, the introduced human heavy and light chain transgenes undergo class switching and somatic mutation to generate high affinity human IgG, κ monoclonal antibodies (Lonberg et al. (1994), \nsupra;\n reviewed in \nLonberg (1994) Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology 113:49-101\n; \nLonberg et al. (1995) Intern. Rev. Immunol. 13:65-93\n, and \nHarding et al. (1995) Ann. N. Y.

(1994); Fishwild et al. (1996) and \n \nWO 98/24884\n \n. Preferably, the mice are 6-16 weeks of age upon the first immunization. For example, a purified preparation of IL-17A can be used to immunize the HuMab mice intraperitoneally. The mice can also be immunized with whole HEK293 cells that are stably transformed or transfected with an IL-17A gene. An \"antigenic IL-17A polypeptide\" may refer to an IL-17A polypeptide of any fragment thereof, which elicits an anti-IL-17A immune response in HuMab mice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, HuMAb transgenic mice respond best when initially immunized intraperitoneally (IP) with antigen in complete Freund's adjuvant, followed by every other week IP immunizations (usually up to a total of 6) with antigen in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Mice are immunized first with cells expressing IL-17A (e.g., stably transformed HEK293 cells), then with a soluble fragment of IL-17A, followed by alternating immunizations with the two antigens. The immune response is monitored over the course of the immunization protocol with plasma samples being obtained by retroorbital bleeds. The plasma are screened for the presence of anti-IL-17A antibodies, for example by ELISA, and mice with sufficient titers of immunoglobulin are used for fusions. Mice are boosted intravenously with antigen three days before sacrifice and removal of the spleen. Two to three fusions for each antigen may be necessary. Several mice are immunized for each antigen. For example, a total of twelve HuMAb mice of the HCO7 and HCO12 strains can be immunized.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHybridoma cells producing the monoclonal, fully human anti-IL-17A antibodies are produced by methods commonly known in the art, such as the hybridoma technique originally developed by \nKohler et al. (1975) (Nature 256:495-497\n); the trioma technique (\nHering et al. (1988) Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 47:211-216\n and \nHagiwara et al. (1993) Hum. Antibod. Hybridomas 4:15\n); the human B-cell hybridoma technique (\nKozbor et al. (1983) Immunology Today 4:72\n and \nCote et al. (1983) Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80:2026-2030\n); and the EBV-hybridoma technique (\nCole et al. (1985) in Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, Alan R. Liss, Inc., pp. 77-96\n). Preferably, mouse splenocytes are isolated and fused with PEG to a mouse myeloma cell line based on standard protocols. The resulting hybridomas may then be screened for the production of antigen-specific antibodies. In one embodiment, single cell suspensions of splenic lymphocytes from immunized mice are fused to one-sixth the number of P3X63-Ag8.653 nonsecreting mouse myeloma cells (ATCC, CRL 1580) with 50% PEG. Cells are plated at approximately 2 x 10\n5\n cells/mL in a flat bottom microtiter plate, followed by a two week incubation in selective medium containing 20% fetal Clone Serum, 18% \"653\" conditioned media, 5% origen, 4 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 5mM HEPES, 0.055 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 mg/ml streptomycin, 50 mg/ml gentamicin and 1X HAT (Sigma; the HAT is added 24 hours after the fusion). After two weeks are cultured in medium in which the HAT is replaced with HT. Individual wells are then screened by ELISA for human anti-IL-17A monoclonal IgG antibodies. Once extensive hybridoma growth occurs, medium is observed usually after 10-14 days. The antibody secreting hybridomas are replated, screened again, and if still positive for human IgG, anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibodies are subcloned at least twice by limiting dilution. The stable subclones are then cultured \nin vitro\n to generate small amounts of antibody in tissue culture medium for characterization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the anti-IL-17A antibody molecules described herein are produced recombinantly (e.g., in an E.coli/T7 expression system). In this embodiment, nucleic acids encoding the antibody molecules of the invention (e.g., V\nH\n or V\nL\n) are inserted into a pET-based plasmid and expressed in the E.coli/T7 system. There are several methods to produce recombinant antibodies known in the art, e.g. \n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,816,567\n \n which is hereby incorporated by reference. The antibody molecules may also be produced recombinantly in CHO or NSO cells.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 5\n\n\nIndirect ELISA of anti-IL-17A Monoclonal Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nBinding of anti-human-IL-17A monoclonal antibodies to rhIL-17A is assessed using an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Briefly, a fixed concentration of rhIL-17A is bound directly to the wells of a microtiter plate. The monoclonal anti-IL-17A to be assayed is then is added to the rhIL-17A coated plate, where the antibody is captured and quantitated. A more detailed protocol follows.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA 96-well U-bottom MaxiSorp plate is coated with 50 µl/well of rhIL-17A (0.5 µg/ml) in carbonate coating buffer (the \"assay plate\"). Carbonate coating buffer is 2.9 g/L NaHCO\n3\n, 1.6 g/L Na\n2\nCO\n3\n, pH 9.4. Plates are incubated covered at 4°C overnight. Monoclonal antibodies to be screened are serially diluted in duplicate across the rows of a V-bottom plate such that the final volume is 60 µl/well (the \"serial dilution plate\"). The assay plate is washed three times with PBS-Tween in a plate washer (SkanWasher, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, California, USA) and blotted dry. PBS-Tween is obtained by adding 0.5 ml/\nL Tween\n 20 to 1X PBS. Fifty µl from each well of the serial dilution plate is transferred to the assay plate and incubated at 25°C for one hour. Secondary antibodies are diluted 1/2000 in diluent (PBS-BSA-Tween, which is PBS-Tween with 1 g/L BSA). The secondary antibody for rat monoclonal antibodies is goat anti-rat IgG (H+L) - HRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, Pennsylvania, USA). The secondary antibody for chimeric and humanized monoclonal antibodies is F(ab')\n2\n goat anti-human IgG Fcγ - HRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). The assay plate is washed as before. Diluted secondary antibodies (100 µl/well) are added to the appropriate wells in the assay plate, and the plate is incubated at 25°C for 45 minutes. The assay plate is washed as before. ABTS (100 µl/well) (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA) is added, and the plate is incubated at 25°C for 5-10 minutes, after which absorbance is read at 405 nm on a plate reader (Versamax, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, California, USA) with a 5 second shake before reading.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIndirect ELISA results for various forms of antibody 16C10 of the present invention are shown in Table 5. Binding is reported as an EC50 (the concentration of antibody necessary to obtain half-maximal signal). The results show that binding is detected with all forms of 16C10. Although such indirect ELISA assays are useful in quickly determining the presence or absence of anti-IL-17A antibodies, the EC50 numbers obtained may be assay-dependent and are typically not used to assess the absolute binding affinity for any given antibody.\n\n \nTABLE 5\n \n \n \nIndirect Anti-IL-17A Antibody ELISA\n \n \n \nmAb\n \nrhIL-17A (µg)\n \nEC50 (pM)\n \n \n \n \nrat 16C10\n \n0.025\n \n274\n \n \n \nchimeric 16C10\n \n0.025\n \n157\n \n \n \nhumanized 16C10 wt\n \n0.025\n \n212\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 6\n\n\nELISA of anti-IL-17A Monoclonal Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nBinding of anti-human-IL-17A monoclonal antibodies to rhIL-17A is assessed using an ELISA as follows. Briefly, a capture antibody is bound to the wells of a microtiter plate, after which a fixed concentration of rhIL-17A is added. The monoclonal anti-IL-17A to be assayed is then titrated versus the bound rhIL-17A on the plate to determine the concentration of antibody needed to achieve half-maximal binding. A more detailed protocol follows.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA 96-well microtiter plate is coated with 100 µl/well of capture antibody (rat anti-hIL-17A 12E6, 0.5 µg/ml) in carbonate coating buffer pH 9.5 (the \"assay plate\"). Plates are incubated covered at 4°C for 24 to 48 hours. The assay plate is washed three times in a plate washer (SkanWasher, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, California, USA) and blotted dry. The plate is then blocked with 200 µl/well of ELISA assay buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 0.15 M NaCl, pH7.4, 0.5% BSA, 0.05% Tween-20, 2mM EDTA) for one hour at 25°C on an orbital shaker. The plate is washed, and 100 µl/well of either adenovirus-derived rhIL-17A or \nE. coli\n-derived human IL-17 (IL-17A) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA)(0.1 µg/ml) is added in ELISA assay buffer and incubated for 2 hours at 25°C on an orbital shaker. The plate is washed and the monoclonal antibodies to be screened are serially diluted across a row of seven wells in the range of 1000 ng/ml to 0.0813 ng/ml using 4-fold serial dilutions. Plates are incubated for 1.5 hours at 25°C on an orbital shaker. Plates are washed and 100 µl/well secondary antibody (F(ab')\n2\n goat anti-human kappa light chain - HRP, 1:20,000 dilution, BioSource, Carlsbad, California, USA) is added, except for assay blank wells. Plates are washed twice (i.e. two cycles of 3 washes per cycle) with plate rotation between cycles. TMB substrate (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA) is added at 100 µl/well and incubated 3-5 minutes on an orbital shaker. Stop solution is added (100 µl/well) and the plate is read for absorbance at 450-570 nm on a plate reader (Versamax, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, California, USA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nELISA results for various forms of antibody 16C10 of the present invention are shown in Table 6.

(Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA), and was employed to measure the binding of rat anti-human IL-17A antibodies (and one chimeric antibody) to FLAG-huIL-17A. \nSee\n the Elecsys\n®\n immunoassay system, Roche Diagnostics (Indianapolis, Indiana, USA). Electrochemiluminescence technology uses a stable ruthenium metal chelate (Ori-TAG) which, in the presence of tripropylamine (TPA), generates electrochemiluminescence upon voltage application. Paramagnetic beads, microns in diameter, act as the solid phase and facilitate rapid assay kinetics. The bead/complex is channeled through a flow cell and captured at an electrode by magnetic application. Voltage is applied and resulting electrochemiluminescence is measured.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nECL assays were performed as follows. Three-fold serial dilutions of anti-human IL-17A mAbs in 50 µl of the assay buffer were made in a 96-well microtiter plate to give 1-3 µg/ml final concentration in the first well. Fifty µl of the assay buffer and 50 µl of biotinylated FLAG-huIL-17A at 50 ng/ml was added to each well, followed by the addition of either OriTag-labeled goat anti-rat IgG (H+L) pAb (50 µl at 450 ng/ml) or an anti-hIgG mAb (50 µl at 500 ng/ml). Finally 50 µl of Origen Streptavidin-Dynabeads at 0.1 mg/ml was added to each well. After 1 hr incubation at 25°C the plate was processed by the Origen M-series M8/384 analyzer. GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California, USA) was used to plot the data and calculate area under the curve, which is a rough measure of binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults are presented in Table 7 (which includes some duplicate determinations). The two rows showing binding of rat 16C10 to FLAG-huIL-17A represent duplicate determinations. All rat anti-human IL-17A antibodies in the table (1D10, 16C10, 30C10, 23E12) bound to FLAG-huIL-17A, as did the chimeric 16C10. All four antibodies also bound to cyno IL-17A. Antibodies 16C10 and 30C10 did not bind to mouse IL-17A under the conditions of this assay, whereas antibodies 1D10 and 23E12 did.\n\n \nTABLE 7\n \n \n \nAntibody Binding Determined by ECL\n \n \n \nmAb\n \nAntigen\n \nArea Under Peak\n \n \n \n \nrat 1D10\n \nFLAG-hu-IL-17A\n \n477474\n \n \n \nrat 16C10\n \nFLAG-hu-IL-17A\n \n285792\n \n \n \nrat 16C10\n \nFLAG-hu-IL-17A\n \n374445\n \n \n \nrat 30C10\n \nFLAG-hu-IL-17A\n \n311752\n \n \n \nrat 23E12\n \nFLAG-hu-IL-17A\n \n285145\n \n \n \nchimeric 16C10\n \nFLAG-hu-IL-17A\n \n345982\n \n \n \nrat 1D10\n \ncyno IL-17\n \n136497\n \n \n \nrat 16C10\n \ncyno IL-17\n \n151543\n \n \n \nrat 30C10\n \ncyno IL-17\n \n123916\n \n \n \nrat 23E12\n \ncyno IL-17\n \n111242\n \n \n \nrat 1D10\n \nmu IL-17\n \n252121\n \n \n \nrat 1D10\n \nmu IL-17\n \n384999\n \n \n \nrat 16C10\n \nmu IL-17\n \nno binding\n \n \n \nrat 16C10\n \nmu IL-17\n \nno binding\n \n \n \nrat 30C10\n \nmu IL-17\n \nno binding\n \n \n \nrat 30C10\n \nmu IL-17\n \nno binding\n \n \n \nrat 23E12\n \nmu IL-17\n \n143206\n \n \n \nrat 23E12\n \nmu IL-17\n \n289185\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\nDetermining the equilibrium dissociation constant (K\nd\n) for rat and humanized anti-human IL-17A antibodies using KinExA technology\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe equilibrium dissociation constants (K\nd\n) for anti human IL-17A antibodies were determined using the KinExA 3000 instrument (Sapidyne Instruments Inc., Boise, Idaho, USA). KinExA uses the principle of the Kinetic Exclusion Assay method based on measuring the concentration of uncomplexed antibody in a mixture of antibody, antigen and antibody-antigen complex. See, e.g., \nDarling and Brault (2004) Assay Drug Dev. Technol. 2(6):647-57\n. The concentration of free antibody is measured by exposing the mixture to a solid-phase immobilized antigen for a very brief period of time. In practice, this is accomplished by flowing the solution phase antigen-antibody mixture past antigen-coated particles trapped in a flow cell. Data generated by the instrument are analyzed using custom software. Equilibrium constants are calculated using a mathematical theory based on the following assumptions:\n\n \n \n \n1. The binding follows the reversible binding equation for equilibrium: \n \n \n \nk\n \non\n \n \n \nAb\n \n \n⁢\n \n \nAg\n \n \n=\n \n \nk\n \noff\n \n \n \nAbAg\n \n \n,\n \n \n \n \n\nwhere K\nd\n = k\noff\n / k\non\n \n \n2. Antibody (Ab) and antigen (Ag) bind 1:1 and total antibody equals antigen-antibody complex (AbAg) plus free antibody.\n \n3. Instrument signal is linearly related to free antibody concentration.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nKinExA analysis was performed on several rat anti-human IL-17A antibodies, humanized variants thereof, and sequence variants of these humanized antibodies. IL-17A was derived from either human (\"hu\"), cynomolgus monkey (\"cyno\"), or mouse (\"mu\"). IL-17A from the same species was used in both the immobilized and solution phases for each KinExA determination. Poly(methyl-methacrylate) (PMMA) particles (98 micron) were coated with human, cyno or mouse IL-17A according to Sapidyne \"Protocol for coating PMMA particles with biotinylated ligands having short or nonexistent linker arms.\" All experimental procedures were done according to the KinExA 3000 manual. All runs were done in duplicate. The conditions for KinExA are provided at Table 8.\n\n \nTABLE 8\n \n \n \nKinExA Conditions\n \n \n \n \nIL-17A:\n \nhuman, cyno\n \nmouse\n \n \n \nSample volume:\n \n2 \nml\n \n \n4 ml\n \n \n \nSample flow rate:\n \n0.25 ml/min\n \n0.25 ml/min\n \n \n \nLabel volume:\n \n1 \nml\n \n \n1 ml\n \n \n \nLabel flow rate:\n \n0.25 ml/min\n \n0.25 ml/min\n \n \n \nAntibody conc.:\n \n0.02 - 0.1 nM\n \n0.1 nM\n \n \n \nHighest antigen conc.:\n \n4nM\n \n64 nM (23E12)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4.0 nM (1D10)\n \n \n \nLowest antigen conc.:\n \n1 pM\n \n62 pM (23E12)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3.9 pM (1D10)\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo-fold serial dilutions of the antigen were prepared and mixed with the antibody at constant concentration.

Molar concentrations for the KinexA analysis were calculated on the basis of a molecular weight of 75 kDa for antibodies and 15 kDa for IL-17A to account for the presence of two binding sites on the antibodies and the dimeric nature of IL-17A. For some antibodies, replicate experiments were performed with different batches of antibody and/or antigen, in which cases mean values are provided in Table 9 along with standard errors. Binding constants for the humanized 16C10 wt antibody and the parental rat 16C10 antibody were similar at approximately 5-10 pM, showing that humanization did not significantly reduce the high affinity of the parental rat 16C10 for human IL-17A. Humanized 16C10 incorporating various amino acid substitutions (N54Q, M96A, M100hF), including the final humanized 16C10 antibody (having N54Q and M96A substitutions compared to rat 16C10) were also assayed and found to have similar, high binding constants in the 1-10 pM range. The Fab fragment of hu 16C10 bound retained high affinity (16 pM) compared with the complete antibody. Other antibodies of the present invention (rat 1D10, rat 23E12, rat 30C10) also bound with high affinity to FLAG-huIL-17A, and to cyno IL-17A. Although rat 1D10 bound to mouse with 10 pM affinity, similar to its affinity for human and cyno IL-17A, rat 23E12 had 200-2000 lower affinity for mouse IL-17A (7000 pM). Antibodies 16C10 and 30C10 did not bind to mouse IL-17A (data not shown).\n\n \nTABLE 9\n \n \n \nK\nd\n Values Determined by KinExA\n \n \n \nmAb\n \nAntigen\n \nKd (pM)\n \n \n \n \nrat 16C10\n \nrhIL-17A\n \n6.0\n \n \n \nrat 16C10\n \nFLAG-huIL-17A\n \n3.6\n \n \n \nhu 16C10 wt\n \nrhIL-17A\n \n8.8 ± 3.0\n \n \n \nhu 16C10 [= VH N54Q/M96A]\n \nrhIL-17A\n \n3.9 ± 2.7\n \n \n \nhu 16C10 Fab\n \nrhIL-17A\n \n16.1\n \n \n \nhu 16C10 VH N54A\n \nrhIL-17A\n \n10.8\n \n \n \nhu 16C10 VH N54Q\n \nrhIL-17A\n \n7.0\n \n \n \nhu 16C10 VH M96A\n \nrhIL-17A\n \n9.9\n \n \n \nhu 16C10 VH N54Q/M96A/M100hF\n \nrhIL-17A\n \n10.0\n \n \n \nrat 1D10\n \nFLAG-huIL-17A\n \n1.7\n \n \n \nrat 23E12\n \nFLAG-huIL-17A\n \n2.8\n \n \n \nrat 30C10\n \nFLAG-huIL-17A\n \n11.0\n \n \n \nrat 1D10\n \ncyno IL-17A\n \n9.8\n \n \n \nrat 23E12\n \ncyno IL-17A\n \n28.0\n \n \n \nrat 30C10\n \ncyno IL-17A\n \n32.6\n \n \n \nrat 16C10\n \ncyno IL-17A\n \n1.7\n \n \n \nhu 16C10\n \ncyno IL-17A\n \n16.3\n \n \n \nrat 1D10\n \nmu IL-17A\n \n10.3\n \n \n \nrat 23E12\n \nmu IL-17A\n \n7,000\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther methods known in the art, such as Biacore\n®\n surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy may be used to measure the affinity of antibodies of the present invention. Although Biacore\n®\n analysis was performed on several of the antibodies of the present invention, the binding affinity was generally too high to be measured accurately, specifically, the dissociation rate was too slow to be measured by this method. Such analysis may, however, be of use in the analysis of lower-affinity anti-IL-17A antibodies or anti-IL-17A antibodies having faster dissociation rate constants.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 8\n\n\nSynoviocyte Assay for Anti-IL-17A Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ability of the anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention to block the biological activity of IL-17A (either rhIL-17A or native huIL-17A) is measured by monitoring IL-17A-induced expression of IL-6 and IL-8 in primary culture of human synoviocytes, as follows. Synoviocytes are isolated by collagenase digestion of a rheumatoid arthritis synovium obtained from a knee replacement patient. Synoviocytes are enriched by continuous passage in Growth Medium (DMEM, 10%BCS, 1X Pen-Strep (50 IU/ml penicillin, 55 µg/ml streptomycin), 1X beta-mercaptoethanol (50 µM), 1X glutamine (20 mM), 25 mM HEPES), frozen down at passage number three, and stored in liquid nitrogen. When ready for use in an assay, a vial of the cells is thawed, plated, and the cells are allowed to grow to near confluence. The cells are then passaged 1:2 into larger flasks using typsin/EDTA. When sufficient cells have expanded, an experiment is initiated by trypsinizing the cells, plating into 96 well or 48 well plates, and allowing them to grow to total confluence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIL-17A is diluted to 120 ng/ml, i.e. 4X the final concentration of 30 ng/ml (1nM). IL-17A is either human (rhIL-17A and native huIL-17A) or from a non-human primate, in this case cynomolgus monkeys (cyno). 100 and 300 µl aliquots of the 4X IL-17A stocks are added to empty 96-well and 48-well plates, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-IL-17A antibodies to be assayed are diluted in Growth Medium to 4X the maximum concentration to be tested in an experiment. The 4X anti-IL-17A stock is serially diluted 1:2 to cover the dynamic inhibition range of the assay. Each of the serially diluted antibody samples (all are 4X their final concentration) are mixed 1:1 with the 4X IL-17A solutions in empty plates to generate mixtures with 2X concentrations of both IL-17A and anti-IL-17A antibodies. These mixtures are allowed to equilibrate at 37°C in a tissue culture incubator for more than four hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMedium is removed from the adherent confluent synoviocytes and replaced with 100 µl (96-well plate) or 200 µl (48-well plate) of Growth Medium. An equal volume of the 2X ligand/2X antibody solution is added to synoviocytes to give 1X IL-17A (30 ng/ml final) and 1X antibody. Each well (data point) is run in duplicate. Synoviocytes are activated (i.e. exposed to the IL-17A/antibody mixture) for three days, at which point supernatants are transferred to 96 well plates, and optionally frozen, and stored at -80°C until analyzed. Microtiter plates containing supernatants are thawed and each solution is diluted 1:10 using Growth Medium. Supernatants are analyzed for IL-6 and IL-8 using Luminex bead pairs (Upstate, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA) following manufacturer's instructions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults are provided at Tables 10 (IL-6) and 11 (IL-8). Values presented with error ranges represent the mean of multiple determinations with the standard deviation. Results for various forms of antibody 16C10 are shown, including a humanized form of 16C10 having the original rat CDRs (\"hu16C10 (wt)\") as well as several variants having one, two or three changes in the heavy chain CDRs (generally \"hu16C10 X##Z\", where X is the amino acid at residue ## in the heavy chain of hu16C10 (wt) and Z is the new amino acid). ''NHP IL-17A\" is non-human primate-derived IL-17A, in this case cynomolgus monkey IL-17A. \"Native huIL-17A\" refers to mature huIL-17A produced when the precursor protein is produced using the natural signal sequence, and differs from rhIL-17A by the absence of two N-terminal amino acids. Concentrations and IC50 values are expressed in ng/ml, but may be expressed in pM units as well. For example, 30 ng/ml rhIL-17A corresponds to 1000 pM (MW = 30 kDa) and 70 ng/ml anti-IL-17A antibody corresponds to approximately 470 pM (MW = 150 kDa).\n\n \nTABLE 10\n \n \n \nIC50 (ng/ml) of Anti-IL-17A Measured by Synoviocyte IL-6 Production\n \n \n \nAntibody\n \nrhIL-17A (30 ng/ml)\n \nNHP IL-17A (30 ng/ml)\n \nNative huIL-17A (10 ng/ml)\n \n \n \n \nrat 1D10\n \n105 ± 28\n \n65 ± 15\n \n25\n \n \n \nrat 16C10\n \n63 ± 7\n \n60 ± 10\n \n \n \n \n \nhu16C10 (wt)\n \n80 ± 10\n \n-\n \n \n \n \n \nhu16C10 (N54A)\n \n60\n \n-\n \n \n \n \n \nhu16C10 (N54Q)\n \n60\n \n-\n \n \n \n \n \nhu16C10 (M96A)\n \n60\n \n-\n \n \n \n \n \nhu 16C10 (M96K)\n \n60\n \n-\n \n \n \n \n \nhu16C10 (M100hF)\n \n70\n \n-\n \n \n \n \n \nhu16C10 (N54Q/M96A)\n \n70 ± 8\n \n70 ± 0\n \n25\n \n \n \nhu16C10 (N54Q/M96A/M100hF)\n \n70\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \nTABLE 11\n \n \n \nIC50 (ng/ml) of Anti-IL-17A Measured by Synoviocyte IL-8 Production\n \n \n \nAntibody\n \nrhIL-17A (30 ng/ml)\n \nNHP IL-17A (30 ng/ml)\n \nNative huIL-17A (10 ng/ml)\n \n \n \n \n1D10\n \n59 ± 41\n \n38 ± 13\n \n40\n \n \n \n16C10\n \n38 ± 14\n \n33 ± 8\n \n \n \n \n \nhu16C10 (wt)\n \n42 ± 16\n \n-\n \n \n \n \n \nhu16C10 (N54A)\n \n25\n \n-\n \n \n \n \n \nhu16C10 (N54Q)\n \n25\n \n-\n \n \n \n \n \nhu16C10 (M96A)\n \n25\n \n-\n \n \n \n \n \nhu16C10 (M96K)\n \n25\n \n-\n \n \n \n \n \nhu16C10 (M100hF)\n \n50\n \n-\n \n \n \n \n \nhu16C10 (N54Q/M96A)\n \n38 ± 10\n \n38 ± 13\n \n50\n \n \n \nhu16C10 (N54Q/M96A/M100hF)\n \n40\n \n-\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 9\n\n\nNHDF Assay for Anti-IL-17A Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ability of the anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention to block the biological activity of IL-17A is measured by monitoring rhIL-17A-induced expression of IL-6 in a normal human (adult) dermal fibroblast (NHDF) primary cell line.

A stock solution of rhIL-17A is prepared at 120 ng/ml. Seventy µl of the rhIL-17A stock solution is mixed with 70 µl of the anti-IL-17A antibody dilutions in wells of a microtiter plate and incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes. One hundred µl of each of these mixtures is then added to wells of a microtiter plate that had been seeded with 1 X 10\n4\n NHDF cells/well (100 µl) the previous night and allowed to incubate at 37°C. NHDF cells (passage 4) were obtained from Cambrex Bio Science (Baltimore, Maryland, USA). The resulting final concentration of rhIL-17A is 30 ng/ml (1 nM), and the antibodies range downward in two-fold intervals from 10 µg/ml. Plates are incubated at 37°C for 24 hours, followed by harvesting of the supernatant and removal of 50 µl for use in an IL-6 ELISA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ELISA for detection of human IL-6 is performed as follows. Reagents are generally from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA). An hIL-6 capture antibody (50 µl/well of a 4 µg/ml solution) is transferred to wells of a microtiter plate, which is sealed and incubated overnight at 4°C. The plate is washed three times, and then blocked with 100 µl/well of blocking buffer for 1 hour or more The plate is then washed again three times. Experimental samples (50 µl of the culture supernatant) and controls (serial dilutions of IL-6 protein) are added to the wells in 50 µl and incubated for two hours. Plates are washed three times, and 50 µl/well of a biotinylated anti-IL-6 detection antibody (300 ng/ml) is added. The plates are incubated at room temperature for two hours, washed three times, and 100 µl/well of streptavidin HRP is added and incubated for 20 minutes. The plate is washed again, ABTS (BioSource, Carlsbad, California, USA) is added (100 µl/well), and incubated for 20 minutes. Stop solution is added (100 µl/well) and the absorbance at 405nm is measured.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe IC50 for an anti-IL-17A antibody of interest is the concentration of antibody required to reduce the level of rhIL-17A-induced IL-6 production to 50% of the level observed in the absence of any added anti-IL-17A antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults arc provided at Table 12.\n\n \nTABLE 12\n \n \n \nAnti-IL-17A Antibody Inhibition of IL-6 Production in NHDF Cells\n \n \n \nAntibody\n \nrhIL-17A IC50 (nM)\n \ncyno IL-17A IC50 (nM)\n \n \n \n \nrat 4C3\n \n0.5\n \n0.2\n \n \n \nrat 16C10\n \n0.5\n \n0.2\n \n \n \nrat 30C10\n \n0.5\n \n0.2\n \n \n \nrat 6C3\n \n0.8\n \n0.2\n \n \n \n \nrat 1D10\n \n \n1\n \n0.4\n \n \n \n \nrat 8G9\n \n \n1\n \n0.4\n \n \n \n \nrat 12B12\n \n \n1\n \n0.4\n \n \n \n \nrat 18H6\n \n \n1\n \n0.3\n \n \n \n \n23E12\n \n \n1\n \n0.3\n \n \n \n29G3\n \n1.5\n \n2\n \n \n \n29H1\n \n1.5\n \n0.5\n \n \n \n12E6\n \n>70\n \n>70\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 10\n\n\nForeskin Fibroblast Assay Anti-IL-17A Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ability of the anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention to block the biological activity of IL-17A is measured by monitoring rhIL-17A-induced expression of EL-6 in HS68 foreskin fibroblast cell line. Reduced production of IL-6 in response to rhIL-17A is used as a measure of blocking activity by anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalysis of the expression ofIL-17RC (an IL-17A receptor) in a panel of fibroblast cell lines identified the human foreskin fibroblast cell line HS68 (ATCC CRL1635) as a potential IL-17A responsive cell line. This was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence staining with polyclonal goat anti-human IL-17R antibody (R&D Systems, Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA) followed by phycoerythrin (PE)-F(ab')\n2\n donkey anti-goat IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch, Inc., West Grove, Pennsylvania, USA), and analyzing the PE immunofluorescence signal on a flow cytometer (FACScan, Becton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, USA). As further validation of the model, IL-17A (both adenovirus-derived rhIL-17A and commercially available \nE. coli\n-derived IL-17A, R&D Systems) induced a dose-responsive induction of IL-6 in the HS68 cells with an EC50 of 5-10 ng/ml, which induction was blocked by pre-incubation with commercial polyclonal and monoclonal anti-IL-17A antibodies (R&D Systems).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe IL-17A inhibition assay is performed as follows. A confluent T-75 flask of HS68 cells (approximately 2 \nX\n 10\n6\n cells) is washed with Dulbecco's PBS without Ca++ and Mg++ and then incubated with 5 ml of cell dissociation medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA) for 2-5 minutes at 37°C in an incubator at 5% CO\n2\n. Cells are then harvested with 5 ml of tissue culture (TC) medium and centrifuged for 5 minutes at 1000 rpm. TC medium is Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (with glutamine), 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 10 mM Hepes, 1mM sodium pyruvate, penicillin, and streptomycin. Cells are resuspended in 2 ml TC medium, diluted 1:1 with trypan blue and counted. Cell concentrations are adjusted to 1 \nX\n 10\n5\n cells/ml in TC medium, and 0.1 ml/well is aliquoted into the wells of a flat-bottom plate containing 0.1 ml TC medium. Cells are grown overnight and the supernatant is aspirated and cells are washed with 0.2 ml of fresh TC medium.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-IL-17A antibodies to be assayed are serially diluted in two-fold or 3-fold steps to give a series of stock solutions that can be used to create final antibody concentrations of 1 to 0.001 µg/ml in the IL-17A inhibition assay. A rat IgG control is used in each assay, as well as media-only samples, as controls to measure spontaneous IL-6 production in HS68 cells. The TC medium is aspirated from the wells of the plate containing the HS68 cells. Aliquots of the various concentrations of anti-IL-17A antibody (0.1 ml of each) are pre-incubated in the wells with the HS68 cells 37°C for 5 minutes prior to addition of 0.1 ml of 20 ng/ml rhIL-17A, to give a final concentration of rhIL-17A of 10 ng/ml (approximately 330 pM of IL-17A dimer). Cells are incubated 24 hours at 37°C, and supernatants (50 -100 µl) are harvested and assayed for IL-6, for example using a human IL-6 ELISA kit from Pharmingen (OptEIA - BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, USA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults for several rat anti-human IL-17A antibodies of the present invention in the foreskin fibroblast IL-17A inhibition assay are provided at Table 13.\n\n \nTABLE 13\n \n \n \nForeskin Fibroblast Assay\n \n \n \n \nanti-IL-17A antibody\n \nIC50 (pM)\n \n \n \nrat 16C10\n \n67\n \n \n \nrat 1D10\n \n65\n \n \n \nrat 8G9\n \n29\n \n \n \nrat 29H1\n \n247\n \n \n \nrat 29G3\n \n63\n \n \n \nrat 23E12\n \n126\n \n \n \nrat 6C3\n \n192\n \n \n \nrat 4C2\n \n107\n \n \n \nrat IgG1\n \nno binding\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 11\n\n\nBa/F3-hIL-17Rc-mGCSFR Proliferation Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ability of the anti-1L-17A antibodies of the present invention to block the biological activity of IL-17A is measured by monitoring rhIL-17A-induced proliferation of a cell line engineered to proliferate in response to IL-17A stimulation. Specifically, the Ba/F3 cell line (IL-3 dependent murine pro-B cells) was modified to express a fusion protein comprising the extracellular domain of a human IL-17A receptor (hIL-17RC) fused to the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic region of mouse granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (GCSFR). The resulting cell line is referred to herein as Ba/F3 hIL-17Rc-mGCSFR. Binding of homodimeric IL-17A to the extracellular IL-17RC domains causes dimerization of the hIL-17Rc-mGCFR fusion protein receptor, which signals proliferation of the Ba/F3 cells via their mGCSFR cytoplasmic domains. Such cells proliferate in response to IL-17A, providing a convenient assay for IL-17A inhibitors, such as anti-IL-17A antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe sensitivity of the Ba/F3-hIL-17Rc-mGCSFR proliferation assay to IL-17A stimulation makes it possible to perform experiments at relatively low concentrations of rhIL-17A (e.g. 3 ng/ml, 100 pM) compared with other assays, while still maintaining a robust and readily measurable proliferative response. This means that lower concentrations of anti-IL-17A antibodies are required to achieve a molar excess over rhIL-17A in the assay. Experiments performed at lower antibody concentrations make it possible to discriminate between high affinity antibodies that might otherwise be indistinguishable (i.e. experiments can be performed closer to the linear range in the antibody-IL-17A binding curve, rather than in the plateau).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies and IL-17A were filtered through 0.22 µm filters after dilution to working stock concentrations but prior to addition to experimental samples. Four sets of samples were prepared, in duplicate, across rows of a 96-well flat bottom tissue culture plates. As used in this Example, Growth Medium is RPMI 1640 w/Glutamax (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA), 55 µM 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% formula fed Bovine Calf Serum (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, California, USA), 50 µg/mL gentamicin, 2 µg/mL puromycin, and 10 ng/mL mIL-3 BioAssay Medium is the same as Growth Medium but without puromycin and mIL-3. All serial dilutions in this Example were made into BioAssay Medium.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following experimental samples (75 µl) were prepared: 1) a serial dilution of Growth Medium (including 10 ng/ml mIL-3); 2) a serial dilution of rhIL-17A; 3) a serial dilution of anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention mixed with 3 ng/ml IL-17A (final concentration after cells were added), including a \"no antibody\" control; and 4) a \"cells only\" control with no added antibodies, IL-17A or mIL-3. Ba/F3 hIL-17Rc-mGCSFR cells (7500 cells/well) were then added to bring the total volume to 100 µl/well, and the plates were incubated at 37°C / 5% CO\n2\n for approximately 40 hours. AlamarBlue\n®\n indicator dye (11 µl/well) was added and the plates were incubated at 37°C / 5% CO\n2\n for 6-8 hours. Plates were then read for the difference in absorbance at 570 nm and 600 nm. IC50 values were determined using nonlinear fit / sigmoidal dose-response / variable slope.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results of the Ba/F3 hIL-17Rc-mGCSFR proliferation assay are provided at Table 14.\n\n \nTABLE 14\n \n \n \n \nBa/F3 hIL-17Rc-mGCSFR Proliferation Assay\n \n \n \nmAb\n \nIL-17A\n \n[rhIL-17A] (pM)\n \nIC50 (pM)\n \n \n \n \nrat 16C10\n \nhuman\n \n100\n \n20 ± 8\n \n \n \nrat 16C10\n \nhuman\n \n276\n \n162\n \n \n \nrat 16C10\n \n \ncyno\n \n \n100\n \n27\n \n \n \nchimeric 16C10\n \nhuman\n \n100\n \n29\n \n \n \nhu 16C10\n \nhuman\n \n100\n \n15 ± 2\n \n \n \nhu 16C10 VH N54Q/M96A\n \nhuman\n \n100\n \n13\n \n \n \nhu 16C10\n \nhuman\n \n100\n \n27\n \n \n \nhu 16C10\n \nhuman\n \n276\n \n149\n \n \n \nhu 16C10\n \ncyno\n \n100\n \n17\n \n \n \nhu 16C10 N54Q/M96A/M100hF\n \nhuman\n \n100\n \n11\n \n \n \nrat 1D10\n \nhuman\n \n276\n \n223\n \n \n \n \nrat 1D10\n \n \ncyno\n \n \n \n100\n \n19\n \n \n \nrat 29H1\n \nhuman\n \n28\n \n≥30\n \n \n \nrat 4H12\n \nhuman\n \n28\n \n≥400\n \n \n \nrat 29G3\n \nhuman\n \n28\n \n≥400\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 12\n\n\nCross-Blocking of Anti-IL-17A Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nDifferent anti-IL-17A antibodies of the invention may bind to the same epitope, epitopes that overlap, or epitopes that do not overlap, including epitopes that are sufficiently distinct that two or more antibodies can bind to one IL-17A monomer simultaneously. Antibodies that bind to portions of IL-17A critical to receptor binding will block the receptor-mediated biological activity of IL-17A. Such antibodies are referred to herein as \"neutralizing antibodies.\" Antibodies that bind but do not block receptor binding are referred to as non-neutralizing antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen performing experiments on IL-17A and anti-IL-17A antibodies it is useful to be able to determine the level of IL-17A (or anti-IL-17A) in a sample, such as by a sandwich ELISA. See, e.g., Example 6. In one format, an IL-17A ELISA involves coating the wells of a microtiter plate with a capture antibody, addition of an experimental sample possibly containing IL-17A, and binding of a detection antibody. The capture antibody and the detection antibody must be able to bind IL-17A at the same time.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA similar assay may be used to determine the level of an anti-IL-17A antibody, wherein a standard solution of IL-17A is bound to the wells coated with capture antibody, followed by addition of a an experimental sample possibly containing an anti-IL-17A antibody, and binding of a secondary detection antibody (e.g. an anti-human IgG antibody in the case of IgG humanized antibodies of the present invention). As in the IL-17A sandwich ELISA, the capture antibody cannot interfere with binding of the antibody to be assayed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred pairs of antibodies for use in the ELISA experiments outlined in this Example can be determined by performing cross-blocking experiments. In cross blocking experiments, a first antibody is coated onto the wells of a microtiter plate. A biotinylated second antibody is then mixed with IL-17A and allowed to bind, after which the mixture is added to the coated well and incubated. The biotinylated second antibody may be added at various concentrations (i.e. titrated) to ensure that in at least some samples the antibody is present at a two-fold (or greater) molar excess over homodimeric IL-17A. The plate is then washed and the presence or absence of the biotinylated second antibody bound in the well is determined by standard methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf the two antibodies cross-block there will be a reduction of signal (IL-17A binding) to the plate in the presence of the second anti-IL-17A antibody compared with control samples containing no second anti-IL-17A antibody (or containing an isotype control). Pairs of antibodies that do not cross-block can be used together in assays, such as sandwich ELISAs. Although the dimeric nature of IL-17A makes it possible to use pairs of cross-blocking antibodies in ELISAs in certain formats (e.g. where IL-17A is bound to the capture antibody on the plate prior to addition of the detection antibody), non-cross-blocking pairs of antibodies are generally preferable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention (clones 4C3, 6C3, 8G9, 12E6, 16C10, 18H6, 23E12, 29H1, 30C10, 1D10, 21B12, 29G3) were tested pairwise for cross-blocking. All pairs cross-blocked with the exception of 29G3 / 1D10 and 29G3 / 21B12, which pairs of antibodies could therefore be used in ELISAs. In addition to identifying pairs of anti-IL-17A antibodies that can be used in an ELISA, these results show that the epitope bound by antibody 29G3 is functionally or physically distinct from the epitope or epitopes bound by antibodies 1D10 and 21B12. These data also demonstrated that the epitopes for 1D10 and 21B12 overlap with, but are not identical to, the epitope for 16C10.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch pairs of anti-IL-17A antibodies that bind to functionally distinct epitopes are useful, e.g., in validating anti-IL-17A immunohistochemistry (IHC). For example, if a tissue sample exhibits the same pattern of IL-17A expression in IHC performed with two different anti-IL-17A antibodies that bind to functionally distinct epitopes then it is even more likely that the assay is detecting IL-17A, rather than some other spurious cross-reacting protein in the tissue sample.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch pairs of non-cross-blocking antibodies are also useful in designing ELISAs for detection of IL-17A in the presence of therapeutic anti-IL-17A antibodies, e.g. in samples from patients undergoing anti-IL-17A antibody therapy, in which the presence of an excess of the therapeutic anti-IL-17A antibody would block detection by anti-IL-17A ELISA unless the ELISA antibodies were non-cross-blocking with the therapeutic antibody.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 13\n\n\nGene Therapy with Anti-IL-17A Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nThe anti-IL-17A antibodies of the invention may also be administered to a subject by gene therapy. In a gene therapy approach, the cells of a subject are transformed with nucleic acids that encode the antibodies of the invention. Subjects comprising the nucleic acids will then produce the antibody molecules (intrabodies) endogenously. For example, Alvarez \net al.\n introduced single-chain anti-ErbB2 antibodies to subjects using a gene therapy approach. \nAlvarez et al. (2000) Clinical Cancer Research 6:3081-3087\n. The methods disclosed by Alvarez \net al.\n may be easily adapted for the introduction of nucleic acids encoding an anti- IL-17A antibody molecule of the present invention to a subject. In one embodiment, the antibody molecule introduced by gene therapy is a fully human, single-chain antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe gene therapy approach described herein has the potential advantage that treatment need only be carried out once, or at most a limited number of times, provided that long-term gene expression is achieved. This is contrasted with antibody administration, which must be repeated periodically to maintain proper therapeutic levels in the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nucleic acids may be introduced to the cells of a subject by any means known in the art. In some embodiments, the nucleic acids are introduced as part of a viral vector. Examples of viruses from which the vectors may be derived include lentiviruses, herpes viruses, adenoviruses, adeno-associated viruses (AAV), vaccinia virus, baculovirus, alphavirus, influenza virus, and other recombinant viruses with desirable cellular tropism. Various companies produce viral vectors commercially, for example Avigen, Inc. (Alameda, CA; AAV vectors); Cell Genesys (Foster City, CA; retroviral, adenoviral, AAV vectors, and lentiviral vectors); Clontech (retroviral and baculoviral vectors); Genovo, Inc. (Sharon Hill, PA; adenoviral and AAV vectors); Genvec (adenoviral vectors); IntroGene (Leiden, Netherlands; adenoviral vectors); Molecular Medicine (retroviral, adenoviral, AAV, and herpes viral vectors); Norgen (adenoviral vectors); Oxford BioMedica (Oxford, United Kingdom; lentiviral vectors); and Transgene (Strasbourg, France; adenoviral, vaccinia, retroviral, and lentiviral vectors).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods of constructing and using viral vectors are known in the art (see, \ne.g.\n, \nMiller et al. (1992) BioTechniques 7:980-990\n). Preferably, the viral vectors are replication defective (unable to replicate autonomously) and thus not infectious in the target cell. Preferably, the replication defective virus is a minimal virus retaining only the sequences of its genome that are necessary for encapsidating the genome to produce viral particles. Defective viruses that entirely or almost entirely lack viral genes are most preferred. Use of defective viral vectors allows for administration to cells in a specific localized area without concern that the vector can infect other cells, enabling tissue-specific targeting. See, e.g., \nKanno et al. (1999) Cancer Gen. Ther. 6:147-154\n; \nKaplitt et al. (1997) J. Neurosci. Meth. 71:125-132\n; and \nKaplitt et al. (1994) J. Neuro-Onc. 19:137-142\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdenoviruses are eukaryotic DNA viruses that can be modified to efficiently deliver a nucleic acid of the invention to a variety of cell types. Attenuated adenovirus vectors, such as the vector described by \nStratford-Perricaudet et al. (1992) (J. Clin. Invest. 90:626-630\n) are desirable in some instances. Various replication defective adenovirus and minimal adenovirus vectors have been described (\n \nPCT Publication Nos. WO94/26914\n \n, \n \nWO94/28938\n \n, \n \nWO94/28152\n \n, \n \nWO94/12649\n \n, \n \nWO95/02697\n \n and \n \nWO96/22378\n \n). The replication defective recombinant adenoviruses of the present invention can be prepared by any technique known to a person skilled in the art (see \nLevrero et al. (1991) Gene 101:195\n; \n \nEP 185573\n \n; \nGraham (1984) EMBO J. 3:2917\n; \nGraham et al. (1977) J. Gen. Virol. 36:59\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdcno-associated viruses (AAV) are DNA viruses of relatively small size that can integrate, in a stable and site-specific manner, into the genome of the cells that they infect. They are able to infect a wide spectrum of cells without inducing any effects on cellular growth, morphology or differentiation, and they do not appear to be involved in human pathologies. The use of AAV-derived vectors for transferring genes \nin vitro\n and \nin vivo\n has been described (see \nDonsante et al. (2001) Gene Ther. 8:1343-1346\n; \nLarson et al. (2001) Adv. Exp. Med.

Retroviruses are integrating viruses that infect dividing cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLentivral vectors can be used as agents for the direct delivery and sustained expression of nucleic acids encoding an antibody molecule of the invention in several tissue types, including brain, retina, muscle, liver and blood. The vectors can efficiently transduce dividing and nondividing cells in these tissues, and maintain long-term expression of the antibody molecule. For a review, see \nZufferey et al. (1998) J. Virol. 72:9873-80\n and \nKafri et al. (2001) Curr. Opin. Mol. Ther. 3:316-326\n. Lentiviral packaging cell lines are available and known generally in the art, facilitating the production of high-titer lentivirus vectors for gene therapy. An example is a tetracycline-inducible VSV-G pseudotyped lentivirus packaging cell line which can generate virus particles at titers greater than 10\n6\n IU/ml for at least 3 to 4 days; see \nKafri et al. (1999) J. Virol. 73: 576-584\n. The vector produced by the inducible cell line can be concentrated as needed for efficiently transducing nondividing cells \nin vitro\n and \nin vivo.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nSindbis virus is a member of the alphavirus genus that has been studied extensively since its discovery in various parts of the world beginning in 1953. Gene transduction based on alphavirus, particularly Sindbis virus, has been well-studied \nin vitro\n (see \nStraus et al. (1994) Microbiol. Rev. 58:491-562\n; \nBredenbeek et al. (1993) J. Virol. 67; 6439-6446\n; \nIijima et al. (1999) Int. J. Cancer 80:110-118\n; and \nSawai et al. (1998) Biochim. Biophys. Res. Comm. 248:315-323\n). Many properties of alphavirus vectors make them a desirable alternative to other virus-derived vector systems being developed, including rapid engineering of expression constructs, production of high-titered stocks of infectious particles, infection of nondividing cells, and high levels of expression (\nStrauss et al. (1994) Microbiol. Rev. 58:491-562\n). Use of Sindbis virus for gene therapy has been described. (\nWahlfors et al. (2000) Gene. Ther. 7:472-480\n.and \nLundstrom (1999) J. Recep. Sig. Transduct. Res. 19(1-4):673-686\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, a vector can be introduced to cells by lipofection or with other transfection facilitating agents (peptides, polymers, \netc.\n). Synthetic cationic lipids can be used to prepare liposomes for \nin vivo\n and \nin vitro\n transfection of a gene encoding a marker (\nFelgner et al. (1987) Proc. Nat'l. Acad Sci. USA 84:7413-7417\n and \nWang et al. (1987) Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA 84:7851-7855\n).

Nephrol. 20(2):118-24\n \n.\n \n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 14\n\n\nCassette Mutagenesis of CDRs of Parental Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nOptimization of the CDR sequences of anti-human IL-17A antibodies of the present invention (e.g. 16C10) is performed using shotgun scanning mutagenesis. Alanine scanning mutagenesis is used to determine which residues within the CDRs are most critical to IL-17A binding (see Example 19). The codon for one or more residues within one or more CDRs is replaced with an alanine codon, or an alanine codon is replace with a glycine codon, and the resulting antibody is tested for a relevant activity (e.g. IL-17A binding affinity, IC50 for receptor blocking in a competition assay, bioassay, as provided in various other Examples herein). Codon substitution may be performed by any method known in the art, including but not limited to site-directed mutagenesis (e.g. \nKunkel, Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA (1985) 82:488\n) and PCR mutagenesis. Residues crucial to IL-17A binding may also be determined by inspection of the structure of an IL-17A-antibody complex, e.g. an X-ray crystal structure. Antibody CDR residues within contact distance of IL-17A, or which are substantially buried in formation of the IL-17A-antibody complex, are candidates for further optimization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThose residues with the greatest sensitivity to mutation are then studied further, for example by homolog scanning mutagenesis. In this embodiment, conservative amino acid substitutions with homologous amino acids are performed at the target residues to search for antibodies with superior qualities. Non-conservative mutations are also possible, albeit at the risk of disrupting IL-17A binding altogether.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, improved antibody sequences may be generated using affinity maturation, in which selected residues in a CDR are mutated to generate all possible amino acid substitutions at that position. In another embodiment, fewer than all 20 possible natural amino acids are used as substitutions to reduce the number of potential sequences to more manageable levels, while still providing for chemical diversity at each position using a limited number of amino acids selected to be optimally diverse (e.g. representative hydrophobic, polar-uncharged, basic and acidic amino acids), as in \n \nWO2005/044853\n \n. Such affinity maturation can be performed by substitution with any number of amino acids at a position of interest, including 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, or even more if non-standard or modified amino acids are included.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 15\n\n\nCross-Reactivity with Human Tissue\n\n\n \n \n \nThe propensity of humanized anti-human IL-17A antibody hu16C10 to cross-reactivity with non-target tissues in human subjects was assessed as follows. hu16C10 was preincubated with a biotinylated secondary antibody to form a pre-complex prior to exposure to tissue samples. Antibody complexes (with 20 µg/ml of antibody) were then mixed with a tissue or other sample and incubated to allow binding. Bound secondary antibodies were then detected using ABC immunoperoxidase detection (Vector Labs, Burlingame, California, USA). \nTuson et al. (1990) J. Histochem Cytochem.38(7):923-6\n. A sample with an unrelated human IgGl antibody was included as a negative control.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmunohistochemical (IHC) staining was performed with hu16C10 against several positive control target tissues including rhIL-17A protein spots on UV-resin slides (Adhesive Coated Slides, Instrumedics, Inc., St. Louis, Missouri, USA), mouse liver cells infected with an adenovirus-encoding IL-17A, and human rheumatoid arthritis tissue. IHC revealed binding (+++) in all three positive controls.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIHC was then performed against a panel of human tissues (32 in all) to assess cross-reactivity. All these human tissue samples were mounted on UV-resin slides. Samples were obtained from three donors for each tissue. The human tissues screened were adrenal gland, bladder, cerebellum, cerebral cortex, colon, fallopian tube, cardiac muscle, kidney, liver, lung, lymph node, mammary gland, ovary, pancreas, parathyroid, pituitary gland, placenta, prostate, retina, skeletal muscle, skin, small intestine, spinal cord, spleen, stomach, testis, thymus, thyroid gland, ureter, uterus, and cervix (uterus). IHC was negative in all 32 tissues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis lack of cross-reactivity has several potential benefits in therapeutic uses of the anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention, such as reducing the loss of antibody due to non-specific binding to other tissues (with consequent reduction in therapeutic effect), and reducing the likelihood of adverse effects associated with binding to undesired tissues.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 16\n\n\n \n \n \nTreatment of Collagen-Induced Arthritis Using Anti-IL-17A Antibodies Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) is a widely accepted mouse model for rheumatoid arthritis in humans. Anti-IL-17A antibody 1D10 of the present invention (the parental rat antibody, rather than a humanized forms thereof) is administered to mice expressing CIA to assess the ability of anti-IL-17A therapy to treat rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe procedure was as follows. On \nDay\n 0 male B 10.RIII mice were immunized intradermally at the tail base with bovine type II collagen emulsified in Complete Freund's Adjuvant. On Day 21 mice were challenged intradermally with bovine type II collagen emulsified in Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant delivered at the tail base. When the first sign of severe arthritis in the immunized group occurred (post-Day 21), all remaining immunized mice were randomized to the various treatment groups. Animals were treated with either 800 µg, 200 µg, or 50 µg of anti-IL-17A antibody 1D10; 200 µg isotype control antibody; or diluent. Treatments were given subcutaneously on the first day of disease onset in the immunized mice, and then weekly four more times. Mice were sacrificed at day 35 and paws were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin for tissue processing and sectioning. Paws were analyzed by a pathologist for the following histopathology parameters: reactive synovium, inflammation, pannus formation, cartilage destruction, bone erosion, and bone formation. Each parameter was graded using the following disease scale: 0 = no disease; 1 = minimal, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe. In addition paws were assessed using visual disease severity score (DSS), which measures swelling and redness on a scale of 0 to 3, with 0 being a normal paw, 1 being inflammation of one finger on the paw, 2 being inflammation of two fingers or the palm of that paw, and 3 being inflammation of the palm and finger(s) of the paw. Scores of 2 and 3 are referred to herein as severely or highly inflamed paws.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults are presented at \nFigs. 3A - 3C\n. Each data point represents one paw, rather than an average for all four paws for an animal or an average over all animals. Reduction in the number of paws showing high pathology scores was statistically significant by three measures of pathology (visual DSS - paw swelling and redness, cartilage damage and bone erosion) with higher anti-IL-17A 1D10 concentrations tested (28 and 7 mg/kg). Results with the lowest concentration (2 mg/kg) were statistically significant for bone erosion and reduced for visual DSS and cartilage damage. Similar benefits were observed in reduction of production of cartilage degradative enzymes within inflamed paws (matrix metalloproteases MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-13).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVisual evaluation of paw inflammation, however, may underestimate the therapeutic benefit of anti-IL-17A treatment of CIA mice, e.g. decreased bone erosion. In other experiments, highly inflamed paws (DSS scores of 2 or 3) from CIA mice were analyzed for bone erosion using histopathology or micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). This study was possible because even though anti-IL-17A-treated animals had drastically reduced percentages of highly inflamed paws (see, e.g., \nFIG. 3A\n), there remained a number of highly inflamed paws, and it was possible to compare highly inflamed paws (DSS = 2 or 3) from all treatment groups, including the no-antibody controls. \nFIG. 3D\n shows a plot of bone erosion for highly inflamed paws from diluent treated, isotype control (rIgG1) treated, and anti-IL-17A antibody treated animals. Bone erosion, as measured by histopathology, was significantly reduced in paws from animals treated with anti-IL-17A when compared with no-antibody controls, despite their similar DSS scores. The results suggest that sparing of bone erosion may be achieved with anti-IL-17A treatment even in paws where there is no apparent improvement in inflammation as measured by DSS score.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilar results were obtained when micro-CT was used to measure bone mineral density (BMD) for joints in highly inflamed paws in CIA mice. Table 15 provides BMD for paws with disease severity scores of 0 or 3 from CIA animals treated with either an anti-IL-17A antibody of the present invention (1D10) or an isotype control (25D2). Even for joints with the same visual disease severity, 1D10 antibody treated had only approximately half the decrease in bone mineral density observed with isotype control treated animals.\n\n \nTABLE 15\n \n \n \nBone Density for Joints in CIA Mice\n \n \n \nTreatment\n \nDSS\n \nBMD (mg/cc)\n \n \n \n \n \n25D2\n \n \n3\n \n95\n \n \n \n \n25D2\n \n \n3\n \n108\n \n \n \n \n1D10\n \n \n3\n \n288\n \n \n \n \n1D10\n \n \n3\n \n299\n \n \n \n \n1D10\n \n \n0\n \n502\n \n \n \n \n1D10\n \n \n0\n \n480\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs with bone erosion, cartilage destruction and pannus formation (proliferation of the synovial lining forming excessive folds of inflamed tissue) were also reduced in anti-hIL-17A (1D10)-treated CIA mice. Histopathology showed that anti-IL-17A antibody treatment not only reduced the number of paws showing severe pathology, but also reduced pathology in paws that appeared equally inflamed based on visual inspection (DSS scores of 2 and 3) when compared with diluent or isotype treated controls.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe observation that treatment with anti-IL-17A antibodies significantly reduced bone erosion in the CIA model of joint inflammation suggests that such therapy may be useful in preventing one of the most debilitating and irreversible effects of RA in humans. In addition, the observation that bone erosion is reduced even in highly inflamed paws suggests that simple visual assessment of joint inflammation may not accurately measure therapeutic efficacy in the lab, or ultimately in the clinic. Measurement of bone erosion may be necessary to track the effects of therapeutic treatments. Such methods include, but are not limited to, standard 2-D X-ray detection, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound (US), and scintigraphy. See, e.g., \nGuermazi et al.

Radiol. 8(4):269-285\n.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 17\n\n\nBAL Neutrophil Recruitment Assay of Anti-IL-17A Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ability of anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention to block the activity of IL-17A \nin vivo\n was assessed in a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) neutrophil recruitment assay. Briefly, at day -4, five week old female BALB/cAnN mice (Taconic Farms, Germantown, New York, USA) were treated with anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention, or an isotype control, by subcutaneous injection of 0, 10, 30, 40, 60, or 100 µg of antibody per mouse. At day -1 the mice were stimulated by nasal administration of 1 µg of rhIL-17A in 50 µl of PBS (or a PBS only control) under light isoflurane anesthesia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt \nday\n 0 the level of neutrophils present in BAL fluid was determined as follows. Mice were euthanized with CO\n2\n and blood samples were collected, from which the concentration of anti-IL-17A antibody was determined. A needle was inserted into the upper cervical trachea through a tracheotomy and BAL fluid was collected by introduction and removal of 0.3 ml of PBS three times. The BAL fluid was centrifuged (400 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C) and the cell pellet was resuspended in PBS. Total cell counts were determined in a hemocytometer using trypan blue solution. Differential cell counts were performed on cytospin preparations by Wright-Giemsa staining (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA), according to standard morphologic criteria with use of oil immersion microscopy (original magnification x 1000). Cell counts were carried out on 200 or 300 cells (lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils) to determine the percent BAL neutrophil.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults are provided at \nFIG. 4\n. Data are provided for three anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention (1D10, 16C10 and 4C3), as well as controls. The percentage of neutrophils in BAL fluid as a percentage of all leukocytes for individual experimental animals is plotted as a function of serum antibody concentration, with the left segment of the abscissa (\"0\" to \"1\") representing controls, as indicated in the legend. The controls show that rhIL-17A stimulus induces significant neutrophil recruitment that is not reduced by administration of an isotype control antibody (dosed at the same levels as the anti-IL-17A antibodies). In contrast, the anti-IL-17A data show a dose-dependent reduction in rhIL-17A-induced neutrophil recruitment, with neutrophil recruitment essentially blocked at serum antibody concentrations above 40-60 µg/ml.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 18\n\n\nTreatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) Using Anti-IL-17A Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nHuman subjects diagnosed with RA who have had an inadequate response to one or more DMARDs are selected for treatment with a humanized anti-IL-17A antibody of the present invention. Subjects are maintained on methotrexate (10 mg/week), and are optionally treated with prednisone for two weeks. Subjects are also dosed monthly with 50 or 100 mg of anti-IL-17A antibody, administered subcutaneously. Doses are adjusted for specific subjects according to standard clinical criteria and on the basis of clinical response.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResponse to treatment is assessed by determining the ACR score, which is based on criteria developed by the American College of Rheumatology. The ACR score is a composite score that integrates multiple clinical parameters and radiographic scores, such as reduction in the number of swollen and tender joints, patient global assessment, physician global assessment, pain scale, self-assessed disability, and acute phase reactants (erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein). \nSee\n \nFelson et al. (1995) Arthritis & Rheumatology 38; 727-735\n. A subject is considered to have improved if he or she exhibits a score of ACR20 or higher at week 24 or treatment. In addition, the proportion of subjects achieving various ACR scores (e.g. ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70) can be used to compare treatment and placebo groups in clinical trials to assess the clinical efficacy of the humanized anti-IL-17A antibody of the present invention\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 19\n\n\nEpitope Determination\n\n\n \n \n \nAmino acid residues critical to binding of the antibodies of the present invention, e.g. rat 16C10, were determined a follows.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA first set of experiments was based on the observation that rat antibody 16C10 was able to bind human IL-17A (hIL-17A) but was unable to bind mouse IL-17A (mIL-17A) or related cytokine human IL-17F. Each of these three proteins was linked to an N-terminal FLAG\n®\n peptide tag (see \nresidues\n 1 to 9 of SEQ ID NO.: 42). In order to identify amino acid residues critical for 16C10 binding, various peptide subsequences of FLAG-tagged hIL-17A, mIL-17A and IL-17F were combined by mixing restriction fragments of the relevant genes to form hybrid polypeptides. Binding of these hybrid polypeptides to antibody 16C10 was determined in an Amplified Luminescent Proximity Homogeneous Assay (AlphaScreen, Packard BloScience, Wellesley, Massachusetts, USA) to determine which segments of hIL-17A were critical to binding. Biotinylated antibody 16C10 was bound to streptavidin donor beads, and hybrid polypeptides were bound to acceptor beads having anti-FLAG\n®\n antibodies (Packard BioScience). Donor and acceptor beads were mixed, illuminated at 680nm, and emission was measured at 520-620nm. Binding was measured as enhanced fluorescence in samples containing hybrid polypeptides that bound to antibody 16C10 because acceptor beads were held in close proximity to donor beads and emitted light when singlet oxygen from the exited donor bead diffused to the acceptor bead.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results showed that antibody 16C10 binds to hybrid polypeptides comprising amino acid residues 50-132, 63-132, 1-87, 1-112 and 63-87 from hIL-17A, demonstrating that residues critical to 16C10 binding are present in residues 63-87 of hIL-17A (PSVIVVEAKCR HLGCINADG NVDYHM). All residue numbering in this example is with reference to the sequence of hIL-17A (SEQ ID NO.: 40). For example, mIL-17A and IL-17F polypeptides substituted with residues 63-87 of hIL-17A were able to bind antibody 16C10, whereas the intact mIL-17A and IL-17F were not.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPoint mutations were also introduced into hIL-17A to determine which amino acid residues were critical to antibody 16C10 binding. In one experiment, alanine-scanning mutagenesis was performed in which an alanine codon was introduced in place of the native amino acid at several residues (45, 46, 51, 52, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 60, 61, 62, 67, 68, 70, 72, 73, 78, 80, 82, 84, 85, 86, 88, 93, 94, 95, 100, 101, 102, 105, 108, 110, 111, 113, 114). Mammalian expression plasmids with genes encoding the mutant forms of hIL-17A were transiently transfected into human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells. The supernatants were analyzed for FLAG\n®\n peptide tag quantification and for antibody 16C10 binding by AlphaScreen, as described \nsupra.\n None of the single amino acid alanine substitutions significantly reduced binding of antibody 16C10. Other point mutations were made in which human IL-17F or mouse IL-17A residues were substituted at various positions within the 63-87 fragment, i.e. L74Q, G75R, V83E, Y85H. Although none of these individual point mutations inhibited antibody 16C10 binding, an hIL-17A.having all four changes exhibited substantially decreased binding, confirming that residues in the 63-87 fragment of hIL-17A, and more specifically residues in the 74-85 fragment (LGCINADGNVDY), are important for 16C10 binding.\n\n \nTABLE 16\n \n \n \nSequence Identifiers\n \n \n \nSEQ ID NO:\n \nDescription\n \n \n \n \n1\n \nhu 16C10 light chain DNA with signal sequence\n \n \n \n2\n \nhu 16C10 light chain amino acid with signal sequence\n \n \n \n3\n \nhu 16C10 heavy chain DNA with signal sequence\n \n \n \n4\n \nhu 16C10 heavy chain amino acid with signal sequence\n \n \n \n5\n \nhu 16C10/4C3 light chain variable domain\n \n \n \n6\n \nhu 16C10/4C3 heavy chain variable domain\n \n \n \n7\n \nrat 16C10 light chain variable domain\n \n \n \n8\n \nrat 16C10/4C3 heavy chain variable domain\n \n \n \n9\n \nchimeric 16C10 light chain\n \n \n \n10\n \nchimeric 16C10 heavy chain\n \n \n \n11\n \nrat/hu 16C10/4C3 CDRL1\n \n \n \n12\n \nrat/hu 16C10/4C3 CDRL2\n \n \n \n13\n \nrat/hu 16C10/4C3 CDRL3\n \n \n \n14\n \nrat/hu 16C10/4C3 CDRH1\n \n \n \n15\n \nrat 16C10/4C3 CDRH2\n \n \n \n16\n \nhu 16C10/4C3 CDRH2 (N54Q)\n \n \n \n17\n \nrat 16C10 CDRH2 (N54N/Q/A)\n \n \n \n18\n \nrat 16C10/4C3 CDRH3\n \n \n \n19\n \nhu 16C10/4C3 CDRH3 (M96A)\n \n \n \n20\n \nrat 16C10 CDRH3 (M96M/A/K, M100hM/F)\n \n \n \n21\n \nrat 4C3 light chain variable domain\n \n \n \n22\n \nhu 30C10 light chain variable domain\n \n \n \n23\n \nhu 30C10 heavy chain variable domain\n \n \n \n24\n \nrat 30C10 light chain variable domain\n \n \n \n25\n \nrat 30C10 heavy chain variable domain\n \n \n \n26\n \nrat/hu 30C10 CDRL1\n \n \n \n27\n \nrat/hu 30C10 CDRL2\n \n \n \n28\n \nrat/hu 30C10 CDRL3\n \n \n \n29\n \nrat/hu 30C10 CDRH1\n \n \n \n30\n \nrat/hu 30C10 CDRH2\n \n \n \n31\n \nrat/hu 30C10 CDRH3\n \n \n \n32\n \nrat 12E6 light chain variable domain\n \n \n \n33\n \nrat 12E6 heavy chain variable domain\n \n \n \n34\n \nrat/hu 12E6 CDRL1\n \n \n \n35\n \nrat/hu 12E6 CDRL2\n \n \n \n36\n \nrat/hu 12E6 CDRL3\n \n \n \n37\n \nrat/hu 12E6 CDRH1\n \n \n \n38\n \nrat/hu 12E6 CDRH2\n \n \n \n39\n \nrat/hu 12E6 CDRH3\n \n \n \n40\n \nhuIL-17A (native)\n \n \n \n41\n \nrhIL-17A\n \n \n \n42\n \nFLAG-IL-17A\n \n \n \n43\n \nR&D IL-17A\n \n \n \n44\n \nrat 23E12 light chain variable domain DNA with signal sequence\n \n \n \n45\n \nrat 23E12 light chain variable domain amino acid with signal sequence\n \n \n \n46\n \nrat 23E12 heavy chain variable domain DNA with signal sequence\n \n \n \n47\n \nrat 23E12 heavy chain variable domain amino acid with signal sequence\n \n \n \n48\n \nrat/hu 23E12 CDRL1\n \n \n \n49\n \nrat/hu 23E12 CDRL2\n \n \n \n50\n \nrat/hu 23E12 CDRL3\n \n \n \n51\n \nrat/hu 23E12 CDRH1\n \n \n \n52\n \nrat/hu 23E12 CDRH2\n \n \n \n53\n \nrat/hu 23E12 CDRH3\n \n \n \n54\n \nrat 1D10 light chain variable domain\n \n \n \n55\n \nrat 1D10 heavy chain variable domain\n \n \n \n56\n \nrat 1D10 CDRL1\n \n \n \n57\n \nrat 1D10 CDRL2\n \n \n \n58\n \nrat 1D10 CDRL3\n \n \n \n59\n \nrat 1D10 CDRH1\n \n \n \n60\n \nrat 1D 10 CDRH2\n \n \n \n61\n \nrat 1D10 CDRH3\n \n \n \n62\n \nhu 16C10 light chain DNA with signal sequence\n \n \n \n63\n \nhu 16C10 heavy chain DNA with signal sequence\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \nSEQUENCE LISTING\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n<110> Presta, Leonard G.\n\nBowman, Edward P.\n\n\n<120> ANTIBODIES TO IL-17A\n\n\n<130> BP06474\n\n\n<150> \n \n \nUS\n 60/837,197\n \n \n\n\n<151> 2006-08-11\n\n\n<160> 63\n\n\n<170> PatentIn version 3.3\n\n\n<210> 1\n\n<211> 720\n\n<212> DNA\n\n<213> Artificial\n\n\n<220>\n\n<223> Humanized 16C10 Antibody Light Chain with Signal Sequence\n\n\n<220>\n\n<221> CDS\n\n<222> (1)..(717)\n\n\n<220>\n\n<221> sig_peptide\n\n<222> (1)..(57)\n\n\n<220>\n\n<221> mat_peptide\n\n<222> (58)..(717)\n\n\n<400> 1\n\n\n\n \n\n\n<210> 2\n\n<211> 239\n\n<212> PRT\n\n<213> Artificial\n\n\n<220>\n\n<223> Synthetic Construct\n\n\n<400> 2\n\n\n\n \n\n\n<210> 3\n\n<211> 1422\n\n<212> DNA\n\n<213> Artificial\n\n\n<220>\n\n<223> Humanized 16C10 Antibody Heavy Chain with Signal Sequence\n\n\n<220>\n\n<221> CDS\n\n<222> (1)..(1419)\n\n\n<220>\n\n<221> sig_peptide\n\n<222> (1)..(57)\n\n\n<220>\n\n<221> mat_peptide\n\n<222> (58) ..

For example, in non-patent literature 1 it is described that PGD2 is involved in sleeping and secretion of hormones in central nervous system, and in inhibiting activity of platelet aggregation, contraction of bronchial smooth muscle, vasodilation and constriction of a blood vessel etc. in peripheral system. Moreover, PGD2 is considered to be involved in forming pathological condition of an allergic disease such as bronchial asthma since it is a major metabolic product of arachidonic acid produced from a mast cell, and has a potent bronchoconstricting effect, causing an increase of blood vessel permeability and migration of inflammatory cell such as an eosinophil.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA DP receptor (also called DP1 receptor) or CRTH2 receptor(also called DP2 receptor) is known as a receptor of PGD2 but these are completely different receptors. In Patent literatures 1-9 indole derivatives having a DP receptor antagonistic activity is disclosed, and in Patent literatures 10-21 indole derivatives having a CRTH2 receptor antagonistic activity is disclosed\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, indole derivatives having inhibitory activity against noradrenalin re-uptake are disclosed in Patent literature 22.\n\n \n \n \nPatent literature 1: \n \nWO 2005/056527\n \n Pamphlet\n \nPatent literature 2: \n \nWO 2004/111047\n \n Pamphlet\n \nPatent literature 3: \n \nWO 2004/103970\n \n Pamphlet\n \nPatent literature 4: \n \nWO 2004/039807\n \n Pamphlet\n \nPatent literature 5: \n \nWO 2003/062200\n \n Pamphlet\n \nPatent literature 6: \n \nWO 2002/094830\n \n Pamphlet\n \nPatent literature 7: \n \nWO 2001/079169\n \n Pamphlet\n \nPatent literature 8: \n \nWO 2003/022814\n \n Pamphlet\n \nPatent literature 9: \n \nWO 2003/022813\n \n Pamphlet\n \nPatent literature 10: \n \nWO 2003/097598\n \n Pamphlet\n \nPatent literature 11: \n \nWO 2003/097042\n \n Pamphlet\n \nPatent literature 12: \n \nWO 2005/019171\n \n Pamphlet\n \nPatent literature 13: \n \nWO 2004/106302\n \n Pamphlet\n \nPatent literature 14: \n \nWO 2004/007451\n \n Pamphlet\n \nPatent literature 15: \n \nWO 2003/101981\n \n Pamphlet\n \nPatent literature 16: \n \nWO 2003/101961\n \n Pamphlet\n \nPatent literature 17: \n \nWO 2003/066047\n \n Pamphlet\n \nPatent literature 18: \n \nWO 2005/040112\n \n Pamphlet\n \nPatent literature 19: \n \nWO 2005/040114\n \n Pamphlet\n \nPatent literature 20: \n \nWO 2005/044260\n \n Pamphlet\n \nPatent literature 21: \n \nGB 2407318A\n \n Pamphlet\n \nPatent literature 22: \n \nWO 2005/019208\n \n Pamphlet\n \nNon-patent literature 1: \nPharmacol.

assay\n\n\n \n \n \n30 ml of peripheral blood was collected from a healthy volunteer using a syringe containing one ninth amount of 3.8 % sodium citrate for diagnosis. After being centrifuged at 180 g for 10 minutes at room temperature, a supernatant was collected and used as Platelet Rich Plasma(PRP). The resulting PRP was washed with wash buffer and centrifuged three times(Washed Platelet: WP) and platelets were counted by a microcell counter. WP was added to a plate in amount of 1.5 x 10\n8\n/assay and the plate was treated with 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthin(IBMX; 0.5 mM) for 5 minutes. A reaction was initiated by adding 100 nM of PGD\n2\n 5 min after an addition of a test compound. The reaction was terminated with an addition of 1N HCl after 2 minutes and the cells were destructed using 12 % triton X-100. An amount of cAMP in the supernatant was assayed by Homogeneous Trangient Fluorescence(HTRF)\n\n\n \n2) Receptor Binding Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nA prepared WP was homogenated and a membrane fraction was collected with high-speed centrifugation. A compound of the present invention or a reference compound A(No. IC-73 in \n \nWO 2003/097598\n \n) was added to the plate and [\n3\nH]-PGD\n2\n was also added. A platelet membrane, a protein concentration is 2 mg/mL, was added and mixed in the plate, and placed on ice for 2 hours. The reaction solution was transferred to a low protein-adsorptive filter and washed with a wash solution eight times using a cell harvester. After the final washing, water was removed sufficiently, and micoscinti was added. DP inhibitory activity was investigated by measuring [\n3\nH] by using Micro Beta.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n50% DP-inhibitory concentrations (IC50) in the cAMP assay and Ki values in the receptor binding assay were shown in Table 29.\n\n\n \n3) Prostanoid agonist and antagonist assay\n\n\n \n \n \nAgonistic and antagonistic activities of the compounds of the present invention were evaluated based on intracellular calcium flux or cAMP-production as an indicator using HEK 293 cells expressing human EP1, EP2, EP3, EP4, FP, TP and IP respectively.

A solution of 1% OVA was aerosolized by ultrasonic nebulizer(NE-U17) and the rats were subjected to inhalation exposure of the aerosol for 30 minutes in an exposing chamber 12, 19, 26 and 33 days after the sensitization. One hour before the 4th exposure of the antigen, compounds of the present invention were administered in a dose of 10 mg/kg p.o. once a day for three days consecutively. In a control group, 0.5% of methyl cellulose was administered in place of the compound of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnder pentobarbital anesthesia(80 mg/kg, i.p.), acetylcholine(3.9, 7.8, 15.6, 31.3, 62.5, 125, 250 and 500 µg/kg) was injected to jugular vein of the rats successively from a lower dose at intervals of 5 minutes three days after the fourth exposure to the antigen, and immediate contractile reaction of airways(an increase of insufflation pressure) was measured by a modified method of Konnzett & Rössler. Inhibition rate of increased hyperresponsive airway against the control group was calculated based on area under curve(AUC) obtained from concentration-response curve of acetylcholine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter the measurement of increased hyperresponsive airway was completed, bronchoalveoli of the rats were washed with 5 mL of saline three times. Total cell number in the washings was counted by a hemacytometer under light microscope, and inhibition rates of infiltration of inflammatory cells against the control group were calculated. Further, muchin in the airway lavage fluid was measured by ELIZA method using jacalin, a muchin-binding lectin, and the inhibition rates of mucus-secretion against the control group were calculated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults were shown in Table 38.\n\n \n[Table 38]\n \n \n \nNo. of compounds\n \ndose (mg/kg)\n \ninhibition rate (%)\n \n \n \nincreased hyperresponsive airway\n \ninfiltration of inflammatory cells\n \nmucus-secretion\n \n \n \n \nI-14\n \n10\n \n31\n \n57\n \n55\n \n \n \nI-65\n \n10\n \n62\n \n61\n \n40\n \n \n \nI-75\n \n10\n \n58\n \n71\n \n77\n \n \n \nI-77\n \n10\n \n110\n \n28\n \n72\n \n \n \nI-82\n \n10\n \n59\n \n35\n \n47\n \n \n \nI-103\n \n10\n \n71\n \n58\n \n52\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \nTest Example 3 Test using nasal congestion model of guinea pig\n\n\n \n \n \nMethods of measuring nasal airway resistance and evaluating anti-nasal congestion activity using a rat were illustrated below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA 1% solution of ovalbumin(OVA) was aerosolized by ultrasonic nebulizer, a male Hartley guinea pigs was sensitized by inhalation of the aerosol for 10 minutes twice at an interval of a week and a reaction was initiated by exposure to the antigen 7 days later. Trachea of the guinea pig was incised under pentobarbital anesthesia(30 mg/kg, i.p.), and cannulae were fitted at the sides of nasal cavity and lung respectively. To the lung side, a ventilator supplying 4 mL of air every time at a rate of 60 times/min was connected. Spontaneous breathing of the guinea pig was stopped by the administration of gallamine(2 mg/kg, i.v.) and 4 mL of air every time was supplied at a rate of 70 times/minute to rostrum of nose through the cannula of the nasal side using a ventilator. Air pressure necessary for supplying the air was measured by a transducer fitted at the side branch and used as an indicator for resistance of nasal cavity. Exposure to the antigen was performed by generating the aerosol of 3% OVA solution between the ventilator and the nasal cavity cannula for three minutes. Compounds of the present invention were administered intravenously 10 minutes before the exposure to the antigen. Resistance of nasal cavity was continuously measured during a period from 0 to 30 minutes, and the inhibition rate against the vehicle was obtained based on AUC of the 30 minutes, which was recorded with resistance of nasal cavity(cm H\n2\nO) as a longitudinal axis, and time(from 0 to 30 min.) as an abscissa axis.\n\n\n \nFormulation Example\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following formulating examples are just for illustrative purposes and not intended to limit the range of the present invention.
