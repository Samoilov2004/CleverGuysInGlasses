Description\n\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIntracellular receptors (IR's) are a class of structurally related proteins involved in the regulation of gene expression. The steroid hormone receptors are a subset of this superfamily whose natural ligands are typically comprised of endogenous steroids such as estradiol, progesterone, and cortisol. Man-made ligands to these receptors play an important role in human health and, of these receptors, the glucocorticoid receptor has an essential role in regulating human physiology and immune response. Steroids that interact with the glucocorticoid receptor have been shown to be potent anti-inflammatory agents. The present invention is directed to a novel class of compounds that are selective glucocorticoid receptor modulators that have potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive activity and possess advantages over steroidal glucocorticoid ligands with respect to side effects, efficacy, toxicity and/or metabolism.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention encompasses compounds of Formula I:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nor pharmaceutically acceptable salts or hydrates thereof, which are useful as selective glucocorticoid receptor ligands for treating a variety of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases or conditions.

It will also vary according to a variety of factors including the age, weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination and response of the individual patient. In general, the daily dose from about 0.001 mg to about 100 mg per kg body weight of a mammal, preferably 0.01 mg to about 10 mg per kg. On the other hand, it may be necessary to use dosages outside these limits in some cases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. For example, a formulation intended for oral administration to humans may contain from about 0.5 mg to about 5 g of active agent compounded with an appropriate and convenient amount of carrier material which may vary from about 5 to about 95 percent of the total composition. Dosage unit forms will generally contain from about 1 mg to about 2 g of an active ingredient, typically 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg, 400 mg, 500 mg, 600 mg, 800 mg, or 1000 mg.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the treatment of glucocorticoid receptor mediated diseases the compound of Formula I, Ia, or Ib may be administered orally, topically, parenterally, by inhalation spray or rectally in dosage unit formulations containing conventional non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants and vehicles. The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intrasternal injection or infusion techniques. In addition to the treatment of warm-blooded animals such as mice, rats, horses, cattle, sheep, dogs, cats, etc., the compound of the invention is effective in the treatment of humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions containing the active ingredient may be in a form suitable for oral use, for example, as tablets, troches, lozenges, solutions, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, syrups or elixirs. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents, flavouring agents, colouring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations.

These excipients may be for example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, for example, corn starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, for example starch, gelatin or acacia, and lubricating agents, for example, magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed. They may also be coated by the technique described in the U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,256,108; 4,166,452; and 4,265,874 to form osmotic therapeutic tablets for control release.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredients is mixed with water-miscible solvents such as propylene glycol, PEGs and ethanol, or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAqueous suspensions contain the active material in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions.

The aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives, for example ethyl, or n-propyl, p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more colouring agents, one or more flavouring agents, and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose, saccharin or aspartame.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set forth above, and flavouring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavouring and colouring agents, may also be present.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of an oil-in-water emulsion. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, for example olive oil or arachis oil, or a mineral oil, for example liquid paraffin or mixtures of these. Suitable emulsifying agents may be naturally-occurring phosphatides, for example soy bean, lecithin, and esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example sorbitan monooleate, and condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The emulsions may also contain sweetening and flavouring agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSyrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, for example glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol or sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a perservative and flavouring and colouring agents. The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butane diol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. Cosolvents such as ethanol, propylene glycol or polyethylene glycols may also be used. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of Formula I, Ia, or Ib may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ambient temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials are cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor topical use, creams, ointments, gels, solutions or suspensions, etc., containing a compound of Formula I, Ia, or Ib are employed. (For purposes of this application, topical application shall include mouth washes and gargles.) Topical formulations may generally be comprised of a pharmaceutical carrier, cosolvent, emulsifier, penetration enhancer, preservative system, and emollient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ability of the compounds of Formula I, Ia, or Ib to selectively modulate glucocorticoid receptors makes them useful for treating, preventing or reversing the progression of a variety of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases and conditions. Thus, the compounds of the present invention are useful to treat, prevent or ameliorate the following diseases or conditions: inflammation, tissue rejection, auto-immunity, various malianancies, such as leukemias and lymphomas, Cushing's syndrome, acute adrenal insufficiency, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, rheumatic fever, polyarteritis nodosa, granulomatous polyarteritis, inhibition of myeloid cell lines, immune proliferation/apoptosis, HPA axis suppression and regulation, hypercortisolemia, stroke and spinal cord injury, hypercalcemia, hyperglycemia, acute adrenal insufficiency, chronic primary adrenal insufficiency, secondary adrenal insufficiency, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, cerebral edema, thrombocytopenia, Little's syndrome, obesity and metabolic syndrome.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention are also useful for treating, preventing or reversing the progression of disease states involving systemic inflammation such as inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, polyartitis nodosa, Wegener's granulomatosis, giant cell arteritis, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, uveitis, hay fever, allergic rhinitis, urticaria, angioneurotic edema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, tendonitis, bursitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, autoimmune chronic active hepatitis, organ transplantation, hepatitis, and cirrhosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention are useful for treating, preventing or reversing the progression of a variety of topical diseases such as inflammatory scalp alopecia, panniculitis, psoriasis, discoid lupus erythematosus, inflamed cysts, atopic dermatitis, pyoderma gangrenosum, pemphigus vulgaris, buflous pemphigoid, systemic lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis, herpes gestationis, eosinophilic fasciitis, relapsing polychondritis, inflammatory vasculitis, sarcoidosis, Sweet's disease, type I reactive leprosy, capillary hemangiomas, contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, lichen planus, exfoliative dermatitus, erythema nodosum, acne, hirsutism, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiform, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention are also useful in treating, preventing or reversing the progression of disease states associated with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), cell apoptosis, and cancer including, but not limited to, Kaposi's sarcoma, immune system activation and modulation, desensitization of inflammatory responses, IIL-1 expression, natural killer cell development, lymphocytic leukemia, and treatment of retinitis pigmentosa. Cognitive and behavioral processes are also susceptible to glucocorticoid therapy where antagonists would potentially be useful in the treatment of processes such as cognitive performance, memory and learning enhancement, depression, addiction, mood disorders, chronic fatigue syndrome, schizophrenia, stroke, sleep disorders, and anxiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also encompasses a method for treating a glucocorticoid receptor mediated disease comprising concomitantly administering to a patient in need of such treatment a compound of Formula I, Ia, or Ib and one or additional more agents. For treating or preventing asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the compounds of Formula I, Ia, or Ib may be combined with one or more agents selected from the group consisting of: θ-agonists (e.g., salmeterol), theophylline, anticholinergics (e.g., atropine and ipratropium bromide), cromolyn, nedocromil and leukotriene modifiers (e.g., montelukast). For treating or preventing inflammation, the compounds of Formula I, Ia, or Ib may be combined with one or the following: a salicylate, including acetylsalicylic acid, a non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug, including indomethacin, sulindac, mefenamic, meclofenamic, tolfenamic, tolmetin, ketorolac, dicofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen, fenoprofen, ketoprofen, flurbiprofin and oxaprozin, a TNF inhibitor, including etanercept and infliximab, an IL-1 receptor antagonist, a cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drug, including methotrexate, leflunomide, azathioprine and cyclosporine, a gold compound, hydroxychloroquine or sulfasalazine, penicillamine, darbufelone, and a ρ38 kinase inhibitor.

E., et al., \nEuropean Journal of Cancer, \n30A: 484-490 (1994)) HeLa (ATCC) cultured in RPMI 1640 (Gibco 11835-055) containing 20 mM Hepes, 4 mM L-glu, 10 ug/ml of human insulin (Sigma, I-0259), 10% FBS and 20 ug/ml of Gentamicin (Gibco#15710-072) are rinsed twice in PBS. Phenol red-free Trypsin-EDTA is diluted in the same PBS 1:10. The cell layers are rinsed with 1× Trypsin, extra Trypsin is poured out, and the cell layers are incubated at 37° C. for ˜2 min. The flask is tapped and checked for signs of cell detachment. Once the cells begin to slide off the flask, the complete media is added. The cells are counted at this point, then diluted to the appropriate concentration and split into flasks or dishes for further culturing (Usually 1:3 to 1:6 dilution).\n\n\n \nPreparation of Hela Cell Lysate\n\n\n \n \n \nWhen the cells are 70 to 85% confluent, they are detached as described above, and collected by centrifuging at 1000 g for 10 minutes at 4° C. The cell pellet is washed twice with TEGM (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mM beta-mercaptoethanol, 10 mM Sodium Molybdate, pH 7.2). After the final wash, the cells are resuspended in TEGM at a concentration of 10\n7 \ncells/mL. The cell suspension is snap frozen in liquid nitrogen or ethanol/dry ice bath and transferred to −80° C. freezer on dry ice. Before setting up the binding assay, the frozen samples are left on ice-water to just thaw (˜1 hr). Then the samples are centrifuged at 12,500 g to 20,000 g for 30 min at 4° C. The supernatant is used to set-up assay right away. If using 50 μL of supernatant, the test compound can be prepared in 50 μL of the TEGM buffer.\n\n\n \nProcedure for Multiple Compound Screening\n\n\n \n \n \n1×TEGM buffer is prepared, and the isotope-containing assay mixture is prepared in the following order: EtOH (2% final concentration in reaction), \n3\nH-DEX (Amersham Biosciences) and 1×TEGM. [e.g. For 100 samples, 200 μL (100×2) of EtOH+4.25 μL of 1:10 \n3\nH—Dex stock+2300 μL (100×23) 1×TEGM]. The compound is serially diluted, e.g., if starting final conc. is 1 μM, and the compound is in 25 μL of solution, for duplicate samples, 75 μL of 4×1 μM solution is made and 3 μL of 100 μM is added to 72 μL of buffer, and 1:5 serial dilution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n25 μL, of 3H-DEX (6 nM) trace and 25 μL compound solution are first mixed together, followed by addition of 50 μL receptor solution. The reaction is gently mixed, spun briefly at about 200 rpm and incubated at 4° C. overnight. 100 μL of 50% HAP slurry is prepared and added to the incubated reaction which is then vortexed and incubated on ice for 5 to 10 minutes. The reaction mixture is vortexed twice more to resuspend HAP while incubating reaction. The samples in 96-well format are then washed in wash buffer using The FilterMate™ Universal Harvester plate washer (Packard). The washing process transfers HAP pellet containing ligand-bound expressed receptor to Unifilter-96 GF/B filter plate (Packard). The HAP pellet on the filter plate is incubated with 50 μL of MICROSCINT (Packard) scintillint for 30 minutes before being counted on the TopCount microscintillation counter (Packard). IC\n50\ns are calculated using DEX as a reference.\n\n\n \nTrans-Activation Modulation of Glucocorticoid Receptor Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nThis assay assesses the ability of test compounds to control transcription from the MMTV-LUC reporter gene in lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells or HeLa cells, a human breast cancer cell line that naturally expresses the human GR. The assay measures induction of a modified MMTV LTR/promoter linked to the LUC reporter gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe routine transient assay consists of plating 7,000-25,000 cells/well of a white, clear-bottom 96-well plate. Alternatively, 384-well plates can be used at a cell concentration of 10,000/well. The media that the cells are plated in is “exponential growth medium” which consists of phenol red-free RPMI1640 containing 10% FBS, 4 mM L-glutamine, 20 mM HEPES, 10 ug/mL human insulin, and 20 ug/mL gentamicin. Incubator conditions are 37° C. and 5% CO\n2\n. The transfection is done in batch mode. The cells are trypsinized and counted to the right cell number in the proper amount of fresh media. It is then gently mixed with the FuGene6/DNA mix and plated onto the 96 or 384-well plate, all the wells receive 100 uL or 40 uL, respectively, of medium+lipid/DNA complex then incubated 37° C. overnight. The transfection cocktail consists of serum-free OptiMEM, FuGene6 reagent and DNA. The manufacturer's (Roche Biochemical) protocol for cocktail setup is as follows: The lipid to DNA ratio is approximately 2.5:1 and the incubation time is 20 min at room temperature. Sixteen to 24 hours after transfection, the cells are treated with dexamethasone to a final concentration of 10 nM as well as the compound of interest, such that final DMSO (vehicle) concentration is equal to or less than 1%. Each plate also contains samples that are treated with 10 nM dexamethasone alone, which is used as the 100% activity control. The cells are exposed to the compounds for 24 hours. After 24 hours, the cells are lysed by a Promega cell culture lysis buffer for approximately 30 min and then the luciferase activity in the extracts is assayed in the 96-well format luminometer. In 384-well format, Steady-Glo (Promega) or Steady-Lite (PerkinElmer) can be used by adding an equal volume of reagent to the media present in each well. Activity induced by 10 nM dexamethasone alone is set at 100% activity. Antagonist activity is calculated by determining the decrease in dexamethasone-induced activity in response to compound treatment relative to samples that were treated with dexamethasone alone. Results are expressed as % inhibition of 10 nM dexamethasone activity or as fold of 10 nM dexamethasone activity. This transactivation assay can be performed in an agonist and antagonist mode to identify these different activities.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nActivity of test compounds is calculated as the E\nmax \nrelative to the activity obtained with 300 nM dexamethasone. Activity of test compounds is calculated as the E\nmax \nrelative to the activity obtained with 300 nM DEX. The exemplified tissue selective glucocorticoid receptor modulators of the present invention display agonist activity in this assay of greater than 5% and less than 100%, and maximal transactivation activity less then maximal transrepression activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe action of compounds is also tested in an antagonist mode (Anti-GRAMMER) in which the cells are treated with medium containing an agonist such as 10 nM DEX and the ability to agents to inhibit the activation by an agonist is measured.\n\n\n \nTransrepression Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nThis assay assesses the ability of test compounds to control transcription from the TNFα-β-lactamase reporter gene in U937 cells, a human myelomonocytic leukemia cell line that naturally expresses the human GR. The assay measures compound dependent-repression of the TNFa promoter linked to a reporter gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe human U937 cells that had been stablely transfected with the TNF-α promoter driving β-lactamase are used for this assay. U937 cells contain an endogenous glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Cells are maintained in RPMI 1640 Growth medium (Gibco Cat#11875-093) containing 25 mM HEPES, 10% FBS, 2 mM L-Glutamine, 1 mM Sodium pyruvate, 25 μg/ml Gentamicin (Gibco Cat#15710-064), 1:1000 2-Mercaptoethanol (Gibco Cat#21985-023) and 0.8 mg/ml G418 (Gibco Cat#10131-027). The density of the cells in the flask needs to be about 1×106-3×106/ml at the time of harvest. Usually, the cells are split to 1.2˜1.4×105/ml (1:10) 3 days prior to the assay. 50,000 cells/well are plated in 96 well black-walled plates the day of assay. Test compounds are added 10 μL/well, and cells are incubated at 37° C. for 30˜45 min. For assaying compounds, first dilute 1:10 in DMSO to make 1 mM, then further dilute 1:100 in medium to make 10× stock prior to adding to the cells. Add 50 ng/ml PMA (Sigma, cat# P8139) 10 μL/well to a final concentration 5 ng/ml, and 1 μg/ml LPS (Sigma, cat# L4130) 10 μL/well to a final concentration 100 ng/ml. Incubate cells at 37° C. overnight for ˜18 hr. PMA is stored frozen as 100 μg/ml stock in DMSO. Dilute 1:10 in DMSO for a working stock of 10 μg/ml and store at −20 C. For assaying, dilute the 10 μg/ml working stock 1:200 in medium to make a 10× solution (50 ng/ml). Store frozen LPS at 1 mg/ml in PBS, dilute 1:1000 in medium to make 10× (1 μg/ml) for the assay. Add 6× loading buffer (CCF2-AM) 20 μL/well, and incubate at room temperature for 70˜90 min. Read plates on CytoFluor II Plate Reader according to manufacture suggested protocols. The activity repressed by 100 nM dexamethasone alone is set as 100% activity.\n\n\n \nMicroarray Analysis\n\n\n \n \n \nThis assay assesses the ability of test compounds to modulate the transcription of endogenously expressed genes in a variety of cell types including but not limited to A549, HeLa or U937 cells. All cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen Life Tech, Carlsbad Calif. A549 cells were grown in phenol red-free DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells were grown at 37° C. with 5% CO2. Using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen Corp, Valencia Calif.), total RNA was extracted and purified from A549 cells treated with different GC compounds for 24 hours, at a fully active dose. These cells express large amount of the GR and are very responsive to GC treatment. All samples were compared against cells treated with vehicle. Expression levels of 23000 genes were measured using oligonucleotide microarrays purchased from Agilent Technologies, Inc. Each comparison was done on a pair of microarrays with reversed fluorophores. Raw image intensity data were processed according to the method described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,351,712. The method was used to remove dye bias and to derive a Rosetta probability (p) and fold change value for each gene and each sample pair. Furthermore, for each gene an ANOVA model was constructed across all treatments to derive error estimates. P values for evaluating expression differences were computed using a Bayesian adjusted t-test that was developed by Lënnstedt and Speed (2002) and extended by Smyth (2003). A gene was declared differentially expressed in any particular comparison if it satisfied two criteria:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n1. The Rosetta p value had to be less than 0.1 and the Rosetta fold change value had to be greater than 1.4 in at least one of the treatments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n2. The ANOVA p value had to be less than 0.01 and the fold change greater than 2 in the comparison under consideration.\n\n\n \nIn Vivo Inflammation Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nIntact adult (6 month old) female Sprague-Dawley rats are used in the oxazolone (OX) contactdermatitis model. Rats were sensitized on the ventral abdomen with OX on Day 0. On Days 7 and 9, a randomly-selected ear was challenged (same ear each time) with OX; the other was treated with vehicle. Daily treatment begun on Day 7 and continued for 7d with test compounds at different doses and 1.3 mpk 6-methlyprednisolone or 0.1 mpk DEX as positive controls. The thickness of both ears are measured on Days 11 and 14. Necropsy occurred on Day 14. The rat is first weighed, then anesthetized in a CO\n2 \nchamber until near death. Approximately 5 ml whole blood is obtained by cardiac puncture. The rat is then examined for certain signs of death and completeness. Tissues are dissected in a highly stylized fashion. The following endpoints were evaluated: a) inhibiting ear inflammation induced by oxazalone, b) raising serum insulin, c) reducing serum ACTH, d) reducing spleen weight, e) reducing skin thickness, f) reducing body weight, g) increasing expression of bone-related genes with potential relationship to negative glucocorticoid effects on bone; e) changes in molecular markers that correlate with skin inflammation, skin thinning, muscle atrophy and glucose metabolism in liver. All blood samples were collected between 1330-1530 hours, ˜4-5 hrs after the last compound treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrimary data for this assay are left and right ear thickness. Inter-ear thickness difference (etd) is used for the estimating the level of inflammation and effectiveness of the compounds is determined by their ability to reduce the increase the thickness of the inflamed ear. Back of the rat skin thickness, spleen weight, serum insulin as well as the effects of gcs on the expression of molecular markers in skin inflammation, skin atrophy, muscle atrophy and glucose metabolism in liver are measured. Data are analyzed by anova plus fisher plsd post-hoc test to identify intergroup differences.\n\n\n \nBioassay Results\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds described herein were tested in the Binding, GRAMMER and GITAR assays and demonstrated the activity profiles as shown in Table 2. Compounds shown in Table 2 have potencies in the GRAMMER and GITAR assays (as measured by inflection points, IP) of less than 1000 nM.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nTransactivation\n\n\nTransrepression\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGR\n\n\nA549 Cells\n\n\nU937 Cells\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nBIND\n\n\nGRAMMER\n\n\nGITAR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\n\n\nKi (nM)\n\n\nIP (nM)\n\n\nEmax (%)\n\n\nIP (nM)\n\n\nEmax (%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 1a\n\n\n5.2\n\n\n5.6\n\n\n83.9\n\n\n5.6\n\n\n93.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 1b\n\n\n4.0\n\n\n26.4\n\n\n56.0\n\n\n24.0\n\n\n91.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 2a\n\n\n2.2\n\n\n485.4\n\n\n46.6\n\n\n137.0\n\n\n85.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 2b\n\n\n2.1\n\n\n316.1\n\n\n45.5\n\n\n235.5\n\n\n94.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 3a\n\n\n0.9\n\n\n38.8\n\n\n127.2\n\n\n37.6\n\n\n93.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 3b\n\n\n0.9\n\n\n16.7\n\n\n130.3\n\n\n6.0\n\n\n99.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n0.9\n\n\n39.7\n\n\n80.3\n\n\n28.2\n\n\n104.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 5a\n\n\n1.4\n\n\n78.8\n\n\n65.5\n\n\n86.1\n\n\n84.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 5b\n\n\n0.9\n\n\n23.6\n\n\n58.4\n\n\n29.0\n\n\n91.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 6a\n\n\n1.1\n\n\n30.5\n\n\n62.4\n\n\n35.7\n\n\n104.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 6b\n\n\n1.3\n\n\n124.3\n\n\n84.7\n\n\n68.8\n\n\n98.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 7a\n\n\n0.6\n\n\n58.8\n\n\n60.2\n\n\n87.6\n\n\n95.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 7b\n\n\n0.9\n\n\n39.3\n\n\n55.8\n\n\n44.7\n\n\n98.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n32.2\n\n\n56.0\n\n\n21.4\n\n\n89.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n2.1\n\n\n3.2\n\n\n80.3\n\n\n0.6\n\n\n101.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10a\n\n\n3.1\n\n\n23.7\n\n\n56.6\n\n\n16.5\n\n\n89.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10b\n\n\n1.8\n\n\n12.4\n\n\n67.0\n\n\n4.0\n\n\n93.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11 \n\n\n19.2\n\n\n332.3\n\n\n41.8\n\n\n240.6\n\n\n84.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12a\n\n\n2.6\n\n\n126.6\n\n\n47.4\n\n\n93.1\n\n\n78.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12b\n\n\n1.5\n\n\n33.3\n\n\n54.2\n\n\n34.9\n\n\n93.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13a\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n8.8\n\n\n73.1\n\n\n3.9\n\n\n91.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13b\n\n\n1.9\n\n\n7.2\n\n\n57.5\n\n\n18.0\n\n\n96.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14a\n\n\n6.4\n\n\n478.8\n\n\n25.0\n\n\n1133.0\n\n\n82.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14b\n\n\n14.1\n\n\n206.1\n\n\n32.6\n\n\n248.7\n\n\n82.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15a\n\n\n10.0\n\n\n68.1\n\n\n52.7\n\n\n56.3\n\n\n87.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15b\n\n\n8.3\n\n\n149.2\n\n\n39.3\n\n\n98.5\n\n\n80.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16 \n\n\n3.7\n\n\n18.4\n\n\n38.3\n\n\n21.4\n\n\n85.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17a\n\n\n6.4\n\n\n101.3\n\n\n26.4\n\n\n75.3\n\n\n86.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17b\n\n\n7.5\n\n\n77.5\n\n\n35.6\n\n\n59.7\n\n\n83.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18a\n\n\n1.7\n\n\n22.3\n\n\n55.3\n\n\n7.9\n\n\n93.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18b\n\n\n2.3\n\n\n59.6\n\n\n56.2\n\n\n25.7\n\n\n97.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19a\n\n\n3.7\n\n\n41.9\n\n\n43.7\n\n\n32.7\n\n\n91.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19b\n\n\n9.0\n\n\n94.8\n\n\n24.2\n\n\n73.8\n\n\n86.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20a\n\n\n22.6\n\n\n187.0\n\n\n23.1\n\n\n132.7\n\n\n79.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20b\n\n\n15.1\n\n\n807.9\n\n\n11.3\n\n\n572.9\n\n\n72.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21a\n\n\n7.6\n\n\n151.8\n\n\n32.4\n\n\n100.5\n\n\n85.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21b\n\n\n3.7\n\n\n40.2\n\n\n64.8\n\n\n18.7\n\n\n91.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22a\n\n\n2.3\n\n\n28.8\n\n\n63.2\n\n\n18.7\n\n\n90.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22b\n\n\n5.1\n\n\n64.2\n\n\n74.3\n\n\n14.1\n\n\n90.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n23a\n\n\n7.7\n\n\n49.7\n\n\n39.4\n\n\n22.8\n\n\n82.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n23b\n\n\n3.3\n\n\n63.2\n\n\n47.7\n\n\n49.6\n\n\n83.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24a\n\n\n3.1\n\n\n469.8\n\n\n7.6\n\n\n447.4\n\n\n63.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24b\n\n\n7.5\n\n\n1000.0\n\n\n4.5\n\n\n376.3\n\n\n57.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25a\n\n\n26.3\n\n\n291.1\n\n\n7.9\n\n\n293.5\n\n\n61.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25b\n\n\n21.9\n\n\n401.4\n\n\n7.6\n\n\n185.5\n\n\n69.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26a\n\n\n8.6\n\n\n143.9\n\n\n24.8\n\n\n80.8\n\n\n82.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26b\n\n\n35.5\n\n\n653.2\n\n\n4.3\n\n\n1509.0\n\n\n51.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27a\n\n\n13.9\n\n\n357.1\n\n\n6.8\n\n\n597.8\n\n\n64.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27b\n\n\n13.4\n\n\n633.6\n\n\n15.4\n\n\n334.3\n\n\n71.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n28a\n\n\n8.3\n\n\n107.3\n\n\n60.4\n\n\n54.3\n\n\n81.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n28b\n\n\n5.4\n\n\n107.3\n\n\n42.3\n\n\n90.9\n\n\n80.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n29a\n\n\n11.8\n\n\n168.0\n\n\n30.7\n\n\n176.4\n\n\n66.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n29b\n\n\n8.2\n\n\n121.1\n\n\n13.7\n\n\n102.9\n\n\n60.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile the invention has been described and illustrated with reference to certain particular embodiments thereof, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various changes, modifications and substitutions can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, effective dosages other than the particular dosages as set forth herein above may be applicable as a consequence of variations in the responsiveness of the mammal being treated for any of the indications for the active agents used in the instant invention as indicated above. Likewise, the specific pharmacological responses observed may vary according to and depending upon the particular active compound selected or whether there are present pharmaceutical carriers, as well as the type of formulation employed, and such expected variations or differences in the results are contemplated in accordance with the objects and practices of the present invention. It is intended, therefore, that the invention be defined by the scope of the claims which follow and that such claims be interpreted as broadly as is reasonable."
