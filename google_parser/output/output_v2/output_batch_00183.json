Description\n\n\n\n\nThis application is a divisional of application Ser. No. 10/856,838, filed Jun. 1, 2004 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,169,928, which is a divisional of application Ser. No. 09/622,199, filed on May 31, 2001 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,138,413, which is a National Stage of International Application No. PCT/EP99/05744, filed Jul. 29, 1999.\n\n\nThe present invention relates to alkylamines of formula (A) as defined hereafter, to their preparation and to their therapeutic applications.\n\n\nAntagonists of histamine H3-receptor are known especially to increase synthesis and release of cerebral histamine. Through this mechanism, they induce an extended wakefullness, an improvement in cognitive processes, a reduction in food intake and a normalization of vestibular reflexes (Schwartz et al., Physiol. Rev., 1991, 71: 1-51).\n\n\nWhence these agents are potentially useful in several central nervous system disorders such as Alzheimer disease, mood and attention alterations, cognitive deficits in psychiatric pathologies, obesity, vertigo and motion sickness.\n\n\nHistamine H\n3\n-receptor agonists are known to inhibit the release of several neurotransmitters including histamine, monoamines and neuropeptides and thereby exert sedative and sleep-promoting effects in brain. In peripheral tissues, H3-receptor agonists exert namely anti-inflammatory, anti-nociceptive, gastrointestinal, antisecretory smooth muscle decontracting activities.\n\n\nAll the H\n3 \nreceptor antagonist or agonist compounds known so far resemble histamine in possessing an imidazole ring generally monosubstituted in 4 (5)-position (Ganellin et al., Ars Pharmaceutica, 1995, 36: 3, 455-468; Stark et al., Drug of the Future, 1996, 21 (5), 507-520).\n\n\nNumerous patents and patent applications are directed to antagonist and/or agonist compounds having such structure, in particular EP 197 840, EP 494 010, WO 93/14070, WO 96/29315, WO 92/15 567, WO 93/20061, WO 93/20062, WO 95/11894, U.S. Pat. No. 5,486,526, WO 93/12107, WO 93/12108, WO 95/14007, WO 95/06037, WO 97/29092, EP 680 960, WO 96/38141, WO 96/38142, WO 96/40126.\n\n\nIn the literature, Plazzi et al., Eur. J. Med. Chem. 1995, 30, 881, Clitherow et al., Bioorg. & Med. Chem. Lett. 6 (7), 833-838 (1996) Wolin et al., Bioorg. & Med. Chem. Lett; 8, 2157 (1998) can be cited also in this respect.\n\n\nNevertheless, such imidazole derivatives may show drawbacks such as poor blood-brain barrier penetration, interaction with cytochrome P-450 proteins and/or some hepatic and ocular toxicities.\n\n\nNon-imidazole known neuro-active compounds such as betahistine (J-M. Arrang et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1985, 111: 72-84), phencyclidine (J-M. Arrang et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1988, 157: 31-35), dimaprit (J-C Schwartz et al., Agents Actions 1990, 30: 13-23), clozapine (M. Kathmann et al., Psychopharmacology 1994, 116: 464-468), and sesquiterpenes (M. Takigawa et al., JP 06 345 642 (20 Dec. 1994)) were suggested to display H\n3\n-receptor antagonism but all these compounds have only very low potency.\n\n\nThese compounds were previously known as therapeutic agent before the discovery and characterization of the histamine H\n3\n-receptor, in particular as neuro-active agents for example as neuroleptic (clozapine) or psychotomimetic (Phencyclidine) agent.\n\n\nWhen tested at the H\n3\n-receptor, these compounds were shown to display much lower potency than the imidazole-containing compounds described in patent applications quoted above.\n\n\nAttempts at replacing the imidazole ring was generally not successful and no potent H\n3\n-receptor ligands not containing such ring was reported in the literature up to now.\n\n\nThese investigations showed the importance of the 4(5)-imidazole moiety.\n\n\nThe objective of the invention is to provide new potent H3-receptor ligands which may reduce the above-mentioned drawbacks.\n\n\nThe present invention provides new compounds, the structure of which does not contain an imidazole moiety, which are useful as histamine H\n3\n-receptor ligands.\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention have the following general formula (A):\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nin which:\n\n \n \n \n \nW is a residue which imparts antagonistic and/or agonistic activity at histamine H\n3\n-receptors when attached to an imidazole ring in 4(5)-position;\n \nR\n1 \nand R\n2 \nmay be identical or different and represent each independently\n        \n \na lower alkyl or cycloalkyl,\n\n\nor taken together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached,\n\n \n\n\n \na saturated nitrogen-containing ring\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwith m ranging from 2 to 8, or\n\n \n \n \n \na non-aromatic unsaturated nitrogen-containing ring\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwith p and q being from 0 to 3 independently and r being from 0 to 4, provided that p and q are not simultaneously 0 and 2≦p+q+r≦8,\n\n\nR\na-d \nbeing independently a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl, cycloalkyl, or carboalkoxy group, or\n\n \n \n \n \na morpholino group, or\n \na N-substituted piperazino group:\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwith R being a lower alkyl, cycloalkyl, carboalkoxy, aryl, arylalkyl, an alkanoyl or aroyl group.\n\n\n\nThe inventors have found, surprisingly, that antagonist and/or agonist compounds can be obtained by substituting a di(alkyl) or (cycloalkyl)amine, or a non-aromatic nitrogen-containing ring —NR\n1\nR\n2 \nas above defined for the imidazole ring, in known antagonist and/or agonist imidazole derivatives.\n\n\nIt is also believed that antagonist and/or agonist activity can be foreseen, by equivalence, for compounds according to formula (A) having a W residue of imidazole derivatives which were suggested in the prior art as H\n3 \nantagonists or agonists, and further for those W residues which would belong to future imidazole derivatives having substantial H\n3 \nantagonist and/or agonist activity.\n\n\nMoreover, the inventors have observed that such non-imidazole analogues can provide potent antagonist and/or agonist activity.\n\n\nIn this regards, they have prepared novel non-imidazole alkylamines analogues of formula (A) corresponding to known imidazole derivatives in particular from the above-mentioned prior art.\n\n\nThe invention also relates to the addition salts which the compounds form with pharmaceutically acceptable acids. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts comprise the nontoxic salt of inorganic or organic acids. Examples of these salts include the hydrochloride, the hydrobromide or the hydrogen maleate or hydrogen oxalate.\n\n\nThe present invention also encompasses the hydrates of the compounds, the hydrated salts of these compounds and the polymorphic crystalline structures.\n\n\nWhen the compounds can exist in one or a number of isomeric forms according to the number of asymmetric centres in the molecule, the invention relates both to all the optical isomers and to their racemic modifications and the corresponding diastereoisomers. The separation of the diastereoisomers and/or of the optical isomers can be carried out according to methods known per se.\n\n\nThe present invention also encompasses all the possible tautomeric forms of the compounds, whether these tautomers occur in isolated form or in the form of mixtures.\n\n\nAccording to the invention, lower alkyl or cycloalkyl is intended to mean a linear or branched alkyl group containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, or a saturated carbocycle containing 3 to 6 carbon atoms.\n\n\nTypically examples of lower alkyl are methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl and butyl groups.\n\n\nA preferred group of compounds according to the invention comprises those with R\n1 \nand R\n2 \nrepresenting independently a lower alkyl group, especially an ethyl group.\n\n\nPreferred compounds are also those of formula (A) in which R\n1 \nand R\n2 \ntaken together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, form a saturated nitrogen-containing ring:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nespecially with m being 4, 5 or 6, optionally substituted with an alkyl group (R\na\n), preferably a methyl group.\n\n\n\nThe groups R\na \nand R\nb \nare identical or different for each (CR\na\nR\nb\n) moiety.\n\n\nPiperidyl and pyrrolidinyl moieties are especially preferred.\n\n\nAnother preferred group of compounds comprises compounds (A) in which R\n1 \nand R\n2 \ntaken together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, form a non-aromatic unsaturated nitrogen-containing ring:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nespecially with p, q, and r being independently 1 or 2.\n\n\n\nIn this group, more preferred compounds are those with p being 2 and q and r each being 1.\n\n\nA sub-class in this group comprises compounds with R\na-d \nbeing each a hydrogen atom.\n\n\nWhen NR\n1\nR\n2 \nis a nitrogen-containing ring i) or ii) as above defined, the latter is preferably substituted with one or two lower alkyl group(s), especially a methyl group.\n\n\nThe position for substitution is preferably selected according the following order:\n\n\nbeta>gamma>alpha\n\n\n\nIn this group, for nitrogen-containing ring bearing only one substituent, this latter is preferably in beta position with respect to the nitrogen-atom.\n\n\nFor nitrogen-containing ring bearing two substituents, beta-beta substitution is preferred, especially when these two substituents are in trans-relation.\n\n\nAccording to the invention, piperidyl or pyrrolidinyl moiety substituted in beta or beta-beta position, especially with a methyl group, give particularly preferred compounds.\n\n\nWhen NR\n1\nR\n2 \nrepresents a N-substituted piperazino group, R may be a lower alkyl e.g. methyl.\n\n\nTypical examples of group R being an aryl or arylalkyl moiety are phenyl and benzyl.\n\n\nR may be also an alkanoyl or aroyl group e.g. acetyl or benzoyl.\n\n\nIn all the possible groups for R, the alkyl moiety refers to a linear or branched chain containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms.\n\n\nThe cycloalkyl group refers to a saturated carbocycle containing 3 to 7 carbon atoms.\n\n\nWhen R represents an aryl or arylalkyl group, the aryl moiety is especially a phenyl group optionally substituted with one or more substituents selected from halogen atoms, advantageously selected from fluorine, chlorine and bromine, or a lower alkyl or cycloalkyl, a trifluoromethyl, aryl, alkoxy, aryloxy, nitro, formyl, alkanoyl, aroyl, arylalkanoyl, amino, carboxamido, cyano, alkyloximino, aryloximino, α-hydroxyalkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, sulphamido, sulfamoyl, carboxamide, carboalkoxy, arylalkyl or oxime group.\n\n\nR may be also an optionally substituted benzoyl, the substituent being as defined above with reference to the phenyl group.\n\n\nTypical example of —NR\n1\nR\n2 \nrepresenting a N-substituted piperazino group is N-acetylpiperazino.\n\n\nAccording to one aspect, the compounds of the invention have the following general formula (I):\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nin which:\n\n \n \n \n \nC\nn\nH\n2\nn is a linear or branched hydrocarbon chain with n ranging from 2 to 8;\n \nX is an oxygen or sulfur atom;\n \nn\n3 \nis an integer from 0 to 5;\n \nR\n3

\nR\n1 \nand R\n2 \nare as above-defined in formula (A).\n \n \n \n\n\nA preferred group of compounds according to the invention is the group composed of compounds of formula (I) in which X is an oxygen atom.\n\n\nAnother preferred group of compounds comprises compounds (I) in which —C\nn\nH\n2n\n— is a linear chain —(CH\n2\n)\nn\n— with n being as previously defined.\n\n\nPreferred compounds are also those with n varying from 3 to 5, and with n being more preferably 3.\n\n\nA sub-class of compounds according to the invention comprises the compounds of formula (I) with n\n3 \nbeing zero that is those having an unsubstituted phenyl moiety.\n\n\nAnother group of compounds according to the invention is composed of compounds containing one or more substituents R\n3 \nwhich may be identical or different. In this group, the compounds having a mono- or di-substituted (n\n3\n=1 or 2) phenyl moiety are preferred and those mono-substituted with one group R\n3 \nas defined above in para-position are particularly preferred.\n\n\nAmong these compounds, (n\n3 \nbeing 1) R\n3 \nis preferably a halogen atom or a cyano, nitro, alkanoyl, alkyloximino or α-hydroxyalkyl group.\n\n\nStill more preferred compounds are those with R\n3 \nbeing CN, NO\n2\n, COCH\n3\n, COC\n2\nH\n5\n, H\n3\nC—C═N—OH, H\n3\nC—CH—OH and cycloalkyl-CO like cyclopropyl-CO.\n\n\nR\n3 \nbeing a halogen atom may be advantageously selected from fluorine, chlorine and bromine.\n\n\nR\n3 \nbeing an aryl group, may be especially a phenyl group.\n\n\nIn the other substituents R\n3\n, the aryl moiety is advantageously a phenyl moiety.\n\n\nR\n3 \nbeing an aryloxy group may be especially a phenoxy group.\n\n\nAccording to the invention, alkanoyl is intended to mean a group containing an alkyl moiety as defined

of the histamine H\n3\n-receptors.\n\n \n\n\nThe antagonists are advantageously used as active ingredient in particular, of medicaments having psychotropic effects, promoting wakefullness, attention, memory and improving mood, in treatment of pathologies such as Alzheimer disease and other cognitive disorders in aged persons, depressive or simply asthenic states.\n\n\nTheir nootropic effects can be useful to stimulate attention and memorization capacity in healthy humans.\n\n\nIn addition, these agents can be useful in treatment of obesity, vertigo and motion sickness.\n\n\nIt can also be useful to associate the compounds of the invention with other psychiatric agents such as neuroleptics to increase their efficiency and reduce their side effects.\n\n\nApplication in certain form of epilepsy is also foreseen.\n\n\nTheir therapeutic applications involve also peripheral organs mainly a stimulant of secretions or gastro-intestinal motricity.\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention are particularly useful for the treatment of CNS disorders of aged persons.\n\n\nThe said compounds may also be used as an agonist or partial agonist action on the said histamine receptors.\n\n\nH\n3 \nreceptor agonists and partial agonists, through their cerebral effects, mainly exert sedative, tranquillizing, antistress and analgesic activity, indicating their use as mild sedative psychotropics, in particular in various psychosomatic disorders.\n\n\nH\n3 \nagonists and partial agonists are also indicated in the treatment of migraine states and other headaches.\n\n\nThrough their peripheral effects, H\n3 \nreceptor agonists and partial agonists will be mainly indicated in the treatment of respiratory, allergic or inflammatory conditions (asthma, bronchitis, rhinitis, tracheitis, and the like), cardiac conditions (myocardial dysfunction and infarction), gastrointestinal conditions as a result of their antisecretory and anti-inflammatory actions (gastric and duodenal ulcers, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, irritable bowel, faecal incontinence, and the like), conditions of the urogenital system (cystitis, metritis, premenstrual syndrome, prostatic inflammations, urinary incontinence, genital disorders) and conditions of the cutaneous system (urticaria, itching). The anti-inflammatory and analgesic effect may usefully be turned to good account in the treatment of arthritis and other rheumatic conditions, conjunctivitis and other ocular inflammations, and sialorrhoea.\n\n\nCompounds which are histamine H\n3 \nreceptor agonists or partial agonists are advantageously used as active principle of medicinal products, in particular having mild sedative, antisecretory, anti-inflammatory, steep-regulating and anticonvulsant effects, regulatory effects on hypothalamohypophyseal secretion, anti-depressant effects, modulatory effects on cerebral circulation, modulatory effects on the immune system, and anti-allergic and antimigraine effects.\n\n\nHence the present invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions which contain as active principle a therapeutically effective amount of one of the agonist or partial agonist compounds of formula (A).\n\n\nThe present invention also relates to medicaments having the above-mentioned effects comprising as active ingredient, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (A).\n\n\nThe present invention relates more particularly to such medicaments containing a compound of formula (I) to (XVIII).\n\n\nThe present invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing as active ingredient, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound (A) together with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle or excipient.\n\n\nThe invention is directed to such pharmaceutical compositions containing as active-ingredient, a compound of formula (I) to (XVIII).\n\n\nThe medicaments or pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention can be administered via oral, parenteral or topical routes, the active ingredient being combined with a therapeutically suitable excipient or vehicle.\n\n\nAccording to the invention, oral administration is advantageously used.\n\n\nAnother subject of the present invention is the use of the compounds of formula (A) for the preparation of H\n3\n-antagonist and/or agonist medicaments according to the above-mentioned forms.\n\n\nThe invention further relates to the use of the compounds of formula (A) for preparing medicaments having the pre-cited effects.\n\n\nThe invention also concerns the use of a compound of formula (I) to (XVIII).\n\n\nStill another subject of the invention is a method for the treatment of precited ailments comprising administering a therapeutically effective dose of a compound (I), optionally in combination with a therapeutically acceptable vehicle or excipient.\n\n\nThe invention is also directed to such a method comprising administering a therapeutically effective dose of a compound of formula (I) to (XVIII).\n\n\nFor each of the above-indications, the amount of the active ingredient will depend upon the condition of the patient.\n\n\nHowever, a suitable effective dose will be in general in the range of from 10 to 500 mg per day and of from 1 to 10 mg/day for particularly active compounds.\n\n\nThese doses are given on the basis of the compound and should be adapted for the salts, hydrates or hydrated salts thereof.\n\n\nThe invention is now illustrated by the following examples.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nThe structure of the synthesized compounds and their method of preparation as well as their melting point, recrystallisation solvent and elemental analysis are summarized in the following Table I:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFORMULA\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSTRUCTURE\n\n\nmp\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN\n\n\nNAME\n\n\n(recryst. solv)\n\n\nanalysis (calc.)\n\n\nmethod\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n143-145° C.

1-bromo-5-phenoxypentane (1.4 to 3.5 mmol) in ten equivalents of the suitable secondary amine was heated to reflux temperature with stirring for 48 hours (compds. 1, 3 and 4), 24 hours (compd. 2) or 4 hours (compd. 5). After cooling, the excess base was removed under reduced pressure and the residue diluted with aqueous sodium hydroxide. The product was extracted with diethyl ether, the organic extracts washed with water, dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The remaining oil was converted to oxalate salt by dissolving in a small amount of absolute ethanol and adding a solution of two equivalents oxalic acid in absolute ethanol. The precipitate formed was washed with diethyl ether and recrystallised from absolute ethanol.\n\n\nMethod B:\n\n\nA solution of 1-bromo-5-phenoxypentane (0.9 to 1.7 mmol) and an excess of the suitable secondary amine (2.3 to 10 equivalents) in 10 ml absolute ethanol was heated to reflux temperature with stirring for 48 hours (compd. 6) or 24 hours (compds. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12&13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 29). After cooling, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the residue diluted with aqueous sodium hydroxide. The product was extracted with diethyl ether, the organic extracts washed with water, dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The cis and trans isomers 12 and 13 were separated by column chromatography on silica gel eluting with a solvent mixture of petroleum spirit (bp 60-80° C.), diethyl ether and triethylamine in the ratio 66:33:1, and the eluent was removed under reduced pressure to leave an oil. Compounds 14 and 16 were purified by column chromatography on silica gel eluting with diethyl ether and triethylamine in the ratio 99:1, and the eluent was removed under reduced pressure to leave an oil. The oil was converted to oxalate salt (compds. 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17 and 29) by dissolving in a small amount of absolute ethanol and adding a solution of two equivalents of oxalic acid in absolute ethanol.

After cooling, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the residue diluted with aqueous sodium hydroxide. The product was extracted with diethyl ether, the organic extracts washed with water, dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The remaining oil was converted to oxalate salt by dissolving in a small amount of absolute ethanol and adding a solution of two equivalents oxalic acid in absolute ethanol. If no precipitate appeared, diethyl ether was added to form a precipitate. The solid was washed with diethyl ether and recrystallised from absolute ethanol.\n\n\nMethod D:\n\n\nA solution of the suitable 4′-(5-bromopentoxy)phenyl ketone (0.7 to 1 mmol, compds. 39, 44 and 45) or 1-bromo, 5-(4-phenoxyphenoxy)pentane (0.6 mmol, compd. 48) and an excess of pyrrolidine (10 to 15 equivalents) in 10 ml absolute ethanol was heated to reflux temperature with stirring for 16 hours (compds. 39, 44 and 48) or 24 hours (compd. 45). After cooling, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the residue diluted with aqueous sodium hydroxide. The product was extracted with chloroform (compds. 39, 45 and 48) or dichloromethane (compd. 44), the organic extracts dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The remaining oil was converted to oxalate salt by dissolving in a small amount of absolute ethanol and adding a solution of two equivalents oxalic acid in absolute ethanol. The precipitate was washed with diethyl ether and recrystallised from absolute ethanol (recrystallised twice from absolute ethanol in the case of compd. 39).\n\n\nMethod E:\n\n\n1. The oxalate 18 was prepared according to method C. A solution of compound 18 (0.57 mmol) in 10 ml methanol and 10 ml absolute ethanol was placed with 100 mg of palladium (5%) on carbon catalyst in a two-neck round-bottom flask fitted with a balloon filled with hydrogen. The mixture was stirred vigorously at room temperature and the flask was purged of air and filled with hydrogen. After 3 hours, the catalyst was filtered off on celite and the solvent removed under reduced pressure. The residual solid was converted to oxalate salt by dissolving in methanol and adding a solution of oxalic acid (2 equivalents) in absolute ethanol. Diethyl ether was added to form a precipitate. The product was recrystallised from absolute ethanol.\n\n\n2. To a solution of compound 40 (0.35 mmol) in pyridine vigorously stirred at 0° C. was added dropwise a slight excess of benzoyl chloride (0.4 mmol). The stirring was allowed to continue 20 minutes after the end of the addition after which the mixture was placed in the refrigerator overnight (16 hours). The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the residue diluted with aqueous sodium hydroxide. The product was extracted with chloroform, the organic extracts dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The remaining oil was converted to oxalate salt by dissolving in a small amount of absolute ethanol and adding a solution of two equivalents oxalic acid in absolute ethanol. The precipitate was dissolved in methanol, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. the solid was recrystallised from absolute ethanol\n\n\nMethod F:\n\n\nIn a three-neck flask kept under nitrogen was placed a solution of the suitable phenol (1.6 mmol), 3-(diethylamino)propanol (1.5 mmol), and triphenyl phosphine (1.9 mmol) in 10 ml freshly distilled tetrahydrofuran. The mixture was stirred and cooled to 0° C. with an ice and salt bath. A solution of diisopropyl azodicarboxylate (2 mmol) in 10 ml tetrahydrofuran was added very slowly (typically over 40 minutes) and the mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature after which it was stirred overnight at room temperature (16 hours). The solvent was then removed under reduced pressure, the residue dissolved in ethyl acetate (20 ml) and the product extracted with 2N HCl (2×10 ml). The aqueous solution was neutralised with sodium hydroxide and the product extracted with dichloromethane. After drying over magnesium sulphate and filtration, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was converted to oxalate salt by dissolving in a small amount of absolute ethanol and adding a solution of two equivalents oxalic acid in absolute ethanol. If no precipitate appeared, diethyl ether was added to form a precipitate. The solid was washed with diethyl ether and recrystallised from absolute ethanol (compds. 43 and 46) or from a 1:1 mixture of methanol and absolute ethanol (compd. 42).\n\n\nMethod G:\n\n\nA solution of the free base of compound 39 (0.6 mmol) or compound 46 (0.8 mmol) in 20 ml dry diethyl ether was added dropwise to a stirred suspension of lithium aluminium hydride (0.6 or 0.8 mmol) in 20 ml dry diethyl ether kept under nitrogen. The mixture was stirred at room temperature under nitrogen for two hours. Ice-cold water was carefully added and the organic layer decanted. The aqueous phase was extracted with diethyl ether. The combined organic solutions were dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure to leave a yellow oil. The oil was converted to oxalate salt by dissolving in a small amount of absolute ethanol and adding a solution of two equivalents oxalic acid in absolute ethanol. The precipitate was washed with diethyl ether and recrystallised from absolute ethanol (compd 50) or from isopropyl alcohol, giving a very hygroscopic solid (compd. 63).\n\n\nMethod H:\n\n\nA solution of the suitable α-bromo-ω-(4-cyanophenoxy) alkane (0.5 to 0.7 mmol) and an excess of the suitable secondary amine (8 to 12 equivalents) in 10 ml absolute ethanol was heated to reflux temperature with stirring for 24 hours (compds. 54, 55, 57 and 60), 20 hours (compd. 52), 16 hours (compds. 56, 58, 59 and 61) or 8 hours (compd. 51) or was stirred at room temperature for 48 hours (compd. 53) or 24 hours (compd. 60). After cooling, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the residue diluted with aqueous sodium hydroxide. The product was extracted with diethyl ether, the organic extracts washed with water, dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. Compound 62 was purified by column chromatography on silica gel eluting with ethyl acetate, and concentrated under reduced pressure. For all the compounds of method H, the remaining oil was converted to oxalate salt by dissolving in a small amount of absolute ethanol and adding a solution of two equivalents oxalic acid in absolute ethanol. If no precipitate appeared, diethyl ether was added to form a precipitate. The solid was washed with diethyl ether and recrystallised from absolute ethanol (two recrystallisations were required for compds. 58 and 59) or from a 1:1 mixture of methanol and absolute ethanol (compd. 55).\n\n\nMethod J:\n\n\nA solution of compound 46 (1 mmol) in 10 ml methanol was stirred at room temperature and a solution of hydroxylamine hydrochloride (2 equivalents) in 2 ml water was added. The mixture was stirred at 50-70° C. in a water bath for 20 minutes. Methanol was removed under reduced pressure. The residue diluted with aqueous sodium hydroxide. The product was extracted with diethyl ether, the organic extracts washed with water, dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. Compound 64 was purified by column chromatography on silica gel eluting with ethyl acetate, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The remaining oil was converted to oxalate salt by dissolving in a small amount of absolute ethanol and adding a solution of two equivalents oxalic acid in absolute ethanol. Diethyl ether was added to form a precipitate. The solid was washed with diethyl ether and recrystallised from absolute ethanol.\n\n\nFor example 98, the product was converted to the hydrochloride salt by addition of 2N HCl. The salt was recrystallised from absolute ethanol/diethyl ether (1:1).\n\n\nMethod K:\n\n\nA solution of 4′-(3-bromopropoxy)acetophenone (0.8 to 1.9 mmol) and an excess of the suitable piperidine (3 to 10 equivalents) in 10 ml absolute ethanol was heated to reflux temperature with stirring for 16 hours. After cooling, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the residue diluted with aqueous sodium hydroxide. The product was extracted with diethyl ether, the organic extracts washed with water, dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The cis and trans isomers 67 and 70 were separated by column chromatography on silica gel eluting with a solvent mixture of diethyl ether, petroleum spirits (bp 60-80° C.) and triethylamine in the ratio 66:33:1, and the eluent was removed under reduced pressure to leave an oil. Compound 75 was purified by column chromatography on silica gel eluting with chloroform and methanol (1:1), and concentrated under reduced pressure. The remaining oil was converted to oxalate salt by dissolving in a small amount of absolute ethanol and adding a solution of two equivalents of oxalic acid in absolute ethanol. If no precipitate appeared, diethyl ether was added to form a precipitate. The solid was washed with diethyl ether and recrystallised from absolute ethanol.\n\n\nMethod L:\n\n\nIn a three-neck flask kept under nitrogen was placed a solution of the suitable 4′-hydroxyphenyl ketone (0.9 to 3 mmol), 3-(1-piperidinyl)propanol (0.9 to 3 mmol), and triphenyl phosphine (1 to 3.5 mmol) in 10 ml freshly distilled tetrahydrofuran. The mixture was stirred and cooled to 0° C. with an ice and salt bath. A solution of diethyl azodicarboxylate (1 to 3.6 mmol) in 10 ml tetrahydrofuran was added very slowly (typically over 40 minutes) and the mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature after which it was stirred overnight at room temperature (16 hours). The solvent was then removed under reduced pressure, the residue dissolved in ethyl acetate (20 ml) and the product extracted with 2N HCl (2×10 ml). The aqueous solution was neutralised with sodium hydroxide and the product extracted with dichloromethane. After drying over magnesium sulphate and filtration, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel eluting with diethyl ether containing 1% triethylamine, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was converted to oxalate salt by dissolving in a small amount of absolute ethanol and adding a solution of two equivalents oxalic acid in absolute ethanol. If no precipitate appeared, diethyl ether was added to form a precipitate. The solid was washed with diethyl ether and recrystallised from absolute ethanol.\n\n\nFor example 82, the amine was converted to the hydrochloride salt by addition of 2N HCl. The salt was recrystallised from absolute ethanol/diethyl ether (1:14).\n\n\nMethod M:\n\n\nA solution of 3-(4-acetylphenoxy)-2-(R or S)-methylpropyl para-toluene sulfonate (0.55 to 0.66 mmol) and piperidine (5 to 6 mmol) in 10 ml absolute ethanol was stirred and heated under reflux for 2 hours. After cooling, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure, the residue diluted with aqueous NaOH (10 ml) and the oil was extracted with diethyl ether (3×10 ml). The combined extracts were dried over magnesium sulfate, and the solvent removed under reduced pressure. The yellow oil was purified by column chromatography on silica gel eluting with a 1:1 mixture of chloroform and absolute ethanol (example 80). After concentration, the oil was dissolved in about 2 ml absolute ethanol and a solution of oxalic acid (1 to 1.1 mmol) in 2 ml absolute ethanol was added. The precipitate was recrystallised from absolute ethanol.\n\n\nMethod N:\n\n\nA solution of 1-bromo-3-(4-substitutedphenoxy)propane (0.4 to 2 mmol) and the suitably substituted piperidine (2.5 to 8 mmol) in 10 ml absolute ethanol was stirred and heated under reflux for 6 to 24 hours. After cooling, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure, the residue diluted with aqueous NaOH (10 ml) and the oil was extracted with diethyl ether (3×10 ml). The combined extracts were dried over magnesium sulfate, and the solvent removed under reduced pressure. The residual oil was dissolved in about 5 ml diethyl ether and a solution of HCl in 10 ml diethyl ether was added. The precipitate was recrystallised from a 1:1 or 1:5 mixture of absolute ethanol and diethyl ether (examples 78, 79, 84, 87). The oil was purified by column chromatography on silica gel eluting with a mixture of 33% petroleum ether (60-80° C.), 66% diethyl ether and 1% triethylamine (examples 101 and 102) or with 99% diethyl ether and 1% triethylamine (examples 88, 94 and 95) and concentrated. The residual oil was dissolved in about 5 ml absolute ethanol and a solution of oxalic acid (1 to 1.6 mmol) in 5 ml absolute ethanol was added. The precipitate was recrystallised from absolute ethanol or from a 1:1 mixture of methanol and absolute ethanol (examples 83, 85, 86, 91, 93, 100, 101 and 102). The product was obtained as a sticky oil after removal of absolute ethanol (example 92).\n\n\nMethod O:\n\n\nA mixture of 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanone (200 mg, 1.2 mmol), 3-chloropropyl piperidine hydrochloride (200 mg, 1 mmol) and potassium carbonate (830 mg, 6 mmol) in 10 ml absolute ethanol was stirred and heated under reflux for 8 hours. After cooling, the reaction mixture was filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was diluted with aqueous sodium hydroxide and extracted with diethyl ether (3×10 ml). The combined extracts were dried over magnesium sulfate, and the solvent removed under reduced pressure. The free base was dissolved in diethyl ether and a solution of HCl in diethyl ether was added. The precipitate was recrystallised from acetone.\n\n\nMethod P:\n\n\nA solution of the ketone (0.4 mmol) in 10 ml methanol was stirred at 0° C. in an ice-bath. To this solution was added portionwise NaBH\n4 \n(1 mmol). The mixture was left to stir at room temperature for 16 hours. The solvent was removed, water (10 ml) was added to the residue and the product was extracted with chloroform (4×10 ml). The combined extracts were dried over magnesium sulfate, and the solvent removed under reduced pressure. The free base was dissolved in absolute ethanol (5 ml) and a solution of oxalic acid (1 mmol) in 5 ml absolute ethanol was added. The precipitate was recrystallised from absolute ethanol.\n\n\nMethod Q:\n\n\nSimilar to method J using methoxylamine in place of hydroxylamine. For example 105, the product was converted to the hydrochloride salt by addition of 2N HCl. The salt was recrystallised from absolute ethanol/diethyl ether (1:3).\n\n\nMethod R:\n\n\nSimilar to method P. The reduced product was converted to the hydrochloride salt by addition of 2N HCl. Then, the product was converted to the free base by addition of 10% aqueous NaOH. Then, the product was converted to the para-toluene sulfonate by addition of a solution of para-toluene sulfonic acid (1 mmol) in 5 ml absolute ethanol. The precipitate was recrystallised from absolute ethanol/diethyl ether (1:3).\n\n\nMethod S:\n\n\nSimilar to method P. The reduced product was converted to the para-toluene sulfonate by addition of a solution of para-toluene sulfonic acid (1 mmol) in 5 ml absolute ethanol. The precipitate was recrystallised from absolute ethanol/diethyl ether (1:3).\n\n\nIntermediates\n\n\n4-hydroxyphenyl)cyclopropyl ketone, Intermediate for Examples 76, 101 and 102\n\n\nS. N.

Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 1992, 263:304-310). The H\n3 \npotency of agonists is measured by the inhibition of tritiated histamine release and that of antagonists by the progressive reversal of release inhibition by the selective H\n3 \nagonist (R)α-methylhistamine (Arrang et al., Nature, 1987, 327:117-123).\n\n\nInteraction of compounds with the H\n3 \nreceptor are evidenced in vitro on guinea-pig ileum by the procedure described by Ligneau et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 271, 452-459 (1994).\n\n\nBriefly, longitudinal muscle strips from guinea-pig small intestine were dissected out and incubated in a gassed O\n2\n/CO\n2 \n(95%/5%) modified Krebs-Ringer's bicarbonate medium at +37° C. in presence of 1 μM mepyramine to block the H\n1 \nreceptor. After equilibration, contractile activity under stimulation (rectangular pulses of 15 V, 0.5 msec, 0.1 Hz) was recorded.\n\n\nConcentration-response curves of the effect of (R)α-Methylhistamine alone or together with the antagonist were established.\n\n\nThe effects of agonists and antagonists were estimated in vivo by the measurement of the tele-methylhistamine level variations in the brain of mice (Garbarg et al., J. Neurochem., 1989, 53: 1724-1730). At various time after p.o. administration of the compounds, the effect of agonists and antagonists are evidenced by the decrease and increase respectively in telemethylhistamine level induced.\n\n\nThe changes are compared to those induced by reference compounds given in high dosage and this allows the calculation of the ED\n50 \nvalue for each compound which correspond to the dose responsible for an half maximal effect.\n\n\nThe results are listed here-below or reported in the following tables II and III:\n\n \n \nexample 59: 1-[3-(4-cyanophenoxy)propyl]piperidine, ED\n50\n=0.02 mg/kg.\n \nexample 74: 1-[3-(4-buyrylphenoxy)propyl]piperidine, ED\n50\n=0.21 mg/kg\n \nexample 76: 1-[3-(4-cyclopropanecarbonylphenoxy)propyl]piperidine, ED\n50\n=0.18 mg/kg\n \nexample 88 :1-[3-(4-propionylphenoxy)propyl]-3-methylpiperidine, ED\n50\n=0.14 mg/kg\n \nexample 101: 1-[3-(4-cyclopropane carbonyl phenoxy) propyl]-trans-3,5 dimethylpiperidine, ED\n50\n=0.17 mg/kg\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE II\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nED\n50\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEx No.\n\n\nX\n\n\nn\n\n\nR\n1\nR\n2\n \n\n\nR\n3 \n(n\n3 \n= 1)\n\n\nKi (nM)\n\n\n(mg/kg/p.o.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\nO\n\n\n5\n\n\n—(CH\n2\n)\n4\n—\n\n\np-NO\n2\n \n\n\n39 ± 11\n\n\n1.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n43\n\n\nO\n\n\n3\n\n\nEt, Et\n\n\np-CN\n\n\n95 ± 28\n\n\n0.50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n46\n\n\nO\n\n\n3\n\n\nEt, Et\n\n\np-CH\n3\nCO\n\n\n20 ± 7 \n\n\n0.44\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50\n\n\nO\n\n\n5\n\n\n—(CH\n2\n)\n4\n—\n\n\np-CH\n3\nCH(OH)\n\n\n28 ± 7 \n\n\n1.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n56\n\n\nO\n\n\n4\n\n\nEt, Et\n\n\np-CN\n\n\n62 ± 15\n\n\n1.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n59\n\n\nO\n\n\n3\n\n\n—(CH\n2\n)\n5\n—\n\n\np-CN\n\n\n11 ± 2 \n\n\n0.20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n60\n\n\nO\n\n\n3\n\n\n—(CH\n2\n)\n6\n—\n\n\np-CN\n\n\n8.7 ± 2.1\n\n\n0.64\n\n\n\n\n\n\n63\n\n\nO\n\n\n3\n\n\nEt, Et\n\n\np-CH\n3\nCH(OH)\n\n\n60 ± 18\n\n\n0.45\n\n\n\n\n\n\n64\n\n\nO\n\n\n3\n\n\nEt, Et\n\n\np-CH\n3\nC═N(OH)\n\n\n2.7 ± 0.9\n\n\n0.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n66\n\n\nO\n\n\n3\n\n\n—(3-Me)—(CH\n2\n)\n5\n—\n\n\np-CH\n3\nCO\n\n\n3.7 ± 0.5\n\n\n0.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n68\n\n\nO\n\n\n3\n\n\n—(4-Me)—(CH\n2\n)\n5\n—\n\n\np-CH\n3\nCO\n\n\n4.6 ± 2.0\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n69\n\n\nO\n\n\n3\n\n\n—(CH\n2\n)\n5\n—\n\n\np-C\n2\nH\n5\nCO\n\n\n4.7 ± 0.8\n\n\n0.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE III\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExample\n\n\nH\n3\n-receptor antagonist activity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNo.\n\n\npA\n2 \n(guinea-pig ileum)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n120\n\n\n6.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n124\n\n\n6.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n130\n\n\n7.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n131\n\n\n6.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n136\n\n\n6.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll the above compounds were find to be H\n3\n-antagonists.\n\n\nComparative data concerning the activity of imidazole derivatives and of the non-imidazole analogues according to the invention, are reported below in Table IV:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE IV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nImidazole derivative\n\n\nNon-imidazole analogue according to the invention"

Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates generally to the generation and characterization of neutralizing anti-IFN-α monoclonal antibodies with broad reactivity against various IFN-α subtypes. The invention further relates to the use of such anti-IFN-α antibodies in the diagnosis and treatment of disorders associated with increased expression of IFN-α, in particular, autoimmune disorders such as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).\n\n\n \n\n\nDescription of the Related Art\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterferon-α (IFN-α)\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAlthough interferons were initially discovered for their anti-viral activities, subsequent research has unraveled a plethora of regulatory activities associated with these powerful cytokines. Type I interferons form an ancient family of cytokines that includes IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-δ, IFN-ω and IFN-τ (\nRoberts et al., J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 18: 805-816 [1998\n]). They are coded by intronless genes and are widely distributed amongst vertebrates. Whereas IFN-β is coded by a single gene in primates and rodents, more than 10 and 15 different subtypes of IFN-α have been found in mice and man respectively. Other interferons of type I are more restricted, e.g. IFN-δ in the pig, IFN-τ in cattle and sheep, and IFN-ω in cattle and humans. Thus, human type I interferons comprise multiple members of the IFN-α family, and single members of the IFN-β and IFN-ω families. All type I IFNs appear to bind to a single receptor that is comprised of at least two membrane spanning proteins. Type II interferons on the other hand are represented by a single member, IFN-γ, and bind to a distinct receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough all type I IFNs, including IFN-α, exhibit anti-viral and anti-proliferative activities and thereby help to control viral infections and tumors (\nLefevre et al., Biochimie 80: 779-788 [1998\n]; \nHorton et al., Cancer Res. 59: 4064-4068 [1999\n]; \nAlexenko et al., J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 17: 769-779 [1997\n]; \nGresser, J. Leukoc. Biol. 61: 567-574 [1997\n]), there are also several autoimmune diseases that are associated with increased expression of IFNα, most notably insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nType I diabetes, also known as autoimmune diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), is an autoimmune disease characterized by the selective destruction of pancreatic β cells by autoreactive T lymphocytes (\nBach, Endocr. Rev. 15: 516-542 [1994\n]; \nCastano and Eisenbarth, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 8: 647-679 [1990\n]; \nShehadeh and Lafferty, Diabetes Rev. 1: 141-151 [1993\n]). The pathology of IDDM is very complex involving an interaction between an epigenetic event (possibly a viral infection), the pancreatic β cells and the immune system in a genetically susceptible host. A number of cytokines, including IFN-α and IFN-γ, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of IDDM in humans and in animal models of the disease (\nCampbell et al., J. Clin. Invest. 87: 739-742 [1991\n]; \nHuang et al., Diabetes 44: 658-664 [1995\n]; \nRhodes and Taylor, Diabetologia 27: 601-603 [1984\n]). For example, pancreatic \nIfn-\nα mRNA expression and the presence of immunoreactive IFN-α in β cells of patients with IDDM have been reported (\nFoulis et al., Lancet 2: 1423-1427 [1987\n]; Huang \net al.,\n [1995] \nsupra\n; \nSomoza et al., J. Immunol. 153: 1360-1377 [1994\n]). IFN-α expression has been associated with hyperexpression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I\nA\n antigens in human islets (Foulis \net al\n., [1987] \nsupra\n; Somoza \net al\n., [1994] \nsupra\n). In two rodent models of autoimmune diabetes, the diabetes-prone DP-BB rat and streptozotocin-treated mice, \nIfn-\nα mRNA expression in islets precedes insulitis and diabetes (\nHuang et al., Immunity 1: 469-478 [1994\n]). Furthermore, transgenic mice harboring a hybrid human insulin promoter-Ifn-α construct develop hypoinsulinemic diabetes accompanied by insulitis (\nStewart et al., Science 260: 1942-1946 [1993\n]).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt appears that local expression of IFN-α by pancreatic islet cells in response to potential diabetogenic stimuli such as viruses may trigger the insulitic process. Consistent with its role as an initiating agent, IFN-α has been shown to induce intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and HLA class I\nA\n on endothelial cells from human islets, which may contribute to leukocyte infiltration during insulitis (\nChakrabarti et al., J. Immunol. 157: 522-528 [1996\n]). Furthermore, IFN-α facilitates T cell stimulation by the induction of the co-stimulatory molecules ICAM-1 and B7.2 on antigen-presenting cells in islets (\nChakrabarti et al., Diabetes 45: 1336-1343 [1996\n]). These studies collectively indicate that early IFN-α expression by β cells may be a critical event in the initiation of autoimmune diabetes. Although there are a number of reports implicating IFN-γ in the development of IDDM in rodent models, there is a poor correlation between the expression of this cytokine and human IDDM. Thus, cells expressing IFN-γ can be found in the islets of a subset of human patients selected for significant lymphocytic infiltration into the islets. In a group of patients that were not selected by this criterion there was no obvious association between IFN-γ expression and human IDDM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBased on the increased level of IFN-α expression in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), IFN-α has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of SLE (\nYtterberg and Schnitzer, Arthritis Rheum. 25: 401-406 [1982\n]; \nShi et al., Br. J. Dermatol. 117: 155-159 [1987\n]). It is interesting to note that IFN-α is currently used for the treatment of cancer as well as viral infection such as chronic hepatitis due to hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus infection. Consistent with the observations of increased levels of IFN-α triggering autoimmunity, significant increase in the appearance of autoimmune disorders such as IDDM, SLE and autoimmune thyroiditis has been reported in the patients undergoing IFN-α therapy. For example, prolonged use of IFN-α as an anti-viral therapy has been shown to induce IDDM (\nWaguri et al., Diabetes Res. Clin. Pract. 23: 33-36 [1994\n]; \nFabris et al., J. Hepatol. 28: 514-517 [1998\n]) or SLE (\nGarcia-Porrua et al., Clin. Exp. Rheumatol. 16: 107-108 [1998\n]). The treatment of coxsackievirus B (CBV) infection with IFN-α therapy is also associated with the induction of IDDM (\nChehadeh et al., J. Infect. Dis. 181: 1929-1939 [2000\n]). Similarly, there are multiple case reports documenting IDDM or SLE in IFN-α treated cancer patients (\nRonnblom et al., J. Intern. Med. 227: 207-210 [1990\n]).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAntibody therapy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe use of monoclonal antibodies as therapeutics has gained increased acceptance with several monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) either approved for human use or in late stage clinical trials. The first mAb approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of allograft rejection was anti-CD3 (OKT3) in 1986. Since then the pace of progress in the field of mAbs has been considerably accelerated, particularly from 1994 onwards which led to approval of additional seven mAbs for human treatment. These include ReoPro\n®\n for the management of complications of coronary angioplasty in 1994, Zenapax\n®\n (anti-CD25) for the prevention of allograft rejection in 1997, Rituxan\n®\n (anti-CD20) for the treatment of B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 1997, Infliximab\n®\n (anti-TNF-α) initially for the treatment of Crohn's disease in 1998 and subsequently for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in 1999, Simulect\n®\n (anti-CD25) for the prevention of allograft rejection in 1998, Synagis\n®\n (anti-F protein of respiratory syncitial virus) for the treatment of respiratory infections in 1998, and Herceptin\n®\n (anti-HER2/neu) for the treatment of HER2 overexpressing metastatic breast tumors in 1998 (\nGlennie and Johnson, Immunol. Today 21: 403-410 [2000\n]).\n\n\n \n\n\n \nAnti-IFN-\nα \nAntibodies\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nDisease states that are amenable to intervention with mAbs include all those in which there is a pathological level of a target antigen. For example, an antibody that neutralizes IFN-α present in the sera of patients with SLE, and expressed by the pancreatic islets in IDDM, is a potential candidate for therapeutic intervention in these diseases. It could also be used for therapeutic intervention in other autoimmune diseases with underlying increase in and causative role of IFN-α expression. In both human IDDM (\nFoulis, et al., Lancet 2: 1423-1427 [1987\n]; \nHuang, et al., Diabetes 44: 658-664 [1995\n]; \nSomoza, et al., J. Immunol. 153: 1360-1377 [1994\n]) and human SLE (\nHooks, et al., Arthritis & Rheumatism 25: 396-400 [1982\n]; \nKim, et al., Clin. Exp. Immunol. 70: 562-569 [1987\n]; \nLacki, et al., J. Med. 28: 99-107 [1997\n]; \nRobak, et al., Archivum Immunologiae et Therapiae Experimentalis 46: 375-380 [1998\n]; \nShiozawa, et al., Arthritis & Rheumatism 35: 417-422 [1992\n]; \nvon Wussow, et al., Rheumatology International 8: 225-230 [1988\n]) there appears to be correlation between disease and IFN-α but not with either IFN-β or IFN-γ. Thus, anti-interferon mAb intervention in IDDM or SLE would require specific neutralization of most, if not all, of the IFN-α subtypes, without any significant neutralization of IFN-β or IFN-γ. Leaving the activity of these last two interferons intact may also have an advantage in allowing the retention of significant anti-viral activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile a few mAbs that show reactivity with a range of recombinant human IFN-α subtypes have been described, these were found to neutralize only a limited subset of the recombinant IFN-α subtypes analyzed or were not capable of neutralizing the mixture of IFN-α subtypes that are produced by stimulated peripheral blood leukocytes (\nTsukui et al., Microbiol. Immunol. 30: 1129-1139 [1986\n]; \nBerg, J. Interferon Res. 4: 481-491 [1984\n]; \nMeager and Berg, J. Interferon Res. 6: 729-736 [1986\n]; \n \nUS Patent No. 4,902,618\n \n; and \n \nEP publication No. 0,139,676 B1\n \n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, there is a great need for anti-IFN-α antibodies that not only bind to most, preferably all, subtypes of IFN-α but also neutralize such subtypes while do not interfere with the biological function of other interferons.\n\n\n \n\n\nSummary of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention is based on the development of a monoclonal antibody that was experimentally found to neutralize all seven of different recombinant human IFN-α subtypes tested and two independent pools of natural human IFN-α subtypes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention provides an anti-human IFN-α monoclonal antibody which binds to and neutralizes a biological activity of at least human IFN-α subtypes IFN-α1, IFN-α2, IFN-α4, IFN-α5, IFN-α8, IFN-α10, and IFN-α21.

In another embodiment, the anti-human IFN-∀ monoclonal antibody does not cross-react with human IFN-3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe biological activity of the subject human IFN-α's may be an antiviral activity. In one embodiment, the anti-human IFN-∀ monoclonal antibody is capable of binding to and neutralizing the antiviral activity of all, or substantially all human IFN-α subtypes. In another embodiment, the anti-human IFN-∀ monoclonal antibody is capable of binding to and neutralizing the antiviral activity of each of human IFN-∀ \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsubtypes\n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10 and 21.

A higher cytopathic effect is indicative of a decrease in interferon activity. The results shown are the means of duplicate determinations.\n\n\n \nFig. 4\n depicts results of an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showing the induction of an ISGF3/ISRE complex by IFN-α and the ability of 9F3 mAb to prevent the formation of the complex. EMSA was performed in the presence or absence of either human IFN-α2 (denoted as \"α2\") or IFN-∃ (denoted as \"3\") at a concentration of 25 ng/ml with 9F3 mAb (denoted as \"9F3\") or murine IgG control antibody (denoted as \"IgG\") at a concentration of 10 : g/ml.\n\n\n \nFig. 5A\n shows the alignment of light chain variable domain amino acid sequences of murine 9F3 (murine, SEQ ID NO: 1), humanized 9F3 version 13 (V13, SEQ ID NO: 3), and the consensus human variable domain light K subgroup I (hukI, SEQ ID NO: 4).

The CDRs (H1, SEQ ID NO: 10; H2, SEQ ID NO: 11; and H3, SEQ ID NO: 12) are highlighted by underlining. The residue numbering is according to Kabat \net al.\n (1991) \nsupra.\n The differences between the murine 9F3 and V13 sequences and the differences between 9F3 and huIII sequences are indicated by asterisks.\n\n\n \nFig. 6\n shows neutralization activity of the starting mAb 9F3 (left panel) and the chimeric protein CH8-2 (right panel) toward the viral growth inhibition exhibited by recombinant IFN-α subtypes in A549 cells challenged with encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus.\n\n\n \nFig. 7\n depicts a model of humanized 9F3 version 13. Backbone of VL and VH domains is shown as a ribbon. CDRs are shown in white and are labeled (L1, L2, L3, H1, H2, H3). Framework side chains altered from human to murine are shown in white and are labeled by residue number.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment\n\n\n\n\nA. \nDefinitions\n \n\n\n \n \n \nUnless defined otherwise, technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. See, e.g. \nSingleton et al., Dictionary of Microbiology and Molecular Biology 2nd ed., J. Wiley & Sons (New York, NY 1994\n); \nSambrook et al., Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, Cold Springs Harbor Press (Cold Springs Harbor, NY 1989\n). For purposes of the present invention, the following terms are defined below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"type I interferon\" is defined to include all subtypes of native sequence type I interferons of any mammalian species, including interferon-α, interferon-β, interferon-δ, interferon-ω and interferon-τ. Similarly, the term \"human type I interferon\" is defined to include all subtypes of native sequence type I human interferons, including human interferon-α, interferon-β and interferon-ω classes and which bind to a common cellular receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnless otherwise expressly provided, the terms \"interferon-α,\" \"IFN-α,\" and \"human interferon-α\", \"human IFN-α\" and \"hIFN-∀\" are used herein to refer to all species of native sequence human alpha interferons, including all subtypes of native sequence human interferons-α. Natural (native sequence) human interferon-α comprises 23 or more closely related proteins encoded by distinct genes with a high degree of structural homology (\nWeissmann and Weber, Prog. Nucl. Acid. Res. Mol. Biol., 33: 251 [1986\n]; \nJ. Interferon Res., 13: 443-444 [1993\n]; \nRoberts et al., J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 18: 805-816 [1998\n]). The human IFN-α locus comprises two subfamilies. The first subfamily consists of at least 14 functional, non-allelic genes, including genes encoding IFN-αA (IFN-α2), IFN-αB (IFN-α8), IFN-αC (IFN-α10), IFN-αD (IFN-α1), IFN-αE (IFN-α22), IFN-αF (IFN-α21), IFN-αG (IFN-α5), and IFN-αH (IFN-α14), and pseudogenes having at least 80% homology. The second subfamily, α\nII\n, or T, contains at least 5 pseudogenes and one functional gene (denoted herein as \"IFN-\nα\n \n \n \nII\n1\" or \"IFN-T\") which exhibits 70% homology with the IFN-α genes (Weissmann and Weber [1986] \nsupra\n)\n.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the terms \"first human interferon-∀ (hIFN-∀) receptor\", \"IFN-∀R\", \"hIFNAR1\", \"IFNAR1\", and \"Uze chain\" are defined as the 557 amino acid receptor protein cloned by \nUze et al., Cell, 60: 225-234 (1990\n), including an extracellular domain of 409 residues, a transmembrane domain of 21 residues, and an intracellular domain of 100 residues, as shown in \nFig. 5\n on page 229 of Uze \net al.\n Also encompassed by the foregoing terms are fragments of IFNAR1 that contain the extracellular domain (ECD) (or fragments of the ECD) of IFNAR1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the terms \"second human interferon-∀ (hIFN-∀) receptor\", \"IFN-∀∃R\", \"hIFNAR2\", \"IFNAR2\", and \"Novick chain\" are defined as the 515 amino acid receptor protein cloned by \nDomanski et al., J. Biol. Chem., 37: 21606-21611 (1995\n), including an extracellular domain of 217 residues, a transmembrane domain of 21 residues, and an intracellular domain of 250 residues, as shown in \nFig. 1\n on page 21608 of Domanski \net al.\n Also encompassed by the foregoing terms are fragments of IFNAR2 that contain the extracellular domain (ECD) (or fragments of the ECD) of IFNAR2, and soluble forms of IFNAR2, such as IFNAR2 ECD fused to an immunoglobulin sequence, e.g. IFNAR2 ECD-IgG Fc as described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"native sequence\" in connection with type I interferon, IFN-α or any other polypeptide refers to a polypeptide that has the same amino acid sequence as a corresponding polypeptide derived from nature, regardless of its mode of preparation. Such native sequence polypeptide can be isolated from nature or can be produced by recombinant and/or synthetic means or any combinations thereof. The term \"native sequence\" specifically encompasses naturally-occurring truncated or secreted forms (\ne.g\n., an extracellular domain sequence), naturally-occurring variant forms (\ne.g\n., alternatively spliced forms) and naturally-occurring allelic variants of the full length polypeptides. \"Polymerase chain reaction\" or \"PCR\" refers to a procedure or technique in which minute amounts of a specific piece of nucleic acid, RNA and/or DNA, are amplified as described in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,683,195 issued 28 July 1987\n \n. Generally, sequence information from the ends of the region of interest or beyond needs to be available, such that oligonucleotide primers can be designed; these primers will be identical or similar in sequence to opposite strands of the template to be amplified. The 5' terminal nucleotides of the two primers can coincide with the ends of the amplified material. PCR can be used to amplify specific RNA sequences, specific DNA sequences from total genomic DNA, and cDNA transcribed from total cellular RNA, bacteriophage or plasmid sequences, etc. See generally \nMullis et al., Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 51:263 (1987\n); \nErlich, ed., PCR Technology (Stockton Press, NY, 1989\n). As used herein, PCR is considered to be one, but not the only, example of a nucleic acid polymerase reaction method for amplifying a nucleic acid test sample comprising the use of a known nucleic acid as a primer and a nucleic acid polymerase to amplify or generate a specific piece of nucleic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Antibodies\" (Abs) and \"immunoglobulins\" (Igs) are glycoproteins having the same structural characteristics. While antibodies exhibit binding specificity to a specific antigen, immunoglobulins include both antibodies and other antibody-like molecules which lack antigen specificity. Polypeptides of the latter kind are, for example, produced at low levels by the lymph system and at increased levels by myelomas.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Native antibodies and immunoglobulins\" are usually heterotetrameric glycoproteins of about 150,000 daltons, composed of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains. Each light chain is linked to a heavy chain by one covalent disulfide bond, while the number of disulfide linkages varies between the heavy chains of different immunoglobulin isotypes. Each heavy and light chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain (VH) followed by a number of constant domains. Each light chain has a variable domain at one end (VL) and a constant domain at its other end; the constant domain of the light chain is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain, and the light chain variable domain is aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain. Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light- and heavy-chain variable domains (\nChothia et al., J. Mol. Biol. 186:651 [1985\n]; \nNovotny and Haber, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 82:4592 [1985\n]; \nChothia et al., Nature 342: 877-883 [1989\n]).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"variable\" refers to the fact that certain portions of the variable domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies and are used in the binding and specificity of each particular antibody for its particular antigen. However, the variability is not evenly distributed throughout the variable domains of antibodies. It is concentrated in three segments called complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) or hypervariable regions both in the light-chain and the heavy-chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of variable domains are called the framework (FR). The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FR regions, largely adopting a β-sheet configuration, connected by three CDRs, which form loops connecting, and in some cases forming part of, the β-sheet structure. The CDRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FR regions and, with the CDRs from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen-binding site of antibodies (see Kabat \net al.\n (1991) \nsupra\n)\n.\n The constant domains are not involved directly in binding an antibody to an antigen, but exhibit various effector functions, such as participation of the antibody in antibody-dependent cellular toxicity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPapain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen-binding fragments, called \"Fab\" fragments, each with a single antigen-binding site, and a residual \"Fc\" fragment, whose name reflects its ability to crystallize readily. Pepsin treatment yields an F(ab')\n2\n fragment that has two antigen-combining sites and is still capable of cross-linking antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Fv\" is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen-recognition and -binding site. In a two-chain Fv species, this region consists of a dimer of one heavy- and one light-chain variable domain in tight, non-covalent association. In a single-chain Fv species, one heavy- and one light-chain variable domain can be covalently linked by a flexible peptide linker such that the light and heavy chains can associate in a \"dimeric\" structure analogous to that in a two-chain Fv species. It is in this configuration that the three CDRs of each variable domain interact to define an antigen-binding site on the surface of the VH-VL dimer. Collectively, the six CDRs confer antigen-binding specificity to the antibody. However, even a single variable domain (or half of an Fv comprising only three CDRs specific for an antigen) has the ability to recognize and bind antigen, although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Fab fragment also contains the constant domain of the light chain and the first constant domain (CH1) of the heavy chain. Fab' fragments differ from Fab fragments by the addition of a few residues at the carboxy terminus of the heavy chain CH1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab'-SH is the designation herein for Fab' in which the cysteine residue(s) of the constant domains bear a free thiol group. F(ab')\n2\n antibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab' fragments which have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe \"light chains\" of antibodies (immunoglobulins) from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types, called κ and λ, based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDepending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains, immunoglobulins can be assigned to different classes. There are five major classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several of these can be further divided into subclasses (isotypes), e.g., IgG\n1\n, IgG\n2\n, IgG\n3\n, IgG\n4\n, IgA\n1\n, and IgA\n2\n. The heavy-chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called α, δ, ε, γ, and µ respectively. The subunit structures and three-dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"antibody\" includes all classes and subclasses of intact immunoglobulins. The term \"antibody\" also covers antibody fragments. The term \"antibody\" specifically covers monoclonal antibodies, including antibody fragment clones.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Antibody fragments\" comprise a portion of an intact antibody that contains the antigen binding or variable region of the intact antibody. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab', F(ab')\n2\n, and Fv fragments; diabodies; single-chain antibody molecules, including single-chain Fv (scFv) molecules; and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"monoclonal antibody\" as used herein refers to an antibody (or antibody fragment) obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore, in contrast to conventional (polyclonal) antibody preparations which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity, the monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they are synthesized by the hybridoma culture, and are not contaminated by other immunoglobulins. The modifier \"monoclonal\" indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by the hybridoma method first described by \nKohler et al., Nature, 256:495 (1975\n), or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (see, \ne.g.,\n \n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,816,567\n \n). The \"monoclonal antibodies\" also include clones of antigen-recognition and binding-site containing antibody fragments (Fv clones) isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in \nClackson et al., Nature, 352:624-628 (1991\n) and \nMarks et al., J. Mol. Biol., 222:581-597 (1991\n), for example.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include \"chimeric\" antibodies (immunoglobulins) in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (\n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,816,567 to Cabilly et al\n \n.; \nMorrison et al., Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA, 81:6851-6855 [1984\n]).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Humanized\" forms of non-human (\ne.g\n., murine) antibodies are chimeric immunoglobulins, immunoglobulin chains or fragments thereof (such as Fv, Fab, Fab', F(ab')\n2\n or other antigen-binding subsequences of antibodies) which contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. For the most part, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from part or all of a complementarity-determining region (CDR) of the recipient are replaced by residues from a CDR of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat or rabbit having the desired specificity, affinity, and capacity. In some instances, Fv framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues which are found neither in the recipient antibody nor in the imported CDR or framework sequences. These modifications are made to further refine and optimize antibody performance. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optimally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details, see \nJones et al., Nature, 321:522-525 (1986\n); \nReichmann et al., Nature, 332:323-329 (1988\n); \nPresta, Curr. Op. Struct. Biol., 2:593-596 (1992\n); and \nClark, Immunol. Today 21: 397-402 (2000\n). The humanized antibody includes a Primatized\n™\n antibody wherein the antigen-binding region of the antibody is derived from an antibody produced by immunizing macaque monkeys with the antigen of interest.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Single-chain Fv\" or \"scFv\" antibody fragments comprise the VH and VL domains of antibody, wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. Generally, the scFv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the VH and VL domains, which enables the scFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of scFv see \nPluckthun, in The Pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibodies, vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds., Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315 (1994\n), \nDall'Acqua and Carter, Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 8: 443-450 (1998\n), and \nHudson, Curr. Opin. Immunol. 11: 548-557 (1999\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"diabodies\" refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites, which fragments comprise a heavy-chain variable domain (VH) connected to a light-chain variable domain (VL) in the same polypeptide chain (VH - VL). By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain, the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen-binding sites. Diabodies are described more fully in, for example, \n \nEP 404,097\n \n; \n \nWO 93/11161\n \n; and \nHollinger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90:6444-6448 (1993\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn \"isolated\" antibody is one which has been identified and separated and/or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials which would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments, the antibody will be purified (1) to greater than 95% by weight of antibody as determined by the Lowry method, and most preferably more than 99% by weight, (2) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues ofN-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions using Coomassie blue or, preferably, silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody \nin situ\n within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody's natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily, however, isolated antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy \"neutralizing antibody\" is meant an antibody molecule which is able to eliminate or significantly reduce an effector function of a target antigen to which it binds. Accordingly, a \"neutralizing\" anti-IFN-α antibody is capable of eliminating or significantly reducing an effector function, such as receptor binding and/or elicitation of a cellular response, of IFN-α.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the purpose of the present invention, the ability of an anti-IFN-α antibody to neutralize the receptor activation activity of IFN-α can be monitored, for example, in a Kinase Receptor Activation (KIRA) Assay as described in \n \nWO 95/14930, published June 1, 1995\n \n, by measuring the ability of a candidate antibody to reduce tyrosine phosphorylation (resulting from ligand binding) of the IFNAR1/R2 receptor complex.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the purpose of the present invention, the ability of the anti-IFN-α antibodies to neutralize the elicitation of a cellular response by IFN-α is preferably tested by monitoring the neutralization of the antiviral activity of IFN-α, as described by \nKawade, J. Interferon Res. 1:61-70 (1980\n), or \nKawade and Watanabe, J. Interferon Res. 4:571-584 (1984\n), or \nYousefi, et al., Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 83: 735-740 (1985\n), or by testing the ability of an anti-IFN-α antibody to neutralize the ability of IFN-α to activate the binding of the signaling molecule, interferon-stimulated factor 3 (ISGF3), to an oligonucleotide derived from the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE), in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, as described by \nKurabayashi et al., Mol. Cell Biol., 15: 6386 (1995\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Significant\" reduction means at least about 60%, or at least about 70%, preferably at least about 75%, more preferably at least about 80%, even more preferably at least about 85%, still more preferably at least about 90%, still more preferably at least about 95%, most preferably at least about 99% reduction of an effector function of the target antigen (e.g. IFN-α), such as receptor (e.g. IFNAR2) binding and/or elicitation of a cellular response. Preferably, the \"neutralizing\" antibodies as defined herein will be capable of neutralizing at least about 60%, or at least about 70%, preferably at least about 75%, more preferably at least about 80%, even more preferably at least about 85%, still more preferably at least about 90%, still more preferably at least about 95%, most preferably at least about 99% of the anti-viral activity of IFN-α, as determined by the anti-viral assay of Kawade (1980), \nsupra,\n or Yousefi (1985), \nsupra.\n In another preferred embodiment, the \"neutralizing\" antibodies herein will be capable of reducing tyrosine phosphorylation, due to IFN-α binding, of the IFNAR1/IFNAR2 receptor complex, by at least about 60%, or at least about 70%, preferably at least about 75%, more preferably at least about 80%; even more preferably at least about 85%, still more preferably at least about 90%, still more preferably at least about 95%, most preferably at least about 99%, as determined in the KIRA assay referenced above. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the neutralizing anti-IFN-α antibodies herein will be able to neutralize all, or substantially all, subtypes of IFN-α and will not be able to neutralize IFN-3. In this context, the term \"substantially all\" means that the neutralizing anti-IFN-α antibody will neutralize at least IFN-α1, IFN-α2, IFN-α4, IFN-α5, IFN-α8, IFN-α10, and IFN-α21.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the purpose of the present invention, the ability of an anti-IFN-α antibody to block the binding of an IFN-α to receptor is defined as the property or capacity of a certain concentration of the antibody to reduce or eliminate the binding of IFN-α to IFNAR2 in a competition binding assay, as compared to the effect of an equivalent concentration of irrelevant control antibody on IFN-α binding to IFNAR2 in the assay. Preferably, the blocking anti-IFN-α antibody reduces the binding of IFN-α to IFNAR2 by at least about 50%, or at least about 55%, or at least about 60%, or at least about 65%, or at least about 70%, or at least about 75%, or at least about 80%, or at least about 85%, or at least about 90%, or at least about 95%, or at least about 99%, as compared to the irrelevant control antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the purpose of the present invention, the ability of an anti-IFN-α antibody to block the binding of IFN-α to IFNAR2 can be determined by a routine competition assay such as that described in \nAntibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Ed Harlow and David Lane (1988\n). For example, the IFN-α-binding ELISA assay described in Example 2 below could be modified to employ competition binding between an anti-IFN-α antibody and a soluble IFNAR2. Such an assay could be performed by layering the IFN-α on microtiter plates, incubating the layered plates with serial dilutions of unlabeled anti-IFN-α antibody or unlabeled control antibody admixed with a selected concentration of labeled IFNAR2 ECD-human IgG Fc fusion protein, detecting and measuring the signal in each incubation mixture, and then comparing the signal measurements exhibited by the various dilutions of antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a particularly preferred embodiment, the blocking anti-IFN-α antibodies herein will be able to block the IFNAR2-binding of all, or substantially all, subtypes of IFN-α and will not cross-react with IFN-β. In this context, the term \"substantially all\" means that the blocking anti-IFN-α antibody will block the IFNAR2-binding of at least IFN-α1, IFN-α2, IFN-α4, IFN-α5, IFN-α8, IFN-α10, and IFN-α21. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the blocking anti-IFN-α antibodies of the present invention will block the IFNAR2-binding of all known subtypes of IFN-α.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"epitope\" is used to refer to binding sites for (monoclonal or polyclonal) antibodies on protein antigens.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies which bind to a particular epitope can be identified by \"epitope mapping.\" There are many methods known in the art for mapping and characterizing the location of epitopes on proteins, including solving the crystal structure of an antibody-antigen complex, competition assays, gene fragment expression assays, and synthetic peptide-based assays, as described, for example, in \nChapter 11 of Harlow and Lane, Using Antibodies, a Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York, 1999\n. Competition assays are discussed above and below. According to the gene fragment expression assays, the open reading frame encoding the protein is fragmented either randomly or by specific genetic constructions and the reactivity of the expressed fragments of the protein with the antibody to be tested is determined. The gene fragments may, for example, be produced by PCR and then transcribed and translated into protein \nin vitro,\n in the presence of radioactive amino acids. The binding of the antibody to the radioactively labeled protein fragments is then determined by immunoprecipitation and gel electrophoresis. Certain epitopes can also be identified by using large libraries of random peptide sequences displayed on the surface of phage particles (phage libraries). Alternatively, a defined library of overlapping peptide fragments can be tested for binding to the test antibody in simple binding assays. The latter approach is suitable to define linear epitopes of about 5 to 15 amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn antibody binds \"essentially the same epitope\" as a reference antibody, when the two antibodies recognize identical or sterically overlapping epitopes. The most widely used and rapid methods for determining whether two epitopes bind to identical or sterically overlapping epitopes are competition assays, which can be configured in all number of different formats, using either labeled antigen or labeled antibody. Usually, the antigen is immobilized on a 96-well plate, and the ability of unlabeled antibodies to block the binding of labeled antibodies is measured using radioactive or enzyme labels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term amino acid or amino acid residue, as used herein, refers to naturally occurring L amino acids or to D amino acids as described further below with respect to variants. The commonly used one- and three-letter abbreviations for amino acids are used herein (\nBruce Alberts et al., Molecular Biology of the Cell, Garland Publishing, Inc., New York (3d ed. 1994\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Percent (%) amino acid sequence identity\" with respect to the polypeptide sequences referred to herein is defined as the percentage of amino acid residues in a candidate sequence that are identical with the amino acid residues in a sequence, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity, and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity. Alignment for purposes of determining percent amino acid sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art, for instance, using publicly available computer software such as BLAST, BLAST-2, ALIGN, ALIGN-2 or Megalign (DNASTAR) software. Those skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters for measuring alignment, including any algorithms needed to achieve maximal alignment over the full-length of the sequences being compared. For purposes herein, however, % amino acid sequence identity values are obtained as described below by using the sequence comparison computer program ALIGN-2. The ALIGN-2 sequence comparison computer program was authored by Genentech, Inc. and its source code has been filed with user documentation in the U.S. Copyright Office, Washington D.C., 20559, where it is registered under U.S. Copyright Registration No. TXU510087. The ALIGN-2 program is publicly available through Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, California, and the source code for the ALIGN-2 program and instructions for its use are disclosed in International Application Publication No. \n \nWO2000/39297 published July 6, 2000\n \n. The ALIGN-2 program should be compiled for use on a UNIX operating system, preferably digital UNIX V4.0D. All sequence comparison parameters are set by the ALIGN-2 program and do not vary.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor purposes herein, the % amino acid sequence identity of a given amino acid sequence A to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B (which can alternatively be phrased as a given amino acid sequence A that has or comprises a certain % amino acid sequence identity to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B) is calculated as follows:\n\n \n \n \n100 times the fraction X/Y\n \n\nwhere X is the number of amino acid residues scored as identical matches by the sequence alignment program ALIGN-2 in that program's alignment of A and B, and where Y is the total number of amino acid residues in B. It will be appreciated that where the length of amino acid sequence A is not equal to the length of amino acid sequence B, the % amino acid sequence identity of A to B will not equal the % amino acid sequence identity of B to A. Unless specifically stated otherwise, all % amino acid sequence identity values used herein are obtained as described above using the ALIGN-2 sequence comparison computer program. However, % amino acid sequence identity may also be determined using the sequence comparison program NCBI-BLAST2 (\nAltschul et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 25:3389-3402 (1997\n)). The NCBI-BLAST2 sequence comparison program may be downloaded from http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. NCBI-BLAST2 uses several search parameters, wherein all of those search parameters are set to default values including, for example, unmask = yes, strand = all, expected occurrences = 10, minimum low complexity length = 15/5, multi-pass e-value = 0.01, constant for multi-pass = 25, dropoff for final gapped alignment = 25 and scoring matrix = BLOSUM62.\n    \n \n \n \nIn situations where NCBI-BLAST2 is employed for amino acid sequence comparisons, the % amino acid sequence identity of a given amino acid sequence A to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B (which can alternatively be phrased as a given amino acid sequence A that has or comprises a certain % amino acid sequence identity to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B) is calculated as follows:\n\n \n \n \n100 times the fraction X/Y\n \n\nwhere X is the number of amino acid residues scored as identical matches by the sequence alignment program NCBI-BLAST2 in that program's alignment of A and B, and where Y is the total number of amino acid residues in B. It will be appreciated that where the length of amino acid sequence A is not equal to the length of amino acid sequence B, the % amino acid sequence identity of A to B will not equal the % amino acid sequence identity of B to A.\n    \n \n \n \nNucleic acid is \"operably linked\" when it is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For example, DNA for a presequence or secretory leader is operably linked to DNA for a polypeptide if it is expressed as a preprotein that participates in the secretion of the polypeptide; a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the sequence; or a ribosome binding site is operably linked to a coding sequence if it is positioned so as to facilitate translation. Generally, \"operably linked\" means that the DNA sequences being linked are contiguous, and, in the case of a secretory leader, contiguous and in reading phase. However, enhancers do not have to be contiguous. Linking is accomplished by ligation at convenient restriction sites. If such sites do not exist, the synthetic oligonucleotide adaptors or linkers are used in accordance with conventional practice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"disease state\" refers to a physiological state of a cell or of a whole mammal in which an interruption, cessation, or disorder of cellular or body functions, systems, or organs has occurred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"effective amount\" refers to an amount of a drug effective to treat (including prevention) of a disease, disorder or unwanted physiological conditions in a mammal. In the present invention, an \"effective amount\" of an anti-IFN-α antibody may reduce, slow down or delay an autoimmune disorder such as IDDM or SLE; reduce, prevent or inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) the development of an autoimmune disorder such as IDDM or SLE; and/or relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with autoimmune disorders such as IDDM or SLE.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the methods of the present invention, the term \"control\" and grammatical variants thereof, are used to refer to the prevention, partial or complete inhibition, reduction, delay or slowing down of an unwanted event, e.g. physiological condition, such as the generation of autoreactive T cells and development of autoimmunity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Treatment\" refers to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures. Those in need of treatment include those already with the disorder as well as those prone to have the disorder or those in which the disorder is to be prevented. For purposes of this invention, beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to, alleviation of symptoms, diminishment of extent of disease, stabilized (i.e., not worsening) state of disease, delay or slowing of disease progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state, and remission (whether partial or total), whether detectable or undetectable. \"Treatment\" can also mean prolonging survival as compared to expected survival if not receiving treatment. Those in need of treatment include those already with the condition or disorder as well as those prone to have the condition or disorder or those in which the condition or disorder is to be prevented.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Pharmaceutically acceptable\" carriers, excipients, or stabilizers are ones which are nontoxic to the cell or mammal being exposed thereto at the dosages and concentrations employed. Often the physiologically acceptable carrier is an aqueous pH buffered solution. Examples of physiologically acceptable carriers include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid; low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, arginine or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugar alcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol; salt-forming counterions such as sodium; and/or nonionic surfactants such as Tween™, polyethylene glycol (PEG), and Pluronics™.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Mammal\" for purposes of treatment refers to any animal classified as a mammal, including humans, domestic and farm animals, and zoo, sports, or pet animals, such as dogs, horses, cats, cows, \netc.\n Preferably, the mammal is human.\n\n\n \nB. \nMethods for carrying out the \ninvention\n \n \n\n\n1. Generation of Antibodies\n\n\n\n\n(i) Polyclonal antibodies\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMethods of preparing polyclonal antibodies are known in the art. Polyclonal antibodies can be raised in a mammal, for example, by one or more injections of an immunizing agent and, if desired, an adjuvant. Typically, the immunizing agent and/or adjuvant will be injected in the mammal by multiple subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injections. It may be useful to conjugate the immunizing agent to a protein known to be immunogenic in the mammal being immunized, such as serum albumin, or soybean trypsin inhibitor. Examples of adjuvants which may be employed include Freund's complete adjuvant and MPL-TDM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another preferred embodiment, animals are immunized with a mixture of various, preferably all, IFN-α subtypes in order to generate anti-IFN-α antibodies with broad reactivity against IFN-α subtypes. In another preferred embodiment, animals are immunized with the mixture of human IFN-α subtypes that is present in the human lymphoblastoid interferons secreted by Burkitt lymphoma cells (Namalva cells) induced with Sendai virus, as described in Example 1 below. A suitable preparation of such human lymphoblastoid interferons can be obtained commercially (Product No. I-9887) from Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, MO.\n\n\n \n\n\n(ii) Monoclonal antibodies\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMonoclonal antibodies may be made using the hybridoma method first described by \nKohler et al., Nature 256: 495 (1975\n), or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (\n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,816,567\n \n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the hybridoma method, a mouse or other appropriate host animal, such as a hamster or macaque monkey, is immunized as hereinabove described to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the protein used for immunization. Alternatively, lymphocytes may be immunized \nin vitro.\n Lymphocytes then are fused with myeloma cells using a suitable fusing agent, such as polyethylene glycol, to form a hybridoma cell (\nGoding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, pp.59-103, [Academic Press, 1996\n]).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe hybridoma cells thus prepared are seeded and grown in a suitable culture medium that preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused, parental myeloma cells. For example, if the parental myeloma cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (HAT medium), which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred myeloma cells are those that fuse efficiently, support stable high-level production of antibody by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. Among these, preferred myeloma cell lines are murine myeloma lines, such as those derived from MOP-21 and MC.-11 mouse tumors available from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, California USA, and SP-2 or X63-Ag8-653 cells available from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Maryland USA. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies (\nKozbor, J. Immunol. 133: 3001 (1984\n); \nBrodeur et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, pp. 51-63, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, [1987\n]).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCulture medium in which hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production of monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen. Preferably, the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an \nin vitro\n binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can, for example, be determined by the Scatchard analysis of \nMunson et al., Anal. Biochem. 107: 220 (1980\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter hybridoma cells are identified that produce antibodies of the desired specificity, affinity, and/or activity, the cells may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods (\nGoding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, pp.59-103, Academic Press, 1996\n). Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, DMEM or RPMI-1640 medium. In addition, the hybridoma cells may be grown \nin vivo\n as ascites tumors in an animal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones are suitably separated from the culture medium, ascites fluid, or serum by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as, for example, protein A-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, or affinity chromatography.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (\ne.g\n., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the monoclonal antibodies). The hybridoma cells serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA may be placed into expression vectors, which are then transfected into host cells such as \nE\n. \ncoli\n cells, simian COS cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein, to obtain the synthesis of monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells. The DNA also may be modified, for example, by substituting the coding sequence for human heavy and light chain constant domains in place of the homologous murine sequences (\nMorrison, et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 81: 6851 [1984\n]), or by covalently joining to the immunoglobulin coding sequence all or part of the coding sequence for a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide. In that manner, \"chimeric\" or \"hybrid\" antibodies are prepared that have the binding specificity of an anti-IFN-α monoclonal antibody herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypically such non-immunoglobulin polypeptides are substituted for the constant domains of an antibody of the invention, or they are substituted for the variable domains of one antigen-combining site of an antibody of the invention to create a chimeric bivalent antibody comprising one antigen-combining site having specificity for an IFN-α and another antigen-combining site having specificity for a different antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChimeric or hybrid antibodies also may be prepared \nin vitro\n using known methods in synthetic protein chemistry, including those involving crosslinking agents. For example, immunotoxins may be constructed using a disulfide exchange reaction or by forming a thioether bond. Examples of suitable reagents for this purpose include iminothiolate and methyl-4-mercaptobutyrimidate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecombinant production of antibodies will be described in more detail below.\n\n\n \n\n\n(iii) Humanized antibodies\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nGenerally, a humanized antibody has one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a non-human source. These non-human amino acid residues are often referred to as \"import\" residues, which are typically taken from an \"import\" variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co-workers by substituting rodent CDRs or CDR sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody (\nJones et al., Nature 321: 522-525 [1986\n]; \nRiechmann et al., Nature 332: 323-327 [1988\n]; \nVerhoeyen et al., Science 239: 1534-1536 [1988\n)]; reviewed in \nClark, Immunol. Today 21: 397-402 [2000\n]).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, such \"humanized\" antibodies are chimeric antibodies (Cabilly, \nsupra\n), wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non-human species. In practice, humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some CDR residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is important that antibodies be humanized with retention of high affinity for the antigen and other favorable biological properties. To achieve this goal, according to a preferred method, humanized antibodies are prepared by a process of analysis of the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized products using three-dimensional models of the parental and humanized sequences. Three dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable three-dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence, i.e. the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way, FR residues can be selected and combined from the consensus and import sequence so that the desired antibody characteristic, such as increased affinity for the target antigen(s), is achieved. In general, the CDR residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding. For further details, see \n \nU.S. patent No. 5,821,337\n \n.\n\n\n \n\n\n(iv) Human antibodies\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAttempts to use the same technology for generating human mAbs have been hampered by the lack of a suitable human myeloma cell line. The best results were obtained using heteromyelomas (mouse x human hybrid myelomas) as fusion partners (\nKozbor, J. Immunol. 133: 3001 (1984\n); \nBrodeur, et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, pp.51-63, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987\n). Alternatively, human antibody-secreting cells can be immortalized by infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). However, EBV-infected cells are difficult to clone and usually produce only relatively low yields of immunoglobulin (\nJames and Bell, J. Immunol. Methods 100: 5-40 [1987\n]). In future, the immortalization of human B cells might possibly be achieved by introducing a defined combination of transforming genes. Such a possibility is highlighted by a recent demonstration that the expression of the telomerase catalytic subunit together with the SV40 large T oncoprotein and an oncogenic allele of H-\nras\n resulted in the tumorigenic conversion of normal human epithelial and fibroblast cells (\nHahn et al., Nature 400: 464-468 [1999\n]).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is now possible to produce transgenic animals (e.g. mice) that are capable, upon immunization, of producing a repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production (\nJakobovits et al., Nature 362: 255-258 [1993\n]; \nLonberg and Huszar, Int. Rev. Immunol. 13: 65-93 [1995\n]; \nFishwild et al., Nat. Biotechnol. 14: 845-851 [1996\n]; \nMendez et al., Nat. Genet. 15: 146-156 [1997\n]; \nGreen, J. Immunol. Methods 231: 11-23 [1999\n]; \nTomizuka et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97: 722-727 [2000\n]; reviewed in \nLittle et al., Immunol. Today 21: 364-370 [2000\n]). For example, it has been described that the homozygous deletion of the antibody heavy chain joining region (J\nH\n) gene in chimeric and germ-line mutant mice results in complete inhibition of endogenous antibody production (\nJakobovits et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90: 2551-2555 [1993\n]). Transfer of the human germ-line immunoglobulin gene array in such germ-line mutant mice results in the production of human antibodies upon antigen challenge (\nJakobovits et al., Nature 362: 255-258 [1993\n]).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nMendez et al. (Nature Genetics 15: 146-156 [1997\n]) have generated a line of transgenic mice designated as \"XenoMouse\n®\n II\" that, when challenged with an antigen, generates high affinity fully human antibodies. This was achieved by germ-line integration of megabase human heavy chain and light chain loci into mice with deletion into endogenous J\nH\n segment as described above. The XenoMouse\n®\n II harbors 1,020 kb of human heavy chain locus containing approximately 66 V\nH\n genes, complete D\nH\n and J\nH\n regions and three different constant regions (µ, δ and γ), and also harbors 800 kb of human κ locus containing 32 Vκ genes, Jκ segments and Cκ genes. The antibodies produced in these mice closely resemble that seen in humans in all respects, including gene rearrangement, assembly, and repertoire. The human antibodies are preferentially expressed over endogenous antibodies due to deletion in endogenous J\nH\n segment that prevents gene rearrangement in the murine locus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nTomizuka et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97: 722-727 [2000\n]) have recently described generation of a double trans-chromosomic (Tc) mice by introducing two individual human chromosome fragments (hCFs), one containing the entire Ig heavy chain locus (\nIgH\n, ∼1.5 Mb) and the other the entire κ light chain locus (\nIg\nκ, ∼2 Mb) into a mouse strain whose endogenous IgH and \nIg\nκ loci were inactivated. These mice mounted antigen-specific human antibody response in the absence of mouse antibodies. The Tc technology may allow for the humanization of over megabase-sized, complex loci or gene clusters (such as those encoding T-cell receptors, major histocompatibility complex, P450 cluster etc) in mice or other animals. Another advantage of the method is the elimination of a need of cloning the large loci. This is a significant advantage since the cloning of over megabase-sized DNA fragments encompassing whole Ig loci remains difficult even with the use of yeast artificial chromosomes (\nPeterson et al., Trends Genet. 13: 61-66 [1997\n]; \nJacobovits, Curr. Biol. 4: 761-763 [1994\n]). Moreover, the constant region of the human IgH locus is known to contain sequences difficult to clone (\nKang and Cox, Genomics 35: 189-195 [1996\n]).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the phage display technology can be used to produce human antibodies and antibody fragments \nin vitro,\n from immunoglobulin variable (V) domain gene repertoires from unimmunized donors (\nMcCafferty et al., Nature 348: 552-553 [1990\n]; reviewed in \nKipriyanov and Little, Mol. Biotechnol. 12: 173-201 [1999\n]; \nHoogenboom and Chames, Immunol. Today 21: 371-378 [2000\n]). According to this technique, antibody V domain genes are cloned in-frame into either a major or minor coat protein gene of a filamentous bacteriophage, such as M13 or fd, and displayed as functional antibody fragments on the surface of the phage particle. Because the filamentous particle contains a single-stranded DNA copy of the phage genome, selections based on the functional properties of the antibody also result in selection of the gene encoding the antibody exhibiting those properties. Thus, the phage mimics some of the properties of the B-cell. Phage display can be performed in a variety of formats (reviewed in \nJohnson and Chiswell, Current Opinion in Structural Biology 3: 564-571 [1993\n)]; \nWinter et al., Annu. Rev. Immunol. 12: 433-455 [1994\n]; \nDall'Acqua and Carter, Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 8: 443-450 [1998\n]; \nHoogenboom and Chames, Immunol. Today 21: 371-378 [2000\n]). Several sources of V-gene segments can be used for phage display. \nClackson et al., (Nature 352: 624-628 [1991\n]) isolated a diverse array of anti-oxazolone antibodies from a small random combinatorial library of V genes derived from the spleens of immunized mice. A repertoire of V genes from unimmunized human donors can be constructed and antibodies to a diverse array of antigens (including self-antigens) can be isolated essentially following the techniques described by \nMarks et al., J. Mol. Biol. 222: 581-597 (1991\n), or \nGriffiths et al., EMBO J. 12: 725-734 (1993\n). In a natural immune response, antibody genes accumulate mutations at a high rate (somatic hypermutation). Some of the changes introduced will confer higher affinity, and B cells displaying high-affinity surface immunoglobulin are preferentially replicated and differentiated during subsequent antigen challenge. This natural process can be mimicked by employing the technique known as \"chain shuffling\" (\nMarks et al., Bio/Technol. 10: 779-783 [1992\n]). In this method, the affinity of \"primary\" human antibodies obtained by phage display can be improved by sequentially replacing the heavy and light chain V region genes with repertoires of naturally occurring variants (repertoires) of V domain genes obtained from unimmunized donors. This technique allows the production of antibodies and antibody fragments with affinities in the nM range. A strategy for making very large phage antibody repertoires (also known as \"the mother-of-all libraries\") has been described by \nWaterhouse et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 21: 2265-2266 (1993\n), and the isolation of a high affinity human antibody directly from such large phage library is reported by \nGriffiths et al., EMBO J. 13: 3245-3260 (1994\n). Gene shuffling can also be used to derive human antibodies from rodent antibodies, where the human antibody has similar affinities and specificities to the starting rodent antibody. According to this method, which is also referred to as \"epitope imprinting\", the heavy or light chain V domain gene of rodent antibodies obtained by phage display technique is replaced with a repertoire of human V domain genes, creating rodent-human chimeras. Selection on antigen results in isolation of human variable capable of restoring a functional antigen-binding site, i.e. the epitope governs (imprints) the choice of partner. When the process is repeated in order to replace the remaining rodent V domain, a human antibody is obtained (see \n \nPCT patent application WO 93/06213, published 1 April 1993\n \n). Unlike traditional humanization of rodent antibodies by CDR grafting, this technique provides completely human antibodies, which have no framework or CDR residues of rodent origin.\n\n\n \n\n\n(v) Bispecific antibodies\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nBispecific antibodies are monoclonal, preferably human or humanized, antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different antigens. In the present case, one of the binding specificities is for an IFN-α to provide a neutralizing antibody, the other one is for any other antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditionally, the recombinant production of bispecific antibodies is based on the co-expression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pairs, where the two heavy chains have different specificities (\nMillstein and Cuello, Nature 305: 537-539 [1983\n]). Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, these hybridomas (quadromas) produce a potential mixture of 10 different antibody molecules, of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. The purification of the correct molecule, which is usually done by affinity chromatography steps, is rather cumbersome, and the product yields are low. Similar procedures are disclosed in \n \nPCT application publication No. WO 93/08829 (published 13 May 1993\n \n), and in \nTraunecker et al., EMBO J. 10: 3655-3659 (1991\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to a different and more preferred approach, antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities (antibody-antigen combining sites) are fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. The fusion preferably is with an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant domain, comprising at least part of the hinge, CH2 and CH3 regions. It is preferred to have the first heavy chain constant region (CH1) containing the site necessary for light chain binding, present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and, if desired, the immunoglobulin light chain, are inserted into separate expression vectors, and are co-transfected into a suitable host organism. This provides for great flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction provide the optimum yields. It is, however, possible to insert the coding sequences for two or all three polypeptide chains in one expression vector when the expression of at least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios are of no particular significance. In a preferred embodiment of this approach, the bispecific antibodies are composed of a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm, and a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pair (providing a second binding specificity) in the other arm. It was found that this asymmetric structure facilitates the separation of the desired bispecific compound from unwanted immunoglobulin chain combinations, as the presence of an immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of the bispecific molecule provides for a facile way of separation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor further details of generating bispecific antibodies see, for example, \nSuresh et al., Methods in Enzymology 121, 210 (1986\n).\n\n\n \n\n\n(vi) Heteroconjugate antibodies\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nHeteroconjugate antibodies are also within the scope of the present invention. Heteroconjugate antibodies are composed of two covalently joined antibodies. Such antibodies have, for example, been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells (\n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,676,980\n \n), and for treatment of HIV infection (\n \nPCT application publication Nos. WO 91/00360\n \n and \n \nWO 92/200373\n \n; \n \nEP 03089\n \n). Heteroconjugate antibodies may be made using any convenient cross-linking methods. Suitable cross-linking agents are well known in the art, and are disclosed in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,676,980\n \n, along with a number of cross-linking techniques.\n\n\n \n\n\n(vii) Antibody fragments\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the neutralizing anti-IFN-α antibody (including murine, human and humanized antibodies, and antibody variants) is an antibody fragment. Various techniques have been developed for the production of antibody fragments. Traditionally, these fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies (see, \ne.g\n., \nMorimoto et al., J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods 24:107-117 [1992\n] and \nBrennan et al., Science 229:81 [1985\n]). However, these fragments can now be produced directly by recombinant host cells (reviewed in \nHudson, Curr. Opin. Immunol. 11: 548-557 [1999\n]; \nLittle et al., Immunol. Today 21: 364-370 [2000\n]). For example, Fab'-SH fragments can be directly recovered from \nE. coli\n and chemically coupled to form F(ab')\n2\n fragments (\nCarter et al., Bio/Technology 10:163-167 [1992\n]). In another embodiment, the F(ab')\n2\n is formed using the leucine zipper GCN4 to promote assembly of the F(ab')\n2\n molecule. According to another approach, Fv, Fab or F(ab')\n2\n fragments can be isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture. Other techniques for the production of antibody fragments will be apparent to the skilled practitioner.\n\n\n \n\n\n(viii) Amino acid sequence variants of antibodies\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAmino acid sequence modification(s) of the anti-IFN-α antibodies described herein are contemplated. For example, it may be desirable to improve the binding affinity and/or other biological properties of the antibody. Amino acid sequence variants of the anti-IFN-α antibodies are prepared by introducing appropriate nucleotide changes into the nucleic acid encoding the anti-IFN-α antibody chains, or by peptide synthesis. Such modifications include, for example, deletions from, and/or insertions into and/or substitutions of, residues within the amino acid sequences of the anti-IFN-α antibody. Any combination of deletion, insertion, and substitution is made to arrive at the final construct, provided that the final construct possesses the desired characteristics. The amino acid changes also may alter post-translational processes of the anti-IFN-α antibody, such as changing the number or position of glycosylation sites.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA useful method for identification of certain residues or regions of the neutralizing anti-IFN-α antibody that are preferred locations for mutagenesis is called \"alanine scanning mutagenesis,\" as described by \nCunningham and Wells Science, 244:1081-1085 (1989\n). Here, a residue or group of target residues are identified (\ne\n.\ng\n., charged residues such as arg, asp, his, lys, and glu) and replaced by a neutral or negatively charged amino acid (most preferably alanine or polyalanine) to affect the interaction of the amino acids with the antigen. Those amino acid locations demonstrating functional sensitivity to the substitutions then are refined by introducing further or other variants at, or for, the sites of substitution. Thus, while the site for introducing an amino acid sequence variation is predetermined, the nature of the mutation \nper se\n need not be predetermined. For example, to analyze the performance of a mutation at a given site, ala scanning or random mutagenesis is conducted at the target codon or region and the expressed anti-IFN-α antibody variants are screened for the desired activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmino acid sequence insertions include amino- and/or carboxyl-terminal fusions ranging in length from one residue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more residues, as well as intra-sequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Examples of terminal insertions include an anti-IFN-α neutralizing antibody with an N-terminal methionyl residue or the antibody fused to an epitope tag. Other insertional variants of the anti-IFN-α antibody molecule include the fusion to the N- or C-terminus of the antibody of an enzyme or a polypeptide which increases the serum half-life of the antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother type of variant is an amino acid substitution variant. These variants have at least one amino acid residue in the neutralizing anti-IFN-α antibody molecule removed and a different residue inserted in its place. The sites of greatest interest for substitution mutagenesis include the hypervariable regions, but FR alterations are also contemplated. Conservative substitutions are shown in Table 1 under the heading of \"preferred substitutions\". If such substitutions result in a change in biological activity, then more substantial changes, denominated \"exemplary substitutions\" in Table 1, or as further described below in reference to amino acid classes, may be introduced and the products screened.\n\n \n \n \nTable 1\n \n \n \n \n \n \nOriginal Residue\n \n \n \nExemplary Substitutions\n \n \n \nPreferred Substitutions\n \n \n \n \n \nAla (A)\n \nval; leu; ile\n \nval\n \n \n \nArg (R)\n \nlys; gln; asn\n \nlys\n \n \n \nAsn (N)\n \ngln; his; asp, lys; arg\n \ngln\n \n \n \nAsp (D)\n \nglu; asn\n \nglu\n \n \n \nCys (C)\n \nser; ala\n \nser\n \n \n \nGln (Q)\n \nasn; glu\n \nasn\n \n \n \nGlu (E)\n \nasp; gln\n \nasp\n \n \n \nGly (G)\n \nala\n \nala\n \n \n \nHis (H)\n \nasn; gln; lys; arg\n \narg\n \n \n \nIle (I)\n \nleu; val; met; ala; phe; norleucine\n \nleu\n \n \n \nLeu (L)\n \nnorleucine; ile; val; met; ala; phe\n \nile\n \n \n \nLys (K)\n \narg; gln; asn\n \narg\n \n \n \nMet (M)\n \nleu; phe; ile\n \nleu\n \n \n \nPhe (F)\n \nleu; val; ile; ala; tyr\n \ntyr\n \n \n \nPro (P)\n \nala\n \nala\n \n \n \nSer (S)\n \nthr\n \nthr\n \n \n \nThr (T)\n \nser\n \nser\n \n \n \nTrp (W)\n \ntyr; phe\n \ntyr\n \n \n \nTyr (Y)\n \ntrp; phe; thr; ser\n \nphe\n \n \n \nVal (V)\n \nile; leu; met; phe; ala; norleucine\n \nleu\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubstantial modifications in the biological properties of the antibody are accomplished by selecting substitutions that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining (a) the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitution, for example, as a sheet or helical conformation, (b) the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site, or (c) the bulk of the side chain. Naturally occurring residues are divided into groups based on common side-chain properties:\n\n \n \n \n(1) hydrophobic: norleucine, met, ala, val, leu, ile;\n \n(2) neutral hydrophilic: cys, ser, thr;\n \n(3) acidic: asp, glu;\n \n(4) basic: asn, gln, his, lys, arg;\n \n(5) residues that influence chain orientation: gly, pro; and\n \n(6) aromatic: trp, tyr, phe.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nNon-conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for another class.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny cysteine residue not involved in maintaining the proper conformation of the neutralizing anti-IFN-α antibody also may be substituted, generally with serine, to improve the oxidative stability of the molecule and prevent aberrant crosslinking. Conversely, cysteine bond(s) may be added to the antibody to improve its stability (particularly where the antibody is an antibody fragment such as a Fv fragment).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA particularly preferred type of substitution variant involves substituting one or more hypervariable region residues of a parent antibody (\ne.g\n. a humanized or human antibody). Generally, the resulting variant(s) selected for further development will have improved biological properties relative to the parent antibody from which they are generated. A convenient way for generating such substitution variants is affinity maturation using phage display. Briefly, several hypervariable region sites (\ne.g\n. 6-7 sites) are mutated to generate all possible amino substitutions at each site. The antibody variants thus generated are displayed in a monovalent fashion from filamentous phage particles as fusions to the gene III product of M13 packaged within each particle. The phage-displayed variants are then screened for their biological activity (\ne.g\n. antagonist activity) as herein disclosed. In order to identify candidate hypervariable region sites for modification, alanine scanning mutagenesis can be performed to identify hypervariable region residues contributing significantly to antigen binding. Alternatively, or in addition, it may be beneficial to analyze a crystal structure of the antigen-antibody complex to identify contact points between the antibody and IFN-α. Such contact residues and neighboring residues are candidates for substitution according to the techniques elaborated herein. Once such variants are generated, the panel of variants is subjected to screening as described herein and antibodies with superior properties in one or more relevant assays may be selected for further development.\n\n\n \n\n\n(ix) Glycosylation Variants\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAntibodies are glycosylated at conserved positions in their constant regions (\nJefferis and Lund, Chem. Immunol. 65:111-128 [1997\n]; \nWright and Morrison, Trends Biotechnol. 15:26-32 [1997\n]). The oligosaccharide side chains of the immunoglobulins affect the protein's function (\nBoyd et al., Mol. Immunol. 32:1311-1318 [1996\n]; \nWittwe and Howard, Biochem. 29:4175-4180 [1990\n]), and the intramolecular interaction between portions of the glycoprotein which can affect the conformation and presented three-dimensional surface of the glycoprotein (Jefferis and Lund, \nsupra\n; \nWyss and Wagner, Current Opin. Biotech. 7:409-416 [1996\n]). Oligosaccharides may also serve to target a given glycoprotein to certain molecules based upon specific recognition structures. For example, it has been reported that in agalactosylated IgG, the oligosaccharide moiety 'flips' out of the inter-CH2 space and terminal N-acetylglucosamine residues become available to bind mannose binding protein (\nMalhotra et al., Nature Med. 1:237-243 [1995\n]). Removal by glycopeptidase of the oligosaccharides from CAMPATH-1H (a recombinant humanized murine monoclonal IgG1 antibody which recognizes the CDw52 antigen of human lymphocytes) produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells resulted in a complete reduction in complement mediated lysis (CMCL) (\nBoyd et al., Mol. Immunol. 32:1311-1318 [1996\n]), while selective removal of sialic acid residues using neuraminidase resulted in no loss of DMCL. Glycosylation of antibodies has also been reported to affect antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In particular, CHO cells with tetracycline-regulated expression of β(1,4)-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnTIII), a glycosyltransferase catalyzing formation of bisecting GlcNAc, was reported to have improved ADCC activity (\nUmana et al., Mature Biotech. 17:176-180 [1999\n]).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlycosylation of antibodies is typically either N-linked or O-linked. N-linked refers to the attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The tripeptide sequences asparagine-X-serine and asparagine-X-threonine, where X is any amino acid except proline, are the recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. Thus, the presence of either of these tripeptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site. O-linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of one of the sugars N-aceylgalactosamine, galactose, or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid, most commonly serine or threonine, although 5-hydroxyproline or 5-hydroxylysine may also be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlycosylation variants of antibodies are variants in which the glycosylation pattern of an antibody is altered. By altering is meant deleting one or more carbohydrate moieties found in the antibody, adding one or more carbohydrate moieties to the antibody, changing the composition of glycosylation (glycosylation pattern), the extent of glycosylation, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAddition of glycosylation sites to the antibody is conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that it contains one or more of the above-described tripeptide sequences (for N-linked glycosylation sites). The alteration may also be made by the addition of, or substitution by, one or more serine or threonine residues to the sequence of the original antibody (for O-linked glycosylation sites). Similarly, removal of glycosylation sites can be accomplished by amino acid alteration within the native glycosylation sites of the antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino acid sequence is usually altered by altering the underlying nucleic acid sequence. Nucleic acid molecules encoding amino acid sequence variants of the anti-IFN-α antibody are prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include, but are not limited to, isolation from a natural source (in the case of naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants) or preparation by oligonuelcotide-mediated (or site-directed) mutagenesis, PCR mutagenesis, and cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared variant or a non-variant version of the anti-IFN-α antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe glycosylation (including glycosylation pattern) of antibodies may also be altered without altering the amino acid sequence or the underlying nucleotide sequence. Glycosylation largely depends on the host cell used to express the antibody. Since the cell type used for expression of recombinant glycoproteins, e.g. antibodies, as potential therapeutics is rarely the native cell, significant variations in the glycosylation pattern of the antibodies can be expected (see, e.g. \nHse et al., J. Biol. Chem. 272:9062-9070 [1997\n]). In addition to the choice of host cells, factors which affect glycosylation during recombinant production of antibodies include growth mode, media formulation, culture density, oxygenation, pH, purification schemes and the like. Various methods have been proposed to alter the glycosylation pattern achieved in a particular host organism including introducing or overexpressing certain enzymes involved in oligosaccharide production (\n \nU. S. Patent Nos. 5,047,335\n \n; \n \n5,510,261\n \n and \n \n5.278,299\n \n). Glycosylation, or certain types of glycosylation, can be enzymatically removed from the glycoprotein, for example using endoglycosidase H (Endo H). In addition, the recombinant host cell can be genetically engineered, e.g. make defective in processing certain types of polysaccharides. These and similar techniques are well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe glycosylation structure of antibodies can be readily analyzed by conventional techniques of carbohydrate analysis, including lectin chromatography, NMR, Mass spectrometry, HPLC, GPC, monosaccharide compositional analysis, sequential enzymatic digestion, and HPAEC-PAD, which uses high pH anion exchange chromatography to separate oligosaccharides based on charge. Methods for releasing oligosaccharides for analytical purposes are also known, and include, without limitation, enzymatic treatment (commonly performed using peptide-N-glycosidase F/endo-β-galactosidase), elimination using harsh alkaline environment to release mainly O-linked structures, and chemical methods using anhydrous hydrazine to release both N- and O-linked oligosaccharides.\n\n\n \n\n\n(x) Other modifications of antibodies\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe neutralizing anti-IFN-α antibodies disclosed herein may also be formulated as immunoliposomes. Liposomes containing the antibody are prepared by methods known in the art, such as described in \nEpstein et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:3688 (1985\n); \nHwang et al., Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 77:4030 (1980\n); and \n \nU.S. Pat. Nos. 4,485,045\n \n and \n \n4,544,545\n \n. Liposomes with enhanced circulation time are disclosed in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,013,556\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParticularly useful liposomes can be generated by the reverse phase evaporation method with a lipid composition comprising phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol and PEG-derivatized phosphatidylethanolamine (PEG-PE). Liposomes are extruded through filters of defined pore size to yield liposomes with the desired diameter. Fab' fragments of the antibody of the present invention can be conjugated to the liposomes as described in \nMartin et al., J Biol. Chem. 257:286-288 (1982\n) via a disulfide interchange reaction. A chemotherapeutic agent (such as Doxorubicin) is optionally contained within the liposome. See \nGabizon et al., J National Cancer Inst. 81(19):1484 (1989\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibody of the present invention may also be used in ADEPT by conjugating the antibody to a prodrug-activating enzyme which converts a prodrug (\ne.g\n., a peptidyl chemotherapeutic agent, see \n \nWO81/01145\n \n to an active drug. See, for example, \n \nWO 88/07378\n \n and \n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,975,278\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe enzyme component of the immunoconjugate useful for ADEPT includes any enzyme capable of acting on a prodrug in such a way so as to covert it into its more active form exhibiting the desired biological properties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnzymes that are useful in the method of this invention include, but are not limited to, alkaline phosphatase useful for converting phosphate-containing prodrugs into free drugs; arylsulfatase useful for converting sulfate-containing prodrugs into free drugs; cytosine deaminase useful for converting non-toxic 5-fluorocytosine into the anti-cancer drug, 5-fluorouracil; proteases, such as serratia protease, thermolysin, subtilisin, carboxypeptidases and cathepsins (such as cathepsins B and L), that are useful for converting peptide-containing prodrugs into free drugs; D-alanylcarboxypeptidases, useful for converting prodrugs that contain D-amino acid substituents; carbohydrate-cleaving enzymes such as β-galactosidase and neuraminidase useful for converting glycosylated prodrugs into free drugs; β-lactamase useful for converting drugs derivatized with ∃-lactams into free drugs; and penicillin amidases, such as penicillin V amidase or penicillin G amidase, useful for converting drugs derivatized at their amine nitrogens with phenoxyacetyl or phenylacetyl groups, respectively, into free drugs. Alternatively, antibodies with enzymatic activity, also known in the art as \"abzymes\", can be used to convert the prodrugs of the invention into free active drugs (see, \ne.g.,\n \nMassey, Nature 328:457-458 (1987\n)). Antibody-abzyme conjugates can be prepared as described herein for delivery of the abzyme to a desired cell population.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe enzymes can be covalently bound to the neutralizing anti-IFN-α antibodies by techniques well known in the art such as the use of the heterobifunctional crosslinking reagents discussed above. Alternatively, fusion proteins comprising at least the antigen binding region of an antibody of the invention linked to at least a functionally active portion of an enzyme of the invention can be constructed using recombinant DNA techniques well known in the art (see, \ne.g\n., \nNeuberger et al., Nature 312:604-608 [1984\n]).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments of the invention, it may be desirable to use an antibody fragment, rather than an intact antibody. In this case, it may be desirable to modify the antibody fragment in order to increase its serum half-life. This may be achieved, for example, by incorporation of a salvage receptor binding epitope into the antibody fragment (\ne.g\n., by mutation of the appropriate region in the antibody fragment or by incorporating the epitope into a peptide tag that is then fused to the antibody fragment at either end or in the middle, \ne.g\n., by DNA or peptide synthesis). See \n \nWO96/32478 published October 17, 1996\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe salvage receptor binding epitope generally constitutes a region wherein any one or more amino acid residues from one or two loops of a Fc domain are transferred to an analogous position of the antibody fragment. Even more preferably, three or more residues from one or two loops of the Fc domain are transferred. Still more preferred, the epitope is taken from the CH2 domain of the Fc region (\ne.g\n., of an IgG) and transferred to the CH1, CH3, or V\nH\n region, or more than one such region, of the antibody. Alternatively, the epitope is taken from the CH2 domain of the Fc region and transferred to the C\nL\n region or V\nL\n region, or both, of the antibody fragment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCovalent modifications of the neutralizing anti-IFN-α antibodies are also included within the scope of this invention. They may be made by chemical synthesis or by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of the antibody, if applicable. Other types of covalent modifications of the antibody are introduced into the molecule by reacting targeted amino acid residues of the antibody with an organic derivatizing agent that is capable of reacting with selected side chains or the N- or C-terminal residues. Exemplary covalent modifications of polypeptides are described in \n \nUS Patent 5,534,615\n \n, specifically incorporated herein by reference. A preferred type of covalent modification of the antibody comprises linking the antibody to one of a variety of nonproteinaceous polymers, \ne.g.,\n polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, or polyoxyallcylenes, in the manner set forth in \n \nU.S. Patent Nos. 4,640,835\n \n; \n \n4,496,689\n \n; \n \n4,301,144\n \n; \n \n4,670,417\n \n; \n \n4,791,192\n \n or \n \n4,179,337\n \n.\n\n\n \n2. Screening for antibodies with the desired properties\n\n\n \n \n \nTechniques for generating antibodies have been described above. Anti-IFN-α antibodies with the desired, broad range neutralizing properties can then be identified by methods known in the art.\n\n\n \n\n\n(i) Binding Assays\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThus, for example, the neutralizing anti-IFN-α antibodies of the present invention can be identified in IFN-α binding assays, by incubating a candidate antibody with one or more individual IFN-α subtypes, or an array or mixture of various IFN-α subtypes, and monitoring binding and neutralization of a biological activity of IFN-α. The binding assay may be performed with purified IFN-α polypeptide(s). In one embodiment, the binding assay is a competitive binding assay, where the ability of a candidate antibody to compete with a known anti-IFN-α antibody for IFN-α binding is evaluated. The assay may be performed in various formats, including the ELISA format, also illustrated in the Examples below. IFN-α binding of a candidate antibody may also be monitored in a BIAcore\n™\n Biosensor assay, as described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny suitable competition binding assay known in the art can be used to characterize the ability of a candidate anti-IFN-α monoclonal antibody to compete with murine anti-human IFN-α monoclonal antibody 9F3 for binding to a particular IFN-α species. A routine competition assay is described in \nAntibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Ed Harlow and David Lane (1988\n). In another embodiment, the IFN-α-binding ELISA assay described in Example 2 below could be modified to employ IFN-α binding competition between a candidate antibody and the 9F3 antibody. Such an assay could be performed by layering the IFN-α on microtiter plates, incubating the layered plates with serial dilutions of unlabeled anti-IFN-α antibody or unlabeled control antibody admixed with a selected concentration of labeled 9F3 antibody, detecting and measuring the signal from the 9F3 antibody label, and then comparing the signal measurements exhibited by the various dilutions of antibody.\n\n\n \n\n\n(ii) Antiviral Assays\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ability of a candidate antibody to neutralize a biological activity of IFN-α can, for example, be carried out by monitoring the neutralization of the antiviral activity of IFN-α as described by \nKawade, J. Interferon Res. 1:61-70 (1980\n), or \nKawade and Watanabe, J. Interferon Res. 4:571-584 (1984\n). Briefly, a fixed concentration of IFN-α premixed with various dilutions of a candidate antibody is added to human amnion-derived FL cells, and the ability of the candidate antibody to neutralize the antiviral activity of IFN-α is determined, using an appropriate virus, e.g. Sindbis virus. The titers are expressed in international units (IU), as determined with the international reference human IFN-α (NIH Ga23-901-527).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe candidate anti-IFN-α antibody is considered able to inhibit the anti-viral activity of a selected IFN-α subtype if a certain concentration of the antibody inhibits more anti-viral activity than the baseline level of anti-viral activity inhibition measured in the presence of an equivalent concentration of control antibody. Optionally, the certain concentration of the candidate anti-IFN-α antibody will inhibit at least or about 60%, or at least or about 70%, preferably at least or about 75%, or more preferably at least or about 80%, or even more preferably at least or about 85%, or still more preferably at least or about 90%, or still more preferably at least or about 95%, or most preferably at least or about 99% of the anti-viral activity of the selected IFN-α subtype in the anti-viral activity assay as compared to baseline activity measured in the presence of an equivalent concentration of control antibody. The candidate anti-IFN-α antibody is considered unable to inhibit the anti-viral activity of a selected IFN-α subtype if there is no concentration of the antibody that exhibits more anti-viral activity inhibition than the baseline level of anti-viral activity inhibition measured in the presence of an equivalent concentration of control antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment, each interferon species used in the viral infectivity assay is titrated to a concentration that provides the same level of inhibition of viral growth as that induced by a preselected number of units of an IFN-α standard. This concentration serves to provide the normalized units of the subject interferon species. In order to assess the ability of an anti-IFN-α antibody to inhibit the anti-viral activity of various IFN-α subtypes, the effective concentration (EC50) of anti-IFN-α antibody for inhibiting 50% of a particular IFN-α subtype's anti-viral activity (at the concentration titrated to provide the normalized units of activity) is determined for each IFN-α subtype to be tested.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the antiviral activity neutralization assay is performed as described in Example 1 below. Briefly, A549 cells are grown to a density of 5x10\n5\n A549 cells/well on 96-well microtiter plates. Serial dilutions of candidate anti-IFN-α antibody are incubated with 0.2 units/:1 of a selected IFN-α subtype (normalized to 0.2 units/:l of NIH reference standard recombinant human IFN-α2) in a total volume of 100 :1 at 37EC for one hour. Each 100 :1 volume of antibody/interferon incubation mixture is then added to 5x10\n5\n A549 cells and 100 :1 of culture medium in an individual well on the microtiter plate, yielding a final IFN-α concentration of 100 units/ml in each well. The resulting cell culture mixtures are incubated for 24 hours at 37EC. Cells are then challenged with 2x10\n5\n pfu of encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus and incubated for an additional 24 hours at 37EC. At the end of the incubation, cell viability is determined by visual microscopic examination or crystal violet staining. The effective concentration (EC50) of a candidate IFN-α antibody for inhibiting 50% of a particular IFN-α subtype's anti-viral activity in the assay is determined for each IFN-α subtype to be tested.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect of the invention, the anti-IFN-α antibody that exhibits anti-viral activity neutralization against the subject IFN-α subtypes will exhibit an EC50 of up to or about 20 :g/ml, or up to or about 10 :g/ml, or up to or about 5 :g/ml, or up to or about 4 :g/ml, or up to or about 3 :g/ml, or up to or about 2 :g/ml, or up to or about 1 :g/ml with respect to each

anti-viral activity neutralization against the subject IFN-α subtypes will exhibit an EC50 from or about 0.2 :g/ml to or about 20 :g/ml, from or about 0.2 :g/ml to or about 10 :g/ml, from or about 0.2 :g/ml to or about 5 :g/ml, or from or about 0.2 :g/ml to or about 4 :g/ml, from or about 0.2 :g/ml to or about 3 :g/ml, from or about 0.2 :g/ml to or about 2 :g/ml, or from or about 0.2 :g/ml to or about 1 :g/ml with respect to each of the subject IFN-α subtypes in the A549 cell EMC viral inhibition assay described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect of the invention, the anti-IFN-α antibody that neutralizes the anti-viral activity of the subject IFN-α subtypes will exhibit an EC50 from or about 0.3 :g/ml to or about 20 :g/ml, from or about 0.3 :g/ml to or about 10 :g/ml, from or about 0.3 :g/ml to or about 5 :g/ml, or from or about 0.3 :g/ml to or about 4 :g/ml, from or about 0.3 :g/ml to or about 3 :g/ml, from or about 0.3 :g/ml to or about 2 :g/ml, or from or about 0.3

anti-IFN-α antibody that neutralizes the anti-viral activity of the subject IFN-α subtypes will exhibit an EC50 from or about 0.4 :g/ml to or about 20 :g/ml, from or about 0.4 :g/ml to or about 10 :g/ml, from or about 0.4 :g/ml to or about 5 :g/ml, or from or about 0.4 :g/ml to or about 4 :g/ml, from or about 0.4 :g/ml to or about 3 :g/ml, from or about 0.4 :g/ml to or About 2 :g/ml, or from or

each of the subject IFN-α subtypes in the A549 cell EMC viral inhibition assay described above.\n\n\n \n\n\n(iii) Cross-blocking Assays\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTo screen for antibodies which bind to an epitope on IFN-α bound by an antibody of interest, a routine cross-blocking assay such as that described in \nAntibodies, A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Ed Harlow and David Lane (1988\n), can be performed. Alternatively, or additionally, epitope mapping can be performed by methods known in the art. For example, the IFN-α epitope bound by a monoclonal antibody of the present invention can be determined by competitive binding analysis as described in \nFendly et al. Cancer Research 50:1550 -1558 (1990\n). In another example, cross-blocking studies can be done with direct fluorescence on microtiter plates. In this method, the monoclonal antibody of interest is conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), using established procedures (\nWofsy et al. Selected Methods in Cellular Immunology, p. 287, Mishel and Schiigi (eds.) San Francisco: W.J. Freeman Co. (1980\n)). The selected IFN-α is layered onto the wells of microtiter plates, the layered wells are incubated with mixtures of (1) FITC-labeled monoclonal antibody of interest and (2) unlabeled test monoclonal antibody, and the fluorescence in each well is quantitated to determine the level of cross-blocking exhibited by the antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies are considered to share an epitope if each blocks binding of the other by 50% or greater in comparison to an irrelevant monoclonal antibody control.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results obtained in the cell-based biological assays can then be followed by testing in animal, e.g. murine, models, and human clinical trials. If desired, murine monoclonal antibodies identified as having the desired properties can be converted into chimeric antibodies, or humanized by techniques well known in the art, including the \"gene conversion mutagenesis\" strategy, as described in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,821,337\n \n, the entire disclosure of which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference. Humanization of a particular anti-IFN-α antibody herein is also described in the Examples below.\n\n\n \n\n\n(iv) Phage Display Method\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAnti-IFN-α antibodies of the invention can be identified by using combinatorial libraries to screen for synthetic antibody clones with the desired activity or activities. In principle, synthetic antibody clones are selected by screening phage libraries containing phage that display various fragments (e.g. Fab, F(ab')\n2\n, etc.) of antibody variable region (Fv) fused to phage coat protein. Such phage libraries are panned by affinity chromatography against the desired antigen. Clones expressing Fv fragments capable of binding to the desired antigen are adsorbed to the antigen and thus separated from the non-binding clones in the library. The binding clones are then eluted from the antigen, and can be further enriched by additional cycles of antigen adsorption/elution. Any of the anti-IFN-α antibodies of the invention can be obtained by designing a suitable antigen screening procedure to select for the phage clone of interest followed by construction of a full length anti-IFN-α antibody clone using the Fv sequences from the phage clone of interest and suitable constant region (Fc) sequences described in Kabat \net al.\n (1991), \nsupra.\n \n\n\n \n\n\nConstruction of phage display libraries\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe antigen-binding domain of an antibody is formed from two variable (V) regions of about 110 amino acids each, from the light (VL) and heavy (VH) chains, that both present three hypervariable loops or complementarity-determining regions (CDRs). Variable domains can be displayed functionally on phage, either as single-chain Fv (scFv) fragments, in which VH and VL are covalently linked through a short, flexible peptide, or as or D(ab')\n2\n fragments, in which they are each fused to a constant domain and interact non-covalently, as described in \nWinter et al., Ann. Rev. Immunol., 12: 433-455 (1994\n). As used herein, scFv encoding phage clones and Fab or F(ab')\n2\n encoding phage clones are collectively referred to as \"Fv phage clones\" or \"Fv clones\".\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe naive repertoire of an animal (the repertoire before antigen chahenge) provides it with antibodies that can bind with moderate affinity (K\nd\n \n-1\n of about 10\n6\n to 10\n7\n M\n-1\n) to essentially any non-self molecule. The sequence diversity of antibody binding sites is not encoded directly in the germline but is assembled in a combinatorial manner from V gene segments. In human heavy chains, the first two hypervariable loops (H1 and H2) are drawn from less than 50 VH gene segments, which are combined with D segments and JH segments to create the third hypervariable loop (H3). In human light chains, the first two hypervariable loops (Ll and L2) and much of the third (L3) are drawn from less than approximately 30 V8 and less than approximately 30 V6 segments to complete the third hypervariable loop (L3).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach combinatorial rearrangement of V-gene segments in stem cells gives rise to a B cell that expresses a single VH-VL combination. Immunizations triggers any B cells making a combination that binds the immunogen to proliferate (clonal expansion) and to secrete the corresponding antibody. These naive antibodies are then matured to high affinity (K\nd\n \n-1\n of 10\n9\n-10\n10\n M\n-1\n) by a process of mutagenesis and selection known as affinity maturation. It is after this point that cells are normally removed to prepare hybridomas and generate high-affinity monoclonal antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt three stages of this process, repertoires of VH and VL genes can be separately cloned by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and recombined randomly in phage libraries, which can then be searched for antigen-binding clones as described in \nWinter et al., Ann. Rev. Immunol., 12: 433-455 (1994\n). Libraries from immunized sources provide high-affinity antibodies to the immunogen without the requirement of constructing hybridomas. Alternatively, the naive repertoire can be cloned to provide a single source of human antibodies to a wide range of non-self and also self antigens without any immunization as described by \nGriffiths et al., EMBO J. 12: 725-734 (1993\n). Finally, naive libraries can also be made synthetically by cloning the unrearranged V- or VIII-gene segments from stem cells, and using PCR primers containing random sequence to encode the highly variable CDR3 regions and to accomplish rearrangement in vitro as described by \nHoogenboom and Winter, J. Mol. Biol., 227: 381-388 (1992\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPhage display mimics the B cell. Filamentous phage is used to display antibody fragments by fusion to the minor coat protein pIII. The antibody fragments can be displayed as single chain Fv fragments, in which VH and VL domains are connected on the same polypeptide chain by a flexible polypeptide spacer, e.g. as described by \nMarks et al., J. Mol. Biol., 222: 581-597 (1991\n), or as Fab (including F(ab')\n2\n) fragments, in which one chain is fused to pIII and the other is secreted into the bacterial host cell periplasm where assembly of a Fab-coat protein structure which becomes displayed on the phage surface by displacing some of the wild type coat proteins, e.g. as described in \nHoogenboom et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 19: 4133-4137 (1991\n). When antibody fragments are fused to the N-terminus of pIII, the phage is infective. However, if the N-terminal domain of pIII is excised and fusions made to the second domain, the phage is not infective, and wild type pIII must be provided by helper phage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pIII fusion and other proteins of the phage can be encoded entirely within the same phage replicon, or on different replicons. When two replicons are used, the pIII fusion is encoded on a phagemid, a plasmid containing a phage origin of replication. Phagemids can be packaged into phage particles by \"rescue\" with a helper phage such as M13K07 that provides all the phage proteins, including pIII, but due to a defective origin is itself poorly packaged in competitions with the phagemids as described in \nVieira and Messing, Meth. Enzymol., 153: 3-11 (1987\n). In a preferred method, the phage display system is designed such that the recombinant phage can be grown in host cells under conditions permitting no more than a minor amount of phage particles to display more than one copy of the Fv-coat protein fusion on the surface of the particle as described in \nBass et al., Proteins, 8: 309-314 (1990\n) and in \n \nWO 92/09690\n \n (\n \nPCT/US91/09133 published June 11, 1992\n \n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, nucleic acids encoding antibody gene fragments are obtained from immune cells harvested from humans or animals. If a library biased in favor of anti-IFN-α clones is desired, the subject is immunized with IFN-α to generate an antibody response, and spleen cells and/or circulating B cells other peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) are recovered for library construction. In a preferred embodiment, a human antibody gene fragment library biased in favor of anti-human IFN-α clones is obtained by generating an anti-human IFN-α antibody response in transgenic mice carrying a functional human immunoglobulin gene array (and lacking a functional endogenous antibody production system) such that IFN-α immunization gives rise to B cells producing human-sequence antibodies against IFN-α.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another preferred embodiment, animals are immunized with a mixture of various, preferably all, IFN-α subtypes in order to generate an antibody response that includes B cells producing anti-IFN-α antibodies with broad reactivity against IFN-α subtypes. In another preferred embodiment, animals are immunized with the mixture of human IFN-α subtypes that is present in the human lymphoblastoid interferons secreted by Burkitt lymphoma cells (Namalva cells) induced with Sendai virus, as described in Example 1 below. A suitable preparation of such human lymphoblastoid interferons can be obtained commercially (Product No. I-9887) from Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, MO.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional enrichment for anti-IFN-α reactive cell populations can be obtained by using a suitable screening procedure to isolate B cells expressing IFN-α-specific membrane bound antibody, e.g., by cell separation with IFN-α affinity chromatography or adsorption of cells to fluorochrome-labeled IFN-α followed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the use of spleen cells and/or B cells or other PBLs from an unimmunized donor provides a better representation of the possible antibody repertoire, and also permits the construction of an antibody library using any animal (human or non-human) species in which IFN-α is not antigenic. For libraries incorporating \nin vitro\n antibody gene construction, stem cells are harvested from the subject to provide nucleic acids encoding unrearranged antibody gene segments. The immune cells of interest can be obtained from a variety of animal species, such as human, mouse, rat, lagomorpha, luprine, canine, feline, porcine, bovine, equine, and avian species, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acid encoding antibody variable gene segments (including VH and VL segments) are recovered from the cells of interest and amplified. In the case of rearranged VH and VL gene libraries, the desired DNA can be obtained by isolating genomic DNA or mRNA from lymphocytes followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers matching the 5' and 3' ends of rearranged VH and VL genes as described in \nOrlandi et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA), 86: 3833-3837 (1989\n), thereby making diverse V gene repertoires for expression. The V genes can be amplified from cDNA and genomic DNA, with back primers at the 5' end of the exon encoding the mature V-domain and forward primers based within the J-segment as described in Orlandi \net al.\n (1989) and in \nWard et al., Nature, 341: 544-546 (1989\n). However, for amplifying from cDNA, back primers can also be based in the leader exon as described in \nJones et al., Biotechnol., 9: 88-89 (1991\n), and forward primers within the constant region as described in \nSastry et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA), 86: 5728-5732 (1989\n). To maximize complementarity, degeneracy can be incorporated in the primers as described in Orlandi \net al.\n (1989) or Sastry \net al.\n (1989). Preferably, the library diversity is maximized by using PCR primers targeted to each V-gene family in order to amplify all available VH and VL arrangements present in the immune cell nucleic acid sample, e.g. as described in the method of \nMarks et al., J. Mol. Biol., 222: 581-597 (1991\n) or as described in the method of \nOrum et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 21: 4491-4498 (1993\n). For cloning of the amplified DNA into expression vectors, rare restriction sites can be introduced within the PCR primer as a tag at one end as described in Orlandi \net al.\n (1989), or by further PCR amplification with a tagged primer as described in \nClackson et al., Nature, 352: 624-628 (1991\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRepertoires of synthetically rearranged V genes can be derived in vitro from V gene segments. Most of the human VH-gene segments have been cloned and sequenced (reported in \nTomlinson et al., J. Mol. Biol., 227: 776-798 (1992\n)), and mapped (reported in \nMatsuda et al., Nature Genet., 3: 88-94 (1993\n); these cloned segments (including all the major conformations of the H1 and H2 loop) can be used to generate diverse VH gene repertoires with PCR primers encoding H3 loops of diverse sequence and length as described in \nHoogenboom and Winter, J. Mol. Biol., 227: 381-388 (1992\n). VH repertoires can also be made with all the sequence diversity focussed in a long H3 loop of a single length as described in \nBarbas et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89: 4457-4461 (1992\n). Human V6 and V8 segments have been cloned and sequenced (reported in \nWilliams and Winter, Eur. J. Immunol., 23: 1456-1461 (1993\n)) and can be used to make synthetic light chain repertoires. Synthetic V gene repertoires, based on a range of VH and VL folds, and L3 and H3 lengths, will encode antibodies of considerable structural diversity. Following amplification of V-gene encoding DNAs, germline V-gene segments can be rearranged \nin vitro\n according to the methods of \nHoogenboom and Winter, J. Mol. Biol., 227: 381-388 (1992\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRepertoires of antibody fragments can be constructed by combining VH and VL gene repertoires together in several ways. Each repertoire can be created in different vectors, and the vectors recombined \nin vitro,\n e.g., as described in \nHogrefe et al., Gene, 128: 119-126 (1993\n), or \nin vivo\n by combinatorial infection, e.g., the loxP system described in \nWaterhouse et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 21: 2265-2266 (1993\n). The \nin vivo\n recombination approach exploits the two-chain nature of Fab fragments to overcome the limit on library size imposed by \nE. coli\n transformation efficiency. Naive VH and VL repertoires are cloned separately, one into a phagemid and the other into a phage vector. The two libraries are then combined by phage infection of phagemid-containing bacteria so that each cell contains a different combination and the library size is limited only by the number of cells present (about 10\n12\n clones). Both vectors contain \nin vivo\n recombination signals so that the VH and VL genes are recombined onto a single replicon and are co-packaged into phage virions. These huge libraries provide large numbers of diverse antibodies of good affinity (K\nd\n \n-1\n of about 10\n-8\n M).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the repertoires may be cloned sequentially into the same vector, e.g. as described in \nBarbas et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 88: 7978-7982 (1991\n), or assembled together by PCR and then cloned, e.g. as described in \nClackson et al., Nature, 352: 624-628 (1991\n). PCR assembly can also be used to join VH and VL DNAs with DNA encoding a flexible peptide spacer to form single chain Fv (scFv) repertoires. In yet another technique, \"in cell PCR assembly\" is used to combine VH and VL genes within lymphocytes by PCR and then clone repertoires of linked genes as described in \nEmbleton et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 20: 3831-3837 (1992\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies produced by naive libraries (either natural or synthetic) can be of moderate affinity (K\nd\n \n-1\n of about 10\n6\n to 10\n7\n M\n-1\n), but affinity maturation can also be mimicked \nin vitro\n by constructing and reselecting from secondary libraries as described in Winter \net al.\n (1994), \nsupra.\n For example, mutation can be introduced at random in vitro by using error-prone polymerase (reported in \nLeung et al., Technique, 1: 11-15 (1989\n)) in the method of \nHawkins et al., J. Mol. Biol., 226: 889-896 (1992\n) or in the method of \nGram et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA, 89: 3576-3580 (1992\n). Additionally, affinity maturation can be performed by randomly mutating one or more CDRs, e.g. using PCR with primers carrying random sequence spanning the CDR of interest, in selected individual Fv clones and screening for higher affinity clones. \n \nWO 9607754 (published 14 March 1996\n \n) described a method for inducing mutagenesis in a complementarity determining region of an immunoglobulin light chain to create a library of light chain genes. Another effective approach is to recombine the VH or VL domains selected by phage display with repertoires of naturally occurring V domain variants obtained from unimmunized donors and screen for higher affinity in several rounds of chain reshuffling as described in \nMarks et al., Biotechnol., 10: 779-783 (1992\n). This technique allows the production of antibodies and antibody fragments with affinities in the 10\n-9\n M range.\n\n\n \n\n\nPanning Phage Display Libraries for Anti-IFN-α Clones\n\n\n\n\na. Synthesis of IFN-α\n\n\n \n \n \nNucleic acid sequence encoding the IFN-α subtypes used herein can be designed using published amino acid and nucleic acid sequences of interferons, e.g. see the \nJ. Interferon Res., 13: 443-444 (1993\n) compilation of references containing genomic and cDNA sequences for various type I interferons, and the references cited therein. For the IFN-αA (IFN-α2), IFN-αB (IFN-α8), IFN-αC (IFN-α10), IFN-αD (IFN-α1), IFN-αE (IFN-α22), IFN-αF (IFN-α21), IFN-αG (IFN-α5), and IFN-αH (IFN-α14) amino acid sequences or cDNA sequences, see \nFigs. 3\n and \n4\n on pages 23-24 of \nGoeddel et al., Nature, 290: 20-26 (1981\n). For cDNA encoding the amino acid sequence of IFN-α7 (IFN-αJ), see \nCohen et al., Dev. Biol. Standard, 60: 111-122 (1985\n). DNAs encoding the interferons of interest can be prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include, but are not limited to, chemical synthesis by any of the methods described in \nEngels et al., Agnew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl., 28: 716-734 (1989\n), such as the triester, phosphite, phosphoramidite and H-phosphonate methods. In one embodiment, codons preferred by the expression host cell are used in the design of the interferon-encoding DNA. Alternatively, DNA encoding the interferon can be isolated from a genomic or cDNA library.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing construction of the DNA molecule encoding the interferon of interest, the DNA molecule is operably linked to an expression control sequence in an expression vector, such as a plasmid, wherein the control sequence is recognized by a host cell transformed with the vector. In general, plasmid vectors contain replication and control sequences which are derived from species compatible with the host cell. The vector ordinarily carries a replication site, as well as sequences which encode proteins that are capable of providing phenotypic selection in transformed cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor expression in prokaryotic hosts, suitable vectors include pBR322 (ATCC No. 37,017), phGH107 (ATCC No. 40,011), pBO475, pS0132, pRIT5, any vector in the pRIT20 or pRIT30 series (\nNilsson and Abrahmsen, Meth. Enrymol., 185: 144-161 (1990\n)), pRIT2T, pKK233-2, pDR540 and pPL-lambda. Prokaryotic host cells containing the expression vectors suitable for use herein include \nE. coli\n K12 strain 294 (ATCC NO. 31446), \nE coli\n strain JM101 (\nMessing et al., Nucl.Acid Res., 9: 309 (1981\n)), \nE. coli\n strain B, \nE. coli\n strain Π1776 (ATCC No. 31537), \nE. coli\n c600 (Appleyard, \nGenetics,\n 39: 440 (1954)), \nE. coli\n W3110 (F-, gamma-, prototrophic, ATCC No. 27325), \nE. coli\n strain 27C7 (W3110, \ntonA, phoA E15, (argF-lac)169, ptr3, degP41, ompT, kan\n \nr\n) (\n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,288,931\n \n, ATCC No. 55,244), \nBacillus subtilis, Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia marcesans,\n and \nPseudomonas\n species.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to prokaryotes, eukaryotic organisms, such as yeasts, or cells derived from multicellular organisms can be used as host cells. For expression in yeast host cells, such as common baker's yeast or \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae,\n suitable vectors include episomally replicating vectors based on the 2-micron plasmid, integration vectors, and yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) vectors. For expression in insect host cells, such as Sf9 cells, suitable vectors include baculoviral vectors. For expression in plant host cells, particularly dicotyledonous plant hosts, such as tobacco, suitable expression vectors include vectors derived from the Ti plasmid of \nAgrobacterium tumefaciens.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, interest has been greatest in vertebrate host cells. Examples of useful mammalian host cells include monkey kidney CV1 line transformed by SV40 (COS-7, ATCC CRL 1651); human embryonic kidney line (293 or 293 cells subcloned for growth in suspension culture, \nGraham et al., J. Gen Virol., 36: 59 (1977\n)); baby hamster kidney cells (BHK, ATCC CCL 10); Chinese hamster ovary cells/-DHFR (CHO, \nUrlaub and Chasin, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 77: 4216 (1980\n)); mouse sertoli cells (TM4, \nMather, Biol. Reprod., 23: 243-251 (1980\n)); monkey kidney cells (CV1 ATCC CCL 70); African green monkey kidney cells (VERO-76, ATCC CRL-1587); human cervical carcinoma cells (HELA, ATCC CCL 2); canine kidney cells (MDCK, ATCC CCL 34); buffalo rat liver cells (BRL 3A, ATCC CRL 1442); human lung cells (W138, ATCC CCL 75); human liver cells (Hep G2, HB 8065); mouse mammary tumor (MMT 060562, ATCC CCL51); TRI cells (\nMather et al., Annals N.Y. Acad. Sci., 383: 44-68 (1982\n)); MRC 5 cells; FS4 cells; and a human hepatoma cell line (Hep G2). For expression in mammalian host cells, useful vectors include vectors derived from SV40, vectors derived from cytomegalovirus such as the pRK vectors, including pRK5 and pRK7 (\nSuva et al., Science, 237: 893-896 (1987\n), \n \nEP 307,247 (3/15/89\n \n), \n \nEP 278,776 (8/17/88\n \n)) vectors derived from vaccinia viruses or other pox viruses, and retroviral vectors such as vectors derived from Moloney's murine leukemia virus (MoMLV).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOptionally, the DNA encoding the interferon of interest is operably linked to a secretory leader sequence resulting in secretion of the expression product by the host cell into the culture medium. Examples of secretory leader sequences include stII, ecotin, lamB, herpes GD, lpp, alkaline phosphatase, invertase, and alpha factor. Also suitable for use herein is the 36 amino acid leader sequence of protein A (\nAbrahmsen et al., EMBO J., 4: 3901 (1985\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHost cells are transfected and preferably transformed with the above-described expression or cloning vectors of this invention and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters, selecting transformants, or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTransfection refers to the taking up of an expression vector by a host cell whether or not any coding sequences are in fact expressed. Numerous methods of transfection are known to the ordinarily skilled artisan, for example, CaPO\n4\n precipitation and electroporation. Successful transfection is generally recognized when any indication of the operation of this vector occurs within the host cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTransformation means introducing DNA into an organism so that the DNA is replicable, either as an extrachromosomal element or by chromosomal integrant. Depending on the host cell used, transformation is done using standard techniques appropriate to such cells. The calcium treatment employing calcium chloride, as described in section 1.82 of \nSambrook et al., Molecular Cloning (2nd ed.), Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, NY (1989\n), is generally used for prokaryotes or other cells that contain substantial cell-wall barriers. Infection with \nAgrobacterium tumefaciens\n is used for transformation of certain plant cells, as described by \nShaw et al., Gene, 23: 315 (1983\n) and \n \nWO 89/05859 published 29 June 1989\n \n. For mammalian cells without such cell walls, the calcium phosphate precipitation method described in sections 16.30-16.37 of Sambrook \net al., supra,\n is preferred. General aspects of mammalian cell host system transformations have been described by \n \nAxel in U.S. 4,399,216 issued 16 August 1983\n \n. Transformations into yeast are typically carried out according to the method of \nVan Solingen et al., J. Bact., 130: 946 (1977\n) and \nHsiao et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA), 76: 3829 (1979\n). However, other methods for introducing DNA into cells such as by nuclear injection, electroporation, or by protoplast fusion may also be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProkaryotic host cells used to produce the interferon of interest can be cultured as described generally in Sambrook \net al., supra.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe mammalian host cells used to produce the interferon of interest can be cultured in a variety of media. Commercially available media such as Ham's F10 (Sigma), Minimal Essential Medium ((MEM), Sigma), RPMI-1640 (Sigma), and Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium ((DMEM), Sigma) are suitable for culturing the host cells. In addition, any of the media described in \nHam and Wallace, Meth. Enz., 58: 44 (1979\n), \nBarnes and Sato, Anal. Biochem., 102: 255 (1980\n), \n \nU.S. 4,767,704\n \n; \n \n4,657,866\n \n; \n \n4,927,762\n \n; or \n \n4,560,655\n \n; \n \nWO 90/03430\n \n; \n \nWO 87/00195\n \n; \n \nU.S. Pat. Re. 30,985\n \n; or \n \nU.S. 5,122,469\n \n, the disclosures of all of which are incorporated herein by reference, may be used as culture media for the host cells. Any of these media may be supplemented as necessary with hormones and/or other growth factors (such as insulin, transferrin, or epidermal growth factor), salts (such as sodium chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate), buffers (such as HEPES), nucleosides (such as adenosine and thymidine), antibiotics (such as Gentamycin\n™\n drug), trace elements (defined as inorganic compounds usually present at final concentrations in the micromolar range), and glucose or an equivalent energy source. Any other necessary supplements may also be included at appropriate concentrations that would be known to those skilled in the art. The culture conditions, such as temperature, pH, and the like, are those previously used with the host cell selected for expression, and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe host cells referred to in this disclosure encompass cells in \nin vitro\n culture as well as cells that are within a host animal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an intracellular expression system or periplasmic space secretion system, the recombinantly expressed interferon protein can be recovered from the culture cells by disrupting the host cell membrane/cell wall (e.g. by osmotic shock or solubilizing the host cell membrane in detergent). Alternatively, in an extracellular secretion system, the recombinant protein can be recovered from the culture medium. As a first step, the culture medium or lysate is centrifuged to remove any particulate cell debris. The membrane and soluble protein fractions are then separated. Usually, the interferon is purified from the soluble protein fraction. If the IFN-α is expressed as a membrane bound species, the membrane bound peptide can be recovered from the membrane fraction by solubilization with detergents. The crude peptide extract can then be further purified by suitable procedures such as fractionation on immunoaffinity or ion-exchange columns; ethanol precipitation; reverse phase HPLC; chromatography on silica or on a cation exchange resin such as DEAE; chromatofocusing; SDS-PAGE; ammonium sulfate precipitation; gel filtration using, for example, Sephadex G-75; hydrophobic affinity resins and ligand affinity using interferon receptor immobilized on a matrix.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMany of the human IFN-α used herein can be obtained from commercial sources, e.g. from Sigma (St. Louis, MO), Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corporation (San Diego, CA) or ACCURATE Chemical & Scientific Corporation (Westbury, NY).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStandard cloning procedures described in \nManiatis et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY (1989\n) are used to construct plasmids that direct the translocation of the various species of hIFN-α into the periplasmic space of \nE. coli.\n PCR reactions are performed on cDNA clones of the various subspecies of hIFN-α disclosed in \nGoeddel et al., Nature 290: 20-26 (1981\n) with Nsil and StyI restriction sites added to the primers. These PCR products are then subcloned into the corresponding sites of the expression vector pB0720 described in \nCunningham et al., Science 243:1330-1336 (1989\n). The resulting plasmids place production of the hIFN-α subtypes under control of the \nE. coli pho\nA promoter and the heat-stable enterotoxin II signal peptide as described in \nChang et al., Gene 55: 189-196 (1987\n). The correct DNA sequence of each gene is confirmed using the United States Biochemical Sequenase Kit version 2.0. Each plasmid is transformed into the \nE. coli\n strain 27C7 (ATCC # 55244) and grown in 10 liter fermentors as described in \nCarter et al.,Bio/Technology 10: 163-167 (1992\n). Human hIFNs are purified from \nE. coli\n paste containing each IFN-α by affinity chromatography. Bacterial cells are lysed, and the lysate is centrifuged at 10,000 x g to remove debris. The supernatant is applied to an immunoaffinity column containing a mouse anti-hIFN-αB antibody (LI-1) that is obtained as described in \nStaehelin et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 78:1848-1852 (1981\n). LI-1 is immobilized on controlled pore glass by a modification of the method of \nRoy et al., Journal of Chromatography, 303: 225-228 (1984\n). The bound interferon is eluted from the column with 0.1 M citrate, pH 3.0, containing 20% (w/v) glycerol. The purified IFN is analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, and is assayed for bioactivity by the hIFN-induced anti-viral assay as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHuman IFN-α2/1 hybrid molecule (IFN-α2\n1-62\n/α\n64-166\n) was obtained as described in \nRehberg et al., J. Biol. Chem., 257: 11497-11502 (1992\n) or \nHorisberger and Marco, Pharmac. Ther., 66: 507-534 (1995\n).\n\n\n \nb. Immobilization of IFN-α\n\n\n \n \n \nThe purified IFN-α can be attached to a suitable matrix such as agarose beads, acrylamide beads, glass beads, cellulose, various acrylic copolymers, hydroxyl methacrylate gels, polyacrylic and polymethacrylic copolymers, nylon, neutral and ionic carriers, and the like, for use in the affinity chromatographic separation of phage display clones. Attachment of the IFN-α protein to the matrix can be accomplished by the methods described in \nMethods in Enzymology, vol. 44 (1976\n). A commonly employed technique for attaching protein ligands to polysaccharide matrices, e.g. agarose, dextran or cellulose, involves activation of the carrier with cyanogen halides and subsequent coupling of the peptide ligand's primary aliphatic or aromatic amines to the activated matrix.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, IFN-α can be used to coat the wells of adsorption plates, expressed on host cells affixed to adsorption plates or used in cell sorting, or conjugated to biotin for capture with streptavidin-coated beads, or used in any other art-known method for panning phage display libraries.\n\n\n \nc. Panning Procedures\n\n\n \n \n \nThe phage library samples are contacted with immobilized IFN-α under conditions suitable for binding of at least a portion of the phage particles with the adsorbent. Normally, the conditions, including pH, ionic strength, temperature and the like are selected to mimic physiological conditions. The phage bound to the solid phase are washed and then eluted by acid, e.g. as described in \nBarbas et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA, 88: 7978-7982 (1991\n), or by alkali, e.g. as described in \nMarks et al., J. Mol. Biol., 222: 581-597 (1991\n), or by IFN-α antigen, e.g. in a procedure similar to the antigen competition method of \nClackson et al., Nature, 352: 624-628 (1991\n). Phage can be enriched 20-1,000-fold in a single round of selection. Moreover, the enriched phage can be grown in bacterial culture and subjected to further rounds of selection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment, phage are serially incubated with various IFN-α subtypes immobilized in order to identify and further characterize phage clones that exhibit appreciable binding to a majority, preferably all, of IFN-α subtypes. In this method, phage are first incubated with one specific IFN-α subtype. The phage bound to this subtype are eluted and subjected to selection with another IFN-α subtype. The process of binding and elution is thus repeated with all IFN-α subtypes. At the end, the procedure yields a population of phage displaying antibodies with broad reactivity against all IFN-α subtypes. These phage can then be tested against other IFN species, i.e. other than IFN-α, in order to select those clones which do not show appreciable binding to other species of IFNs. Finally, the selected phage clones can be examined for their ability to neutralize biological activity, e.g. anti-viral activity, of various IFN-α subtypes, and clones representing antibodies with broad neutralization activity against a majority, preferably all, of IFN-α subtypes are finally selected.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe efficiency of selection depends on many factors, including the kinetics of dissociation during washing, and whether multiple antibody fragments on a single phage can simultaneously engage with antigen. Antibodies with fast dissociation kinetics (and weak binding affinities) can be retained by use of short washes, multivalent phage display and high coating density of antigen in solid phase. The high density not only stabilizes the phage through multivalent interactions, but favors rebinding of phage that has dissociated. The selection of antibodies with slow dissociation kinetics (and good binding affinities) can be promoted by use of long washes and monovalent phage display as described in \nBass et al., Proteins, 8: 309-314 (1990\n) and in \n \nWO 92/09690\n \n, and a low coating density of antigen as described in \nMarks et al., Biotechnol., 10: 779-783 (1992\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is possible to select between phage antibodies of different affinities, even with affinities that differ slightly, for IFN-α. However, random mutation of a selected antibody (e.g. as performed in some of the affinity maturation techniques described above) is likely to give rise to many mutants, most binding to antigen, and a few with higher affinity. With limiting IFN-α, rare high affinity phage could be competed out. To retain all the higher affinity mutants, phage can be incubated with excess biotinylated IFN-α, but with the biotinylated IFN-α at a concentration of lower molarity than the target molar affinity constant for IFN-α. The high affinity-binding phage can then be captured by streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads. Such \"equilibrium capture\" allows the antibodies to be selected according to their affinities of binding, with sensitivity that permits isolation of mutant clones with as little as two-fold higher affinity from a great excess of phage with lower affinity. Conditions used in washing phage bound to a solid phase can also be manipulated to discriminate on the basis of dissociation kinetics.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, phage are serially incubated with various IFN-α subtypes immobilized on a solid support, such as chromatographic polymer matrix beads described above. In this method, the phage are first incubated with one specific IFN-α subtype. The phage bound to this subtype are eluted from solid phase with a suitable eluent, such as any salt or acid buffer capable of releasing the bound phage into solution. Next, the eluted phage clones are subjected to selection with another IFN-α subtype. In order to enrich the population for clones that compete with soluble IFNAR2 for binding to IFN-α, the phage clones recovered from the series of IFN-α subtype chromatographic separations are incubated with a complex of immobilized IFNAR2 preadsorbed to IFN-α, and the non-adsorbed phage clones are recovered from the incubation reaction mixture.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe selection procedures can be designed to utilize any suitable batch chromatographic technique. In one embodiment, the phage clones are adsorbed to IFN-α-derivatized polymer matrix beads in suspension, the adsorbed beads are recovered by centrifugation, the recovered beads are resuspended and incubated in a suitable elution buffer, such as any salt or acid buffer capable of releasing the bound phage into solution, the elution mixture is centrifuged, the eluted phage clones are recovered from the supernatant, and then the adsorption/elution procedure is repeated for every additional IFN-α subtype. In order to enrich the population for clones that compete with soluble IFNAR2 for binding to IFN-α, the phage clones recovered from the IFN-α subtype chromatographic separations are incubated with a suspension of IFNAR2-derivatized polymer matrix beads preadsorbed to IFN-α, the incubation mixture is centrifuged, and the non-adsorbed phage clones are recovered from the supernatant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the selection procedure is designed to enrich the phage population for the property of inhibiting IFN-α binding to IFNAR2 during each of the affinity chromatographic separations. In this method, the phage are serially incubated with each of the specific IFN-α subtypes immobilized on a solid support and then eluted from solid phase with an eluent comprising an excess of soluble IFNAR2, such as IFNAR2 ECD-IgG Fc, under conditions wherein soluble IFNAR2 is capable of displacing any phage clone that competes with IFNAR2 for binding to the immobilized IFN-α. The process of binding and elution is thus repeated with each of the specific IFN-α subtypes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the phage clones are adsorbed to IFN-α-derivatized polymer matrix beads in suspension, the adsorbed beads are recovered by centrifugation, the recovered beads are resuspended and incubated in a suitable elution buffer comprising an excess of soluble IFNAR2 (such as IFNAR2 ECD-IgG Fc) under conditions wherein the soluble IFNAR2 is capable of displacing any phage clone that competes with IFNAR2 for binding to the immobilized IFN-α and releasing the bound phage into solution, the elution mixture is centrifuged, the eluted phage clones are recovered from the supernatant, and then the adsorption/elution procedure is repeated for every additional IFN-α subtype.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt the end, the procedure yields a population of phage displaying antibodies with IFNAR2-binding inhibition activity against a broad range of IFN-α subtypes. These phage can then be tested against other IFN species (other than IFN-α species), such as IFN-3, in order to select those clones which do not show appreciable binding to other species of IFNs. Finally, the selected phage clones can be examined for their ability to neutralize biological activity, e.g. anti-viral activity, of various IFN-α subtypes, and clones representing antibodies with broad neutralization activity against a majority, preferably all, of IFN-α subtypes are finally selected.\n\n\n \n\n\n \nActivity Selection of Anti-IFN-\nα \nClones\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the invention provides anti-IFN-α antibodies that bind to as well as neutralize the activity of a majority, preferably all, of IFN-α subtypes, but do not significantly bind to or neutralize the activity of any other interferon species. For example, the ability of various phage clones to neutralize the anti-viral activities of various IFN-α subtypes can be tested, essentially in the same manner as described earlier for the antibodies.\n\n\n \n4. Preparation of soluble IFNAR2-IgG\n\n\n \n \n \nA cDNA encoding the human immunoglobulin fusion proteins (immunoadhesins) based on the extracellular domain (ECD) of the hIFNAR2 (pRK5 hIFNAR2-IgG clone) can be generated using methods similar to those described by \nHaak-Frendscho et al., Immunology 79: 594-599 (1993\n) for the construction of a murine IFN-( receptor immunoadhesin. Briefly, the plasmid pRKCD4\n2\nFc\n1\n is constructed as described in Example 4 of \n \nWO 89/02922\n \n (\n \nPCT/US88/03414 published April 6, 1989\n \n). The cDNA coding sequence for the first 216 residues of the mature hIFNAR2 ECD is obtained from the published sequence (\nNovick et al., Cell, 77: 391-400 [1994\n]). The CD4 coding sequence in the pRKCD4\n2\nFc\n1\n is replaced with the hIFNAR2 ECD encoding cDNA to form the pRK5hIFNAR2-IgG clone. hIFNAR2-IgG is expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells by transient transfection using a calcium phosphate precipitation technique. The immunoadhesin is purified from serum-free cell culture supernatants in a single step by affinity chromatography on a protein A-sepharose column as described in Haak-Frendscho \net al.\n (1993), \nsupra.\n Bound hIFNAR2-IgG is eluted with 0.1 M citrate buffer, pH 3.0, containing 20% (w/v) glycerol. The hIFNAR2-IgG purified is over 95% pure, as judged by SDS-PAGE.\n\n\n \n5. Diagnostic uses of anti-IFN-α antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nThe anti-IFN-α antibodies of the invention are unique research reagents in diagnostic assays for IFN-α expression. As discussed earlier, IFN-α expression is increased in certain autoimmune diseases such as IDDM, SLE, and autoimmune thyroiditis. Increased expression of various IFN-α subtypes in such disorders can be detected and quantitated using anti-IFN-α antibodies of the instant invention with broad reactivity against a majority of IFN-α subtypes. Anti-IFN-α antibodies are also useful for the affinity purification of various IFN-α subtypes from recombinant cell culture or natural sources.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-IFN-α antibodies can be used for the detection of IFN-α in any one of a number of well known diagnostic assay methods. For example, a biological sample may be assayed for IFN-α by obtaining the sample from a desired source, admixing the sample with anti-IFN-α antibody to allow the antibody to form antibody/IFN-α complex with any IFN-α subtype present in the mixture, and detecting any antibody/IFN-α complex present in the mixture. The biological sample may be prepared for assay by methods known in the art which are suitable for the particular sample. The methods of admixing the sample with antibodies and the methods of detecting antibody/IFN-α complex are chosen according to the type of assay used. Such assays include competitive and sandwich assays, and steric inhibition assays. Competitive and sandwich methods employ a phase-separation step as an integral part of the method while steric inhibition assays are conducted in a single reaction mixture.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalytical methods for IFN-α all use one or more of the following reagents: labeled IFN-α analogue, immobilized IFN-α analogue, labeled anti-IFN-α antibody, immobilized anti-IFN-α antibody and steric conjugates. The labeled reagents also are known as \"tracers.\"\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe label used is any detectable functionality that does not interfere with the binding of IFN-α and anti-IFN-α antibody. Numerous labels are known for use in immunoassay, examples including moieties that may be detected directly, such as fluorochrome, chemiluminescent, and radioactive labels, as well as moieties, such as enzymes, that must be reacted or derivatized to be detected. Examples of such labels include the radioisotopes \n32\nP, \n14\nC, \n125\nI, \n3\nH, and \n131\nI, fluorophores such as rare earth chelates or fluorescein and its derivatives, rhodamine and its derivatives, dansyl, umbelliferone, luceriferases, e.g., firefly luciferase and bacterial luciferase (\n \nU.S. Pat. No. 4,737,456\n \n), luciferin, 2,3-dihydrophthalazinediones, horseradish peroxidase (HRP), alkaline phosphatase, β-galactosidase, glucoamylase, lysozyme, saccharide oxidases, e.g., glucose oxidase, galactose oxidase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, heterocyclic oxidases such as uricase and xanthine oxidase, coupled with an enzyme that employs hydrogen peroxide to oxidize a dye precursor such as HRP, lactoperoxidase, or microperoxidase, biotin/avidin, spin labels, bacteriophage labels, stable free radicals, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConventional methods are available to bind these labels covalently to proteins or polypeptides. For instance, coupling agents such as dialdehydes, carbodiimides, dimaleimides, bis-imidates, bis-diazotized benzidine, and the like may be used to tag the antibodies with the above-described fluorescent, chemiluminescent, and enzyme labels. See, for example, \n \nU.S. Pat. Nos. 3,940,475\n \n (fluorimetry) and \n \n3,645,090\n \n (enzymes); \nHunter et al., Nature, 144: 945 (1962\n); \nDavid et al., Biochemistry, 13: 1014-1021 (1974\n); \nPain et al., J. Immunol. Methods, 40: 219-230 (1981\n); and \nNygren, J. Histochem. and Cytochem., 30: 407-412 (1982\n). Preferred labels herein are enzymes such as horseradish peroxidase and alkaline phosphatase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe conjugation of such label, including the enzymes, to the antibody is a standard manipulative procedure for one of ordinary skill in immunoassay techniques. See, for example, \nO'Sullivan et al., \"\nMethods for the Preparation of Enzyme-antibody Conjugates for Use in Enzyme Immunoassay,\n\" in Methods in Enzymology, ed. J.J. Langone and H. Van Vunakis, Vol. 73 (Academic Press, New York, New York, 1981), pp. 147-166\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmobilization of reagents is required for certain assay methods. Immobilization entails separating the anti-IFN-α antibody from any IFN-α that remains free in solution. This conventionally is accomplished by either insolubilizing the anti-IFN-α antibody or IFN-α analogue before the assay procedure, as by adsorption to a water-insoluble matrix or surface (\n \nBennich et a/.., U.S. 3,720,760\n \n), by covalent coupling (for example, using glutaraldehyde cross-linking), or by insolubilizing the anti-IFN-α antibody or IFN-α analogue afterward, e.g., by immunoprecipitation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther assay methods, known as competitive or sandwich assays, are well established and widely used in the commercial diagnostics industry.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompetitive assays rely on the ability of a tracer IFN-α analogue to compete with the test sample IFN-α for a limited number of anti-IFN-α antibody antigen-binding sites. The anti-IFN-α antibody generally is insolubilized before or after the competition and then the tracer and IFN-α bound to the anti-IFN-α antibody are separated from the unbound tracer and IFN-α. This separation is accomplished by decanting (where the binding partner was pre-insolubilized) or by centrifuging (where the binding partner was precipitated after the competitive reaction). The amount of test sample IFN-α is inversely proportional to the amount of bound tracer as measured by the amount of marker substance. Dose-response curves with known amounts of IFN-α are prepared and compared with the test results to quantitatively determine the amount of IFN-α present in the test sample. These assays are called ELISA systems when enzymes are used as the detectable markers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother species of competitive assay, called a \"homogeneous\" assay, does not require a phase separation. Here, a conjugate of an enzyme with the IFN-α is prepared and used such that when anti-IFN-α antibody binds to the IFN-α the presence of the anti-IFN-α antibody modifies the enzyme activity. In this case, the IFN-α or its immunologically active fragments are conjugated with a bifunctional organic bridge to an enzyme such as peroxidase. Conjugates are selected for use with anti-IFN-α antibody so that binding of the anti-IFN-α antibody inhibits or potentiates the enzyme activity of the label. This method \nper se\n is widely practiced under the name of EMIT.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSteric conjugates are used in steric hindrance methods for homogeneous assay. These conjugates are synthesized by covalently linking a low-molecular-weight hapten to a small IFN-α fragment so that antibody to hapten is substantially unable to bind the conjugate at the same time as anti-IFN-α antibody. Under this assay procedure the IFN-α present in the test sample will bind anti-IFN-α antibody, thereby allowing anti-hapten to bind the conjugate, resulting in a change in the character of the conjugate hapten, e.g., a change in fluorescence when the hapten is a fluorophore.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSandwich assays particularly are useful for the determination of IFN-α or anti-IFN-α antibodies. In sequential sandwich assays an immobilized anti-IFN-α antibody is used to adsorb test sample IFN-α, the test sample is removed as by washing, the bound IFN-α is used to adsorb a second, labeled anti-IFN-α antibody and bound material is then separated from residual tracer. The amount of bound tracer is directly proportional to test sample IFN-α. In \"simultaneous\" sandwich assays the test sample is not separated before adding the labeled anti-IFN-α. A sequential sandwich assay using an anti-IFN-α monoclonal antibody as one antibody and a polyclonal anti-IFN-α antibody as the other is useful in testing samples for IFN-α.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe foregoing are merely exemplary diagnostic assays for IFN-α. Other methods now or hereafter developed that use anti-IFN-α antibody for the determination of IFN-α are included within the scope hereof, including the bioassays described above.\n\n\n \n6. Therapeutic compositions and administration of anti-IFN-α antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nTherapeutic formulations of the anti-IFN-α antibodies of the invention are prepared for storage by mixing antibody having the desired degree of purity with optional physiologically acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers (\nRemington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 19th Edition, Alfonso, R., ed, Mack Publishing Co. (Easton, PA: 1995\n)), in the form of lyophilized cake or aqueous solutions. Acceptable carriers, excipients or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid; low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, arginine or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugar alcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol; salt-forming counterions such as sodium; and/or nonionic surfactants such as Tween, Pluronics or polyethylene glycol (PEG).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-IFN-α antibody to be used for \nin vivo\n administration must be sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes, prior to or following lyophilization and reconstitution. The anti-IFN-α antibody ordinarily will be stored in lyophilized form or in solution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherapeutic anti-IFN-α antibody compositions generally are placed into a container having a sterile access port, for example, an intravenous solution bag or vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe route of anti-IFN-α antibody administration is in accord with known methods, e.g. injection or infusion by intravenous, intraperitoneal, intracerebral, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraocular, intraarterial, intracerebrospinal, or intralesional routes, or by sustained release systems as noted below. Preferably the antibody is given systemically.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable polymer matrices in the form of shaped articles, e.g. films, or microcapsules. Sustained release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels, polylactides (\n \nU.S. 3,773,919\n \n, \n \nEP 58,481\n \n), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma ethyl-L-glutamate (\nSidman et al., Biopolymers, 22: 547-556 (1983\n)), poly (2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate) (\nLanger et al., J. Biomed. Mater. Biomed. Mater. Res., 15: 167-277 (1981\n) and \nLanger, Chem. Tech., 12: 98-105 (1982\n)), ethylene vinyl acetate (Langer \net al., supra\n) or poly-D-(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (\n \nEP 133,988\n \n). Sustained-release anti-IFNAR2 antibody compositions also include liposomally entrapped antibody. Liposomes containing antibody are prepared by methods known \nper se\n: \n \nDE 3,218,121\n \n; \nEpstein et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 82: 3688-3692 (1985\n); \nHwang et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 77: 4030-4034 (1980\n); \n \nEP 52,322\n \n; \n \nEP 36,676\n \n; \n \nEP 88,046\n \n; \n \nEP 143,949\n \n; \n \nEP 142,641\n \n; Japanese patent application \n \n83-118008\n \n; \n \nU.S. 4,485,045\n \n and \n \n4,544,545\n \n; and \n \nEP 102,324\n \n. Ordinarily the liposomes are of the small (about 200-800 Angstroms) unilamelar type in which the lipid content is greater than about 30 mol. % cholesterol, the selected proportion being adjusted for the optimal antibody therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-IFN-α antibody can also be administered by inhalation. Commercially available nebulizers for liquid formulations, including jet nebulizers and ultrasonic nebulizers are useful for administration. Liquid formulations can be directly nebulized and lyophilized powder can be nebulized after reconstitution. Alternatively, anti-IFN-α antibody can be aerosolized using a fluorocarbon formulation and a metered dose inhaler, or inhaled as a lyophilized and milled powder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn \"effective amount\" of anti-IFN-α antibody to be employed therapeutically will depend, for example, upon the therapeutic objectives, the route of administration, the type of anti-IFN-α antibody employed, and the condition of the patient. Accordingly, it will be necessary for the therapist to titer the dosage and modify the route of administration as required to obtain the optimal therapeutic effect. Typically, the clinician will administer the anti-IFN-α antibody until a dosage is reached that achieves the desired effect. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional assays.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe patients to be treated with the anti-IFN-α antibody of the invention include preclinical patients or those with recent onset of immune-mediated disorders, and particularly autoimmune disorders. Patients are candidates for therapy in accord with this invention until such point as no healthy tissue remains to be protected from immune-mediated destruction. For example, a patient suffering from insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) can benefit from therapy with an anti-IFN-α antibody of the invention until the patient's pancreatic islet cells are no longer viable. It is desirable to administer an anti-IFN-α antibody as early as possible in the development of the immune-mediated or autoimmune disorder, and to continue treatment for as long as is necessary for the protection of healthy tissue from destruction by the patient's immune system. For example, the IDDM patient is treated until insulin monitoring demonstrates adequate islet response and other indicia of islet necrosis diminish (e.g. reduction in anti-islet antibody titers), after which the patient can be withdrawn from anti-IFN-α antibody treatment for a trial period during which insulin response and the level of anti-islet antibodies are monitored for relapse.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the treatment and prevention of an immune-mediated or autoimmune disorder by an anti-IFN-α antibody, the antibody composition will be formulated, dosed, and administered in a fashion consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated, the particular mammal being treated, the clinical condition of the individual patient, the cause of the disorder, the site of delivery of the antibody, the particular type of antibody, the method of administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to medical practitioners. The \"therapeutically effective amount\" of antibody to be administered will be governed by such considerations, and is the minimum amount necessary to prevent, ameliorate, or treat the disorder, including treating chronic autoimmune conditions and immunosuppression maintenance in transplant recipients. Such amount is preferably below the amount that is toxic to the host or renders the host significantly more susceptible to infections.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a general proposition, the initial pharmaceutically effective amount of the antibody administered parenterally will be in the range of about 0.1 to 50 mg/kg of patient body weight per day, with the typical initial range of antibody used being 0.3 to 20 mg/kg/day, more preferably 0.3 to 15 mg/kg/day. The desired dosage can be delivered by a single bolus administration, by multiple bolus administrations, or by continuous infusion administration of antibody, depending on the pattern of pharmacokinetic decay that the practitioner wishes to achieve.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs noted above, however, these suggested amounts of antibody are subject to a great deal of therapeutic discretion. The key factor in selecting an appropriate dose and scheduling is the result obtained, as indicated above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibody need not be, but is optionally formulated with one or more agents currently used to prevent or treat the immune-mediated or autoimmune disorder in question. For example, in rheumatoid arthritis, the antibody may be given in conjunction with a glucocorticosteroid. The effective amount of such other agents depends on the amount of anti-IFN-α antibody present in the formulation, the type of disorder or treatment, and other factors discussed above. These are generally used in the same dosages and with administration routes as used hereinbefore or about from 1 to 99% of the heretofore employed dosages.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther details of the invention can be found in the following example, which further defines the scope of the invention. All references cited throughout the specification, and the references cited therein, are hereby expressly incorporated by reference in their entirety.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following examples are offered by way of illustration and not by way of limitation. The examples are provided so as to provide those of ordinary skill in the art with a complete disclosure and description of how to make and use the compounds, compositions, and methods of the invention and are not intended to limit the scope of what the inventors regard as their invention.

In particular, Balb/c mice were immunized into each hind footpad 9 times (at two week intervals) with 2.5 :g of lymphoblastoid hIFN-∀ (Product No. I-9887 of Sigma, St. Louis, MO) resuspended in MPL-TDM (Ribi Immunochemical Research, Inc., Hamilton, MT). Three days after the final boost, popliteal lymph node cells were fused with murine myeloma cells P3X63Ag8.U.1 (ATCC CRL1597), using 35% polyethylene glycol. Hybridomas were selected in HAT medium. Ten days after the fusion, hybridoma culture supernatants were first screened for mAbs binding to the various species of hIFN-α in an ELISA. The selected hybridoma culture supernatants were then tested for their ability to inhibit the anti-viral cytophathic effect of IFN on human lung carcinoma cell line A549 cells as described below. As indicated in \nFig. 1\n, three mAbs obtained from 1794 fusion wells were able to neutralize a diverse set of IFN-α subtypes. These three mAbs were subcloned and re-analyzed.\n\n\n \n \nNeutralization of antiviral activity of IFN-\nα\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ability of a candidate antibody to neutralize the antiviral activity of IFN-α was assayed as described by \nYousefi, S., et al., Am. J. Clin. Pathol., 83: 735-740 (1985\n). Briefly, the assay was performed using human lung carcinoma A549 cells challenged with encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus. Serial dilutions of mAbs were incubated with various units of type I interferons for one hour at 37EC in a total volume of 100 :1. These mixtures were then incubated with 5x10\n5\n A549 cells in 100 :1 of cell culture medium for 24 hours. Cells were then challenged with 2x10\n5\n pfu of EMC virus for an additional 24 hours. At the end of the incubation, cell viability was determined by visual microscopic examination or crystal violet staining. The neutralizing antibody titer (EC50) was defined as the concentration of antibody which neutralizes 50% of the anti-viral cytopathic effect by 100 units/ml of type I IFNs. The units of type I IFNs used in this study were determined using NIH reference recombinant human IFN-V2 as a standard. The specific activities of the various type I IFNs tested were as follows: IFN-∀2/-∀1 (IFN-∀2 residues 1-62/-∀1 residues 64-166) (2x10\n7\n IU/mg), IFN-∀1 (3x10\n7\n IU/mg), IFN-∀2 (2x10\n7\n IU/mg), IFN-∀5 (8x10\n7\n IU/mg), IFN-∀8 (19x10\n7\n IU/mg), and IFN-∀10 (1.5x10\n5\n IU/mg). The leukocyte IFN tested was Sigma Product No. I-2396. The lymphoblastoid IFN tested was NIH reference standard Ga23-901-532. The data shown in \nFig. 3B\n was obtained using the above-described assay format in experiments performed by Access Biomedical (San Diego, CA) at the behest of applicant.\n\n\n \n\n\nElectrophoretic mobility shift assay\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMost of the immediate actions of IFN have been linked to activation of latent cytoplasmic signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins to produce a multiprotein complex, interferon-stimulated gene factor-3 (ISGF3), which induces transcription from target promoter interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE). ISGF3 is composed of three protein subunits: STAT1, STAT2 and p48/ISGF3γ. The p48 protein belongs to the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family, and is a DNA-binding protein that directly interacts with ISRE. Thus, monitoring ISRE specific cellular DNA-binding complex in response to IFN treatment provides a simple, rapid and convenient method to assess the effect of IFN on target cells. One of the convenient formats to carry out such an analysis is electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), wherein the induction of an ISRE-binding activity by IFN treatment results in the shift in the electrophoretic mobility of a radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the consensus sequence of ISRE.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe assay was carried out essentially as described by \nKurabayashi et al., Mol. Cell Biol., 15: 6386 (1995\n). Briefly, 5 ng of a specific IFN-α subtype plus various concentrations (5-100 µg/ml) of anti-IFN-α mAbs were incubated with 5x10\n5\n HeLa cells in 200 µl of DMEM for 30 minutes at 37°C. Cells were preincubated with antibody for 15 minutes at 4°C before the addition of the hIFN-∀. Cells were washed in PBS and resuspended in 125 µl buffer A (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mM KCl, 0.1 mM ETDA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 10 µg/ml aprotinin). After a 15 minute incubation on ice, cells were lysed by the addition of 0.025% NP40. The nuclear pellet was obtained by centrifugation and was resuspended in 50 µl buffer B (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 400 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, I mM DTT, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 10 µg/ml aprotinin) and kept on ice for 30 min. The nuclear fraction was cleared by centrifugation and the supernatant stored at - 70°C until use. Double-stranded probes were prepared from single-stranded oligonucleotides (ISG15 top : 5'-GATCGGGAAAGGGAAACCGAAACTGAAGCC-3' [SEQ ID NO. 13], ISG15 bottom: 5'-GATCGGCTTCAGTTTCGGTTTCCCTTTC CC-3' [SEQ ID NO. 14]) utilizing a DNA polymerase I Klenow filling reaction with \n32\nP- dATP (3,000 Ci/mM, Amersham). Labeled oligonucleotides were purified from unincorporated radioactive nucleotides using BIO-Spin 30 columns (Bio-Rad). Binding reactions containing 5 µl nuclear extract, 25,000 cpm of labeled probe and 2 µg of non-specific competitor poly (dI-dC)-poly (dI-dC) in 15 µl binding buffer (10 mM Tris-HCL, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 15% glycerol) were incubated at RT for 30 minutes. DNA-protein complexes were resolved in 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by autoradiograph. The specificity of the assay was determined by the addition of 350 ng of unlabeled ISG15 probe in separate reaction mixtures. Formation of an ISGF3 specific complex was confirmed by a super shift assay with anti-STAT1 antibody.\n\n\n \n \nCloning of a gene encoding 9F3 anti-IFN-\nα \nmonoclonal antibody\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe murine anti-human IFN-α mAb 9F3 was generated, cloned and sequenced. The plasmid pEMXI used for expression and mutagenesis of F(ab)s in \nE. coli\n has been described previously (\nWerther et al., J. Immunol. 157: 4986-4995 [1996\n]). Briefly, the plasmid contains a DNA fragment encoding a consensus \nhuman κ subgroup\n 1 light chain (VLκl-CL) and a consensus human subgroup III heavy chain (VHIII-CH1) and an alkaline phosphatase promoter. The use of the consensus sequences for VL and VH has been described previously (\nCarter et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89: 4285-4289 [1992\n]).\n\n\n \n\n\nResults\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nWe have previously shown that there is a wide spectrum of IFN-α subtypes expressed by the islets of patients with IDDM (\nHuang et al., Diabetes 44: 658-664 [1995\n]). We also demonstrated that there is no obvious association between IDDM and the expression of either IFN-β or IFN-γ (Huang \net al.,\n [1995] \nsupra\n). While the specific IFN-α subtypes expressed as part of the SLE pathology have not been defined, as with IDDM, the association is with IFN-α and not with either of IFN-β or IFN-γ (\nHooks, et al., Arthritis & Rheumatism 25: 396-400 [1982\n]; \nKim, et al., Clin. Exp. Immunol. 70: 562-569 [1987\n]; \nLacki, et al., J. Med. 28: 99-107 [1997\n]; \nRobak, et al., Archivum Immunologiae et Therapiae Experimentalis 46: 375-380 [1998\n]; \nShiozawa, et al., Arthritis & Rheumatism 35: 417-422 [1992\n]; \nvon Wussow, et al., Rheumatology International 8: 225-230 [1988\n]). These observations led us to propose that a candidate antibody for therapeutic intervention in IDDM or SLE would need to neutralize a majority of the IFN-α subtypes while leaving intact the activities of other interferons (β, γ and ω) and interleukins that may be required for host defense.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne of them (9F3) was able to neutralize a wide spectrum of recombinant interferon α subtypes and was further characterized. As shown in \nFig. 2A\n, 9F3 was able to neutralize the anti-viral activity of seven recombinant interferons, IFN-α - 2, 4, 5, 8 and 10 (\nFig. 2\n) and IFN-\nα\n 1 and 21 (Table 2 and \nFig. 6\n). These IFN-α subtypes cover the full spectrum of sequences as projected in a type I interferon sequence dendrogram. More importantly, the 9F3 mAb that neutralized the IFN-α subtypes was unable to neutralize IFN-β (\nFig. 2\n, Table 2) or IFN-(. The small increase in activity shown in \nFig. 2\n for IFN-β was not reproducible in other assays and appears to be the result of assay variation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther mAbs that are neutralizing toward IFN-α have been developed (\nTsukui et al., Microbiol. Immunol. 30: 1129-1139 [1986\n]; \nBerg, J. Interferon Res. 4: 481-491 [1984\n]; \nMeager and Berg, J Interferon Res. 6:729-736 [1986\n]; \n \nUS Patent No. 4,902,618\n \n; and \n \nEP publication No. 0,139,676 B1\n \n). However, these antibodies neutralize only a limited number of recombinant IFN-α subtypes and are unable to neutralize a wide spectrum of IFN-α subtypes such as those produced by activated leukocytes. In contrast, 9F3 Mab was able to neutralize at least 95% of the anti-viral activity in the heterogeneous collection of IFN-α subtypes produced by activated leukocytes (\nFig. 3A\n). Similarly, 9F3 mAb was also able to block the anti-viral activity of an independent preparation of lymphoblastoid IFN (NIH reference standard) as determined in an independent experiment (\nFig. 3B\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ability of 9F3 mAb to neutralize IFN-α was also tested using an alternative bioassay. The assay was based on the ability of IFN-α to activate the binding of the signaling molecule, interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), to an oligonucleotide derived from the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) in a DNA binding assay known as electrophoretic mobility shift assay (\nHorvath et al., Genes Dev. 9: 984-994 [1995\n]). The transduction of type I interferon signals to the nucleus relies on activation of a protein complex, ISGF3, involving two signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins, STAT1 and STAT2, and the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) protein, p48/ISGF3γ (\nWathelet et al., Mol. Cell 1: 507-518 [1998\n]). The latter is a DNA sequence recognition subunit of ISGF3 and directly interacts with ISRE (\nMcKendry et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88: 11455-11459 [1991\n]; \nJohn et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 11: 4189-4195 [1991\n]). The treatment of COS cells with either IFN-α or IFN-β led to the appearance of a complex corresponding to the binding of ISGF3 to the ISRE derived probe. The appearance of the IFN-α-induced but not the IFN-β-induced complex was blocked by 9F3 mAb (\nFig. 4\n). Furthermore, 9F3 mAb was able to neutralize the activity of six recombinant IFN-α subtypes that were tested in this assay (Table 2).\n\n \n \nTable 2\n \n \n \n \nInhibition of ISGF3 formation induced by type I IFNs by mAb 9F3\n \n \n \n \nmAb\n \nIFN-α2/1\n \nIFN-α1\n \nIFN-α2\n \nIFN-α5\n \nIFN-α8\n \nIFN-α21\n \nIFN-β\n \n \n \n9F3.18.5\n \n+++\n \n+++\n \n+++\n \n+\n \n+++\n \n+++\n \n-\n \n \n \nIgG1\n \n-\n \n-\n \n-\n \n-\n \n-\n \n-\n \n-\n \n \n \n \n\nThe extent of inhibition of the IFN induced complex by 9F3 is indicated where - indicates that the induced band was not altered; + indicates that the band was partially lost and +++ indicates that the induced band was largely abolished. mAb was used at 10 µg/ml; IFN-α was used at 25 ng/ml\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHaving established that 9F3 was able to neutralize both a wide variety of recombinant IFN-α subtypes and the mixture of IFN-α subtypes produced by activated leukocytes, we cloned and sequenced the cDNAs encoding both the heavy and light chains of 9F3 mAb. The heavy and light chains were purified and the N terminal amino acid sequences derived were used to design degenerate 5' primers corresponding to the N terminus, and the 3' primers were designed corresponding to the constant domain of mouse κ light chain and IgG2 heavy chain. The corresponding cDNAs were cloned using conventional PCR technique and the nucleotide sequence of the inserts was determined. \nFigure 5\n shows sequence alignment of VL (5A) and VH (5B) domains of a murine 9F3 monoclonal antibody, a humanized version (V13) and consensus sequence of the human heavy chain subgroup III and the human κ light chain subgroup III. In order to ensure that the cDNAs that were cloned encoded the correct Mab reflecting the specificity and characteristics of 9F3 mAb, recombinant chimeric proteins were generated that utilized the mouse cDNA sequences shown in \nFig. 5\n and a human CH1 domain. The resultant chimera (CH8-2) was able to fully neutralize various recombinant IFN-α subtypes (\nFig. 6\n). The amino acid sequences for the heavy and light chains were then used to generate a humanized antibody.\n\n\n \nExample 2. \nHumanization of 9F3 pan-IFN-α neutralizing monoclonal antibody\n \n\n\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstruction of Humanized F(ab)s\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTo construct the first F(ab) variant of humanized 9F3, site-directed mutagenesis (\nKunkel, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82: 488-492 [1985\n]) was performed on a deoxyuridine-containing template of pEMXI. The six CDRs were changed to the murine 9F3 sequence (\nFig. 5\n); the residues included in each CDR were from the sequence-based CDR definitions (Kabat \net al.,\n (1991) \nsupra).\n F-1 therefore consisted of a complete human framework (\nVL κ subgroup\n 1 and VH subgroup III) with the six complete murine CDR sequences. Plasmids for all other F(ab) variants were constructed from the plasmid template of F-1. Plasmids were transformed into \nE. coli\n strain XL-1 Blue (Stratagene, San Diego, CA) for preparation of double- and single-stranded DNA using commercial kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). For each variant, DNA coding for light and heavy chains was completely sequenced using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (Sequenase, U.S. Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH). Plasmids were transformed into \nE. coli\n strain 16C9, a derivative of MM294, plated onto Luria broth plates containing 50 µg/ml carbenicillin, and a single colony selected for protein expression. The single colony was grown in 5 ml Luria broth-100 µg/ml carbenicillin for 5-8 h at 37°C. The 5 ml culture was added to 500 ml AP5 medium containing 50 µg/ml carbenicillin and allowed to grow for 20 h in a 4 L baffled shake flask at 30°C. AP5 medium consists of: 1.5 g glucose, 11.0 g Hycase SF, 0.6 g yeast extract (certified), 0.19 g MgSO\n4\n (anhydrous), 1.07 g NH\n4\nCl, 3.73 g KCI, 1.2 g NaCl, 120 ml 1M triethanolamine, pH 7.4, to 1 L water and then sterile filtered through 0.1 µm Sealkeen filter. Cells were harvested by centrifugation in a 1 L centrifuge bottle at 3000xg and the supernatant removed. After freezing for 1 h, the pellet was resuspended in 25 ml cold 10 mM Tris-1 mM EDTA-20% sucrose, pH 7.5, 250 µl of 0.1 M benzamidine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was added to inhibit proteolysis. After gentle stirring on ice for 3 h, the sample was centrifuged at 40,000xg for 15 min. The supernatant was then applied to a Protein G-Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) column (0.5 ml bed volume) equilibrated with 10 mM Tris-1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5. The column was washed with 10 ml of 10 mM Tris-1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5, and eluted with 3 ml 0.3 M glycine, pH 3.0, into 1.25 ml 1 M Tris, pH 8.0. The F(ab) was then buffer exchanged into PBS using a Centricon-30 (Amicon, Beverly, MA) and concentrated to a final volume of 0.5 ml. SDS-PAGE gels of all F(ab)s were run to ascertain purity and the molecular weight of each variant was verified by electrospray mass spectrometry. F(ab) concentrations were determined using quantitative amino acid analysis.\n\n\n \n\n\nConstruction of Chimeric and Humanized 1gG\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nFor generation of human IgG2 versions of chimeric and humanized 9F3, the appropriate murine or humanized VL and VH (F-13, Table 3) domains were subcloned into separate previously described pRK vectors (\nEaton et al., Biochemistry 25: 8343-8347 [1986\n]) that contained DNA coding for human IgG2 CH1-Fc or human light chain CL domain. The DNA coding for the entire light and the entire heavy chain of each variant was verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. The chimeric IgG consists of the entire murine 9F3 VH domain fused to a human CHI domain at amino acid SerH113 and the entire murine 9F3 VL domain fused to a human CL domain at amino acid LysL 107.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHeavy and light chain plasmids were co-transfected into an adenovirus-transformed human embryonic kidney cell line, 293 (\nGraham et al., J. Gen. Virol. 36: 59-74 [1977\n]), using a high efficiency procedure (\nGorman et al., DNA Prot. Eng. Tech. 2: 3-10 [1990\n]). Media was changed to serum-free and harvested daily for up to five days. Antibodies were purified from the pooled supernatants using Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia). The eluted antibody was buffer exchanged into PBS using a Centricon-30 (Amicon), concentrated to 0.5 ml, sterile filtered using a Millex-GV (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and stored at 4°C. IgG2 concentrations were determined using quantitative amino acid analysis.\n\n\n \n\n\nIFN-α Binding Assay\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn the ELISA, 96 well microtiter plates (Nunc) were coated by adding 50 µl of 0.1 µg/ml IFN-α in PBS to each well and incubated at 4°C overnight. The plates were then washed three times with wash buffer (PBS plus 0.05% Tween 20). The wells in microtiter plates were then blocked with 200 µl of SuperBlock (Pierce) and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. The plates were then washed again three times with wash buffer. After washing step, 100 µl of serial dilutions of humanized mAb starting at 10 µg/ml were added to designated wells. The plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour on a shaker apparatus and then washed three times with wash buffer. Next, 100 µl of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-human Fab specific (Cappel), diluted at 1:1000 in assay buffer (0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.05\n% Tween\n 20 in PBS), was added to each well. The plates were incubated at room temperature on a shaker apparatus and then washed three times with wash buffer, followed by addition of 100 µl of substrate (TMB, 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine; Kirkegaard & Perry) to each well and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 µl of stop solution (from Kirkegaard & Perry) to each well, and absorbance at 450 nm was read in an automated microtiter plate reader.\n\n\n \n \nBIAcore\n™ \nBiosensor Assay\n \n\n\n \n \n \nIFN-α binding of the humanized F(ab)s, chimeric and humanized IgG2 antibodies were measured using a BIACore™ biosensor (\nKarlsson et al., Methods: A. companion to Methods in Enzymology 6: 97-108 [1994\n]). The IFN-α was immobilized on the sensor chip at 60 µg/ml in 50 mM MES buffer, pH 6.3. Antibodies were exposed to the chip at 75 µg/ml (500 nM) in phosphate-buffered saline/1% Tween-20. The antibody on-rate (k\non\n) was measured.\n\n\n \n\n\nComputer Graphics Modes of Murine and Humanized F(ab)s\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nSequences of the VL and VH domains (\nFig. 5A\n and \nB\n) were used to construct a computer graphics model of the murine 9F3 VL-VH domains (\nFig. 7\n). This model was used to determine which framework residues should be incorporated into the humanized antibody. A model of the humanized F(ab) was also constructed to verify correct selection of murine framework residues. Construction of models was performed as described previously (Carter \net al.,\n [1992] \nsupra\n; Werther \net al.,\n [1996] \nsupra).\n \n\n\n \n\n\nResults\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe consensus sequence for the human heavy chain subgroup III and the light chain subgroup I were used as the framework for the humanization as shown in \nFig. 5\n (Kabat \net al\n., (1991), \nsupra\n). This framework has been successfully used in the humanization of other murine antibodies (\nCarter et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89: 4285-4289 [1992\n]; \nPresta et al., J. Immunol. 151: 2623-2632 [1993\n]; \nEigenbrot et al., Proteins 18: 49-62 [1994\n]; \nWerther et al., J. Immunol. 157: 4986-4995 [1996\n]). All humanized variants were initially made and screened for binding as F(ab)s expressed in \nE. coli.\n Typical yields from 500 ml shake flasks were 0.1-0.4 mg F(ab).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe complementarity determining region (CDR) residues have been defined either based on sequence hypervariability (Kabat \net al.,\n (1991) \nsupra\n) or crystal structure of F(ab)-antigen complexes (\nChothia et al., Nature 342: 877-883 [1989\n]). Although the sequence-based CDRs are larger than the structure-based CDRs, the two definitions are generally in agreement except for CDR-H1. According to the sequence-based definition, CDR-H1 includes residues H31-H35, whereas the structure-based system defines residues H26-H32 as CDR-H1 (light chain residue numbers are prefixed with L; heavy chain residue numbers are prefixed with H). For the present study, CDR-H1 was defined as a combination of the two, i.e. including residues H26-H35. The other CDRs were defined using the sequence-based definition (Kabat \net al.,\n (1991) \nsupra\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the initial variant, F-1, the CDR residues were transferred from the murine antibody to the human framework. In addition, F(ab)s which consisted of the chimeric heavy chain with F-1 light chain (Ch-1) and F-1 heavy chain with chimeric light chain (Ch-2) were generated and tested for binding. F-1 bound IFN-α poorly (Table 3). Comparing the binding affinities of Ch-1 and Ch-2 (Table 3) suggested that framework residues in the F-1 VH domain needed to be altered in order to increase binding.\n\n \n \nTable 3\n \n \n \n \nHumanized Anti-IFN-α Versions\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOD\n450nm\n at 10 µg/ml\n \n \n \nVersion\n \nTemplate\n \nChanges\na\n \n \nMean\n \nSD\n \nN\n \n \n \n \nCh-1\n \nF-1 VL/ Murine VH\n \n \n \n1.45\n \n0.11\n \n3\n \n \n \nCh-2\n \nMurine VL/ F-2 VH\n \n \n \n.024\n \n0.04\n \n3\n \n \n \nF-1\n \nHuman FR/ CDR swap\n \n \n \n0.06\n \n0.00\n \n3\n \n \n \nF-2\n \nF-1\n \nArgH71Leu; AsnH73Lys\n \n0.08\n \n0.01\n \n3\n \n \n \nF-3\n \nF-2\n \nPheH67Ala; IleH69Leu; LeuH78Ala\n \n0.14\n \n0.02\n \n3\n \n \n \nF-4\n \nF-3\n \nArgH94Ser\n \n0.495\n \n0.02\n \n3\n \n \n \nF-5\n \nF-4\n \nAlaH24Thr\n \n0.545\n \n0.03\n \n3\n \n \n \nF-6\n \nF-5\n \nValH48I1e; AlaH49Gly\n \n0.527\n \n0.02\n \n2\n \n \n \n \nF-7\n \n \n \nF-5\n \n \n \nA1aH78Leu\n \n \n0.259\n \n0.02\n \n2\n \n \n \n \nF-8\n \n \n \nF-5\n \n \n \nLeuH69Ile\n \n \n0.523\n \n0.05\n \n3\n \n \n \n \nF-9\n \n \n \nF-5\n \n \n \nAlaH67Phe\n \n \n0.675\n \n0.09\n \n3\n \n \n \n \nF-10\n \n \n \nF-9\n \n \n \nLeuH69Ile\n \n \n0.690\n \n0.03\n \n3\n \n \n \nF-11\n \nF-10\n \nLysH75Ser\n \n0.642\n \n0.06\n \n3\n \n \n \nF-12\n \nF-10\n \nAsnH76Arg\n \n0.912\n \n0.05\n \n3\n \n \n \nF-13\n \nF-12\n \nLeuL46Val TyrL49Ser\n \n1.050\n \n0.16\n \n3\n \n \n \n \nF-14\n \n \n \nF-13\n \n \n \nLeuH71Arg\n \n \n0.472\n \n0.06\n \n3\n \n \n \n \nF-15\n \n \n \nF-13\n \n \n \nLysH73Asn\n \n \n0.868\n \n0.32\n \n3\n \n \n \n \n \n \na\nMurine residues are in bold; residue numbers are according to Kabat et al.

Fab binding to IFN-α was assayed by ELISA and results are provided as OD\n450 nm\n at 10 µg/ml. SD, standard deviation; n, number of experimental replicates.\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrevious humanizations (\nXiang et al., J. Mol. Biol. 253: 385-390 [1995\n]; Werther \net al\n., [1996] \nsupra)\n as well as studies of F(ab)-antigen crystal structures (Chothia \net al\n., [1989] \nsupra\n;\n Tramontano et al., J Mol. Biol. 215: 175-182 [1990\n]) have shown that residues H71 and H73 can have a profound effect on binding, possibly by influencing the conformations of CDR-H1 and CDR-H2. Changing the human residues at positions H71 and H73 to their murine counterparts improved binding only slightly (version F-2, Table 3). Further simultaneous changes at positions H67, H69 and H78 (version F-3) followed by changes ArgH94Ser (version F-4) and AlaH24Thr (version F-5) significantly improved binding (Table 3). Since positions H67, H69 and H78 had been changed simultaneously, each was individually altered back to the human consensus framework residue; versions F-7, F-8, F-9, and F-10 show that the human residue is preferred at position H67, position H69 does not show any preference for the human or murine residue, and the murine residue is preferred at position H78.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe have found during previous humanizations that residues in a framework loop, FR-3 (Kabat \net al.,\n (1991) \nsupra\n), adjacent to CDR-H1 and CDR-H2 can affect binding (Eigenbrot \net al.,\n (1994) \nsupra\n). Accordingly, two residues in this loop were changed to their murine counterparts: LysH75 to murine Ser (version F-11) and AsnH76 to murine Arg (version F-12). Only the AsnH76Arg change effected an improvement in binding (Table 3).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInspection of the models of the murine and humanized F(ab)s suggested that residue L46, buried at the VL-VH interface and interacting with CDR-H3, might also play a role either in determining the conformation of CDR-H3 and/or affecting the interactions between the VL and VH domains. Similarly, L49 position which is adjacent to CDR-L2 differs between the human consensus (Tyr) and the 9F3 (Ser) sequence. Therefore, LeuL46Val and TyrL49Ser residues were simultaneously substituted, which resulted in a variant (F-13) with further improvement in the binding (Table 3). Based on its best binding among all the variants generated, F-13 was chosen as the final humanized version.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA humanized recombinant anti-IFN-α monoclonal antibody (V13IgG2) was generated by fusing VH and VL domains derived from F-13 to human IgG2 CH1-Fc and human CL domains respectively. The K\nON\n rates and K\nD\n values of V13IgG2 were then compared with a chimeric IgG2 or murine 9F3. BIACore™ measurement of V13IgG2 and chimeric IgG2 binding to immobilized IFN-α showed that their K\nON\n rates were similar (Table 4). Affinity measurement using Kinexa™ technology showed that the affinity of V13IgG2 for IFNα was reduced by 2-fold compared to the parental murine 9F3 antibody (Table 4).\n\n \n \nTable 4\n \n \n \n \nBIACore™ and Kinexa™ Data for Anti-IFNα Antibodies\n \n \n \nAntibody\na\n \n \nK\non\n(µM/sec)\n \nKd (nM)\nb\n \n \nMethod\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n0.14\n \nBIACore™\n \n \n \nChIgG2\n \n3.9\n \n \n \nBIACore™\n \n \n \nV13IgG2\n \n3.3\n \n \n \nBIACore™\n \n \n \nV13Fab\n \n \n \n4.1\n \nBIACore™\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody\na\n \n \nK\nD\n(pM)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmurine 9F3\n \n1.5\n \n \n \nKinexa™\n \n \n \nV 13Fab\n \n3.4\n \n \n \nKinexa™\n \n \n \n \n \n \na\nV13IgG2 is F-13 VH domain joined to human IgG2 CH1-Fc and F-13 VL domain joined to a human CL domain; ChIgG2 is mouse 9F3 VH domain joined to human IgG2 CH1-Fc and mouse 9F3 VL domain joined to human CL domain. \nb\nKoff/Kon.\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\nDeposit of Material\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following materials have been deposited with the American Type Culture Collection, 10801 University Blvd., Manassas, VA 20110-2209, USA (ATCC):\n\n \n \n \n \n \nMaterial\n \nATCC Dep.
