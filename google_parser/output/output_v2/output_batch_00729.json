It is known that various sphingolipids, having sphingosine as a constituent, are widely distributed in the living body including on the surface of cell membranes of cells in the nervous system.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA sphingolipid is one of the lipids having important roles in the living body. A disease called lipidosis is caused by accumulation of a specified sphingolipid in the body. Sphingolipids present on cell membranes function to regulate cell growth; participate in the development and differentiation of cells; function in nerves; are involved in the infection and malignancy of cells; etc. Many of the physiological roles of sphingolipids remain to be solved. Recently the possibility that ceramide, a derivative of sphingosine, has an important role in the mechanism of cell signal transduction has been indicated, and studies about its effect on apoptosis and cell cycle have been reported.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSphingosine-1-phosphate is an important cellular metabolite, derived from ceramide that is synthesized de novo or as part of the sphingomyeline cycle (in animal's cells). It has also been found in insects, yeasts and plants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe enzyme, ceramidase, acts upon ceramides to release sphingosine, which is phosphorylated by sphingosine kinase, a ubiquitous enzyme in the cytosol and endoplasmic reticulum, to form sphingosine-1-phosphate. The reverse reaction can occur also by the action of sphingosine phosphatases, and the enzymes act in concert to control the cellular concentrations of the metabolite, which concentrations are always low. In plasma, such concentration can reach 0.2 to 0.9 μM, and the metabolite is found in association with the lipoproteins, especially the HDL. It should also be noted that sphingosine-1-phosphate formation is an essential step in the catabolism of sphingoid bases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLike its precursors, sphingosine-1-phosphate is a potent messenger molecule that perhaps uniquely operates both intra- and inter-cellularly, but with very different functions from ceramides and sphingosine. The balance between these various sphingolipid metabolites may be important for health. For example, within the cell, sphingosine-1-phosphate promotes cellular division (mitosis) as opposed to cell death (apoptosis), which it inhibits. Intracellularly, it also functions to regulate calcium mobilization and cell growth in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli. Current opinion appears to suggest that the balance between sphingosine-1-phosphate and ceramide and/or sphingosine levels in cells is critical for their viability. In common with the lysophospholipids, especially lysophosphatidic acid, with which it has some structural similarities, sphingosine-1-phosphate exerts many of its extra-cellular effects through interaction with five specific G protein-coupled receptors on cell surfaces. These are important for the growth of new blood vessels, vascular maturation, cardiac development and immunity, and for directed cell movement.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSphingosine-1 phosphate is stored in relatively high concentrations in human platelets, which lack the enzymes responsible for its catabolism, and it is released into the blood stream upon activation of physiological stimuli, such as growth factors, cytokines, and receptor agonists and antigens. It may also have a critical role in platelet aggregation and thrombosis and could aggravate cardiovascular disease. On the other hand the relatively high concentration of the metabolite in high-density lipoproteins (HDL) may have beneficial implications for atherogenesis. For example, there are recent suggestions that sphingosine-1-phosphate, together with other lysolipids such as sphingosylphosphorylcholine and lysosulfatide, are responsible for the beneficial clinical effects of HDL by stimulating the production of the potent antiatherogenic signaling molecule nitric oxide by the vascular endothelium. In addition, like lysophosphatidic acid, it is a marker for certain types of cancer, and there is evidence that its role in cell division or proliferation may have an influence on the development of cancers. These are currently topics that are attracting great interest amongst medical researchers, and the potential for therapeutic intervention in sphingosine-1-phosphate metabolism is under active investigation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFungi and plants have sphingolipids and the major sphingosine contained in these organisms has the formula described below. It is known that these lipids have important roles in the cell growth of fungi and plants, but details of the roles remain to be solved.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecently it has been known that derivatives of sphingolipids and their related compounds exhibit a variety of biological activities through inhibition or stimulation of the metabolism pathways. These compounds include inhibitors of protein kinase C, inducers of apoptosis, immuno-suppressive compounds, antifungal compounds, and the like. Substances having these biological activities are expected to be useful compounds for various diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPublished International Patent Application No. WO 2008037476 describes generically oxadiazoles derivatives with anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPublished International Patent Application No. WO 2006131336 describes generically polycyclic oxadiazoles or isoxazoles as S1P receptor ligands.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPublished International Patent Application No. WO 2009151621 describes substituted (1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl) indolin-1-yl carboxylic acid derivatives useful as S1P1 agonists.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe synthesis of new 1,2,4- and 1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives structurally related to non-peptide angiotensin II (AII) receptor antagonists is described in Synthesis (2003) Issue 6, pages 899-905.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention provides certain well-defined compounds that are useful as sphingosine-1-phosphate modulators.

The phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable” means the carrier, diluent or excipient must be compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be used in the form of a solid, a solution, an emulsion, a dispersion, a micelle, a liposome, and the like, wherein the resulting composition contains one or more compounds of the present invention, as an active ingredient, in admixture with an organic or inorganic carrier or excipient suitable for enteral or parenteral applications. Invention compounds may be combined, for example, with the usual non-toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers for tablets, pellets, capsules, suppositories, solutions, emulsions, suspensions, and any other form suitable for use. The carriers which can be used include glucose, lactose, gum acacia, gelatin, mannitol, starch paste, magnesium trisilicate, talc, corn starch, keratin, colloidal silica, potato starch, urea, medium chain length triglycerides, dextrans, and other carriers suitable for use in manufacturing preparations, in solid, semisolid, or liquid form.

For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides, fatty acids (including oleic acid), naturally occurring vegetable oils like sesame oil, coconut oil, peanut oil, cottonseed oil, etc., or synthetic fatty vehicles like ethyl oleate or the like. Buffers, preservatives, antioxidants, and the like can be incorporated as required.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInvention compounds may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions may be prepared by mixing the invention compounds with a suitable non-irritating excipient, such as cocoa butter, synthetic glyceride esters of polyethylene glycols, which are solid at ordinary temperatures, but liquify and/or dissolve in the rectal cavity to release the drug.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSince individual subjects may present a wide variation in severity of symptoms and each drug has its unique therapeutic characteristics, the precise mode of administration and dosage employed for each subject is left to the discretion of the practitioner.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds and pharmaceutical compositions described herein are useful as medicaments in mammals, including humans, for treatment of diseases and or alleviations of conditions which are responsive to treatment by agonists or functional antagonists of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors. Thus, in further embodiments of the invention, there are provided methods for treating a disorder associated with modulation of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors. Such methods can be performed, for example, by administering to a subject in need thereof a pharmaceutical composition containing a therapeutically effective amount of at least one invention compound. As used herein, the term “therapeutically effective amount” means the amount of the pharmaceutical composition that will elicit the biological or medical response of a subject in need thereof that is being sought by the researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician. In some embodiments, the subject in need thereof is a mammal. In some embodiments, the mammal is human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention concerns also processes for preparing the compounds of Formula I.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula I according to the invention can be prepared analogously to conventional methods as understood by the person skilled in the art of synthetic organic chemistry.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe synthetic scheme set forth below, illustrates how compounds according to the invention can be made.

The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes. To the reaction mixture was added imidazole derivative (b) (1.1 mmol) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (8 mL); the resulting mixture was stirred at 50° C. for 2 hours. The reaction mixture was then transferred to a microwave (MWI) vial and heated at 150° C. for 20 minutes. After cooling to room temperature the mixture was diluted with water and extracted with ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate phase was washed with water and brine, dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated.

Unless it is specifically noted otherwise, the scope of the present invention includes all enantiomers, diastereomers and racemic mixtures. Some of the compounds of the invention may form salts with pharmaceutically acceptable acids or bases, and such pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds described herein are also within the scope of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention includes all pharmaceutically acceptable isotopically enriched compounds.

Similar substitutions can be employed for N, O and S. The use of isotopes may assist in analytical as well as therapeutic aspects of the invention. For example, use of deuterium may increase the in vivo half-life by altering the metabolism (rate) of the compounds of the invention. These compounds can be prepared in accord with the preparations described by use of isotopically enriched reagents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following examples are for illustrative purposes only and are not intended, nor should they be construed as limiting the invention in any manner.

These compounds may be assessed for their ability to activate or block activation of the human S1P1 receptor in cells stably expressing the S1P1 receptor. GTP γ\n35\nS binding was measured in the medium containing (mM) HEPES 25, pH 7.4, \nMgCl\n \n \n \n2 \n10, NaCl 100, dithitothreitol 0.5, digitonin 0.003%, 0.2 nM GTP γ\n35\nS, and 5 μg membrane protein in a volume of 150 μl. Test compounds were included in the concentration range from 0.08 to 5,000 nM unless indicated otherwise. Membranes were incubated with 100 \nμM\n 5′-adenylylimmidodiphosphate for 30 min, and subsequently with 10 μM GDP for 10 min on ice. Drug solutions and membrane were mixed, and then reactions were initiated by adding GTP γ\n35\nS and continued for 30 min at 25° C. Reaction mixtures were filtered over Whatman GF/B filters under vacuum, and washed three times with 3 mL of ice-cold buffer (HEPES 25, pH 7.4, \nMgCl\n \n \n \n2 \n10 and NaCl 100). Filters were dried and mixed with scintillant, and counted for \n35\nS activity using a β-counter. Agonist-induced GTP γ\n35\nS binding was obtained by subtracting that in the absence of agonist. Binding data were analyzed using a non-linear regression method. In case of antagonist assay, the reaction mixture contained 10 nM S1P in the presence of test antagonist at concentrations ranging from 0.08 to 5000 nM.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

Description\n\n\n\n\nAMINOPYRIMIDINE DERIVATIVES AND THEIR AS AS ADENOSINE A2A RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS \n\n\nField of the invention The present invention relates to new pyrimidine derivatives conveniently substituted as antagonists of the adenosine A\n2a\n receptor. Other objectives of the present invention are to provide a method for preparing such compounds, pharmaceutical compositions comprising an effective amount of these compounds, the use of compounds in the manufacture of a medicament to treat pathological affections or diseases that can be improved by antagonism of the adenosine A\n2a\n receptor. \n\n\nBackground of the invention \n\n\nThe effects of adenosine are mediated through at least four specific cell membrane receptors so far identified and classified as receptors Aj, A\n2A\n, A\n2\nB and A\n3\n belonging to the G protein-coupled receptor family. The A] and A\n3\n receptors down-regulate cellular cAMP levels through their coupling to Gj proteins, which inhibit adenylate cyclase. In contrast, A\n2A\n and A\n2B\n receptors couple to G\ns\n proteins that activate adenylate cyclase and increase intracellular levels of cAMP. Through these receptors, adenosine regulates a wide range of physiological functions. \n\n\nSeveral preclinical studies demonstrate the usefulness of adenosine A\n2A\n receptor antagonists to treat neurodegenerative diseases, mainly Parkinson's, Huntington's or Alzheimer's diseases (Trends in Neurosci. 2006, 29(1 1), 647-654; Expert Opinion Ther. Patents, 2007, 17, 979- 991 ; Exp.Neurol. 2003, 184(1), 285-284; Prog. Brain Res, 2010, 183, 183-208; J. Alzheimer Dis. 2010, Suppl 1, 1 17-126; J. Neurosci. 2009, 29(47), 14741-14751 ; Neuroscience, 2010, 166(2), 590-603; J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2009, 330(1), 294-303; Frontiers Biosci. 2008, 13, 2614-2632). \n\n\nBesides the welcome utility of A\n2A\n receptor antagonists to treat neurodegenerative diseases, those compounds have been considered for complementary symptomatic indications. These are based on the evidence that A\n2A\n receptor activation may contribute to the pathophysiology of a range of neuropsychiatric disorders and dysfunctions such as depression, excessive daytime sleepiness, restless legs syndrome, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and cognitive fatigue (Neurology, 2003, 61(1 1 Suppl 6), S82-S87; Behav. Pharmacol. 2009, 20(2), 134-145; CNS Drug Discov. 2007, 2(1), 1-21 ). \n\n Some authors suggest the application of A\n2\n antagonists for the treatment of diabetes (WO1999035147; WO2001002400). \n\n\nOther studies suggest the involvement of A\n2a\n adenosine receptors in wound healing or atrial fibrillation (Am J Path, 2007, 6, 1774- 1778; Arthritis & Rheumatism, 2006, 54(8), 2632-2642). \n\n\nFor this reason, there is an increasing interest in the discovery of novel, potent and selective adenosine A\n2a\n antagonists. Some of the potent adenosine A\n2a\n antagonists discovered in the past by the pharmaceutical companies, have advanced into clinical trials showing positive results and demonstrating the potential of this compound class for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's, Huntington's or Alzheimer's disease, but also in other CNS related diseases like depression, restless syndrome, sleep and anxiety disorders (Clin. Neuropharmacol. 2010, 33, 55-60; J. Neurosci. 2010, 30(48), 16284-16292; Parkinsonisn Relat. Disord. 2010, 16(6), 423-426; \\Expert Opinion Ther. Patents, 2010, 20(8), 987-1005; Current Opinion in Drug Discovery & Development, 2010, 13(4), 466-480 and references therein; Mov. Disorders, 2010, 25(2), S305). \n\n\nThe present invention relates to novel 4-amino-pyrimidine derivatives as potent antagonists of the adenosine A\n2a\n receptor. There are reports in the literature showing that 4-aminopyrimidines of formula: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWherein R\n1\n and R\n3\n can be heteroaryl groups and R\n2\n can be a hydrogen atom or a substituted alkyl chain are potent adenosine A\n2a\n receptor antagonists (e.g. WO 2005058883 Al; WO2008116185). \n\n However, we surprisingly found that by introducing an electron-withdrawing substituent at the position 5 of the pyrimidine-ring the potency of the compounds as adenosine A\n2a\n antagonists can be considerably increased in comparison to the parent unsubstituted derivatives, as illustrated by the following examples: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ki (A2a) = 300 nM Ki (A2a) = 6 nM (Example 48) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ki (A\n2a\n) = 300 nM Ki (A\n2a\n) = 15 nM (Example 46) \n\n Detailed description of the invention \n\n\nThe present invention relates to new pyrimidine derivatives of formula (I): \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(I) \n\n\n Wherein: \n\n\n- R\n1\n represents a five-membered heteroaryl ring optionally substituted by one or more selected substituents of the group consisting of halogen, lower alkyl, cycloalkyl, lower alkoxy or cyano \n\n\n- R\n2\n represents independently: \n\n\n a) a hydrogen atom \n\n\n b) an alkyl or cycloalkyl group, which is optionally substituted by one or more halogen atoms or by one or more cycloalkyl, hydroxyl or alkoxy groups \n\n\n- R represents independently: \n\n\n a) an halogen atom \n\n\n b) a cyano group \n\n\n c) a trifluoromethyl group \n\n\n d) a cyclopropyl or cyclobutyl group \n\n\n e) a five-membered heteroaryl group optionally substituted by one or more halogen atoms or by one or more groups like alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkoxy, amino, mono- or dialkylamino \n\n\n- R\n4\n represents independently: \n\n a) a five-membered heteroaryl group optionally substituted by one or more halogen atoms or by one or more groups like alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkoxy, amino, mono- or dialkylamino, alkoxyalkyl \n\n\n b) a group N(R\n5\n)(R\n6\n) in which R\n5\n and R\n6\n represent independently: - a hydrogen atom \n\n\n- an alkyl or cycloalkyl group, linear or branched, optionally substituted by one or more halogen atoms or by one or more groups like cycloalkyl, alkoxy, amino, mono- or dialkylamino \n\n\n- R\n5\n and R\n6\n form together with the nitrogen atom to that they are attached a saturated heterocyclic group of 4 to 6 members in which further heteroatom may be inserted, which is optionally substituted by one or more halogen atoms c) a group -OR\n7\n or -SR\n7\n, where R\n7\n represents independently: \n\n\n- an alkyl or cycloalkyl group, linear or branched, optionally substituted by one or more halogen atoms or by one or more groups like cycloalkyl, alkoxy, amino, mono- or dialkylamino \n\n\n- a Phenyl ring optionally substituted with one or more halogen atoms Other aspects of the present invention are: a) pharmaceutically acceptable salts of such compounds, b) pharmaceutical compositions comprising an effective amount of said compounds, c) the use of such compounds in the manufacture of a medicament for treating diseases that can be improved by antagonism of an adenosine receptor, d) procedures for the treatment of diseases that can be improved by antagonism of an adenosine receptor comprising such procedures of the administration of these compounds of the invention to a subject requiring such treatment, and e) the combination of such compounds with other drugs used for the treatment of diseases conditions that can be improved by antagonism of an adenosine receptor. \n\n\nAs used herein the term lower alkyl embraces optionally substituted, linear or branched radicals having 1 to 8, preferably 1 to 6 and more preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms. \n\n\nExamples include methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, i-propyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl and tert-butyl, n- pentyl, 1 -methylbutyl, 2-methylbutyl, isopentyl, 1-ethylpropyl, 1,1-dimethylpropyl, 1,2- dimethylpropyl, n-hexyl, 1-ethylbutyl, 2-ethylbutyl, 1,1-dimethylbutyl, 1 ,2-dimethylbutyl, 1,3- \n\n dimethylbutyl, 2,2-dimethylbutyl, 2,3-dimethylbutyl, 2-methylpentyl, 3-methylpentyl, and iso- hexyl radicals. \n\n\nAs used herein, the term lower alkoxy embraces optionally substituted, linear or branched oxy-containing radicals each having alkyl portions of 1 to 8, preferably 1 to 6 and more preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms. \n\n\nPreferred alkoxy radicals include methoxy, ethoxy, n-propoxy, i-propoxy, n-butoxy, sec- butoxy, t-butoxy, trifluoromethoxy, difiuoromethoxy, hydroxymethoxy, 2-hydroxyethoxy or 2- hydroxypropoxy. \n\n\nAs used herein, the term lower alkylthio embraces optionally substituted, linear or branched thio-containing radicals each having alkyl portions of 1 to 8, preferably 1 to 6 and more preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms. \n\n\nPreferred alkylthio radicals include methylthio, ethylthio, n-propylthio, i-propylthio, n- butylthio, sec-butylthio, t-butylthio, trifluoromethylthio, difluoromethylthio, hydroxymethylthio, 2- hydroxyiethylthio or 2-hydroxypropylthio.

When an aromatic radical or moiety carries 2 or more substituents, the substituents may be the same or different. \n\n\nAs used herein, the term five-membered heteroaryl ring embraces typically a 5-membered ring system comprising at least one heteroaromatic ring and containing at least one heteroatom selected from O, S, and N. \n\n Examples include furyl, oxadiazolyl, oxazolyl, imidazolyl, thiazolyl, thiadiazolyl, thienyl, pyrrolyl, triazolyl, imidazolidinyl, and pyrazolyl radicals. The preferred radicals are pyrazolyl, triazolyl, thiazolyl, and furyl optionally substituted. When a heteroaryl radical carries 2 or more substituents, the substituents may be the same or different. \n\n\nAs used herein, some of the atoms, radicals, moieties, chains or cycles present in the general structures of the invention are \"optionally substituted\". This means that these atoms, radicals, moieties, chains or cycles can be either unsubstituted or substituted in any position by one or more, for example 1, 2, 3 or 4, substituents, whereby the hydrogen atoms bound to the unsubstituted atoms, radicals, moieties, chains or cycles are replaced by chemically acceptable atoms, radicals, moieties, chains or cycles. When two or more substituents are present, each substituent may be the same or different. \n\n\nAs used herein, the term halogen atom embraces chlorine, fluorine, bromine or iodine atoms typically a fluorine, chlorine or bromine atom, most preferably chlorine or fluorine. The term halo when used as a prefix has the same meaning. As used herein, the term pharmaceutically acceptable salt embraces salts with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid or base. Pharmaceutically acceptable acids include both inorganic acids, for example hydrochloric, sulphuric, phosphoric, diphosphoric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic and nitric acid and organic acids, for example citric, fumaric, maleic, malic, mandelic, ascorbic, oxalic, succinic, tartaric, benzoic, acetic, methanesulphonic, ethanesulphonic, benzenesulphonic or p-toluenesulphonic acid. Pharmaceutically acceptable bases include alkali metal (e.g. sodium or potassium) and alkali earth metal (e.g. calcium or magnesium) hydroxides and organic bases, for example alkyl amines, arylalkyl amines and heterocyclic amines. \n\n\nOther preferred salts according to the invention are quaternary ammonium compounds wherein an equivalent of an anion (X-) is associated with the positive charge of the N atom. X- may be an anion of various mineral acids such as, for example, chloride, bromide, iodide, sulphate, nitrate, phosphate, or an anion of an organic acid such as, for example, acetate, maleate, fumarate, citrate, oxalate, succinate, tartrate, malate, mandelate, trifluoroacetate, methanesulphonate and p- toluenesulphonate.

The synthetic routes are described using specific examples, which are not limiting in anyway the scope of the present invention. \n\n Derivatives where the substituent R\n3\n is a bromine or chlorine atom can be prepared by the sequence of reactions represented in Scheme 1. \n\n\nThe methylthio group of the commercially available (Aldrich) derivative of formula (II) has been oxidized using 1.2 equivalents of meta-chloroperbenzoic acid at room temperature in dichloromethane (DCM) as solvent giving the sulphoxide of formula (III), which precipitates directly from the reaction. \n\n\nThe position 5 of the pyrimidine derivative of formula (III) has been brominated using N- bromosuccinimide in dimethylformamide (DMF) at room temperature affording the derivative of formula (IV). The analogous reaction using N-chlorosuccinimide leads to chlorinated derivatives in position 5 of pyrimidine ring are also the subject of the present invention. \n\n\nScheme 1 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (VI) (VI I) (VI I I) \n\n\nReagents and conditions: (a) m-chloroperbenzoic acid (1.2 eq), DCM, RT; (b) N- bromosuccinimide (1.2 eq), DMF, RT; (c) pyrazole (1.3 eq), cesium carbonate, DMF, RT; (d) 3- methylpyrazole (3 eq), cesium carbonate, DMF, 85°C; (e) Pyrrolidine (3 eq), THF, 60°C; (f) Sodium methoxide, methanol, RT. \n\n\nThe halogenated sulphoxides of formula (IV) react with different commercially available five-membered heterocycle (e.g. pyrazoles or triazoles) derivatives at room temperature using \n\n dimethylformamide (DMF) as solvent in the presence of a base such as cesium carbonate. For example if compound of formula (IV) reacts with pyrazole under these conditions affords the derivative of formula (V). \n\n\nThe chlorine atom in position 6 of the pyrimidine derivative of formula (V) can be also substituted by five-membered heterocycle derivatives (e.g. pyrazoles or triazoles) using DMF as solvent and the presence of a base such as cesium carbonate at 85°C. For example, the reaction of derivative (V) with pyrazole under these conditions affords the compound of formula (VI), which is an example of the type of compounds claimed by the present invention. \n\n\nMoreover pyrimidine derivatives of formula (V) may also react with primary or secondary commercially available amines, alcohols and thiols at room temperature to afford compound of formula (I) claimed by the present invention. For example reaction of derivative (V) with pyrrolidine or sodium methoxide under these conditions lead to the formation of compound of formula (VII) or (VIII), which are specific examples of compounds of formula (I) claimed in the present invention. \n\n\nTo synthesize pyrimidine derivatives in which the substituent R\n3\n of the 5-position of pyrimidine defined above corresponds to a cyano group or heteroaryl groups, the procedures described in Scheme 2 can be used. \n\n\nScheme 2 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(IX) (X) \n\n\nReagents and conditions: (g) Copper (I) cyanide (1.1 eq), pyridine, microwave (MW), 20 min at 250°C; (h) thiazolyl-2-tributylstannane, cesium carbonate, palladium catalyst, dioxane, water, MW, 20 min at 150°C. \n\n\nThe introduction of the cyano group is carried out using the method described by A. P. Ijzerman et al. Biorganic & Medical Chemistry 2008. For example, the reaction of bromoderivatives of formula (VII) with copper (I) cyanide under microwave conditions 20 minutes at 250°C afforded the compound of formula (IX) containing a cyano group in position 5 of pyrimidine ring. \n\n\nOn the other hand, the bromo-derivative of formula (VI) reacts with commercial heteroaryl-boronic acids in a conventional Suzuki coupling reaction or with commercially available \n\n heteroaryl-tributylstannane derivatives in a conventional Stille reaction to give the derivatives where the position five of the pyrimidine ring is substituted by a heterocyclic ring. For example, reaction of compound of formula (VII) with the 2-tributylstannyl thiazole mediated by palladium catalysis yields compound of formula (X), which is a specific example of the compounds claimed in the present invention. \n\n\nThe compounds in which the amino group at position 4 of the pyrimidine ring is substituted by an alkyl group R\n2\n as defined above can be obtained using the synthetic route described in scheme 3. \n\n\nScheme 3 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (XIII) (XII) Reagents and conditions: (i) NaN0\n2\n (10 eq), AcOH, RT; (j) Thionyl chloride (2 eq),\n\n\nDMF/DCM, 40°C, 2h; (k) R\n2\n-NH\n2\n (3 eq), THF, RT, 24h. \n\n The derivative of formula (VI) reacts with sodium nitrite in acetic acid at room temperature to the respective pyrimidinone of formula (XI). The reaction of this derivative with thionyl chloride in a solution of DMF/DCM (1/2 : v/v) at 40°C leads to the formation of the 4-chloro-pyrimidine derivative of formula (XII). Compound (XII) reacts then with commercially available amines in very good yields giving the desired N-pyrimidine-4-amines of formula (XIII), which are the subject of the present invention. \n\n\nIf the residues R\n1\n and R\n4\n, defined in the general formula (I), are the same, the derivatives can also be synthesized following the procedure described in Scheme 4. \n\n\nScheme 4 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (XVI) \n\n\nReagents and conditions: (L) N-bromosuccinimide (1.2 eq), DMF, RT; (m) 4- methylpyrazole (4 eq), cesium carbonate, DMF, 85°C. \n\n\nBromination of commercially available compound of formula (XIV) is carried out with N- bromosuccinimide in DMF giving the compound of formula (XV). The reaction of compound (XrV) with different commercial pyrazoles in the presence of cesium carbonate in DMF at 85°C leads to the formation of the pyrimidine derivatives substituted by identical pyrazole derivatives at position 2 and 6, such as compound of formula (XVI), which is an specific example of the compounds of formula (I) claimed by the present invention. \n\n In an analogous manner, if the residue R\n4\n , as defined in the general formula (I), is an alkyl or cycloalkyl group, the derivatives can also be synthesized following the procedure described in Scheme 5. Scheme 5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(XIX) \n\n\nReagents and conditions: (L) N-bromosuccinimide (1.2 eq), DMF, RT; (m) pyrazole (4 eq), cesium carbonate, DMF, 85°C. \n\n\nBromination of commercially available compound of formula (XVII) is carried out with N- bromosuccinimide in DMF giving the compound of formula (XVIII). The reaction of compound (XVIII) with different commercial pyrazoles in the presence of cesium carbonate in DMF at 85 ° C leads to the formation of the derivatives, such as compound of formula (XIX), which is an specific example of the compounds of formula (I) claimed by the present invention. \n\n\nWhen the substituents at position 2 and 6 of the pyrimidine ring are heterocyclic rings that can not be introduced by nucleophilic substitution, the corresponding derivatives can be synthesized as described in Scheme 6. \n\n\nCommercially available derivative (XVI) reacts with commercially available pinacol esters of heteroaryl-boronic acids in a conventional Suzuki coupling reaction or with commercially available heteroaryl-tributylstannane derivatives in a conventional Stille reaction to give a mixture of all possible substitutions that can be separated by column chromatography. For example, reaction of compound of formula (XVI) with the 2-tributylstannyl thiazole mediated by palladium \n\n catalysis yields compounds of formula (XX), (XXI) and (XXII). Those intermediates can be brominated and substitute by several pyrazo derivatives giving compounds of formula (XXIII), (XrV) and (XV), which represent specific examples of the compounds of formula (I) claimed by the present invention. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (XXIII) (XXIV) (xxv) \n\n\nReagents and conditions: (h) (h) thiazolyl-2-tributylstannane, cesium fluoride, palladium catalyst, dioxane, 24 h at 80°C; (L) N-bromosuccinimide (1.2 eq), DMF, RT; (m) pyrazole (4 eq), cesium carbonate, DMF, 85°C. \n\n\nPHARMACOLOGICAL ACTIVITY Adenosine A¾, receptor subtype competition radioligand binding assay \n\n Human membranes from recombinant adenosine receptors were purchased from Receptor Biology, Inc.
